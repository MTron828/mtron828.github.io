Chapter 2998: Magic Note Divine Kingdom

——

In the dark void of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom’s territory.

Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, was flying rapidly. He was holding a list in his hand and looking at it carefully.

This list was a list of experts.

According to the information of this mission, the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had been established for many years. The 36 territories under its control were completely controlled by the Magic Note Divine Fruit. It could be said that the Magic Note Divine Kingdom was capital in this territory!

In such a huge Divine Kingdom, there were many experts. These experts ruled everything. Over time, there would naturally be some scum.

According to the precise information obtained by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, there were more than 100 experts in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom who were guilty of crimes. Among them, there were 12 who were deemed to be extremely evil by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and were extremely powerful.

These 12 experts were on the kill list in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Jian Wushuang’s mission this time was to kill all 12 experts on this kill list!

“Among these 12 experts, even the weakest one is a rank one True Saint. The slightly stronger one is a peak rank one True Saint. In addition, three of them are rank two True Saints!” Looking at the introduction of these experts on the kill list, Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh.

There were twelve experts, and they were all True Saint experts.

A True Saint had an immortal body, so it was very difficult to kill one of them. It was indeed a very challenging task for Jian Wushuang to kill all twelve of them.

Moreover, among the twelve True Saints, three of them were rank two True Saints.

If it were 120 years ago, he would have been able to fight against a rank two True Saint. But now, although his strength had greatly increased and he was confident that he could defeat most rank two True Saints, nothing was absolute.

Moreover, defeating and killing an opponent were two completely different concepts.

Logically speaking, this task should have been completed by a rank three True Saint.

“With my current strength, it should not be difficult to defeat these True Saints, but it is not easy to kill them one by one. Fortunately, I went to Sir Tianshuo to exchange for 50 drops of god-burning poison. I don’t know if it is enough.”

“In addition, even if I’m lucky enough to kill all 12 experts on this kill list, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to leave the Magic Note Divine Kingdom safely.” Jian Wushuang thought.

He could imagine.

The 12 experts on this list were all experts under the command of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Some of them had made outstanding contributions to the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, and some of them were even top officials of the border.

If he only killed one or two of them, the top officials of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom would not care too much.

Killing 12 such experts at once would make the Magic Note Divine Kingdom furious, and they would certainly try to kill him.

In other words, there would be many unexpected changes in his mission.

The risk was very high.

However, it was because of the risk that Jian Wushuang specially accepted this mission.

Three days later.

In one of the realms under the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, Jian Wushuang came to a stretch of mountains, and there was a huge and beautiful manor below.

“Is the first target I want to kill living in this manor?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void above, coldly, but his soul power had already covered the manor below.

In a Golden Palace in the center of the manor.

Dong! Mou! Dang!

The sound of various musical instruments echoed in the huge palace. In the center of the palace, more than a dozen beauties were dancing.

They were dancing beautifully, and their faces were also extremely beautiful.

On the lofty golden throne at the top of the palace, a barefoot middle-aged man wearing a loose golden robe was looking down with an evil smile. Suddenly, he slowly extended his right hand, and a sharp light shot out from his fingertip, suddenly.

Chi!

This sharp light shot through the palace like lightning, directly scraping off the clothes and flesh of one of the beauties.

“Ah!”

The beauty cried out in alarm.

“Don’t shout, keep dancing.” The golden-robed middle-aged man said with a strange smile.

The beauty did not dare to get angry. She endured the pain and humiliation on her waist, and continued to dance for the golden-robed middle-aged man.

The golden-robed middle-aged man stretched out his hand once again!

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Rays of sharp light shot out continuously and swept past the bodies of the beauty maidens. The clothes of these beauty maidens had all been taken off, and some of their flesh and blood had also been sliced off by the sharp light, in the worst case scenario, one of the beauty maidens’ entire arm had been sliced off.

However, no matter how wantonly the golden-robed middle-aged man humiliated her, these beauty maidens did not dare to say a single word. They could only endure the humiliation.

They knew very well what kind of demon the golden-robed man was.

If they resisted him, their fate would be worse than death.

“Keep dancing! Keep dancing!”

The golden-robed middle-aged man spoke again with a smile on his face.

Jian Wushuang, who was in the void above the manor, saw this scene and could not help shaking his head.

“Those beauties are all Divine Masters and above. Two of them have reached the Great Divine Master realm. If they were in an ordinary realm, they would definitely be considered top experts. But in the hands of the golden-robed middle-aged man, they are like playthings!”

“Also, the golden-robed middle-aged man’s tricks are really strange. No wonder the Heaven-cleaving Alliance put him on the kill list.”

Jian Wushuang sighed secretly.

“There’s no need to tangle with such a heinous person. Just kill him with lightning-fast methods!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light, but his figure, which was standing in the high sky, suddenly swooped down.

Boom!

Like a meteor falling from the sky, Jian Wushuang directly entered the manor.

The restriction that had been covering the surroundings of the manor was nothing to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang barged in so openly, so he naturally attracted the attention of many people at the first moment. Many figures immediately rushed out of the manor, but they could not stop Jian Wushuang at all.

Jian Wushuang arrived at the Golden Palace without any obstruction.

At the top of the Golden Palace, the golden-robed middle-aged man’s eyes were like lightning. He immediately looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Who are you?”

“I’m the one who killed you!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. As soon as he finished his words, his body suddenly swayed.

This sway seemed to be an easy one, but Jian Wushuang had already completely unleashed his comprehension of the space-time principles.

The second stage of the most extreme comprehension made him burst out at an incredible speed, at least beyond the scope of a first level True Saint.

“This speed!”

The golden-robed middle-aged man’s face changed greatly. He had already seen Jian Wushuang’s figure appear in front of him, and at the same time, a beautiful and equally fast sword light had already cut across him.
