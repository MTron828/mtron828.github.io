Clang!

Fo Yi felt a huge force coming his way as a low impact crashing noise resounded.

The golden spear in his hand slightly changed its direction under the huge force, but the black divine sword continued to shoot at his head without losing any momentum.

“What?”

Fo Yi was taken aback but managed to immediately recover his senses. He abruptly retreated, withdrew his spear, and collided it again with the black divine sword before finally able to resist the black divine sword’s attack. However, the huge force had forced him to miserably retreat.

“Why did his divine power suddenly increase by so much?” Fo Yi was shocked.

He could feel the black divine sword’s power was far more powerful than before.

The Nine Sparkle Star Armor was one of the five most powerful secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sect.

The armor formed from the secret technique greatly enhanced the one’s strength once worn and fused with the cultivator.

Jian Wushuang had previously cultivated only to the Golden Armor Chapter level which allowed him to increase his attacking power by three folds.

On the other hand, the Precious Armor Chapter could increase his attacking power by six folds!

What exactly was the concept of six folds?

Jian Wushuang’s divine power was originally a bit stronger than Fo Yi. However, his strength had crushed Fo Yi after a six-fold divine power increment.

“I’m no better than you in terms of understanding the laws and principles, but I know one thing’s for sure—brute force conquered all. Brute strength is all I need to annihilate everything.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he stared at Fo Yi.

“Kill!”

The black divine sword formed by the Transmigration Sword Formation was sent out again with great power upon his loud commands.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s figure also moved at an astonishing speed with the Space-time Law strength’s help.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The black divine sword charged again and again while Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword was attacking fiercely. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The motion was almost unrealistic as it was a pure frenzied bombardment of power.

It was such a brutal attack that exerted a great deal of pressure on Fo Yi.

“It’s way too powerful. His power is way too powerful. Although he’s not as great compared with a High-level Grand Ultimate God, he’s much stronger than ordinary Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. He had such a powerful force brings despite being only a Peak Heaven Ultimate God. Fighting him incites fear in me. How on earth can he be so strong?” Fo Yi was amazed.

What Fo Yi did not realize was that Jian Wushuang’s divine power was not that powerful. He was at the Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God realm at that moment. Even with his Perfect Chaotic Creature physique, his divine power had merely increased to the Peak Heaven Ultimate God.

It was simply his basic level of strength.

The reason he was able to discharge a much stronger divine power was because of the secret techniques he had cultivated.

The Seven Stars Secret Technique improved his cultivation realm by a realm.

The Divine God of Punishment with the 8,000-foot-tall Golden God Shadow improved his divine power strength!

The Primordial Void Celestial Body that he had completed to the third scroll raised his divine body and power to a greater strength level.

The most important part was the Precious Armor Chapter in Nine Sparkle Star Armor that boosted his power by six-folds.

All those had superimposed to create Jian Wushuang’s outrageously powerful strength level.

Fo Yi had also realized that pure power could crush everything.

Jian Wushuang’s understanding of laws and principles was far inferior to Fo Yi, but his power was so strong that Fo Yi felt fearful when confronting Jian Wushuang. Fo Yi could only use some petty actions and methods to indirectly attack Jian Wushuang, but its effects were minimal.

As such, the state of battle had completely inverted with Jian Wushuang taking the absolute initiative and upper hand as he ruthlessly crushed everything and completely suppressed Fo Yi.

“How did it turn out like this?”

The many experts who watched the battle around them were astonished.

Those Star Fort experts’ eyes especially widened and they were almost unable to believe what they saw.

Their Fort Master was a genuine Grand Ultimate God with his strength having skyrocketed since exiting from his seclusion. He could even suppress the famous Old Snake but failed in Jian Wushuang’s hands who was merely a Peak Heaven Ultimate God.

“An absolute crushing power. Jian Wushuang is merely a Peak Heaven Ultimate God. How can his power be so outrageously horrifying?” Old Snake was shocked.

On the battlefield...

“Boy, don’t be presumptuous!”

Fo Yi shouted as his divine power breath was raised to a new height in the next second. A bright golden light burst out from his divine body and turned it into gold. He became like a shining Buddha.

The golden spear in his hand had also leveled up. It thrust fiercely and collided with Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword. As a result, both of them were sent backward by the momentum.

Jian Wushuang regained his footing and stared at Fo Yi who had turned into a golden Buddha with his slightly narrowed eyes.

“No wonder he’s able to suppress Old Snake. His strength is indeed impressive. His secret techniques are also very good,” said Jian Wushuang secretly.

Fo Yi’s face was extremely ugly.

“I’ve performed my strongest secret technique and best trump card, yet he merely needed to use his sword to resist. It seems that we’re equal in terms of strength... Such a scary power. It seems impossible for me to kill him and avenge my brother. In addition, that Old Snake is nearby. I’m afraid I’m not their match even if I tried my best once they joined hands.”

“I shall leave for now and continue improving my strength with that treasure’s help. I’ll be back to seek revenge when I’m confident of killing him once my understanding of law and principle improves or when I’ve made a breakthrough in my cultivation realm.”

Fo Yi made a decision.

“Boy, you are lucky this time. I’ll make you pay for my brother’s death sooner or later!”

“Let’s go!” Fo Yi gave a low cry and had decided to turn around to leave.

“You want to leave? What do you think the Sword Alliance is? Do you think you can come and go as you wish?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and sharp. His golden divine power instantly erupted and swept frenziedly toward Fo Yi before blocking his path.

Fo Yi’s face sank with a fit of strong vengeful anger.

He had decided to retreat but it was ‘Su Han’ who was unwilling to let him go at that moment.
