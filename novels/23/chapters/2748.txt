Chapter 2749: Meeting Yin Su’er

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang once again returned to the Sacred Palace with his disciple status.

He immediately went to meet Palace Keeper Si Zhen within a magnificent-looking palace upon his arrival.

“Palace Keeper Si Zen, please help me send a message to the Fort Master and tell her that I’d like to see her,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen frowned and looked at Jian Wushuang. “You want to see the Fort Master? Jian Yi, you may not know about this but the relationship between the factions within Crimson Stone Fort is very delicate during this period and there are signs of chaos happening. I suggest if you don’t have very urgent matters...”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand before Palace Keeper Si Zhen could finish and said, “Palace Keeper Si Zhen, please send the message as I want to see her because of some major issue which will affect the situation within Crimson Stone Fort.”

“In that case, wait a moment as I send a message to the Fort Master now.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen immediately sent a message to Yin Su’er before receiving a reply within a short moment.

“Jian Yi, the Fort Master said she’ll find time to see you later. She hopes what you want to tell her is really very important,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“Don’t worry.” Jian Wushuang smiled confidently.

Jian Wushuang waited quietly in the magnificent palace.

A tall and beautiful woman with an oval face who was wearing an ice blue gown appeared in the palace after half a day.

The beautiful woman was none other than Yin Su’er.

“Jian Yi, what can I do for you?” Yin Su’er looked cold.

“There’s something...about Saber Master,” answered Jian Wushuang.

“Saber Master?” Yin Su’er was surprised.

There were seven factions within the Crimson Stone Fort. Although Saber Master belonged to a small faction, his faction still carried a lot of weight and influence in the Crimson Stone Fort. In addition, Saber Master was rather powerful with similar strength as Blood Thunder King who controlled the Crimson Stone Official Army with only weaker being weaker than the Fort Master and Grand Elder Yun Shan who were Peak Grand Ultimate Gods.

Therefore, Yin Su’er had never considered Saber Master as someone paltry.

“What’s the matter with Saber Master?” Yin Su’er looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“Fort Master, you probably haven’t got this news yet but he’s dead,” said Jian Wushuang with a grin.

“What did you say?” Yin Su’er was shocked to hear the news.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen had also been alerted.

“Jian Yi, did you say that Saber Master is dead? How can this be possible? I just got the news that Saber Master had gone to cultivate in seclusion not long ago. He seems to be at a very important cultivation stage and told his followers not to disturb him unless necessary. “Yin Su’er looked at Jian Wushuang dubiously.

Jian Wushuang gave a simple wave before a purple battle saber appeared in his hand.

“Fort Master, do you recognize this battle saber?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“This...” Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s pupils constricted as they looked at the saber and were startled.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen said, “This battle saber indeed belongs to Saber Master. I’ve seen him use this many times and can’t be wrong about it. How did this battle saber appear in your hands? Is Saber Master really dead?”

“Jian Yi, how did Saber Master die? Why is his battle saber with you? Did you kill him?” Yin Su’er frowned slightly.

She initially did not believe Saber Master was dead. However, she knew it must be true the moment she saw the battle saber.

Yin Su’er was immediately reminded that Jian Wushuang could be the person who killed Saber Master since the battle saber was with him.

However, she was still uncertain as even she might not succeed in killing Saber Master. ‘How can Jian Yi possibly kill Saber Master?’

“It doesn’t matter how he died and who killed him. What’s important is that he’s now dead. The faction he belongs to will definitely fall apart without a leader in control. The entire Crimson Stone Fort might be affected and turn chaotic. Fort Master, you have to make early preparations,” said Jian Wushuang.

Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen looked solemn.

Saber Master was rather influential in the Crimson Stone Fort—his death would indeed cause a great deal of impact in the Crimson Stone Fort.

The most important matter was his faction’s collapse might also in turn affect the situation of several other factions.

Although there were incessant internal conflicts among the Crimson Stone Fort for years, there were no overt conflicts. There were the occasional assassinations but the situation was under control nonetheless. The situation in Crimson Stone Fort might be disrupted with Saber Master’s death.

“Saber Master’s death will definitely wreak havoc in Crimson Stone Fort. This is definitely an excellent opportunity for me to take advantage of the chaos to wipe out the other factions and unify Crimson Stone Fort. However, my current strength may not be enough for me to carry out the plan,” said Yin Su’er coldly.

Saber Master’s death and the subsequent chaotic future situation were seemingly a good opportunity for her.

However, it was true that she was not powerful enough to handle the situation.

Her current strength was inadequate even to go against Grand Elder Yun Shan or Blood Thunder King’s faction. It was absolutely impossible for her to completely smoothen out all the major factions. The best scenario was she might get lucky and reap more benefits from those factions but gaining control over them would be challenging.

“Fort Master alone may not be enough to take this opportunity to smoothen out the other factions, but matters will be different with my assistance,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“You?” Yin Su’er looked at Jian Wushuang quizzically.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen was also staring at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Yi, I know you’re the Sword Alliance Master that has been stirring up the situation in the Danyang Continent over this period of time. Am I right?” Yin Su’er asked.

She had always paid attention to Jian Wushuang and knew Jian Wushuang was creating his own force.

Although Jian Wushuang had never revealed the name of the force he had created, Yin Su’er and Crimson Stone Fort had the capabilities to easily discover it.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“It’s indeed amazing to be able to create a huge Sword Alliance in the Danyang Continent within just a few decades. In fact, the Sword Alliance is as powerful as first-rated forces but there’s still a long way to go for the Sword Alliance before it is capable of threatening the situation in the Crimson Stone Fort or exercising influence over Danyang Continent.” Yin Su’er shook her head.

“A long way to go? That’s not necessarily.”

Jian Wushuang smiled with absolute confidence.

He then waved his hand before four figures appeared out of thin air beside him.

Those four figures were the four corpse puppets he obtained from the secret realm.

“Fort Master, can you see what these are?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Are these war puppets? No, they must be some cultivators but they’re so lifeless... These must be corpse puppets.” Yin Su’er narrowed her eyes.

“You’re right. They’re corpse puppets. I’ll get them to greet you.”

Jian Wushuang grinned before waving his hand as the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet immediately raised its head.
