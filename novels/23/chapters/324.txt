Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Just then, a scarlet-robed figure went forward.

It was a young man who gave off an evil impression, followed by a strong and unusual man with purple hair.

“A Tricolor Hyaline Vine.”

The scarlet-robed youth’s gaze sharpened when he saw the Three-colored Spiritual Vine in the big man’s hand. Immediately he took out an Interspatial Ring and said, “Here are three Divine Power Elixirs, one million Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.”

The big man was tempted. After glancing over the Interspatial Ring, he smiled.

But Chi Mei’s face fell. He looked over at the scarlet-robed youth and said in a deep voice, “Young man, I was here first.”

“And?” The scarlet-robed youth sneered and said, “So what? He didn’t promise to give it to you, did he?”

“Young man, you want to play with fire, right?” Chi Mei was angry. Cold light flashed in his eyes.

“Oh?” The scarlet-robed youth sneered and looked at the strong man with purple hair behind him, “Chao, get this old man out of my face.”

“Yes.” The strong man with purple hair looked over at Chi Mei and shouted, “Old man, do you want to leave on your own or do I have to use force?”

Immediately, brutality and unreasonableness spread from the purple-haired man.

“The Half-saint Realm!”

“He is a Half-saint expert!”

“I heard that a lot of experts would gather in the Ice Nether Valley this time, including a few Half-saints even experts of the Saint Realm, but I didn’t expect to see one here.”

The strong man with purple hair had caused a stir among warriors on the street.

“Haha, I’d like to see you try,” he said and laughed, while filled with anger.

“Hum.” The strong man with purple hair snorted without saying anything. Instead, he quickly gathered his power, which turned into a phantom and then rushed out.

Chi Mei stood still with a cold and calm face, but in his eyes, killing intent was gathering.

He promised himself that as soon as the strong man with purple hair made his move, he would kill him.

However, right as the strong man with purple hair was about to attack...

“Wait!”

A deep shout was heard. It seemed to possess a magic power, causing the strong man with purple hair to stop unconsciously.

Of course, it was Jian Wushuang.

He stood in front of Chi Mei and looked at the scarlet-robed youth. Then, with a smile on his face, he said, “Master, please forgive my steward’s hot temper.”

“Oh?” The scarlet-robed youth’s eyes turned to Jian Wushuang slowly, but he couldn’t see his face because Jian Wushuang had pulled his bamboo hat down.

“Rats.” The scarlet-robed youth sneered with scorn.

“Since you want the Tricolor Hyaline Vine, we will not fight for it. We’re leaving. ” After saying that, Jian Wushuang turned and motioned for Chi Mei to leave.

Chi Mei was unwilling to leave, but he had to because of Jian Wushuang. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The scarlet-robed youth just sneered because he had never taken Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei seriously.

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei walked down the street. However, Chi Mei’s face was sullen.

“That was humiliating!”

“I haven’t been insulted like this since I reached the Saint Realm.” Chi Mei complained, “Swordsman, why did you save their lives?”

Yes!

If Jian Wushuang hadn’t stopped Chi Mei, the strong man with purple hair would have died.

And surely, Chi Mei would kill the scarlet-robed youth as well.

But he had been stopped by Jian Wushuang.

“We are at the entrance to Ice Nether Valley, and they are watching everything we do. Besides, those two people should have backgrounds. Once you display your strength, you will definitely attract the Ice Nether Valley’s attention.”

“However, we are here to make trouble for the Ice Nether Valley. Therefore, it’s better to be low-key before we act.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold and calm, “Those two people also came to attend the wedding. You can deal with them after we take action.”

Chi Mei went blank. Then he looked at Jian Wushuang, nodded unwillingly, and said, “You are stronger and the magic weapon is still in your hands, so you are the boss. But once this is done, I will kill him no matter who he is.”

“After we finish our business here, you can do whatever you want to,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei lost their interest because of what happened, so they went back to their rooms.

The next day, which was the day before the wedding ceremony, Ice Nether Valley opened its door to welcome all the incoming experts.

Both Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei went to the entrance of Ice Nether Valley. Unfortunately, they met the scarlet-robed youth and the strong man with purple hair at the door.

“Haha, our young master will be very happy when he hears that Master Wuxin came.” An expert from Ice Nether Valley enthusiastically welcomed the scarlet-robed youth.

“I haven’t seen brother Ye Chen in a long time, could you lead me to see him?” The scarlet-robed youth said.

“My pleasure.” The expert from Ice Nether Valley led him, in person, into Ice Nether Valley.

It attracted lots of attention at the door.

“Who is he? Why do they treat him so politely? Besides, it sounds like he has a good relationship with Ye Chen.”

“Hehe, I know him. He is the young sect master of Magic Cloud Sect, Nie Wuxin. People call him Master Wuxin. The Magic Cloud Sect is an affiliate of Ice Nether Valley, so they follow Ice Nether Valley’s lead. Master Wuxin also has a good relationship with Ye Chen.”

“He is Master Wuxin?”

Soon everyone knew who the scarlet-robed youth was.

“Magic Cloud Sect, Master Wuxin?” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, looked at Chi Mei, and said, sarcastically, “Did you hear that? The young man we met yesterday is a young sect master.”

“Hum, Magic Cloud Sect?” Chi Mei sneered, “I have heard of it. Though I don’t know the Sect Master, I know the Upper Elder. He started comprehending domain not long ago, but his strength is weaker than mine. How could a two-bit sect be so arrogant! How ignorant they are!”
