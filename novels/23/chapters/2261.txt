Jian Wushuang and his parents went to visit many other places.

Two hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.

Green Fire World, Wushuang City.

A large number of people were gathered there.

All of the higher-ups from the Green Fire World and Lineage of Stars were there.

Jian Wushuang was in front of everyone.

“Sword Emperor, Emperor Bai wants to tell you that the Sanctuary Alliance is ready. Once you are ready to go, they can send you to Heaven’s Horizon immediately,” one of the Emperor God from Sanctuary Alliance said.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head as he looked at the people in front of him.

Among these people were his family members, his brothers, his good friends and his disciples.

Jian Wushuang looked at them with mixed feelings.

“Brother,” Wang Yuan said as he gave Jian Wushuang a bottle of elixir.

“Wang Yuan, what is this?” Jian Wushuang asked, curious.

“There are two elixirs inside this bottle. It took me some effort to make it. Take it. You might need it at Heaven’s Horizon,” Wang Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang opened the bottle in disbelief. He was stunned when he saw the two elixirs.

Both the elixirs were cream in colour and radiated a seductive fragrance. Many experts yearned to have these elixirs.

Jian Wushuang recognized this type of elixir.

“Seven Treasure Divine Elixir!”

Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised.

He had had of these elixirs a long time ago.

Emperor Bai had given him one when he first sneaked into the Three Emperors World so he could use it just in case his life was in danger. However, Jian Wushuang had still not made use of it.

Now, Wang Yuan was giving him two of these elixirs?

Back in the ancient past, the Seven Treasure Divine Elixir was an extremely high grade elixir and was very beneficial for Jian Wushuang.

This elixir recovered divine power extremely quickly. When Jian Wushuang was still in the first phase of the Seventh Step Inverse Cultivation, one of these elixirs was enough for him to recover all of his divine power.

Now that he was in the Ultimate Phase of the Seventh Step Inverse Cultivation, he had much more divine power than before. However, the Seven Treasure Divine Elixir was still an extremely useful elixir.

Jian Wushuang estimated that all of his divine power could be recovered if he took all three Seven Treasure Divine Elixirs at the same time.

Divine Power was extremely important for Jian Wushuang as he was in the Seventh Step Inverse Cultivation and he possessed the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body.

If he could recover most of his divine power within a short period of time, it would be equivalent to him having many extra lives.

“Wang Yuan Older Brother, since when can you make such an incredible elixir?” Jian Wushuang asked Wang Yuan in disbelief.

“Sigh. I wanted to try to make this elixir a long time ago, but I always failed to do so. Recently, I locked myself in the secret room and swore that I would only leave after making at least one of the Seven Treasure Divine Elixirs. I was pretty lucky as I made two,” Wang Yuan smiled.

Jian Wushuang heard this and felt really grateful.

He knew that Wang Yuan was a very easy-going and lazy man.

He was considered the best alchemist in the Eternal Chaotic World. When people looked for him for his service, he would not bother with them. Even if he agreed because his clients offered him sufficient rewards, he would only make the elixir in his own time.

Jian Wushuang thought that Wang Yuan would not try to make the Seven Treasure Divine Elixir as he had already failed several times.

However, Wang Yuan had actually forced himself into a secret room to focus on making this elixir. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Jian Wushuang knew that Wang Yuan had done this as Wang Yuan had gotten to know from Emperor Bai that the Seven Treasure Divine Elixir would be an extremely useful elixir for him.

When Jian Wushuang’s soul was severely injured and he had gone into deep slumber, Wang Yuan had spent more than twenty thousand years making the Ice Soul Elixir just so that he could recover.

Without a doubt, Wang Yuan viewed Jian Wushuang as a true brother.

“Thank you, Older Brother Wang Yuan,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Haha. We are brothers, why are you so polite?” Wang Yuan smiled casually.

“Please return early, bro,” Su Rou said with a serious tone.

As Jian Wushuang’s brother and sister, Su Rou and Wang Yuan both hoped that Jian Wushuang could bring his wife back.

After all, Su Rou was not an alchemist like Wang Yuan. All she could do was give him her good wishes.

For Jian Wushuang, that was more than enough.

“Father, mother, all of you, I shall be on my way.”

Jian Wushuang waved everyone goodbye as he turned and left.

Everyone there had mixed emotions as they watched him leave.

“My dear husband, why do I feel like he will not return?” Ji Wumeng knitted her eyebrows and said.

“What are you talking about? You and I both know how capable Wushuang is. Who in this Heaven and Earth could beat him? He will definitely come back, trust me,” Jian Nantian comforted her gently.

“Yes,” Ji Wumeng nodded her head.

Even though Jian Nantian had spoken firmly, he too was not confident in what he’d just said.

Even he had the feeling that Jian Wushuang would not return.

...

After Jian Wushuang left the Green Fire World, he headed straight for Thunderbolt Island.

Numerous great emperors had already gathered on Thunderbolt Island.

These great emperors like King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu and Black Dragon Emperor came from the Special Tribes, and there were some from the Sanctuary Alliance as well.

News of a link passage opening up at Heaven’s Horizon spread like wildfire across the higher ups in the Eternal Chaotic World. Many of the great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World would not miss their chance to see it.

Whoosh!

When Jian Wushuang appeared on Thunderbolt Island, many of the great emperors looked at him respectfully.

“Sword Emperor!”

“Ancient God Emperor!”

Everyone greeted Jian Wushuang.

He nodded his head lightly as he scanned the crowd. However, his gaze paused on Black Dragon Emperor for a short while before moving on.

Black Dragon Emperor had a cold aura. She looked at Jian Wushuang with mixed feelings.

Everyone knew that she liked Jian Wushuang, but it was a pity he could not love another woman anymore.

After Jian Wushuang had rejected her many years ago, she had given up on him. However, she was curious about who Jian Wushuang’s wife was and why he kept thinking about her.

Jian Wushuang was here for his wife.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re here,” Emperor Bai said as he looked at him.

“Yes. The linkway to Heaven’s Horizon should open anytime now. Let us not waste time and go,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head slightly and said.

“Alright. Let’s go.”

Emperor Bai ordered as they left for Heaven’s Horizon.
