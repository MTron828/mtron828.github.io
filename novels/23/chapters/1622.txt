“He is the hothead who feels that he has a long life ahead of him?”

“A Five-star Ancient God challenging the Star Moon Tower. Hehe. He is really courting death!”

“I have heard that Gu Jian is a Mixed Bloodline between Ancient Gods and human beings. Moreover, his Ancient God Bloodline seems to be of the Royal-class!”

“A Mixed Bloodline has become a Royal Ancient God?”

“Hmph, so what if he’s a Royal Ancient God? He is merely a Mixed Bloodline who is unrecognized. Moreover, he’s about to die today.”

Countless eyes were staring at Jian Wushuang. Most of them were filled with ridicule and pity.

“Jian Wushuang, ignore them and go straight to the Star Moon Tower,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang giggled. He had already ignored the gazes of the surrounding Ancient Gods a long time ago.

Jian Wushuang’s body turned vague and he had already entered the pitch-black ancient tower which was floating high up in the sky.

Atop the sacrificial altar.

“Scorpion, the first level of the Star Moon Tower is guarded by your Ancient God shadow, right? You have to hold back slightly. If not, it will be uninteresting if it ends at the first level.”

“That’s right. Don’t kill that little kid straight away.”

Some Six-star Ancient Gods laughed.

“Everything is according to the rules. I will use the abilities that I am supposed to use,” the apathetic old man known as Scorpion said calmly, “I shall stop talking now. It’s about to begin.”

After talking, the apathetic old man closed his eyes.

First level of the Star Moon Tower.

It was a giant wasteland with a scorching sun in the sky.

As soon as Jian Wushuang appeared in the wasteland, he noticed the giant shadow in front of him right away.

The giant shadow was an Ancient God. Moreover, it was a Six-star Ancient God. However, the aura on his body was not very strong.

“Haha. This Star Moon Tower is still the same as before,” as the King of Venomous Worms looked at the Six-star Ancient God, he laughed loudly at once.

“King of Venomous Worms, what’s going on?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“Jian Wushuang, I said before that you do not need to be too worried about the Star Moon Tower. To a normal person, the Star Moon Tower in indeed extremely difficult. However, to an Inverse Cultivator like you, it is not considered too difficult. Take the first level as an example. As you are only a Universe God and hence a Five-star Ancient God, the guard who you meet on the first level will only possess the fighting capabilities of a normal Six-star Ancient God and this is equivalent to that of a normal Void Real God of the human beings!”

“You only need to kill him and you will be able to clear the first level,” the King of Venomous Worms laughed.

“A normal Void Real God?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes moved, “Can I use the techniques of a human cultivator in here?”

“Of course. You can use any techniques you want,” the King of Venomous Worms laughed.

“That’s all I needed to know,” Jian Wushuang grinned.

At that very moment, the Six-star Ancient God was already looking at Jian Wushuang and his loud voice resounded, “You are really courageous to challenge the Star Moon Tower. However, it’s a pity that having too much courage sometimes mean that you are ignorant. Thus, you will have to pay a price for your own ignorance. Let’s begin.”

The Six-star Ancient God had already taken out his purple giant hammer.

“Ignorant?” Jian Wushuang smiled and sword essence rose from body.

At the next moment, Jian Wushuang moved!

Swish!

A glittering light swept past the void with rays of sword light appearing in the process in a flash.

Jian Wushuang had already appeared behind the Six-star Ancient God and he was already putting the Blood Mountain Sword into his scabbard.

“I wonder… who is the ignorant one?” Jian Wushuang’s laughter resounded across the wasteland.

The Six-star Ancient God who was holding the purple giant hammer had already opened his eyes wide and his face was filled with shock. He had already done ample preparations and had even taken his weapon out. However, from the start to the end, he did not even get a chance to swing the purple hammer that he had taken out and his body had already started to dissipate.

Outside the Star Moon Tower, atop the sacrificial altar.

The two Seven-star Ancient Gods King Gu Yi and Gu Mei as well as tens of top Six-star Ancient Gods were sitting down with interest and having a conversation.

All of a sudden, the apathetic old man known as ‘Scorpion’ opened his eyes and his eyes were filled with astonishment.

The surrounding Six-star Ancient Gods also noticed the actions of the apathetic old man and they looked over immediately.

“Scorpion, what happened? It’s over so quickly?”

“Isn’t that little kid too weak?”

Some Six-star Ancient Gods were still talking.

However, the apathetic man’s expression turned grave and he spoke immediately, “Everyone, the little kid has already cleared the first level.”

“What?”

The Ancient Gods atop the sacrificial altar were all stunned.

“He did it in only an instant?”

“How can he be so fast?”

“Scorpion, could it be that you really showed mercy and let that little kid clear the first level intentionally?”

“Scorpion, what’s going on?” King Gu Yi who was at the center of the sacrificial altar looked down.

The apathetic old man stood up straight away and said respectfully, “King Gu Yi, Lady Gu Mei and everyone else, all of you have always been clear about my conduct. I will do things properly, according to the rules. So, why would I show any mercy? The thing is that the little kid is not normal. The moment he made a move, my Ancient God shadow was killed by him with one stroke, before it was even able to react.”

“Killed by one stroke?”

“This…”

All the Six-star Ancient Gods had perplexed expressions.

“Looks like that little kid is not as stupid as we have thought. For him to challenge the Star Moon Tower, he must something that he can rely on,” Lady Gu Mei, who sat at the center giggled, “Since he possesses the Bloodline of human beings as well, he has definitely comprehended the Power of Heaven Way like human cultivators, and if I’m not wrong, his level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way is extremely high.”

“Ling Shan, the second level of the Star Moon Tower is guarded by your Ancient God shadow. Be careful.”

“Understood,” a big, tall man nodded his head respectfully.

However, after a short while, the big, tall man opened his eyes.

“Everyone, that little kid has already cleared the second level. Moreover, he only used one stroke, just like before.”

The Ancient Gods present became stupefied. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

For the third level of the Star Moon Tower after that, it was also cleared with one stroke.

At the very moment, the expressions of the Ancient Gods at the sacrificial altar turned grave.

The expressions of King Gu Yi and Gu Mei were extremely serious as well.

The first three levels of the Star Moon Tower were cleared. Moreover, all of them were cleared with one stroke?

This was enough to say that ‘Gu Jian’, who was challenging the Star Moon Tower, was not normal.

“Could it be that a second expert, who is able to clear the fourth level of the Star Moon Tower, is about to be born again in the Ancient God Clan?” a Six-star Ancient God could not help but say.

“Hmph, how can it be that easy?” King Gu Yi’s expression turned grave, “The Star Moon Tower gets harder as one goes higher. Moreover, there is a great threshold between the third and fourth level. The Ancient God shadows of the past three levels only possess the fighting capabilities of a Stage One Six-star Ancient God. However, the Ancient God shadow of the fourth level is a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God.”

“Guard of the fourth level, kill this little kid at the fourth level!”

“Understood,” someone from the sacrificial altar replied immediately.
