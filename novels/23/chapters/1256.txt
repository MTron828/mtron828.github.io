Chapter 1257: Universe God Chen

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked to see that his Spell of Disturbance was broken by Universe God Chen easily.

Since the Spell of Disturbance was created, it had never be broken and at most completely resisted, unless the opponent was much stronger than him.

Now, Universe God Chen broke it with the power of an ordinary Universe Master. What was more, he did not even use his sword.

“Three Waves!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned chilly, but he showed no anxiety. As the Spell of Disturbance was broken, he wielded the Blood Mountain Sword swiftly.

Universe God Chen blocked the three sword lights easily as well.

“This is not enough for me to pull out the sword. Show all your strength!” Universe God Chen shouted in a low voice.

Hearing his words, Jian Wushuang stopped hesitating.

“Stroke of Dawn!”

BUZZ!

The world darkened suddenly, and in the endless darkness, a ray of light suddenly appeared.

It was a sword light, but it was stunning like the first light before dawn!

Also, it exploded with a terrifying power.

Universe God Fei Yu’s eyes were alight with surprise by the sword light. He saw that this strike had reached the level of unique skills.

Universe God Chen also smiled. “That’s more like it!”

As he finished speaking, he turned his hand and conjured a scarlet longsword.

Then, Universe God Chen lightly waved his sword. It sent a very slight blow, causing no wave in the void. However, when the sword light fell, the light in the endless darkness was gone.

Jian Wushuang was forced to take several steps back violently, each step leaving a big pit on the ground.

Fortunately, the land of the Dayu World was far more stable than that of the Eternal World, the Green Fire World and the vast Void outside the land. In addition, both of them deliberately controlled their forces, so they did not bring much damage to the recruitment office.

“He’s so formidable!”

After regaining footing, Jian Wushuang looked up at Universe God Chen and felt his heart tense.

“My Stroke of Dawn is a unique skill, but it seemed so weak that it was broken by Universe God Chen with a single blow. His understanding of swordsmanship is obviously far deeper than mine,”?Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart.

At this moment, Universe God Chen also looked at him and said, “Jian Wushuang, any other skills? The strike just barely made me pull my sword, but it is not powerful enough to let me perform my swordsmanship.”

“Again!”

There was a hint of excitement in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Although he was defeated, he was not discouraged at all, but raised his Blood Mountain Sword again.

Crash!

The sword light swept out again.

This time, Jian Wushuang displayed the second move he created, the Nirvana!

“Oh?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When the dazzling sword light, which seemed to carry infinite hope and vitality, emerged, Universe God Chen’s eyes too were alight.

“This strike is good. I can display my swordsmanship now.”

Universe God Chen smiled faintly. Then his wrist twisted in a weird way, and a scarlet sword light swept like a fan.

Bang!

The two sword lights collided. As a result, Jian Wushuang was defeated again.

Since Universe God Chen had always controlled his strength, this blow did not bring Jian Wushuang more damage after he was defeated.

A silence hung over the recruitment office.

“Jian Wushuang, that’s all.”

Universe God Fei Yu said and came forward.

Thus, Jian Wushuang and Universe God Chen stopped.

“Brother Chen, how is he?” Universe God Fei Yu asked and looked at Universe God Chen, smiling.

“Very good. Although his force is not outstanding, only at the level of the ordinary Universe Master, his swordsmanship is good. He has created two kinds of unique skills, and the last unique skill he displayed has reached the higher level of Rank One. In terms of battle strength, he is definitely an Invincible Universe Master. If his force can be stronger, he will be an extremely terrifying Invincible Universe Master,” Universe God Chen concluded with a smile.

Jian Wushuang did not show any emotion when he heard this, but he felt weird in the heart.

Universe God Chen thought that he had gone all out, but in fact, when he knew that Universe God Chen deliberately suppressed his power and only used the power of the ordinary Universe Master, he also deliberately suppressed his power.

He was an Inverse Cultivator, and his body had been integrated with the strongest three Sword Principles. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was the Four-star Imperial God at the top level.

In terms of force, he was more than 10 times more powerful than an ordinary Universe Master. However, he had just been suppressing his force and did not use the power of Blood-killing Plate Armor.

As a result, Universe God Chen thought his force was at the level of the ordinary Universe Master.

As for the unique skill that Universe God Chen mentioned, it was true.

The unique skills of Universe Gods were divided according to the Three Heaven of Universe Gods, including Rank One to Rank Three.

In the two unique skills that Jian Wushuang created, the Stroke of Dawn was an elementary unique skill at Rank One, which was very common, and the Nirvana was an advanced unique skill at Rank One.

“Now that Universe God Chen thought you have the battle strength of the Invincible Universe Master, you have passed the verification. Jian Wushuang, from now on, you’re one of the Scarlet Island,” Universe God Fei Yu said.

“Thank you for your instruction, Universe God Chen, and thank you, Universe God Fei Yu,” Jian Wushuang thanked them. He did benefit a lot from the fight with Universe God Chen.

Universe God Fei Yu waved his hand and said, “The Scarlet Island is one of the Three Hegemons in the Dayu World, but there aren’t so many Invincible Universe Masters, and each of them occupy an important position. Jian Wushuang, you joined our Scarlet Island as an Invincible Universe Master, so we will arrange an appropriate position for you too.”

“Come with me.”

Then, Universe God Fei Yu and Universe God Chen led Jian Wushuang to that black castle in a corner of the city.

However, as soon as the three of them left, the recruitment office burst into turmoil.

“Is the Universe God who fought with Jian Wushuang Universe God Chen? He’s so formidable!”

“I heard that Universe God Chen is at the peak of the First Heaven, and he is in the top five on the Scarlet Island. Besides, his swordsmanship is much more excellent. Of course he is formidable.”

“Universe God Chen is formidable, but Jian Wushuang forced him to take out his sword and perform swordsmanship. Jian Wushuang is powerful too.”

“Jian Wushuang joined the Scarlet Island as an Invincible Universe Master. What position can he get?”

“The Invincible Universe Master on the Scarlet Island usually acts as a Supervisor or a Divine General. Jian Wushuang should also be a Supervisor.”

Many of the Universe Masters and Celestial Masters in the recruitment office chatted furiously.

For these people, Universe Gods were unattainable, and Invincible Universe Masters were big shots that they could only look up to.
