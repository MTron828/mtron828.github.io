Chapter 831: To Be One of the Royal Guard

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Clang!

The sound of metal on metal was heard.

The straight-faced Asura changed his expression when the two weapons collided together. He quivered and fell one step backward.

As for the black figure, he was not dead as others had expected. He wasn’t even injured, he had merely fallen several steps backward as well. After regaining his balance, he immediately rushed away to battle other experts.

“This man... actually managed to take my blow?”

Asura paused and looked toward the black figure with a frown.

The onlookers outside the battlefield were all shocked.

“Who is that guy?”

“He managed to take Asura’s blow and wasn’t even injured. He just fell a few steps backward?”

“Go find out who he is,” someone ordered.

The commanders from the 36 prefectures immediately started investigating.

A moment later, an expert came up to the commander of the Blood Hades Prefecture and reported to him, “Commander, the man is Blood Mountain, a Divine Realm expert in our prefecture.”

“Really? He is from our prefecture?”

The commander was startled at first but then showed a big smile. “Hah hah, it’s Blood Mountain from the Blood Hades Prefecture! Good Boy!”

“Blood Mountain from the Blood Hades Prefecture?”

“This Blood Mountain is indeed powerful. So far, he is the only one who has managed to take a strike from Asura without being killed. Given that, he is second only to Asura.”

“Well, he really has something. He has hidden his power to make himself look normal all this time. Until he encountered Asura, without whom, we would not have learned of the boy’s power.”

“We should have noticed him earlier. In this crazy battle, except for the extremely powerful experts like Asura, the rest have been busy fighting with others, always frustrated like drowned mice. However, this boy keeps his own pace and looks at ease all the time.”

“Yeah, I can see it now that you’ve pointed it out.”

The commanders chatted and laughed.

The black figure who had just taken Asura’s strike was none other than Jian Wushuang.

He had gone now to battle other experts, but he could not help glancing back at Asura.

“This man is powerful. Even I can’t defeat him unless I transform into an Ancient God,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself,?“Now that we’ve fought, the onlookers must have figured out that I’ve been restraining my power.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head and stopped pondering over it.

He wanted to avoid attracting too many eyes. He did not want to be spotted by the Xia Clan.

But he was not too worried. Aside from the selection of the Royal Guard, he had not participated in any other public activities, plus he had used an alias. The Xia Clan would not find him yet. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The wild battle had been going on for almost an hour, and the experts on the battlefield were becoming fewer and fewer.

When there were a thousand experts left in the Restriction, the beautiful lady’s voice echoed.

“Everybody stop fighting now!”

The voice resounded like thunder.

The experts stopped fighting when they heard the voice.

The Restriction covering the place slowly disappeared, and the remaining one thousand experts walked out of the battlefield.

Among them, a few appeared to be okay, but most looked embarrassed and were panting heavily, as if they almost could not have made it to the end.

Jian Wushuang was among the former.

“This man...”

Asura could not help looking toward Jian Wushuang with his arms crossed over his chest, furrowing his eyebrows slightly.

He was impressed by him, the only person who had managed to take his blow on the battlefield.

In view of this, he thought Jian Wushuang was extraordinarily powerful, almost at the same level as him.

“The one thousand people who have made it to the end can join the Royal Guard. As for the rest, you can return home now.” The lady’s voice echoed again.

The experts who had failed felt bitter about their results, but there was nothing they could do about it.

Some of them could have passed the round, but due to bad luck, they had encountered more powerful opponents or been besieged and lost the battle.

The Royal Guard showed them no mercy.

To join the Royal Guard, one had to be powerful first, then, smart. Luck also counted.

Those who were powerful enough to join the Royal Guard but failed only had themselves to blame.

“Commanders, please give me the details on the experts from your prefectures who passed the test and take the failed men back.” The lady looked at the commanders as she spoke.

The commanders exchanged looks before doing what they were told.

After they left, the campsite became cold and quiet.

The lady waved her hand and brought out several pieces of golden armor. Each piece had the Golden-dragon Mark on it.

The armor looked exactly the same as what the soldiers of the Royal Guard wore. In fact, there were two types of gold armor—inner armor and outer armor.

“From this moment on, you are members of the Royal Guard,”?the lady said in an icy voice. “This is your armor. Whether you’re carrying on a mission outside or inside the camp, you must wear it at all times. This is a regulation.”

“The armor is specially made and can protect you to some extent,” the lady continued. “You can change its size if you want. Now, each of you can come here to receive your armor.”

The one thousand experts who had passed went over to receive their armor.

Jian Wushuang was no exception. When he received his armor, he found it was, in fact, a treasure and that he had to bind it before putting on it.
