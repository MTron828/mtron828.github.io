Chapter 514: The Assessment

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I heard from my father that Emperor Fengxiao has a high rank among the 108 Divine Emperors. He’s at the peak and he’s even stronger than my father.”

“It’s definitely a great opportunity. I might become the disciple of such a powerful Divine Emperor!”

Thinking of this, the red-haired young man clenched his fists tightly as a flash of burning desire appeared in his eyes.

Among all the experts, only Jian Wushuang remained calm.

Since he had just arrived on the Monster Continent, he had never heard of Emperor Fengxiao. However, since the latter was one of the 108 Divine Emperors, he must have entered the Dao and would definitely overpower Jian Wushuang.

“Anyway, I’ll call your names one by one according to the application order,” the purple-robed man said as he took out the list.

“The first one, He Cang!”

He Cang immediately stepped forward and entered the tunnel on the side, then headed directly towards the Gladiator Arena.

The rest waited quietly in the open space.

After a while, they heard loud roaring sounds from the Gladiator Arena. The extremely fierce sounds indicated that He Cang was in a tough battle.

It didn’t take long for He Cang to return along the tunnel and reappear in front of them. He was wounded and his furrowed eyebrows revealed an obvious trace of sorrow. He was apparently worried about whether he would pass the assessment.

The result would not be announced until everyone finished the assessment, so he had to wait quietly.

“Next...” the purple-robed middle-aged man called the second expert’s name.

The experts stepped into the Gladiator Arena one after another after traveling to the end of the tunnel. It wasn’t long until the name of the red-haired young man who stood on the edge of the open space was called. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Jin Ling,” the middle-aged man called out.

The red-haired young man walked to the Gladiator Arena.

He created a larger disturbance in the Gladiator Arena, and also stayed in there longer.

After a quarter of an hour or so, he returned to the open space. With the arrogant expression still on his face, he looked around at the crowd with a hint of disdain.

“He must be extremely confident of his strength,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Several more experts entered Gladiator Arena before Jian Wushuang’s name was finally called.

“The last one, Jian Wushuang,” the purple-robed middle-aged man said.

Jian Wushuang immediately walked towards the Gladiator Arena at the end of the tunnel.

A moment later, he finally arrived at the Gladiator Arena.

The huge Gladiator Arena was encircled by a Restriction, with rows of stands around it, but no one seemed to be watching.

“I wonder who my opponent is,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Suddenly, three giant beasts slowly walked out from three tunnels near the edge of the Gladiator Arena.

“They’re... Demonic Beasts?” Jian Wushuang observed the three giant beasts in surprise.

They were all three-meter-tall Demonic Apes with four arms.

“No. They have no vitality. Are they Puppet Fighters? Demonic Beast Puppet Fighters?”?Jian Wushuang was stunned.

In the Divine Land, he had seen a lot of Puppet Fighters, but they were human-like. He had never seen Demonic Beast Puppet Fighters before.

“My opponents are these three Demonic Beast Puppet Fighters?”

Jian Wushuang thought with a serious expression on his face.

The three Demonic Beast Puppet Fighters encircled Jian Wushuang in a triangle shape and then directly began to attack him.

“Howl!”

They roared simultaneously and then trod the ground heavily, causing the ground to tremble violently. Fortunately, the ground was paved with extremely hard stone slates, which were not easily cracked.

Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

Three strong wind-breaking sound came from each side. The 12 fists of the three Puppet Fighters were tightly clenched and punched Jian Wushuang like landslides and tsunami.

Jian Wushuang felt like he was surrounded by fists in all directions. He immediately moved, leaving behind a residual shadow as he bounced towards the Puppet Fighters in a flexible manner. He then punched one of the Puppet Fighters with his tightly clenched right fist.

He used the full extent of his physical strength, striking the Puppet Fighter with a fierce blow that seemed almost like a meteorite.

Bang!

The Puppet Fighter was immediately knocked back, slamming into the stone wall at the edge of the Gladiator Arena and causing a violent impact.

“Get out!”

Jian Wushuang then punched the other two Puppet Fighters and knocked them backwards without effort as well.

In a blink of an eye, he had defeated the three Demonic Beast Puppet Fighters.

“They’re not very strong,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He could tell that the three Puppet Fighters were equal to superior lords with a stronger body. They were comparable to Wu Yuan, the leader of the Wu Yan Tribe. It should not be difficult for any Seven-cloud Realm Human Warrior to defeat them.

“The assessment shouldn’t be so simple,”?he thought.

As he expected, after the three defeated Puppet Fighters left the Gladiator Arena, a brand new Puppet Fighter immediately stood in front of him.

It was over two meters high, but it was shorter than the Demonic Ape Puppet Fighters and much stronger. It had a lion head, greenish black scales that covered its body, and a three-meter-long tail, which was also covered with scales.

‘Is this the original look of the Demonic Beast?”?Jian Wushuang looked at it with a curious expression.

He had only seen spirit beasts in the Divine Land, which were totally different from the Demonic Beasts in the Monster Continent.

The Demonic Beasts carried some human characteristics to a certain extent.

The Demonic Lion Puppet Fighter also began to attack. It was much stronger than the three Puppet Fighter, and its speed was quite astonishing.

Jian Wushuang only caught a flash of a greenish black spectral image. The next moment, he heard a harsh explosion in front of him as the Puppet Fighter split the air, slashing towards him with its sharp claws while opening its big mouth.

“Howl!”

A roar, accompanied by a strong sound wave, stormed toward Jian Wushuang.
