Chapter 1490: Defeat

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The originally noisy voice suddenly turned deadly quiet.

It was dead silent.

There were more than a million cultivators spectating Heavenly Fire Summit. Every one of them was surprised at the sight.

“How could he?” Hu Feng stood there with his eyes wide opened.

As for Ling Dan himself, he was dumbfounded too.

Three moves!

From when Jian Wushuang had started taking action until then, he had only made three moves. In a short time, like the blink of an eye.

Ling Dan spurted blood and retreated.

What did it mean?

“Ling Dan, you lost!”

Jian Wushuang held his sword with one hand as he towered in the void and he looked at Ling Dan.

“Lost?”

“What kind of joke is that!”

“I was merely careless and you seized the opportunity. You think you’re stronger than I am? That’s a joke!”

Ling Dan’s face was distorted in agony and his gaze towards Jian Wushuang was cold. As he bellowed, there was a terrifying aura that his body gave out.

“Jian Wushuang, die!”

Ling Dan’s figure turned illusionary as he took action again. This time, his action brought about a terrifying murderous intention, just like a furious beast with raging anger.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew cold as he saw the sight.

Ling Dan was already defeated, but he didn’t accept failure. He wanted to fight again.

“Humph!”

A cold harumph and Jian Wushuang took a step forward. The moment he took a step, Blood Mountain Sword in his hand let an imposing sword intention and suddenly swung out.

“Ninth Heaven Stroke!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hong!

A boundless sword intention soared out of Ninth Heaven and a huge, towering sword shadow suddenly appeared in the void out of nowhere.

The sword shadow brought along sword intention. Just like Nemesis Sword, it struck at Ling Dan like lightning.

At the same time, the secret skill from the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor that Jian Wushuang was wearing was triggered and Jian Wushuang’s power was instantly pushed to a brand new, explosive level!

Earlier, when Jian Wushuang had been fighting against Ling Dan, he didn’t trigger the secret skill of Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor.

But then…

Bang!

A low thud and in the instance, the surrounding void shattered into pieces from the force.

A terrifying divine power storm swept out. From such divine power storm, a crimson figure that was covered in fresh blood suddenly plunged out.

Everyone could see clearly that the explosion was from Ling Dan.

Then, Ling Dan’s aura was extremely weak and he was just like a dead dog when he was slammed back at Heavenly Fire Summit.

Rumble. Heavenly Fire Summit was instantly pierced while Ling Dan fell under a ruin. He didn’t move an inch and no one knew if he was dead or alive.

In the middle of the battlefield, the divine power storm gradually dispersed and revealed Jian Wushuang’s figure.

“Such an idiot!”

Jian Wushuang glared at the ruin where Ling Dan was as his anger soared to the air.

It was deadly quiet in Heavenly Fire Summit!

Dead silent.

If they were to say that Jian Wushuang had severely injured Ling Dan three moves earlier, it might be Ling Dan who was careless.

But then… merely with one stroke!

Ling Dan had obviously gone all out. However, with one stroke, no one knew if he was dead or alive. He was in an even more pathetic state than before.

What was going on?

The people on the scene were not fools. They could see clearly.

“One stroke and he defeated Ling Dan?”

“This Jian Wushuang is so strong?”

“The funniest part is that Ling Dan regarded himself as infallible. He said that he was careless but now he has been defeated by one stroke.”

“Too strong. This Jian Wushuang is too strong!”

Countless exclamation was heard in the air. The millions of cultivators surrounding Heavenly Fire Summit were in unprecedented shock.

Hu Feng who was not far behind Jian Wushuang had his eyes wide opened. He couldn’t believe the sight before him.

While Elder Qiu who was next to Hu Feng clenched her fists tight as her eyes beamed with joy.

In the universe, everyone’s focus was on Jian Wushuang.

Right then, Jian Wushuang’s figure suddenly became illusionary. When he reappeared, he was already before Seven Planet Palace Master.

“Seven Planet Palace Master!”

A bright, loud voice was heard from Jian Wushuang and it reverberated through the entire void.

“Seven Planet Palace Master is definitely involved in this. So… fight!” Jian Wushuang pointed at Seven Planet Palace Master with his sword.

Suddenly, the entire universe was in shock.

“This Jian Wushuang challenged Seven Planet Palace Master after he had defeated Ling Dan?”

“Seven Planet Palace Master, he is a true Real God expert!”

“This Jian Wushuang, he wants… He wants to challenge Real God?”

Stunned!

Everyone was stunned.

Seven Planet Palace Master was stunned on the spot too.

“I, I…” Seven Planet Palace Master stuttered and he then explained, “Jian Wushuang, this is a misunderstanding. Our Seven Planet Palace never once thought of provoking Lineage of Star, nor do we have the guts or capability to do so.”

“You save your bullshit to explain yourself to the higher-ups in Lineage of Star. Now, you have two options before you. Either you give your all and defeat me or… or I’ll kill you and exterminate Seven Planet Palace. You can make your own decision,” Jian Wushuang sounded cold.

On the way there, Jian Wushuang had thought clearly.

He fought to save Lineage of Star’s reputation. However, Hall Master Yuan also told him to display his power.

As he had already decided to display his power, he might as well make a scene.

So what if he defeated Ling Dan.

His goal was Seven Planet Palace Master!

He wanted to… challenge a Real God!

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, the Seven Planet Palace Master’s face grew grave.

“Seven Planet Palace Master, as you’re not moving, I will not be courteous.”

Jian Wushuang said and his figure immediately turned illusionary.

Wow!

A sword shadow suddenly wrecked havoc next to Seven Planet Palace Master and slashed towards Seven Planet Palace Master’s head.

Seven Planet Palace Master’s face changed and he moved backwards to dodge the sword light.

Then, Jian Wushuang dashed forward and lifted the tip of Blood Mountain Sword in his hand. In the void before him, there were three crimson snowflakes.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The three sword lights aimed in between Seven Planet Palace Master’s eyebrows, throat and his heart at the same time. Every angle was extremely critical.

Seven Planet Palace Master moved his body and made a narrow escape from the three sword lights.

“Seven Planet Palace Master, why aren’t you moving?”

Jian Wushuang wielded his sword again as he roared.

“If you do not try your best to kill me, I will kill you without hesitation!”

“You, have no choice!”

Jian Wushuang’s roar reverberated in Seven Planet Palace Master’s ears and his face grew grave. Then, there was madness that flashed through his eyes.

Rumble!!!

Boundless aura that only a Real God expert could give out exploded from Seven Planet Palace Master’s body.

Seven Planet Palace Master finally wanted to fight back.

Looking at the scene, Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened.
