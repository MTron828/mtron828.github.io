“Oh yeah, Sir God Bei Han…”

Hall Master Yuan suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang, “Palace Master, Sir God Bei Han has stayed in Lineage of Star for quite some time. He knew quite a bit about Lineage of Star, especially the experts that we invited to Lineage of Star in recent years. Now that he has left Lineage of Star, if he were to spread the news, it would inevitably put Lineage of Star at a disadvantage.”

“Mm, I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

The forces and experts in Sanctuary Alliance knew that Lineage of Star were inviting solo experts to join them in recent years by offering benefits and they knew that many solo experts had agreed.

However, the forces didn’t know who those solo experts were and how many there were.

That information would put Lineage of Star at an advantage in the upcoming war.

It would naturally be best not to announce it to the public.

“Don’t worry about it. Sir God Bei Han doesn’t stand a chance. When he opted to leave Lineage of Star, I told Jian Yi to follow him,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Jian Yi?” Hall Master Yuan was stunned.

Jian Yi, a hidden fighting power of Peak Emperor God in Lineage of Star!

Jian Wushuang obviously had considered that long ago, so he had sent Jian Yi to take care of it.

…

In Lineage of Star, outside the boundless Universe Galaxy, Sir God Bei Han in a black robe had just walked out from Universe Galaxy.

In the void, Sir God Bei Han stole a glance at Universe Galaxy behind him and there was rage in his gaze.

“Humph, Jian Wushuang, you are not willing to pass me the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace now, right? Very well, I shall head to the major forces that harbor deep-seated grudges against Lineage of Star now!”

“I’ll head to Soaring Heaven King Palace, Divine King Island, Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion. With my power and the information about Lineage of Star that I know, it will be easy to join any of those forces. Plus, the few major forces will definitely take action to exterminate Lineage of Star. Wait until Lineage of Star is exterminated, then I will receive the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace as well.

“Plus… joining these major forces is much steadier than joining Lineage of Star.”

Sir God Bie Han scoffed.

From his viewpoint, Lineage of Star lost the Master of Star Palace to be in a commanding position and all forces would definitely swarm in. Lineage of Star wouldn’t be able to withstand it and they would only be left with one outcome, extermination.

Previously, he had agreed with Lineage of Star because he wanted to seize a chance to get Secret Skill of Star Palace. As for fighting for Lineage of Star, he would contribute but the moment there was a danger, he would definitely run without hesitation.

However, he never expected that he would argue with Jian Wushuang in Lineage of Star before the war had even started.

“Jian Wushuang, just you wait. I’ll make you regret it!”

Sir God Bei Han’s gaze was cold and he didn’t hesitate about Lineage of Star behind him. He immediately moved forward to the vast void.

However, he had just left Universe Galaxy and plunged forward in the void for less than fifteen minutes when there was an evil-looking figure that blocked his way.

Sir God Bei Han’s face changed and his body immediately stopped.

“Who are you?” Sir God Bei Han looked solemn as he fixed his eyes upon the evil-looking figure. Although he didn’t give out any aura, Sir God Bei Han’s gut feeling told him that the person was strong.

“Your death!”

Jian Yi didn’t talk anymore but he moved his figure ghostly and came behind Sir God Bei Han.

Too fast!

It was so fast that Sir God Bei Han didn’t manage to react at all.

“So strong?”

Sir God Bei Han looked on in disbelief.

Jian Yi took action and his speed itself revealed how scary Jian Yi was.

Such terrifying speed, there was almost no one among the experts that he knew that could be compared favorably.

His power was far beyond his imagination.

Such a scary expert, why would he appear here and want to kill him?

He had never offended any expert like him.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s Jian Wushuang!!”

Sir God Bei Han stared and he had already guessed who had sent the scary expert.

“How is it possible? How did Lineage of Star hide such a scary expert?” Sir God Bei Han looked on in disbelief.

Jian Yi’s hoary hand with boundless power grabbed his throat.

Sir God Bei Han roared madly from the bottom of his heart but he couldn’t struggle at all. The hoary hand grabbed his throat and Jian Yi exerted strength in his grip. Then, Sir God Bei Han’s head cracked and his vigor was instantly interrupted.

He killed Sir God Bei Han directly. Jian Yi took care of Sir God Bei Han’s dead body and took his Qian Kun ring. Then, he turned to head back to Lineage of Star.

Lineage of Star, in a lofty palace.

Jian Wushuang didn’t wait long until Jian Yi appeared in front of him.

“Master, Sir God Bei Han died,” Jian Yi looked cold and there was passion in his eyes when he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Well done,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and he was satisfied.

After Jian Yi had left Green Fire World, his power had already recovered to the level of Middle Stage Chaotic Realm.

In recent years, when Jian Wushuang had fought and massacred outside, Jian Yi had never joined. He had been using an enormous amount of resources to recover his power.

Then, Jian Yi’s power had recovered to the peak of Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. He was only one step away from Peak Chaotic Realm.

One should know that Jian Yi was an ancient expert. At his strongest, he was at the peak of Chaotic Realm. The techniques and skills that he had on hand weren’t comparable to Emperor Gods from the second era. His fighting power then was so strong that even Jian Wushuang found it unbelievable.

Merely as a conservative assumption, Jian Wushuang reckoned Jian Yi should be able to match evenly with the number one Emperor God in Eternal Chaotic World, Underworld God.

“The Master of Star Palace’s death is verified. There must be rising winds and scudding clouds in the outside world. At such a crucial moment, there’s a person that I have to see,” Jian Wushuang said.

The other three Hall Masters exchanged a look and nodded.

They could guess who Jian Wushuang wanted to see.

In Purple Moon Sanctuary, a beautifully enchanting lake. The lake water was purple.

At night, the moon reflected on the lake and formed a huge purple moon. Its name, Purple Moon Lake, derived from it.

In the middle of Purple Moon Lake, there was a small island.

Although the island wasn’t huge, everyone knew that the island possessed an absolute ruling power over Purple Moon Lake.

As the purple moon hung low, the entire island looked even more captivating.

At the border of the island, a red-robed elderly was waiting patiently.

The red-robed elderly’s aura was strong and he was a Sir God expert. However, the Sir God had been waiting on the island for one thousand and eight hundred years and the master of the island had yet to see him.
