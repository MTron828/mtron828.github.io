After handing the Mountain River Map, before Jian Wushuang could speak, Xuan Yi once again took out a token.

“This is for you too.” Xuan Yi said.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang looked at the token doubtfully.

“The token contains a technique you’ve cultivated, which is the Univeral Dao Scripture!” Xuan Yi smiled. “But now I’ll give you the second volume of the Univeral Dao Scripture.”

“The second volume?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

At that time, Xuan Yi gave him the Univeral Dao Scripture, and later he knew that the Univeral Dao Scripture enhanced one’s consciousness intensity.

This kind of technique was precious even in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Now, Xuan Yi offered him the second volume of the Univeral Dao Scripture.

“The first volume of the Univeral Dao Scripture improves the consciousness, while the second one enhances the soul.” Xuan Yi smiled.

“What?” Jian Wushaung was shocked.

“Improve the Soul Power!” Gu King inside Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

If the method of improving the consciousness was considered extremely precious in the Eternal Chaotic World, then the method of elevating the Soul Power was a true treasure. After all, the level of the Strength of Soul was too high.

These methods had always been only available to experts like the founder of the Star Bloodline and King Luo Zhen.

It was really a valuable technique.

However now, Xuan Yi was giving such a technique to Jian Wushuang?

“I still have a Formation too.” Xuan Yi took out a Jade Slip. “It is for the Green Fire World.”

“A Formation?” Jian Wushuang looked at Xuan Yi in doubt.

“The Green Fire World is in a very unique position. Although it has already defeated one Jin Kingdom, there might be more foreign powers similar to or even stronger than the Jin Kingdom. By then, your Green Fire World will surely become engaged again.” Xuan Yi said.

Jian Wushuang fell silent.

Since the Green Fire World came into existence, three batches of experts were born. The fourth batch of experts would soon come into being in the future.

“I give you this Formation, and then you need to pass it to Palace Master Yun who is good at setting up Formations. With his knowledge of Formation and the Formation instructions, he will set it up!”

“Once the Formation is formed, it will keep the Green Fire World safe forever.” Xuan Yi smiled.

Jian Wushuang squinted.

If Xuan Yi said the Formation could keep the Green Fire World safe and sound, the Formation must be extraordinary.

“I have been in the Green Fire World for a long time. I have never done anything for it. Now I’ll leave this Formation to make up for my neglect.” Xuan Yi smiled. “If the Green Fire World is safe and sound, you will have nothing to worry about. In the future, you can enter and venture into the Eternal Chaotic World at will.”

Hearing Xuan Yi, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

In the future, he was bound to enter the Eternal Chaotic World.

Whether it was for Leng Rushuang or for himself, he had to go to the Eternal Chaotic World.

But if the Green Fire World was in danger, he would worry about it even when he was venturing into the Eternal Chaotic World.

If Xuan Yi’s Formation could keep the Green Fire World safe and sound, Xuan Yi would help him a lot.

“Master!”

Jian Wushuang clasped his hands and looked at Xuan Yi, his face reddish.

He saw Xuan Yi’s condition, but even if Xuan Yi was in such a condition, he was still thinking for his disciple.

He gave him the second volume of the Univeral Dao Scripture, and the Formation to protect his home and family.

Xuan Yi had been helping him all the time.

However, Xuan Yi never asked for anything in return.

He had never.

Even at this moment, he did not have any last wish.

This kindness…

Flop!

Jian Wushuang knelt down.

“I will always remember your kindness!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice quavered as he respectfully kowtowed to Xuan Yi.

Xuan Yi just watched him kowtow three times. He slowly waved. “Get up.”

Jian Wushuang got up.

“I’ve received four disciples. You’re the most talented and I anticipate your future the most. I hope to see you grow.”

“By now, I’ve done everything I can. In the next years, you can only rely on yourself!”

“Work hard, maybe one day, you and me, we’ll see each other again.”

Xuan Yi’s voice still sounded calm, his face still smiling. When his voice died down completely, his body slowly became transparent. His figure was getting more and more transparent and eventually disappeared completely.

Jian Wushuang stood there with his hands clenched. As Xuan Yi’s body gradually disappeared, he was sick at heart.

“Jian Wushuang, you don’t have to be sad. If I didn’t guess wrong, your master has always existed in this special way. He’s not a doppelganger or a fragment of consciousness, but an inexplicable matter.” Gu King’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s ears.

“He has always existed in this state, and he must have his own reason. Although he has disappeared now, it does not mean that he really died.”

“As he said, maybe one day, you two will meet each other again.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He knew that his master’s words were meaningful.

“Master had great knowledge of weapon refining, Formation, and elixirs. His knowledge didn’t belong in the Green Fire World. He must come from outside the Green Fire World!

“He must come from somewhere extraordinary.

“But over the years, he has always existed in the Green Fire World in an incomparably unique state. He must have his reason. I just can’t find out.

“He educated me and three Senior Brothers but never asked for anything from us. Even before he disappeared, he never asked me anything.”

Jian Wushuang murmured and muttered as he shook his head.

His master had always been mysterious.

From the moment Xuan Yi received Jian Wushuang as his disciple, Xuan Yi had always been mysterious.

Even when he “disappeared”, Jian Wushuang still found him mysterious.

Because from the beginning to the end, Jian Wushuang never knew Xuan Yi’s background and purpose.

“Perhaps, when I am strong enough to be at the master’s level, I will know.”

“Strength!!! ”

Standing in the front of the Void where Xuan Yi “disappeared”, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with excitement.
