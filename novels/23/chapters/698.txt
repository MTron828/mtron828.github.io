Chapter 699: The Fifth Level of Occult

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The experts and disciples from the various sects waited quietly in the sky above the ancient forest. After some time, a bunch of experts from the three magnates began to jointly do something on the void.

“What are they doing?” Jian Wushuang and the other disciples were puzzled.

“They’re opening up the wormhole that leads to the Eternal Zone.”

Vice Palace Master Ling Yu explained, “The Eternal Zone may be hidden within this ancient forest, but it’s an isolated space which, although rather stable, would weaken once every 100 years. When this happens, a few Eternal Realm experts working together will be able to force an opening into it.”

“However, a forced opening won’t be too stable, and as such, y’all will appear in random places throughout the Eternal Zone when you enter. In other words, y’all will be separated in the Eternal Zone and will have to find your own way around.”

“What’s more, y’all can only remain in the Eternal Zone for up to 10 days. By the 10th day, y’all must have reached the border of the Eternal Zone, where there’ll naturally be a way to get all of you out.”

“Is that really so?” Jian Wushuang and co. nodded inwardly.

The Eternal Zone opened only once every 100 years, and each time it did was only for 10 days.

To everyone who was present, a period of 10 days was certainly way too short. This opportunity was indeed hard to come by.

“Do we really have to move around on our own?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

“Also, remember never to enter the inner layer.” Vice Palace Master Ling Yu exhorted once more. “The inner layer is the Demon God Clan’s lair, where there’re untold dangers. Even an Eternal Realm expert of my ilk will have to be very careful there, for the slightest of carelessness will be one’s downfall. For those of you who are only Divine Realm experts, entering the inner layer will spell certain death.”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang and co. nodded.

They knew that only Eternal Realm experts were qualified enough to enter the inner layer, and even then, said experts would be courting death by entering such an incomparably dangerous place.

Under the joint efforts of the Eternal Realm experts, two wormholes appeared above the Void before long.

Of these two wormholes, one led to the outer layer of the Eternal Zone, while the other led directly to the inner layer.

“The wormholes have been fully created. Let’s head in, and please take care of yourselves for the next 10 days,” Palace Master Destruction said as he looked all around.

The many experts of the Ancient Sect, including Jian Wushuang and the other five disciples, nodded and immediately headed toward the two wormholes.

The people from the other top sects and the three magnates too made their way toward the two wormholes.

The Eternal Realm experts stepped into the wormhole that led to the inner layer while the Divine Realm disciples stepped into the wormhole that led to the outer layer.

In quick succession, figure after figure disappeared into the wormholes.

Among Cloud Sea Asgard’s contingent, the disciples were the last to enter the wormholes.

Before entering, Wu Dao, who was first in line among them, even specially exhorted, “All of you, please don’t forget your mission after entering the Eternal Zone.”

The disciples of Cloud Sea Asgard nodded repeatedly upon hearing this.

Gong Chaos pupils constricted a little, but he too nodded.

Soon, the experts and disciples from the nine top sects and the three magnates had all crossed into the Eternal Zone.

This was an ancient forest which emitted an ancient aura. Towering old trees, which were more than 1000 feet in height, were aplenty in the depths of the forest. A pale white smoke also pervaded the entire forest.

This white smoke was very rarefied and carried a delicate fragrance.

Standing on a branch atop a towering old tree was a young man dressed in a black robe and carrying a longsword. His eyes were looking around at his surroundings.

“Is this really the Eternal Zone?”

Jian Wushuang was muttering to himself, around whom were all kinds of large trees. He could sense that the Eternal Zone possessed an abundance of spiritual power that was not less, and perhaps even more, in amount than the outside world.

At the very end of his line of sight was a pale golden light which covered an extensive territory.

“Is that the inner layer over there?” He squinted his eyes.

The Eternal Zone was incomparably vast. It was said that the outer layer alone stretched tens of millions of miles, while the inner layer was even larger in surface area.

The many Divine Realm disciples who entered the Eternal Zone were, at this moment, scattered all over the outer layer. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“According to Vice Palace Master Ling Yu, the greatest danger in the Eternal Zone comes from those Demon Gods. They see humans as marauders and hate us like none other. What’s more, they have a special way to instantly differentiate their clansmen from human warriors.”

“I wonder how they look like and how strong they are.” Jian Wushuang murmured but quickly shook his head. “But aside from them, the threats I face here in the Eternal Zone also include the disciples from the other sects, especially Cloud Sea Asgard…”

“This time, Cloud Sea Asgard has sent no less than three elite Divine Realm disciples, among whom include the extremely powerful Wu Dao. I’m unable to deal with them based on my current strength, and should therefore find a way to increase my strength somewhat before I go find those Demon Gods.”

A radiance shone in Jian Wushuangs eyes.

In his present state, his cultivation of Sword Principle and Secret Skill could not be improved for the time being. However, his Dao understanding had lots of room for improvement.

When he set off from the Ancient Sect, his understanding of the World Dao and Slaughter Dao was only one step away from comprehending the fifth level of Occult. Subsequently, the fight with Gong Chao allowed him to find a glimmer of opportunity which made him feel as if he could gain comprehension of the fifth level of Occult at any time.

It should be known that there was an extremely huge gulf between comprehension of the fourth and fifth level of Occult.

“My strength will go up a level regardless of which Dao it is that I’m able to comprehend the fifth level of Occult of, and combined with my other skills, I’ll be able to stand toe-to-toe with even the elite Divine Realm experts. That’ll grant me the capability to compete against the three Divine Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard.” A solemn-faced Jian Wushuang finally came to a resolve.

He wasted no time finding a place in the forest where he could begin his cultivation.

The first thing that the other geniuses and disciples thought about upon entering the Eternal Zone was to seek out those Demon Gods and find a way to kill them for their Essence Blood. Instead, Jian Wushuang quickly began his cultivation upon entering.

This sort of cultivation only required two days of time.

By the time two days had passed, Jian Wushuang had made a breakthrough in his World Dao and fully comprehended its fifth level of Occult.
