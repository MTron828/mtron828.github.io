Chapter 2750: Handling the Treasures

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet made a move without any warnings.

It discharged a horrifying breath of aura before soon appearing in front of Yin Su’er using just one long stride and swiftly drew out a battle saber.

Yin Su’er’s eyes sank slightly as she lifted her jade-like hands. A spear appeared in her hands as she spun her spear around and thrust...

Clang!

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was instantly sent back into its original position when her spear and the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet collided.

Yin Su’er was slightly shaken up with traces of surprise in her eyes.

“A Peak Grand Ultimate God?” Yin Su’er’s beautiful eyes were frozen on the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet’s body.

“How do you feel, Fort Master?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Jian Yi, where did you get this corpse puppet?” Yin Su’er asked solemnly.

“Well, I don’t want to disclose how I got it but I wonder about your thoughts on it. Do you think this Gold-armored Corpse Puppet in my hands can compete with ordinary Peak Grand Ultimate God?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

Yin Su’er pondered for a moment and replied, “Yes, this corpse puppet is enough to fight against the ordinary Peak Grand Ultimate Go in a one-on-one duel. Even if I take a shot by myself, I’m probably capable of suppressing it with my strength.”

“That’s indeed the case. This Gold-armored Corpse Puppet is completely under my control. In addition, I also have a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets which are equivalent to one extremely powerful High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and two ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. Considering all of them and myself...I wonder if you think the Sword Alliance can change the situation within the Crimson Stone Fort?” Jian Wushuang explained with a wide grin.

“A Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet...” Yin Su’er narrowed her eyes to focus while deep in thought. She then nodded after a while. “If we have these corpse puppets helping us alongside my careful planning and execution, I think there may be a chance to succeed.”

“I don’t think many have found out about Saber Master’s death yet. I guess probably only a few of his faction’s henchmen might have found out about it but I’m sure they will try to keep the news to themselves so there shouldn’t be any chaos within the Crimson Stone Fort for now. Fort Master, you should have time to prepare,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Yin Su’er’s eyes lit up and she continued, “That’s right. However, the other top forces in Danyang Continent have also been eyeing the Crimson Stone Fort apart from the major factions who wanted to expand their influence within Crimson Stone Fort. I’m afraid those top forces won’t miss the chance to reap benefits if they notice Crimson Stone Fort is going through some major changes.”

“Fort Master, rest assured that I’ll be putting pressure on those top forces as much as possible during this period to distract them,” said Jian Wushuang reassuringly with a faint smile.

Jian Wushuang spoke after a momentary pause, “By the way, there’s one more matter I wish to discuss. I have a few treasures with me but unfortunately don’t have the right channels to sell them. Could you please help me with them, Fort Master?”

“What are those treasures?” Yin Su’er looked curiously at Jian Wushuang.

She gained a lot the last time Jian Wushuang gave her a Royal Blood Gem weighing 130 catties which helped relieve a fair bit of her pressure.

She wondered what good things Jian Wushuang would share with her at that moment.

“Fort Master, you should take a look at the battle armor I have first.” Jian Wushuang took out the tattered battle armor.

“This is...a Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure Battle Armor?” Yin Su’er was surprised before started shaking her head. “It seems powerful and perhaps considered top-tier among Pinnacle Heavenly Treasures, but it’s a pity this battle armor has been damaged with an exorbitant repair cost.”

“Jian Yi, are you going to exchange this battle armor for Divine Elixir Pills or the Primordial Stones?” Yin Su’er asked.

“Only Divine Elixir Pills,” replied Jian Wushuang. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Your battle armor is of an extremely high level. It’ll probably be worth seven to eight thousand Divine Elixir Pills if it’s in good condition. However, its value has probably halved now that it’s been badly damaged. I can get you at most three thousand Divine Elixir Pills,” explained Yin Su’er.

“Three thousand Divine Elixir Pills isn’t bad at all.” Jian Wushuang smiled before taking out something else.

He took out a saber and a crimson battle saber.

Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen were taken aback to see the crimson battle saber.

“Holy Treasure! It’s a Holy Treasure Battle Saber!”

“It’s a Holy Treasure?”

Even Yin Su’er was shocked when Jian Wushuang took out the Holy Treasure Battle Saber.

It was a Holy Treasure after all.

“Jian Yi, you have a Holy Treasure?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen stared wide-eyed at Jian Wushuang.

“I was lucky,” Jian Wushuang answered with a smile.

He was not lying as he was indeed lucky to be able to get so many treasures from the secret realm.

“This battle saber isn’t of much use to me. I wanted to let the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet use it but the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was only a corpse puppet after all and may not be able to utilize the Holy Treasure Battle Saber’s full potential, hence it has very limited room to improve its combat prowess. However, I do need a lot of Divine Elixir Pills to improve my cultivation realm so I need your help to take care of this battle saber for me.” Jian Wushuang explained his situation with a smile.

Yin Su’er could not help but feel overwhelmed when she heard Jian Wushuang.

A Holy Treasure... Even when Yin Su’er’s father—Crimson Stone Saint was alive, he had the opportunity to only come across one throughout his entire life which went missing upon his passing.

Therefore, there was no Holy Treasure in the Crimson Stone Fort at that instance. In other words, Yin Su’er did not have a Holy Treasure on hand.

However, did Jian Wushuang just casually took out a Holy Treasure and asked for her help to dispose of it?

“Jian Yi, this is a Holy Treasure after all. It’s not any ordinary piece of treasure. Are you sure you want to exchange it for Divine Elixir Pills?” Yin Su’er was puzzled.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, a treasure was of no value if he could not use it.

A treasure that was not usable was only a piece of useless ornament. It was better to exchange it for much-needed resources.

“I’ll find a way to sell your battle saber as soon as possible in that case,” said Yin Su’er.

“Do you know how many Divine Elixir Pills this battle saber can be exchanged for?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well... I haven’t handled a Holy Treasure weapon before, so I don’t know the specific price for it. However, it shouldn’t be difficult to sell for a few ten thousand Divine Elixir Pills,” said Yin Su’er.

“Fifty thousand Divine Elixir Pills. I need fifty thousand Divine Elixir Pills. I wonder if it’s possible?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Yin Su’er nodded.

Although she had no idea of the specific price of a Holy Treasure, it shouldn’t be difficult to sell it for 50,000 Divine Elixir Pills or more.

“That’s fine.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had previously accumulated a certain amount of divine power. If he could get his hands on 50,000 Divine Elixir Pills in addition to those Divine Elixir Pills he obtained from killing Saber Master and the other Grand Ultimate Gods, he should be able to make another cultivation realm breakthrough and cross over to the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm!
