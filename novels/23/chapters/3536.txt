Chapter 3537: Awe

“An absolute art at the peak of level six?” The surrounding Principles Masters were all shocked.

If Jian Wushuang’s creation of several initial level six absolute arts was only a surprise to them, then the creation of an absolute art at the peak of level six was enough to completely shock them.

This was because under normal circumstances, a peak stage six absolute art could not be created without the battle strength of the sixth realm of the void.

The power that Jian Wushuang displayed just now was only at the peak stage of the fifth realm of the void, but with this absolute art, he was probably not much weaker than an ordinary expert of the sixth realm of the void.

“This Blood Sword Master’s swordsmanship is really terrifying, and his other methods are also very brilliant. For example, the time and space domain that he displayed just now, as well as his strange escape skill, are even more amazing. With all these methods combined, his threat to ordinary Principles Masters is probably no less than that of an ordinary expert of the sixth realm of the void,” Eight Axe Master continued.

“However, the strange thing is that Blood Sword Master’s offensive magic weapon doesn’t seem to be very high-level. It’s not even a universe true treasure. If he can get an offensive magic weapon at the level of a universe true treasure, his combat power might be able to improve even further.”

Hearing Eight Axe Master’s words, the Principles Masters all secretly drew in a breath of cold air.

In their eyes, Jian Wushuang was already terrifying enough. Would he not be even more terrifying if he took another step forward?

“Eight Axe Master, thank you for informing us.” The void five-realm Principles Master cupped his hands and then turned to leave with the people around him.

The other Principles Masters knew that there was nothing to fight for, so they naturally left one after another.

In the end, only Eight Axe Master was still standing there.

“Blood Sword Master...” Eight Axe Master’s face was solemn, but his mind was full of thoughts. ‘I don’t know why, but I always feel that he didn’t use his full strength when he fought with me. Even when he used his ultimate skill at the peak of stage six, I still feel that he didn’t use his full strength. What’s going on?’

Eight Axe Master was a little confused.

In fact, his intuition was right. Although Jian Wushuang had shown many skills in the fight, his real battle strength had not been fully unleashed. He had never used the heaven-cleaving skill alone.

Once he used the heaven-cleaving skill, it was equivalent to an additional portion of his will power. His strength could crush Eight Axe Master in an instant. However, Jian Wushuang did not do that. Instead, he deliberately reserved his strength, the reason why he fought head-on with the Eight Axe Master was that Jian Wushuang wanted to use the Eight Axe Master to train his swordsmanship as much as possible.

After all, he had already taught an absolute art at the peak of level six.

Although he had gained enlightenment from the Heaven Ancestor’s axe and mastered the destructive will, he had created this absolute art, it meant that he had reached a new level in swordsmanship.

After reaching this level, he could also improve the seven sword moves in the Peerless Sword Manual.

Although these sword moves could not reach the peak of the sixth level like the ‘fight to the death’, they could still be improved to the advanced level of the sixth level.

Since he wanted to improve, he naturally needed to spend time and practice.

The Eight Axe Master was not weak, so his battle with him was undoubtedly a form of training for Jian Wushuang.

Unfortunately, the Eight Axe Master definitely did not know about this.

...

In the void outside the Black Thunder Pool, Jian Wushuang, the Heavy Master, the Saber Python Master, and the Purple Sound Master gathered together again.

However, at this moment, the Heavy Master, the Saber Python Master, and the Purple Sound Master looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of shock.

After all, they had seen with their own eyes that Jian Wushuang had snatched the Poluo God component from Eight Axe Master. Moreover, Jian Wushuang had fought with Eight Axe Master head-on, and most importantly, he had crushed Eight Axe Master.

Eight Axe Master was an expert at the peak of the fifth void realm. Moreover, he was very famous. How Strong was Jian Wushuang to be able to crush such an expert head-on?

“Heavy, didn’t you say that Blood Sword Master had just become a Principles Master not long ago? Where did you get the news?” Purple Sound Master looked at Heavy Master with some resentment.

“Just broke through? Are you kidding me? Blood Sword Master’s strength is not much weaker than an expert at the sixth void realm. How could he have just broken through?” Saber Python Master said directly.

“I, I...” Heavy Master was at a loss for words. Six hundred years ago, he had indeed seen that Jian Wushuang was only at the Immortal Saint Realm, but the battle strength that Jian Wushuang displayed today…it was definitely not something that a person who had just broken through to become a Principles Master could possess.

“Is it really as Marquis Duan Yu said, that when Heavenly Sword Marquis was at the Immortal Saint Realm, his strength was no less than mine?” Heavy Master muttered in his heart.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing next to the three of them, saw this scene and smiled. “There’s no point in talking about these things. All I need to do is get my hands on the Poluo God component.”

“Yes.” The Heavy Master nodded, but he was sure that he was looking at Jian Wushuang in a completely different way now.

In this world, no matter where they went, the experts would always be respected. These cultivators also respected the experts in their hearts.

Previously, although the Heavy Master no longer looked down on Jian Wushuang, and his relationship with Jian Wushuang had eased, it was mainly because of Jian Wushuang’s life-saving means and because Jian Wushuang had saved him, moreover, he was able to escape from the hands of God Fei safely.

It could be said that the Heavy Master had only been grateful to Jian Wushuang before, but he did not have any respect for him.

However, it was different now. The Heavy Master was completely in awe of Jian Wushuang now because he knew that Jian Wushuang was much stronger than him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was not only him, but also Saber Python Master and Purple Sound Master.

“Blood Sword Master, congratulations. That Poluo God component is a good thing.” Saber Python Master sighed softly.

“It is indeed a good item. However, the Poluo God component was obtained by the four of us together. Although I put in a little more effort, I can’t monopolize it. So, let’s discuss how to distribute it,” Jian Wushuang said.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Saber Python Master, Heavy Master, and Purple Sound Master were delighted.

Of course, they were full of desire for the Poluo God parts. However, because of Jian Wushuang’s strength, and because of his overwhelming strength, they had obtained the Poluo God parts in this competition, therefore, if Jian Wushuang did not mention the distribution, they would definitely not mention it.

But now that Jian Wushuang had taken the initiative to ask for it, they naturally wanted to share it. After all, they had contributed.
