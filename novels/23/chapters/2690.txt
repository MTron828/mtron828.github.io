Chapter 2691: As Easy As Breaking A Dead Branch Off A Tree

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Divine Sword Army consisted of 50 Heaven Ultimate Gods with each being the cream of the crop among Heaven Ultimate Gods. They were an army fighting against the Seven Absolute Palace experts in teams of five in an absolute advantage with the battle situation could be said to be leaning to one side.

The Seven Absolute Palace experts had lost their backbone and their will to fight following the Seven Absolute Palace Master’s death which immediately caused the situation to lean towards one side. Their failure was imminent and became as easy as breaking dry branches off a tree. The Seven Absolute Palace experts had completely lost their capabilities in resisting and could only be slaughtered by the Divine Sword Army.

“Whoever surrenders can avoid death and those who continue to resist will be killed without any hesitation!!” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice could be heard reverberating in the entire Golden Prison.

The Seven Absolute Palace experts were extremely happy when they heard his voice. a Huge number of the experts gave up resisting and directly surrendered in front of Jian Wushuang in the next moment. Most of the experts would choose to surrender without hesitation if their lives were at stake.

However, there were still a small number of stubborn experts who were naturally slaughtered by the Divine Sword Army.

The Divine Sword Army moved swiftly as the Seven Absolute Palace experts—apart from those who surrendered—were killed.

In this battle, Jian Wushuang had seen the Divine Sword Army’s combat prowess. The combat prowess unleashed by a team of five under the magic formation’s support was astonishing. Putting the divine power depletion aside, the fact that the attack damage they received was shared among those five people had caused none of the Divine Sword Army’s members to fall in the battle despite many Seven Absolute Palace experts having died.

“This is indeed a legion.” Jian Wushuang secretly gasped in admiration.

The combat strength between an expert legion set up with money and a team formed with the union of normal cultivators were different.

The 50-men Divine Sword Army alone was just a preliminary formation and many things were imperfect. The magic formation they used was slightly normal, but their combat power was still extremely strong. This caused Jian Wushuang to uncontrollably think about the first-ranked legion on the Danyang Continent—the Crimson Stone Official Army...

The Crimson Stone Official Army had a total of 1,000 Heaven Ultimate Gods during its peak with each of those Heaven Ultimate Gods being elites. They had a great many brave warriors while their military and magic formations are perfect. This was an extremely invincible legion under the personal leadership of the Crimson Stone Saint and his many other Heaven Ultimate Gods.

The Divine Sword Army was still very much weaker when compared to a legion of that level.

“Immediately send a message to inform Dong Xue that the Seven Absolute Temple has been conquered by us. Ask her to come over with some people to take over the Seven Absolute City and arrange a place for the Seven Absolute Palace experts to settle down. Make sure to use those who are useful,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Long Shan nodded and immediately sent a message to Dong Xue.

After that, Jian Wushuang and the Divine Sword Army only waited a day in the Seven Absolute City before Dong Xue rushed over with many Sword Alliance experts.

The Sword Alliance was originally the integration of two third-rated forces. However, there were many experts in the Sword Alliance at that moment due to the many resources which Jian Wushuang provided within that year on top of the fact they recruited many others. The Divine Sword Army alone had 50 Heaven Ultimate Gods with another 50 Heaven Ultimate Gods in the alliance. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

At this moment, Dong Xue had brought a group of the Heaven Ultimate Gods to meet up with Jian Wushuang.

“Alliance Master, this place is...” Dong Xue looked at the surroundings in surprise.

She had already guessed what happened here but she was still extremely surprised by it.

Jian Wushuang had hurried over with the Divine Sword Army and wiped out the Seven Absolute Palace without any preparations or discussions beforehand.

“I’ll leave the remaining steps for you to resolve as I have other matters needing my attention,” ordered Jian Wushuang before glancing over at Long Shan. “Long Shan, gather the Divine Sword Army. We’re leaving now.”

“We’re leaving now?” Long Shan was caught by surprise. “Alliance Master, where are we going this time?”

“Blood Water City,” said Jian Wushuang.

“The Blood Water Gang’s turf, Blood Water City? Alliance Master, do you plan to continue by making a move toward the Blood Water Gang?” Long Shan and Dong Xue widened their eyes.

Was his appetite not too huge for immediately making a move towards the Blood Water Gang after winning over the Seven Absolute Temple?

“I’m personally leading the Divine Sword Army this time. It’s also the Divine Sword Army’s first battle. How can we only take down one force—the Seven Absolute Temple? The Blood Water City isn’t too far from the Seven Absolute City. We can arrive there in half a day with our speed and the Blood Water Gang won’t be able to react under such circumstances.

“Follow me!” Jian Wushuang ordered without further explanation.

Many of the soldiers in the Divine Sword Army saw with their own eyes Jian Wushuang swiftly killing the Seven Absolute Temple Master. His strength naturally increased their obedience toward him and there were no hesitations when they heard Jian Wushuang’s orders. The Divine Sword Army immediately took action and headed for the Blood Water City.

The Blood Water Gang located in the Blood Water City was also one of the third-rated forces near the Sword Alliance. However, it was much weaker compared to the Seven Absolute Temple.

Although the Divine Sword Army had just experienced an intense battle against the Seven Absolute Temple, it did not suffer any huge losses and still contained its high combat prowess.

There was no need to mention Jian Wushuang who was definitely in good shape.

The same situation soon happened.

The place was also forcefully wiped out and fell apart like broken twigs, just like the Seven Absolute Temple.

A normal third-rated force with only a single Peak Heaven Ultimate God was unable to stop Jian Wushuang and his Divine Sword Army. The Blood Water Gang Master was killed by Jian Wushuang whilst his direct followers also died in the Divine Sword Army’s hands within 15 minutes. The remaining Blood Water Gang experts thereafter surrendered.

As a result, Jian Wushuang had also obtained the Blood Water Gang.

Dong Xue thought she was dreaming when she rushed to the Blood Water Gang with her subordinates and saw the situation there.

It had to be known that the previous Dragon Divine Gang had constantly suffered from conflicts against the other third-rated forces near them. However, those few forces were too close with each other such that it was difficult to create a huge crisis for the other parties. The reason Dragon Divine Gang got into their previous situation was because of the Dragon Divine Gang Master’s carelessness. He ended up being killed by the Purple Beast Alliance Master who found the opportunity to do so.

However, their new Alliance Master had swiftly taken down two third-rated forces within a mere two days—less than a year after the Sword Alliance was formed with means beyond what others could do.

“Alliance Master, shall we continue to the next force?” Long Shan asked as he stood beside Jian Wushuang.

He had previously felt that Jian Wushuang was slightly crazy but those continuous battles had given him huge confidence.

He was looking forward to Jian Wushuang leading the Divine Sword Army and attacking the remaining third third-rated forces.

He was not the only one as most of the Divine Sword Army’s soldiers felt the same.

Jian Wushuang had earlier announced that they could take over their dead enemies’ Interspatial Rings in such battles, hence it was natural for them wanting to continue conquering others. One of the reasons being they were enjoying the killing spree while the other was that all of them had somewhat benefited after experiencing both battles with some gaining huge amounts of spoils.
