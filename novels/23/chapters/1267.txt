Chapter 1268: The Leopard-print Island

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

By using only ten percent of his power, it had been enough to match the strength of Universe Master Bei. Now, using only thirty percent of his power… it was beyond what the Invincible Universe Masters could withstand.

Moreover, the swordsmanship he displayed was extremely skilful.

Hong Shou defended himself with his saber at once. However, after it collided with Jian Wushuang’s sword, his saber almost bent under the force. The power behind the strike immediately fell on Hong Shou.

Boom!

Hong Shou was sent flying from the impact of the collision.

The impact was so great that he knocked down some barracks and palaces before regaining his balance.

After the strike, under everyone’s stunned eyes, Jian Wushuang sheathed his sword and bowed in a certain direction. After that, he headed off to Leopard-print Island.

There was dead silence in the barracks.

The sergeants were still in shock long after Jian Wushuang had departed.

After a long while, an uproar broke out in the barracks again.

“This Jian Wushuang…”

Lin Dong’s and Mo You’s eyes flickered.

“I told you the death of that Universe God of Red Water Alliance was not as simple as what Jian Wushaung had explained. I’m right. his power is unfathomable.” Lin Dong said in a low voice.

“Hong Shou is able to withstand several blows, even with a Universe God. How could he be defeated by a single blow from Jian Wushuang?” Mo You was full of disbelief.

They were so amazed by Jian Wushuang’s power despite having seen it in action before. Those who did not know that were even more amazed.

The news that Jian Wushuang had defeated Hong Shou spread through the barracks like wildfire. Hong Shou was too ashamed to show his face.

In the void above the barracks, where Jian Wushuang had bowed to before he left,?stood a man who resembled a towering brown bear. The man was no other than Commander Man Yi.

“Jian Wushuang is really an interesting character”?The commander thought with a smile.?“He figured out my intention of testing his power through Hong Shou, so he defeated Hong Shou with a quick strike. He wanted me to see that.

“Besides, before he left, he bowed toward the direction where I stood as if he knew I was here all this while, watching them. I thought?I’ve hidden myself well?

“Given all this, he is really a genius of wisdom, as talented as the Universe God Qing Yang of the Holy Prefecture!

“I should observe him secretly first. When he comes back from Leopard-print Island, I will tell the Lord my findings regarding him.”

Leopard-print Island was so far away from Scarlet Island that it took Jian Wushuang five days to to get there, even when he was travelling at full speed.

The moment he arrived on the island, he was surrounded by the auras of the cultivators.

“Who is there?”

A patrol of cultivators spotted Jian Wushuang and immediately rushed to surround him.

As soon as they approached him, they immediately sensed the aura of Jian Wushuang’s token.

“Divine General.”

The cultivators saluted Jian Wushuang respectfully.

“I’m here under the commander’s order. Is Universe God Qian Luan on the island?” Jian Wushuang asked them.

“Yes.” the leader of the patrol answered respectfully.

“Great, take me to her immediately.” Jian Wushuang ordered.

“Yes, sir.”

The sergeants led Jian Wushuang deep into the island. It did not take them long to arrive at an exquisite pavilion. Entering it, Jian Wushuang saw Universe God Qian Luan.

The Universe God was a beautiful and graceful lady, dressed in a green robe.

From the information Jian Wushuang had gathered about her, she was an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven.

“Universe God Qian Luan!” Jian Wushuang saluted her respectfully.

“You are Jian Wushuang, the person who has just joined our Scarlet Island?” Universe God Qian Luan looked at Jian Wushuang and had a worried expression on her face. “I asked the commander to send a Universe God here, but here you are, a Divine General.”

From her look, others could tell that she was not happy about Jian Wushuang’s status.

“The commander said that the other Universe Gods on Nine Star Sea were busy with their own business and can’t leave their positions and it would be too late if he assigned someone here from the headquarters. Therefore, he ordered me to come here.” Jian Wushuang explained to her.

“It doesn’t help much to have you here. You’re just a Universe Master.” Universe God Qian Luan waved her hands.

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang responded with a wry smile. “Don’t worry. The commander must have known about your situation when he made the decision, but still, he sent me here. He thinks I can help you.”

“You will be able to help me?” Universe God Qian Luan glanced at Jian Wushuang and said with a smile, “Answer my question, what do you think about your skills when compared with the first Divine General Hong Shou?”

“Compared with Hong Shou?” Jian Wushuang was surprised by the question, but he answered without hesitation. “I am stronger than him!”

“Stronger than him?” Universe God Qian Luan was amazed. “Are you sure about that?”

“Of course I am, because before I left the island, I defeated him in a fight.” Jian Wushuang replied.

He only said that he defeated Hong Shou, without mentioning that it was through a single strike.

“Oh?” Universe God Qian Luan raised her eyebrows and her eyes lit up.

She was well aware about Hong Shou’s power. That man was powerful enough to battle the weaker ones among the Universe Gods in the First Heaven. If what Jian Wushuang said was true, that he was more powerful than Hong Shou, he could battle those Universe Gods as well.

“It seems that the commander did not lie to me. I know his difficulties, so, I am really happy that he sent you here at such a crucial moment when we are in a fierce battle with the Golden-sun Sect.” Universe God Qian Luan showed a smile of understanding.

“Jian Wushuang, I see you carry a sword with you, are you a cultivator in Sword Principle?” Universe God Qian Luan suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“What a coincidence.” Universe God Qian Luan continued with a smile. “Two days ago, we made a new discovery in the Leopard-print Gem Mine. It may be helpful to you.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What’s the discovery?” Jian Wushuang was excited.

“Come with me.”

Universe God Qian Luan stood up from her seat and led Jian Wushuang towards the core place of the Leopard-print Gem Mine on the island.

Jian Wushuang followed her curiously.
