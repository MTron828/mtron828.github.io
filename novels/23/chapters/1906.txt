Chapter 1907: Trap!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Don’t worry,” Hall Master Yuan smiled confidently.

In the core region of the galaxy formation, the experts were under attack by the four one-eyed giants. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The four huge figures collapsed.

However, looking at the four one-eyed giants that just crumbled, in the vast void, a large amount of energy concentrated and immediately formed four one-eyed giants again.

“This is?” Everyone from Lineage of Star looked shocked.

“The four one-eyed giants are substantiated by the galaxy formation. As long as the formation is there, the one-eyed giant is invincible. Even if they were defeated, they could re-substantiate and continue to fight,” Hall Master Yuan explained, “This is only one of the attacks of the galaxy formation. As for more attack measures, wait till the formation goes full-force and displays them.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and looked around, “Next, it’s time for all of you to attack. Like I said before, you’ll be rewarded according to merit. If everyone would like to get the Secret Skill of Star Palace earlier, you have to go all-out for this battle.”

“Sword Emperor, don’t worry,” Emperor God Jiu Yin was the first to reply, “With our team and the aid of the formation, although I don’t dare to say we could kill all experts in Star Extermination Alliance, we could at least defeat them, crush them in heavy defeat!”

“Yes, defeat them, crush them!”

“We felt aggrieved for so many years and it is finally time to counterattack.”

“Don’t let any of them escape the galaxy formation alive!”

The guest elders’ eyes were burning with enthusiasm and their faces were plastered with bloodthirsty smiles.

Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his lips at the sight. Then, he looked at Hall Master Yuan. “Send us over.”

“Alright,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

Under the manipulation of Hall Master Yuan, there were space wormholes in the void in front of them.

“Everyone, go ahead,” Hall Master said in a bright and loud voice.

Everyone in Lineage of Star, including the one hundred and twenty Dao soldiers, took a huge stride into the space wormholes in front of them without hesitation.

Thought space wormhole, the experts in Lineage of Star instantly appeared in the core region of the galaxy formation.

There, the experts in Star Extermination Alliance were fighting with the four one-eyed giants.

They had already broken the one-eyed giants once, but the one-eyed giants substantiated again and fought with them again.

“The four one-eyed giants are not true living things. They should be affected by the galaxy. As long as they are within the galaxy, they are invincible. There’s no need to tangle with them. We only need to barge into the lair of Lineage of Star,” Palace Master Wu Luo shouted.

Suddenly…

Vroom!

The space wormholes appeared in the surrounding void. In an instant, there were at least ten space wormholes that appeared from nowhere.

Then, there were figures that leapt out from the space wormholes and appeared in front of the experts in Star Extermination Alliance.

Looking at the figures that leaped out form the space wormholes, the experts in Star Extermination Alliance were shocked.

Too many.

There were too many experts who had leapt out from the space wormholes. There was absolutely more than a hundred of them.

Amongst, the bronze-armored Dao soldiers were the most.

Star Extermination Alliance knew these Dao soldiers as well.

“How could there be so many?”

“Oh, oh my!”

“Sh*t!!!”

The experts in Star Extermination Alliance were shocked.

Everyone in Lineage of Star, including the Dao soldiers, was soaring with murderous intention the moment they leapt out of the space wormholes.

“Die!”

“Kill all of them!”

“Haha, Star Extermination Alliance, you came today, so don’t think about leaving!”

The voice shook the earth as everyone attacked simultaneously. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Once they attacked, they went all-out. In the surrounding galaxy, there was a layer of blurry light, just like warm sunlight that shone on all experts and Dao soldiers from Lineage of Star. The experts and Dao soldiers’ power received a certain level of improvement.

Hong!

An earth-shattering war was finally taking place.

“Be careful!”

“Trap, it’s a trap!!”

“Lineage of Star, since when did they have so many extra Dao soldiers? And the formation, what’s going on with it?”

Star Extermination Alliance was panicking.

That was normal. After the war that had happened two hundred and fifty years ago, after they had defeated Lineage of Star, Star Extermination Alliance didn’t think how powerful Lineage of Star could be.

They thought as long as the galaxy formation collapsed, it would be easy to destroy Lineage of Star.

But then, the scene before them had totally surpassed their expectations.

Since the appearance of the four one-eyed giants to the display of Lineage of Star’s power, most importantly, the one hundred and twenty Dao soldiers… The fighting power was shocking.

Then, no matter how stupid they were, they could tell that Lineage of Star was showing the white feather and was hiding.

Why did they show the white feather?

Why did they hide?

No doubt, it was because of them.

In order to reveal flaws intentionally and lead them to the core of the formation.

From the beginning to the end, it had been Lineage of Star’s strategy.

It was a trap!

“B*stard. Don’t panic!!!”

There was a loud roar. Number One Divine King from Divine King Island was giving out terrifying aura as his voice reverberated in the battlefield.

“So what if it is a trap? We Star Extermination Alliance gathered five top forces and our overall fighting power is fierce. How could Lineage of Star match evenly to us?”

“Don’t panic. Launch full attack and kill everyone in Lineage of Star!”

Listening to Number One Divine King’s comment, the experts in Star Extermination Alliance calmed down.

Yes, even if the formation was really a trap, the strategy that Lineage of Star had set up from the beginning to the end, Star Extermination Alliance’s power was on display. Almost seventy Almighties and ten Emperor Gods could easily wipe out everything.

“Die! Die!”

The experts in Star Extermination Alliance beamed with sharp gaze and greeted their attack.

“This should be it,” Number One Divine King’s eyes grew cold.

But then…

“No!” A shrill scream was heard.

The roar came from next to Number One Divine King. Number One Divine King immediately looked and saw a resplendent golden light piercing the head of a young and immature young man dressed in black. The resplendent golden light pierced his head and paused in the void slightly.

Number One Divine King saw clearly that the resplendent golden light was Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Sword.

“Second brother!!!”

Number One Divine King was suddenly shocked.

One should know that Hong Jun Golden Sword had pierced his second brother’s head, also the Number Two Divine King of Divine King Island!!!

There was a total of three Divine Kings in Divine King Island. The three Divine Kings controlled Divine King Island together and they were tightly knitted like true brothers.

There were two Divine Kings that came from Divine King Island but then his second brother was killed before him directly.
