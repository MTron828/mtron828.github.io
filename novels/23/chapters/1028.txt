Chapter 1029: Divine Monster Territory

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As Jian Wushuang expected, the entire Samsara Continent was startled by the news.

Many populations, including some advanced and top populations, and countless solitary experts, were astounded by that. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They could gain 20 Chaos Gems simply by conveying the trace of a person to Empyrean Patriarch?

Even Celestial Masters were tempted by that.

Crazy!

Everyone on the entire Samsara Continent went crazy.

The scene shifted to a dim hall, the secluded headquarters of another powerful force on the Samsara Continent.

This force specialized in intelligence.

A purple-clothed woman looked at the information she just attained with burning eyes.

“Issue my order immediately; do our utmost to find Jian Wushuang in the shortest possible time!”

“20 Chaos Gems! I’ll obtain them as long as I track down an easily identified Eternal Realm expert. I must find him as soon as possible!”

Several black-robed men got together on the top floor of a towering pavilion.

“The value of 20 Chaos Gems are almost equal to all the treasures of a Celestial Master. Empyrean Patriarch is really generous.”

“We’ve confirmed the news and our priority is to chase down Jian Wushuang quickly.” One of the black-robed men said in a deep voice. “People in our Divine Shadow Gang are adept at intelligence and only a few forces can rival us on the Samsara Continent. It’s time to give our capability full play.”

“Jian Wushuang is a young man who is skilled at using the sword. Though he is at the Eternal Realm, he’s quite powerful!”

“We must find him before any other forces and populations can!”

“Issue the red order and ask everyone to find him.”

In a top population, an emaciated and glum elder cackled from time to time when he glanced through the information in his hands.

“I rarely see Empyrean Patriarch fly into a rage!”

“His reaction is reasonable. After all, his precious was killed by someone else. Hehe, 20 Chaos Gems. This old man is quite generous in order to avenge his son’s death.”

“Ask our men to pay attention to the killer. 20 Chaos Gems are by no means a small amount of money. They can strengthen our force to some extent.”

All populations, some top forces, and many solitary experts on the Samsara Continent sprang into action immediately.

Everyone began to keep an eye on a man at the Eternal Realm who was good at Sword Principle and powerful than normal Rank Three Dao Masters.

Jian Wushuang already speculated that but did not care too much.

He still did what he ought to do and continually studied swordsmanships. In fact, he was not so much anxious as happy.

That meant he was already famous on the entire Samsara Continent.

He made a name for himself without doing anything.

And if his father was still on the Samsara Continent and already a Reincarnator above Rank Seven, he definitely would learn the news. In other words, his father would know that he already came here to find him. Therefore, they could gather together without much effort.

Jian Wushuang was more careful when studying Sword Principles and swordsmanships on the trip.

Moreover, he always restrained himself from acting rashly.

There was a crowd of Eternal Realm experts who were skilled in Sword Principle on the Samsara Continent. As long as he did not act rashly or expose the strength that far surpassed the supposed strength of Eternal Realm experts, no one would recognize him. But if he did, he would give away his identity.

Time flied…

It took Jian Wushuang whole 50 years to arrive at the Divine Monster Territory, although no accident happened on the trip.

“Divine Monster Territory…”

Jian Wushuang stood on the top of a mountain and overlooked the vast territory before him with a glimmer of light in his eyes.

Unlike other places on the Samsara Continent, the Divine Monster Territory was more extensive. Most importantly, there existed far more experts.

As a piece of the most prosperous and broad territory on the Samsara Continent, it was the gathering place for experts and elites on the Samsara Continent.

The headquarters of the top forces on this continent was in the Divine Monster Territory, the same for some top populations.

“Top populations…” Jian Wushuang looked at the Star Map in his hand and murmured.

He knew something about those populations.

There were four top populations on the Samsara Continent, namely the Ancient Monster Clan, the Blood Asura Clan, the Python Clan, and the Blood Phoenix Clan.

They were deeply rooted on this continent and were formidable forces that possessed abundant resources. Even the Samsara Temple did not dare to act recklessly on matters concerning them.

The reason they became top populations was that they possessed at least one Celestial Master.

“I have achieved great progress in Sword Principles and swordsmanships over the past 50 years. In addition, my Ancient God Power improved drastically because I have swallowed the Chaos Gold Bead.” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Since the Chaos Gold Bead was a very rare treasure, it would inevitably help him to improve his Ancient God Power very quickly.

“Over the years, my Ancient God Power has reached a new Level, although it’s far from reaching the Three-star Peak. My strength has increased by leaps and bounds as well.” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists. “However, there are innumerable experts in the Divine Monster Territory and I’m threatened by Empyrean Patriarch, so I still have to keep a low profile.”

“First, I got to find Ding Mo, the Elder that Dao Master Dreamless introduced to me.”

Jian Wushuang moved forward and entered the Divine Monster Territory.

It was dotted with numerous large cities and there existed one city named Emperor Heart City.

And that was where Ding Mo was at.

He not only lived in this city, but he was also the Governor. He established a large-scale team of guards with a number of Dao Masters.

Not to mention his identity in the Samsara Temple, his strength alone was equivalent to that of an advanced population.
