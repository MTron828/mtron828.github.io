Chapter 231: Weapons Divided Into Three Grades

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang stirred the body of Triple-kill Sword with his fingers. Yet the Triple-kill Sword, seeming to possess a soul, was trembling slightly. Simultaneously surprised and delighted, he felt waves from the Triple-kill Sword.

“It seems that the Triple-kill Sword is different from before,” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help saying.

“Of course it’s different now,” Jin Ling answered while snorting. “How could it just be a normal weapon if it is used to enter the Ancestor’s Land? Because it hasn’t been involved in battle for several years, its Sword Spirit was already asleep. I only just woke it up.”

“Sword Spirit?” Jian Wushuang winced.

“Little guy, you don’t know what Sword Spirit is?” Jin Ling said and looked to Jiang WuShuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Aren’t you ignorant.” Jin Ling smiled and shook his head. “Ah yes, the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor is on the decline, so their horizon has lowered.”

“Listen up, the Triple-kill Sword is not a normal weapon, but a magic weapon!”

“The weapons are divided into three grades!”

“The third grade is normal, the second grade is spiritual while the first grade is masterful! Each grade is divided into three levels: inferior, medium, and superior.”

“The Triple-kill Sword in your hand is a superior second-grade magic weapon. Normally, it possesses a soul, but it has fallen asleep. This happened because when your father fought with the experts, it got hurt. Alas, its power got buried.”

“I have woken up its Sword Spirit and its power has recovered. But the Triple-kill Sword hasn’t completely recovered, it fell down to superior third grade.”

“I see,”Jian Wushuang murmured while nodding. Feeling the power of the Triple-kill Sword, he could not help but be shocked.

He felt that the Triple-kill Sword was so powerful now.?“Has it not completely recovered?”

“How can I make it recover to its optimum power?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I have said that the Triple-kill Sword is a Sword of Killing, eager for blood. If you want to recover its power, you have to kill others with it as far as possible. The more kills, the more powerful man you kill, the faster it recovers. Even when the Triple-kill Sword recovers to its optimum in the future, continue to use it for kills to improve its grade,” Jin Ling said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded seriously while holding the Triple-kill Sword tightly, with a glimmer of expectation.

Jiang WuShuang imagined a scene of the Triple-kill Sword at its optimum and stronger than ever before.

“In fact, not only the magic weapons are divided into three grades, but also Origin manuals,” Jin Ling suddenly said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked towards her.

Jin Ling continued, “The Origin manual, is also divided into three grades while each grade is divided into three levels, inferior, medium and superior. Just like the two Original Sword Techniques you got, the Selfless Sword Technique and Blood Emptying Technique...

“The Selfless Sword Technique is the medium third-grade manual.

“The Blood Emptying Technique is superior third-grade.”

Jin Ling stopped and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had a serious look on his face. He didn’t know that the magic weapons and Origin manuals were divided into three grades until now.

“In my opinion, the Selfless Sword Technique and Blood Emptying Technique are very powerful. The Blood Emptying Technique is a Sword Skill on the third grade. What about the second-grade sword technique or the first-grade sword technique?” Jian Wushuang said with shock.

The third-grade Sword Skill was also powerful.

Wouldn’t the power of the second-grade sword technique and first-grade sword technique be more shocking?

“If a manual is the third grade, its power is incredible. In fact, many Origin Manuals are of low quality. The Selfless Sword Technique and Blood Emptying Technique you have are very good and useful enough for you.”

“Even the elders of Divine Transcendence can’t possess the second-grade or first-grade Sword Skill. Of course, if you reach the level of Divine Transcendence, come back to the Ancestor’s Land and pass the test. Then you will get a chance to gain the second-grade sword technique,” Jin Ling smiled and said.

Jian Wushuang fell silent.

“Divine Transcendence?”

His strength was enhanced by the Cultivation of Spiritual Power from Purple Crystal Lake, but he just reached the Peak of the Yin Void Realm. There was a long way for him to reach Divine Transcendence.

The level was hard to break out of.

“Okay, I have already said what I have to. You may leave. When you’ve reached the level of Divine Transcendence, make your return,” Jin Ling said.

“Thank you.”

Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude and was led away by Mu Shan. He then left the Ancestor’s Land by wormhole.

In Dark Forest, a figure abruptly shot up to the sky while the strong air swept across, breaking up the silence of this place.

“Half of a year.” Jiang WuShuang clenched his fists, curling up a smile.

Previously when he stayed in the Ancestor’s Land for two years, he made great progress.

Although he stayed only half a year this time, his progress was more apparent.

His Cultivation of Spiritual Power was directly stepped into the Peak of the Yin Void Realm from the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, which was breaking through four realms.

At the same time, he also understood Slaughter Origin and entered the way of killing.

Having meditated for a month in Rainstorm Palace, his World Origin and Slaughter Origin had greatly improved. The same went for his swordsmanship.

It was certain that his strength had experienced a radical improvement within half of a year.

“Half a year ago, I went to the Ancestor’s Land directly after returning from the Easternmost Hunting. I don’t know how the Tianzong Dynasty has been like in the half year,” Jian Wushuang murmured. “I must be steady. I am cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill. When I step into the Yin-Yang Void Realm, I would meet with the Yin and Yang Breaking. But how am I to break it?”

Immediately, Jian Wushuang found a place in the Dark Forest, sat down and then began to operate the Heavenly Creation Skill.

All the movements of the Heavenly Creation Skill were unbelievable and different.

As for the Ninth Heaven of Divine Path, the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, and the Supreme Golden Pill Realm, each step was much powerful than a common warrior.

As a counterpart to the Yin-Yang Void Realm, the Yin and Yang Breaking naturally was bound to be different. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang sat and studied for a long time. Finally, he understood the Yin and Yang Breaking.

Jian Wushuang operated his spiritual power. As it went on, there was a strong spiritual power that gradually broke out from his body. In the spiritual power, there was a shadow.

The shadow was like a baby, but its volume was small. As the shadow appeared in the void, the vast expanse of Spiritual Power of Heaven and Earth gathered toward it, swaddling it like a baby. As more Spiritual Power gathered together, a figure whose bodyline or appearance was the same as Jian Wushuang appeared next to him.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes. Looking at the other man who looked just like him, he lips could not help but curl into a smile.

“The Yin-Yang doppelganger is here!”
