“Depends on me?”

Hearing Xuan Yi, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and tried his best to calm himself down.

The next moment, he sat down directly and closed his eyes.

The Green Fire World experts also heard Xuan Yi’s words and knew that Xuan Yi created an opportunity for Jian Wushuang and for the Green Fire World at all costs. Thus, no one dared to disturb Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately started to sense the Formation through the Mountain River Map and the four black giant hands.

Only a moment later, he sensed the complete existence of the Enduring Samsara Formation.

Before, Jian Wushuang just watched the Enduring Samsara Formation in the distance. He could see that the Formation consisted of two extreme energies in circulation. However, he could not see the essence of the two energies.

But now, through the Mountain River Map and the four giant hands that clung to the entire Formation, Jian Wushuang saw the two forces clearly. Only for a moment, he saw the essence of two extreme forces.

“The two forces…”

“So familiar! Familiar!

“This is the extreme power of the yang and the yin!”

Jian Wushuang’s mind went blank as if he had been struck by a lightning.

He immediately understood why his master said that the essence of the Enduring Samsara Formation was a Creation for him.

It was indeed a Creation, a once-in-a-lifetime Creation.

“It’s a combination of the two extreme forces, the Yin and the Yang. This is exactly the same Yin and Yang forces of my Yin-Yang Sword Principle!” Many things instantly crossed Jian Wushuang’s mind.

The Yin-Yang Sword Principle he developed was a Perfect Combination of Yin and Yang strength.

“It is the same!

“The only difference is that after the combination, the two forces of the yang and the yin in the Formation formed a circulation and reached a balanced state. They are in a unique state, which is the very Samsara!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes which were full of intense light.

“I understand! I finally understand!”

“A Perfect Combination of the two extreme Yin and Yang forces is Samsara!”

“When Yin-Yang Sword Principle reaches its peak, it becomes the Samsara Sword Principle!”

“Samsara!!! ”

Jian Wushuang clenched both hands.

He had devised three Sword Principles, among which the Swordplay of Coalescence and the Spacetime Sword Principle were already the strongest Sword Principles.

However, he never had improved the Yin-Yang Sword Principle, and even failed to know how.

Now he realized that, beyond Yin and Yang, it was Samsara!

“The Samsara Sword Principle!! ”

Jian Wushuang roared in his heart and closed his eyes. He became completely absorbed in the circulation of the Enduring Samsara Formation.

He already had a hunch that, as long as he understood the structure of the circulatory state, his Spacetime Sword Principle could be truly transformed into a Samsara Sword Principle.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had cleared his head and became fully engaged in meditation.

At the core of the black and white vortex, Jiu Xi watched the Formation being pulled into the World Scroll but could do nothing.

“Jin Feng, do something!” Jiu Xi urged.

“Humph, you devised the Formation. Not even you can stop it, what am I going to do?” The Jin Kingdom monarch’s face fell.

He had just tried his best to stop but soon realized he had no chance to stop the four giant hands at all.

“It looks like that this Formation will vanish soon.” In the eyes of the Jin Kingdom monarch, there was a rush of coldness.

He originally wanted to completely destroy the Green Fire World and all the experts in the Battle Fortress so that he could keep the entire battlefield to himself.

But now, this plan was going to fail.

The Jin Kingdom’s soldiers and strength were much stronger than those of the Green Fire World. He was supposed to destroy the Green Fire World. However, he could not kill all of their experts.

At most, he could destroy the Green Fire World, but he could not kill all of their experts. Their experts could take shelter in the Battle Fortress. In the future, when he started to search for the treasures on this battlefield after the end of the war, those surviving experts might came out and cause troubles.

“These ants in the Green Fire World are really stubborn. Since I can’t kill them all at once, then I have to wipe out the Gren Fire World first. As for the remaining experts, I’ll deal with them later!” The Jin Kingdom monarch decided.

Immediately he sent a message to the Jin Kingdom experts in the Spaceship far away from the battlefield. He had ordered them to act.

In moments, a large number of Jin Kingdom experts flew out from the Spaceship. There were at least several thousand of them.

Among them, even the weakest ones were Celestial Masters, and there were more than 100 Universe Masters!

This was Jin Kingdom’s real strength!

It was obviously different from the previous tentative attack.

This time, it was the real ultimate battle!

The Jin Kingdom was determined to destroy the Green Fire World this time!

When the Jin Kingdom experts flew out of the Spaceship, the Green Fire World experts in the Battle Fortress all notice it.

Even Palace Masters, including Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master, all looked grave at the sight of the rushing Jin Kingdom army.

“The final battle is finally coming?”

Palace Masters such as Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master all looked stern.

The Green Fire World experts looked grave as well.

Actually, if the Enduring Samsara Formation was destroyed in the end, they could totally take shelter inside the Battle Fortress, where the Jin Kingdom experts would never break into. Nevertheless, they all knew they could not avoid this war!

After all, behind the Battle Fortress was the Green Fire World!

If they did not fight, the Green Fire World would be finished!

Their loved ones and good friends would be slaughtered by the Jin Kingdom. Billions of people in the Green Fire World and countless creatures would be killed! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The land where they grew up and their homes would disappear completely.

They had no choice!

They had to fight!

Before the Jin Kingdom army marched into the Green Fire World, they must stop them at all costs!

“Fight!”

“Fight!”

“Fight!”

Numerous Green Fire World experts gathered on the Perimeter of the Battle Fortress. The Dao Masters had already formed a tactical formation, determined.
