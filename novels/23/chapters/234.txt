Chapter 235: He Moved?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Thud!

With his right hand still lightly swirling the bowl of wine, Jian Wushuang reached out to the middle-aged man’s wrist with his left hand. It was like a huge pair of pliers in action as Jian Wushuang exerted significant strength.

Crack!

Sounds of bones cracking traveled through the air. The middle-aged man’s face turned red, like the color of a pig liver. His mouth was opened as if he wanted to say something.

Jian Wushuang gave him a tight slap.

Slap!

Bang!

The crisp sound resounded and the middle-aged man was seen flying through the air. He crashed painfully against the wall of the secret chamber.

The walls trembled for a while, and the man slowly slid off the wall.

Tang Wuji and the Guests at the pavilion were standing at the side, shocked by the sight that just unfolded before their eyes.

This middle-aged man was Ouyang Xiu. He is an expert of the Ouyang clan who had reached the Profound Yin Void Realm.

Notably, the Guests in attendance were the most powerful ones of Pavilion of Raindrops, who reached the Initial Yin Void Realm. They treated Ouyang Xiu with the highest respect.

But what about now?

With a single stroke, Ouyang Xiu had been seen sent flying through the air like a dead dog.

The Guests were shocked and looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief. The black-clothed elder was even more grateful that Jian Wushuang did not pick on him earlier. If not...

Ouyang Xiu was completely blown away.

Jian Wushuang stood up and walked towards Ouyang Xiu stealthily, casting a cold gaze at him.

“When you go back, tell your Clan Leader that from today onwards, the Pavilion of Raindrops will no longer associate with the Ouyang clan. If your clan is unhappy, come and find me. Or maybe when the experts of the Nine Emperors Sect fight two days later, your clan can attack too. I do not mind clearing this mess altogether.

“Get lost!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Ouyang Xiu stood up and glared at Jian Wushuang with his fists clenched. His gaze was full of spite.

“Good, what Pavilion of Raindrops!”

“Wait, just you wait!”

“Two days later, I want to see your pavilion will kneel before the experts of the Nine Emperors Sect and beg for mercy!”

Ouyang Xiu cursed as he left.

“Mr. Ouyang!”

The Guests were worried, trying to retain him.

Tang Wuji was the only one with furrowed eyebrows, keeping silent from beginning to the end.

Just after Ouyang Xiu left, a few Guests began to sigh.

“We’re doomed!”

“This time, it’s the end for my Pavilion of Raindrops!”

“Not only did we not get the help from the Ouyang clan, we even harshly offended them. How am I supposed to fight against the experts of the Nine Emperors Sect two days later?”

The Guests had all lost hope.

Tang Wuji remained silent. But he was staring at Jian Wushuang with a bright gaze.

“Tang Wuji, do you believe me?” Jian Wushuang looked at Tang Wuji and asked.

“Yes.” Tang Wuji nodded without hesitation.

“That’s enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and sat down to continue drinking without saying much.

That night, a stealthy black shadow took advantage of the darkness and crept into the Nine Emperors Sect.

Even though the security was tight, sneaking in was no kick for Jian Wushuang’s ability.

Hidden within the Nine Emperors Sect was the courtyard near the mountain.

Jian Wushuang appeared in the void above the courtyard. Overlooking the emptiness, his facial expression remained.

“Indeed, father is no longer here.” Jian Wushuang had predicted this, but could not help but be disappointed.

The courtyard was once used to imprison his father. Jian Wushuang had brought a group of Golden Dragon Ambassadors to destroy the place but was unable to save him. Since his father’s location was exposed, seeing as to how the Blood Feather Tower valued his father, they would have naturally moved him elsewhere immediately.

But Jian Wushuang had no idea where they moved him to.

After confirming that his father had been moved, Jian Wushuang turned and left. When he passed by the meeting hall of the Nine Emperors Sect, he stopped moving and looked inside.

“That person...”

Jian Wushuang saw a weathered elder who was leaning on a dragon-headed crutch and had smiling eyes.

This weathered elder was not an expert of Nine Emperors Sect. But now he was treated with unwavering attention, being surrounded by many experts themselves.

Even Mo Feng, the Upper Elder who had already achieved the Initial Yang Void Realm, was sitting beside the weathered elder. He looked very respectful.

“To be respected by the experts like this means that this is a big character. It could be one of the experts from the highest level.”?Jian Wushuang guessed silently.

In that instant, the weathered elder who had been quietly sitting down in the meeting hall suddenly opened his smiling eyes and disappeared without a trace.

The next moment, he appeared in the void that Jian Wushuang was at. But it was so quiet with not a single trace of human touch.

“Was it an illusion?” The weathered elder murmured and returned to the meeting hall.

In a void not far away, Jian Wushuang witnessed this with furrowed brows. “Not bad, this old guy could detect my presence.”

Two days later, also the day the Nine Emperors Sect mentioned.

Early this morning, when the sun first broke into the sky, a large number of experts from the Nine Emperors Sect swarmed into action.

Four Yin Void experts and the Upper Elder, who had reached the Initial Yang Void Realm, were in action.

Other than that, there were also a huge number of disciples of the Primordial Gold Core Realm.

It can be said that almost all of those in the Nine Emperors Sect were out in action.

“My Nine Emperors Sect has suffered from depletion of strength ever since Jian Wushuang’s previous attack! My position in the three sects and four schools has not been stable. Various Sects of the Tiannan Province are now waiting to replace us after we have fallen!”

“Too bad that their dreams will soon be shattered!”

“Today’s battle is key in proving the strength of the Nine Emperors Sect, there is no room for mistakes! We must cleanly wipe out the Pavilion of Raindrops and let everyone know we cannot be challenged by just anyone!”

“Are you clear?”

Mo Feng, Upper Elder of Nine Emperors Sect, howled at the surrounding elders.

“Yes,” They replied in unison.

Mo Feng nodded slightly and looked towards the weathered elder who was standing in the crowd and leaning against his crutch.

The elders of the Nine Emperors Sect were all hyped and ready to fight. Only this elder remained as calm as usual.

“Mr. Ku, we will need you to stay back and be the backup,” Mo Feng said.

The weathered elder looked up at Mo Feng and said hoarsely, “I will only fight against those from the Ouyang clan that may show up. As for that Pavilion of Raindrops, I will leave it to you all.”

“No problem, it is only the Pavilion of Raindrops. They are no match for our Nine Emperors Sect.” Mo Feng grinned and waved.

“Set off!”

The experts of the Nine Emperors Sect immediately set off.
