Chapter 2628: Territorial Lord Returns

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Cang Heng and the others were only able to occupy 40 percent of the Blood Gem mineral vein due to their larger military size advantage. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Cang Heng had mobilized nine out of ten Northern Darkstar Territory Official Army battalions and formed a military formation with considerably strong combat power. On the other hand, the Green Flame Star Territory was fighting outside of his territory and was only able to mobilize five battalions for the battle. However, the Peak Earthly Ultimate God Green Flame Territorial Lord managed to help his team gain an absolute advantage with his exceptional strength.

However, Cang Heng and the others would be at a greater disadvantage if the Green Flame Territorial Lord was able to bring in one or two more army battalions from the Green Flame Star Territory as that would make it rather impossible for them to continue occupying 40 percent of the mineral vein.

“It’s simply too much for the Green Flame Territorial Lord to not only rely on his exceptional personal strength but also bring his army into our territory to rob the mineral vein!”

“It’s unfortunate that our territorial lord isn’t here. Otherwise, the Green Flame Territorial Lord won’t dare to be so presumptuous.”

“Not necessarily. Although our territorial lord is powerful, his combat prowess is only at the level of a High-level Earth Ultimate God—there’s still quite a big gap between him and the Green Flame Territorial Lord. I’m afraid our territorial lord might have to bow down to the Green Flame Territorial Lord if the two of them meet and fight.”

The commanders were in a discussion and soon fell silent at the end of their discussion.

Even if the military strength of the two territories were equivalent, their territorial lords indeed had different strengths.

The world was a place where spoils belonged to the victors.

Suddenly...

“What are you guys discussing?” An indifferent voice sounded.

Cang Heng and the other commanders were startled. They immediately turned around to look at the source of the sound.

They had not noticed a young man wearing golden robes and carrying a longsword had appeared.

“Territorial Lord.”

Cang Heng was the first to react and immediately saluted respectfully.

“A pleasure to meet the Territorial Lord.” The other commanders saluted and felt a little apprehensive.

The feeling was heightened as cold sweat beaded on them when they were reminded that they were speaking ill of their territorial lord just moments ago.

They were worried if Jian Wushuang heard what they just said.

Jian Wushuang did hear their discussion, but he could care less.

“Commander Cang Heng, tell me what’s going on with the Blood Gem mineral vein at this moment?” Jian Wushuang sat down next to the table.

Cang Heng immediately explained the situation in great detail.

“One billion catties?”

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked to hear the figures.

“This is just the amount of Blood Gems from the mineral vein we have discovered for the time being—there are still many that haven’t been discovered. We currently only occupy forty percent of the Blood Gems whereas sixty percent is with the Green Flame Territorial Lord. If the number of Blood Gems in the entire mineral vein added up to billions, then its value will be a few tens of billion Primordial Stones,” said Cang Heng.

“It’s a huge Blood Gem mineral vein?” Jian Wushuang secretly smacked his tongue but kept a calm front. “This mineral vein is way too valuable. Although it appears within our star territory, we can’t take control of the entire mineral vein with our capabilities alone. I believe that people from Crimson Stone Fort will come forward sooner or later.”

Jian Wushuang knew very well that the lucrative mineral vein worth tens of billion Primordial Stones would be very appealing to top factions in Danyang Holy Domain. On the other hand, the Crimson Stone Fort was the official ruler of Danyang Holy Domain with every stellar region and territorial lord being appointed and administered by them.

The Crimson Stone Fort would send an expert to retrieve the high-valued mineral vein in Northern Darkstar Territory.

Cang Heng nodded in agreement. “The largest winner from the mineral vein’s appearance will be the Crimson Stone Fort, but they’ll need miners to get the Blood Gems. Therefore, they’ll naturally source manpower from Northern Darkstar Territory and entrust our Official Army to be responsible for monitoring the mining process until its completion. I suppose the Territorial Lord and Official Army will be able to gain a lot of benefits during that time as Crimson Stone Fort will usually leave us some gravy when they take the meat.”

“The current problem with the Green Flame Star Territory is their actions of taking away even our last bit of gravy.”

Jian Wushuang cracked a faint smile as Cang Heng’s metaphor was very appropriate. They could only pick up the leftovers after Crimson Stone Fort had collected their share of the benefit. How could they be able to accept the Green Flame Star Territory rushing in and taking a cut of their portion?

“Let’s go and meet the Green Flame Territorial Lord,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Cang Heng did not act immediately from puzzlement. “Master, the Green Flame Territorial Lord is a Peak Earth Ultimate God. I hear he’s very powerful.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. “Take me to him.”

Cang Heng stopped hesitating after noticing Jian Wushuang’s confidence and immediately set off to lead the way.

Jian Wushuang soon arrived at the void above the camp on the mine’s other end.

There were many soldiers from the Green Flame Star Territory’s Official Army in the camp.

“Master, the Green Flame Territorial Lord is in this camp,” said Cang Heng.

“Hmm.” Jian Wushuang nodded as he had sensed an extremely tyrannical aura from the camp.

“Green Flame Territorial Lord!”

Jian Wushuang called out as his magnificent voice resounded vigorously throughout heaven and earth before naturally spreading toward the huge camp ahead.

The camp immediately went into a commotion and a few figures soon rose into the void with a ragged silver-haired old man in a loose robe leading. The silver-haired old man was none other than the Green Flame Territorial Lord.

The Green Flame Territorial Lord noticed Jian Wushuang as soon as he appeared in the void.

“Carrying a longsword while wearing golden robes... You must be the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, Jian Yi.” The Green Flame Territorial Lord folded his hands and looked at Jian Wushuang with a somewhat condescending attitude.

“I’m indeed Jian Yi. I’ve also heard about you, Green Flame Territorial Lord, and always wanted to visit you, but something unfortunate came up. My apologies that you had to make the trip instead.” Jian Wushuang started with a friendly greeting before going into a serious tone. “However, I would have welcomed you if you’re visiting alone, but I’m afraid it’s too much for you to bring along five army battalions.”

“Don’t get me wrong. I heard there’s a huge Blood Gem mineral vein in the Star Fire Wilderness and am worried it might fall into the wrong hands, hence I came forth with my people to protect this area while you’re away,” said Green Flame Territorial Lord with a smile.
