4732 The First Battle in the Heavenly Realm

Jian Wushuang patted the monster’s broad hairy back helplessly, “Can I say no? More than half of the fish went into this guy’s stomach.”

“No, you didn’t eat any less than this big guy. You should put in more effort when it comes to snatching the Peach,” the Young Emperor said seriously.

“It’s tough to put food on the table,” Jian Wushuang said leisurely, which was considered an agreement.

After that, the two humans and one beast continued to travel leisurely through the Heavenly Realm.

At this moment, the Elders in the Heavenly Court who were watching the scene in the Heavenly Realm all had strange expressions. Even Zhen Wuyang, who was on the Emperor’s throne, twitched his mouth.

What was originally an extremely tense fight for the Peach had suddenly turned into a road to survival for the two of them?

‘My Heaven Hanging Wood… This kid just lit it up to be used as fire to roast fish.” Zhen Wuyang’s heart was bleeding. The Heaven Hanging Wood was the top raw material for the creation of the Heavenly Court, and it could not grow in the Heavenly Realm without the fate energy of an Emperor.

And now, the Heaven Hanging Trees growing in the Heavenly Realm were all cleared by the Young Emperor and burned to the ground just to roast fish…

However, when he saw that the Young Emperor’s face was no longer gloomy, Emperor Zhen Wuyang suppressed his complaints and began to look at the two-person group with interest.

“Young Emperor, is he not taking this seriously?” In the Heavenly Court, some of the Elders could not help but discuss in low voices.

“I can’t say for sure. From the looks of it, the Young Emperor doesn’t seem to want to fight for the Immortal Peach.”

“In my opinion, the Young Emperor’s actions are a wise one. It shows your brother’s demeanor and humility.”

“If you keep talking, I’ll punish you to go to the Heavenly Realm and look after the Heaven Hanging Wood for me!”

The Heavenly Court was silent.

Sitting on the monster ape’s back, Jian Wushuang looked at the chain iron plate on the monster ape’s neck with a strange expression. “What is that chain iron plate of yours? It can even imprison a Yan Immortal?”

The Young Emperor nodded, “That’s right. Unless you can take that step, none of the Yan Immortals will be able to escape my control.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang felt awkward. If it was not for the imprisoning chains, he would not have been a prisoner for a few days.

The Young Emperor seemed to have noticed the knot in his heart and said, “This is a Supreme Treasure in my Imperial Father’s hands. It’s called the Sky-Devouring Lock. My Imperial Father gave it to me when I took over the Six Heavens Realm. Also, it wasn’t me who trapped you at that time. It was those blind little bastards.”

Jian Wushuang did not take what happened to heart. After all, he had been a prisoner for less than a day and he had eliminated a Yan Immortal without suffering a great loss.

However, he was curious about where he was caught.

Before Jian Wushuang could open his mouth to ask, an indescribable sense of life-and-death crisis burst forth from his divine sense.

Without thinking, he released Yan power and patted the monster ape’s head.

The monster ape understood tacitly. Its huge body suddenly stopped and then lay on the ground.

A total of more than ten rays of majestic Yan power swept over from all directions, almost brushing past Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor’s heads.

A large area of the forest was cut in half, and a terrifying power exploded.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor stood in the air with cold faces.

If he had been hit by the attack just now, he would have been seriously injured and eliminated on the spot.

Then, 11 powerful Yan Immortals appeared and looked at the two of them with strange expressions.

“A bunch of trash, you dare to hurt me in the Heavenly Realm?” The Young Emperor’s face was dark and his eyes were dark. If it was not for Jian Wushuang, he would have been severely injured even if he did not get eliminated.

The leader was a Yan Immortal, the one who had previously talked big outside the Heavenly Gate, Fujie. At this moment, he was holding a horsetail whisk in his hand, looking like an Immortal.

He did not care about the Young Emperor’s insults. Instead, he smiled and said, “I’m sorry for offending you, but I had no choice. I hope you can quit voluntarily so that we don’t have to fight.”

The Young Emperor’s eyes were cold. “Did the Prince send you here?”

Fu Jie did not speak. Instead, he flicked his horsetail whisk and said softly, “Young Emperor, please withdraw now to avoid a big fight.”

“Bastard, you’re looking for death!” he roared in anger. Not only did he not back off when facing the 11 Yan Immortals, he even attacked them!

A thin and long flexible sword stirred the wind and clouds, bringing with it a supreme power that pressed down on Fujie.

A look of disbelief flashed in Fujie’s eyes. He then laughed coldly and the horsetail whisk in his hand covered the sky, “Everyone, attack.”

The horsetail whisk expanded a million feet in the wind and descended with a bearing as it swept away.

At the same time, the other 10 Yan Immortals moved as well, and a vast amount of Yan power smashed toward the Young Emperor.

He would try his best to make him withdraw from the battle with one strike!

However, in the next moment, an extremely sharp Sword Intent, caught in the wind, suddenly slashed forward like a cloth being torn.

The horsetail whisk that was about to cover the sky was directly cut into two by this Sword Intent that had quietly risen!

The Young Emperor also stabbed out from the crack!

The terror of life and death surged into his heart. Fu Jie subconsciously tilted his head to the side and barely dodged the unparalleled Sword Intent.

A drop of dark red Immortal blood rolled down from the slender cut on his neck, soaking his white robe on his shoulder.

Fujie recovered from his shock and looked at the Young Emperor with eyes full of hatred.

“Don’t hold back, attack with all your might!” he shouted loudly and immediately controlled the horsetail whisk in his hand, which had been cut off by an inch, to attack.

The Young Emperor stood where he was fearlessly. A Dark Domain with him as the center spread out like vines.

Fujie, whose mind was clouded by hatred, did not notice the slight change in the air around him. He spread his halberd and was about to smash it at him.

However, the air around him seemed to have become muddy, and he felt that the release of Yan power in his body had slowed down.

The other Yan Immortals had the same feeling.

Time seemed to have stretched on for a very long time. Fujie felt that he had been gliding in the air for a very long time, but he had yet to land.

The Young Emperor’s gloomy face gradually enlarged, and at the same time, a figure holding a broken sword slowly appeared. His cold eyes were exactly the same.

“No, why are there two Young Emperors?!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

What responded to him was a Sword Intent that was almost terrifying to the extreme.

Each of the multi-colored swords reflected a seven-colored radiance in the air. The brilliant rainbow shadows connected with each other and carried an endless killing intent as they all slashed toward Fujie.

The Yan Immortal’s body exploded in an instant.

With just one sword move, a Yan Immortal’s body was cut in half!

Fujie’s Immortal body shattered and turned into dust. At the same time, a pill-sized Immortal Source escaped from it and fled in a panic.

The Young Emperor clenched his fist from a distance, and the surrounding space rippled. It was like an invisible hand that directly took the Immortal Source back.
