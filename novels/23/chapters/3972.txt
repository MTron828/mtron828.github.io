Sensing the killing intent of the Devil Cloud Star Master, the Rulers under him all trembled.

They had been under the Devil Cloud Star Master for many years, and over the years, they had developed an instinctive fear toward him.

Immediately, the two strongest divine generals amongst the ten Rulers moved.

The two divine generals were extremely fast. They flew through the void and rushed into the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation.

The Divine Beginning Realm also reacted immediately. Jian Wushuang had 41 servants, including the Devil Flame, who were all third-level experts brought back from the Eternal Dark Prison, among them, 36 formed an Immortal Dipper Battle Formation to block divine Shi Hua Divine Emperor, and the Ruler Spark was responsible for coordinating the two battlefields. However, there were still four servants left and they rushed out at once.

However, because Devil Cloud Star Master was fleeing toward the camp of Devil Cloud Star, he was closer to the two divine generals, so the two divine generals had already rushed into the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation, they immediately stood in front of Jian Wushuang.

“You’re courting death!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and filled with a shocking killing intent. He slashed out with the Wu Qi divine sword, and the obscure sword formation immediately took shape.

Before the battle began, Jian Wushuang had used the hazy sword formation to kill one of the divine generals under the command of the Devil Cloud Star Master. At that time, he had not used the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation.

Now that he had the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation, it would be easy for him to kill the two divine generals even if he fought one against two.

However, no matter how easy it was, it would take some time. The Devil Cloud Star Master had used this short time to escape to the edge of the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation. Meanwhile, Shi Hua Divine Emperor was fighting with the Immortal Dipper Battle Formation, he was constantly approaching Devil Cloud Star Master.

“Shi Hua, quick, faster!” Devil Cloud Star Master was burning with anxiety.

He knew that as long as he could delay Shi Hua Divine Emperor until he reached the array, he would be able to escape with Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s help.

However, Shi Hua Divine Emperor was entangled by the Immortal Gang Battle Array. Although he was approaching him, his speed was very slow.

At that moment…

“Devil Cloud Star Master.” A strange voice suddenly sounded.

In the void in front of Devil Cloud Star Master, a figure appeared out of thin air.

This figure appeared too suddenly, without any warning. There were many experts present, and Jian Wushuang had been suppressing the void with the Divine Demon Heaven Suppression Formation. However, even he…did not realize when this figure entered the formation.

“It’s the Sorcerer God!”

“It’s him?”

“When did the Sorcerer God enter the formation?”

Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, and the others from the Divine Beginning Realm’s camp immediately recognized the figure, but they were all shocked at the moment.

They had been paying attention to the Sorcerer God since the beginning of the war when they found him in the Ruler’s camp of the Devil Cloud planet. However, when the war broke out, the Rulers of the two camps began to fight wildly, they could no longer be bothered with the Sorcerer God. Later, the Rulers of Devil Cloud Star were defeated and only a dozen or so people managed to escape. It was clear that the Sorcerer God did not exist among the dozen or so people.

This made Daoist Xuan God and the others think that the Sorcerer God had died together with the Rulers under the command of Devil Cloud Star.

However, it now appeared that this was clearly not the case. The Sorcerer God had been using a special method to hide in the void of this universe since the very beginning. Furthermore, there were so many experts present, yet none of them had discovered his existence.

Even now, he had appeared within the array formation. If he had not taken the initiative to reveal himself, none of them would have known.

“What is this Sorcerer God trying to do?” Daoist Xuan God and the others were puzzled.

“Sorcerer God?” Even Devil Cloud Star Master was looking at the Sorcerer God who had suddenly appeared in astonishment. Even he did not know how the Sorcerer God had appeared within the array formation.

He also did not know why the Sorcerer God suddenly appeared in front of him under such circumstances.

Could it be that the Sorcerer God wanted to save him from Jian Wushuang?

Could it be possible?

“Tsk, tsk. Master Devil Cloud, as a fourth-level Ruler, you have grasped a principle true treasure and even comprehended a trace of universe principle. Even the universe temple recognized your strength and bestowed you with several secret skills. Who would have thought that you would be forced into such a sorry state by a Principles Master? You are really a disgrace to the universe temple behind you.” The Sorcerer God smiled wickedly, there was clearly a hint of mockery in his words.

“Sorcerer God, how dare you speak to me like this? Are you courting death!?” Devil Cloud Star Master’s voice was ice-cold.

Even though his current situation was extremely miserable, Devil Cloud Star Master had been in a high position all year round and had long been used to being overbearing.

As for Sorcerer God, he was merely a first-tier Ruler. In his eyes, such a Ruler was no different from an ant. If not for the fact that this Sorcerer God was of use to him previously, he would have long slapped him to death.

“Haha, Devil Cloud Star Master, you really don’t know your situation at all. Alright, let me tell you.” The Sorcerer God sneered and stopped laughing. He looked at Devil Cloud Star Master again, but he said word by word, “Devil Cloud Star Master, listen carefully. From today onwards, your divine body, your cultivation base, your Devil Cloud Star, including the Divine Beginning Realm that you have taken over, everything about you will…be mine.”

“What did you say?” Devil Cloud Star Master was shocked.

However, before Devil Cloud Star Master could react, the Sorcerer God, who was standing in front of him, had a hollow look in his eyes. His divine body started to wither. In just a blink of an eye, he had turned into a dried corpse, he fell powerlessly into the void below.

This scene shocked all the experts present. However, they immediately discovered that even though the Sorcerer God’s divine body was withering and falling, a majestic soul body was left behind. This soul body was extremely powerful, it was like a blazing flame that instantly charged toward Devil Cloud Star Master.

“This is…”

The moment he saw this spirit body charging toward him, Devil Cloud Star Master had already reacted. He had already understood what the Sorcerer God intended to do. His face was filled with shock and fury as he frantically tried to stop this spirit body.

However, this spirit body was not affected in the slightest. It directly entered Devil Cloud Star Master’s divine body.

The next moment —

“Ah!”

A hysterical roar was emitted from Devil Cloud Star Master’s mouth. Devil Cloud Star Master’s expression was as if he had gone mad. He squatted down in extreme pain.

“No! No!”

“Get out, get out!”

Mournful roars were continuously emitted from Devil Cloud Star Master’s mouth. His voice was filled with pain.

However, the further he went, the lower his voice became, and the weaker it became.

“Spare me, Sorcerer God, spare me!”

“I beg you…”

In the end, Devil Cloud Star Master’s mouth emitted terrified pleas for mercy, but his voice became lower and lower.

In the end, his voice completely disappeared, and at this moment, Devil Cloud Star Master had already calmed down once again.
