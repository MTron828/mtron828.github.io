Chapter 652: To Renege on His Own Words

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Such a Heaven-defying Genius.”

The evil lady of the Boundless Demon Sect looked passionately over at Jian Wushuang, “He has such achievements in the Ancient World within 40 years. From now on, he will stay and cultivate in the Eternal World. If enough cultivation resources and treasures are given, he will easily reach the Eternal Realm, even be a Dao Master. Such a genius...”

“But I have promised Mr. Xuan Yi.”

The evil young lady sighed.

She was unwilling to do it. But she had promised Xuan Yi in front of so many experts in the Skyward Pavilion. To renege on her promise was humiliating. Besides, this was Xuan Yi to whom she had promised.

She knew how terrifying Xuan Yi was, that was why she dared not to break her promise.

Both the evil lady and the middle-aged man of the Immortal Dynasty were sorry to lose a super genius. However, Shi Qianhan, the black-haired elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard, didn’t care too much.

People on the Drill Grounds were amazed at Jian Wushuang’s cultivation age. Hum~~~ suddenly a mighty power fell on the Drill Grounds.

The Drill Grounds immediately quieted down, geniuses on the Drill Ground shivered and dared not make any noise under the mighty power.

As the mighty power spread, an elder appeared in the center of the Drill Grounds.

It was a sage-like, black-haired and slurry-eyed elder. As soon as he appeared, all people on the ground turned to him, realizing where the mighty power came from.

“I’m Shi Qianhan, the Ninth Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard!” Shi Qianhan looked over at Jian Wushuang, said slowly, “Jian Wushuang, I came personally to invite you to join the Cloud Sea Asgard. You will have equal access to the cultivation resources with Gong Chao. What do you think?”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The Cloud Sea Asgard had never paid attention to him in the former rounds, even though he had performed well.

He didn’t expect that as soon as his cultivation age had been tested in the fourth round, Shi Qianhan would come in person to invite him.

After all he had only invited Gong Chao to join the Cloud Sea Asgard through sound transmission only.

The Drill Grounds were in tumult. Apparently they also hadn’t expected that Shi Qianhan would come in person and offer Jian Wushuang the same as Gong Chao.

It was such a good offer that all of them were envious of the one who received it.

“Cloud Sea Asgard?” Jian Wushuang remembered the information he had read about Cloud Sea Asgard.

Cloud Sea Asgard was one of the three magnates. It was not that far-fetched to call it the most powerful sect in the Firmament Territory.

Normally, the more powerful a sect was, the more cultivating resources and room to grow it had.

Shi Qianhan’s offer was tempting even for Jian Wushuang.

However, before Jian Wushuang answered him, a cold voice sounded, “Shi Qianhan, that’s not a good idea. ”

“As the Ninth Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard, you should not break your promise. Don’t you feel ashamed of being laughed at by other sects?” An arrogant man’s voice followed.

Then two figures appeared at Shi Qianhan’s side at once. They were the arrogant man of the Immortal Dynasty and the evil lady of the Boundless Demon Sect.

“Shi Qianhan, I have heard that you’re not a man of decency. You really aren’t. Don’t you feel embarrassed?” The evil lady sneered at him.

“Hum. It’s none of your business.” Shi Qianhan said in a cold voice.

“Yes. But you have to ask Xuan Yi first.” The evil young lady said with a deep voice.

Immediately another figure appeared at Shi Qianhan’s side. This was Xuan Yi, a purple-robed gentleman with sword-shaped eyebrows.

Shi Qianhan’s face fell after seeing Xuan Yi, then he said with a smile, “Xuan Yi, I promised to give Jian Wushuang up to you without knowing he was an exceptional genius. But now... he is so special that I cannot give him up to you.”

“By the way, such an exceptional genius should have the right to decide himself which sect to join. Don’t you think?”

Shi Qianhan had made up grand reasons for himself, but experts in the Skyward Pavilion all had contempt for his behavior.

He had not spared a glance at Jian Wushuang before.

Therefore, when Xuan Yi said he wanted those young men of the Ancient Worlds, Shi Qianhan agreed not to fight him without hesitation.

Now, after knowing Jian Wushuang’s real strength, he regretted this and changed his mind at once?

Such a shameless person.

Hearing what Shi Qianhan had said, Xuan Yi’s expression didn’t change at all. He took a glance at Shi Qianhan and nodded.

“You’re right, such an exceptional genius surely has the right to decide for himself.” Xuan Yi said.

People around were all astonished at the unexpected words.

They thought Xuan Yi would be angry, but didn’t expect that he was so easily persuaded.

“Jian Wushuang.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xuan Yi looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“Master Xuan Yi.”

Jian Wushuang bowed to Xuan Yi. Xuan Yi was the first Eternal Realm expert in the Firmament Territory and he had given Jian Wushuang the token at the beginning of round three. Therefore, Jian Wushuang respected him.

Before he had shown his real strength, no one but Xuan Yi befriended and sent him an invitation.

That alone had made Jian Wushuang favor Xuan Yi.

“You have heard what was said.” Xuan Yi smiled slightly, “Your talent is high. The Cloud Sea Asgard wants you and has promised you a lot. It’s a good opportunity for you to take a second to consider.”

“The Ancient Sect...”
