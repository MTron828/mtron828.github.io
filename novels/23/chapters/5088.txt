Chapter 5090 Resurrection After Annihilation

Jian Wushuang, once steady and confident from the beginning, had transformed into an indescribable sense of desolation. He felt a surreal sensation about everything that had transpired.

But everything had become unalterable.

Changfu, who had already aged considerably, seemed like an unparalleled mountain in this moment, bearing an unimaginable momentum as he faced the figure in a black robe.

He had become like the very essence of Changfu Mountain, suppressing all oncoming adversaries.

Centered around Changfu, a deep and resounding sound of annihilation rang out.

He restrained the figure in the black robe with his hand, his eyes now burning with fierce determination.

"You are not a Yan Immortal, nor do you belong here."

Leaving behind these last words, Changfu ignited completely, and the foundation of the Yan Immortal, belonging to the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, was utterly annihilated.

The black-robed figure struggled to break free but was utterly powerless.

This was the final thought of the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, capable of causing the demise of even those of the same level.

The detonation of the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal's Immortal Source was terrifying beyond words. Even the residual shockwaves were enough to easily obliterate Grand Yan Immortals, let alone the entire Heavenly Region Plane.

Yet, all the Heavenly Region Planes in the southwest direction of the vast and boundless Great Mi Heaven had already been annihilated, leaving only an eternal emptiness.

Even so, the entire Great Mi Heaven, in its vastness, fell into chaos.

The unimaginable detonation devoured everything in its path.

Countless miles away from the battlefield, Prince Jiu felt an irresistible pressure surging toward him.

His throat tightened, and he was thrown backward once again.

However, miraculously, even on the edge of this destruction, the Sancun Mountain, with only a small portion of its surface remaining, survived unscathed, without any damage.

The complete detonation of the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal continued for an exceedingly long time.

Eternal silence and nothingness became the predominant theme.

"Cough, cough... Is it all over?"

His dark golden armor shattered, and Prince Jiu, in a rather dire state, stood up from the brink of destruction, bitterness in his eyes.

Of the more than 60 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals who had followed him, only over 50 remained. Nearly 20 of them had been reduced to ashes in the detonation.

"Your Highness, let us retreat and seek assistance from the Emperor in the Heavenly Court," a Quasi-Grand Yan Immortal advised in a hushed tone.

"I want to see who dares to retreat!" Prince Jiu coldly shouted, his expression dark. "Until this matter is thoroughly investigated, no one can leave!"

"Yes," all the Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals nodded in agreement, not daring to speak further.

Then, Prince Jiu and his group of Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals rushed toward the center of the detonation.

In the very heart of the detonation, everything seemed to have entered a state of chaos.

Hovering drops of divine blood and tattered clothing fragments all indicated that a fierce and brutal battle had once erupted here.

"Are they all gone?"

As he gazed at the scene before him, Prince Jiu was lost in thought. "Changfu... Is he it really gone?"

Changfu had disappeared without a trace, and the black robe had also vanished completely.

This unparalleled battle seemed to have come to an end.

But at this moment, the keen-eyed Quasi-Grand Yan Immortal behind Prince Jiu noticed something unusual. Wisps of mist-like threads were slowly moving and converging.

"Your Highness, it seems like something's amiss," said the same Quasi-Grand Yan Immortal as before. He felt a palpable sense of unease resurging.

It was still the Quasi-Grand Yan Immortal from before. He felt a palpitating power recovering.

Prince Jiu furrowed his brow tightly and was about to speak when he noticed that at the very center of the explosion, layers of black radiance were gathering!

The black radiance gathered, and a terrifying imprisoning force was once again descending!

Prince Jiu's eyes widened to the maximum; it was an extremely frightening aura!

The black robe! Black robe!

The black robe that had perished alongside Changfu, who sacrificed his Immortal Source, had unexpectedly resurrected.

He was like an undying nightmare, reappearing once more.

Dark purple radiance surged around him, reaching an eerie extreme.

"Retreat!"

Without any hesitation, Prince Jiu frantically retreated. "Retreat quickly!"

But it was already too late. The revived Yan Immortal, with a single palm, obliterated 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortal!

Everything happened too quickly, leaving no time for any reaction.

Nearly 1,000 slender, dark purple beams of light extended from beneath the black robe, forming an all-encompassing net that covered the heavens and the earth.

Then, more than 30 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals were unable to escape in time, imprisoned and bound, and their Yan power was drained to the last drop!

Prince Jiu was horrified, his spirit on the verge of shattering, and he desperately tried to escape.

As a result, out of the over 60 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals who had followed him, only 13 remained!

And this number was still decreasing.

Because the dark purple light was devouring the fate energy too quickly, it was devouring all the Yan Immortals.

Prince Jiu frantically tried to escape but despairingly realized the dense web closing in on him.

Once entangled and devoured, there would be no turning back!

"Damn it, what is this thing?" He gritted his teeth, but there was nothing he could do.

As the last Quasi-Grand Yan Immortal was devoured, Prince Jiu found himself in dire straits.

The web, composed of dark purple thread-like beams, covered the sky, entrapping him completely.

Though he was a Quasi-Grand Yan Immortal, Prince Jiu knew all too well that there was no way out.

However, in this life-or-death moment, a familiar Yan power aura suddenly appeared.

Prince Jiu felt a tug at his waist, and then, at an unimaginable speed, he escaped the encircling web. n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

"Jian, Jian Wushuang?!"

In his shock and relief, he shouted without thinking.

Jian Wushuang glanced back at Prince Jiu, then carried him toward the remaining Sancun Mountain Heavenly Region.

With a 'thud', Jian Wushuang placed him directly on the summit of the divine mountain.

This dwindling Heavenly Region Plane was on the verge of collapse, and the remaining disciples were filled with despair.

The Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo and Nan Xuan had already awakened, recovering 70 to 80 percent thanks to the Emperor-grade pill. However, they were still no match for Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had returned to his peak state. If it weren't for some minor damage to his Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens, no one would have guessed that he had experienced a life-or-death crisis before.

"That guy is coming this way," the Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo rasped.

Nan Xuan held his chest and frowned, saying, "He just won't give up."

Jian Wushuang glanced at the approaching figure in a black robe and then said calmly, "Senior, take them and leave. I'll handle this. I will buy you enough time."

Xu Tuo was momentarily stunned and then shook his head. "How can I retreat?"

"If we don't retreat, we'll all die in vain. I hope you understand that everything started because of me, and I should bear the consequences."

Leaving behind these final words, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate for a moment. He leaped forward to confront the black-robed figure.

"Um, the young man is right. Staying here means dying in vain. Let's go," Nan Xuan urged, then slowly got up.

"I'll go with the young man to buy you some time. You should leave as soon as possible," Xu Tuo said with a heavy heart, watching Jian Wushuang's retreating figure before finally sighing in silence.
