Chapter 74: Three Months

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The whole Earth Temple fell into complete silence immediately when the man showed up.

The middle-aged man sat on the ground and started giving lessons.

What he taught were some concepts and experiences. He occasionally performed a few movements of the Earth Essence Realm.

Every one of the disciples, including Jian Wushuang, listened intently.

It was not long before Jian Wushuang felt puzzled about the lessons. He fell into deep thought.

After an hour, the man stopped teaching. He waved his hands to the people in the palace before all the disciples on the ground left.

Jian Wushuang rose to walk out of the palace slowly. He was in deep contemplation. He did not come out of it until he was far away from the palace.

“Is that it? That’s the reason!”

A flash appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face; his eyes were sparkling like fire. He turned to gaze at the Earth Temple and inhaled deeply.

He was clear that though the middle-aged man had only taught for one hour, Jian Wushuang had still learned a lot. He had also comprehended unknown knowledge about Sword Essence of Earth in his head.

“Perhaps this is why the Four Temples are called one of the Three Treasures of Dragon Palace. It was so helpful to listen to the lessons from the Temple Master.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

Four Temples of the Three Treasures of Dragon Palace did not require many points. Dragon Palace Disciples could listen to their lessons whenever they wanted. But this did not mean the Four Temples were useless. Instead, the Four Temples were sometimes more helpful and larger than the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth and the Secret Pavilion.

“I did not comprehend a lot and had no teachers to ask before. I relied only on myself to cultivate. However, everything I needed is now in front of me. Next I’ll know what achievements I can make.” Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly with eyes sparkling.

From then on, Jian Wushuang was deeply focused on cultivating.

His cultivation was very regular.

When the Temple Masters of the Earth Temple and the Wind Temple in the Four Temples gave general lessons, Jian Wushuang would go and study by himself afterwards. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sometimes he would go to the Martial Arts Practice Field and watch the other disciples’ fights. When he fought with others, he always kept his strength.

As for the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth, he could not go there whenever he wanted. After all, although it was helpful for him to comprehend the Sword Essence there, he would think about the mechanism of it for a long time. Thus, Jian Wushuang went there once every two weeks in general.

Three months passed quickly.

These were the most precious three months for any newcomer.

One must know that almost everyone lacked in good teachers and cultivation resources before going to the Dragon Palace. So they began to learn considerably in the three months.

In the history of the Dragon Palace, some disciples had been ordinary but after the three months they showed significant talent and improved remarkably.

Never mind Jian Wushuang who had woken up his Sword Soul during the three months, how much had he improved?

He was in the manor.

His sword shadow was so swift that it was like lightning in the sky.

A gust of wind passed.

When he stopped performing, the wind died away.

Everything fell into silence.

“No, this movement is still far from perfect.” Jian Wushuang wrinkled his brows in concentration. Though it was fast enough, he was not satisfied with the movement he had just performed.

“I have completely grasped the fourth movement of the Formless Swordsmanship but the fifth is still wrong.”

The fourth movement of the Formless Swordsmanship was named A Hundred Variations, which he had completely grasped in two months. But the fifth… It was much more difficult than the fourth.

“The first three movements of the Formless Swordsmanship were very complicated while the middle three movements were even more difficult. Never mind the last three movements. That’s why the Formless Swordsmanship is renowned as the greatest Sword Skill in Tianzong Dynasty.”

Although the Formless Sword Wave was also a sword skill, it only took him two hours to completely grasp all of the first seven movements and perform the first six movements on the ground.

But the Formless Swordsmanship was much more complicated than the Formless Sword Wave. He had completely comprehended the fourth movements after three months. However, he did not understand the fifth.

“Wushuang.”

Wang Yuan hastily came in with his raspy voice and Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou followed him.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang turned to look at them.

Wang Yuan approached Jian Wushaung and breathed for a while before he said, “Nangong Jie has gone through the Dragon Gate Pass.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised but immediately said with a faint smile, “which level did he pass?”

“The Sixth.” Wang Yuan looked serious and said, “as we know, he has passed the sixth in less than an hour. It will not be long before he goes through the seventh, but he will stay there for a long time before he advances further.

“Three months ago, I knew he could pass the sixth, but he did not try until today. It was obviously deliberate for him to go through the sixth today when you will fight with him. I think he was afraid you might flee away if he did so earlier.” Yang Zaixuan said.

Timid Su Rou, who had been speechless, added, “There’s a threshold between the sixth and the seventh Dragon Gate. The level keeper of the seventh is much stronger than that of the sixth. He could fight with the level keeper of the seventh, which means he is very strong.”

Jian Wushuang listened carefully and he nodded slightly.

Indeed, it was not a big deal for him to go through the sixth because they had already known he could pass it. But it was completely different for him to fight with the level keeper of the seventh.

“Nangong Jie’s capacity to understand the Sword Essence is the best even among the disciples who have gone through the sixth.” Yang Zaixuan said.

“Wushuang, what’s your plan?” Wang Yuan turned to look at him.

“All I can do is take measures according to the actual situation.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You have a big heart.” Wang Yuan rolled his eyes.

Jian Wushuang smiled. He did not feel anxious.

He had passed the sixth level in Dragon Gate and fought sharply for a long time with a seventh level keeper. So what?

“So What?”

I’m not shocked by that at all.

It’s funny!

It was because he had not gone through the Dragon Palace for three months. Otherwise it was Nangong Jie who had to worry now.

“You three can talk while I have to go to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth once more.” Jian Wushuang said. He left to go to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.

Wang Yuan and the others watched Jian Wushuang’s back from afar. They were worried.

“Wushuang must be anxious. That’s why he is going to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. I am afraid he’s not confident about fighting with Nangong Jie.” Wang Yuan said seriously, “I hope Nangong Jie will not bet too many points. Otherwise it’ll be your turn to win back the points for Wushuang.”

“I do not mind fighting with him. But I am afraid Nangong Jie dares not to fight with me,” Yang Zaixuan said in a cold voice.
