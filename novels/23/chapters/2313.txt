Chapter 2314 Crush

“Brat, since you want to die, I’ll grant your wish!” Intense bloodlust rose from Zhuge Hong.“Just come at me with all you got.” On the other hand, Jian Wushuang was still maintaining a gentle smile. He even taunted Zhuge Hong by wiggling his index finger intentionally.

Zhuge Hong darted forward instantly. Intense divine power surged from all parts of his body as he morphed into a bolt of lightning.

The bolt of lightning shot out abruptly and left afterimages on the drill ground.

“How quick!”

“This speed is insane!”

Several Lin Mansion disciples couldn’t help but exclaim.

That ferocious bolt of lightning reached Jian Wushuang in no time and Zhuge Hong slashed down his faint purple sabre towards Jian Wushuang.

The sabre glow was eerie and about to split Jian Wushuang into two.

Just before the sabre glow was about to connect, Jian Wushuang took a step out. At the same time, he lowered his stance slightly and swung up his finger in momentum.

A simple swing carried with it immense secrets which no one on the field could decipher.

However, they could see Jian Wushuang was intending to use his index finger to clash with Zhuge Hong’s sabre!

“How bold! Watch how I sever your hand off!” Zhuge Hong berated and increased his strength in his sabre skills.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang’s right index finger clashed with that eerily cold sabre glow.

The surrounding crowd was staring deadly.

Most of them believed Jian Wushuang’s finger would be sliced off by that eerie sabre in the clash.

However...

Dang!

They heard sounds of metal clashing instead. Zhuge Hong was astonished and felt a barbaric and powerful strength exerted on him.

The next moment, something unbelievable happened before everyone.

That eerie faint purple sabre cracked upon contact with Jian Wushuang’s right index finger and eventually broke into two.

“How is this possible?”

Zhuge Hong stared in disbelief.

Although his sabre wasn’t some frightening divine weapon, it was a true and true terrestrial treasure with high value. Its toughness was easy to imagine.

Using all his strength, he clashed with Jian Wushuang’s index finger directly. In the end, Jian Wushuang’s index remained unscathed but his sabre had cracked and broken?

What kind of joke was this? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as Zhuge Hong was still reeling in shock, Jian Wushuang swung his finger once again. This swing triggered some unique energies in the space and easily break through Zhuge Hong’s defense. The next instant, Jian Wushuang’s index finger was on Zhuge Hong’s chest.

Immense divine power shot out and pierced Zhuge Hong’s chest, leaving a bloodied wound.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang didn’t go for the kill. Otherwise, this strike would definitely have extinguished Zhuge Hong’s life completely.

Pfft!

Zhuge Hong spat out blood and flew back like a kite that was not held back by a string.

The grey-robed old men, who had been behind him all along, dashed ahead and caught Zhuge Hong.

“You have lost.”

Jian Wushuang stood on the drill ground and said nonchalantly.

Silence shrouded the drill ground.

Death-like silence.

After some time, the crowd in the drill ground finally reacted to it.

“Won! We won!”

“Isn’t Zhuge Hong supposed to be incredible?” How did he get defeated so easily then?”

“Using a finger as a weapon, Zhuge Hong’s terrestrial treasure weapon was crushed in a single tap. In the next tap, Zhuge Hong was severely injured. This...”

“Strong! Too strong!”

“Terrifyingly strong!”

The shock gazes of the crowd gathered on Jian Wushuang.

Even those experts of Lin Mansion were incomparably astounded.

Some of them knew Jian Wushuang had an extremely high understanding of Sword Principle and might be able to defeat Zhuge Hong. However, they had never expected Jian Wushuang would crush Zhuge Hong so utterly.

Even Lin Yan was dumbfounded.

Previously, he was still reminding Jian Wushuang to be careful.

Now, that was just a hilarious act.

Although Zhuge Hong was powerful, he was nothing before Jian Wushuang.

As compared to the astonishment and joy of Lin Mansion, Zhuge Hong, who was defeated by Jian Wushuang, was dazed. His eyes were empty and couldn’t believe what had happened.

Indeed, he had never expected Jian Wushuang to defeat him before the battle, let alone crushing him so utterly.

He was a true talent that even the Dongzuo Sect had high regard for. This made him extremely prideful and he had always looked down on some cultivators of his age.

But today, the pride in him was ruthlessly trampled by Jian Wushuang.

Just like what Jian Wushuang had said to Lin Yan, he was going to crush Zhuge Hong’s confidence and make him doubt himself forever.

And now, Jian Wushuang probably succeeded.

Before the watchful eyes of the crowd, the prideful and arrogant Zhuge Hong was crushed by Jian Wushuang. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was using his finger as a sword and broke his weapon with a single tap. This made him realize the humongous gap between them that could never be bridged. More importantly, Jian Wushuang was younger than him... Much younger... This made it harder for him to accept.

A blow like this was undoubtedly huge for Zhuge Hong.

With this blow, Zhuge Hong’s future would likely be affected unless he could find back his confidence within a short period and stood back up. Otherwise, Jian Wushuang might even become the heart demon that he could never shake off in this lifetime.

“That young master of the Zhuge Family had probably snapped when he couldn’t accept the fact he had lost to me so completely. For his good, it would be best if you bring him back as soon as possible.” Jian Wushuang looked at the grey-robed old man and said with a faint smile.

The grey-robed old man gloomed upon hearing.

However, seeing the empty eyes of Zhuge Hong, he knew this attempt to sound out Lin Mansion couldn’t continue. The most pressing thing to do was to send Zhuge Hong back and help him regain his consciousness.

Without hesitation, the grey-robed old man carried Zhuge Hong and left.

Before he left, he even looked daggers at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt helpless over this.

He knew he would definitely be dragged into the conflict between the Zhuge Family and Lin Family after he stepped in this time. In fact, that grey-robed old man and Zhuge Hong might even pay more attention to him. However, he didn’t mind. After all, his father, Zhuo Yunfeng, had a close relationship with the Lin Family. There was no way he would stay out of this.

“Different situations call for different actions. I have even faced three Masters of Holy Land! An insignificant Zhuge Family is nothing compared to a Master of Holy Land!” Jian Wushuang chuckled.
