Chapter 1324: An Explosive Roar!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Universe God Jiu Hai had complicated feelings.

He wished to kill Jian Wushuang, but he was afraid that he wasn’t Jian Wushuang’s match.

He watched Jian Wushuang as he underwent God’s Test. He passed through such a terrifying God’s Test, then he broke through and became a Universe God in the First Heaven. His power definitely increased tremendously.

“I am a Universe God in the Second Heaven and there are so many people gathering around. Regardless, I can’t be intimidated by a Universe God in the First Heaven who just passed the God’s Test,” Universe God Jiu Hai clenched his fists and his eyes were glistening with determination. He had obviously made a decision.

“Jian Wushuang, this is what you asked for,” Universe God Jiu Hai looked towards Jian Wushuang again.

“Come on,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly with confidence.

The surrounding crowd saw and made space for it to be a battlefield.

In the void, before the gaze of various Universe Gods, Jian Wushuang was standing face-to-face with Universe God Jiu Hai.

Universe God Jiu Hai was beaming with a strong murderous intention as he glared at Jian Wushuang, “He’s just undergone God’s Test and the divine power in his body should have started transforming. The overall increment in power shouldn’t be too vast. However, he has quite a number of trump cards. I can’t give him any chance to play one.”

“I shall use my strongest power and kill him straight away with Thunder Power!”

Universe God Jiu Hai thought clearly and quickly made a move.

Vroom!

A vast expanse of divine power surged out from Universe God Jiu Hai’s body and it formed a huge crimson ocean that instant. The boundless divine power flowing insanely within crimson ocean while Universe God Jiu Hai flipped his palm and a crimson long spear appeared in his hand.

Universe God Jiu Hai moved his wrist and the crimson long spear parted the surrounding ocean. When he took a stride, he instantly moved across a far distance and appeared before Jian Wushuang. The crimson long spear became a crimson, flowing light and plundered forward.

The very moment the crimson long spear plundered forward, the ocean with omnipotent divine power gathered at an unbelievable speed. In the end, the boundless power of the divine power ocean flowed into the long spear and the power of the long spear increased tremendously!

“This is the strongest spear I’ve created through my cultivation for a long time!”

“Jian Wushuang, die!”

Universe God Jiu Hai shrilled. The long spear let out a billowing force at that very moment and everyone was astonished.

“Such strong power!”

“He lived up to his position as the Master of Jiu Hai Mansion. Although he is the last among all four Mansion Masters in Holy Prefecture, he was a Universe God in the Second Heaven after all!”

“Universe God Jiu Hai pulled the strongest unique skill right at the beginning?”

Universe God Jiu Hai didn’t show mercy at all.

He wanted to let out his strongest power right at the beginning so that Jian Wushuang couldn’t perform any trump cards in time.

His thinking was sound but unfortunately, he underestimated Jian Wushuang’s power.

In the void, Jian Wushuang stood calmly as he watched the crimson flowing light charged towards him coldly. Then, he creased his eyebrows slightly.

“This spear, feels… so weak.”

Jian Wushuang stood there without moving an inch. He didn’t look like he was going to block the attack. He let the crimson flowing light charge at his chest.

“You’re asking for death!”

Universe God Jiu Hai saw and gave an explosive roar as he laughed coldly in his head.

The very next moment, the crimson flowing light hit on Jian Wushuang’s chest straight away without hindrance.

Clash!

The noise of metal clashing against each other was heard.

The power that the crimson flowing light contained exploded entirely. The ferocious divine power pressed on the surface of Jian Wushuang’s Blood-killing Plate Armor and constantly made noises, but Jian Wushuang’s body didn’t move.

Very soon, the crimson, flowing light exhausted and dispersed. In the end, there was a crimson long spear stabbed on Jian Wushuang’s chest.

Universe God Jiu Hai opened his eyes wide then.

“How, how is it possible?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Universe God looked at the sight before him in shock.

The strongest spear he had used with his all hit Jian Wushuang without any hindrance. But in the end, Jian Wushuang didn’t even move an inch.

From the beginning till the end, Jian Wushuang didn’t move at all.

One must know, even if Jian Wushuang’s divine body could resist his attack, the impact of his long spear should cause Jian Wushuang to move back but he didn’t even move an inch. In other words, Jian Wushuang’s divine body was stronger beyond his imagination. It was so strong that he could ignore the impact that the long speak instilled.

His strongest spear might only be a scratch or an itch to Jian Wushuang.

“Universe God Jiu Hai, your strongest power is merely at such a level?” Jian Wushuang overlooked coldly.

“I…” Universe God Jiu Hai was speechless in astonishment.

“Too weak!”

Jian Wushuang shook his head, “With power of such?a level, you aren’t even qualified to be killed in my hand.”

“Go away!!!”

The divine power and Ancient God Power in Jian Wushuang’s body erupted. The roar came out from his Ancient God mouth and it suddenly shook the earth!

Rumble. A tremendous noise broke out in the universe.

Universe God Jiu Hai bore the brunt naturally as he was right in front of Jian Wushuang. The terrifying sound wave brought about an unbelievable impact and hit Universe God Jiu Hai directly. His ears, nose and mouth were instantly bleeding, while all over his body and organs got severely injured. He was shot backwards like a cannon. Even the crimson long spear in his hand flew off.

Universe God Jiu Hai stood on his feet again. He just stood up and he immediately spat a mouthful of blood again. He lifted his head and stared at Jian Wushuang. His eyes were full of terror!

The surrounding spectator was in awe.

They knew that Jian Wushuang who underwent the terrifying God’s Test definitely would have a tremendous improvement in power but no one expected it to be so great.

His divine body could resist Universe God Jiu Hai’s strongest spear without moving an inch!

Just an explosive roar led to severe injury of Universe God Jiu Hai.

How scary his ability was.

“His defensive skill was strong originally. Previously when he underwent the God’s Test, he relied on his divine body to resist three lightnings. Once he passed the God’s Test, the divine body naturally improved tremendously. To be able to resist Universe God Jiu Hai’s full blow with his divine body only, I can accept that. But with an explosive roar, he caused Universe God Jiu Hai’s severe injury. That is a little unbelievable!” The Master of Scarlet Island said in astonishment.

“It’s divine power.”

The Master of Dayu Palace who stood in the void, his pupil contracted, “In his explosive roar, it contained a fierce divine power. With the strength of the divine power, if I didn’t see it wrongly, I reckon he has reached the level of Peak Universe God of the Second Heaven!”
