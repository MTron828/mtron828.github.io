Chapter 2170 Golden Armour

Emperor Bai looked at the blood-red formation coldly and muttered, “I do not need to know what this formation does. All I have to do is destroy it.”As soon as he finished speaking, an incredibly powerful aura started to erupt.

At this moment, he took a step out.

Boom~~~ An endless ocean of golden divine power surged out and covered the entire sky. The battlefield turned into a large golden divine power sea.

Emperor Bai was located at the centre of this ocean as a ten thousand foot tall golden shadow appeared behind him.

The giant golden shadow hovering over the battlefield was majestic and made people feel dread when looking at it.

Within moments, Emperor Bai appeared in front of the blood-red formation.

He clenched his fist and harnessed the power of the endless divine power sea within his hands.

“Haha, Emperor Bai. Do you wish to destroy the formation? You’ll have to pass me first.”

Kaiser Blood blood laughed as he blocked Emperor Bai before he could attack the formation.

“I shall kill you first, then I will destroy the formation.” Emperor Bai said in a dominant way.

Emperor Bai punched his fist, which was encompassed in divine power, at Kaiser Blood.

This punch immediately made a gigantic hole in the sky. The aura was so terrifying that the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World widened their eyes.

As the most powerful man from the Eternal Chaotic World, how strong could Emperor Bai?

They were seeing it with their own eyes.

“The aura really is terrifying. If that is the case…” a flash of seriousness went across Kaiser Blood’s eyes as he pointed with his finger.

Instantly, a large amount of blood-red light surged as a giant statue of a divine demon appeared.

This statue was even larger than the golden shadow behind Emperor Bai. It radiated an ancient aura.

A few deep bell sounds were heard as the hands of the statues moved.

One hand turned into a fist while the other hand turned into a palm.

The blood-red fist, which contained an enormous amount of power, dropped from the sky as it punched out. If felt like it could destroy everything in its way.

The palm turned large as it covered the entire sky, including the divine power sea.

The fighting power of Kaiser Blood was clearly seen there.

In the air, Emperor Bai collided with the large statue head on.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Nine loud collisions were heard.

Each of these collisions made the divine power and the blood-red energy explode outwards in all directions.

These energies turned into a storm that strangled everything in its way.

At the centre of the storm, where the two men fought, the space turned into nothing. An area of void was formed.

In that void, two figures stood tall.

The aura of Emperor Bai was still overpowering. The golden light from the golden shadow became even brighter as the dense divine power sea surged even more.

As for Kaiser Blood, his gigantic statue was much less intimidating compared to Emperor Bai.

“You are worthy of being called the strongest man in the Eternal Chaotic World. I have already displayed the fighting power of a top tier stage great emperor but I still lost to you despite you having weaker understanding of Rules of Order. It must be because of your incredible inverse cultivation.” Kaiser Blood smiled.

Emperor Bai did not speak as he looked at the blood-red formation behind Kaiser Blood.

During the short exchange of blows with Kaiser Blood, the aura that radiated out affected the formation.

However, the formation was completely unaffected. It seemed like the formation could not be destroyed with just the aura emitted during a fight.

“Emperor Bai, you must really want to destroy this formation. But you will not be able to do it. Even though I am weaker than you, I can still stop you from doing what you want.”?Kaiser Blood mocked.

“Is that the case?” Emperor Bai raised his eyebrows. At that moment, the divine power sea started to collapse on itself and covered Emperor Bai. His body started to grow to a hundred feet tall.

His large body was surrounded by a thick layer of golden light.

This golden light was like extraordinary golden armor. The moment it appeared, the overpowering aura Emperor Bai had started to skyrocket once again. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Golden armour? This is the Nine Star Armour from one of the secret skills that the Seven Star Black Sect had. You successfully cultivated this secret skill?”

“Furthermore, you cultivated the golden armour scripture?”

Even Kaiser Blood was shocked when he saw the golden armour that Emperor Bai was wearing.

He was originally an expert from the Ancient Past. He had participated in the Great Battle of the Ancient Past and was very knowledgeable about secret skills.

On the ancient battlefield, there were countless experts. However, the main character of that battle was Seven Star Black Sect!

Seven Star Black Sect had been one of the superpowers from back in the Ancient Past.

This kind of superpowers had many extremely powerful secret skills.

The Secret Skill of Seven Star was a famous secret skill.

This Secret Skill of Seven Star was only one of most powerful secret skills the sect had. Nine Star Armour was another secret skill on par with Secret Skill of Seven Star in terms of power level.

It was one of the secret skills that could make the experts from the ancient past go crazy.

It was a pity that this secret skill was incredibly valued by the leaders of the sect. Besides some core disciple, no one had the chance to learn it.

There was no talk at all about this skill as it was kept top secret.

However, Emperor Bai had managed to successfully cultivate Nine Star Armour and reached the level of Golden Armour Scripture, which was high level.

“Humph. I want to see if you can still stop me.” Emperor Bai grunted as his battle power reached a whole new level.

If his power level had been between stage three and stage four previously, his power level now was definitely of a stage four great emperor.

“Fight!” Emperor Bai roared in anger as he continued the attack. No matter his aura or momentum, both reached an even higher level.

Seeing this, Kaiser Blood turned pale.

In the space not too far away, Lord Fen squinted his eyes before charging into the battlefield to assist Kaiser Blood.
