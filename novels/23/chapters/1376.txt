Chapter 1377: Tian Ling Mystery Land

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Tian Ling Mystery Land was one of the four mystery lands of the Lineage of Star, but the wormhole for entering the land was outside the base of the Lineage of Star, in a place called Cloud Island.

The Cloud Island was the biggest wormhole and it connected to the most places in Star Land.

It provided access to all parts of the Purple Moon Sanctuary and other cultivation places.

The Cloud Island brought tremendous amounts of profits to the Lineage of Star.

Thousands of cultivators of different levels gathered there, including Real gods and Universe Gods.

“Master, how long will you have to wait? We have been here for almost one year.” A tall man in purple armor asked an elder with brown hair.

The elder with brown hair was a Real God and the other five, including the young man, were Universe Gods.

“We should wait for longer for other cultivators to join us in the Crystal Land. Now we only have thousands of cultivators and only three Real Gods. But we still can’t afford the price for the wormhole to the Crystal Land. We should be patient and wait.” The elder sighed.

The young man murmured, “Just a wormhole is so expensive. How greedy the Lineage of Star is!”

“Shut up! Do you know what you are talking about?”

The man also realized his offense. He looked around nervously and was relieved that nobody was paying attention to him.

“Be careful not to offend the Lineage of Star. I can’t save you if you get into trouble. By the way, you don’t know the cost of opening a wormhole to the Crystal Land. It is extremely expensive.”

So the disciples all kept silent.

Whoosh!

At that moment, a figure flashed through the heavens and caught the attention of the brown-haired elder and his disciples.

They saw that a man in a black robe had paid the money needed for opening the wormhole.

“He could pay the fee by himself? How extraordinary!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Just then,

Whoosh!

Almost one hundred Gods flew to palaces at the top of the Cloud Island.

There were four Real Gods. All the rest were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

“The four Real Gods are deacons from the Lineage of Star!”

“Three silver deacons and one golden deacon.”

“What do they come for?”

Other cultivators were curious.

They saw that a young man wearing blood-red robe and carrying a long sword had moved forward.

All Universe Gods and even the four Real Gods bowed to the young man.

“Oh my god!”

“Real Gods bowed to a Universe God in the Second Heaven?”

“Who is the young man?”

“Maybe he is the disciple in the Star Palace!”

All the cultivators in the Cloud Island felt shocked.

So did the five disciples of the brown-haired elder.

“Why can a Universe God in the Second Heaven like me be respected so much by those prestigious deacons in the Lineage of Star?”

Jian Wushuang didn’t care about other’s attention and was surprised. He went toward the palaces following the four deacons.

“We will open the wormhole to the Tian Ling Mystery Land for you.” The golden deacon said.

“Thank you.”

Those who could train inside the Lineage of Star were core members, including disciples and masters.

Besides them, there was another group of talents who lived in the margins, including Universe Gods in the Third Heaven who guarded the Cloud Island and the four deacons.

So their status was lower than Jian Wushuang even though they were already Real Gods.

Soon, the wormhole opened.

“Take the token with you. If you want to leave the Tian Ling Mystery Land, just smash the token.”

“Ok.”

Jian Wushuang entered the wormhole.

Now in the Tian Ling Mystery Land.

Bang!

A space twisted, and Jian Wushuang entered into the Tian Ling Mystery Land through it.

When Jian Wushuang entered into the land, he looked down at the top.

“What a large forest.”

The forest was so boundless that Jian Wushuang couldn’t detect its border with his soul power.

But he felt the breath of organisms there.

Both humans and beasts.

“As for as I know, the Lineage of Star always allows the Tian Ling Mystery Land to follow nature and develop without intervention. There are many talents here.”

“Before I start to cultivate, it’s better for me to get familiar with the surroundings.”

“As for the Tian Ling Crystal, I have to be patient and wait for opportunities.”

Then Jian Wushuang walked down through the boundless forest.

He was now in the land as an outsider.
