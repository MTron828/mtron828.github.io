Chapter 2774: A Point of No Return

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the great hall, the tall and beautiful Yin Su’er stood at the highest area as she excluded extreme pressure.

Underneath her, three other people were standing there apart from Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

Those three were Grand Ultimate Gods and they were extremely loyal towards Yin Su’er. They were people she trusted the most.

“Has the news been confirmed?” Yin Su’er looked downwards.

An elder with white hair among them nodded politely. “Yes, although there’s no conclusion yet, it is a fact that Yun Shan had already started contacting the people from that side.”

“Humph, this old b*stard!!” Yin Su’er’s facial expression turned into a strict one. “There’s no other choice, we have to immediately take action.”

Palace Keeper Si Zhen and the three others also had darkened expressions on their faces.

They knew about Yin Su’er’s helplessness and could also understand her decision.

“Make your preparations. We will take action in ten days!” Yin Su’er said.

“Ten days?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen and the others nodded in seriousness.

After some time, the three others left continuously and only Palace Keeper Si Zhen was left standing there.

“Fort master, should we inform Jian Yi about this right now so that he and his Sword Alliance can make the preparations?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen said.

“We should inform him but you don’t need to do it this time. I will personally talk to him.” Yin Su’er said.

“Alright.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen nodded and also left.

Only Yin Su’er was left in the large hall.

With a flip of her delicate hand, Yin Su’er took a token out and started communication.

“Jian Yi...” Jian Wushuang, who was sitting at the stone table in Sword Alliance’s garden immediately responded.

“The fort master has personally contacted me. This is really rare.” Jian Wushuang smiled playfully.

Normally, his communication with Yin Su’er would go through Palace Keeper Si Zhen but Yin Su’er had directly contacted him this time.

“Jian Yi, there’s something that I need to personally tell you.” Yin Su’er sounded extremely serious.

“You sound so serious, do you plan to take action now?” Jian Wushuang’s expression slightly changed.

“Yes. I’ve given my orders.My people will take action ten days later and our aim is Yun Shan’s faction.” Yin Su’er said.

“Ten days? Isn’t that too soon? Are you extremely well prepared?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“No.” Yin Su’er shook her head. “But we are at a point of no return.”

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang was really puzzled this time. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Although there was a lot going on in the Crimson Stone Fort right now and every faction was preparing themselves with all they had. However, Yin Su’er obviously had the upper hand as she had the support of a huge amount of resources.

Apart from that, she was greatly burdened. It did not matter if she did not take action, she had to be completely prepared once she took action.

However, it seemed irrational for her to proactively take action right now without complete preparation.

“Couple of days ago, my people received news that the old man, Yun Shan, seemed to have received some news that the power I hold right now is much stronger than his so he’s looking for ways to search for external help. Within these couple of days, Yun Shan has already gained contact with Nanwu Palace.” Yin Su’er said.

“Nanwu Palace?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression slightly changed.

Nanwu Palace was only behind the Crimson Stone Fort among the pinnacle forces in the Danyang Continent.

Nanwu Palace Master was even the publicly recognized expert in the Danyang Continent. If Yun Shan’s faction connected with Nanwu Palace and worked together, Yin Su’er’s faction would be placed in a passive position.

“Have they formed an alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not at this moment but Yun Shan shows obvious signs about it. If I continue to wait, he might really join forces with Nanwu Palace and I wouldn’t be the one handling them later on, they will be the ones working together to wipe me out. Hence, I need to take action now and completely wipe out Yun Shan’s faction earlier on.” Yin Su’er said.

“How confident are you to go against Yun Shan’s faction based on your accumulated strength?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“100%” Yin Su’er replied neatly. “Although Yun Shan had accumulated a lot of strength throughout recent years, I’ve accumulated more strength than him. Apart from that, I’ve obtained a huge amount of resources because of you and I’ve won over many helpers with these resources. If no other forces interrupt us right now, Yun Shan’s faction would not be our opponent if only both our factions go to battle.”

“You’re so confident?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had no idea that Yin Su’er would be so capable and have secretly accumulated so much power.

At the same time, he understood why Yun Shan would think of ways to contact the Nanwu Palace.

Yun Shan must have realized that Yin Su’er was too powerful and was trying his best to search for helpers as his faction was not capable of withstanding Yin Su’er.

He was also driven insane by Yin Su’er and went to Nanwu Palace because he had no other way.

“However, although my faction is completely confident in defeating Yun Shan’s faction, there’s another large faction in the Crimson Stone Fort and that is the Blood Thunder King’s faction. I’m not capable of facing both parties at the same time, hence... Ten days later, I need your Sword Alliance to help me stop the Blood Thunder King’s faction. That shouldn’t be a problem, right?” Yin Su’er said.

“Although the Blood Thunder King’s faction have quite a number of Grand Ultimate Gods, they don’t have the support of any Peak Grand Ultimate God. With our Sword Alliance’s current strength, we can handle them.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “However, Blood Thunder King isn’t your only threat this time, right? Based on what I know, Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower, Divine Demon Sect and the Dongfang Clan. These four pinnacle forces had been fixated on your Crimson Stone Fort since a long time ago. Especially recent days...”

“Our Sword Alliance has been stirring things up throughout these few decades in order to pressure these pinnacle forces. However, these pinnacle forces had been tolerating things and they obviously do not want to offend our Sword Alliance. Instead, they had been focusing all their attention on your Crimson Stone Fort. Once anything happens on your Crimson Stone Fort, these pinnacle forces will definitely take action right away.”

“These are four pinnacle forces. Even if the Divine Demon Sect wouldn’t take action because they are badly compromised, the three other pinnacle forces would still be extremely strong if they work together. How can you withstand them if they grab the opportunity when you are in a fight with the Yun Shan faction and both parties are badly wounded?” Yin Su’er, who was on the other side of the token, was silent for some time after Jian Wushuang spoke.

Moments later, Yin Su’er spoke once again. “If the three pinnacle forces, Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower and Dongfang Clan came attacking when I’m battling for my life with Yunshan, both of us would not be able to withstand them. This is also why I’m not fully prepared.”

“That is why my current plan is to carry out a sudden attack ten days later, when Yun Shan is having a secret meeting with the experts under his leadership. I plan to try my best to defeat all the experts in Yun Shan’s faction within the shortest period of time with absolute strength. The best way is to leave no time for those pinnacle forces to react.”
