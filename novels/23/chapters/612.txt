“That bitch must be crazy!” said Emperor Xiao, with anger burning in his eyes.

Leng Rushuang remained silent when she heard that.

At this moment, Leng Rushuang noticed the World Prison beside her. At the same time, she also noticed the existence of Jian Wushuang in the World Prison.

“Is he inside?” With complexity flashing through her face, Leng Rushuang walked towards the World Prison.

In the World Prison, Jian Wushuang was sitting there alone. Numerous giant hands formed into an offensive force, mounting an attack on him. When this force almost approached him, an immaterial power, however, gushed forth from his body, smashing those giant hands easily.

For three years, his World Body had been staying in the World Prison. With his continuous improvement of the World Dao, it became easier and easier to cope with the attacks from the World Prison. Up to now, there was only one last step from completely breaking the World Prison.

“I have a vague sense that I’ve reached the last step, but I still need to work hard to obtain full comprehension of it,” Jian Wushuang frowned.

According to Emperor Xiao, only by fully understanding the first Occult Level of World Dao could he completely break the World Prison. Now, it seemed that he was still a little short of fully mastering the first Occult Level.

“Jian Wushuang.”

A cold voice suddenly sounded.

Jian Wushuang was so familiar with this voice. He immediately looked up at the Void at front and saw a gorgeous fairy-like woman stood there, with a proud, aloof air of nonchalance. He was mesmerized by her every movement.

There was only one such beautiful and cold woman in this world.

“I haven’t seen you for many years. How are you, Miss Leng?”

Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised to see Leng Rushuang again. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I’m going to leave the Ancient World, and I’ll probably never come back,” Leng Rushuang said directly.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang’s brows knitted in thought. She would leave soon, and never come back?

“I have been staying for a long time in the Ancient World, and you are the only person here that I’ve been acquainted with. Or I should say, we’re somewhat friends. Before leaving here, I want to play you a song to remember how we got to know each other.”

Leng Rushuang took a deep look at Jian Wushuang, and then a white jade chair appeared behind her. Leng Rushuang slowly sat down, and then an ancient zither with a pattern of dragon and phoenix?appeared before her.

This scene made Jian Wushuang narrow his eyes.

Unique and marvelous, Leng Rushuang’s melody exerted profound and far-reaching abilities.

During his stay in Tang Dynasty, Jian Wushuang still remembered it when he met Leng Rushuang for the first time. When he lived in her Nature Residence that month,?Leng Rushuang played her zither every day. Influenced by her melody, he had taken several big steps forward within that one month.

Now, Leng Rushuang began playing again...

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang immediately concentrated on it.

After a few moments of silence, Leng Rushuang’s jade-like fingers slowly plucked the strings.

Such a heavenly melody, with magical powers, resounded throughout the World Prison, holding a particular fascination for Jian Wushuang who had been focussed in it for a long time.

The pleasant melody continued to ring. Melodious but slightly sad, it put a bleaker spin on the whole world.

Closing his eyes, he knit his eyebrows slightly.

He could feel the sadness and desolation carried by this beautiful melody, as well as a touch of frustration.

Also, the melody contained marvelous power that attracted Jian Wushuang to keep thinking in the?World Dao regardless.

He had still been a little confused about the first Occult Level of World Dao, but now he was suddenly enlightened and came to an understanding.

There was nothing but silence in the World Prison.

That magnificent melody slowly stopped.

Closing his eyes, Jian Wushuang stood there. As the attacking giant hands had already quieted down, he was involved in the insight of comprehension.

Before him, Leng Rushuang had put her zither away, standing up and taking a deep look at Jian Wushuang. Then she disappeared immediately with her body flashing past the World Prison.

In the huge garden, Emperor Xiao stood there with his hands behind the back. That beautiful yet lofty figure gave him a bow and turned around, backing towards the wormhole and disappearing without a trace.

At the sight of this scene, Emperor Xiao’s face grew gloomy. He clasped his hands and his body was shaking slowly. Nobody had clue what he was thinking.

Buzzing... At this moment, the World Prison established entirely by World Energy suddenly began to tremble violently.

“What happened?” Emperor Xiao immediately looked in the direction of World Prison. As the World Prison had been created by him, he knew about everything happened within the prison. “That little fellow could make such a breakthrough! With the melody played by Rushuang, he even obtained the full comprehension of the first Occult Level of World Dao?”

Under the gaze of Emperor Xiao, that steady and unbreakable World Prison was abruptly affected by another World Energy and then began falling apart. In a blink of an eye, the World Prison had completely melted into World Energy, vanishing from the world.

A figure in a black robe stood in the middle of the World Prison.

“The World Prison is simply a means of applying World Energy. Before this, I thought the combination of World Energy was extremely intriguing, but now I don’t think it is something of a mystery when I fully understood the first Occult Level of World Dao,” said Jian Wushuang, feeling a bit of excitement.

This World Prison was an application of World Dao.

As Jian Wushuang had realized the first Occult Level of World Dao, he could also create a World Prison of the same quality if he wanted. But the World Prison created by him was weaker in range and intensity than that of Emperor Xiao.

“Anyway, I’ve thoroughly understood the first Occult Level of World Dao,” said Jian Wushuang, with a brief smile. “I should thank Leng Rushuang for her help. Without her melody, it wouldn’t be that easy for me to understand the Occult Level.”

“Well, where is Leng Rushuang?”

Jian Wushuang looked around for her, but found nothing but Emperor Xiao.

“Hey, kid!” Emperor Xiao shouted to him at the middle of the garden.

“Emperor Xiao,” Jian Wushuang came before Emperor Xiao and asked. “Is she gone?”
