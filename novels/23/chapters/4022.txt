Chapter 4023: Shock and Anger!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shock and anger!

Jian Wushuang was completely enraged at this moment.

Although he had been on guard against Nine Whiskers from the beginning and had been extra cautious in the fierce battle, Nine Whiskers had been extremely excited as the battle became more and more intense.

This excitement was purely because he had met a real opponent, and Jian Wushuang was the same.

The difference in strength between the two was not big. Nine Whiskers was an Ascetic Cultivator, and it was not easy for him to meet a decent opponent. Not to mention Jian Wushuang, he had not met a decent opponent on his way from the Divine Beginning Realm.

Now that he had finally met him, Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised by his opponent’s strength and methods. Naturally, he felt that they had a mutual understanding.

When Jian Wushuang had severely injured Nine Whiskers, he had intended to stop. He did not want to kill Nine Whiskers.

However, who would have thought that Nine Whiskers would directly kill him. Moreover, he had disguised himself well before he killed him. When he attacked, he even deliberately reminded Jian Wushuang to be careful, which made Jian Wushuang relax his vigilance.

But in the end —

“I was careless.” Jian Wushuang’s heart was cold.

He was indeed careless. Of course, it could also be said that he was too confident in his Earth Guardian Sword Formation.

He was confident that with the earth guardian sword formation, he could withstand Nine Whiskers’s strongest killing move, but he forgot that the Earth Guardian Sword Formation was not truly invincible. In the face of such a soul attack, or an immaterial attack like a soul attack, the Earth Guardian sword formation was unable to withstand it.

In addition, Nine Whiskers had disguised himself very well. He had been a battle-maniac since the beginning. He was so excited to meet a decent opponent that even Jian Wushuang was fooled.

Fortunately, he was at the perfect level of life and his divine power was vast enough to survive the corrosion of the red fog.

If it had been anyone else, they would have died a long time ago.

On the battlefield, Nine Whiskers’s face was ferocious. He looked at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes, but he was sneering in his heart.

“This Blood Sword is only a second-level Ruler, but his strength and means are definitely at the fifth-level. Even I am no match for him. With such a great leap in realm, he must have gotten a great opportunity before. He must have some big secrets. As long as I kill him, I will know what secrets he has.”

Nine Whiskers had always been a fighter. He appeared to be open and aboveboard and wanted to fight Jian Wushuang with strength.

But in fact, his heart was very dark and his mind was clear.

From the moment Jian Wushuang showed his real strength, he had made up his mind to find a way to kill Jian Wushuang.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang was too strong. He could not do anything to him even if he tried his best. He was even heavily injured by his opponent, he had no choice but to use his strongest killing move!

His strongest killing move looked like that extremely terrifying spear move. The power of that Spear move was indeed extremely powerful. There was no doubt about it, but in fact, this terrifying spear move was just a pretense.

His true killing move was hidden under that spear strike. It was the sudden explosion of red mist.

That red mist was a treasure left behind by an Ultimate Ruler in a secret realm of heaven and earth. That Ultimate Ruler was an expert skilled in using poison, that red mist was one of the poisons left behind by that expert.

Only a small part of the poison was enough to kill a fifth-level Ruler. Even an Ultimate Ruler would die if he was accidentally corroded by the red mist.

It was Nine Whiskers’s trump card that had kept him alive for so many years. He had relied on this move to travel around the universe.

Before meeting Jian Wushuang, Nine Whiskers had encountered two real crises. Both times, his opponent was a fifth-level Ruler, who was much stronger than him. In the end, he had relied on this strongest killing move, he had relied on the red fog to successfully kill the two fifth-level Rulers.

Now, Jian Wushuang had also suffered the same move. Seeing the red fog entering Jian Wushuang’s body, he knew that he had won the battle.

Not only did he win, but after Blood Sword died, all his secrets, including the treasures he had left behind and the universe boat, would be his. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

According to his estimation, he would gain more from killing Jian Wushuang than killing the two fifth-level Rulers.

Nine Whiskers could not wait any longer.

Suddenly —

Jian Wushuang, who was standing in front of him, opened his eyes.

“Nine Whiskers, you’re doing well,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“How is that possible?” Nine Whiskers widened his eyes in disbelief. “Even a fifth-level Ruler would die if he inhaled that much fog. How could a second-level Ruler survive?”

Nine Whiskers was puzzled and could not believe it.

But in fact, it was right in front of him.

“I’m not dead, but you are going to die soon.” Jian Wushuang showed no mercy. Boom! Boom! Boom!

Three dazzling golden lights suddenly lit up, and three huge Heaven Suppression Tablets rose up.

The three Heaven Suppression Tablets immediately flew to three different places and combined with each other. Boom! A huge golden formation was formed in an instant.

The Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation immediately activated its power at this moment.

“Is this a suppression-type principle treasure?”

“Three of them?”

Nine Whiskers turned pale with fright.

He was horrified to find that under the golden formation, he was actually enduring a huge suppressive force, which greatly weakened the strength he could exert.

Then, Jian Wushuang struck out with his sword.

Splash!

An endless sea of sword essence swept out at this moment.

The sea of sword essence was vast and boundless, spreading across the entire galaxy.

It was the wave sword formation of the three strongest sword formations created by Jian Wushuang!

Although the wave sword formation was only one of the three sword formations, which Jian Wushuang created to trap and entangle his enemies, since Jian Wushuang obtained the three Heaven Suppression Tablets and was able to activate the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation…he relied on the combination of the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation and the Wavelight Sword Formation.

This Wavelight Sword Formation had undoubtedly become Jian Wushuang’s most powerful killing move!

Even the obscure sword formation, which focused on attacking power, was far inferior to the Wavelight Sword Formation in killing enemies.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had already used the obscure sword formation and the Earth Protection Sword Formation. As for the Wavelight Sword Formation, he had never used it.

Until now, after Nine Whiskers had truly angered him, Jian Wushuang did not hold back any of his strength. In an instant, the Divine Devil Heaven Suppression Formation and the wave light sword formation were perfectly combined.

Jian Wushuang’s strongest killing move was truly displayed in the universe.
