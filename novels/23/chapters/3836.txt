Right!

Although he knew from the start that Lord Wu controlled everything in the Red Cloud World and could be said to be the steward of the Red Cloud World, Lord Wu was clearly not the realm spirit of the Red Cloud World, but a material life form.

Since he was a life form and could control the Red Cloud World for Patriarch Red Cloud, he was undoubtedly a powerful expert.

“My name is Wu,” Lord Wu said indifferently. “If it were many years ago, in the depths of the universe, some people would have known my name.”

“Supreme Wu?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Lord Wu was a supreme expert?

“Now, do you think I have the ability to guide your wife?” Lord Wu looked at him.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang said immediately.

What a joke. A supreme expert could even guide an ultimate Ruler. Although his wife had comprehended a principle and become a Principles Master as soon as her body recovered due to the astral heart, she had only comprehended one principle, but she had only comprehended one principle.

How great was it for a supreme expert to personally guide her and even want his wife to inherit his legacy?

“Lord Wu, how long will it take for my wife to completely inherit your legacy?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well, it depends on your perception. It will take a few hundred years, or maybe two or three thousand years,” Lord Wu said.

Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Rushuang and asked, “Shuang ‘er, what do you think?”

......

“I’m willing to take Lord Wu as my teacher,” Leng Rushuang said.

She did not hesitate.

She was so decisive because she knew her husband’s current strength and how heavy the burden on Jian Wushuang was.

As a wife, she naturally wanted to help Jian Wushuang as much as possible and share his burden.

Now that such a good opportunity was in front of her, she would certainly cherish it.

“Well, we’ll stay here for a while longer.” Jian Wushuang smiled and then looked at Lord Wu. “Thank you, Lord Wu.”

“I’m doing it for myself.” A smile appeared on Lord Wu’s face.

Then, Leng Rushuang went through a simple ceremony of apprenticeship in the Red Cloud World.

After the apprenticeship was completed, Lord Wu began to guide Leng Rushuang on her cultivation path.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the Red Cloud World and continued to increase his strength in the Second Heaven with the help of the numerous opportunities on the island.

In a flash, 400 years passed.

…

Although the Red Cloud World had not opened, the Red Cloud World was not the only opportunity in Crimson Stone Mountain. Therefore, there were still a lot of experts who roamed the mountain all year round.

The depths of Crimson Stone Mountain could even be considered an unexplored region.

Huge blood rocks piled up one after another. In the middle of the pile of blood rocks was a tall old man with a purple horn on his forehead. He was sitting there cross-legged, and right in front of him…were numerous dense secret engravings.

Each of these secret engravings was profound and unfathomable. When they were combined together, they were shockingly a layer of a great array formation.

“Haha, it’s done!”

The tall elder with the purple horn suddenly let out a hearty laugh. As he moved his hand, the secret engravings within the array formation started to flow.

An ancient and dark aura slowly rose up.

“It’s been 160,000 years!”

“Ever since I discovered this array formation 160,000 years ago, other than the 10,000 years when the Red Cloud Tide appeared, I’ve spent most of my time studying and comprehending this array formation. I can tell that behind this array formation is an independent world or an independent heaven and earth secret realm. The independent space or heaven and earth secret realm hidden in the deepest part of Crimson Stone Mountain must be a great opportunity!”

“Therefore, I’ve spent a full 150,000 years studying this formation with all my energy. Now, I’ve finally found a flaw in it, a tiny crack in it. If I follow this crack, I’ll be able to enter the hidden secret realm of heaven and earth, and all the opportunities in it will belong to me!”

The purple-horned, tall old man, Horn laughed maniacally. His eyes were filled with an unprecedented joy.

What was the most important thing about adventuring in the three great battlefields? It was opportunity.

And now, Ruler Horn Horn had spent a full 150,000 years just to barely open a small crack in this formation. In his opinion, he would definitely be lucky enough to get a great opportunity.

He was only a high-level Ruler, and his power wasn’t that great. He hadn’t been able to do as he pleased in this Star Field because he hadn’t gotten any great opportunities before, but now, he saw the hope of a great opportunity. Of course, he was pleasantly surprised and happy.

But suddenly…

Swoosh!

A ghostly black light flashed and disappeared.

The smile on Ruler Horn’s face suddenly froze, replaced by shock and astonishment.

He stared straight ahead of him, where a terrifying black baleful aura was gathering. This baleful aura was countless times denser than anyone else Ruler Horn had ever seen before. This baleful aura…it was too terrifying, so terrifying that Ruler Horn felt suffocated.

Soon after, a black figure slowly appeared in front of him.

He was dressed in pitch-black armor, his skin was tanned, and the surface of his body was suffused with a faint glow. His eyes were as cold as a blade, and wherever his gaze swept past, the laws of the world seemed to crumble, he felt as though he was a devil God from the netherworld.

His cold, blade-like eyes locked onto Ruler Jiao’s body, instantly causing him to feel as though he was in an ice cellar. His body trembled, and the skin on his body twitched. He was even shocked to discover…under the gaze of this black figure, he didn’t even have the strength to raise his hand.

A single gaze, a single gaze, caused him, a high-level chief sovereign, to lose the ability to resist. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Sou!

The Black Demon God’s figure suddenly flashed and appeared in front of the chief sovereign. His large hand directly pressed onto the chief sovereign’s head.

Ruler Horn widened his eyes. He had no ability to resist at all.

Soon after, he discovered that an incredible power was acting directly on his soul.

Ruler Horn’s consciousness instantly dissipated. His soul was completely controlled and watched by the other party.

After a long while, the Black Demon God finally put down his hand. Ruler Horn’s corpse chased after him powerlessly.

“Star Field? Space Battlefield? Crimson Stone Mountain?”

The Black Demon God murmured, but his face gradually emerged with an unprecedented ecstasy.

“It’s the universe, it really is the universe!”

“Haha! Came out, I, Ancient Night Demon King, finally from that damnable place, walked out alive!”

“Ha, ha, ha.”

Crazy and wanton laughter, suddenly reverberated between heaven and earth, a long time did not disperse.
