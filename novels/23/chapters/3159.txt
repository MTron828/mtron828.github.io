“This place is quite lively!”

When the five-meter tall domineering man’s laughter rang out, the entire world was silent.

The three Principles Masters and everyone present stared at the person who had appeared.

After a long while, the three Principles Masters were the first to react. The red-haired handsome man immediately asked, “Who are you?”

“The Temporal Temple, Ba Cang!” The five-meter-tall domineering man said.

“The Temporal Temple?”

“They are from the Temporal Temple?”

A wave of exclamations immediately sounded in the surrounding void.

Although the Temporal Temple, one of the three great Freedom Alliances, was not as famous as the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect in the Divine Beginning World, and the number of experts was far from that many… However, the spacetime divine hall was publicly acknowledged as the most mysterious of the three great Freedom Alliances.

It was not just the three great Freedom Alliances. It was also considered the most mysterious in the entire Divine Beginning World.

The spacetime divine hall specialized in studying the laws of spacetime. All the powerful warriors of the spacetime divine hall were extremely proficient in the aspect of spacetime. For example, many powerful warriors in the Divine Beginning World had astonishing techniques in the aspect of spacetime, many of them came from the Temporal Temple.

However, it was such an enormous and tyrannical alliance. Up until now, other than the people in the Temporal Temple, no one knew where their lair was. No one knew why the Temporal Temple was created. However, since a very, very long time ago…that was when the Divine Beginning World had just opened, the Temporal Temple had already existed.

In terms of ancient times, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect could not compare to the spacetime divine hall.

As for the three great sacred domains of the Third Heaven, they were far less ancient than the spacetime divine hall.

Such a mysterious and tyrannical alliance, in the Divine Beginning World, there was not a single powerhouse who did not feel fear.

This fear was even deeper than the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect.

However, the experts of the Temporal Temple were few and far between. They did not show their faces easily and did not reveal their identities.

Therefore, in the Divine Beginning World, it was common to see experts and geniuses from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance or the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect. However, it was rare to see people from the Temporal Temple.

And now, this five-meter tall domineering man before them was surprisingly from the temporal temple. and judging from his aura, he was one of the Principles Masters of the Temporal Temple!

While everyone was shocked by the identity of the newcomer, the three Principles Masters of the Witch God Sect were shocked by the name of the newcomer.

“Ba Cang? The Temporal Temple’s Master?”

“It’s actually him?”

“H-how did he come here?”

The red-haired handsome man and the other two stared at Ba Cang, their eyes filled with fear.

They were all Principles Masters, but this Ba Cang Master was much more famous than the three of them.

“Master Ba Cang, what happened here should have nothing to do with the Temporal Temple or you, right? I wonder what exactly is the matter, Master Ba Cang?” The red-haired handsome man’s voice was gentle, his attitude was also quite low.

“Hmph, you three Principles Masters actually ganged up to bully a rank four True Saint of our Temporal Temple, and you still say that it has nothing to do with me?” Ba Cang coldly said, and a world-shaking domineering aura wantonly swept out.

The surrounding heaven and earth instantly stirred up a storm.

“This kid is from your Temporal Temple?” The handsome red-haired man was startled.

“Impossible.” Xin Zong said in a low voice, “Before we made our move, we had already thoroughly investigated his background. If we said that he has a certain relationship with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance or even the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect, we would believe it. However, the Temporal Temple… This kid has never had any contact with the Temporal Temple. Since when did he become a member of your Temporal Temple?”

“Hehe, this little fellow is indeed a member of our Temporal Temple. As for when he joined, that has nothing to do with you. If the three of you are sensible, then get lost obediently. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude to you.” The corners of Ba Cang’s mouth were suffused with a cold intent.

“Ba Cang, you are going too far!” The red-haired handsome man’s expression sank, he said in a low voice, “Even though you are strong, the three of us aren’t weak either. We are all Principles Masters, and the three of us can be considered polite to you. Don’t be so shameless!”

Xin Zong and the bewitching old man’s gazes were also incomparably cold.

Ba Cang’s fame was indeed great, but the three of them had only heard of some of Ba Cang’s deeds. They had never truly experienced it before, and they could not help but feel suspicious in their hearts. Furthermore, they were all Principles Masters…they were more or less confident in their own strength. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

If they were to face Ba Cang alone, they would probably be intimidated by his reputation and retreat. However, now that the three of them were working together, they were naturally not afraid of Ba Cang.

“Oh, am I going too far? In that case, I shall bully you all.”?Ba Cang smiled coldly. He slowly lifted his right hand and pointed in the direction of the red-haired handsome man.

This simple point looked ordinary.

However, the space where the red-haired handsome man was was distorted.

The entire space was distorted, turning into a spiral. Even the god body of the red-haired handsome man was distorted.

“No, no!”

“What did you do?”

The red-haired handsome man screamed shrilly. The divine power in his body surged, trying to struggle.

However, no matter how hard he struggled, he could not get rid of the space-time he was in. He could not stop the space-time from distorting, as well as his god body.

This distortion finally reached its limit.

Boom!

The void exploded, and even the red-haired handsome man’s divine body exploded on the spot.

After the explosion, a terrifying destructive force appeared in the void, instantly shattering the red-haired handsome man and the void he was in. Not even a speck of dust was left.

Silence!

The entire world descended into a deathly silence.

The countless cultivators present widened their eyes, looking at this scene in disbelief.

The Principles Master, this was a true Principles Master!

A dignified Principles Master, in such a short period of time, it could be said that in just an instant, he was directly killed?

The Principles Master died so easily?

“Run!”

Xin Zong and the demonic old man reacted from their fear. They immediately used their fastest speed to run for their lives.

They no longer had the courage to fight against Ba Cang.

There was nothing they could do. The difference in strength was too big!

Watching the two of them escape, Ba Cang only smiled faintly. Then, he formed a fist with his right hand and casually smashed it into the void beside him.

A large amount of spatial ripples were created in the void, and these spatial ripples spread out at an astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye, they extended to the bodies of the two fleeing Principles Masters..
