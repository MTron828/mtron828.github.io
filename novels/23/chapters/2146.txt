Chapter 2147 Void Token

“Lord Fen?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.He heard Emperor Bai mention the three known Third Stage Great Emperors in the Three Emperors World.

They were Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, and Demon King Chen Yu.

Demon King Chen Yu was the leader of Acheron Palace and had exchanged blows with Jian Wushuang several times, but Jian Wushuang had never encountered Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen.

That raging elder with the Holocaust Sect experts was undoubtedly Lord Fen.

“Chen Yu, I knew you were a good-for-nothing,” Lord Fen glanced at Demon King Chen Yu with a hint of taunt.

“Asshole!” Demon King Chen Yu could not help but curse.

“You’re Jian Wushuang?” Lord Fen looked towards Jian Wushuang. “I was in seclusion this entire time, never bothering myself with the Eternal Chaotic World. I would never have let you reach where you are today, but it does not matter. I will kill you today!”

“Die!”

With Lord Fen’s command, the experts behind him charged towards the battlefield with the other Great Emperors.

He went straight for Jian Wushuang.

Hong Long Long~~

A terrifying aura started to spread from Lord Fen. His body swept over like a volcano that erupted for billions of years.

Where ever he went, the Void around was completely dissipated by the fire.

When Lord Fen approached Jian Wushuang…

Jian Wushuang felt an unprecedented aura of fire charging towards him. The Void in front of him had turned into a boundless sea of fire.

At the core of this sea of fire was a fiery lord, over five metres tall, holding a flaming battle sword in his hands.

He rose the flaming sword and slashed down towards the earth.

Hua la la~~~ the entire Void was covered by endless flames.

The flaming sword was enough to burn everything around.

Jian Wushuang stood and watched the flaming sword slashing down towards him.

“Demon King Chen Yu was the weakest amongst the three elite experts of the Three Emperors World. This Lord Fen is stronger than Demon King Chen Yu, but by how much, I do not know.” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists firmly, and a bloodthirsty smile appeared on his face.

He had no intention to dodge the flaming sword.

His surging divine power rose from his body, along with a supreme sword essence.

Jian Wushuang, at this moment, was the Emperor of Swords. His sword was the Sword of Emperor.

Surging divine power entered the sword, and a shocking sword image could be seen.

Emperor Sword Principle, Second Style!

This was the strongest sword move Jian Wushuang knew.

The shocking sword image went head-on with that flaming sword.

Confronting toughness with toughness!

Peng!

The world shook.

The monstrous flames and endless sword essence dissipated.

This collision did not lead to a stalemate. The battle was decided in an instant.

“This level of power?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. He could feel a power passing through his arm, so strong that even his self-defence mechanism could not ignore it. Instantly, his body moved directly towards the earth like a meteorite.

Eventually, he slammed on the ground below, creating a huge, bottomless pit.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang rose from the pit.

“So strong!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang had his eyes fixed on Lord Fen.

Both were Third Stage Great Emperors, but Lord Fens fighting power was way more

powerful than Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su’s.

Jian Wushuang estimated, if Lord Fen was not at the pinnacle Third Stage level, he was close.

This fighting power was way above his.

“Sword Emperor!”

A low howl came from the other battlefield.

Jian Wushuang turned towards the sound and realised that Abysmal Saint Master, Jian Yi and the others were already at a disadvantage.

This was normal.

They could fight nineteen Great Emperors at the same time, but with the new Holocaust Sect experts in the battlefield, along with other distraction tactics done by other Almighties at the sidelines, they could not hold on any longer.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

“Three Third Stage Great Emperors, twenty-six First or Second Stage Great Emperors, countless… this is enough.”

Jian Wushuang was determined. The Void Token was now in his hands.

“Hmm?”

Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, and Ba Su saw the token as well.

“What token was that?” Ba Su was puzzled.

“The token contains great spacetime power. Is he trying to escape?” Demon King Chen Yu’s face changed.

“Escape? Not on my watch!” Lord Fen’s face was ice-cold.

The Three Emperors World had lost too much during that sneak attack. The only way to re-balance the overall fighting power on both sides was if Jian Wushuang and the other Great Emperors stayed.

Jian Wushuang and others could not be allowed to escape.

Thinking of this, Lord Fen’s blazing flames once again covered the earth, and the entire battlefield, locking down the entire Void.

With his strength, he had created a spacetime seal, which made normal spacetime tokens useless.

“Jian Wushuang, you cannot escape! Prepare to die!”

With a low roar, Lord Fen, who had transformed into a blazing lord once again, headed towards him.

Jian Wushuang squinted. With Lord Fen’s power, along with Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su’s cornering, if Jian Wushuang did not escape, he could really die.

However…

“Who told you I was escaping?” Jian Wushuang’s cheeky smile was as sharp as a blade.

“It is you who should be fleeing!” !! Jian Wushuang clenched his right fist firmly and broke the Void Token.

A vast power of spacetime immediately swept through the environment.

The power of spacetime was beyond Lord Fen’s imagination. Normal spacetime measures would be uneffective under his spacetime seal, but he was unable to stop the billowing spacetime power.

Wong!

A huge space tunnel appeared in the Void of the Imperial City.

A strong light could be seen in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Step two has begun!”
