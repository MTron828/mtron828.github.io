Chapter 5423 - 5423 Ancient Battlefield

The Heavenly Lord.

It was a cornerstone force of the Three Kings Court. When Bai Junwang became a tier 5 Emperor, he had encountered the Heavenly Lord of the Three Kings Court. Their strength, at the lowest, was at the fifth tier. Their treasures emitted unique auras distinct from these corpses.

The power emanating from these corpses carried a taint of soul force.

This power made them uncomfortable.

It was as if it devoured, an evil force.

“Let’s watch and see what happens!” Bai Junwang, accompanied by the people from Kui, refrained from rash actions.

Zhen Wuyang and the people from the Elder Palace, being fellow allies, had gathered together without any movement.

Gui Ling, leading these miscellaneous troops, knew nothing and dared not act recklessly. They kept their eyes on Sutu Nan of Elder Palace and Bai Junwang of Kui.

No one was foolish enough to attack those corpses at this time.

Countless corpses surrounded them, and even a tier 5 Emperor might end up buried here.

Crack!

Standing beside his father, Broly threw a punch, shattered the skeleton of a corpse that had approached his father.

The power of this punch was formidable, undoubtedly that of a tier 5 peak-level combatant.

“No!”

Although Bukun’s strength was not up to par, he wasn’t foolish! It was useless to try to stop them, as the nearby corpses had already turned their heads.

Gui Ling also realized this and found that his disciple had attacked first. Without hesitation, he unleashed two powerful waves of energy, directly crashing near Zhen Wuyang and Bai Junwang.

Instantly, they attracted numerous corpses, turning to besiege them.

Bai Junwang cursed, “Damn it!”

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang had quietly retreated behind everyone, placing himself in the center. Ten tier 5 peak- level Emperors protected him, ensuring his safety.

Boom! Boom! Boom!!!

The corpses launched a massive attack, and at this point, there was no one to blame. They had to withstand the assault first before figuring out what to do.

“We can’t stay here any longer!” Zhen Wuyang’s figure soared, looking into the distance.

Surrounded on all sides, staying here would mean being worn down.

Gui Ling and others had already shrunk their divine bodies and, slipping through the gaps in the corpses, began to flee.

Resistance?

Who had the courage to stay here and resist?!

Even if they could resist, there was no point in wasting their strength here!

Killing these corpses brought no benefits whatsoever.

There was even a risk of soul contamination.

“Let’s go too, follow Gui Ling!” Jian Wushuang seized the opportunity, shouted to Bai Junwang, and also grabbed Gong Miaoyi to escape together.

With the escort of the cloak-wearing Emperor guards, he could now focus entirely on running away.

If they provoked those corpses, let the cloak-wearing Emperors deal with it.

This battlefield, neither too large nor too small, was comparable to several higher worlds.

In the outside world, it could even match a cosmic mystery. Yet, with this distance, an Emperor letting loose could escape within an hour.

While escaping, Jian Wushuang’s body also changed, turning into colorful bones like the corpses. His bones, however, were colorful.

Soon, they escaped the vortex of the ongoing battle. The skeletons ahead were now just like them, rushing towards the depths of the battlefield.

He wanted to see what was in the depths of the battlefield that compelled so many skeletons to charge recklessly.

The unfortunate ones left behind were Zhen Wuyang, Situ Nan, and their group.

The vortex of corpses was getting larger, making it difficult for them to break free.

Situ Nan’s avatar turned into a furious form spanning billions of miles, ruthlessly destroying those corpses, unmatched in its ferocity.

With Situ Nan holding the rear, Zhen Wuyang and the others finally caught up.

“Damn it!” Zhen Wuyang cursed all the way, catching up with the people from Gui Ling Island and killing enemies along the way, paying no attention to those tier 5 Emperors.

This time, he had several disciples with him, including other tier 6 Emperors like Tianchan, whose subordinates, many tier 5 Emperors, were slaughtered by Zhen Wuyang.

It was clearly an issue caused by Gui Ling, yet his people were taking the blame.

Up ahead…

In the depths of the battlefield, a majestic figure blocked their way.

Bai Junwang, upon seeing that figure, drew in a cold breath and shouted, “It’s a Universe Master, scatter quickly!”

Bai Junwang was familiar with that aura; he had seen a Universe Master. Although the figure before him had lost its original appearance, the aura remained unchanged. “Die!”

This time, they understood. The killing intent from the opponent warned them that advancing further meant certain death.

Boom!

A massive beam of light erupted, sweeping through all the powerful beings in a straight line.

Whether skeletons or Emperors like themselves, several tier 5 Emperors instantly fell, and a tier 6 Emperor had his divine body shattered, suffering severe injuries.

It was the Emperor from the Elder Palace at the rear. Moving slowly, he couldn’t react in time and took a direct hit.

On the contrary, the person at the forefront sensed something amiss and quickly evaded.

Phew!

Jian Wushuang’s back was covered in cold sweat. If he had encountered that beam just now, he would undoubtedly be dead.

Luckily, he was fast.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At this moment, he dared not be careless. The Beast God Domain erupted silently, and his divine body began to ascend.

The Heavenly Demon Technique also reached its peak, and the divine body reached 40,000-fold.

Anxious, Jian Wushuang asked, “What do we do?”

Suddenly, everyone lost their composure, unsure of what to do.

This time, the remnants exceeded the expectations of everyone present. Throughout the Earth Realm, or rather, the Four Great Secret Realms, such a powerful remnant had never appeared before.

Even the Forest of Eternal Secrets from years ago didn’t have the corpse of a Universe Master!

If there were any, they would have been taken away long ago by the Four Great Temples.

However, Gui Ling and others showed joy on their faces.

For all the tier 6 Emperors in the Earth Realm, or the Four Great Secret Realms, the pursuit was not the pinnacle but the remains of the Universe Master, which had long disappeared.

Now, unexpectedly encountering the physical body of a Universe Master, even without the Origin Source, was enough.

As long as they obtained this physical body of this Universe Master, they would be prosperous.

Bai Junwang, in particular, looked on with envy.

Among the people present, no one needed a physical body more than he did.

Elder Qing Mang approached, holding a jade slip bestowed by Shen Ling, and handed it to Bai Junwang, saying, “Shen Ling has a command!”

Bai Junwang took it, and the inscriptions on it were understood only by him!

After reading it, he directly crushed the jade slip, revealing a cold smile.

The information on top was concise: Use Jian Wushuang’s Power of All Things to suppress and seize the physical body of the Universe Master.

Jian Wushuang, upon hearing Bai Junwang’s instructions, was dumbfounded.

Letting him, a Dao Lord, suppress the physical body of a Universe Master? If the other party didn’t move, he would dare to try it. But now, not to mention him, even a tier 6 peak-level Emperor wouldn’t dare to go!

“This is the greatest opportunity of my life. Jian Wushuang, if you help me, once I ascend, I will share the entire Qishen Temple with you. I will be your guardian!” Bai Junwang made a promise; he truly wanted to restore his peak and even advance further.

He had always followed the path of the divine body. Although the Origin Source had been restored, he knew little about practicing with the Origin Source.

If he obtained the physical body of the Universe Master, he could tread the old path and break through with the divine body.
