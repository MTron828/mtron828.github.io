Dao Master Dreamless did not linger here any longer but left soon.

While leaving, he warned Jian Wushuang to guard against Empyrean Patriarch.

After that, Jian Wushuang called on God Hong. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Big Brother Hong, what happened to the Black Python Clan?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“What could they do?” God Hong said with a grin. “You killed Mo Lin as well as 90% of the experts of that clan. Thus, it is no longer qualified to be called an advanced population. Everyone tends to hit a person when he is down. This clan is doomed to disappear even without my clan taking any actions. It would be a blessing for it if some of its clansmen have escaped.”

Jian Wushuang agreed with him secretly.

He was aware that the battles between different populations on the Samsara Continent were unusually crazy and cruel.

Without him, the Rock Demon Clan would have been exterminated. Chances were that only a few of its clansmen could escape.

And thus, he caused the Black Python Clan to fall on hard times.

Jian Wushuang was quite helpless in this regard.

“Since the Black Python Clan has been wiped out, there should be no population that can threaten the Rock Demon Clan on this territory. It’s time for me to leave,” said Jian Wushuang.

“You are going to leave?” God Hong’s expression changed slightly.

“The nine sword scars left behind by Sunrise Sword Emperor are not as useful to me as they used to be. Furthermore, I have something else to do. So, I have to depart.” Jian Wushuang said smilingly.

“Alright.” God Hong said with a nod. “Well, what about Empyrean Patriarch?”

When God Hong was on the battlefield previously, he heard Dao Master Dreamless mention Empyrean Patriarch.

“He is a threat to me, but he can do nothing to me.” Jian Wushuang said with confidence.

“Great.” God Hong sighed with relief.

“Big Brother Hong, see you then.”

After giving God Hong some advice, Jian Wushuang bid farewell to him and left.

He came to the Rock Demon Clan for returning God Hong’s favor in the Ancient World. He had done what he could and there was no need for him to linger any longer.

His next destination was the Divine Monster Territory.

This was where Elder Ding Mo was at.

There existed an enormous but secluded castle that was surrounded by dark airflow hundreds of millions of miles away from the Rock Demon Clan in a vast range of mountains.

It stood erect over the years, but few people nearby perceived its existence.

Out of blue, a terrifying aura emanated from this black castle.

This aura spread far and wide along with overwhelming rage and pressure. It influenced untold Warriors and some Dao Masters in a common population tens of thousands of miles away, resulting them to tremble with fear.

All these Warriors were in a state of panic.

“Died? My son Di Yan is dead?”

A short-haired, lean elder stood in the Void above the black castle. The ferocious look in his eyes made him look more arrogant and obstinate.

His name,Empyrean Patriarch, terrified all the people on the Samsara Continent!

At this moment, Empyrean Patriarch was quivering, his eyes blazing with fury.

Undisciplined and out of control, he was quite a strange character who always tyrannized other people on the Samsara Continent.

Moreover, as a member of the Sky-devouring Clan, he had an inborn fondness of his only son and took very good care of him.

This was a known fact to all experts and populations on the Samsara Continent. Therefore, even though they knew that Di Yan was running amuck and had devoured the Essence Blood of some rare bloodlines, they could only turn a blind eye for fear of provoking Empyrean Patriarch.

Everyone there deferred to Empyrean Patriarch.

Even if Di Yan had taken too far sometimes and displeased some top experts, they only slightly punished him but did not dare to kill him due to Empyrean Patriarch. That had been the case for years.

No one had ever thought that his son would have been killed today!

“Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang!”

Empyrean Patriarch growled. He was informed of his son’s death and the information about the killer at the same time; an expert majored in Sword Principle named Jian Wushuang. To his surprise, Jian Wushuang was merely at the Eternal Realm.

“How dare you killed him as you knew his identity!”

“I don’t care your identity, your background, and origin. I swear I must kill you!”

“You definitely will come to a tragic end!”

“Where are my 10 Protectors?”

Empyrean Patriarch’s roar echoed throughout the world.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Quick as a flash, 10 figures flew out of the castle and appeared in front of Empyrean Patriarch. They knelt down before him immediately.

“Paying respects to Ancestor!”

Their voices were earsplitting.

All of them were powerful Dao Masters and three of them were Peak Rank Three Dao Masters.

Moreover, they were experts who sought refuge with Empyrean Patriarch.

“Follow me!”

Empyrean Patriarch waved his sleeve and they set off at once.

He went to the Samsara Temple to borrow the wormhole.

The wormhole would not open to the outside world easily, but the Samsara Temple was obliged to give him face given his ferocity.

It only took him a few days to arrive at the territory of the Rock Demon Clan through the wormhole.

“Did my son die here?”

Floating in the Void above the Rock Demon Clan, Empyrean Patriarch gave off a horrible pressure. It came crushing down upon the members of this clan and subdued them.

Wave after wave shrill cries rang out and a large number of its clansmen knelt down under the pressure.

“Stop! Stop!”

A voice mixed with shock and anger sounded, and then God Hong arrived here together with some top experts from the Rock Demon Clan.

As soon as he appeared in the Void, he saw Empyrean Patriarch. The latter emanated a horrifying pressure that he could hardly resist.

“Celestial Master, he is a Celestial Master!” God Hong clenched his fists after he figured out the identity of the man in front of him.

“I’m God Hong, the Clan Leader of the Rock Demon Clan, paying respects to Empyrean Patriarch.” God Hong said respectfully.

“Where is Jian Wushuang?”
