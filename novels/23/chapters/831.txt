Chapter 832: Blood Eagle Guard

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This armor is so solid and resilient, yet so light.”

Putting on the gold armor, Jian Wushuang was surprised at how light it was.

“Now, follow me to our camp.” The beautiful lady led the one thousand new recruits to the camp of the Royal Guard.

The camp was located outside the imperial palace of the Tang of the East. It covered a large area and was heavily guarded. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When Jian Wushuang and the others arrived, the first thing they saw was a huge barracks. Inside, they could see several soldiers wearing the same gold armor.

Just as they were about to enter the barracks...

Phew! Phew! Phew!

Three red lights ignored the Restrictions and flew directly into the barracks from above. The soldiers in the barracks all looked at the lights with reverence.

“It’s the Blood Eagle Guards!”

A new recruit standing next to Jian Wushuang cried out excitedly.

“Blood Eagle Guards?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the recruit. “Brother, what’s a Blood Eagle Guard?”

Hearing their conversation, several nearby recruits looked toward them with interest.

Most of the new recruits only knew that the Royal Guard was the most elite army in the Tang of the East. They had never heard of the Blood Eagle Guard.

Nothing about the Blood Eagle Guard had been mentioned in any of the information Jian Wushuang had read about the Tang of the East.

“Blood Eagle Guard belongs to Royal Guard and is called as its sharpest claw.” The recruit beside Jian Wushuang explained to them, and his eyes betrayed his fever.

“All of you must know that the Royal Guard is the strongest and most elite army in our country, but in fact, there are two types of soldiers in the troop.

“The first is called the Dragon Guard, responsible for the public security inside and outside the imperial palace.

“99 percent of soldiers in the Royal Guard belong to this group, and us new members will join them as well.

“The second type is called the Blood Eagle Guard, and they act as a special organization in our troop.”

“A special organization?” Jian Wushuang and the others were puzzled.

The recruit explained further, “If members of the Dragon Guard are all elites, the members of the Blood Eagle Guard are the elites of the elites. They are in charge of the dangerous and secret missions for the Imperial House.

“For example, assassinating families in the Tang of the East!

“Secretly wiping out strong experts.

“And also, protecting some of the most powerful people in our country, those secretly who hold special positions.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang and the others could not help gasping in admiration.

The Dragon Guard was only responsible for public security, therefore, their lives would be easier and more comfortable.

The Blood Eagle Guard had to hide in the dark to carry out a variety of special and dangerous tasks.

In short, the Dragon Guard was public, and the Blood Eagle Guard was secret.

It was clear that the latter faced more danger.

“Because most of the tasks the Blood Eagle Guard has to accomplish are quite dangerous, only the really powerful are qualified to join. As far as I know, to be one of them, one has to be above Step Four of the Eternal Realm,” said the recruit.

“What?”?Jian Wushuang was amazed.

“To become a member of the Blood Eagle Guard, one has to be above Step Four of the Eternal Realm?”

“Do you know how many people there are in the Blood Eagle Guard?” Jian Wushuang asked out of curiosity.

He wanted to know how many people were in the Blood Eagle Guard as its standard was so high.

“I don’t know the exact number, but the estimated number should be more than a thousand,” the recruit answered.

“Even with such a high bar, there are still more than a thousand people in the Blood Eagle Guard?”?Jian Wushuang secretly admired the Tang of the East. It was indeed a powerful country.

“I also heard that the remuneration the Blood Eagle Guard offers to its members is far above that of the Dragon Guard,” the recruit continued. “Many experts from the Dragon Guard want to join the Blood Eagle Guard, but they are unqualified.”

“The remuneration the Dragon Guard offers is better?”?Jian Wushuang remained indifferent.

He was not interested in money; what he cared about was the dangerous missions the Blood Eagle Guard carried out.

In comparison to the Blood Eagle Guard, the Dragon Guard was only responsible for the public security of the imperial palace. Life would be too comfortable for Jian Wushuang.

That was not what he wanted.

Soon, led by the beautiful lady, Jian Wushuang and the other new recruits entered the barracks and were later assigned to numerous small teams.

Jian Wushuang and seven other people were assigned to a normal team of 10 members.

To Jian Wushuang’s surprise, he and the recruit who had introduced the Blood Eagle Guard to him were on the same team.

“Haha, brother, it seems that fate has brought us together again. What’s your name?” The recruit, a lean man, asked Jian Wushuang with a grin.

“Blood Mountain. What’s your name?” Jian Wushuang replied flatly.

“My name is Ouyang Xu, from the Ouyang clan,” he replied with a smile.

“From the Ouyang clan?”?Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

There were many ancient families in the Tang of the East. Since Ouyang Xu was from one of them, it was not surprising that he knew so much about the Blood Eagle Guard.

“Let’s go. Our team is in front of us, and our captain must have been waiting for us for a while,” said Ouyang Xu.

“Waiting for us, why?” Jian Wushuang asked, puzzled.

“I’ve heard from my family elders that life in the Royal Guard seems to be comfortable, but in fact, it doesn’t forbid internal conflict,” Ouyang Xu replied. “Power speaks loudest in the Royal Guard. Do you really think that the old members will be that welcoming?”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

A moment later, when Jian Wushuang and the seven other new recruits arrived at their camp, just as Ouyang Xu had said, their captain and two old members were waiting for them.

“Haha, after waiting for so long, you guys are finally here.”

“Finally, I have someone to practice my skills with. I’ve had enough of practicing with the captain.”

The two older members looked at Jian Wushuang and the other new recruits with great interest. As for their captain, he was sitting at a table with a wine gourd in his hand, glancing at them occasionally.

From the man’s aura, they could tell that though he was only the captain of a small team, he was in the Eternal Realm and very powerful.
