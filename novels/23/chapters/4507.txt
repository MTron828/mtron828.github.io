4508 Bombarding Indiscriminately and Destroying Everything

Supreme Gongyang was hiding in a corner of the apotheosized land, watching the battle without blinking.

In the beginning, he had the intention to stop the fight, but after seeing the momentum of the two, he immediately gave up the plan.

Speaking of which, he was also a Top Supreme expert, and he was a well-known big shot in the universe.

However, when he saw the battle between Jian Wushuang and Supreme Bing Ye, he felt that he had lost his footing.

!!

“These two people are too terrifying!”

Supreme Gongyang shook his head with a bitter smile.

…

Bang! Bang!

In the sword ocean formed by sword radiances, the sword radiances were like a surging river or a raging sea. They exploded continuously and gave off earth-shaking rumbles.

If it were not for the 99 restrictions in the Land of Gods that isolated everything, Jian Wushuang’s sword would have created a hole in the sky of the entire universe!

Under the seething sea of swords, Supreme Bing Ye’s Sword Dao incarnation was completely shattered in just a few breaths.

Only the real Supreme Master Bing Ye was left in the sea of swords. He continuously slashed and blocked the waves of sword light that were crashing toward him.

“Divine power, Ice Emperor!”

Rumble!!!

Suddenly, Supreme Bing Ye’s aura, which had been slightly dispirited, rose sharply. His entire body swelled up at an extremely fast speed!

With him as the center, a terrifying aura spread out and shook the earth!

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and a slight fighting intent appeared on his expressionless face.

“Bing Ye, now this is what you should do.”

“Come! Show me your strength and don’t disappoint me!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit and he also activated his divine body!

10 feet… 1,000 feet… 10,000 feet… 100,000 feet…!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang and Supreme Bing Ye’s divine bodies expanded and they rose from the ground!

The two of them seemed to have transformed into ancient giants that could hold up the sky. The mountain peaks that people looked up to were only knee-high below their feet.

The two of them seemed to be able to grasp the formation of the sun and moon by raising their hands, and they could use the Milky Way as their feet when they stepped on it. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Their eyes seemed to have turned into burning suns.

At 150,000 feet, Supreme Bing Ye stopped expanding.

His entire aura changed, and a crown made of glazed ice appeared on his head.

His skin was covered in a thick layer of ice crystal armor, only revealing a pair of cold silver eyes.

In his hand, the God Slaying Sword disappeared and turned into a huge ice crystal sword!

This was not the end. On his back, the ice crystal wings condensed again, but they were countless times wider, as if they could destroy the world with a gentle flap.

However… Jian Wushuang was still growing!

200,000 feet!

210,000 feet!

Jian Wushuang’s expanding divine body only stopped when he reached 250,000 feet.

Supreme Bing Ye, who was already as tall as a large mountain, suddenly became small in front of Jian Wushuang.

Thud! Thud!

Without saying anything, Jian Wushuang moved!

He took a step forward and flattened an entire mountain range. His right fist was like a drawn bow as it ruthlessly smashed toward Supreme Bing Ye!

All the cultivation of an Intermediate Supreme martial artist burst out and condensed on his fist. Coupled with his Chaos Overlord Body, it was as if he had a sun in his fist and was emitting a bright golden light!

Rumble!

This punch was extremely powerful. The overbearing power and the biting-cold Sword Qi on it had yet to land on Supreme Bing Ye’s body, but it had already created a pit in the void and set off a shocking wave of air!

“Come! Jian Wushuang! Today, either you die or I die!”

A crazed and ferocious expression appeared on Supreme Master Bing Ye’s face. He was also extremely determined and brought out an indomitable spirit!

He raised his huge sword that was as big as a Glacier Mountain and slashed at Jian Wushuang!

Bang!

A deafening explosion erupted!

Supreme Bing Ye’s body trembled violently. The overbearing power and terrifying Sword Qi on Jian Wushuang’s fist followed the huge glacier sword and crashed into Supreme Bing Ye’s body wave after wave like a thousand-fold wave!

In an instant, countless ice crystals were sent flying. Supreme Bing Ye was forced to take three steps back. Every step he took seemed to trigger an earthquake. With his feet as the center, the earth began to crack like a spider web, creating countless bottomless ravines.

Jian Wushuang also groaned. His fist was covered with golden blood and his bone armor was almost broken.

But even so, Jian Wushuang still sneered.

Back in the Great Void Star Field, Jian Wushuang was almost unable to resist this move of Supreme Bing Ye. He had exhausted all his abilities but was unable to hurt Supreme Bing Ye in the slightest.

In the end, he had to use the last move of the Tarot Sword Manual to defeat Supreme Bing Ye.

However, now, he was able to fight against Supreme Bing Ye with his own strength!

“Again!”

...

Jian Wushuang laughed and his eyes were burning with fighting spirit.

He took a step forward and began to run. Once again, he raised his fist and charged toward Supreme Bing Ye!

“Good! Jian Wushuang, I’d like to see how far you’ve grown!”

Supreme Bing Ye’s face darkened. He raised his huge sword and leaped up, slashing it at Jian Wushuang!

“Good!”

“Innate divine ability, Life Intimidation!”

Jian Wushuang laughed and directly used life intimidation.

A pressure that seemed to originate from a higher level of existence instantly spread out, causing Supreme Bing Ye’s movements to freeze.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang closed in and clenched his hands into fists. It was as if he was holding the sun and moon in his palms. He released endless brilliance and bombarded Supreme Bing Ye’s chest!

Bang! Bang!!!

Jian Wushuang’s fists exploded with Sword Qi and struck Supreme Bing Ye’s chest, causing numerous muffled sounds.

...

For the current Jian Wushuang, killing Supreme Bing Ye was not a difficult task.

He only needed to display the fifth move of the Tarot Sword Manual, Tarot, and Jian Wushuang was confident that he would be able to kill Supreme Bing Ye.

He did not even need to go through the trouble of releasing the Tarot divine corpse from the Heaven-Suppressing Monument. With the two of them working together, they could easily kill Supreme Bing Ye even if they were to grind him down slowly.

However, Jian Wushuang did not choose to do so.

He was going to rely on his most primal and original power to completely crush Supreme Bing Ye in all aspects!

He wanted Supreme Master ice to die with heartfelt respect!

Peng peng peng!

Jian Wushuang’s punches became faster and faster, like a heavy cannon, and smashed into Supreme Bing Ye’s chest like a storm.

Countless ice crystals were sent flying.

The thick layer of ice crystal armor on Supreme Bing Ye’s body was shattered by Jian Wushuang’s fist.

Under Jian Wushuang’s dense punches, Supreme Bing Ye’s divine body began to tremble violently. His entire body was like a sieve that was constantly shaking.

His face quickly turned from green to white. Divine blood flowed out of his ears and nose, and his aura began to weaken.

“Break!”

As Jian Wushuang shouted, he gathered all of his divine power and Sword Qi into a heavy fist and struck the center of Supreme Bing Ye’s chest!

In an instant, Supreme Master Bing Ye felt as if he had been hit by a violent train. His entire body was sent flying like a raggedy sack. He flew through the air and heavily fell to the ground, setting off a mushroom cloud of dust.

Jian Wushuang withdrew his fist and panted slightly.

In the entire world, he was the only one left standing like a mountain.
