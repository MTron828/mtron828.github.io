4266 The Curtains of the Battle Open!

One expert after another flew through the air, and many of them were old monsters who had been famous throughout the universe for over a hundred chaos cycles. Their arrival caused quite a stir.

There was a strange Rabbit Buddha in a kasaya with a rabbit head, a Titan race giant who ruled over a part of the universe, and a descendant of the dark demon from the abyss of the universe. All of them had extremely powerful auras.

It was an eye-opening experience for Jian Wushuang. The vastness of the universe far exceeded his imagination.

If he had not been a perfect-level special living being, he would not have been able to fight against these geniuses.

“I’m afraid it’ll be difficult to get the God Sealing Tablet this time.” Commander Mountain Shaker shook his head, his expression extremely grave.

Apart from the future Commander Buxu, there were a total of six great commanders under the Overlord who had come to fight for the God Sealing Tablet. Each of them was an expert close to the level of an unparalleled Ruler. Among them, the first commander, Han Feng, had unfathomable strength and was probably comparable to an unparalleled Ruler.

In the universe, as long as a Supreme-being did not appear, such a powerful force would basically be invincible. However, in the 16th city, it did not pose any threat at all.

The smell of fire in the air was getting stronger and stronger. Everyone was biding their time, holding back their momentum.

At this moment.

“I’ll take three of these five Investiture of the Gods. I don’t care how you fight for the other two,” the Golden Crow Prince said expressionlessly.

Then, the Golden Crow Prince reached out his right hand and grabbed the five Investiture of the Gods.

In his hand, countless golden flames gathered and formed a giant arm, which crossed the void and grabbed The Investiture of the Gods!

When everyone saw this, their faces were filled with hesitation.

As the eldest son of the Emperor Jin Wu, Emperor Jin Wu’s strength was unfathomable, and he was strong enough to rival the big shots. No one wanted to be the first to attack and offend Emperor Jin Wu.

“Commander Mountain Shaker, are we just going to let him take the three pieces of The Investiture of the Gods?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

Commander Mountain Shaker’s expression flickered. He glanced at Commander Han Feng, who did not speak, and replied, “We’ll listen to Commander Han Feng.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and continued to look at Emperor Jin Wu.

Although the Golden Crow Emperor was strong, there were also a few whose auras were not weaker than his. He believed that someone would stop him.

As expected.

Just as the Golden Crow Prince’s flaming hand was about to touch The Investiture of the Gods, a cold and deep voice suddenly sounded.

“Golden Crow, aren’t you being a little too optimistic?”

Bang!

In the next moment, a huge black waterfall slashed out from the crowd!

This ribbon seemed to come from the nine serenities hell, full of coldness and evil. It directly shattered the Golden Crow Prince’s flaming hand!

“Oh?”

The Golden Crow Prince raised an eyebrow and turned his head to look at the place where the bolt of lightning had come from.

A tall man in black armor and carrying a giant axe walked out of the crowd.

This man had a pair of red eyes and a horned helmet. His face was extremely ugly, as if he was a demon from hell.

“A descendant of the dark demons in the abyss?” The Golden Crow Prince narrowed his eyes.

The abyss was located in the extreme north of the universe. It was desolate all year round, and no one dared to set foot there.

The only thing there was a river of blood that had flowed for countless chaos cycles. The river of blood was so incredibly corrosive that even Rulers would be completely corroded in the space of a few breaths, their bodies and souls destroyed.

The land of the abyss was also known as the forbidden land of the universe. Only the descendants of the dark demons born from the blood river could survive there.

“You want to stop me?” The Golden Crow Prince’s voice gradually turned cold.

The dark demon descendant twisted his neck and took out the giant axe on his back. He said in a deep voice, “I’ve killed more than one or two Golden Crows. Come, let this Lord see what’s so different about the Golden Crow Royal Clan!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the descendant of the dark demon took a step forward and his body shot forward. The giant axe in his hand was like pangu splitting open the sky as he hacked down at the Golden Crow Prince!

On his back, a pair of blood wings spread open!

“You’re looking for death!”

The Golden Crow Prince’s expression turned cold, and the two tridents in his hands were instantly covered in golden flames. He streaked a beautiful trail of flames in the air toward the dark demon descendant!

In an instant, the battle between the Golden Crow Prince and the descendant of the dark demon was like a fuse that lit up, and the entire battlefield was filled with the sounds of battle!

“Kill!!!”

At this moment, countless Ultimate Rulers roared and charged at the five God sealing monuments!

The massacre began!

This battle was bound to shake the heavens and earth!

Only the strongest among the Rulers could live to the end of this battle. They could step over the piles of corpses and write a glorious epic to obtain the God Sealing Tablet! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

…

“Blood Sword, it’s our turn!” Commander Mountain Shaker said in a deep voice with a solemn expression.

In the distance, the Blood God’s forces, led by Bloodrein, were already charging over!

“Han Feng, five hundred thousand years ago, you managed to escape with your life in crooked Cloud Star area. Let’s see how you escape this time!” Bloodrein’s lips curled into a devilish smile as he looked at commander freezing wind with a mocking gaze.

Commander Han Feng did not reply. He only coldly said, “Kill!”

In an instant, the two camps were engaged in a fierce battle!

Peng peng peng!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Countless magical powers and secret skills were cast, causing the void to explode.

At that moment, he saw Moluo Yangu leading a group of Moluo clansmen and walking toward Jian Wushuang.

Instantly, the six commanders’ expressions changed.

It was already extremely difficult for them to face the Blood God’s camp. How could they have any energy left to face the Moluo clan?

“Could it be that the Moluo clan has allied with the Blood God?”

Commander Mountain Shaker’s expression was extremely ugly.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing beside him, took a deep breath, shook his head and said, “No, I’m not. They’re here for me.”

“Is he here to find you?”

“Blood Sword, did you offend the Moluo clan?” The commander was startled and asked hesitantly.

Jian Wushuang did not reply. Instead, he clenched his right hand and the repaired Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his hand.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang took a step forward and his entire body suddenly soared into the sky. He flew past the two camps that were fighting each other and faced the approaching Moluo Yangu.

Moluo Yangu stopped in his tracks. He then twisted his neck and said, “Little guy, the last battle in the Eighth City doesn’t count. Let’s try again this time!”

Jian Wushuang nodded and replied, “Then come.”

Whoosh!

A ray of heaven-opening sword light condensed on the Wuqi Divine Sword and slashed toward Moluo!

Moluo looked at this seemingly familiar sword. His pupils first contracted before he burst out laughing,

“Hahaha, Blood Sword, it seems that you have improved again during this period of time!”
