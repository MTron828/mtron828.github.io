Chapter 1669: Unexpected Rescue From A Desperate Situation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

At the bottom of the dark river, the power of the Ancient God’s Sixth Finger that Jian Wushuang had used his full power to unleash burst forth.

Rumble~~~ A great amount of water evaporated and the power of the Sixth Finger caused the two Crimson Star Demons to give shrill cries.

After the power dissipated, among the two Crimson Star Demons, one of them was killed on the spot, while the other one fortunately survived. Although it survived, it was in an extremely tragic state where it had become extremely weak like never before and it had lost its fighting capabilities.

With a wave of Jian Wushuang’s hands, he took the Demon Core of the dead Crimson Star Demon. After that, his body continued to escape madly toward the bottom of the river.

Without the two Crimson Star Demons chasing after him, Jian Wushuang saw a chance of surviving.

However, at that moment… Buzz!

All of a sudden, the river water ahead of Jian Wushuang revolved and turned into a whirlpool in the blink of an eye.

The whirlpool was bottomless and Jian Wushuang was also not sure of what the core of the whirlpool was. However, as soon as the whirlpool appeared, it headed toward Jian Wushuang as if it was controlled by someone else.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed greatly. However, the power that the whirlpool contained totally exceeded his expectations and he was completely swallowed by the whirlpool without being able to resist at all.

After that, the whirlpool dissipated slowly and the whole dark river quietened down. Only a number of Star Demons who were still looking for traces of Jian Wushuang in the river remained. However, no matter how hard they looked, they were unable to find Jian Wushuang.

…

This was a standalone space in the deepest part or the bottom of the river.

The whole space was covered by a special seal. However, one could still see the rippling sprays of water on the other side of the seal faintly.

A ray of light flashed past and Jian Wushuang’s body appeared in the standalone space.

“I have…” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

Previously, he was about to shake the Star Demons off. However, a giant whirlpool had appeared on the river and swallowed him, bringing him to his current location.

“This place should be a standalone space, right?” Jian Wushuang was looking around his surroundings. As he was quite knowledgeable, he was able to recognize that he was within a standalone space with just a glance. Moreover, the standalone space was most likely at the bottom of the dark river.

“A long time ago, I heard that the Dark Region of the Eight Lairs contained quite a number of special places and even Almighties were unable to find them. Looking at it now, that seems to be the case.”

“At the least, I reckon that no one in the whole Sanctuary Alliance knows about the standalone space that I am in now,” Jian Wushuang said surprisingly.

The standalone space was extremely vast and Jian Wushuang was unable to see its end. Moreover, close to a hundred percent of the standalone space was occupied by a big mountain.

A big mountain. Yes, it was indeed a giant mountain.

From the time Jian Wushuang had begun his training to that moment, he had never seen such a gigantic mountain.

“Although I cannot see the end, this big mountain should cover at least hundreds of millions of miles of this standalone space,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

The mountain, which covered hundreds of millions of miles, was only made up of one mountain and it was not a mountain range made up of countless mountains.

Jian Wushuang was exclaiming in admiration. However, all of a sudden… Rumble~~~ The giant mountain in front of Jian Wushuang shook abruptly. In the standalone space, the shaking was considered an earthquake in the universe and countless crushed stones that were ten miles or even hundreds of miles high fell from the mountain crazily.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes big and he was staring at the scene which was about to unfold in front of him. At the next moment, a scene which caused him to be terrified unfolded.

At the center of the gigantic mountain, an enormous head came out from the entrance of a tremendous cave.

It was too huge. The head was too huge.

It was so huge that it completely exceeded his expectations.

From Jian Wushuang’s experience, the living thing with the biggest body that he had ever seen was the King of Venomous Worms when he was at its peak.

When he had seen the King of Venomous Worms for the first time, the space he had occupied was so big that it could form an island. Hence, the King of Venomous Worms’ body had caused Jian Wushuang to be shocked.

However, at that moment, when he saw the head which had come out, Jian Wushuang knew that the King of Venomous Worms’ body was considered nothing.

It was incomparable to the head in front of him.

The size of the head alone was definitely hundreds of times larger than the island that the King of Venomous Worms had formed when he was at his peak!!

That’s right. It was as big as hundreds of Kings of Venomous Worms.

Moreover, it was only the head.

If the head was like that, what about its body?

Jian Wushuang was swallowing his saliva and he was stunned.

If his guess was not wrong, the gigantic mountain in front of him which caused him to be in disbelief was the body of the living thing!

It was an unbelievable living thing which occupied hundreds of millions of miles of space.

As for what exactly was the living thing, Jian Wushuang managed to recognize it as the huge head that came out from the cave was the head of a dragon.

“Dragon Turtle!” Jian Wushuang’s body trembled in fear.

The living thing in front of him was a Dragon Turtle that was unbelievably gigantic.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang suppressed his fear and greeted respectfully, “I am Jian Wushuang, greetings to Elder Dragon Turtle.”

“Jian Wushuang? That’s your name?” An ancient and deep voice could be heard from the Dragon Turtle. The voice was loud and it resounded across the whole standalone space.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head hastily.

“Your name is not too bad. However, your abilities… merely Pure Sun Realm. Moreover, you have only entered this realm for not too long. You are really too weak,” the Dragon Turtle said.

“Pure Sun Realm?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He was currently at the level of a Real God and he had never heard of anyone using the term Pure Sun Realm instead of Real God.

“Little kid, there’s a palace on my back and you should go there,” the Dragon Turtle said.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. Without hesitation, his body floated up and he landed on the back of the Dragon Turtle, which was also the higher-end of the lofty mountain.

When Jian Wushuang raised his eyes, he saw an extremely huge Crystal Palace.

The Crystal Palace was about a hundred thousand feet tall and millions of miles wide. It was definitely an extremely gigantic palace. However, as it was on the back of the Dragon Turtle, it was completely obstructed from his view and he did not realize it.

Jian Wushuang’s body continued moving and, in no time, he appeared before the palace door of the Crystal Palace.

At that moment, a dim shadow appeared in front of him. The dim shadow slowly came into view and became a golden-skinned old man. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The old man had strange looks and he also had a long golden tail behind him.

However, at the moment that such a strange old man appeared, Jian Wushuang’s body, mind and soul trembled in fear.

Jian Wushuang also had an illusion that the strange old man in front of him could easily kill him a countless number of times for as long as he wanted to. Moreover, no matter what trump cards or techniques he had, there would still be no room for him to struggle.

“You are Elder Dragon Turtle?” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and questioned reservedly.
