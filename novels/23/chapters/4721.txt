4722 You Still Dare to Intercept

None of them spoke, and they all stood there with their hands cupped.

Each of them had been by the Young Emperor’s side for countless years, so they did not need to say a word to know what he meant.

A murderous intent rose to the sky.

The thin purple-robed man stepped out of the formation, held the Young Emperor’s hand, and sent him into one of the ten Imperial carriages.

The other nine carriages were used to confuse the enemy.

After sending the Young Emperor into the Imperial carriage, the skinny purple-robed man returned and said to Jian Wushuang, “Follow me.”

Jian Wushuang did not suspect anything. After exchanging a glance with Chun Qiu, Chen Qing, and the others, he went straight ahead.

When he was pushed into the carriage, Jian Wushuang saw that the Young Emperor was among them.

“Uh…” He was embarrassed and wanted to leave.

“Brother Jian, please stay. I was the one who asked my companion to let you in here.” The Young Emperor waved his hand. “I can’t tell if there will be any danger on this journey, so I’m asking you to come along.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then sat in the luxurious carriage.

Chun Qiu, Chen Qing, and the rest of the Yan Immortals all entered the other nine Imperial carriages.

The remaining thousand or so Ancestor-level experts didn’t follow them in. Instead, they only followed a hundred or so of them to serve as guards of honor. The rest of them were scattered across the entire Great Si Region.

As the preparations were completed, a total of ten Imperial carriages took off with the wind. The dragon-sheep-like beast stepped on the clouds, and each step it took covered a distance of hundreds of millions of miles!

Even though the speed was so terrifying, sitting in the Imperial carriage, he could not help but feel the slightest bit of turbulence.

At that moment, only Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor were sitting in the carriage that could accommodate dozens of people.

The atmosphere was a little awkward, so Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and fell into deep thought.

With the rising clouds and smoke from the golden furnace, the entire Imperial carriage had become an excellent place for cultivation. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Brother Jian, this trip will take several months. If you have nothing else to do, you should take a good rest,” the Young Emperor reminded.

Jian Wushuang nodded. “I will.”

At this point, the long journey had entered a silent stage.

The Imperial carriage traveled through the void, passing through many void worlds as it headed toward the most mysterious place.

The Young Emperor’s Six Heavens Realm was just the six common Heavenly Realms in the Great Si Region. Beyond the Great Si Region was an even more vast universe.

He did not know when he would arrive at the Heavenly Court that was ruled by Zhen Wuyang.

Jian Wushuang was really curious about this legendary figure who had basically lived under the curses of the three Emperor’s True Shadows.

To be able to destroy the bodies of three Emperors and the Heavenly Court on his own, how terrifying must Zhen Wuyang be?

Emperor Fenghua, Chun Qiu’s Imperial Father, had also died at the hands of Zhen Wuyang. Jian Wushuang knew four of them, which showed their terrifying strength.

Perhaps, a God Emperor of such a level would know something.

While Jian Wushuang was thinking about his next step, almost 20 days had passed.

He did not know if he was in a dream or when he was awake, but he felt a sense of danger.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes. The Young Emperor opened his eyes at the same time, and there was a chill in his eyes.

“Are these b*stards crazy? Do they actually dare to intercept and kill us here? Do you really think I’m made of mud?” The Young Emperor said coldly and was about to step out.

Jian Wushuang reached out to stop him and said in a low voice, “Don’t go out yet. We’ll wait and see.”

He nodded slowly, and Yan power appeared in his hand.

In the next moment, an extremely powerful Yan power broke through the void and exploded in the ten Imperial carriages!

Jian Wushuang felt the space around him stagnate and then the Imperial chariot in front of him shattered.

The three Yan Immortals sitting in the carriage were heavily injured!

He could no longer wait and see. Jian Wushuang rushed out of the carriage and stood in the void.

Chun Qiu, Cheng Qing, and the others also quickly gathered.

“Brother Jian, how’s the Young Emperor?” Cheng Qing said in a deep voice as he held his True Sword.

“I’m fine.” A gloomy voice sounded, and the Young Emperor stepped out slowly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly. He felt that there were no less than 40 strong auras rushing toward him from all directions!

In the starry void, there were indeed close to 40 Yan Immortals!

Twenty against forty, they were at a huge disadvantage.

However, Chen Qing and the other Yan Immortals still surrounded the Young Emperor.

Then, a gloomy-looking Yan Immortal stepped forward and pointed at the Young Emperor. “Leave him here and I’ll let you live. Otherwise, you’ll die!”

“Who sent you? Is it Prince Jiu or Prince Yu?” the Young Emperor asked in a deep voice.

Yan Immortal laughed sinisterly again. “What’s the use of a dead man knowing more? However, you still have a way out. As long as you turn back, I promise not to hurt a single one of you.”

The Young Emperor sneered. “Are you so sure that you’ve got me?”

“Of course, if I want to, none of you will be able to leave here alive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the entire void seemed to have turned into a quagmire. The vast Yan power directly crushed toward the Young Emperor and the others.

Jian Wushuang snorted and the Invisible Sword in his hand cut through the encirclement. Everything returned to normal.

When Yan Immortal, who was still laughing, saw this, his eyes dimmed and he said, “I thought you were just a bunch of motley crew, but you do have some ability.”

When Chen Qing heard this, he immediately took a step forward and released a vast Yan power.

His realm was rising, and even Jian Wushuang felt that Chen Qing’s realm was far more than just Yan Immortal.

All of the Yan Immortals that surrounded him had a change in expression, “Attack!”

Rumble! Rumble!!!

A total of over 40 Yan Immortals released a terrifying Yan power!

The void was collapsing rapidly, and the violent Yan power shot over like a waterfall.

Cheng Qing waved his hand and a Yan power barrier immediately surrounded everyone, blocking the terrifying power.

Jian Wushuang no longer hesitated. He summoned the invisible sword and moved forward.

This barrier would not last for long. Even though Chen Qing’s cultivation level showed signs of a breakthrough, he was still a Yan Immortal. He could not protect himself from the siege of so many Yan Immortals.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang took the lead and killed the most number of Yan Immortals as soon as possible.

40 Yan Immortals, which was several times more than the time in Jingchuan Tian City.

The Young Emperor’s eyes were bloodshot. The repeated attacks were far beyond his imagination. He did not show any mercy at all.

“Prince Jiu, if I’m still alive, I’ll kill you first!”

The void trembled. With Jian Wushuang as the leader, a total of 60 Yan Immortals began to fight!

After forcing Yan Immortal to retreat a thousand feet, Jian Wushuang threw out the Transcendence Heavenly Gate to severely injure all the enemies who dared to come forward.
