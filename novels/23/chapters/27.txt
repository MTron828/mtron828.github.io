“Amazing!”

“One stroke was enough to dispell her Sword Art? How did he do that?”

“His sword arts are so strong!”

The first fight between the two brought about bursts of exclamations throughout the Drill Ground.

“Jian Wushuang’s understanding of swordsmanship is much better than we ever imagined.” The famous experts on the stands also felt amazed.

They all had broader horizons. Naturally, they could see that Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was extraordinary.

The sword stroke he displayed before seemed simple, but in fact, it required perfect use of the Sword Arts power as well as a high comprehension of basic swordsmanship.

Next, Jian Wushuang used the same Sword Tide and released twelve layers of sword essence, which astonished everyone. After all, Jian Meng’er tried her best but only brought about eight layers of sword essence.

This tremendous difference immediately demonstrated the big gap between their skills.

“Fuck off!”

After an effeminate shout, Jian Meng’er attacked straight ahead indignantly, with her towering Long Sword.

This simple action, carrying an incomparably strong power, was filled with an awe-inspiring righteousness. A magnificent Spiritual Power gathered together and then rushed out all at once, colliding with the onrushing sword essence wave released by Jian Wushuang.

“Tianyuan Sword Skill!” While watching from the stands, Bai Chong’s pupils immediately shrank and he cast a glance at Shui Hanxin, then whispered, “No wonder you’re so confident. Your baby disciple has already practiced Tianyuan Sword Skills!”

Shui Hanxin smiled faintly but stayed silent.

Tianyuan Sword Skill, the supreme sword art that was practiced in Tianyuan Sword Sect, was far stronger than various sword arts in Sword Marquis Mansion. The degree of strength of cultivation Level represented the degree of pureness, precision and momentum of its Spiritual Power.

The overall strength of Jian Meng’er, who practiced the Tianyuan Sword Skill, was definitely far stronger than ordinary people at the Peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. That’s why Jian Meng’er could overcome twenty movements when she competed with the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion by virtue of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm.

The twelve waves of sword essence were scattered Jian Meng’er’s sword strike, then streaks of sword shadow burst out from one of Jian Meng’er’s hands.

Each sword was startlingly fast.

“Aurora Sword Art?” Jian Wushuang slightly raised the corners of his mouth, followed by a sudden cold voice, “I told you before, even though the Aurora Sword Art pursues extreme speed, blindly increasing your speed will affect the coordination and coherence between the Sword Arts. But obviously, you didn’t take my advice. Not to mention that your Sword Art… It’s too slow!”

Too slow!

These words resounded on the Drill Ground and immediately made all of the disciples of Marquis’s mansion stunned.

After all, in their view, Jian Meng’er’s Sword Art was fast enough. They were too fast to be seen with the naked eye. In only an instant, a series of sword shadows rushed out. Dozens of sword shadows were displayed by her, but Jian Wushuang withstood them all.

“Too slow!”

“Too slow!”

Jian Wushuang resisted the swords while shaking his head at the same time. It was clear that he could easily withstand these swords.

Jian Meng’er bit the bullet and tried her best to increase the speed. However, even though she displayed the Aurora Sword Art with her full power, she couldn’t even touch Jian Wushuang’s clothes.

“I’ll show you the real Aurora Sword Art now,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

After saying that, Shua… an awesome sword shadow, much faster than that of Jian Meng’er, rushed out at once.

They were quick like lightning, and the consecutive sword strikes were coordinated and coherent!

“Too fast!”

“Oh my god!”

Lots of cheering erupted on the Drill Ground.

They felt amazed by the speedy swordsmanship of Jian Meng’er. As for Jian Wushuang’s speed with the Aurora Sword Art, they truly felt it was unbelievable.

It was so fast that people couldn’t see it clearly.

“How can it be so fast?” Jian Meng’er was greatly frightened. Seeing the overlapping sword shadows sweeping towards her like lightning, she immediately used the Boulder Sword Art, which was a special defensive Sword Art among the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavillion, to resist with her all strength.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

After many successive clashes, Jian Meng’er was obviously flustered. Jian Wushuang’s Sword Art was so fast that she couldn’t withstand them, and now she was forced into an embarrassing situation.

After the sword light radiated for only a few moments, the Sword Art that was falling like torrential rain suddenly stopped.

“Eighteen breaths!”

Forced to the edge of the tower, Jian Meng’er stared in front of her. at Jian Wushuang. She calculated the breaths while she tried to resist Jian Wushuang’s Sword Art. After Jian Wushuang finished the entire Aurora Sword Art, it was only eighteen breaths.

While she needed at least thirty-seven breaths to display the whole Sword Art.

This meant that Jian Wushuang’s speed with this Sword Art was more than twice as fast as her, and it was obvious that Jian Wushuang displayed it more coherently and with more coordination! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was too fast for her to resist.

Jian Meng’er took a glance at the sleeve of her robe. Two holes from a sword edge could be seen clearly, exposing her white skin, which made her feel shameful.

“Bastard!”

With an angry shout, Jian Meng’er attacked him directly with Triple-kill Sword, fiercely.

Drifting-snow Sword Art!

One of the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts Sword Pavilion!

“It’s ridiculous.”

Jian Wushuang sneered, easily facing this Sword Art. Then he used the Drifting-Snow Sword Art in a more overbearing and aggressive manner.

Just as the old saying goes, “Serve them with the same sauce.”

No matter what Sword Art Jian Meng’er displayed, Jian Wushuang resisted it easily at first and then returned it in a tougher, more mature, and perfect manner.

Superior Swordsmanship!

He completely surpassed her in Sword Arts!

Jian Meng’er’s swordsmanship was already good enough for her to reach the Profound level in all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion. But now, in front of Jian Wushuang, her Sword arts were just like tricks played by little children.

The gap was so big.

“The gap of swordsmanship between the two was even bigger than we expected.” Looking down, Situ Qingyue solemnly said, “Jian Meng’er has good swordsmanship, but Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship is much better!”

“It’s hard to imagine that a sixteen-year-old boy could have such impressive swordsmanship. Jian Xinhong, in Sword Marquis Mansion, are you the only person who has better swordsmanship than this little guy?” Ye Xiu looked toward Jian Xinhong.

As the Sword Marquis Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong had a full understanding of the situation regarding Sword Marquis Mansion. Hearing Ye Xiu’s words at this moment, he couldn’t help nodding in agreement.

As for swordsmanship, merely in Sword Marquis Mansion, he was the only one that was better than Jian Wushuang.
