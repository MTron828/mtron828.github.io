Chapter 1499: Iron Wing Beast

At the island where Wu Bei’s cave was situated.

Swoosh!

A red-robed woman with a bewitching figure arrived.

The red-robed young girl was carrying a giant black sickle. After taking a glance at the entrance of the cave, she plunged into it immediately.

On the island, many experts revealed a shocked expression after seeing the red-robed young girl.

“That’s Demon Girl Ling Luo!”

“It’s her.”

“She actually came as well?”

Those experts sent a message to the Universe Gods in the cave immediately.

Jian Wushuang also received Lei Chao’s message in a split second.

“Demon Girl Ling Luo? The monster ranked number three on the Universe God ranking list?” Jian Wushang’s eyes twinkled slightly.

When the news of Wu Bei’s cave got out, many Universe Gods came in succession. Even the ten monsters in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list were attracted as well.

From the start, four of the top ten of the Universe God ranking list had come. Demon Girl Ling Luo had the highest ranking as of the very moment.

“The person ranked third has come. I wonder if the two monsters ranked first and second respectively will come?” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently. He was filled with a bit of anticipation.

On the fourth day after Jian Wushuang entered Wu Bei’s cave.

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang stopped on a void. The Soul Power that he had released had detected the presence of an Iron Wing Beast that was ten thousand miles away in front of him.

“After entering this cave, I have been using Soul Power to search. In three days, the distance that I have covered has already exceeded hundreds of millions of miles and finally, I have discovered an Iron Wing Beast,” Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically. He wanted to check if the body of the Iron Wing Beast still contained a Qian Kun Ring.

However, before his Soul power was able to permeate the Iron Wing Beast, it was blocked by a special power.

“I can’t check it now,” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

As his Soul Power was unable to seep into the body of the Iron Wing Beast, he was unable to determine if the body of the Iron Wing Beast still contained the White Blaze Fruit.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang also realized that in the surrounding area, there were seven other Universe Gods apart from him.

Among the seven Universe Gods, the one furthest away from him was more than thirty thousand miles away, while the one closest to him was less than five thousand miles away. In such a close vicinity, as soon as he attacked the Iron Wing Beast, the seven Universe Gods would realize immediately and rush over rapidly.

“Although it’s troublesome, there’s no other way. I have to do it.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone fiercely. In the next moment, his body had already made a beeline for the Iron Wing Beast that his Soul Energy had marked.

The Iron Wing Beast had got its name due to the fact that its whole body was filled with completely black scales like pieces of iron. The scales covered its whole body just like a layer of iron armor. However, it did not have wings.

The Iron Wing Beast had a small body and four hooves. At that moment, there was an Iron Wing Beast strolling about in a thick forest.

Jian Wushuang hid his own presence and showed up in the forest quietly. As he looked at the Iron Wing Beast, which was only hundreds of meters away from him, he took out the Blood Mountain Sword and headed over silently.

Jian Wushuang naturally covered the hundreds of meters in an instant.

However, when Jian Wushuang was ten miles behind the Iron Wing Beast, the Iron Wing Beast, which was taking a walk leisurely, became terrified abruptly and turned vigilant instantly.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang stopped concealing his aura. His frightening sword essence burst forth and the Blood Mountain Sword on his hands became crimson lightning instantly.

His Divine Power was released as well.

Real God’s Unique Skill, Crimson Light!

“Roar!”

The Iron Wing Beast gave off a furious and loud roar. It then turned its body swiftly. While it was turning its body, one of its front claws attacked quickly as well.

Likewise, its front claws were composed of the pitch-black scales. In spite of that, it was exceptionally sharp like a saber.

Clang!

The sounds of metals colliding with one another could be heard. The black scales on the front claws of the Iron Wing Beast were cut off. The crimson lightning that Jian Wushuang unleashed paused for a short moment and struck the Iron Wing Beast’s body soon after.

“Roar!!!”

A shrill neigh could be heard from the Iron Wing Beast and this voice was very unconventional. With its small body, the Iron Wing Beast retreated immediately.

“It’s actually not dead?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned grave.

Previously, he had obtained some information. Hence, he knew that the Iron Wing Beast had strong defense. Moreover, they were very agile. As such, a normal Peak Universe God of the Third Heaven would be helpless against them, even if they were to come across one.

However, Jian Wushuang did not expect the Iron Wing Beast’s defense to be so strong.

He had released all his Divine Power, which was combined with Reincarnation Power. With that, he unleashed the Crimson Light. However, he still didn’t manage to kill the Iron Wing Beast.

Swoosh!

A black, glittering light appeared quickly. It was the Iron Wing Beast.

“Trying to escape?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold. He unleashed his speed and at the same time, the Blaze Quicksand Gourd flew over and used all its power to prevent the iron Wing Beast from escaping.

“This Iron Wing Beast’s speed is faster than that of a normal Universe God of the Third Heaven,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly and the first stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood was already activated.

At that moment, when Jian Wushuang attacked the Iron Wing Beast, his shocking sword essence and vast Divine Power started to spread around.

Within tens of thousands of miles of Jian Wushuang, the seven Universe Gods sensed the sword essence and Divine Power at the same time.

“What a strong sword essence. Someone is fighting in this area. Over there!”

“Could it be two cultivators fighting or could it be… Someone has found an Iron Wing Beast?”

“No matter what, I have to head there straight away!”

The seven Universe Gods did not hesitate and hurried over to the forest instantly.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Two figures, one in front and one behind, plunged out of the forest in a flash. However, the distance between the both of them was closing at an amazing speed.

“It’s an Iron Wing Beast!”

“Haha, I have finally come across one!”

“One person alone is actually able to push back the Iron Wing Beast to the point that it is trying its very best to escape?”

The seven Universe Gods who rushed over had already realized the existence of the Iron Wing Beast.

Previously, the Iron Wing Beast stayed inside the forest. If they had not passed by the forest or done a thorough check, they would definitely be unable to discover the existence of the Iron Wing Beast. However, at that moment, the Iron Wing Beast had dashed out of the forest and trying its best to escape. As a result, they found the Iron Wing Beast immediately.

“I wonder if the body of this Iron Wing Beast contains a White Blaze Fruit?”

“I hope there is.”

The seven Universe Gods’ eyes were burning with excitement and they were also approaching Jian Wushuang and the Iron Wing beast at an amazing speed.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang, who had unleashed the first stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood which would increase his speed by tenfold, had already caught up with the Iron Wing Beast.

“Die!”

This time around, Jian Wushuang did not hold back. The same Sword Principle Crimson Light had been used and it was completely filled with Reincarnation Power. Moreover, Jian Wushuan had also activated the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor.

Rustle!

Sword light erupted and with just one attack, the layer of black scales on the body surface of the Iron Wing Beast was shattered into pieces and this caused a bloody wound to appear on the body of the Iron Wing Beast. What followed after was another stroke which went along the bloody wound and penetrated the body of the Iron Wing Beast.
