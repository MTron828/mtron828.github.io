Chapter 997: The Slave

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Dragon Wing Governor argued no more, accepting the Dragon Heart Elixir with amazement.

Despite his laborious efforts, he has yet been able to brew his own Elixir. With only the simple price of leading Jian Wushuang to a Golden-clothed Deacon, he had finally possessed the Elixir which he had so earnestly yearned for. Needless to say, he was awashed with joy at his long-awaited wish fulfilled.

Jian Wushuang wore a thin smile. The Dragon Heart Elixir mattered not to him. It was his father’s whereabouts which mattered most.

Just then…

“What?” Something Jian Wushuang saw made his expression change. He peered intently as his eyes glinted with concentration.

The Guest Room had a clear view of the arena. From the windows of the chamber, he could clearly see two men brutally meleeing at each other.

They were slaves of the arena who were of the Eternal Realm with considerable strengths of their own. Fighting against each other furiously, the audience mob were stirred into fits of electrifying euphoria and maniacal bloodlust as shouts and yells could be heard over the cacophonous hubbub.

To the slaves pummeling at each other, the battle was nothing more than a do-or-die struggle of survival.

It was a mere battle to death which Jian Wushuang had little to no interest nor concern; until he noticed one of the slaves who was clad in a suit of scarlet armor, standing tall at the hulking three meters. His figure shone faintly with a mild blush of glow as he had shown himself in possession of great physical strength.

His opponent was also a powerful fighter in his own right, having remarkable attacking strengths that was hardly eclipsed by that of the hulking slave. Still, the shorter man lacked the stout defenses of his adversary.

The brute strength of the hulking man was greater even than warriors at the pinnacle of the Eternal Realm. With the help of his massive physical strength, his crude and savage methods of fighting earned him a victory as his opponent fell.

All these did not escape the observation of Jian Wushuang’s keen eyes.

“That huge man… the Secret Skill he’s trained in…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed his eyes, turning instead to the Dragon Wing Governor beside him.

“I have another favor to ask of you, Governor.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Please, anything you want.” The governor answered, looking enthusiastic.

“I want that man.” Jian Wushuang said, his finger pointing to the huge man who had just emerged victorious in his fight.

“That’s easy.” The Dragon Wing Governor smiled. He summoned for a steward and whispered into his ears.

The steward listened closely and swiftly disappeared through the doors.

Within the subterranean catacombs beneath the arena where the slaves are kept, the huge man had just returned from his fight at the ring. He appeared amongst the slaves swarming together and plopped to a seat on the ground.

“Eight games, twelve more to go!” The man hissed with his fists clenched.

The slaves were bought at costly prices from warriors who had forced them into bondage and servitude. The slaves would then be thrown into the rings where they have to fight against each other in duels and games betted upon by the mob of audiences, generating huge profits for the management of the arena.

Then again, there was but one way the slaves could regain their freedom.

The slaves will be rewarded with their freedom if they are able to survive and win twenty games.

With his most recent triumph, the huge man has won eight games, living no opponent alive.

He will have to secure twelve more victories to secure his much-awaited freedom.

Then again, the slaves are mostly paired against opponents who were similar in power and ability. Even though he could almost see the end of his bondage, the huge man who yet doubtful if he could maintain his winning streak.

“I wonder if I, Qing Bin, will be able to return to my population one day?”

The huge man sighed quietly to himself.

Just then, a steward came over to him. It was the very same who had been bidden by the Dragon Wing Governor earlier. The steward peered intently through every through every face until he finally found the huge man.

“You there. Come with me,” ordered the steward sharply..

“Me?” The huge man was stunned as he grimaced with despair. “I had just finished one game and I barely had time to recuperate. Are they forcing me to another fight again?”

“You are not going to the ring. There are two masters who requested your presence.” The steward explained.

“Me? What for?” The huge man was puzzled. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Just come with me and you’ll know.” The steward said simply, without explaining even more.

Before long, the huge man was lead into the Guest Room where Jian Wushuang awaited.

Stepping into the chamber, he saw two men sitting together.

“I present to you this slave, Governor, as you requested.” The steward announced respectfully.

“This man shall henceforth be no longer a slave of the arena.” The Dragon Wing Governor ordered.

“As you wish, Governor.” The steward nodded his acknowledgment and left at once.

“This is the man you requested, my friend.” The Governor turned to Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Good.” Jian Wushuang nodded lightly.

The slave was confused, perplexed and bewildered.

“I-I, I’m no longer a slave?” His face was filled with shock and disbelief, feeling slightly disorientated by the sudden turn of events.

Never would he be able to believe any of this, if it were not for the Governor himself who had announced this through his own lips.

Knowing that the arena had bought him at a dear price, he was certain that his freedom would never come easily.

Be that as it may, the huge man could sense that the man who had just proclaim his freedom from bondage was hardly simple and ordinary.

“He was addressed as ‘Governor’, could he be the Dragon Wing Governor?”?The huge man finally realized and stared at the two men before him strangely.?“Who is the stranger beside him then? It seems that the Dragon Wing Governor holds him with great respect. A man who is only of the Eternal Realm?”

“I have a few questions for you that I hope you are able to answer truthfully. Should I find your answers satisfying, you will be granted your freedom and you will no longer have to fight in the arena,” said Jian Wushuang, studying at the slave before him.

“As you wish, Sir.” The huge man replied, growing anxious.

He knew full well that it was essentially impossible for him to survive through twenty battles to achieve his freedom. Little did he doubt that he would surely die one day, lying in a pool of his own blood in the ring. Yet, now, before him, stood an off-chance that he might be able to escape his enslavement unscathed.

“I saw you fight, you’re strong,” said Jian Wushuang, “I believe, your brute strength comes from the bloodline you inherited and your Secret Skill. It has been cultivated to the highest degree, no?”

“Yes, I did cultivate a Secret Skill that enhances physical strength, and the Skill is already at the highest level.” The huge man nodded at once.

“And unless I am very much mistaken, the Skill that you have trained yourself in is none other than the Immortality Secret Skill.” Jian Wushuang revealed sternly.
