Chapter 1258: The Seventh Divine General

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In a grand hall of the black castle.

Universe God Feiyu and Universe God Chen sat side by side.

“Jian Wuhshuang, generally speaking, there are two positions on Scarlet Island for an advanced Universe Master to choose from, Supervisor and Divine General,” Universe God Feiyu told Jian Wushuang.

“A Supervisor is responsible for the inspection of our territory and some special places. Many people dream of this job, because no one dares to offend a Supervisor in his local territory. So if you become a Supervisor, you can lead an easy life and make personal fortunes.”

Feiyu was telling the truth.

A Supervisor in Scarlet Island did have a lot of chances to make money.

“The Divine General would go to Nine Star Sea, the Perimeter of our territory, where there are a great deal of experts. Also, you have to come in contact with other forces like Golden-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture. Fierce battles are inevitable!”

“A Divine General needs to fight wars in the name of Scarlet Island. It’s more dangerous than a Supervisor, but you will gain more opportunities.”

“You should decide which one is better for you. I’ll give you three days to make a choice,” Universe God Feiyu said.

“Not necessary. I can make my choice now. I want to be a Divine General,” Jian Wushang replied.

“Oh?” Universe God Feiyu and Universe God Chen smiled at each other.

They were not surprised.

When Jian Wshuang fought with Universe God Chen, they found he was aggressive.

An aggressive person like him would never choose to be a Supervisor.

Such was the fact.

At present, Jian Wushuang wanted to practice more in order to face Inverse Cultivation Disaster .

He would not join Scarlet Island if he wanted to have an easy life.

“Here is your ID Token. Take it and find commander Man Yi in Nine Star Sea. He will arrange everything.” Universe God Feiyu tossed a token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the token and put it into his Interspatial Ring. Then, he bowed and walked away.

He walked out of the black castle and left for Nine Star Sea.

Nine Star Sea, the Perimeter of Scarlet Island, was a boundless sea that engulfed the whole Dayu World.

Scarlet Island was one of the Three Hegemons outside the Dayu World. It controlled a vast territory. The city where Jian Wushuang stayed was distant from Nine Star Sea. Since this land was unique, he was unable to reach there by spaceship, so Jian Wushuang spent six months walking to Nine Star Sea.

After he arrived at the military base in Nine Star Sea, he went to see Commander Man Yi.

Commander Man Yi was second only to the Lord in strength and influence. All the experts in Nine Star Sea were under the command of him.

“I’m Jian Wushuang, Your Highness.”

Jian Wushuang saw the Commander in a palace.

The strapping man was about three meters high. With whiskers on the cheeks, he looked like a brown bear. The aura he released was very tyrannical.

“You are Jian Wushuang?”

He glanced at Jian Wushuang, “Feiyu mentioned you not long ago. He said you were good at swordsmanship. You even displayed advanced unique skills at the First Realm. With only the strength of Universe Master, Chen had to defeat you by a sword!”

“He went easy on me,” Jian Wushuang replied humbly.

“Good.” Commander Man Yi had a cold look on his face. “It’s amazing for an advanced Universe Master to display unique skills at the level of Universe Master, but few of geniuses like you become Universe Gods. If you are frivolous, I’m sure you will suffer the God Test!”

“I got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“How long have you cultivated, Jian Wushang?” the Commander asked. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Well,” Jian Wushuang hesitated for a while and answered, “nearly ten thousand years.”

In fact, he had cultivated for less than five thousand years. He was unwilling to attract attention, so he said a longer time.

“Do you mean less than ten thousand years?” Looking at Jian Wushang in astonishment, Commander Man Yi asked him, “Were you born in Dayu World or Eternal World?”

“I was born in Eternal World and recently left my hometown.” Jian Wushuang answered honestly.

“Recently? So you have reached the level of an advanced Universe Master on your own in the ordinary Eternal World in less than ten hundred years. You’re a true genius.” Commander Man Yi nodded and said, “In Nine Star Sea, there are six Divine Generals under my command. From now on, you’re the seventh.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang said immediately.

“This is your ID token. It contains unique aura from which experts on Scarlet Island can know you for a Divine General.” Commander Man Yi added, “Now I have a mission for you.”

“The mission is simple. You can use it for practice.”

“Well, somebody call the Second and the Fifth Divine General!”

Commander Man Yi ordered peremptorily without giving Jian Wushuang any time to ask questions.

Soon, two figures came in.

“Your Highness.”

They were a man and a woman. The man was handsome and looked a little defiant.

The woman was extremely attractive, but her aura was extremely tyrannical.

“Jian Wushuang, they are the second Divine General Lin Dong and the fifth Divine General Mo You.” the commander introduced both sides briefly. “This is Jian Wushuang, the person who has just joined our Scarlet Island.”

The two Divine Generals nodded at Jian Wushuang.

“Both of them already know about the mission. Just ask them later, Jian Wushuang.” Commander Man Yi said in a loud voice and then turned toward Lin Dong and Mo You. “It’s a simple mission. Give him a chance to practice.”

“Understood, your Excellency.” Lin Dong and Mo You nodded gravely.

“Well, go prepare for the mission.”

The commander waved his hand. Then, the three Divine Generals left.
