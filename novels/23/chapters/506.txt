“The power of that attack has already reached the Saint Realm,”?Jian Wushuang thought privately.

A hail of exclamations rose from the crowd.

Qing Huo’s eyes lit up. “Very good. When I was 16, I had only mastered Level Two of the Bone Fusion Technique, but you’re only 15 and have already reached this level. On this point, you’re stronger than me.”

“Yep,” Qing Hu said with somewhat pride, “Dad, I’ll become Divine General, just like you. I will definitely be stronger than you.”

“Haha!” The group of people laughed.

“OK, but seriously, leader, I have something to tell you,” Qing Huo said soberly.

“Let’s talk inside,” Wu Yuan replied. Then they all glided toward the tent.

The clansmen also left.

“Little Yu, Qing Huo just mentioned the Bone Fusion Technique. What is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Wu Yu immediately responded, “It’s a Body Reshaping Technique that our clansman practice from childhood. It can help us improve in both body and strength.

“I have also practiced this technique, but I’m still weaker than Qing Hu and haven’t reached Level One. Qing Hu had already succeeded at my age.”

“A Body Reshaping Technique that improves body and strength?” Jian Wushuang was surprised and asked, “Little Yu, may I read it?”

“Of course.” Wu Yu nodded and pointed forward. “There it is.”

Jian Wushuang saw a pitch-black stone tablet standing on the edge of the Drill Ground.

He had never noticed this stone tablet every since he arrived here.

“The Bone Fusion Technique is carved on that stone tablet?” Jian Wushuang wore an odd look.

He walked toward the stone tablet with Wu Yu. On the stone tablet, he saw many tightly packed small characters carved on it.

The technique,?“Bone Fusion,”?was comprised of thousands of characters and was divided into four levels.

“A technique is exhibited here?”?Jian Wushuang was astonished and then asked, “Little Yu, can I practice this technique?”

“Its first four levels are widely spread throughout the Monster Continent. Many clansmen have cultivated this technique, so it’s OK if you want to practice. Big Brother Wushuang, since your body is so powerful, haven’t you practiced a similar technique before?” Wu Yu wondered.

“My father said we can only practice one technique like this.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He had a powerful body because of the Heavenly Creation Skill and his own cultivation.

He had never practiced a Body Reshaping Technique that could improve his body strength. Actually, the Heavenly Creation Skill, which was related to Spiritual Power, was only a Cultivation Method.

“I don’t know whether this technique will work for me, but I have to try,”?Jian Wushuang thought while looking at the stone tablet.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He sat with his legs crossed and started to practice the first level of the Bone Fusion Technique.

Wu Yu waited by his side.

Bone Fusion Technique was a special skill for cultivating bones.

Jian Wushuang had never heard of it in the Divine Land.

The practitioner’s own body affected his cultivation speed.

The more powerful the body was, the more easily the practitioner would improve.

After a while, Jian Wushuang realized that he had reached Level One of the Bone Fusion Technique.

“So easy.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but he was not surprised.

His body was comparable to a superior second-grade magic weapon. Even the Cloud Realm monster spy’s body was inferior to his.

For his body, practicing this technique was as easy as drinking water.

He began to practice Level Two of the Bone Fusion Technique.

He also succeeded in reaching Level Two with ease.

Level Three and Level Four were also as easy as pie for him.

Jian Wushuang felt a change in his body.

“This feels great!”

“My body is...”

Jian Wushuang realized that his body had become three times stronger than before.

Three times!

“Gosh!”

Jian Wushuang was totally stunned.

He had wondered whether this technique would be helpful to him, but it gave him a big surprise after he reached Level Four.

How powerful he was now?

“I feel like I’m stronger than those Cloud Realm experts in the Divine Land,” Jian Wushuang said, then sighed.

He was only in the Saint Realm. Owing to the Heavenly Creation Skill, his Spiritual Power was superior to other experts at the same level, but much weaker than Cloud Realm experts. However, with his Spiritual Power and body strength, he could fight against Cloud Realm experts.

Nevertheless, he was able to fight a Cloud Realm expert by only using his body strength now. Aided by his Spiritual Power, he was more powerful than an ordinary Cloud Realm expert.

It meant that if he, a Saint Realm expert with seven Origin Marks, exerted his full strength, he could defeat a Seven-cloud Realm expert.

That wasn’t even counting his Sword Soul.

It only took a short while for Jian Wushuang to reach Level Four of the Bone Fusion Technique and improve exponentially.

“I know the Fourth Level is not the highest.” Jian Wushuang stared at the characters on the stone tablet.

The Fourth Level was not the end of Bone Fusion Technique, but the higher levels were not carved on the stone tablet.
