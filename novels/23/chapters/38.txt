Chapter 39: Inescapable Net

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Feeling the killing intention from Jian Wushuang, Sima Bu could not help but secretly shake his head.

He could understand Jian Wushuang’s killing intent toward Blood Feather Tower, but Blood Feather Tower was so powerful that not everyone could provoke it.

Sitting in the cave, Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly with his eyes closed, slowly restraining his tremendous killing intent from the extreme anger that he originally felt. It was apparent that he had already calmed himself down.

“For me, Blood Feather Tower is a genuine colossus and I can’t compete with them at my present strength. So I must endure for now.”

“Endure, hide and wait!”

Jian Wushuang held his hands so tightly that his nails dug into his palm until he was bleeding.

Although his heart was full of killing intent, he needed to restrain his sharp edge.

“In addition to revenge, I also have to find a solution to make all these things clear,” Jian Wushuang growled.

Although he now knew his own lot and the huge blood debt that was on his shoulders, he still had many doubts in his heart.

For example, what on earth was Sword Soul?

Why had Blood Feather Tower tried to kill him and his father, who had awakened their Sword Souls, regardless of everything?

In addition, what was the Ancestor’s Land that his aunt, Ji Wuyue, told him about with her last words?

There were many, many doubts that he slowly needed to explore.

“Strength… In the final analysis, my strength was so weak that I had no ability to stand against Blood Feather Tower when it chased after me to kill me. I only survived by good luck with the help of my aunt and Elder Hong, who sacrificed themselves for me!

“If my strength had been great enough that Blood Feather Tower feared me and did not even dare to offend me, then none of this would have happened!

“Strength! Strength!”

Jian Wushuang growled crazily in his heart.

He had never had a thirst for strength as great as he did now. Even before, when he was betrayed by Jian Meng’er, he had not come to this point.

After all, he fought with Jian Meng’er for his own dignity, for his father’s dignity, and for the dignity of the Sword Pavilion. But with Blood Feather Tower, it was a blood feud that would never stop until death.

In such an unprecedented desire for strength, even Jian Wushuang himself did not realize that the Spiritual Power in his body had sprung up at that moment, and the Heavenly Creation Skill had operated naturally.

Heavenly Creation Skill, the Technique of Claiming.

Suddenly… “Om!”

Jian Wushuang’s body suddenly shuddered, with a sense of amazement in his eyes, followed by surprise.

“Has the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path been broken through? So unbelievable.”

Even Jian Wushuang did not think that his cultivation would naturally make a breakthrough while he was full of an unprecedented desire for strength. It must be known that, just a few days ago, he relied on absorbing a large amount of Primordial Spiritual Liquid to promote himself to the Eighth Heaven of the Divine Path.

And now, just a few days later, a huge breakthrough had directly been made.

The Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path was equivalent to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm of common Warriors. So that, along with the advantage of the Heavenly Creation Skill on strength, even if he did not use the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, his Spiritual Power would not be weaker than Jian Meng’er, who had achieved the peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm.

His strength had risen again!

“The Heavenly Creation Skill is so amazing.” Jian Wushuang could not help thinking that, and was more confident with his future growth.

The Blood Feather Tower was indeed a colossus for him now, but in the future, it might not be.

“My father, my mother, my aunt, the Four Elders, the Ji Clan, and all the innocent people who have been implicated in this fight for me—I, Jian Wushuang, will bet all of myself to assure you that, in my lifetime, I will certainly slaughter Blood Feather Tower and uproot it. I will avenge you!”

Jian Wushuang, with cold eyes, had a determination that ran deep in his blood!

…

The next morning—

“Boy, you stay here and wait for me while I go to the nearby cities to fish for information,” Sima Bu said.

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded, he also knew that Blood Feather Tower would not take things lying down.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the cave alone and cultivated quietly. After about an hour, Sima Bu came back.

“Brother Bu, how is it going?” Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

“The situation is a lot worse than I thought. I walked around in a nearby city and there were no less than 10 assassins from Blood Feather Tower that I was aware of, as well as those who were hidden deep inside, so there must have been more that I couldn’t find. What’s more, I went to a secret intelligence station of the Golden-Dragon Palace and learned that Blood Feather Tower has issued a Scarlet Arrest Warrant for you. Now there are many scouts from Blood Feather Tower lurking around all the big cities, only waiting for you to appear,” Sima Bu said solemnly.

“It can be said that Blood Feather Tower has formed a tight dragnet in Bashui Commandery, even in the entire Tianyan Province. So if you did appear, you would be killed by the experts of Blood Feather Tower without any ability to struggle. And with the intelligence capabilities of Blood Feather Tower, even if you bring a mask or camouflage your appearance, you will be noticed immediately by them as long as there is the slightest trace or flaw.

“I was going to bring you back to Golden-dragon Palace in Bashui Commandery to accomplish this task, but now it seems impossible,” said Sima Bu.

“I can’t stay in Bashui Commandery for now.” Jian Wushuang said with a low tone, “Not even Tianyan Province is safe. I must leave quickly.”

“You are right.” Sima Bu nodded. “I realized it out on my way back. Right now, Blood Feather Tower is mainly focused on killing you inside of Tianyan Province, where it is difficult for you to survive. But in other provinces, you still have space to live, and the most suitable for you is Tiannan Province, located in the surrounding area of Tianyan Province.

“Tiannan Province is one of the main provinces where the Gladiator Arena operates, so the forces of Blood Feather Tower are not very strong there. It’s the most suitable place for you to go. But the road from Bashui Commandery to Tiannan Province is relatively long and it requires passing through the Dark Forest.”

“The Dark Forest?” Jian Wushuang gazed slightly.

He had also heard of the Dark Forest, which is a vast forest between Tianyan Province and Tiannan Province. It was famous as a dangerous place full of spirit beasts and crisis.

“Then, I will go to Tiannan Province.” Jian Wushuang said seriously, “As for the Dark Forest, I’ll just have passed through it.”

“Haha, you are young, but you have great courage. Don’t worry, I will go to Tiannan Province with you and escort you through the Dark Forest safely.” Sima Bu laughed.

“Even without you, I still have to go through the Dark Forest.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with energy.

Tiannan Province was his only chance to live and no one could stand in the way of his survival.
