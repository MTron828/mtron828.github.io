Chapter 5250: Madness

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The individual combat power of the Devouring Demon was the same, but the cultivators here possessed extraordinary strength, enough to rival 6-Star Devouring Demons.

Even MO Long could effortlessly annihilate hundreds of 2-Star Devouring Demons with a mere wave of his hand.

Si Tian‚Äôs claw techniques were even more frenzied, his enormous blood claws tearing through the sky. The formation of thousands of Devouring Demons was instantly torn apart, reduced to dust and completely annihilated.

In the span of a breath, 100,000 2-Star Devouring Demons fell.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang had just unsheathed the long sword from his back.

The sword light was sharp; each stroke seemed to bring a whole world down upon them. The fusion of heart power and sword intent erupted into an unmatched momentum.

Roar!

A streak of sword light cut across the battlefield.

This strand of sword energy arrogantly charged into the formation of Devouring Demons, disrupting everything. The sharp Sword Intent ravaged the forms of the Devouring Demons.

Boom!

Before the figure fully materialized, the Sword Intent filled the sky.

Many cultivators, upon seeing Jian Wushuang enter the fray, became even more frenzied. They were genuinely afraid that if Jian Wushuang struck ruthlessly again, they would be left with nothing.

‚ÄúQuick! Strike faster!‚Äù some teams of Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals couldn‚Äôt help but roar.

They could resist the fourth wave of attacks at most. The fifth wave would consist of a million 2-Star Devouring Demons; by then, it would be much harder for them to handle the situation.

Either they fought desperately in the fourth wave, or retire in the fifth wave.

If the fourth wave didn‚Äôt fight, they wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance against the fifth wave‚Äôs attack. A millionfold pressure wasn‚Äôt just ten times what they faced now.

Feeling the overwhelming sword intent, Dao Lord Si Tian‚Äôs face turned solemn.

100,000 2-Star Devouring Demons fell within three breaths, all perishing.

The Devouring Demons, now broken and falling from the sky, turned into wisps of black smoke before they even hit the ground. They swirled in the sky, ultimately absorbed by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang sheathed his sword, closed his eyes slowly, and opened his hands, relishing in this feast.

While these Devouring Demons intended to consume them, Jian Wushuang aimed to consume them instead.

Hehe‚Ä¶

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, gazing into the darkness, staring at the dense black mist. The sinister aura in his eyes intensified.

Since he started devouring these Demon Lords, he noticed his devouring ability grew stronger, but his demands also increased. However, his proficiency in the Extreme Dao remained stagnant.

‚ÄúThis is the purest Dao of Devouring!‚Äù Jian Wushuang suppressed his aura. At this moment, he finally understood the difference between them.

His Extreme Dao encompassed all things, while the source within the

Devouring Demons was the purest origin source of Devouring.

The disparity between the two was vast.

As the saying goes, ‚ÄúThe Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, and three gives birth to all things!‚Äù

The Extreme Dao encompasses everything; this is the purest origin source of the Dao. All other Daos are merely derived branches, while all things are the origin of the Dao.

Inhaling deeply, Jian Wushuang returned to the city walls, contemplating the Extreme Dao.

‚ÄúAll things!‚Äù Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows, a look of perplexity on his

face.

If all things were the purest essence and encapsulated so many Daos, how would he merge them into a single Dao in the future?

It was a colossal challenge. While he could still point his sword to his true heart on the Ultimate Sword Dao, the path of Dao merge was still nebulous. However, the Extreme Daoo was utterly elusive to him.

Now, he grasped a glimmer of insight and diligently pondered every opportunity.

Especially regarding devouring. If he relied on comprehending all things, even if the universe crumbled, he wouldn‚Äôt fully comprehend it. He had to keep devouring other cultivators to swiftly progress.

This time, devouring these Demon Lords yielded tremendous gains. At the very least, his understanding of all things was no longer superficial.

Thanks to devouring these Demon Lords, he could sense the Dao. If he devoured those Grand Yan Immortals, he could assimilate 30 percent of a complete Dao.

He had improved significantly, surpassing his previous self. This counted as a great harvest.

Unfortunately, there was no Grand Yan Immortal available for him to test his abilities. Without it, he couldn‚Äôt possibly engage with others.

In the fifth wave of the siege, Jian Wushuang continued to lead from the front. His demand for treasure points was quite significant at this point.

Fortunately, the immense power of the One Thought Universe kept him at the top of the rankings. When this phase of the battle settled, there were considerable rewards for the top ranks. He couldn‚Äôt afford to miss out this time, especially after the significant loss he had suffered last time. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Hu Qing held the top spot, having earned 100,000 treasure points.

In this phase of the trial, both treasures and treasure points had increased several times over.

Especially with the exchange system inside the City Lord‚Äôs Mansion opened, the competition was much fiercer than the first phase.

Despite the lack of substantial casualties at the moment, the escalating intensity made it impossible for anyone to stop.

In the fifth wave, a million 2-Star Devouring Demons attacked. The Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, who had originally planned to retire after gaining treasure points, immediately exchanged for a set of peak-level treasure armor and some treasures to enhance their strength, gearing up for another battle.

Some even broke through during the fight, just entering the Perfected Nine Revolutions stage, granting them top-tier combat abilities. The battle became even more chaotic and frenzied.

The more they fought, the braver they became. Jian Wushuang could sense the spirit of training in this.

More than 10,000 Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals had fallen by half, but the remaining half showed no intention of stopping.

‚ÄúThis is the last wave. If we can gather enough treasure points for the Hundred-Leaf Flower, I can break through,‚Äù said a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, his eyes filled with determination.

If they couldn‚Äôt break through, they would retire. If they did, they would continue to fight.

They fought to sustain the fight, even if it meant fighting to the death.

Retirement was a term only a handful of Nine Revolutions, those without hope of breaking through, embraced. The rest, those who still harbored even a glimmer of hope for advancement, or those few Nine Revolutions whose strength surpassed the norm, chose to continue the fight.

Among the Nine Revolutions, there were indeed some who, through the trials of life and death, broke through the ultimate barrier, achieving Perfected Nine Revolutions. They exchanged their points for a set of peak-level treasures, instantly elevating their power to that of top-level Grand Yan Immortal.

Now, even the weakest among the Perfected Nine Revolutions at the peak-level could effortlessly slaughter 2-Star Devouring Demons.

In the first six waves of battle, there was no real threat. Among them, there were even examples of origin source breakthroughs, transforming into peak-level experts.

At this moment, the attention of the crowd was not on the top-tier combat power; instead, they were all focused on the top-level Grand Yan Immortals or Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals.

Seeing them break through and become stronger stirred the blood of the onlookers.

At least this was real. Looking up to figures like Jian Wushuang had never been realistic.

In the fifth wave of battles, they spent only ten breaths of time; now, the sixth wave began.

Jian Wushuang could sense that if a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal could not break through in this battle, it would only lead to death.

Ten million 2-Star Devouring Demons.

In the past, only peak-level experts like MO Long dared to directly confront this wave. Yet these Nine Revolutions fought with reckless abandon.

Each of these ten million of Devouring Demons was vastly stronger than them.

They could only rely on numbers for victory, but now, the enemy‚Äôs numbers

outnumbered them 100-fold.

To be precise, it was 10,000-fold..
