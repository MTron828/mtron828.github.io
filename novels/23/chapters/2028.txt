2029 Finally Succeed

“Twenty years…” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but clench his fists.

Twenty years happened to be what he needed then.

He was very close to the completion of Immemorial Celestial Body at the beginner level. Twenty years would be enough for him to complete the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body.

“Let’s begin!”

Jian Wushuang seized the time to cultivate.

Of course, besides cultivating the Immemorial Celestial Body, he would symbolically walk around the opportunity lands occasionally.

In Imperial Peak, there was peace and quiet.

At least it looked peaceful. With Imperial Cabinet attending the garrison duty personally, the experts and geniuses in Imperial Peak obeyed the rules and no one acted recklessly.

The time flew past. In the blink of an eye, there was only one month left until Doctrine Propagation Ceremony.

Jian Wushuang was in the secret room in the pavilion he stayed in.

Vroom. There was a billowing divine power that surrounded Jian Wushuang’s divine body. On the surface of Jian Wushuang’s body, there was a faint black jade lustre. The black jade lustre even substantiated and formed armor.

“The first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body, completed!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and there was light glistening in his eyes.

At the same time, his divine body and divine power were experiencing a drastic change.

Immemorial Celestial Body was a secret skill of body refinery. Its biggest function was to strengthen one’s divine body. However, his divine power would improve too.

For instance, Jian Wushuang’s divine body and divine power were greatly affected. His divine power, which was originally fierce and pure and not inferior to a Great Emperor’s, was improving tremendously.

After a short while, it had completely transformed.

As the divine power transformed, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but clench his fists and feel the billowing strength in him.

“Amazing. My divine power should have increased by three times!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were wide open and he was shocked.

He knew that his divine power would improve tremendously when he completed the first volume of Secret skill of Immemorial Celestial Body, but he had never expected the improvement to be so drastic.

Three times the power!!!

When one’s power reached Great Emperor level, it could be considered a great improvement if his power were to increase by thirty percent. Let alone the fact that he improved by three times!

In terms of divine power strength, he was three times stronger than an ordinary Great Emperor. In addition to his ancient tribe bloodline power, his power was definitely four to five times stronger than an ordinary Great Emperor’s.

How great was the difference?

It meant that he could absolutely suppress any ordinary Great Emperor like breaking a piece of dead wood in terms of strength and power.

“In Sanctuary Alliance, putting Emperor Bai aside, the next strongest person is Red Dragon King. Even if he were to perform his full power using his unique bloodline, he would at most be three to four times stronger than an ordinary Great Emperor. Hence, I am stronger by a notch in terms of power,” Jian Wushuang was thrilled.

The tremendous improvement in strength power also signified his improvement in overall power.

Now, he was weaker in comprehension towards doctrine. However, he could still fight against the top few in Sanctuary Alliance. He was fearless against Red Dragon King and Abysmal Saint Master. In terms of power and strength, he might even have the upper hand.

In terms of divine power itself, the improvement was already so significant. Immemorial Celestial Body was actually greatest at improving one’s divine body…

Jian Wushuang immediately started to inspect his divine body.

His divine power was made of pure divine power, which was already powerful. Then, as he completed the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body, the surface of his skin was faintly covered by a layer of jade black armor. The durability of his divine body had been through a drastic change.

Such a divine body was far beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination. Even Jian Wushuang himself didn’t know how powerful his divine body was.

However, he had a feeling that if he were to be hemmed in by the six Great Emperors again, besides Ling Zong, who was the strongest among the six Great Emperors, the other six could hardly hurt him. Forget about being surrounded for eight breaths, he could even survive twenty or even thirty breaths. His divine body wouldn’t be damaged badly and he wouldn’t expend much divine power either.

“With such a powerful divine body, in addition to the defense power of Five Gem Armor and my perfect Chaotic divine body, I will instantly recover my divine body via divine power. My survival ability or even attack resistant ability… are absolutely out of this world!” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

He was absolutely confident that besides Emperor Bai, who was an inverse cultivator like him on the final stage of the seventh step in inverse cultivation, there was no one else who could surpass him in terms of defense skill. He was simply unkillable.

“The moment I successfully cultivated Immemorial Celestial Body, my overall power increased tremendously. Now, I should begin preparations,” Jian Wushuang muttered and instantly communicated with his team members in Blood Mountain Sword, “Great Emperor Zhi Luo, I am going to walk along the border of the great formation around Imperial Peak. You see if you could make a spacetime tunnel from here.”

“Mm,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo nodded faintly.

One month later, the Doctrine Propagation Ceremony would take place and they intended to take action on the same day.

Before they could do that, they had to consider their route of escape.

Regardless of if they could destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock or the surrounding golden whirlpool, they had to be prepared to leave Imperial Peak and Imperial City.

Jian Wushuang maintained the disguise of a brawny man who was casual in manner. He came to the border of the great formation that engulfed the entire Imperial Peak and walked around casually along the border of the formation.

He looked like he was taking a leisurely walk but in actual fact, Great Emperor Zhi Luo in Blood Mountain Sword was inspecting the great formation and surrounding spacetime.

He walked for over ten days straight while Great Emperor Zhi Luo continued to study, but they didn’t come up with any conclusion.

The four of them weren’t in a hurry though.

Just then…

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang, who was casually walking along the border of the great formation, suddenly looked up. He saw two figures flying towards him.

The aura that the two figures carried was only in early stage Chaotic Realm. Plus, they looked extremely strong. One of them happened to be Lin Tianhao, who shared a “long-standing friendship” with Jian Wushuang.

The two of them noticed Jian Wushuang’s existence and immediately walked over.

“Heh, isn’t this Ah Shou? What are you doing?” Lin Tianhao squinted his eyes and there was a glimpse of coldness in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang crossed his hands before his chest and pouted, “What does it have to do with you?”

Lin Tianhao’s face grew grave. He was used to Jian Wushuang’s rude replies. On the contrary, the handsome young man next to him said, “Tianhao, who is this? He seems to be very arrogant.”
