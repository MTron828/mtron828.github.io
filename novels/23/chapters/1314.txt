Chapter 1315: Fought Hard Against Three Sacred Thunders!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

What Jian Wushuang did on the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle astonished everyone.

“What the hell is he doing?”

“Why did he take off his sergeant’s armor when the God Test came? He doesn’t even have an intention of warding off the Sacred Thunder!”

“Did he give up resisting and is waiting to die?”

“Is he going to die?”

At this moment, the heavens were roaring continuously.

Everyone witnessed that the purple-gold Sacred Thunder directly struck the body of Jian Wushuang without weakening at all.

Bang!

A deafening noise broke out.

Even Universe Gods in the Second Heaven expressed their surprise about the annihilatory power.

Obviously they were amazed about how powerful the purple-gold thunder was.

Everyone was fully concentrating on what was happening on the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle. After the purple-gold thunder disappeared, Jian Wushuang, a three-meter-tall ancient god still stood there and held his hands tightly, with the force of the purple-gold thunder covering his body.

And, suddenly, he raised his head.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang violently shook his body. The force of the purple-gold thunder dispersed instantly and his bones produced a cracking sound.

“Great!” Jian Wushuang felt excited.

He rumbled, with a sound loud enough to shake the whole universe.

Talent out of the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw Jian Wushuang.

“He is still safe and sound? How come?”

“Impossible!”

“He hasn’t got any injuries after being stuck by the Scared Thunder? Even his breath remains the same, or, has become powerful?”

All bystanders were speechless.

Among them, a Universe God from the Second Heaven cried out, “If I were him, I would have to do whatever I could to resist such a huge thunder. But he just…resisted it only with the power in his body?”

In the distant heaven afar, Dayu Palace Master and Lord Wu Cang looked at each other, feeling amazed.

“Resist the thunder with his own body power. How brave he is!” Dayu Palace said.

Actually, there had been similar cases in the Eternal Chaotic World but they were few. After all, no one wanted to risk dying with his body totally destroyed.

But today, they saw Jian Wushuang successfully resist the Thunder Test with his own body power.

“It is just the start of the Test.” Dayu Palace Master murmured.

Lord Wu Cang also raised his head and looked at heaven.

Other bystanders also stopped talking.

Normally, cultivators only had to go through one Sacred Thunder in the first part of their God Test.

But obviously, the God Test of Jian Wushuang was far more difficult than that. After the first Sacred Thunder, the thundercloud did not dissipate, but quickly begin to form the second thunder.

At this time, Jian Wushuang stood at the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle and stared at the heaven, with his blood violently boiling and his hands filled with electricity.

After the a while, the second Sacred Thunder shot from the center of the thundercloud.

With the same purple-gold color, the second Sacred Thunder was twice as large as the first one.

Boom!

The second purple-gold Sacred Thunder, which contained far more annihilatory power than the first one, shot to Jian Wushuang all of a sudden.

Under unimaginable pressure, Jian Wushuang still left the Blood-killing Plate Armor aside and stood there without any intention to use defense.

He only used his own body power to resist the second thunder!

“Doesn’t he need defense yet? The second thunder is much more powerful!”

“This crazy man!”

Those watching Jian Wushuang couldn’t help crying out.

Under the gaze of all, the second thunder struck Jian Wushuang, who still took no defense at all.

A horrible power broke out from the thunder, strongly hitting the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle, which then sunk and formed into the endless hole. In that hole, the earth was severely burnt and barren.

Right at the bottom of the hole, a figure, still strong and powerful, resiliently stood all the torture.

Although parts of his body were bleeding or burnt, or even mutilated, he still stood firmly and his breath and power didn’t weaken but even strengthened!

He stepped out of the huge hole, and at the same time, his mutilated skin all recovered at an incredibly fast rate.

Without the help of King of Venomous Worms, Jian Wushuang could still recover himself within a short time.

“He hasn’t….died?”

“Despite more efforts and injuries as well, he finally resisted the second thunder!”

“Genius!”

Those bystanders were all impressed by Jian Wushuang.

And now, at the center of the vast thundercloud, the third Sacred Thunder was forming…

Boom!

The third Sacred Thunder was shot out with a deafening bang that was able to shake the universe.

The same color, but the size was ten times larger than the last one!

The annihilatory power, ten times larger!

Seeing that the third Sacred Thunder had come, Jian Wushuang got alert.

“The first Sacred Thunder caused no trouble for me, but the second one almost reach the highest threshold level that I can bear. And the third one may kill me if I still use nothing for defense.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists. In an instant, the Blood-killing Plate Armor that he had thrown aside was reshaped into a scarlet flowing light, flowing around him and then turning into the scarlet armor again. Automatically, the armor covered the whole body of Jian Wushuang, including his head.

Boom!

Then the third Sacred Thunder struck onto Jian Wushuang heavily.

The annihilatory power it produced was far more destructive than the previous ones.

But thanks to Jian Wushuang’s Blood-killing Plate Armor, the power of the Sacred Thunder was weakened sharply to one tenth.

The remaining power didn’t cause much damage to Jian Wushuang.

“Carry on!”

With tightly clenched hands, Jian Wushuang stood there looking up to the endless heaven. He roared with a firm determination, and his voice reverberated through the whole universe.

Those watching Jian Wushuang all became speechless.

They had witness him get through three Sacred Thunders already!

Formidable power!

Formidable Jian Wushuang!
