Chapter 352: Jian Wushuang, the Supreme Existence!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Above the Void near the Skyward Mountain, Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, while feeling the booming power within him.

Now, he had reached Venerable Master and had the strongest body.

His body became extremely tough. His bones, organs, muscles, and even skin were stronger than an ordinary warrior’s. It was known as iron bones, and his current body was not weaker than a third-grade magic weapon!

Jian Wushuang had such a marvelous body, which was the big difference between a Divine Transcendence expert and him.

Second Holy Master’s strongest move, Scarlet Thunderbolt, just slightly injured him, because his body was too strong.

His strong body led to his great strength.

With just his body, Jian Wushuang was able to fight against an ordinary expert of the Saint Realm. With the help of Heavenly Creation Skill, his strength exploded, becoming a dozen times stronger than an expert of the Saint Realm.

Besides that, he also made a breakthrough in Cultivation and Sword Soul!

“Double Sword Souls!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang did not know that he could possess two Sword Souls.

The Double Sword Souls both created a Sword Soul Phantom.

The Sword Soul had been in his sea of consciousness, helping him with both enlightenment of Essence and Origin of Sword Principle. However, when the Sword Soul Phantoms appeared, Jian Wushuang found each movement he displayed was reinforced by the strength of Sword Soul, so its power improved greatly.

Now, even his casual stroke was extremely terrifying.

Jian Wushuang cut off Second Holy Master’s legs with one stroke, because of the strength of Sword Soul. If Second Holy Master had not escaped, Jian Wushuang could have killed him after the breakthrough.

“Venerable Master and Double Sword Souls, I’m currently much stronger than before.”

“It’s all because of the gray stone bead!”

Jian Wushuang touched his lower abdomen and felt like the gray stone bead had seemingly disappeared again.

But he knew that it was only hidden in his body and he just could not sense it.

He also knew that without the gray stone bead, he would have died.

“The gray stone bead saved me once, but it might not be able to help me a second time!”

“The way of cultivating is fraught with peril. From now on, I should be more careful. I won’t let such a situation happen again.”

Jian Wushuang was roaring in his heart.

He really had almost died in that fight.

Though he had been on the edge of the precipice several times, he always survived by using some unorthodox tactics.

But this time, he had survived by luck.

“Swordsman, my little friend.” A gentle voice was heard as Wine Master slowly walked over.

“Senior Wine Master,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Congratulation on your breakthrough!” Wine Master smiled and said, “Second Holy Master is one of the supreme experts in Nanyang Continent, but you cut off his legs with one stroke. Besides the mysterious Monarch of the Tang Dynasty, you might be the only one who could do that.”

Wine Master changed his attitude towards Jian Wushuang.

He now called Jian Wushuang “little friend” instead of “boy”.

If he fought with Second Holy Master, Wine Master would run away, but Jian Wushuang easily cut off Second Holy Master’s legs. After that, Wine Master knew that the young man’s strength was far superior to his.

Therefore, he could not call the young man “boy” anymore.

“I was just lucky,” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile.

He was not proud of himself, as he was clear that luck had helped him out.

“Luck is a part of your strength.” Wine Master smiled and said, “From now on, you are the strongest expert in Nanyang Continent. Even if you fought First Holy Master from Holy Emperor Palace, you would defeat him. That is to say, Holy Emperor Palace is no longer a threat to you.”

“Holy Emperor Palace!”

A hint of coldness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. “Holy Emperor Palace has tried to kill me. I have a grudge against them. That is irreconcilable.

“Now that my strength improved greatly, I need to destroy this enemy. But first, I have to go somewhere.”

“Senior Wine Master,” Jian Wushuang looked toward Wine Master and said, “I have to go somewhere. Please tell my brothers after they wake up.”

“Okay.” The Wine Master nodded.

“See you.” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands and left. He changed into a lightning and disappeared into the sky.

The Wine Master sighed in private while watching his back.

“I remember the first time I met him. He was at the Primordial Gold Core level. Yet it only took him this long to completely surpass my strength?

“Too fast!

“In the vast Nanyang Continent, there have been countless, marvelous geniuses and experts, but none of them can hold a candle to him.

“He will become a legend in the Nanyang Continent!”

The other experts who witnessed the fight were petrified.

“He cut off Second Holy Master’s legs with one stroke?”

“Second Holy Master ran away without even hesitating?”

“He’s reached Divine Transcendence!”

“He was so powerful after his breakthrough. I’m afraid that, except for the mysterious Monarch of the Tang Dynasty, no one will be his match.”

“From now on, he has become a supreme existence!”

“Jian Wushuang, with a sword in hand, he is invincible!”

Their eyes sparkled.

They witnessed a star rise in the Nanyang Continent.

Jian Wushuang would be a legend in the Nanyang Continent!
