Chapter 1388: Huo Yi’s Request

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Bei Xiu’s pupil contracted when Jian Wushuang rejected him once again.

After a short silence, Bei Xiu spoke again, “Wushuang, if I’m not mistaken, your consciousness attack technique originated extraordinarily, right?”

“As I’ve said, the consciousness attack technique was passed down by my master. I wonder what you mean when you say that?” Jian Wushuang lowered his voice.

“Shouldn’t this technique be from out of Tian Ling land?” Bei Xiu fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang.

“Outside of Tian Ling land?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised, “There’s another land or world outside of this Tian Ling land?”

Bei Xiu creased his eyebrows when he saw Jian Wushuang’s expression.

“This boy really doesn’t know, or is he pretending?” Bei Xiu wasn’t sure himself.

“Bei Xiu, it’s impossible for me to teach you the consciousness attack technique. If there’s nothing else, I shall leave,” Jian Wushuang didn’t bother with Bei Xiu’s response but walked outside the palace.

Watching Jian Wushuang left the palace, Bei Xiu’s face grew grave.

“He rejected him even when I traded with my Feng Ling Knack and bronze mirror?”

“Humph, so what if you rejected me? You think you don’t trade and I wouldn’t be able to get the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack from you? That’s funny!”

“Just you wait. In no time, the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack will be in my hand!”

Bei Xiu held his fists tight as coldness spread in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang who had just left the palace looked extremely solemn too.

“Bei Xiu recognized the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack and knows that the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack is from out of Tian Ling land?” Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted. He never expected that.

Tian Ling land was merely a mystery land that Lineage of Star controlled. Theoretically, the experts in Tian Yuan Mystery Land and the Eternal Chaotic World shouldn’t be in contact.

Those impressive techniques or secret skills in Eternal Chaotic World… the experts in Tian Ling land shouldn’t be able to recognize them.

But in the end, Bei Xiu came to a realization.

“Luckily, he only noticed that my Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack came from Tian Ling land but couldn’t tell that I’m a cultivator from out of Tian Ling land!”

“Plus, I am a Peak three-starred Soul Master of Soul Master Hall and I’m on Soul Island. Even if Bei Xiu has a powerful background, he couldn’t deal with me publicly. In other words, I am still in a safe situation as of now!”

“Even so, I have to be extremely careful,”

Jian Wushuang was already extremely careful.

Then, Jian Wushuang continued to stay on Soul Island.

He cultivated on Soul Island and he often headed over to the battleground to fight with other Soul Masters to learn from them.

His Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack was merely beginner level. He had masses of room for improvement.

Time flowed past like water. In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang stayed on Soul Island for two hundred and sixty years.

In the two hundred and sixty years, he spent all his time and effort on familiarizing himself with the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

In those years, he fought countless times with a large number of Soul Masters. Along with the fights, he mastered the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack even better. Until then, he was at the great achievement stage of Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat down as his eyes twinkled with brightness.

“Great achievement stage of Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. My Soul Attack became fiercer, scarier. My overall power improved tremendously too.”

“It’s a pity that after so many years of cultivation, my Soul Power has yet to break through the bottleneck.”

Jian Wushuang felt regretful.

His Soul Power had already reached the limit of an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven back when he was in Lineage of Star. He had nearly levelled up to Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven.

But it was a pity that the last step took him so long.

If his Soul Power were to have a breakthrough again, his Soul Attack would improve tremendously.

“Jian Wushuang!”

The voice was from outside the secret room. Jian Wushuang was surprised but immediately appeared outside the secret room.

“Feng Tao, Huo Yi, why did the two of you come?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two of them outside the secret room.

Although Jian Wushuang often fought with others to learn from them during his stay on Soul Island, he never had any friends. The closest ones were Feng Tao and Huo Yi.

“We were looking for you,” Feng Tao.

“What’s happened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Huo Yi, you say it,” Feng Tao look at Huo Yi.

“Well,” Huo Yi started explaining, “I am having trouble in cultivation and I’ll require a few Desolate Crystal for assistance. But Desolate Crystals… They are too precious. Although there are many Soul Masters who have Desolate Crystals, their asking price is too high. I can’t afford it so I can only go to the deserted region to hunt those beasts.”

“Desolate Crystals?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Jian Wushuang had stayed on Soul Island for such a long period but he knew since long ago that the Desolated Crystal was Tian Ling Crystal. It was merely a different name.

Before he came to Tian Ling Mystery Land, Hall Master Yuan assigned him a task, which was for him to collect ten Tian Ling Crystals.

“You came to look for me because you want me to go to the deserted region with you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes,” Huo Yi nodded, “The deserted region is the most dangerous place in Tian Ling land. There are countless beasts in the region and they are all very strong. If I were to go to the deserted region alone to hunt the beast, it would be rather unrealistic. So, I am asking you and Feng Tao, hoping both of you will go with me. Then, I would be more secure.”

“Of course, I only want two pieces of desolated crystals that we get from hunting the beast. You can take the rest of them. If you are willing to help me, I, Huo Yi won’t turn you down if you need any help in the future. Even if you wanted me to go through a mountain of swords and a sea of flames!”

Jian Wushuang exchanged a glance with Feng Tao and they smiled.

“I’m just going to the deserted region with you. You don’t have to go through a mountain of swords and a sea of flames,” Feng Tao smiled.

“Huo Yi, when would you like to go?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The sooner the better,” Huo Yi said.

“Now, then,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Huo Yi and Feng Tao were the closest friends he had in Soul Island. Jian Wushuang naturally wouldn’t refuse keeping Huo Yi company and making a trip to the deserted region.

On top of that, even if Huo Yi wasn’t going, he would definitely need to head to the deserted region himself at some point. His task required him to go there after all. He had been practicing the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack and he didn’t care about the task. However, when he was going to leave Tian Ling Mystery Land in the future, he was going to have to head to the deserted region to get the ten Tian Ling crystals. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“If so, let’s go now,” Huo Yi said.

Jian Wushuang, Feng Tao and Huo Yi immediately left Soul Island and departed towards the deserted region.

But just as Jian Wushuang took one step to leave, Mister Bei Xiu was immediately notified.
