Chapter 945: Overturning the Situation!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The ripples that carried the sound wave attack and consciousness attack covered the entire battlefield, passing through it at an alarming rate.

Obviously, the ripples didn’t affect the Dao Masters in Emperor Xiao’s camp.

Meanwhile, the ripples stopped the hundreds of Dao Masters of the Immortal Army who had rushed to the forefront of the battlefield. Their bodies shook violently and many bled from their mouths, noses, eyes, and ears.

The ripples then swept over Emperor Leng’s Holy Guards and other experts of the Xia Clan. Most of them groaned in pain and several even had blood flowing out of their seven orifices.

The ripples continued to sweep through the entire battlefield but soon vanished into thin air.

The battlefield, even the entire world, was shrouded in sheer silence.

The next moment, in the most central part of the battlefield, over at Emperor Leng and the Xia Clan’s side… “Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Many bodies fell to the ground like raindrops.

Soon, nearly one hundred bodies lined the ground!

Most bodies belonged to the members of the Immortal Army. Only three Dao Masters of the camp, which originally boasted of exactly one hundred Dao Masters, were left after the attack. Aside from those who died in the hands of the experts aligned to Emperor Xiao earlier, the rest were killed by the ripples and fell to the ground. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The ripples had slaughtered nearly one hundred Dao Masters!

“Impossible!”

The roar shook the entire world. The experts of the Xia Clan, especially Xia Tao and Xia Ming, were both horrified and furious.

Their emotions were also running wild.

Their clan had spent so much time, energy, and money building their Immortal Army!

Now, nearly one hundred of their Dao Masters had been killed just like that!

The remaining three of the army were also physically and mentally hurt and had almost lost their fighting power.

The entire Immortal Army had been wiped out in such a short time!

“This is…”

The Dao Masters in Emperor Xiao’s camp were also stunned and turned to look at the source of the ripples.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Emperor Xiao recognized the person standing atop Gu King’s head at a glance, even though Jian Wushuang’s body had expanded and his skin had turned dark golden.

“It’s Jian Wushuang! That little bastard had united with the Exotic Beast!” The Xia clansmen glared at Jian Wushuang in anger.

“That little bastard is still alive?” Xia Tao roared.

He had lost his son, Xia Mang, in this war. It was Gu Tong who trampled and killed Xia Mang.

Now the Immortal Army, which their clan had built at great costs, was also destroyed.

Such a huge loss… His loss was too great for him to bear.

“That bastard is responsible for everything that happened today. If not for him, Mang’er would’ve lived to marry Leng Rushuang. The marriage alliance between our clan and Emperor Leng would’ve also been successful. Everything was supposed to go as planned but that little bastard ruined everything!”?Xia Tao glowered at Jian Wushuang with enmity and anger.

“Little bastard, I’ll kill you!”

With his fierce scream, a horrible Killing Intent burst out of Xia Tao’s body. He was like a raging lion as he threw himself in Jian Wushuang’s direction. His surging Killing Intent soon enveloped Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang, who stood atop Gu King’s head, was shocked when he saw the situation of the battlefield.

“Gu… Gu King, did you cause all this with your roar?” he asked in shock.

“Of course,” Gu King answered. “However, your consciousness attack also played a part. But it’s also because the Dao Masters of the Immortal Army aren’t real Dao Masters.”

“Not real Dao Masters?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Those Dao Masters must have become Dao Master by using a vicious Secret Skill at a great price. But their type is even weaker than those who rely on Bodhidan pills. They’re actually at the level of Eternal Realm in nature.” Gu King sneered. “The Secret Skill I used is an ordinary skill but it’s a Sound Wave Attack and covers a wide range. More importantly, it’s combined with your consciousness attack!”

“Your consciousness attack targeted them first, which few of them could resist. Then, my sound waves shattered their life cores after they lose their ability to react. It’s that simple.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang said.

It was no wonder only the Immortal Army had been destroyed but Emperor Leng’s Holy Guards and several of the real Dao Masters of the Xia Clan survived.

Emperor Xiao’s camp had been nearly defeated but with the annihilation of the Immortal Army, the situation was instantly reversed—and it was all thanks to Jian Wushuang!

The experts in Emperor Xiao’s camp rejoiced.

“With the Immortal Army destroyed, the next step is to deal with the remaining Dao Masters of the Xia Clan,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Just then, he happened to see Xia Tao coming toward him with heinous Killing Intent.

“Xia Tao, Master of the Xia Clan, is a Dao Master at Rank Three and close to the top of Rank Three!”

Jian Wushuang carried the Blood Mountain Sword in hand, which carried a power much stronger than before. Next to him, the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation formed by 12 One-meter Swords had already materialized.

Jian Wushuang’s battle intent soared.

“Get ready,” King Gu said.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Chuu!”

Gu King’s body, which was hundreds of meters long, sprang toward the enemy at lightning speed all while emanating a horrible aura. Then, Jian Wushuang jumped out.

“Bang!”

Gu King stopped in front of Xia Tao and then turned his giant body, shooting his tentacles at Xia Tao like they were thousands of vicious snakes.

“Get off me!” Xia Tao shouted.

He swiped Gu King with his Giant Axe.

Gu King’s tentacles were cut in half.

However, Gu King opened his mouth and scarlet gas spurt out.
