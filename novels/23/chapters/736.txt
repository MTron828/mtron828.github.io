“Elder Ying and other brothers, sorry to keep you waiting.” Jian Wushuang apologized to them.

Those who were waiting for him all stared at him with a strange look, especially Elder Ying.

Her eyes flickered when she observed Jian Wushuang.?“His bloodline carries a strong oppressive force, a force much stronger than those of the other Gold-armored Ancient Gods.”?

The others looked a bit terrified while staring at Jian Wushuang.

Once the people of the Ancient God Clan awoke their bloodline, it would emit an oppressive force from them, and the force of a Gold-armored Ancient God would be much stronger than that of a Silver-armored Ancient God.

Therefore, even if the latter was stronger than the former, he would still be in awe of him, because his bloodline was of lower level.

Those clansmen had been waiting for Jian Wushuang for so long that the first time he awoke his bloodline, they immediately felt it and were shocked.

The oppressive force they felt from him was fiercer than what they felt from other Gold-armored Ancient Gods.

“It has been rather long since a bloodline of such high level as yours has awoken,” Elder Ying said to Jian Wushuang with her eyes sparkling.

After a long silence, she let out a sigh of relief and turned to her clansmen, “The baptism is ended and all of you can go back now.”

“Yes, Elder Ying.” The clansmen all headed back after shooting Jian Wushuang a glance.

Soon, there was only Jian Wushuang with Elder Ying.

“Jian Wushuang, I want to show you something, follow me.” She finally spoke again.

“Yes, Elder Ying.” Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang followed her. They left the valley and then the clan.

Eternal Zone was a vast land, the Ancient God Clan and the wild beasts each controlled half of it.

Where the two territories met was the Holy Place of the Ancient God Clan, and the place had been closed since the clan lost the ancestor’s trace.

During those long years, no one had gotten in or out of the place.

Elder Ying led Jian Wushuang to a giant mountain near the Holy Place, and there was a wide path leading to its peak.

Walking along the path, Jian Wushuang quickly reached the peak.

“What’s this?”

He was immediately attracted by a scene in front of him.

It was a group of ancient and huge palaces.

Between him and the palaces was a giant stone, on which three words were engraved: Ancient God Palace.

“Ancient God Palace?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had been in the Eternal Zone for more than 80 years, and yet he had never heard of the palace before.

“Elder Ying, what are those palaces?”

“Ancient God Palace is the core place of our clan and also a place where our top experts are gathered.”

Elder Ying started explaining. “This palace contains the most important and ancient three Secret Skills of our clan. Those skills are our foundation.

“There are over a million people in our ten tribes, and only the top ones or the Gold-armored Ancient Gods can enter this palace to study the three skills.”

“The three secret skills?”?Jian Wushuang was excited.

Back when he was studying the Star-river Secret Skill, Gu Changfeng had told him that there were two other Secret Skills in their clan apart from the one he was working on.

At that time, he had only been able to learn the first 11 levels of the Star-river Secret Skill and was not up to the rest of the levels and the other two Secret Skills.

Gu Changfeng had also told him that only Gold-armored Ancient Gods could practice those skills.

However, now, from Elder Ying’s words, he finally knew that not only Gold-armored Ancient Gods but also top experts could practice them.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Elder Ying looked towards him and spoke again, “You have awoken a strong bloodline and even have dark-golden skin on your chest. That’s why I brought you here.

“Let me show you in.”

“Thanks, Elder Ying.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He could not wait to see the other levels of the Star-river Secret Skill and the other two Secret Skills with his own eyes.

Following Elder Ying, he entered the palace and in the hallway, he saw some people with terrifying power.

The first person he caught sight of was a bald man. The man saw him as well and grinned at him, which, however, made his hair stand on end. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He could tell that the man was powerful enough to kill him with one strike.

Besides the man, the others he saw along the way all made him feel fear.

“Those people are as powerful as Two-star Ancient Gods, and their battle strength have to be amazingly strong,”?he thought.

In fact, he had met many Eternal Realm experts in the Firmament Territory before, and those experts in the three magnates and the top sects numbered a hundred.

Nevertheless, except for his master Xuan Yi, none of them terrified him as much as these men he saw here.

He even suspected that each expert in that palace could kill a group of Eternal Realm experts outside by themselves.

“Is this the main power of the Ancient God Clan?”?Jian Wushuang was stunned inside.

Though he had seen some Two-star Ancient Gods in the 10 tribes earlier, he had not been able to set eyes on the really powerful ones until this moment, for these experts remained in the palace all the time.
