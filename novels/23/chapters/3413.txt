Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Okay.” Master Ancient Wheel nodded slightly. “There’s no need for too much pressure. Just use all your strength. It’s best if you can defeat Leaf Master. Even if you lose, it’s not a big deal. Anyway, in this battle, the

blood ancestor lineage can at least tie with serene ancestor.”

“I understand.” Stabbing Heart Master understood and was about to go forward, but Jian Wushuang waved his hand and stopped him.

“Stabbing Heart Master, I won’t bother you to fight in the third battle.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Stabbing Heart Master was stunned.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis?” Master Ancient Wheel also looked over in confusion.

“I want the blood ancestor’s bloodline to win this battle. It’s not as simple as a draw.” Jian Wushuang smiled and then glanced at Demon Master Chenhuo. “Chenhuo, you go.”

Demon Master Chenhuo raised his eyebrows and appeared in the hundred battle arena.

His appearance immediately attracted many curious gazes. Although there were many experts present, no one could recognize Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Who are you?” Leaf Master also looked at Demon Master Chenhuo with a frown.

“Ancient Wheel, who is this person? Is he an expert under the blood ancestor’s bloodline?” Xuan Master asked directly.

“He is my personal guard. He has nothing to do with the Temporal Temple. He is a member of the blood ancestor’s bloodline since he follows me. It shouldn’t be a problem for me to send him to fight,” Jian Wushuang

said with a smile.

“Guard?” Xuan Master narrowed his eyes.

If he was really Jian Wushuang’s guard and had nothing to do with other sects, then he could be considered a member of the blood ancestor’s bloodline.

“Humph, although I don’t know who he is, it’s impossible for the blood ancestor’s faction to defeat Leaf Master with him.” Xuan Master snorted, he said in a low voice, “Leaf, don’t hold back. Try to be as clean as

possible.”

“I know.” Leaf Master nodded slightly. As soon as he finished his words, a surging aura swept out from his body.

This aura was incomparably powerful. In an instant, it had completely exceeded the limits of a void fourth level expert, directly reaching the level of the void fifth level!

“Void fifth level!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“This, this is the aura pressure that only void fifth level experts have!”

“Even though Leaf Master has long reached the pinnacle of the void fourth level and rarely has an opponent among the void fourth level, it is impossible for him to display this level of aura. unless…he broke through!”

“Heavens, Leaf Master has actually broken through to the fifth level of the void!”

Outside the hundred battle platform, the many experts watching the battle were all greatly shocked.

The fourth level of the void and the fifth level of the void were only one step apart, but during this period of time, an entire portion of the power of will had appeared.

“This Leaf Master has actually broken through?” Master Stabbing Heart’s eyes were wide open, and his face was filled with shock.

He knew very well that if Leaf Master was only at the pinnacle of the void four realms, he might have a chance to fight with his strength. But now that Leaf Master had made a breakthrough…he had no chance to fight

back.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis, this…” Master Ancient Wheel looked at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s not a big deal. Don’t worry about it.” Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly.

Since Jian Wushuang had said so, Master Ancient Wheel naturally had nothing to say.

In the hundred battle platform, the majestic divine power aura of Leaf Master had completely suppressed Demon Master Chenhuo. However, in the face of this divine power aura’s suppression, he still appeared as calm

as a breeze, it was as if he was not affected in the slightest.

And the truth was as such. A mere void fifth level aura pressure was nothing to him. It was only because his method of concealing his aura was too brilliant that the people around him did not know his actual strength,

if people knew that he was a peak void sixth level expert, then they would not be surprised by his current expression.

“Master Ancient Wheel has instructed me to be more efficient. Hence, I’m sorry.” After Leaf Master spoke, large amounts of dark clouds rose up from his body, his body also completely turned into darkness.

Weng!

The huge dark clouds covered the sky and earth, directly extending toward Demon Master Chenhuo. The dark clouds contained an astonishing might. No matter who it was, as long as they were covered by the dark

clouds…they would all face the storm of attacks from Leaf Master.

However, just as the dark cloud appeared in front of Demon Master Chenhuo and was about to cover him, Demon Master Chenhuo slowly raised his hand.

He simply raised his hand and casually slapped the dark cloud, as if he was swatting a fly.

Pa!

The dark cloud directly shattered, revealing Leaf Master’s figure. At this moment, Leaf Master’s expression changed drastically. His divine body was being suppressed by a terrifying power. He did not have the ability to

resist…he fell to the ground.

In just a moment, his body was slammed onto the ground of the hundred battle platform, and a huge hole appeared on the ground.

Silence!

The entire hundred battle platform, both inside and outside, was extremely quiet.

Except for Jian Wushuang, everyone looked at the scene in front of them in a daze.

Leaf Master had already reached the peak of the four void realms. His battle strength was so strong that he could even fight with an expert of the five void realms. Now that he had broken through to the five void

realms, his battle strength was even more amazing, to a certain extent, he had already surpassed Xuan Master!

That was right. In terms of strength, the current Leaf Master was actually slightly stronger than Xuan Master. It was precisely because of this that the nether ancestor lineage had arranged for him to be in the final

battle just to be safe.

However, it was precisely because of this formidable strength that Leaf Master fought with this person who appeared out of nowhere and acted as a guard by the side of Heavenly Sword Marquis. In the end, everyone

was unable to react in time, Leaf Master had already been defeated.

A crushing defeat!

He was utterly defeated. There was no room for struggle.

The difference in strength between the two sides was too great!

“Void, void six realms!” Master Ancient Wheel was the first to exclaim.

As his voice rang out, the entire hundred battle platform was instantly in an uproar.

“Void six realms. The person sent by the blood ancestor’s lineage is a peak expert of the void six realms!”

“Yes, it’s the sixth level of the void. Only existences at the sixth level of the void can defeat the Leaf Master with a single move!”

“The sixth level of the void. This is the same level as the blood ancestor and the serene ancestor. But in the end, his identity is only that of the Heavenly Sword Marquis’ guard?”

“The sixth level of the void can be a guard?”

Everyone felt their minds go blank..
