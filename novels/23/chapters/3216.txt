Chapter 3217: Disappeared Without a Trace

——

“My divine power has been reduced by 70%!”

After the silver-haired old man’s divine body was reassembled, he was terrified.

Fortunately, Di Hao only attacked him once and was immediately entangled by the Thunder God and Wan Xuan. Otherwise, Di Hao would have killed him with just one more blow.

“I only have 30% of my divine power left. My divine body can only be reassembled once more. If I meet Di Hao or other Invincible Saints attacking me again, I will definitely die. I can not interfere in this battle anymore. I will retreat to the outside of the battlefield first.” The silver-haired old man had already made up his mind.

However, just as he was about to move, a figure appeared behind the silver-haired old man without any warning.

“This is…” The silver-haired old man’s pupils constricted. He had already sensed it.

But sensing it did not mean that he would be able to react in time.

A soundless sword light instantly pierced through the void, then directly pierced through the silver-haired old man’s divine body.

“I, I…” The silver-haired old man’s eyes were wide open, and there was still shock and disbelief in his eyes.

However, the remaining thirty percent of his divine power had already been completely corroded by the ‘cold blood’ poison.

Even before he died, the silver-haired old man still could not figure out why the Temporal Temple wanted to kill him first when there were fourteen cultivators from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusory Moon Sky Sect present. Moreover, it was very obvious that they had planned it, they had made him their first target to kill.

Why?

With doubts in his heart, the silver-haired old man finally died.

“Junior Brother Mo Xin!”

“Mo Xin!”

The people of the Destruction Saint Realm were shocked to see this scene.

At the same time, they also saw the figure that appeared in the void where the silver-haired old man was. It was Jian Wushuang.

“It’s Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“When did he go there?”

The people from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusory Moon Sect were stunned. At the same time, they all looked at Su Xie. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

But at this moment, Su Xie was also puzzled.

“What did this kid do?” Su Xie frowned.

She was indeed fighting with Jian Wushuang just now, and she had completely crushed Jian Wushuang and destroyed his divine body. But when Di Hao used that shocking ax and everyone was attracted by it, Jian Wushuang disappeared right in front of her eyes.

Yes, he disappeared right in front of her eyes. When Su Xie realized what had happened, she did not know where Jian Wushuang had gone.

It was not until Jian Wushuang flashed and killed Mo Xin that she knew his real location.

“Now that Mo Xin is dead, the next thing will be easier.”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void where the silver-haired Elder Mo Xin was and looked around the battlefield, but a cold smile appeared on his face.

“Destruction Saint Realm, Illusion Moon Sect, didn’t you want to kill me? Now I want to see who will kill who.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, it reverberated between heaven and earth. As soon as his voice fell, the endless power of ice and fire suddenly swept up and spread in all directions at a terrifying speed.

In the blink of an eye, the entire battlefield was covered by this power of ice and fire, then, the people from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusory Moon Sky sect who were in the domain of ice and fire instantly sensed a majestic pressure from the domain of ice and fire.

This pressure was like a huge mountain weighing hundreds of millions of kilograms that was pressing down on them. Everyone felt heavy.

“This is…a domain?”

“What a terrifying domain. I, an Invincible Saint, feel a huge pressure in this domain. My strength has been reduced by at least 20%!”

“A supreme treasure, this is definitely a domain-type supreme treasure!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis has a domain-type supreme treasure?”

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang with shock and greed.

True treasures were extremely precious. Even rule masters valued them and would fight for them.

If a domain-type true treasure was added to the list, it was enough to drive Principles Masters crazy!

They obviously did not expect Jian Wushuang to have such a treasure.

Even Di Hao and Qian Hongzi of the spacetime temple did not expect this.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, he has a domain-type supreme treasure. It was useless when he fought with me.” Duan Lang had a complicated look on his face.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang, who was in the center of the ice and fire domain, had become the focus of the battlefield.

Under everyone’s gaze, he slowly disappeared.

“It’s the same move again!” Su Xie’s pupils constricted.

The experts from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusionary Moon Sect immediately spread their soul power, trying to find Jian Wushuang’s location.

But in the end…

“He can’t be found?”

“No, he doesn’t exist in my soul perception!”

“Where did Heavenly Sword Marquis go?”

The experts from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusionary Moon Sect were puzzled.

Suddenly…chi!

A cold sword light pierced into the divine body of a woman in green. Her divine body collapsed at once, and 40% of it was consumed by the cold blood poison, then her divine body reassembled again.

“Be careful. Heavenly Sword Marquis is hiding around us and trying to assassinate us. His sneak attack is very terrifying. I just barely sensed his presence, but I didn’t have time to attack,” the woman in green shouted.

The woman in green was from the Illusory Moon Sect and was a very powerful Peak Saint. However, she was silently defeated by Jian Wushuang.

Everyone from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusory Moon Sect was shocked by this scene.

“Ah!”

A scream suddenly sounded. This time, it was a Peak Saint from the Destruction Saint Realm. His divine body was also pierced by Jian Wushuang’s sword. Although he did not die on the spot, his divine power was instantly consumed by more than 50%.

Chi! Chi!

Two more sounds sounded. This time, it was from the Destruction Saint Realm. The divine bodies of two Peak Saints had been destroyed once.

This strange assassination technique caused the people from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusory Moon Sect to panic.

“Damn it, where is he hiding!?”

“Strange, his concealment technique is too strange. It’s so strange that even our soul senses can’t sense it!”

“Now I finally know why the Temporal Temple decided to kill Junior Brother Mo Xin at all costs. Junior Brother Mo Xin is the only one among us who specializes in the soul. His soul senses are much stronger than all of us. With him around, we can definitely sense the position of the Heavenly Sword Marquis. But now that Junior Brother Mo Xin is dead…the rest of us can’t find the Heavenly Sword Marquis at all. He is hiding around us and ambushing us time and time again. We can’t do anything to him!”
