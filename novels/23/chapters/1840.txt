Chapter 1841: Abysmal Saint Master

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“A Great Emperor using Soul Burn?” Jian Wushuang’s body shook as well.

With just a mere Fortress Master Hong Tian using Soul Burn, the fighting capabilities that he had unleashed were already so frightening. If a Great Emperor were to unleash this move…

Jian Wushuang was totally unable to imagine how fearsome it would be.

“However, Great Emperor experts stood at the top and in the Eternal Chaotic World, wouldn’t there be no threats that could force them to that extent?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Under normal circumstances, it would indeed be impossible. However, in the history of the Eternal Chaotic World, there was a Great Emperor who was forced to the point that he unleashed this move. As a result of that, this Great Emperor fell. As for who forced him to this extent, it was Emperor Bai,” Emperor God Liu Guang said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He knew that Emperor Bai, who was recognized as the strongest person in the Eternal Chaotic World, had once killed a Great Emperor. In a situation where he had given up all hope, that Great Emperor would definitely counterattack by using Soul Burn. However, looking at it, even though he had used Soul Burn, he was still unable to do anything to Emperor Bai in the end. Instead, he had died in Emperor Bai’s hands.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Liu Guang was having a discussion. All of a sudden…

Buzz!

A powerful aura burst forth abruptly.

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin looked in the direction of the source of the aura immediately.

At a void by the side, a white-robed man had just rushed over and he crushed a token right away. The powerful aura had come from the token.

After that, Jian Wushuang and the two of them noticed that a dim black shadow was taking shape slowly in the void..

After the black shadow took its form, the whole universe fell into complete darkness and it was so dark that it looked as if the sun could not be seen forever.

“This aura… in the whole Eternal Chaotic World, there is only one person who has this aura.”

Jian Wushuang and the two of them looked at one another and their eyes filled with fear.

After that, the three of them greeted the black shadow together.

“Greetings to Abysmal Saint Master!”

The Abysmal Saint Master was the Great Emperor who ruled the Abysmal Sanctuary.

At that moment, the consciousness body of the Abysmal Saint Master had descended.

“Jian Wushuang.”

A hoarse voice spread across the area slowly. All of a sudden, a pair of sharp eyes from the black shadow pierced the void and looked at Jian Wushuang fiercely.

When he was stared at by that pair of eyes, Jian Wushuang’s body could not help but shake.

“Oh, Liu Guang is here as well?” the Abysmal Saint Master glanced at Emperor God Liu Guang.

Emperor God Liu Guang bowed down immediately to show her respect.

As for Emperor God Jiu Yin, Abysmal Saint Master was too lazy to even look at him.

“Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Liu Guang, all of you have fought your way into the Abysmal Sanctuary without even coming to greet me. Aren’t you disrespecting me?” the Abysmal Saint Master’s voice was ice-cold and it was impossible to tell whether he was delighted or furious.

The hearts of Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Liu Guang felt chilly.

There was no choice. After all, they were facing a Great Emperor and it was not a normal Great Emperor.

On the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, there was a total of fifteen Great Emperors and Abysmal Saint Master was ranked third!

He was only inferior to the Red Dragon King and the supreme Emperor Bai.

“Abysmal Saint Master, in front of many experts of the Sanctuary Alliance one year ago, I said that I would fight my way into the Deluge Fortress within ten years’ time. If I’m not wrong, Saint Master should have heard of this piece of news?” Jian Wushuang said.

“I have indeed heard of it. However, hearing of it is one matter and not greeting me is another matter,” Abysmal Saint Master’s voice turned heavy and the universe shivered in fear.

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth.

“Let’s cut the crap. I only came here to tell you that since the Almighties in the Deluge Fortress have a grudge against your Lineage of Star, you can go ahead and kill them and I will not stop you. However, Fortress Master Hong Tian has stayed in the Abysmal Sanctuary for many years and he can barely be considered one of my people. Hence, you are not allowed to kill him. Do you understand?” the Abysmal Saint Master said heavily.

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang frowned. After muttering for some time, he said: “Abysmal Saint Master, I’m sorry. You’re a bit too late. Fortress Master Hong Tian already died.”

“What did you say?” Abysmal Saint Master’s sharp eyes changed into two strands of lightning and swept over the area.

The lightning struck the void beside Jian Wushuang and cracked open the void completely. However, Jian Wushuang stood upright at his position.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian has already died,” Jian Wushuang said again.

“Abysmal Saint Master,” Emperor God Liu Guang spoke as well, “Indeed, Fortress Master Hong Tian has been killed.”

“How can it be so fast?” Abysmal Saint Master frowned.

The moment he got the news that Jian Wushuang had fought his way into the Deluge Fortress, he got people to bring his token and hurry to the Deluge Fortress immediately. Along the way, there was no delay at all and not much time had passed since then. Looking at it from his point of view, in such a short amount of time, it would be impossible for Jian Wushuang to kill Fortress Master Hong Tian. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After arriving at the battlefield, although he did not see Fortress Master Hong Tian right away, he thought that Fortress Master Hong Tian had escaped.

However, he did not expect Jian Wushuang to kill a Peak Emperor God like Fortress Master Hong Tian in such a short amount of time.

“Hmph, Jian Wushuang, Sword Emperor, you are really talented,” Abysmal Saint Master was ice-cold.

“Before I took action, I looked at the information of Fortress Master Hong Tian and I thought that Fortress Master Hong Tian was not really related to you, Abysmal Saint Master. As such, I took action. If I offended you, I hope that you will forgive me,” Jian Wushuang apologized.

“Haha, he has already been killed by you. What use is there for me to blame you?” the Abysmal Saint Master laughed coldly, “Forget it.”

“Jian Wushuang…”

The Abysmal Saint Master’s sharp eyes looked at Jian Wushuang again and there was some coldness deep inside his eyes, “For the matter this time around, considering the fact that you do not know of our relationship, I shall not blame you. However, I still have to warn you…”

“For whatever you do in the future, you had better stay low. In this period of time, you killed quite a number of Almighties and there are already many people in the Sanctuary Alliance who are dissatisfied with you. As you are a top genius, the Sanctuary Alliance is still able to bear with it. However, if you were to continue your massacre and overdo it, you might go over the limit of the Sanctuary Alliance. At that time, even if we have to suppress our grief, the Sanctuary Alliance will still send experts to kill a top expert like you.”

“You had better look out for yourself.”

After giving a cold snort, Abysmal Saint Master’s black shadow started to dissipate slowly.

“Farewell, Abysmal Saint Master.”

Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin bowed down and looked at the Abysmal Saint Master’s consciousness body as it started to dissipate slowly.

It was not until it dissipated completely that the three of them stood up.

“Haha, the Abysmal Saint Master can really hold his temper. Moreover, looking at it, he does not really like me,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Dislike you? That’s highly possible,” Emperor God Liu Guang nodded her head, “According to what I know, the Abysmal Saint Master has always been extremely envious.”
