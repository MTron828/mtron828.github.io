“Teacher!”

Jian Wushuang communicated with his mentor.

“Yes.” It did not take long for Xuan Yi to respond.

“Second Senior Brother has gone…” Jian Wushuang said with grief.

“I know it already.” Xuan Yi exhaled lightly and continued. “All fates are pre-destined. It was his inescapable destiny. I cannot help it, too.”

Jian Wushuang heaved a heavy and sorrowful breath as well.

“That should hardly be the only matter you reach out to me for, is it not?” Xuan Yi said.

“Indeed, Teacher.” Jian Wushuang answered. “There is a problem that I need your help with.”

“Problem? Continue.” Xuan Yi replied, his tone still cool and indifferent as ever.

Xuan Yi had four disciples, all of which had reached the level of Dao Masters; most notably Jian Wushuang who was now one of the strongest warriors of the Green Fire World. But never had he requested for favors from his disciples, rather, it was his students who had repeated reached to him for help.

“Well, the problem is…” Jian Wushuang then explained the problem and situation of the battlefield to his Teacher.

“Ah? Enduring Samsara Formation?” Xuan Yi’s brows twitched with interest. “I see that the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom has expended a great deal this time to have employed a magical formation of such magnitude and destruction. Enduring Samsara Formation is hardly a small problem.”

“Indeed it is, Teacher. That is why I have only you to request for help from.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“That will hardly be a problem. Enduring Samsara Formation itself is hardly invulnerable.” Xuan Yi remarked. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“So there are indeed ways to stop it?” Jian Wushuang asked, with relief and joy brimming in his heart.

Enduring Samsara Formation is, in essence, a formation comprised of two completely different energies of opposing nature being harness in an endless cycle. The formation can be easily destroyed by disrupting the cycle or completely reversing the cycle itself.” Xuan Yi explained as he smiled thinly. “I can think of six different ways to destroy it.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang blurted with astonishment.

“What is it, Jian Wushuang?” The Palace Masters standing around him noticed the clamor and looked in his way.

“M-my, my Teacher had just told me that there six ways to destroy Enduring Samsara Formation!” Jian Wushuang explained.

His words left them speechless and stunned.

Palace Master Yun’s eyes widened into the size of eggs as he took in the words with disbelief!

They had been enduring both despair and disappointment as their desperate search for ways to destroy the Enduring Samsara Formation but had yielded no results. Yet, unexpectedly, the Teacher of Jian Wushuang revealed that there were six methods of destroying it!

“There are indeed six different ways to destroy Enduring Samsara Formation. But with the current strength of the Green Fire World, I’m afraid there is only one way!” Xuan Yi communicated.

“What way?” Jian Wushuang asked again anxiously.

As long as the Formation could be destroyed, even one single way was all they need for now!

“Listen to me. Illustrate for me the profile of the swirling vortex of the Formation.” Xuan Yi instructed.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

With his magical powers, Jian Wushuang drew an image of the vortex as he stood in the hall, as instructed by Xuan Yi.

The magical formation might look ordinary to the eye like a harmless vortex of swirling black and white fumes. But in truth, the Formation had hidden within itself a lot of intricacies which made it a very powerful and complex sorcery.

So complicated was its conjuration that even Palace Master Yun could not find out its weakness for now.

With the image completed, Xuan Yi’s voice came to him again, “Remember these four points I show you.”

Xuan Yi pointed to Jian Wushuang four different points upon the Grand Formation.

“Remember this four points. These are the pillars that sustain the Grand Formation. At the centermost part between all four points, lies the fatal pressure point of the Formation. I will now pass on to you another set of skill, a sword formation that requires four persons.” Xuan Yi instructed with great detail.

“A sword formation?” Jian Wushuang gasped with wonder.

“The Enduring Samsara Formation becomes virtually invulnerable once it reaches full maturity. Even with the knowledge of its pressure point, you will also require a powerful force to fully threaten it. None of you in the Green Fire World possess of such strength. That is why you can only rely on a sword formation.” Xuan Yi elaborated on his instructions.

“Understood, teacher.” Jian Wushuang answered.

Xuan Yi then taught Jian Wushuang the skillset needed for the sword formation.

“Now that you have the knowledge to use the sword formation, you will have four people standing upon the four points I have instructed to you earlier and attack the pressure point in unison. This will allow you to destroy the Grand Formation.” Xuan Yi directed. “Remember, you have to reduce the duration needed to fuse all four of your powers. Tarry any longer, and the Grand Formation will grow stronger and stronger. Not even I will be able to help it if everything is too late.”

“Yes, sir! Thank you so much, Teacher!” Jian Wushuang cried gratefully.

“There is no need for thanks. This will be a very perilous and trying hour for you and your two Senior Brothers. Just be careful. That is enough for me.” Xuan Yi left him a smile as he terminated the connection of their communication.

“How was it, Jian Wushuang?” The Palace Masters standing around him all looked at him hopefully.

Jian Wushuang exhaled lightly and gazed around him. Loudly, he announced, “My Teacher has taught me the skillset for using a sword formation. With it, we shall be able to destroy the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara Formation!”

“A sword formation?” The Palace Masters around him could hardly believe their ears.

“Master Yun, you are the most gifted and the most learned in the skills of conjuring magical formations. This is the sword formation that my Teacher had just taught me to use. Would you please have a look and see if it will work.” Jian Wushuang recorded the teachings of his mentor into writing and showed it to Palace Master Yun.

Knowing that there might be doubt and skepticism from the many Palace Masters present despite his own complete faith in his Teacher, Jian Wushuang had divulged the method instructed to him by his Xuan Yi.

“I will first have a look.” Palace Master Yun said and he immediately began poring through the details.

The assembly of Palace Masters waited in silence, as did Jian Wushuang, as they hoped for the best.

After some time, Palace Master Yun finally came to a conclusion.

“Jian Wushuang.”

The elderly Palace Master turned to face Jian Wushuang. Suddenly, right before the staring eyes of the entire assembly, he bowed respectfully to Jian Wushuang.

“Master Yun, what are you doing?” Jian Wushuang uttered with shock. The entire crowd around them was instantly stunned.

Palace Master Yun rose to his feet and smiled. “The respects I paid were not for you, but your Teacher. It is he who has given us of the Green Fire World a glimmer of hope!”

“A glimmer of hope?” The news brought joyous anticipation of optimism to everyone around.

The words of Palace Master Yun had affirmed that Xuan Yi’s instruction would work in destroying the Grand Formation!

“Indeed? It will work?” The Samsara Temple Master asked with impatiently.

“Jian Wushuang’s Teacher is, without doubt, one of the greatest masters in the skills of using magical formations! Even the most complex Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara have been easily dissected and examined with such ease to him!”

“Even the sword formation that he had taught was exceedingly complicated. The Grand Formation would most likely be destroyed as long as we follow the instructions he had left for the sword formation.” Palace Master Yun announced.
