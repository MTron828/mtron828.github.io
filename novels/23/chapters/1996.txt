Chapter 1997: Sword Principle Xuan Luo

Any one of the twelve sword principles would be a first-rate sword principle in ancient times. It would be even more impressive in the current era.

Jian Wushuang looked through it carefully and chose three sword principles in the end.

The three sword principles were more suitable for him.

Among the three sword principles, Jian Wushuang was looking forward to getting Sword Principle Xuan Luo the most.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo was created by a sword expert in ancient times named Xuan Luo and he named the sword principle after himself.

There was a total of four moves in the sword principle, but it wasn’t the kind of unique skill whereby the second move would be stronger than the first. It contained four sword moves that covered different regions and different natures.

There was one move in the sword principle that focused on power, one focused on speed, one focus on defense, and one focused on the instant explosion of power and penetrating power.

Four of the moves were using a sword as a basis and comprehension of doctrine as auxiliary.

On top of that, regardless of the doctrine that one comprehended, he could still give full play to the four moves in the sword principle.

Any move from the four moves in sword principle would be nothing but the combination of four moves could be a perfectly flawless sword principle if played during a fierce fight.

Even the Sword Geek Jiu Jue left a message on the sword stele to express his admiration of that particular sword principle.

Back then, when Jiu Jue fought with the ancient expert, Xuan Luo, who had created the sword principle, he couldn’t find any flaw in his opponent’s sword principle. Hence, he couldn’t seize any opportunity. In the end, he had relied on his pure divine power to win against his opponent unconvincingly.

Among the ancient sword principles contained in the sword steles, Sword Principle Xuan Luo could be considered a high-grade one.

“Sword Principle doesn’t need to be brilliant and luxurious, nor does it need so many moves. As long as it is practical, it will do,” Jian Wushuang said.

“In terms of a master stroke, I already have an Emperor Sword Principle. It required time to accumulate power. It purely focused on the power of sword principle that was extremely fierce. During an actual fight, there will be hardly any chance for you to accumulate power, especially if it is a close combat fight. As for Sword Principle Xuan Luo, it includes both attack and defense in one. It is almost flawless. As I could perform it in an instant during close combat, it absolutely could make up the deficiency in my swordsmanship.”

Jian Wushuang preferred Sword Principle Xuan Luo over the other two sword principles.

Of course, he had only gotten two sword steles and Sword Principle Xuan Luo was still incomplete.

“These two sword steles contained more than half of Sword Principle Xuan Luo. The rest of it should be in another one sword stele,” Jian Wushuang muttered. But first, he had to find out whose hand the final sword stele that contained the rest of Sword Principle Xuan Luo was in.

Jian Wushuang immediately sent out messages to check.

With Jian Wushuang’s current power and position, it was too easy for him to find out things, especially things about the sword steles.

In no time, Jian Wushuang found his answer.

A few days later, on a spacious land on the ancient battlefield.

Jian Wushuang stood there in silence. In a short while, a poised lady in a purple robe plunged over from afar and stopped before Jian Wushuang.

“Han Ye greets Sword Emperor,” the poised lady in a purple robe bowed politely to Jian Wushuang to show respect.

“Emperor God Han Ye, there is no need to be so courteous,” Jian Wushuang smiled, “You should know why I looked for you, right?”

“Sword Emperor is interested in the sword stele in my hand?” Emperor God Han Ye lifted his head.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “To be exact, I am referring to only sword principle in your sword stele, Sword Principle Xuan Luo.”

“In the sword stele that I have, there is Sword Principle Xuan Luo. However…” Emperor God Han Ye hesitated. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I want your sword stele and I naturally wouldn’t just take it for free. What are your conditions, what resources and treasures do you want? Tell me,” Jian Wushuang asked.

He had once killed a hundred Almighties from Almighties Alliance. On top of that, he had massacred over the years. The number of resources and treasure he had was terrifyingly abundant.

Emperor God Han Ye was only an ordinary Emperor God. Even if she brought up an exceedingly great request, Jian Wushuang would be able to fulfill it. Let alone the fact that Emperor God Han Ye shouldn’t have the guts to be unreasonable.

Emperor God Han Ye’s expressions changed multiple times and there was a flash of hesitation before she said solemnly, “Sword Emperor, I don’t need any resources or treasure. I only need a favor from you.”

“A favor?” Jian Wushuang was taken by surprise, “Try me.”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t in a hurry. He had his limits.

If the favor that Emperor God Han Ye asked for was just a simple matter, he naturally wouldn’t refuse her.

However, if the favor were to be troublesome or complicated and required some effort to carry out, or even had risk, Jian Wushuang would definitely not agree with it.

Although Sword Principle Xuan Luo was impressive and Jian Wushuang was looking forward to getting it, it was merely a fraction of the sword principle. It wasn’t worth Jian Wushuang putting in too much effort to get it.

Emperor God Han Ye took a deep breath and lowered her voice, “Sword Emperor, do you know that I have an enemy?

“Enemy? You mean Yan Zun?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

After he found out that the sword stele that contained the last bit of Sword Principle Xuan Luo was in Emperor God Han Ye’s hand, Jian Wushuang did a background check on Emperor God Han Ye.

Emperor God Han Ye did have an enemy and it was the kind that shared profound hatred. The enemy of hers was Yan Zun!!

Yan Zun, who was last among all Great Emperors on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

“Emperor God Han Ye, you are not thinking to ask me to kill Yan Zun on your behalf, right?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze became cold.

Although Yan Zun was in last place among all Great Emperors, he was still a Great Emperor.

How powerful must one be to be able to kill a Great Emperor? On Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, besides Emperor Bai, no one else could do that.

Even Red Dragon King on the second place, right below Emperor Bai, even if he launched a full-force attack and paid a price, it would still not be definite that he could kill Yan Zun.

Unless there were two to three Great Emperors joining forces, then there would be a chance.

If Jian Wushuang were to join forces with Jian Yi and play some trump cards, they might be able to kill Yan Zun. However, for a fraction of Sword Principle, he had to kill a Great Emperor?

That was impossible.

“Sword Emperor, you misunderstood me. It is only a sword stele. How can I ask Sword Emperor to kill Yan Zun for me? I only wanted Sword Emperor to teach Yan Zun a lesson. You don’t have to kill him but let him be in a fix and embarrass him. That will do,” Emperor God Han Ye said.

“Just to embarrass him?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

It would be simple if he was only required to embarrass him.

“It seems that your hatred of Yan Zun is unusual. With any slight chance, you’d want to use it against him,” Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor God Han Ye curiously.

Emperor God Han Ye’s eyes were immediately filled with boundless hatred and murderous intention.
