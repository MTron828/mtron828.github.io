Chapter 5299: Yuanyang Lake

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Demon Sound Mountain.

On a snow-white path, countless Emperors gazed up at the mountain peak.

The aura that had just swept through froze them in place, a force that shook heaven and earth, lifting the entire Demon Sound Mountain with the power of the world.

‚ÄúWhat kind of power is this? Why do I feel like Demon Sound Mountain is moving!

‚ÄúMoving?‚Äù

The few Emperors at the forefront couldn‚Äôt help but tremble!

The mountain road on Demon Sound Mountain was already incredibly difficult to traverse, and yet someone was able to move the entire mountain. That person must possess unimaginable strength.

Space twisted and shifted!

Zhen Ling at the mountain peak was extremely delighted.

Moving Demon Sound Mountain was too easy for him. It was as simple as raising his hand.

A treasure trove had been shifted to the core area of the Qishen Temple.

The core of the Qishen Temple.

The Four Great Secret realms overlapped with each other.

At the top was the Heaven Realm, vast and boundless. In addition to the vast divine land that stretched out endlessly, countless planets and lands floated in the sky.

The civilization here had inherited the remnants of ancient times, with numerous major sects and incredibly powerful forces. Otherwise, the White Tiger Temple, one of the Four Major Temples, wouldn‚Äôt be in such a weary state.

Beneath the Heaven Realm was the Earthly Realm.

In the Earthly Realm below, the atmosphere was even more bloody. Most humans still lived in tribal societies, in an era even more ancient.

In some lands, one could even see ancient gods and demons running wild.

Unlike the Heaven Realm, the Earthly Realm was not a unified entity.

The arrangement of the Earthly Realm resembled a vast universe, dividing into numerous domains.

From a distance, the Four Major Secret Realms were layered like a towering pavilion.

The human realm existed on the third level, a grand universe with several star systems and planets.

At the bottom lay the divine realm‚Äôs secret realm, or rather, the divine tomb.

It was the tomb of Qishen.

Previously, the barriers to enter the divine tomb were impenetrable. However, the power within the tomb grew stronger, and the fundamental rules began to give birth to formidable Special Life Forms. Some of these Special Life Forms reached the pinnacle of strength, allowing them to break the barriers and escape into other secret realms.

Powerful beings from other secret realms followed suit, infiltrating the divine tomb through these openings, searching for the legendary ‚ÄòEnigma of Qishen‚Äô that was spread across various realms.

At that time, both the White Tiger Temple and the Guardians mobilized, but they couldn‚Äôt capture the elusive being.

Eventually, traces were found in the Forest of Eternal Secrets in the earthly realm. Despite the combined efforts of the White Tiger Hall and the

Guardians, they couldn‚Äôt suppress this entity. In the end, even a tier 6 Emperor perished in the attempt. It took Zhen Ling to personally intervene to suppress the intruder.

When dealing with the indigenous powerful figures from the Qishen Temple, Zhen Ling showed mercy.

As long as their actions weren‚Äôt too outrageous, they wouldn‚Äôt be suppressed.

However, breaking the barriers and enabling communication between the Four Major Secret Realms was unacceptable.

Now, the secret realms could freely traverse between each other, and the divine tomb was becoming a playground for these indigenous Emperor-level figures. This couldn‚Äôt be allowed to continue.

Zhen Ling took matters into his own hands, suppressing the intruder and sending them to the second prison.

Whoever bowed down would eventually be released, but those who refused would remain imprisoned in the Second Prison forever.

Buzz!

Space trembled!

Although Zhen Ling had broken free from the spatial constraints, forcefully entering one of the four major secret realms still caused significant disturbances.

If a tier 6 Emperor wanted to enter the secret realms, apart from teleportation arrays, there was simply no way to do so. It was only due to Zhen Lings immense strength that he could barge in.

Upon entering one of the secret realms, the Celestial Temple stationed in the void instantly rushed over from the Heavenly Realm.

Crash!

The temple doors swung open.

A warrior clad in white armor and a tiger-headed helmet stepped out.

His aura was different from the others in the three halls.

A chilling intent emanated from his eyes.

Upon seeing Zhen Ling, he nodded slightly, neither servile nor overbearing.

Among the four temples, if one were to assess which hall held the most power, it wasn‚Äôt the outer hall‚Äôs Black Tortoise, but the core‚Äôs White Tiger.

They controlled the Four Great Secret Realms and detained countless powerful beings. Over the years, even tier 6 Emperors had been captured.

When Qishen crafted them, he left behind numerous Guardian Gods in the White Tiger Temple, each one a top-notch tier 6 fighter.

Furthermore, the Temple Master possessed a cosmic treasure‚Äîa weapon that had slain Emperors of the same tier.

Their strength was formidable, perhaps only comparable to the Azure Dragon‚Äôs Temple Master.

Zhu Yi and Xuan One were no match for him.

However, in terms of treasures and techniques, the two of them were not on par with Zhu Yi and Xuan One.

The Black Tortoise Hall had established several strongholds, fortified like impregnable fortresses. Even the lords of the universe might struggle to breach them. They were the foremost gatekeepers of the Qishen Temple.

In summary, each of the four temples had its own strengths.

The Elder Palace, on the other hand, was utterly useless‚Äîa group of defeated generals.

Initially treated like outcasts, they were inexplicably valued by Zhen Ling.

Zhen Ling noticed the unfavorable expression on Bai Yi‚Äôs face. He had intended to say a few more words, but now, he decided against it.

With a disdainful snort, Zhen Ling and Zhu Yi swiftly left the area.

The Heaven Realm‚Äôs secret realm was vast, and not even an Emperor could traverse it effortlessly.

Only beings as powerful as Zhen Ling could move freely within its confines.

The Elder Palace‚Äôs headquarters were strategically located in the center of the celestial realm.

‚ÄúYuanyang Lake! ‚Äù

This place was special. It had been moved from the core of an ancient universe during ancient times.

The Yuanyang Lake had once given birth to an extraordinary being, the Yuanyang Lord.

However, this powerful being was later slain by the Desolation Divine Master, led by the Desolate God Lord. Even the Yuanyang Lord‚Äôs lair was relocated to the Qishen Temple.

Upon entering the Yuanyang Lake, Zhen Ling extended his palm, and a small, exquisite mountain materialized, with snowflakes drifting above it.

The mountain flew out of Zhen Lings hand, transforming into billions of specks and gently landing on a deserted island.

Although the Yuanyang Lake was a lake, its actual area was larger than even the Great Si Region. With only a few people in the Elder Palace, there was plenty of unused space.

There had been some commotion caused by the activities of the Demon Sound Mountain, and soon, a middle-aged Daoist with a high hat arrived.

Upon seeing the newcomer, the Daoist involuntarily gasped, swallowing hard and finding it impossible to leave.

The newcomer was none other than Wu Zuo, a recognized disciple of the Qishen Temple.

After a period of exploration with the White Tiger Temple, he promptly joined the Elder Palace when it gained momentum.

With his identity as a Qishen Temple disciple, he not only gained substantial benefits but also completely restored his strength.

Although he didn‚Äôt have a token with the word others respected him greatly due to his status. It gave him a feeling of returning to his former glory. However, upon seeing Zhen Lings arrival, his enthusiasm waned instantly.

He had witnessed Zhen Ling‚Äôs methods before.

Zhen Ling dared to provoke even the Four Great Temple. Needless to say, he wouldn‚Äôt spare a recognized disciple like Wu Zuo.

Moreover, it was Zhen Ling who had stripped him of his status as a recognized disciple in the first place.

‚ÄúLittle Wu Zuo, why are you running? In my presence, you should show respect! ‚Äù

Zhen Ling observed Wu Zuo with a playful glint in his eyes.

When Qishen fell, the other Divine Masters perished, and even the Emperor fell into a deep slumber.

Among the disciples of Qishen, Wu Zuo was the last one left standing. All his comrades had fallen, leaving him, a deceitful individual, as the sole survivor. UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

With no one else remaining, he had the audacity to return and even harbored the shameless desire to take control of the Qishen Temple..
