Chapter 5268: Migration

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This is considered banishing Bai Yi to the border.

Having just suppressed the rebellion in the four major secret realms, Zhen

Ling showed no mercy. The elders couldn’t help but gasp at this ruthlessness. To oppress the old forces so intensely, it seemed Zhen Ling was determined to cleanse the internal forces of the Qishen Temple.

These elders were all astute individuals, understanding Zhen Lings intentions.

This was also their opportunity. Seizing the decline of the old forces, they could rise in power.

Restore their peak!

“Alright, the matter is settled. You all are busy people. I won’t keep you here.

Go about your tasks. End the trial in the Original Realm as soon as possible.

True cultivation lies in the four major secret realms, not the Original Planets. As for the peripheral Yan Immortals in the outer world, I suggest leaving them in the Black Tortoise Temple for Xuanwu Yi to personally nurture. Once they reach Grand Yan Immortal level, then transfer them to the Original

Realm.”

Zhen Lings voice was calm, just a sentence, and he dismissed them.

He looked down upon these stubborn puppets from the bottom of his heart.

Even if they had a heart as intricate as a seven-holed exquisite jade, their thoughts far exceeded those of normal people; they were still not human. In the end, they were just puppets.

After the several Temple Masters withdrew, Zhen Ling turned to face the elders, revealing a hint of kindness in his smile.

“Dear sirs, the Qishen Temple has been successfully established, and you all have contributed to this. I will now fulfill the promise made years ago. Your status will be restored, and you can reside in the Elder’s Palace. You can go to the boundaries of the four major secret realms. My people are there.”

The voice of Zhen Ling paused for a moment, then continued, “Once your identities are restored, you will be rewarded according to your merits. Rest assured, everything you have done will not be forgotten by the Qishen Temple.”

The group of elders bowed respectfully, expressing their gratitude, and then their figures gradually disappeared.

Currently, they were still weak and couldn’t move freely yet. Zhen Ling had transported them to the four great mysteries.

After these people had all left, Zhen Ling’s expression became serious. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The former Lord of Black Tortoise Hall, Xuanvvu Yi, who had originally left, reappeared in the sea of origin source.

Zhen Ling wasn’t surprised to see him and politely said, “Xuanvvu Yi, the senior left something for you. Now you can talk.”

“Lord Zhen Ling, please don’t be anxious!”

The two figures flickered and appeared in the central part of the sea of origin source, where there was a green palace.

After entering the palace, the two sat facing each other. A teapot appeared out of thin air on the jade table in front of them.

After pouring a cup of tea for Xuanwu Yi, Zhen Ling also poured one for himself.

“Can we talk now?”

After glancing around, Xuanwu Yi still seemed uneasy. “This matter is too significant.”

“Don’t worry. Within this hall, there is control over time and space. It has become independent of the temporal and spatial realms, making it one of the most powerful treasures in the Qishen Temple. You can rest assured,” Zhen Ling said solemnly.

After slowly sipping some tea, Xuanwu Yi nodded and finally began to speak about the hidden secret.

Upon hearing it, Zhen Ling’s whole being trembled, and his eyes stared blankly ahead.

Xuanwu Yi shook his head silently.

Like the other three temple masters, he was originally a puppet crafted by the Qishen Temple. Despite being bestowed with a delicate seven-aperture heart, he knew deep down he was no true cultivator.

The Qishen had given him only a seven-aperture heart, while the predecessor had gifted him a complete life.

A cultivator’s essence lay in their divine body, origin source, and physical form—these were the crucial elements.

But genuine humanity was not represented by these factors alone. Emotions, wisdom, contemplation—these intangibles defined true personhood.

“l understand. Can you still contact the predecessor now?” Zhen Ling inquired further.

Yuan Yi shook his head and shared his speculation.

“That predecessor might not be a contemporary cultivator at all. Instead, he could be a future powerhouse controlling the fabric of spacetime. He traversed the river of time, arriving in the Original Universe, entering the Qishen

Temple. Even in the outer realms, his presence can be felt.”

“The future!” Despite Zhen Lings extensive knowledge inherited from the Qishen, the notion seemed incredible.

A wielder of spacetime, someone capable of traversing time, achieving true Immortality—such a powerhouse. Why would they return to this nearly desiccated River of Time?

Zhen Ling was perplexed. Not only did this being possess mastery over spacetime, but they also chose to arrive at this particular moment, in a universe bereft of a Lord. What could be the purpose of their arrival?

Amidst the vast expanse of the cosmos, amidst numerous cosmic streams, why choose this specific one? Moreover, why lead the Qishen Temple here?

Everything was for what purpose?

“Do you know the name of that predecessor?” Xuan shook his head, recalling something. He said, “That predecessor seemed intentional about concealing his identity. He used my name in the outside world.”

“Time travel seems to have its limitations. Even if one controls time and space, certain events of this era cannot be changed,” Zhen Ling speculated.

Such methods were too unimaginable; he was merely guessing.

“Lord Zhen Ling, let’s focus on the matter at hand! If that predecessor is willing to give a warning, it means that some things in the future can be changed. We can’t just sit back and wait for death,” Xuanwu Yi furrowed his brow. That particular matter could indeed impact the overall situation, possibly even causing the complete collapse of the Qishen Temple.

“Let’s move first,” Zhen Ling sighed.

When he mentioned moving, he didn’t mean leaving the Original Universe; it was far more complex than that. They had to leave this flow of time and space, drifting into the chaotic unknown of the temporal turbulence, moving to other streams of time and space.

Xuanwu Yi’s eyes flickered, and he blurted out, “Move!”

“We have no choice. We can only move first. If what that predecessor said is true, we must move. Our original body’s fall couldn’t be changed, but now that the great calamity is approaching, if we can’t change it, at least we can escape for now!” Zhen Ling decided firmly after paying attention.

Both fell silent and quietly sipped their tea.

Because of that matter, he had to bring out those useless people and establish the Elder Palace.

All of this was to prepare for the move, to prepare for the journey to other streams of time and space.

The Qishen Temple was a mobile treasure trove. Without a few strong individuals, how could they defend this family legacy?

In the face of that matter, the trials seemed somewhat feeble and powerless.

In the Original Universe.

Qiuhuang City!

Hu Qing was the first to finish, followed by Wan Xing.

The other two city walls continued to resist fiercely. Xue Yue and Leng Shuang had significantly increased their strength. Together, they could barely contend and defend the city wall.

Jian Wushuang was the one in real danger.

With the Transcendent Immortal Formation and the remaining 20,000 Grand Yan Immortals, facing nearly three million Devouring Demons, he still couldn’t completely hold his ground.

The towering figure of Jian Wushuang was entangling the Devouring Demons attacking the barrier while also intercepting the remaining five million Devouring Demons.

It could be said that he single-handedly faced all the Devouring Demons on the battlefield.

“Si Tim! ”

This person was practically useless. It was truly baffling to him how a Dao Lord, a strong individual, could be so useless. He shared no burden whatsoever; he was like a headless fly, blindly crashing around.

The sword array formation and the Law of Heaven and Earth were exhausting for him. Strangely, the rate of slaughter was slower than before. How long would they have to keep this up? “It seems like I have to use that move!”
