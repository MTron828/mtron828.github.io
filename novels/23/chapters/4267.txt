4268 Moluo’s Fury

“Moluo’s charge!”

“Sundering Stars!”

Bang!

The Wuqi Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand collided with the sharp and curved horns of Moluo Yangu.

Suddenly, a deafening sound rang out!

The star slashing swordsmanship, which had been pushed to perfection by Jian Wushuang, instantly turned into a five-thousand-foot sword rainbow that pressed across the void and pierced through the sun and moon!

The brilliant sword power destroyed everything!

The sword slashed at the pair of sharp and curved horns on Moluo Yangu’s head, instantly severing them!

Like a knife cutting through tofu, a section of Moluo’s pair of ox horns was directly cut off!

Divine blood spurted all over the sky, and a rain of blood fell on the battlefield of the 16th city.

“Commander Yangu!”

“Commander Yangu!”

In an instant, the expressions of the other members of the Moluo clan who were guarding at the side changed. They cried out anxiously and immediately wanted to rush over to help Moluo Yangu.

“I’m fine.”

A stream of divine blood flowed out of his mouth. He waved his hand at the people of the Moluo clan, indicating that it was fine. Then, he took a deep breath, looked at Jian Wushuang, and said in a deep voice, “Blood Sword, it’s time for you to see the innate divine ability of our Moluo clan!”

He then turned to look at Hei Teng and said, “Blackpeak, I’ll leave the rest to you.”

After he finished speaking, he slowly closed his eyes.

At the same time, the eyes of the boy with braids sitting on his shoulder opened.

Jian Wushuang frowned and a faint sense of fear welled up.

The boy’s eyes were black, and there was a small white dot in the center of his eyes.

“Blood Sword, our Moluo clan doesn’t cultivate any remarkable abilities or secret techniques. We only rely on our innate physical strength and the accompanying black armored child!”

The next moment.

The boy with plaits spoke. However, the strange thing was that he was silent when he spoke. On the other hand, although Moluo Yangu did not speak, the voice came from his mouth.

His voice was no longer as low as before, but it had become a little sharp.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and his expression turned serious.

“Blood Sword, as long as you can withstand one of my moves, we will be even. From then on, you will be a friend of the Moluo clan!” Moluo Yangu continued.

“Alright,” he said.

Jian Wushuang nodded. He held the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand tightly and waited quietly for the strongest move of Moluo Yangu!

“Innate divine ability, Moluo’s wrath!!!”

“Die!” Moluo Yangu raised his head and roared in anger. The black-armored child on his shoulder began to rapidly form hand seals!

As the black-armored boy began to form hand seals, the space in front of his chest began to compress!

An extremely concentrated black light wave began to congregate on the chest of Moluo Yangu!

“Blood Sword, take it!”

“Die!” Moluo Yangu roared in anger and stomped his right foot forward. In an instant, the black light wave was like a laser that could destroy space and shot toward Jian Wushuang!

The black laser was as thick as a bucket and was extremely fast. everything that was touched by the black laser was turned into nothing!

An unlucky Ultimate Ruler reacted slightly slower and was grazed by the black laser. He died and turned into dust.

“Is this the innate divine ability of the Moluo clan?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was solemn as he used his own talent!

Innate divine power, original universe!

Innate divine ability, life intimidation!!

Immediately, two realms with extremely strong suppressive forces descended!

In this realm, Jian Wushuang slowly raised the Wuqi Divine Sword. The fourth level of sword principle origin, mixed with an extremely high level of universe law, exploded!

“Slash…star!”

Bang!

The silver sword rainbow condensed once again. However, this time, the silver sword rainbow had already expanded to 10000 feet under the various forces!

What kind of concept was a sword rainbow that was ten thousand feet long?

This sword directly covered the entire void of the battlefield of the 16th city, covering the sky and the sun. It was mighty to the extreme!

“Slash!”

Along with Jian Wushuang’s shout, the sword rainbow that covered the sky suddenly slashed down!

Pu chi chi!

The silver-white sword beam and the black laser beam collided together!

At that moment, the world seemed to have been divided into two images. On the left was the image of Moluo Yangu, who was covered in black laser light, and on the right was Jian Wushuang, who was holding a silver-white sword rainbow that was nearly ten thousand feet long!

The silver sword rainbow, which had always been successful, finally met its match this time!

The two continued to wrestle. Jian Wushuang’s right foot stomped heavily on the ground, but he was forced to retreat by the huge force of the black laser!

As for Moluo, he was in an even worse state. He kept growling and his huge body started to crack bit by bit.

At that moment, many of the Ultimate Rulers who were fighting in the sixteenth city stopped fighting and looked at Moluo and Jian Wushuang.

“Buddha is merciful. These two must have killed many people.” The Rabbit Buddha held the Buddhist staff in his hand and put his palms together. He let out a long sigh, bemoaning the state of the universe and pitying the fate of mankind. Later on, let this poor monk save them from their sin of killing.

On the other side.

The handsome young man in a snow-white robe and a Marten fur waistcoat on his left shoulder raised his head to look at the battle between Jian Wushuang and Moluo after killing an Ultimate Ruler with one stroke of his blade. His eyes narrowed.

“What a terrifying sword intent.”

Not only the two of them, but there were also gazes from all directions that were fixed on Jian Wushuang and Moluo.

Bang!

In the end, a huge explosion sounded, setting off white waves.

Jian Wushuang and Moluo were both blocked by the smoke and dust that filled the air.

They were surrounded by violent and chaotic divine power, and no one dared to get close.

The smoke and dust gradually dispersed.

A shocking scene happened.

He saw that Moluo Yangu was half-kneeling on the ground. A long stream of divine blood was flowing out of his mouth.

The Wuqi Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand stopped just a few inches above the head of the ancient flame.

Victory or defeat, victory or defeat, it was obvious at a glance!

“Blood Sword, you win.” Said Moluo Yangu as he panted heavily and raised his head with some difficulty.

“Thanks for letting me win.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly but did not intend to kill him. Instead, he turned his eyes and looked in the direction of the five God sealing monuments.

The battle between the Golden Crow Prince and the dark demon descendant was already drawing to an end.

Both of them were unrivaled Rulers, but it was a pity that the Golden Crow Prince was the eldest son of the Golden Crow great emperor, a descendant of the dark devil born from the Blood River, but he was still a bit weaker.

“Die, you filthy and lowly worm.”

The golden crow’s eyes were blazing with fire. He glanced indifferently at the dark demon descendant’s body, which was riddled with holes and on the verge of collapse. His voice was neither happy nor sad, and it did not contain any emotion.

The dark demon descendant’s giant axe was already broken into two. He raised his head and looked at the Golden Crow Prince, his eyes full of unwillingness.

Just as the Golden Crow Prince was about to kill the dark demon descendant… Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly!

A sword shadow rode the divine sword and shot toward the five Investiture of the Gods!

The sword shadow was Jian Wushuang, who had defeated Moluo Yangu!
