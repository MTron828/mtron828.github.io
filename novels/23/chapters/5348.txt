Chapter 5349: Kill the Emperor

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Speaking of which, the current Heaven Realm’s Shadow Sect in the Northern Region is like a mouse on the street, too afraid to show itself.

Wu Zuo was very powerful and ruthless. The Divine Temple is responsible for managing the Four Great Secret Realms, and with so many people in the Elder Palace, they only oversee the Northern Region. Soon, they transformed the entire Northern Region into a unified entity. All sects must make offerings every year; whoever stops will face death.

Every cultivator reaching the level of Grand Yan Immortal must register at the Elder Palace’s gate. Those without clear identities are to be executed.

Moreover, an outer palace has been established, and even Emperors are forcibly enrolled. Refusing to be listed in the outer palace means death.

Wu Zuo personally hunts down those Emperors who try to escape.

In just a thousand years, thousands of Emperors have fled from the Northern Region in the Heavenly Realm. Most of the fugitives are independent cultivators. The Elder Palace is too powerful; resistance is futile, so they can only escape.

Bai Yi t s eyes were burning with desire. He’s already prepared to abdicate voluntarily, letting the Elder Palace take control of the Heavenly Realm.

Because of this, the Earthly Realm has become lively. Many Emperors who committed crimes in the Heavenly Realm have fled to the Earthly Realm. They don’t want the Elder Palace to control the Heavenly Realm and be hunted down everywhere.

These fleeing Emperors from the Heavenly Realm are causing chaos, looting and pillaging, before arriving in the Mortal Realm.

In this auction, quite a few valuable treasures were obtained and are ready for auction.

However, these treasures are too expensive, and Jian Wushuang can’t afford them.

Although he has been involved in killing and looting over the years, his actions have been relatively minor. Currently, he only has a few million divine stones.

In the residence of the Ninth Prince, he also gathered over a million, including some treasures that need to be sold.

“Money!’

It’s not easy to earn.

The days spent in Qiuhuang City were still fresh in Jian Wushuang’s memory. He had accumulated treasures worth millions, rivaling the value of tens of millions of godstones.

Over the years, he had assisted Bai Junwang in recovering his origin source, earning a considerable amount of treasures in the process. These accomplishments were considered contributions, but all the resources gained were spent in one go when he purchased information the last time.

Now, he had nothing left. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

While contemplating his situation, news from the outside reached him. “Your Highness, we’ve arrived at the Beastfight Arena!”

Jian Wushuang slowly opened the curtain of the carriage and looked up. A

huge colosseum came Into view.

In the colosseum.

It was a dueling ground set up by the royal family.

As the name suggested, fighting to the death within the imperial city was forbidden, but if one sought a life-and-death battle, they could come to this place.

Before reaching the entrance, a bare-chested, muscular man emerged from it.

“Ninth Prince!” The man, rough but attentive, quickly bowed in respect.

Jian Wushuang gestured for him to rise and, with a cold and proud gaze, walked straight toward the Beastfight Arena, the muscular man following closely behind.

“I heard there’s a good show today,” Jian Wushuang remarked casually.

The rugged man quickly responded, “It’s not exactly a great show, just a life-and-death battle between two tier 3 Emperors.”

“Old Pei San, you sure are arrogant!” Jian Wushuang turned and fixed an icy stare on the sturdy man, saying in a low voice, “When did tier 3 Emperors become so ordinary?”

When Pei San heard this, he knew that the Ninth Prince was trying to suppress him. He quickly bowed and said, “This humble one dares not. I will never forget Ninth Prince’s great kindness. If it weren’t for Ninth Prince’s shelter back then, I would have perished in the Chaos Region long ago.”

In the past, it was Xia Mang Guanyu who, following his grandfather Xuanyuan Dapan, ventured into the Chaos Region and saved his life. Subsequently, he was brought to the Grand Xia Imperial Capital, where a position in the Beastfight Arena was arranged for him.

Pei San, at the pinnacle of the tier 3 Emperor.

Staying by his side seemed somewhat underutilized, so he was dispatched here. However, for external battles, the presence of this figure was indispensable.

After the pounding, Jian Wushuang remained silent, only waving his hand.

His visit to the Beastfight Arena wasn’t solely for Pei San; the primary purpose was to earn money.

“How’s the betting for these two?” Jian Wushuang casually inquired.

This time, Pei San became even more respectful and replied, “There’s approximately 40 million godstones!”

“But,” Pei San hesitated.

He knew Jian Wushuang had other motives for being here, and that’s what worried him. Even if he were asked to risk his life for the Ninth Prince, he wouldn’t bat an eye.

However, violating the rules of the Beastfight Arena was a different matter; it could be a matter of life and death, and not even a prince could alter that.

“Don’t worry, I understand the rules!” Jian Wushuang reassured him.

With a tier 5 Emperor present, even if he had ten times the courage, he wouldn’t dare to break the rules.

Both tier 3 Emperors had considerable fame within the Imperial Capital.

One of them was a Sword Immortal at the peak of tier 3. He was known as one of the 79 Swords in the Capital and ranked 79th.

“Jian Qijin!’

He had the same surname as Jian Wushuang.

That’s him,” Jian Wushuangs gaze shifted as he entered the Beastfight Arena.

As he stepped in, a strand of hair fell from his head, casually drifting in the air.

“Old Ghost Bai, I can’t instantly suppress a tier 3 Emperor. I’ll leave it to you later. I’ll take responsibility for the loss of the origin source!” Jian Wushuang secretly transmitted his voice.

The one posing as the Ninth Prince was just a clone; the true body had always been a strand of hair, now floating and following the Ninth Prince.

“Tsk tsk, rest assured!”

The current Bai Junwang had almost recovered his origin source, so killing a tier 3 Emperor was still achievable.

However, the current origin source was too unstable. Killing some tier 3 Emperors was acceptable, as it wouldn’t cause too much dispersion of the origin source. But if he were to attempt to kill a tier 4 Emperor, it would likely result in a significant loss of the origin source, something Bai Junwang was unwilling to risk.

For him, killing a tier 3 Emperor was already the limit.

The Ninth Prince Xiamang Guanyu followed Pei San to the entrance of the VIP lounge. When they entered, he suddenly said, “I’m quite interested in that guy, the ’79 Sword’. Take me to see him; he might perish today.”

Although Pei San was in a difficult position, he still brought him to the secret room.

“Go in and report. Even if I want to see him, prepare for the match!” Pei San said sternly.

The black-robed Emperor inside the secret room frowned when he heard this, but when he saw the Ninth Prince Xia Mang Guanyu, he reluctantly entered the depths.

They were about to enter the arena of life and death. Sometimes, these reckless individuals sometimes didn’t care much about someone’s status.

However, Jian Qijin followed the black-robed Emperor out of the secret room and arrived in front of Pei San.

Taking advantage of the situation, Jian Wushuang, in the form of a hair strand, also followed in.

After some casual conversation, Xia Mang Guanyu offered some words of encouragement, and they all left.

After everyone left, Jian Qijin frowned. He always felt that these people came for no apparent reason. However, about to step into the arena, he didn’t bother with such matters and returned to the secret room to calm his mind.

But just as the door closed, Jian Wushuang acted instantly.

The entire space was only a few meters wide. With all the Thought energy and devouring power surrounding it, it instantly caused the Jian Qijin to collapse to the ground. ithout waiting for any resistance, the phantom of Bai Junwang floated out, and a palm landed on the opponent’s head.

At the same time, in the VIP lounge of the colosseum..
