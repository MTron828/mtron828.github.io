4650 The Death of Void God, the World Becomes Clear

The void power was like silk and mist, descending from the ancient formation.

As soon as this vast and strange array was used, both the Supreme realm experts and the Void Masters felt the power in their bodies weaken to a certain level.

Even Jian Wushuang felt that the divine power in his body was suppressed by an unknown force.

The void power spread out, and a vast array appeared above Void God’s head. Countless chains shot out from his body, shooting out in all directions with a destructive aura.

White Ape, the Overlord Patriarch, felt a sense of life and death approaching. He subconsciously pushed the Overlord a few hundred meters away.

The chain with Ancestral-level power easily pierced through White Ape’s abdomen, and even his soul was about to be destroyed.

“Patriarch!” Overlord wanted to rush over madly, but he was stopped by White Ape. “Don’t come over, you brat!”

Divine blood seeped out of White Ape’s mouth, and his body quickly turned into dust. He looked at the Overlord with eyes full of reluctance, “Live well. When you win, you can take me back!”

With that, White Ape rushed into the army of Void Warriors at the last moment of his death.

Boom!

The magnificent explosion tore a crack in the army, and several Six Scar Void Masters were killed.

Lu Ding made his move and covered himself with the power of yang, only then was he able to barely repel the chains that were coming at him.

Jian Wushuang’s face was as calm as water. He no longer cared if Void God had changed. He immediately condensed an invisible sword and slashed at him.

A vast Sword Intent rose, and the sword style was like the flowing light covered Void God like a Heavenly River.

There was a ferocious laugh and then two huge palms separated the Sword Intent river. At the same time, the huge head of the ancestral Demon God form bit at Jian Wushuang without saying anything.

Unable to dodge in time, his entire body was swallowed by the ancestral Demon God form.

As far as the eye could see, the endless black fog was like a chain that trapped him in his stomach. The Demon God had its own rules and was nibbling away at Jian Wushuang’s divine power at an extremely fast speed.

The ancestral form shut its mouth in satisfaction and lay down on the back of Void God.

Sensing the increasingly weak struggle in the ancestral form, Void God finally relaxed. He looked not far away, where Lu Ding was already rushing over with the power of yang.

Void God did not dare to be careless since they were both Ancestor realm experts.

“Spit out Palace Master Wushuang!” Lu Ding’s face was livid. “Otherwise, don’t blame me for killing you on the spot!”

As if he had heard the funniest joke in the world, Void God sneered. “I don’t understand. You’re already an Ancestor. Why do you still care about a little Half Ancestor?”

A glint flashed across Lu Ding’s eyes, but he did not say anything. He waved his arm, and a Qilin form surrounded by extreme yang power roared and attacked Void God.

The ancestral Demon God form behind him saw this and swung its two giant arms at the Qilin.

Instantly, the battlefield trembled. After the void power and divine power collided, the light waves produced lit up the darkness.

Void God and Lu Ding both took a step back. Before the Qilin form finally dissipated, it tore off half of the Demon God’s arm.

“Let Palace Master Wushuang out. Otherwise, it won’t be your ancestral form’s arm that’s going to be broken next time,” Lu Ding said in a low voice.

Void God did not say anything. Just as he was about to attack again, the ancestral form behind him suddenly trembled.

In the next moment, a River of swords shot out and exploded the head of the ancestral Demon God form.

At the same time, a figure with divine patterns floating all over his body stepped forward with a sword in hand.

The Tarot Divine Sword was pointed at the ground. Jian Wushuang looked at Void God arrogantly and then he raised the Tarot Divine Sword and slashed down.

This sword was so powerful that it could split the sky!

The ancestral Demon God form crumbled immediately, and Void God raised his hand to resist.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang was fine, Lu Ding was overjoyed. He controlled his yang divine power to attack Void God together.

This attack even destroyed the void. It was like a black hole that devoured all things, absorbing all the divine power and void power that dissipated in the universe.

All the Supreme experts and Void Masters who were fighting were shocked by this scene.

When the light faded, Void God, whose left arm had been destroyed and whose chest had been opened, slowly took a step forward.

The void power dissipated, and it could not even continue to repair his broken body.

Jian Wushuang descended with his sword in hand. He looked at him with a complicated expression.

If Void God had killed him during the last Great Catastrophe War, he and Old Master would have had no chance of survival.

However, in the end, he let them go for some reason.

No one spoke first. Even though most of his body was shattered, Void God still stood upright, and the shadow in their eyes did not change.

“I just want to ask you one thing. We are clearly mortal enemies, so why did you let us go back then?” Jian Wushuang did not carry out the next step. Instead, he used a voice that only the two of them could hear to question Void God.

“There’s no reason why. Everything that has happened today is all because of me. My biggest mistake was underestimating your growth potential.” Void God looked at Jian Wushuang and said slowly, “Your terrifying growth rate has far exceeded my expectations.”

Without saying anything, Jian Wushuang understood why Void God had let him live. However, what had happened had already happened and no one could change it. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

An invisible sword with a red-gold divine pattern appeared in his hand. Jian Wushuang said, “You should know the situation that is coming up. I will not let you live.”

Void God’s calm face curved into a smile. “My life isn’t that easy to take. Just come.”

Jian Wushuang was also unusually calm. If this guy stretched out his neck to be killed, he would not be Void God.

He turned his body into a Sword Intent, and the infinite sword way rainbow was like a big river that instantly swept toward Void God.

“Don’t!”

Devouring Emperor, who was being held up by Old Master, shouted. He wanted to help Jian Wushuang, but he could not let go. He could only watch Jian Wushuang’s sword stab at Void God.

Puchi…

The sound of metal penetrating flesh reverberated. The Wushuang Sword Dao’s River poured into Void God’s chest, destroying his ancestral source.

He did not dodge at all. He just stood there and let Jian Wushuang’s long sword pierce through him.

Jian Wushuang was shocked. If Void God fought with all his might, the best outcome would be that Void God would die and he would be seriously injured.

However, Void God did not resist. Instead, after Jian Wushuang’s long sword pierced his body, he reached out his hand, grabbed the sword blade, and pushed it forward.

The void power collapsed, and the Dao that belonged to Void God was being destroyed.

Unparalleled fate energy began to overflow from his body and was fed back to the Void Universe through the chasm.

All the Void Masters who were fighting desperately felt that Void God was about to die, so they all looked at him in despair.

“Jian Wushuang, I destroyed my Ancestor realm fate energy just to ask you for one thing.”
