Chapter 2870: Killing Young Master Qu

——

Looking at the earth-shattering power in front of him, Young Master Qu’s eyes were filled with extreme fanaticism.

This fanaticism was his admiration for his father.

The Undying Sage, the true overlord of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, was much stronger than the reverent god.

All below the sage were ants. This sentence was definitely not casually said.

Weng weng~ the power that filled the sky finally dissipated completely.

That piece of void slowly revealed its original appearance.

“Is he dead?”

Young Master Qu stood on the spot, staring at the void in front of him.

But at this moment, a powerful sword intent swept out mercilessly, annihilating the many powers in the surroundings.

Following that, a human figure slowly stepped out and appeared in front of the Young Master Qu once again.

“The power of the Immortal Saint’s strike is indeed impressive.”

Jian Wushuang praised, but there was a faint smile on his face and a mocking look on his face.

Young Master Qu, who had been confident and had absolute confidence in the life-saving command talisman refined by his father, suddenly turned pale.

“How, how is this possible?”

Young Master Qu stared at Jian Wushuang with wide eyes, as if he could not believe what was happening.

He also could not believe that his father had made this life-saving command talisman himself.

Moreover, his father had told him not to use the life-saving command talisman unless it was a life-or-death situation. Once he used the power of the command talisman, no one below the Immortal Saint could survive, even the Invincible Divine Masters could not survive.

He believed his father’s words.

But now, Jian Yi had survived the power of the command token.

Not only did he survive, but he also looked like he did not have any wounds.

Yes, he was not injured at all, and his aura had been magnificent. Obviously, Jian Wushuang did not suffer from the power of the command token.

This made Master Qu feel incredulous.

However, no matter how shocked he was, the truth had already happened.

He had used his last trump card, the life-saving token, but Jian Wushuang did not die. So what happened next…

“Master Qu, it seems that you will die in the end,” Jian Wushuang said with a cold smile.

“No, no!” Master Qu immediately became terrified, and his eyes were full of fear. “Jian Yi, my father is World Lord Tian Qu, and he has always doted on me. If you dare to kill me, my father will never let you go.”

“You have just said that.” Jian Wushuang sneered. He did not want to pay any attention to him at all, and his body had already floated forward.

“Jian Yi, please, let me go!”

“Whatever conditions you have, just say it. No matter what conditions you have, I will agree to them. Even if I can’t do it, I will ask my father to do it himself, as long as you are willing to let me go.”

Master Qu’s face was crazy, and he kept crying and shouting. He no longer looked like the elegant Young Master he used to be.

His heart was trembling.

Seeing this, the mockery in Jian Wushuang’s eyes became even stronger.

“I’m not interested in your conditions. Just die.” Jian Wushuang had already appeared in front of Master Qu, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand had already been brandished.

“No!”

“Jian Yi, my father will avenge me! He will!”

Young Master Qu’s roar was hysterical. As soon as his voice fell, his head was thrown away.

Looking at Young Master Qu’s body, Jian Wushuang smiled. “He is about to die, but he still used World Master Tian Qu to suppress me. He thinks I don’t dare to kill him. What a joke.”

Jian Wushuang admitted that World Master Tian Qu was indeed very strong.

This could be seen from the power of the life-saving command talisman just now.

The huge hand just now had indeed completely crushed Jian Wushuang, and Jian Wushuang had no room to fight back. He knew that he could not face World Master Tian Qu directly, but so what? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He could not face him head-on, but World Master Tian Qu did not have the ability to kill him. So what did he have to worry about?

“The Young Master of World Master Tian Qu has such a big background, so he must have a lot of treasures. Black Blood Emperor, who was just killed by me, and the four Great Divine Masters must be very rich. I’ll look for them carefully later. I’d better leave now.”

Jian Wushuang put away the interspatial rings of Young Master Qu and the others, then he flew into the void and soon disappeared.

Not long after Jian Wushuang left, two figures suddenly appeared in the void.

One was old, and the other was young. They were Chi Ming, the Young Master of the Point Star Pavilion, and the Immortal Saint who was following him.

They looked around the void. The bodies of Young Master Qu and the others had been destroyed by Jian Wushuang, but Chi Ming and the Immortal Saint still looked very strange.

“When I met Jian Yi in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I sensed that he was very strong and could even kill me easily. That’s why I stopped fighting with him. Now it seems that I was right.” Chi Ming took a deep breath, he sighed quietly.

“He killed four Divine Masters at the peak of the divine realm and Black Blood Emperor by himself. This young man is indeed very strong.” The black-robed elder nodded slightly.

After leaving the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Young Master Qu immediately brought people to chase after Jian Wushuang.

In fact, Chi Ming and the black-robed elder followed him, but they did not show up.

However, they saw everything that had just happened, including Jian Wushuang, killing the four Peak Divine Masters, killing Black Blood Emperor, surviving Young Master Qu’s strongest trump card, and finally killing Young Master Qu, they saw everything clearly.

First of all, Jian Wushuang killing the four Peak Divine Masters did not surprise them.

After all, an ordinary Invincible Divine Master could easily kill a Peak Divine Master, which meant that Jian Wushuang had the combat strength of an Invincible Divine Master.

However, it was surprising that Jian Wushuang had killed the Black Blood Emperor.

It was rare to see an Invincible Divine Master in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Every single one of them was very strong and had many skills. Under normal circumstances, unless the Immortal Saint personally killed them, it would be too difficult to kill an Invincible Divine Master, otherwise, it would be very difficult to kill an Invincible Divine Master in a one-on-one situation.

As for the Black Blood Emperor, he was not weak among Invincible Divine Masters and had already entered the second stage. His comprehension of the rules had reached the level of the Immortal Saint, so it was naturally more difficult to kill him. However, he was easily killed by Jian Wushuang.
