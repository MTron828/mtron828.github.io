Chapter 176: Taking Action

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bone Dissolving Powder was a poison which could make a person’s bones limp and numb so that he hardly wished to live. This poison would not kill, but it could cause a lot of pain and suffering.

The white-haired man had continued to drink alone during the confrontation. When threatened with the Bone Dissolving Powder, his eyes flashed with transient fear. But soon, he regained his calm.

“Hum.” Ma Qinghai snorted and looked at his son with coddling eyes again, “Changfeng, the Earthly Dragon List has changed a lot after the selection battle of Tianzong Dynasty. I bring you a new one.”

Ma Qinghai gave Ma Changfeng the updated Earthly Dragon List.

Ma Changfeng took it and leafed through it.

“Oh? The No.1 on Earthly Dragon List now is Jian Wushuang!” Ma Changfeng was a little bit surprised, “Shouldn’t it be the big monster Xue Yun? How could it be Jian Wushuang?”

“Jian Wushuang?”?The white-haired man’s expression changed subtly.

“Xue Yun has been killed by Jian Wushuang. You can read the details about the battle between him and Xue Yun,” Ma Qinghai said.

Ma Changfeng continued reading just a moment later. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“That’s impressive! He left Xue Yun no options but to swallow a Scarlet Elixir. Jian Wushuang is really something. Besides, he is also a master of Sword Principle!” Ma Changfeng clenched his hands and a scarlet light flashed in his eyes.

“Unfortunately, there are no real masters of Sword Principle in Nine Emperors Sect. The old man is the only one who is good at it, but he doesn’t teach me sincerely. Otherwise...”

“I certainly would win a place on Earthly Dragon List with my talent. It is also possible to replace Jian Wushuang as No.1 on Earthly Dragon List.”

Ma Changfeng looked over at the white-haired man with hatred.

“Jian Nantian, I heard that Jian Wushuang combined three sword essences at a young age. What do you think about his talent?” Ma Qinghai asked.

“Combined three sword essences? Not too bad.”

The white-haired man was still drinking wine and seemed indifferent. No one noticed a subtle and meaningful smile on his face,?“Combined three sword essences and the No.1 on the Earthly Dragon List, that’s pretty impressive...”

“Not too bad?” Ma Qinghai sneered, “right, his talent is pales in comparison to yours when you were young. In the battle of Qinling several years ago, you killed three purple-masked killers of Blood Feather Tower simultaneously with one move, and one of them was in the Profound of Yin Void Realm.”

“At that time, you were just in Exceptional Gold Core Realm. You were stronger than Jian Wushuang!”

“But unfortunately, your Dantian was destroyed. Such a super genius is now a good-for-nothing. Besides teaching young men swordsmanship, what else can you do?”

Hearing this, the white-haired man’s face fell.

Yes, the white-haired man was Jian Nantian, Jian Wushuang’s father...

Before, he was a super genius who had possessed immeasurable potential, just as Jian Wushuang now did. But now, Jian Nantian was in bad shape. His Dantian had been broken into pieces, so he had no Cultivation of Spiritual Power at all.

In this world where Cultivation of Spiritual Power was highly valued, he could be called a useless person.

And at this moment, Jian Wushuang and his comrades were walking towards the Nine Emperors Sect.

Five people and three Griffins were levitating above the Void, and three people rode on the three Griffins.

These eight people honorably appeared above the Void in Nine Emperors Sect (Ye Rufeng and Shui Minghao hid themselves).

Boom!

With a Golden Dragon Ambassador showing his strength in Exceptional of Yin Void Realm, the Nine Emperors Sect under the void was in turmoil.

“Who has come to Nine Emperors Sect?” A hearty laugh sounded, then five people flew out from the Nine Emperors Sect to the void.

Among the five people, one was Exceptional Yin Void Realm, two were Profound Golden Core Realms and the remaining two were Initial Gold Core Realms.

The Exceptional Yin Void Realm was middle-age and clothed in purple robes. He was the current Sect Master in Nine Emperors Sect, Qu Nan.

“Sect Master Qu, we come from Golden-dragon Palace and we seek help from Nine Emperors Sect. Would you do us a favor?”

Jian Wushuang and his friends had hatched a plan earlier. Now the Golden Dragon Ambassador who had just spoken was following the script.

“Golden Dragon Ambassador?” Qu Nan looked around and found that they all wore Golden-dragon Rings. The rings on the Yin-Yang Void Realm experts bore the sign of Golden Dragon Ambassador.

Golden-dragon Palace was a hegemon and the strongest one in Tianzong Dynasty. Plus Golden Dragon Ambassadors enjoyed high status in Golden-dragon Palace, so all sects would maintain friendly relations with them.

It certainly included the Nine Emperors Sect.

“Haha, so it is.” Qu Nan laughed, “We’d love to help you since you’ve come to us. But what we can do for you?”

“It’s a long story. If Sect Master Qu don’t mind, could we go inside and discuss the details?” the Golden Dragon Ambassador said.

“Of course, please follow me.” Qu Nan smiled and led them slowly towards the ground.

Soon they all landed.

As soon as they landed, Jian Wushuang patted his Griffin and the Griffin flew away immediately. Jian Wushuang signaled his friends with a look and all the Golden Dragon Messengers, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou took the hint.

“You guys accepted a task from Golden-dragon Palace?” Qu Nan and other experts of Nine Emperors Sect didn’t notice anything abnormal and they were still talking with the Golden Dragon Ambassadors.

They walked to the meeting hall and as soon as they stepped up the stairs...

“Action!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

Primed for action, the eight people moved immediately.

Among those five Golden Dragon Ambassadors, the two in Exceptional Yin Void Realm moved quickly and both of them targeted Qu Nan!

The three Golden Dragon Ambassadors of Profound Yin Void Realm also acted and they targeted the two Profound Yin Void Realms next to Qu Nan.

Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou jointly attacked one in Initial Yin Void Realm.

And Jian Wushuang... at this moment, he was full of murderous intent. He unsheathed Triple-kill Sword from his back, unleashing a stream of terrible sword essence towards the sky.

Light reflecting from the blade, Jian Wushuang brandished his sword with great ease. It was the First Move of Selfless Sword Technique—Idealistic Form.

Combining three sword essences and exploding his power, he headed to another one in Initial Yin Void Realm.

“What the hell?”

Facing unexpected attacks, all the powerhouses of Nine Emperors Sect were astonished.

“Oh, no!” Realizing that they had fallen prey to a plot, Qu Nan’s countenance changed immediately. In a split second, a terrible breath burst forth, but it was too late for him to unsheathe his weapon. Instead, he tried to ward off the sudden attack from the two Golden Dragon Ambassadors with his palm.

The other experts of Nine Emperors Sect also reacted immediately to fend off the sudden attacks.
