Chapter 1297: Day Dreaming!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Buzz!

A crimson reflection of the blade was like a scarlet moon that hung upside down.

The crimson reflection of the blade didn’t display overwhelming power but the moment it clashed with the Devil Stars and Moon, poof!

The blade cut through the body of the Devil Stars and Moon’s body brutally. The Devil Stars and Moon was cut into half and there was an enormous amount of divine power that spurted around.

“What?” Chu Xiao was still shocked but the crimson reflection was slamming down at him.

Bang!

Chu Xiao’s power of protection was strong. After the crimson reflection crushed the Devil Stars and Moon, it already wore down most of its strength. Hence, the rest of the power wasn’t sufficient to bring him damage.

Although Chu Xiao wasn’t injured, he was still standing there.

The surrounding inner disciples of Dayu Palace became silent.

He lost!

Everyone could tell that Chu Xiao lost.

He put his strongest unique skill to play but in the end, Universe God Qing Yang broke it easily.

“That’s all he could do?”

Universe God Qing Yang stood high in the void as he overlooked Chu Xiao. He looked extremely cold.

“Chu Xiao, now, do you admit defeat?”

Chu Xiao bit his lip and his body was shivering but he couldn’t say anything.

All these years, every time he hears someone says that the strongest Universe God in the First Heaven was Universe God Qing Yang, he was unhappy. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He thought he wouldn’t be weaker than Universe God Qing Yang but even stronger!

He had been dying to fight a face-to-face battle with Universe God Qing Yang, to be able to defeat him fair and square.

Then, he finally came to blow with Universe God Qing Yang but he never expected his opponent to be so strong and he lost in the end!

He was heavily defeated.

He could tell that Universe God Qing Yang had never put his real ability to play.

He definitely didn’t fight with his all!

“Chu Xiao, the top one in Dayu Palace. I always thought that you are the only Universe God in the First Heaven in Dayu World who could force me to fight with my all. However, from what it seems, it isn’t so.” Universe God Qing Yang shook his head and mumbled, “Soon, I will undergo the God’s Test in the Second Heaven. At first, I wanted to find a suitable opponent for me to fight with my all once before I undergo the test.”

“It’s a pity.”

“Although Dayu World is big, there isn’t any Universe God in the First Heaven that could make me fight with my all.”

Although Universe God Qing Yang didn’t speak louder, the surrounding people could hear him. Those inner disciples in Dayu Palace, including expert Universe Gods in the Second Heaven creased their eyebrows.

“That boy, it quite crazy,” the Master of Dayu Palace laughed.

“He isn’t crazy but he can’t find any opponent.” Wu Cang said coldly.

“Can’t find any opponent? There’s Jian Wushuang, isn’t it?” The Master of Dayu Palace smiled and his gaze was fixed to the corner of the vacant lot.

Not only himself and Wu Cang next to him, inner disciples and experts from Dayu Palace on the scene looked towards the same direction.

That direction was where Jian Wushuang was at.

Jian Wushuang was the one and only person that experts in Dayu World acknowledged, who could be compared favorably with or even surpassed Universe God Qing Yang.

However, when everyone looked at Jian Wushuang and saw his expression, everyone found it strange.

Under everyone’s gaze, Jian Wushuang stood there without moving an inch. His gaze looked dull and the corner of his lips lifted a weird smile.

He was obviously day dreaming!

“He, what is he doing?”

“We are having a fierce battle here. Chu Xiao and Universe God Qing Yang’s battle was extremely interesting but Jian Wushuang was day dreaming?”

“Did he turn stupid? Why would he be day dreaming at times like this? What is he doing?”

Everyone was shocked.

No one expected that Jian Wushuang would be day dreaming when Chu Xiao and Universe God Qing Yang were in a ferocious fight.

Even after the fight and when everyone looked towards him, Jian Wushuang had yet to come back to reality.

“This boy…”

The Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry.

“It seemed that within the ten years of resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game, he came to a realization. After he exited the secret room, he couldn’t wait but drown in his own thought,” Wu Cang said.

“But even if he wanted to digest the realization, doesn’t he know to look at the occasion? This boy…” The Master of Dayu Palace shook his head.

“Jian Wushuang, Jiang Wushuang!”

The inner disciple of Dayu Palace who stood next to Jian Wushuang quickly give him a push as he wasn’t responding.

Jian Wushuang then came back to reality and lifted his head subconsciously. He saw that everyone’s gaze was fixed on him.

Jian Wushuang felt embarrassed as everyone was staring at him. He scratched the back of his head and asked, “Everyone, why are you looking at me?”

The inner disciples of Dayu Palace were left speechless.

“Jian Wushuang,” the Master of Dayu Palace spoke.

“Palace Master,” Jian Wushuang answered politely.

“The earlier fight between Chu Xiao and Qing Yang was vigorous but you were day dreaming by the side?” The Master of Dayu Palace spoke in a reprimanding tone, “Jian Wushuang, you are really unconcerned and just let the matter rest.”

“Chu Xiao and Universe God Qing Yang fought?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded and he asked subconsciously, “Who won?”

Within the ten years when he resolved the Little Scattered Stars Game, he gained a lot. But because he gained a lot, he couldn’t wait to start digesting his harvest right after he exited the secret room. He never once pay attention at anything that happened outside. Even the fight between Chu Xiao and Universe God Qing Yang, he never even take a glance.

Until then only he realized that the outcome of the battle was out.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Chu Xiao looked at Jian Wushuang indeterminably and said, “Universe God Qing Yang is extremely strong. I am not his match. Among those who are cultivating below the ranking of Universe God in the Second Heaven, you might be the only who is qualified to fight against him.”

“Me?” Jian Wushuang was astounded. Then, he shook his head and replied, “Chu Xiao, even you who are the top one in Dayu Palace can’t win against him, let alone I who am only a Universe Master. How could I be his match?”

Chu Xiao heard and creased his eyebrows but he didn’t say anything else.

The inner disciples of Dayu Palace shook their head too.

That was true. Chu Xiao wasn’t even his match. Even if Jian Wushuang reveals his amazing fighting skill, he was merely a Universe Master after all.

It was obviously illogical for a Universe Master to fight against Universe God Qing Yang.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Universe God Qing Yang laughed lightly and looked towards Jian Wushuang, “Supposedly, you are only a Universe Master and I disdain to do anything with you. However, on my way here, my master told me that I have to kill you if I have a chance to!”

Universe God Qing Yang brought it up so lightly but everyone around him heard and stunned.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold and he looked at Universe God Qing Yang when he asked, “Universe God Qing Yang, what are you trying to do?”
