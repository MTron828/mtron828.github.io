Chapter 2854: Supreme Sword Intent

——

While he was conversing with Bi Yan, he did hear someone come in to report that Sword One had come to pay a visit.

At first, Bi Yan had only casually instructed Fan Xin to receive him. However, not long after, he saw Fan Xin arrive and whispered a few words into Bi Yan’s ear. Bi Yan immediately left. Not long after that… Lord Mo began to activate the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

Therefore, in Young Master Qu’s eyes, sword one was indeed suspicious.

“Sword one is from the Pill Sun Sacred World and is recognized as the number one expert in the Pill Sun Sacred World. He is only an advanced great divine master, but he is strong enough to fight against an Invincible Divine Master… this Sword One is indeed extraordinary.” Young Master Qu’s face was solemn.

While he was waiting in the main hall, he had sent people to investigate and find out some information about Jian Wushuang.

He knew Jian Wushuang’s origin and strength level.

A monster who was only an Advanced Great Divine Master but was strong enough to fight against Invincible Divine Master, of course, he did not dare to underestimate him.

Because of this, he became more suspicious of Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Bi Yan walked over.

“I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, Master Qu.” Bi Yan smiled apologetically.

“No, I didn’t wait too long either.” Master Qu did not care.

“Master Qu, I just asked my master. Unfortunately, my master just activated the Holy Heavenly Furnace and refined a special treasure. His mind has been consumed too much, so he can’t refine other treasures in a short time. Therefore, I’m afraid that your request can’t be fulfilled,” Bi Yan said.

“It doesn’t matter. Since Lord Mo’s mental energy has been consumed, as a junior, how would I dare to disturb him again?” Young Master Qu smiled slightly. “Oh right, I wonder who is so capable to actually invite Lord Mo to use the Holy Heavenly Furnace?”

“This… master has personally instructed that no one is allowed to know about this matter. Young Master Qu, if you don’t want master to personally blame you, it’s best that you don’t probe further.” Bi Yan said.

“I see. In that case, I’ll take my leave.”

Master Qu did not stay any longer and left directly.

However, even though he left, he still kept an eye on Jian Wushuang.

…

In a barren forest in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, Jian Wushuang had temporarily opened a cave mansion.

In the cave mansion, Jian Wushuang set up a restriction and then sat down cross-legged.

In front of him, the Blood Mountain Sword was floating quietly.

After this refinement, the Blood Mountain Sword had undergone tremendous changes. The most important thing was the supreme sword essence hidden in the sword type.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had sensed the existence of this sword essence in Fire Cloud Castle, but because of the occasion, he did not spend time studying it carefully.

But now, he calmed his heart and began to study it carefully.

“This sword essence is really powerful and can be used by me, provided that I can guide it out…” Jian Wushuang muttered, but he had already begun to try.

He tried to rely on his comprehension of the sword principle to communicate with this sword essence and guide it.

Under this attempt, gradually, he had a certain connection with this sword essence.

He was not surprised.

In the Fire Cloud Castle, he found that he could guide the sword essence in such a short time.

However, he could only guide a tiny bit of the sword essence.

Now, he was trying to guide more sword essence.

Time passed. Jian Wushuang had fully displayed his comprehension of sword principle and tried to guide it as much as he could.

In the blink of an eye, ten days passed.

“No, I’ve reached my limit.”

Jian Wushuang finally opened his eyes in the cave mansion. His eyes were fixed on the Blood Mountain Sword in front of him, but his expression was extremely strange.

Over the past ten days, he had tried to use all the means he could, but in the end, he was still able to guide only a few sword essences.

“If I try my best to guide the Blood Mountain Sword, I’m afraid it’s not even one-thousandth of this sword essence.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

One-thousandth, or even less.

But this was indeed the limit that Jian Wushuang could reach.

If he wanted more guidance, he would have to improve his comprehension of the sword principle.

However, even though it was only one-thousandth of the sword essence, its power was still extraordinary.

“Let’s find a place to test how strong this one-thousandth of the sword essence is.” Jian Wushuang immediately stood up and walked out of the cave mansion.

He came to the vast void and looked at the vast ancient forest in front of him. Towering trees stood in front of him.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and waved his sword in the next moment.

He did not use any swordsmanship. He just waved his sword in an ordinary way.

He did not fully utilize his divine power.

Even so, the moment he waved his sword, a crack appeared in the void in front of him. Then the towering trees in front of him fell one after another. The sword light cut dozens of trees in one go before it stopped.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was a little happy.

“Sure enough, after adding my blood essence, the power of the Blood Mountain Sword has reached the top of the third-grade holy treasure. It’s almost a second-grade holy treasure. If I use my swordsmanship, the power will be different and much stronger than before,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Just now, it was just an ordinary sword swing. I haven’t activated the sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword, but now…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light. He clenched his hands and in a flash, a terrifying sword essence burst out from the Blood Mountain Sword.

This sword essence was not very powerful, but it was extraordinary.

It was a supreme sword essence with a shocking will.

The sword essence swept across the world and all the ants in the world were turned into ants.

“This feeling…”

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword tightly and felt the sword essence burst out from the Blood Mountain Sword. In an instant, he felt as if all the people in the world were under his feet. His heart became extremely excited.

“Let’s see how much more powerful my swordsmanship has become.” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and then waved his sword forward.

Buzz!

It was also an ordinary, casual sword move that used the same divine power as the previous one. However, under the influence of the superior sword essence, a cold sword light swept out directly.

The power of this cold sword light was obviously much stronger than the previous one.

The sword light swept across. It tore through everything in its path, directly cutting apart the towering trees in front of it.

It was an ordinary and extremely casual attack. However, after slashing down hundreds of towering trees, it finally stopped.
