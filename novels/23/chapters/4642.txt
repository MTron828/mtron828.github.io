4643 The Divine Power Universe Was Defeated!

The heavens and earth wailed as the tragic explosion destroyed the battlefield. Everything was destroyed.

The entire sky was devoured by the extremely bright light produced by the explosion, and even Devouring Emperor subconsciously covered his face.

This indescribable extreme brightness lasted for nearly half a cup of tea’s time.

Without waiting for the dazzling polar day to dissipate, Devouring Emperor hurriedly looked at the center of the explosion. However, there were no remains or broken arms except for the void.

“Where are the two of them?” Devouring Emperor asked in a deep voice while his endless power pressed down on Void God.

Void God did not show any weakness. His peak void power rose. “Do you think that I can’t kill him by myself?”

Suppressing his anger and urge to kill Void God, Devouring Emperor moved his body to the center of the explosion to check.

“Impossible! Did he really die?” Devouring Emperor was shocked, but Void God’s attack was too terrifying. Old Master was also seriously injured by the attack, so it was hard for him to survive.

Thinking of this, Devouring Emperor suppressed the anger and suspicion in his heart. He did not even look at Void God, but looked down.

There was an army of nearly three million cultivators from the Divine Power Universes there.

“I don’t care if he’s dead or not. The ones who should die now are you ants!” Devouring Emperor was like the real decision-maker. He passed Void God and gave the order, “Kill them all. Leave no one alive!”

The army of Void Warriors hesitated for a moment, then under the leadership of several Half Ancestors of the Devourers, they rushed toward the Divine Power Universe army.

Taking a deep breath, Void God said in a low voice, “Devouring Emperor, you’ve crossed the line.”

When Devouring Emperor heard this, he sneered. “It’s just an order from a universe, and you’re so concerned about it? Don’t you forget your promise.”

Hatred flashed in the depths of his eyes. Void God did not speak again. He controlled the Demon God ancestral phantom form behind him to attack the Divine Power Universe army! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jian Wushuang and the only Ancestor realm expert in the Divine Power Universe had died. All the cultivators in the Divine Power Universe looked at the scene in shock.

Without Jian Wushuang, who had entered the Sword Dao with his own body and swept through the army of Void Warriors as if he had entered no man’s land, all the cultivators almost instantly lost their benchmark and hope.

The terrifying ancestral Demon God’s phantom image had wiped out an army of over 200,000 cultivators and countless Supreme realm experts.

The Golden Crow clan, the Great Void Temple, and all the disciples of the Nine Emperor Pavilion who had come to help had all died! Not a single one survived!

Just as Supreme Zi Fa and Supreme Hong’er were about to die, they looked at the place where Jian Wushuang had died with a smile in their eyes. After gently muttering ‘Take care, my Young Friend’, they calmly met their deaths.

The Starry Sky Sword Sect’s foundation had been destroyed, leaving only Wu Jianxian and a few others who barely managed to escape the disaster.

The Dragon, Phoenix, and Qilin clans were also severely injured.

After Emperor Devourer joined the massacre, the great army of the Divine Power Universe was annihilated.

Even a Half Ancestor would not be able to put up any resistance.

Leng Rushuang’s face was pale as she looked at the destructive aura calmly.

Swish-

A Phoenix extended its huge wings and blocked Leng Rushuang’s path, as well as the aftermath of the Ancestor realm attack.

Feng Qi let out a miserable cry, and her original Phoenix form was extinguished. She turned back into his human form and fell down.

Leng Rushuang hurriedly reached out to catch Feng Qi. The left half of Feng Qi’s body was broken and bleeding.

“Matriarch!” More than 200 phoenixes tried to save Feng Qi, but they were all killed by Devouring Emperor with a wave of his hand!

Out of the three-million-strong cultivator army, only a million remained.

The Void Universe went completely crazy. Every Void Warrior was like a bloodthirsty demon, rapidly consuming the life of the Divine Power Universe.

Supreme Xue Bo seemed to have aged ten times in an instant as he watched this battle, which was almost certain to end. The words that were most difficult to say were finally uttered.

“All soldiers of the Divine Power Universe, retreat. Save the Last Flame for the last time.”

Every cultivator’s face was deathly pale. After this defeat, the Divine Power Universe would be completely destroyed. No one would be able to stop the Void Universe.

“Leave this place to me.” Supreme Xue Bo’s long robe fluttered in the wind. There was no fear on his face, only indifference after seeing through the profound meaning of life.

One of the Snowflake Swords had been shattered. The old beggar poured the last mouthful of wine into his throat with a slightly tipsy face and entered the Half Ancestor realm.

He, who had been silent and wandering his entire life, had finally gained Enlightenment in this final battle.

A brilliant and majestic Half Ancestor divine power emerged, and the old beggar dressed as a sloppy Daoist disappeared. In his place was a young swordsman with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes.

“The Divine Power Universe can’t be left without guidance. I’ll leave that to you.” The old beggar who looked like a young swordsman laughed. “I’ve lived for so long. It’s time to find a place to rest.”

The blood-stained Dragon Emperor Linhe also stepped forward and said, “Leave this place to us. Elder Xue Bo, please take good care of the Divine Power Universe.”

Long Yan and Long Chi held back Supreme Xue Bo. “Let’s go.”

An unparalleled void power descended, and the old beggar laughed out loud. An unruly swordsman in green robes transformed his body into Sword Intent, and like a long river, he rose against the heavens.

The old beggar had sacrificed himself to destroy Void God’s attack.

The Sword Intent dissipated like a star waterfall, and the Divine Power Universe also lost a Half Ancestor expert.

Under the old beggar’s attack, all the Void Masters who had crossed the sword waterfall were killed. Even the Half Ancestors had to avoid the attack, buying time for the Divine Power Universe army to retreat.

At this moment, the Dragon Emperor Linhe was the only one left on the shattered battlefield. He stood firmly in the distance.

Looking at the cultivator who was only at the peak of the Half Ancestor realm, without thinking, Devouring Emperor unleashed a palm strike to kill him.

However, the descending palm strike could not move an inch forward.

Devouring Emperor’s eyes narrowed, and a terrifying aura surged.

A white bone dragon claw grabbed Devouring Emperor’s palm attack and tore it into pieces.

Each bone was as large as a Star Field, and they emerged from Dragon Emperor Linhe’s body.

The sun-like eye sockets shot out a majestic light.

Dragon Emperor Linhe’s expression was calm, but his clear eyes were gradually turning cloudy.

He transformed into his scarlet Natal Ancestral Dragon. The two giant Dragons, one gold and one bone, became the last line of defense and defended this place to the death.

The First Generation of the Dragon clan’s Ancestral Dragon, as well as the Dragon Emperor, had both fallen on the Offworld Battlefield.

Devouring Emperor and Void God were injured, and the army of the Void Universe had lost nearly 800,000 soldiers.

Countless corpses filled the void that had turned into nothingness again, and countless divine blood and broken pieces of magic treasures gathered to form a winding river.

This battle of catastrophe was far from over. No one knew when it would end, but it would definitely end with the complete destruction of a universe.
