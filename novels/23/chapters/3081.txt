Chapter 3082: Xiong Tao

After coming out of the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm, Jian Wushuang had already noticed that there was someone following behind him. However, this person had not shown up, so Jian Wushuang did not alarm him.

And now, this person, Xiong Tao, had finally shown up.

“Bai Xiao and the others call you senior brother. Does that mean that you are also from the Dao Palace?” Jian wushuang looked at Xiong Tao.

“Yes.” Xiong Tao nodded.

“Mr. Heaven Marquis.” Bai Xiao immediately said, “Senior Brother Xiong Tao is the strongest rank one True Saint in our Dao Palace. Even in the entire Dao Palace, his talent is one of the best.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression could not help but change.

The Dao Palace was full of monsters.

There were probably many monsters at the rank one True Saint level, but Xiong Tao was called the strongest. His talent and strength were naturally outstanding.

Jian Wushuang was indeed not interested in ordinary geniuses.

Not to mention Duan Yu, even Mountain King, the evil master, and the others whom he had met in the white bone region could not stir up any emotions in his heart.

However, the appearance of Xiong Tao made Jian Wushuang a little interested.

“Do you want to fight with me?” Jian Wushuang looked at Xiong Tao calmly.

“Originally is not much interest, but just saw you a sword defeated Duan Yu, that swordsmanship makes my eyes light up, so I just show up.” Xiong Tao said.

“In that case, let’s do it. I also want to know how strong the strongest first rank True Saint is in Dao Palace.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“I won’t let you down.” As Xiong Tao spoke, he slowly lowered his arms, which he had been hugging the whole time. Then, with a flip of his palm, a three-meter-long golden long rod appeared in his hand. At the same time, a faint murderous aura appeared, also slowly rose from the body of Xiong Tao.

“Brother Xiong Tao, it’s time to make a move!”

Previously, they were worried that Xiong Tao might not want to fight Jian Wushuang, but now it seemed that they were overthinking.

Of course, this was all thanks to Duan Yu. If Duan Yu had not shown Jian Wushuang some strength, Xiong Tao would not have been interested in Jian Wushuang.

Seeing Xiong Tao take out his magic weapon, Jian Wushuang also took out the Blood Mountain Sword. A divine power aura also swept out from his body.

“Be careful.”

Xiong Tao reminded him, but his body suddenly moved.

It was fine if he did not move, but when he moved, Boom!

The fierce aura from Xiong Tao suddenly increased by dozens, hundreds of times!

Jian Wushuang felt that it was not a human cultivator but a living ancient beast that was charging at him!

It was the first time Jian Wushuang had seen such a strong murderous aura.

Whoosh!

Xiong Tao appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. He held the golden long stick with both hands, and the brutal power surged into the long stick.

“Boom!”

Boom!

A violent boom sounded, as if the mountain was collapsing and the earth was cracking.

The golden stick shadow formed by the golden long stick smashed toward Jian Wushuang’s head in a vast and mighty manner.

The stick shadow had not arrived yet, but the power coming from the long stick made Jian Wushuang raise his head involuntarily.

“Not bad. Just from this stick alone, it seems to be much more powerful than the three original palace geniuses I met in the White Bone Region.” Jian Wushuang smiled and suddenly swung his right arm, an equally shocking evil aura suddenly swept across.

Roar!

A deep, angry roar suddenly came from the heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang also swung his sword, but the instant he did so, the sword light directly turned into a complete and huge ancient exotic beast.

This ancient exotic beast was extremely ferocious, and its evil aura soared to the sky. It carried a shocking power as it directly attacked the golden staff shadow.

Bang!

A loud sound shook the heaven and earth.

The divine power formed a series of shock waves that crazily swept in all directions.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao were both sent flying at the same time.

“An absolute art at the peak of rank four?” Xiong Tao stared at Jian Wushuang with a gleam in his eyes.

“Haha, isn’t yours the same?” Jian Wushuang laughed heartily.

When the two exchanged blows, both sides could see that the other party was using an absolute art at the peak of rank four, and both were proficient in strength and power.

Even their first exchange of divine power was about the same, so the result of this collision was surprisingly equal.

“Humph!”

With a cold snort, Xiong Tao stepped forward again.

“Golden snake stick!”

Whoosh!

A stick shadow, like a long golden snake, suddenly darted toward Jian Wushuang’s chest.

Jian Wushuang waved his arm, and the blood mountain sword directly chopped at the center of the long golden snake. However, the long golden snake strangely swayed and swept toward Jian Wushuang’s head again.

“Interesting!”

Jian Wushuang also immediately moved to block it.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! ~ ~ ~ ~

A low collision sound in the void one after another sounded, the two of the rules of understanding are extremely high, speed, movement are also extremely good.

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was very strong, but Xiong Tao’s stick skill was not weak either.

This exchange reached a white-hot stage in an instant.

In the blink of an eye, the two men have confronted each other no less than dozens of times.

“My golden snake staff is like a snake. My soul is incomparably fast, but this person is actually able to keep up with my speed and block all of my staff techniques.” Xiong Tao’s gaze turned cold. He was still using the golden snake staff, but at the same time, the strength in his hands began to increase.

That’s right, from the start, Xiong Tao had been holding back his strength.

He had only used the power of the divine power king, an ordinary rank one True Saint. However, for a super genius like him, the power of his divine power had long surpassed that of his peers.

Previously, he had only wanted to rely on his staff skill to defeat Jian Wushuang. However, when he realized that he could not do so, he naturally wanted to use his advantage in the power of his divine power.

Boom! Boom!

The same staff shadow was used, but as Xiong Tao used more divine power, the staff shadow became stronger!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

They fought again and again, but the two sides were still evenly matched.

“I have used nearly 20% of my strength, but I still don’t have the slightest advantage?” Xiong Tao frowned slightly, but the strength in his hands continued to increase. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

30%!

40%!

In just a short moment, Xiong Tao had already used 50% of his strength.

His 50% strength was already above the divine power of a peak-stage rank 2 True Saint, but in the end..

“He still doesn’t have the slightest advantage. While I’m constantly increasing my strength, he’s also increasing his own strength.” Xiong Tao’s eyes carried a trace of shock.

After a long while, he finally did not hold back at all.

Bang!

A terrifying divine might suddenly erupted. Xiong Tao’s divine power, which was far more tyrannical than that of his peers, finally completely erupted.
