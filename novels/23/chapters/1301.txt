Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the middle of the training field, Jian Wushuang and Universe God Qing Yang were standing opposite one another.

The universe was in silence.

The surrounding people held their breath as they watched the battle.

The Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand, while the black sickle had appeared in Universe God Qing Yang’s hand. The desire to fight soared in both their eyes.

“I have been looking forward to this battle,” Jian Wushuang pointed at his opponent with the tip of his blade, “Universe God Qing Yang, I hope you don’t disappoint me.”

“I will grant your wish,” Universe God Qing Yang lifted the corner of his lips and smiled coldly as he thought to himself, “This battle, I must bring all my skills into play, but I can’t kill Jian Wushuang straightaway, right at the beginning. I have to do it slowly.”

Then, Universe God Qing Yang partially reined in his divine power on purpose. He then took action before everyone’s gaze.

From a far off distance, Universe God Qing Yang gripped the black sickle and swung.

Buzz!

The shadow of the huge blade suddenly unveiled the effect of its divine power. It formed a beautiful, mighty river of surging blades.

The blade river was crimson and it looked extremely beautiful in the void.

“Such a strong stroke!”

“So exquisite!”

“He just performed such an exquisite stroke so casually?”

The surrounding spectators saw the crimson blade river and showed terrified expressions.

They could tell that the stroke that Universe God Qing Yang did was very exquisite.

Looking at the crimson blade river surging towards him, Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows slightly.

“He intentionally suppressed his divine power and wanted to defeat me with unique skill techniques?” Jian Wushuang snorted.

Regardless of how luxurious the river blade was, Jian Wushuang found the power ordinary. It was obvious that Universe God Qing Yang had the ability to control his divine power.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang spat one word lightly, with a calm expression. At the same time, he waved the Blood Mountain Sword downwards casually.

With a casual stroke, Jian Wushuang didn’t even use any swordsmanship. But the sword light swung out and directly cut the beautiful blade river that was approaching him in half. The surging, divine power collapsed and dispersed into all four directions.

“Huh?” Universe God Qing Yang’s expression changed.

He never expected that Jian Wushuang could resolve that stroke so easily.

“Universe God Qing Yang, “Jian Wushuang spoke with a loud and bright voice, “Don’t hide, bring your all. Otherwise, it would be meaningless even if I defeat you.”

“In a year, your power increased this tremendously compared to before?” Universe God Qing Yang smirked, “If so, I shall grant you your wish then.”

Just as he finished speaking, rumble, there was a vast expanse of aura that surged from Universe God Qing Yang which was obviously much stronger than before.

Then, Universe God Qing Yang took action again. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Buzz.

The same beautiful surging blade river swept out, but the difference was that the crimson blade river contained a significantly stronger divine power.

“Dragon Lightning!”

Universe God Qing Yang roared and wielded the sickle in his hand. In the crimson blade river was an enormous amount of divine power surging fiercely. Suddenly, it took the shape of a humungous blood dragon. The blood dragon had five claws and it was huge in size. After it took shape, it roared and it flowed towards Jian Wushuang in the form of flowing a crimson current.

Jian Wushuang saw, then he took a huge stride forward and swung the Blood Mountain Sword at the void before him.

That stroke stabbed right at the throat of the blood dragon that was attacking with such swift action. A terrifying, strangling power burst out and the blood dragon was suddenly torn into pieces.

Universe God Qing Yang watched as the blood dragon collapsed. He couldn’t be bothered. His gaze was cold and tremendous divine power surged, then he shouted again.

“Thousand Dragons Lightning!”

Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!

Countless roars were suddenly heard across the universe. Among the huge crimson blade river, boundless divine power formed one blood dragon one after another. All the blood dragons had five claws and were all huge in size. The power didn’t seem to be any weaker compared to the blood dragon before.

He looked and there were countless thousands of blood dragon that appeared from the crimson blade river.

The blood dragons plunged towards Jian Wushuang from all directions with great momentum.

Everyone who was watching showed terror in their eyes at the sight.

They could tell that every blood dragon from the blade river equaled a full blow of a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven. There were more than a thousand of them charging towards Jian Wushuang and it was like more than a thousand attacks from a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven.

It was reckoned that there weren’t many who could endure such a terrifying move among Universe Gods in the First Heaven.

Looking at the blood dragons charging from all directions, Jian Wushuang didn’t seem anxious at all. He stood there with his hand holding onto his sword as his Soul Power diffused. He looked at all the attacks hemming him in and he took action.

Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

There were cold and brutal sword lights that swung out and Jian Wushuang expelled them rather casually. However, after it was sent out from the Blood Mountain Sword, every single stroke was like a full blow of a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven, and even slightly stronger.

His swordsmanship was swift and it easily dismissed the blood dragons.

The blood dragons collapsed one after another. The dispersed divine power became an impactful force and spread all around insanely.

“Boring.”

Jian Wushuang who was in the middle of the training field sighed and his gaze turned cold.

Wow!

A sword light with a string of boundless vigor and hope suddenly appeared from nowhere, it was the unique skill that Jian Wushuang created, Nirvana.

After cultivating for a year, Jian Wushuang had a brand new foundation of understanding towards swordsmanship. Nirvana was enhanced again and it could be considered the top peak rank one unique skill.

The terrifying sword light gave out earth-shattering power. Suddenly, it shattered all the blood dragons before him along the crimson blade river that filled the void. He broke a walkway in the crimson blade river.

That very moment, Jian Wushuang was holding his imposing gaze. Then, his body turned illusionary and he appeared before Universe God Qing Yang via the walkway that he broke earlier.

“Chant of Disturbance”

Jian Wushuang swung his stroke like a flash of lighting.

The blade whistled and reverberated, and it was an extremely shrill noise.

The sword light affected the space and was aimed at Universe God Qing Yang when it hit. At the instant that the blade whistled, a terrifying Soul Attack landed a heavy hit on Universe God Qing Yang.

Although Universe God Qing Yang was strong, the sudden Soul Attack made his face change.

Under the effect of Soul Attack, a terrifying swordsmanship was reigning down!
