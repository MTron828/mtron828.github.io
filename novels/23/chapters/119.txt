Chapter 120: The Line Between Death and Life

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Chuu!

A cold black light rushed toward Jian Wushuang as a terrifying aura directly locked onto him.

Naturally, it was from the second purple-masked assassin.

This purple-masked assassin had been hiding in the dark. He did not intend to show himself, but he never expected that things would go this way.

Two teams of the Blood Shadow had joined the fight. Jian Wushuang killed four of them in only a moment, but the Blood Shadow teams had not even managed to touch his shadow.

Then the first purple-masked assassin had fought against Jian Wushuang in person. The result was that he was defeated and sprawled out in a huge hole near Jian Wushuang. It was even uncertain whether he was alive or dead.

He had no choice but to show himself.

“One more? Get lost!” Jian Wushuang roared and angerly hacked his Triple-kill Sword toward the second purple-masked assassin with a steam of scorching and fiery sword essence of Raging Fire.

Sword Skill of Blood and Fire, the sixth move!

That cold black light also rushed toward the second purple-masked assassin.

BANG!

Jian Wushuang could not help stumbling back several steps, as did the purple-masked assassin.

“The strength of the second purple-masked assassin is much stronger than that of the first one.” Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

Warriors of the Gold Core Realm had differences between strong and weak, so did warriors of the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

The same situation was true for those purple-masked assassins. The second purple-masked assassin’s strength was much stronger than that of the first purple-masked assassin who was pulverized by Jian Wushuang.

“Go to hell!”

Again, that purple-masked assassin stabbed out ferociously with his black dagger.

It seemed that the stab could pierce through the heavens, and a cacophony resounded through the Void.

“Ridiculous.” With a sneer, Jian Wushuang waved his Triple-kill Sword and slashed out directly with a strong burst of Sword Essence of Gale.

But the speed of his sword was faster than that of the black dagger in the purple-masked assassin’s hand.

Clang!

The sparks made by the clashing of the two blades was very showy in the night sky.

Jian Wushuang moved his wrist and the long sword flexibly bypassed the black dagger. Then, while radiating Sword Essence of Earth, he hacked out his sword.

Obviously, the purple-masked assassin was battle-hardened. Without any panic, he waved his black dagger forward angrily.

BANG!

With another low and deep sound, the heavy and vast Sword Essence of Earth released a huge amount of power. In addition, the power released from the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, executed by Jian Wushuang, far exceeded that of common warriors in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. As these two huge powers contained in the Jian Wushuang’s sword move crashed against that black dagger, the purple-masked assassin became nervous.

However, in the place where two sword edges clashed, a wave-like essence spread out.

This wave was the impact force from the clash between the two blades. And, although it was not worth mentioning to Jian Wushuang and that purple-masked assassin, the blast wave generated right in front of the purple-masked assassin, so it naturally reached his face first.

Bang!

As soon as the blast wave struck that assassin’s purple mask, this wicked and frightening purple mask cracked directly in front of everyone.

When the mask cracked and broke away from his face, a pretty and refined face appeared, but this face was hideous at this moment.

“It’s you!” When Jian Wushuang saw this face, a sharp light suddenly flashed in his eyes.

Most warriors of the Gold Core Realm near Quiet Moon Lake also saw this face, and some of them recognized him with a single glance.

“It’s him!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Lin Yun. it’s Lord Lin Yun!”

“It it really Lord Lin Yun?”

“Lin Yun, the governor of Blizzard City?”

Many warriors of the Gold Core Realm who recognized his face felt it was unbelievable.

“Lin Yun, it’s you!” Jian Wushuang was surprised too.

He happened to have met Lin Yun once at the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace in Moon Heart City. At that time, Lin Yun gave people the impression of gentleness, elegance, and courtesy. With such a good reputation, he seemed to be a good person, one-hundred-percent.

Nearly everyone who knew Lin Yun respected him very much.

But who could have thought that such a good person was a purple-masked assassin from Blood Feather Tower?

“You hid so deeply!” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s face was hideous instead of gentle.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun cursed secretly in his heart.

The reason why he did not show himself before was that he was afraid of exposing his identity. He did not intend to appear and help kill Jian Wushuang unless he had no choice.

But he had never thought the battle strength which Jian Wushuang released would be so strong.

Now, his identity was exposed in front of so many people. Regardless of whether he killed Jian Wushuang or not today, he no longer had a place to return to in the Tianzong Dynasty.

Because, regardless of the risks, Dragon Palace would kill him!

“Now that my identity has been exposed, I just need to focus on killing him first.” Lin Yun’s eyes were full of killing intent. Then, a moment later, a lavender long spear appeared in his hand.

This long spear was his real weapon.

He only used the black dagger to hide his identity.

“Go to hell!”

Lin Yun instantly made his move, his body appearing in front of Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye, as he directly thrust out his lavender long spear.

Without any sound, this stab was just like a flickering serpent’s tongue.

Jian Wushuang only felt his body was locked in place. When this silent spear stabbed towards him, he had no way to avoid it at all.

“Essence of the Waterdrop. Has Lin Yun’s comprehension in Essence of the Waterdrop reached such a high level?” Jian Wushuang was frightened.

Just now, when Lin Yun used that black dagger to attack, he employed Essence of Gale. Although his comprehension was rather high, Jian Wushuang could handle it. But now Lin Yun was using the long spear with Essence of the Waterdrop…which was terrible.

“This spear can absolutely pass the eleventh level of the Dragon Gate easily. It was even close to the twelfth level.”

Jian Wushuang instantly executed the Reincarnation Sword Art in an attempt to block this move. Although he turned back one spear, with another burst of strength, Lin Yun’s spear shadows rushed towards Jian Wushuang successively, one by one.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Jian Wushuang did his utmost to fight against Lin Yun, but in his heart he had already lost the intent to fight.

After all, what he had executed was the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill!

The Soul-Devouring Secret Skill was terrifying, but it was a unique skill that came with a price. Using it caused great damage to himself as well as his opponent. Therefore, Jian Wushuang could not last much longer. The sharp pain in his body meant that he had reached the limit. Not only that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were red and tendons stood out on his forehead. Obviously, he was very close to his breaking point.

Boom!

A vast sword shadow directly pushed Lin Yun back, then Jian Wushuang turned around and ran away.

“RUN! RUN! RUN!” Jian Wushuang was crazily roaring in his heart.

However, the direction he ran was exactly towards the area where Su Rou and the gold-masked assassins stood.

“Third brother,” Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang with concern on her face.

Jian Wushuang was exhausted both mentally and physically, but when he saw six living gold-masked assassins directly ahead of him, the killing intent in his eyes was rapidly increased again.
