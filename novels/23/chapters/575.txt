Chapter 576: Nine Origin Marks

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

What a terrifying improvement!

It only took him a little while for his body to become much stronger than before.

Finally, it stopped.

His body had reached its limit, so it was impossible for him to improve any more.

Unless he made a breakthrough in Realm, his body would no longer be able to be enhanced.

“This is my body’s limit.”

He clenched his right hand and felt how powerful he was.

Now that his body had reached the limit of Venerable Master, a great change had happened.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was astounded.

He looked at his own arms in terror.

He originally had eight World Origin Marks and Slaughter Origin Marks on his arms, but right now a stream of World Origin and Slaughter Origin was gathering on his arms.

Jian Wushuang was familiar with what was happening.

“Origin Mark, the ninth Origin Mark!”

“Is it finally happening?”

A gush of delight flashed in his eyes.

He had comprehended the Origin to a superior level and had even achieved the Slaughter Dao, but he only had eight Origin Marks and had been stuck at the level of Venerable Master, which did not make sense.

“I finally understand why I had not made a breakthrough. It’s because my body had not reached its limit.”

Jian Wushuang cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill. When he was at the level of Venerable Master, the biggest difference between him and normal warriors was his body.

His powerful body had slowly been enhancing.

The reason he could not bypass his bottleneck was that his body had not reached its limit.

Now, aided by the Enhanced Magic Thunderbolt, his body had reached its limit, so he naturally made a breakthrough.

A ninth Origin Mark condensed on each arm.

Both sets of Origin Marks, World Origin and Slaughter Origin, amounted to nine.

“In that case, I can reach Flying to the Ninth Heaven!”

Jian Wushuang was ecstatic about it. The moment the ninth Origin Marks condensed, he felt his bottleneck starting to shake.

He had waited for it for so long.

Boom... He began to make a breakthrough!

It went smoothly. As soon as he made the attempt, his bottleneck easily began to collapse and a mighty Spiritual Power surged through him as a terrifying aura suddenly radiated from his body.

The gush of terrifying aura was the result of reaching the level of Flying to the Ninth Heaven.

At some point, the towering Golden Sword Soul Phantom had appeared behind his back. The instant Jian Wushuang made his breakthrough, the Golden Sword Soul Phantom’s size soared as well.

In an instant, the sky had darkened.

It was a sunny day. The Holy Place had become empty because many experts had headed for the North Camp. At that moment, a terrifying aura, like the awakening of a Calamity Beast that had slept for eons surged out from the bottom of the Earth Core Palace.

Boom... The whole area began to shake.

The clouds began to dissipate and the wind was becoming turbulent as a terrifying storm formed in the sky.

Then, a towering golden phantom rose from the ground as a Supreme Sword Essence suddenly erupted, accompanied by a terrifying aura that seemed to be able to shake the world.

Both the stream of Sword Essence and aura were too overwhelming.

Some of the Divine Generals who remained in the Holy Place sensed it and raised their heads in terror.

In the North Camp, numerous human experts and Demonic Beasts were keeping their eyes on each other.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor sat on his throne while tapping on the armrest.

“Temple Master Black Spirit, time is running out,” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor said in a low voice.

Temple Master Black Spirit glanced at him but gave no response.

At this moment, everyone in the area sensed a terrifying Sword Essence and aura emanating from afar.

“What?”

All of them were dumbstruck.

They knew the Sword Essence and aura were far from them, but they still felt it.

“What happened?”

“What on earth is releasing this Sword Essence and aura?”

“The Holy Place, both of them are coming from the Holy Place.” A loud voice suddenly rang out among the camp.

“What?” It caused a commotion among the human camp.

The Holy Place was quite distant from the North Camp. However, they could feel the Sword Essence and aura from the Holy Place even though they were in the North Camp.

Was this a joke?

This, this is? The Human Temple Masters were stunned.

They had received news that something was happening at the Holy Place. Now this Sword Essence and aura was erupting from the bottom of the Earth Core Palace.

Even Crystal-armored Monster Emperor could not help but stand up and looked in the direction of the Holy Place.

He was not clear about what happened, but he had a grim sense of foreboding.

“It’s coming from the bottom of the Earth Core Palace. There is only one person remaining in the Earth Core Palace that might be able to cause this.” Temple Master Black Spirit wore a grim expression while looking in the direction of the Holy Place. “Jian Wushuang!”

It even shook the Demonic Beasts in the Monster Territory.

There was a peaceful valley deep in the Monster Territory.

Only a huge black castle was built there. Inside the dark palace, a gray-robed middle-age man suddenly raised his head.

“Flying to the Ninth Heaven... Little boy, you’ve reached it faster than I expected,” he said with a faint smile on his face.

“Since that’s the case, it’s time to meet him.”
