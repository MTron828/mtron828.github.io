Chapter 2564: Sword Principle Training

After Jian Wushuang left, emotions began to stir in the void.

The Green Flame Prefecture Governor shouted, “Damn it! He’s got some guts to ask for five hundred Primordial Stones!”

The Mysterious Shade Prefecture Governor furiously said, “This Jian Yi is obviously asking for a lot. No, this is clearly robbery!”

“Yes, he’s robbing us but even then what can we do?” The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor seemed rather calm. “Gentlemen, don’t forget who we are. We are thieves, too and robbing is our business. The only thing is that our positions have been switched with him and it’s Jian Yi who’s robbing us now. Not to mention, he possesses the capacity to do so.”

The two governors fell silent. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

They immediately recalled the moment Jian Wushuang’s burst out with energy and severely injured them with a single sword stroke.

Without a doubt, Jian Wushuang did possess the ability to destroy the Fifteen Prefectures all by himself.

Everybody must yield before absolute strength.

Normally, the Fifteen Prefectures were not afraid of the Northern Darkstar Continent’s large clans. They were not even too fearful of top-tier clans such as Shi, Wu, and Situ clans.

However, they would never have the nerve to cross the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

That was because the Territorial Lord possessed the powers to absolutely crushed them.

Jian Wushuang’s ability may be slightly lower than the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, but it was not too far behind.

The Fifteen Prefectures could only swallow their pride when faced against experts with an Earth Ultimate God’s battle strength.

“Infernal Heart Governor, do you mean that we’ll have to pay up?” The Green Flame Prefecture Governor trembled.

“Do you have a better idea?” The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor looked at him.

The other two governors exchanged a look before helplessly shook their heads.

...

After leaving the Infernal Heart Prefecture, Jian Wushuang glided through the void alone with a slight smile on his face.

“I was slightly hesitant when taking action on the Northern Darkstar Continent clans as they never crossed me after all. However, I didn’t have to worry so much about the Eighteen Prefecture bunch of thieves who go around robbing people and causing nothing but trouble. I’m not even going too far if I were to kill all of them, hence asking for five hundred thousand Primordial Stones is already rather merciful on my part.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

500,000 Primordial Stones was truly a big number. However, the Eighteen Prefectures had been dominating the Dark Thunder Territory for so many years and surely had accumulated an incredible amount of treasures.

The three prefectures that he previously annihilated were the weakest ones. Even then, he managed to obtain 90,000 Primordial Stones from them and other treasures that were worth even more.

Infernal Heart, Green Flame, and Mysterious Shade prefectures’ possessions must surely be extraordinary since they have Peak Ultimate Gods on their helm. Perhaps it would not be difficult for each of them to pay 100,000 pieces while the rest could be split among the other prefectures without exactly costing them an arm and a leg.

Jian Wushuang did of course think of annihilating the Fifteen Prefectures as well. However, that did not guarantee the peacefulness of Dark Thunder Territory. On the contrary, it would become even more chaotic as countless thievery powers would begin to fight for their chances and new powers would emerge in different corners at the end. That much was for certain.

Besides, it was too radical of a movement if he destroyed all 15 prefectures in one go as the many clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent would definitely receive the news immediately and the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord would definitely notice him.

He had not developed his Sword World yet, hence he was not confident to be able to defeat or kill the Territorial Lord. Therefore, it would be best not to catch the Territorial Lord’s attention.

“I’m not extremely close to developing the Sword World. I have no other ways but to find other opportunities. I’ll be wandering around in the Dark Thunder Territory in the days to come while continuing to study and cultivate. I’ll also use the thieves around to train my sword principle and techniques.” Jian Wushuang smiled and made a decision.

He needed to upgrade his sword principle.

His sword skills as well.

He previously spent most of his time raising his law awareness and sword principle while in seclusion without inventing better sword techniques.

The Space-time and Transmigration sword techniques could both use an upgrade.

It would be best to spar with an opponent so that he could keep experimenting to upgrade those sword techniques. Dark Thunder Territory’s thieves and criminals had naturally become his main targets.

Even though their abilities were weak and posed no threat to him, it was more than enough for him to train his sword techniques.

Jian Wushuang moved his figure at that moment and the golden robe—Golden Glass Armor—he wore was kept inside the Interspatial Ring only to be replaced by a normal black robe.

His was too infamous in the Dark Thunder Territory such that everybody knew he wore a golden robe and carried a longsword on his back. The thieves in the territory would most probably not get close if they saw him. Therefore, he slightly changed his image by wearing a black robe instead.

Besides that, he stopped using the black stone to cover up his divine power breath and instead let out his Primary Stage Ultimate God’s divine power breath.

A black-robed man who was carrying a longsword on his back and projecting a Primary Stage Ultimate God’s divine power breath would make those thieves let their guard down and attack him without hesitation. He could then use them as his training mates.

After putting on his disguise, Jian Wushuang began to wander freely in the Dark Thunder Territory.

His wandering had very soon caught the eye of various thieves around. Furthermore, the number of thieves in the central area was great and quite capable. They need not worry too much about the Primary Stage Ultimate God Jian Wushuang.

Not long after, a band of thieves came up to him.

“Hey kid, give us all the treasures in your Interspatial Ring and we’ll probably let you live. Otherwise, die!” The leader—a muscular man holding a huge axe—fiercely stared at Jian Wushuang while the remaining thieves surrounded Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang began to smile demonically upon looking at that sight.

“I’ll start with all of you.”

Jian Wushuang moved.

He could suppress his divine power or unleash it to the Primary Stage Ultimate God level with many Primary Stage Ultimate Gods not even as strong in comparison to himself. He had also held back a great deal of his law understanding by using only his sword skills and relying on his sword principle understanding before starting an intense fight with the thieves.

There were a total of three Primary Stage Ultimate God among the thieves with the rest of them being powerful Divine Demons.

Even then, the band of thieves was still being completely defeated by him after a round of battle with most either dead or escaped.

Jian Wushuang did not pursue them and continued wandering around.
