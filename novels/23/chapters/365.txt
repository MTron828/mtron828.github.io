Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Hua!”

Within the brilliant sword light, there was vast killing intent.

Fourth Holy Master was still violently retreating. Facing against the brilliant sword slashed from Jian Wushuang, he had no ability to resist at all.

The sword light inexorably swept over Fourth Holy Master, whose eyes were filled with a thick unwillingness. Yet, his breath still began to dissipate.

“Fourth Brother!” First Holy Master turned pale with fear.

However, Jian Wushang’s figure flickered once again, like a ghost, then stopped in front of the cold woman.

Having personally witnessed the scene of Fourth Holy Master being beheaded by Jian Wushuang with a single sword move, her face suddenly turned pale when Jian Wushuang appeared in front of her, following which her eyes became crazy.

“Die!”

The cold woman clenched her teeth tightly. The black dagger in her hand, which was coated with a virulent toxin, turned into a dark gleam, piercing violently through the air. With this attack, the cold woman was using all of her strength.

This was the most powerful attack she could display.

However, Jian Wushuang casually swung his sword.

The sword light and the black dagger collided head-on, causing the two mighty forces to burst out at the same time.

Clang!

A low and heavy crashing noise was heard. The cold woman’s face suddenly changed. she just felt a terrifying force sweep past her, and she knew she was definitely unable to block it. The black dagger in her hand was immediately knocked away. However, the sword light still swept towards her arm without any sign of its power diminishing.

Hua!?A horrific slaughtering force erupted. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The cold woman’s arm was directly shredded by the bursting slaughtering force, but the sword light continued to sweep along her arm, moving towards her upper body, where it immediately penetrated her chest. A large amount of flesh and blood spilled out as the cold woman’s breath also instantly disappeared.

“Third Sister!” First Holy Master’s eyes widened with anger at this scene.

But Jian Wushuang grinned at him, his figure once again flickering like a ghost.

“Second Brother, retreat! Retreat! ” First Holy Master roared with a shrill cry.

He was not afraid of Jian Wushuang’s attack. Although he could not compete against Jian Wushuang, he still had the ability to defend himself. But the other three Holy Masters could not. Two of them had already been killed in an instant, with only Second Holy Master remaining.?He did not want Second Holy Master to die at Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Second Holy Master was indeed cunning.

As soon as Jian Wushuang killed Fourth Holy Master, he was already aware of the trouble he was facing, so he immediately fled. When Jian Wushuang decided to kill him, after slaughtering Fourth Holy Master and Third Holy Master, he had fled beyond the perimeter of the Blood River.

Without Blood River’s oppression, his speed was no longer being affected, so he could run even faster. Even Jian Wushuang could not kill him in the first place.

Second Holy Master fled to First Holy Master’s side. the two looked extremely pale as they stared at Jian Wushuang.

With the Triple-kill Sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang stood at the center of the Blood River, like a Sword God from ancient times.

As for the experts who were watching, as well as the young warriors who came to participate in the selection, all of them were currently holding their breath.

When they saw Jian Wushuang suddenly rush out, defeating the four Holy Masters in one single sword move, followed by killing two of them, one after the other, the atmosphere surrounding Holy Emperor Island became utterly chaotic.

“Holy Master!”

The four Holy Masters of Holy Emperor Palace had always been unattainable and almost invincible in the eyes of everyone on the Nanyang Continent.

But now they watched as Jian Wushuang, a single person, fought against the four Holy Masters, and killed two of them, one after the other, in a short period of time. This overwhelming and incredible scene shocked everyone.

The young fighters were even more excited. Their feelings of worship towards Jian Wushuang reached an unprecedented level.

On the other hand, the warriors from Holy Emperor Palace all looked pale and bloodless.

“Ha ha. Holy Emperor Palace is finished!”

Wang Yuan, who was among the experts from the Alchemy School,?was extremely excited at that moment. He shouted with a smile.

Wang Yan, who was beside Wang Yuan, slightly shook his head upon hearing this and said, “Not necessarily. ”

“Not necessarily?” Wang Yuan frowned, then quickly turned to face him. “Father, even the four Holy Masters, who are the strongest in Holy Emperor Palace, had been defeated by Third Brother. He even slaughtered two of them. Who could possibly stop him? Third Brother will definitely uproot Holy Emperor Palace!”

“You are underestimating Holy Emperor Palace,” Wang Yan glanced at Wang Yuan and said in a low voice, “If their strength was so simple, our Alchemy School would not be so scared of them.”

“What do you mean? ” Wang Yuan’s face turned gloomy.

“Just watch.” Wang Yan did not explain too much. “However, your brother is really strong and determined. He seems to have already suspected that the Holy Emperor Palace is not as simple as it seems. So, from the beginning, he has been holding back his strength.”

“Third Brother isn’t using his full strength?” Wang Yuan was stunned, but he continued watching.

Many experts of Holy Emperor Palace had gathered at the front gate. But, at the moment, all of them had extremely ghastly expressions as they stared at Jian Wushuang, who had a cold look on his face. Behind him were two giant, sword-wielding, spectral images, that were radiating a monstrous Sword Essence.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang moved his feet, slowly walking forward.

Step by step, he slowly advanced towards Holy Emperor Palace.

Dung! Dung! Dung! Dung!

His heavy footsteps were like drum beats in the hearts of all the experts from the Holy Emperor Palace, gradually making their hearts sink to the bottom of the abyss.

“What should we do?”

“Holy Master, what should we do?”

Some of the Elders shouted at the two Holy Masters.

First Holy Master and Second Holy Master both looked sullen and desperate.

Even though his heart was full of unwillingness, First Holy Master knew that he could not stop Jian Wushuang on his own.

But, at this moment... Jian Wushuang, who was slowly walking towards the Holy Emperor Palace,?suddenly stopped and looked up, staring at the area above the entrance to Holy Emperor Palace. He had noticed something.

There was a figure slowly stepping towards him.

His pace was slow and light, but every step covered a long distance. In the beginning, he had been far off in the distance, but he quickly stepped past the experts of Holy Emperor Palace, appearing in front of Jian Wushuang. He was currently standing 30 meters in front of Jian Wushuang.

This man was very young, with a handsome face. He wore a gold robe and looked quite gentle.

But, the most remarkable thing about him was the horrid and bloody sword scar between his eyebrows.

The gold-robed young man stood calmly in front of Jian Wushuang, not radiating even the slightest aura. He just looked at Jian Wushuang, with a playful smile on his face.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly widened the moment he saw this young man.

“This man is the last line of defense for Holy Emperor Palace?”
