Chapter 3978: Escaping Back to the Divine Beginning Realm

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Silence!

The entire universe void was silent, so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

In the depths of the universe void, regardless of whether it was the experts from the Divine Beginning Realm Camp or the Devil Cloud Star camp, their eyes were wide open as they looked at the scene in front of them in disbelief.

Shi Hua Divine Emperor was a genuine fourth-level Ruler. At the edge of the universe, such a Ruler could easily become a second-level Star Master. Although there were many experts present…except for Jian Wushuang, only the Immortal Dipper Battle Formation formed by the 36 slaves of the Divine Beginning Realm could contend with Shi Hua Divine Emperor.

However, such an extremely powerful Ruler was devoured by Star Demon Ancestor’s soul and divine body in an instant.

!!

There was no room for struggle. Shi Hua Divine Emperor did not even have time to resist before he became Star Demon Ancestor’s food. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This…” Jian Wushuang looked at the scene in front of him in astonishment.

After devouring Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s soul and body, the black vortex dissipated and Star Demon Ancestor reappeared.

However, Jian Wushuang could clearly sense that Star Demon Ancestor’s aura, including his soul aura, was much stronger than before.

“His injuries have recovered a lot?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “He relied on devouring Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s soul and divine body to recover his soul and divine body?”

Jian Wushuang was immediately shocked and angry.

Star Demon Ancestor had said that he could rely on devouring other people’s souls to recover and improve his own soul. However, what Jian Wushuang did not know was that Star Demon Ancestor could also devour other people’s divine bodies, to recover his divine body.

Yes, Star Demon Ancestor had occupied the divine body of Devil Cloud Star Master. This divine body was too heavily injured and had little divine power left. It could not exert any battle strength. However, after devouring Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s divine body and soul…Star Demon Ancestor’s divine body instantly recovered a lot, and even his divine power had recovered about 20% .

“Hehehe…”

Star Demon Ancestor let out a wanton and strange laugh. After devouring Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s soul and divine body, he looked at the 36 experts who formed the immortal gang battle formation in front of him.

These 36 slaves of Jian Wushuang had been entangled with Shi Hua Divine Emperor in the immortal gang battle formation. They were the closest to Shi Hua Divine Emperor. After Star Demon Ancestor devoured Shi Hua Divine Emperor…he naturally began to pay attention to them again.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The transparent soul chains extended again. Each one of them was extremely fast and unstoppable.

Even Shi Hua Divine Emperor could not stop these souls directly. Jian Wushuang’s slaves could not stop them, even if they relied on the power of the battle formation.

The nine giant soul chains extended directly into the battle formation and almost instantly touched the nine slaves in the battle formation.

Although the nine slaves were all third-level masters and the strongest experts in the Eternal Dark Prison, they had no room to struggle in front of the soul chains.

In an instant, the nine souls were pulled out and charged at Star Demon Ancestor uncontrollably. In an instant, they were mercilessly devoured by Star Demon Ancestor.

“Heavens!”

“What kind of technique is this? Be it a third-level Ruler or a fourth-level Ruler, they do not have any room to struggle?”

“Run, run quickly, or they will all be devoured by Star Demon Ancestor.”

After nine experts were devoured by Star Demon Ancestor, the remaining slaves all panicked and immediately ran away as fast as they could.

“Run, everyone stay away from Star Demon Ancestor,” Jian Wushuang shouted. He spread the huge wings on his back and tried to reach Star Demon Ancestor as fast as he could, he wanted to stop Star Demon Ancestor.

However…Star Demon Ancestor knew that Jian Wushuang was a perfect being and that his soul was invincible.

The soul extraction technique that he was using was useful for third-level and fourth-level masters, but it was useless against Jian Wushuang.

Since his divine body had not fully recovered, he did not want to waste any more time on Jian Wushuang.

Star Demon Ancestor moved in a strange way, as if he had teleported through the universe void. In the blink of an eye, he arrived among the remaining masters on Devil Cloud Star.

Then, soul chains flew out, and the masters under Devil Cloud Star immediately became his food.

He followed Star Demon Ancestor to other places and appeared in one corner after another. The soul chains extended and devoured the souls and bodies of the experts. No one could stop him.

Even Jian Wushuang could only watch helplessly.

In the blink of an eye, Star Demon Ancestor had devoured more than 1,000 cultivators, including many Principles Masters. He had also devoured more than a dozen of Jian Wushuang’s slaves, Star Demon Ancestor had also devoured many of the Rulers of the Divine Beginning Realm.

“Run! Run toward the Divine Beginning Realm!”

“Quick! As long as we run back to the Divine Beginning Realm, Star Demon Ancestor won’t be able to do anything to us.”

“Don’t gather together! Run separately!”

The high-level experts of the Divine Beginning Realm roared desperately. Jian Wushuang did not chase after Star Demon Ancestor anymore. Instead, he helped the experts of the Divine Beginning Realm run as fast as possible.

Fortunately, the battlefield they had chosen before was in the universe void around the Divine Beginning Realm, leaving a way for their camp to retreat. Now that they had met Star Demon Ancestor, they could escape back to the Divine Beginning Realm as fast as possible, otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Even so, there were still many experts whose souls and divine bodies had been devoured by Star Demon Ancestor.

The vast universe void was originally filled with countless cultivators, but now, it was empty. Only Star Demon Ancestor was left standing there. As for the many experts from the Divine Beginning Realm’s camp and Devil Cloud Star’s camp…besides those who had been devoured, most of them had fled to the Divine Beginning Realm. There were also a few who had fled to other places.

The Divine Beginning Realm was close to the edge of the universe void.

Many top experts from the Divine Beginning Realm camp had gathered there, but their expressions were extremely unsightly at the moment.

“How are the losses?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ruler Spark beside him and asked in a low voice.

“It’s very tragic. Out of master’s 41 slaves, only 25 are alive, and nearly half have died. As for the Divine Beginning Realm camp’s Rulers, more than ten have died. As for the Principles Masters, they are still fine. Only a few hundred have been devoured,” Ruler Spark said.
