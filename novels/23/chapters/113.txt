Chapter 114: Victory and Defeat

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Hum~~It’s the terrifying unbridled sword shadows.

Sometimes they were majestic, and sometimes they were ethereal, while sometimes they were violent!

The three sword essences fused into a perfect transformation.

It was so unusual that nobody could deal with it, not even Xiao Mang.

Although Xiao Mang was ranked twenty-second on the Earth Dragon List due to his amazing saberplay, he could only break through the tenth level of Dragon Gate with his Gale Sword Essence. However, with the perfect transformation of the three sword essences, Jian Wushuang was able to break through the eleventh level.

Although there was only one level between the tenth and the eleventh levels, the gap between them was like heaven and earth.

If it was not because Xiao Mang was able to generate greater power than Jian Wushuang, he would have been defeated a long time ago.

“Look, Xiao Mang is going to be defeated!”

“It’s true!”

“The black-dressed swordsman is too terrifying as he can transform the three sword essences perfectly.”

“It is not because Xiao Mang is not strong enough. It is because the black-robed swordsman is too marvelous to control three sword essences at the same time, and what’s more, he can understand them so well. It is my first time seeing such a thing.”

The warriors of the Gold Core Realm there were all amazed at the result.

In the battlefield, Xiao Mang was going to be defeated.

“Xiao Mang, just give up.” Came the voice of Jian Wushuang.

“Ha ha, give up? That will never happen in my life.” There was a crazy look in Xiao Mang’s eyes.

Abruptly, the aura around Xiao Mang strengthened. His power improved immediately as he lashed out with his saber.

“He’s putting up a desperate fight!”

“It is unbelievable that Xiao Mang is forced to such desperation.”

The crowd around exclaimed.

Seeing the angry blade flash with his surging power, Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank and he switched from offense to defense. Then he showed his Reincarnation Sword Skill.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The continuing impacts generated air waves. The waves spread to the surroundings, which caused flying debris. Some of the debris hit the warriors of the Gold Core Realm, and the strong winds roared, blowing on the Golden Pill warriors’ clothes.

“It’s useless.”

With a growl, Jian Wushuang lashed out with his Triple-kill Sword.

The sword edge slammed onto Xiao Mang’s saber. An overpowering Spiritual Power erupted and Xiao Mang was repulsed immediately and finally he was slammed onto a great stone behind.

Bang!

The great stone was broken apart instantly.

With blood spewing from his mouth, Xiao Mang walked slowly from the hollow stone. He looked up and stared at Jian Wushuang. Though there was still strong battle intent in his eyes, he clasped his hands together and the Spiritual Power around him faded away.

He was defeated.

Though Xiao Mang was reluctant to do so, he had to acknowledge that he was defeated.

Jian Wushuang was able to transform the three sword essences perfectly, but it put him under too much pressure, so he had to struggle. But this kind of struggle consumed too much Spiritual Power, so after just a while, his Spiritual Power had been used up.

Unlike Xiao Mang, the aura around Jian Wushuang was still strong and it seemed that his Spiritual Power hadn’t been consumed at all after the fierce battle.

Actually, Jian Wushuang’s Spiritual Power had been mostly consumed, but it meant little to him.

You know, when he had just reached Transforming Sea Realm before, the Ultimate Spiritual Sea possessed tremendous Spiritual Power. Though now he had broken through and reached Supreme Gold Core Realm, the Ultimate Spiritual Sea was transformed to the Gold Core Power and was no longer so large, it was still stronger than the ordinary Gold Core, at least it was ten times that of ordinary warriors of the Gold Core Realm.

So after a fierce battle, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was still at its peak.

“Look, Xiao Mang is defeated!”

“Although he tried his best, he was defeated.”

The warriors of the Gold Core Realm around could tell that Xiao Mang had consumed all his Spiritual Power, so they couldn’t help sighing and felt sorry for Xiao Mang.

Though they felt sorry for Xiao Mang, they felt admiration for him.

Yes, it was admiration.

It was obvious that Xiao Mang had consumed all his Spiritual Power and wasn’t able to fight anymore, but in his eyes, his battle intent never weakened, and he also kept clasping the saber, while the saber essence around him was still strong.

The battle was over, but the battle intent remained.

“Xiao Mang.”

Jian Wushuang walked to Xiao Mang, and he also showed his admiration for Xiao Mang when he looked at him. However, he told Xiao Mang, “In this battle, you are defeated.”

“Defeated?” Xiao Mang smiled sadly, then he closed his eyes and kept silent.

“I want to know why you are so eager to get the Black Water Lotus and even risk your life to fight with me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He was curious.

Based on what he knew, the seeds were the most important part of the Black Water Lotus, while the Black Lotus themselves were not very useful.

However, in order to get the Black Lotus, Xiao Mang risked his life to fight with him…

“The Black Lotus…” Xiao Mang reopened his eyes and shook his head, then he said, “Swordsman, do you know how long since I reached Exceptional Gold Core Realm?”

Jin Wushuang was astonished and said directly: “I have seen your information in the Earth Dragon List. You have long been famous and was listed in the Earth Dragon List seven years ago.”

“Yes, I was listed in the Earthly Dragon List seven years ago, but I have reached the Golden Pill grandmaster for 15 years.” Xiao Mang said in a low voice.

“15 years?” Jian Wushuang was startled.

For 15 years, he had been stuck at Exceptional Gold Core Realm?

“15 years ago, when I reached the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, I met a bottleneck and I found that I wasn’t able to make breakthrough anymore even though I tried whatever I could.” Xiao Mang smiled bitterly.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He also knew that in the way of cultivation, it would be harder and harder to make breakthroughs.

For many people, once they met the bottleneck, it was normal for them to stop making further breakthroughs for a long time. What’s more, it was nothing new for most of them to stop forever.

The Exceptional Gold Core Realm and Yin-Yang Void Realm were so wide that it was very difficult to cross this bottleneck.

Even for such a genius like Xiao Mang, it took him 15 years to be constrained under this bottleneck without making any breakthrough.

“I’m eager to make a breakthrough and became a legendary Yin-Yang Void Realm strongman, but I have hit this bottleneck for too long. I am desperate. However, not long ago, I met an alchemist.”

“The master was well versed in this area and I happened to do him a favor before, so he promised to refine a Bottleneck-breaking Pill for me as long as I could gather enough materials!” Xiao Mang said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“The Bottleneck-breaking Elixir?” The warriors of the Gold Core Realm around were all astonished.

“The Bottleneck-breaking Pill will provide me the chance to cross the bottleneck and make the breakthrough. Though it is not very likely to happen, it’s the only hope for me. From that time, I tried whatever I could to gather the materials needed in refining the pill.” Xiao Mang continued.

“I went to many places to gather the materials for a long time and I have gathered most of them. The only thing that I haven’t gathered is the Black Lotus.”

After hearing this, all the warrior of the Gold Core Realm around were clear about his intentions.

It turned out that Xiao Mang needed the Black Lotus to refine the Bottleneck-breaking Pill. No wonder he chose to risk his life for the Black Lotus.

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang looked strange. He moved his hand, and a black Elixir Pill appeared on his hand.

“Is this the Bottleneck-breaking Pill you mentioned?”
