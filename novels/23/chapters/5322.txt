Chapter 5321: The Father Is Noble Because of His Son

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang felt that the pair of eyes were staring at him, but he couldn’t sense who it was.

“Forget it. With the goat horn old man here, there shouldn’t be any problems!”

With a twitch of his Heart power, the ripples in his heart calmed down once more.

There were still 11 golden swords on the battlefield. He had to seize all of

them.

As for the one that Zhu Bachi had taken away, he had no choice but to get as many as he could!

Not long after he returned to his seat, Elder Nine Swords brought the golden sword to him.

The small golden sword swam around him like a fish.

Pa!

He grabbed the swimming golden sword and kept it into his origin source. Jian Wushuang was shocked by the Great Dao after he carefully comprehended it!

This is a colorful Great Dao, with the source being the variegated part. Following it is only a small strand of golden origin, but it brings immeasurable benefits.

Indeed, the Great Dao of the Shangqing Ancestor is extraordinary.

It has already fused space with the Dao of the Sword, and within the origin of the Sword Dao, there is even a trace of the Dao of all things.

This pleasantly surprises him.

He didn’t expect that a golden sword could not only enlighten him on his ultimate path but also bring benefits to the Extreme Dao.

The power of all things!

It is a force stronger than devouring. Once the Extreme Dao breaks through the seventh layer and masters the power of all things, among the Grand Yan Immortals, he will be truly invincible. Emperors can be slain, whether they are from the outside world or natives, all can be defeated.

Now, the Extreme Dao is breaking through continuously. Although the seventh layer is very close, it is not easy to break through.

Every three layers pose a bottleneck, making it extremely challenging to overcome.

The three layers of the power of devouring rely on consumption, and there is almost no reliance on cultivation. Now, wanting to enter the seventh layer is simply not knowing where to start.

He can only devour some origin source first and make the sixth layer perfect.

Devour.

The native Dao Lords and those Emperors were the true delicacies.

No wonder the Qishen Temple suppressed those Demon Lords, keeping them confined. Releasing them would pose a significant threat; in no time, they could devour practitioners from the Four Great Secret Realms. Moreover, the more they devoured, the stronger they became, and the backlash grew more formidable.

Once the snowball started rolling, even Zhen Ling might not be able to contain it.

After understanding these dynamics, Jian Wushuang felt a sense of acceptance.

Shan Jun had shown him kindness, and while there were dark thoughts within him, there were limits to how far he would go.

Having pondered this, he left a Thought Power avatar in the Origin Dao, freeing his mind from these concerns.

On the arena.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t the quickest to finish a battle; there was another Daoist whose strength was formidable. He challenged the Sword Leader and was defeated with just one stroke, even faster than Jian Wushuang.

The Emperor’s sons and daughters from various sects were all formidable, engaging in reciprocal battles with those from the Tai’a Sword Sect. As they fell one by one, it was nothing out of the ordinary.

However, there was a Dao Lord who persisted until the end.

Broly!

Jian Wushuangs gaze shifted, watching the robust, bare-chested man on the arena with some surprise.

The strength of this person, he had seen through long ago.

Even now, upon closer inspection, it remained the same. How could he possibly persist until now?

With a slight concentration of thought power, he probed the arena. Upon reevaluation, Brolys aura, even after continuous battle, was still growing stronger.

Both divine body and origin source were undergoing transformations with the ongoing fight.

“He’s not cultivating the Dao of the sword!” someone exclaimed.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. Well, no kidding. If others weren’t using a sword and the origin source didn’t carry any sword intent, how could it be sword cultivation?

A wandering cultivator who didn’t cultivate the Dao of the sword but managed to enter the Shangqing Palace to observe the Sword Tide.

He turned his gaze to the back rows.

Seated in the fourth row, an Emperor clenched his fists, staring intently at the arena. His appearance bore a striking resemblance to Broly.

“My son, you must win!”

“For the glory of the Dabu Clan!”

He was a Sword Dao Emperor!

Jian Wushuang immediately recognized the identity of the Emperor.

Then, he turned to look at a fourth-level Emperor standing beside him and asked, “Dao Friend Zhang, who is that person behind us?”

This ‘Zhang’, with the title ‘Hun TianjunO’, was a powerful tier 4 Emperor with a strong background, hailing from a super family. His influence was not weaker than that of the Shangqing Palace, a force Jian Wushuang was familiar with.

“I’ve heard of this person. When I was assigned to Liuzhou by the family, he was the first person 1 got to know! With the strength of a tier 3 Emperor, he has been working hard for the family since the collapse of our sect, which is not an easy task,” Hun Tianjun explained with a slight smile.

Hun Tianjun raised an eyebrow, smiling faintly. “What’s this? Wushuang Daoist is interested in him?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head, glancing at Broly on the stage.

“I’m more interested in his son!”

“Haha, in that case, after the ceremony, I can arrange for the father and son to meet privately,” Hun Tianjun said, patting his chest.

His background was formidable, his personal strength solid, and he had friendly relations with many tier 5 Emperors. Assigned to Liuzhou , he aimed to safeguard the family’s interests and expand his network.

ian Wushuangs expression changed slightly as he said slowly, “There’s no need for that. I have limited time this time. I’ll leave once the golden sword event is over. I’m just curious about this Broly. He doesn’t practice the Dao of the Sword, yet he’s here to contend for the golden sword.”

This kind of thing had actually happened before. A non-sword cultivator had come to snatch the golden sword. Firstly, it was to become famous. Secondly, it was to obtain the golden sword and sell it at a high price.

“However, such opportunities were rare. Sword cultivators rarely had the chance to enter, especially those at the level of Dao Lords.

Just like the strong individuals inside the Tideviewing Pavilion now.

90 percent of them were sword cultivators.

The remaining 10 percent consisted of some Emperors, bringing along their family or sect juniors to observe the Sword Tide.

Broly, on the other hand, was different. He wasn’t a sword cultivator; his father, however, was.

He followed his father into the Shangqing Palace.

Could it be that he came to seize the Golden Sword for his father? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hun Tianjun glanced around. With friends in all directions and a discerning eye, how could he not see Jian Wushuangs confusion?

“Friend Wushuang, that Emperor Bukun is a Sword Dao Emperor. His son, Broly, challenging the stage to win the golden sword, is largely to help his father seize the golden sword and also to gain fame!” Hun Tianjun quietly transmitted his voice.

It was just as he had speculated!

If that was the case, then it was not surprising.

With Broli’s performance in the arena, even if he lost in the end, he would become famous in the Flow State in the future and would definitely be roped in by some large factions.

Winning would be even better.

The Emperors in the back rows were already trying to recruit Emperor Bukun.

This was the influence of a father paving the way for his son!

Emperor Bukun’s strength was weak, at most a tier 3 top-level Emperor. Among the Emperors present, there were few weaker than him.

If he joined certain forces, he might, at best, rise to become a leader of the outer sect.

After all, not being the direct disciple, he could only become an outer sect leader, with no future prospects. It would be better to be a wandering cultivator.
