Chapter 665: Acknowledging Xuan Yi as Master

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On that same day, the news that Jian Wushuang had completely comprehended the first and second sword scars left by Palace Master Xuan Yi spread through the whole Ancient Sect.

Those who had thought Jian Wushuang was too proud and conceited were immediately dumbfounded.

They never dreamed that Jian Wushuang’s gift in Sword Principle would be so high.

Recalling Jian Wushuang’s behavior in the past half year, no one dared to say that he was conceited any more.

There was a thin line between confidence and conceit.

If Jian Wushuang did not succeed in half a year or if his future performance was mediocre, it could be said that he was conceited, but now Jian Wushuang had given those people a severe slap in the face.

Jian Wushuang had absolute confidence in his own choice.

Since he had comprehended the second sword scar in just half a year, who could guarantee that he would not comprehend the third one in the future?

Once he comprehended it, he would be the personal disciple of Palace Master Xuan Yi and would definitely have limitless prospects with Xuan Yi’s personal guidance.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi!”

Many disciples in the Ancient Sect were jealous of Jian Wushuang.

Palace Master Xuan Yi had a very supreme and special position in the Ancient Sect.

One of the important reasons that the Ancient Sect, as a top Sect, was able to surpass the three magnates to some extent was the existence of Palace Master Xuan Yi.

Many experts in the Ancient Sect were proficient in various Weapon Daos, but only Palace Master Xuan Yi was able to establish Sword Palace.

Everyone in the Ancient Sect knew about the strength and mystery of Palace Master Xuan Yi. They all dreamed of being his disciple, but the requirement was too harsh.

The experts who knew that Jian Wushuang wanted to be the disciple of Palace Master Xuan Yi looked down on his choice, as Xuan Yi’s condition was too harsh and it would take a long time for Jian Wushuang to achieve it.

But now, in only half a year, Jian Wushuang had become Xuan Yi’s nominal disciple. His achievement filled people with envy and admiration.

The next day, Sword Tower opened.

Since Palace Master Xuan Yi would be giving a lecture in person, all the Sword Principle disciples who had completely comprehended the first sword scar went to the Sword Tower.

Inside the Sword Tower, over 20 Sword Principle disciples sat cross-legged in the open space.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang was among them.

Before long, a white-robed Xuan Yi appeared at the top of the Sword Tower.

Everyone immediately quieted down. Xuan Yi looked around at all the people below and nodded slightly, then directly started teaching.

“Swords, are predominately for killing!”

“You can use the sword tip to stab, the sword edge to chop, the sword back to block, and the sword blade to slash!”

“It can be said that the sword is a moderate weapon, as it can be used to attack and defend. It’s comprehensive and balanced!”

“Sword Principle is the way of killing, broad and profound!”

“Sword Soul is just the beginning of Sword Principle. Awakening the Sword Soul means that you’re qualified to meditate on Sword Principle. That’s is to say, no matter how strong your Sword Soul is, you still have not mastered Sword Principle!”

“The real Sword Principle is based on the Sword Heart!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Sword Heart?”?Jian Wushuang was listening carefully.

The explanation on Sword Principle by Xuan Yi was completely different from that of Vice Palace Master Nie and Ling Yu.

The Sword Principle explained by Palace Master Xuan Yi was a process from simplicity to complexity, like a tree that gradually evolved from a common seedling to a towering tree.

It was very profound and complicated. Jian Wushuang and other disciples present could not fully understand all the things being explained by Xuan Yi, but the part which they understood benefited them greatly.

Every word from the mouth of Palace Master Xuan Yi seemed to contain special magic and directly explained the essence of Sword Principle. Currently, inside Sword Tower, every disciple was fascinated by his words, including Jian Wushuang.

Palace Master Xuan Yi kept teaching for one whole day and night.

“The greatest Sword Principle starts from simplicity, then strives for complexity, but eventually returns to simplicity.”

When he reached this point, Xuan Yi finally stopped.

Most of the disciples who attended the lecture below had fallen into meditation. It was only after a while that they finally recovered themselves.

Their faces were full of pleasure and regret.

They were pleased because Xuan Yi had talked directly about the essence of Sword Principle, which benefited them a lot. They had also learned many things which they had never thought of before. It was much better than what Vice Palace Master Nie and Ling Yu taught them.

They felt regret because Palace Master Xuan Yi rarely gave lectures. He usually only gave a lecture once a year or sometimes even once every few years. The opportunity was too rare.

“Jian Wushuang!” Palace Master Xuan Yi looked down.

Jian Wushuang had just woken up from the meditation when he heard Palace Master Xuan Yi call his name. He immediately stood up and stepped forward.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi,” Jian Wushuang greeted him with a hint of humility.

“When I left the three sword scars outside of the Sword Tower, I set some rules. Since you’ve completely comprehended the second sword scar, you’re my nominal disciple from now on,” Palace Master Xuan Yi said.

“Disciple Jian Wushuang pays respects to Master!”

Jian Wushuang immediately knelt down in front of Xuan Yi and respectfully kowtowed three times.

“Rise,” Xuan Yi waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang stood up immediately.

“Follow me. The rest of the people can leave,” Xuan Yi said.

The disciples inside Sword Tower immediately dispersed one after another, while Jian Wushuang followed Xuan Yi to the second floor of the Sword Tower.

Jian Wushuang sat face to face with Xuan Yi at a long table as Xuan Yi looked at him with a gentle smile on his face.

“When you began to study the three sword scars, I knew I would have a new disciple. But I never expected it to be so soon,” Xuan Yi smiled. “In the Ancient Sect and even the entire Firmament Territory, only you can comprehend the second sword scar in half a year as you possess the Strongest Sword Soul.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked by his words.

“Master, you knew?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

After he came to the Eternal World, he had never exposed his Strongest Sword Soul in front of people. Even at the Firmament Territory Feast, he only exerted 80% of his Sword Soul Power when he fought with Gong Chao because he did not want people to find out about his Strongest Sword Soul.

He had thought that he hid it well.

He never expected that Palace Master Xuan Yi had discovered the existence of his Strongest Sword Soul long ago.

“The moment I saw you, my Sword Heart was provoked, so I immediately knew that your Sword Soul was extraordinary.”

Xuan Yi explained with a smile, “At that time, only my doppelganger went to the Firmament Territory Feast, so I was not sure whether you owned the Strongest Sword Soul. However, when you arrived at the Ancient Sect and my Original Body saw you, I became certain that you indeed possess the Strongest Sword Soul which make all Sword Principle Warriors envious.”
