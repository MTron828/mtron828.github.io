2025 Torture

The second round of the ranking competition began very quickly.

The experts of early stage Chaotic Realm went up for their assigned battle according to the lots they drew.

Among the crowd, the man in a purple robe, Qiu Ming, retained a solemn look.

“Brother Qiu Ming, don’t worry too much. Although Ah Shou is powerful, as long as you do not fight head-on with him, you will have a chance to win. On top of that, Ah Shou is a solo expert after all. He won’t have any impressive secret skills. How could he win against the secret skills in Qiu Family?” Lin Tianhao looked at him.

“Mm, that’s true,” Qiu Ming nodded his head and he felt more confident.

Very soon, it became the battle between Jian Wushuang and Qiu Ming.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang flashed and appeared in the spacious void. He looked at Qiu Ming in a purple robe who was walking to him slowly and Jian Wushuang broke into a malicious smile. “Hurry up, don’t waste time. If you are afraid, admit defeat straight away. I couldn’t be bothered to fight with someone your level.”

“Admit defeat?” Qiu Ming’s gaze grew cold. He flipped his hand and there was a black spear that shined with cold light which appeared in his hand.

“Start,” the elder who hosted the ranking competition said.

“Haha, come on!” Jian Wushuang let out a burst of hearty laughter. Then, he plunged out like a brown bear against Qiu Ming.

He spread his raging aura over Qiu Ming.

Qiu Ming was terrified. He clenched the spear in his hand more tightly and he moved just as Jian Wushuang was about to reach him.

He moved just like a ghost. He leaped twice and wielded his spear. His divine power concentrated into two rays of light and hit Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and shattered the two rays of lights into pieces. Just as he leaped and wanted to hit Qiu Ming, Qiu Ming dodged to the side again.

“D*mn. Why the hell are you moving here and there? Take a punch of mine if you have the guts!” Jian Wushuang pretended to be angry.

“Idiot. Why would I fight head-on with you when I know that you are powerful?” Qiu Ming smirked coldly. After a short exchange of blows, he became even more confident.

“Brother Tianhao is right. This b*stard only knows force. The other aspects are ordinary. With the secret skills of Qiu Family, in addition to my spear skills, I can totally suppress him as long as I am careful. I could even fool him. I can definitely win this battle!”

Qiu Ming continued to move around in illusionary figures. He constantly moved away from Jian Wushuang and attacked Jian Wushuang with his spear, taking advantage of his flexibility of movement.

Jian Wushuang was on the defensive all of a sudden.

“B*stard, b*stard!”

Jian Wushuang stared with his eyes wide open and his face red from anger. It seemed as though he was helpless against his opponent.

Just as the surrounding crowd thought Jian Wushuang was going to lose. There was a glimpse of madness in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Swoosh!

The spear in Qiu Ming’s hand became a venomous snake and attacked Jian Wushuang from behind. Under normal circumstances, Jian Wushuang would be dodging the spear. However, Jian Wushuang turned around and ignored the spear. He let the spear hit his divine body instead.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and Jian Wushuang’s body quivered but he didn’t step back from the impact. On the contrary, he launched continuous punches.

“Boy, take a punch of mine!”

“King of Beast’s Divine Punch, the eighteenth move!”

Hong!

A huge fist flung at Qiu Ming like a huge sacred elephant.

Qiu Ming obviously didn’t expect that. He couldn’t dodge in time and he was hit by the punch.

Poof!

He spurted a mouthful of blood and his body was like a kite with a cut line. He was flying backward powerlessly.

Jian Wushuang won the battle!

“Humph. Son of a b*tch! You thought I couldn’t do anything about you!”

Jian Wushuang humphed coldly. He reprimanded him while he patted the spot on his chest where Qiu Ming’s spear had stabbed.

There was a white mark that was left by the spear. It was merely a white mark.

The surrounding spectators were surprised.

“This man took Qiu Ming’s hit directly and defeated Qiu Ming?”

“Such a powerful divine body! He took Qiu Ming’s hit and he wasn’t injured at all. He didn’t even move an inch but immediately counterattacked and defeated Qiu Ming. His divine body is so powerful.”

“Powerful strength, powerful divine body! His only weakness is his speed. However, his overall power is terrifying.”

Everyone gasped in astonishment.

Previously, they had thought Jian Wushuang could only be in the top ten among the experts in early stage Chaotic Realm. But now, he could at least be in the top five.

Of course, that was what they had thought.

As for how powerful Jian Wushuang was, no one would know as long as they didn’t show it.

After defeating Qiu Ming, Jian Wushuang retreated to the border of the battlefield and stood there casually in an arrogant manner. Then, the three Great Emperors in Blood Mountain Sword were teasing Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor, how do you feel about bullying the young and inexperienced?” Great Emperor Zhi Luo laughed.

“Sword Emperor, you are so good at pretending. If it wasn’t because all of us know your true power, we would really mistake you as a barbaric Sir God who was slightly more powerful,” Emperor Jiu Qiao added.

However, Jian Wushuang replied bitterly, “The three of you shouldn’t make fun of me. I think all of you understand that it is even tougher to fight with these b*stards than fighting against a Great Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang was telling the truth.

If he were to fight with a Great Emperor, he could at least fight openly without any restraint. He could expose his power openly.

However, during the ranking competition, he was restrained. He was trying his best to disguise himself in terms of behavior, speech and also the power he displayed. Especially during the ferocious battles, he had to control his strength and speed to a reasonable level. It was exceedingly difficult. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Such a battle was torturous to Jian Wushuang.

He’d rather fight against a Great Emperor openly.

“Hold on. There are many more battles coming your way,” Abysmal Saint Master smiled.

“That’s true. Sword Emperor, the three of us are at too high of a realm and we couldn’t expose ourselves. We can only rely on you for this,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo expressed herself too.

Jian Wushuang had no choice.

The following ranking competition was smooth sailing.

Jian Wushuang defeated another expert at the early stage Chaotic Realm and became one of the top nine.

Then, the one-on-one rotation battles among the nine started. In other words, everyone had to fight with the other eight. Then, they would pick the top five from the nine.
