Chapter 3966: The True Strength of the Star Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang did not know whether the Star Master had exerted his full strength.

However, judging from the relaxed look of the Star Master, it was not difficult to tell that he was not lying.

Suddenly…the Star Master put the pitch-black spear back into his hand and took out a purple spear with a flip of his hand.

It was also a spear-type magic weapon, but as soon as the purple spear appeared, the terrifying aura it emitted immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“That’s…”

“A principle supreme treasure!”

“It’s a principle supreme treasure. Such a terrifying aura can’t be wrong.”

The entire battlefield was in an uproar.

“A principle supreme treasure?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He had a principle true treasure and a divine sword that was suitable for him. He knew very well how much a principle true treasure could improve his strength.

For a Ruler, a Ruler with a principle true treasure was on a completely different level from a Ruler who did not have a principle true treasure.

The battle strength that Devil Cloud Star Master had just displayed was only ordinary or slightly stronger than a fourth-level primary Ruler. But now, he had a principle true treasure that was suitable for him to use! His battle strength could at least soar to the level of a fourth-level advanced Ruler!

“He actually has a principle true treasure?” Devil Flame was also a little confused at this moment.

It was known that many fourth-level and even fifth-level Rulers did not have a principle true treasure. Moreover, this place was at the edge of the universe, so there were very few principle true treasures. Jian Wushuang, for example, had a heaven-defying opportunity, he had only obtained a principle true treasure after passing the test in the Red Cloud World. However, Devil Flame had never thought that Devil Cloud Master would have a principle true treasure.

With a principle true treasure, Devil Cloud Master’s combat strength could reach a new level.

As an ultimate Ruler at his peak, Devil Flame had more than one or two principle true treasures. However, since he was hunted down and only his soul was left to escape, he could not find any, his treasures had all fallen into the hands of the expert who had chased him. Even if his soul body regained control of his divine body, Jian Wushuang could not get him a principle treasure suitable for him to use.

After all, Devil Flame was good at cprinciple skills, and his weapon was a cprinciple-type divine weapon. Jian Wushuang could only get him a supreme-grade supreme treasure to use.

However, a supreme-grade supreme treasure seemed to be only a step away from a nomological supreme treasure, but its power was far inferior.

Unlike the many experts in the Divine Beginning Realm who were shocked, Shi Hua Divine Emperor, who had also reached the fourth level, was not surprised at all when he saw Devil Cloud Star Master take out a nomological supreme treasure, some of them just sighed with emotion, “Only the cosmos godly palace is so wealthy. Devil Cloud joined the Cosmos Godly Palace not long ago, but he has been given a special godly weapon that can restrain special life forms and a principle true treasure that can attack. Although it’s only a low-grade principle true treasure, it’s still very rare.”

Shi Hua Divine Emperor and Devil Cloud Star Master were good friends, and he had been envious of Devil Cloud Star Master from the very beginning.

It was not only because Devil Cloud Star Master had taken over a star world, but it was also a fortuitous encounter for Devil Cloud Star Master. He had actually joined the Great Cosmos Godly Palace, which was a large faction that countless great beings in the vast universe yearned to join.

However, the Great Cosmos Godly Palace’s overall strength was extremely powerful, but the threshold was also very high. The requirements for the strength and potential of the Great Beings under its command were also extremely strict. Although Shi Hua Divine Emperor was a fourth-level Ruler…he was not qualified to join the Great Universe Godly Palace at all.

After the principle true treasure spear appeared in Devil Cloud Star Master’s hands, the pressure that Devil Cloud Star Master brought to the Divine Beginning Realm camp was even greater.

“You, try again!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Devil Cloud Star Master held the Purple Spear with one hand, which was at the level of a principle true treasure. He had an evil smile on his face as he looked at Devil Flame in front of him. He even extended his other hand and hooked his finger at Devil Flame.

Devil Flame had an ugly look on his face. Although he knew that Devil Cloud Star Master’s overall combat power would be greatly improved after he had a principle true treasure, Devil Flame was not afraid at all. The surging golden light shone again.

In just an instant, Devil Flame condensed two huge Golden Godly Eagles again. The two Golden Godly Eagles hissed and attacked Devil Cloud Star Master again.

However, this time, faced with the attack of these two Golden Divine Eagles, Devil Cloud Star Master only casually waved the purple spear in his hand.

It was clearly a spear, but at this moment, it was used as a long rod by Devil Cloud Star Master, and was thrown out in an extremely casual manner.

With a casual smash, Devil Cloud Star Master did not even use his ultimate move.

However, the moment the purple spear was thrown out, an extremely unique power erupted.

Boom!

As If an adult was bullying a child, the purple spear smashed through everything in its path, directly crushing the two Golden Eagles formed by the Devil Flame. In fact, the purple spear still contained a shocking amount of power, it directly smashed into the Devil Flame’s divine body.

The Devil Flame’s golden divine body was extremely powerful, but it had only recovered 20% of its original strength. Under the attack of this power, it began to tremble violently, and the Devil Flame even spat out a large mouthful of blood, his aura was greatly weakened, and his body was forced back in a sorry state. It took him quite a while to regain his balance.

“How is this possible?” Devil Flame’s eyes were wide open, and his face was filled with disbelief.

The surrounding experts who were watching the battle were also stunned.

A casual attack was still able to smash out a spear like a long rod, but it was still able to instantly crush the two Golden Divine Eagles formed by Devil Flame. At the same time, it also heavily injured Devil Flame’s divine body.

The gap was too big.

Just a moment ago, Devil Cloud Star Master was in a terrible state under the attack of the two golden divine eagles, and he was even injured. How could it be changed in the blink of an eye.

“Universal principle!”

Jian Wushuang stared at Devil Cloud Star Master in front of him, his face extremely gloomy. Leng Rushuang, who was standing beside Jian Wushuang, was shocked. He also noticed the gloomy look on Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Universe principle!”

“It’s universe principle. Devil Cloud Star Master has comprehended a trace of universe principle?”

“How is it possible? It’s extremely difficult for a Ruler to comprehend a trace of universe principle. How could Devil Cloud Star Master…”

“Did he possess a star world because of this?”

The servants behind Jian Wushuang were also shocked.

The Universe principle was the most supreme power in the vast universe!

Even Jian Wushuang had to pay a great price to barely comprehend a trace of the universe principle.

But now, no one had expected that Devil Cloud Star Master had also comprehended a trace of the universe principle!
