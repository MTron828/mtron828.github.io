Chapter 1308: The Descending Test!

“It isn’t God’s Test but a signifier of a descending test!”

“The signifier formed into thunderclouds?”

“Oh God!”

Everyone on the training field quickly came back to reality and exclaimed one after another.

Most of them had undergone God’s Test but they had only received some strange sensation before their God’s Test came by.

However, the signifier of Jian Wushuang’s God Test had taken the shape of such terrifying thunderclouds?

Until his God Test’s Descended, how strong would it become?

Terrifying!

Everyone was terrified!

“It is said that someone too smart dies young! Those geniuses, the better they are, the more ferocious the God’s test that they encounter. Jian Wushuang was extremely gifted and one like him is rare to come by. Hence, the God’s test that he would face would definitely be scary,” Wu Cang mumbled to himself in the void.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, even God couldn’t tolerate with you!” Universe God in the Nine Oceans laughed hysterically and mischievously, “Even the signifier of your God’s Test has already taken the shape of thunderclouds. I have never heard of that before. When the real God’s Test comes, it would definitely be earth-shaking!”

“Aren’t you extremely talented?”

“Your power as a mere Universe Master, no one Universe God in the First Heaven in Dayu World could win against you!”

“As you are so great, I’d like to see how are you going to pass the upcoming God’s Test!”

Universe God in the Nine Oceans was extremely angry earlier.

Universe God Qing Yang died before him after all but he couldn’t do anything.

Then, he felt much better.

From the signs, he could tell Jian Wushuang was going to deal with an extremely terrifying God’s Test!

Dealing with such a terrifying God’s Test, Jian Wushuang had almost no hope of surviving!

On the training field, everyone came back to reality from their astonishment. They fixed their gazes on Jian Wushuang but remained silent.

Jian Wushuang was the center of attention but he didn’t look worried. As for the mischievous laugh of Universe God in the Nine Oceans, he wasn’t concerned about him either. His eyes were fixed on the thundercloud above him.

There was a terrifying pressure among the thundercloud. It didn’t go away but lingered in the sky for a very long time.

From the thunderclouds, Jian Wushuang received a message.

“A hundred and twenty years later?” Jian Wushuang muttered softly.

The sign of God’s Test had come and it would provide the cultivator a time frame for them to prepare themselves. Although Jian Wushuang was going to undertake Inverse Cultivation Test, it was the same.

The time given for him to prepare for the Inverse Cultivation Test was a hundred and twenty years.

“It’s too short,” King of Venomous Worms’s voice sounded very depressed in Jian Wushuang’s body.

In ordinary cultivation, most of them would have a few centuries to prepare for God’s Test, or even longer. Hence, a hundred and twenty years was fairly short.

“It is really not long but I can at least prepare myself in time,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fist.

Rumble.

The thunder sound continued to be heard but the thundercloud that lingered above the void for a very long time finally started to disperse and the terrifying pressure that covered the sky gradually dispersed too.

Very soon, everywhere became calm and resumed its original state.

Jian Wushuang reined in his gaze. He stood on the ground with his eyebrows tightly creased. He seemed to be muttering to himself. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He did that for a while, then he lifted his head. He took a step and stood before the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang.

“Palace Master, I have a presumptuous request. I wish you would consent,” Jian Wushuang spoke politely.

“Go ahead,” the Master of Dayu Palace looked Jian Wushuang in the eyes.

“My God’s Test will be here in one hundred and twenty years. The place that I will undergo the God’s Test, I’d like it to be at Tribunal Passing Pinnacle. I wonder if it’s okay,” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course,” the Master of Dayu Palace nodded, “Tribunal Passing Pinnacle is a designated place for undergoing God’s Test. Whoever that passes their God’s Test there would be beneficial for Dayu Palace. After all, the inner disciples of Dayu Palace can watch by the side to accumulate more experience, especially when a genius like you is undergoing God’s Test, it’s a chance that is hard to come by!”

“Focus on passing the God’s Test. When you undergo God’s Test, I’ll personally watch over it and there’ll definitely be no one who can disturb you!”

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

Regardless of if he was undergoing God’s Test or the Inverse Cultivation Test, the most important facet in going through God’s Test was to not be disturbed by external factors.

Then, there was deep-seated grudge between him and Holy Prefecture. If he were to undergo God’s Test in other places, he was worried that the other experts from Holy Prefecture would make trouble when he underwent the God’s Test.

But in Dayu Palace, there was the Master of Dayu Palace who would attend personally. Hence, no one would dare to act recklessly. In order words, no one could affect him. Then, he could undergo his God’s Test with his all.

“One more thing,” Jian Wushuang looked at the Master of Dayu Palace and continued, “The reason why I could improve so tremendously in power in the one years is because of the ten years accumulation from the Little Scattered Stars Game. If possible, I’d like another chance to resolve the chess game. If there’s any condition or price that I have to pay, you can be straightforward with me and I’ll try my best to fulfill!”

Jian Wushuang said in all sincerity.

If it was before, he wouldn’t have had the nerve to request a chance even if he was willing to pay a price.

However, Inverse Cultivation Test was coming and Jian Wushuang felt the increase of pressure. At such a crucial moment, he would like to improve his power as much as possible.

The Little Scattered Stars Game was really helpful for him. He, of course, wanted to obtain it with his all.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, the Master of Dayu Palace smiled faintly and said, “Although the Little Scattered Stars Game is in my hand and Wu Cang would study it with me occasionally, it isn’t much help to the two of us. It doesn’t matter if we lend it to you for a hundred and twenty years.

“You are my guest. You can use the resources in Dayu Palace as you wish. Dayu Palace has treasure and elixir that could assist you in passing God’s Test. Of course, you have to use treasure of the same value in exchange for the treasure.”

“Besides, the Blaze Quicksand Gourd that I borrowed from you earlier, I’d return it to you before you undergo your God’s Test too.”

“Thank you, Palace Master,” Jian Wushuang thanked him again.

The Master of Dayu Palace waved.

“Jian Wushuang.”

There was suddenly a deep voice and the owner of the voice was Wu Cang who was seated next to the Master of Dayu Palace.

“Lord Wu Cang,” Jian Wushuang immediately looked over.

“You are extremely gifted. I have come across many geniuses from wandering around Snow Kingdom over the years, but there is hardly anyone who could compare favorably with you. I hope you will pass the God’s test,” Wu Cang looked at Jian Wushuang as he announced.

“If you were to pass through the God’s Test, I will pass you a token and recommend you into Snow Dojo. There are countless geniuses and Dayu World is beyond compare. When you’re there, your potential could be put to full play!”
