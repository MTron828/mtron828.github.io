Chapter 2169 Opposing Blood!

Under the angry stares of the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World, the five people other than Ba Su looked cold.“Hehe. It seems that many people died.” Kaiser Blood exclaimed as he gave a sadistic smile.

“The Three Emperors World took so long to accumulate these experts. But now…” Demon King Chen Yu sighed lightly but looked indifferent.

“Back then, we sacrificed so much to create this world. It was to prepare for this day. Even though these experts died, they should be at peace since they fulfilled their purposes.” Lord Fen said.

“You guys are really cruel.” Leng Ruxue said as she scanned those three men.

“Cruel?”

“Hehe. Before you comment about us, think of who you really are. If your Unique constitution was fully exploited, that destruction might be even greater than the one I have just caused.” Kaiser Blood smirked.

Leng Ruxue squinted her eyes but said no more.

“Alright Kaiser Blood. Is the amount of Blood Qi sufficient after so many sacrifices?” Lord Fen asked.

“Humph. It barely met the requirements.” Kaiser Blood smiled.

Hearing this, Demon King Chen Yu and Lord Fen were elated.

“Looks like we can finally use that move.” Lord Fen smiled coldly.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang kept the expression of Kaiser Blood and friends in mind.

When he saw the smile Kaiser Blood had on his face, he had a bad feeling about what was going to happen.

“What are these bastards trying to do?” Jian Wushuang roared.

To use a special method to cause his subordinates to turn into a demonic state so that they become stronger and killed more people. They would eventually die, unknowingly, a painful death.

This was an extremely inhumane act.

At the same time, he knew that there had to be a reason why Kaiser Blood did that.

There had to be more to it than just causing mass damage and pain to the army from the Eternal Chaotic World.

There must be something else he was hiding, or he was preparing.

Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen both looked dark as they also knew this.

Right then, whoosh!

Kaiser Blood finally moved in front of all the remaining experts.

He took a few steps and appeared at the centre of the battlefield. The experts from Eternal Chaotic World had already retreated to the outskirts of the battlefield behind Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

On the battlefield, Kaiser Blood stood alone with his hands behind his back. He had a creepy smile.

“Emperor Bai, Jian Wushuang, do you still remember what I said to you inside the Imperial City?” Kaiser Blood asked loudly.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai both raised their eyebrows.

They definitely remembered what Kaiser Blood had told them.

“Haha. I said that I would prepare a surprise for both of you when we met again. How was it? Are the two of you happy with it?” Kaiser Blood smirked.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai fell silent. Their killing intents started to rise.

“Kaiser Blood, let us not waste time on useless talk. Do what you planned on doing.” Emperor Bai said coldly.

“Moves?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Of course I have more up my sleeves. You will see soon enough.” Kaiser Blood smiled playfully.

The ground beneath him started shaking vigorously after he started laughing.

“What is this?” The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World turned pale.

“What is happening beneath the ground?” Jian Wushuang looked down as his soul power seeped deep into the ground.

Soon, he found the reason behind the shaking.

Deep underground was a large, blood red formation.

This formation rose up slowly.

It was originally thousands of feet underground. Now, it was less than a thousand, and still on the rise.

Not long after, it was less than a hundred feet from the surface.

“When did this formation appear?” Jian Wushuang wondered grimly.

“This is an extremely bizzare formation. I used my soul power to scan the entire Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, including deep underground. I did not realise that this formation was there,” Emperor Bai said coldly.

Emperor Bai was an inverse cultivator and the strongest expert from the Eternal Chaotic World. His fighting power was mysteriously powerful.

The strength of soul was even greater than that of Jian Wushuang.

Even so, he had not sensed this formation when he had scanned the underground of the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds. The formation was well hidden.

Hum!

A loud hum came from underground as a large, blood red formation emerged.

This blood red formation was saturated with Blood Qi. On closer look, this energy was in droplet form.

No matter if it were Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai or any expert who was good with formations, they could not tell what formation this was.

“What is this formation? I have never seen it before!” An emperor god who excelled in formation cried out.

“This formation doesn’t seem dangerous, but why do I feel so agitated?”

“This is no ordinary formation.”

Discussion was made by the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World.

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World started to take it seriously.

“Emperor Bai. Do you know why I created a Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds here? Do you know why I picked this place as the location for the final battle?” Kaiser Blood said out loud.

Emperor Bai widened his eyes as he exclaimed,”Was it because of this formation?”

“Smart. Allow me to introduce this formation. This formation did not originate from the ancient past or the Eternal Chaotic World. I created this formation after over the years. I had never thought of a suitable name but now I have one for it. It will be called Opposing Blood Formation!” Kaiser Blood smiled.

“Opposing Blood Formation?”

Emperor Bai, Jian Wushuang and the remaining experts finally understood the origins of the formation.

It was no wonder they could not recognize his formation. It had been created by Kaiser Blood not too long ago and it did not even have a name.

However, they still did not know what the formation was used for. From the looks of it, it did not look good.
