Chapter 2755: About To Take Action

“Mr. An Ying, congratulations to you too.” Jian Wushuang looked toward a middle-aged man who had sharp and eagle-like eyes beside them.

That middle-aged man was An Ying, a previously famous Primary-level Grand Ultimate God in the Danyang Continent who had already made a breakthrough to the High-level Grand Ultimate God after taking the Huangji Golden Pill.

As for the last person, she was a lady with silver hair known as Lan Junzhu. She had also obtained a Huangji Golden Pill but was not as lucky as the other two and did not become a High-level Grand Ultimate God. However, she had previously promised Jian Wushuang and would still fight for the Sword Alliance for 1,000 years even though she did not manage to make a breakthrough.

In addition, Old Snake—the earliest person to obtain the Huangji Golden Pill and join the Sword Alliance—had also successfully made a breakthrough to High-level Grand Ultimate God after consuming the Huangji Golden Pill.

It meant that out of the five Huangji Golden Pills apart from the Strange Old Tong who had not swallowed it, three out of the four Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods had successfully made a breakthrough.

Jian Wushuang had added four High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God to the Sword Alliance in one go with those three people making a breakthrough.

Apart from that, Strange Old Tong was considered top-tier among those four High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and no weaker than Saber Master.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was previously positioned in the top among Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. He was capable of fighting against two High-level Grand Ultimate Gods when he was a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. His breakthrough had increased his strength by leaps and bounds—bringing his combat prowess almost similar to Strange Old Tong.

An Ying and Old Snake were also quite strong and not considered weaklings among High-level Grand Ultimate Gods after making their breakthrough.

It could be said that all four High-level Grand Ultimate Gods had extremely strong combat power.

Together with Jian Wushuang and the corpse puppets he controlled, those pinnacle forces might not even be comparable to the Sword Alliance when considering the combat power of those at the highest realm.

“Now that our highest realm combat powers have been increased by so much, it’s time for the Sword Alliance to take action after being quiet for a couple of decades.”Jian Wushuang smiled coldly.

Jian Wushuang immediately gathered the Sword Alliance’s higher management members.

“Long Shan, what’s the scale of the Divine Sword Army right now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Alliance Master, the Divine Sword Army has increased to five hundred people and all of them are Heaven Ultimate Gods with great strength. Apart from that, their execution of the military formation and magic formation has been much more skillful after all these years. The current overall strength of the Divine Sword Army is still incomparable to the Crimson Stone Official Army of the Crimson Stone Fort. However, the Divine Sword Army is strong enough to fight legions cultivated by any forces and defeat them head-on apart from the Crimson Stone Official Army,” said Long Shan confidently.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The Divine Sword Army was something he formed with great sacrifice.

It could be said that more than 90 percent of the resources he obtained had been given to the Divine Sword Army. That was also the reason the Divine Sword Army could grow to such a capacity within the short period of several decades.

“Gather the Divine Sword Army. We’re leaving soon,” said Jian Wushuang directly.

“Leaving? Young Master plans to take action against the forces surrounding us?” Xiao Tiexin immediately looked over at Jian Wushuang.

The group of Sword Alliance’s higher management also looked at Jian Wushuang in excitement.

The Sword Alliance’s strength was growing every day at that moment as they were supported by a huge number of resources. Many of those in the higher management were unsatisfied with their current situation. All of them wanted to expand the Sword Alliance and even if they were unable to make huge expansions, they wished for small ones whereby they could take over the second-rated and third-rated forces around them.

However, Jian Wushuang constrained the experts of the Sword Alliance strictly and prohibited them from expanding since the Sword Alliance became one of the first-rated forces several decades ago.

Therefore, the Sword Alliance had been extremely powerful for several decades but without any territorial expansion. They had been longing to carry out an expansion since early on but could only forcefully hold their urges back due to the deterrence of the Alliance Master.

The Alliance Master had finally decided to make a move against the surrounding forces at that moment?

“Bring the stellar map over,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

Somebody immediately brought a large stellar map and opened it in the hall.

The stellar map recorded the entire Danyang Continent including each force’s territories.

For example, the territories controlled by the Sword Alliance were also shown on the stellar map.

“Haha... It looks like there are quite a few forces in the area surrounding our Sword Alliance?” Jian Wushuang looked at the distribution of forces on the stellar map.

“That’s true. There are four second-rated forces and many third-rated forces around our territories. These forces have some conflicts with us across these years. However, our Sword Alliance did not make any large movements because of the constraint you’ve placed. Otherwise, these second-rated and third-rated forces would’ve been taken over by us long ago,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Previously, we weren’t strong enough. Expanding unscrupulously will raise fear between those first-rated or even pinnacle forces, especially those who don’t want us to break the balance they tried so hard to maintain. Famous people attract criticism—once our Sword Alliance continues to expand unscrupulously, those pinnacle forces may directly take action against us. The Sword Alliance can’t withstand a pinnacle force’s attack at that time.” Jian Wushuang smiled softly.

“That’s how it was previously, but it’s different now.” The corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth slightly bent upward.

Previously, the Sword Alliance was unable to fight a pinnacle force by themselves, hence he dared not act recklessly and had been restricting the Sword Alliance’s experts to build up their strength first.

At that moment, their top management’s strength and core Heaven Ultimate Gods’ combat power including the Divine Sword Army had improved, making him no longer afraid of those pinnacle forces.

There was nothing he was afraid of at that point.

“Master, there are so many forces around this area. Which one should we take action against first or should we directly deploy the Divine Sword Army to sweep out all of these forces?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“There are only some second-rated and third-rated forces around us. They aren’t worth wasting our time. Our Sword Alliance has been quiet for a long time, hence let’s make it a big one if we’re going to make a move. We shall take action against that one!!” Jian Wushuang directly pointed at an area on the stellar map.

There was a certain distance between that area and the territory controlled by the Sword Alliance with several forces in between.

Xiao Tiexin, Long Shan, Dong Xue, and the others had weird expressions on their faces upon seeing the target Jian Wushuang chose.

“Heavenly Blood Alliance? Master, you want to take action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance?” Xiao Tiexin looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Why? Is it not possible?” Jian Wushuang said with a snicker.

“The Heavenly Blood Alliance is the first-rated force of that area and considered extremely strong amongst first-rated forces. According to rumors, they have three Grand Ultimate Gods with one of them being a High-level Grand Ultimate God. The most important rumor mentioned that the Heavenly Blood Alliance has a close relationship with the Divine Demon Sect with news that the Divine Demon Sect is secretly supporting the Heavenly Blood Alliance.

“Won’t taking action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance means we’re acting against the Divine Demon Sect?”
