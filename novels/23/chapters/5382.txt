Chapter 5381: Death Crisis

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As these words were spoken, Jian Wushuang quickly retreated.

The intensity of that killing intent was too overwhelming; he instinctively stepped back, but the crisis had already descended in the last moment.

A spout of blood erupted, blood gushing like a fountain.

Jian Wushuang fell heavily to the ground and couldn’t get up.

Even though the power wrapped around the attack seemed small, with just one glance, he was directly gravely injured.

But this was exactly what he wanted. If Xia Mang didn’t scold or beat him, he might have been dragged out and slaughtered.

The face of a strong individual is crucial.

After killing the juniors of others, how could one expect a civilized conversation?

“This is just a small punishment for your crimes!” Xia Mang said, sipping tea.

Killing Jian Wushuang was a considerable trouble for him, but he couldn’t let it go easily either.

He disguised himself and infiltrated the internal affairs of the Great Xia Imperial Family.

At the very least, he needed to find out what Jian Wushuang was up to.

However, he didn’t reveal Jian Wushuangs identity to anyone; only he knew.

But the powerhouses under him weren’t all in the hands of the Great Xia Emperor.

Now, someone had already been investigating Xia Mang Guanyu’s recent activities in the Great Xia Imperial City.

The air gradually thickened.

A figure in black, wearing a mask, appeared behind Xia Mang. Then, he took out a jade slip, and once again disappeared into the air.

Glancing at the jade slip, Xia Mang paid no attention to the fallen Jian Wushuang, muttering to himself, “You must be recruiting private soldiers for nearly a hundred years, expanding your military strength, and pledging a considerable amount of godstones in various major banks under the name of the Xia Mang family. Your actions don’t resemble that of an inheritor!”

Although the inheritors were mysterious, in the kingdom of Great Xia, there were already several of them.

And they all had good relations with the royal family!

So, Jian Wushuangs identity wasn’t as frightening to him. Even though he saw that figure make a move that day, he could discern from the subsequent treatment of Hu Qing and the attitude of Wuliang that there was more to it.

There was also the distinction between nobility and lowliness among the inheritors.

Just now, he had sent someone to visit Hu Qing, and later he would have Hu Qing come and see if he recognized this impostor.

If Jian Wushuangs status and position were high, then he would let Hu Qing take him away, considering it as giving face to Hu Qing.

If the status was average, and he wasn’t very familiar with Hu Qing, it wouldn’t be so simple.

Jian Wushuangs strength and potential were both astonishing. He would either give him face and don’t offend him, or eliminate him as a potential threat.

Keeping him around would also be a trouble.

After a while, Jian Wushuang finally managed to get up.

The blow just now didn’t seriously injure him, the reason he got up so late was that people had arrived, and he didn’t need to pretend anymore.

“Hehe, no need to pretend, let’s lay our cards on the table!” Jian Wushuang touched the blood at the corner of his mouth.

Xia Mang showed a puzzled expression!

In the Great Xia Imperial City.

In the eastern city, in a inconspicuous and quiet courtyard.

Hu Qing had just seen off several Emperor visitors who came to discuss matters, and there was a strong smile on his face.

“Virtuous! ”

A black-robed monk!

Just as she was about to turn around, a figure appeared behind her, it was a shadowy expert from Xia Mangs ancestors.

“Lord Hu Qing, sorry to trouble you!” The shadow revealed his true appearance, but from top to bottom, whether it was the aura or the face, not a

hint was revealed.

Hu Qing was somewhat surprised but not flustered.

Although the other party was at tier 5, he could maintain calmness.

“Senior, 1 don’t know what business you have with me!”

The shadow took out a portrait, and on top of it was the appearance of Jian

Wushuang. Then he whispered, “l wonder it you recognize this inheritor named Jian Wushuang!’

Upon seeing this painting, Hu Qings expression trembled!

Jian Wushuang!

In the past!

During his time in the Tongtian Buddhist Realm, he was close to several masters, with his mission to traverse to the Great Si Region. Now, with the masters fallen and his mission personally shattered by Wuliang Buddha.

Fortunately, he has recovered the Ultimate Daoo he once possessed, the Zen Mechanism!

The black robe represents his Great Dao.

The monk’s head represents the past!

The future and the past!

He lives in the present!

The two merge.

All of this is because of the appearance of Jian Wushuang!

It is also because of Jian Wushuangs philosophy.

A thousand years ago, the news of Jian Wushuangs fall, he never believed it. Now, hearing news of Jian Wushuang again, no one is happier than him.

“l know him!”

Jian Wushuang once led him to break through the army of corpses, and it was also Jian Wushuang who let him achieve enlightenment when he was on the verge of falling.

In the Qishen Temple now.

Gradually drifting away from the people of the Tongtian Buddha Realm, if one were to say who has the best relationship now, it is probably only Jian Wushuang.

The grace of saving a life has never been forgotten.

Jiang Shang, the young girl, stood aside. Seeing Master Hu Qings expression, she was also somewhat moved. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He had heard the master talk about Jian Wushuang.

For Hu Qing, Jian Wushuang was both a teacher and a friend.

Without Jian Wushuang, he would have fallen long ago. Without Jian Wushuang, he wouldn’t have achieved the Dao. Perhaps he would have continued to reincarnate.

The two entered the Qishen Temple together and fought side by side.

Friendship in life and death!

“Senior, where did you get this painting?”

The figure of Jian Wushuang in the painting is exactly how he appeared in the Xia Mang courtyard.

Hu Qing was somewhat moved and hurriedly asked.

The shadowy expert sensed Hu Qings excitement and had an answer in mind.

If Hu Qing had shown average interest, he probably wouldn’t have brought up the matter again. But with Hu Qings reaction, he had to take Hu Qing there.

The shadowy figure clasped his fists and said, “Your Highness, follow me! He is within the imperial city.”

“Alright!

In a flash, the two figures disappeared, leaving Jiang Shang alone in the courtyard.

When they reappeared, the spatial shift had taken them to another location within the Great Xia Imperial City.

The Xia Mang Clan’s ancestral temple existed in a separate space from the imperial city.

This place belonged to a movable celestial mansion.

Swish, swish!

Upon arriving at the celestial mansion, the shadowy figure’s expression suddenly changed, but before he could speak, he calmed down.

Even though Hu Qing was powerful, he couldn’t capture the every move of a Tier 5 Emperor.

“Where is he?” Hu Qing scanned the surroundings, realizing that the scenery in the portrait was the same as this place.

Clearly, it had just been transmitted!

However, there was no trace of Jian Wushuang here; only Xia Mang Patriarch sat there sipping tea.

“l killed him. I brought you here just to inform you!” Xia Mang Patriarch’s demeanor changed, his gaze ice-cold, and his aura more ominous than before.

Killed?

Hu Qings face changed, and then he became furious for the first time, exclaiming, “You dare to kill an inheritor?”

“Hmph, why wouldn’t I dare? He was just a Dao Lord, and he killed my descendants, infiltrated the imperial city, and stole treasures. He deserved to die!” Xia Mang Patriarch gritted his teeth as he uttered the last three words.

Hu Qings aura suddenly surged, almost ready to attack.

This surprised Xia Mang, who stood up directly, with controlled anger, “If the conversation is not agreeable, you may leave!” “Oh, by the way, take his corpse with you!’

“l left him intact; it’s a courtesy to you.”

After saying this, Xia Mang Patriarch left the thatched house.

On the ground, Jian Wushuangs lifeless body appeared out of nowhere, devoid of any vitality, with his divine body disintegrating, and his origin source depleted.

It was eerily similar to what happened in the Great Desolate Wilderness.

Hu Qings eyes turned red, hands clasped together, silently uttering, “Virtuous! “
