Chapter 987: Wait for Me!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Farewell, Jian Wushuang!”

“Ever will I choose to be your wife again, if so a choice comes before me again.”

“I await you… in our future life!”

The last words of Leng Rushuang etched deep into Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“No!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

With a shrilling howl of pain, Jian Wushuang suddenly woke up. It had been seven days.

“You are up, Jian Wushuang.” It was the Gu King who had spoken through his mind.

Jian Wushuang rose sorely with a sullen face. “What of Leng Rushuang?”

“She is gone.” The Gu King said simply.

“Gone?” Jian Wushuang stammered as he nearly collapsed. But immediately he asked sharply. “You long knew it, do you, Gu King?”

“I am afraid I did.” The Gu King made no attempt to conceal.

Jian Wushuang took a deep and heavy breath, clenching his fists tightly as he murmured in a low voice, “Tell me. What happened?”

“It all began with the story of the Great Primordial Sinner.” The Gu King began his tale. “It was said that the Great Sinners in the entire Eternal Chaotic World are extremely evil and vicious such as the folk of the Blood Killing Sect. They would stop at nothing in order to achieve their motives, committing countless atrocities so vile and brutal that their sins began to accumulate. At length, they will gradually turn into Great Sinners.”

“These Great Sinners are estranged from the common folk by their depravities, and some champions of just and right will rise up against the Great Sinners to thwart them and slay them.”

“They become so by their own hands; the acts they committed and the blood they shed. Yet, there is another caste of Great Sinners: the Great Primordial Sinner, namely those such as your lover.”

“These are Sinners who bear the weight of the Great Primordial Sin which was inherited through generations.”

“Most Great Sinners reap the fruits that they sow by their own hands. But there is a very slim likelihood that a Great Sin is passed down to the next generation where one’s descendants will inherit the burden of retribution.”

“The influence of the Great Sin shouldered by one’s descendant will slowly erode all that is good of that descendant’s character and spirit. Eventually, the Great Primordial Sinner will turn into an evil that will even dwarf most other Great Sinners.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“The Great Primordial Sinners will turn extremely evil?”

“But despite her frosty demeanor, Leng Rushuang is hardly vicious nor evil…”

“As a Great Primordial Sinner, your lover should have long been devoured by the influence of the Great Sin and become an evil person. Perhaps it was her mother’s love for her… she might have cast an enchantment; a magical seal which had sustained her personality as long as it could.”

“The magic of the seal is most unusual. I wager that it should be the doing of Dao Yuanzi. It was by this very seal that your lover was hardly consumed by the influence of the Great Sin. Then again, the strength of a Great Sin’s influence is never to be overlooked. Dao Yuanzi’s magical seal would never be able to hold it for long. Moreover, the influence of the Sin has formed an alter ego within her.” The Gu King continued.

“An alter ego?” All of this was news to Jian Wushuang. “Do you mean there are two forms of consciousness within Leng Rushuang?”

“Yes.” The Gu King nodded. “One is the true consciousness of your lover, and the other is the alter ego formed by the influence of the Great Sin.”

Jian Wushuang found himself trembling. Suddenly, a stroke of realization hit him facefirst.

“Leng Ruxue?”

“Could it be Leng Ruxue?”

The odd notion hit him suddenly.

“Two forms of consciousness coexist within the same body, not unlike two tigers jousting for domination of a mountain. With the magical seal in her, your lover had been maintaining a distinct edge as she maintained the control her body. But nothing will be the same when the powers of the seal falter!”

“I have been observing your lover in secret since your return to the imperial city. The influence of the Great Sin has gnawed much of her. She can struggle for no longer and she is beyond salvation. Before long, the influence will devour her whole and her true personality will be extinguished. The old Leng Rushuang will fade into perpetual darkness and despair w-with… without being able to see the light of day!” The Gu King managed finally.

“What?” Jian Wushuang gasped with disbelief.

“Her true consciousness will fade into perpetual darkness and despair?”

“She will never be able to once again see the light of day?”

“That was the price of Leng Rushuang releasing the seal within her?”

“You had before implored me to stop her, Jian Wushuang…” The Gu King sighed. “It is useless. The terror within her will erupt once her consciousness has been fully subdued by the influence of the Great Sin.”

“Her strength will soar rapidly beyond imagination, so will her gift to unleash carnage and destruction!”

“It will be nothing short of disastrous and apocalyptic if she managed to survive!”

“Knowing fully well of this, she chose to leave you and also this world.”

Jian Wushuang could hardly hold his body that trembled with grief and agony.

“The Great Primordial Sinners are but a pitiful and miserable existence. But there is nothing you can do save to strengthen yourself and achieve true greatness and omnipotence like the Founder of the Star Bloodline and King Luo Zhen. Only then you are able to restrain her and save her.” The Gu King said to him seriously.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang exhaled deeply, calming himself.

What the Gu King had said was true.

As a mere warrior of the Eternal Realm, there were many others who wielded greater strength than him in the Green Fire World, let alone the rest of the countless others from vast Eternal Chaotic World.

Whereas the Great Primordial Sinners were existences that struck fear and horror across the planes of the Eternal Chaotic World for the terror and destruction they unleashed.

As he was now, Jian Wushuang was hardly capable of changing the fate of Leng Rushuang or helping her.

The only course of action laid before him, was to improve himself and slowly climb his way into greatness.

Only then could he be able to make a difference.

“Hardships and pain await those who tread the path to triumph. Never will it be easy for one to scale the cliffs of success, yet the challenge will hardly deter me.”

“Success will be mine, no matter how long it takes!”

“Be it tens of thousand years, hundreds of thousand years, or even longer!”

“The day will come, where I, Jian Wushuang, will make it to the top. Then I will be able to change everything!”

“Wait for me, Shuang’er!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted with hope as he clenched his fists so tightly that his nails bit deep into his flesh, a pain that would forever remind him of the vow he made this day.

Jian Wushuang was steeled with resolve and conviction.

He will embark on his quest to achieve the peak of Omnipotence, a quest where none would thwart him from!
