The ancient finger descended. No matter if it was Real God Jiu Gong or Real God Han Quan, they couldn’t withstand it.

Just then, a dim light suddenly plunged over from the nearby void. The dim light brought about a strong power and collided with the ancient finger like lightning.

Rumble. As heaven and earth quivered, the ancient finger that struck fear into every Real God at the scene suddenly shattered into pieces.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was fixed and looked in the direction that the dim light was shot.

The experts hidden in the nearby void looked in the same direction simultaneously. In their sights, there was a grey-robed elderly that slowly appeared.

The grey-robed elder with white hair and a ruddy complexion had a cold gaze that gave a dignified look.

He appeared and there was a unique aura that spread around. Suddenly, he became the focus of the universe.

“Almighty!”

There were many experts that couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

From the unique aura and his action that broke the ancient finger that Jian Wushuang had used with a mere wave, the identity of the incomer was obvious.

Looking at the incomer, Real God Han Quan looked thrilled. He quickly greeted politely, “Sir God Qian Lan!”

The grey-robed elderly nodded faintly as his figured moved over gradually.

As he moved closer, Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

Previously, no matter if it was Real God Han Quan or Real God Jiu Gong, he could deal with them easily and he couldn’t be bothered.

However, then, it was a true Almighty who came!

The experts hidden nearby sighed in astonishment.

No one had guessed that Soaring Heaven King Palace would throw in so much this round. Not only did Real God Han Quan teamed up with Real God Jiu Gong, he had even sent an Almighty to stay in the back.

Almighty was a super existence of Eternal Chaotic World.

In the ten sanctuaries, if any force were to have an Almighty to back them up, they would definitely be the top force. Even in Sanctuary Alliance, they would take a proper place.

Soaring Heaven King Palace had very few existences like that but they had even sent an Almighty to come over personally just to take care of Jian Wushuang.

The grey-robed elderly Sir God Qian Lan finally appeared on the battlefield. He stood next to Real God Han Quan.

“Han Quan is useless, send Sir God Qian Lan and to take care of this personally,” Real God Han Quan said softly.

He knew that Soaring Heaven King Palace had not only sent him to team up with Real God Jiu Gong to kill Jian Wushuang, they had also prepared a backup plan.

However, he didn’t know what the backup plan was. Until then, he had understood that the backup plan was Sir God Qian Lan.

“You can’t be blamed for this,” Sir God Qian Lan replied. His voice was calm and there was no intention of reprimand.

He had come to the void long ago but he was hidden in the dark. If an Almighty were to hide themselves intentionally, even Jian Wushuang’s soul power wouldn’t be able to probe to find him. Jian Wushuang naturally didn’t notice his arrival.

In the earlier scene where Real God Han Quan and Real God Jiu Gong had teamed up and fought against Jian Wushuang, he had watched clearly.

He knew that it wasn’t Real God Han Quan and Real God Jiu Gong being useless but Jian Wushuang being too powerful.

From the power that Jian Wushuang had displayed earlier, his fighting power could totally be listed in the top three on Real God ranking list. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Jian Wushuang.”

There was a cold voice and Sir God Qian Lan’s murky yet cold eyes glared at him. Simultaneously, there was a boundless power that instantly pressed towards Jian Wushuang.

The power was extremely strong but Jian Wushuang’s face didn’t change.

“It seems that it is a great honor of mine. Real God Han Quan and Real God Jiu Gong, who rank among the top on Real God ranking list, teamed up. Now, an Almighty has come. Soaring Heaven King Palace looks highly upon me,” Jian Wushuang chuckled. His laughter was obviously in disdain. Anyone at the scene could tell.

“Humph, I didn’t intend to come out. However, you are behaving too recklessly. You continuously kill Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace. If we can’t kill you, how can we stand on our feet in Sanctuary Alliance? So, even if I have to bear the bad name of bullying a young one, I will have to kill the outrageously arrogant man here!” Sir God Qian Lan’s voice was loud and bright. He sounded so staunchly righteous.

It was normal. An Almighty was normally concerned with their names.

Plus, between an Almighty and a Real God, the difference was too vast. Although Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator, he had yet to reach the level of a Chaotic Real God and he couldn’t be compared to an Almighty. If he who was an Almighty were to take action at Jian Wushuang personally, he was obviously bullying the young one. It would definitely be embarrassing if it were to spread.

Hence, Soaring Heaven King Palace had only sent Real God Han Quan and Real God Jiu Gong to kill Jian Wushuang at the beginning.

But then, there was no alternative. So, he revealed himself.

After all, him having his reputation damaged was better than the entire Soaring Heaven King Palace turning into a joke.

“Die, boy!”

Sir God Qian Lan didn’t bother to talk any more nonsense. He glared at Jian Wushuang coldly as though he was looking at a dead body.

Just as he stopped speaking, rumble. Heaven and earth shook.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew dim and he realized that the space surrounding him was shivering vigorously. Then, hualala. Large chunks of yellowish-brown air current swept out and formed stormy seas that covered him from all directions.

Jian Wushuang moved as he intended to dodge, but he realized that the yellowish-brown air current had engulfed the entire universe and there was no way he could avoid it.

Then, the yellowish brown air current crushed him with the power of universe madly.

From the view of the experts from the outside world, Jian Wushuang was drowned in a yellowish-brown prison. The prison was pressuring him savagely and there was a constant explosion from within.

Sir God Qian Lan stood there coldly as his gaze was covered with a chilly gleam.

As an Almighty, his strength was not only in his divine power or divine body, it included his comprehension of Power of Heaven Way too.

An Almighty’s comprehension of Power of Heaven Way could pass through level seven of Doctrine Palace. He could easily kill any experts on Real God ranking list.

It was also the difference between Almighty and Real God, a huge difference that couldn’t be crossed.

Just like his current technique, if he was fighting against Real God like Han Quan, he would have been dead long ago.

However, Jian Wushuang was not someone Real God Han Quan could be compared to after all.

Hong!

With a vigorous explosion, the yellowish-brown prison that was continuously shrinking formed a hole out of nowhere. From the hole, there was a huge dark golden arm that extended. As the dark golden arm tore madly, the yellowish-brown prison was torn with a big hole.
