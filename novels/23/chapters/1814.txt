Chapter 1815: Chillywind Valley

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The ancient battlefield where the Green Fire World was located had always been completely isolated from the outside world.

Even when tribes from the Jin King went there and died in the battle, the outside world knew nothing about it because the battlefield could not communicate with the outside world.

But now, Jian Wushuang had found that this battlefield could already communicate with the outside world.

He sent a message to Hall Master Yuan, and the latter received it and sent another back to Jian Wushuang.

“The time and space of this battlefield has completely changed.” Jian Wushuang looked up at the sky.

He knew that the change was due to a large array of time and space storms created by his master.

“Before the Qing Dynasty, it was completely isolated from the outside world, but now, at least it has allowed communication. I don’t know if this is good or bad.” Jian Wushuang felt worried and sighed.

After reporting the situation to Master Hall Yuan, Jian Wushuang went alone to the huge ancient battlefield, where he would spend a long time.

In the ancient battlefield, there were countless unique places, opportunities and also dangers, which were waiting for Jian Wushuang to explore.

The first place Jian Wushuang wanted to go was the Chillywind Valley!

It was the first place that Jian Wushuang had discovered and named.

It was also a mysterious place.

The Chillywind Valley was a huge, innocent pothole from which there would be a gush of chilly winds bursting out at regular intervals, just like a volcanic eruption.

When Jian Wushuang arrived there, he was almost killed by the bloody cold wind that suddenly sprouted.

Soon Jian Wushuang realized that some treasures with strong Yin power were hiding there.

It was very likely to be a Chaos Divine Treasure. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But unfortunately, the Chillywind Valley was too dangerous. When Jian Wushuang had been about to leave the Green Fire World 50,000 years ago. He had wanted to explore it, but he did not enter the valley.

Until now…

“I’m going to have a look.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the huge, dark hole in front of him with a smile.

He did not immediately enter the pothole, but waited for a while.

Bang!

The ground started to shake and the mountain swayed, and the violent roar sounded loudly. Then, Jian Wushuang saw the wind vented and smashed everything in the world.

It took ten breaths’ time to gradually subside.

After the wind dissipated, Jian Wushuang waved his hands and a group of bronze-armored Dao Soldiers appeared. They were controlled by Jian Wushuang’s consciousness.

“Go.”

Immediately, this bronze-armored soldiers did not hesitate to go directly into the Chillywind valley.

When Jian Wushuang had explored this Chillywind valley 50,000 years ago, he had tried his best to go down 100,000 miles toward the bottom of the valley, and then he had not dared to move forward again. But this time, the Dao Soldiers went 300,000 miles in one breath.

But still, Jian Wushuang couldn’t see the bottom. It was too deep.

By controlling the consciousness of the bronze-armor Dao Soldiers, he could clearly see everything that the soldiers encountered.

The soldiers continued to plunge for a million miles until the bottom of the valley was finally seen.

At the bottom of the valley, there was a piece of white jade!

A huge white jade!!

The surface of the jade was extremely smooth, but the most important thing was its power… The jade had extremely strong, yin-like power. Jian Wushuang could feel it so strongly even through the Dao Soldiers’ consciousness.

“Is this only a jade?” Jian Wushuang murmured, and guided the bronze-armored Dao Soldiers to approach.

Soon, he appeared in front of this jade, and he could see the jade.

“I have never seen this kind of jade?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Suddenly…

Jian Wushuang saw the inner layer of the jade, where there was a bright white light.

Jian Wushuang looked at the white light and finally, he realized something.

“It’s not a jade! It’s a person!”

But just as he saw the white light clearly, the figure covered in the white light also opened his eyes, and bloody lightning came out.

In an instant, the lightning passed through the jade and directly hit the body of the bronze-armored Dao Soldiers.

The bronze-armor Dao Soldiers were made by the blood essence of the Ancient Clan, and their bodies were extremely hard. However, under the bloody lightning, they were instantly shattered and the consciousness that Jian Wushuang had attached to them also went away.

“Wrong, I got it wrong!” Jian Wushuang realized.

“It’s not a treasure hidden in the bottom, but a strong man from ancient times!!”

“And I broke into the bottom of the yin wind and woke up the ancient strongman!!”

“Escape, hurry!”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate, and immediately turned and ran wildly.

Jian Wushuang felt alarmed by such ancient strongmen. Furthermore, the strongman was so strong.

After all, those Dao Soldiers were so tough that Jian Wushuang had found it hard to smash them. But the strong man had done it!

Obviously, he was far stronger than Jian Wushuang!

Jian Wushuang ran with full speed and soon, he suddenly stopped.

Because less than ten miles away there appeared a figure in the void.
