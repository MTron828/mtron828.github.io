4608 Old Master (2)

Even the most difficult past had been destroyed in those ultimate years.

His two pitch-black eyes reflected Jian Wushuang’s past life.

“Don’t look into my eyes. With your shallow experience, you’ll easily get lost in an illusion,” the black-water-robed figure who called himself Old Master warned in a deep voice.

Jian Wushuang suddenly woke up from the swamp-like memory and his temples were covered in sweat.

It was too strange and terrifying. What kind of existence was this old man?

“Kid, don’t try to figure me out. I can easily see through your thoughts.” A smile appeared on the old man’s sickly and pale face.

Jian Wushuang quickly abandoned all distracting thoughts and guarded his heart.

“You’re the only person I like other than my friends. So, I’m going to help you once,” Old Master said indifferently.

“Help me once? How can you help?” Jian Wushuang was confused and did not know what to do.

Old Master’s body suddenly turned into a handful of black water and fell into the Polar Sea. Then, he quietly condensed behind him and looked into the distance with his black eyes.

“From your consciousness, I know that the universe you exist in seems to be suffering a catastrophe. It is beyond everyone’s power, and it has completely fallen. It is only a matter of time before it is completely destroyed.”

“Now, I’ve decided to help you. I’m going to turn this hopeless situation around. Everything you’ve seen before will never happen again.”

The sudden help did not make Jian Wushuang lose his rationality. He pondered for a moment, looked up at Old Master, and asked, “What are the conditions?”

Old Master slightly raised the corner of his mouth. “There are two conditions. The first condition is very simple. Completely destroy the enemy universe, leaving no living beings behind.”

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled. The first condition was obviously the third option that he had mentioned earlier!

“What, you’re going back on your word now?” Old Master sneered.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. He stared at him and made up his mind. “I promise to do it. What’s the second condition?”

Old Master smiled in satisfaction. “Once you agree, it’s a contract that can’t be changed. As for the second condition, I’ll only say it after you’ve completed the first condition.”

After saying that, he flicked his finger and a drop of black water fell into Jian Wushuang’s right arm.

Jian Wushuang pulled up his sleeve in a hurry and saw a tear-shaped divine pattern on his right wrist.

As if sensing his worry, Old Master added, “This is a part of my consciousness, used for communication between you and me. It will do you no harm.”

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief, but he was still wary of this mysterious person.

Ignoring Jian Wushuang, Old Master turned around slowly and stared at the flowing pitch-black Polar Sea.

…

“Old Palace Master, let’s go!”

Amidst the boundless void energy, Ban Shan was bathed in blood. He sacrificed himself for the explosion and finally, he unleashed the most terrifying attack.

The mountains and rivers were crushed into fine powder by this attack.

However, this self-sacrificing attack was easily destroyed by Void Master Ba Huang!

The huge palm strike crushed Ban Shan.

Ba Huang, who was emitting a demonic blood light, had used some secret technique to take that step and reach the Half Ancestor realm.

“Hmph, I’ve long noticed that your motives are not pure. I originally planned to spare your life, but I didn’t expect you to chase after your own death.” As he casually dispelled the blood, Void Master Ba Huang curled his lips in disgust.

Then, he looked at Dao Yan, who was covered in blood and on the verge of death. His eyes flashed with desire.

“Ba Huang, this isn’t something you can touch.” Devour One’s cold voice came from behind.

Void Master Ba Huang hurriedly agreed and ran toward Snake God.

The black mist dissipated, and Devour One came to Dao Yan. “Give me your Comprehension, and I’ll spare your life for the time being.”

He coughed out a wisp of divine blood and looked at him calmly. “Everything I have belongs to the Divine Power Universe. Even if I die and my spirit is destroyed, you can forget about taking anything from me.”

“Why do you have to do this? Hand it over to me now, and I can still let you die with dignity. Otherwise, I can only kill you first and then extract your Comprehension inch by inch!” Devour One clenched his fist in the air, and Dao Yan’s body was immediately suspended in the air, while Chu Zhi hiding behind him fell on the deck.

Dao Yan was not afraid. He looked contemptuous.

“In that case, I’ll just take it.” Devour One did not speak anymore. He reached out to Dao Yan’s chest, and a red light flashed.

“Eh? Where is your Comprehension?” Devour One was confused.

Supreme Dao Yan laughed. “How ridiculous! I’ve said it before. The Void Universe can forget about touching any of my stuff!”

Devour One did not speak anymore. An infinite amount of red light rose and tore Supreme Dao Yan into pieces like a snake.

At this point, Dao Yan had fallen in the Void Universe.

Only a young man was left in the huge Cosmic Boat.

“I’m already like this, and you’re still so persistent. Do you really think I don’t have the power to retaliate?”

In the divine power cage, Snake God, who had recovered 70-80 percent of his power, looked coldly at the Void Master Ba Huang.

“With your current strength? You’re no match for me, even if you’re at your peak. Give me your Comprehension and I’ll let you die in a better way.” Ba Huang, who was at the peak of Half Ancestor realm, sneered.

Snake God fought like a trapped beast, and his void power rose up.

Ba Huang’s face turned cold and he raised his palm to slap Snake God.

Whoosh…

The Polar Sea trembled, and the water level suddenly rose thousands of feet. The waves surged, and two figures stepped on the tide.

J-Jian Wushuang?!

Snake God’s eyes widened and he felt as if he had just been reborn. Without thinking, he shouted, “Jian Wushuang! Elder Dao Yan and Elder Ban Shan have already died in their hands!”

“You’re too noisy!” A look of disgust flashed in Void Master Ba Huang’s eyes as he swung his palm at Snake God.

A bolt of divine power swept over and headed straight for Ba Huang! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As Ba Huang was forced to retreat, Jian Wushuang rushed forward and slashed at his right arm with the Tarot Divine Sword.

Swish…

Ba Huang’s entire right arm had been cut off!

Before he could scream, he was kicked away by Jian Wushuang again.

After putting away the Tarot Divine Sword, Jian Wushuang did not look at Snake God. He leaped onto the Cosmic Boat, having a strong premonition.

Devour One, who was hidden in the black mist, looked at Jian Wushuang calmly. “We meet again.”

“Stop bullsh*tting. Where are Elder Dao Yan and Elder Ban Shan?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and his palm was already on the hilt of the sword at his waist.

“Those two guys?” Devour One shrugged slightly. “I just killed them.”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank and he roared, “You deserve to die!”

Tens of thousands of Sword Intents shot up to the sky and pointed at Devour One!
