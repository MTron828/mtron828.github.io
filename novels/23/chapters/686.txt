Chapter 687: Slaughter

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

This confrontation had left Bing Ji frightened.

The strength Jian Wushang possessed was clearly beyond that of the Skyscraping Realm and made him, an advanced Divine Realm expert, very worried.

“Die!”

A sudden cry reverberated through Heaven and Earth as Jian Wushuang moved rapidly and once more appeared in front of Bing Ji. With an obvious intent to kill, Jian Wushuang struck violently with the Emperor Sword.

“Boy, don’t be too arrogant.”

There was anger in Bing Ji’s eyes. He yelled out as his palm, holding the saber, grew drastically once more. Its size and its power which had previously doubled, now quintupled.

The strength being generated obviously quintupled, too!

Until now quintuple strength was his limit.

“Sky-burying Skill!”

His face turned red as his Spiritual Power reached a new extreme and he attacked using the saber.

This attack was the strongest strike in his arsenal, and used up all his strength.

The void seemed to be cut open, and the power of the blade rushed forward with extreme force. The force was so strong that Jian Wushuang couldn’t help looking sideways, but a sneer appeared across his mouth. The Sword Heart, which had already become essence of his consciousness, was slightly shaken, and 70 percent of the Sword Heart power activated.

Sword Heart was capable of generating attacking power as Sword Soul.

But the power achieved with Sword Heart was much stronger than that achieved with Sword Soul.

Just 70 percent of Sword Heart power would be enough to make the power of Jian Wushuang’s strike to multiply by as much as ten times!

Bang!

As the opponents attacks collided, the winner of the confrontation appeared.

Disaster, the light of the sword light broke out and the waves spread. Bing Ji’s palm holding the saber tightly suddenly shook and his hand broke as his whole body fell backwards as though he had been hit by a cannonball.

“This, this...”

Bing Ji was stunned. He had never thought a day would come when a mere Skyscraping Realm cultivator could outclass him.

In fact, Jian Wushuang had spent the six years in sword mountain focusing on Sword Principle, but he had also made improvements on his physical form by virtue of some Natural Treasures. He had been studying the Bone Fusion Technique of the Immortality Secret Skill before, but now he had completed Stage One of the Blood Condensation Technique.

Although it was only the first stage, his body had become significantly stronger.

The combination of the Spiritual Power given by Heavenly Creation Skill and his increased physical strength meant that he could compete with an average Divine Realm expert now in strength alone. As for his understanding of Dao, he was at the same level as Bing Ji and possibly even stronger.

Bing Ji was more skilled than Jian Wushuang when using those secret skills which increased his strength. When his palm grew just now, the power exploded five times stronger than usual. Jian Wushuang was not qualified to practice such kind of secret skills now, but his Sword Heart had reached Level One. Once activated, only 70 percent of it was enough to increase his attacking ability tenfold.

In a situation where both opponents were almost the same in all other aspects,

one’s strength was multiplied by five while the other’s strength was improved tenfold, creating a huge gap.

Hence, Jian Wushuang could easily outclass Bing Ji even if he battled him head on.

Bing Ji couldn’t fight against Jian Wushuang, and he had no hope of defeating him in any other aspects.

“Escape, escape!”

Bing Ji no longer had the courage to fight Jian Wushuang, and fled hastily.

Of course, Jian Wushuang did his best to hunt him down. In terms of the life-saving ability, Bing Ji was not strong, so he couldn’t escape quickly, making it easy for Jian Wushuang to hunt him. When Jian Wushuang displayed his swordsmanship, Bing Ji fought back relentlessly, but in the end he was defeated.

Above Dan Yang City, the Divine Realm experts from the families, who had been watching all this, gasped when they saw Bing Ji attempting to flee, and were even more shocked to see Bing Ji’s lifeless corpse fall to the ground.

Although they were aware of Jian Wushuang’s unusual strength, none of them thought he could kill Bing Ji with his strength alone when he arrived.

However...

Not only did Jian Wushuang kill Bing Ji, but the battle had been so one sided.

Bing Ji, who had been too strong for all Divine Realm experts present to defeat, couldn’t fight against Jian Wushuang. The gap had been too big.

“This is an Ancient Sect disciple!”

“The legendary Ancient Sect disciple is actually quite exceptional!”

“A Skyscraping Realm cultivator killed an advanced Divine Realm expert head on! If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I would never believe it!”

The Divine Realm experts all marveled at it. After this incident, they had a new found respect for the Ancient Sect.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang who had put Bing Ji’s corpse into his Interspatial Ring turned to look at He Yun, informing him, “My task was only to kill Bing Ji. As for those people serving under him, you can deal with them yourself.”

Then he turned to leave. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As for those remaining Divine Realm experts that served under Bing Ji... without Bing Ji who was an advanced Divine Realm expert and Yuan Qian who had been killed by Jian Wushuang, they posed no threat, but the families had no intention of letting them go.

In the end, save for two very lucky Divine Realm experts that managed to escape, all the others were killed by these families.

Soon, harmony returned to Dan Yang City once more.

Of course, the fate of Dan Yang City had nothing to do with Jian Wushuang. He was only responsible for killing Bing Ji. After the mission was completed, he left and set off to the location of the second target of his mission.

“Next target, Chu Nan, a top intermediate Divine Realm expert!”

Jian Wushuang studied a mountain below. According to his information, Chu Nan was hiding in that mountain.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang dived toward the mountain.

The advanced Divine Realm expert Bing Ji was killed by Jian Wushuang and had no opportunity to flee, an intermediate Divine Realm expert would not pose much of a threat. Soon, Jian Wushuang flew out of the mountain and Chu Nan, who had been killed, was put in his Interspatial Ring.

Next, Jian Wushuang went toward his third target...

Slaughter!

Jian Wushuang was on a mission of slaughter.

Jian Wushuang had known the 11 targets’ locations, so it only took him some time to easily find them and directly kill them.
