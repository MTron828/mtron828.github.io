Chapter 3415 Serene Ancestor

In the hundred battle platform, Leaf Master had risen up again. However, at this moment, his face was extremely unsightly. He looked at Demon Master Chenhuo with a hint of fear.

He was very clear about what he had encountered in that instant. He had been forcefully crushed by his opponent’s power. His divine body was instantly damaged by more than 80%. That kind of absolute crushing power…he had only experienced it in the hands of his master.

“I only used less than 70% of the power of that slap just now,” Demon Master Chenhuo said coldly.

“70% of the power?” Leaf Master’s body trembled.

He had only used less than 70% of the power to destroy his ultimate move with a single slap. At the same time, it had damaged more than 80% of his divine body. If the other party had used all of his power, would not he be able to directly destroy his divine body with a single slap?

“The six realms of the void, and I’m afraid that they are very powerful among the six realms of the void. I’m afraid that they are not much weaker than my master.” Leaf Master exclaimed in his heart. At the same time, he also understood that he had been completely defeated in this battle, he was completely defeated.

Leaf Master did not feel dissatisfied or unsatisfied. He bowed slightly to Demon Master Chenhuo, then walked out of the hundred battle arena and returned to Xuan Master and the others.

“Xuan Master, the result of the third battle is obvious. The bloodline of the blood ancestor should have won the battle in the hundred-battle arena, right?” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

Xuan Master’s face was extremely ugly. He had never expected that the guard of Heavenly Sword Marquis was such a powerful expert of the sixth realm of the void. They had thought that they would win the third battle, but they had lost.

And now that the three battles had ended, the blood ancestor’s lineage had won two and drawn one. Naturally, they had won.

Although Xuan Master was unwilling, he could no longer change this solution.

But just as Xuan Master was about to open his mouth and admit that the blood ancestor’s lineage had won… “Hold on.” A grand voice suddenly transmitted over from the void not far away.

This voice seemed to contain a special magic power. As soon as it was transmitted to the hundred battle arena, it caused the hearts of many experts on the hundred battle arena to move. Subsequently, all gazes turned toward the source of the voice.

Over there, a middle-aged man dressed in black tight clothes, short hair, and stubble slowly walked over.

His footsteps were very light and very strange. Every step he took caused a black vortex to appear in the void below him.

As the black vortexes appeared one after another, this middle-aged man’s figure finally arrived on the hundred battle platform.

Upon seeing him, the many powerful warriors of the nether ancestor’s lineage revealed a look of pleasant surprise.

“Lord nether ancestor!”

Xuan Master, Master Flame Mountain, and the other Principles Masters of the nether ancestor’s lineage all bowed and greeted him with extremely respectful voices.

“Master.” Leaf Master also called out respectfully.

As for the surrounding powerful warriors who were watching the battle, when they saw him, they all revealed looks of reverence. Almost all of them also bowed to show their respect.

Serene Ancestor was one of the nine ancestors of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. Furthermore, he was one of the top three strongest experts among the nine ancestors. The Serene Ancestor lineage he established was also one of the four great sects of the heavenly ancestor lineage, it was named after the blood ancestor lineage at its peak.

And Serene Ancestor had another identity. He was Leaf Master.

For example, when Leaf Master fought with Demon Master Chenhua on the hundred battle arena, the first technique he used was taught by Serene Ancestor.

“Leaf Master, I saw your battle just now.” Serene Ancestor spoke.

“Master, it’s my fault for being useless.” Leaf Master could not help but lower his head. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“It’s not that I’m useless. It’s true that the opponent is too strong. For experts at the sixth level of the void, not only did they gain an additional portion of their will, they also fused three different types of law energy at the same time. You have to know that when the principles energy is fused, the power unleashed by fusing two different types of principles energy and three different types of law energy are worlds apart.” Serene Ancestor calmly spoke.

“Naturally, if you are able to comprehend the secret art that this seat imparted to you to a deeper level, reaching the third level, you would still be defeated when facing him. However, you wouldn’t be defeated in such a miserable manner.”

“Your disciple is enlightened.” Leaf Master respectfully acknowledged, not daring to refute.

“You can leave first.” Serene Ancestor waved his hand.

Leaf Master and the experts from Serene Ancestor’s lineage immediately retreated to the side. Serene Ancestor’s eyes turned towards deepfire devil master, who had already exited the hundred-battle arena.

“It’s one thing for a peak expert at the sixth level of the void to be willing to serve as a guard for an Immortal Saint, but you even intentionally concealed your strength to bully a fifth level of the void. Sir, aren’t you a little too careless with your status?” The nether ancestor spoke, however, his voice was ice-cold.

Upon hearing the nether ancestor’s words, the surrounding people felt their hearts turning cold.

“This Serene Ancestor is indeed just like the rumors say. He is truly protective of his own shortcomings!”

“His own disciple was defeated by a sixth level void martial artist who concealed his strength. It’s normal for Serene Ancestor to feel indignant. It’s normal for him to be protective of his own shortcomings!”

“Now, let’s see how the blood ancestor lineage, Heavenly Sword Marquis, and his guards will deal with Serene Ancestor.”

Many people were already discussing this matter in secret.

In the face of Serene Ancestor’s somewhat cold gaze, Demon Master Chenhuo’s expression did not change in the slightest, he said indifferently, “This old man will serve as the guard of Heavenly Sword Marquis. That is something that we are willing to do. It has nothing to do with you, Serene Ancestor. As for saying that this old man deliberately concealed his strength to bully your disciple… perhaps I do not pay attention to my status, but it is still much better than a fifth level void realm expert of your Serene Ancestor lineage fighting with an Immortal Saint and ending in a draw, right?”

“You really know how to do it, but I don’t know if your strength is as good as your mouth,” Serene Ancestor said coldly.

“You can try. It’s been a long time since I’ve loosened my muscles and bones,” said Demon Master Chenhuo calmly without any fear.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang only smiled faintly.

Although Serene Ancestor was very famous and powerful, Demon Master Chenhuo was even more powerful!

You should know that you ancestor had reached the peak of the six void realms and was very close to the level of Elder Dark Bone. In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, if Serene Ancestor really fought, he would be asking for humiliation.

As expected, what happened next proved Jian Wushuang’s guess.

In the void, the two sides did not even enter the hundred-battle arena, but Serene Ancestor and Demon Master Chenhuo had already fought.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Serene Ancestor’s body shook, and a large amount of dark clouds rose up. Serene Ancestor’s body also turned into darkness and merged into the dark clouds.

It was exactly the same as the skill of Leaf Master. However, when Serene Ancestor used the dark clouds, the color and thickness of the dark clouds were obviously much denser, and the area covered by the dark clouds was much wider. In terms of power…this dark cloud was at least dozens of times stronger.
