Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

A breath’s time was very short.

With such a short amount of time, Jian Wushuang was only able to use a limited number of moves as the Star Power would have run out by then.

If he wished to use it again… he would need a total of eight hundred years.

Previously, for the first volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, Jian Wushuang had needed ten years’ time to recover before he could use it again.

However, the second volume was more demanding than the first volume. After using it, Jian Wushuang would need eight hundred years’ time to recover the Star Power that had been used up completely.

“This move can be said to be one of my strongest trump cards. From now on, unless there is a need to, I had better not use this move,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Oh right.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and with a flip of his hands, he took out an item from the Qian Kun Ring of Real God Shi Jue.

That item was the special token that Real God Shi Jue had taken out at the pub to show Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin previously.

The token emitted a unique aura and it also had a peculiar design. Jian Wushuang was unable to recognize what the item was.

“King of Venomous Worms, do you know what this token is?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“If I’m not wrong, this token should be the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy,” the King of Venomous Worms said bluntly.

“Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy? What’s that?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“I don’t need to say much about this as you can ask the experts in the Lineage of Star later on. They will definitely know of the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. Moreover, they are more knowledgeable about this than me,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. After that, he sent a message to Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan immediately. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Atop a lofty mountain, Jian Wushuang was waiting quietly in his position. After waiting for some time, Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan hurried over.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan went in front of Jian Wushuang. After taking a look at him in detail, they heaved a sigh of relief, “It’s great that you’re alright.”

“Oh right, what happened to Real God Shi Jue?” Real God Wu Liang questioned.

“He’s dead,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Dead?” Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan were stunned. Real God Wu Liang then asked: “Did you kill him?”

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“How is that possible?” Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan found it a bit unbelievable.

It must be known that Real God Shi Jue was very close to a Peak Eternal Real God. Moreover, his ability to stay alive was very impressive. Even if Real God Wu Liang were to have a one-to-one fight with him, he had no guarantee that he could kill him.

However, Jian Wushuang had actually used his own abilities to kill him?

“Jian Wushuang, how did you kill him?” Real God Wu Liang questioned.

“As for that,” after muttering to himself for some time, Jian Wushuang said: “To tell you the truth, I used the Secret Skill of Star Palace and killed him with one stroke.”

“Even though you have used the Secret Skill of Star Palace to raise your attack power by ten times, shouldn’t Real God Shi Jue have been able to block it, albeit with some difficulty?” Real God Wu Liang frowned.

“What I used was the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang said.

As soon as the words left his mouth, Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan opened their eyes wide.

“The… the second volume?” Real God Wu Liang was dumbfounded.

“How is that possible?” Real God Fei Yan had an expression which implied that he found it unbelievable.

“Is there a problem?” Jian Wushuang asked with uncertainty.

He had only said that he had used the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Hence, was there a need for the two deacons in front of him to be so astonished?

Real God Wu Liang took a deep breath and suppressed his astonishment. He then looked at Jian Wushuang deeply and spoke: “Jian Wushuang, you should also know that the Secret Skill of Star Palace is one of the Lineage of Star’s four Secret Skills. Not only is it the strongest Secret Skill, it is only the most reputable Secret Skill. Moreover, the Star Palace disciples and the deacons of the Lineage of Star have all cultivated this Secret Skill.”

“For example, Elder Fei Yan and I have both cultivated the Secret Skill of Star Palace. However, it is not so easy to cultivate this Secret Skill.”

“In particular, the first volume is still manageable. As long as one works hard, they would most likely be able to cultivate it. However, many experts of the Lineage of Star have stopped at the first volume as there is an extremely small possibility of cultivating the second volume. For example, Elder Fei Yan and I, as well as many deacons of the Lineage of Star, have only been able to cultivate the first volume.”

“As for the second volume, within the Lineage of Star, there are currently only two people who have successfully cultivated the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace. These two people are Lei Chao and Hall Master Yuan!”

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang had a puzzled expression.

He finally knew why Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan were so surprised after learning that he had successfully cultivated the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

Among the many Real Gods in the Lineage of Star, only Lei Chao and Hall Master Yuan had successfully cultivated the second volume. At that very moment, he had successfully cultivated it as well?

“Is the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace very difficult?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had remembered very clearly that when he was cultivating the second volume of the Secret Skill, he did not come across a very big bottleneck and it could be said that he had cultivated the Secret Skill very easily.

He had originally thought that everyone else was the same as him. However, looking at it at that very moment, that was not the case.

“Jian Wushuang, from now on, you should be the third expert below an Almighty to successfully cultivate the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace in the Lineage of Star. Moreover, you are still a Universe God,” Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan looked at each other and their eyes were filled with envy.

The Secret Skill of Star Palace could be said to be the trump card of many experts of the Lineage of Star.

Deacons like them had always yearned to cultivate the second volume. With that, when they were in a critical moment, the Secret Skill would be extremely useful. However, it was a pity that they had always been unable to cultivate it successfully.

“If that’s the case, doesn’t that mean that the third volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace would be even more difficult?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Yes, it’s even more difficult,” Real God Wu Liang nodded his head, “Since the founding of the Lineage of Star until now, the Palace Master seems to be the only person who has managed to cultivate the third volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace successfully.”

“Hehe,” Jian Wushuang gasped.

“Elder Wu Liang and Elder Fei Yan, after I killed Real God Shi Jue, I obtained a token from his Qian Kun Ring. As this token is quite special, could the both of you help me to take a look?” as Jian Wushuang spoke, he took out the token.

As soon as Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan saw the token, their eyes became stuck to it.

“This… this is the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy?”

“This is indeed the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. Jian Wushuang, you got this from Real God Shi Jue?”

Real God Wu Liang looked toward Jian Wushuang at once.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Gosh, this luck of yours… I’m really envious of it,” Real God Wu Liang exclaimed with admiration.

“You have managed to cultivate the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace successfully. Now, you have obtained the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. You’re really…” as Real God Fei Yan gasped, his eyes, which were looking at the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, were filled with excitement.

However, Jian Wushuang had obtained the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy after killing Real God Shi Jue. No matter how excited they were, they would not allow themselves to be taken over by greed.
