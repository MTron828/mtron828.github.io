Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jingle!

The gate of the pitch-black palace suddenly opened. Jian Wushuang immediately looked inside, but there was only darkness.

“Go in,” the absolute beauty said.

Jian Wushuang breathed deeply and then entered the palace without hesitation. The absolute beauty and the strong man followed him.

The palace was still in total darkness and nothing was visible.

“What is the test of the Ancestor’s Land?” Jian Wushuang frowned and looked around.

“Little guy, are you ready? The test is... coming.” The voice of the absolute beauty came from behind him.

Although Jian Wushuang heard her voice, he couldn’t see her.

However, as the absolute beauty finished it, suddenly...

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Three roars reverberated in the palace. Jian Wushuang felt an unprecedented and horrible murderous gaze coming toward him. Rumble... Jian Wushuang’s brain roared instantly.

“Damn it!”

“All of the people belonging to Blood Feather Tower have to die! Kill them!”

“All of you have to die!”

With eyes instantly turning ruddy, Jian Wushuang roared and his face awfully contorted.

“Ahhhhh!”

A deafening sound echoed and Jian Wushuang’s mind was imbued with killing intent.

The killing intent was extraordinarily huge. This time, it was engulfing Jian Wushuang’s heart and seemed to have covered his whole heart and body.

At the moment when the terrific killing intent burst out, Jian Wushuang was still forced to retain a vestige of awareness.

He continued to roar with his head in his hands. His veins were accentuated, but his eyes still showed a vestige of awareness.

It was this vestige of awareness that allowed him to keep a cool head. Otherwise, he would become a demon.

However, at this point...

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Another three roars echoed in the palace.

The three roars contained more terrific killing intent than before.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew scarlet, but at this point, he bit the tip of his tongue and dug his fingernails into his palms. The sharp pain generated by the flowing blood made his fading awareness appear again.

Zoom... Everything disappeared suddenly.

The killing intent which filled his brain and engulfed everything disappeared.

Jian Wushuang’s sight slowly became clearer, but his body was bent with his head?down as he breathed deeply.

Although it was very transient, Jian Wushuang felt that he had died twice.

The killing intent was incredibly terrifying and occupied his body and heart. Fortunately, after so many years of experience, his heart was stronger than warriors at the same level, thus he could keep himself awake.

Otherwise, if his whole body and heart were occupied by the killing intent, he would become a bonafide madman who only knew how to kill. At this point, it would hard to awaken again.

“Little guy, how about that?” A figure emerged at Jian Wushuang’s side. It was the absolute beauty.

“Was this the first test of the Ancestor’s Land?” Jian Wushuang slightly raised his head and looked at the absolute beauty. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hmm, no, it wasn’t. I would not require you to come until you reached the Yin Void Realm if that was the first test.” The absolute beauty sneered. “What you suffered was the first step of the first test. It was only the beginning.”

“If you couldn’t pass it, you would be unable to take the real test.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned instantly, but the determination in his eyes was no less than before.

“Haha, your temper is the same as your father’s. Both of you are indomitable.” Seeing Jian Wushuang’s eyes, the absolute beauty smiled slightly. Then she appeared in a corner of the palace and waved, causing a door to appear in the dark palace.

“This is the real first test of the Ancestor’s Land. Get in,” the absolute beauty said.

Jian Wushuang stood up. After his state had slowly recovered, he entered the door.

As soon as Jian Wushuang entered, the door closed instantly. This time, the absolute beauty and the strong man did not follow Jian Wushuang.

However... in fact, he was still in the palace and in front of the absolute beauty and the strong man, but he was oblivious to this.

“This guy has entered the Illusory Realm of Slaughter.” Seeing Jian Wushuang looking around ignorantly in front of her, the absolute beauty said seriously.

“Once entering the Illusory Realm of Slaughter, what he sees is an illusion. I don’t know whether he can distinguish this,” the strong man said.

The absolute beauty said coldly, “He may lose himself anytime for what he feels is very real, and he has to stay in the illusion for a long time even if he knows that it is an illusion.

“What is most important is that the aim of the test of the Illusory Realm of Slaughter isn’t whether he can distinguish between reality and illusion or not. He has great talent, but it’ll be hard to pass it.

“According to the rule of the Ancestor’s Land, if he doesn’t pass it, what we should do is kill him.”

The Ancestor’s Land had its rule.

In the three tests of the Ancestor’s Land, the first one was the most rigorous. You must die if you took it but failed.

However, the second and the third test were not rigorous like the first one. If someone did not pass them, he would still be alive, although he would not have another chance to take them.

“It’s highly possible for him to pass it because he has comprehended the Origin,” the strong man said.

“Maybe,” the absolute beauty said and then they silently waited for Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang...

Upon entering the door, he was in the illusion.

What he found was that he was in a paradise.

He was in a quiet and peaceful village. There was no discord nor slaughter, but peace.

The sun was setting, and the smoke curled slowly from the chimney in the village.

Jian Wushuang appeared in the gate of the village. He was ignorant and looked around.

“Where am I?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He didn’t know where he was but he knew his identity and that he took the first test in the Ancestor’s Land.

The quiet and peaceful village should be the testing scene.

“This is... an illusion?”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.
