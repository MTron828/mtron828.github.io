“For my safety? What do you mean?” Su Hong looked doubtful.

“You have stayed in the Floating City for a total of ten years time with Hong Ri Mercenary Group and, if I’m not mistaken, Hong Ri Mercenary Group should have recruited some new members in the past ten years. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes,” Su Hong nodded, “Hong Ri Mercenary Group escorted me to Floating City and they encountered danger too and lost some men. Hence, during the ten years we stopped at Floating City, they recruited more men. Not many; about ten of them.”

“Exactly.”

Jian Wushuang said coldly, “The boundless void was huge. Finding the existence of our troop in the boundless void is like looking for a needle in a haystack. If I were to be an expert from the Chu Sect in Su Family, I’d definitely keep an eye on your since you arrived at Floating City. I would also assign experts to blend into your troop. Then, even when you’re in the boundless void, the expert that Chu Sect sent would be able to find you easily and kill you!”

“What?” Su Hong was shocked, “You mean there’s a possibility that the expert that Chu Sect sent is among the people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group?”

“Not possibly. Definitely,” Jian Wushuang stole a glance at Su Hong, “That’s also why my identity and power naturally should be kept secret. Then, when the expert that Chu Sect sent appears, I can at least take the initiative.”

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, Su Hong’s face grew grave, “Jian Wushuang, according to what you said, the expert that Chu Sect sent could interrupt and kill us at any time. Aren’t we in danger?”

“Exactly. But you shouldn’t be worried. My task is to escort you to Purple Moon Sanctuary safely. Before you arrive in Purple Moon Sanctuary, I won’t let anyone hurt you,” Jian Wushuang said.

Su Hong looked at Jian Wushuang and recalled his identity. He then nodded heavily.

There was a disciple of Star Palace escorting him personally, he felt at ease.

The spaceship continued to plunge forward in the boundless void.

That very moment, a far distance from the spaceship, there were countless figures standing in the vast void.

These people were Universe Gods. The one leading was a bald man carrying a saber on his back.

Although the bald man was just a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, his aura was much fiercer than anyone of the same level.

“Mu Tao, this should be the first time you’re out for a hunt after you joined Hei Longshan, right?” The bald man looked at the purple-haired young man who was pale.

“Yes,” the purple-haired young man nodded faintly.

“We Hei Longshan is different from the Ancient Moon Island that you were at. If we were to take action later, you’d better watch closely and learn. Then, you might have a chance to take the position to be head,” the bald man smiled widely.

“Yes,” the purple-haired young man nodded again.

The purple-haired young man was peak Universe God in the Third Heaven who just joined Hei Longshan.

Before that, the purple-haired young man was one of the heads in Ancient Moon Island. Unfortunately, Ancient Moon Island was destroyed not long ago.

“Oh, yeah, I’m curious,” the bald man spoke again, “Although Ancient Moon Island couldn’t be compared with Hei Longshan, you’re one of the strong forces among bandit groups in the boundless void. Who was the one who destroyed all of you? Could it really be a Real God expert that took action?”

“Not a Real God, merely a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. However, the Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven is definitely one of the scariest Universe Gods that I’ve ever seen!” Mu Tao said as his face filled with unconcealed terror. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Oh?” The bald man raised his eyebrows but didn’t ask further.

Just then…

“Boss, the prey is here.”

A message was sent and the bald man beamed with joy when he received the message.

“Haha, everyone, follow me!”

As the bald man laughed maliciously, the crowded figures plunged forward to the void before them.

On the huge spaceship, Universe Gods of Hong Ri Mercenary Group were still chatting when Jian Wushuang, who was sitting in the cabin with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes.

“What happened?” Su Hong looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Someone is coming. Many people.” Jian Wushuang said calmly. His Soul Power could sense a large amount of aura approaching.

“Many?” Su Hong’s face grew grave, “Would they be the experts that Chu Sect sent? They reached us so quickly?”

“Not sure if they are experts that were sent, or bandits that are in the boundless void. In short, they have no good intentions,” Jian Wushuang said.

Su Hong’s face grew solemn and he immediately got out from the cabin.

“Group Leader Yu Gang!”

Su Hong came before Yu Gang and said, “Quick, be prepared. There’s an incoming enemy.”

“Incoming enemy? Where? Why don’t I see them?” Yu Gang immediately looked out at the void. He spread his consciousness but he couldn’t sense any figures.

Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group looked confused too.

“This…” Su Hong creased his eyebrows. He didn’t see anyone outside too.

“Su Hong, are you getting too nervous?” Yu Gang joked.

“No, no. Jian Ke said it,” Su Hong explained.

“Him?” Yu Gang sneered, “We at the decks didn’t even see any shadows of the incoming enemy. How could he know from the cabin? Don’t listen to his nonsense.”

“But…” Su Hong wanted to say something.

Vroom. Suddenly, there was a crowd of darkness approaching from the void faraway. They were churning forward like a dark cloud.

Then, everyone on the spaceship noticed.

“There’s really someone?”

“Many – so many of them, and they’re all Universe Gods!”

“This, this is…”

Then, the members of Hong Ri Mercenary Group looked terrified.

There were too many of them. There was at least two thousand of them when they looked over the crowd.

The aura of the two thousand people was strong. None of them was lower than a Universe God. Among the dark clouds, there were hundreds of Universe Gods in the Third Heaven with stronger auras.

There were even eighteen Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven!

It was a terrifying formation!

The dark cloud was obviously coming at them. Very soon, they stopped before the spaceship.

There was a formation with a total of two thousand Universe Gods blocking before the spaceship, which blocked their way.

There were a few thousand gazes looking at the spaceship.

The members of Hong Ri Mercenary Group saw the scene outside the spaceship and they gulped. There was a tinge of fear from the bottom of their hearts.

Even the group leader of Hong Ri Mercenary Group, Yu Gang, looked rather distressed.
