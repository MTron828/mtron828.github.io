Chapter 2793: Leave It to Me!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Ba Xiong, I didn’t expect you to have already broken through to the level of a peak great deity?”Elder Tong’s voice was ice-cold.

“Haha, you’re not the only one who’s Lucky.”The blood-robed middle-aged man, Ba Xiong, smiled coldly, “Old Monster Tong, you’ve stayed at the advanced great deity level for so many years, and you’ve tried to break through so many times. In the end, you’ve all failed, but you actually succeeded this time? And with your character, you actually listened to the Sword Union? “If I’m not wrong, it must be this sword union that helped you break through. Moreover, the Sword Union should have given you an extreme royal golden core!”

“With your ability, only by obtaining an extreme royal golden core can you have a chance of breaking through. Otherwise, you’ll probably be stuck at the advanced great divine master level for the rest of your life.”

“Aren’t you the same?”Elder Tong said coldly.

“Yes, it’s the same. Your Luck isn’t bad. The Sword Union gave you an extreme emperor golden core, but my luck isn’t as good as yours. Not long ago, Palace Master Nan Wu also obtained an extreme emperor golden core, and Palace Master Nan Wu gave it to me. Because of this, I was able to break through and reach the peak great deity level. And as a condition, I’ll be a consecrator of the Nan Wu Palace for 10,000 years. During this period, if Palace Master Nan Wu has anything to ask of me, I naturally can’t refuse.”Ba Xiong said with a smile.

“Is that so?”Elder Tong and everyone present understood.

Jian wushuang’s face darkened slightly.

Nan Wugong had indeed obtained an aurous core of the royal realm, which had been auctioned right under his nose.

He had never known what Nan Wugong had done with the aurous core of the royal realm, but now it seemed that Palace Master Nan Wugong was also very clever. He had used an aurous core of the royal realm to hire a powerful helper.

Ba Xiong was slightly stronger than Elder Tong when he was at the senior great divine master level. Now that he had broken through to the peak great divine master level, his battle strength was naturally slightly stronger than elder Tong. Yin Su’er and elder Tong worked together.., it was already very difficult to deal with Palace Master Nan Wu, and with Ba Xiong... They would naturally be crushed.

“Yin Su’er, you probably didn’t expect it, right? You’re not the only one who has prepared a backup plan for this battle.”Palace Master Nan Wu also sneered.

Yin Su’er and elder Tong’s expressions were extremely unsightly.

But at this moment..

“Yin Su’er, you’re seriously injured and your battle strength has been greatly reduced. It’s no longer suitable for you to fight with Palace Master Nan Wu. I’ll leave the East God to You!”Jian Wushuang’s voice suddenly rang out.

At this critical moment, Jian Wushuang no longer humbly called Yin Su’er as his lord. Instead, he directly called her by her name. Even his tone was somewhat unquestionable.

“Elder Tong, I’ll leave Ba Xiong to you. Your injuries are light, so he shouldn’t be able to do anything to you in the short term,”Jian Wushuang said again.

Upon hearing this, Yin Su’er and elder Tong were both surprised.

“Jian Yi, we’ve fought against Dong Shen and Ba Xiong respectively. What About Palace Master Nan Wu? “He’s the strongest among all the people present. If we don’t find someone to stop him, he’ll probably be able to kill all the Great Divine Masters in our camp,”Yin Su’er said in a deep voice.

“Yes, although Ba Xiong and Dong Shen are difficult to deal with, Palace Master Nan Wu is the most terrifying,”elder Tong said solemnly.

“Don’t worry, just do as I say. As for Palace Master Nan Wu... Leave It to me!”Jian wushuang said in a deep voice.

“What?”

Yin Su’er and elder Tong were both shocked.

Leave him to deal with Nan Wu Palace, who could not even be defeated by the two of them working together?

Was he kidding?

“Listen to me. Hurry up, or it will be too late,”Jian wushuang shouted.

Hearing this, Yin Su’er and elder Tong looked at Jian wushuang deeply.

Although they had many doubts and did not think that Jian wushuang could stop palace master Nan Wu, at this critical moment, they could not afford to delay any longer. If they delayed any longer, the entire battlefield would be at a greater disadvantage.

Immediately, the two people moved.

Yin Su’er directly attacked the East God.

She was stronger than the East God. Although she was seriously injured, the east god was more seriously injured, so it was easy for her to suppress the East God.

As for Elder Tong, he was also fighting with Ba Xiong.

In the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang had already arrived in front of palace master Nan Wu.

“Sword One!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Palace Master Nan Wu crossed her arms and stared at Jian Yi. Then she glanced at the miserable-looking eastern God and could not help smiling, “You seriously injured eastern God? It seems that I have underestimated you. When you fought with the Heaven Void Palace, Blood Thunder King, and the others, you didn’t use your full strength.”

“I see. But you didn’t use your full strength when you fought with Yin Su’er and elder Tong, did you?”Jian wushuang stared at Palace Master Nan Wu.

The corners of palace master Nan Wu’s mouth curled up, but she did not say anything.

“Do you think you can stop me by yourself?”Palace Master Nan Wu said with a condescending tone.

“How would I know if I don’t try?”

Jian wushuang smiled indifferently, but he did not waste any more words. With a wave of his hand, the giant black wood formed by the nine Netherblood Divine Swords appeared immediately. The vast power of reincarnation filled the air, and the giant black wood carried a shocking power, under Jian Wushuang’s full power, it suddenly rushed out.

It was like a giant black meteorite that fiercely charged toward palace master Nan Wu.

“What a joke!”

Palace Master Nan Wu smiled disdainfully and suddenly flipped his right palm.

He casually slapped the black meteorite.

The fierce and powerful black meteorite instantly stopped in the void, and then flew backward. It took a long time for it to calm down.

Palace Master Nan Wu stood in the void and did not move. After he struck the Samsara Sword Formation, he looked at his palm and slightly raised his eyebrows, “As expected of someone who can seriously injure the east god. The power of your sword formation is indeed not weak. With this sword formation alone, you can already suppress many peak great divine paragons. Unfortunately, you met me.”

With that, Palace Master Nan Wu waved his hand again.

This time, he did not take it lightly. Instead, he struck out with his palm. A layer of black divine thunder surged in the center of his palm. This black divine thunder contained the power to destroy the world. As he struck out with his palm, the world suddenly exploded.

Endless Black Divine Thunder blotted out the sky and covered the earth. In the blink of an eye, it formed a white and Tall Thunder Beast.

The Thunder Beast roared crazily and attacked Jian wushuang.

“Go!”

Jian wushuang’s eyes were cold. He once again drove the reincarnation sword formation and rushed out.

Behind him, the 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor also burst out a dazzling golden light. The same black giant tree attacked, and its power was slightly stronger than before.

Jian wushuang had used all of his strength in this attack.
