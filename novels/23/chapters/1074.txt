Chapter 1075: Defeat!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The shining sword light carried the terrifying power of the sun.

This was Heaven’s Bane of the creative Scarlet Yang Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang had tailored for himself.

As the terrific power burst, Celestial Master Winter Whistle wielded his saber instantly. The Saber Technique was also outrageous. After the two powers collided, Celestial Master Winter Whistle quivered and sank slightly.

“Nine Waves!”

Celestial Master Winter Whistle displayed the the creepy Saber Technique again.

Jian Wushuang felt as if he was floating in the sea and the endless waves were striking him again and again.

“One Force Break all Techniques, break it now!”

Jian Wushuang had cold eyes and a ferocious expression. Suddenly the power of the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand skyrocketed.

It was still Heaven’s Bane, but this time, the power was clearly greater.

Bump!

The endless waves were pushed to either side, and the whole sea seemed to be completely split into two halves.

“How could it be?” Celestial Master Winter Whistle was astonished.

Jian Wushuang then took a step and the Death Shadow Sword swept across like lightning.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Body was in a fierce fight with Silver-armored Ancient God. Both of them had a huge body, however, without Blood-killing Plate Armor, the Slaughter Body was less powerful than Silver-armored Ancient God. While he kept fighting against Silver-armored Ancient God, he could only rely on the killing strategies and combine them with the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was ferocious and had an amazing speed. It trapped Silver-armored Ancient God in a short time.

The two battlefields were fierce. Onlooking experts in the distance were shocked.

“Boy!”

“Is this the actual strength of Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s spectacular, Jian Wushuang is so strong.”

“Both the Original Body and the doppelganger are so aggressive!”

Although his Ancient God Power had reached Third Star Level, his Cultivation of Spiritual Power was only in the Eternal Realm. His battle strength is already so strong? How would it be when he becomes a Dao Master?”

“Jian Wushuang has already carved out his own path, and there is more than one, but he hasn’t reached Dao Master. What is he planning? He wants to be stronger. When he reaches the level of Dao Master one day, he will have greater strength and potential!”

“This guy is really a monster!”

Exclamations were heard from the onlookers.

Jian Wushuang’s strength made everyone witnessing the battle exclaim.

He was too dazzling!

Such an exceptional genius!

The strength he showed did not seem to be in the Eternal Realm. It was hard to believe that a guy who was only about 2,000 years old could possess such strength.

“This guy…”

Jian Nantian had been standing silently in the void, looking at the battlefield ahead.

He had been watching from the start. Though he looked indifferent and serene, a trace of a smile was concealed in his heart.

He was obviously proud that his son had so much strength at such a young age.

“Shuang’er is much more outstanding than I am. There are many things that I am not able nor eligible to achieve, but he is.

“I still have Meng’er, who is also his concern and willimpose an impact on his growth. When this event comes to an end, I will travel across the Green Fire World with Meng’er and live a peripatetic life without any concern. It’ll be up to him how far he could go!”

Jian Nantian had much expectation of Jian Wushuang’s future.

He knew very well that his own potential had been suppressed too much in his junior period, which damaged his foundation. He had lost the ability to mount to the peak of the Eternal Chaotic World, but Jian Wushuang would be able to achieve it.

Jian Nantian shook his head and did not think much about it. His eyes turned cold again, and then he glanced at Celestial Master Ku Xin in the camp of the Ancient Monster Clan.

As if sensing Jian Nantian’s gaze, Celestial Master Ku Xin looked straight back at him.

Jian Nantian moved.

Step by step, he moved forward slowly.

Each step caused some ripples in the void as if tablets of stone were dropped into a lake. The ripples kept expanding.

The entire world was in complete silence. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Aside from Jian Wushuang, who was in a heated fight with Celestial Master Winter Whistle and Silver-armored Ancient God, all of the experts were attracted by the ripples. They could not stop looking at Jian Nantian.

Jian Nantian was indifferent and detached before, but now he had changed.

He had completely changed.

Under everyone’s gaze, he turned from a mass of air into a lofty Sword Mountain emitting enormous Sword Essence.

The Sword Mountain looked like an antiquity that had existed since the ancient times.

It reflected the vicissitudes of life and was lofty, illuminating the whole world like a red sun.

Everyone was staring at the Sword Mountain, and each of them had amazement in their eyes.

“What, what kind of skill is it?”

“That was a grotesque and unique scene!”

“It’s the Principle, it’s the Sword Principle!”

“What Sword Principle is it, exactly? It makes me feel so weird.”

Everyone looked at Jian Nantian in fright.

Celestial Master Ku Xin was also staring at Jian Nantian from the Ancient Monster Clan. He had astonishment in his eyes. “Is the strongest Sword Principle one of the three Principles that Jian Nantian has cultivated?”

The strongest Sword Principle!

Celestial Master Ku Xin’s heart skipped a beat when he heard those four words.

That was the legendary Principle. Throughout the history of the whole Green Fire World, there were only a few people who could cultivate the strongest Sword Principle.

Ordinary people could never cultivate the strongest Sword Principle.

How could Jian Nantian have cultivated the strongest Sword Principle when he was only about 2,000 years old?

“Impossible, that’s impossible!”

Celestial Master Ku Xin shook his head madly. It took him a while to calm down.

At this moment, Jian Nantian, still under the gaze of everyone, stopped moving. He stood in front of Celestial Master Ku Xin, and the distance between the two men was less than 100 Li.

It was such a short distance that Jian Nantian could cover it with one step.

“Celestial Master Ku Xin, play your tricks,” Jian Nantian said coldly.

Celestial Master Ku Xin’s pupils contracted slightly.

He had come fully prepared this time in order to cope with Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang, and had lots of trump cards ready to use.

Clan-defending Formation and Ancient God tactical formation, for example, were just two of the trump cards.

They were just the tip of the iceberg in the Ancient Monster Clan.

If nothing else, his existence was a Sky-Supporting Pillar in the Ancient Monster Clan.

The battle strength of a Celestial Master’s Exceptional Realm would not be easily exceeded.

“This old man wants to see how strong you are as the Supervisor of Samsara Temple. How dare you challenge Heaven-ceasing Mountain!”

Celestial Master Ku Xin said in a cold voice. As he finished talking, a soaring aura burst out from his body.

Celestial Master Ku Xin, who had reached the level of Holy Master Exceptional Realm and was the greatest expert in Ancient Monster Clan, took action!
