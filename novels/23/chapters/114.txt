Chapter 115: Blood Feather Tower Arrives!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Amazing!

Seeing the black pill that Jian Wushuang took out, everyone around was amazed.

“Bottleneck-breaking pill?” Xiao Mang was looking at Jian Wushuang in amazement as well, “How could you have it?”

“Don’t forget who I am.” Jian Wushuang was a bit speechless.

The Bottleneck-breaking pill, an extremely high-grade pill, was not only quite rare and precious. In the whole Tianzong Dynasty, alchemists qualified to refine the Bottleneck-breaking pill were very rare.

The Bottleneck-breaking pill was too difficult to refine, so it was almost extravagant for the average person to have one.

But Jian Wushuang was from Dragon Palace, whose Secret Pavilion collected thousands of treasures. It had all the things that one desired. The Bottleneck-breaking pill was almost impossible to find. But in Dragon Palace, it would only take 5,000 points to get one.

Previously, to break through the bottleneck of his Primordial Gold Core, he purchased three Bottleneck-breaking pills at the Secret Pavilion. He used two of them himself, but there was still one left——the one in his hand.

But if Jian Wushuang had known that Xiao Mang fought so hard for the Black Water Lotus just to refine the Bottleneck-breaking pill, he would have given it to Xiao Mang. It was unnecessary to fight so fiercely.

“You are a good man. I’ll give you this Bottleneck-breaking pill.” Jian Wushuang passed the Bottleneck-breaking pill to Xiao Mang.

Xiao Mang hesitated somewhat, but he finally accepted it. He looked directly into Jian Wushuang’s eyes and said, “Thanks a lot!”

Jian Wushuang arched an eyebrow and shifted to the front of that big tree. He raised his hand and broke the trunk into pieces, causing the Interspatial Ring embedded deeply in the trunk to fall into his hand.

“Black Water Lotus.” Looking at the Interspatial ring, Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Third brother,” said Su Rou, appearing beside Jian Wushuang.

“Whew, I was lucky and succeeded,” commented Jian Wushuang before passing the Interspatial ring to her.

Su Rou took it. After binding it, she sensed the Black Water Lotus in the Interspatial ring at once, then a smile appeared on her face.

“Thanks a lot, Third Brother,” Su Rou thanked him. Then she extended her hand with a Black Water Lotus seed in it.

“Black Water Lotus Seed?” Jian Wushuang looked at Su Rou, surprised.

He ran to the mountaintop for a fierce fight with Xiao Mang, while at Quiet Moon Lake, those Gold Core Warriors would certainly have fought for the seven Black Lotus Seeds frantically. The competition was bound to be quite fierce. But Jian Wushuang hadn’t expected that Su Rou could seize a Black Water Lotus Seed from that group of experts.

“Third brother, this Black Water Lotus Seed is for you. I know you still want to grasp Sword Essence of the Waterdrop. This Black Lotus Seed should be able to help you,” Su Rou said.

“Don’t you want it? You also comprehend Essence of the Waterdrop!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but asked.

“The Black Water Lotus is enough for me. This Black Water Lotus Seed is of little use to me,” Su Rou said.

“That’s great.” Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse. He reached out and accepted the Black Water Lotus Seed.

“The battle for the Black Water Lotus is finally over,” Jian Wushuang commented while he looked around.

Over!

It was over! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The seven Black Water Lotus Seeds had found owners and even the Black Water Lotus was eventually taken by Jian Wushuang, after a fierce fight.

Indeed, the fighting had completely come to an end.

Although it was over, the fight today would become a topic that people loved to talk about. It was destined to spread throughout the Tianzong Dynasty soon.

Meanwhile, the Earthly Dragon List would certainly alter its rankings.

People would also have a deep impression of the name of Swordsman and remember the ultimate fight on the mountain near Quiet Moon Lake today!

A man in the Initial Gold Core Realm, who grasped three different Sword Essences at the same time, defeated Xiao Mang.

Such a brilliant record was enough to make the world praise him, making it easy for him to be ranked on the Earthly Dragon List.

However, while people around were still talking about the fight between Swordsman and Xiao Mang, an unremarkable skinny man appeared in the crowd.

The skinny man only reached the Initial Gold Core Realm. He also participated in the fight for the Black Water Lotus, but only had a mediocre performance. Thus, nobody would notice him. But at this moment, the man was ruthlessly gazing in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

“A black-robed swordsman…”

“He is only in the Initial Gold Core Realm, yet he has grasped three different Sword Essences with an extremely high level of comprehension!”

“Yes, he is Jian Wushuang.”

“The target of the Scarlet Kill Command, Jian Wushuang!”

After confirmation, the skinny man immediately went to deliver the message.

Soon, night fell.

Though the moonlight was bright and clear, its light could not reach into the Endless mountain range. So it was still dark in there.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A series of dark figures hastily swept through the woods like ghosts. It wasn’t long before they reached a forest near Quiet Moon Lake and stopped.

All these men were dressed in black robes, wearing masks on their faces. There were twelve of them in total. Among whom ten wore gold masks, while the other two wore… purple masks.

Ten assassins with gold masks and two assassins with purple masks. This was the battle formation arranged by Blood Feather Tower this time.

“The target is right in front of us,” One of the purple-masked assassins spoke in a low voice, “Blood Shadow Team One and Team Two, you move first. Make sure to find the right opportunity and kill him with one hit. Don’t make the two of us get involved. ”

The two purple-masked assassins had some scruples, so they wouldn’t move if the circumstances permitted.

The ten gold-masked assassins stood there, cold as ice. Among them, the leader of the gold-masked assassins laughed and said, “He is just a disciple of Dragon Palace, in the Initial Gold Core Realm. His perception of the realms is higher than an average person, but so what? Blood Shadow Team One and Team Two are moving at the same time, which is already giving him face. As for you two, please just watch.”

“Darkblader, you’d better not look down on the target. According to the information we received from today’s fight over the Black Water Lotus, he defeated Xiao Mang, who is ranked 22nd on the Earthly Dragon List. Do not forget that Xiao Mang’s ranking on the Earthly Dragon List is above you.” The purple-masked assassin said in a low voice.

“So what?” the gold-masked assassin, Darkblader, still dismissed it and said, “I’m an assassin, so direct slaughter is not my forte. But once I find a chance, even those who rank in the top ten on the Earthly Dragon List will die, let alone someone ranked 22nd.”

Darkblader was full of confidence.

But he was indeed qualified to say this.

Darkblader… He ranked 41st on the Earthly Dragon List.

Although his ranking was below 40, his real identity was an assassin of Blood Feather Tower. As an assassin, when found the right opportunity, he was an extremely terrifying assassin.

“Anyway, be careful. Don’t forget that he is the target of a Scarlet Kill Command, ordered personally by Sir Grayrobe. This time, we must kill him no matter what. If we fail, we will all be executed!” The purple-masked assassin had a serious expression.

“Remember, don’t give him a chance!”

“Kill him in one hit, and then leave immediately.”

“Go.”

Once the purple-masked assassin finished speaking, the 10 gold-masked assassins immediately set out.
