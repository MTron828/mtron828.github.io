Chapter 1607: The Strange Old Man

As Real God Li Huo was roaring madly about his six Illusory Heart Carps, there was an emaciated, short, small body flying about leisurely in a part of the sky of the Thunderbolt Island.

“I didn’t expect that little kid Li Huo to actually get his hands on the Illusory Heart Carps. Moreover, he kept it to himself and did not let anyone know about it. If not for me passing by his mansion by chance, I would still not know that he was actually hiding such good stuff,” the emaciated old man laughed in a strange way. He even stuck out his head and licked his lips.

“The Illusory Heart Carps are extremely delicious. However, it’s a pity that there’s only six of them, which is a bit too little. When I see the little kid Li Huo the next time, I will have to tell him to get more of them.”

However, he did not know that the Real God Li Huo of the very moment even had the intention to kill him.

“Eh?”

The emaciated old man stopped moving abruptly and his extremely small, mouse-like eyes looked down at the wasteland.

Stone tablets stood upright on the wasteland and there were a few people comprehending before them. In particular, one of the people attracted the old man’s attention.

“A Universe God?” the person who the old man had noticed was Jian Wushuang.

He saw that at that very moment, Jian Wushuang was sitting before a stone tablet with his legs crossed and his hands were mimicking the motion of a Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang did not use the Blood Mountain Sword as well as any Divine Power in the slightest bit. With his fingers as a sword, he depended purely on his own sword essence to practice his Sword Principle.

With that, he would not damage the stone tablets around him.

As Jian Wushuang’s fingers moved, a total of ten extremely small sword shadows appeared in the void at once and they fused together quickly to form a completely new sword shadow.

For the new sword shadow, it was obvious that its power had risen greatly.

After seeing such a scene, the eyes of the emaciated old man who was above squinted slightly. At the next moment, his body floated downward.

Buzz~~ The sword shadow dissipated and Jian Wushuang also withdrew his fingers. He then opened his eyes.

“That’s wrong. I feel that this stroke of mine still lacks something,” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

He had already stayed in the wasteland for three days, during which he had studied quite a number of Sword Principle Unique Skills. With that, he had got some knowledge and he had practiced his Sword Principle straight away. However, he was not satisfied with the results of the practice.

At that moment…

“Hey, little kid!” A strange voice could be heard abruptly.

Jian Wushuang was stunned and he turned his head to take a look. He then realized that an emaciated, small, short old man had somehow appeared behind him. The old man’s extremely small eyes were emitting a dim light like a gem and they were staring at Jian Wushuang.

When Jian Wushuang saw the old man, he was shocked.

Firstly, the emaciated old man could appear behind him so quietly that he was not even detected by Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power. Hence, the emaciated old man was most likely an Almighty. If not, he could also be a top Chaotic Real God who had already awakened the Soul Fire.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang had the tendency to attract experts.

Moreover, the emaciated old man’s looks and attire were a bit strange.

He had messy hair, he was clothed in tattered black clothes and his exposed skin was filthy. He was a complete mess. Moreover, there was a neckband on his neck and it was strung with shining white bones. He was extremely weird.

“Little kid, you are the Inverse Cultivator, Jian Wushuang, right?” the strange old man’s eyes were glowing with a dim light. His voice was also very screechy and it was extremely unusual.

“That’s me. May I know to whom I speak?” Jian Wushuang was modest.

“You don’t need to care who I am. Let me ask you, do you have White Blaze Fruits with you?” it was obvious that the strange old man’s eyes were filled with excitement.

Jian Wushuang felt uneasy. However, when he remembered that he was on the Thunderbolt Island where no one dared to act recklessly, he heaved a sigh of relief and he said immediately: “Elder, I have indeed obtained quite a number of White Blaze Fruits previously. However, I have already handed those White Blaze Fruits over to the Star Palace Master of the Lineage of Star. Hence, I do not have any of them with me now.”

“You really don’t have them? You’re not lying right?” the strange old man’s eyes turned grave.

“Of course not. Think about it, elder. I am merely a Universe God. Hence, the White Blaze Fruit is useless to me. Moreover, it might even bring me trouble. As I am not an idiot, why would I have it on me?” Jian Wushuang forced a smile.

“Yes, that makes sense,” the strange old man nodded his head slightly and his face revealed a pitiful expression, “What a pity. Originally, I had wanted to get my hands on a few White Blaze Fruits so that I could try them. Looks like I can only wait for the next time now. I wonder what kind of taste the White Blaze Fruit has.”

After finishing his speech, the strange old man could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

After hearing what the strange old man had said to himself, Jian Wushuang had a puzzled expression.

The White Blaze Fruit was an extremely valuable treasure and it was of great use to even Almighties.

Jian Wushuang had originally thought that the strange old man had wanted the White Blaze Fruits for training. However, looking at it at that very moment, he actually only wished to have a taste of the White Blaze Fruit?

It was only to eat it?

“This person is a bit weird,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

“Little kid,” the strange old man looked over again, “When you meet the Star Palace Master after you return to the Lineage of Star, could you talk to him and get me some White Blaze Fruits?”

“This…” Jian Wushuang forced a smile. However, he still replied, “I will do my best.”

“Haha, not bad, not bad. You’re still sensible,” the strange old man nodded his head, “Looking at the fact that you’re so sensible, I shall give you some tips. Your Sword Principle just now was a complete mess.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Umm…” Jian Wushuang could not help but be stunned.

“The wasteland that you’re in right now contains countless Unique Skills. In particular, at the area of Unique Skills of claw skills, there is a stone tablet which contains a simple claw print and you can go over to take a look at it,” after speaking, the strange old man’s body changed and he disappeared.

As Jian Wushuang looked at the place where the strange old man disappeared from, he became even more baffled.

“This elder’s way of doing things is really strange. However, he should be an Almighty and I wonder which Almighty of the Sanctuary Alliance he is,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. After that, without hesitation, he acted in accordance to what the strange old man had said and headed to the area of Unique Skills of claw skills.

As he searched the stone tablets over there, he found the stone tablet that the strange old man had mentioned in the blink of an eye.

“Claw skills?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the stone tablet in front of him. There was indeed an extremely simple claw print on the stone tablet.

“As an Almighty, that elder has a wider perception of things. Even though he knows that I am proficient in Sword Principles, he still made me come over here to study the claw-type Unique Skill. Hence, there must be something to it. I shall try and see what happens,” Jian Wushuang immersed his mind into the stone tablet in front of him.

In no time, there was another picture scroll in front of Jian Wushuang.

The picture scroll was a blurry shadow that could not be seen clearly. The blurry shadow then changed into an Exotic Beast that galloped about in the sky with its four hooves. Its speed was so fast that it was unbelievable.

However, all of a sudden, with a change of the blurry shadow, one body changed into three bodies instantly.

The three shadows of the Exotic Beast then leaped high up into the air and swung out the sharp claws on their hands at the same time.
