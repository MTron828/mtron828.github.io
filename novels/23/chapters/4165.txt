4166 He’s Out

“This guy…are you serious?” Jian Wushuang felt strange.

For a thousand years, he had been looking at the remnant soul of zenith heaven, like a diligent old cow that had been plowing the land. He had been controlling his body, trying every possible way to increase his strength.

Jian Wushuang’s consciousness form was even more certain that it was the right decision to stay dormant. Without this guy, how long would it take for his strength to improve so quickly?

This remnant soul of zenith heaven was simply a gift from the heavens to help him increase his strength!

Of course, the premise of all this was that he was a perfect life form that was as rare as Phoenix Feathers and Qilin horns in the universe. It was also because the Tarot sword spirit did not have a complete understanding of perfect life forms.

In this soul realm, as a perfect life form, he only needed to think and he could directly start to fight back against the remnant soul of the sword spirit of Tarot, or even kill it. Once the remnant soul was killed, everything that Jian Wushuang comprehended from the remnant soul of Tarot would be taken over by Jian Wushuang without any hindrance, without any discomfort.

This was because it was something that he had comprehended from his own body.

Outside the soul realm.

“Yes, I’ve almost reached the peak of this body in all aspects. I just need to make the next breakthrough when the conditions are right.” Jian Wushuang held his chin and thought for a while, then said to himself, “Hehe, it’s about time to go out. But before that, we can’t leave these things behind.

Thinking of this, ‘Jian Wushuang’ went straight to the fourth floor and put the Tarot sword manual into his Interspatial Ring.

Then, he went to the third and second floor again, and put countless divine medicines, divine materials, and treasures into his Interspatial Ring.

However, at the first level, Tarot’s remnant soul had only collected five universe origin stones, which was about 50 million pieces. This made Jian Wushuang’s consciousness body in his soul realm sigh in pity.

At the same time, he had already made preparations. As soon as the soul fragment left the Spatial Rift, he would immediately kill it and regain control of his body.

Three days later.

Tarot’s remnant soul drove Jian Wushuang’s body to the two statues on the fifth level.

“I’ve been here for hundreds of chaos cycles. I’ve finally found a suitable body and left this damned place!” Jian Wushuang laughed and pressed his palm on the head of the statue on the left.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

In an instant, a huge vortex that looked like a black hole appeared in the void.

‘Jian Wushuang’ took a heavy step forward and shot toward the huge Whirlpool while laughing wildly.

…

Inside the Tarot Ruins.

On the bank of a river, two forces were in a confrontation.

Rather than a confrontation, it would be more appropriate to call it a hunt.

On one side was a hunting team formed by six Ultimate Rulers. They specialized in hunting down lone or weak Ultimate Rulers in the Tarot Ruins, similar to Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Ruler Violet Eye.

On the other side, there were two Ultimate Rulers who were alone. Their divine bodies were riddled with holes, and they seemed to be on the verge of collapse. If the six Ultimate Rulers who were surrounding them didn’t seem to be afraid, they would have swarmed forward and killed the two Ultimate Rulers.

“Star Ruler, Heavenly Ruler, hand over the divine cold iron stone and we can guarantee that we’ll let you two go!” A big man with two hammers in his hands and a small braid on the back of his head said.

When the two people who were being hunted heard this, it was as if they had heard a funny joke, and they could not help but laugh loudly.

“Hahahaha, Agalor, you’re better off using these words to deceive ghosts!” The Star Ruler spoke disdainfully. He understood that if the hunting team had not been worried that he would destroy the divine cold iron stone before he died, they would have killed the two of them long ago. Why would they waste so much time talking to them?

If they really did as they were told and obediently handed over the divine cold iron stone, they would immediately face a storm of attacks.

“Hmph, you don’t know what’s good for you!”

Immediately, the big man with the pigtails ‘face darkened, and he said with killing intent, “Since that’s the case, Star Ruler, Heavenly Ruler, don’t blame us for being ruthless!”

Kill!!!

In an instant, this hunting team of six Ultimate Rulers turned into six divine beams of light and shot toward the two!

Rumble!

At this moment, the sky and earth suddenly changed color. It was as if the void had been torn apart. At first, it was a small black dot. Then, the black dot gradually expanded and turned into a huge vortex full of black clouds and lightning!

“Hehehehe, I’ve finally come out!” A maniacal laugh suddenly rang out. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The hunting team that had turned into six divine rays and was charging toward the Star Ruler and the Heavenly Constellation Ruler stopped in their tracks. They raised their heads and looked at the vortex in shock.

The Star Ruler and the Constellation Ruler could not help but raise their heads to look at the sky.

Whoosh!

A black stream of light shot out from the black vortex and stopped in front of them with a loud laugh.

“This…who is this?” The hunting squad, Star Ruler, and Heavenly Constellation were all shocked.

They had never heard of anyone who could tear open space in the Tarot Ruins, let alone walk out of it.

The black light gradually dissipated, revealing a black-robed young man with a cold expression.

“Who is he? The fluctuations of divine power on his body seemed to be…he seems to only be a fourth-stage chief Ruler?”

The eight of them were all puzzled.

They had been shocked, but when they realized that this young man only had the cultivation of a fourth-level Ruler, they began to calm down.

“Kekekekeke…it’s been hundreds of chaos cycles! I finally get to breathe some fresh air!” The black-clothed young man stretched his back lazily, then stuck out his tongue and greedily licked the corner of his mouth.

He was Jian Wushuang, who was being controlled by the Tarot divine sword.

“Kid, who are you?” A cold snort suddenly sounded.

‘Jian Wushuang’ turned his head and saw a big man with two giant hammers in his hands. He had a small braid on the back of his head and was looking at him with an unfriendly expression.

Seeing this, ‘Jian Wushuang’s’ face turned cold and he said, “Ant, are you talking to this lord?”

The man with the pigtails immediately began to laugh in anger, and the other Rulers all had strange expressions on their faces.

“You, a trifling chief Ruler of the fourth level, dare to call me an ant?” The big man with the plaited beard’s eyes flickered with a ferocious light.

Although he did not know where the black-robed young man had come from, he knew that he had a solid cultivation base. A mere fourth-level Ruler was not even worth his time.

“Oh? From the looks of it, you want to make a move on me? Do you know whose territory this is?” Jian Wushuang laughed sinisterly as a strange fire danced in his eyes.
