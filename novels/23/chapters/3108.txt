Chapter 3109: They Were All Killed

——

“How could he be so fast?” Four God was also shocked.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang was indeed a rank three True Saint.

However, his divine power was definitely at the level of a rank five True Saint. He had comprehended the space-time principles and had reached the third stage. He even had some attainments in it, his comprehension of the space-time principles was very strong among many rank five True Saints.

The most terrifying part of the space-time principles was his speed. Of course, he was fast.

In addition, not only was he fast, but the most important thing was that his silver light movement technique was extremely strange.

The perfect combination of speed and movement technique made his body look like a ghost. Of course, he was much faster than Four God.

With his terrifying speed, the Star Dream first move, and the god-killing poison, it was too easy for Jian Wushuang to kill these rank three and rank four True Saints.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

The sword shadow mercilessly swept past the three experts in an instant, and they died immediately.

The remaining experts were completely terrified by this scene.

“Run!”

“Run!”

“With such a fast speed, we are like a target for him. Let’s split up and run!”

A series of terrifying voices rang out.

The remaining ten experts frantically rushed toward the surrounding area.

“Run?”

Jian Wushuang gave a strange smile. He did not make any movements, but he only moved with his mind.

Buzz!

The huge barrier, which was not far away, suddenly closed in front of the fleeing experts.

“What?”

“How can this be?”

“The magic array has shrunk?”

The experts were shocked.

The ruler seal ruled over space and time.

Jian Wushuang could control the magic array formed by the ruler seal at will.

He could control the formation to cover a large area, or he could control it to a narrow area less than one meter in diameter.

Previously, he had only used the formation to seal the surrounding space and time to prevent these people from escaping. But now, Jian Wushuang had directly reduced the size of the formation, sealing the area where they could move in a very small void.

In this narrow void, how could these people still have a chance to escape?

As for saying that they should split up, that was even more of a joke.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent was like a rainbow, and the killing in his hands did not stop at all.

One after another, cold sword light flashed out and easily swept past the experts.

These experts had not been able to organize any effective resistance from the beginning to the end.

In just two breaths’ time, the void had completely calmed down, and the storm formed by the time-space annihilation had also calmed down.

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand and stood quietly in the middle of the void. In front of him, Four God was still standing there.

Except for Four God, all the other rank three and rank four True Saints had died!

At this moment, Shen Si’s eyes were cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang with a pale face!

After all, the scene just now had happened right under his nose. Jian Wushuang had killed nearly 30 rank three and rank four True Saints in front of him, but he could do nothing about it, he could only watch helplessly.

“Who are you?!”

Shen Si’s voice was trembling, and he was also a little scared.

He had no choice. Jian Wushuang’s slaughter in such a short time was too terrifying, and it made him scared.

“My name is Heavenly Sword Marquis, and I’m from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“From the Heaven-cleaving Alliance? Not the three palaces?” Shen Si frowned.

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “Cut the crap. All your men are dead. It’s your turn now.”

“Humph, you want to kill me?” Shen Si’s voice turned cold. “I’m different from the crap you killed!”

As a rank five True Saint, Shen Si had some confidence.

Although Jian Wushuang could easily kill a rank three or rank four True Saint, it did not mean that he could easily kill a rank five True Saint.

“You are right. You are indeed different from those rank three or rank four True Saints. That’s why I deliberately left you at the end.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently. As soon as he finished speaking, rumble! A large amount of golden divine power began to gather crazily behind him.

In just a moment, a 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom appeared behind him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Golden Emperor Phantom was majestic and awe-inspiring.

“As a rank five True Saint, you are qualified to receive my sword!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. He clenched the hilt of his sword with both hands and slowly raised the Blood Mountain Sword.

At the moment the Blood Mountain Sword was raised, a strange power began to spread.

Shen Si stared at Jian Wushuang with a solemn expression. At this moment, Shen Si suddenly felt a special power crazily pressing down on him.

“This is…space-time pressure?” Shen Si stared at Jian Wushuang. “This sword attack of his has brought about space-time pressure!”

The majestic space-time pressure on Shen Si’s body increased the pressure on him.

However, at this moment…hualala~ Raging flames mixed with endless white ice fog and produced endless power of ice and fire. The two natural opposing powers of ice and fire merged perfectly at this moment, the power of ice and fire swept wildly in all directions. In the blink of an eye, it completely covered the surrounding void and formed a huge world of ice and fire.

The world of ice and fire had Jian Wushuang as its core. With a thought from Jian Wushuang, the world of ice and fire crazily pressed toward holy four.

The 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom also intimidated Four God.

At that moment, Four God’s divine power was completely suppressed.

At the same time, the power of Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword had accumulated to the maximum.

“Cut!”

With a roar, Jian Wushuang’s blood mountain sword, which had been raised high, finally cut down.

With this cut, the space-time power that was pressing down on Four God from all directions suddenly soared!

Four God had already felt an extraordinary space-time pressure, but at this moment, the space-time pressure suddenly increased by a hundred times!

The space-time pressure was already strong, but now it was a hundred times stronger?

What did this mean?

The terrifying space-time pressure, together with the divine punishment deterrence and the full suppression of the ice-fire swimming dragon ruler, made Four God tremble.

It was the same as the fight between Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao.

When Jian Wushuang used the emperor’s blood kill, Xiong Tao lost the ability to resist.

Now, although Shen Si was a genuine rank five True Saint, he could not resist the unprecedented pressure.
