Chapter 3695: The Three Saint Realms Were Completely Destroyed!

??

Xuan Yan’s words shocked everyone from the Eternal Chaotic World.

Ji Wumeng’s frown deepened.

“Mother, this is indeed the case in the Divine Beginning Realm. There is no mercy here, especially for the enemy,” Jian Wushuang said, “If we let the cultivators of the Three Saint Realms leave today, they will not hesitate to show their claws at us in the coming year. They will stab us in the back when they have the chance.”

“Mother, you have just arrived in the Divine Beginning Realm, so you don’t know much about it. But you will get used to it after a long time.”

Ji Wumeng nodded and did not say anything else.

Two days and three nights!

The great battle within the Three Great Saint Realms lasted for two days and three nights.

This was very normal. After all, the Three Great Saint Realms were too big, and there were too many cultivators.

Even if the allied armies of the various forces all attacked, it would still take some time to kill all the cultivators of the Three Great Saint Realms.

Two days and three nights were still under the situation where the experts from the highest echelons of the various factions personally took action.

After the great battle ended, the Three Great Saint Realms, which had stood tall in the Divine Beginning Realm for countless years and were supported by the will of the Heavenly Dao, were finally completely wiped out.

They were completely wiped out. There were practically no fish that escaped the net.

As for the countless resources and treasures left behind by the Three Great Saint Realms, a small number of them had been snatched away during the battle. However, the majority of them were still gathered together and distributed.

Weng!

In the vast void, countless figures stood erect.

The armies of experts from various forces remained in this void, and no one left.

In the center of this void, thrones condensed from divine power stood erect. On these thrones, there were many figures emitting tyrannical auras. These figures…they were the Rulers of the forces participating in the war, or the highest level.

In front of these people, there were five towering thrones floating quietly.

These five thrones were obviously higher than the other thrones, but no one dared to object.

Because the people on these five thrones were the five strongest and most powerful people in the Divine Beginning Realm.

They were Jian Wushuang, Daoist Xuan God, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, Temporal Temple Master, and Heaven Ancestor!

Except for Jian Wushuang, the other four were all Rulers. Although Jian Wushuang was not a Ruler, his battle strength was above that of a Ruler. Moreover, he was the absolute main force in this battle, he had single-handedly killed the Three Saint Realm Masters and three Rulers from the Devil Cloud Star.

Therefore, he sat in the middle of the five.

Xuan Yan was also a Ruler, but he was from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. Now that the Xuan God was there, he did not need to show up.

“Xuan God, Heaven Ancestor, how is the Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

While the forces of the Divine Beginning Realm attacked the Three Saint Realms, on the Universe Battlefield, Daoist Xuan God and Heaven Ancestor led the Star Palace to attack the Holy Island.

Now that the Three Saint Realms had been destroyed, the Holy Island should have a result.

“It’s over. The Holy Island has been destroyed. More than 80% of the hundreds of Principles Masters have been killed. Although some escaped, it’s not a big deal,” Daoist Xuan God said with a smile.

His and the Heaven Ancestor’s original bodies were still on the Holy Island. As for the ones who had arrived, they were just consciousness incarnations.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

This time, the Divine Beginning Realm and the Universe Battlefield had attacked at the same time, and the final result could be considered satisfactory.

The only regret was that he had not destroyed or obtained the black spear.

“After this battle, the Three Saint Realms can be said to be completely destroyed. Next, it’s time to divide the spoils of war,” Jian Wushuang said grandly.

After hearing his words, the Rulers and the highest-level officials from all sides became excited.

They had left without destroying the Three Saint Realms to divide the spoils of war.

After all, the Three Saint Realms had been the overlords of the Divine Beginning Realm.

Not only did the Three Saint Realms have countless resources and treasures, but they also had countless territories, secret realms, and all kinds of things, especially the territories where the Three Saint Realms were located, this was the most superior territory for the cultivation of illusions in the Third Heaven.

Who would not be envious?

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

A figure stood up from below.

This person was the sect master of the Blood Fire Heaven Sect, one of the Eight Directions Celestial Sect who participated in the battle.

As the sect master of a heaven sect and a top expert in the Divine Beginning Realm, he had once regarded Jian Wushuang as a little guy. But now that he had personally experienced this battle, the strength that Jian Wushuang displayed…all the experts were impressed by him, including the sect master of the Blood Fire Sect.

Therefore, the sect master of the Blood Fire Sect was now extremely respectful to Jian Wushuang, and he naturally addressed him as ‘sir’.

“Lord Heavenly Sword Marquis, there are too many sects participating in the extermination of the Three Saint Realms. Although it seems that the results of this battle are great, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to distribute them. So, how do you plan to distribute the results of this battle?” The sect master of the Blood Fire Sect looked at Jian Wushuang carefully.

“It’s simple. We will distribute the results according to the strength of each force. The stronger the force, the more contribution they make, and the more results they will get. First of all, I was the first to kill the three Rulers and three masters of the Saint Realm, which basically made the Three Saint Realms lose the ability to resist. Therefore, I want 30% of the results.”

Jian Wushuang was very direct and did not beat around the bush.

He alone wanted 30% of the battle results.

When he said this, most of the people on the field secretly nodded and did not have any objections.

This was very normal, because the most crucial part of the battle was the three masters of the Saint Realm and the three Rulers from the Devil Cloud Star. If the three masters of the Saint Realm were still alive, the battle would not have been possible.

It was because Jian Wushuang killed them that the Three Saint Realms were destroyed.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang contributed the most to this battle. It was reasonable for him to ask for 30% of the battle results. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if he asked for 50%, not many people would object, considering Jian Wushuang’s monstrous strength.

Of course, although most people agreed, a few people were secretly dissatisfied and felt that Jian Wushuang was too greedy.

After all, Jian Wushuang was only one person, and there were no forces or sects under his command. If he wanted 30% of the results, what was the use of it?
