4323 The Start of the War

In the extreme north of the universe, this was a forbidden area of the entire universe.

For example, the Blood River, where the Dark Demon Descendant came from, was located in the northernmost area. It was desolate all year round and no one set foot in it. The water of the Blood River was enough to wipe out all existences below the Supreme level. Even if a Supreme came in person, they would not dare to step into the blood river rashly.

It was rumored that the river of blood contained a patriarch blood demon from thousands of chaos cycles ago, who was incredibly powerful. However, no one could say for sure if this rumor was true.

There were a total of nine forbidden places like the Blood River in the northernmost part of the universe. The huge Star Domain in front of the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple was one of them.

This huge Galaxy was covered by the Nebula lightning all year round, and no light could be seen. It floated quietly in the starry sky like a gray cotton ball, exuding a heavy and dead aura.

However, the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple knew that this place, known as the dead star area, was one of the nine great taboos. It was the entrance to one of the most powerful races in the universe, the Dragon race!

The Dragon Tribe rarely appeared, so very few people knew where the Dragon tribe’s habitat was. The Hall Master of Cosmos Temple happened to be one of those who knew.

The dragon clan had formed a world of its own. The only way to get there was through this dead star area.

The dead star area contained innate death Qi that was fatal to even Supremes. Without the dragon clan’s entry token or the dragon clan’s personal invitation, even a Supreme would be corroded by the chaotic innate death Qi and lose his life.

“I am Hei Yu, and I have come to pay my respects to the dragon clan. I have something important to discuss with you!”

The Hall Master of Cosmos Temple said in a deep voice as he stepped into the void and stared at the dead-silent star area.

Even for him, he did not dare to be careless when facing the dragon clan, which had been one of the top clans since ancient times.

After a while.

Rumble!

The dead star area, which looked like a gray cloud, let out a violent muffled sound.

The next moment, a faint yellow light shot out from the dead star area, forcing back the endless Thunder Nebula and the chaotic innate death Qi, forming a passage that was wide enough for people to pass through.

“Hei Yu, our King has invited you.”

A deep, cold, and terrifying sound wave that didn’t seem human came from this dead star area.

“Thank you, Dragon King.”

The Hall Master of Cosmos Temple smiled faintly. He took a step forward and appeared on the passage paved with yellow light. He walked into the dead-silent star area.

BOOM! BOOM!

A moment later, the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple disappeared, and the faint yellow light dissipated as well. Gray nebulas and lightning continued to spread out, covering him.

…

Within the Divine Life Palace.

After Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu gave the order for all disciples to return from the Ancient Path of Stars, the atmosphere in the entire Divine Life Palace gradually became solemn and grim.

Everyone knew that the Divine Life Palace was about to be destroyed by a Great War.

At this moment, no one dared to relax. They all made the best use of their time and quickly began to comprehend and cultivate.

Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang didn’t spend much time together before they went into seclusion.

Although Leng Rushuang was reluctant, she knew that the overall situation was more important. Only by constantly improving her strength could she catch up with Jian Wushuang.

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed.

In a private room.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with his eyes slightly closed, quietly sorting out his strength.

Now, he had completely stabilized his status as an Ultimate Ruler. Whether it was the strength of his divine power or the fusion of his nine laws, he had reached the peak of the Ultimate Ruler Realm.

However, the next step was the biggest problem.

Jian Wushuang knew that it was almost impossible for him to break through to the supremacy stage. The only way to improve his strength in a short time was to comprehend the divine power and increase its power.

“Perhaps, I should try to walk my own path.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. He opened his eyes and there was a flash of light in his eyes.

“Then, my Dao…what is it?”

“What is Dao?”

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought. ‘Dao’ was a very abstruse word. Throughout the ages, those who stood at the peak of the universe had all created their own Dao.

For example, the Tarot Swordmaster wielded the three-foot sword and was invincible in the art of swordplay.

As he pondered, Jian Wushuang felt as if he had vaguely grasped something. However, when he pondered carefully, it was like the moon in the water, he could not comprehend anything.

Time passed by slowly.

Just as Jian Wushuang was immersed in how to comprehend the ‘Dao’, the Blood Wave Supreme’s message suddenly rang in his mind.

Jian Wushuang, come to the Supreme shrine!

His tone was filled with urgency and solemness.

In an instant, a cold glint flashed across Jian Wushuang’s eyes. There could only be one reason why the Blood Wave Supreme had sent him a message.

The great battle against Jian Wushuang and the entire Divine Life Palace was about to begin!

“Yes.”

Jian Wushuang replied to the message, then stood up, pushed open the door of the wing room, and rushed toward the Supreme shrine.

After a while, Jian Wushuang arrived at the Supreme shrine.

In the Supreme shrine, Supreme Master Gai Fu sat at the head while Supreme Blood Wave, Supreme Giant Axe, Tian Ji, and Supreme White Tiger sat on the two sides. Under the five of them were a few Supremes that Jian Wushuang had never seen in the Divine Life Palace. They must have been traveling outside and had rushed back after receiving a message from the Divine Life Palace.

All the Supreme-beings present looked solemn. Jian Wushuang greeted them, but they only nodded slightly in response.

alright, with the exception of the Ninth Kalpa King and Supreme dufeng, who are still on the Ancient Path of Stars, everyone is here. Let me tell you the situation.

...

Supreme Master Gai Fu’s expression was a little serious, which was a rare sight. After sweeping his gaze across Jian Wushuang and the others, he slowly said, “I’ve just received news that the Great Void Temple, Great Sun Divine Kingdom, Blood Sky Hall…a total of five top forces have joined forces and sent a fleet to the Divine Life Palace. They will arrive at the gate of the Divine Life Palace in seven days.”

Other than Jian Wushuang, the other Supreme Masters were expressionless. They must have known about this long ago.

Jian Wushuang could not help but frown.

He had not expected that the first to attack him would not be Cosmos Temple, but the five major forces.

However, he didn’t say much. Everyone present was the main pillar of the Divine Life Palace, so they must have a way.

Supreme Master Gai Fu continued. “Everyone, this is the Divine Life Palace’s first battle. Therefore, we must display our might. Do you understand?”

“Yes!”

Everyone responded in agreement.

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu nodded his head in satisfaction and said in a deep voice, “This battle is just their test. We must destroy the Alliance of the five Forces outside the Divine Palace!

“Three days later, everyone will follow this old man to destroy the Alliance Army!”

An extremely sharp and cold light flashed across Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu’s eyes!
