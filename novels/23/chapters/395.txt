Chapter 396: The Fight for the Blood Gems

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was thrilled as he looked at numerous gems levitating in the air. His eyes shone with anticipation.

The Blood Puppet was his trump card. Despite its strength, he had not used it and did not intend to do so unless absolutely necessary because he had a limited amount of gems.

With so many gems within his grasp now, he would be able to use the puppet more freely.

“The Blood Gems are invaluable in making weapons, puppets, and elixirs, so each one is rare and precious.”?General Qing stared intensely at the gems and shouted, “Go! Get the gems.”

“Let’s get moving too!” Wu Ta roared and rushed toward the gems.

The truce between the two armies was broken by the appearance of the Blood Gems.

Boom! Boom! Boom! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Loud roaring sounds reverberated through the hall. The hall’s structure remained intact and no dust was generated despite the strong vibrations. The hall had been built by its owner and was sturdy enough to withstand a fight between Cloud Realm experts. Naturally, it was not significantly affected by a fight involving people who were merely in Stage Two or Three of the Saint Realm.

“Hmph!”

General Qing looked grave. He had been fighting with Wu Ta. As the only Stage Three experts present in the mansion, they were both separated from others. They dashed toward the gems.

General Qing tried to grab a gem with an outstretched hand. As he did so, he saw a blast of fire waves surge from Wu Ta, who looked mad with fury.

The wave hit the gems before General Qing could reach them, and the impact caused the gems to scatter.

This brightened the commanders.

“Quick! Catch them!”

Obeying the order, the commanders stopped fighting and charged toward the gems that had been scattered. A fierce fight started immediately.

At this moment, four beams of purple light wafted out of the pool and floated in the Void like the gems.

“Are there more gems in the pool?”

Everyone was distracted by the light. Soon, they realized that the objects that had just materialized were four purple talismans.

Standing in the center of the hall, General Qing randomly grabbed a talisman.

He held it in his hands and frowned as he examined it. Realizing what it was, he cried out happily, “This is... a token!

“A token that can lead us into the inner part of the mansion.”

“Token?” Everyone was shocked, and their eyes betrayed their frenzied state of mind.

“Quick! Seize the tokens!” Wu Ta growled.

The seven commanders of the Silver-winged Army tried their best to follow the order. Although they had one more person than Jian Wushuang’s side, they were still unable to overpower them as they were suppressed by Jian Wushuang’s Sword Realm.

However, their intention now was to seize the Blood Gems and talismans. They would only need to hold off their opponents while one of them grabbed the items.

“Damn it!”

Seeing the Silver-winged Army collect the Blood Gems with ease, the six commanders of the Iron Saber Army, including General Qing, looked grave.

They were occupied with fighting their opponents and could only watch helplessly as the white-robed man from Silver-wing Army retrieved the Blood Gems?and put them into his Interspatial Ring.

All this was because the Silver-winged Army outnumbered them by one person.

Swish! A long green whip swept toward Jian Wushuang like surging waves. Jian Wushuang brandished his sword and knocked the whip away. He began to fight with a green-haired woman.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang noticed the white-robed man, who was collecting the gems, unhampered and unrestricted.

“He has already collected six Blood Gems.”?Jian Wushuang was aggrieved.?“These Blood Gems mean a lot to me. I have to get some.”

“It seems that I have to use my trump cards now.”

Jian Wushuang contemplated his next steps and his killing intent abruptly swept over the hall.

“Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!”

Following his shout, the overwhelming killing intent gathered together and formed a bloody river, which covered the whole hall in an instant with overpowering force.

“What’s this?”

Many of the experts looked at the river in shock, and they felt a burst of unusual power from the river.

The white-robed man, who had been collecting the Blood Gems, noticed the river as well, but he ignored it. However, when he reached for the gem in front of him, a bloody palm formed by the rolling river slapped toward him.

“What!”

The man was stunned and drew back immediately.

Jian Wushuang stood at the center of the river, and a cold light shined from within his eyes.

Road to the Underworld worked well with the Tenfold Realm. Including Slaughter Domain, there were three techniques working together at the same time.

“Compression!”

As the word escaped Jian Wushuang’s lips, the force that had repressed the Silver-winged Army surged again.

Boom! The river roared toward the army and caused the commanders that were floating in midair to sink, turning their shock into horror.

“How could this be? The pressure has become much stronger!”

“The pressure of the Sword Realm was already formidable, and now, it has almost doubled because of the Blood River.”

“Oh my God, my strength has been suppressed by 30 percent!”
