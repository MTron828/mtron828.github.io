Chapter 2490: Sit and Talk

Jian Wushuang wore a cold expression as a powerful battle essence surged from his body.

With his sword pointing forward, the energy from the Endless Cycle began to burst out.

Hate! Hate! Hate!

The sword-lights that swept out were filled with hatred as it slashed through the void with sword essences filling up everywhere it passed by as if charting a way to Heaven.

Two secret techniques—Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment—were mustering in full force and unleashed the most powerful sword technique which Jian Wushuang self-created, Hateful Path Toward Heaven!

Jian Wushuang had unleashed his abilities to its extreme with that strike.

In the blink of an eye, a sword-light filled with infinite hatred collided with the three Crimson Elephants.

Boom!

Like the collision of two worlds, the boundless blood ocean was almost completely turned over.

A pervasive crimson color formed from the terrifying crimson windstorm shrouded the entire void where Jian Wushuang was.

The various sects’ experts who were hiding in the surrounding void and those countless cultivators in Blazing Moon City gazed intensely at the eye of the crimson windstorm.

Yun Zhen was also staring at the storm when a strange light suddenly flashed in his eyes.

With shattering noises, the crimson windstorm was torn open as a silhouette walked out and appeared before everyone’s sight.

“You’re truly the Lord of Great Compassion Sect. Your abilities are remarkable.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and was secretly in awe.

He had lost in the last clash.

The energies of those three Crimson Elephants were extremely powerful. It had utterly crushed his sword technique and impacted his body.

Jian Wushuang’s recovery abilities were incredible, hence he did not get seriously injured. However, he was sure that any regular Ultimate God experts such as Fan Jianxian or An Junzhu would be doomed if they took the Crimson Elephants head-on.

The battle strength of a High-leveled Ultimate God was truly impressive.

Although Jian Wushuang could fend off Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian’s joint attack, they were far from being a High-leveled Ultimate God.

Jian Wushuang was impressed by Yun Zhen’s ability while Yun Zhen was staring at him intensely.

‘That palm strike of mine has completely crushed his sword technique and directly impacted his body, but he isn’t even a bit injured in the end... With such physical defensive capabilities, it won’t be enough to kill him even if my abilities were twice as strong,’ Yun Zhen thought to himself.

“Jian Wushuang, my little friend. You’ve endured three palm strikes from me. Now, we can sit and talk.”

Yun Zhen waved his hand as he was speaking, causing a table and two chairs to appear in the void ahead.

“Please!” Yun Zhen extended his hand.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. His figure flashed and sat on one of those chairs.

Yun Zhen sat on the other chair with his eyes gazing at the surrounding void. “My friends from various sects, you don’t need to hide anymore. Please show yourselves.”

Following his words, many various sects’ experts who were hiding in the surrounding void showed their faces. Some were even lords of certain sects as all of them stood in the void around the table.

“Haha, quite an audience here.” Jian Wushuang intriguingly looked at them. His soul had power scanned through all of them and realized the Four Great Ultimate Gods of Great Compassion Sect and two other Ultimate Gods with one of them being Lord of Narcissus Island.

“The sects that you have gone against certainly are not few, shall all of us sit down and resolve the issue since they’re here?” Yun Zhen said quietly.

“How should it be resolved?” Jian Wushuang looked at Yun Zhen.

“We and the various sects are truly in the wrong by provoking you as you only reacted accordingly. The Great Compassion Sect and all the other sects should naturally apologize to you. In addition, if you have any requests please don’t hesitate to bring it up, my little friend. We’ll not decline so long it’s within our abilities,” said Yun Zhen.

Yun Zhen was undeniably very sincere.

The sincerity shown did not only surprise Jian Wushuang. In fact, the various sects’ experts including Lei Chong and several Supreme Elders, were equally surprised.

The Great Compassion Sect was the first-ranked sect in Wusha Wilderness. It had an extremely strong foundation and had always been extremely high-handed when dealing with matters.

Yun Zhen, as a sect lord, was naturally filled with tricks.

However, why did Yun Zhen suddenly show humility and apologized to the other party?

Even though Jian Wushuang had endured his three palm strikes, surely it need not have come to that.

“My Lord...” Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian secretly sent inquiry messages.

“I can’t kill this Jian Wushuang and he naturally can’t touch me either judging from his current abilities. He’s still far from being a threat toward the Great Compassion Sect. However, don’t forget how young he’s right now. According to the intelligence we’ve gathered, he’s only in his early twenties.”

“He could survive my attacks at merely his early twenties and a Second-class Divine Demon to boot. Can you imagine what he would’ve become if given another twenty years? In other words, if he’d make a breakthrough into First-Class, Peak Divine Demon, or even an Ultimate God like you, what will happen then?” Yun Zhen replied to them.

Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian fell silent.

It was true. What was most terrifying about Jian Wushuang was not the ability he currently possessed as it was still within the Great Compassion Sect’s capability to control. It was Jian Wushuang’s natural talent, potential, and the fact that he had abilities that allowed him to fight someone several levels higher. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If he was already so strong as a Second-Class Divine Demon, what would happen if he finally became an Ultimate God?

The three Supreme Elders were not so foolish to assume Jian Wushuang would never make a breakthrough into the Ultimate God realm.

On the contrary, Jian Wushuang’s breakthrough into an Ultimate God was almost guaranteed. In fact, there was a huge possibility of him becoming an Undying Saint.

As soon as Jian Wushuang became an Ultimate God, it would be child’s play for him to annihilate the Great Compassion Sect with his level-skipping abilities.

“The decision has been made. What we should do is to form relations with Jian Wushuang and we should befriend him if possible. It’s always better to have a friend rather than a powerful enemy,” said Yun Zhen.

The three Supreme Elders agreed and did not argue further after listening to his explanation.

Next to the table, Jian Wushuang was sitting there and looking intriguingly at Yun Zhen.

Yun Zhen’s reaction was truly out of Jian Wushuang’s expectations, but perhaps because of a lord like Yun Zhen, the Great Compassion Sect could continue to flourish.

Jian Wushuang said coldly, “Seeing that Lord Yun has spoken frankly to me, I shall not be ambiguous either. If you want me to cease feeling resentful toward the Great Compassion Sect, you’ll have to promise me a few things. First of all, I need some materials for my instrument cultivation. I tried finding these materials through other channels previously. Unfortunately, it’s so rare I couldn’t get my hands on them. The Great Compassion Sect has a strong background. Perhaps you can help me with this.”
