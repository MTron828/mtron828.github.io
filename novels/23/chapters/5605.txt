Chapter 5604 ¬†Return to the Heavenly Realm

Jian Wushuang understood in his heart. After merging with the Dao, even though the Zhen Ling calculated to keep him inside, he still wanted to go out and explore.

Now, it seemed to align with his intentions.

With a plan in mind, Jian Wushuang was puzzled once again, "My Lord, if I go out, won't I run into Mie Sheng?"

Mie Sheng was currently in the Original Universe.

Even if he were to enter the temporal river, he might not escape the grasp of Mie Sheng.

Unless he left this temporal river.

"I will send you to other temporal rivers, ones that are relatively powerful. There, you won't need to worry about anything. Strive to join some powerful forces; the stronger, the better. With your talent, there shouldn't be a problem. Consider it an exploration for the Qishen Temple!"

Having understood Mie Sheng's layout, Zhen Ling dared not plunder trial practitioners from the outside world anymore. In case he cultivated a few more pawns, he would end up losing both the wife and the soldiers.

Jian Wushuang nodded upon hearing this. There was no problem with that.

Heading to a stronger timeline might bring good luck. Perhaps, he could even reach the timeline of Teacher Xuan Yi.

"Work hard. The help Qishen Temple can provide is not much anymore. In the future, you'll need to rely on your own efforts." After encouraging Jian Wushuang with a few words, Zhen Ling left.

He left Jian Wushuang alone.

The last sentence from Zhen Ling was quite modest.

The treasures of the Qishen Temple were surely more than just this.

He had only obtained the Origin Source of All Things.

Swish!

Moluo, realizing the silence, rushed over immediately. Seeing Jian Wushuang alive, he breathed a sigh of relief.

"Young Master!" Moluo respectfully stood by the side.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and instructed, "Prepare the flying artifact, go to the nearest teleportation array, and return to the Heavenly Realm!"

The Earth Realm was satisfactory.

There probably wasn't much worth lingering over in the future.

Returning to the Heavenly Realm early for Dao Merge was the key.

With the Origin Source, he could elevate the power of Life to new heights, and even break through the black hole realm in one go.

The two of them made a high-profile entrance into the Earth Realm, only to leave quietly in the end.

The outside world also left a seed for Jian Wushuang.

A mighty temporal river!

The¬†vast Starry Sky.

Concealing too many secrets, he needed to explore each one, find Teacher Xuan Yi, and unravel the unsolved mysteries.

Before embarking on a new journey, he needed many preparations.

Back in the Heavenly Realm, without any hesitation, he headed straight for the Elder Palace.

The last time he left the Elder Palace, he was driven away by Wu Zuo, but this time, Wu Zuo and the three Palace Masters personally welcomed him.

And because of his recent relationship with Wu Zuo, Wu Zuo stood at the forefront.

Although only a few days had passed since they last met, the other party acted as if they hadn't seen each other for many years, excitedly welcoming Jian Wushuang's return.

The three Palace Masters even lowered their posture to the utmost.

Even Chang Feng Sword God had a smile on his face. Remember, Jian Wushuang had killed his younger brother.

Forgot about it in just a few days?

But thinking about it, since the plan of that time had been fully revealed, Chang Feng Sword God would hate Wu Zuo if he hated anyone. He wouldn't hold any grudge against Jian Wushuang.

And he didn't believe Jian Wushuang could kill Tie San. Follow the latest novels ùíêùíè nùíê/velbin(.)com

Probably it was Wu Zuo making a move in secret.

Now, he found himself in an unusually passive position.

Among the three Palace Masters, Qingniu remained as neutral as always. If others gained, he didn't lose, and if others lost, he still didn't lose.

Forever standing in a neutral position.

Palace Master Lu Hua's bet paid off this time, and he was the most pleased.

The first day of his return was inevitably filled with socializing.

In the Elder Palace, some familiar faces came to congratulate.

Qiuhuang, the old man with sheep horns, and those ancient tier 5 Emperors of the Original Universe were among them.

But now, they were no longer as simple as tier 5 Emperors.

Following Wan Yan, Dongsheng, and several other tier 5 Emperors, they also entered the three bridges guarded by Divine General Moyin and reaped substantial rewards.

Many of them advanced to become tier 6 Emperors.

Wan Yan and Dongsheng, who were the first to enter, had already advanced to tier 6 Emperors early on.

However, each of these individuals admired Jian Wushuang, a Dao Lord who could kill Tie San.

As for the battles between the Human Realm and the Earth Realm, they had long been sealed off, and they were completely unaware of them.

They were still at the level of Jian Wushuang slaying tier 6 Emperors.

If they knew that Jian Wushuang could now even kill supreme-peak, they would be astonished.

"Everyone, I feel a bit sorry for you. The Origin Source of All Things in the Beiwang Tower..." Jian Wushuang, for once, did not feign ignorance and brought up this matter.

The Beiwang Tower was originally a sacred place for all cultivators, but now it had to be stopped.

After hearing this, Dongsheng was the first to stand up and said, "Wushuang, don't say that. The strong are respected, and this is what you deserve. Moreover, you personally took risks and completely eradicated the headquarters of that Shadow Sect. With such great merits and your strength, all of this is rightfully yours, there's nothing to apologize for."

"Dongsheng is right. Wushuang, we support you!" Wan Yan also chimed in.

Other elders who had a good relationship with Jian Wushuang also spoke up.

In fact, he didn't need to devour all of the Origin Source of All Things; half would be enough. However, the remaining half would be useless.

The Beiwang Tower had to be stopped.

Seeing these people being so sincere, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, "Everyone, I am willing to take out one-third of the Origin Source of All Things as a reward for you all!"

Since he was already playing along, he might as well be generous for once.

He ate meat and also let these people have some soup.

Upon hearing this, the crowd naturally didn't show any pretense and were delighted one after another.

One-third of the Origin Source of All Things was quite substantial.

Distributed among everyone, it was even more than what they would gain from conquering a dozen levels of the Beiwang Tower.

Jian Wushuang stood up directly and said, "Let's distribute it now!"

This time, he was so selfless, but there were also some personal motives in his heart.

After the Dao Merge, he was about to leave.

To leave the universe that nurtured him, to leave the Qishen Temple.

In the current outside world, apart from the suppressed True Monarch, there was also Mie Sheng.

He didn't know if the Original Universe could survive.

According to his speculation, the passage to the Great Yan Domain was in the Great Si Region. If Mie Sheng followed the passage into the Divine Power Universe, his hometown world would probably be in trouble.

Even if Mie Sheng didn't bother to do that, once the True Monarch broke free from the suppression, he would likely devour the Original Universe recklessly, and then everything would be finished.

In the future, it would rely on these people to protect the Original Universe.

Now, giving them some benefits to reward them was no big deal.

Speaking of the matter at hand, Jian Wushuang led the crowd directly to the Beiwang Tower.

"There won't be many opportunities like this in the future. If any of you still lack confidence in breaking through, you can try it now!" Jian Wushuang wasn't in a hurry; a few more years wouldn't make much difference.

Upon hearing this, some of the people were itching to try and entered the Beiwang Tower one after another.

Even for those without attempts left, Jian Wushuang generously granted them chances to challenge, allowing them to enter freely.

Since the Origin Source of All Things belonged to him, the three Palace Masters naturally had no objections.

The elder who guarded this place looked at the spirited Jian Wushuang and sighed inwardly.
