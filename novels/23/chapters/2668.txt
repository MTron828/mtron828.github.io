Chapter 2669: Winning

“She has succeeded in reaching the Profound Achievement Principle World.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

In the Danyang Holy Domain, only some powerful Peak Earth Ultimate Gods had achieved Profound Achievement in their Principle Worlds. Although the Ancient Witch was just at the Earth High-level Ultimate God, she was the heavenly pride of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. It was impossible for her not to achieve it.

The overpowering Principle World repressed against Jian Wushuang who did not immediately activate his Sword World to contend against it. He stood there in silence as the Ancient Witch disappeared in the darkness.

Whoosh!

A wave of strong wind came from the back of Jian Wushuang as the space behind him seemed to distort and open before a black spear came flying towards him like an awakened dragon along with an outburst of frightening power.

Jian Wushuang slightly moved his body as the black spear flew past him and swept past the side of his clothes.

However, the Ancient Witch waved her hand before slightly moving her body which resulted in forming hundreds of her apparitions before all of them concurrently rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

The Ancient Witch had meditated on both the Dark and Space-time Law, hence her Dark Law understanding was quite defined while that of the Space-time was just ordinary.

She had come to the Space-time Palace to raise her insights towards Space-time Law.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The cold spears continuously pierced towards Jian Wushuang with shocking power while Jian Wushuang fluttered his body freely like an erratic cloud.

“B*stard, I dare you not to move!” The Ancient Witch shouted softly.

Jian Wushuang mocked, “Haha... You are too slow.”

He did not make any moves and only fluttered in the sky at his speed. This had already caused the Ancient Witch’s attacks to fail at reaching him.

The Ancient Witch failed to bump or even touch Jian Wushuang for a long period as Jian Wushuang evaded her attacks.

This made the Ancient Witch extremely angry.

At this moment...Jian Wushuang made a sudden move. He took the opportunity and rushed toward her when the Ancient Witch retracted her spears. He only used his finger as his sword and a raw sword-light directly hit the Ancient Witch’s body without any obstruction.

This attack was unable to hurt the Ancient Witch as she had defensive measures on top of wearing defensive armor underneath her clothes. However, she still turned pale.

“You’ve lost.” Jian Wushuang slowly spoke.

The Ancient Witch slightly trembled and held her fists tightly with her nails already dug into her flesh.

She had lost, she had really lost.

She had completely lost without any grounds to struggle and fight back.

There was a huge gap in their differences.

‘Space-time Law, this guy has an extremely high understanding of Space-time Law!!’ The Ancient Witch looked upwards and stared at Jian Wushuang.

She was not the only one. Her three other seniors were also staring at Jian Wushuang at this moment.

All of them saw the battle.

Jian Wushuang had only evaded the Ancient Witch’s attacks with his speed from the beginning. The Ancient Witch was really strong with powerful means with her spear movements speedy and extremely powerful. However, it did not matter how powerful her spear movements were as it was useless as long as she could not touch her opponent.

Jian Yi moved too fast.

He easily defeated the Ancient Witch with his absolute speed in this fight.

The Sacred Palace experts and disciples standing around the fighting area were also slightly stunned.

“H-he won?”

“He won over one of Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s heavenly pride?”

“He moves too fast and has a high-level understanding of Space-time Law. No wonder... No wonder he dared to proactively make a gamble. Turns out he’s confident he’ll win.”

“Who knew there’s a genius with such a high understanding of Space-time Law in our Sacred Palace?” The Sacred Palace disciples were all sighing.

They previously felt that Jian Wushuang was extremely arrogant when he proactively requested a gamble-fight and made a bet of 100 Divine Elixir Pills.

However, the situation at that moment... Jian Wushuang had kicked everybody’s asses with his actions.

“A hundred Divine Elixir Pills.” Jian Wushuang looked at the Ancient Witch with a smile on his face while stretching his right hand out. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Ancient Witch gritted her teeth and was about to take those pills out and give Jian Wushuang when...

“Let’s not be in a hurry.” The voice of someone speaking was heard before the red-haired young man who was one of the Ancient Witch’s seniors slowly walked forward.

He arrived in front of the Ancient Witch and comforted her. “Junior, both victory and defeat are normal during battles—especially when Jian Yi has a higher Peak Earth Ultimate God realm compared to you. He still has great natural advantages even though he did not use his Peak Earth Ultimate God’s divine power. It’s normal for you to lose, so there’s no need to be caught up by this.”

The Ancient Witch slightly nodded. Although she was unable to resign over her failure, she should not be defeated after only losing twice to Jian Yi.

Her name ‘Witch’ had mentioned a lot about her character and style of handling matters.

The red-haired man looked towards Jian Wushuang after comforting the Ancient Witch. “You’re Jian Yi? My name is Leng Xing and I’m also a Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciple.

“Are you also interested in carrying out a gamble-fight with me?” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

“Of course, I cannot pretend it’s nothing when I see my junior is being bullied as her senior brother,” said Leng Xing.

“We can carry out another gamble fight, but you need to give me the one hundred Divine Elixir Pills first,” said Jian Wushuang directly.

“I’m a Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciple, do you think I’ll refuse to give you some pills?” Leng Xing’s facial expression darkened.

“That’s difficult to say,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Leng Xing was speechless and could only flip his hand to come up with some Divine Elixir Pills. He gathered the pills alongside the Ancient Witch before passing 100 of them to Jian Wushuang.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang smiled in satisfaction when he took over the 100 Divine Elixir Pills before glancing at Leng Xing with a growing smile on his face. “You are the Senior Brother of the Ancient Witch and also a Peak Earth Ultimate God. I’m sure you’re much stronger than the Ancient Witch and richer. Why don’t we increase our bet slightly for this fight to two hundred Divine Elixir Pills?”

“Two hundred Divine Elixir Pills?” The corners of Leng Xing’s mouth trembled uncontrollably.

It was true that he was a heavenly pride of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion and not to mention the fact that the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion was extremely rich. However, Divine Elixir Pills were not like Primordial Stones that could be easily obtained.

He could not come up with 200 pills even after adding up everything he had.

“Alright, I agree.” Leng Xing directly nodded.

The Ancient Witch looked at him and softly said, “Senior Brother Leng Xing, Jian Yi is quite strong and has an extremely high understanding of Space-time Law. Apart from that, he easily defeated me without using his Principle World during our fight just now. He showed divine power far stronger than his level when I was defeated by him, hence you cannot look down at him. This gamble-fight...”
