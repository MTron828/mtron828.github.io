Chapter 370: Meeting Leng Rushuang Again

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Inside an exquisite courtyard, Jian Wushuang sat at a stone table with Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan.

Even though he had already destroyed Holy Emperor Palace, the expression on his face was still quite cold.

Holy Emperor Palace was just a puppet sect, controlled by Jiu Xiu and the force behind him. They were Jian Wushuang’s real target.

However, he had a long way to go.

“Big Brother, Second Brother, drink a little wine with me.” Jian Wushuang turned his hand over, then a wine pot and several cups appeared on the table.

“This wine isn’t Three-day Drunk again, is it?” asked Wang Yuan, a little crossly.

“Er...” Jian Wushuang was stunned at first, but then he smiled.

That smile broke the ice.

After a drink, Wang Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Third Bro, now that Holy Emperor Palace has been destroyed, what do you plan to do next?”

“I want to go to the Divine Land,” Jian Wushuang said.

Both Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan were surprised.

“The vast Divine Land,” exclaimed Wang Yuan. He had just heard of the Divine Land from his father.

“The Divine Land has a lot of experts, and Saint Realm experts are normal in the Divine Land. Compared with the Divine Land, the Nanyang Continent is just a tiny area. But I believe Third Brother will be able to accomplish big things there.”

Jian Wushuang softly smiled at him.

“The Divine Land is a haven for experts. Even my Master wants to go there. I plan to go as soon as I reach the Saint Realm,” Yang Zaixuan said seriously.

“You two...” Wang Yuan had a sad smile while listening to them. “Both of you have high talent, so it’s easy for you to reach the Saint Realm. However, with my strength... It will be hard for me to go there.”

Wang Yuan’s talent in cultivation was not as strong as the other three, but his talent in alchemy was exceptional.

“By the way, what about Fourth Sister?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.

Both Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan came here when they heard that he was going to destroy Holy Emperor Palace, but he didn’t see Su Rou.

“She...”

Both Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan remained silent.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“The thing is,”?Wang Yuan said, “Not long after your fight against Second Holy Master, an old woman came to her saying that she was her family and she would take her home.”

“Family? ” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

She had a family at one time, but hadn’t her family been killed?

“I didn’t believe her at first, but the old woman was able to turn her pupils red, just like Fourth Sister,” said Wang Yuan. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Blood-red pupils?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Yes. The old woman is unfathomable, and Fourth Sister said she felt close to the elder, as if they were family. So she agreed to go with her,” said Wang Yuan.

“Is that it?”

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly, “Fourth sister’s physique is unique. If the elder said she was her family, it must be because of her physique.”

Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, and Yang Zaixuan were chatting, suddenly...

“Jian Wushuang!”

A gentle voice echoed throughout the area and Jian Wushuang heard it.

Right away, the three of them went outside, where a white-bearded elder was floating and waiting.

His mild face was smiling and his eyes lit up like a starry sky.

Jian Wushuang was stunned upon seeing him.

He was sure that he hadn’t met this elder before, but he felt like the elder was close and unfathomable.

“May I know who you are?” Jian Wushuang looked at him and asked respectfully.

“My last name is Gu. I have come to you under our Lady’s order,” answered the elder.

“Lady?”Jian Wushuang was curious.

“Her last name is Leng, that might help you remember,” the white-bearded elder said while smiling.

Jian Wushuang understood immediately.

Leng... that should be Leng Rushuang and Leng Ruxue.

“Our Lady needs your help, so I hope that you can take a trip with me,” The white-bearded elder said.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He owed Leng Rushuang a favor, so he should pay her back.

“Please follow me,” said the white-bearded elder.

Jian Wushuang said goodbye to Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan and then followed after him.

...

In the Nature Residence, Tang Dynasty.

Jian Wushuang was familiar with it. After all, he had lived here for one month.

In front of a bamboo house, a cold beauty, Leng Rushuang, sat on a bamboo chair. A nifty young girl, Leng Rushuang’s sister, Leng Ruxue, stood beside her.

When she saw Jian Wushuang walking towards them, Leng Ruxue smiled and said, “Brother, you have come.”

“Jian Wushuang.” Leng Rushuang looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “It hasn’t been long, yet you have reached Divine Transcendence and even destroyed the overlord of Nanyang, Holy Emperor Palace. Amazing.”

“You flatter me. May I know why you invited me here?” Jian Wushuang said modestly.

“I need your help.” After saying that, Leng Rushuang glanced at Leng Ruxue.

Leng Ruxue was a clever girl, so she stuck her tongue out and then left.

Only Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang remained.

“Please sit down.”

Leng Rushuang waved her hand and a bamboo chair appeared.

Jian Wushuang sat down.

“There is a poison called Icy Heart Poison in my body.”

Looking at Jian Wushuang, Leng Rushuang said openly, “The poison is closely related to my Cultivation Method and my body. I have tried many different methods, but I failed to detoxify it, so I used a special method to seal it!”

“However, I was unable to seal it completely. Even now, there is still a small amount of poison remaining in my body that I can do nothing about.”

“Icy Heart Poison?”Jian Wushuang was shocked to his core.

He had never heard of this poison. But it should be an abnormal poison if an expert like Leng Rushuang couldn’t deal with it.

“If you can’t do anything, even with your power, how can I be of help?” Jian Wushuang asked.
