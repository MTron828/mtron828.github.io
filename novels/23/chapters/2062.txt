2063 Stage division

Jian Wushuang nodded immediately. He was curious and wanted to know more.

Between Great Emperors there could be a great difference in power level.

In the Sanctuary Alliance, except for Emperor Bai, the difference in power level between most Great Emperors was small. However, Jian Wushuang met Ling Zong and the massive middle-aged man in Three-Emperors World.

Both had power far greater than any of the Great Emperors.

Great Emperors, such as Abysmal Saint Master, who might have been the strongest in the Sanctuary Alliance, were still much weaker than people like Ling Zong.

Jian Wushuang, Red Dragon King and Great Emperor Zi Xu, who was just killed, were already much stronger than people like Abysmal Saint Master, much less superpowers the Demon King Chen Yu and Emperor Bai.

However, Demon King Chen Yu and Emperor Bai were still at the level of Great Emperor no matter how strong they were.

“In today’s Eternal Chaotic World, there is no division between the different levels of Great Emperor as there are too few Great Emperors in the Second Era. I estimate there to be around twenty or so in this world. I came from the first era, which was much more powerful than the second.” Emperor Bai smiled.

“In the first era, the number of people who were at the Great Emperor level ranged from the hundreds to even thousands. The difference in power was obvious due to the sheer number of Great Emperors that were around. Hence, the superpowers in the first era split the Great Emperor level into three stages.”

“The stage where most people are is stage one, which all the ordinary Great Emperors from back then fall under. Their understanding of Dao has reached the ninth level in the Doctrine Palace. Aside from me, Red Dragon King and you, the rest of the Great Emperors fall into stage one of Great Emperors. People such as Master of Abysmal palace and Ancestor Tian Chen are the strongest among them.

“The first stage of Great Emperor was the most commonly seen in the first era. More than ninety percent of the Great Emperors fall into this stage. On the other hand, Great Emperors from the second stage were all exceptional.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor Bai attentively.

“Great Emperors from this stage had a better understanding of Dao and their divine power were far greater than those in the first. Most importantly, these emperors mastered secret skills of terrifying power, or possessed unique bloodline power which enabled them to have fighting power far greater than those in stage one.”

“For example, the Red Dragon King has the bloodline power of an ancient dragon clan. That is the reason he is a stage two great emperor,” Emperor Bai said.

“I was lucky to inherit the bloodline power on the ancient battlefield. My fighting power skyrocketed once this bloodline power awakened not too long ago.” Red Dragon King smiled.

Jian Wushuang finally understand the division between the stages in the Great Emperor.

“There were few great emperors who had been in that stage back in the first era. All of them were overlords in the first era and every single one was a ruler of a certain empire, especially those who were the most powerful in stage two.”

“Even though great emperors classified as stage two were monsters, it was those who were classified as stage three that were at the top of this food chain!”

“The leap between stage two and stage three is where the true abilities of the great emperors are tested. From what I know, there were only so many stage one great emperors back in the first era. Even during the prime period, the number of stage one great emperors was no more than thirty! The best among them were Ancient God Emperor and Sword Emperor Dugu, who also happened to be the most famous.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“The reason for the huge difference in power level between stage two and stage three great emperors was not only due to the secret skills they mastered, but also because these stage one emperors managed to understand a little of the Rules of Order!!”

“Rules of Order?” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes as his heart skipped a beat.

“Judging by your reaction, I assume that you have heard of this?” Emperor Bai said as he looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

“Yes, I did.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He remembered the opportunity he had received in the stand-alone space within Eighth Lair.

There, he had met an ancient expert who was in slumber, as well as a dragon turtle… Long Qi.

Back then, Long Qi had asked him to meditate with the Seven Star Picture.

In ancient times, the Seven Star Picture had been used by disciples of the Seven Star Black Sect to mediate in order to understand the Rules of Order.

Jian Wushuang had learnt of the Rules of Order in this world. Back then, these powers had been too complex for him to comprehend, so he had not asked for any explanation.

Now, he was hearing of Rules of Order again.

“Rule or Order is the absolute power that the Heaven Way harnesses to run itself. It represents the Law of the Universe. The dao that we are meditating to now, such as Nine Heaven God Doctrine and Supreme Four Doctrine, will eventually evolve into Rules of Order.”

“Once this power is mastered, there will be a leap in the quality of your power.”

“This increase in quality will be much better compared to when the power of heaven way was initially mastered by the first universe god.”

“This is exactly why the stage three great emperors who managed to grasp even a little of Rules of Order will have fighting power far greater than those great emperors from state two. Demon King Chen Yu, who you met in Three-Emperors World, is a stage-three great emperor.” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang was shocked. “Demon King Chen Yu?”

He had fought the Demon King Chen Yu head on before. His power level was far from that of the demon king.

He could see how strong the Demon King Chen Yu was from how Jian Wushuang could barely keep the Demon King occupied even with the aid of a Self-defense mechanism and the Unique constitution that inverse cultivation gave him. He simply ran for his life and did not dare to fight the Demon King head on.

“Demon King Chen Yu has managed to grasp a little of the Rules of order. His secret skills are not very outstanding. He has just barely made the cut as a stage three great emperor, hence his fighting power is not that insane. However, Lord Fen, who rules the Holocaust Sect, is even stronger. He has the true power of a stage three emperor.”

Jian Wushuang finally understood the stage division among the great emperors.

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, “Great emperors are divided into three stages. Those in the first stage are ordinary and the weakest of them all. On the other hand, those in stage three grasp a little of the rules of order and are very powerful. As for me, I am probably an ordinary stage two emperor. My power is still far from that of a stage three.”

“In fact, these three stages were only a division set back in the first era. After these stages there should still be a stage four,” Emperor Bai said out of nowhere.
