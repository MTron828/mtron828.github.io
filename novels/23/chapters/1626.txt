Chapter 1627: The Final Trump Card

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Reincarnation World!”

When Jian Wushuang swung his big hands, a vast amount of Reincarnation Power surged and changed into grey air currents. In the end, the grey currents gathered and combined into a big grey world.

The grey world struck the red-haired, tall old man directly.

The red-haired, tall old man had a total of four heads. At that very moment, his four pairs of eyes were releasing thick murderous aura and even when covered by Reincarnation World, his aura still did not weaken at all.

At the same time, his eight sturdy arms moved.

From the eight arms, there might be a punch, slap, sharp claw or fingertip… even though he had different attack moves, his eight arms cooperated with one another beautifully.

Moreover, his four heads also opened their big mouths at the same time. Either their big mouths gave off shocking soundwave attacks or their eyes released thunderbolts.

In no time, all kinds of attack headed toward Jian Wushuang.

“Gosh!”

Jian Wushuang used his full power. He unleashed his comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine as well as his close-quarters combat abilities thoroughly. However, when he fought against the red-haired, tall old man, he was still pushed back instantly and even suppressed in just one face-off…

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body retreated hastily.

After he regained his posture, he could feel the trembling aura within his body, as well as the extreme pain in his shoulders and chest.

On the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor covering those two parts, there was a marking left behind by a sharp claw and a fist respectively.

“In just one face-off, I was hit by him twice. Moreover, I was shaken up by the soundwave attack. These close-quarters combat abilities…” Jian Wushuang clicked his tongue in admiration.

Frightening!

Four Heads, Eight Arms. The close-quarters combat abilities displayed by combining the different kinds of attack beautifully were way more fearful than the close-quarters combat abilities of any experts that Jian Wushuang had come across.

“Ancient Gods are generally proficient in close-quarters combat. Combined with this Unique Skill that is specific to them, they can be considered number one in terms of close-quarters combat among the clans of the Eternal Chaotic World. This Ancient God, who is currently fighting with you, is still alright as he only has four heads and eight arms. However, my old Master King Luo Zhen managed to hone this Unique Skill until he possessed eight heads and sixteen arms. Moreover, he was an Eight-star Royal Ancient God and if he were to have a fight in close-quarters… he would not be afraid in the slightest, even if two or three Almighties at the level of the founder of the Lineage of Star were to team up against him!” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice could be heard.

Jian Wushuang could not help but gasp in admiration.

The Star Palace Master and King Luo Zhen, who was an Eight-star Ancient God, belonged to the same level. Thus, they should have similar abilities.

However, by just comparing close-quarters combat abilities alone, with Eight Heads Sixteen Arms, King Luo Zhen could compete against two or even three Star Palace Masters alone and this was definitely not empty words.

The Ancient God Clan had always been recognized as the number one in terms of close-quarters combat.

“Since his close-quarters combat abilities are so strong, my martial art motion and Sword Principles will be useless against him. Hence, I can only depend on my special moves,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned serious and Divine Power rose from his body madly.

The Divine Ape, which was wearing golden armor and shrouding his body, also gave a furious roar. After that, its hands grabbed the longsword and raised it high up in the air.

At the moment it raised up the long sword, an overbearing sword essence rose.

Atop the void at the space of the sixth level, buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Crimson sword shadows appeared on the void and there was a total of sixteen of them.

For the sixteen crimson sword shadows, every one of them was so strong that it was suffocating and if a normal Eternal Real God were to come across any one of them, he would definitely be terrified.

However, at that moment, the sixteen crimson sword shadows were superimposed onto one another and fused into one.

Rumble~~~

The sword shadow that was formed by the fusion of the sixteen crimson sword shadow had earth-shaking power.

“Myriad Waves, kill!”

Jian Wushuang gave a fierce shout and the long sword in his hands were swung downward. At the same time, the new sword shadow that was formed by the sixteen crimson sword shadows also struck fiercely and abruptly.

At that moment, the universe was affected as well.

What an impressive amount of power!

When the red-haired, tall old man saw the giant crimson sword shadow, the eight eyes on his four heads shrank.

Straight away after that, his eight arms put their palms together.

“Eight Divine Mountains.”

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Lofty golden Divine Mountains descended abruptly.

Every golden Divine Mountain was about a hundred-thousand feet tall and they were emitting brilliant golden light. After counting, one could conclude that there was a total of eight similar Divine Mountains.

The eight Divine Mountains appeared in front of the red-haired, tall old man and became a total of eight obstacles.

When the shocking sword shadow that Jian Wushuang had unleashed came, the sword shadow struck the hundred-thousand foot tall Divine Mountain at the front straight away.

The first hundred-thousand foot tall Divine Mountain was destroyed instantly. The sword shadow then headed toward the second Divine Mountain, followed by the third Divine Mountain.

Five Divine Mountains were destroyed in one go. However, when it was the sixth Divine Mountain, the crimson sword shadow was hindered greatly and it was only after some time that it barely managed to destroy the sixth Divine Mountain. When the remaining power struck the seventh Divine Mountain, it was no longer able to destroy the seventh Divine Mountain.

In a split second, the sword shadow dissipated completely.

As Jian Wushuang stood in his position and looked at the two remaining Divine Mountains, his expression was unusually serious.

“My strongest move Myriad Waves was actually stopped by him so easily?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“It’s not considered easy. What he had just unleashed was the Eight Divine Mountains of the Four Unique Skills and this move is the only Unique Skill among the Four Unique Skills that is used for defending. Although he had used it to stop your Sword Principles, it must have cost him quite a considerable amount of his Ancient God Power,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Even though that’s the case, he still managed to stop it in the end. Moreover, although I have already used up all my moves, I am still unable to do anything to him. Hence, if I were to continue fighting him and be suppressed, the person who will be killed in the end will definitely be me,” Jian Wushuang frowned, “There’s no choice but to use my final trump card.”

Originally, Jian Wushuang did not plan to use his final trump card.

However, it was a pity that the abilities of the guard of the sixth level had exceeded his expectations completely. Although it was merely a top Stage Two Six-star Ancient God, the Ancient God Unique Skills that he had used were too powerful.

Jian Wushuang could only use that move.

Buzz~~~ A marvelous power rose from Jian Wushuang’s body and covered his body completely in the blink of an eye.

It was the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Moreover, it was the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

“I only have a breath’s time.”

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang exerted force on his feet fiercely and he moved like a ghost.

“Are you still going to struggle, even at the end?”

The red-haired, tall old man glanced at Jian Wushuang and he pointed out one of the fingers on his right hand fiercely.

The void was shattered into pieces and a giant finger which was emitting an infinite amount of dim light appeared out of thin air. It was the Ancient God’s Fifth Finger, Get Through Difficulty Finger again!

When the giant finger came, Jian Wushuang swung the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands ferociously.

Merciless sword essence tore the air apart, tore everything in the universe apart, and also ripped the giant finger in front of him into pieces.
