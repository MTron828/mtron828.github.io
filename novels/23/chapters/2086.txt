Chapter 2087 Leader of the Alliance

Everyone looked at Hei Qi.

He smiled lightly and continued, “Let’s not go into the character traits of the humans. From what I know, the Sanctuary Alliance has ten Great Emperors. They also have the unanimous strongest expert, Emperor Bai!”

“Has everyone here heard of Emperor Bai?”

Most of the leaders frowned when they heard this.

They had definitely heard of Emperor Bai.

Everyone within the Eternal Chaotic World regarded him as the strongest man, even those among the Special Tribes.

“If we ally with Sanctuary Alliance, our influence within this alliance won’t be as strong as theirs as we are slightly weaker. Emperor Bai can just overpower us if we discuss some matters within alliance. Who can stand against his might?”

“What if they simply make their own decisions in the face of an emergency in the future without discussing it with us? What should we do?”

“Hence, our Special Alliance needs a figurehead. This man needs to stand up to the pressure Emperor Bai and the Sanctuary Alliance to fight for our own rights!”

“This man can come from one of the leaders in the Special Tribes Alliance. He doesn’t need to have absolute power, but he must possess the ability to make on-the-spot decisions.”

“We could have one main leader, and a few co-leaders to supervise and aid in the running of the alliance. What does everyone feel about this?”

Hei Qi said confidently. It sounded as though he had rehearsed it many times

The experts remained silent after they heard what Hei Qi had said.

After giving it some thought, they felt that what Hei Qi said was right.

Making decisions would take too long if there were too many leaders who had equal power, each giving their own opinions on the matter.

Another factor to consider was whether the leader would give into the pressure when facing Emperor Bai and the Sanctuary Alliance.

“Who do you think should take up the role of this leader if we were to adopt this style of leadership within the alliance?” The beautiful Black Water Dragon Emperor in black clothing looked over at Hei Qi and asked.

“Haha. Like I said previously, the most important factor in becoming the leader of the Special Tribes Alliance is power and the the ability to stand up to Emperor Bai. This has always been the practice of our tribes since ancient times: the strongest man becoming the leader. In my opinion, the most suitable person for this job is the leader of the Sky-Swallowing Clan, Ba Su! He is the strongest man among the Special Tribes.

“He is the only person qualified to become the leader of the Special Tribes Alliance.”

Many of the experts nodded their heads in agreement after hearing what Hei Qi had said.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, your power determined your social status no matter where you were, even within the Special Tribes.

Just like what Hei Qi had said, the leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan, Ba Su, was the strongest man among the Special Tribes. He was was even stronger than King Chen Xing.

He met the conditions of being the leader of the alliance perfectly: he was the strongest man and was the leader of a top tier clan.

“My clan is willing to support Ba Su as the leader of the alliance!”

“My clan is willing as well.”

Many of the leaders started to give their opinions.

Many faces of many others, however, turned dark.

People like the leader of the God Eater Clan and the Black water Dragon Clan had were gloomy.

At the bottom of their hearts, they were extremely against the idea of Ba Su becoming the leader of the alliance.

This was because the Sky Swallowing Clan was a fierce clan that was ruled by force.

The people of this clan could absorb the blood essence of the members of the other Special Tribes in order to become stronger. They would hunt the experts from the other clans frequently.

More than half of the clans had had their members killed and devoured by the Sky Swallowing Clan.

Many of those clans hated the Sky Swallowing Clan to the core. However, they were too weak to do anything.

There were extremely unwilling for the leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan to be nominated to become the leader of the Special Tribes Alliance.

Even though they were unwilling for this to happen, they did not dare to stand up and go against the Sky Swallowing Clan. That would be equal to shaming them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Most of the leaders present were in this predicament.

They shifted their gazes to the three top tier clans.

They first scanned the leader of the God Eater Clan and the Black Water Dragon Clan before they shook their heads.

They knew that even though those two were all top tier clans, it would not be possible for them to stand up against the Sky Swallowing Clan.

Hence, they all looked at their last hope: the Ancient God Clan.

It was the only clan that could stand against the Sky Swallowing Clan.

Everyone set their sights on Jian Wushuang in anticipation.

This included the leaders of the God Eater Clan and the Black Water Dragon Clan.

As compared to the Sky Swallowing Clan, there were more willing for the Ancient God Clan to be the leader of the Special Tribes Alliance.

Jian Wushuang knew that everyone was looking at him hopefully. He smirked coldy and looked at the leader of the Black Bone Clan, Hei Qi, in the eyes. “Clan Leader Hei Qi, you just said that within the Special Tribes, everyone will look up to the strong. Hence, am I right to say only the strongest among us can become the leader of the alliance?”

“Yes. The Ancient God Clan has an extremely good reputation. You, too, as their leader, have the right to become the leader of the alliance. However, I heard that you became a Nine-star Ancient God not too long ago. You will not be able to stand up against Emperor Bai in terms of fighting power. Furthermore, you are far too young. This is why I chose to support lord Ba Su. I seek your understanding, my lord.” Hei Qi nodded his head and smiled.

“It’s alright. What you said was reasonable. Without absolute power, who dares to become the leader of the alliance? However, one’s power is not determined by what people say, but through a real fight!” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly and replied.

“Mr Ba Su, I have long heard that you are the undisputedly strongest man among the Special Tribes. Are you willing to have a brawl with me since we are both here today?”
