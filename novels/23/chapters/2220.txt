2221 The Backing of Real Martial Arts Divine Church

“All Almighties from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church have surfaced except me, and even brought your two Blood Slaves, but still we are no match against He Xiu. The Lineage of Stars may still have other experts hidden in the dark. I come to you with no other choice.” Emperor God Bai Xing said respectfully.

“Is that so?” The middle-aged man raised his eyebrows. “If that is the case, let me follow you, we’ll turn that He Xiu into a Blood Slave as well.”

“Thank you, my lord.” Emperor God Bai Xing was elated, and said, “I wonder if the other two lords are free to follow as well?”

“Hngh,” the middle-aged man sneered. “My two elder brothers are busy restoring their pinnacle fighting power, they don’t have time for this. The lineage of Stars do not need my elder brothers to appear, I can do it myself.”

The middle-aged man was not impressed.

Emperor God Bai Xing’s gaze moved.

Indeed, unless the Sword Emperor himself came down personally, no one could stop the middle-aged man.

Even if the Sword Emperor himself came down, he may not even become a worthy opponent.

Emperor God Bai Xing did not hesitate any longer and brought the middle-aged man towards the city.

A fierce battle was ongoing within the huge city.

There were more and more cultivators in the city, staring at that one battle.

For a normal cultivator, it was rare to witness battles with so many Almighties.

Many even recorded it with a Mirroring Token.

While the others were attracted by the battle, Jian Wushuang was still drinking aimlessly in that tavern, unbothered by what was happening outside.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s gaze moved.

“Is he here?” His Soul Power could sense an expert was approaching.

Indeed, a figure emerged from a Void far away and appeared in the middle of the city, in front of all the cultivators.

“Leader!” The four Sir Gods of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church were delighted.

“Is Emperor God Bai Xing!”

“The leader of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church has finally appeared.”

The surrounding cultivators all recognised Emperor God Bai Xing.

He Xiu stared at Emperor God Bai Xing as well.

Only Jian Wushuang paid no heed to Emperor God Bai Xing, but focused on another direction instead.

“Sealing off spacetime directly?”

“A clever spacetime seal method as well. Simply laying it down feels enough to block normal Great Emperor’s transmissions,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

With such methods, it was no wonder Great Emperors were unable to transmit.

Like Emperor God Ling Qu.

After sealing off the spacetime, a figure gradually appeared in the void.

It was a middle-aged man in a loose silver robe. His aura was strange – it felt like an ordinary Almighty, but it was definitely more than that.

“Bai Xing, there are too many people here,” the middle-aged man looked around with his cold eyes.

“Please take down He Xiu freely. I will handle the rest,” Emperor God Bai Xing smiled.

He knew what the middle-aged man meant.

He did not want too much attention from the experts of that Era, instructed by his two elder brothers. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Like the last time they had handled Emperor God Ling Qu, they had handled it properly and at a remote location – nothing had got out.

But now they were in a large city in front of so many cultivators. To make sure news did not spread, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church could only be crueller.

“I need to handle him?” The middle-aged man looked over He Xiu, like looking down on an ant.

He Xiu felt shivers running down his spine, being targeted by that middle-aged man. He had to control his trembles.

“He’s so strong!”

“Too strong!”

He Xiu clenched his teeth but showed no signs of fear.

After all, he was not alone. He had someone covering his back.

So what if the person was strong?

He could not possibly be stronger than Master, right?

“He Xiu, you must not be the only one from Lineage of Stars this time. Call out to all your experts behind you,” Emperor God Bai Xing laughed.

He was confident with the middle-aged man behind him.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang, who was drinking beside the window in the tavern, disappeared.

In a moment, he appeared beside He Xiu.

“Are you the backing behind the Real Martial Arts Divine Church?” A faint voice resonated.

Everyone was attracted by the voice and had their eyes on the young man beside He Xiu.

The man was in a red robe and stood there casually.

The aura of all the experts around were completely suppressed.

The entire city became peaceful.

This strange scene turned the faces of everyone around.

Emperor God Bai Xing of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and the few Sir Gods had their eyes dead on Jian Wushuang. Their eyes were virtually popping out of their sockets.

“Sword Emperor!”

A terrifying scream came out from Sir God Mo Qiu.

Sir God Mo Qiu felt his head almost exploding. He had only fear within him.

Unprecedented fear, dreadful fear!

This scream made the people present understand the identity of this person.

They all turned fanatical.

“Sword Emperor!”

“The Sword Emperor himself!”

“Leader of the Lineage of Stars, the highest leader of the Eternal Chaotic World, the strongest in the Eternal Chaotic World!”

“The legendary Sword Emperor appears in front of us?”

“I’m not dreaming, am I?” The countless cultivators were all dumbfounded.

Some almost slapped themselves to make sure it was not a dream.

The leader of the Eternal Chaotic World, Sword Emperor, had arrived!
