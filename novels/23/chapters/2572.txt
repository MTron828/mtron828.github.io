Chapter 2573: A Battle with San Shouwang

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

San Shouwang was seen delivering a simple and rough punch without using any secret techniques.

However, the many experts around them were completely startled and amazed when the strange and fierce beast appeared along with the terrifying surge of power.

“He’s indeed an Earth Ultimate God! He could crush a Peak Ultimate God easily with his divine power alone without performing any secret techniques!”

“The gap between an Earth Ultimate God and an ordinary Ultimate God is far too much. Even though Jian Yi has reached the Peak Ultimate God Realm, he’s still defenseless in front of an Earth Ultimate God.”

“I guess Jian Yi will die today.”

Many people secretly sighed as that was all they could do.

After all, it was clear that Jian Wushuang had a death wish.

To everyone’s surprise, Jian Wushuang moved just when the strange and fierce beast appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and charged down at him.

He did not draw out the Blood Peak Sword which he carried behind his back. Instead, a surge of divine power gathered in his hand and he released a single punch... Kaboom!

A loud bang exploded in the air.

Jian Wushuang’s fist hammered the strange and fierce beast as a terrifying force erupted.

That was a head-on fist-to-fist battle!

It was a direct confrontational fight!

Buzz... That strange beast became completely contorted as the divine power disseminated before the beast collapsed.

Jian Wushuang remained standing as he calmly withdrew his palm and patted his clothes off as though nothing had happened.

“Huh?” San Shouwang narrowed his gaze slightly as he curiously studied Jian Wushuang.

The experts watching the battle around the Combat Ring were in an uproar.

“He took a punch from the Territorial Lord?”

“He didn’t draw his sword but merely relied on his divine power and took a blow from the Territorial Lord?”

“Does that mean that Jian Yi isn’t inferior to the Territorial Lord in terms of divine power?”

Everyone was shocked.

How could a Peak Ultimate God’s divine power be comparable to an Earth Ultimate God?

“Jian Yi hid his strength when battling with us. Otherwise, his divine power alone would be enough to crush us,” Shi Clan Leader—Shi Qianhan exclaimed in a low voice. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

San Shouwang looked at Jian Wushuang again.

“No wonder you dare to challenge me. You have some strength after all,” said San Shouwang coldly.

“San Shouwang, you better show your true strength. Otherwise, not only you won’t get my battle armor, but you’ll also die here.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You want to take my life? I’m afraid that you don’t have the capabilities to do so yet.” San Shouwang snorted as he moved and a gush of divine power immediately surged within him.

“The All Beasts Way, Evolution!”

Roar! Roar! Moo! Whoop!

A myriad of strange beasts growling could be heard within the void.

Under everyone’s eyes, the vast divine power that flooded the void instantly evolved into many different types of odd monsters.

There were a giant dragon, wolf, mystical ape, blood phoenix, and many types of strange beasts numbering at least dozens of them.

Dozens of strange beasts appeared at the same time and attacked Jian Wushuang from every direction.

The impact of a single one of those strange beasts was extremely powerful, more so when there were dozens of them!

“Is he going for the Evolution Law?”

Jian Wushuang snorted and instantly pulled out the Blood Peak Sword from behind him.

Swash! Swash! Swash! Swash!

Jian Wushuang was seen casually swinging his sword. Occasionally, he would slash horizontally, stabbed straight, or hack around in rage. As rays of sword-light swept past the strange beasts, he attacked and killed all of them in the blink of an eye.

San Shouwang’s eyes were cold as his large hand slammed forward.

“The Big Palm Destroyer!”

Rumbling...

An enormous giant palm made up entirely of destructive powers appeared in the void above.

The giant palm crashed down on Jian Wushuang with its highly destructive ability.

Jian Wushuang raised his head as strong hatred filled his eyes!

Hate! Hate! Hate!

An infinite amount of hatred came through!

A hazy sword-light flickered to carving out a Hateful Path Toward Heaven in the void.

Chuck!

The giant destructive palm was instantly cut in half using the sword-light causing the infinite destructive power to begin melting away.

“San Shouwang, I’ve given you the chance to attack twice. It’s now my turn!”

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly as his figure started to madly evolve.

Hundreds of apparitions formed concurrently.

Yes, there were hundreds of apparitions!

When Jian Wushuang was in the secret chamber for a full year’s seclusion, he relied on the Fengtian Scroll to study both the Space-time Law and Transmigration Law—achieving tremendous improvement in both aspects.

Thereafter, he traveled in the Dark Thunder Territory for a year and three months. During that time, he focused on innovating sword techniques and sharpening his sword skills and had gained a deeper understanding of laws at the same time.

His understanding of both the Space-time Law and Transmigration Law had reached an exceptionally high level, especially the Space-time Law!

“Gosh!”

“So many apparitions!”

“Hundreds of them! There are hundreds of apparitions. Is Jian Yi so powerful with the Space-time Law?”

Outside the Combat Ring, many cultivators watching Jian Wushuang’s apparition were stupefied.

“Hundreds of apparitions?” Even San Shouwang was shocked.

The first stage of Space-time Law was to form apparitions.

The more apparitions that were formed, the higher one’s understanding of Space-time Law.

Ten, a hundred, and even a thousand apparitions forming at a time were considered different levels of achievement.

Even for Regular Ultimate Gods, forming ten apparitions at the same time was already considered something extremely terrifying. Therefore, forming a hundred apparitions at the same time was even more tyrannical and scarce even among Earth Ultimate Gods.

“This brat has such a high understanding of the Space-time Law?” San Shouwang’s eyes narrowed into slits. “Oh no! His sword skills...”

Jian Wushuang surrounded San Shouwang like a ghost with hundreds of apparitions formed at the same time and displaying the full potentials of his swords skills.

The higher his understanding of the Space-time Law, the faster his sword movements would be.

Jian Wushuang thrust his sword over and over again with his seemingly random movements. However, his speed horrified San Shouwang.

“Too fast! It’s way too fast!”

“His sword is moving way too fast that it’s hard to dodge it.”

San Shouwang tried his best to ward off the sword attacks but was still tormented by a great deal of pressure. It was clear that he was losing his abilities to defend after just a few strikes.

However, a fire of vengeance flashed across Jian Wushuang’s eyes.
