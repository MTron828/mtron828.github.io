Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were golden lights that flashed past, one after another. Every single flash aimed towards Sir God Qian Lan. Every single hit that contained fierce power that pushed Sir God Qian Lan backwards.

In Sir God Qian Lan’s eyes, there was a chilly gleam. He constantly wanted to shake off or break apart the golden light.

However, the speed of the golden light was too fast.

Hong Jun Golden Sword focused on Spacetime Power. The scariest aspect of it was its speed and flexibility.

The Hong Jun Golden Sword took the form of golden light and plunged into the void, just like Spacetime’s spoilt child that couldn’t be contained by Spacetime Power. It hit Sir God Qian Lan and made him fall back from the impact, then immediately it hit him again the second time. It didn’t give him any chance to prepare for a counter-attack.

Sir God Qian Lan was an Almighty. He had many tricks but he had no chance to perform them at all under the continuous hits of the golden light.

He was retreating from the continuous force of the golden light.

“Bastard, what is this?”

Hong Jun Golden Sword flew and hit Sir God Qian Lan over and over again. He felt aggrieved and the rage was soaring in his eyes.

“Too fast and too creepy, and it keeps coming. Unless I take one hit directly, I’ll have a chance to counterattack. But the power of golden light isn’t weak. After one hit, I’ll definitely be severely injured. This Jian Wushuang, I wonder where he learnt such a superior skill.” Sir God Qian Lan was thinking to himself and he couldn’t help but look at Jian Wushuang.

To take one hit of Hong Jun Golden Sword was a huge price to pay, but if he didn’t do so, he could only be suppressed by Hong Jun Golden Sword.

Of course, there was also another possibility. He could move closer to Jian Wushuang as he was suppressed, then fight in close combat with Jian Wushuang so he couldn’t control the Hong Jun Golden Sword.

Speaking of close combat, he gave up after he saw Jian Wushuang’s four heads and eight arms Ancient God body.

In Eternal Chaotic World, who didn’t know that Ancient God Tribe was the strongest in close combat? If he were to fight in close combat with an Ancient God, he would simply be courting death.

Hong Jun Golden Sword continued to hit and Sir God Qian Lan was at the state where he was suppressed and couldn’t counterattack.

Looking at the scene, Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his lips and smirked coldly, “With the Hong Jun Golden Sword that I performed with my all, I held Sir God Qian Lan back with just one sword. But I could only hold him back.”

Jian Wushuang was aware that Almighties were the strongest bunch of experts in Eternal Chaotic World and all of them were impressive. Their defense power was terrifyingly strong too.

Sir God Qian Lan was just hesitating about if he wanted to go all out. Once he opted to, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be at ease.

As for killing Sir God Qian Lan, it was an extravagant hope with Jian Wushuang’s current power.

“Although I can’t kill him, I can teach him a lesson,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze fixed. He drove Hong Jun Golden Sword with his soul power and continued to attack Sir God Qian Lan. As he pressured him, there was billowing divine power and Ancient God Power soaring from his body.

Rumble. His billowing divine power.

After a few repeated battles, Jian Wushuang expanded quite a lot of divine power. Then, he spent another twenty percent of his divine power.

He expanded twenty percent of his divine power in order to perform the technique.

The technique was the strongest technique of Ancient God Tribe.

“Secret skill of Ancient God, Moon Picking Skill!”

There was a glimpse of light that burst from Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Then, the billowing divine power suddenly swept out.

Vroom!

The void quivered.

Sir God Qian Lan, who was still blocking the attack of Hong Jun Golden Sword, his face changed.

He could clearly feel unique energy in the void around him. Suddenly, hualala. The void surrounding him instantly shattered.

The power spread towards him and it made him shiver. He looked terrified too.

At that moment, he felt that the entirety of heaven and earth, including the entirety of spacetime, was pressing towards him and was going to crush him into pieces.

It was too powerful and it was too strange.

It was as though he was being repelled by heaven and earth. It was as though he shouldn’t exist in the world.

“My body, I can’t move it?” Sir God Qian Lan looked surprised.

Yes, he couldn’t move.

No matter how he struggled, how he triggered his divine power, he couldn’t move. He could only quiver slightly at the most. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The repellent power of the spacetime pressed over him and he could only withstand it bluntly.

Moon Picking Skill was the only secret skill of Ancient God that involved Spacetime and it was also rather magical.

If the secret skill were to explode its extreme power, it could repel and break a person away from the spacetime. Then, it could drive the Spacetime Power of the entire heaven and earth to crush him into dust.

Jian Wushuang had just mastered the secret skill at a beginner level. He wasn’t good at it and he couldn’t give full play to the power of the secret skill.

Even so, the secret skill that he had performed could still pose a great threat against Sir God Qian Lan.

Psst psst psst!!!

There was a low divine power crushing sound that made Sir God Qian Lan in the void grew pale.

After quite some time, the pressing Spacetime Power calmed down and his figure became moveable again.

Swoosh!

A creepy golden light lit up again.

It maintained a fast speed and was unpredictable in action. Sir God Qian Lan couldn’t block it in time.

Hong Jun Golden Sword was like a sharp, golden awl that hit Sir God Qian Lan’s body brutally.

Sir God Qian Lan, who was an Almighty, had a strong divine body and had cultivated a secret skill of defense. He was also wearing armor. His defensive power was terrifyingly strong. However, as Hong Jung Golden Sword hit him, he spat a mouthful of blood and his aura instantly dropped.

The experts surrounding the battlefield saw the scene and everyone was dumbfounded.

“Injured? Sir God Qian Lan is injured?”

“An Almighty against a Real God, and the Almighty is severely injured.”

“Forget about the fact that Real God Jiu Gong and Real God Han Quan were defeated previously. They were only Real Gods, after all. But Sir God Qian Lan was a true Almighty. Jian Wushuang injured an Almighty?”

Unbelievable. Everyone found it unbelievable.

Real God Han Quan, who was watching the battle at the border of the battlefield, was staring with his eyes wide-open.

Real God Han Quan didn’t notice that Jian Wushuang, who had just performed Moon Picking Skill in collaboration of Hong Jun Golden Sword to injure Sir God Qian Lan, was looking at him with his pair of cold eyes.

“The lesson has been taught. Next…”

There was a chilly gleam in his eyes!
