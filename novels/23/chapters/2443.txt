Outside the Saint’s Tomb... UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“How impudent! How could they put a price on my fellow Narcissus Island disciple’s head? These people are from reputable sects, yet they had the audacity to act so brazenly!” Elder Wujian cursed with his voice reverberated across the glade.

“Second Elder, we from Narcissus Island have to do something about it,” said Elder Wujian again.

Elder Linghe said in a low voice, “Do something? What can we do? Should we just show up at their doors and question them? Even if we do that, what if they deny all responsibilities?”

Elder Wujian’s expression turned grave. “Deny? The news has traveled far and wide. How can they not admit to it?”

“That’s not necessarily true. Although news of the reward offer has been secretly circulated among the sects, none of those sects have publicly expressed their opinions. If they refuse to admit even when we question them, we will not be able to do anything to them either,” said Elder Linghe.

“Bastards.” Elder Wujian was furious, but he had to admit what Elder Linghe had said was reasonable.

“The current situation is beyond Narcissus Island’s control. These sects have suffered such big losses in Jian Wushuang’s hands. We can’t do much if they placed a price on his head. Wujian, the only thing you can do right now is to inform Jian Wushuang about this, so that he can be prepared,” said Elder Linghe.

Elder Wujian’s complexion flushed and helplessly nodded after pondering for a long time. “Understood.”

Elder Wujian immediately acted and informed Jian Wushuang of the news.

In a void inside the Saint’s Tomb.

“Such a lucrative price on my head?”

“10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power, three Pinnacle Ground Treasure, and even a Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir. Haha, these sects really think highly of me.”

Jian Wushuang indifferently smiled. He was not worried at all.

‘Big Sister and the rest deliberately spread the news that they have two position tokens in their hands in order to take away some pressure from me, but with this price on my head now, it has once again pushed me into the cusp of a storm.’

Well, now that I don’t have any more scruples, I’ll have some fun with these genius disciples.’

Jian Wushuang’s mouth curled up slightly and there was an astonishing cold glare in his deep-set eyes.

The atmosphere in the tomb turned cold.

The cold wind unbridled blew.

In the inner area, Jian Wushuang carried his long sword and wandered alone in the void.

Many genius disciples from the various sects gathered in the small inner area. Furthermore, Jian Wushuang’s wanton act made him exceptionally noticeable.

“That is Jian Wushuang!”

“Yes, it’s him and he’s alone!”

They were the eight genius disciples from the One Direction Sect. Among them were two First-Class Divine Demons and six Second-Class Divine Demons.

Their eyes flashed with anger when they saw Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s head was worth 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power, three Pinnacle Ground Treasure, and even a Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir.

“Senior Brother, shall we do it?” asked a Second-Class Divine Demon.

“Nonsense. Of course, we shall. If we could kill Jian Wushuang, it doesn’t matter even if we don’t get a seat to look at the Fengtian Scroll.” A First-Class Divine Demon leading the group had a frenzy look on his face and could not hide his intent to kill Jian Wushuang.

“Remember, although Jian Wushuang is at Peak Chaotic Realm, he’s known to be extremely powerful. Even the Great Compassion Sect’s Pang Tao died in his hands for some reason. We have to do it, but we must not take it lightly. We have to give our all when we strike!” exhorted the First-Class Divine Demon.

“Yes.” Those Second-Class Divine Demons disciples nodded.

“Go!”

Under the command and guidance of the two First-Class Divine Demons, those eight One Direction Sect disciples sprang out from the side and attacked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang paused and gave the eight disciples who went right at him a sideways glance. His Blood Mountain Sword was unsheathed behind him.

Swash!

Jian Wushuang’s figure disappeared out of thin air.

He was in front of the eight disciples when he appeared again with two sword-lights lit up.

One of the sword-lights was bright and dazzling while the other had a mysterious charm.

They were both incredibly fast.

They were too fast for the First-Class Divine Demons to react.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

It was the sounds of a blade entering their bodies.

Jian Wushuang was back to the original place where he was first spotted.

His expression was cold and stern as he stared at the eight corpses who were falling downwards in the void ahead.

“Two ordinary First-Class Divine Demons and six Second-Class Divine Demons. How stupid of them to dream of killing me.”

Jian Wushuang smiled contemptuously and did not bother to take a second look at the eight corpses before continuing his advance forward.

Outside the Saint’s Tomb...

“The latest news was that eight Clear Moon Valley disciples fought against Jian Wushuang head-on, and none were spared. The two First-Class Divine Demons disciples who possessed Safety Tokens also had no time to crush their tokens and were all killed.”

The news spread and caused a lot of commotion in the glade.

“Oh no. My condolences to the Clear Moon Valley.”

“Jian Wushuang is indeed very powerful.”

“He is ruthless and has no mercy.”

Many powerful experts from various sects were admiring Jian Wushuang’s power.

But shortly after the news came about...

“Six Refining Fire Palace disciples and seven Water Moon Pavilion disciples joined forces to fight Jian Wushuang, but the entire lineup was killed in merely two breaths of time!”

“22 disciples from Crimson Hand Sect, Purple Robe Division, and Everlasting Heaven Temple joined forces to kill Jian Wushuang. 21 disciples were killed on the spot, and only one fortunate First-Class Divine Demon escaped by crushing his Safety Token.”

“The four major sects—Fire Thunder Mountain, Purple Heaven Sect, Void Temple, and Dark Feather Sect joined forces but were defeated by Jian Wushuang with most of their disciples killed.”

The bad news kept coming one after another.

The inner area was not spacious and Jian Wushuang was bound to run into those genius disciples from other sects as he roamed freely in the area.

Most of those genius disciples would join forces and launch attacks at Jian Wushuang.

However, the results were depressing!

Those genius disciples were like lambs, waiting to be slaughtered by Jian Wushuang without mercy.

One sect, two sects, three sects...

After the news about the reward was announced, Jian Wushuang had encountered dozens of besieges and a series of onslaughts within half a day. As a result, among the dozens of sects who went into the tomb, thirteen were knocked out. Most of those disciples from the remaining sects were also killed. In just less than half a day, more than 150 various sects’ genius disciples died in Jian Wushuang’s hands!
