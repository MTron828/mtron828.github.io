“I was just casually saying at first. I never thought Universe God Xia Hou would really come and that his mental state would so strong that he reached the final stage of the third test.”

The black-haired elderly from Water Moon Pavilion said excitedly as his eyes shone.

The appearance of Universe God Xia Hou surprised everyone.

As time continued to fly past, Tian Can was the first to come back to reality among the six finalists.

Tian Can had already tried his best. The longer he stayed in the void corridor, the more difficult it was for him to endure. He had no alternative.

Right after Tian Can woke up, it was… God Destroying King!

God Destroying King, who was the number one among the Universe Gods, surprised many as he only managed to make it to that stage.

In the lofty hall, the Almighties sighed with emotion.

“Because of his backer, God Destroying King receives many resources. After he experienced all kinds of hardship, he became unusually strong and his mental state is terrifying too. However, he has a powerful connection to count on. Hence, his mental state couldn’t reach its peak and he couldn’t leap over!”

The third test continued.

After Tian Can and God Destroying King woke up, there were only four of them left.

In the blink of an eye, another four hours passed and Xin Zhu came back to reality too.

Since then, those who continued to travel in the void corridor were Jian Wushuang, Duan Lingfeng and Universe God Xia Hou.

“Universe God Xia Hou, it’s your call!”

“For your wife! You have to persist and not waver!”

The black-haired elderly from Water Moon Pavilion clenched his fists as he bellowed.

Just then, he received an update that Universe God Xia Hou had already woken up.

“He woke up?”

The black-haired elderly’s face immediately grew grave. Then, he quickly sighed and seemed to be disappointed, “Forget it. I can’t make a pre-emptive request to get the White Blaze Fruit Tree. Plus, Universe God Xia Hou did try his best.”

“Hei Hun, it seems that Universe God Xia Hou didn’t strive hard enough for you,” the brawny man smiled smugly at the failure of his Universe God.

“Humph, Universe God Xia Hou didn’t make it to the last in the third test but he was much more outstanding than the Universe God under your command. His wife, we Water Moon Pavilion would still rescue her,” the black-haired elderly said in a low voice.

“Oh?” The brawny man’s pupils contracted but he didn’t say anything further.

On the open ground on the third level of the cave, countless Universe Gods stared at the two people with bright, sparkling eyes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The two of them were the two most eye-catching ones in the third test.

They were Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng!

“How could it be? Why haven’t they come out from the dreamland?”

“It has been so long. It has already been two days and two nights in reality, it must have been even longer in the dreamland.”

“Universe God Xia Hou, you’re in third place. How long have you traveled in the void corridor?” Someone asked.

“To be frank, I only kept on walking forward in the void corridor but didn’t record the time in detail. It should be around one hundred and five thousand years,” Universe God Xia Hou replied.

“A hundred and five thousand years?”

“Oh my goodness!”

“In such boring and uneventful travel, you stayed in there for a hundred and five thousand years. Is this humane?”

“Universe God Xia Hou stayed for so long. Then, aren’t Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng spending an even longer time in it?”

“How did they do it? Is their mental strength so strong?”

The one hundred thousand Universe Gods on the open ground were astonished.

Even God Destroying King, who was extremely strong, couldn’t help but steal a glance at Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng. He was quietly looking at them in admiration.

It had been one hundred and five thousand years, and they continued to persist… One should know that they had only been plunging forward blindly in the void corridor for a hundred thousand years.

In the blink of an eye, another four hours passed.

Then, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng reached the three days mark in the dreamland.

Just then…

The two people who stood right in the middle of the open ground that everyone was watching suddenly moved. The two of them opened their eyes at the same time.

“They woke up!”

“They finally woke up.”

“This, why did the two of them wake up at the same time?”

The surrounding Universe Gods’ facial expressions grew strange.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng understood and they exchanged a look.

“It seems like you and I are the same. We both reached the end of the corridor,” Jian Wushuang smiled and asked, “How many years have you walked in the corridor?”

“One hundred and eight thousand years, how about you?” Duan Lingfeng asked.

“Same as you,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The speed didn’t matter when one was traveling in the void corridor.

Even if you were plunging forward at the traveling speed beyond a Real God, you still had to travel for a hundred and eight thousand years.

But if you were to opt to not plunge forward but slowly walk, you would have to use one hundred and eight thousand years to reach the end too.

The crucial point was that you couldn’t waver by any bit within the one hundred and eight thousand years and you had to endure the boring, uneventful torture.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng had made it.

The Universe Gods surrounding the two of them heard their conversation and they gasped in admiration.

One hundred and eight thousand years!

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng walked in the void corridor for one hundred and eight thousand years?

During the one hundred and eight thousand years, they weren’t cultivating but purely plunging forward. They wouldn’t run into anything on their way, only a never-ending corridor.

The two of them had held out to the end.

The Universe Gods also could tell from their conversation that they had reached the end of the corridor and they shook off the dreamland officially to come back to reality. In other words, if there were to be no end to the corridor, they could stay in the dreamland even longer!

Just how terrifying were their mental strengths?

“If I’m not mistaken, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng should have reached the first stage in terms of mental strength and be at a pretty high level.

In the lofty hall, the Almighties started discussing.

“True. To be able to walk to the end of the void corridor, the lowest threshold is to achieve the first stage of mental state. Most of the Real Gods has yet to even reach the first stage but they could reach this stage as Universe Gods. This is unbelievable. It is much more difficult than comprehending a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way. Both Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng are monstrous!”

“Actually, the first stage of mental state, Universe God Xia Hou achieved it too. However, he should have just leapt in not long ago and it has yet to grow solid. Otherwise, he might stand a chance to walk till the end.

“Regardless, the third test has ended too.”

“It ended, but both Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng passed the test. How will they share the White Blaze Fruit Tree for the third test?”
