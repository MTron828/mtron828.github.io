Chapter 5260: The Chosen One

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Vermilion Bird Temple.

Hundreds of seasoned veterans had been revived, although now they only guided the younger generation. The aura of these former powerhouses lingered, refusing to dissipate.

In the presence of Zhu Yi, they were all seniors, a fact even she hesitated to contest. She could only manage an awkward smile from her prominent seat.

“Master Zhu, I heard that in the Original Planet Alpha 9, there’s a Grand Yan Immortal who has caught the attention of Lord True Spirit. I wonder if it’s true!” The speaker was an old man with white, ancient-looking horns protruding from his head.

At the mention of Lord True Spirit, an involuntary shiver ran through the crowd. Despite their recent revival, they had heard from the ancient ones that this Lord True Spirit was eccentric and extremely domineering. Even the core four halls left by Qishen were beneath his notice. The highest trials were his sole prerogative.

In the God’s Tomb, rebels were rampant.

Ignoring everything, Lord True Spirit insisted on reorganizing the four major secrets realms, throwing everything into chaos.

They had heard about these matters, but they weren’t part of the core lineage of Qishen Temple. In ancient times, they were merely laborers brought over by Qishen. However, Qishen had promised them that they would become elders of Qishen Temple in the future.

Now, these elders had been plucked from the sea of origin source of Qishen

Temple by Lord True Spirit. They had many questions, but upon hearing about Lord True Spirit’s strange temper, they dared not ask too much.

In this situation, they could only cautiously inquire of the leader of the Vermilion Bird Temple.

Zhu sat at the top, raising an eyebrow. The seven apertures of her heart subtly circulated, and her smile disappeared, replaced by a serious expression. She scanned the group of elders below.

“It’s true, esteemed predecessors. There is indeed such a person. Lord True Spirit is willing to open the second phase of the trial in advance for this individual and has even altered the rules set by Qishen in the past.”

“Ah! H-how can he do such a thing?”

The old man with goat horns pondered, and the numerous strong individuals were merely surprised, not daring to speculate.

Even the rules set by the Qishen God could be altered. This True Spirit was indeed extraordinary. At least, the current situation indicated that the heavens were about to change. Although the Qishen had promised them, he had long since fallen.

Now, the entire Qishen Temple followed the True Spirit’s orders.

This fact had been confirmed now.

Moreover, their revival was also related to that True Spirit!

True Spirit had gone to the four great secret realms, taking advantage of the second phase of the trial to release them.

“Haha, the Grand Yan Immortal chosen by True Spirit, we must observe carefully,” someone said, breaking the chilly atmosphere.

To shift the focus, someone brought up the Grand Yan Immortal chosen by True Spirit. They were curious about the person chosen by True Spirit, especially since it led to changes in the established rules.

“Original Planet Alpha 9!”

“Could it be Wan Xing that Qiuhuang favored?”

At this moment, Qiuhuang was sitting at the end, his small eyes squinting at the many elders above him, his figure inconspicuous.

Hearing someone mention his name, he trembled and hurriedly stood up to explain, “Wan Xing’s strength is indeed not bad. He hasn’t reached the Ultimate Dao, but he has cultivated a special mastery. His combat power is at the level of a half-step Emperor, and he has also exchanged for an imitation of an eternal treasure, making his strength comparable to an Emperor.”

Hearing ‘comparable to an Emperor’, the crowd involuntarily gasped.

“Comparable to an Emperor, and he is a second-grade origin source Dao. This child has the potential to step into tier 6.”

Many people nodded in agreement.

On the Original Planet, Grand Yan Immortals comparable to Emperors were rare, but they hadn’t yet drawn significant attention. When Qiuhuang spoke, mentioning second-grade origin source Daos on par with Emperors, it surprised them.

Those with half-step Emperor power among the second-grade origin source Daos were relatively common, but those strong enough to rival Emperors were exceptionally rare. The ability to match Emperors as second-grade origin source Dao users was uncommon.

Replicated Eternal Treasures couldn’t elevate just anyone to such an extent.

Those who could wield the second-grade origin source Dao with the ‘Eightfold Cloud Dragon Seal’ were exceptionally scarce. Second-grade origin source experts capable of using the ‘Eightfold Cloud Dragon Seal’ were extremely rare. There had to be a connection with that special technique.

As the crowd involuntarily looked towards the celestial canopy and Wan Xing, Qiuhuang spoke again.

“However, the one I have my eye on isn’t him. He’s undeniably powerful, but there’s another person on Original Planet Alpha 9 who can contend with him.”

“Someone else? Could it be that youth named Jian Wushuang? I heard he possesses a damaged Beast God Weapon!”

Qiuhuang revealed a pleased expression, continuing, “That’s him.

Furthermore, he is a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, not yet at the Perfected Nine Revolutions, but he already possesses half-step Emperor power.”

“I believe that Lord True Spirit should consider him seriously,” he added.

The old man with horns nodded in agreement. “I agree with Qiuhuang, my friend.

Zhu Yi, seated at the top of the hall, remained silent, observing quietly.

“I thought Alpha 9 was formidable enough, but suddenly several half-step

Emperors emerge. I didn’t expect Alpha 9 to harbor such talented individuals.”

“Indeed! Not only do we have the Grand Yan Immortal favored by Lord True Spirit, but also several outstanding geniuses. That young monk named Hu Qing seems promising too. He’s exceptionally low-key, with an indomitable will. He’s a good seedling.”

Due to True Spirit’s influence, many elders gazed at Original Planet Alpha 9 through the celestial canopy.

“Look, this eighth wave of attacks on the city serves as a small threshold. A million 3-Star Devouring Demons, those little guys are in trouble.”

Everyone followed the direction of the sky and saw Qiuhuang City on the Original Planet Alpha 9.

Horns blared.

A million 3-Star Devouring Demons stood ready, and as soon as the horns sounded, they charged out of the black mist, heading for the northern gate of Qiuhuang City.

Guarding this gate were Hu Qing and Ji Chaoyang.

This time, no one harbored ill feelings towards them. The Devouring Demons emanated an unstoppable aura.

Even those at the peak of Grand Yan Immortal, they had retreated to the city walls. The tide was overwhelming, capable of submerging even these extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals, making them perish amidst it.

“Haha, a million Devouring Demons, all 3-Star, how delightful!” Ji Chaoyang was exhilarated, his figure remarkably robust as he stood at the forefront.

As the Devouring Demon attacked, the two of them transformed into a streak of light, instantly infiltrating the million-strong army.

“What is this? The power of space!”

A diamond-shaped space surged, Ji Chaoyang’s hair disheveled. Within his space, he seemed to be an invincible deity.

On the other side, Hu Qing remained steadfast, having transformed into a silver staff, stretching millions of miles. He single-handedly halted the advance of the million 3-Star Devouring Demons, preventing them from progressing.

Hiss!

In the Vermilion Bird Temple.

The elders watched in astonishment!

Except for Leng Shuang and Xue Yue, the performances on the other three city walls were almost flawless.

Especially Wan Xing, the Heavenly Emperor who wielded the ‘Eightfold Cloud

Dragon Seal’.

The Grand Yan Immortal who dared to take on this title was indeed extraordinary. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

On his city wall, he transformed into a god, standing 10,000-feet tall, wearing a light silver-patterned robe. Every move he made exuded the aura of an Emperor..
