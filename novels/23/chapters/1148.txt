Chapter 1149: A Red-Haired Youth

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The five Palace Masters were shocked when hearing Jian Wushuang describe the fight between the three kings and himself in a relaxed tone.

“Are you saying that you’ve just engaged the three kings in battle?” Void Temple Master asked Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded and replied.

“And the three kings failed to kill you even when they worked together?” asked Void Temple Master.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded and replied again.

“How is this possible?” all the five Palace Masters were astonished.

All the nine kings of the Jin Kingdom were powerful Universe Masters with formidable battle strength.

Generally speaking, it was just a piece of cake for anyone of them to kill a Holy Master with Exceptional Realm. When three kings worked together, only the most experienced Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace, such as Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master, could manage to resist them.

However, these three kings failed to kill Jian Wushuang. The five Palace Masters felt bewildered.

“I’ve reached the levels of a Dao Master.” Jian Wushuang explained.

“Even a Dao Master can’t be this powerful,” Void Temple Master said with a frown. A moment later, he added, “Jian Wushuang, can you tell me how they look and what they’re good at. I want to know who they are.”

“One of them is Tianying King. I’ve fought against him before. As for the other two, one is a woman versed in the use of consciousness attack, and the other is a man who uses large axes,” Jian Wushuang said and then described the two kings’ looks to the Palace Masters.

After hearing his description, the five Palace Masters quickly agreed on who the two kings were.

“The woman is Tianhuan King and the man is Golden Rock King. They and Tianying King worked together to ambush you.”

Void Temple Master continued with a solemn face. “Among the three kings, Golden Rock King is the most powerful one, Tianhuan King is the most crafty one and Tianying King is the weakest in terms of physical strength. However, this Tianying King is a tough fighter and he moves exceptionally fast. When working together, they can easily finish off an ordinary Universe Master.”

Upon hearing Void Temple Master’s analysis, all the other four Palace Masters nodded in agreement. At the same time, they were impressed by Jian Wushuang’s performance.

Golden Rock King was good at attacking, Tianying King was adept at trapping his enemy and Tianhuan King was expert in consciousness attacks. They did have the abilities to kill a Universe Master.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang had forced them to go all-out and managed to survive and escape their clutches.

“It looks like that we’ve underestimated Jian Wushuang. Now that he’s able to take on three kings from the Jin Kingdom at the same time, he must have powers similar to those of a Universe Master. He’s just become a Dao Master but is able to compete with us now. When he reaches the levels of a Holy Master…” said Void Temple Master, excitement flickered in his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang, the Jin Kingdom must’ve noticed your potentials That’s why it wants you dead now. It just has underestimated your powers this time. It’ll send some other experts to attack you again. Given this, you must return to Green Fire Palace after shaking off the three kings,” Samsara Temple Master said solemnly.

“Yes, Palace Master,” Jian Wushuang nodded and replied.

He was clear how much the Jin Kingdom wanted to kill him.

After all, it had sent such a formidable team consisted of three kings to ambush him.

Suddenly, something unexpected happened.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang looked forward, his face changed.

He maintained his Quicksand Realm all this while and kept searching his surroundings with his Strength of Soul while moving forward.

At this moment, he sensed that a person was standing in front of him.

It was a red-haired youth. He stood there with a spear in hand, looking calm and cool.

His aura seemed ordinary, but Jian Wushuang somehow felt overwhelmingly intimidated by him.

“Is he also a Universe Master from the Jin Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang wondered nervously.

“Being ambushed by three kings from the Jin Kingdom felt unreal enough, and now another Universe Master from the Jin Kingdom popped out. He seems to have hidden in the shadows all this while.

“Compared to the other three Universe Masters, he looks even more powerful.”

“Jian Wushuang, I can tell that this Universe Master before you is not an ordinary one. He’s much more powerful than the three kings behind you. You have to be very careful,” said Gu King.

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang looked grave.

At this moment, the red-haired youth in front of him was staring stonily at him while standing quietly in the void with a spear in his hand.

“This is really ridiculous. Three Universe Masters failed to kill a Dao Master. What a bunch of bums! Now, let me clean up this mess,” said the youth, grumpily.

He was also on the mission to kill Jian Wushuang.

However, he just came to help the three kings in case some Palace Master of the Green Fire Palace suddenly came to Jian Wushuang’s rescue.

According to his original plan, if there was not such a Palace Master, he would never join the fight or even reveal himself.

Beyond his expectations, it was not some top-notch expert from the Green Fire Palace but the powers of Jian Wushuang that forced him to come out.

He had to join the fight to complete his mission when the three kings tried their best but still failed to kill Jian Wushuang.

“I’m going to expose myself by engaging Jian Wushuang in battle. By doing so, I won’t be able to remain as a hidden trump card until the decisive battle against the Green Fire Palace begins. This can be bad for the Jin Kingdom, but I have to kill this incredibly talented youth now. Otherwise, he’ll pose a serious threat to us in the future.

“I cannot give this brat any chance to survive and grow stronger. I must kill him now even if this will expose myself!”?thought the red-haired youth.

He tightly gripped the long red spear in his hand and then turned himself into a flowing red light, dashing toward Jian Wushuang.

“Watch out, Jian Wushuang!” Gu King groaned.

Jian Wushuang was fully alerted and fixed his gaze upon the flowing red light.

When the light reached the edge of his Blaze Quicksand storm, he shouted.

“Quicksand Realm, drive him away!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang rendered full support to his Quicksand Realm and urged it to press down on the red-haired youth.

Blaze Quicksand roared and pressed on the red-haired youth. Violent storms quickly formed in front of him, blocking his way.

However, the Quicksand Realm only managed to block him for a second. The next moment, he thrust his long spear forward, while shouting.

“Cleave through the storm!”

Suddenly, it began to snow in the void which surrounded them, and the snowflakes looked as red as blood.

The icy spear head dashed forward with remarkable speed and ferocity.

“Swoosh—” It cut through the sandstorms.

The next moment, he thrust his spear further into the storms to attack Jian Wushuang.

Upon seeing the spear rapidly approaching, Jian Wushuang could only use his Swordplay of Coalescence to counterattack. He gave full play to the power of First Move of the Heaven’s Bane.
