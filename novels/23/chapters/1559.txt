Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, have you already passed inverse cultivation test or are you still in the process of the test?” Hall Master Yuan creased his eyebrows as he asked.

“Should be still in the process of the test,” Jian Wushuang replied, “And I can feel that my third inverse cultivation test will be much longer than the two previous inverse cultivation test. In other words, my current state will remain for quite some time.”

“How much longer?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“I don’t know,” Jian Wushuang shook his head. He knew that he was passing through the test and the test would take very long but he couldn’t determine just how long exactly it would last for.

“Such a strange test, I have never heard about it before. This is troublesome,” Hall Master Yuan said in a deep voice.

“Really troublesome.”

Even with Jian Wushuang’s mental state, he could feel a faint helplessness.

One should know that ever since he started cultivation, he had only relied on his own power. With his power, he was confident. Even if he were to run into strong enemies, he would figure out a way to grow in an unfavorable environment.

But then, his power was non-existent!

“Regardless, as your inverse cultivation test has descended, everything that is meant to happen is going to happen. Plus, I can only rely on myself to go through this inverse cultivation test, no one else can help me with it.”

“I will endure everything on my own.”

Very soon, Jian Wushuang had left the cave dwelling and walked towards his Sword Star.

As for Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao, they went to search for ancient books to see if they could find any solution.

In Lineage of Star, among the rolling palaces.

Jian Wushuang, who was hoary-looking with grey hair, was slowly walking forward. His footsteps were very slow. After all, not only did he become a commoner, he became a grey-haired elderly. He didn’t possess any power. To him, every step that he took was difficult too.

On the way, he naturally ran into many disciples of Lineage of Star.

When the disciples of Lineage of Star saw Jian Wushuang, they were shocked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Who is this person? Who would he carry the token of disciples of Star Palace on him?”

“Disciples of Star Palace? Impossible. I’ve never seen him. Plus, this person didn’t seem to have any fluctuations of divine power.

“Commoner? Really?”

At first, the disciples didn’t even recognize Jian Wushuang but were only suspicious about why Jian Wushuang was carrying the token of disciples of Star Palace.

But, very soon…

“Mm, this person, he looks like Senior Wushuang.”

“What nonsense are you talking about? Senior Wushuang is such an amazing genius. How could he be related to this old man that doesn’t even have any fluctuations of divine power?”

“But his life aura is exactly the same as Senior Wushuang’s. I’ve seen Senior Wushuang before, that’s why I’m familiar with Senior Wushuang’s life aura.

“It’s really Senior Wushuang’s life aura?”

A person’s facial features and body could change but his life aura would never change.

The disciples saw Jian Wushuang but couldn’t recognize him. Whoever had seen him before could recognize his life aura though.

“Senior Wushuang, how come he changed like that?”

“This… this is clearly an old man who is dying. How could it be the Senior Wushuang I adore? I don’t believe this, I won’t believe this!”

“Impossible. Senior Wushuang is so amazing. It’s impossible that he would change like this.”

Many disciples roared angrily and were not willing to believe what they saw.

They followed Jian Wushuang. When they saw Jian Wushuang walk towards Sword Star and Qiu Yue, who was the leader among the maidservants in Sword Star, escort and ‘help’ him personally to get into Sword Star, the disciples of Lineage of Star finally believed it.

The old man who looked like he was going to die at any time was Jian Wushuang!

On that day itself, Hall Master Yuan announced personally that when Jian Wushuang was wandering outside, someone had plotted against him and he had gotten poisoned. Hence, he had lost all his power and he couldn’t recover in a short period of time.

The moment the announcement was made, the entire Lineage of Star shook and everyone was bubbling over.

On Sword Star.

Jian Wushuang sat down on a chair slowly. Qiu Yue and the other maidservants stood there politely and they obviously looked concerned.

Especially Qiu Yue.

“Mister, what has happened to you?” Qiu Yue asked anxiously.

“Don’t worry, I’m okay. I’ll recover in no time. As for the rumors outside, don’t worry about it,” Jian Wushuang said.

Although Jian Wushuang said so, Qiu Yue was still very worried.

Jian Wushuang didn’t say much but came to the secret room where he cultivated in seclusion on Sword Start.

He sat down in the secret room, but his face looked solemn.

Although he had behaved at ease before Hall Master Yuan, Qiu Yue and the others, in actual fact, he was even more worried than anyone else.

“I cultivated over the years, went through so much training, fought life-and-death battles, in exchange for my power. It vanished just like that.”

“And, of all times, it happens to be when I got to see Leng Ruxue and when I desired power the most. It just suddenly descended!”

“This inverse cultivation test, what is going on!?”

Jian Wushuang roared in the bottom of his head and his hoary face grew red.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t get too emotional. You must steady your mind,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice suddenly rang in Jian Wushuang’s head, “Don’t forget about Real God Wu Bei in Wu Bei’s cave!”

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

Real God Wu Bei?

Back when Jian Wushuang had asked Real God Wu Bei about the third inverse cultivation test, Real God Wu Bei had never said clearly but he did mention that his drastic change of disposition was due to his experience of his third inverse cultivation test. The other Almighties referred to him as a madman.

The third inverse cultivation test that Real God Wu Bei had experienced should be the same as the one he was in.

“Real God Wu Bei could become an inverse cultivator of Real God level and his power could be compared favorably with an Almighty’s. He naturally was an impressive figure. However, even he had a drastic change in disposition after he passed through the third inverse cultivation test while you… you are in the midst of the test, if you were to act recklessly, you might turn out like Real God Wu Bei. Plus, this is a really decent situation.”

“Don’t forget, the third inverse cultivation is your biggest test. This test is definitely much more strict than the others!” King of Venomous Worms roared.

Jian Wushuang felt his chest tighten. He kept quiet for a while and finally let out a breath of relief.

“I misbehaved,” Jian Wushuang calmed down.

“Anyone who experiences what you’re encountering would misbehave, or even go mad. It’s normal. But you have to steady your mind. Don’t get flustered. Otherwise, you might be doomed forever,” King of Venomous Worms exhorted.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. He understood it well.

“Oh yeah, King of Venomous Worms, since I became like this, what effect does it have on you as my parasitic beast?”
