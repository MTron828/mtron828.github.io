Chapter 1575: One Stroke!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Not going to leave?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and the Blood Mountain Sword behind him was unsheathed slowly.

“Why, you wish to fight? Do you think that I will be scared of you?” Zi Dongwang still did not care about Jian Wushuang.

“Since you are unwilling to leave, you can stay here forever.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice turned indifferent the instant when his words left his mouth.

Whoosh!

Eighteen shadows appeared at the same time.

Every shadow of the eighteen shadows was as fast as a ghost and they flew in front of Zi Dongwang quickly.

The eighteen shadows swung the long swords in their hands.

It was obvious that it was only a normal stroke and Unique Skills that were shocking were not used. However, this stroke… was too fast.

The smile on Zi Dongwang’s face disappeared completely and he stared at the icy-cold sword light which appeared in front of him persistently. In his eyes, the sword light was becoming bigger and bigger. He then did his best to make a move to block the attack. At the very least, he needed his palm to be before the sword light to block it.

However, in actual fact, he was too slow. When he had just raised his palm, the sword light had already swept past his neck.

Swoosh!

A big head was sent flying.

Zi Dongwang opened his eyes big. His consciousness did not dissipate completely right away. However, he could only look on as his head was separated from his body as he could not do anything.

“How is this possible?”

“Why did this happen?”

Zi Dongwang’s mouth was still muttering something. After that, his eyes started to fade out completely.

Jian Wushuang then unleashed an impact and reduced Zi Dongwang’s body which had lost any form of life to fine powder. After that, his eyes looked toward the Void Real God who was carrying a big axe.

Swoosh!

The Void Real God, who was carrying a big axe, was so frightened that he retreated quickly and immediately.

Jian Wushuang looked at the Void Real God coldly and shouted: “If you still dare to follow me, you will end up like Zi Dongwang.”

“I dare not, I dare not,” the Void Real God shook his head repeatedly.

This was no joke. Although Zi Dongwang was only a Universe God, he was strong enough to be in the top four of the Universe God ranking list. His abilities were also stronger than that of a normal Void Real God and he was very close to a Peak Void Real God. As such, he was not weaker than a Void Real God. However, he was still killed by Jian Wushuang.

Hence, why would he dare to follow Jian Wushuang?

“Hmph.”

Jian Wushuang gave a cold hum. In no time, his body disappeared from the line of vision of the Void Real God.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang had left, the Void Real God, who was carrying a big axe, heaved a sigh of relief. When he raised his head again, his eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Amazing!”

“This is Zi Dongwang, a peak expert who is ranked third in the Universe God ranking list. And that Jian Wushuang is merely a Universe God. However, in the end…”

After taking a deep breath, the Void Real God spread the news hastily.

“Zi Dongwang who ranked third in the Universe God ranking list has been killed by Jian Wushuang in the Burning Demon Region. Moreover… he was killed with one stroke instantly!”

As soon as such simple news got out, in less than an hour, it caused an uproar in the Burning Demon Region, Four Symbol Land and the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

At a pavilion in the middle of a lake, amidst continuous mountains within the East Royal Sanctuary of the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

A thin, weak young man who looked ill with a pale expression stood up vigorously.

“Zi Dongwang was actually killed by Jian Wushuang with one stroke?”

“Just one stroke?”

“How is this possible?”

From the moment the God Destroying King, who was ranked first on the Universe God ranking list got his first position, this was the first time that he had revealed a shocked expression.

It must be known that even if it were him and he unleashed all his abilities instantly, he had no guarantee that he could kill Zi Dongwang with one stroke of his spear.

However, Jian Wushuang managed to do it.

Moreover, according to the Real God who witnessed that scene, Jian Wushuang was very relaxed when he killed Zi Dongwang and it looked as if he did not use his full power as well.

“Jian Wushuang. Back then, he lost all his abilities abruptly due to unknown reasons and became a disabled person. Moreover, it is said that he even went to the mystery land that ordinary people lived in. When I heard this news, I felt that it was a pity for this top genius. However, looking at it now… This Jian Wushuang definitely lost his abilities temporarily due to him practicing some sort of special secret skill. Now, his secret skills are complete and not only did his abilities recover, his abilities also rose terrifically!”

“Killing Zi Dongwang with one stroke. His current abilities might have surpassed even mine!”

At the very moment, the God Destroying King could only say that Jian Wushuang might have surpassed him.

After all, he did not fight with Jian Wushuang for real. It might just be the Void Real God who saw Jian Wushuang fighting making an overstatement.

No matter what, he was clear that the exceptional genius with abilities that had overpowered him before during the fight in Wu Bei’s cave and also caused him to be extremely shocked had returned for real!

…

At the Lineage of Star, inside the cave that Hall Master Yuan was in.

“Haha~~~”

The Hall Master Yuan of the very moment was laughing heartily and his laughter reverberated through the whole cave.

“This Jian Wushuang has only just entered the Burning Demon Region. Even before coming into contact with Duan Lingfeng, he has already caused such a huge commotion.”

“Killing Zi Dongwang with one stroke, hehe… Moreover, he has definitely not unleashed his full power yet.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Hall Master Yuan understood that since Jian Wushuang had cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven, his abilities had definitely risen greatly compared to the past. Hence, he could confirm that Jian Wushuang’s current abilities were no doubt greater than the God Destroying King’s, who ranked first in the Universe God ranking list. As for how much stronger Jian Wushuang had gotten, he was unable to tell.

However, killing Zi Dongwang with one stroke was definitely not Jian Wushuang’s full fighting capabilities.

“Hmph, for the past few years, quite a number of deacons in the Lineage of Star always thought that I favored Jian Wushuang and that I was too kind toward him. Little did they imagine that Jian Wushuang would be the top genius of the Lineage of Star and that it would be worth all our effort and resources to nurture him.”

“For the past few years, they even looked for me one by one to discuss this matter. Now, I really wish to see what else they will say.”

After laughing apathetically, Hall Master Yuan informed the deacons in the Lineage of Star of this matter immediately.

In no time, the Lineage of Star was in an uproar.

Within the Burning Demon Region, Jian Wushuang was still alone by himself and he was hurrying in the direction of the place that Duan Lingfeng was. During his journey, his expression became unusually cold.

“Since back then in Wu Bei’s cave, I already couldn’t tolerate that Zi Dongwang. However, it’s a pity that my abilities were not high enough at that time and I could only defeat him at best, as killing him would have been too difficult. However, the present is different from the past. As of now, if I’m not wrong, I could even kill the God Destroying King. Hence, even though he is merely Zi Dongwang, he still dares to be arrogant in front of me. He is really courting death!”

Jian Wushuang was full of murderous intent.

In Wu Bei’s cave, both of them were fighting for the White Blaze Fruit. Therefore, even though Zi Dongwang had found trouble for him by trying to kill him, he would not bear any grudge or take revenge against him intentionally.

However, at present, Zi Dongwang acted recklessly and came looking for him with trouble. This was indeed being very foolish.
