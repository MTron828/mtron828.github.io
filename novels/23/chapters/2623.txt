Chapter 2624: The Strongest Battle Power!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It was the Transmigration World first, then Space-time World, and now it has shifted into the Sword Principle World?” Yuan Lei did not like that a single bit.

Beams of vigorous sword essence filled every corner of that world upon the Sword Principle World’s formation.

Jian Wushuang had been using his 50,000 kilometers Perfect Sword World to violently suppress and stun Yuan Lei which caused his Principle World to barely hang in there. Jian Wushuang’s Sword World energy suddenly surged ferociously once again upon the shift into Sword Principle World and crushed Yuan Lei’s Principle World in just a short moment.

An incredibly powerful stunning strength took effect on Yuan Lei’s body.

“Damn!” Yuan Lei could not help but curse.

Jian Wushuang attacked once again at that moment.

The Blood Mountain Sword lashed out silently—the Heaven, Earth, and Space-time seemed as though they were overlapping.

A mysterious sword shadow flashed by and disappeared under such overlappings!

Space-time Sword Technique’s sixth form—Overlapping Shadow!

With the support of the surrounding Sword Principle World, Jian Wushuang’s strike was especially terrifying.

Yuan Lei was completely under the Sword World’s stunning effects as his face turned red from seeing the sword being pointed at him and the three kilometers tall green titan immediately stood before him.

Slash!

The cold sharp sword blade sliced through the green titan and cut it into two halves before the sword shadow’s impressive momentum continued to sweep toward Yuan Lei’s divine body.

Although Yuan Lei’s divine body was equipped with protective techniques, his body was still shaken violently under the sword shadow attacks and threw up a big gulp of blood in the next moment.

He was injured!

A respectable Heaven Ultimate God expert like Yuan Lei was severely injured!

“Boy, you’ve totally pissed me off!!

“I want to strip off your skin and take your bones apart to vent my hatred today!!”

Yuan Lei’s eyes turned red as he released a deep growl filled with infinite killing intent like a demon from hell.

Jian Wushuang sneered upon seeing that. “What coincidence! I’m also losing interest in playing games with you. Let’s have a duel of fates.”

Jian Wushuang’s body surface burst with golden light as soon as he finished his words. The golden light which came from his golden robe was the Golden Glass Armor. A layer of golden armor appeared on the surface of his body in only a swift moment.

One of the top five Seven Stars Black Sect’s Secret Technique, Nine Sparkle Star Armor was unleashed.

His current achievement of the Nine Sparkle Star Armor from the Golden Armor chapter was enough to increase Jian Wushuang’s overall ability threefold!!

“Freeze!”

Jian Wushuang quietly commanded and the nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords once again overlapped each other in the void next to him before forming the first stage of Transmigration Sword Formation.

At the same time, a wave of golden divine power swept out from Jian Wushuang’s body and formed a grand golden divine power ocean that swept across every direction in a frenzy—covering the surrounding Heaven and Earth. A gigantic golden prison appeared in the Sword Principle World in the blink of an eye.

The Golden Prison’s appearance perfectly overlapped with the Sword Principle World as its realm suppression effects began to sweep outward.

The nine kilometers tall Golden God Shadow behind Jian Wushuang also had its aura rise to its peak.

Its eyes were shining with a thick essence of light while standing still.

“Seven Stars Secret Technique, Divine God of Punishment, and Nine Sparkle Star Armor—I’ve unleashed all three of Seven Stars Sect’s strongest secret techniques!

“I’ve also used the Stately Painting’s Thousand Treasures Grand World, and Prison of Punishment!

“Presently, I’ve shown all my cards except for the life rating suppression. This is the highest state I can reach for the moment and also my most powerful form!

“I feel that the current me is even qualified to destroy a regular Heaven Ultimate God!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists as his burning battle intent surged.

“Hmph!”

Yuan Lei humped coldly as his body that had already grown to five meters tall grew dramatically again and became ten meters tall. At the same time, various secret markings which looked like tree branches surfaced on his body and gradually crawled all over his body—making him look ever so ferocious and terrifying.

A gigantic tree grew upward behind him.

That gigantic tree was also three kilometers tall—incomparably sturdy and full of life. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A layer of green armor also appeared on the green titan’s body in front of Yuan Lei along with its sudden violently surging energy!

“Charge!!”

Yuan Lei shouted a command and the green titan charged at Jian Wushuang fiercely with a jump that covered a long distance in a short moment.

“Go.”

The black divine sword manifested from Transmigration Sword Formation vibrated upon being pointed by Jian Wushuang. Its energy suddenly increased threefold before charging outward in the blink of an eye under the Nine Sparkle Star Armor’s influence. Jian Wushuang’s deadly eyes stared ahead at Yuan Lei who was at a far distance.

The nine kilometers tall Golden God Shadow suddenly burst with glorious golden light behind him.

The gigantic Golden God Shadow’s arms swung outwards upon Jian Wushuang’s mental manipulation.

The two golden palms suddenly expanded infinitely to the extent of covering the sky and the sun—such that half of Heaven and Earth could be covered with only one hand. The entire surrounding void was then covered by both hands.

Both palms began to fold together toward Yuan Lei.

“Punishment, Divine Destruction!!!”

Jian Wushuang commanded vigorously.

The terrifying divine power burst out of the Golden God Shadow’s giant palms. Yuan Lei was completely imprisoned within the void as the two palms slowly folded together.

Divine Destruction—like Prison of Punishment was one of the techniques built within the Divine God of Punishment secret technique.

In his past life, Jian Wushuang had seen Emperor Bai using that move before.

In his current life, he could finally use it after making a breakthrough to Peak Ultimate God along with a few years of studying.

Even though they were the same moves, it was a few times more powerful than Emperor Bai’s when Jian Wushuang performed it!!

Yuan Lei began to panic upon seeing both golden palms closing in on him from both sides.

He could feel the extremely destructive energy contained in the two palms and dared not be careless.

Broom boom boom~~~

Infinite green divine power suddenly burst out from his body and caused the gigantic tree behind him to begin spreading out. The countless branches started to take shape and extend before finally clashing head-on with the two golden palms.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh!!!

The divine power clashing noises resonated the heaven and earth.

However, the head-on clash only lasted for a short moment before the two gigantic golden palms began folding together again.

“What?”

Yuan Lei was completely shocked and had not expected that he still could not fend off that particular attack after unleashing his most powerful ability.

The two golden palms were still closing in and continued to suppress him while the branches which burst out from his body were also gradually losing the fight.
