——

It had been a while since Jian Wushuang killed the Tranquil Cloud King. 13 axes could naturally react. Since four people had been killed by Jian Wushuang, the remaining leaders of 13 axes…naturally, they would not stay in their own nest and wait for him to kill them.

Moreover, if Jian Wushuang had not mastered teleportation and easily rushed to the mountains, he would not have been able to kill the four leaders.

“I never thought of killing them one by one. Now, I have killed four of them and only nine of them are left. That’s good enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled and was very satisfied with his results.

However, his task was to kill all 13 axes. He hadn’t finished half of the task yet.

“The leaders of this mountain have escaped from their nest, and the leaders of the other mountains are probably the same. If I’m not mistaken, these leaders should be rushing to Green Flame Mountain as soon as possible, which is the nest of the 13 axes’ boss, blood eagle, to discuss countermeasures. I’m afraid they won’t go out alone until they kill me!”

“If I want to kill the remaining nine leaders of the 13 axes, I have no choice but to kill them and face them head-on.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

…

Green Flame Mountain, nine-wolf mountain range!

The lair of the no. 1 leader of the 13 axes, Blood Eagle, was here.

At this moment, in the hall in the center of Green Flame Mountain, the leader, Blood Eagle, the second brother, Violent Bear, and the other seven leaders who were still alive were gathered here.

Everyone’s expressions were extremely ugly, and the atmosphere in the main hall was extremely gloomy.

After a long while, Blood Eagle was the first to speak, “Sixth brother, eighth brother, eleventh brother, and the thirteenth brother are all dead, and they were all killed by the same person. That person should be proficient in the laws of space and time and have already grasped teleportation. He can use it to rush to the top of the mountain where sixth brother and the rest are!”

“And his strength is also extremely terrifying. Elder Six, Elder Eight, Elder Eleven, and Elder Thirteen have all reached the peak of rank seven, especially Elder Thirteen. His strength is enough to rank in the top five among our thirteen brothers, but he was easily killed by him!”

Hearing Blood Eagle’s words, the leaders present were all silent, and a few of them even had looks of relief on their faces.

They were indeed glad. They were glad that that person had attacked sixth, eighth, eleventh, and thirteenth first and not them. Otherwise, with that person’s strength, once he was targeted, they would definitely die.

“This is a mirror image transmitted by eighth’s subordinates. There is a scene of that person fighting with eighth. Take a careful look.” Blood Eagle waved his hand, and immediately, a huge mirror image appeared in the middle of the hall.

In the mirror image, Elder Eight’s Tranquil Cloud King was fighting with a young man.

“Hmm, a rank six True Saint?”

These leaders immediately discovered a problem. The person fighting with Tranquil Cloud King was only a rank six True Saint.

But soon after, this rank six True Saint displayed an incomparably terrifying strength.

“So powerful!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“He defeated Elder Eight’s strongest move in a head-on fight and even sent Elder Eight flying?”

“He attacked again. How could he be so fast? Elder Eighth’s body is flying backward, so he definitely can’t block this attack.”

“Sure enough, Elder Eighth’s divine body collapsed and he died immediately. He didn’t even undergo second recombination?”

“It’s venom, and it’s extremely terrifying venom. It can instantly kill a True Saint at the peak of rank seven!”

Seeing the scene of Jian Wushuang fighting with Tranquil Cloud King, the leaders present were all shocked.

What shocked them was the strength Jian Wushuang had displayed.

He had killed Tranquil Cloud King, who was at the peak of rank seven True Saint Realm, with only two strikes. His strength was too terrifying.

“Big brother, although this man is only at the rank six True Saint Realm, his strength is more powerful than an ordinary peak of rank seven True Saint. Moreover, his swordsmanship…is indeed terrifying. If you fight him head-on, are you sure you can defeat him?” Violent Bear who was the second brother, whose entire body was filled with a violent aura, looked toward Blood Eagle.

“I don’t know.” Blood Eagle shook his head. “Just from the power he displayed in this mirror image, I am certain that I can defeat him. However, I am afraid that when he killed our eighth brother, he did not use his full strength. Therefore, I am not very confident.”

Violent Bear frowned, then, he said in a low voice, “Where did this person…called Han come from? He is clearly only a rank six True Saint, but his combat power is so strong. could he be a top genius from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces or the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect?”

“But our thirteen axes did not take the initiative to provoke the Heavenly-cleaving Alliance or the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect, right?”

“A rank six True Saint can easily kill a peak rank seven True Saint. Such a terrifying ability to leap ranks is not something an ordinary genius or monster can do. Moreover, this person has comprehended the principles of space and time, and he uses sword techniques. This reminds me of someone.” A leader beside him said.

“Who?” Blood Eagle, Violent Bear, and the other leaders all looked over.

“Three hundred years ago, that First Heaven Heavenly Sword Marquis, who caused a commotion throughout the entire Divine Begining Realm,” said the leader.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Everyone was startled, but then came to a realization.

“Yes, it’s him.” Blood Eagle also nodded. “That Heavenly Sword Marquis killed a rank seven True Saint as a rank four True Saint. His ability to jump levels is also extremely terrifying. Furthermore, the Heavenly Sword Marquis also comprehended the space-time principles and used swords as weapons. In fact, their swordsmanship is very similar. In the same era, it’s impossible for two people to be so similar in all aspects, and both of them are so unbelievably monstrous. Therefore, this Han must be the Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“Didn’t the Heavenly Sword Marquis fight with the Purple Cloud Pavilion? I heard that he was very powerful. Why did he come to my Nine Wolf Mountain Range and attack my 13 axes?!”

Blood Eagle’s face was extremely gloomy. The leaders beside him also had killing intent on their faces.

The 13 axes were a team.

The 13 leaders of the 13 axes were sworn brothers. The 13 of them had occupied the Nine Wolf Mountain Range for hundreds of thousands of years and had a good relationship with each other. Now that four of them had died, the remaining people were naturally furious and naturally wanted to take revenge.

“Big brother, sixth, eighth, eleventh and thirteenth can not die in vain.” Violent Bear cried out in a low voice.

“I know.” Blood Eagle nodded heavily. His eyes flickered with a strange light. “However, from the mirror image, this Heavenly Sword Marquis is extremely powerful. It won’t be easy to kill him and avenge sixth brother and the others!”
