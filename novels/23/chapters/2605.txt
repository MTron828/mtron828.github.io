Chapter 2606: Space-time Fluctuation

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Long time ago, a chamber left behind by an Undying Saint was discovered in a holy domain. The chamber contained large amounts of treasures left behind by the Undying Saint and caused a wave of battle with many experts dying over the fight for those treasures.

“There were experts from Star Picking Pavilion who participated in the battle and obtained quite a harvest, bringing back many treasures. This golden rock is one of the treasures we obtained from that chamber!!”

The Golden Chief paused a little and scanned the crowd. “Just imagine, if it’s not a rare treasure, why will it appear in an Undying Saint’s chamber and why will he keep it with him the whole time? Besides, we had experts who tried destroying the golden rock, but there was no way to do so as it’s tough. That further proved it’s truly a treasure that only nobody could identify and discover its value yet.”

The experts were nodding upon hearing the Golden Chief’s words.

Truly, anything appearing in an Undying Saint’s chamber should not be ordinary.

Furthermore, it was only logical that it was not a normal rock since the golden rock was so tough.

“Sir, your words do make sense. Perhaps the golden rock is really a valuable item. However, we don’t know its usage so even if one of us obtained it, it won’t be useful after all.” A voice had spoken from an individual room on the second floor.

The Golden Chief immediately laughed. “That’s truly the case, hence I have no confidence whether this item would be purchased. However, I will temporarily retract the restrictive shield around the display stage when the bidding starts, so that all of you can channel your soul power and investigate this golden rock. There are many experts here. Perhaps one of you could identify the golden rock. Besides, this golden rock’s starting price isn’t that high. It’s only five million Primordial Stones!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

As soon as the Golden Chief finished his speech, he retracted the restrictive shield around him.

Beams of soul power immediately began to push toward the golden rock.

The experts in the auction including those in the individual rooms of the second and third floors paid their full attention to the golden rock.

Jian Wushuang was also channeling his soul power toward it.

A long while later, everyone began retracting their soul power.

However, the experts in the auction felt perplexed after their investigation.

None of them could find out anything about the golden rock and everyone could only conclude that it was only an ordinary rock.

Even the experts in the individual rooms of the second and third floors had the same opinion.

“This golden rock seems to be quite ordinary.”

In the Dongfang Clan’s room, the beautiful lady’s expression was cold. She looked down and said, “I’m afraid Star Picking Pavilion has obtained this golden rock for ages, but they could not find out anything about it, so they took it out for auction. If they can’t tell what it is, this golden rock won’t be of any use to me.”

The beautiful lady had no intention whatsoever to bid for it.

Although the Dongfang Clan was extremely wealthy, they would only spend their energy on things that were useful to them. Therefore, that golden rock was useless to them.

“It’s just a rock that came from an Undying Saint’s chamber, and yet the starting price is five million Primordial Stones. Star Picking Pavilion truly has a big appetite,” scoffed the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace. He could not even be bothered to even look at the golden rock.

Moreover, there were only a few items that had caught his attention for more than two seconds ever since the auction began. Even those were not sufficient to motivate him in placing a bid.

Not only the two of them but almost every expert in the auction house also did not show any interest in the golden rock.

Due to that, nobody made a bid for a long time after the auction of the golden rock started.

Silence filled the auction.

After a long moment, a voice had spoken, “I’ll pay the five million Primordial Stones since nobody is interested. I will investigate it in detail when I bring it home. Perhaps I’ll find out the secrets within.”

Everybody followed the source of the voice and looked up at an individual room on the second floor.

“The person in that room must be the one who bought the Transmigration Sword Formation?”

“I wonder who’s in that room. He spent forty million Primordial Stones on the Transmigration Sword Formation’s first four stages and now he’s buying this unidentified rock with five million Primordial Stones.”

“Five million Primordial Stones is no small number after all. He may have found out something about it since he’s willing to pay so much for this golden rock.”

Many cultivators on the first floor began to discuss among themselves.

In his room, Jian Wushuang spoke with a casual emotionless voice. However, his eyes were staring at the golden rock on the display stage sharply at that moment.

Jian Wushuang had extended his soul power as well when the Golden Chief took down the restrictive shield a moment ago and allowed everyone to penetrate the golden rock with their soul power.

After his soul power shrouded the golden rock, he could sense an extremely hidden Space-time fluctuation.

The little bit of Space-time fluctuation was so hidden that ordinary cultivators—even Heavenly Ultimate Gods, Grand Ultimate Gods, and Undying Saints—could not easily discover it. The reason Jian Wushuang could discover it was not only because he had a very deep understanding of Space-time Law.

The most crucial reason was that he had a great affinity with Space-time Energy!

In other words, he had an extraordinary talent in understanding Space-time Law!

He was a super genius in understanding Space-time Law—a super demon!

It was due to that, he could barely feel the slight Space-time fluctuation and was willing to spend five million Primordial Stones to purchase the golden rock.

‘This golden rock is probably a treasure that has something to do with Space-time Law or maybe contains something that involves Space-time Law. Although I can’t figure out its antecedents and what it contains, it only costs five million. It’s a good gamble to bring it home and properly study it. I’m in luck if it ended up containing some big opportunity that involves Space-time!

‘Even if there aren’t any big opportunities and is only an ordinary treasure that has something to do with Space-time, my loss is still minimal,’ though Jian Wushuang to himself.

The golden rock was too unique with nobody knowing about its origin. Even though Jian Wushuang could barely sense some Space-time fluctuation, spending five million Primordial Stones was still a huge risk for him. As for the others, they could not even sense the little bit of Space-time fluctuation. Naturally, they would not compete with him over it.

Without a doubt, no one was willing to make a bid except for Jian Wushuang. In the end, the golden rock was sold for five million Primordial Stones and became Jian Wushuang’s possession.
