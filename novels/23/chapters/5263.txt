Chapter 5262 - 5262: Going and Staying

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Since entering the Original Universe, they had sworn brotherhood.

In the first phase of the chaotic battle, none of them fell. But now, in the second phase of the trial, three had already perished.

After the ninth wave, it was uncertain how many would survive.

“Fourth Brother, listen to our eldest brother!” The sixth-ranked woman’s eyes were gentle, like water.

Fourth Brother felt somewhat unwilling but didn’t know how to argue.

In the end, he took the treasure from his Sixth Sister’s hands, bowing his head in silence.

They had once sworn that once they retired, all their treasures would be left to the people on the city wall.

Now, the five remaining individuals all possessed peak-level fighting power, with the sixth sibling being the weakest.

According to the rules, she had to retire and voluntarily contribute her treasures.

This scene played out in many squads.

“Hurry, those who are not prepared to retire and continue fighting, gather here quickly!” A half-step Dao Lord with a general’s position stood on the city wall, shouting angrily.

The ten generals, each responsible for a section, began counting the numbers, preparing for the arrival of the ninth wave. Jian Wushuang looked at all of this.

This was the tragedy of the weak!

His strength was formidable. In the early stages, people resented him for snatching the treasure points, but now, they were grateful that he could hold back the Devouring Demon, giving them a chance to breathe.

He was used to all of this. Since the seventh wave, the people on the city wall had been orderly, as if positions really mattered.

Except for Jian Wushuang, the commander.

Si Tian became the backbone on the city wall, and the other four commanders all followed his lead.

“Reporting to Dao Lord, the ten generals have been counted,” a Grand Yan Immortal at the extreme level respectfully reported.

God-Emperor MO Long was also among them. The section of the city wall under his jurisdiction had 3,000 top-level Grand Yan Immortals, more than

200 peak-level Grand Yan Immortals, and seven or eight extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals. Their strengths were almost on par with his, but they were all newly emerged strong warriors.

The number of soldiers from the other generals’ camps was similar. Si Tian

quickly grasped the remaining Grand Yan Immortals and ascended into the sky, initiating the pre-battle mobilization.

The high morale lifted everyone’s spirits.

Even Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but look up at Si Tian in the sky.

“Everyone, in this ninth wave, I understand that for many, this might be the last opportunity. I also comprehend your difficulties. But since you’ve chosen to stay, you must follow orders.”

“It’s not too late to retire now; don’t blame me for not warning you! When the Devouring Demon breaks through, all of you must hold the line. If anyone shows cowardice, I guarantee I will personally throw them into the midst of the devouring army, treating them as fodder!” Dao Lord Si Tian’s voice echoed in the sky.

Many wavering souls suddenly became resolute.

They had witnessed Si Tian throwing several trembling Grand Yan Immortals into the devouring army; in an instant, they turned into blood mist, leaving no trace of their origin source, as if they had never existed, dead beyond death.

This was why they dared to fight. Not fighting meant death, but fighting to the death could earn them treasure points.

The mobilization quickly concluded, leaving these individuals some time to rest before the ninth wave arrived, lasting about the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.

Si Tian descended from the sky. This time, he took the initiative to approach Jian Wushuang, adopting a deferential posture.

“Leader Si Tian greets Commander!” Si Tian crossed his left arm over his chest, giving a slight bow.

Jian Wushuang hadn’t anticipated this move; his eyes scanned Si Tian, sensing his ulterior motives.

“Si Tian, you’ve gone too far; there’s no need for such formality. Later, I will do my utmost to block those Devouring Demons.”

Since cultivating the Transcendent Immortal Formation, he hadn’t used it. This ninth wave presented an opportunity; he intended to use the entire battlefield as the core of the array, testing his skills against these Devouring Demons.

Although it might have seemed like using a sledgehammer to kill a chicken, he knew there wouldn’t be any more treasure points after this. He had to seize this opportunity. Following the information he had obtained from Qiuhuang City, he knew that after the ninth wave, they would receive treasures each time they defended a position. The treasure points system was likely to be discontinued.

He had to make the most of it.

With a serious expression, Si Tian bowed again, regardless of whatever Jian

Wushuang was saying. He spoke respectfully, “Si Tian represents 34,760

Fellow Daoists. Thank you, Brother Wushuang!’

His voice was not loud, but it was clear enough for everyone to hear.

Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows slightly. He sensed that this person had no good intentions, so why was he suddenly flattering him?

He had initially thought Si Tian might try to scheme against him using these people. He hadn’t expected this – Si Tian was trying to butter him up.

If he couldn’t handle it, he would be the one in trouble.

He couldn’t be too self-assured.

A thought crossed Jian Wushuangs mind. He lowered his voice and said, “Brother Si Tian, regardless of your intentions, I will eventually obtain what belongs to me. Even if it ends up at the ends of the earth, I am determined to obtain that item. If I get it now, I can offer half of my treasure points in exchange. If it’s delayed, there might not be another chance.”

Si Tian laughed dryly, pretending not to understand.

But he understood Jian Wushuangs intent very well. This was a threat.

He tried to ask, “I wonder if it’s half of your current points or half of your future points! ”

Half of Jian Wushuangs treasure points did pique his interest.

Jian Wushuang currently had just over a million treasure points, according to Si Tian’s estimation. He knew Jian Wushuang had spent 800,000 points to exchange for the Candle Dragon Wings. If he hadn’t exchanged for other treasures, he should still have around a million points.

Half of that didn’t make him particularly excited. He had the ability to earn over a million points by himself in the ninth wave. But if Jian Wushuang was willing to exchange half of his future points after the ninth wave, Si Tian was genuinely tempted.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But it was limited to his desire for the treasure points.

Jian Wushuang saw through his thoughts and said gently, “You can treat it as a reward after the ninth wave!”

At the moment, he didn’t have many treasure points on him. Even if he took out everything, it probably wouldn’t catch a second glance in this vast expanse. However, after the ninth wave, he would have at least six to seven million treasure points, half of which would amount to at least three million treasure points.

Although there were no more imitation Eternal Treasures in his treasure trove, he could exchange them for Emperor-grade pills, or celestial materials and treasures useful for enhancing his own origin source.

There were also several top-grade Innate Treasures left, each priced around

700,000 to 800,00, almost enough to exchange for a whole set. These treasures were tempting even for tier 3 Emperors, and even tier 4 Emperors couldn’t resist their allure.

If he was worried about Emperors prying into his affairs, he could also exchange celestial materials and treasures to strengthen himself.

Enhancing his top-grade perfected innate body wouldn’t even cost him three million treasure points, and he could also use this opportunity to boost his divine body.

This was an instant means of improvement!

Dao Lord Si Tian’s eyes flickered, but in the end, he didn’t object. Instead, he left behind a serious reminder before departing, “Then I wish Brother

Wushuang success in overcoming the ninth wave and obtaining that treasure.”

Having said that, he turned and walked away.

Jian Wushuang watched his receding figure and closed his eyes again.

This person was too cunning. If there was a chance during the ninth wave, he would prefer to trap and kill this person..
