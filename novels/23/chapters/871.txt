Chapter 872: Inverse Cultivation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“So, I guess you are wondering how I can tell who you are.” The Lord Spirit Sound stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He really had no idea how could she know about it.

“To be frank, it’s very easy for me,”Lord Spirit Sound said with an easy smile, “For every warrior, there is a limitation at each realm.”

“A Divine Realm expert has a limitation on how high strength can go, as does an eternal realm expert.”

“A Divine Realm expert can only reach Step Five of the Eternal Realm, no matter how powerful he is. That is his limitation.”

“It’s impossible for an ordinary warrior to improve their battle strength as long once it reaches Step Five. Even if he obtains an extraordinary opportunity or secret skill that can enhance his strength, the strength he can exert will still remain at Step Five.”

“This is the limitation placed on warriors by the Heavenly Laws.”

“In this world, only one group of people can break free from this limitation. They are Inverse Cultivators!”

After that, Lord Spirit Sound paused for a moment, then she continued, “Inverse Cultivators defy the heavens, so the Heavenly Laws are useless against them.”

“But you, as a Divine Realm expert, should be clear about what level your battle strength has reached.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Indeed, his battle strength was much stronger than any other Divine Realm expert.

This was the main benefit in cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill.

In reference to Heaven-defying Four Steps, he had reached the second step, the Deification Realm, which meant his battle strength had no limitations.

His current strength was already higher than a Divine Realm expert should be able to possess, but he was still able to improve his strength.

“There are only a few Inverse Cultivators in this world. I went on many adventures while following my lord for so many years, but only saw two Inverse Cultivators. So, I?know a little about Inverse Cultivation. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to recognize your identity.” The Lord Spirit Sound smiled.

After hearing her words, Jian Wushuang understood.

He had been in Eternal World for quite a while now, and he had even met some Dao Masters, including Empress Leng, who was a peak Dao Master.

Empress Leng had been able to perceive that he was a Divine Realm expert, but had no idea that he was an Inverse Cultivator. Apparently, Empress Leng knew nothing about Inverse Cultivation.

But this Lord Spirit Sound in front of him could tell that he was as an Inverse Cultivator because she had seen Inverse Cultivators before when she was adventuring with her lord, the person who had created the Stellar Fog Sea.

“Lord Spirit Sound, I am indeed an Inverse Cultivator, but why can’t I enter the Black Tower for Divine Realm experts? Is there any relation?”Jian Wushuang asked.

“Absolutely.” The Lord Spirit Sound smiled and said, “Because Inverse Cultivators defy the heavens, their strength is much powerful than normal. That allows them to take rank-skipping challenges.”

“So, the experts in this world already reached a consensus that an Inverse Cultivator would be counted as being one realm higher.”

“That is to say, an Inverse Cultivator in the Divine Realm will be treated as an Eternal Realm expert.”

“So, an Inverse Cultivator in the Eternal Realm will be treated as a Dao Master!”

“You are an Inverse Cultivator in the Divine Realm, so I will regard you as an Eternal Realm expert rather than a Divine Realm expert. That means you will not be able to access the Black Tower that tests Divine Realm experts. You have to head to the Black Tower that tests Eternal Realm experts if you want to try.”

After saying this, Lord Spirit Sound paused, but then she said with interest, “In truth, you should be glad that you are only a Divine Realm expert.”

“Since you are a Divine Realm expert, you have a good chance of passing the test and getting out of here given enough time.”

“But if you had reached the Eternal Realm, you would have to take the test for Dao Masters. It is more difficult than the test for Eternal Realm experts. If that happened, I’m afraid that you would be trapped here forever like some of the others on this island.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang felt a chill.

She was right.

If what Lord Spirit Sound said was true, an Inverse Cultivator in the Eternal Realm would take the test for Dao Masters. However, the test was so difficult that he might be unable to pass it within 30 thousand years or even 3 million years. Needless to say, he planned to leave within 300 years.

“It’s quite fortunate that I did not make a breakthrough! In that case, I truly would be miserable,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Well, that’s all there is to say. It’s time to see for yourself,” The Lord Spirit Sound said and then disappeared in a flash.

Jian Wushuang stood alone in front of the black tower with his hands clenched.

“I don’t have much time, only 300 years. Within that time limit, I have to find the Dragon-pheonix fruit and figure out a way to leave this place.”

“There’s no time to delay.”

Jian Wushuang looked up at the black tower for Eternal Realm experts and walked straight towards it without hesitation.

Just as expected, Jian Wushuang smoothly entered the tower without any trouble.

There were three levels in this tower, with one test on each level.

For now, Jian Wushuang was on the first level.

As soon as he entered the first level, Jian Wushuang immediately saw a burly figure quietly standing there.

A familiar feeling arose from Jian Wushuang’s heart when he saw that figure.

“It’s him?”Jian Wushuang looked up and his expression became a little weird.

This burly figure was the human-shaped monster that he killed with Jiu Zui and the other two.

He was also the first enemy that they encountered in the Stellar Fog Sea.

“Boy, this blood demon will be your first opponent in the black tower. As long as you can beat him, you will have passed this test,” The voice of Lord Spirit Sound suddenly echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Beat him?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As Jian Wushuang stared at the burly figure, a serious expression quickly appeared on his face.

“Blood Demon?”?Jian Wushuang muttered to himself,?“It seems I guessed right. He is a Puppet Fighter that was refined using a special method, so he’s very different from ordinary Puppet Fighters.”

He had seen the Blood Demon’s strength before.

This Blood Demon possessed incredible strength, speed, defense, and saber technique. It could be said that he had no weakness from head to toe.

He was definitely a human-shaped monster.

At that time, he had teamed up with Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin in a fierce battle with the Blood Demon, but failed to defeat him. Finally, it was Jian Wushuang who killed the Blood Demon with the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

But obviously, that Blood Demon was not the only one.
