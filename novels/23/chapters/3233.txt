Chapter 3237: Had Begun

——

Two hours later.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang’s body suddenly shook, and the divine power aura on his body immediately began to change drastically.

“Rank seven True Saint, we’re here!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, a hint of surprise flashing in them.

He had thought that his breakthrough would take some effort, but in fact, his breakthrough was very smooth. He relied on his accumulated divine power to attack again and again. After only a dozen times, the barrier was broken.

After he reached the rank seven True Saint Realm, his divine power immediately began to change.

The power of his divine power rose to another level.

“It’s a pity that I don’t have enough time and I don’t have that many divine power fruits. Otherwise, I could have directly reached the peak of rank seven by relying on the divine power fruits,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

However, Jian Wushuang was very satisfied even though he was only at the seventh rank.

Before he had made the breakthrough, his divine power had been fully unleashed because of his special life level and the secret skills he had cultivated. It was comparable to that of an ordinary Invincible Saint, now that he had made the breakthrough from a rank six True Saint to a rank seven True Saint, his divine power had soared again. In terms of pure power, he was now stronger than many Invincible Saints.

Even the experts on the True Saint List were not as strong as him in terms of basic divine power.

Compared with the experts on the True Saint List, his divine power was so strong that he could only comprehend the principles. There was a gap between him and the absolute arts.

However, it was impossible for him to make up for this gap in the Blood Wave Realm.

“It’s still some time before the Blood Wave Token comes into being, and during this time… It depends on whether I’m lucky enough to completely master the blood drop one move.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light, soon, he closed his eyes again and began to comprehend.

Time continued to pass.

In the Blood Wave Realm, although the Blood Wave Token still had not come into being, all kinds of fights were going on.

Many unknown people had appeared one after another. Although they were not famous, they were exceptionally powerful. Some of them had even caused quite a big impact on the True Saint List.

In short, while everyone was waiting for the Blood Wave Token to appear, the Blood Wave Realm was in a frenzy.

Because there were too many experts that had appeared and caused too much impact on the True Saint List, the True Saint List had been changed five times.

The current ranking of the True Saint List was very different from before, especially the top ten positions.

The current top ten ranks of the True Saint List were as follows.

First on the True Saint List, the Light King! (Lone warrior.)

Second on the True Saint List, the Saint Devil Son! (Heaven-cleaving Alliance.)

Third on the True Saint List, the Nether Sky Emperor! (Lone warrior.)

Fourth on the True Saint List, Di Hao! (Temporal Temple.)

Fifth on the True Saint List, Nine Temples Saintess! (Suspected nine-tailed race.)

Sixth on the True Saint List, Divine Master Ku! (Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect.)

Seventh on the True Saint List, Silver Wolf (Life and Death Saint Realm.)

Eighth on the True Saint List, Cold Heart! (Supreme Oblivion Valley.)

Ninth on the True Saint List, Thunder God! (Destruction Saint Realm.)

Tenth on the True Saint Rank, Snow Saint! (Burning Heart Heavenly Sect.)

…

In the top ten rankings, Nether Sky Emperor, Cold Heart, and Snow Saint were all powerful warriors who suddenly appeared in the Blood Wave Realm.

Especially the Nether Sky Emperor, who was ranked third after suppressing Di Hao and the Nine Temples Saintess.

Even the top ten had such a change, and the rankings below the top ten had even greater changes.

Time passed, and in a flash, the Blood Wave Realm had been opened for a whole month.

…

In the central region of the Blood Wave Realm, three figures gathered in a desolate mountain. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

These three people came from the same sect. There was an Invincible Saint and two Peak Saints. This lineup could be considered pretty good in the Blood Wave Realm.

“Senior Brother Zi, have you heard? Lei Ao of the Starless Palace was defeated by someone. Moreover, he was easily defeated.” A slightly plump middle-aged man said.

“Of course, I know about this.”

The purple-haired, purple-eyed young man sneered, “I’ve dealt with Lei Ao before. He’s indeed very strong. I’m not his match in a one-on-one fight. Because of this, every time we meet, he always acts superior to me, which makes me very unhappy. However, in the Blood Wave Realm, there are as many experts as the clouds, and there are countless Invincible Saints. There are also many people who are stronger than Lei Ao. If he dares to be so arrogant again, I’m afraid he won’t even know how he died.”

The purple-haired, purple-eyed young man’s words clearly carried a hint of schadenfreude.

“That’s true, but it also fully illustrates the dangers of the Blood Wave Realm. There are too many experts here. With the three of us, we are nothing in this place. Therefore, the three of us must be extremely careful when snatching the Blood Wave Token.” The last person said.

“Of course. If there’s a chance, we’ll snatch the Blood Wave Token. But if there aren’t certain conditions, we must treat it calmly,” said the purple-haired, purple-eyed young man.

At this moment…

Boom!

The ground suddenly shook, as if something was soaring into the sky.

Then, the three of them immediately sensed a special fluctuation coming from nearby.

This fluctuation made their pupils shrink.

“This fluctuation, this is…”

“The Blood Wave Token, the birth of the Blood Wave Token!”

“Is it finally about to begin? And the place where the first Blood Wave Token was born happens to be near us?” The purple-haired, purple-eyed young man’s eyes flashed with a demonic purple light.

“We’re in a relatively remote area in the central area. I’ve observed before that there are only a dozen or so people around us, and most of them are alone, and they’re all Peak Saints. There’s not a single Invincible Saint. With the strength of the three of us working together, we have at least a fifty percent chance of getting it!”

When they thought of this, their eyes immediately turned scarlet.

“Quick, hurry over!”

“No matter what, we must take this Blood Wave Token!”

“Anyone who dares to stop us will be killed without mercy!”

…

Just a month after the Blood Wave Realm opened, the first Blood Wave Token finally appeared.

After the birth of this Blood Wave Token, it immediately attracted many experts from nearby to rush over to fight over it. Following that, a large-scale chaotic battle began.

This battle lasted for an hour before the Blood Wave Token was obtained by Divine Master Ku, who was ranked sixth on the True Saint List.

The battle for the first Blood Wave Token ended.

However, everyone knew that with the birth of the first Blood Wave Token, the cruel slaughter within the Blood Wave Realm began!
