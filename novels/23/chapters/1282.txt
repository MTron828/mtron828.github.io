Chapter 1283: A Great Favor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang really did not know why Lord of Scarlet Island asked him to fight Universe God Chen again.

But he knew it was not because that he was curious about his battle strength.

Lord of Scarlet Island smiled and said, “I received the news saying the reason you could kill Zhuge Qiu was that you possessed a kind of Realm Technique in addition to your own strength. That skill restrained Zhuge Qiu from giving his strength a full play.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The Blaze Quicksand Realm really played a big role as he killed Zhuge Qiu.

“Realm Techniques are rarely seen. You are just a Universe Master, but you managed to display a Realm that could put pressure on a First Heaven advanced Universe God. So I guess you must have a high-grade Realm Technique, at least at the Chaos Magic Treasure Level.”

“I asked you to fight Universe God Chen because I want to feel the power of that Realm personally.” Lord of Scarlet Island smiled, “The result… The Realm you’ve just displayed is entirely composed of Blaze Quicksands, if I am not wrong!”

“Blaze Quicksand is a horrible substance in the Eternal Chaotic World. A Realm that is formed completely by Blaze Quicksands is surely formidable. Since you are just a Universe Master, you are unable to fully exert the real power of this Realm. I cannot imagine how horrifying it would be if it were executed by an ordinary Universe God or a Second Heaven Universe God.”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang knitted his brows. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Obviously, Lord of Scarlet Island coveted his Blaze Quicksand Gourd.

As if he had seen through Jian Wushuang’s thought, Lord of Scarlet Island looked at Jian Wushuang again and smiled. “Jian Wushuang, don’t worry. Your Realm Technique is indeed precious and I am tempted by it. If you were not a member of Scarlet Island, I don’t mind killing you and snatching your treasures.”

He paused for a while and continued, “However, you are an expert at Scarlet Island. As the Lord of Scarlet Island, I’m ashamed of robbing my subordinate of his belongings.”

Jian Wushuang was speechless.

Yes, if Lord of Scarlet Island coveted his Blaze Quicksand Gourd, he would not allow Man Yi and Universe God Chen stood beside him.

“Jian Wushuang, I mentioned your Realm Technique due to a favor.” Lord of Scarlet Island added.

“A favor?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Yes, a great favor.” Lord of Scarlet Island smiled and asked, “Jian Wushuang, do you know who is the real local tyrant of Dayu Region?”

“Of course, it’s the Dayu Palace.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Yes, the Dayu Palace.” Lord of Scarlet Island nodded. “Although our Scarlet Island, the Golden-sun Sect, and the Holy Prefecture fight each other fiercely in Dayu Region and our strength is formidable, in fact, none of us dares to violate the Dayu Palace!”

“To put it bluntly, we must do whatever the Dayu Palace orders obediently!”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Although what Lord of Scarlet Island said was not pleasant to the ear, he was telling the truth.

The Dayu Palace was a force of real supremacy in Dayu Region.

“The most supreme one in the Dayu Palace is its Palace Master, who is a genuine Third Heaven Universe God. He is a real supreme expert in Dayu Region.”

Lord of Scarlet Island continued, “300 years ago, Master of Dayu Palace spread the news that he was badly in need of a high-grade Realm Treasure or Secret Skill. Knowing that, all the forces in Dayu Region were shocked and experts from all forces offered their Realm Treasures and Secret Skills in order to gain his favor. But it was a pity that none of them met his requirements.”

Jian Wushuang understood all this now.

“You mean that my Blaze Quicksand Gourd probably can meet his requirements?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked.

“Yes.” Lord of Scarlet Island nodded and said, “If he displays such a Realm personally, its power must be earth-shattering. So I assume it can meet his requirements. Furthermore, he said that he just wants to borrow it for some time and will return it when his matters are done.”

Lord of Scarlet Island cast a glance at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, now that you have killed Zhuge Qiu and a Core Disciple from the Holy Prefecture, they definitely will try every possible method to kill you. Although the Master of Golden-sun Sect are not certain that you killed Jin Feng, he will not let you go easily. That is to say, you are now in a very bad situation!”

Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

He was aware Lord of Scarlet Island was telling the truth.

Both the Holy Prefecture and the Golden-sun Sect would pose a great threat to him.

“As the Divine General of the Scarlet Island, I surely will try my best to protect you. But if the two overlords put pressure on me, I probably cannot resist that. Moreover, you cannot always hide in the headquarters of the Scarlet Island. Therefore, at this critical moment, if you can obtain the favor of Master of Dayu Palace, you will benefit immensely.”

“With his deterrent, be it the Holy Prefecture or the Golden-sun Sect, they would weigh the gains and losses carefully before striking you.”

“You can even ask Master of Dayu Palace to return your favor by solving this matter for you. If so, the Holy Prefecture and the Golden-sun Sect will never dare to attack you again!”

“Do you understand what I mean?” Lord of Scarlet Island asked.

“Yes, I do.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

Of course he did.

Great trees were good for shade, not to mention ‘a towering tree’ like Master of Dayu Palace.

If he really could gain his favor, the Holy Prefecture and the Golden-sun Sect could not threaten him any more.

“However, I must not rely solely on the protection of others concerning my enmity between the Holy Prefecture and the Golden-sun Sect. What matters the most is my strength!”?Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and made a decision.

“Jian Wushuang, are you willing to lend your Blaze Quicksand Realm to Master of Dayu Palace temporarily?” Lord of Scarlet Island inquired.

“of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

It was worthwhile to lend it to Master of Dayu Palace temporarily in exchange of his favor.

“In that case, I’ll take you to the Dayu Palace to meet him at once.” Lord of Scarlet Island said.

“All right.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

They immediately moved toward the Dayu Palace.
