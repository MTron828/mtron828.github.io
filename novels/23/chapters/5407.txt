Chapter 5406 ¬†Emperor Slaughter

At the next moment, he appeared behind Gong Miaoyi, raising his hand to strike a sword towards her head.

The ancient long sword slashed towards Gong Miaoyi, and as her body began to shimmer, it eventually turned into bubbles. However, the sword did not miss and instead struck Luo Chuan's neck.

Clang!

After a heavy muffled sound, Jian Wushuang realized that the opportunity was gone, and he could only retreat.

Upon realizing something was amiss, a transparent armor had already condensed on Luo Chuan's body, an Eternal Treasure that Jian Wushuang's casual sword strike couldn't break.

Meanwhile, Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang were engaged in a battle with the strong forces of the Mo Luo Kingdom.

The tier 5 Emperor there was extraordinary, at least comparable to a top-level tier 5 Emperor.

Even with the combined efforts of Bai Junwang and Gong Miaoyi, they were being pressured in the fight.

In the depths of the Swirling Sea, the water began to reverse, creating monstrous waves that disrupted the calm surface.

Feeling the threat, Luo Chuan immediately elevated his body, rushing towards the surface, attempting to break through the sea.

The princes of the Mo Luo Kingdom, though harboring their own schemes, were not afraid of death.

Luo Chuan's surge was not an attempt to escape!

Under the eerie atmosphere of the underwater, he was more concerned that Jian Wushuang and the others might escape. Therefore, he first revealed a fearful appearance, led Jian Wushuang out of the underwater, and then took action.

Surprisingly, Jian Wushuang hadn't anticipated this.

According to the plan, he, Gong Miaoyi, and Bai Junwang were prepared to start by killing Luo Chuan and then besiege the tier 5 Emperor.

Unexpectedly, Luo Chuan's vigilance was so high. After the failed sneak attack, Bai Junwang and Gong Miaoyi could only join forces to engage Kun Tai temporarily. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

"Want to escape?"

The one who spoke was the Fourth Prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom, a big shot.

But now was not the time to fish. Bai Junwang and Gong Miaoyi couldn't hold out for too long.

Plus, there were a hundred tier 3 Emperors, including dozens of tier 4 Emperors.

Jian Wushuang's wings flapped behind him, vibrating through the layers of space, and in an instant, he arrived in the midst of these people.

"Eye of the Candle Dragon!"

Wrapped in wings, his body flipped in reverse, tearing through countless Emperors in an instant.

The Eye of the Candle Dragon swept across, turning these people directly into stone.

When dealing with tier 3 Emperors, Jian Wushuang slaughtered them effortlessly. Even tier 4Emperors couldn't withstand his attacks for long.

Puff!

His wings spread open, and the stability of the Beast God's Domain was not perfect. The continuous attacks caused his divine body to drop to around 20,000-fold.

Now, facing two tier 4 peak-level Emperors, he struggled a bit.

Meanwhile, Luo Chuan, seeing that Jian Wushuang wasn't pursuing him, turned back.

Among these Emperors were also some under Luo Chuan, but they couldn't be saved in time and were mostly slaughtered by Jian Wushuang.

The remaining tier 4 Emperors kept their distance.

Kun Tai, noticing this scene, erupted in anger. He dispelled Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang with a palm and rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

"You seek death!" These 100 Emperors were all his direct lineage. With so many dead at once, Kun Tai was not only concerned about accountability but also saw everyone as rebels.

Ironically, Luo Chuan seemed more like a traitor from the Mo Luo Army.

If Luo Chuan weren't a prince, Kun Tai would have killed him already.

These Emperors, once experienced generals who had fought for countless eras, were now slaughtered like this.

The Candle Dragon Wings trembled, and Jian Wushuang's figure disappeared. Kun Tai's attack missed, but he didn't give up. He gathered several streams of purple-gold thunder in his palm and unleashed them.

The sea turned purple, and the thunder's power made the water boil. The sea in the tens of thousands of miles around this area boiled from its cold state.

Fortunately, the sea monsters here were not weak, preventing mass casualties from the scalding. However, the sea monsters at the core of the Swirling Sea suffered greatly, with many falling in masses.

This had to be Jian Wushuang; otherwise, Kun Tai wouldn't give up. Standing on the side, Luo Chuan wasn't afraid of Jian Wushuang, but at this moment, he was a bit afraid of Kun Tai. He hadn't expected Kun Tai to be so enraged over a few weak Emperors.

Thunderous anger, but that was understandable!

"Isn't it ridiculous?" Kun Tai turned to look at Luo Chuan, his voice icy. "What you want, you had from birth, but what we want, we have to fight for ourselves!"

Luo Chuan couldn't quite understand, but he could sense that Kun Tai might attack him at any moment. If Jian Wushuang wasn't found soon, he might become the outlet for Kun Tai's anger.

Jian Wushuang, in the form of a black hole, might not be found even by a tier 6 Emperor. Now back inside Gong Miaoyi's body, he sought an opportunity.

Purple thunder sealed the cracks in the nine-layer space, but it couldn't stop Jian Wushuang. When he couldn't be found, Kun Tai secretly attacked Luo Chuan, and a purple thunder struck directly on Luo Chuan's forehead.

"Mistake!"

With just this this simple word, Kun Tai didn't say anything more.

This time it was all because of Luo Chuan, the jinx; otherwise, so many brothers wouldn't have died.

Having a bit of the Origin shattered by him was nothing.

However, Luo Chuan couldn't endure this humiliation, glaring at Kun Tai.

This matter wasn't over.

He noted it down, not only on Kun Tai but also on the Crown Prince, Luo Sha.

If he achieved the Heavenly Dao in the future, he would surely wipe away this shame.

"Now what?" Gong Miaoyi, using blood-red lines to protect the surroundings, asked Jian Wushuang inside her.

On the Bai Junwang's side, things were a bit frustrating. Even a tier 5 top-level Emperor was something he couldn't kill. When he used a bit more power, his divine body and physical body started to collapse.

Jian Wushuang, through the space, looked towards the outside, contemplating.

He could see it now. Killing the Fourth Prince who had arrived wouldn't be of much use; it might not even catch the attention of the Crown Prince.

"Let's leave first!" Jian Wushuang sighed. This time, it would have to end like this.

Continuing the fight would only be detrimental to him. The tier 5 Emperor was extraordinary; Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang couldn't hold him back, or else he could have fought a bit longer.

Hearing Jian Wushuang's decision to retreat, Gong Miaoyi was quite relieved; she never wanted to linger in this place anyway.

Although Bai Junwang was very unwilling, he had no choice but to leave first.

Facing the purple thunderstorm, leaving wasn't an easy task.

Jian Wushuang quietly transmitted to Bai Junwang, "You follow Gong Miaoyi and leave first. I'll hold them back. Remember to keep an eye on her!"

Swish!

Six avatars, along with the main body.

Seven Emperor-level combat powers.

Now, his avatars also possessed the power of a tier 4 Emperor, combined with a set of supreme Innate Treasures and the Power of All Things, making them comparable to top-level tier 4 Emperors.

The avatars went to distract the other Emperors, while the main body faced off against the tier 4 Emperor.

Kun Tai saw Jian Wushuang reappear and immediately unleashed his full aura, charging towards him.

"Hmph!"

Jian Wushuang's figure twisted, escaping in the opposite direction of Gong Miaoyi's retreat.

"Do you think you can escape?" Kun Tai sneered as he caught up, the radiance of the purple thunderstorm intensifying.

That was an Eternal Treasure!

A purple spear pierced through the void, causing a tidal wave of billions of overturned seas. The reason a tier 5 Emperor was significantly stronger than a tier 4 Emperor was the ability to control a complete Eternal Treasure.
