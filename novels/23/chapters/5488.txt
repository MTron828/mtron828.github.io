Chapter 5487 ¬†Dilemma

Some Emperors with extraordinary talents could achieve it, and Shang, when he was a tier 5 Emperor, elevated his mental power to the point of unity with heaven and earth.

For Jian Wushuang to advance to the cultivation realm of Dao Lord, it was even more troublesome than breaking through the black hole Realm.

Between the two, only the possibility of theoretical breakthroughs existed.

At least there was a theoretical basis.

After reaching the ninth level of the Extreme Dao, he discovered that the power of All Things had already undergone a transformation.

To dilute and integrate this transformation, he had to collect the essence of All Things to stop this change.

In theory, this was a good thing, as there would be improvement after the transformation. However, he had not yet integrated with the Dao, and premature transformation would make it impossible for him to Dao Merge.

The essence of all things was actually a kind of treasure related to the Wood Dao Origin Source, found only in the Forest of Eternal Secrets in the Four Great Secret Realms.

Moreover, it was legendary, making it quite troublesome.

The essence of all things that could transform into spiritual awareness was even more challenging to find.

In the future, he had to seek Zhen Ling; otherwise, he would be unable to integrate the Dao.

One problem was followed by another, and Jian Wushuang never expected it to be so troublesome before facing the Dao Merge.

The more extraordinary, the more difficult it became; the ancient elders did not deceive him!

To meet Zhen Ling, he had to go to Grave God Mountain, and to go there, he needed the strength of a tier 6 Emperor.

Without merging with the Dao, his strength was simply not enough to reach Grave God Mountain.

Although his divine body could rival tier 6 Emperors, but there were plenty of experts of such strength in God's Tomb. So, the results were disappointing‚Äîeach one perished violently, leaving no complete corpses behind.

Jian Wushuang found himself somewhat indifferent to cultivation, caught in a dilemma.

He needed to seek a breakthrough!

The only way to break through was to completely refine that Temporal Treasure.

A chessboard emerged from the Origin Source Sea.

Countless powerful Origin Sources were the pieces above.

In the middle, there was also a Temporal Origin Source.

Several of Jian Wushuang's avatars were among them. After breaking through the Extreme Dao, he could once again imitate the pieces transformed from Origin Sources.

Suddenly, a bold idea occurred to him‚Äîtrying to move one of the pieces.

The weakest piece on the left side of the chessboard also had the aura of the Universe Origin Source, but it was somewhat incomplete.

It was a piece mainly cultivating the Flame Origin Source.

When Jian Wushuang manipulated it, a giant fire crow flapped its wings, cooperatively attempting to soar out of the chessboard.

However, a powerful force of gravity descended, directly suppressing the fire crow.

It was impossible.

Unless he completely refined this Temporal Treasure.

Having a treasure comparable to the Qishen Temple but unable to use it, only treating it as an auxiliary treasure made Jian Wushuang feel quite frustrated.

Splash!

The chessboard sank into the sea again, and Jian Wushuang gave up.

He could only take it step by step.

First, he would enhance what he could. He had not yet broken through for his Ultimate Sword Dao. The Sword Dao emphasized killing, and maybe there would be unexpected gains after reaching the ninth level.

Ten days passed, and the three were still immersed, not letting a single moment slip by.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!!!

Before the three could stop on their own, they were directly teleported out of the treasure hall.

After their departure, Lord Yun Zhong arrived here holding a black soul lamp.

"Tsk tsk, even the lamps are dismantled and looted. These little guys are really poor!" Yun Zhong was quite speechless.

If he knew that Wanyan and Dongshen hadn't even spared Dragon God's urine, he would probably be even more surprised.

The soul lamp extinguished, and the Dark King appeared!

Only this time, the Dark King's appearance was solely to loot his treasures.

A complete treasure trove of a Universe Master!

Initially, when Jian Wushuang and his companions obtained the legacy of the Three Kings in the Western Sea, they didn't acquire many treasures. Only a small fraction of people obtained significant treasures.

Moreover, the treasures given to them were scarce, all of which were at the level of Emperor treasures, and there wasn't a single Universe Master-level treasure in sight. Energy treasures like the universe crystal, which only Universe Masters could use, were also nowhere to be found.

The Dark King's legacy, however, was intact, with the entire value of his possessions laid out.

Lord Yun Zhong's eyes sparkled as he entered the depths of the treasure hall.

As for Jian Wushuang and the others, they were no longer under his jurisdiction.

Because the third bridge was guarded by the Divine General Moyin.

...

Buzz!

An unstoppable force erupted, a burst of blood danced in the air, and three figures walked out from it.

Huff, huff, huff!!!

The three gasped for breath.

They had just traversed an ancient time and space route, fighting all the way to reach this point.

"Damn it, my Eternal Treasure was torn apart by that guy." Dongshen felt some heartache as he touched his battle armor.

It was a Eternal Treasure armor he obtained in the river of time, extremely rare and now torn apart. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

The ability to tear apart Eternal Treasures indicated the strength of their opponents.

Among the Emperors, there were very few who could do such a thing.

Not even the supreme-peak was guaranteed to achieve it.

Wanyan furrowed his brow and said, "It's good enough to be alive at this point, and you're still worried about an Eternal Treasure."

In the Four Great Secret Realms, there were quite a few Eternal Treasures. As long as they ventured outside, it wouldn't take long to acquire new ones.

Jian Wushuang's aura was very weak, but from the moment he emerged from the blood dance, his strength rapidly recovered.

He had a tough time too. If it weren't for the formidable divine body, he probably wouldn't have made it out.

Fortunately, with the breakthrough in the Extreme Dao and the support of the One Thought Universe, he managed to preserve his life. He didn't possess the combat power comparable to Dongshen and Wanyan's tier 6, though.

The two of them practiced a secret technique of great cultivation. Although it wasn't their creation, it was a cosmic-level secret technique.

Having cultivated to the great cultivation realm, their strength was comparable to a tier 6 Emperor. In the Four Great Secret Realms, they could even rival a peak-level tier 6 Emperor.

As for Dongshen, having mastered the realm of black holes, this battle directly propelled him to break through the tier 6 Emperor.

"Surviving a great calamity will surely bring great fortune!" Jian Wushuang consoled.

Emerging from the blood mist, they found themselves facing a narrow bridge‚Äîonly a three-inch-wide single plank.

This was the third bridge in this place.

A voice echoed from the end of the bridge, a voice they were familiar with‚Äîthe Demon Sound Divine General.

"I'll give you a chance to choose: One, cross the single-plank bridge, and after passing, I'll send you to the Original Realm to receive the complete inheritance of a Universe Master. Two, give up on crossing the single-plank bridge, and I'll take this person as my disciple!"

As soon as the words fell, the expressions of the three individuals changed.

Taking disciples was not against the rules set by Zhen Ling. Many Inheritors sought to become disciples in the Elder Palace, which was not restricted.

As for the inheritance of the Universe Master, it was rare even on Grave God Mountain. Even those who were considered outstanding had only a few who obtained the inheritance of the Universe Master.

They were well aware of this.

Compared to becoming a disciple of Divine General Moyin, the inheritance of the Universe Master was more enticing.

Of course, if one could have both, that would be even better.

"Oh, I forgot to remind you, under the bridge is connected to the Second Prison. If anyone falls, I will personally go to rescue them. However, whether I make it in time or not, I can't guarantee!"

With these words, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The path to the Second Prison?
