Chapter 2640: Masterstroke

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang suddenly said, “Master Scorpion King. Although I’m not particularly interested in joining the Sacred Palace, I’ll still be heading to Crimson Stone Fort in due time to meet the new Fort Master.”

“Oh?” Scorpion King was surprised.

“I wonder if you recognize this token I have here?” Jian Wushuang showed him a token.

The token was passed to him by Crimson Stone Saint’s remaining consciousness while in the Saint’s Tomb.

Crimson Stone Saint had reminded him that he could present her with the token if he ever met Yin Su’er in the future and she would then know who he was.

The Scorpion King did not notice anything special at first upon seeing the token. However, his eyes enlarged after a short moment.

“Old Fort Master! The Old Fort Master’s aura! This token is from the Old Fort Master!!” Scorpion King’s voice trembled with excitement as he stared toward Jian Wushuang.

“So you do recognize it, huh?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Jian Yi, how did the Old Fort Master’s token fall into your hand? Don’t tell me you’re his personal disciple?” Scorpion King asked a series of questions. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Personal disciple?” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I’m not, I just made a deal with him to return a favor since I’ve benefited a lot from him. A deal which I shall do all I can to help his daughter—the new Fort Master of Crimson Stone Fort, Yin Su’er—once I’m sufficiently strong.”

“Is that so?” Scorpion King was happy and surprised. “Turns out you’re the help sent by the Old Fort Master. I won’t even have to try and rope you in since that’s the case. However, your current abilities are a little too weak.”

Jian Wushuang broke out laughing. “My current abilities are indeed a bit low right now, but Lord Scorpion King—do you not recall that I only spent twenty years to make a breakthrough to Peak Earth Ultimate God from Primary-level Ultimate God? I’ll naturally go to the new Fort Master and give her my all to resolve Crimson Stone Fort’s crisis once I’m sufficiently capable.”

“It’s probably fine if it’s only twenty or a hundred years as the Fort Master could perhaps hold it together, but I’m afraid she won’t be able to hold the fort if you need a few hundred years.” Scorpion King frowned.

“You mean to say that the situation in Crimson Stone Fort is so bad it can’t even endure for a few hundred years?” Jian Wushuang was frowning as well.

Crimson Stone Saint had fallen for a few hundred thousand years at that moment as far as he knew. Although Crimson Stone Fort had been in an unusual crisis, it had persevered for so many years. How could it not survive for another few hundred years?

Was it due to a big turn of events that had befallen Danyang Holy Domain?

“The situation of Crimson Stone Fort is a lot worse than what people think. The Fort Master has been trying her hardest to hold everything together. However, we’re now on the brink of crumbling.” Scorpion King sighed. “Jian Yi, the Old Fort Master had never been wrong about people as it’s not easy to live up to his standards. He must have believed that you can be of great help to the Fort Master since he passed you the token and made a deal with you which greatly benefited you. However, you’ll need to increase your abilities as fast as possible!

“On that note, please let me know if you need anything that can help increase your abilities.”

Jian Wushuang was moved from listening to the Scorpion King’s incredible hopeful words.

Perhaps it was because Crimson Stone Saint had specially sent him, or he saw Jian Wushuang’s incredible cultivation speed. The Scorpion King had decided as long as Jian Wushuang grew fast enough, he would be of immense help to Yin Su’er and might even change the entire situation.

Therefore, Scorpion King was willing to do everything he could to help him upgrade his abilities.

Jian Wushuang who was scratching his nose did not hold back and directly said, “Master Scorpion King, you know that I’ve been increasing my cultivation level by relying on external resources and shall keep doing so moving forward. Therefore, what I need the most right now are Divine Elixir Pills to raise my level. I need as many as you can provide!”

“Divine Elixir Pills, huh?” Scorpion King pondered for a short while before immediately waving his hand and bringing out an Interspatial Ring.

“I have fifty Divine Elixir Pills here, you can have them for now. As for the rest, I shall report to the Fort Master and have her get you more as soon as I return to Crimson Stone Fort. However, Divine Elixir Pills are not Primordial Stones, so we won’t have too many in stock after all. Besides, the Fort Master isn’t the only person making decisions in Crimson Stone Fort as there are various factions...

“Even the Fort Master may not be able to provide you many Divine Elixir Pills after trying her very best.”

Jian Wushuang took Scorpion King’s Interspatial Ring and had a quick look. He nodded and gratefully said, “Thank you, Lord Scorpion King.”

“Don’t mention it, we’re under the Fort Master’s faction since you’re sent by the Old Fort Master. We’ll naturally go the greatest length to help you increase your abilities.” Scorpion King smiled and sat down on his throne. “Oh yes, Jian Yi—I saw you using a sword formation while fighting Qing Ze which seems to be very potent.”

“Yes, the sword formation was something I obtained in the Star Picking Pavilion’s auction—a Transmigration Sword Formation that Sword Lord Tong Xin left behind with merely the first four stages. I had spent forty million Primordial Stones on it,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Transmigration Sword Formation! No wonder it contains such terrifying Samsara Strength.” Scorpion King smiled as he looked at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Yi, you’re well-versed in the Sword Principle and studied Space-time Law. I’m sorry that I can’t really help you with both of these. You may not know this but I studied Transmigration Law too.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“I have quite a bit of insight on Transmigration Law and even created a masterstroke that has the same effect as your sword formation which I can show you,” said Scorpion King.

“Masterstroke?” Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

A Grand Ultimate God who was deeply skilled in Transmigration Law showing his masterstroke right before him. He was doing it to let Jian Wushuang observe it firsthand and study it. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Jian Wushuang.

“Watch closely.”

Scorpion King smiled before pointing slowly towards the void ahead of him. A huge wave of Samsara Strength swept out of his body all of a sudden.

The Samsara Strength began to vigorously fill the space as the huge palace hall was being crushed to bits. Jian Wushuang and the Scorpion King soon found themselves in the boundless void.

Nine gigantic black holes appeared in the void at that moment.

The nine black holes were formed from Samsara Strength with each of them containing immense Samsara Strength.

The nine black holes moved at high speed in the void like nine gigantic dark stars under the Scorpion King’s manipulation as each of them bombarded the void. The nine dark stars were perfectly coordinated and displayed incredibly terrifying power.
