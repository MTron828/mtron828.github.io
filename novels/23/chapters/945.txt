Chapter 946: The Decrepit Old Man

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Not only did the scarlet mist smell disgusting, but it also corroded the world at a maddening pace. Soon, it completely enveloped Xia Tao’s body.

“Poison?”

Xia Tao’s expression shifted as he sensed that the scarlet mist was corroding his body. The rate of corrosion was extremely slow because of his physical strength but the mist also blocked his sight and consciousness.

“Clang!”

A lavender Flowing Light spun madly like a rapidly rotating “awl” and struck his head with a sharp and harsh sound.

Xia Tao snorted and raised the Giant Axe in his hands. The heaven-shattering momentum rose along with his movement.

This Giant Axe was like a weapon of the gods that dominated heaven and earth. He wielded it with wrath.

“Clang!”

Following the ringing of metal colliding, the Void shattered into smithereens.

Xia Tao’s face darkened and he could not help retreating to the rear because of the strong brisance. The rapidly rotating ‘awl’ paused for a mere moment in front of him before landing on his head with an alarming speed.

“How is that possible?”

Xia Tao looked in front of him in surprise. It was Jian Wushuang, the owner of the lavender “awl”.

However, Jian Wushuang was obviously just an Eternal Realm expert!

Xia Tao was a real Rank Three Dao Master, almost the peak of Rank Three.

“How could I end up being the inferior one in this confrontation?”

“Is the power of the lavender ‘awl’ really that strong?”

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had already absorbed the strength of King Luo Zhen’s Essence Blood. Just 10 percent of it gave him the battle strength of a peak Three-star Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God.

Those in the Ancient God Clan had a huge advantage in bloodline compared to ordinary warriors.

The Three-star Ancient God was equivalent to the level of ordinary Dao Master. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The peak of Three-star corresponded to Dao Masters in the peak of Rank Three.

The Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God at the peak of Three-star was equivalent to Dao Masters in the peak of Rank Three!

Xia Tao might be close to possessing the strength of Dao Masters in the peak of Rank Three, he nevertheless did not truly possess it. Naturally, Jian Wushuang was able to suppress him.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted as the Bloodline Power surged in his body and continuous power flowed into the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. The lavender lightsaber from the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation glowed brighter and brighter, bursting out even stronger power at an even higher speed.

The lavender lightsaber struck Xia Tao again and again.

In addition, Gu King’s thousands of tentacles were charging madly at Xia Tao at an incredible speed. Even if Xia Tao could chop off some of them, Gu King’s frightening resilience meant he could make an instant recovery.

“How could this happen?”

“This is impossible!”

Xia Tao’s tone was full of shock and anger.

He came here with the intention of killing Jian Wushuang to avenge his two sons and the Immortal Army.

Yet, Jian Wushuang ended up completely suppressing him in their battle and throwing him into a state of panic.

When the Immortal Army was completely annihilated on the battlefield, many of the Dao Masters on Emperor Xiao’s side struck back immediately.

Though the emergence of the Immortal Army had cost many Dao Masters on Emperor Xiao’s side, their top-tier battle strength was still there.

Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, Lord of Cercis Island, Xue Lingtian, and Leng Rushuang were all available.

Comparatively, the top-tier battle strength of the camp of Emperor Leng and the Xia Clan was much worse. Xia Tao’s elimination meant only Emperor Leng, Xia Ming, and the severely wounded Xia Yu were left.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang and Gu King’s bellow that killed nearly a hundred Dao Masters truly frightened them. Thus, Emperor Xiao’s camp enjoyed an overwhelming superiority when they began their counterattack.

More than half of the 24 Heavenly Guards were now dead, as were many Dao Masters of the Xia Clan. During the counterattack, Xue Lingtian targeted Xia Yu, the severely wounded Great Elder of Xia Clan, and joined forces with Di Jing to kill him.

The situation was completely reversed thanks to Jian Wushuang and Gu King’s terrifying trick.

“If this goes on, my Heavenly Guards will all die here.”?Emperor Leng’s eyes turned icy cold. She then shouted, “Xia Tao, what about the decrepit old man of the Xia Clan? Why isn’t he lending a hand yet?”

“The decrepit old man of the Xia Clan?” Many of the Dao Masters in Emperor Xiao’s camp was startled.

On the battlefield shrouded with scarlet mist, Jian Wushuang’s Ninth-heaven Sword Formation continued to suppress Xia Tao until the latter could barely fight back. His face darkened after hearing that.

“The Ancestor has been practicing in isolation for a while. It’s a critical time for him. His strength will be greatly improved if he can go through it. He will be able to get more benefits when carving up the thing with National Master and Emperor Leng.”

“So, he told us not to disturb him unless it’s an emergency.”

Xia Tao hesitated momentarily before making his decision.

“The purpose of the Ancestor’s retreat is to get more benefits from National Master and Emperor Leng. If Emperor Xiao’s camp defeats National Master and Emperor Leng today, the Ancestor and the Xia Clan will get nothing.”

“Given the circumstances…”

Xia Tao gritted his teeth and a token immediately showed up in his hand. He then crushed the token.

The moment the token was crushed, a statue inside a secret chamber underneath Xia Clan’s camp billion of miles away reacted. The stones that covered the statue shattered, revealing a silver-haired elder.

The man was slim and had a pair of sword-shaped eyebrows that framed his face. With a twitch of his eyebrows, he opened his eyes and a red light glinted in his pupils. Suddenly, a dark flame appeared in front of him. The flame kept burning in the Void without ever going out.

The silver-haired elder waved his hand and the Void cracked open. That crack was connected to the token that Xia Tao had crushed on the battlefield.

The next moment, he threw himself into the crack.

“Buzz…”

The silver-haired elder showed up out of thin air on the battlefield and stood next to Xia Tao.

The moment he showed up, the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation manipulated by Jian Wushuang struck him like a thunderbolt.

The silver-haired elder narrowed his eyes.

“Humph!”

His snort seemed to contain the will of heaven and earth. Following this, the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation flew backward and the endless scarlet mist dissipated in an instant.
