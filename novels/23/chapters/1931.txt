1932 The Number One Force in Sanctuary Alliance

In the tower, there was a huge bronze statue towering.

The bronze statue was over a thousand zhang tall and he was wearing a bronze mask. He had a total of eight hands and the eight hands were holding various weapons tightly.

In front of the green bronze statue, it happened to be a figure in white robe knelt there politely.

He had been kneeling there for six hours.

Finally, there was a faint change in the bronze statue. On top of the statue, the only place the mask didn’t cover was a pair of eyes and they slowly looked down.

“I should say this before. If there isn’t anything important, don’t disturb me,” A deep, old voice reverberated in the tower.

“Demon King, there is a mysterious expert in Eternal Chaotic World. He should be like you, he’s also from ancient times. His name is Emperor Thirteen,” the person in a white robe was still kneeling politely.

“Oh? Emperor Thirteen?” He humphed, “Is there a mirror image of how he fought?”

“There is,” the white-robed person waved and immediately there was a mirror image that appeared in the tower.

In the mirror image, Emperor Thirteen attacked and defeated Abysmal Saint Master with ease. Then, there was a scene when Emperor Bai fought.

When he watched the scenes in the mirror image, the pair of eyes on the top of the bronze statue dilated in shock.

“It’s him??” An old voice asked with a tinge of shock.

“Demon King knew this person?” The person in white robe couldn’t help but ask.

“Yeah, of course, I do. Emperor Thirteen? Haha, it’s a great name. But that’s not right. It should be his name before he got famous or a name that he gave himself when he wandered outside,” the ancient voice resounded smilingly, “This person is a big figure!”

“A shocking figure!”

“There were countless experts that partook in the life-destroying war back then. There were many that possessed great skills. Among the countless experts that partook in the war, this person’s power could be in the top five!!”

“What?” The person who was kneeling down suddenly lifted her head and revealed an enchanting lady’s appearance. Then, there was shock in her beautiful eyes, “Top five? In the ancient times’ war, his power could be in the top five? If so, wouldn’t he be stronger than you?”

“Mm, of course, he was stronger than I am. During the war back then, I had to avoid him when I saw him. Otherwise, my life would be threatened. However, that was back then. I am different now. The power in this universe is restricted greatly. My power couldn’t be played and it would be the same for him. Even if I were to fight against him, I would not be afraid,” the bronze statue’s voice sounded confident.

The beautiful woman in the white robe then let out a breath of relief.

“As he is awake, the others should wake up soon. Haha, it has been so many years and it is finally here.”

“Haha… I am quite excited.”

“I wish that it could be ended completely this time!”

“Go, go and get ready.”

“Hahaha…”

The bronze statue’s hysterical laughter reverberated in the entire tower.

The beautiful woman in the white robe bowed politely and walked out of the tower.

...

In the darkness, all forces surged but Lineage of Star was at peace.

Sanctuary Alliance came forth to mediate. The war between Lineage of Star and the two alliances couldn’t continue. The rest of the time, Lineage of Star naturally needed to rebuild Star Land.

In the blink of an eye, three hundred years had passed.

In the three hundred years, Lineage of Star had not only reconquered Star Land, their power had also continued to expand. They had already covered a few lands and they had the power to influence in Purple Moon Sanctuary.

As within Sanctuary Alliance… although it had only been three hundred years, Lineage of Star had already advanced and leaped to become a major force in Sanctuary Alliance.

There was no doubt that no other force in Sanctuary Alliance could compare to the power that Lineage of Star possessed favorably.

Lineage of Star had more say in Sanctuary Alliance than before too.

Even the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance had scruples with Lineage of Star.

Firstly, they had received news that Jian Wushuang had already obtained the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill from Emperor Bai. It was only a matter of time until he would break through and become an Almighty. Then, he would be on par with them or even be above them.

Secondly, they also knew that there was a terrifying super expert backing Jian Wushuang who could compare to Emperor Bai favorably, Emperor Thirteen!

Because of these two reasons, the Great Emperors, of course, had to take it easy.

As long as Lineage of Star was not behaving wildly, they had to turn a blind eye and not bother with them.

The tide rises, the boat floats. Lineage of Star naturally changed with an upward trend as well.

In a lofty hall, the higher-ups of Lineage of Star gathered there to have a discussion.

The one leading was, of course, Jian Wushuang, followed by the three Hall Masters and deacon elders who were on Real God level.

As for guest elders, they were only guests. They wouldn’t be involved with Lineage of Star’s affairs on a normal basis.

“Palace Master, we have just received news that a disciple of Lineage of Star had a brush with a disciple of Real Martial Art Divine Church when he was wandering in Dragon Fire Land on East Royal Sanctuary. Both parties fought. At first, the disciple of Lineage of Star had the upper hand. In the end, a Real God from Real Martial Art Divine Church took action personally and injured our disciple badly,” Hall Master Yuan said calmly.

Hearing what Hall Master Yuan had said, the surrounding deacon elders looked at Hall Master Yuan with a strange look.

Fighting between disciples and suffering some losses were minor matters. Minor matters that not worth mentioning.

In a normal situation, Hall Master Yuan could command any one of the deacon elders to take care of it.

However, at the higher-ups’ meeting, Hall Master Yuan had brought up something so petty and reported to Jian Wushuang.

What was he trying to do?

Just as the deacon elders were extremely confused, Jian Wushuang on the throne suddenly slammed the table and stood up. There was soaring anger in his eyes.

“Real Martial Art Divine Church?”

“Humph, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church has already died and they are behaving so arrogantly. How dare they bully our disciples in Lineage of Star?! They have guts!”

“He Xiu!”

Jian Wushuang overlooked.

“Master.”

He Xiu, who was already a deacon elder in Lineage of Star, immediately stood up. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Although Real Martial Arts Divine Church was in East Royal Sanctuary, Dragon Fire Land isn’t their territory. They merely have a few branches there. You bring four Dao soldiers and make a trip there. Wipe out the two branches of Real Martial Arts Divine Church in Dragon Fire Land. I will let Emperor God Jiu Yin hide in the dark. If the Almighties from Real Martial Arts Divine Church dare to make an appearance, eliminate them all at once!!!”
