“In this world, although the strong are victorious and fists represent everything. When both parties are evenly matched and no one can do anything to the other, reasoning becomes very important,” Jian Wushuang was smiling coldly in his heart.

The moment the image played, the experts hidden in the nearby void gasped in surprise.

“I see, that’s what happened.”

“Hehe, because he cast greedy eyes over Jian Wushuang’s treasure, he was killed. It could only be said that he wasn’t powerful enough. He can’t blame anyone else. But Soaring Heaven King Palace intentionally sent experts to go after Jian Wushuang, which led to what happened today…”

“At first, Soaring Heaven King Palace said that it was Jian Wushuang who coveted Real God Gu Ying’s treasure and killed Real God Gu Ying. They are so shameless.”

“Not only are they shameless, they are barbaric. Regardless of the reason, as long as one kills people from Soaring Heaven King Palace, they must die. Humph. Soaring Heaven King Palace is full of themselves. They considered various forces beneath them.”

The experts sighed emotionally.

Although no one would get involved, the experts had already taken Jian Wushuang’s side from the bottom of their hearts.

The incident had obviously happened because Soaring Heaven King Palace was too arrogant and shameless.

Since the beginning, Jian Wushuang had only been counterattacking in a passive manner.

Sir God Qian Lan’s face grew grave. He had never thought that Jian Wushuang would keep a trump card on hand.

The moment the image was shown, Soaring Heaven King Palace was destined to be embarrassed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Sir God Qian Lan took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in him. He looked at Jian Wushuang, “Young man, you should know Real God Han Quan’s importance to Soaring Heaven King Palace!”

“I know, of course I know,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Real God Han Quan was the number one Real God in Soaring Heaven King Palace. He was in the eleventh place on Real God ranking list.

Plus, he was truly a genius. He didn’t take a long time to grow to his current stage and he was full of potential. Although he wasn’t like Jian Wushuang, he stood a great chance to break through and become an Almighty.

Such a genius was of course unusually important to Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“Tell me, what do you want us to do for you to release Han Quan,” Sir God Qian Lan’s voice was low.

He had no choice.

If Jian Wushuang were to just be an ordinary Chaotic Real God, or even just an expert on Real God ranking list, he would not hesitate to kill Jian Wushuang.

But the crucial thing was that the power that Jian Wushuang had displayed was not any weaker than his. Even during the earlier fight, he had had the lower hand.

With such power, he couldn’t kill Jian Wushuang at all. He could only suppress his anger and murderous intention.

“Sir God Qian Lan, if you said so, let’s talk about terms,” Jian Wushuang smiled. The scene before his eyes was within his expectations.

Actually, with his power, he could totally kill Real God Han Quan straight away but he didn’t. He only held him back using Blood Mountain Sword.

Jian Wushuang did so, of course, with something in mind.

To him, it didn’t matter to kill Real God Han Quan or not. After all, Real God Han Quan couldn’t pose a threat to him, but he wanted to utilize Real God Han Quan to bring himself some benefit. At the same time, he could also make Soaring Heaving King Palace’s heart ache.

“You want me to release Real God Han Quan? Soaring Heaven King Palace has to fulfill three conditions,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Three conditions?” Sir God Qian Lan pressed down the anger in him. “Say them!”

“Firstly, I need some Doctrine Gems. As for the amount, not much, just one hundred thousand Doctrine Gems,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Phew!”

In the void, there were gasps of surprise.

Jian Wushuang shook everyone as he spoke.

One hundred thousand Doctrine Gem? One should know that an ordinary Chaotic Real God’s possession would most likely be around one to two hundred Doctrine Gems, while a top Chaotic Real God would be decent enough to have a thousand Doctrine Gems. One hundred thousand Doctrine Gems would require a hundred top Chaotic Real God to make up the sum.

To any ordinary Real God, the amount was beyond imagination.

“Alright, I promise you that,” Sir God Qian Lan’s face remained unchanged.

One hundred thousand Doctrine Gem was naturally an astronomical figure to a Real God. However, to an Almighty, it wasn’t much. To Soaring Heaven King Palace, which was a great force, it was nothing.

“Secondly, I need some demon cores. It’s best if they are grade three and above. As for the amount… The ordinary black grade three demon cores, a thousand of them; Green grade three demon cores, a hundred; Crimson grade three demon cores, slightly less, about ten will do,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

The experts hidden in the void heard that and everyone was staring.

Demon cores were something that only the Eight Lairs had.

They could only be obtained by hunting Star Demons. The Demon cores that Jian Wushuang asked for, even if they killed one-tenth of the Star Demons in the Eighth Lair, they probably couldn’t gather the number.

“Alright,” Sir God Qian Lan’s corners of his lips quivered.

If an Almighty was willing to head to the Seventh Lair or the Sixth Lair to wander and massacre Star Demons, he almost wouldn’t come across anything threatening as long he didn’t enter the dark region. He should be able to gather the demon cores after a few thousand years. To Soaring Heaven King Palace, it could be accepted.

“The last condition, you know that I am cultivating on Thunderbolt Island and I have the token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, but it’s a pity that the cultivation time on my token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy isn’t much left. So, I’d like to get some from Soaring Heaven King Palace. Not many, just five hundred years will do,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Dream on!”

This time, Sir God Qian Lan couldn’t hold back anymore but roared with anger.

If he wasn’t bothered about Jian Wushuang’s power, he would have cut him into eight big pieces long ago.

The experts hidden were shocked too.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang was demanding an exorbitant price.

The token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy was different from Doctrine Gem and demon cores, it wasn’t something that you could have if you wanted.

Sanctuary Alliance distributed the tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy every three hundred thousand years. Although Soaring Heaven King Palace was the top force, they only receive two every three hundred thousand years. Every time they received the tokens, they would immediately give them to geniuses under their command.

It could be said that the token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy was extremely precious to Soaring Heaven King Palace.

But then, Jian Wushuang was asking for five hundred years of cultivation time in Fairy Palace. It equaled five tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy!

“Sir God Qian Lan, don’t be angry just yet. Although five hundred years of cultivation time in Fairy Palace is precious, it couldn’t be compared to a genius who could break through and become an Almighty, right?” Jian Wushuang smiled. “How about this: you can return to discuss with your Palace Master and higher-ups in Soaring Heaven King Place. Come and look for me when you have made a decision!”

“I’ll give you a hundred years time to discuss.”
