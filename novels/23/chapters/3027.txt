“Peak of rank three!”

“His sword skills just now have reached the level of peak of rank three!”

The Magic Note King was so shocked that he did not know what to say.

At first, it was only a level two skill, not even a peak of rank two skill, but because of the short fight with him, it directly reached the level of peak of rank three skill...

“Magic Note King, I should thank you. Without you as my sparring partner, it would not be so easy for me to upgrade my sword technique.” Jian Wushuang looked at Magic Note King with a faint smile.

Magic Note King let out a sigh of relief and finally calmed down, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, you win. Your talent is definitely the most terrifying one I have ever seen. I thought you were a genius of the Primal Palace in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, but now it seems that you can definitely enter the legendary Chaos Palace, and it’s unknown whether you can find a genius like you in the palace!”

“I can’t kill you, so you should leave.”

The Magic Note King had already asked Jian Wushuang to leave.

Hearing this, the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom changed their expressions, but then they felt relieved.

Indeed, the Magic Note King had personally made a move, but they all saw that the Magic Note King really could not kill Jian Wushuang.

Since he could not kill Jian Wushuang, he naturally had to let him leave.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. “Lord of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, you know that I have no enmity with your Magic Note Divine Kingdom. I came to the Magic Note Divine Kingdom to complete a mission of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. I accepted a heaven-grade mission to kill 12 True Saint experts under the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, but so far, I have only killed eight of them.”

Jian Wushuang had already killed seven people, including Holy Master Huocang. He had also killed one of the True Saints who had surrounded him. However, he still killed eight people and was four short.

“What do you mean?” The Magic Note King stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“My meaning is simple. I haven’t completed my task. Of course, I will leave after I complete my task,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You still want to kill four True Saints in my Magic Note Divine Kingdom?” The Magic Note King’s voice was filled with anger.

“That’s right.” Jian Wushuang looked straight at the Magic Note King without any fear.

Seeing this, the Magic Note King could only suppress his anger, he calmly said, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, you accepted the mission of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance for the reward of the mission. How about I give you double the reward of the mission?”

Under normal circumstances, the Magic Note King would never bow his head.

However, he could do nothing about it. He knew that he could do nothing to Jian Wushuang. If Jian Wushuang was determined to kill the experts under the command of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, he could not stop him.

However, the people Jian Wushuang wanted to kill were all experts under his command, and they were all under his protection. Now that there were so many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom around, he naturally wanted to protect them as much as possible, no matter what method he used.

“Double the reward?”

Jian Wushuang’s heart was moved.

If he completed this mission alone, he could get 150 million sacred elixirs, which was already a large number. If he got double the reward, it would be 300 million sacred elixirs. Such a large amount of sacred elixirs...any rank three True Saint would feel extremely distressed.

Of course, for the Magic Note King, who had created the Great Divine Kingdom and was an ancient fourth-level True Saint, 300 million sacred elixirs should be nothing.

“Magic Note King, the conditions you mentioned have indeed tempted me, but unfortunately, I’m in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. I don’t accept missions. As long as I accept them, I will do my best to complete them. Moreover, I have to complete the mission this time because those people I want to kill deserve to die!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, his voice reverberated between heaven and earth, and it was obvious that there was no room for negotiation.

What a joke. The reason why Jian Wushuang accepted this mission was firstly that it was extremely difficult and stressed him greatly, so he could seek a breakthrough.

Secondly, it was because the people who were to be killed in this mission deserved to die.

Holy Master Huocang, who had burned one-tenth of the cultivators in a realm into ashes to refine his natal magic weapon, was so cruel that heaven and earth would not tolerate him.

The other people on his kill list were also extremely evil.

How could Jian Wushuang show mercy to such a person?

Therefore, not to mention the double reward, even if he was given ten times the reward, he would not change his mind.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are going too far!” The Magic Note King was finally completely furious!

He had already lowered himself and was willing to pay the double reward, but the Heavenly Sword Marquis still refused and wanted to kill the True Saints under him. How could he not be angry? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“You’re going too far? Humph, so what if I’m going too far?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were also cold. “Magic Note King, I’m too lazy to talk to you. I must kill the remaining four people on the list. If you’re sensible, go back to your palace. After killing all four of them, I’ll leave the Magic Note Divine Kingdom and won’t have any dealings with you anymore.”

“But if you are stubborn and try to stop me...do you believe that I will slaughter all the True Saint experts in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom?”

“Don’t you dare!” Magic Note King was furious, and his terrifying divine power suddenly pressed toward Jian Wushuang.

“Do you think I dare?” Jian Wushuang was also surging with divine power. With the support of various secret skills, his divine power was even stronger than Magic Note King’s.

He was not afraid of the Magic Note King at all.

The Magic Note King was so angry that his body was trembling, and he stared at Jian Wushuang with his scarlet eyes.

“Good! Good! Good!”

The Magic Note King said three good words in a row, and each ‘good’ was almost gnashing his teeth. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, just you wait. I want to see how you kill the person I want to protect!”

After saying that, Magic Note King turned around and left. As for the dragon-imprisoning compass formation that had been sealing the area, it was naturally taken away by Magic Note King.

“Let’s go!”

Since Magic Note King had left, the Immortal Saints of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom did not dare to stay any longer. They left as quickly as possible.

Jian Wushuang looked at their backs and narrowed his eyes. “Magic Note King, I hope you can be smarter. Otherwise...”
