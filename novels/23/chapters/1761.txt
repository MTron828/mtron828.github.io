Chapter 1762: Big Trouble

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Silence!

In the void outside of Vientiane Tower, the entire Sea City was in a dead silence.

Stunned! Astonished!

Everyone was lost for words in amazement.

Sir God Chi Xing had revealed shocking power earlier and every cultivator at the scene was amazed. However, in an instant, Sir God Chi Xing had been killed by Jian Wushuang with one palm. It was too much of a contrast and everyone had yet to respond.

Sir God Chi Xin was an Almighty and he was so powerful. To kill him with one palm… just how much more powerful was Jian Wushuang?

“This, this… how is it possible?”

The people from Soaring Heaven King Palace were dumbfounded and they stood there in shock. Real God Xue Kong was staring with his eyes wide.

“Can’t even withstand one hit,” Jian Wushuang pouted. Then, he looked at Real God Xue Kong and the others, “Sir God Chi Xin died and it’s your turn next.”

Jian Wushuang said and there were two resplendent golden lights that soared up from both of his sides.

The two golden lights were like two golden suns. They gave out a magical power. The moment they appeared, they burst out at a terrifying speed.

The two Hong Jun Golden Swords shuttled to and from the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace under the control of Jian Wushuang.

Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst!

The figures were pierced instantly with no mercy. The Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace looked terrified.

“Run!”

“Hurry up and run!”

Jian Wushuang killed an Almighty with one palm. The Real Gods didn’t even think about counterattacking and started fleeing.

However, no matter how fast they ran, they were much slower than the Hong Jung Golden Sword.

The difference was too vast.

The two golden lights shuttled back and forth the void. They caught up with the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace who were fleeing and killed them with ease.

In a short time, probably less than one breath time, the Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace who were running away were all killed besides Real God Xue Kong.

But Real God Xue Kong was alive because Jian Wushuang had intentionally let him stay alive.

“Do you know why I kept you alive?” Jian Wushuang put away the Hong Jun Golden Swords and walked to Real God Xue Kong as though he was taking a leisurely stroll in the garden.

“Demon, demon!” Real God Xue Kong looked at Jian Wushuang with a horrified expression. Even since he had cultivated, it was his first time being so terrified.

The person before him was too strong.

He was so strong that it made him feel hopeless.

Jian Wushuang stopped at about ten meters away from Real God Xue Kong. He smirked, “I kept you alive because I hope you can bring a message back to Soaring Heaven King Palace. Tell them that I remember very clearly the besiegement in the Eighth Lair previously and the attack at the border of Buddhist Demon Sea where I was badly injured. Now, it’s time for me to settle our accounts.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Sir God Chi Xing is only the beginning!”

“Next, the massacre will continue. Tell them to clean their necks and be prepared to get slaughtered.”

Jian Wushuang spoke with a cold voice and he didn’t lower his volume. Not only did Real God Xue Kong hear him, the surrounding cultivators also heard him clearly too. They gasped in surprise.

“Go back,” Jian Wushuang waved at Real God Xue Kong.

Real God Xue Kong gulped, suppressed the fear in him, and turned around stiffly to leave. In a short while, he disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Jian Wushuang smirked coldly at the sight. Then, his figure turned illusionary and vanished into thin air.

Until Jian Wushuang left, Sea City that was in dead silence for a short while let out an uproar again.

The countless cultivators in the entire Sea City were bubbling with excitement.

One should know that they had witnessed an Almighty’s death with their own eyes and he had been killed with just one palm!

It was difficult for them to even see an Almighty normally, let alone watch one being killed.

Besides, from their viewpoint, they reckoned that the battle between Jian Wushuang and Soaring Heaven King Palace was even more vigorous than their previous fight in the Eighth Lair.

“There’s going to be big trouble!”

Everyone understood that.

Forget about how the battle between Jian Wushuang and Soaring Heaven King Palace would develop. Jian Wushuang, a Real God, he had killed Sir God Chi Xing, an Almighty, with just one palm. The news itself could stir up a great commotion in the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

The news naturally spread like wildfire.

The entire Eternal Chaotic World was shocked at the news.

It was bedlam in Thunderbolt Island.

Countless experts were surprised and they found it unbelievable.

It was an Almighty. Plus, Sir God Chi Xing wasn’t weak among Sir Gods. In the end, Jian Wushuang had killed him with one palm. Just how powerful was Jian Wushuang?

At the peak of Sir God? Close to Emperor God? Or he could already compare favorably with Emperor God?

He was only a Real God after all.

As they were in astonishment, experts from all forces were anticipating what was going to happen next.

Jian Wushuang had barged into Sea Continent alone and killed Sir God Chi Xing and many Real Gods in front of everyone. Not only had he embarrassed Soaring Heaven King Heaven, but he had also come into their territory. Soaring Heaven King Palace would definitely respond.

Plus, Jian Wushuang had also said that Sir God Chi Xing was only the beginning. Then, there would be an even more ferocious massacre. There might even be other Almighties who would die.

Everyone was looking forward to it.

But no one knew that just as the news spread, the main character of the story, Jian Wushuang, had already arrived at Soaring Heaven Mansion alone.

Soaring Heaven Mansion was the supreme headquarters of Soaring Heaven King Palace on Sea Continent. Although it couldn’t be compared to the true lair of Soaring Heaven King Palace on Soaring Heaven Land, it was definitely a taboo place that no one dared to provoke within Sea Continent. At least, Soaring Heaven King Palace had the power to intimidate all forces in Sea Continent.

Jian Wushuang was already in the void outside of Soaring Heaven Mansion.

“I want to take revenge. I want Soaring Heaven King Palace to erupt, I want them to pay a heavy price. So, I have to try my best to kill all their higher-ups and the higher-ups of Soaring Heaven King Palace will mainly gather in these two places. One is their old lair in Soaring Heaven Land and the other one is Soaring Heaven Mansion,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

To take revenge and attack a force, was there any other more satisfying way than barging into their supreme headquarters directly and kill a large number of their experts?

The two supreme headquarters of Soaring Heaven King Palace, the old lair on Soaring Heaven Land, was the most important place and would be more powerful. With Jian Wushuang’s power, he wasn’t confident that he could break through. However, Jian Wushuang was extremely confident if it was Soaring Heaven Mansion on Sea Continent.

“I let Real God Xue Kong bring back the news saying Sir God Chi Xing is only the beginning. They surely thought I would continue to stay in Sea Continent to seize an opportunity to kill more of their experts. They never thought I would charge into their supreme headquarters straight away.” There was a glimpse of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.
