4194 The Supreme Martial Artist Arrives

A supreme martial artist had arrived!

This was the arrival of a Supreme martial artist!

The hearts of the many Ultimate Rulers present were filled with shock.

Ruler Whitefloat was expressionless as he swept his gaze across the Omega Rulers. He said in a calm voice, “I’m looking.”

In an instant, the Rulers of the Great Void Temple standing respectfully in front of him responded with a loud ‘yes’. A large portion of them split off and shot toward the Tarot Ruins.

A small portion of them headed toward the nearby Ultimate Rulers.

“Have you seen this person?”

The Great Void Temple master’s expression was cold. He held a palm-sized profound light mirror in his hand as he continuously questioned the Ultimate Rulers present.

The figure in the mirror was none other than Jian Wushuang! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I’ve never seen him.”

“I don’t.”

The other Ultimate Rulers all shook their heads.

However, those who had seen Jian Wushuang before recognized him immediately.

“Eh, isn’t this the little guy who came here with the Ninth Kalpa King and the others a thousand years ago?”

“That’s right. I remember this person too. I have a deep impression of him. When they came, I even mocked him by the side, saying that he was a mere fourth stage Ruler and that he had come to the Tarot Ruins to seek death.”

“Didn’t this person enter the Tarot Ruins a long time ago?”

As soon as these words were spoken, the many peak-Level Ultimate Rulers of the Great Void Temple narrowed their eyes.

A moment later, the Rulers of the Great Void Temple who had entered the Tarot Ruins emerged and stood in front of the Ruler Whitefloat.

“My Lord, we didn’t find that person’s figure.”

“My Lord, I heard that the Ninth Kalpa King has left the Tarot Ruins, and the person who is hunting down the Divine Son must have left with him.”

Ruler Whitefloat nodded his head indifferently. He looked at the people who had said that they had seen Jian Wushuang before and said, “Take him away.”

“Yes!”

In an instant, those who said that they knew Jian Wushuang were forcefully taken away by the peak Ultimate Rulers of the Great Void Temple.

Not long after, the Great Void Temple fleet that was pressing down on the starry sky slowly turned around and headed in a certain direction!

The direction of the voice was the Divine Life Palace!

It was only after the fleet of the Great Void Temple had left that everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

On the top floor of the Nine Emperor Pavilion, that fat elder stood in front of the railing. He looked at the Great Void Temple’s fleet leaving with a complicated expression.

They were well-informed and naturally knew that the Divine Son of the Great Void Temple had pursued a stage four great Ruler in the Tarot Ruins, but his whereabouts were unknown.

The whereabouts of the Divine Son of the Great Void Temple were unknown…

The broken crown of the Third Prince of Da Feng…

When he connected the two together, the fat old man’s heart skipped a beat.

“This person is a heaven’s favorite on the Nine Emperor List of the Nine Emperor Pavilion. If he is in trouble…no, I must report this to that Lord.”

The fat old man made a decision in his heart and hurriedly went downstairs.

….

In the vast universe, a pitch-black universe boat was flying at high speed.

“The bone sea star area is in front of us. After we go through the universe passage in the bone sea star area, we will be closer to the divine Palace.”

In the cabin of universe boat, the Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng were looking at the void space through the dark light mirror of universe boat.

It had been nearly 800 years since they left the Tarot Ruins. They had been traveling through the universe passages and were getting closer and closer to the Divine Life Palace.

“Come to think of it, the source of all the trouble on this trip to the Tarot Ruins was divine Lord qianye and the others. If they hadn’t left the team on their own accord, causing our strength to drop sharply in the Fengyang Canyon, then we wouldn’t have been chased down. If they had worked together with us back then, we could’ve used our strength to get the Supreme divine herb back in the Fengyang Canyon.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng sighed.

Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King and Jian Wushuang smiled and did not speak.

For Jian Wushuang, if Qing Xuzi had not chased after him, he would not have entered the second level of the Tarot Ruins by accident and obtained the Tarot sword, the Tarot sword Codex, and other universe treasures.

“Ninth Kalpa King, if we are to talk about the harvest this time, among the three of us, you have obtained the most since you obtained the Supreme divine medicine. When we return, you have to repay Jian Wushuang and me well.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng joked in a sour tone.

“Hahaha, when have I, the Ninth Kalpa King, ever been a stingy person? Don’t worry, I’ll definitely reward you handsomely when we return.” Seeing that the Divine Life Palace was getting closer and closer, the Ninth Kalpa King was in a good mood and made a rare joke.

As he spoke, he turned his head and gave Jian Wushuang a meaningful look.

If he had not seen the battle between Jian Wushuang, Lord Zhennan, and the Third Prince, he would have thought that he was the biggest winner of this trip. However, from that battle, he could see that Jian Wushuang, who didn’t show his strength, had definitely gained more than him!

Just the divine power similar to the ‘One Thought Divine Kingdom’ alone had surpassed everything he had gained from this trip to the Tarot Ruins!

However, he and Jian Wushuang had a tacit understanding not to say anything about this. Even when Divine Marquis Qingfeng asked about the details of the battle, the two of them would give a vague answer.

The Ninth Kalpa King understood that everyone in the world had their own secrets. Since Jian Wushuang did not take the initiative to tell him, he naturally would not ask.

In any case, to him, that Supreme divine medicine was the most suitable opportunity for him!

As for what opportunities Jian Wushuang had obtained, it had nothing to do with him.

The three of them chatted casually and closed their eyes to rest. Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, another 100 years had passed. The surrounding universe void finally became bustling and lively. From time to time, they could see all kinds of universe boats passing by.

The Divine Life Palace was finally right in front of him.

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes. From where they were, they could already see the divine Kingdom controlled by the Divine Life Palace in the distance through the mystic Light realm of the universe boat.

“I haven’t seen you for such a long time, I wonder how Shuang ‘er is doing now.” Thinking of Leng Rushuang, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but smile and muttered to himself.

After returning to the Divine Life Palace, my next step will be to break through to the fifth stage Ruler realm. Jian Wushuang thought about it again.

His cultivation level was no longer important. Whether it was the strength of his divine power or his comprehension of the principles of the universe, he had already reached the peak of the Ruler realm.

It was not difficult for Jian Wushuang to break through to the fifth stage Ruler. He just had to integrate the eighth principle.

Although the integration of principles of order became more and more difficult, Jian Wushuang had absolute confidence in himself.
