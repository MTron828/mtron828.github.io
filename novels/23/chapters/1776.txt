Chapter 1777: Unable To Do Anything

As Jian Wushuang took his seat, the huge Clear Sky City quietened down completely.

Everyone had raised their heads and they were looking at the stage on top. Only two people remained in their lines of vision.

These two people were naturally Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Tian Xiao!

Two super experts who were in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, two super existences who could frighten the Eternal Chaotic World.

Apart from the two of them, the small number of Sir Gods who had come with the Soaring Heaven King Palace did not have the right to stand on that stage.

Atop the stage, Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Tian Xiao were a hundred meters apart from each other. Their eyes looking at one another and glowing with a shrill light.

The space had frozen completely a long time ago.

After a long time, Emperor God Tian Xiao was the first to speak, “Jian Wushuang, even I have no choice but to admire you. You actually dared to come for this appointment. Aren’t you scared that I would set a trap here and besiege you?”

“No matter what traps and trump cards your Soaring Heaven King Palace has, go ahead and bring all of them out. No matter what they are, I, Jian Wushuang, will wipe them out by myself!” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Is that so?” Murderous intent shone in Emperor God Tian Xiao. At that moment, he wanted to take action right away and combine his attacks with some of the techniques that he had prepared in their current location previously to kill Jian Wushuang on the spot.

“If I were to take action, there would only be a thirty percent chance of me getting my way!” Emperor God Tian Xiao was hesitating. However, his expression changed abruptly.

“The old monster of the Star Palace?” Emperor God Tian Xiao’s eyes shrank violently.

He had already noticed the Star Palace Master who was in the void nearby. However, the Star Palace Master did not show himself.

“Seems like you have made some preparations as well,” Emperor God Tian Xiao laughed coldly. He knew that since the Star Palace Master was nearby, it would be impossible for him to take action and kill Jian Wushuang straight away. Firstly, even if he were to go all out, he was only thirty percent sure that he could do it, and thirty percent was not high.

Moreover, even if his luck were good and he was able to kill Jian Wushuang, at the critical moment, the Star Palace Master would probably not stand by and look on.

However, as long as Jian Wushuang was not in a situation where he would die, the Star Palace Master would probably not take action at all.

“Emperor God Tian Xiao, tell me bluntly. Why did you get me to come here personally?” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly.

“It’s simple. I want you to leave the Soaring Heaven Land and the Sea Continent,” Emperor God Tian Xiao said.

“Haha, my massacre has only just begun and you want me to leave now? On what grounds?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

With regards to the Soaring Heaven King Palace which had attempted to kill him many times, Jian Wushuang would absolutely not show them any mercy.

At that moment, although he had killed quite a number of experts in the Soaring Heaven King Palace and he had forced the experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace to hole up in their base, it was still not enough. It was far from enough!

His flames of fury were not something that could completely subside by just killing a number of Sir Gods and some Real Gods.

He wanted to fight the Soaring Heaven King Palace until they were struck with fear and fight them until they knelt down on the ground to beg for forgiveness. If he had the ability to do so, he even wanted to eliminate the Soaring Heaven King Palace completely!

At that moment, Emperor God Tian Xiao wanted to stop him with just his words alone. Would that be possible?

“Jian Wushuang, your techniques are indeed impressive. Even if the Soaring Heaven King Palace wanted to kill you, it would be absolutely difficult for us to do so. However, this does not mean that the Soaring Heaven King Palace will really be afraid of you. The background of the Soaring Heaven King Palace is not something that you can imagine,” Emperor God Tian Xiao’s voice was ice-cold. With a flip of his palm, he took out a token.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted.

“Jian Wushuang, didn’t you ask me on what grounds? Let me tell you that it’s this token in my hand,” Emperor God Tian Xiao laughed coldly. After that, he exerted force in his palm and crushed the token right away.

The moment the token was crushed, there was no frightening power that was expected to burst forth. It was obvious that the token did not contain any technique that could kill Jian Wushuang.

However, after the token was destroyed, an aura spread slowly.

The aura was completely different from that of a Sir God or an Emperor God. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It was a supreme aura which could stand at the top of the Eternal Chaotic World.

The aura only belonged to one kind of realm and it was called ‘Great Emperor’!

“The aura of a Great Emperor expert?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed abruptly.

Under his attention, a huge, cold and arrogant figure took shape slowly.

She was more than five meters tall and curvaceous. Moreover, she had a beautiful face and possessed indescribable elegance and nobility. As soon as she appeared in the void, her eyes, which could cause serious injuries to everything by looking down at them, swept over the area. Everyone, including the Star Palace Master as well as Emperor God Tian Xiao, who her eyes swept past, could not help but lower their heads.

Even if it were Jian Wushuang, no matter how unwilling he was, he could only lower his head at that moment.

“I am Tian Xiao. Greetings to Colored Glaze Emperor!” Emperor God Tian Xiao was the first person to bow down and greet the elegant woman.

“Greetings to Colored Glaze Emperor.” Similarly, many experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace greeted her respectfully.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was a bit ugly. However, he still bowed to her respectfully.

There was no choice. The abilities of a Great Emperor-level supreme existence were right there. Not mentioning Jian Wushuang, even if the Underworld God who was the number one among the Emperor Gods was present, he would need to greet her respectfully.

“You are Jian Wushuang?” the Colored Glaze Emperor’s eyes was not filled with any feeling at all. She was looking down at Jian Wushuang as though she was looking down at an ant.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“The Soaring Heaven King Palace once forced you into a hopeless situation. However, you have already killed four Sir Gods as well as many Real Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Hence, the grudge is resolved!”

“From today, unless the Soaring Heaven King Palace provokes you again, you shall not kill any experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace within the Colored Glaze Sanctuary!”

“If you go against this… you’ll die!”

An ice-cold voice reverberated across the universe. Every word contained an infinite amount of god power and so much pressure was exerted on everyone that they were suffocating.

After her words left her mouth, the Colored Glaze Emperor’s figure dissipated slowly and completely turned into nothingness in the end.

It was not until the Colored Glaze Emperor’s shadow dissipated that the large number of cultivators present heaved a long sigh of relief.

Jian Wushuang got up. As he looked in the direction that the Colored Glaze Emperor had left in, his expression turned gloomy.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, did you hear the Colored Glaze Emperor’s words clearly?”

Emperor God Tian Xiao’s laughter, filled with ridicule, could be heard. His eyes then looked at Jian Wushuang with disdain, “I have said before that the background of the Soaring Heaven King Palace is not as simple as you think. The Soaring Heaven King Palace has been dominating the Colored Glaze Sanctuary for many years. Moreover, we have occupied two pieces of land. For us to be able to do this, how would we not be related to the Colored Glaze Emperor at all?”

Jian Wushuang had an ugly expression.

He had not expected the Soaring Heaven King Palace to make such a move.

Since a Great Emperor had come personally, even if it were him, he would be worried about it.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Emperor God Tian Xiao’s voice could be heard again, “The Colored Glaze Emperor’s orders are clear. If you dare to continue killing the experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace in the Colored Glaze Sanctuary, even without the Soaring Heaven King Palace taking action, the Colored Glaze Emperor will definitely take action personally to kill you. Jian Wushuang, although you are strong, won’t it still be easy for a Great Emperor to kill you?”

“Now, it’s time for you to make a decision!”

“Will you fight, or will you retreat!?”
