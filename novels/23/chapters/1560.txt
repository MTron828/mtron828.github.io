Chapter 1561: The Collapse Of The Sacred Altar And Falling To Rock Bottom

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Hmph, thanks to your Inverse Cultivation Test, I have returned to a newborn state,” the King of Venomous Worms complained.

“Newborn state? Which is equivalent to a newborn human baby?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“That’s right. If you were to fight with someone now, don’t hope for me to help you recover your Divine Power,” the King of Venomous Worms was obviously not happy.

“In my current state, how could I fight anyone? Perhaps even a random Universe God could kill me easily,” Jian Wushuang forced a smile. However, it was obvious that his mood had become slightly better.

During the next period of time, Jian Wushuang stayed at the Sword Star quietly and lived the life of a normal person.

As for the news of Jian Wushuang being poisoned by a potent poison and losing his abilities completely, it spread quickly within the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries like a storm.

Countless experts within the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries were shocked by the news.

Especially the experts on the Universe God ranking list. No one had expected Jian Wushuang, who had displayed his impressive talents in Wu Bei’s cave not long ago and was thus recognized by experts everywhere as one of the top geniuses by the Eternal Chaotic World, to actually experience such a change abruptly.

This had completely exceeded everyone’s expectations.

After getting to know such news, some people sighed emotionally, some people gasped in surprise and some people pitied him. However, there were of course people who were delighted at his misfortune.

For example, Zi Dongwang who was ranked fourth in the Universe God ranking list.

When he knew about Jian Wushuang’s change, he laughed delightfully.

“Poisoned by a potent poison, lost all his abilities and is even inferior to a normal person?”

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, I didn’t expect you to end up like this one day!”

“Hmph, it’s best for you to stay in this state forever!”

Back then, Zi Dongwang had suffered greatly due to Jian Wushuang. As such, he naturally hated Jian Wushuang.

Apart from people like Zi Dongwang who hated Jian Wushuang, there were also people who had good relations with Jian Wushuang. For example, Duan Lingfeng had sent a message at once to ask him how he was doing.

To the people who were concerned about him, Jian Wushuang had an easygoing look and he said that he was all right.

However, everyone knew without a doubt that his condition was not looking good and Jian Wushuang was hanging on with all his might.

Time passed by.

In the blink of an eye, three thousand years passed.

Under a big tree at the Sword Star, four shadows sat together.

Among the four people, apart from Jian Wushuang, there was Ling Feibai, Long Ya and Xuan Yi.

The three of them had some form of friendship with Jian Wushuang and for the past few years, they came to the Sword Star occasionally to meet Jian Wushuang. As for whether Jian Wushuang possessed the same abilities in the past, they were not concerned about it.

“Jian Wushuang, the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace is about to begin in a few days’ time,” Ling Feibai looked at Jian Wushuang and said.

“The battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and he laughed nonchalantly soon after, “Time really passes very fast. Another five thousand years have passed in the blink of an eye.”

He remembered that before Wu Bei’s cave opened, Lineage of Star had just held a battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace. Up to the very moment, he felt that five thousand years’ time had passed in just a split second.

“I am not participating in the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace this time around,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Not participating?” Ling Feibai, Long Ya and Xuan Yi who were beside one another looked at one another. After that, they nodded their heads.

All of them knew that the abilities of Jian Wushuang had not recovered at all. Hence, at his current state, he could not participate in the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace.

Moreover, rumors of it being impossible for Jian Wushuang to recover had already spread through the Lineage of Star a long time ago.

After all, a total of three thousand years had passed.

By his logic, if his abilities could recover, they already should have. However, at that very moment, there were still no signs of him recovering. Thus, this caused over seventy to eighty percent of disciples and experts of the Lineage of Star to think that it would be impossible for Jian Wushuang to ever recover.

As for the remaining people, they were disciples who worshipped Jian Wushuang’s previous fighting achievements blindly and they still believed firmly that there would come a day when Jian Wushuang would recover.

However, after many days, the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace was held. After Jian Wushuang forfeited, those disciples’ final belief disappeared gradually.

Everyone believed that the legend created by Jian Wushuang where the sacred altar that he was carried to by countless Universe God experts due to his impressive abilities in Wu Bei’s cave had… collapsed!

Since the sacred altar had collapsed, Jian Wushuang had fallen to rock bottom. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

There was probably no chance of him struggling in the future.

Even the Vientiane Tower had removed Jian Wushuang’s name from the newest Universe God ranking list.

Three thousand years ago, he had been a genius who was talked about enthusiastically by numerous experts in the Eternal Chaotic World. However, at that very moment, he had become a topic that the experts sighed about occasionally.

Even within Lineage of Star, there were also people who had been dissatisfied with Jian Wushuang.

After all, in the Lineage of Star, one had to be in the top five in the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace to be recognized as a Star Palace disciple.

During the most recent battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace, Jian Wushuang had forfeited straight away. On principle, he should be reduced to a normal disciple. However, in actual fact, the Lineage of Star had kept his position as a Star Palace disciple. Therefore, he still had the right to obtain a great amount of resources that would be available to Star Palace disciples.

For example, the Sword Star, as well as its maids, were the privileges of a Star Palace disciple and Jian Wushuang still had them to himself.

This had naturally caused quite a number of people to be envious of him. Even so, they were pushed back by Hall Master Yuan forcefully.

…

Inside a secret room within the Sword Star.

“Three thousand years have passed!”

“The Inverse Cultivation Test of the Third Heaven had gone on for a total of three thousand years. In spite of that, I feel that this test is still far from completion.”

Jian Wushuang was sitting down with his legs crossed in his position and he was getting a feel for his own body.

The Jian Wushuang of that very moment was still no different from a normal person. He still had white hair and an old look as if he could die any moment.

“There are still many years ahead of me and I cannot stay at the Sword Star all the time. If not, my mind will definitely collapse and I will go crazy,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. He was very certain of how much he had suffered over the past three thousand years. If not for his mind being exceptionally strong and having reached the peak of the first level, he would have broken down a long time ago.

If it were other people, even if they were Real Gods, they would definitely go crazy during the three thousand years.

Losing all his abilities abruptly, falling from a sacred altar to rock bottom and being reduced to a normal person abruptly. This was just like a monarch who had stood at the top becoming a beggar overnight. Moreover, it was a beggar who could not see any hope or light. Was this something that a normal person could bear?

Moreover, it was not known how long such a situation would continue for.

If Jian Wushuang were to stay in the Lineage of Star all the time, he would not be able to take it either.

Thus, he contacted Hall Master Yuan at once.

“Hall Master Yuan, I wish to go out to take a walk,” Jian Wushuang spoke of his own intentions straight away.

“Yes, it’s about time for you to go outside and take a walk,” Hall Master Yuan agreed as well, “Tell me, where do you want to go?”

“I am only a normal person now and it is impossible for me to travel within the Eternal Chaotic World. Hall Master Yuan, do you know of any place that normal people live?” Jian Wushuang asked.
