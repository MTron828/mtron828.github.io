Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng teamed up and fought against God Destroying King. Even the top experts in the hall were holding their breath as they watched the battle, as they were afraid that they might miss a detail.

After the battle had ended, everyone in the hall gasped in surprise.

“God Destroying King, lost?”

“Haha, Jian Wushuang and the white-robed swordsman are very impressive!”

“We made a mistake previously. We thought the white-robed swordsman’s Darkness Doctrine had reached the standard to pass the first level of Doctrine Palace. But in actual fact, both his Darkness Doctrine and Massacre Doctrine could pass the first level of Doctrine Palace. The flawless combination of both isn’t any weaker than God Destroying King in terms of comprehension towards Heaven Way. If it wasn’t because God Destroying King was that person’s disciple and acquired skills from the tutelage from him, he might not be the white-robed swordsman’s match.

“That Jian Wushuang, his consciousness attack and martial art motion is number one among all Universe Gods while his defense power and close combat ability could be in the top three among all Universe Gods. With this combination, the threat against God Destroying King is even greater!”

“The two of them teamed up, God Destroying King lost miserably.”

The Almighties discussed among themselves.

As for the Real Gods from various forces, they looked at Lei Chao enviously.

“Lei Chao, the little guy from Lineage of Star is very impressive!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu lost to him even though they teamed up. He even fought against and could be considered to have defeated God Destroying King with the white-robed swordsman. Such capability… Tsk tsk!”

“From the looks of it, Lineage of Star is going to give birth to another great expert again. Over the years, he might even stand a chance to step foot in the ranks of Almighty. He has great potential.”

Hearing the surrounding comments, even Lei Chao, who was of a cold disposition, revealed a smile.

He replied to the surrounding Real Gods as he immediately sent the latest news to Hall Master Yuan and the higher ups in Lineage of Star.

In Wu Bei’s cave where God Destroying King had fought earlier, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng sat down to recover.

They knew that there were countless Universe Gods looking at them but they couldn’t be bothered, nor did they mind.

Even the formation of God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu couldn’t do anything to defeat them, there was definitely no one else in Wu Bei’s cave that could pose a threat against both of them.

Just then, a scrawny man plunged into the void from afar and came before Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng.

“Vientiane Tower blackshirt greets both of you.”

The scrawny man was very polite. He bowed at Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng from a hundred miles distance.

“People from Vientiane Tower? How can I help you?” Jian Wushuang lifted his head and glanced at the scrawny man.

“I came here on the command of the higher ups of Vientiane Tower. We’d like to enquire this mister’s real name,” The scrawny man stole a glance at Duan Lingfeng carefully.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “To ask for his name? Is it for Universe God ranking list?”

“Yes,” the scrawny man smiled, “Misters should know that Universe God ranking list is announced after Vientiane Tower concluded. Previously, Mister White-robed Swordsman defeated Demon Girl Ling Luo, Vientiane Tower naturally listed him in the third place on Universe God ranking list. However, Vientiane Tower never knew his real name. Hence, we could only replace it with White-robed Swordsman. But, we can’t just keep it that way. So, they sent me to enquire.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang understood. He looked at Duan Lingfeng and he saw that Duan Lingfeng remained aloof. He immediately smiled and replied, “Return and inform the higher ups in Vientiane Tower that he is called Duan Lingfeng.”

The scrawny man beamed with joy, “Thank you.”

Then, the scrawny sent a message to the higher ups in Vientiane Tower.

In the blink of an eye, a few days passed.

Outside the cave, in the lofty hall.

“Everyone,” Master Tower Qi Fu on the higher place in the hall. The entire hall immediately went quiet.

“Vientiane Tower sorted out the latest Universe God ranking list. Everyone, take a look first.

Tower Master Qi Fu waved and the brand new Universe God ranking list suddenly appeared before everyone again.

Actually, Vientiane Tower sorted and released a Universe God ranking list every once in a while. However, the fight in Wu Bei’s cave and the massacre was too insane, which led to huge changes in the ranking on Universe God ranking list. Hence, whenever there was time, Vientiane Tower would tidy up the ranking list again and release it.

On the huge floating ranking list in the hall, the ranking appeared before the experts.

In the first place on Universe God ranking list was still God Destroying King.

There was no doubt. After all, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng had teamed up and suppressed God Destroying King. When fighting one-to-one, neither one of them could be God Destroying King’s match.

The second place on Universe God ranking list, Duan Lingfeng (White-robed Swordsman).

The third place on Universe God ranking list, Jian Wushuang.

The fourth place on Universe God ranking list, Zi Dongwang.

The fifth place on Universe God ranking list, Demon Girl Ling Luo.

The sixth place on Universe God ranking list, Xin Zhu.

The seventh place on Universe God ranking list, Tian Tian.

The eighth place on Universe God ranking list, Universe God Liu Ying.

The ninth place on Universe God ranking list, Seven Universe King.

The tenth place on Universe God ranking list, Demon King Ice Feather.

The eleventh place on Universe God ranking list, Universe God Mo Shou.

…

Compared to before, the brand new Universe God ranking list had drastic changes again, especially in the top ten on Universe God ranking list.

Zi Dongwang, who was originally in the second place, fell to the fourth directly.

While Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang took over the second and the third place.

As for Tian Tian… He was an expert who had suddenly risen during the days when the second level of cave opened. He had fought with Universe God Liu Ying once and had the upper hand. He naturally was listed before Universe God Liu Ying.

Demon King Ice Feather And Seven Universe King had fought head on once. In the end, Seven Universe King had had the upper hand by a slight bit. Hence the exchange of their rankings.

Besides that, there wasn’t much difference.

The experts in the hall generally agreed with the brand new Universe God ranking list.

If there were to be any discussion, it was about Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng’s ranking.

“Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng’s Power should be about the same. If we have to differentiate their strengths, I feel that Jian Wushuang is slightly stronger. After all, even God Destroying King can’t endure his soul attack. Duan Lingfeng might not be able to endure it either. On top of that, his martial art motion is so creepy. He has almost no weakness. If he were to fight a life and death battle against Duan Lingfeng. He would definitely be the one to have the last laugh.

“I think so too but it’s hard to say. If they were to not really have a fight, it’d be difficult to differentiate their power.”

“Haha. They are best friends and they don’t worry much about Universe God ranking list. Do you think you’ll be able to call for a match?”

There were Almighties and Real Gods sparring casually. However, the argument went nowhere. In the end, the brand new Universe God ranking list released.
