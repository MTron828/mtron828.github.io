“Then just go for it!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“We owe our current position to our great ancestor. Without him, Sword Marquis Mansion would have perished a long time ago.”

“He had tried so hard to lay the foundation for us. We can’t let those pests ruin his efforts.”

Jian Yu clenched her hands, her eyes flashing with firm determination.

“Oh right, the Elder left us a manual…” She stared at the token in her hand.

She allowed her consciousness to enter the token. Then, all of a sudden, her eyes opened wide.

“Terrifying! What a terrifying swordsmanship!”

“Do you mean the manual that the Elder gave us?”

“He knows such terrifying swordsmanship and used such amazing skills. Who is he? He can’t be great-grandmother’s old acquaintance!”

Her great-grandmother had merely reached the Peak of the Yang Void Realm and had not befriended any high-standing individuals. Yet that blind old man had called himself her old friend.

“f he knew great-grandmother, why did he only return after 2,000 years?

Moreover, if he was just a friend, he had no reason to care about Sword Marquis Mansion.

He had been so disappointed earlier.

“He’s not my great-grandmother’s old acquaintance. I think he has a close connection to Sword Marquis Mansion. Perhaps he’s one of our ancestors!”

“Our ancestor?”

Jian Yu was stunned.

“Is he… our Patriarch?”

Their founder was a legend in the history of Sword Marquis Mansion.

“Yes! That’s him! He’s undoubtedly our Patriarch!” Jian Yu exclaimed with excitement. “Our Patriarch’s disappearance back then was a mystery. Some suggested that he didn’t die but left for a vast world to pursue higher cultivation. He must have returned from that world.”

“He showed up to teach us a lesson after noticing our internal corruption! He intended to enlighten us!”

“Patriarch! He’s our Patriarch!”

Jian Yu was thrilled. It took her a while to calm down and she grasped the token tightly.

“From now on, the swordsmanship inside this token is the most precious treasure in Sword Marquis Mansion. Only the most talented is qualified to learn it and he must take a blood oath to never impart it to others. Whoever breaks the oath will be disposed of as a traitor.”

Jian Wushuang returned to his own appearance after reappearing in the Void. He took slow steps, but the span of each step covered thousands of miles.

“Why did you pretend to be a blind old man to teach your juniors a lesson instead of revealing your identity?” Gu King asked.

“Reveal my identity?” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Before setting foot in the Nanyang Continent, he had intended to reunite with his juniors of Sword Marquis Mansion as himself.

However, he changed his mind after walking into the tavern outside Sword Marquis Mansion.

He had spent half a day staying there and while he drank alone, his Soul Power had already covered the whole city. He had heard many conversations between warriors as well as between commoners.

Certain conversations taking place in private quarters were particularly eye-opening.

It was not until he heard these conversations that he realized how bad the corruption and disunity in the current Sword Marquis Mansion had become.

“Factions are formed and fellow clansmen plot against one other. In the fight for more interests, some even lay hands on another in private. Most disciples of the younger generation are snobs who bully others without concern for consequences,” Jian Wushuang said with a grim expression.

“They’re conceited and fearless even without me around. Won’t they become even more audacious if I reappear in public, thinking that I have their backs?”

He did not want to see the current situation in Sword Marquis Mansion.

He had shown up to punished junior disciples and even two Elders, Jian Yu and Jian Hua, as a warning for them to keep a low profile and realize the crisis within Sword Marquis Mansion.

“I’ve done all that I should do. The future of Sword Marquis Mansion is up to them now,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He had done more than enough, be it doling out advice or punishment.

He had no intention of interfering with the development of Sword Marquis Mansion. In fact, he did not even mind its decline, as long as it could be inherited from generation to generation.

After all, he could not stay here and guard Sword Marquis Mansion forever.

“What’s your next move?” Gu King asked.

“Let’s head for the Divine Land now. I’m worried that girl can’t hang on any longer,” Jian Wushuang answered with a smile.

“A girl? Does she have anything to do with you?” Gu King asked.

“You’ll know when we arrive there.”

Jian Wushuang continued his journey at full speed.

It did not take him long to reach the Divine Land from the Nanyang Continent without even taking the wormhole.

The Divine Land… was the core of this realm.

The Ancient World was under its control.

Back when Jian Wushuang first roamed the Divine Land, there were Three Ancestors, Nine Sovereigns, and 72 Marquises here.

These were all top figures of the Divine Land.

However, it had been 2,000 years. Things had changed a lot, as did the layout of the Divine Land.

Now, four influential factions ruled over the Divine Land.

The four forces were under the leadership of four overlords. One of them was called… Wushuang Sword Pavilion.

Wushuang Sword Pavilion appeared 2,000 years ago. Its founder was a?woman named Lin Lan.

Lin Lan used to be one of the 72 Marquises. Her cultivation speed had been fast but not impressive. But later, she made great progress and entered the Skyscraping Realm within a hundred years. Since then, she was one of the most powerful experts in the Ancient World.

The warriors of the Divine Land respectfully called her Queen Lanyue.

Under her leadership, Wushuang Sword Pavilion had existed in harmony with the other factions in the Divine Land for the past 2,000 years.

However, in recent years, Wushuang Sword Pavilion had turned against Spirit Palace, one of the four overlords. Both parties had descended into endless ferocious fights.

In the beginning, the two overlords had been evenly matched. But later, Wushuang Sword Pavilion was soon placed at a disadvantage.

Today, Spirit Palace had directly broken into their stronghold.

Wushuang Sword Pavillion was located on a vast land among the giant mountains.

“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!”

Deafening explosions resounded in succession, the sound reverberating throughout the mountains. The whole Wushuang Sword Pavilion had fallen into a state of manic slaughter.
