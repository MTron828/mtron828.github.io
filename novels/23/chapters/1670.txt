Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Shock!

Jian Wushuang’s mind was filled with shock.

The earth-shaking battle in the video had completely exceeded Jian Wushuang’s expectations.

The commotion and power generated from the battle were enough to show that it was a world-destroying battle.

There was also a huge number of experts who had fallen during the battle. Although Jian Wushuang did not participate in the battle, he could still feel that among the experts who had fallen, any one of them would definitely be a super expert who stood at the top of the pyramid if they were placed in the current Eternal Chaotic World. Moreover, it was also unknown as to whether the Eternal Chaotic World still contain super experts of that caliber.

Furthermore, it would be impossible for such a great battle to occur in the current Eternal Chaotic World.

“Ancient Past!”

“Great Battle of the Ancient Past!”

Jian Wushuang understood at once.

Ancient Past… that was an era that was so long ago that it had become a legend.

Jian Wushuang had also heard of some rumors about the Ancient Past. It was said that in the Ancient Past, there were innumerable experts, as well as plenty of super experts, who could destroy the universe and it was not an era that could be compared to the current Eternal Chaotic World.

However, after the great battle, the Ancient Past collapsed. Moreover, countless experts of that era were on the brink of extinction and even the universe had changed greatly. After the ancient past, another era seemed to have passed and the world had slowly developed into the current Eternal Chaotic World.

The Ancient Past was extremely long ago. Furthermore, the gap between the experts of that era and the experts of the current era was too huge. Hence, the Ancient Past became a legend. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, after looking at the video, Jian Wushuang could confirm that the video was showing the Great Battle of the Ancient Past!

The Seven Star Black Sect had probably disappeared during the Great Battle of the Ancient Past. As for the Master of the Crystal Palace, he was the black-robed man within the coffin which was in front of Jian Wushuang, and he was a super expert of the Ancient Past.

Apart from the great battle, the thing that had caused Jian Wushuang to be shocked the most were the loud shouts from the black-robed man during the great battle.

Jian Wushuang heard the name that he had mentioned in his loud shouts clearly.

“Xuan Yi! Xuan Yi!”

“It’s all because of you!”

It should be known that the name of Jian Wushuang’s Master was Xuan Yi as well.

With two similar names, Jian Wushuang could not help but guess that the Xuan Yi who the black-robed man mentioned was the same person as his Master.

Could his Master be a super expert who came from the Ancient Past, just like the black-robed man?

“Jian Wushuang.”

The strange old man Long Qi, who was dragging his golden tail, looked over, “You should have seen that video right? How do you feel? Do you feel very shocked?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head subconsciously.

“Haha. It’s normal for you to be shocked. Not to mention a little kid like you who is in the Pure Sun Realm, if it had been anyone else who saw that kind of great battle, he would also be extremely shocked,” Long Qi chuckled.

“Lord Long Qi, did you also participate in that battle?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Of course I participated. Even though that earth-shaking battle was many years ago, it still causes me to feel fearful. My Master was an unbelievable person. However, he nearly died during that battle. Up till now, he has been in a deep sleep and it is unknown when he will wake up again. Moreover, it’s a pity that my abilities were too low and I was unable to help Master at all during that battle,” Long Qi sighed.

“Lord Long Qi, your abilities were considered extremely low during that battle?” Jian Wushuang’s heart twitched. After taking a deep breath, he continued to ask: “Lord, do you know what caused that battle?”

“No idea.” Long Qi shook his head, “I am a Dragon Turtle and I have always been sleepy. Hence, I have always spent the years in deep sleep. It is only when Master calls for me that I will show myself and fight side by side with him. However, I have never asked Master about his personal life. Moreover, the battle back then came about abruptly. Not to mention me, even many fallen immortal existences were not sure about the cause of the battle up until the moment that they died.”

“Even without knowing the cause, all those super experts died?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. After that, he asked again, “Lord Long Qi, in that video, your Master mentioned the name Xuan Yi. Do you know that person?”

Jian Wushuang was expressionless. He naturally could not tell Long Qi that his own Master was called Xuan Yi.

“I don’t know about him.” Long Qi shook his head like before, “Although I don’t know who Xuan Yi is, I know that the cause of that shocking great battle is definitely related to him.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He knew that when he had heard the furious roar from the black-robed man in the video.

He could tell that the black-robed man hated Xuan Yi.

Jian Wushuang did not know whether the cause of the great battle was related to Xuan Yi. However, he could confirm that the destruction of the Seven Star Black Sect was definitely highly related to Xuan Yi.

“I wonder if the Xuan Yi who the black-robed man mentioned is the same person as my Master Xuan Yi. If it’s the same person, then my Master…” Jian Wushuang could not help but clench his fists.

He had already guessed that the background of his own Master was not normal.

However, he had never linked him to the Ancient Past.

Ancient Past… it was really too far away from that very moment.

“Jian Wushuang.” All of a sudden, Long Qi looked toward Jian Wushuang, “You have cultivated the Secret Skill of Seven Star and have also come to the place where Master is in a deep sleep. This means that fate has brought you and Master together. Please go and greet my Master.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

The black-robed man lying in the coffin in front of him was a super expert from the Ancient Past. Moreover, the Secret Skill of Seven Star which he had cultivated was also from the Seven Star Black Sect. Hence, Jian Wushuang found it worth it to greet the black-robed man in front of him.

Jian Wushuang came before the coffin, took a deep breath and paid respect to the black-robed man who was in the coffin immediately.

He paid respect to the black-robed man for two breaths’ time before standing up.

“Jian Wushuang, please follow me.”

After talking, Long Qi brought Jian Wushuang to the deepest part of the Crystal Palace.

Jian Wushuang naturally followed him obediently.

In a split second, Long Qi brought Jian Wushuang to a lofty palace.

The big palace was also composed of crystals. However, what was different was that the crystals were black in color.

The whole area was also in complete darkness and not even the slightest bit of light could be seen.

“Lord Long Qi, this place is…?” Jian Wushuang questioned doubtfully.

“Don’t be anxious, look carefully,” Long Qi said nonchalantly.

Jian Wushuang stopped asking and looked ahead of him quietly with great concentration.

The Crystal Palace was in complete darkness. However, bright starlight started to light up from the black crystals which were in front of Jian Wushuang.

There was a total of seven rays of starlight.

The seven rays of starlight were arranged in an extremely special way and in no time, they became a dazzling Seven Star Pattern.
