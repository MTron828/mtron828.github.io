“Of course, they just resemble a person’s eyebrows but are not necessarily really eyebrows.”?Gu King added.

“Agreed.”?Jian Wushuang nodded and breathed a sigh of relief.

There were many people looking very alike in this world, let alone things that were similar to the human body parts.

If the mountains he saw were really a man’s eyebrows, it would be too astounding.

“Jian Wushuang, you’ve seen that, right?” Celestial Master Yu Ding cast a glance at Jian Wushuang.

“Yeah.” Jian Wushuang nodded and exclaimed, “I didn’t expect our world to exist on an amazing battlefield.”

“I had the same expression as you when I saw this.” Celestial Master Yu Ding smiled, “The battlefield where our world is located is extraordinary. Although I don’t know why it is left here, since it is a battlefield, there must exist great opportunities! What’s more, it is a lost and unknown battlefield. That means it is fairly priceless!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

The remains of the battlefield were full of opportunities.

After all, when the war was over, there must be dead experts and a lot of treasures being scattered all over the battlefield.

And considering that the battlefield where the Green Fire World was located was spread out over a wide area, it was definitely the remains of a terrible battle, so the opportunities and treasures there would be beyond one’s imagination.

“Jian Wushuang, the Green Fire World is richly endowed by nature.”?Gu King also exclaimed.

“Richly endowed by nature?”?Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“This battlefield still remains such an astonishing power after so many years. The Green Fire World is invisibly influenced by it. That’s why the Green Fire World has produced more experts and possessed many more people with a special constitution than the other Eternal Worlds.”?Gu King sighed.

“For example, your father’s Sword Spirit Body, your girlfriend’s Primordial Great Sin Body, and so many unique and formidable bloodlines on the Samsara Continent, all of them are rarely seen in the Eternal Chaotic World, but they appeared in the Green Fire World, in the same era. I guess you have understood the good influence of that battlefield.”

Gu King’s comments left Jian Wushuang speechless with shock.

“However, the Green Fire World also faces a great risk. Since it is on this invaluable battlefield, it seems like guarding a mountain of treasures. Once top experts pass by and find this battlefield, then the Green Fire World will face disasters.”?Gu King continued.

Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

He understood the saying; “Sometimes, just possessing a treasure is enough to cause trouble for its owner!”

“Jian Wushuang, although you haven’t become famous for a long time, you have experienced a lot. I assume you must be very clear about the great benefits and dangers that this battlefield brings to the Green Fire World.”

Celestial Master Yu Ding looked at Jian Wushuang and added solemnly, “When you looked at the battlefield through the gray light bead, you must have seen an area covered by purple fog too.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He could see most of the battle scenes clearly but could see nothing in an area covered completely by purple fog.

“That is where the Jin Kingdom located.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

“The Jin Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

“It came to this battlefield from the Eternal Chaotic World more than five million years ago.” Celestial Master Yu Ding explained, “In fact, since the establishment of the Green Fire Palace, we have been fixing our eyes on this battlefield. Over the years, a total of three groups of experts from the Eternal Chaotic World have come to this battlefield.”

“We immediately noticed them when they set foot on this battlefield and killed all of them before they could figure out anything wrong here.”

“Kill them all?” Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows.

“We have no alternative.”

Celestial Master Yu Ding sighed, “After all, once the news about this battlefield spread, it will inevitably attract a large number of experts from the Eternal Chaotic World. Our Green Fire World will be annihilated then, without any room to struggle at all. Celestial Masters, Dao Masters in this world can choose to venture in the Eternal Chaotic World, but how about those ordinary Warriors?”

“They must die. The stronger ones will even be captured as slaves or bred in captivity like animals. In a word, they will live a life in which living is no better than dying.”

“For the sake of countless innocent people, our descendants, and hometown, we have to do that.”

Jian Wushuang understood all this after hearing Celestial Master Yu Ding’s words.

“Nurtured by this battlefield, the overall strength of our Green Fire World is much stronger than the other Eternal Worlds.” Celestial Master Yu Ding continued, “Other Eternal Worlds can only produce a top expert above the Celestial Master Level after untold years. It’s not bad for them to possess three or four top experts before they are annihilated.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“However, our Green Fire World has produced six such experts over the past 40 million years, except for those exceptional geniuses whose battle strength rivals the experts of that level.”

“Currently, there are five Palace Masters in the Green Fire Palace and they all possess the battle strength superior to that of Celestial Masters.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He only knew three such experts.

They were Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, and Tang Emperor. Who were the other two?

“Our Palace Masters are so formidable. When the two previous groups of experts arrived here, they acted personally and killed them before they could send the message out. Later, the third group of experts arrived.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said in a deep voice.

“They were experts from the Jin Kingdom!”

“They came here by taking a Spaceship. Among them, there were more than 10 top experts above the Celestial Master Level and numerous Celestial Masters as well as Dao Masters.”

“As soon as they set foot on to this battlefield, they figured out how extraordinary it was and the existence of the Green Fire World. So, they directly took actions, trying to destroy our world and occupy this battlefield.”

“Without doubt our palace fought back with all our strength!”
