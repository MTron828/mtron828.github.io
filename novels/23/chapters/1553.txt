On the peak of Ancient Demon Mountain, in the black palace.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The old lady in a black robe and the chubby, middle-aged man appeared simultaneously. The old lady in a black robe looked extremely solemn while the chubby, middle-aged man looked miserable. He was covered in blood and his aura was extremely weak.

“What happened?” His Highness Mu Hong creased his eyebrows and asked.

“Your Highness, the experts that barged into Blood Demon Church this time should be coming for us. They have three Real Gods fighting against the people of Blood Demon Church on the surface, but they have one Chaotic Real God who came here,” the chubby, middle-aged man said.

“Chaotic Real God?” His Highness Mu Hong said.

“Master,” the old lady in a black robe looked at Lord Leng and said politely, “There are two of them who barged into my formation. One of them is a Chaotic Real God while another, if I’m not mistaken, should be the top genius from Lineage of Star who is extremely famous, Jian Wushuang.”

Lord Leng, who had been sitting down at ease, her body suddenly quivered when she heard Jian Wushuang’s name. There was a glimpse of an unnoticeable expression in her eyes.

“Jian Wushuang? The third place on Universe God ranking list?” His Highness Mu Hong’s face grew cold.

“Yes, it’s him. Jian Wushuang is really monstrous. He is only a Universe God but even I had to put in some effort to deal with him. I can’t do anything about him. His strength might already be able to compared favorably to a peak Void Real God’s,” the lady in a black robe nodded.

“Humph, how monstrous. If it wasn’t because I happened to break through and became a Real God at the time, when Wu Bei’s cave came to the world, I couldn’t have entered Wu Bei’s cave. Otherwise… Why would the White Blaze Fruits and White Blaze Fruit Trees fall into his hands?” His Highness Mu Hong sneered.

The old lady in a black robe heard him and only smiled in silence but didn’t say much.

“Number Seven, what’s the situation like?” Lord Leng asked.

“Master, I trapped both the Chaotic Real God and Jian Wushuang using Red Stone Prison temporarily. However, the Chaotic Real God is too strong. I’m afraid he will break my Red Stone Prison forcefully in no time,” the old lady in a black robe looked solemn.

Red Stone Prison was her strongest trump card. Under normal circumstances, it should be sufficient to trap an ordinary Chaotic Real God. But the power of Real God Long Qing, who was trapped in Red Stone Prison then, definitely wasn’t an ordinary Chaotic Real God.

“Master, before Red Stone Prison breaks open from the Chaotic Real God, we’d better leave first,” the old lady in a black robe said

“Your Highness, hurry up and leave too,” the chubby, middle-aged man said anxiously. He was already severely injured by the Chaotic Real God and he had barely any fighting power left.

“What’s the hurry?” His Highness Mu Hong said in a low voice, “I’ve heard about Jian Wushuang for more than once. I heard that he is the top genius standing at the peak of Eternal Chaotic World. I wanted to fight against him long ago. Now that I have the chance, how can I miss it?”

“But…” The chubby, middle-aged man wanted to say something.

“Shut up,” His Highness Mu Hong reprimanded him, then he looked at Lord Leng with a faint smile, “Leng, wait for me here for a while. I’ll be right back.”

“Mm,” Lord Leng nodded faintly.

His Highness Mu Hong left the palace with the chubby, middle-aged man.

“Number Seven,” Lord Leng commanded, “You follow them. Remember, you only have to deal with the Chaotic Real God. As for Jian Wushuang, let His Highness Mu Hong deal with him on his own.”

“Yes,” the old lady in a black robe nodded then she disappeared in the palace again.

In the black palace, there’s only Lord Leng sitting alone in silence.

On Lord Leng’s face which was covered with a veil, there was a malicious smile. She rubbed her stomach involuntarily with her delicate hand. There was a consciousness in deep sleep. She had sealed off the consciousness long ago with all the tricks she had on hand.

“Sister, your sweetheart is so stubborn. He really chased after you from Green Fire World to Eternal Chaotic World. In merely ten thousand years, he became so famous. He’s really outstanding. No wonder you’re so into him!”

“It’s a pity that his heart is with you. Otherwise, your younger sister, me, would be quite attracted to him.”

Lord Leng muttered to herself. Her voice was so ghostly and creepy.

“Jian Wushuang, as you’re here, let me take a good look at your capability. Hehe…”

…

In the huge Red Stone Prison that covered the vast universe, Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing were trapped in the prison. They couldn’t break it apart in a short period of time. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, His Highness Mu Hong, the chubby, middle-aged man and the old lady in a black robe appeared in a corner of the Red Stone Prison.

“Your Highness Mu Hong, Jian Wushuang is at the end of this passageway. Just walk along the passageway ahead and you’ll see him. I’ll have to deal with a Chaotic Real God so I’ll not keep you company,” the old lady in a black robe bowed and then plunged in the direction of Real God Long Qing.

In the passageway in Red Stone Prison, His Highness Mu Hong stood side-by-side with the chubby, middle-aged man.

“Your Highness, I fought with a Chaotic Real God earlier and got severely injured. Not even ten percent of my power has recovered yet and Jian Wushuang isn’t weak, what if…” The chubby, middle-aged man had yet to finish what he wanted to say.

“What do you mean by ‘what if’?” Your Highness Mu Hong glared at the chubby, middle-aged man, “Leng is waiting outside as she watches. You want to embarrass me before her?”

The chubby, middle-aged man’s face changed but he never spoke again.

“Humph, he’s just a Universe God. Even if he is a genius, just how strong he can be?” His Highness Mu Hong had a scornful look.

He was pampered since birth and he had his father as his backer. He had always been riding roughshod over everything and never bothered with anyone, including those geniuses in Eternal Chaotic World.

The most important thing was that he was extremely confident in his power.

One should know that he had already broken through and become Real God and he had already comprehended one of the Nine Heaven God Doctrines, Darkness Doctrine. Although his comprehension towards Darkness Doctrine wasn’t high and wasn’t at the standard of passing the first level of Doctrine Palace, he possessed extremely aggressive Real God armor and divine weapons because of his father. On top of that, he had cultivated some secret skills and his fighting power had already reached the peak of a Void Real God.

With such a fighting power, from his point of view, no matter how amazing a Universe God was, he would be able to win against him.

“Don’t be in a hurry to fight with him directly. Let my two war puppets play with him first,” His Highness Mu Hong smirked coldly. He waved and two tall figures appeared before him. They were two war puppets of Void God level.

Under the guidance of His Highness Mu Hong, the two war puppets plunged ahead in the passageway.
