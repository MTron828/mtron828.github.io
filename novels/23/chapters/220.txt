Chapter 221: Demonic Puppet

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

His answer was so powerful and determined that the absolute beauty and the strong man were a little shocked.

The absolute beauty looked Jian Wushuang deep in his eyes, and roared in a low voice, “Demon Thirteen!”

Clang... The ground in front of Jian Wushuang suddenly tore open. Then a human-shaped demonic puppet wearing a greenish black battle suit appeared.

The demonic puppet held one sword in each hand, but he didn’t give out any breath.

“You said you can match your father, but it’s easier said than done. This demonic puppet is the weakest one among all the demonic puppets in the Ancestor’s Land, so as long as you defeat it, I will approve of your strength and allow you to take the Ancestor’s Land’s trial.”

“But if you can’t beat this demonic puppet, you’d better get your ass out of here,” said the absolute beauty in a cold tone.

“Defeat it?” Jian Wushuang looked at the demonic puppet in greenish black armor. Since it didn’t reveal any aura, he didn’t have a clue about the puppet’s strength unless they were to start fighting.

“I will have a try.” A touch of battle intent emerged in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as the Triple-kill Sword appeared in his hand.

The demonic puppet didn’t possess any wisdom, so as the absolute beauty ordered, it stamped on the ground and then dashed towards Jian Wushuang, piercing through the air along the way.

Swoosh! The demonic puppet appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, and then waved the two long swords in its hands, chopping at Jian Wushuang in succession. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

With no sword essence and no majestic swordsmanship, it only attacked with pure physical power; however, this power was unexpectedly threatening.

Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword cut out immediately, but when it clashed with the two long swords... Clang! Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but be forced back rapidly.

“Such strong power... it might be stronger than those experts at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, or even not far from those in the Initial of Yang Void Realm.”?Jian Wushuang was secretly astonished.

The absolute beauty sneered at him, “Boy, though Demon Thirteen is the weakest among all the demonic puppets in the Ancestors’ Land, it is at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

“Moreover, as a demonic puppet, despite it knowing nothing about sword technique and sword essence, its power, speed, and defending ability are far beyond an average human warrior at the peak of the Yin Void Realm, and possibly not much weaker than people in the Yang Void Realm.

“When your father came here, he also fought with Demon Thirteen. At that time, your father was already in the extreme of Exceptional Gold Core Realm, and he combined three special essences: dark, light, and thunderbolt. Though he had mighty battle strength and brutal swordsmanship, it took him no less than 20 breaths time to beat the demonic puppet down.

“And you... you’ll be lucky to last for 20 breaths, not to mention defeating it.”

When the absolute beauty finished her words, the demonic puppet rushed out again.

Swoosh! A horrible wind swept out.

The demonic puppet carried out its simple chopping attacks. However, the power given out by the two long swords was terrifying.

“20 breaths?” Jian Wushuang laughed. Then he thrust out his Triple-kill Sword, demonstrating the third move of the Selfless Sword Technique: Sky Isolating Form!

At the same time, four sword essences were combined, and the power of his swordsmanship burst out.

A mighty and golden flowing light clashed directly with the two swords. The shock wave spread out, forcing the demonic puppet backward. Jian Wushuang’s figure moved swiftly like a ghost, and then appeared next to the demonic puppet.

Shua!

A sparkling sword shadow cut towards the demonic puppet’s waist.

The demonic puppet’s strength was brutal indeed, but it knew no fighting skills and its body was clumsy. It couldn’t escape the sword shadow from Jian Wushuang.

But it seemed that the demonic puppet didn’t plan to dodge.

“It’s useless. The demonic puppet was made by special materials, and the greenish-black armor on its body is extremely firm and tenacious. Even a normal warrior at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm cannot hurt it easily, and you...” Before finishing her words, the absolute beauty was stunned.

The sword shadow given out by Jian Wushuang was heading toward the demonic puppet as if it could rip everything apart. When it chopped at its waist and scratched out... Shua! The entire stomach of the demonic puppet was cut open.

Since it was a puppet, neither blood nor organs rushed out.

“How could this be possible?”

The absolute beauty and the strong man were both shocked.

“Origin?” The absolute beauty looked over at Jian Wushuang immediately.

She sensed the mysterious power in Jian Wushuang’s sword. It was undoubtedly the Origin.

“No wonder you are so confident to compare yourself with your father. You should have mastered the Origin.” The absolute beauty stared at Jian Wushuang. “The Origin you mastered includes the four essences of Earth, Gale, Fire, and Water, so it should be the combined Origin of the World!”

“Origin of the World?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Though he knew he had mastered an Origin, he didn’t know which type it was.

Now he knew that what he comprehended was the Origin of the World.

“Fine. Since you can comprehend Origin at the Primordial Gold Core level, your battle strength is certainly more powerful than your father’s. I admit that you’re qualified to take the trial of the Ancestor’s Land,” said the absolute beauty.

Jian Wushuang, however, just slightly smiled.

“Boy, although you can take the trial, I shall warn you that the trial of Ancestor’s Land is not easy at all. It’s great if you pass it, but if you don’t, you will die in the trial, so you need to be prepared,” the absolute beauty said.

“If I can’t pass, I will die?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“My father also knew the danger of the trial, but he took it without hesitation because he was confident of his strength. And now I am even stronger than my father was!”

Jian Wushuang clasped his hands, and a hint of determination rose in his eyes.

Fortune comes with danger, and Jian Wushuang knew this very well.

Since he came to the Ancestor’s Land to improve his strength, he had been ready to take risks.

“Let’s do it,” Jian Wushuang looked at the absolute beauty and said in a low voice.

“Okay, come with me.” The absolute beauty looked back and led the way with the strong man.

Before long, guided by the absolute beauty, Jian Wushuang arrived at a pitch-black palace, whose gate was closed.

“The first test of the Ancestor’s Land is in the palace,” the absolute beauty said.
