Chapter 1584: One Against Two

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In terms of power, they were evenly matched. As for unique skill…

Jian Wushuang’s Reincarnation of the Highest Heaven and Real God Xue Wu’s Eighteen Heavenly Fire were both beginner rank two Real God unique skills. Their power was about the same.

However, Jian Wushuang’s Reincarnation of the Highest Heaven was an instant explosion of power after the power of Sword Principle gathered as one. It exploded the stronger power in an instant.

On the other hand, Real God Xue Wu’s Eighteen Heavenly Fire were segregated into eighteen continuous attacks and the power was spread. If they were to meet force with force, how could it be evenly matched with Jian Wushuang’s Reincarnation of the Highest Heaven?

Naturally, it would only be suppressed.

When they fought head-on, it wouldn’t win against Jian Wushuang. Then, Jian Wushuang immediately launched his martial art motion.

Shadows flashed in madness and appeared next to Real God Xue Wu occasionally to perform Sword Principle.

“His speed is getting even faster.”

Real God Xue Wu had six arms and carried a hammer in every arm. But then, he was shocked.

Previously, he had dealt with Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion with ease with his six arms. However, Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion was obviously much faster than before.

Even though he had six arms, it was rather difficult to keep up with Jian Wushuang’s speed.

Most importantly, when Jian Wushuang performed a Sword Principle, there was consciousness attack too.

The consciousness attack was very fierce, even he found it difficult to withstand.

With such combination, he was stifled in the battle with Jian Wushuang.

Suppress!

He was steadily losing ground!

The surrounding experts who were watching the battle saw the sight and everyone looked in disbelief.

“A Universe God can press against an Eternal Real God? How is it possible!!!”

“I can tell that Real God Xue Wu already gave his all, but he is still cornered.”

“Jian Wushuang… is too scary!”

Scary.

The people who were watching the battle could only use the word scary to describe Jian Wushuang.

Just as Real God Xue Wu was steadily losing ground from Jian Wushuang’s attack and was near defeat, there was a crimson figure that plunged over the void from afar. He arrived at the battlefield very soon.

“It’s Real God Chi Huo!”

“Four Symbol Mansion’s second Eternal Real God in Burning Demon Region!”

“Mister Chi Huo is here!”

It immediately stirred a great commotion around the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and looked at the visitor.

The person was an elderly in a crimson long-robe. He had a pair of blade-like eyebrows. At that very moment, the pair of blade-like eyebrows were faintly knitted as he looked in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

“A Universe God suppressed Xue Wu head-on?” If he didn’t see it with his own eyes, Real God Chi Huo wouldn’t believe it.

“This young man is extremely strong. Chi Huo, team up with me to kill him,” Real God Xue Wu who was suppressed by Jian Wushuang shouted.

Real God Chi Huo squinted his eyes but he didn’t hesitate and barged into the battlefield instantly.

“Another one,” Jian Wushuang wasn’t afraid. With the combination of his martial art motion and soul attack, he fought against the two Eternal Real Gods head-on.

He fought against two alone.

In the end… he only had the lower hand by a slight bit.

“This young man, he was only a Universe God. But when his power exploded, it felt like he isn’t much weaker compared to us Eternal Real Gods!”

“His martial art motion was too creepy. And his comprehension towards doctrines is too high!”

Real God Chi Huo and Real God Xue Wu were complimenting in silence.

In terms of power, they weren’t afraid of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang put all his tricks to play in collaboration with his secret skills and he barely increased his power to the level of an ordinary Eternal Real God standard.

One should know that the two Eternal Real Gods also knew secret skills that increase their power. If they were to perform it, they would definitely be more powerful than Jian Wushuang.

The reason why Jian Wushuang wasn’t afraid of them and couldn’t fight against them head-on was that Jian Wushuang’s comprehension towards the power of Heaven Way was too high.

“If I’m not mistaken, his comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine has already surpassed the second level in Doctrine Palace, and not even that far away from the third level. With such a comprehension level, one could be categorized as monstrous, even among Void Real Gods, let alone the fact that he is only a Universe God,” Real God Chi Huo found it unbelievable.

One must know that the comprehension of power of Heaven Way would be more difficult at a later stage.

An ordinary Void Real God would only need to possess comprehension towards the power of Heaven Way that could pass the first level in Doctrine Palace and he will be categorized as the peak among Void Real God.

As for the second level in Doctrine Palace… It was the standard of an ordinary Eternal Real God. Many Eternal Real Gods’s comprehension of doctrines stopped at that level and most of the time were only limited to one single doctrine.

How about Jian Wushuang? He comprehended two doctrines also and has already reached the standard of an Eternal Real God, or maybe even higher.

Besides, the Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine that he comprehended were both Supreme Doctrines. Comprehension of Supreme Doctrines is much more difficult compared to a Nine Heaven God Doctrine.

After a ferocious fight, although Real God Chi Huo and Real God Xue Wu gave full play to their power and put Jian Wushuang at a disadvantage, the situation was only confined to that. If they intended to cause severe damage to Jian Wushuang or to kill him, it was impossible.

Just then…

Vroom!

The entire void suddenly quivered.

At the back of the battlefield, at the volcano that everyone had forgotten about, the prohibition that covered the volcano suddenly collapsed.

A large amount of power dispersed with the prohibition. As it dispersed, there was a faint blade light that rampaged.

The sudden change of circumstances attracted everyone’s attention.

Even Jian Wushuang, Real God Chi Huo, and Real God Xue Wu, who were fighting, looked towards the source of the movement.

“Finally?” Jian Wushuang looked delighted.

Real God Chi Huo and Real God Xue Wu creased their eyebrows.

At the end of their sight, also the middle of the prohibition that was dispersing, there was a cold figure that was taking a stride forward slowly.

He was in a white robe, carrying a saber on his back. His face was cold, yet extraordinarily handsome.

Then, on the battlefield, everyone’s attention was caught by the figure in a white robe that was taking a huge stride forward.

“That is… Duan Lingfeng!”

Then, the experts at the scene recalled that the direct cause of the incident wasn’t Jian Wushuang but Duan Lingfeng. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

But Jian Wushuang displayed a terrifying power, an insane massacre and everyone’s attention was caught. On the contrary, they were distracted from Duan Lingfeng.

Until then, Duan Lingfeng only revealed himself before everyone.

Then, the experts at the scene could faintly feel the aura that was given out by Duan Lingfeng’s body.

“That’s a… Real God?”

Suddenly, everyone was stunned.
