Chapter 2460: Refuse

Crimson Stone Saint intended to take Jian Wushuang as his personal disciple.

He also believed that if he made an appearance, Jian Wushuang would be stoked of the opportunity that lay before him and agreed without hesitation.

However, Jian Wushuang shook his head without a second thought. “Sorry, I refuse.”

The Crimson Stone Saint was not annoyed. Instead, he tried to persuade. “Little guy, you might want to think carefully. Although I’m dead now, I was an Undying Saint after all. I have a lot of good stuff left for my personal disciple, including the Fengtian Scroll. If you agree to become my personal disciple, it’ll be beneficial to you.”

In addition, even if you don’t care about the things I left behind, you have to think about your current situation. You have killed too many genius disciples in my tomb and must’ve offended many sects. The experts who are waiting outside the tomb would probably chop you into pieces as soon as you walk out of this tomb.”

Well, if you agree to be my personal disciple, I’ll help you solve those experts waiting for you out there? After all, how can I watch my disciple being harmed as the master?”

Crimson Stone Saint was rather confident.

He believed that he would be able to convince Jian Wushuang.

Obviously, he underestimated Jian Wushuang.

The treasures he left behind were indeed precious and were enough to spark the interest of countless genius disciples in Wusha Wilderness, but Jian Wushuang was definitely not one of them.

An Undying Saint had a god-like existence in the Wusha Wilderness. At least, they were respectable in the eyes of many Wusha Wilderness cultivators.

Nonetheless, Jian Wushuang was different.

He was reincarnated to undergo cultivation. His previous life was in the Eternal Chaotic World. He had not only seen an Undying Saint, he even battled before with the legendary Realm Lord.

Whereas, in his current life, he was born as the second Perfect Chaotic Creature and had endless potential.

That being said, he probably would not care much about an Undying Saint.

Hence, being the disciple of an Undying Saint did not appear attractive to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was facing an extremely dangerous situation. He was aware that Narcissus Island had completely drawn a line with him and all the other sects would be waiting for him out there in the glade, but he was never afraid.

He would find a way to solve the turmoils he stirred up and not depend on others to save him.

Besides, the storm was arranged by Crimson Stone Saint with the purpose of forcing Jian Wushuang to be his disciple.

Crimson Stone Saint would have succeeded in his plan had Jian Wushuang agreed.

Why would Jian Wushuang be willing to do that?

“Old man, let’s not mention that you are dead and only your consciousness is still lingering around today. Even if you are still alive and at your peak, I’ll never agree to be your personal disciple, because...an Undying Saint like you are not qualified to be my master,” sneered Jian Wushuang.

He was speaking out his mind from the bottom of his heart.

He had only one master since he started his cultivation journey and that master was Xuan Yi!

Who exactly was Xuan Yi?

He was the first Perfect Chaotic Creature born in the Heavens and Earth. He relied on his own powers to climb to the top of the Ancient God Realm such that even the dignified Realm Lord had to bow to Master Xuan Yi.

That was his master.

Crimson Stone Saint... An old man who was dead for so many years and had just attained the status of an ordinary Undying Saint during his lifetime. Jian Wushuang did not think much of him.

Of course, besides his strength, the most important point was Crimson Stone Saint’s unscrupulous process in recruiting disciples.

Jian Wushuang might have considered the offer had he openly shown up and mentioned his desire to recruit Jian Wushuang as his personal disciple.

Jian Wushuang did not bother to pay him any attention because he had been playing tricks on Jian Wushuang and forcing Jian Wushuang to submit to his offer.

The Crimson Stone Saint narrowed his eyes hearing Jian Wushuang’s reply but kept his silence.

After a long silence, the Crimson Stone Saint spoke again, “Young people nowadays are becoming more and more arrogant. Well, since you are not willing, I’ll not force you. You will have to take care of your mess from now on. Good luck.”

Crimson Stone Saint smiled and his figure dissipated.

Jian Wushuang looked at the place where the Crimson Stone Saint dissipated into thin air with a strange expression. “That old fart left just like that? An Undying Saint should be very concerned about his face, but he did not hesitate to plot against me just to recruit me as his disciple? What’s his purpose?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang thought that Crimson Stone Saint must have his personal agenda to take him as his personal disciple.

Nevertheless, he could not figure out his intentions.

“Oh well, I hope he doesn’t pull my leg during Fengtian Scroll enlightenment and Divine Power Ocean,” murmured Jian Wushuang before closing his eyes.

In that hidden independent space, the Crimson Stone Saint’s vague silhouette appeared.

“I can’t believe he turned me down?”

The Crimson Stone Saint was quite surprised.

He never thought that Jian Wushuang would so bluntly refuse his offer after he personally went forward to invite him. He was not stingy with his offer. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was not in a good position.

“If I’m right, he refused because he has absolute confidence in his own strength or talent. He wants to use the next two major opportunities, Fengtian Scroll and Divine Power Ocean to increase his strength and face the experts from the various sects outside the tomb.”

Yes, that should be the case.”

Crimson Stone Saint murmured as he had also figured out Jian Wushuang’s mind, “Huh, if that’s the case, I will have to see how much progress he can make with those two opportunities.”

If he has not made much progress and could not face the various sects’ strong experts outside the tomb, he would show up to offer his help. He was certain that Jian Wushuang would beg him to take Jian Wushuang as his personal disciple.

“And if he is really talented. If his strength soars with the help of those two opportunities... I will definitely accept him as a personal disciple.”

There was a gleam of excitement in Crimson Stone Saint’s eyes.

“Jian Wushuang is a super genius. If he will become my personal disciple, he will definitely excel with his great potential. It will be a breeze for him to become an Ultimate God in the future. There is also a great chance of him becoming an Undying Saint. Once he is an Undying Saint, he would definitely be ranked highly among the Undying Saints, perhaps even stronger than the Purple Blood at his peak!”

“Such a strong expert would become Su Er’s right-hand man if he’s willing to sincerely help!”
