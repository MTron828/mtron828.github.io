Chapter 726: Underground Palace

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After cultivating up to the Third Level of the Star-river Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang immediately left the palace.

Outside of the palace, Gu Changfeng was still waiting quietly.

After seeing Jian Wushuang, Gu Changfeng asked, “How did it go?”

“I have made it to the Third Level,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“I knew it,” Gu Changfeng said and also revealed a smile.

“Gu Changfeng, I heard you talk to Gu Lan about the Underground Palace. What is that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Underground Palace is a place our tribe uses for honing the fighting skills of disciples. If you want to go there, I can guide you,” Gu Changfeng said.

“Alright. Lead the way,” Jian Wushuang said.

Gu Changfeng raised his eyebrows, then guided Jian Wushuang to the Underground Palace.

Under the guidance of Gu Changfeng, Jian Wushuang arrived at an empty loft with a passage that led to the underground.

Following the passage, Jian Wushuang quickly reached the Underground Palace.

The Underground Palace was actually a huge open space with a humongous gem shining at the top. Because of this gem, there was not much difference between being in the Underground Palace or being outside.

“Is this the Underground Palace?”Jian Wushuang asked while looking at the space, which had three different regions in the center.

These three regions were covered by three great Restrictions, in which only a few figures were visible.

Gu Changfeng explained, “The Underground Palace can only be used to hone fighting skills. While you train here, the opponents you face are the Puppet Fighters which were obtained by the Ancient God Clan while following the Ancient God many years ago.

“Those Puppet Fighters were specifically refined so they would be the most suitable opponents for honing fighting skills.

“The three regions of the Underground Palace represent three different tests, the Heaven Level Test, Earth-level Test, and Human Level Test!

“In the Human Level Test, the opponent is only one Puppet Fighter!

“However, the Earth-level Test has ten Puppet Fighters!

“As for the Heaven Level Test, there are 100 Puppet Fighters.

“And each test is divided into nine levels of difficulty.

“Every test has different levels of difficulty. So, even if you can defeat the ten Puppet Fighters in the first level of the Earth-level Test, that does not mean you can beat the 100 Puppet Fighters in the first level of the Heaven Level Test. The test is different, so the difficulty is different as well.

“The difficulty of these tests can be controlled by the challenger, so you can adjust it yourself.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Three regions, three different tests, all different in nature, and each test had nine levels of difficulty.

“Besides, those who fight in the Underground Palace can only rely on their own fighting skills, nothing else can be used. Of course, your swordsmanship can be used,” Gu Changfeng said, “but there is no sense in telling you so much about it. Pick a region and give it a try.”

“Ok,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded his head. After looking at the three regions in front of him, he didn’t hesitate and went directly towards the central region, where the Earth-level Test was.

As soon as he entered the Restriction, Jian Wushuang saw ten towering figures standing in front of him.

He chose to enter the Earth-level Test, so the opponents were obviously the ten Puppet Fighters.

”?Come on.?”

The Emperor Sword appeared in his hands and battle intent flickered in his eyes.

The ten Puppet Fighters also did not give him any time. As soon as Jian Wushuang appeared, the ten Puppet Fighters all began to move at the same time.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

The ten Puppet Fighters all used different weapons, so they were good at different aspects.

Some were good at offensive power, some were good at speed, and some were good at entanglement.

The ten Puppet Fighters instantly charged towards him and attacked at the same time.

Jian Wushuang also forwarded to the fight immediately with moving Emperor Sword in succession. But at the moment of the first movement, Jian Wushuang felt quite surprised.

”?There is no trace of the Dao?

“In the Underground Palace, it seems to be impossible to use the Dao. Does that mean it’s useless no matter how high one’s comprehension of the Dao is?”

Jian Wushuang immediately thought about it, but he quickly discovered that it was not just the Dao that couldn’t be used here, even his Sword Heart couldn’t be used in this fight.

He was also unable to perform the Star-river Secret Skill. The only thing he could depend on was his own swordsmanship.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The Emperor Sword in Jian Wushuangs hands was an Eternal Weapon, but its power also couldn’t be used at all. It was the same as fighting these Puppet Fighters while using an ordinary longsword.

“The power and speed of these Puppet Fighters is similar to mine, as are all the other aspects. The only difference is in fighting skill,”?Jian Wushuang thought while narrowing his eyes slightly. Now, he clearly understood the training in the Underground Palace.

The training in the Underground Palace was only aimed at their fighting skills.

Any Secret Skills or other methods of fighting were of no use at all.

And the strength of these Puppet Fighters was also the same as his, with the only difference being in their fighting skill.

These ten Puppet Fighters that Jian Wushuang was facing were at the First Level of difficulty, only possessing very average fighting skills. Although the power of the ten Puppet Fighters was no less than Jian Wushuang and the battle was ten against one, Jian Wushuang was still easily able to defeat all ten Puppet Fighters in a few moments.

”?The First Level of difficulty is no threat to me. Let me try the Second Level of difficulty!?”

Jian Wushuang used his mind to communicate with the ten Puppet Fighters, causing all ten Puppet Fighters to strike at Jian Wushuang again.

This time, the fighting skills of these ten Puppet Fighters were much better than they were a moment ago.

The fighting skills fo all the Puppet Fighters improved and they even teamed up against him. This time, even Jian Wushuang wasn’t able to win as easily as he had last time. However, he still succeeded while only depending on his swordsmanship.

Next was the Third Level of difficulty.

After reaching the Third Level, the fighting skills of these ten Puppet Fighters had been extremely brilliant. Jian Wushuang even felt that the fighting skills of these Puppet Fighters while at the Third Level was not weaker than Gu Changfeng. That’s to say, fighting these ten Puppet Fighters was like fighting ten Gu Changfengs that had joined forces to attack him.

Fortunately, since their strength was equal, Jian Wushuang was able to muddle through with his excellent swordsmanship. After a while, he finally defeated a Puppet Fighter after finding a flaw.

After he beat one of them, he was able to beat the rest of them, one by one.

Jian Wushuang succeeded in the Third Level of difficulty. However, on the Fourth Level, each of the ten Puppet Fighters had a dreadful level of fighting skills, not much less than Jian Wushuang’s. Once the ten Puppet Fighters joined hands, even though Jian Wushuang tried his best, he only managed to fight them for a while before he was defeated.
