Chapter 2472: Leaving Saint’s Tomb

Three days passed in a flash.

As the last wisp of Ancient God Realm divine power was absorbed by Jian Wushuang, the vast and endless Divine Power Ocean completely dried up.

The Divine Power Ocean was gone!

There was no Ancient God Realm divine power left.

Crimson Stone Saint was still standing there, but his complexion was extremely ugly.

He was heartbroken.

In order to create the Divine Power Ocean, he poured in almost all his wealth and also used quite a few tactics.

Even though Saint’s Tomb was opened many times in the past, the divine power remained abundant despite a large number of genius disciples entering the Divine Power Ocean every time to absorb divine powers.

However, the Divine Power Ocean had completely dried up solely because of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes once again and let out a long sigh.

“Unexpectedly, my divine power absorption and refinement speed have become the scariest skill I have after becoming a real Perfect Chaotic Creature. I only used three days to absorb such a vast Divine Power Ocean.” Jian Wushuang himself was quite surprised.

He knew his speed of absorbing the Ancient God Realm divine power would greatly increase after his breakthrough, but he had not expected it to be so fast.

He made another breakthrough as he refined all the Ancient God Realm divine power from the Divine Power Ocean and reached the level of a Second-Class Divine Demon!

In fact, the divine powers he had refined were more than enough for any ordinary cultivator to make a breakthrough all the way into the level of an Ultimate God or even an Undying Saint. However, he was only capable of advancing from Third-Class Divine Demon to Second-Class Divine Demon.

That showed just how much divine power his body was able to contain.

“I can absorb and refine divine power at such fast speeds. Does this mean as long as there are sufficient divine powers available, I can use them to improve my cultivation level?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

A breakthrough in cultivation level required the sufficient accumulation of divine powers and also a strong understanding of laws.

But for Jian Wushuang, his understanding regarding all aspects of the laws had met all the requirements. As long as he had sufficient divine powers, he could progress his cultivation level without worrying about foundation stability since he had a perfect foundation. Everything was perfectly coordinated with his own divine body. No matter how much divine power he absorbed and refined, it would not affect his foundation at all.

Then again, the divine power he needed for a breakthrough was too much. Advancing from Third-Class Divine Demon to Second-Class Divine Demon required him to absorb the entire Divine Power Ocean, hence he definitely needed much more divine powers to progress from Second-Class Divine Demon to First-Class Divine Demon.

It was not easy getting hold of so much divine power.

“Well, no hurry. I’ll go slow and steady.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang smiled before raising his head to look at Crimson Stone Saint who was in front of him. “Crimson Stone Saint, my apologies. I’ve accidentally absorbed your entire Divine Power Ocean.”

The corners of Crimson Stone Saint’s mouth twitched slightly, but he managed to reply through gritted teeth. “Well, it’s just some Ancient God Realm divine power. That’s nothing to me. Although I only exist in the form of consciousness, I can rebuild a Divine Power Ocean as long as I’m given enough time.”

“Oh.” Jian Wushuang raised his brows and was not surprised.

“I’ve absorbed the entire Divine Power Ocean and gained a lot of benefits here. The Saint’s Tomb no longer appeals to me. Crimson Stone Saint, send me out of here,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, the various sects’ experts seem to be waiting for you outside the tomb. If you go out now, those sects will not let you go. Do you need me to help you dismiss them?” said Crimson Stone Saint.

He only existed in the form of consciousness and no longer possessed any power. Nonetheless, he had some tricks up his sleeves left in the tomb and those tricks could affect the glade outside of Saint’s Tomb.

He was not bluffing when he offered to dismiss those various sects’ experts out there on the glade.

However, Jian Wushuang smiled politely and shook his head. “There’s no need for you to get involved. They are just a group of clowns. I can solve them by myself. Besides, I’ve just made a breakthrough and my powers have improved greatly, but I’m uncertain where my current combat power stands? Those various sects’ experts outside can allow me to test my capabilities.”

The Crimson Stone Saint raised his brows. “If those experts heard you, they might vomit blood in anger.”

Jian Wushuang smiled sinisterly. “Hehe. Let’s just send me out.”

Crimson Stone Saint did not hesitate and immediately waved his big hand. A spatial passage leading to the outside appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, remember what you have promised me. Otherwise...”

Crimson Stone Saint wanted to threaten Jian Wushuang but soon learned that he had no bargaining power.

“Don’t worry, I’ll do as I promised.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly before stepping into the spatial passage and quickly disappeared.

The spatial passage closed up after Jian Wushuang disappeared.

The Crimson Stone Saint was the only one left standing in the tomb.

Looking at the place where Jian Wushuang disappeared, Crimson Stone Saint felt incredibly complicated. After a long time, he sighed. “Su’er, this is the only thing Father can do for you. I hope Jian Wushuang can fulfill his promise. All the best to both of you.”

Crimson Stone Saint soon returned to the independent space where he was and began his long slumber.

...

On the glade, outside Saint’s Tomb.

The various sects’ experts, including those genius disciples who were sent out by Crimson Stone Saint in advance, were still gathered there.

Those experts should have returned to their respective sects with their own genius disciples since their disciples have emerged from Saint’s Tomb.

However, no one left.

Many sects’ experts kept waiting.

Those sects’ experts wore extremely cold expressions with their eyes, giving away terrifying killing intent.

They were waiting for someone.

That person was Jian Wushuang!

Everyone was waiting for Jian Wushuang to come out of Saint’s Tomb.

“Second Elder, is there really no room for discussion with the Lord?” Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and several other Narcissus Island disciples gathered around Elder Linghe.

“The decision was made by the Lord after discussing with the other Elders and it had been announced to the various sects. Therefore, Jian Wushuang is no longer a disciple of Narcissus Island. After he comes out of the tomb, he no longer has anything to do with us no matter what he encounters.” Elder Linghe looked indifferent.

“Zhong Yi, don’t put Elder Linghe in a difficult situation. The decision has been made and there is no more room for change. Moreover, you saw that even the Will of Heaven Way cannot tolerate Jian Wushuang’s existence. How can Narcissus Island accommodate him?” Seventh Elder chipped in.
