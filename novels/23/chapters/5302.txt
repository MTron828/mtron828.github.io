Chapter 5301: End of Life

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang stared at his body intently. As long as his body was complete, he could return and rely on it for defense.

But there was still some way to go before his body reached perfection.

At least another ten years were needed.

However, he couldn’t wait any longer. If he continued like this, he faced the risk of falling into danger.

He might have to give up if that happened. He had put in so much effort, and now half of the treasures he exchanged for were thrown into the Universe Bronze Furnace. He felt unwilling!

Buzz!

Numerous cracks appeared on his divine body.

“I can’t care about that anymore!”

He decided to risk it all.

The damaged divine body and the incomplete physical body, he didn’t know what would happen when the two merged!

Jian Wushuang forcibly merged the two, regardless of their injuries, directly fusing them into one.

Perfect integration!

Well, it was originally his body. If they couldn’t merge, that would be strange.

The two shattered, devouring each other, merging!

“Phew! ”

Jian Wushuang let out a breath. The divine body was finally no longer damaged, but the physical body was not yet complete. He had merged the divine body with the origin source in the wrong order.

The reason why the physical body had to be separated was to prevent the inheritor’s will from being unable to withstand it.

A supreme physique was indestructible, but if the will perished, the person would be gone.

Jian Wushuang was unaware of this. Just as he breathed a sigh of relief, the flames that tempered the physical body descended from the sky, along with the origin source and divine body he had just merged.

The scorching sensation was hundreds of thousands of times hotter than the temperature inside the furnace.

In an instant, his divine body collapsed, and the origin source extinguished along with it.

Death came in a mere moment!

His willpower held up surprisingly well, not dissipating with a single blow. However, under the relentless tempering of the flames, he couldn’t withstand it for long.

“No!”

Jian Wushuang roared in anger, but his willpower seemed to defy his command, detaching itself from his entire body.

Transcendence!

There were two kinds.

One was transcendence on the level of spatial matter; once successful, it meant existence beyond the universe.

The other was death!

This time, Jian Wushuang clearly experienced transcendence through death.

The origin source depleted, divine body shattered, leaving only a corpse with no purpose.

His will gradually faded.

Before his eyes, scenes from his life replayed.

“Is this the end?”

Jian Wushuang dared not blink, unwilling to miss any of the scenes before him—everything he had once sworn to protect.

There were comrades, mentors, brothers, and the world he had wanted to safeguard.

After entering the Qishen Temple, he had forgotten these things, or perhaps actively abandoned them, because he aimed to tread the path of an Emperor. Traditionally, those who became Emperors should sever all ties to mundane matters.

Before his fall, he hadn’t expected that his recollections wouldn’t be about his path to becoming an Emperor but the precious things he had once possessed.

“Xuan Yi, Old Master, farewell!” Falling into the abyss!

His willpower completely collapsed.

In the outside world, Jian Wushuang had traversed for tens of thousands of years.

The time he spent cultivating was beyond calculation, with time itself accelerating.

In the realm of stars alone, he had practiced for countless billions of years.

Memories scattered, and at the moment of his fall, a fragment of his spirit drifted into the origin sea of the Qishen Universe.

Qishen Temple, the Sea of Origin.

Inside the Heart Sea Hall.

The recently returned Zhen Ling, with a slight investigation, discovered Jian Wushuangs fall.

He felt a glimmer of joy!

Jian Wushuang possessed the power of devouring. He had never understood whether it was an inheritance left behind by the original owner, obtained by this kid, or something he figured out himself.

Regardless of the possibilities, he didn’t want to see Jian Wushuang continue to grow stronger.

No matter how far he went, even if he became the Universe Master, he would eventually fall.

Why waste so many opportunities?

Although Zhen Ling didn’t like Jian Wushuang, he also felt regretful. The Ultimate Dao, the 10,000-fold divine body, and the supreme physical body were already achieved.

There was no need to go through the Nine Refinements. But now, he had fallen, and it was his own fault.

Such a genius, if he didn’t possess the power of devouring, Zhen Ling would have treated him specially, just like Hu Qing.

But in his opinion, Hu Qings potential was still not inferior to Jian

Wushuangs.

Hu Qings foundation was more solid due to the past life, and he cultivated the Dao of Enlightenment, which made him one of the most terrifying Emperors in the future, comparable to practitioners of Heart power.

Enlightenment, skilled in deduction.

Hu Qings divine body was not weak either. In the future, when the treasures of Qishen Temple rained down, his strength and deduction abilities would advance together.

When he became an Emperor, he would undoubtedly shine brightly.

Even if he couldn’t reach the peak, he would still be able to dominate in the realm of Emperors in the future.

Just like the former Sword Immortal, who became an invincible Emperor. Any foe would fall to just one of her sword strike.

Compared to these figures, Jian Wushuang was a strong individual who hadn’t risen yet.

His fall was also fate!

Inside the Heart Sea Hall, Zhen Ling waved his hand, and time stood still.

He wanted to see when Jian Wushuang had mastered the Extreme Dao.

A timeline unfolded, representing Jian Wushuangs life.

For those without transcendent time abilities, life was a straight line.

The scene changed.

In the Great Desolate Wilderness, Jian Wushuang stood alone, blocking the remnants of Emperors. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

On the Road of Immortal Bones, he was besieged by a massive army of

corpses.

At that time, he also saw Hu Qing!

Even witnessing Hu Qing’s awakening and his battle with the Perfected Nine Revolutions, time passed slowly until the moment Jian Wushuang awakened his Heart power.

“Hmm?”

Zhen Ling looked at a long sequence of timelines, but no matter how he dragged them, the scenes remained still.

However, along the timeline, there was a significant stretch where the images only began to move when it approached the end – scenes of several monks sacrificing themselves.

“What exactly happened here?”

Zhen Ling was shocked this time. He couldn’t see the events that took place in between.

Despite having a long timeline spanning billions of years, he couldn’t observe the intermediate events.

“Has Jian Wushuang transcended time?”

This was utterly impossible; a Grand Yan Immortal couldn’t escape the flow of time. Zhen Ling couldn’t believe it and didn’t want to believe it.

Even the Qishen Temple couldn’t escape the timeline; if someone truly escaped, they would have perished.

Only some treasures could achieve a limited detachment from the timeline, like within the Heart Sea Hall.

“No, this child cannot perish!”

Zhen Ling immediately stood up and personally manipulated the Heart Sea Hall. He collected Jian Wushuangs true spirit fragments and placed them in a small jade bottle.

Then he resumed his meditation in front of the chessboard. He mobilized the entire Cosmic Sea, unleashing the power of the Heart Sea Pavilion. With Jian Wushuangs true spirit fragments, he could trace that significant portion of the timeline to understand what had happened.

If Jian Wushuang had truly transcended time, he had to consider the possibility that Jian Wushuang was the reincarnation of a powerful being.

Considering his strength, it was entirely plausible. A Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal could rival an Emperor, possessing all-encompassing power.

His divine body was 5,000 times stronger than an Emperor’s, and his origin source was even more robust.

If that were the case, Zhen Ling would have to revise his opinion of Jian Wushuang.

He couldn’t suppress Jian Wushuang; he would have to show deference when the time came.

An existence that transcended time!

Such individuals were rare; not even the Qishen Temple had seen many of them.

A formidable figure!

Zhen Ling inhaled sharply, then accessed that portion of the timeline.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang had transcended time.

It was a beautiful expanse of stars!

Enchanting.
