Chapter 2166 Demon

At the Void near the edge of the battlefield, the Three Emperors World leaders stood there indifferently, despite the position they were in.“It is about time. The elixir should work now,” Kaiser Blood murmured.

“It should start now,” Lord Fen nodded.

Their eyes contained a hint of expectation.

At the centre of the battlefield.

“Hngh!” Abysmal Saint Master sneered and turned into a headless giant in an instant, surrounded by boundless darkness. The headless giant held a large black spear. Under the Abysmal Saint Master’s control, the black spear was thrown out.

Hong!

The Void had been pierced to form a large hole, and terrifying power was heading for it.

“Scram!” Abysmal Saint Masters’s opponent, the beast-like bald man Ling Zong, had turned into a real beast by now.

His eyes were bloodshot with frenzy as he held a battle-axe in his hands.

The battle-axe struck down with a swing as if he were about to split the heavens.

With a large bang, the black spear in the headless giant’s hands started to fall apart; a great portion of the giant was reduced to darkness.

“What?” Abysmal Saint Master was shocked. “His abilities have improved?”

From the beginning of the battle, both had already demonstrated their full capabilities and were on par in terms of power.

But now, Abysmal Saint Master could feel Ling Zong exerting greater pressure on him.

Without a doubt, Ling Zong’s power had risen compared to in the beginning.

Next…

“Die!” Die!” “Die!”

Ling Zong swung his axe again and again in frenzy. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The power from within the giant axe was rising as well.

Abysmal Saint Master’s face darkened and he did his best to block his attack, but he was struggling at every passing moment.

“What is happening?”

“He’s getting more terrifying!”

And it was not just him.

All the experts of the Eternal Chaotic World, including the Great Emperors, could feel their opponents getting stronger.

“What is happening?”

“Their powers are getting stronger, but not naturally. They must have used a treasure or elixir.”

“Damn it, that Great Emperor was getting whooped by me a moment ago. Now, he’s on par on me, perhaps even stronger!”

The battlefield was being riled up.

At the edge of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai, and Ancestor Tian Chen were watching.

The change in the strength of the Three Emperors World experts were all caught in their eyes.

“The strength of those experts has begun to improve?”

“Not only the Great Emperors, even the normal Sir Gods and Emperor Gods have improved significantly as well, what is going on?” Ancestor Tian Chen yelled.

“From the looks of it, they must have consumed some sort of elixir. But they are Almighty level experts, elixirs that can improve their powers in short periods of time are extremely rare, furthermore, it seems like they all consumed it?”

“But they did not consume any elixir in the battlefield,” Emperor Bai frowned.

“Something’s not right,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“What’s wrong?” Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen looked over.

“Their eyes, they seem to be losing their sanity, turning into demons,” Jian Wushuang said.

Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen immediately looked towards those experts and were stunned.

Indeed, they saw it as well.

The fighting power the experts were displaying was much more powerful than before, and it was not stopping. Yet the look in their eyes was increasingly menacing, obviously losing their sanity as their powers increased.

Many people had completely lost it and were slaughtering each other.

They could not differentiate friend from foe.

At the centre of the battlefield.

“Die!” A frenzied yell could be heard from far. A burly man whose eyes were completely red slashed his sword at the man beside him.

He was attacking a fellow Three Emperors World expert.

Pu!

Blood was spattered. The victims’s head flew straight off.

“This is…”

The two Eternal Chaotic World Sir Gods completely froze.

“They’re killing their own people, they’ve lost it!”

“Crazy!”

“Have they lost their minds?”

Indeed, many Three Emperors World experts on the battlefield had lost their minds.

They could not tell friend from foe, wantonly killing each other.

Some were holding on, but barely.

“What is happening to me?” The bald-headed man Ling Zong, as a Second Stage Great Emperor, was able to keep his consciousness intact, but not for long.

At that moment, he had the uncontrollable desire to slaughter everything in his path.

The more he fought the urge, the faster the elixir’s effects were stimulated.

His sanity was disappearing rapidly.

“Even a Second Stage Great Emperor cannot resist it?” Abysmal Saint Master stood in front of Ling Zong, his eyes displaying a trace of pity. “What a pitiful guy, your leaders simply do not care if you live or die.”

“AHHHHHH!”

A hysterical roar burst from Ling Zong’s mouth.

Second Stage Great Emperor Ling Zong had completely lost it. He swung his axe desperately towards Abysmal Saint Master.

Under this state of madness, Ling Zong’s abilities had improved significantly. His power was nearing pinnacle Second Stage.

“Die!” Die!” “Die!”

Crazy roars kept echoing around the battlefield.

If even Second Stage Great Emperor Ling Zong had lost it, one could only imagine the other Three Emperors World experts.

A terrifying slaughter was about to begin.
