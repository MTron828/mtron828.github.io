Chapter 2039 Failed

The Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World immediately thought of a way to recover the golden whirlpool.

The golden whirlpool viewed the Emperor Supreme Rock as its core. As long as the Emperor Supreme Rock wasn’t destroyed, the golden whirlpool could be recovered.

On top of that, although Jian Wushuang had tried his best to destroy the golden whirlpool, he hadn’t hurt the foundation of the golden whirlpool. As the Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World worked together, they only took a few days time to repair the entire golden whirlpool.

The huge golden whirlpool resumed its calmness entirely and only the divine power and aura remained. They continued to fill every corner in the golden whirlpool.

After the golden whirlpool was repaired, the Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World searched through the place thoroughly once again, but it was a pity that they couldn’t find any of Jian Wushuang’s treasure.

They were helpless about it.

The golden whirlpool drove the dark millstone and they were connected via spacetime. When the terrifying energy storm took place, it had possibly swept Jian Wushuang’s treasure to the dark millstone via the spacetime. The Great Emperors couldn’t do anything about it.

Imperial Peak slowly calmed down.

Of course, everything that happened there was reported to the three overlords in the dark void at the first instant.

Leng Ruxue, Demon King (the savage man), the blurry bloodman, gathered together.

“Jian Wushuang is finally dead,” the blurry bloodman said.

“Humph, this b*stard made some trouble for us before he died,” Demon King humphed coldly.

“Regardless, Jian Wushuang had died and Great Emperor Zhi Luo died too. With Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao, who were still in Three-Emperors World, they wouldn’t be able to do anything much. Next, we shall only concentrate on fighting against the Eternal Chaotic World,” the blurry blood man said.

“Mm, the people Sanctuary Alliance have found out that the four-members’ experts troop failed and couldn’t be resolved from within. They will definitely gather countless forces of countless experts to fight head-on. They will try to destroy our great formation. However, as long as the Emperor Supreme Rock remains intact, the great formation will be indestructible. They are destined to fail,” Demon King smiled maliciously.

“That’s a definite. For this great formation, for this dark millstone, we prepared ourselves over so many years. How could they destroy it just like that? Eternal Chaotic World must be exterminated!” The blurry blood man clenched his hands and the fire in his empty eyes was burning.

Demon King was equally confident.

Only Leng Ruxue sat there without making any comment.

But if one looked closely, they would notice that her expression was complicated.

“Jian Wushuang, you died in the end?”

“Hehe, I thought you’d be able to survive until the end and appear before me.”

“It seems that you are only so-so.”

Leng Ruxue smirked coldly and she quickly resumed calm.

…

In the void far away from Imperial City in Three-Emperors World.

There were two figures that hid there with their auras reined in.

The two people were naturally Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao, who had escaped from Imperial Peak. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“There is no response from the communication token of Sword Emperor and Great Emperor Zhi Luo. It seems that…” Abysmal Saint Master looked distressed.

Emperor Jiu Qiao became quiet too.

After they escaped from Imperial Peak, they immediately kept in touch with Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo. Besides Jian Wushuang, who had sent a message in the beginning, there was no other news after.

It meant that…

“They passed away,” Emperor God Jiu Qiao sighed. He felt heartache, but he also felt very helpless.

He was really helpless.

In the situation back then, he and Abysmal Saint Master could only escape. Then, Eternal Chaotic World would at least keep two more people with the fighting power of a Great Emperor.

If they were to stay there, there was no doubt that they would die. There was no possibility of survival. Plus, they wouldn’t be able to help Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

One could say that the two of them had made the wisest and most accurate decision possible.

Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo knew that clearly. Hence, they had no complaints. On the contrary, they were glad that they had managed to escape. At least, not all members in the experts troop were dead then.

“Sword Emperor and Zhi Luo passed away. There are only you and I left. What should we do next? Do we continue to think about how to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock?” Emperor Jiu Qiao looked at Abysmal Saint Master. He wasn’t confident at all.

When the four of them were in their prime, they were well-prepared and they picked the best time. They had never thought that they would fall perfectly into the enemy’s trap.

Then, two out of four of them passed away. They couldn’t be entering Imperial Peak, just the two of them.

Forget about the fact that they were in Great Emperor realm. Even if they were to enter by sheer luck, it would be impossible for them to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock.

“Don’t act hastily. Didn’t Jian Wushuang tell the two of us to stay put in Three-Emperors World before he passed away? Let’s find a place to hide. Then, we will report what happened to Sanctuary Alliance,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded faintly.

…

In the lofty palace in the void around the dark millstone in Eternal Chaotic World.

The higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance were gathered there. Then, the Great Emperors looked to be in distress and they kept quiet.

They had heard from Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger that the experts troop that entered dark millstone fell into the enemy’s trap and they were besieged by thirteen Great Emperors. On top of that, Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo had passed away. There were only Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao who had escaped.

“The Emperor Supreme Rock is located right in the middle. There are too many experts there. The four-member expert troop spent so much time and effort but they failed. It means that it will be impossible for Sanctuary Alliance to destroy the great formation from inside of the dark millstone. Hence, we can only fight head-on,” Emperor Bai’s cold voice reverberated and broke the silence in the hall.

The Great Emperors looked at Emperor Bai simultaneously.

“For the past twenty years, under the guidance of Sanctuary Alliance, Eternal Chaotic World has started preparation. It isn’t easy to gather all peak fighting power in a short time. We have to speed up, especially in terms of the special tribes,’ Emperor Bai said.

The Great Emperors nodded.

“Jiu Qiao, stay back in Three-Emperors World with Abysmal. Find a place to hide. Who knows? The two of you might come in handy again,” Emperor Bai commanded.

“Yes,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded.

“Alright, go get ready,” Emperor Bai waved.

From the beginning until the end, he didn’t bring up the passing of Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo, nor did he comment much.

Although the surrounding Great Emperors were confused, they didn’t ask but left.

However, Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger stayed back.
