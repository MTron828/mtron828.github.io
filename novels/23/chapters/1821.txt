“Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun.”

Jian Wushuang looked around, “Before the news of Master of Star Palace’s death breaks out, we shouldn’t disclose the news of me being the new Palace Master. In front of the elderlies, continue to call me Hall Master Wushuang, just like before. We shall hide this news for as long as possible.”

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan and the other Hall Masters nodded politely.

“Besides, I have an idea. I’m not sure if it is workable,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Idea?” The three of them looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Hall Master Yuan, according to what you said earlier, Lineage of Star has a lot of enemies. Once the news about Palace Master’s death spreads, the enemies will flood in. If so, instead of waiting for them to attack, why not we try our best to exterminate all the enemies before the news spreads.” Jian Wushuang’s gaze grew cold.

“You mean, strike first and gain the upper hand?” Hall Master Yuan was stunned.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Anyway, after the news spreads, they’ll definitely attack us. Why don’t we seize the time when everyone thinks Master of Star Palace is still alive and ride on the deterrent force as we figure out ways to exterminate them first. Even if we can’t kill them all, we can at least take off part of the pressure when they charge at us in the future.”

“Plus, these people were Lineage of Star’s enemies anyway. We of Lineage of Star could kill them and it would be fair and reasonable.”

“That’s true,” Hall Master Yuan’s eyes glowed with joy. “If we kill them one by one during normal times, there is no guarantee that they would hold back their attacks as they would involve other innocent people (to refrain from shooting at the rat for fear of breaking the vases). In the end, they might unite to fight against Lineage of Star. But at this point in time, as they are going to attack us anyway, so we shall take action first and exterminate as many as possible.”

“Desperate times call for desperate measures,” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold.

“Hall Master Yuan, I shall assign this to you. Those major forces, we shall not take them into consideration now. We want to first deal with those solo experts. Figure out a way to find out the location of all of the solo experts that harbor hatred against Lineage of Star. If Lineage of Star can’t find out the information, bring sufficient rewards and ask Vientiane Tower to do it. In this life and death situation, we shouldn’t be stingy. Take out everything Lineage of Star has, this must be done quickly!”

“After we find out their locations, I will exterminate the Almighties personally. As for Real Gods, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun, please take care of them.”

“No problem.”

“Yes, Palace Master.”

Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun nodded heavily.

“Hall Masters, let me remind you again. Lineage of Star is on the brink of life and death. Hence, you must be extremely careful in your actions,” Jian Wushuang looked at the three Hall Masters then he waved.

“Go ahead!”

The three Hall Masters then immediately left.

In the hall, Jian Wushuang sat alone and his gaze was unusually cold.

“I never expected Lineage of Star to have so many hidden dangers. Master of Star Palace alone carried so much pressure. He was an amazing man!”

“But now, Master of Star Palace has passed away. As I have become the new Palace Master, this pressure will be on me. As long as I am alive, no one can lay a finger on Lineage of Star!”

…

Lineage of Star really paid a great price.

They gave Vientiane Tower a great reward. With the bountiful reward, Vientiane Tower had activated the information gathering mechanism. They then found the solo experts that harbored great resentment against Lineage of Star.

Very soon, a list of solo experts was presented to Jian Wushuang.

“Palace Master, these are the experts who have harbored deep-seated hatred against Lineage of Star over the years and they will definitely pound at Lineage of Star the moment the news about Master of Star Palace’s death spreads. There is a total of sixteen of them,” Hall Master Yuan said politely.

“Sixteen? So many?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“The list doesn’t stop there,” Hall Master Yuan shook his head and said. “These sixteen solo experts were only those that Vientiane Tower found for now. There are some that disappeared long ago. No one knows if they are dead or alive. It is rather difficult to find them.”

Jian Wushuang sighed. Lineage of Star really had many enemies.

Of course, not only Lineage of Star. Any major forces who stood in Eternal Chaotic World for so many years would have many enemies. Lineage of Star had many enemies because the Master of Star Palace had once used the Secret Skill of Star Palace to massacre wantonly.

“Sixteen experts made up of fourteen Sir Gods and two Emperor Gods,” Jian Wushuang said. “I shall move now to kill the experts.”

“Palace Master, please be careful on the way,” Hall Master Yuan exhorted. Jian Wushuang had then replaced the Master of Star Palace and became the new mainstay of Lineage of Star.

The mainstay definitely couldn’t afford to collapse. Otherwise, Lineage of Star would definitely be destroyed and there would be no space for struggle.

“I will.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and prepared to set off.

Of course, he brought Jian Yi with him when he departed.

With his power and existence of Jian Yi, when they looked for the people on the list one by one, there was almost no one who could escape if there weren’t any unexpected events. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The first target, Sir God Xing Xiang!”

“He is the nearest to Lineage of Star. He is in Red Dragon Sanctuary in the ten sanctuaries!”

Rumble.

The ancient silver spaceship traveled from Universe Galaxy in Lineage of Star at a terrifying speed and sped forward.

…

Red Dragon Sanctuary was engulfed in a huge ancient forest. There was a lofty black castle.

The black castle was huge and it covered an expanse of about a few million miles.

Such a huge castle had more than one hundred thousand maidservants and footmen.

At that moment, in the middle of the black castle, there was a banquet. At the banquet, there were a few hundred beautiful concubines dancing and serving.

The main character of the banquet was an overbearing bearded man in black armor. The man was Sir God Xing Xiang. He had become a famous top expert many years ago. Although he couldn’t be listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, he was extremely close to it.

Besides Sir God Xing Xiang, there were another two Sir Gods at the banquet. The two Sir Gods’ auras weren’t any weaker than Sir God Xing Xiang’s.

Rumble. A huge silver spaceship appeared in the void before the castle. A young man carrying a sword stepped out of the spaceship.

The moment he appeared, he swept out with his soul power. He looked at everything in the castle below.

“Mm, Sir God Cang Yu and Sir God Qi Sha are here too?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows as an imposing aura soared from his eyes.

“I don’t care about them. Whoever blocks my way, I will kill them altogether!”
