4209 Wu Hai

“I didn’t expect that. I’ve still underestimated this person. However, this Blood Sword should have reached this point. Wu Hai is ranked 518th. If this Blood Sword encounters Wu Hai, he will definitely not have an easy time.” The other Ultimate Ruler of the Wandering Cultivator Alliance snickered.

However, in the time it took for everyone to discuss, Jian Wushuang’s ranking had suddenly surpassed Ruler Qing Lin’s and reached an even higher position.

…

The first city, inside the city.

“Thanks for letting me win.”

Jian Wushuang said expressionlessly and then continued to walk toward the palace.

From the beginning to the end, Jian Wushuang had only used one finger.

No matter what kind of Ultimate Ruler he was, Jian Wushuang could crush him with just one finger and boundless divine power.

As time passed, Jian Wushuang’s ranking rose sharply. In just a few minutes, he had reached the 519th place.

The next one was Ruler Wu Hai, who had recruited Jian Wushuang before.

With a calm expression, Jian Wushuang walked to the door of the palace with the number ‘518’ and knocked on it.

Immediately after that, Ruler Wu Hai walked out.

“Eh? It’s you?”

When Ruler Wu Hai saw Jian Wushuang, he was startled. Then, an uncertain look flashed across his face.

He was no fool. Otherwise, he would not have killed so many new disciples at the first city’s city gates and never met with any trouble.

The fact that Jian Wushuang could reach this position naturally meant that Jian Wushuang’s strength was far beyond his imagination.

“Blood Sword, I didn’t think you’d be able to reach this position. No wonder you weren’t willing to join us back then.” A kind smile appeared on Ruler Wu Hai’s face again. Combined with his honest and chubby face, he looked rather harmless.

Jian Wushuang sneered in his heart. This person was a smiling tiger. He looked honest and kind, but in fact, he might have some bad tricks up his sleeve.

“Let’s start, Ruler Wu Hai,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Blood Sword, I don’t think we need to fight. I’ve used all my strength to climb to this position, but you look so relaxed. I know my own limits, I’m not your match.” Ruler Wu Hai scratched his head and smiled honestly.

“Oh? Are you serious?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said with a faint smile.

“That’s for sure. Sir Blood Sword, I’ve stayed on the ancient path of stars for so long. I may not have learned much, but I’ve cultivated a pair of good eyes. In the future, Sir Blood Sword will definitely become a dragon-like figure in the sky. I don’t need to make a fool of myself, I’m willing to admit defeat.” Ruler Wu Hai said with a smile.

After saying that, he turned around and walked toward the palaces behind Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s deep eyes no longer cared about him and he continued to walk toward the top palace.

At this moment, a sudden change occurred!

Ruler Wu Hai turned around abruptly. The kind smile on his chubby face turned into a brutal and murderous look. He took out a pitch-black banner with his right hand and charged at Jian Wushuang.

In an instant, a terrifying black mist gushed out and transformed into a huge mouth that slashed at Jian Wushuang’s head with the howls of evil spirits from the netherworld!

As for Jian Wushuang, he continued to walk forward as if he had not noticed the terrifying killing intent behind him.

Seeing that, Ruler Wu Hai revealed a fierce smile.

He could already imagine the scene of Jian Wushuang’s divine body being torn apart by the evil ghost in the banner.

“Blood Sword, go to hell!!!” Ruler Wu Hai’s face was extremely ferocious.

However, he did not realize that a cold sword light had already shot out from Jian Wushuang’s fingertips and was coming for him.

Chi!

Without any obstruction, the cold sword light cut through the black mist as if it was a knife cutting through tofu and pierced through the space between Wu Hai’s eyebrows. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In an instant, the overbearing and sharp sword intent directly destroyed every inch of divine power in Wu Hai’s divine body.

Before his death, Ruler Wu Hai was still wearing a proud and fierce smile.

Jian Wushuang did not turn back, he did not even stop. His black hair rose slightly as he continued to walk forward.

…

Outside the city gates, the many Ultimate Rulers were watching unblinkingly.

“It’s going to be Ruler Wu Hai’s turn soon. Wu Hai has always been cunning and cruel. He’s not an easy character to deal with. I wonder if Blood Sword can get through this safely.”

The Ultimate Rulers were all casually discussing this matter.

At this moment, they no longer had any teasing expressions on their faces.

Everyone could tell that although the Blood Sword was only at the fifth level, his battle-power was definitely one of the most terrifying geniuses among Rulers.

Hence, they started to look forward to Jian Wushuang. They were looking forward to seeing how far Jian Wushuang could go.

After all, if they could witness the rise of a heaven’s favorite, it would be a great story in the future.

Outside the city gate, only those from the Wandering Cultivator Alliance had ugly expressions.

“Hmph, who do they think the Blood Sword is? Was he the Third Prince of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom or the Young Emperor of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom? Or the divine sons and holy sons from the ancient holy lands and immortal inheritances? And the rise of a heaven’s favorite? Isn’t that too much of a legend?” One of the Rulers of the Wandering Cultivator Alliance said sourly.

As their leader, they naturally had to support Wu Hai. In return, they tried their best to belittle Jian Wushuang.

“Guys, look! The Blood Sword’s ranking has stopped!”

As expected, as if to verify their guess, Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped when he rose to the 529th place.

“Hahaha. I knew it. How could this Blood Sword be a match for Ruler Wu Hai?”

The Wandering Cultivator Ruler who had belittled Jian Wushuang earlier burst into laughter.

However, before he could finish laughing, it was as if his throat was suddenly grabbed by someone. His arrogant and proud laughter came to an abrupt end, and his face turned into the color of pig liver.

A burst of golden light flickered on the stele. The name that belonged to Wu Hai was slowly wiped away by an invisible hand.

“Wu Hai. He was defeated by that kid?” The Ruler called out in disbelief.

“He didn’t lose, he died.”

An Ultimate Ruler not far from him shook his head, his eyes shining.

As people who had been on the ancient path of stars for many years, they could naturally see the difference between defeat and death.

If it was just a defeat, then other than the Ruler at the bottom of the stone stele, who would be driven out of the city, the others would only drop one rank.

And if one died inside, the name belonging to that person would be directly erased!

“Die…he’s dead?”

When the people from the Wandering Cultivator Alliance heard this, they were terrified to the extreme.
