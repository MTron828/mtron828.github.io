Chapter 5287 - 5287: Dragon-Lock Veins

Translator: Endlessæantasy Translation            Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The flow within the Demon-Sealing Pillar was incredibly slow.

Meanwhile, on the Demon Sound Mountain in the outside world, tier 4 Emperors had reached halfway up the mountain, facing off against Shan Jun’s avatars.

Hundreds of tier 4 Emperors confronted hundreds of avatars, and the closer these avatars were to the mountaintop, the stronger they became. The battle between the two sides was exceptionally fierce.

However, Shan Jun’s main body, bound within the Demon-Sealing Pillar, paid no attention. His sole concern was Jian Wushuangs trial within the trial tower.

He was completely indifferent to everything else, to the extent that he ignored the deaths of many of his avatars.

Inside the trial tower, Jian Wushuangs figure swayed on the chains. He looked tiny compared to the colossal lava beasts.

“Phew! ”

Stepping onto the altar once again, he felt a sense of relief. The sacrificial ritual proceeded as usual. However, this time, he felt more composed.

As the ritual concluded and his physical body entered the large cauldron, Jian Wushuang began to feel excited. Regardless of what treasures the old man with the white beard might bring out, this time, he was determined to sacrifice his physical body, nothing else.

“Are you sure you want to sacrifice your physical body, young man!”

Jian Wushuangs face remained steadfast. Just as he was about to confirm again, a steady voice echoed in his ears.

“Choose the silver lock!”

“What?”

This voice?

It was very familiar—it was Shan Jun from the bronze furnace!

“How can this be?!”

Jian Wushuangs eyes narrowed as Shan Jun’s voice came again, revealing the secrets of the second level to him.

It turned out that the three locks in the white-bearded man’s hands were a kind of treasure. The golden lock he had obtained earlier was just one of them. Used individually, the benefits were minimal, but when the three locks were combined, the gains were immense.

At that point, his physical strength would increase by a level. Then, when he sacrificed his body again, choosing the body, he would obtain two identical bodies. With the two combined and refined in the Universe Bronze Furnace, earth-shattering changes would occur.

“l choose the silver lock!” Jian Wushuang quickly changed his choice.

He only half-believed Shan Jun’s words; after all, it was just a hundred years. Even if Shan Jun was deceiving him, he wouldn’t suffer much.

The white-bearded old man raised an eyebrow, looking somewhat displeased, gazing above the altar.

But since Jian Wushuang had already made a choice, he couldn’t say anything. He just deviated from his usual demeanor, snorted coldly, and tossed the silver lock to Jian Wushuang.

The first time was the golden lock, the second time the silver lock, the third time the bronze lock, and only the fourth time was the body.

Jian Wushuang looked at the chains beneath his feet; his journey was still long. Fortunately, his mental fortitude was strong; otherwise, he would have gone insane.

However, one thing surprised him: the first time took a hundred years, but the second time didn’t take as long.

The third one was even longer!

This was related to his physical ascent.

However, his 10,000-fold divine body relied on external objects for enhancement and couldn’t be maintained for too long.

If only his basic divine body could be 10,000-fold, that would be great.

Half of his origin power was concentrated in his divine body, leaving the rest to temper his physical body.

This pressure constantly tormented Jian Wushuangs will.

Finally, he gathered three locks, and he felt considerably weakened!

“Shan Jun didn’t deceive me after all!”

Three giant dragons inside him roamed through his meridians, making his body tens of times stronger than before,

If he had chosen the physical body the first time, he would have only gained an initial body. If the two overlapped now, it would far surpass anything before, increasing by hundreds of times. “Do you choose the physical body?”

The fourth time!

Before Jian Wushuang could speak, the white-bearded old man asked the question first.

“Yes!” Jian Wushuangs heart stirred, feeling uneasy. This old man seemed less and less like a good person.

Could he be plotting against him?

“Humph!” The white-haired old man snorted.

“Young man, some people’s words shouldn’t be listened to too much. It’s not good to walk a narrow path!”

After leaving these words, the white-bearded old man disappeared.

Only a physical body remained.

And when Jian Wushuang was sent away again, he once again condensed a new physical body.

Two bodies, identical in every way, as if replicated.

Their strength was also equal!

Upon exiting the trial tower, Jian Wushuang found it hard to believe.

The bodies he had obtained before were lifeless or just simple shells.

But he hadn’t expected that these bodies could contain a divine form and an origin source, essentially becoming another divine body for him.

“Greetings, my lord!”

“Greetings, my clone!”

They clasped hands, their smiles mirroring each other.

If it weren’t for his own knowledge, he wouldn’t have been able to tell which one was his true self and which was the clone.

With a thought, they instantly distanced themselves and then clenched their fists, striking with all their might!

Boom!

A close-quarters brawl!

Their fists roared, clashing for hundreds of moves in succession.

Huff!

After separating again, Jian Wushuangs main body nodded.

“Perfect strength!’

The power of each punch was comparable to that of a half-step Emperor.

With the 10,000-fold divine body and the physical body combined, he could match a half-step Emperor.

If he added the origin source, his combat power would be even stronger.

Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing wouldn’t be his match.

In fact, he had chosen the physical body in the beginning for a reason: the Beast God Weapon!

Once the Beast God’s Weapon merged, his Beast God Domain would become even stronger. By then, he would surpass the 10,000-fold divine body.

If his physical body couldn’t bear the strain, it would severely affect his divine body.

He had already planned his future path.

The invincible origin source made him stronger than anyone else; the existence of the Extreme Dao alone was enough to dominate his peers.

What remained was the path of the divine body.

With the Beast God Weapon, the ‘Candle Dragon’, his spatial origin source would be more effective, corresponding to future realm advancements.

The second feature was the enhancement of the divine body.

Any Beast God Weapon on Si Tian would be his, no matter the cost. He had to obtain them.

Once the three merged, once the old man with goat horns successfully refined it for him, once the spatial origin source was reassembled, his Beast God Domain would reach a new level.

At that time, when fully unleashed, his divine body would break through the 10,000-fold limit.

This was the path he intended to tread.

Swoosh!

A black mist emanated from the Universe Bronze Furnace, transforming into

Shan Jun.

“Not bad, perfect Dragon-Lock Veins, and there are two pairs!”

Shan Jun smiled, thoroughly satisfied as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang didn’t have time to ponder; he immediately bowed!

This time, Shan Jun had done him a great favor, comparable to a unique stroke of luck. Without Shan Jun, this trial wouldn’t have ended so successfully.

Shan Jun smiled, saying, “You don’t need to thank me. As I said before, this is what you deserve.”

“Without Senior’s guidance, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have obtained such perfect veins,” Jian Wushuang said sincerely.

Jian Wushuang!

Although his mindset had undergone a sudden change, he could still recognize those who had been kind to him. This karmic bond, regardless of what happened in the future, he would repay when given the chance.

“Oh, I should remind you, after the first three basic trials, for the following six trials, you might remain inside the trial tower continuously.. Be well-prepared!”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
