“What exactly is this token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy?” Jian Wushuang asked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy is by Sanctuary Alliance. Jian Wushuang, do you know about Sanctuary Alliance?” Real God Wu Liang looked at him.

Jian Wushuang shook his head subconsciously.

“Sanctuary Alliance was actually formed by the ten cultivation sanctuaries altogether!”

“There are many forces among the ten cultivation sanctuaries, including many top experts, are members of Sanctuary Alliance. Even some of the Holy Kingdoms outside of Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries could join Sanctuary Alliance once they reached the criteria. For instance, Lineage of Star, Soaring Heaven King Palace, Four Symbol Mansion are all under Sanctuary Alliance,” Real God Wu Liang said.

Jian Wushuang was astonished when he heard that.

“Sanctuary Alliance was formed by the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, many forces, and experts? Just how strong is Sanctuary Alliance then?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Strong? Hehe. Sanctuary Alliance isn’t something that could be described with the word ‘strong’. It’s supreme!” Real God Wu Liang said, “In Eternal Chaotic World, Sanctuary Alliance rules.”

Jian Wushuang could imagine all the top experts in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries united with the great forces, it was naturally the most powerful force in Eternal Chaotic World.

“I’m curious. Why would the great forces and experts in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries come together and form an alliance?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“This is related to some hidden secret in Eternal Chaotic World. I don’t know much about it but I heard that it seems to be about the Eight Lairs. There are some potential enemies in Eight Lair and the ten sanctuaries have to team up to fight against it,” Real God Wu Liang explained.

“Is that so?” It made sense to Jian Wushuang.

Under normal circumstances, the top experts and forces in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries definitely wouldn’t team up.

However, when they shared the same enemy, that would be a different story.

“Sanctuary Alliance’s lair is on Thunderbolt Island. There is a large number of top experts in Thunderbolt Island all year round. At the same time, there are huge opportunities and comprehension venues too. Among them, the most famous would be Fairy Palace!” Real God Wu Liang continued.

“On Thunderbolt Island, there are thirteen Fairy Palaces. The thirteen Fairy Palaces correspond to the Four Supreme Doctrine and Nine Heaven God Doctrine respectively. To comprehend the doctrine accordingly in the Fairy Palace, not only would one yield twice the result with half the effort, but the result will also be far beyond your imagination.”

“Like Real God Hall in Lineage of Star, it was built by Palace Master himself. Similarly, it helps to comprehend doctrines greatly, especially for a Universe God. It is enormously helpful. At Real God level, there is still some help but it isn’t that great of a help anymore.”

“However, Fairy Palace in Sanctuary Alliance is built by the tops in Sanctuary Alliance. In other words, the Emperor-level superb existence in the ten sanctuaries teamed up, paid a great price and went to great effort to build them. Every Fairy Palace is a hundred times more valuable than Real God Hall, or maybe a thousand times. Hence, cultivating in Fairy Palace naturally brings about the effect of Real God Hall in a hundred, a thousand folds and above!”

Jian Wushuang looked astonished.

He didn’t know about the effect of comprehending in Fairy Palace but he knew Real God Hall well.

To comprehend doctrine in Real God Hall was much stronger than to comprehend doctrine alone blindly. Even then, Real God Hall was extremely helpful for him.

However, the comprehension effect in Fairy Palace was a hundred times stronger than in Real God Hall?

Maybe there was an exaggeration, but it also meant that Fairy Palace was a perfect place for comprehending doctrines.

“Fairy Palace is too helpful for a cultivator.”

“As such, countless experts fight to cultivate and comprehend in Fairy Palace. Sanctuary Alliance issued token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy in order to balance out the experts in all forces.”

“The token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy would be given out once every three hundred thousand years. Under normal circumstances, every time they give out, some forces in Sanctuary Alliance can get one token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. Some that are extremely strong, like Soaring Heaven King Palace, can even get two at once.”

“As for solo experts, according to their contribution for Sanctuary Alliance or the price that they pay, they might receive a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy.”

“In short, Sanctuary Alliance will give out a hundred tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy every three hundred thousand years. A token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy allows a cultivator to opt for one Fairy Palace and comprehend in it for a hundred years,” Real God Wu Liang said.

“A hundred tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy every three hundred thousand years? And it takes one token to stay in Fairy Palace for a hundred years?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

A hundred tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy didn’t seem like a small figure but compared to countless experts in the entire Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, it was very few.

Plus, every token only allowed them to comprehend for a hundred years in Fairy Palace. A hundred years was really short.

“Because there are very few tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, they’re very precious. Just like Lineage of Star, we only get one token every three hundred thousand years but there are so many experts in Lineage of Star who are dying to comprehend in Fairy Palace. How do we allocate the quota? Hence, every time when there’s a token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, Lineage of Star will elect a few people after repeated discussions. Then, Palace Master and the other two Hall Master will make a decision together,” Real God Wu Liang said.

Jian Wushuang heard and sighed with emotion.

Obviously, Lineage of Star attached great importance to the tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy as well.

“From the previous time when they issued tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, it has only been two hundred and forty years. In other words, it has to be another sixty thousand years until Lineage of Star obtains another token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. But now, Jian Wushuang, you’re so lucky. You killed Real God Shi Jue and got yourself one,” Real God Wu Liang complimented.

“Haha,’ Jian Wushuang laughed too.

He knew that he had found himself a treasure.

“In other words, I can go to Fairy Palace in Sanctuary Alliance to comprehend with this token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This… it’s hard to say. After all, you’re not a Real God yet. Sanctuary Alliance’s Thunderbolt Island had a threshold whereby one must be a Real God to enter. Not an ordinary Real God but one must be top Void Real God at least and extremely close to the level of an Eternal Real God.”

“Although your power has reached the criteria, you’re yet to reach the realm. I’m not certain if you can head to Thunderbolt Island. It’s best if you ask Hall Master Yuan yourself when we return,” Real God Wu Liang said.

“If so, let’s return now,” Jian Wushuang said.

Real God Wu Liang, Real God Fei Yan didn’t hesitate and quickly departed along with Jian Wushuang.

When they returned to Lineage of Star, the three of them immediately went to see Hall Master Yuan.

In the cave dwelling that was made of unique crystals.

“Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy?” Hall Master Yuan looked shocked.

Jian Wushuang spread his palm and took out the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy.
