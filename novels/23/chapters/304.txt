“Hum?” Jian Wushuang stopped and looked at Leng Rushuang.

“Elder Sister, why are you here?” Leng Ruxue asked while putting down the chicken leg.

Leng Rushuang ignored her sister and looked toward Jian Wushuang. “An expert of the Saint Realm has arrived. He should be here for you.”

“An expert of the Saint Realm? Here for me?”?Jian Wushuang frowned.?“Holy Emperor Palace?”

Jian Wushuang realized that Holy Emperor Palace would find him once he became famous in the Tang Dynasty.

After all, a Sword Principle Warrior who was in the Profound Yang Void Realm and could kill Man Yan, could only be him.

But he did not expect that Holy Emperor Palace would move so quickly.

The day after the news that he ranked 21st spread, experts from Holy Emperor Palace had arrived to kill him.

“I know the Saint Realm expert. He is Tan Feng and ranks 9th on the list. He has also mastered Domain. If he wants to kill you, you won’t have any chance to escape,” Leng Rushuang said coldly.

“Tan Feng?” Jian Wushuang recalled the introduction about Tan Feng in the Bloodmoon List. His face grew solemn. Then he looked toward Leng Rushuang and asked, “What do you want to say?”

“My sister likes playing around, but she’s too weak to protect herself. If I let her do whatever she wants in the Tang Dynasty, I’m afraid that she would be chased by someone like last time, so I’d like to hire a guard for her,” Leng Rushuang answered.

“You want me to be her guard?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Your strength is good. I think you’re qualified for this job. As long as you promise to be my sister’s guard for five years, I will help you kill the expert of the Saint Realm. Moreover, I can ensure that no one dares to challenge you. What do you think?” Leng Rushuang’s voice was still cold.

Upon hearing this, Leng Ruxue widened her eyes, expectantly staring at Jian Wushuang.

“Sorry, I refuse.” Jian Wushuang shook his head without even thinking.

He disliked hiding under someone else’s shelter. Therefore, even though Wang Yuan invited him, he did not go to the Alchemy School, let alone stay with Leng Ruxue for five years.

Even if it only took him five days or a few months, Jian Wushuang would not accept it.

“In that case, you will have to find your own way of dealing with Tan Feng,” Leng Rushuang said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I never depend on anyone,” Jian Wushuang replied coldly. Then he walked out of the yard.

Two people had been waiting there.

“Tai Shan, Mo Ying.” Jian Wushuang spoke seriously. “I’m leaving here. If there is an opportunity, I’ll come back. Please help me tell the other protectors.”

Then Jian Wushuang immediately left.

Tai Shan and Mo Ying were surprised and could not figure out why their first Protector left so abruptly.

Tan Feng immediately perceived that Jian Wushuang was trying to escape.

“He wants to run away,” Tan Feng said in a low voice.

“Sir, what are you waiting for? Go kill him.” The middle-aged young man spoke anxiously.

“No, wait a moment.” Tan Feng shook his head and stared in the direction of Leng Rushuang.

“She should know that I came for Swordsman. I don’t know what relationship Swordsman has with her. If I try to kill Swordsman, will she stop me?”?Tan Feng still had some concerns, because Leng Rushuang was much more powerful than him.

At this moment, he saw Leng Rushuang leave with Leng Ruxue.

“Hum?” Tan Feng raised his brows. “She didn’t come to stop me or give me any warnings. That means she won’t protect Swordsman.”

Tan Feng was immediately relieved. Then a blast of powerful aura spread out.

“Swordsman, I’m here. Where are you going? Do you think you can run away?”

A cold, loud voice resounded through the sky. Tan Feng suddenly rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

The voice shook the whole city.

“Who? Who wants to kill Protector Swordsman?”

Many experts of the Heartless Sect shot up into the sky. They immediately saw two figures moving in the distant sky.

One was Swordsman, and the other was a bald elder, who was exuding a roaring aura.

“The Saint Realm!”

“A real Saint Realm expert!”

“He is Tan Feng, ranked 9th on the Bloodmoon List. He is hunting Swordsman?”

A burst of exclamations went up throughout the city.

“What’s going on?”

The Master of Heartless Sect and the other Protectors gathered and watched it with a terrible look on their faces.

“He just killed Man Yan, now Tan Feng came.”

“Tan Feng is much stronger than Man Yan.”

The experts of Heartless Sect were anxious for Jian Wushuang, but they did not have the strength to step in, so they could do nothing.

Now, only Leng Rushuang could help Jian Wushuang, but she did not want to.

“Elder Sister, you really won’t save big brother?” Leng Ruxue asked pathetically.

“He didn’t want my help. Why should I save him?” Leng Rushuang replied coldly.

“But big brother helped me. I owe him a favor,” Leng Ruxue continued.

“That’s you, not me,” Leng Rushuang said.

“Elder Sister!” Leng Ruxue got angry.

“Fine, don’t worry about him,” Leng Rushuang glanced at her sister and said, “I know he is not ordinary. Tan Feng might be stronger than him, but it isn’t easy for him to kill your big brother.”

“Oh?” Leng Ruxue calmed herself down.

Jian Wushuang ran quickly, so he immediately reached outside of the city. He also perceived Tan Feng behind him. The bald elder moved forward, emanating waves which spread out over a radius of hundreds of meters.

“Domain!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

As for Origin Enlightenment, Momentum and Domain were totally different.

An expert who achieved Domain would be much more powerful than the one who only reached Momentum.

His father, Jian Nantian, only had Half-saint cultivation, but he could kill an expert of the Saint Realm with one stroke because he had reached Domain and controlled it very well.
