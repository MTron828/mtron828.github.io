2048 Demon King Chen Yu

“Mister Emperor Bai, what’s going on?”

“Yes, who destroyed the Emperor Supreme Rock?”

“Who would be so capable as to be able to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock in Three-Emperors World’s lair?”

The confused and curious gazes fixed upon Emperor Bai.

“The one who destroyed the Emperor Supreme Rock was Jian Wushuang,” Emperor Bai replied.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“How is that possible? Didn’t Jian Wushuang die? How could he destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock?”

“He didn’t die?”

The Great Emperors were shocked and they expressed their disbelief.

Emperor Bai explained, “Jian Wushuang didn’t die. As for the reason and process, it is inconvenient for me to tell you. In short, Jian Wushuang destroyed the Emperor Supreme Rock and the dark millstone stopped because of that. Jian Wushuang is in the Three-Emperors World and he is being chased after by a large bunch of experts from Three-Emperors World. Hence, Sanctuary Alliance has to send experts in to take him on immediately.”

“Mm, Sword Emperor destroyed the Emperor Supreme Rock. In short, he saved the entire Eternal Chaotic World. Now that he is being chased after. We, of course, have to go and get him,” Ancestor Tian Chen was the first to reply.

“It’s an obligation we won’t shirk!”

“We have to bring Jian Wushuang back.”

The other Great Emperors stood up one after another.

Although some of the Great Emperors had borne grudges against Jian Wushuang before, they would cast their personal resentment aside before their enemies.

Jian Wushuang had performed extraordinary deeds. As he was in danger, they, of course, had to go all-out to save him.

“I already got in touch with Jian Wushuang through Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger. He will come to this region at his fastest speed,” Emperor Bai waved and a huge constellation map appeared in the void in front of them.

Emperor Jiu Qiao drew the constellation map. It was the result of Emperor Jiu Qiao being in hiding in the Three-Emperors World for thirty years. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All God Mansions and regions in Three-Emperors World were recorded on the constellation map.

Emperor Bai pointed at the region called Bronze Heart. The Bronze Heart Region was located at the border of Three-Emperors World. Then, the dark millstone stopped and the surrounding great formation had already stopped spinning. The higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance could barge into Three-Emperors World directly. They could pierce the outer layer of the pavilion and reached Bronze Heart Region easily.

“Depart immediately. Rush there at your fastest speed,” Emperor Bai commanded.

“Understood,” the surrounding Great Emperors nodded simultaneously.

“Mister Emperor Bai, how about you? Are you going personally?” Red Dragon King suddenly looked at Emperor Bai.

“I have a more important task to do,” Emperor Bai replied.

The Great Emperors didn’t pursue further. Then, the original body of all Great Emperors gathered at their fastest speeds. Then, they departed to Three-Emperors World.

Emperor Bai watched the Great Emperors leave and his eyes were glistening in a strange way.

…

In Three-Emperors World.

Jian Wushuang rushed out of Imperial City and continued to plunge forward. He had been flying for more than half a day and he had passed many regions.

“Sword Emperor, Emperor Bai told me to inform you that everything is going according to plan,” Emperor Jiu Qiao sent a message over.

“Great,” Jian Wushuang smiled and he looked behind him.

The total of thirteen Great Emperors were following Ling Zong and the tall and sturdy middle-aged man’s lead, continuing to chase after him closely.

“These guys are so persistent!” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The thirteen Great Emperors wouldn’t be a threat to him.

However, Jian Wushuang knew that the thirteen Great Emperors definitely had another purpose in following behind him when they knew they could do nothing about him.

As expected, just as Jian Wushuang crossed into another region…

Dong! Dong! Dong!

There were heavy footsteps from the void in front. The footsteps were obviously from someone stomping on the void and rushing over.

The power of every single step was extremely powerful.

Jian Wushuang immediately lifted his head and realized that there was a two-meter-tall brawny man with bronze skin that appeared at the end of his sight.

The brawny man was muscular and had a mustache and beard. His hair was all over the place too. He looked just like a savage man.

As the savage man plunged over from the void in front. Every footstep shattered boundless void below his feet. There was a terrifying rage that spread from him. Even Jian Wushuang was shocked when he felt the rage approaching him.

“This person….”

Jian Wushuang stared at the savage man who was getting closer. His gut feeling told him that the person in front of him was very scary.

He was far scarier than the thirteen Great Emperors behind him combined.

However, the thirteen Great Emperors behind Jian Wushuang were thrilled when they saw him.

“It’s Demon King. Mister Demon King has come!”

“Haha, Mister Demon came personally. Jian Wushuang will be dead!!”

“Mister Demon King! How long has it been since we’ve see him descend personally?”

The Great Emperors looked at the savage man with boundless enthusiasm and worship. The same applied to Ling Zong.

“You, are you Jian Wushuang?”

The savage man spoke in a loud and bright voice. He stopped right in front of Jian Wushuang and looked down at Jian Wushuang with his cold gaze. His boundless might pressed onto Jian Wushuang at the first instant.

“Who are you?” Jian Wushuang’s face was solemn as he stared at the savage man in front.

“I am Chen Yu. You can also call me Demon King Chen Yu,” the savage man said coldly. “Jian Wushuang, I have heard things about you. I have to admit that you are truly a top genius. I’m afraid there aren’t many who have greater talent than you from the era I’m from.”

“But it’s a pity that you and I are not on the same side. So, I can only let you die.”

Demon King Chen Yu’s voice reverberated through the universe.

As Demon King Chen Yu spoke, he moved.

There was a great distance to get to Jian Wushuang but Demon King took a huge stride and he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he clenched his hand and a huge fist instantly broke the air. It brought about a boundless demonic cloud and broke everything in front of Jian Wushuang.

Then, it slashed at Jian Wushuang’s face.

“So fast!”

There was a flash of shock in Jian Wushuang’s eyes but he instantly recovered.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang humphed coldly and wielded his sword.

There was a unique sword intention that soared up. Then, Jian Wushuang turned into a huge whirlpool that swallowed everything.

Xuan Luo Sword Principle, Mixed Elements Spirit!

Bang!

There was a loud bang. The huge fist collided with Jian Wushuang’s sword light brutally. A terrifying power suddenly exploded.
