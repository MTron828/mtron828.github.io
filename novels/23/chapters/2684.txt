Chapter 2685: Chief Steward

“Let’s talk.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen smiled faintly.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen was obviously quite happy because of the Royal Blood Gem.

“I used to be the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord and have a maid in the Northern Darkstar Territory called Xiao Tiexin. She’s quite capable of managing resources. I was separated from her since the Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect put a bounty on my head. She’s probably still fleeing everywhere within the Northern Darkstar Territory. Can I ask Palace Keeper Si Zhen to send someone to pick her up and send her here to help me?” Jian Wushuang explained.

“This is simple. Just tell me where she is and I’ll immediately send someone to pick her up. It won’t take long,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

The Northern Darkstar Territory was a little far away from the Danyang Continent as it took Jian Wushuang nearly 40 years to arrive at the Danyang Continent.

The reason was that Jian Wushuang did not use the spatial passage to travel between the stellar regions. Palace Keeper Si Zhen naturally would not mind using the spatial passages, hence he could quickly travel back and forth between the Danyang Continent and the Northern Darkstar Territory.

“There’s a second matter,” said Jian Wushuang again. “I need some military formations or some type of special formations that can be used by a few people altogether.”

“Military formations? Special formations?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen frowned slightly. “What do you want these things for? Are you trying to form an Official Army?”

“Just let me handle this.” Jian Wushuang smiled mysteriously.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen shrugged and said, “The strongest military formation in Crimson Stone Fort is in the hands of the Crimson Stone Official Army and will never be passed on to anyone. Even if the Fort Master personally asks for it, she may not be able to get it from the Blood Thunder King. However, ordinary military formations and magic formations such as those military formations used by various stellar regions’ Official Army in Danyang Holy Domain—I can help you get them. I can also get some of those lower-level magic formations as well.”

“Those ordinary military formations and low-level magic formations are more than enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Official Army he was setting up was not ready yet, therefore some ordinary military and magic formations were good enough.

“Wait here for a while,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen before he turned and left.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen reappeared in front of Jian Wushuang after nearly half a day and handed an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Here are ten billion Primordial Stones and the military formations you asked for. I’ve already ordered someone to bring your maid here. She’ll be here in the Danyang Continent in less than ten days and I’ll send a message to tell you when that happens,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“Thanks a lot.” Jian Wushuang thanked him and left after taking the Interspatial Ring.

He did not return to the Sword Alliance but stayed in the Sacred Palace to wait quietly.

Eight days later...

Xiao Tiexin came to Jian Wushuang under the personal guidance of two Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Master!”

Xiao Tiexin looked extremely excited to see Jian Wushuang again.

“Xin’er, it’s been a long time since I last saw you.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and also noticed the divine power of Xiao Tiexin.

Xiao Tiexin was still the same as before—just a Primary-level Ultimate God. Xiao Tiexin’s strength had not improved at all after so many years.

Jian Wushuang could only secretly sigh.

Xiao Tiexin could be regarded as a genius, but she had used some taboo secret techniques which greatly damaged her foundation and limited her strength. It was becoming way too difficult for her to make a breakthrough after reaching the very top of the Primary-level Ultimate God realm.

Xiao Tiexin looked at Jian Wushuang again after a simple greeting. “Master, how far are you now in your cultivation realm? I think the two masters who came to pick me up before seem to be very powerful.”

“Of course they are powerful. They’re both Heaven Ultimate Gods after all.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Heaven Ultimate Gods?” Xiao Tiexin was shocked.

Heaven Ultimate Gods... In an ordinary stellar region, an Earth Ultimate God could become the Territorial Lord and be a respectable ruler. Heaven Ultimate Gods were simply out of her league to Xiao Tiexin.

However, her master could get two Heaven Ultimate Gods to pick her up in person!

How high was her master’s cultivation realm?

“Xin’er, come with me first. We’ll talk as we go.”

Jian Wushuang led Xiao Tiexin directly toward the Sword Alliance.

Jian Wushuang began to explain many things to Xiao Tiexin along the way.

Xiao Tiexin was shocked when she found out that Jian Wushuang had already created a powerful alliance with dozens of Heaven Ultimate Gods and was flattered when she knew Jian Wushuang’s purpose in bringing her back.

“It turns out Master brought me here to help him manage his large alliance.” Xiao Tiexin held her hands together in excitement.

It did not take long before they returned to the Sword Alliance.

Jian Wushuang immediately summoned Dong Xue, Hei Yan, Long Shan, and Zi Wang as soon as he arrived at Sword Alliance.

“Let me introduce my maid to you, this is Xin’er. All the resources and income from various Sword Alliance’s belongings including the many resources I have on hand will be handed over to her from today onward. You can look for her if you need any Primordial Stones or resources in the future. She’ll be the Chief Steward of the Sword Alliance.” Jian Wushuang glanced around at the four people.

The four people looked at each other and nodded their heads.

They kept stealing glances at Xiao Tiexin a few times in puzzlement.

All of them could see that Xiao Tiexin was just an ordinary Ultimate God—a Primary-level Ultimate God. She was extremely weak such that anyone from the Sword Alliance was much stronger than her. Why would a person like her be appointed as the Chief Steward of the Sword Alliance?

“It seems that the Alliance Master has a lot of trust in her,” muttered the four people secretly in their hearts.

It was indeed impossible for Xiao Tiexin to control all the resources within the Sword Alliance if Jian Wushuang had no absolute trust in her.

The most important matter for a force was wealth and resources. As long as the wealth and resources were sufficient, there would be a steady stream of powerful experts joining the force. That was the true lifeline of a force and generally, the person-in-charge was the one who controlled both wealth and resources.

“Even though Xin’er is not powerful, she has the full authority to represent me. Her orders will be mine from now on. You’ll be killed without mercy if you dare to violate her authority as the Chief Steward. Do you understand?” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Yes.” Dong Xue and the others nodded their heads and very humbly paid obeisance to Xin’er at the same time.

“Okay, all of you may go now.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and the four immediately left.

Jian Wushuang looked at Xiao Tiexin after they left. He smiled and asked, “Xin’er, how do you feel?”

“Somewhat excited.” Xiao Tiexin sighed. “Master, were those four people just now also Heaven Ultimate Gods?”

“Yes. However, they are your subordinates starting from today. You can order them at any time.” Jian Wushuang smiled.
