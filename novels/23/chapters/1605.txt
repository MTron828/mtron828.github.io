Chapter 1606: Not Interested

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Comprehension time? You can bet with that?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Of course. On Thunderbolt Island, as long as both parties are willing to, they can bet with anything. Not only the time to comprehend in Fairy Palace, but also the time to stay in Thunderbolt Island can be staked,” Real God Tian Ming smiled faintly and said, “So, how about it? Do you want to bet?”

“I’m sorry, I’m not interested,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Real God Tian Ming creased his eyebrows, “Jian Wushuang, although you’re a Universe God, you’re an inverse cultivator, which equals an ordinary Void Real God. I am also a Void Real God. So, it’s not like I’m bullying you if we were to battle. Why are you so afraid?”

“Not interested,” Jian Wushuang didn’t bother with Real God Tian Ming but turned to leave.

“Jian Wushuang!” Real God Tian Ming watched Jian Wushuang as he left and bellowed, “Back in Burning Demon Region, you massacred so many Real Gods from Four Symbol Mansion alone. Where’s your spirit? Unless, you only bully the weak? Are you that kind of person?”

But no matter what Real God Tian Ming said, Jian Wushuang ignored him. He quickly vanished from Real God Tian Ming’s sight.

“This young man can keep his composure,” Real God Tian Ming squinted his eyes, “I thought geniuses like him would definitely be arrogant and wouldn’t reject my challenge. Then, I would be able to get some more time to comprehend in Fairy Palace from him. In the end… well, he passed three inverse cultivation tests after all. His mental state must not be weak. Provocation wouldn’t work on him.”

“It seems like it’s impossible to force him to take action. I can only look for other ways.”

Very soon, Real God Tian Ming left too.

On Thunderbolt Island, Jian Wushuang walked around alone.

He was wearing a scornful smile, “Real God Tian Ming thought I would be provoked so simply? He said that I’m an inverse cultivator at Universe God level. So, it is fair to fight against him who is a Void Real God and he said that he wasn’t bullying me? He would be only able to scheme against a kid.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang sneered at the thought about Real God Tian Ming.

An inverse cultivator at Universe God level was truly treated as Void Real God in Eternal Chaotic World. There was nothing wrong about that.

But that only referred to one aspect, which was divine power. In terms of comprehension towards Heaven Way and unique skill, there was a vast difference between Real God and Universe God.

Especially comprehension towards doctrine.

After all, the comprehension power of a Real God toward Heaven Way was much stronger compared to Universe God. Hence, when a Real God comprehends Heaven Way, it was naturally much easier compared to a Universe God’s attempt.

With such a condition, Real God Tian Ming had the guts to say that he, who was a Void Real God asking for a battle with Jian Wushuang on Thunderbolt Island, wasn’t bullying him?

“Thunderbolt Island, a normal threshold requires one to possess the fighting power of an Eternal Real God. Real God Tian Ming appeared on Thunderbolt Island with his realm at Void Real God. He was definitely a top genius too. If I’m not mistaken, his comprehension of Heaven Way was at least at the passing of the third level in Doctrine Palace. As for a unique skill, it definitely was even more shocking. If I were to fight him now, eighty percent of the time I’d be at a disadvantage,” Jian Wu Shuang smiled faintly.

Hall Master Yuan exhorted that the opportunity to be on Thunderbolt Island was extremely hard to come by, especially the time to cultivate in Fairy Palace was even more precious.

Under the circumstance where Jian Wushuang wasn’t confident, he wouldn’t be that stupid to stake comprehension time with Real God Tian Ming.

Jian Wushuang flew forward slowly and he appeared above a huge mountain before long.

In the middle of the mountain, there was a vast, barren land. Jian Wushuang could see the towering steles on the barren land from above.

“This is the place where Elder Wu Liang said that there are countless unique skills?” Jian Wushuang was surprised and he immediately landed.

Among the countless steles, it was recorded with a unique skill on each stele.

Jian Wushuang came to the region of unique skills for swords and looked at one of the steles casually.

Jian Wushuang immediately saw the stele contained an image of an expert performing the unique skill.

“The secret skill is at least a rank three Real God unique skill,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Rank three Real God unique skills can be created by an ordinary Chaotic Real God. It was nothing in Eternal Chaotic World.

However, a Chaotic Real God intentionally demonstrated the unique skill and turned it into an image that displayed itself to the audience to comprehend. This itself was a chance that was hard to come by.

In the barren land, there were countless steles that contained unique skill images.

Jian Wushuang constantly demonstrated and learned.

Unique skills that the others had created contained their unique doctrines. Although Jian Wushuang couldn’t fully master the unique skill, experiencing the transformation process of the unique skill helped with the development of his personal unique skill too.

…

On the north of Thunderbolt Island, there was a lofty mountain.

The mountain covered the expanse of one-tenth of the entire Thunderbolt Island while the foothill, mid-slope and the peak of the mountain had various palaces, pavilions and courtyards scattered around.

The mountain was special. The experts who had the right to stay on Thunderbolt Island permanently resided on the mountain.

Then, on the mid-slope of the mountain, there was a middle-aged man in a baggy long robe, Real God Li Huo, was standing in front of his mansion.

Real God Li Huo was a Chaotic Real God who was extremely close to the Real God ranking list. He resided on Thunderbolt Island all year round and he would wander outside occasionally.

He had just returned from a trip out. He went through the prohibition of his mansion then Real God Li Huo came to his courtyard in the middle of his mansion. There was a huge pond in the middle of his courtyard. The pond water was made of the extremely precious White Flame Spirit Liquid.

One should know that White Flame Spirit Liquid costs a thousand Chaos Gem a drop in Eternal Chaotic World and there was a big pond of it. Just how luxurious was it?

“Haha, babies, it has been years. Did you grow bigger?” Real God Li Huo smiled as he walked to the pond and overlooked the pond.

Then, Real God Li Huo’s face suddenly changed.

“The six Illusory Heart Carp that I reared… why are they missing?”

“How could it be?”

Real God Li Huo swept out his consciousness but he couldn’t detect the existence of any Illusory Heart Carp in the pond in his courtyard.

“D*mn it! Who was it? Who stole my Illusory Heart Carp?” Real God Li Huo was raging with anger.

Illusory Heart Carp was a celestial beast that had almost extinct in Eternal Chaotic World. If they were to grow up, it would be extremely helpful for a cultivator’s mental state. Hence, they were priceless.

Real God Li Huo happened to get six Illusory Heart Carp during a coincidental opportunity. He then had been keeping them carefully on Thunderbolt Island. He already took care of them for more than one hundred thousand years. But then, he had lost his six Illusory Heart Carp.

“I set up a prohibition around my mansion but there was no response from the prohibition at all. On Thunderbolt Island, there’s only one person who can do these filthy things!” Real God Li Huo clenched his teeth and he quivered with rage.

“Bastard!”

“That damn bastard! It was definitely him that stole my Illusory Heart Carp!”
