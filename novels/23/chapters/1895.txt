Chapter 1896: Everyone Has To Die!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Emperor God Tian Ling had been on the twenty-first place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. But due to the rise of Jian Wushuang, he was on the twenty second place.

In terms of ranking, he was higher than Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King and the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church. Hence, his power was naturally stronger.

When Jian Wushuang had fought with Soaring Heaven King Palace, Emperor God Tian Ling had been wandering in the Second Lair without revealing himself.

Until then, when Jian Wushuang finally saw Emperor God Tian Ling in person.

Jian Wushuang was surprised when he saw him.

He had a feeling that Emperor God Tian Ling’s true power wasn’t that simple.

As for the ranking on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, it might not be accurate. After all, Emperor God Tian Ling had been wandering in the Second Lair and never fought with anyone.

Who knew if he hadn’t improved in recent years?

In short, it was extremely stupid to gauge Emperor God Tian Ling’s Power according to the ranking list.

“Come, let’s head out.”

Jian Wushuang commanded and all experts in Lineage of Star, including the thirty bronze-armoured Dao soldiers and four silver-armoured Dao soldiers, moved altogether. They walked out from Universe Galaxy and stopped before the experts of Star Extermination Alliance.

“Oh, the people from Lineage of Star dare to walk out?”

“I thought they would be hiding in their lair and rely on their formation to drag things out longer.”

“Lineage of Star follows the lead of Sword Emperor now. Sword Emperor is not one who is overcautious. Previously, when Abysmal Palace attacked Lineage of Star, he led the experts in Lineage of Star and initiated a fight. In the end, Abysmal Palace was heavily defeated.”

“Humph, that’s because Abysmal Palace was too careless and they belittled Lineage of Star. But now, five major forces have teamed up and our team formation is so strong. How could Lineage of Star match evenly? If they dare to fight head-on, let’s crush them.”

The experts of Star Extermination Alliance we’re confident.

The top five major forces teamed up and there was no one force in Eternal Chaotic World that could match it evenly.

It was impossible that Lineage of Star had the ability to.

“Jian Wushuang!”

A loud voice sounded across the void. Palace Master Wu Lui from Abysmal Palace took a huge stride forward as his cold eyes looked at Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, Lineage of Star is very capable. In merely a few thousand years, you managed to invite so many experts.

“Compared to Star Extermination Alliance, it’s nothing,” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold, “Star Extermination Alliance gathered five major forces. According to what I know, the five of you have some conflicts normally and you even held grudges against one another. But today, you teamed up to aim at Lineage of Star. Isn’t that even more outstanding?”

“Humph, we five forces did have conflicts. However, it’s nothing compared to Lineage of Star. As long as we can exterminate Lineage of Star entirely, so what if we have to team up?” Number One Divine King from Divine King Island said.

The five major forces that formed Star Extermination Alliance had once suffered greatly from Lineage of Star.

As their resentment would stop at nothing, with such great resentment, they advanced and consolidated every single step to root out Lineage of Star.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, Emperor God Xuan Wu, Emperor God Gu Xue, and every Sir Gods…” Palace Master Wu Luo looked around, “At such a crucial moment, you opt to side with Lineage of Star. That’s very impressive.”

The guest elders who had accepted Lineage of Star’s invitation, their eyes dilated in shock.

“Humph, you thought Lineage of Star had the capital to be fearless to all forces after inviting all these experts? That’s a joke. Today onwards, Lineage of Star is going to be a history. These Sir Gods and Emperor Gods standing by Lineage of Star’s side, none of you should think of running away. Everyone has to die!” Palace God Wu Luo’s voice was cold.

“Yes, as they opted to side with Lineage of Star, they are Star Extermination Alliance’s enemies! All must die!” Number One Divine King from Divine King Island said coldly.

“Those who dance with Lineage of Star should be dead!” The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church roared.

The guest elders from Lineage of Star’s faces grew grave.

They were there by invitation. Although they had said that they would try their best to help Lineage of Star surpass the danger. Once their lives were threatened, they would leave straight away. They had never thought of risking their lives for Lineage of Star.

But now… it seemed too impossible to stop halfway.

“Hehe, it’s not just about the talk if you want to exterminate Lineage of Star. You have to rely on your fists too,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“You’re right. If so, you shall see if our Star Extermination Alliance’s fist is tough enough,” Palace Master Wu Luo’s face grew cold, “Everyone, let’s kill them!”

“Die!” Number One Divine King from Diving King Island roared.

“Whoever sides with Lineage of Star must be killed!”

The experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace, Real Martial Arts Divine Church, Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, instantly took action.

There were almost seventy Almighties that swarmed in.

There were towering aurae that filled in the air madly.

There was a boundless divine power that formed storms that pressed at Lineage of Star.

Every expert in Lineage of Star grew solemn and they felt pressured.

“Everyone, did you hear me clearly about the things that I told you earlier?” Jian Wushuang looked at everyone behind him.

“Mm,” the guest elders nodded simultaneously.

“If so, follow my instructions and charge!”

Just as Jian Wushuang spoke, his figure was the first that plunged out.

Behind him, Emperor God Jiu Yin, Emperor God Xuan Wu, Emperor God Gu Xue, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun and everyone else, including guest elders of Sir God-level and the other Dao soldiers, charged. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The two campsites fought against one another in the vast void outside Universe Galaxy.

The war instantly exploded.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang was raging with anger.

He was the Palace Master of Lineage of Star then and he naturally would be at the front.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were four resplendent golden lights that soared up from the sky. The experts from both parties had yet to collide but the four golden lights burst out like lightning.

Simultaneously, the bloodline power in Jian Wushuang’s body churned and he immediately became black jade. There were heads and arms extending out, a total of seven heads and fourteen arms.

Every single one of the fourteen arms was holding a sword.

The terrifying aura, along with soaring sword intention, swept out. Heaven and earth changed its colors as the highest heaven shook.

Then, Jian Wushuang pushed his power up to his peak.
