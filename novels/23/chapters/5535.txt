Chapter 5534 ¬†Embark

Wu Shan had a refined appearance, resembling a Confucian scholar without the aura of any practitioner.

"Good! You guys stay here and guard. I'll lead the others to continue the search!"

He was the overall commander in this operation to capture Jian Wushuang; he couldn't just wait idly here!

Once everything was arranged, he began the search based on the obtained information.

"Unknown strong individuals spotted in Liuzhou!"

"Four tier 5 Emperors seen in Hanzhou, unidentified identities!"

"A tier 6 Emperor appeared in North Mu Zhangzhou, not a native powerhouse!"

Messages kept pouring in.

Wu Shan, based on this information, initiated the confirmation search.

Any powerhouse above the tier 5 Emperor needed to be inspected, leaving no one unchecked.

Emperors were not Dao Lords; wherever they went, they would attract attention.

However, both Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi had treasures on them. Even a tier 6 Emperor couldn't discern their true strength.

Jian Wushuang was well-prepared. Now, he and Gong Miaoyi presented themselves as ordinary Dao Lord powerhouses.

And they were the kind who wouldn't use teleportation arrays.

They wandered all the way to Giant Gate City.

If it were just one person, Jian Wushuang's concealed methods would be undetectable, not just by a tier 6 Emperor but even by a supreme-Peak.

The flesh transformed by Ten Refinements allowed him to freely alter his Origin Source.

His Extreme Dao contained Myriad Daos, allowing for easy switching.

But in doing so, even Shen Ling couldn't find him.

He wasn't truly trying to escape; he just wanted to secretly attract Shen Ling's attention.

80 years later, in Giant Gate City, after remaining hidden.

The purple thunder within Jian Wushuang's body had completely healed.

"Things are going a bit too smoothly!" Jian Wushuang frowned.

80 years ago, he received news from Wu Zuo that Vice Hall Master Zhong had already brought people here.

According to the distribution of the Hall of Enforcement, someone should have arrived early!

However, at the moment, he had not sensed the aura of any tier 6 Emperor.

Everything was quite strange.

Moreover, when he left the Elder Palace, he did not disclose any information. Upon arriving at the Giant Gate City, not even Wu Zuo knew his whereabouts.

Vice Hall Master Zhong, however, could receive messages. This was peculiar; perhaps he had underestimated the Enforcement Hall.

Fortunately, Wu Zuo secretly informed him, allowing him to be prepared.

With his strength restored to its peak, Jian Wushuang had nothing to fear. Currently, no supreme-peak experts had appeared. There were only some tier 6 Emperors, and he could handle them.

It was Gong Miaoyi whose strength had lagged a bit.

"You've recovered?" Gong Miaoyi saw him walk out from the room and quickly stood up.

Jian Wushuang nodded and said indifferently, "It wasn't a fatal injury. I've already recovered quite a bit over the years."

If there were any accidents, he could instantly recover to his peak.

However, there was no need for that.

At the moment, he still couldn't be sure whether Gong Miaoyi was truly okay.

He needed to confirm once again.

"We've been here long enough; we need to change our location!"

Originally, according to his plan, they were going to hide here for tens of thousands of years. When the situation had calmed down, they would slowly move forward. However, now that they had been exposed, he had to depart ahead of schedule.

Gong Miaoyi was excited about this because this time they were heading directly to the mine.

"Tidy up; we're getting ready to depart!" Jian Wushuang revealed a faint smile.

They were about to face the pursuit of countless people.

It was quite interesting.

With his current strength, he was no longer the same as before.

Among the tier 6 Emperors, except for those supreme-peak existences, none were his match.

Especially those native Emperors.

The two of them, currently identified as Dao Lords, left the massive city without any noteworthy incidents or reasons for Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi to depart.

However, this ease and smoothness made them seem too relaxed.

Zhen Ling like this, how could they believe it?

So, before setting out, Jian Wushuang intentionally left behind a subtle and extremely hidden aura. As soon as Vice Hall Master Zhong arrived, he would be able to detect it.

This aura was the purple thunder power left in his body by Wu Zuo.

The other party wouldn't be ignorant of it.

After the two left the small courtyard, that trace of thunder power reflected in a puddle. Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates

And in that puddle, a face appeared.

"Hehe...."

Even Jian Wushuang didn't notice this.

The two headed straight towards the north of the Giant Gate City, where many treasures for flight, much faster than Dao Lords flying, were available.

They needed to cross 19 large provinces to reach the mines, a perilous journey.

Except for Emperor-level powerhouses, ordinary Lords Monarchs usually traveled in groups.

Those who dared to travel alone were ruthless individuals.

"Dao Friends who are going to Qinghe Niu Province, hurry up! With an Emperor guarding us, the journey will be absolutely safe!"

"Guangzhou...."

Many people shouted, attracting quite a few Dao L:ords.

"This fellow Daoist, even crossing three provinces, this price..." A man with a fair complexion, resembling a young man, walked forward and inquired about the cost.

Behind him stood a chilling young girl with short hair, looking quite capable.

These two were Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi.

The Dao Lord who shouted was not weak, estimated to have the strength of a Half-Step Emperor. After glancing at Jian Wushuang and then scanning Gong Miaoyi, he had a figure in mind.

The more powerful the cultivator, the lower the fee.

If they were Emperors, they might even get paid because having powerhouses ensured a safe journey.

This flying treasure is a rare Innate Treasure and not cheap.

Even ordinary Emperors don't possess such a treasure.

In the outside world, encounters with Emperors engaged in killing and plundering are rare during flights.

"If it's just the two of you, it'll be 60 godstones!" The man in the brocade robe spoke, "Rest assured, this time, there's a powerful Emperor from the Qingniao Hall sitting in, and there will be no danger along the way."

Fearing that Jian Wushuang might find it expensive and leave, he began explaining the benefits.

Considering Jian Wushuang's current status, it was indeed a bit pricey.

60 godstones were required.

Among the wandering Dao Lords, their value was quite average. A few thousand godstones would be good enough, and spending 60 godstones for a single journey was indeed expensive.

"Daoist Brother, the strength of my companion and me is not bad. We both have the strength of Dao Lords. Normally, it's 20 godstones each for us. Why did the price suddenly increase so much? Even with a senior Emperor present, it shouldn't require this much!" Jian Wushuang spoke tactfully, trying to negotiate a lower price.

However, as he spoke, more onlookers gathered, drawn by the discussion.

The man in the brocade robe frowned slightly, worried that Jian Wushuang might affect his business. He loudly declared, "Hmph, traveling with Emperors should make you proud. With good luck, you might even receive guidance from the Emperor. Is 60 godstones too much for such an opportunity?"

As soon as he finished speaking, many people secretly cursed in their hearts.

Guidance from an Emperor.

Who did this guy think they were? Did he take them for geniuses or fools?

After reaching the level of Dao Lords, to progress further, one needed to join a sect. However, at this stage, ordinary sects wouldn't accept them.
