Chapter 145: The Selection Battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Participate in the Easternmost Hunt is the only way to join the old sects. When does this even, the Easternmost Hunt, begin?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, the Easternmost Hunting, which is held every 10 years, will start in three months. But for the small empires, such as the Tianzong Dynasty, only 15 Gold Core Realm experts can participate,” Palace Master White said.

“Only 15?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

A dynasty, even if it was a small one, possessed countless geniuses.

In the Tianzong Dynasty, there are 100 experts on the Earthly Dragon List. They are all geniuses. The number would be even larger if the hidden experts of the Gold Core Realm are included.

However, only 15 of them were able to participate in the Easternmost Hunt. Therefore, each spot was extremely precious.

“Because there are too few spots, before the Easternmost Hunt, our Tianzong Dynasty will select the 15 strongest experts to participate in it. And this selection is called the quota battle!” Palace Master Black said.

“Though it is just a selection battle inside the Tianzong Dynasty, it will still be very cruel. As the Holy Place for cultivators in Tianzong Dynasty, we can elect 10 people to participate in this quota battle. But in the end, how many of them can obtain a spot is unknown.”

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Only 15 spots, even if it was in Dragon Palace, which was known for being full of exceptional geniuses, the available number of spots was also limited.

“Among the disciples of Dragon Palace, Baili Chen and Qing Cang are ranked second and sixth on the Earthly Dragon List. Both of them have a good chance. However, they can only take two spots!”

“In the previous selection battle, Dragon Palace took at least four or five out of the 15 spots. But this time the disciples of Dragon Palace, compared to the previously, are weaker overall, so our expectations are lower. But we want to get at least three spots!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“In addition to Baili Chen and Qing Cang, we need one more person to secure a spot,” Palace Master White said seriously.

“You want me to participate in the selection battle and get a spot for Dragon Palace?” Jian Wushuang looked questioningly at both Palace Master Black and Palace Master White.

“Yes.” Palace Master White nodded. “Two years ago, you defeated Xiao Mang, who ranked 22nd on the Earthly Dragon List. Besides, your talent is well known, and in these two years, your strength must have a greatly improved. It’s very likely that you can obtain a spot!”

“But, it is not just for Dragon Palace. You are also participating in the selection battle for yourself.”

“I know your true identity. Jian Wushuang, the target of a Scarlet Kill Command from Blood Feather Tower, which means that they will kill you at all costs.?So two years ago, despite the revenge from Dragon Palace, the Blood Feather Tower was still determined to kill you.”

“There is no buffer between you and Blood Feather Tower. It won’t stop until one of you dies. To be honest, your current strength is still too weak to take on Blood Feather Tower.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“So, what you need the most now, is time,” Palace Master White said and smiled. “You are talented, so if you are given enough time to grow, there is a huge possibility that you will obliterate Blood Feather Tower in the future.”

“But, Blood Feather Tower won’t give you time. They will take every chance to assassinate you. Though I will give you shelter, unless you are hiding in Dragon Palace, it will be difficult to really ensure your safety.”

“If you can, stand out in the Easternmost Hunt and draw the attention of those old sects. Once you become a core disciple of those old sects, they won’t dare touch you.”

Palace Master Black also nodded and said, “The old sects are powerful and capable of destroying Blood Feather Tower with ease. Therefore, if you become a core disciple of an old sect, Blood Feather Tower won’t dare to kill you, at least on the surface!”

“And you can take advantage of the shelter from the old sect to improve your strength. Finally, when your strength has increased to a certain level, you can fight back against Blood Feather Tower.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

He also agreed with the two Palace Masters.

Indeed, if he could get a spot?and participate in the Easternmost Hunt, then joined one old sect, he could appear openly in front of Blood Feather Tower. The cultivation resources in the old sects were also better than those in Dragon Palace.

“Trust me. I will attend the selection battle. Though I am not absolutely sure I can get a spot, I will do my best,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, I knew you would agree. Only a fool wouldn’t agree,” Palace Master White said and laughed. “Okay, here’s a gift.”

Palace Master White turned her hand over and gave Jian Wushuang a thick book.

“This is...” Jian Wushuang looked at this book strangely. After opening it, his look immediately changed. “Formless Sword Art, the last three moves?”

“Yes, that is the last three moves of the Formless Sword Art,” Palace Master White laughed and said, “Actually, two years ago, when you passed the 11th level of the Dragon Gate, both of us and those Temple Masters discussed and agreed to give it to you. But we failed to do that because of what happened. Now that you have returned, it’s yours.”

“But the last three moves of the Formless Sword Art are not available in the Secret Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang felt it was strange.

“Haha, you are really stupid. Do you think that the Secret Pavilion is simple?” Palace Master White said and grinned.

Jian Wushuang was confused.

“There are actually two Secret Pavilions in Dragon Palace, a big one, and a small one. You often go to the big one. Though there are many treasures, it’s only suitable for the warriors in the Gold Core Realm and the Spiritual Sea Realm. However, the small one is only available to Palace Masters and Temple Masters of Dragon Palace. Though there are few treasures, they are more precious!”

“Like the last three moves of the Formless Sword Art, which were not in the big Secret Pavilion, only in the small Secret Pavilion.”

“So, are you surprised?” Palace Master White asked while beaming.

“Yeah.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

The Formless Sword Art was known as the top sword skill in Tianzong Dynasty. It was incredibly powerful.

After the experience in the Ancestor’s Land, Jian Wushuang’s field of vision had increased. Not to mention, he also had the Selfless Sword Technique, which was better than the Formless Sword Art.

However, Jian Wushuang still looked forward to studying the last three moves of the Formless Sword Art.
