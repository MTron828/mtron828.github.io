Chapter 2249 Massacre

Back then, Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine had been mediocre and straightforward. The sword skills he had cast were extremely simple.After he cultivated within the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower for a thousand years, his understanding of sword skills was completely different

There was more to sword skills than the techniques.

The techniques were fixed and couldn’t be changed. However, a human could be flexible.

Those who knew how to use a sword could make a simple slash or jab even more precise and deadly compared to those ordinary experts who cast incredible sword skills.

Those who did not know how to use a sword would have numerous weaknesses even if they had incredible sword skills. They might not even be able to beat someone who used simple sword skills.

Jin Wushuang, who had cultivated within the Sword Doctrine Trail Tower, had been that way initially.

But now, he was the opposite.

In the space, Jian Wushuang stopped holding back as he used all the sword skills he had.

His casual slash, flick, cut, thrust... Each move was used perfectly and smoothly.

This was proof he had finally made the cut to be considered an expert in the Sword Doctrine. This was the difference between Initial Success in Sword Doctrine compared to an ametuer.

With the help of his sword skills, Jian Wushuang could fend off the attacks from more than twenty experts in the Divine Demon Realm easily.

He could even counter-attack frequently while fending off the attacks targeted at him.

He thrust out his sword.

Before the sword skill reached the target, a terrifying soul attack would reach it first.

Jian Wushuang’s soul attack had become even more powerful during the twenty four thousand years he was in slumber as his soul power had experienced a great increase during this time.

Now, a top-tier stage-three great emperor would not be able to handle his soul attack when he cast it together with the Soul Swallowing Pearl and the Three Divine Lights secret skill.

Even experts in the Divine Demon Realm would experience a short blank in their consciousness when Jian Wushuang’s soul attacks land on them.

This short blank was enough for Jian Wushuang to cast his sword skills without giving his opponents a chance to defend themselves from the attacks.

“Fifth.”

Jian Wushuang’s sword light flickered again as another head was detached from its body.

...

Within moments, another sword light, which looked like fresh blood, penetrated the head of another expert in the Divine Demon Realm.

This expert died with both of his eyes wide open, unable to believe how he had died at the hands of Jian Wushuang.

“The sixth!”

Jian Wushuang continued the massacre with a cold attitude.

...

A blurry light shrouded two other experts in the Divine Demon Realm.

Both of these experts only had ordinary fighting powers, hence both experienced a short blank in their consciousness even though Jian Wushuang had targeted both of them with a single soul attack.

Pfft! Pfft!

The blade entered their bodies and the dead bodies fell towards the ground below.

“The eighth!”

Jian Wushuang said casually.

...

The twenty experts in the Divine Demon Realm initially had not taken Jian Wushuang seriously at all as they had thought he was not a threat.

They had severely underestimated Jian Wushuang.

Once the battle began, Jian Wushuang’s fighting power made the shiver in fear.

“Too fast. His speed is too fast and we cannot catch up to him. He is not only enlightened to the Spacetime Rules of Order, he also excels in using this power.”

“His sword skills are very terrifying. He must have made the cut to become an amatuer in Sword Doctrine!!”

“Amatuer? What a joke! He must have reached initial success!!”

Furthermore, his soul attack is far too powerful. We cannot stop it.”

Terrifying shrieks were heard across the battlefield.

These experts in the Divine Demon Realm were completely shocked by Jian Wushuang’s fighting power.

His understanding and his use of Spacetime Rules of Order to reach incredible speed was amazing.

His sophisticated sword skills were at the level of initial success in the Sword Doctrine.

There was also the horrifying and unstoppable soul attack.

The combination of these three made Jian Wushuang their worst nightmare.

Massacure!

Ever since the battle started, it had been a one-sided massacre.

Even though there were more than twenty experts in the Divine Demon Realm, they didn’t work together, hence they were not a threat to Jian Wushuang at all.

Jian Wushuang could continue the massacre without worrying.

No one could stop his soul attack.

No one could be compared to his sword skills.

Initial success stage in sword doctrine... Far too few experts in the Divine Demon Realm could reach this stage even back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Even if someone did, their fighting power would be restricted as they would be under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

However, Jian Wushuang was completely unaffected by the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

He could use every single scrap of his fighting power to the fullest.

Within moments, eleven out of the twenty experts in the Divine Demon Realm had been killed by Jian Wushuang. That was about half of the total number!

“Too terrifying, the Sword Emperor is too terrifying!”

“Who said we only needed to beware of Emperor Bai? What is going on with the Sword Emperor?”

“Emperor Bai? He is definitely not as terrifying as the Sword Emperor!”

“We were tricked! We were all tricked! The strongest man within the Sanctuary Alliance is not Emperor Bai, but the Sword Emperor!!!”

“Run! hurry up, escape!”

Hysterical roars from these experts were here on the battlefield.

The remaining ten experts in the Divine Demon Realm were trembling in fear.

They lost the courage to battle Jian Wushuang as they started to run away.

Within moments, in under two breaths, about half of the experts there had been killed.

If Jian Wushuang were to kill the remaining experts, he would do so within the time of a single breath. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

There was no way they could beat Jian Wushuang. If they continued to fight, they would definitely die.

They knew this well, hence, the experts all started to run away.

As for Lord Jiao...

Even though the reward of a Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir was of very high value, it could only entice these experts to fight, not risk their lives.

If they stayed and fought, they would definitely die.

No one would die for Lord Jiao.

Even Lord Jiao’s subordinate, Chu He, escaped without hesitation.

Within moments, eleven of the experts had died while the remaining escaped out of sight.

Jian Wushuang stood there coldly even after killing eleven experts in the Divine Demon Realm. It was as though he was killing eleven insignificant people.
