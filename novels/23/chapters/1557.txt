Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Real God Long Qing!”

Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and Fiery King lowered themselves.

“Why are only you here? Where’s Jian Wushuang?” Fiery King was the first who asked.

“Jian Wushuang… He’s there,” Real God Long Qing beckoned to the ground below.

The three of them then noticed the figure on the ground below. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

From that one glance, Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and Fiery King were shocked.

“He… he’s Jian Wushuang?” Real God Bai Ying was shocked.

“How is it possible? From his aura, it is really him,” Real God Yin Tuo exclaimed in surprise.

While Fiery King’s face grew dim.

The three of them could see the figure on the ground below but the figure had grey hair, a hoary look, and his body was like a withered tree. It was just like an elderly who had reached old age. On top of that, the grey-haired elderly had no fluctuation of divine power at all.

He was just like a common person.

A total commoner.

The grey-haired common elder was one of the members widely recognized in Eternal Chaotic World, Jian Wushuang?

Swoosh!

Fiery King was the first to plunge down and appear before the grey-haired elderly.

It was as though he had felt Fiery King’s arrival. The grey-haired elderly lifted his head slightly and revealed a face that looked like Jian Wushuang’s but obviously a few times older. The face was hoary and he could barely force a smile at Fiery King.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s really you?” Fiery King’s eyes were wide-open.

Even though there was a drastic change in Jian Wushuang’s appearance, the fluctuation of divine power vanished, the aura was extremely weak, the nature of the weak aura was really one that he was familiar with. Fiery King was definite that the grey-haired elderly was really Jian Wushuang.

“Why did you become like this?” Fiery King’s face grew grave and his voice was low. At the same time, he glanced at Real God Long Qing, “Real God Long Qing, weren’t you with Jian Wushuang the whole time? Why did you let him turn into such a condition?”

Fiery King was hot-tempered and Jian Wushuang did good grace to him.

Looking at Jian Wushuang’s condition, he didn’t worry about if Real God Long Qing was a Chaotic Real God but reprimanded him.

However, Real God Long Qing only creased his eyebrows slightly.

“Brother Fiery King.”

Jian Wushuang, who had become a gray-haired elderly, spoke. His voice was hoarse and weak, “This has nothing to do with Real God Long Qing. He did his best. The reason why I became like this is due to my personal body condition.”

“Personal body condition?” Fiery King squinted his eyes.

“Let’s forget about this. We barged into Blood Demon Church and made a huge scene. We may have already startled Real God Jiu Gong. Hence, it’s best we leave here first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright,” Fiery King answered.

Real God Long Qing, Real God Bai Ying and Real God Yin Tuo nodded heavily in agreement.

“Brother Fiery King, please lend me a hand,” Jian Wushuang suddenly extended his hand. His hand was hoary too and his skin was so dry that it cracked.

“I have no divine power at all. I can’t even travel. I can only ask Brother Fiery King to give me a ride,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Fiery King felt a tug at his heartstrings and his gaze at Jian Wushuang was filled with sympathy.

Very soon, the five of them departed. However, Jian Wushuang was on Fiery King’s back.

On the way, Jian Wushuang never spoke. As for Fiery King, Real God Long Qing and the rest were in silence. No one spoke.

However, not long after they had traveled from Blood Demon Church.

Vroom!

A ferocious power suddenly descended. Then, there was immediately a three-meter-tall figure, a giant-like elderly in a purple robe appeared in the void from nowhere.

Looking at the elderly in a purple robe, the few of them who were originally traveling forward suddenly stopped as their eyes contracted in shock.

“Greetings to Mister Jiu Gong from Long Qing,” Real God Long Qing bowed slightly before the elderly in a purple robe.

“It’s Real God Jiu Gong.”

“We’re in trouble.”

Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and Fiery King were terrified.

Jian Wushuang, who was on Fiery King’s back, couldn’t help but lift his head to steal a glance at the elderly in a purple robe.

Real God Jiu Gong was the King of Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom.

At the same time, Lineage of Star was fearful of him. They didn’t dare to send any Real Gods from their sect to Jiu Gong Holy King.

He was a superb expert on the fifth place on Real God ranking list.

Although Real God Long Qing was a Chaotic Real God, compared to Real God Jiu Gong, he was far behind. When they met, just like then, Real God Long Qing had to refer to Real God Jiu Gong as Mister.

“Real God Long Qing, the extermination of Blood Demon Church is your doing?” Real God Jiu Gong stood there with his cold voice and asked in a calm manner, but every word he uttered hammered the few of their hearts brutally. They were all shivering in fear.

“Such terrifying power,” Fiery King clenched his teeth and complimented.

“Mister Jiu Gong, yes, it is our doing,” Real God Long Qing replied carefully.

“Humph, Blood Demon Church is one of the forces under the control of Holy Kingdom Jiu Gong. Before you took action against it, you didn’t even inform me. Wasn’t that disrespectful to me?”

Real God Jiu Gong harrumped coldly and there was anger in his eyes.

“This…” Real God Long Qing’s face grew grave. He thought for a while and took out a Qian Kung ring, “I am really not considerate enough regarding what happened today. There are twenty Doctrine Gems in this Qian Kun ring. Consider this an apology.”

“Only twenty?” Real God Jiu Gong’s gaze was cold, “Two hundred Doctrine Gems and I’ll let the few of you off. Otherwise, none of you will be leaving.”

“Two hundred?” Real God Long Qing stunned.

Real God Bai Ying and Real God Yin Tuo stunned.

Doctrine Gem was an extremely precious treasure to Real Gods as it was very useful.

Any ordinary Eternal Real God would only have ten Doctrine Gems at most. Two hundred Doctrine Gems was also a huge figure to Real God Long Qing, who was a Chaotic Real God.

“Fine, I’ll give them to you.”

Real God Long Qing threw another Qian Kun ring out directly.

Although two hundred Doctrine Gem wasn’t a small amount, Real God Long Qing accepted Hall Master Yuan’s invitation and Hall Master Yuan offered him a higher price than that.

After Real God Jiu Gong took the Qian Kun ring, he glanced and nodded, “You can leave now.”

Fiery King and the rest let out a breath of relief and immediately prepared to leave.

But then, Real God Jiu Gong suddenly fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang, “Who is this person that didn’t even have any fluctuation of divine power?”

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat.

He knew clearly that if Real God Jiu Gong were to find out his real identity, he couldn’t even think about leaving Holy Kingdom Jiu Gong alive.

Fiery King immediately replied, “Mister, this is my relative. Many years ago, he got caught by Blood Demon church and was tortured. His training was in vain entirely and he turned into a commoner. I barged into Blood Demon Church today to take revenge and to rescue him.”

“Is that so?” Real God Jiu Gong raised his eyebrows but didn’t suspect.

“Let’s go.”

Fiery King and the rest quickly brought Jian Wushuang with them and left.
