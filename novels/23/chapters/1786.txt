Chapter 1787: Master, Mister!

“We’re finished, we’re really finished.”

Many Universe Gods in the Dayu World howled in grief.

Just then, a figure appeared out of thin air before the great army of the Tian Jue City.

It was a black-armored middle-aged man who looked a bit arrogant. The middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with coldness. After he looked at the Universe Gods of the Dayu World, he wore a smile that was filled with ridicule.

Upon seeing the arrogant middle-aged man, the Universe Gods of the Dayu World gave up all their hope completely.

“A Real God. They actually had a Real God?” The Dayu Palace Master gave a bitter smile.

“Palace Master, shall we surrender?” a Master from the Holy Prefecture could not help but say.

“Surrender?”

Upon hearing that, the expressions of the Universe Gods present changed.

With such a great difference in abilities, they would definitely die if they were to continue going against them. Hence, surrendering was indeed a good idea.

“It’s useless.” The Dayu Palace Master forced a smile and shook his head, “If the Dayu World had surrendered right away at the start, the Tian Jue City might still accept us. However, now, the full force of the Tian Jue City is here and even a Real God expert has shown himself. As such, what they want now is no longer the Dayu World surrendering. Instead, they want to destroy the Dayu World completely and frighten the other regions.”

“Hence, even if we were to surrender now, they would definitely not accept it.”

“Then what can we do?” the Universe Gods in the Dayu World started to feel anxious.

“What else can we do?” The Dayu Palace Master said with grief: “All of you, as soon as the Tian Jue City makes a move later on, please escape straight away. I hope that as many of you as possible can escape. We shall not resist them fearlessly as it would be useless.”

Everyone became silent.

“Brother Wu Cang, for you to come this time around, I am extremely grateful to you. If we really fight later on, please leave quickly as well,” the Dayu Palace Master said.

“Dayu… ah,” Wu Cang sighed lightly, “I’m sorry that I’m unable to help you in this battle.”

The Dayu Palace Master waved his hands and did not have any intention of blaming Wu Cang. After that, he looked at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, you should not have returned during this period of time,”

“Dayu Palace Master, the great battle has yet to begin. Thus, you should not be so pessimistic. What if there are some other unforeseen events?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“I really admire you for still being able to joke around at this period of time,” the Dayu Palace Master was in sorrow.

“Palace Master, look!” an alarmed cry could be heard abruptly.

The Dayu Palace Master, Wu Cang and the large number of Universe Gods present looked over immediately. With that, all their eyes shrank fiercely.

From the void far away, two figures were speeding over. Although they had not reached them yet, their two frightening auras had already spread across the area.

Among the two auras, one was that of a Universe God of the Third Heaven while the other was that of a Real God expert.

“This is?” the Dayu Palace Master was puzzled. No one else understood either.

However, the two figures had already appeared in front of the great army of the Tian Jue City.

The eyes of the cold youth who was carrying a sword in his hand and emitting the aura of a Universe God of the Third Heaven were ice-cold. As he passed by the great army of the Tian Jue City, his ice-cold voice resounded across the universe.

“Tian Jue City, leave immediately. If not… die!”

The voice was like the fury of a thunderbolt and it did not dissipate even after a long time.

Upon hearing the voice, the large number of Universe Gods of the Dayu World became extremely dumbfounded.

“Who are they?” the Dayu Palace Master opened his eyes wide.

From the looks of it, the other party obviously wanted to force the Tian Jue City to retreat. However, he had never seen those two people before. Hence, it was impossible for him to have friendly relations with them. Why would they help him for no reason?

As for the large number of Universe Gods in the Tian Jue City, all of them were enraged.

The leader of the Tian Jue City, the black-armored middle-aged man, became furious right away, “Where did this reckless idiot who dared to be impudent in front of my Tian Jue City’s great army come from? Men, kill him!”

Tens of Universe Gods of the Third Heaven of the Tian Jue City attacked with lightning speed at once.

“Since you are unwilling to retreat, you shall die!”

A voice that was filled with shocking murderous intent could be heard from the cold youth. At the next moment, his sword came out of its scabbard and he attacked with his sword immediately.

As for the beautiful woman beside him who had already reached the level of a Real God, she did not move.

A great battle burst forth instantly.

Swish!

A crimson sword shadow which was filled with an infinite amount of murderous intent and looked as if it came from the Abysmal Hell attacked.

The sword light flew wantonly and swept past the bodies of six Universe Gods of the Third Heavens instantly. With that, six bodies fell at the same time.

After that, the cold youth unleashed another stroke. With the same stroke, a few icy-cold bodies fell again.

With one face-off, the tens of Universe Gods of the Third Heaven which had headed for the cold youth were killed.

“How is this possible?”

“He is so powerful!!”

Such a scene caused everyone to be dumbfounded.

The leader of the Tian Jue City flew into a rage at once.

“Die!”

Boom!

The aura of a Real God was unleashed. The leader of the Tian Jue City took action personally and he headed for the cold youth.

With a Real God coming personally, everyone in the Dayu World thought that the cold youth would retreat and the beautiful woman behind him, who was also a Real God, would fight. However, in actual fact, the cold youth did not even retreat by a half a step. He still held his sword and continued to fight with the leader of the Tian Jue City alone.

The end results were… everyone present became silent.

The whole universe became deathly silent.

It was extremely silent.

“Dead?”

“A Real God was actually killed by a Universe God on the spot?”

“How… how is this possible?”

If not for them seeing it with their own eyes, almost no one present would think that it was true.

After killing the leader of the Tian Jue City, the cold youth spoke again, “Scram!”

Although it was just one word, it contained an enormous amount of prestige. The large number of Universe Gods from the Tian Jue City had already been shocked to the point that they had lost their courage. As such, they escaped in all directions at once.

In just an instant, the great army of the Tian Jue City, which was originally vast and mighty, escaped and not even a single one of them was left.

The Dayu World’s danger this time around was taken care of easily, just like that.

“What exactly is going on?”

The large number of Universe Gods of the Dayu World had not even reacted yet.

“No idea,” the Dayu Palace Master also nodded his head repeatedly. To date, he still did not know who those two experts were and why they helped his Dayu World. He only knew that among the two experts, only one of them was sent out. Moreover, it was a Universe God. However, even with that, he threw the great army of the Tian Jue City which had caused all the powerhouses in the Dayu World to give up all hope into chaos.

“Killing a Real God with the power of a Universe God… this is a real super expert. In the whole Snow Kingdom, no, in the whole Eternal Chaotic World, he is definitely a top genius. Such a super expert has actually come to our Dayu World?”

The Dayu Palace Master murmured. At the next moment, he reacted.

“Brother Wu Cang, Jian Wushuang and everyone present, quick, follow me to greet those two people together,” the Dayu Palace Master said immediately.

Everyone present had planned to go and greet them. Only Jian Wushuang laughed instead: “No need. They will come here themselves.”

As expected, the two experts who had defeated the great army of the Tian Jue City were already flying toward them and in an instant, they appeared in front of them.

“Greetings to two Lords from Dayu as well as the large number of Universe Gods of the Dayu World. Thank you so much for helping my Dayu World to resolve our danger this time around. My Dayu World is extremely grateful to the two of you,” the Dayu Palace Master said. At the same time, he, as well as everyone else beside him, bowed to the people who had come with respect.

Everyone bowed to greet them. Only Jian Wushuang remained standing indifferently. Both his hands were also behind his back and he had no intention of greeting them.

“Jian Wushuang, please greet them quickly,” the Dayu Palace Master lowered his voice and shouted.

“Jian Wushuang,” Wu Cang and the Scarlet Island Master urged as well.

“Greet them?” Jian Wushuang stroke his own nose and he had a puzzled expression.

At that moment, the two experts who had defeated the great army of the Tian Jue City and caused the Dayu Palace Master, Wu Cang and the rest of the people to revere them lowered their heads at the same time.

“Greetings to Master from your disciple!”

“Greetings to Mister from your maid!”

They did not conceal their voices at all and their voices resounded across the quiet void.

The Dayu Palace Master, Wu Cang and the rest of the people who were originally urging Jian Wushuang to greet them immediately were all dumbfounded.
