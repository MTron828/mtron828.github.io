Chapter 148: Doubts

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Ridiculous. It’s so ridiculous. How could he rank tenth with that?”

“Every top ten experts in the Earthly Dragon List earned their ranking with publicly accepted battle results. What about Jian Wushuang? Because he defeated Ouyang Haoyue easily, or because of his talents? You must be kidding me!”

“Taking on the blade attack of Ouyang Haoyue with his bare hands and holding the edge is not too hard. Warriors who have mastered and materialized Earth Essence, with good defense, can definitely confront an enemy’s weapon. It’s not a big deal.”

“Exactly! Beating Ouyang Haoyue easily could only get him into the top 20 of the Earthly Dragon List, or even the top 15. No one would say anything about that. But top ten is far too much.”

“When did Golden-dragon Palace become so perfunctory about the rankings of the Earthly Dragon List? How dare they put him in the tenth place without convincing battle results?”

A chorus of doubts.

The Earthly Dragon List’s written description of Jian Wushuang was not enough to convince the experts in Tianzong Dynasty.

After all, Jian Wushuang did not have any open battle results that could be proud of.

Defeating Xiao Mang? Beating Ouyang Haoyue?

Neither could prove that he was eligible to be ranked tenth.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t care a bit about how the outside world discredited him. He had been delving into the Formless Sword Art and finally managed to barely grasp the seventh move after seven days.

While the eighth move was still at the learning stage.

“Second Brother, Third Brother, Fourth Sister,” Wang Yuan called out for his siblings.

Wang Yuan’s voice echoed throughout the whole manor, and soon the four siblings gathered together.

“Palace Master White asked me to tell you that those seniors of Dragon Palace have already arrived. Today, ten people will be delegated to participate in the selection battle. She wants you guys to go there now,” said Wang Yuan.

“They have already arrived?” Jian Wushuang asked with a twist of his mouth.

“The seniors of Dragon Palace?” A piercingly cold light appeared in Yang Zaixuan’s eyes.

“Let’s go and meet these seniors,” Jian Wushuang said and laughed. After which, the four headed to the Martial Arts Practice Field.

A sea of people were crammed together at the huge Martial Arts Practice Field of Dragon Palace.

A large number of disciples had come here. While several figures with majestic auras stood tall at the center of the crowds.

Some of these figures were as fierce as a flame, while some were calm as a mountain, and some were matchlessly ferocious.

It could be seen at first glance that they had all reached the peak of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm!

These were the seniors of Dragon Palace, who had been traveling to temper themselves. There were 30 people and 15 of them were on the Earthly Dragon List（excluding Su Lie）.

“That’s Xu Changkong, ranked 44th on the Earthly Dragon List. I know him, when I was traveling last year, I witnessed him killing four warriors in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm with a single stroke of his axe.”

“That’s Gu He, ranked 53rd on the Earthly Dragon List!”

“Is that Liu Qing the Blood Pikeman?”

“So many experts! Are they all seniors of Dragon Palace?”

Many disciples stared at these figures as their hearts pounded with excitement.

Any one of those seniors was widely known in the Tianzong Dynasty, and they all came from Dragon Palace.

Among those seniors, two figures were the most noticeable.

One was a savage man with messy hair and an unshaven face.

The other was a scarlet-robed young man, who was dapper in appearance but had an aura of apathy. He wore a pair of bloody gloves which were covered with mysterious cracks that looked like hideous outstretched blood vessels.

These two people had already become legends in the Tianzong Dynasty.

Barbarian King Qing Cang!

Demon Hand Baili Chen!

Both of them were senior Disciples of Dragon Palace. One was previously ranked fifth on the Earthly Dragon List, but was now ranked sixth due to the rise of Ouyang Haotian.

While the other one had occupied the second rank on the Earthly Dragon List, and had even ranked first before Xue Yun from Blood Feather Tower had appeared!

At this moment, Jian Wushuang and his three siblings arrived here, as well as Su Lie.

“Oh look, the freshmen are here.”

The seniors looked over immediately and fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Is he Jian Wushuang?”

“I heard that he is only 19 years old. He’s quite excellent to rank tenth at such a young age.”

“Huh, tenth place? Is a little brat like him qualified to rank tenth?”

The seniors were also discussing this with each other.

“Haha, Su Lie, did you hear that? These seniors only care about my third brother. No one is paying attention to you, the 94th rank on the Earthly Dragon List,” Wang Yuan spoke freely and smiled.

“Your third brother is famous. I can do nothing about that,” Su Lie said with a resigned tone. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

If the current Dragon Palace was divided into two camps, the seniors and the freshmen, then Su lie also belonged to the freshmen.

Among the freshmen, only he and Jian Wushuang were included in the Earthly Dragon List, so they were naturally the leaders. Unfortunately, unlike Jian Wushuang, he received no attention from the seniors.

As for Bai Cheng, who was once famous among the freshmen, he left Dragon Palace and disappeared two years ago.

“Are they Baili Chen and Qing Cang?” Jian Wushuang asked, looking right at the two most conspicuous people among the seniors.

The scarlet-robed youth and the barbarian.

They were the only people who were really qualified to draw his attention among the seniors.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several figures appeared on the Martial Arts Practice Field at the same time. It was the Palace Masters and the Temple Masters.

“It looks like everybody is here, ” Palace Master White’s gentle voice spread out, “This selection battle is the same as the previous ones. Dragon Palace can recommend 10 disciples to join the competition. Those ten people will be chosen from among all of you. It depends on nothing else but your strength.”

“Anyone who is strong enough can get a recommendation.”

“In addition, among you...Baili Chen, Qing Cang, Jian Wushuang.”

Palace Master White mentioned these names.

Jian Wushuang and the other two who were called immediately looked at her.

“Since you three are all ranked in the top ten of the Earthly Dragon List, you don’t need to compete. You will automatically receive a recommendation for the selection battle, ” said Palace Master White.

Hearing these words, the audience burst out in an uproar.

The seniors were also in turmoil.

There were only ten spots, and now three of them were gone.?Among the three recommendations, Baili Chen and Qing Cang would obviously get one since their strength had been proven long ago. It was undisputable.

But how could Jian Wushuang skip the competition and get recommended automatically?

The seniors of Dragon Palace had doubts about this.

Since there were doubts, there were also disagreements. One person stood out instantly.

“Palace Master, I don’t think it’s fair!”

A powerful voice rose over the entire Martial Arts Practice Field.
