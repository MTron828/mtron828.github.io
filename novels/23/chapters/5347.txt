Chapter 5346: It Was Actually Him!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The opponent has arrived, a second-rank elder and the only one within the capital,” Bai Junwang’s face held a hint of surprise upon receiving the information.

“It’s him?”

“Xuanyuan Dapan!’

It was quite a coincidence—it turned out to be the grandfather of the Ninth Prince.

Xuanyuan Dapan next door had also inquired and found only Xia Mang

Guanyu there.

Blood is thicker than water.

He never expected that his grandson, who fell short in accomplishing tasks but excelled in managing affairs, was actually the young master of the Kui organization, possessing a third-rank token.

Swish!

Inside a simple formation, a small token appeared, containing the treasure

Jian Wushuang needed.

Even between father and son, rules couldn’t be broken.

After completing all this, Xuanyuan Dapan resisted the urge to look for Xia Mang Guanyu.

Instead, his gaze casually swept over the fox clan girl below, revealing a greedy look.

After examining the treasures inside the token, Jian Wushuangs eyes showed delight.

This was the biggest gain he obtained ina thousand years.

Apart from these items, he also obtained the black armor bestowed by the divine spirit, known as the Candle Dragon Armor.

It was a crucial part of the Beast God Weapon and the reason he chose to join the Kui organization.

And then, he became increasingly entangled.

The defense of this Candle Dragon Armor rivaled Eternal Treasures, second only to the Candle Dragon Eye—an item that contained the origin source of the divine beast.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang flipped over, retrieving a token from the hidden space.

Compared to the Candle Dragon Armor, this token was the most cherished treasure for him.

It couldn’t exactly be called a treasure; the token merely recorded a secret.

It contained information about the components of the Candle Dragon.

The leading organization in the Earthly Realm had been collecting information on the components of the Beast God Weapon for a thousand years, and they had finally found it.

“The MO Luo Kingdom, in the hands of the Crown Prince Luo Sha, there seems to be a component of the Eternal Beast God Weapon, the Candle Dragon Arm.

Power at the tier 4 of Emperor.”

“In the Northern Region of the Heavenly Realm, a successor has appeared, confirmed to possess the Candle Dragon Claw! Strength capable of killing a tier 1 Emperor.”

“In the God’s Tomb, a Special Life Form harbors the Beast God Heart within!

Peak strength.”

Seeing these three pieces of information, Jian Wushuang revealed a look of astonishment.

He hadn’t expected them to actually find it.

In addition to information from the Earthly Realm, news from other secret realms had also arrived. It seemed to be the will of that divine spirit.

The one in the Heavenly Realm should be the Dao Lord Si Tian, and this could be considered useless information.

As for the one in the God’s Tomb, the person with peak combat strength and the Beast God Heart, extracting it would require killing the opponent and dissecting them.

If he wasn’t discovered by the other party, it would be considered lucky. Even with the support of the leading organization, he couldn’t make a move against the other party and could only wait for the future.

Peak strength was something he had witnessed and heard about from Bai Junwang.

Bai Junwang in his prime possessed peak strength. Perhaps, after helping Bai Junwang recover his peak strength, he could confront that Special Life Form. The only thing he could currently snatch away was the item in the hands of the Crown Prince of the MO Luo Kingdom.

“Facing a tier 4 Emperor, it was getting a bit tricky. It seemed like some arrangements were in order. Since Great Xia was preparing for a military expedition against the MO Luo Kingdom, it presented an opportunity!’

Bai Junwang floated up, revealing his sinister countenance, and said in a cold voice, “Someone familiar has arrived!”

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows, naturally stowing away his treasures. He turned his head toward the direction of the entrance. Though he couldn’t see anyone, he sensed the presence of someone from the outside, someone with deep karmic ties.

“Hu Qing?”

“How did he end up here!”

He immediately stood up.

Fortunately, sensing that presence, Hu Qing headed towards Tianzi No.l and didn’t pay much attention to this side.

Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief; he thought Hu Qing had discovered his identity and had been following him all the way here, Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Although his strength had increased significantly, Hu Qing was no slouch either; he had reached the Perfected level.

He was a practitioner of the Ultimate Dao, and at the very least, he was at the eighth level.

Currently, he was still refining himself in the outside world, apparently planning to break through only after thoroughly perfecting the Ultimate Dao.

After spending a hundred years at the Grave God Mountain, this group of inheritors descended the mountain to undergo trials and accept various tasks.

Over the years, he had encountered many acquaintances.

On the Tianbei Continent, he had crossed paths with Wan Xing, whose strength had improved rapidly.

Back then, when he saw Wan Xing and Ji Chaoyang together, they both possessed the power to slay Emperors.

There was also the Dao Lord Leng Shuang, who had now broken through to become an Emperor.

Among their group of Grand Yan Immortals, many had broken through to become Emperors.

Once they broke through, they were at the peak of the tier 3 Emperor, each of them potential seeds for tier 5 Emperors.

There was also Jiu Yan; he was now an Emperor. As the oldest Dao Lord, after breaking through, he directly stepped into the tier 4 Dao Lord, taking four steps in success as soon as he successfully combined the Dao.

When they first met, it was in the ruins of a sect, and seeing the brilliance of the other party, he couldn’t help but feel envious.

They all had a bright path to follow.

As for himself, he felt like a rat, never daring to see the light of day.

After settling back down, Jian Wushuang took out other treasures—exotic flowers and fruits that enhanced divine bodies. These items were sufficient to boost his divine body to 8,000 times its base strength.

Over the years, he had further elevated his divine body by 2,000 times, reaching a total of 7,000 times.

These treasures could add another 1,000-fold increase to his divine body.

He was approaching the 10,000-fold baseline for his divine body.

With the Beast God Realm, he could only go up to 10,000-fold, and it was no longer of much use to him unless the old man with goat horns refined the Beast God Origin Source for him.

He didn’t trust that divine spirit much. Initially, the divine spirit had offered to help him refine the Beast God Origin Source, but Jian Wushuang had declined.

Deep down, he still harbored a slight hope. As long as he could separate from Bai Junwang, he could head to the Grave God Mountain—his true destination.

He didn’t want to spend his entire life in the Qishen Temple.

Breaking through to Emperor level at the Grave God Mountain would at least grant him some freedom, allowing him to venture into the outside world at any time,

However, the journey to the restoration of Bai Junwangs origin source was still a bit far, and there were complications with the divine body and physical form afterward.

While he didn’t need to search for the treasures for the divine body, the fleshly shell of the divine body still required the sacrifice of many cultivators.

The Ultimate Blood Crimson.

It wasn’t easily refined.

For someone with formidable strength, it might be achievable, but for him, a Dao Lord host, it was too challenging.

He sat cross-legged on the comfortable throne, quietly breaking through his divine body.

In Room Tianzi One.

“Hu Qing, it’s been a long time!” Prince Xia Mangjun exclaimed warmly.

He had known Hu Qing for hundreds of years.

The first time they met, he had just broken through, and Hu Qing was still a

Dao Lord, coming to challenge him. At the time, he thought the other party had lost his mind and was prepared to kill him casually. To his surprise, the challenger turned out to be an acquaintance of the current national teacher, so he gave face and engaged in a mutual exchange of knowledge.

But what surprised everyone was that he actually lost, and he lost thoroughly.

Defeated by a Dao Lord.

Fortunately, there weren’t many witnesses at the time, and strict orders were given to keep it quiet, preventing the news from spreading. Otherwise, Hu Qings name would have resounded throughout the entire realm.

This was the inheritor—a fact he learned from the Patriarch. Intrigued, he sought to make connections, not solely because of the background but also because Hu Qings strength alone was enough to garner anyone’s attention..
