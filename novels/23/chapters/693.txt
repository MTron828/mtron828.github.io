Chapter 694: Xuan Yi’s Exhortations

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In a vacant area in the Dao Palace was a table, where Jian Wushuang, Feng, Huo Ying, Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang were sitting.

Because they were all from the Ancient World and had been brought into the Ancient Sect by Xuan Yi at the same time, they were always gathered together to enjoy drinking wine and chatting.

From time to time, some disciples went passing by those six, and most of them would also cast their eyes on Jian Wushuang while talking in a low voice.

“It’s incredible that Jian Wushuang, a Skyscraping Realm disciple, can get into the Eternal Zone at this time.”

“Yeah. Have you ever seen anyone in that realm succeed in completing an Earth-level Task?”

“No. Even I, having reached the Divine Realm a long time ago, would not accept such a task.”

The first time the sect announced that Jian Wushuang could go into the Eternal Zone, there was a lot of doubt if he was qualified to do so. But soon after that, when those skeptics learned that he had completed an extremely hard Earth-level Task, they shut up.

After all, in this word, the stronger one could talk louder.

Generally, the tasks at the Earth Level should be assigned to advanced Divine Realm experts, and it was always uncertain if they could complete them. That is to say, anyone who could complete them was at least no weaker than those advanced experts.

That being said, Jian Wushuang’s power and talent were beyond doubt.

“Listen Jian Wushuang, there are so many people talking about you,” Huo Ying said to him with a smile.

“It has been eight years since we six entered the sect, and now the best ones among us are you and Feng.” Bing Shan echoed in a tone of admiration.

“I’m no match for him.” Feng shook his head at those words while looking toward Jian Wushuang.

He had lost all his desire to catch up to him because he knew that this man had made it to the 30th floor of Ninth Heaven Road in the Sect Competition.

He had been left far behind, and he knew that himself.

“Hold it, guys. Let’s just enjoy drinking.” Jian Wushuang grinned while holding up his cup of wine.

While the other four were drinking, Feng and Jian Wushuang suddenly paused.

The former looked at the latter and asked, “You have also received a message, haven’t you?”

“Yeah. It’s time to go now.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then turned to the other four. “Guys, Feng and I gotta to go now. Please enjoy your time even without us.”

Huo Ying replied to them with concern, “Ok. I heard that the Eternal Zone is quite dangerous, please take care and good luck to both of you.”

“We will, and thank you.” Jian Wushuang and Feng rose up and headed out.

“Swish! Swish!”

Jian Wushuang and Feng arrived in front of the huge wormhole in the Ancient Sect at the same time, and soon afterward, Liu Chong, Situ Yi, Luo Yong, and Dong’er arrived as well.

“Are you Jian Wushuang?” asked a man dressed in purple with a ferocious aura, looking at Jian Wushuang.

That man was Situ Yi. He wore a gentle smile despite his aura. “Finally, I can see the great genius of our sect with my own eyes.”

Jian Wushuang returned his smile. He could tell that he was an outgoing man.

Being a striking contrast to that man, Liu Chong, a red-haired youth, looked quite indifferent.

At that moment, he was also looking at Jian Wushuang, and his eyes full of a strange feeling met with his.

“This boy…”?he could not help thinking,?“the others only know that he finished an Earth-level Task, they don’t know that he has also killed a superior Divine Realm expert.”?

Liu Chong was the exact man who had taken Xuan Yi’s order to keep Jian Wushuang safe in secret. By that chance, he had witnessed how Jian Wushuang had killed Hu Hu, thus, he knew Jian Wushuang better than the others did.

“Jian Wushuang.” The youth finally spoke out. “A question has confused me for quite a while, in terms of your cultivation in the Dao, you should have reached the Divine Realm, so why are you still stuck in the Skyscraping Realm?”

This question aroused the interest of the other four as well. They all looked at Jian Wushuang, waiting for his answer. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was true that Jian Wushuang was powerful enough to break through to the Divine Realm.

“Well…” For some time, Jian Wushuang could not find any more words to answer the question.

Right then, several whooshing sounds reached them along with some figures.

Of these eight newcomers, seven of them were Masters of the Dao Palace, including Palace Master Mo Tao, Palace Master Baiyu, and Palace Master Destruction, who was also Feng’s master. The Vice Master of the Sword Palace, Ling Yu, was also among them.

The Eternal Zone was a place of great opportunities, and the disciples of the sects would have adventures in its outer layer while those experts who had reached the Eternal Realm would try their luck in its inner layer.

“Everyone has arrived. Let’s go.”

Just as Palace Master Destruction gave the order, the wormhole in front of them was immediately activated.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and waited for the journey to being, and right at that moment, he surprisingly received a message from his master, Xuan Yi.

“Wushuang, you’re on your way to the Eternal Zone, but remember that you must be careful after you get there.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Xuan Yi then continued with a laughing voice, “Look, besides the danger that lies in the zone, you should also watch your back when dealing with the people from the three magnates and other sects.”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Why did master say this to me?”

At that point, he was suddenly hit by an idea.

“There are always competitions between all the sects. Could it be that they all want to eliminate the geniuses of other sects with this chance?”

He had experienced such kind of things before, so he was able to figure it out quickly.

“Master, I’ll be careful and remember every single word you said,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“In the Eternal Zone, all connections with the outside are cut, no message can leave there. Therefore, even if you really run into danger someday, I can’t be there for you in time, so you’ll be all on your own,” Xuan Yi added.

“I understand, master.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“Let’s set off now.” Palace Master Destruction’s voice interrupted their conversation.

Jian Wushuang immediately walked into the wormhole with the others.
