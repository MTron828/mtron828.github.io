Chapter 2467: Knelt Down

“What a surprise! It was indeed born.”

Someone finally broke the silence on the court and it was the blood-clothed woman.

“I thought that Xuan Yi’s plan was nothing but a fantasy and impossible to achieve, but...” The white-robed bald man seemed pleased. “I’ve belittled him.”

“Now, it’s useless to talk about that. The top priority is to immediately find and destroy it. The will of Heaven Way mentioned otherwise it will destroy everything in the world,” said the purple-armored devil.

“The will of Heaven Way can sense its existence, but it’s a pity that someone had deceived the will of Heaven Way, making the will of Heaven Way confused on its exact location. The Ancient God Domain is huge. How shall we look for it?

The four of them fell silent.

Indeed, the Ancient God Domain was ridiculously huge.

They were assuming ‘it’ which was just born should not be strong, it could perhaps just be only a Divine Demon.

Even though the four of them had psychic abilities, it was still impossible to find a Divine Demon in the vast Ancient God Domain.

“It’s good if it’s in Third Heaven. However, if it is somewhere outside the Third Heaven in that endless territory, we’ll never be able to find it no matter how influential we are. That’s unless it one day sets foot in Third Heaven and shows its power, will we be able to track it down and kill it,” said the cold and beautiful woman.

“In that case, let’s just wait. It was born with its own mission. For that mission, it will one day set foot on Third Heaven,” said the purple-armored devil reassuringly.

The other two figures nodded in agreement.

With that, the four figures disappeared into thin air.

On the boundless dojo, the white-robed bald man on the high platform opened his eyes again. He kept that smile on his face and continued preaching.

In the eternal burning flames, the purple-armored devil continued his cultivation.

In a beautiful Manor, the blood-clothed woman continued enjoying the services of her male servants.

And in that bloodied space.

The cold and beautiful woman slowly waved and called out, “Apprentice...”

On the battlefield ahead, countless cultivators responded to her voice and stopped fighting.

The veiled woman immediately walked over from the center of the battlefield.

“Master,” addressed the veiled woman respectfully.

“Let me tell you, that person...has appeared,” said the cold and beautiful woman.

The veiled woman was shaken by the news as her eyes flashed eagerly with the thirst to kill.

“Jian Wushuang!”

The veiled woman balled up her fists. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

...

In Saint’s Tomb, the various sects’ genius disciples were still overwhelmed by shock as what just happened was unheard of.

The life rating pressure which flooded every corner of the tomb finally began to slowly fade away.

Those genius disciples breathed sighs of relief when they noticed the pressure was being lifted.

On the other hand, the Crimson Stone Saint’s complexion was grave and solemn in the hidden independent space.

When the pressure had fully subsided, Crimson Stone Saint could move freely once again and the first thing he did was to wave his hand.

There was a loud rumbling noise.

A huge space-time wormhole gradually appeared in the void right above the tomb.

Big hands appeared then out of thin air in every corner of Saint’s Tomb next to those genius disciples. The big hands acted fast as it grabbed those disciples and threw them into the space-time wormhole.

“Is this a sign for us to leave?”

Those disciples quickly got the message.

Some of those disciples did not resist and left. There were some disciples who were still in the Divine Power Ocean tried struggling as they wanted to absorb more Ancient God Divine Power but their struggles were futile.

“No, I still have Purple Amulets. My time’s not up yet. How can you send me away?”

“Stop it!”

“Just give me half a month’s time. I’ll be able to make a breakthrough!”

Those low groans and moans resounded at every corner of Divine Power Ocean. Yet, those big hands did not give them a chance. Those disciples were caught and mercilessly thrown into the wormhole.

Those Second-Class and First-Class Divine Demons’ struggles were in vain.

In just a few moments, all those genius disciples were sent out of Saint’s Tomb.

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and the rest were also included.

Jian Wushuang was the only one left in the Divine Power Ocean.

Hum...

A faint black air current condensed on the Divine Power Ocean’s surface right in front of Jian Wushuang. A vague figure appeared in front of him in the next second.

That vague figure was none other than Crimson Stone Saint himself.

“Young man!”

The second time Crimson Stone Saint appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, his expression was completely different from before.

The last time he appeared, he looked absolutely confident and aloof.

Back then, he thought that no matter how talented Jian Wushuang was, he was only a young Chaotic Realm brat.

Crimson Stone Saint now dismissed that thought.

He studied Jian Wushuang, not wanting to miss a microexpression but it was a pity that he still failed to see through Jian Wushuang.

Besides, Jian Wushuang had already gone through a series of transformations with his soul and body cells elevated to a whole new level.

He had successfully transformed into a complete Perfect Chaotic Creature.

Jian Wushuang’s eyelids finally moved as he slowly opened his eyes.

The moment his gaze landed on Crimson Stone Saint...

Hum!

The magnificent pressure from his life rating came in full force.

Previously, the pressure was swept across all directions, rendering those present in the tomb to worship Jian Wushuang. However, this pressure solely fell on Crimson Stone Saint the second time.

Pop!

Without any warning, Crimson Stone Saint’s knees heavily hit the Ocean’s surface.

An Undying Saint was forced to kneel down under the pressure!

“How is this possible!”

Crimson Stone Saint flushed red as he protested from the bottom of his heart.

Although technically, he appeared in the form of consciousness, he was after all still an Undying Saint.

He had experienced some terrifying situations before his death when he was being terrorized and had to give up any idea of resisting or fighting, but he had never been forced to kneel down under any pressures. Never!

He was surprised...to only find that he could not move at all when he struggled desperately to pull himself up.

There were momentary thoughts that perhaps he should kneel down before the person in front of him.

On the other hand, the person in front of him was a young man who had just made it into the Divine Demon Realm!
