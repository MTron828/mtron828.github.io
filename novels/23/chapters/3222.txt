Silence!

When the man in a long robe with a green staff on his back appeared at the end of the crowd, it was completely silent.

A deathly silence!

Everyone’s eyes widened as they looked at this person in shock.

If the lineup of the Nine Palace Saintess, Silver Wolf, Thunder God, Gu Zhenzi, and Wan Xuan had shocked them, then the appearance of this long-robed man…made everyone shudder from the depths of their hearts!

The Light King, number one on the true Saint Rankings!

The publicly acknowledged number one expert among the Invincible Saints of this era.

He actually came personally!

And it was very obvious that he also belonged to the camp of the three great saint domains!

The lineup of the Nine Palace Saintess, Silver Wolf, Thunder God, Gu Zhenzi, Wan Xuan, and the already incomparably terrifying five people, plus a Light King?

What did it mean?

…

In the void, the six people of the Temporal Temple stood together and saw the people coming.

When they saw the lineup, even Jian Wushuang and Di Hao, who were in the state of mind, felt a surge of emotions.

“The top Immortal Saints of the three Saint Realms are all here, plus the more terrifying Light King and Nine Palace Saintess?” Qian Hongzi widened his eyes and looked terrified. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Are they coming for us?” Duan Lang was also shocked.

As for Jian Wushuang, his face was extremely gloomy.

He had guessed that once the three Saint Realms knew that he was in the Blood Wave Realm, they would definitely try to kill him. However, the Blood Wave Realm was too special, even the three Saint Realms could not send experts with the battle strength above the Principles Master Realm. Therefore, the biggest possibility was for the Immortal Saints of the three Saint Realms to attack him in the Blood Wave Realm.

He was mentally prepared for these experts of the three great Saint Realms. Even if all the experts of the three great Saint Realms charged at him, he would not be surprised. However, the appearance of the Light King and the Nine Temples Saintess…was indeed beyond his expectations.

Especially the Light King.

Even he admired this expert who had fused two different principles at the level of the Immortal Saint and had a certain level of attainments in the soul. But now, the other party had charged in front of him.

“What should we do? We can’t fight against such a lineup,” Qian Hongzi said directly.

Everyone in the Temporal Temple fell silent, including Di Hao.

Indeed, if they had the chance to fight against the combined forces of the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusionary Moon Sect, then the lineup in front of them was not something they had a chance to fight against. Just the Light King alone…brought them incomparable pressure.

“Everyone, do you remember what I said before?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the five people around him.

The five people were stunned.

Of course, they remembered.

Jian Wushuang had said before that once the opponent’s line-up was so strong that they had no chance to fight back, he would let the five of them escape first and leave them alone.

“Later, do as I say. As long as there’s a chance, you should leave quickly. Don’t hesitate,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“Understood.” The five of them nodded silently.

At this time, the people from the three Saint Realms had also appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the other six.

The two sides were less than a few hundred meters away from each other, facing each other from a distance.

Seeing this scene, the hundreds of experts in this space-time immediately understood.

“The top experts of the three Saint Realms, including the Light King and the Nine Temples Saintess, are coming to the Temporal Temple!”

“That’s right. In this Temporal Temple, no other force has such an incredible lineup.”

“The top experts of the three Saint Realms alone are terrifying. With the Light King and the Nine Temples Saintess, the people of the Temporal Temple are doomed.”

Many people secretly sighed.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

A cold voice came out of Thunder God’s mouth. His eyes were cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang and said, “You were lucky to escape from the previous battle. But this time, try to escape from us again!”

“Haha, Thunder God, you must be joking. The three Saint Realms spent so much effort this time, especially invited Light King and Nine Temples Saintess, and Gu Zhenzi’s magic array to seal the time and space. If he, a rank six True Saint, escapes, the three Saint Realms will become a joke.” Silver Wolf smiled.

It was obvious that Silver Wolf had absolute confidence in this attack, so he was still in the mood to joke around.

He was not the only one. The other experts of the three Saint Realms were also in the same situation.

There was no other way. In the current situation, not to mention Jian Wushuang was only a rank six True Saint, even a powerful expert on the True Saint List would find it difficult to survive.

While the three Saint Realms were chatting and laughing, Jian Wushuang also spoke, “I have indeed underestimated the three Saint Realms. I didn’t expect that you could even invite the Light King and the Nine Temples Saintess. I heard that the Light King is arrogant, while the Nine Temples Saintess is high and mighty. She seldom deals with the various forces, but now it seems that this is not the case.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are wrong. It’s true that the Light King and I rarely interacted with other forces, but nothing is absolute. The three Saint Realms offered conditions that neither I nor the Light King could refuse, so naturally, we will also help.” The Nine Temples Saintess said with a faint smile.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and then nodded secretly.

Indeed, in this world, profit was the most important thing.

“The top experts of the three Saint Realms who are ranked on the True Saint List have all arrived. In addition to the two Saintesss’, Light King and Nine Temples Saintess, it seems that it’s impossible for me to escape from you today.” Jian Wushuang sighed, it seemed that he already knew that he was going to die, but at this moment, he suddenly changed the topic. “I’m the only one you want to kill. It doesn’t matter if I die, but the five people around me should have nothing to do with this. I wonder if you can let them leave first.”

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Silver Wolf, Thunder God, and Gu Zhenzi looked at each other.

“Sure.” Silver Wolf nodded directly.

Their real target was Jian Wushuang. As for Di Hao and the others, they wanted to kill them, but Light King and Nine Temples Saintess were not willing to do so, so they had no choice.

Since they could not leave Di Hao and the others behind, they might as well let them go. It would save them a lot of trouble.

“Five of you, please leave first.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the five people beside him.

“Brothers of the Heavenly Marquis.”

Qian Hongzi, Duan Lang, Yue Yu, and Feixue all had ugly expressions on their faces. They looked at Jian Wushuang deeply and thought of what Jian Wushuang had said before. The four of them turned around and left. As for Di Hao, he did not move.
