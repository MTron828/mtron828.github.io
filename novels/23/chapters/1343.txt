Chapter 1344: Duan Lingfeng

On the bald man’s face, there was a strange pattern while the youth was obviously staring at that pattern.

The bald man who was cultivating seemed to notice the youth and he opened his eyes to glare at the youth with his cold stare. The rage in his eyes terrified the youth as the youth moved backwards.

Then, there was a lady in red who walked forward and embraced the youth as she apologized, “I’m sorry, my brother didn’t intend to disturb your cultivation.”

“Universe Master?”

The bald man stole a glance at the lady in red and there was a stroke of coldness on his face, “Who brought the two Universe Masters on board? Doesn’t he know how dangerous the Ancient Star Sea is? How could he bring two Universe Masters to drag us down?”

The bald man was very loud and everyone on the deck stared.

When they saw the lady in red and the strong, honest youth, their facial expressions changed.

They could tell that the lady in red was merely a Universe Master while the strong honey youth was just an eleven year old kid who had only just started cultivation. There was not much power, to begin with.

They were going to go through the Ancient Star Sea which would be very dangerous. Hence, the threshold to join the troop was to be a Universe God in the First Heaven.

But the lady in red and the youth were obviously just Universe Masters, how could they join the troop?

“Who brought them up? Hurry up. Otherwise, I shall kick them off the ship directly,” the bald man bellowed and his voice traveled across the spaceship.

Just then, the cabin’s door suddenly opened and there was a figure that moved out slowly.

It was a young man in a white robe who was carrying a saber. He had long brown hair, sleepy eyes, slender body, and a cold manner. He looked dignified and dauntless.

The young man in white robe walked before the bald man and looked down in his eyes, “I brought the two of them up, do you have an opinion?”

The young man in the white robe looked calm, but with every word he uttered, his aura grew stronger. When he finished his sentence, his aura was at a terrifying level which suppressed the bald man. The bald man’s face was distorted, he opened his mouth but he couldn’t say a word.

“Brother Duan,”

The lady in red pulled the young man in white robe’s sleeve and his aura slowed down slightly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Humph!”

The young man in white robe humped. Then, he looked at the lady in red and the youth, and said, “Let’s go into the cabin.”

The lady in red nodded and then they returned into the cabin with the youth.

On the deck, a discussion was stirred.

“The one earlier, is one of the Universe God in the Third Heaven in our troop, right?”

“The lady called him Brother Duan means that his surname is Duan. I wonder what his name is.”

“Just now – that person, I know him. He’s called Duan Lingfeng.”

“Duan Lingfeng?”

Everyone immediately looked over.

The Universe God who spat the name Duan Lingfeng slowly started with his story, “Mister Duan Lingfeng is a Universe God in the Third Heaven, but he just underwent his God’s Test in the Third Heaven not long ago. I heard that the movement was not small when he underwent his God’s Test. There were even experts who saw him undergo his God’s Test with their own eyes and said that the God’s Test that he went through was a mind test!”

“Mind test?” Everyone was astonished.

Even Jian Wushuang was stunned when he heard the word ‘mind test’.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, not everyone was qualified to undergo the scariest mind test among the three kinds of God’s Test.

“Under normal circumstances, Mister Duan Lingfeng passed through a mind test, his power definitely would be extremely strong. Unfortunately, he just passed the test not long ago. His divine power has just started to transform to be like a Universe God in the Third Heaven. Hence, I’m afraid he isn’t that strong yet either,” the Universe God continued.

“Is that so?”

“That’s such a pity.”

Everyone continued to chat for a while until the deck finally quiet down again.

When Jian Wushuang heard the people discuss him around him, he remembered the name ‘Duan Lingfeng’.

The spaceship was moving in Ancient Star Sea at a speed that wasn’t too fast nor too slow.

Three years flew past.

In the three years, Jian Wushuang’s troop was rather calm. There wasn’t any danger but merely two interruptions by some exotic beasts.

On the deck.

Wow! Wow! Wow!

There were swift and fierce sword lights.

Very soon, the training ended.

“Brother Wushuang, what do you think about my swordsmanship?”

In three years’ time, the strong, honest youth had grown up quite a bit and he was smiling right before Jian Wushuang.

“Not too shabby. If your foundation of swordsmanship were to be improved, that’d be great,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

In the three years, he had got along with the rest of the troop quite well, especially the youth before him, Luo Hai.

At the beginning, Luo Hai was practicing swordsmanship alone on the deck while Jian Wushuang watched by the side. But when Luo Hai finished practicing, he commented casually. Luo Hai was extremely delighted with his advice. Ever since, Luo Hai had always looked to him for pointers.

“Luo Hai, your Brother Duan is a Universe God in the Third Heaven. You have been by his side all the time. Why didn’t you practice with a saber, only a sword?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Ever since I was born, my sister and I are always with Brother Duan. But Brother Duan never taught me how to use a saber and I don’t like sabers. I prefer swords. I must become a swordsman that travel the universe in the future, just like my father,” Luo Hai said.

“Oh, your father uses swords too?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows as he smiled.

Just then…

“Shriek!”

There was a sharp shrill.

On the spaceship, those who were originally chatting casually, or cultivating were suddenly shaken. Their gazes were cast to the source of the shrill.

They saw a sea of purple torrents surging towards the spaceship at an unusually swift speed. There were sharp shrills among the purple surging torrent.

“That is…”

“It’s a Purple Marten!”

“So many, so many Purple Martens!”

“Quick, turn the direction of the spaceship.”

Raging voices were heard across the spaceship.

Purple Martens were one of the scariest pack exotic beasts in Ancient Star Sea.

Purple Martens had always been hostile to human cultivators. They killed each and every human cultivator without mercy every time they saw one.

Then, there was a pack of Purple Martens before them.

“No way, it’s too late.”

The one who controlled the spaceship was the leader of the troop. The elderly man in a green robe, his face grew grave. He wanted to change the direction of the spaceship as fast as possible but he still couldn’t change it in time.
