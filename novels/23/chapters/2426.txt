Chapter 2427: Long Zishan

Jian Wushuang had stood at the same spot, observing Pang Tao injuring Ling Dan before Zhuo Bing, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong continued with their collaborative attacks after Pang Tao had dispersed them. Despite all that, his face remained incredibly calm and still, but concealed deep in his eyes was a sharp shining beam of light.

Whoosh!

In a flash, Pang Tao had already appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Die, kid!”

Pang Tao’s viciousness was overwhelming and coupled with his terrifying speed, he was about to cut-off Jian Wushang’s head with the sword in his hand.

“Stop!” A sudden yell exploded in the air.

Every single person’s heart trembled as that was a yell that did not allow disobedience.

Even Pang Tao could not help but to stop his motion when hearing that explosive yell.

He looked behind himself and saw a young man in purple armor. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It’s Long Zishan!”

“Third-ranked. One of the Twelve Minor Kings from Great Compassion Sect!”

People around immediately recognized the man in purple armor.

“Senior Brother Zishan?” Pang Tao’s face changed.

If he was someone else, Pang Tao would have completely ignored him. However, Long Zishan was not only his senior brother but also someone he very much respected.

“What are you doing, Pang Tao?” Long Zishan’s expression was stern.

“Senior Brother Zishan, the eighth trial bridge has been broken through by Jian Wushuang. He now possesses the relics that Purple Blood Saint had left behind. I only want to take back what’s rightfully mine,” replied Pang Tao.

“What a joke! The rules have always been such that the relics belong to one with good morals. Purple Blood Saint’s legacy naturally goes to him since the trial has been broken through by this junior brother from Narcissus Island. What do you think you’re doing? Are you trying to rob? Or are you trying to bully others? You’ve embarrassed all of us in the Great Compassion Sect.” Long Zishan did not save Pang Tao’s face at all as he scolded him in front of everyone.

“Senior Brother Zishan.” Pang Tao’s face was filled with dissatisfaction. He also felt a little angry inside and was ready to express it.

“Step back immediately.” Long Zishan quietly growled, but secretly gave Pang Tao a look.

Pang Tao understood the signal and stepped back, even though he was not satisfied.

Seeing that Pang Tao had listened to him, Long Zishan sighed in relief and immediately looked over at Jian Wushuang with his attitude becoming a lot warmer. “You must be Junior Brother Wushuang from Narcissus Island? My hot-headed Junior Brother Pang Tao recklessly took action just now. Sorry for offending you, here’s an Interspatial Ring with plenty of elixirs inside it. Please take it as a token of apology. We hope you and all the friends from Narcissus Island will forgive us.”

Long Zishan tossed over an Interspatial Ring that he had prepared towards Jian Wushuang as he was speaking.

Jian Wushuang grabbed the ring but did not look inside it. He deeply looked at Long Zishan with a strange light in his eyes.

All those disciples around started praising him in their minds.

Among the four Minor Kings in the Great Compassion Sect, Long Zishan was considered the most mild-mannered and enjoyed the highest acclaim.

His appearance today proved the saying to be true.

Long Zishan was a very reasonable person judging from his apologetic actions. He was also a very good representative of the Great Compassion Sect, causing everyone to feel a sense of respect towards them.

However, Pang Tao’s expression was extremely uneasy. He did not say anything but had already sent a message through his token and asked Long Zishan.

“Senior Brother Zishan, what’s happening here?” Pang Tao was slightly puzzled.

Long Zishan secretly replied to him, “Junior Brother, you have gone a little overboard today. It’s true that the Great Compassion Sect is the largest sect in Wusha Wilderness—the most powerful existence. We can usually do whatever we want in Wusha Wilderness and others would’ve let us have our way even though we’re being a little reckless. They would even swallow their pride to not offend us, but that’s also on the basis that we could find certain excuses or reasoning on our side.”

As for today, if you found even just a little bit of reasoning or excuses, you could’ve done whatever you wanted. Even if you killed Jian Wushuang, so be it. You could’ve even killed Zhong Yi of Narcissus Island and Ling Dan of Ancient Star Temple without fear and the Great Compassion Sect would back you up after you’ve done it. The problem here is that you’re obviously being unreasonable.”

The eighth trial bridge’s challenge was broken through by Jian Wushuang with his very own abilities, and now you’re asking for what he has earned. That’s simply robbery. In addition, you’re being so reckless in front of everyone. At this moment, a few Elders from Narcissus Island outside have already reached Senior Brother Tu Qiancheng and a few of our Elders, questioning the thieving behavior of Great Compassion Sect’s disciples. Our Elders from the Great Compassion Sect understood that we’re in the wrong and could not give a convincing answer, hence the reason they sent me here to stop you.”

“Is that so?” Pang Tao finally understood.

He knew that Senior Brother Zishan was usually more conniving and often acted as unreasonable as they were, sometimes even more reckless. Senior Brother Zishan had always let him be, but he was there to represent the sect and scolded him in front of so many people.

“Listen, Junior Brother Pang Tao, as long as we have reasons or excuses, you can do whatever you want. That’s the Great Compassion Sect’s way of being. However, if what you do doesn’t come with a reason and was simply because you want to destroy someone, that’s fine as well. However, you will have to do it in the dark and not out in public. You can’t be so careless, especially right before all these sects. Do you understand?” Long Zishan advised.

“Understood, Senior Brother ZIshan, but that Jian Wushuang...” Pang Tao still did not feel satisfied.

“You fool, you definitely can’t kill him in front of so many people, but you can always wait a little while. When the six positions appear, all disciples from every sect would definitely try to frantically fight for it. It would be a bloodbath at that time and you wouldn’t have to worry anymore. Wouldn’t it be easier to kill Jian Wushuang then?” Long Zishan giggled.

Pang Tao felt a little excited inside. “Yes, yes. Now I understand. When we’re in the midst of a battle, I’ll stand by Jian Wushuang and wait for my chance. If Jian Wushuang was also going to fight for a position, I’ll kill him with the most thorough methods. Even if he doesn’t partake in the competition, I could still find ways to push him into the battlefield which would be merciless at that point. Narcissus Island probably wouldn’t dare to say much if I ‘accidentally’ killed him then. At most, I would apologize to them afterward.”

“Apologize? Since it’s on the battlefield, getting killed in chaos would only be due to his own inadequacy. Why the need to apologize?” Long Zishan sneered frostily.

Pang Tao’s anger was completely under control after hearing what Long Zishan had said.

He raised his head again and looked at Jian Wushuang with his icy-cold eyes.
