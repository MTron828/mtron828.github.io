Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu didn’t know if they should cry or laugh.

If they were to know that Jian Wushuang was that powerful, they, of course, wouldn’t need to flee.

Most importantly, Jian Wushuang had never once showed his power.

Although they heard that he had killed Real God Cheng Tian and Real God Shi Gu, no one showed the fight after all, nor did anyone know how Jian Wushuang or what measure Jian Wushuang took to kill the two Real Gods. Hence, his power was still a mystery.

Until then, when Jian Wushuang had put his true power on display.

The moment he revealed it, it shocked heaven and earth.

“Let’s go then,” Jian Wushuang said.

Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu exchanged a look and followed Jian Wushuang as he left.

From the beginning until the end, Jian Wushuang’s expression had been fairly calm.

To him then, the top Chaotic Real Gods were not challenging at all. Forget if there were ten top Chaotic Real Gods who teamed up, even if there were twenty, he could easily massacre them. He naturally wouldn’t be smug with success with his battle achievements.

He didn’t care, but the others cared.

Ten top Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace besieged Jian Wushuang and he massacred nine Real Gods directly in less than a breath’s time with his power alone. The news immediately transformed into a shocking storm and swept across the entire Sanctuary Alliance.

In Sanctuary Alliance, all forces and solo experts knew that Soaring Heaven King Palace and Lineage of Star were going to fight long ago. Hence, they were anticipating the result too.

However, when the news about the fight spread, the experts in Sanctuary Alliance were dumbfounded.

No one had expected that Jian Wushuang would be able to massacre nine top Real Gods with his power alone.

There was no one who expected that Jian Wushuang’s power would have increased at such a large scale in merely a hundred years. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It was simply unbelievable!

To Soaring Heaven King Palace, the bad news hit them like a thunderbolt.

Their original intention in the fight had been to show dignity and serve as a deterrent force to all forces. But in the end, they had suffered such a great loss.

Even though, among the nine top Chaotic Real Gods, there were seven solo experts who were hired by Soaring Heaven King Palace. Soaring Heaven King Palace had lost two of their Chaotic Real Gods. To Soaring Heaven King Palace, it was a great loss. On top of that, in addition to those that Jian Wushuang had killed earlier, they had suffered an even greater loss.

Soaring Heaven King Palace Master was furious. “Jian Wushuang has to die. We have to split his dead body. Then, we will be able to wash away the humiliation of Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

“Where’s Han Quan? Tell him to hurry up and rush over immediately!”

…

In the core region of the Eighth Lair, Jian Wushuang continued to plunge forward in the void casually while Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu followed behind him.

“Real God Ling Xie continued to follow us. It seems that Soaring Heaven King Palace didn’t plan to end just like that?” Real God Duan Yan glanced the far void.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace has always been barbaric. They suffer such a great loss from me. How could they just let me off the hook?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Jian Wushuang, you know that Soaring Heaven King Palace will continue to send experts to come and kill you but you travel so slowly in the void. Even I am wondering if you are intentionally waiting for the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace to catch up,” Real God Huan Yu suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s actions were really strange.

Ever since he had revealed himself, he had been acting strange.

If the other experts were to know that Soaring Heaven King Palace, such a major force, was after them, they would definitely opt to run away at the first instant. They would seize the time to return to Lineage of Star or Thunderbolt Island. If so, no matter how capable Soaring Heaven King Palace was, they couldn’t do anything.

But how about Jian Wushuang?

He had been walking in the core region casually and at a slow speed. As though he was taking a casual stroll in his backyard, he was not worried at all.

That was, of course, abnormal.

“Jian Wushuang, what’s going on?” Real God Duan Yan looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“Jian Wushuang smiled without concealing it. “I am a person who makes a clear distinction between kindnesses and wrongs. As I am already fighting against Soaring Heaven King Palace, I might as well fight till the end. Until they are willing to yield, admit defeat, or even be exterminated. Soaring Heaven King Palace wanted to show dignity through me, right? I happen to want to kill them.”

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

It was true. Jian Wushuang had done it on purpose.

Just then, Jian Wushuang stopped his steps. Then, he wore a strange smile on his face.

“Why?” Real God Duan Yan looked.

“Hall Master Yuan sent me a message earlier that Real God Han Quan has entered the Eighth Lair,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Real God Han Quan?” Real God Duan Yan was shocked.

“The eleventh place on Real God ranking list?” Real God Huan Yu was shocked.

Real God ranking list was the same as Universe God ranking list, there was a total of one hundred experts.

They were also made of Chaotic real Gods. However, their fighting powers were far beyond any ordinary top Chaotic Real Gods’.

It was just like Universe Gods on Universe God ranking list. The Real Gods listed on Real God ranking list were those on the top of the pyramid.

Many experts on Real God ranking list were from various forces in Sanctuary Alliance. Of course, they were many solo experts as well. As Soaring Heaven King Palace was one of the top major forces, they naturally had Real Gods listed on Real God ranking list and they had a total of two, which was one more than Lineage of Star had.

One of the two experts on Real God ranking list from Soaring Heaven King Palace was Real God Han Quan. He was extremely high in ranking on the Real God ranking list. He was listed in the eleventh place, extremely close to the top ten super experts.

One should know that Lei Chao from Lineage of Star was ranked twenty places lower in Real God ranking list. Real God Han Quan was slightly stronger than Lei Chao.

“Real God ranking list, the higher their ranking, the scarier they are. Those in the top ten are definitely superb existences of a monstrous level. Although they couldn’t compare to Almighties, they aren’t far from one. Although Real God Han Quan isn’t in the top ten, he is merely one step away. Soaring Heaven King Palace sent him,” Real God Duan Yan looked cold.

“Jian Wushuang, what can we do?” Real God Huan Yu asked solemnly.

“What can we do?” Jian Wushuang smiled. Then, he sat down on the ground, “Don’t panic. We will just wait for him to come here.”

“What?” Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu were astonished.

Jian Wushuang had found out that Real God Han Quan was coming but not only was he not worried, he had sat down directly and waited for his arrival.

Is he trying to…

Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu exchanged a look. The two of them could guess Jian Wushuang’s plan.

From their viewpoint, it seemed a little mad.
