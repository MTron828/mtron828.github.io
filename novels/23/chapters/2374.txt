Chapter 2375: Hundred Flowers Tower

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Qingxiao City, one of the Nine Cities of Luogu Territory.

Hundred Flowers Tower was the most luxurious and busiest place in Qiangxiao City. It was always lit up, regardless of day or night.

Hundred Flowers Tower covered a large area and yet it was always fully occupied by a massive number of practitioners—not less than a thousand people.

All of them gathered in groups of two or three with beautiful ladies as their drinking companions. There were female dancers dancing on the high stage in front.

Hundred Flowers Tower was a place of drinking and merry-making for all the practitioners. A ‘Brothel’ would be how people from the mortal world would call it!

“I didn’t expect this place to be so heated up!”

Xiao Heng, Jian Wushuang, and the rest of the group were also inside the tower. They took up a table while taking in the sight around them.

“It’s quite normal. Luogu Territory is known to be a messy place filled with outlaws of every sort. Naturally, there are many who are interested in sex and the Hundred Flowers Tower is the sort of place built to satisfy these people. From the looks of it, Hundred Flowers Tower’s annual income must be astronomical,” said Xiao Heng.

“The Second Miss of the Mu Clan that we’re looking for, her real name is Mu Xiaoxiao. According to intelligence, she is right here in Hundred Flowers Tower.”

“Since she is here, does that mean she has become...” One of the core disciples could not help but ask. However, he swallowed his last words.

Xiao Heng frowned as well and answered, “No matter what she has become, our mission here is to bring her back to the sect and that’s it. Of course, we need to locate her first.”

The core disciples nodded their heads.

Right at that moment...

“Gentlemen!”

A booming voice was resonating in every corner of Hundred Flowers Tower with the help of divine power.

All patrons in Hundred Flowers Tower who were drinking, merry-making, chatting and laughing suddenly quieted down. They moved their focus onto a woman wearing a silver robe in the middle of the tower.

“Gentlemen, we’re reaching the most important part of the night. Miss Xiao is coming out soon, please keep your eyes open!” The silver-robed lady smiled.

As soon as she finished her speech, the entire tower was filled with continuously thunderous roars, excited screams, and frenzied shouts.

Jian Wushuang and the rest sitting at the table noticed the atmosphere immediately changing into an extremely passionate one.

“Miss Xiao?”

Xiao Heng frowned and pointed at someone on the side. “You, come over!”

It was a Hundred Flowers Tower waiter dressed in black which Xiao Heng was pointed at. As soon as he heard him, the waiter flatteringly went over.

Xiao Heng first took out a few elixir pills from his Interspatial Ring and passed them to the waiter in black. His eyes lit up when the latter took a glance at them.

“I wonder how can I be of service to you, young masters?” The waiter smiled extremely respectfully.

“Let me ask you, who is that ‘Miss Xiao’ the lady mentioned just now? Why did people all go nuts hearing her name?” asked Xiao Heng.

The waiter in black laughed out loud. “That’s all you want to know? I see that it’s your first time being in Hundred Flowers Tower, it might even be your first time being in Qingxiao City. Otherwise, it’s impossible that you’ve never heard of Miss Xiao. She is the number one dancer in Luogu Territory! She is also our centerpiece at Hundred Flowers Tower!”

Every time Miss Xiao appears, she would attract countless practitioners to come and there is no shortage of powerful ones or those with a deep background.”

Please look over there, gentlemen.”

Jian Wushuang and his company followed the direction that the waiter was pointing at and immediately saw a beast-like man who was carrying a battle axe on his back.

The beastman occupied a table all by himself and nobody dared to sit near him either. He was only drinking quietly yet nobody seemed to have the guts to disturb him.

“First-Class Divine Demon? He is unusually powerful too!”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrunk slightly.

He could tell with one glance that the beast-like man was an extremely powerful First-Class Divine Demon. However, when it came to pressure, this man gave a bit more pressure than Wujian toward Jian Wushuang.

“His name is Qing Mo, an expert of great fame in the Luogu Territory. His ability is among the top tier First-Class Divine Demons and is already very close to the level of the nine cities’ governors. Moreover, he is an extremely arrogant man. He doesn’t like to befriend anyone, but since he saw Miss Xiao for the first time half a year ago, he has been sitting here daily, just to wait for Miss Xiao’s appearance.”

“He is simply sitting there and not interacting with anyone or even showing interest in other dancers and beauties here. He is a very strange one,” said the waiter in black.

Jian Wushuang, Xiao Heng, and the rest began to sigh secretly.

“Now look over there, look at that private room on the second floor. There is a restriction for that room. You can’t see the insides, but people there can clearly see everything outside. The one in that private room is the eldest young master of Qingxiao City, whose father is the governor and a Peak Stage Divine Demon!”

“And those gentlemen over there are from the Xu Clan, one of the three big clans of Qingxiao City.”

...

The waiter in black kept on introducing them to the patrons who were major figures not only in Qingxiao City but also in the entire Luogu Territory.

“All these people, they’re here just for Miss Xiao,” said the waiter.

“All these experts with many of them being young masters of extremely huge backgrounds are waiting like dogs, just for that Xiao? Is she really that special?” Xiao Heng frowned. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Whether she is that special, you’ll see it in a moment. Oh, there she is,” said the waiter in black.

As he said that, Xiao Heng, Jian Wushuang, and the rest of their group looked ahead right away.

The Hundred Flowers Tower at that moment broke into a passionate roar.

Countless practitioners had their eyes burning with fire and craze.

All they could see right then was only one person.

It was the woman who slowly floated down from the second floor, like an angel in a painting.

The woman was so slender and perfectly shaped that no one could find any flaws in her.

The most stunning aspect was her aura. It was an unusually unique aura, the kind of charm that was bone-deep. Every move she made could make one forever dream about her.

She floated and landed on the high stage at the center. Only then did she slowly raise her head, but her face was covered with a veil and nobody could see her actual face.

However, just the aura she projected and the way she moved could inspire the wildest fantasies in countless practitioners’ minds.

“This woman...”

Xiao Heng looked quietly at the woman on the high stage and could only helplessly say, “Although her body and aura were flawless, her face is covered after all. I can’t see her face. Besides, even if she is devastatingly beautiful, how is it possible that she could make so many practitioners go crazy about her?”
