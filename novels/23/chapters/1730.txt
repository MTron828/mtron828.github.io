Chapter 1731: The Fish Has Taken The Bait

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Buddhist Demon Sea was a forbidden area to Real Gods.

Even among Almighties, normal Almighties would not dare to go in there easily. It was said that even Emperor Gods could be killed in the deepest part of the Buddhist Demon Sea.

“How can that be? Lei Chao has been travelling the Sixth Lair for so long and it is not as if he does not know about the Buddhist Demon Sea. Why has he gone into the Buddhist Demon Sea?” Jian Wushuang said while frowning.

“Under normal circumstances, Lei Chao would definitely not go to the Buddhist Demon Sea. However, Lei Chao is being chased by someone and he had no choice but to go in,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“He is being chased by someone?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, “Who is it?”

“Old Freak Sui Gu, an extremely powerful Sir God expert who is very ruthless,” Hall Master Gu Xin said: “Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Old Freak Sui Gu fought with the Lineage of Star head-on. At that time, Hall Master Shi Yun and I teamed up to go after him and he almost died by our hands.”

“Ever since that battle, this old bastard remained silent and laid low and he never appeared again. However, who could expect that when he reappeared again, it would actually be in the Sixth Lair. Moreover, he came across Lei Chao by coincidence. If not for Lei Chao using the Secret Skill of Star Palace and the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood to the best of his abilities, there would probably not be an opportunity for him to escape into the Buddhist Demon Sea.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned grave.

He had never heard of the Old Freak Sui Gu before. However, at that time, it was highly possible that Lei Chao had escaped into the Buddhist Demon Sea under his compulsion.

After all, some Sir Gods with weaker abilities would travel deep inside the Sixth Lair and Old Freak Sui Gu was probably one of them. Moreover, it just so happened that he had a huge grudge against the Lineage of Star.

“The Buddhist Demon Sea is unusually dangerous. With Lei Chao’s abilities, under a condition where he has lost his two trump cards, Secret Skill of Star Palace and Secret Skill of Dragon Blood, there is a very low possibility of him surviving. However, fortunately, the space and time of the Buddhist Demon Sea are not completely separated from the outside world. Hence, he can ask for help and the Lineage of Star can still make it in time to save him,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief.

It was lucky that Lei Chao was not killed by Old Freak Sui Gu straight away. Although he had entered the Buddhist Demon Sea, there was still a glimmer of hope for him.

“Lei Chao is an expert of the Lineage of Star and he has contributed greatly to the Lineage of Star. Since there is a glimmer of hope, the Lineage of Star will definitely do its best to save him. However, it’s a pity that the Palace Master has secluded himself in training for the past few years as he is preparing for something and he cannot show himself. Presently, Hall Master Shi Yun is travelling deep inside the Fifth Lair and he is unable to come out at such short notice. Thus, I can only get the two of you to go there,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Leave it to us,” Hall Master Gu Xin nodded her head.

“Back then, Lei Chao took very good care of me. Since something bad has happened to him now, I will do my best to rescue him,” Jian Wushuang said earnestly.

“Go ahead. Remember to be extremely careful,” Hall Master Yuan warned. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang and Hall Master Gu Xin looked at each other. After that, both of them set off immediately.

The two of them did not lose any time. After entering the Sixth Lair, they travelled speedily and arrived outside the Buddhist Demon Sea in the shortest possible time.

“This is the Buddhist Demon Sea?” Jian Wushuang was looking at a mysterious sea area which was completely shrouded in black and dense fog in front of him.

Even though he had never entered the sea area, by just looking from the outside, Jian Wushuang felt terrified.

“Let’s go in.” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and he entered the sea area with Hall Master Gu Xin right away.

After entering the sea area, Jian Wushuang felt a strong corrosive power rushing toward him immediately. The corrosive power came from the black, dense fog which filled the air.

“What a strong corrosive power!” Jian Wushaung revealed a shocked expression.

He could feel how unreasonable the corrosive power was. Under such a corrosive power, a normal Chaotic Real God would probably not last very long and they would die.

Even top Chaotic Real Gods would probably be unable to last for a long period of time.

Although Lei Chao was an expert of the Real God ranking list who ranked above twenty, he would probably die in at most a hundred years’ time if he were to continue staying in the Buddhist Demon Sea.

“Jian Wushuang, as you are only a Real God, are you able to withstand this corrosive power?” Hall Master Gu Xin questioned.

“It would not be a problem for a thousand years. However, if it were any longer than that, it would be hard to say,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Then let’s make the best use of our time,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

The two of them flew toward the front immediately. While flying, Jian Wushuang took out his transmission token.

“Lei Chao, Hall Master Gu Xin and I have arrived in the Buddhist Demon Sea. How are you now?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m sorry. Back then, I was unable to hurry back to participate in the banquet when you took on the role of a Hall Master. But now, I need you to come here to rescue me,” Lei Chao was filled with regret.

“Let’s not talk about that. How is your current situation? Roughly which direction are you in and how long can you last?” Jian Wushuang asked quickly.

“I was chased down by Old Freak Sui Gu and I had no choice but to escape into the Buddhist Demon Sea. However, Old Freak Sui Gu also followed me in and I could only continue to run. Since I was running away madly, I also had no idea where exactly I was. I only know that the place that I am at is a triangular island that is extremely huge,” Lei Chao said.

“A gigantic and triangular island?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted and he looked at Hall Master Gu Xin who was beside him, “Hall Master Gu Xin, do you know that the triangular island existed?”

“I have no idea.” Hall Master Gu Xin shook her head, “The Buddhist Demon Sea is not normal and among the whole Sanctuary Alliance, not many people have travelled inside before. Moreover, the terrain here is extremely peculiar and probably no one knows where that triangular island is.”

“This is going to be troublesome,” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned ugly.

This was the most troublesome.

Both Hall Master Gu Xin and him knew that Lei Chao was trapped in the Buddhist Demon Sea. They also knew that he was in a triangular island. However, since the Buddhist Demon Sea was so huge, who knew where the triangular island was? Moreover, they were also not certain of its direction.

There were also no authenticating objects with them. Hence, they could only rely on luck to find Lei Chao.

“The environment of the Buddhist Demon Sea is peculiar. Although Lei Chao did not say much, I predict that he will probably be unable to last for long. Hence, we need to find him in the shortest possible time. Therefore… Hall Master Gu Xin, shall we split up?” Jian Wushuang suggested.

“Split up?” Hall Master Gu Xin frowned. However, she still nodded her head, “Indeed if the two of us were to split up, there would be a higher chance of us finding him. However, it would be more dangerous. Jian Wushuang, you really have to be careful.”

“You too,” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Gu Xin.

After that, the both of them up split up inside the Buddhist Demon Sea right away. Although they had split up, they were in contact with each other at all times.

At the same time as Jian Wushuang and Hall Master Gu Xin entered the Buddhist Demon Sea, in the inner part of the Buddhist Demon Sea, a figure who was covered in a crimson robe revealed a pair of strange, gray eyes.

“Hehe, the fish… has taken the bait!”
