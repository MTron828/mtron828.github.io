Chapter 1665: Completely Shedding All Pretense Of Cordiality!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Real God Zi Ye, your close-quarters combat abilities are nothing much more than this,” Jian Wushuang’s voice, which was filled with ridicule, could be heard.

Although Real God Zi Ye had a ghastly pale expression, he still stared at Jian Wushuang persistently.

However, all of a sudden, his expression changed fiercely, “This look… an Ancient God!”

“The Ancient God Clan which has been recognized as the number one in close-quarters battles in the Eternal Chaotic World!”

Real God Zi Ye finally knew why he had lost so miserably in a close-quarters battle. It was because of the fact that his opponent was actually an Ancient God.

“Damn it. When Palace Master gave me the task to kill him, not only did he not say that Jian Wushuang possessed the Ancient God Bloodline, he also did not say that Jian Wushuang would be so powerful.” Real God Zi Ye had a gloomy expression, “His close-quarters combat abilities are many times stronger than mine. Moreover, during the clash just now, I was seriously injured and my abilities are affected as a result. If I were to continue fighting with him, it would not be me killing him. Instead, it would be him killing me!”

Without hesitation, Real God Zi Ye made the correct choice right away.

Run!

Real God Zi Ye’s body could be seen changing into a ray of purple arc light and flying into the void far away.

“Haha, why are you in such a rush to leave?”

Jian Wushuang laughed jokingly. As he looked at the direction that Real God Zi Ye was escaping in, he stretched out one of his palms slowly and stuck out a finger.

“Secret Skill… Thunder Attracting Skill!”

Buzz!

A vast amount of Divine Power burst forth.

All of a sudden, the dark universe shook. After that, the dark sky on top of Real God Zi Ye was ripped open.

A ray of crimson light appeared from the void which had been ripped open, and it descended abruptly.

Rumble!

It was a crimson-colored Life Destroying Sacred Thunder and its thunderbolts were as thick as a water bucket. Moreover, it also had frightening power which could destroy the universe.

After the Life Destroying Sacred Thunder descended from the rift, it headed for Real God Zi Ye right away.

Its speed was extremely fast. Moreover, it was obvious that the Life Destroying Sacred Thunder had already locked onto Real God Zi Ye. As such, it was impossible for Real God Zi Ye to dodge the attack.

“This power!”

Real God Zi Ye opened his eyes wide. In addition, he was filled with fear as he had seen the danger of death from the Life Destroying Sacred Thunder.

Real God Zi Ye did not dare to be careless. His body stopped moving and the purple saber in his hands released purple rays of light that were extremely bright.

Rustle~~~ The saber light changed into a river and created a giant purple saber shadow on the void instantly. The purple saber light then headed toward the Life Destroying Sacred Thunder fiercely.

The two attacks clashed head-on.

Bam!

With a loud sound, a giant hole opened up on the void and a huge number of space rifts also spread crazily due to the attacks.

At the center of the big hole, swoosh!

A shooting star, or rather a meteorite, fell toward the ground.

The ‘meteorite’ was still covered with part of the crimson-colored Thunderbolt Power. When it landed on the ground, the ground was smashed into pieces and ten thousand miles of the ground was also charred black by the Thunderbolt Power.

As for Real God Zi Ye, he also fell into the ruins created from the attacks and it was unknown whether he was dead or alive.

“The Thunder Attracting Skill of the Ancient God Clan’s Three Secret Skills is indeed very powerful.” As Jian Wushuang looked at what the crimson thunderbolt had done, his face revealed an apathetic smile.

Although the Thunder Attracting Skill was considered the weakest among the Ancient God Clan’s Three Secret Skills, it was still very powerful, to the point that it was shocking.

Thunder Attracting Skill. What it attracted was the Life Destroying Sacred Thunder.

At that moment, when Jian Wushuang used his full power, he could only attract one Life Destroying Sacred Thunder. However, it was already enough to kill a normal Chaotic Real God easily.

It should be known that when this Secret Skill was honed to its highest level, it would be able to attract thousands upon thousands of Life Destroying Sacred Thunder at the same time. At that time, how would the scene look?

When King Luo Zhen was at his peak, he was able to attract thousands upon thousands of Life Destroying Sacred Thunder at the same time. Hence, if he were to unleash the Secret Skill Thunder Attracting Skill with his full power, even Almighties at the level of the Star Palace Master would be extremely terrified.

At that moment…

Swoosh!

A purple, glittering light rose from the ruins abruptly and it ran away crazily.

“He’s actually not dead yet?” Jian Wushuang frowned. As he looked at Real God Zi Ye who was still escaping, he also realized that Real God Zi Ye’s body was covered with thick Blood Qi, “The Soaring Heaven Blood Law is the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s Secret Skill to save one’s life. Since Real God Zi Ye has unleashed this kind of Secret Skill, it seems like he is really going all-out.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jian Wushuang raised the corners of his mouth and revealed an icy-cold smile, “Even if you go all-out, you will still be unable to escape.”

Buzz!

The Divine Power in Jian Wushuang’s body started to burn. Although the speed of burning was not considered too fast, it would still deplete a great amount of Divine Power.

As for Jian Wushuang, by burning his Divine Power, he unleashed a speed that was ten times faster than normal and chased after Real God Zi Ye.

He did not plan to let Real God Zi Ye go just like that.

“Originally, I had no grudges against the Soaring Heaven King Palace. However, they have found trouble for me again and again.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with a great amount of murderous intent.

Previously, in Thunderbolt Island, the Monster King of the Soaring Heaven King Palace had given him trouble.

After that, in the inner layer of the Eighth Lair, Real God Gu Ying and Real God Xue Ling had teamed up with the intent to kill him and snatch his Grade Three Demon Core away.

Originally, those were selfish motives of the Monster King, Real God Gu Ying and Real God Xue Ling. Therefore, they were unable to represent the whole Soaring Heaven King Palace.

However, at that moment, the Soaring Heaven King Palace had sent Real God Zi Ye intentionally to kill him. With that, the grudge was created.

Jian Wushuang had always been someone who had minded his own business and would not do anything unless someone found trouble for him. Thus, if someone were to find trouble for him, he would pay them back ten times, or even a hundred times more.

It was not his style to be attacked by others continuously and not return the favor.

Since Real God Zi Ye had found his way to Jian Wushuang at that moment, Jian Wushuang would have the courage to keep Real God Zi Ye with him forever.

“Zi Ye, it’s impossible for you to escape!” Jian Wushuang was filled with an enormous amount of murderous intent.

When Real God Zi Ye, who was already seriously injured and in an extremely tragic state, saw Jian Wushuang chasing him, his expression changed greatly and he shouted furiously: “Jian Wushuang, even though I am already seriously injured, you still refuse to stop. Could it be that you really want to shred all pretenses of cordiality with the Soaring Heaven King Palace completely?”

“Shred all pretenses of cordiality? Hmph, when the Soaring Heaven King Palace sent you to kill me, all pretenses of cordiality between us were already shed as things did not take a turn for the better. At this point, you still have the nerve to use the Soaring Heaven King Palace to stop me? This is really funny,” Jian Wushuang sneered. With the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood activated, he could totally catch up with Real God Zi Ye’s speed.

“Damn it!” Real God Zi Ye swore. As he escaped madly, he also took out a token hastily.

“Palace Master, Palace Master, please save me quickly. Jian Wushuang is chasing after me with an intent to kill me!”

“I am already seriously injured and I am unable to unleash my speed completely. Even though I have also used the Soaring Heaven Blood Law, I am still unable to escape from him!”

“Inform, inform the Lineage of Star quickly and get them to order Jian Wushuang to stop. Please do it quickly!!!”

Real God Zi Ye’s voice was extremely sad and shrill.
