Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shang realized this point, which is why he returned from the River of Time to the Original Universe. He meditated in seclusion, comprehending the origin of the Original Universe, and created his own cosmic secret techniques.

“Brother Long Yi, no matter what, these people are Emperors accumulated over countless epochs in my Original Universe. I hope you’ll show them some mercy,” Shang said, his heart carrying the weight of old friendships. Now, engaging in a battle in someone else’s territory, even if Long Yi were to kill a group, Shang had no grounds to object.

Upon hearing this, Long Yi smiled openly. “Rest assured, 1 won’t make things difficult for them. I’ll just find another place for them to stir up trouble.”

These inheritors were not to be arbitrarily killed within the Qishen Temple, especially the Grand Yan Immortal and Yan power cultivators. Even True Spirit couldn’t erase them at will.

Shang nodded, choosing not to say more.

The internal world of the Qishen Temple was vast, a fact Shang had come to understand well.

“By the way, the legacy granted by True Spirit requires a journey to the cycle of rebirth, which is quite dangerous. If you’re not in a hurry, I’ll arrange these Emperors first! ”

“Brother Long Yi, attend to your important matters first. 1 1 m in no rush,”

Shang said with a faint smile.

Long Yi smirked inwardly. Ultimate Emperors were truly different. Looking at the rabble below, what use were these Emperors? The Emperors born within the Qishen Temple were far more numerous. There were hundreds in just his Bloodthirsty Continent, let alone the other major worlds. It’s just that back then, Qishen had established the rule that inheritors had to be selected from the external world.

However, he truly couldn’t see what was so great about the Emperors from the external world. Was it all for the sake of Ultimate Emperors?

The probability seemed too small.

Shaking his head, Long Yi stopped thinking about these matters. He descended, entering the vortex of the battle.

“Freeze! ”

Long Yi simply uttered a word, ‘freeze’, and the surging battlefield came to an abrupt standstill!

Even the tier 5 Emperor couldn’t move, and the endlessly powerful Eternal

Tower stopped in the void, its aura suppressed to the extreme.

“What’s happening?” The experts inside the Eternal Tower were at a loss, their bodies immobilized.

“Look, it’s the envoy from the Qishen Temple!” the sharp-eyed Wanderer Chishui shouted.

Everyone turned to look. Their goal was achieved; they had forced the envoy out. However, the envoys strength was almost unbelievable.

They could withstand the methods of a tier 5 Emperor, but this envoy subdued them and the tier 5 Emperor effortlessly. The envoy even suppressed the entire void, leaving them immobilized.

“Lord God!” the native tier 5 Emperor bowed respectfully.

In the Bloodthirst Continent, Long Yi was a god, and no one could oppose him.

Long Yi e s expression was icy at this moment, a stark contrast to his previous demeanor with Shang.

He hadn’t even moved; a mere thought released numerous native Emperors he had suppressed within the Eternal Tower.

This was the might of a top tier 6 Emperor; not even an Eternal Treasure could defy his will.

“Leave, all of you!” Long Yi glanced at the crowd, his voice cold.

The native Emperors dared not say more; they had initially wanted to complain in front of their Lord God.

“Yes!”

The crowd retreated, including the tier 5 Emperor.

The conflict came to an end, mediated by Long Yi himself.

Long Yi couldn’t be bothered to argue with these Emperors from the Original Universe. He directly moved them to the Original Realm. If these Emperors were recruited by the Qishen Temple in the future, they would serve under him. Now was not the time to deal with them.

“There’s an opportunity hidden here, enough for all of you to contemplate and comprehend!” Long Yi paused and continued, “By the way, this is your

Original Universe’s Grand Yan Immortal’s trial world, not like the Bloodthirst

Continent. Don’t act recklessly here, or you might perish.”

As the people landed, they were initially puzzled by Long Yi’s words. Then, they sensed the weight behind his final sentence. He wasn’t threatening them; he was advising them.

Regarding the Grand Yan Immortal’s trial, they were curious, but it wasn’t their primary concern. If there was a legacy here that could benefit everyone, that was sufficient.

“Thank you, Envoy!” Chishui traveler said respectfully, bowing slightly.

The others understood as well and bowed in gratitude.

After all, they had just witnessed the envoy’s strength. The tier 4 peak Emperors were well aware of the envoy’s power, which far surpassed that of a tier 5 Emperor. The envoy was a pinnacle expert much stronger than all the Original Universe’s elites combined.

These individuals, rare even in the vast River of Time and Space, are now not only visible but also daring to act recklessly in his territory. In the external world, they would have died a hundred times over. Luckily, this is the Qishen Temple.

“Alright, you all shall cultivate here! I will notify you of the specific arrangements later,” Long Yi waved his hand. Then he threw out a token displaying the rankings of Grand Yan Immortals on all the Original Planets. It was the overall ranking of Grand Yan Immortals in the Original Realm.

The rankings were divided into two colors: green and gray.

Green represented the living, and gray represented the fallen.

At first, nobody paid much attention. Even in the mysteries of the Original Universe, there were risks of falling, and internal conflicts occurred within the vast world. For instance, during the grandiose Ancient Era, in the Great Si

Region, the corpses of fallen Grand Yan Immortals could form a continent.

Initially, nobody cared much. However, when the rankings on the token were fully revealed, they were stunned.

The gray names on the entire ranking list were ten times the number of green names.

This meant that 90 percent of the Grand Yan Immortals who entered the Qishen Temple had already fallen, leaving only 10 percent alive.

“Lord Envoy, are you sure that the gray names are all fallen Grand Yan Immortals?” someone asked in disbelief.

Long Yi nodded slightly and said in a cold voice, “Yes, they have fallen. So cherish the present moment; the struggle among Grand Yan Immortals is much crueler than you can imagine.”

He was right. In less than ten years, the Qishen Temple hadn’t granted anything to these Grand Yan Immortals, and yet, nine-tenths of them had perished.

These Emperors had done nothing; they had stirred up chaos in the Bloodthirst Continent and obtained a monumental inheritance, a stroke of immense luck even in the River of Time and Space.

“You all shall cultivate here diligently!” Long Yi’s voice fell, and his figure disappeared into the void, leaving the crowd behind.

However, right after he vanished, the void outside trembled, and two tier 5 Emperors appeared above. They glanced at the people below and gradually vanished into the void.

These two were envoys from the Azure Dragon Temple, responsible for overseeing these Emperors. It was an arrangement Long Yi had made. Long Yi returned to the Bloodthirst Continent at this moment and headed toward the fate that awaited him.

As for the opportunities of others, that was none of his concern.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Hmm, why is my son’s ranking so low?!” a tier 4 Emperor muttered, looking at the leaderboard in confusion..
