Chapter 1479: Unable To Do Anything

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“This is Holocaust Sect’s Blood-killing Demon Prison, one of the most terrifying secret skills. Jian Wushuang, you had better be careful!” the King of Venomous Worms warned.

Even without the King of Venomous Worms mentioning it, Jian Wushuang could already tell that this move was not normal.

“Come!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed brilliantly and a vast amount of Soul Power burst forth from his body. In no time, a giant golden Divine Ape appeared out of thin air.

The Divine Power and Soul Power from his body had combined beautifully.

An immense amount of blood mist came forth. The blood mist contained frightening corrosive power and it engulfed Jian Wushuang’s golden Divine Ape with a whooshing sound.

The golden Divine Ape on the body surface of Jian Wushuang gave a fierce roar and even its giant body started to change shape under the corrosive power of the blood mist.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave. He then manipulated his Divine Power and an enormous amount of sword essence burst forth at once.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Sounds of the Divine Power suppressing the corrosive power could be heard continuously and they carried on for two breaths’ time.

The great amount of blood mist finally dissipated completely and within it stood Jian Wushuang. The golden Divine Ape on his body surface had already disappeared and what had replaced it was a Black Tortoise. However, this Black Tortoise had already been corroded to the point that not much of it was left.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was like lightning and he stared at the Blood Emperor in front of him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What a horrifying secret skill. Just by blocking this move alone, about thirty percent of my Divine Power has been depleted and about half of my Soul Power has been depleted!”

“If such a secret skill were to be used a few more times, I would be unable to block it. However, it is fortunate that it also takes the Blood Emperor quite a bit of effort to use this move.”

He could feel that after unleashing this move, the Blood Emperor’s aura had depleted considerably as well.

At that very moment, the Blood Emperor also looked toward Jian Wushuang. However, his eyes were filled with surprise.

“He actually blocked it?”

“This little kid actually blocked my Blood-killing Demon Prison?”

The Blood Emperor was stunned.

He knew very well how strong this attack of his was. Even in the Holocaust Sect, this secret skill was extremely powerful.

However, Jian Wushuang had actually blocked it while facing it head on?

It wasn’t until this moment that the Blood Emperor finally understood that Jian Wushuang’s abilities were on par with his own.

“Blood Emperor, that attack just now must have been your strongest attack.”

Jian Wushuang’s icy-cold voice could be heard, “Since you have already used your strongest attack, you shall take my attack now.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, a vast amount of Soul Energy burst forth from Jian Wushuang’s body again. The golden Divine Ape, which had been corroded by the blood mist until nothing was left, appeared again. Moreover, its body seemed to be bigger than before. As for Jian Wushuang, who was shrouded by the golden Divine Ape, the Divine Power as well as the Five-Star Ancient God Power in his body erupted from his body and gathered in the index finger of his right hand.

As Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned narrow, he pointed his index finger, which gathered a vast amount of Divine Power and glowed brilliantly with a golden light abruptly.

“Ancient God’s Fourth Finger, God’s Test!”

Boom!

As soon as he pointed his finger, the heavens and earth shook.

The void around the area turned completely dark.

Within the endless darkness, a dark, golden-colored, giant finger that looked like it had appeared from the ancient times appeared out of thin air.

This finger brought along power that could destroy the world just like the God’s Test which descended from the heaven and the power headed in the direction of the Blood Emperor.

Ancient God’s Fourth Finger!

As a Five-star Ancient God, this was the strongest attack that Jian Wushuang could manage.

Judging by raw power itself, this finger was a lot more powerful than the Real God’s unique skills that Jian Wushuang had created and it could be considered his strongest attack at that moment.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang unleashed his strongest attack.

As he looked at the golden-colored giant finger moving toward him, the Blood Emperor’s expression turned grave and an enormous amount of Crimson Light burst forth again.

“Nine Shade Crimson Knife!”

A terrifying, bright crimson knife-light appeared and swung in the direction of the dark, golden-colored, giant finger.

Bam!

The finger was struck by the crimson-colored knife-light. This caused most of its Divine Power to be dissipated crazily and a hole also appeared in the middle of the giant finger. In the end, not much power was left to do anything to the Blood Emperor.

“Hmph!”

With a groan, the Blood Emperor’s face turned pale and he could not help but retreat a step back. However, he regained his posture straight away.

“Haha. As expected of the Blood Emperor who is one of the four Kings. Today, I, Jian Wushuang have learnt my lesson and I shall take my leave now.”

A hearty, loud peal of laughter from Jian Wushuang could be heard. However, Jian Wushuang had already unleashed the Secret Skill of Dragon Skill and plunged into the void far away.

The Blood Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang’s back coldly. However, he did not give chase.

It was clear that Jian Wushuang’s ability to escape was impressive and it would be impossible for him to catch up. Moreover, even if he did catch up, he would be unable to do anything to Jian Wushuang.

“In just three thousand years… he became this strong?”

The Blood Emperor had mixed feelings. However, in no time, he began to send a message to the experts in the Darkness Mountain.

“I have already fought with Jian Wushuang. Currently, his abilities are on par with mine. As for all of you, if you do not wish to die, leave the Darkness Mountain quickly and find a place to hide.”

After finish sending his message, the Blood Emperor swung the sleeves of his robe, turned around and returned to his crimson fortress.

He had already exhausted all his energy. However, he was still unable to kill Jian Wushuang.

With Jian Wushuang’s abilities, if he were to go on a killing spree in the Darkness Mountain, no one could stop him.

Within the Darkness Mountain, when the experts under the command of the Blood Emperor received his message, all of them were dumbfounded.

“Even though the Blood Emperor had taken action personally, he was still unable to do anything to Jian Wushuang?”

“The Blood Emperor personally said that Jian Wushuang’s abilities were not inferior to his own? How is this possible?”

“Even the Blood Emperor is unable to do anything. Who else is there in Darkness Mountain who can stop Jian Wushuang’s massacre?”

“Run, get out of the Darkness Mountain quickly! If we were to remain here, as soon as we are discovered by Jian Wushuang, we will definitely die!”

The experts in the Darkness Mountain made a move one after another.

No wish wished to die.

If they were to continue staying in the Darkness Mountain, there was a high possibility of them being discovered and killed by Jian Wushuang.

However, if they were to leave Darkness Mountain and hide within the vast lands of the Sky Sword Prison, it would be extremely difficult for Jian Wushuang to find them.

In the void, Jian Wushuang plunged toward the front slowly. He soon found a place and stopped so that he could recover his Divine Power.

In the fight with the Blood Emperor, he had unleashed many moves continuously and had depleted a great amount of his Divine Power.

“This Blood Emperor is indeed strong, especially that Blood-killing Demon Prison move of his. If not for the Blood-killing Plate Armor protecting my body, I might have been unable to block it completely.”

“However, the fight with him had also proven my judgement. My abilities now are indeed about enough to compete with the four Kings,” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

With the King of Venomous Worms present, in no time, Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power had recovered to its peak.

However, at that moment, the Fiery King sent a message.
