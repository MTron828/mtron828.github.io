Chapter 3667: Leave No One Alive

“Qing Zhong, the person you want is me. It has nothing to do with the people in this town. If you let them go, I’ll be at your disposal,” Ye Chen said in a deep voice.

“My lords, this has nothing to do with us!”

“My lords, please show mercy and let me go!”

“My lords, please spare my life.”

Many residents in Green Mountain Town had already started begging for mercy. Most of them knelt on the ground and begged for their lives.

Only Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian, and Ji Wumeng remained standing there. They just watched quietly and did not speak.

Hearing Ye Chen’s words, the green-haired elder in the void above smiled malevolently, “I am here to kill you on the orders of the great Divine Ruler. The great Divine Ruler’s orders are to eliminate anyone who has anything to do with you. You have lived in this town for a full ten years. Naturally, the people in this town have something to do with you.”

“Since they have something to do with you, then all of them must die!”

“Let’s do it!”

The moment the green-haired old man gave the order, the people behind him immediately moved out.

“It’s going to be a massacre.”

“There are more than 300 people in this town. Kill them all and leave no one alive!”

“Tsk tsk, it’s been a long time since I’ve had a massacre. It’s a pity that the ones I’m going to kill this time are all ants.”

Sinister smiles rang out one after another, and the hundreds of figures instantly swooped down.

“No, no!”

Ye Chen became anxious, and his eyes turned red.

It did not matter if he died, but he didn’t want to implicate Jian Nantian, Ji Wumeng, and everyone else in the town who treated him as their son.

Unfortunately, although he was anxious, he could not do anything to stop the many True Saints.

Suddenly…

“Freeze!”

As soon as he said that, the hundreds of cultivators who were swooping down froze in the void.

Including the green-haired old man in the lead, they all froze in the void. Although they were still conscious, they were frightened to find that their god bodies could not move at all, they couldn’t even move their fingers.

“What...what is this technique?”

The green-haired old man was frightened. The hundreds of cultivators around him were also frightened.

The sudden change of events shocked everyone.

In Green Mountain Town, when the three hundred residents saw the people above taking action, they all thought that the end of the world was coming. However, what happened next was out of everyone’s expectations, seeing the assassins being fixed in the void like statues, these residents were also somewhat confused.

“What, what’s going on?”

“What’s going on?”

“I just heard the word ‘fixed’, and then these people were fixed. Did some earth-shaking expert make a move?”

The soldiers and civilians began to discuss, and at the same time, a glimmer of hope burned in their hearts.

“What, what’s going on?” Ye Chen was also confused.

Only Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian, and Ji Wumeng, who were standing beside him, remained calm.

“This is space-time stagnation, right? With just a thought, it can cause space-time stagnation and immobilize nearly a hundred True Saints. Shuang’er, your current means are getting more and more unbelievable.”

Jian Nantian was the first to speak, and there was a hint of surprise in his words.

After all, he was one of the top experts in the Green Fire World. He could even be said to be one of the top experts in the entire Eternal Chaotic World. His vision was also very high in the entire Eternal Chaotic World, however, what Jian Wushuang was doing now made him feel a little incredulous.

“It’s just some small tricks.” Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly.

He was being modest. The heaven-designated skill was not a small trick. It was one of the divine skills created by the Ruler of time and space. However, when it was used on the cultivation of True Saints, it would not show its true power.

“Father, mother, the little guy named Ye Chen that you adopted is not bad.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Of course, if he didn’t have a good heart, your father and I wouldn’t have saved him ten years ago, and we wouldn’t have kept him by our side all the time. It’s a pity that this child was born with a poor heart. His physique is too unique. Your father thought of countless ways to change his physique, but he couldn’t change it so that he could cultivate,” Ji Wumeng said.

“His physique is very special.” Jian Wushuang also nodded, but his tone suddenly changed. “But it’s not impossible to solve his physique.”

“Oh?” Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

The conversation between the three people was not concealed at all, but was clearly heard by the people around them.

In an instant, everyone understood that the three people were the ones who had made the nearly 100 cultivators freeze in the void at the same time.

“Uncle, aunt, you...” Ye Chen looked at Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng in astonishment.

“Ye Chen, we’ll talk about your business later. Let’s get rid of these people,” Jian Nantian said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then looked up at the nearly 100 True Saints in the void.

The cultivators who were frozen in the void were all panicking. The green-haired elder in the lead was also frightened and asked, “Who...who are you?”

“Who are we?” Ji Wumeng’s expression turned cold. “Didn’t you say that you wanted to kill all the people related to Ye Chen in this town? Let me tell you, ten years ago, it was the two of us who saved Ye Chen. During these ten years, this little guy has always been by our side and can be considered as our adopted son. Speaking of which, the two of us are the closest to him in this town. If you want to kill him, you should kill the two of us first.”

“This...” The green-haired elder cleared his throat, he laughed dryly, “Haha, there might be some misunderstanding regarding this matter. We are acting under the orders of our sirs. Our masters are the Purple Emperor of the Azure Sea Cloud Pavilion. His master is the famous Magic Water Emperor of the Eternal Chaotic World. I hope that you will spare us on account of our masters.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Purple Emperor? Magic Water Emperor? Haha, what great names.” Jian Nantian said sarcastically.

He had heard of Magic Water Emperor. He was just an ordinary Ruler and did not think much of him, let alone Purple Emperor.

The two people who did not even care about him were nothing to Jian Wushuang.

“Purple Emperor, Magic Water Emperor, right?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and grabbed at the surrounding void with his bare hands.

The void shattered and two miserable figures rolled out from the shattered void.
