Chapter 1620: Pass The Test

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Next one!”

The third round of tests continued, and each Ancient God went up one by one to fight the three Undying Demon Apes.

Although Undying Demon Apes were not so strong, they still posed a great challenge for the Ancient Gods as participants could beat them within ten breaths.

Soon more than a dozen Ancient Gods had taken the challenge but only one person had passed the test.

At that time, the youth with golden eyes appeared.

“Gu Jian, let’s have a competition and see who can beat those apes in the shortest time,” Gu Zhen also said to Jian Wushuang before he took the challenge.

“OK,” Jian Wushuang responded with a smile.

Gu Zhen was obviously stronger than other Ancient Gods who had participated in the test, not only in terms of purity of his blood but also in his fighting skills.

In just six breaths, the three Undying Demon Apes were defeated by Gu Zhen.

“Six breaths.” Gu Zhen was obviously quite satisfied with his performance.

“It is your turn, Gu Jian,” Gu Zhen walked down and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled and went up.

The three Undying Demon Apes’ eyes were full of aggression and endless hate when they stared at the sword.

They were imprisoned by those from the Ancient God Clan and had suffered humiliation. They were therefore resentful to Ancient Gods from Ancient God Clan. Therefore, every time they fought against the Ancient Gods, they all tried their best to kill their enemies, but always failed.

“Jian Wushuang, you can use your Ancient God Power to defeat them,” King of Venomous Worms suggested.

“Yeah,” Jian Wushuang agreed.

“Get started!” The host announced.

In the blink of an eye, three Undying Demon Apes rushed straight toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang calmly generated his great Ancient God Power into his right index finger.

“Ancient God’s Fourth Finger, God Test!”

He pointed his powerful index finger to the apes.

Bang!

The surrounding space was smashed and the whole universe went dark.

In the darkness, a giant finger came into existence from the distant sky.

“It’s…” Everyone was shocked.

“Is it Ancient God Fourth Finger?” Even the prominent judge was surprised and frowned.

Generally, cultivators could only learn the unique skill of Ancient God Finger in Ancient God Palace in Nine Great King Cities. Though several Ancient God tribes also had this unique skill, they had no more than the first three finger skills. However, Jian Wushuang used the fourth one!

“Has he learned the skill from the Ancient God Palace?” the host wondered.

The giant finger that had the power to ruin the earth stretched out, and Jian Wushuang used the finger to attack Undying Demon Apes, who couldn’t resist at all.

In an instant, three Undying Demon Apes were torn apart by the terrifying power.

The power of this finger finally fell completely, the battlefield calmed down, and the Undying Demon Apes began to recover.

“OK, just with my Ancient God Power, I can’t kill these three Undying Demon Apes.” Jian Wushuang said.

But he didn’t care.

He had successfully finished what the game had required.

As for the time spent… only a breath!

Yes, Jian Wushuang had defeated the three Undying Demon Apes only with a one breath’s time.

Gu Zhen felt mixed feelings when he saw Jian Wushuang’s performance.

“I thought that I was good to beat the Undying Demon Apes with six breaths, but this guy used only one breath, and he is even able to use the Ancient God Fourth Finger. How is it possible? How did he get this skill?” Gu Zhen was confused.

Soon, the third round of tests was completely over.

Among the hundreds of ancient gods participating in the test from the beginning, only four people had passed all the three rounds.

Jian Wushuang was among them.

“That is to say, I can go to the Ancient God Palace to cultivate the three secret skills and four unique skills there, right?” Jian Wushuang was excited. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It is supposed to be like that, but….” The voice of King of Venomous Worms suddenly changed.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang frowned, but the next moment he immediately felt a strong power.

Other Ancient Gods in this martial arts field had also noticed the coming figure.

He was a bald man in a long robe. The bald man showed his Ancient God Body He was five meters tall, and his body was covered with a layer of dark golden light. The most eye-catching characteristic was the bald man’s eyebrows, between which there well seven stars.

“Seven-star Ancient God!”

Many of the ancient gods were shocked, and they gathered to bow to the Seven-star Ancient God.

He overlooked the Ancient Gods in front of him and found the youth with golden eyes and spoke: “Gu Zhen.”

“My dear King.” Gu Zhen immediately came forward to show his respect.

The bald man was King Gu Yi.

“Have you passed the test?” King Gu Yi asked Gu Zhen.

“Yes,” Gu Zhen nodded.

“You are the best?” King Gu Yi asked.

Gu Zhen immediately shook his head: “I am not the best. The best is Gu Jian.”

Then Gu Zhen pointed to Jian Wushuang.

Then King Ku Yi glanced at Jian Wushuang, but the moment he looked at Jian Wushuang he was surprised.

And in front of a Seven-star Ancient God, who was comparable to the mighty, Jian Wushuang was a little bit nervous.

“Jian Wushuang, I think you are in trouble now,” King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang.

“Little guy, show your Ancient God Body,” King Gu Yi said to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was surprised by the requirement. So were others.

Others realized that they didn’t see Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God Body when he was beating the drum or fighting the apes.

“Do as he said, Jian Wushuang. It’s now hard to hide your power,” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and his figure also exploded in the next moment while his skin turned dark. He started to show his power.

“This is… Royal Ancient God?”

Many Ancient Gods were shocked when they felt the power of Jian Wushuang.

Even King Gu Yi was surprised.

“This breath… is the Human-God Bloodline!!!”
