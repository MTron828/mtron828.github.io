Chapter 5421 - 5421: Law Enforcement Hall Situ Nan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Just as the atmosphere solidified once again, a terrifying aura approached from a distance.

Among them were numerous tier 6 Emperors, their strength surpassing even the forces of Kui Organization and Gui Ling Island.

The Elders Palace!

“Not too late to the party, I see. You guys haven’t started fighting yet!” the newcomer sneered, hands crossed behind their back.

Zheng Wuyang recognized the person; they were accompanied by a group of Inheritors.

Jian Wushuang didn’t know many of the Inheritors who appeared this time, but Fengyu was present, also a tier 5 peak-level Emperor. Behind her, Jian Wushuang also spotted a familiar figure.

“Wan Xing!!

Now truly an Emperor, already at the pea-level of tier 4. He had merged Dao, and he had indeed ascended to the rank of Emperor.

It wasn’t surprising. Back then, the Wan Xings Origin Source was nearly complete. Achieving the status of Emperor in a few thousand years was normal.

Peak-level of tier 4, and the speed was quite impressive.

In terms of combat strength, he was probably not weaker than an ordinary tier 5 peak-level Emperor.

“Forget the introduction. 1 am Situ Nan, Deputy Hall Master of the

Enforcement Hall of the Elders’ Palace.” As soon as the words fell, not only Gui Ling but also several elders from Kui couldn’t help but inhale sharply.

Lan Yu immediately explained the rumors to Jian Wushuang and Bai Junwang.

The Enforcement Hall of the Elder Palace in the northern region of the Heavenly Realm had a horrifying reputation, especially its deputy hall master, Situ Nan, who could be considered an executioner.

In the past few thousand years, several major battles in the Heavenly Realm were led by Situ Nan, and numerous tier 6 Emperors fell at his hands, not to mention the many tier 5 Emperors.

Powerful beings from the Shadow Sect in the Heavenly Realm dared not approach the northern region; they only stirred up trouble in the Earthly Realm. Even the Grand Yan Immortals dared not show themselves, fearing capture by the Enforcement Hall.

“Unbelievable!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in shock.

He remembered that when he wag in the northern region of the Heavenly Realm, the Elder Palace was just the Elder Palace of the Yuanyang Lake. After he left, the Elder Palace took over the entire northern region and transformed within a few thousand years.

Ironically, it was all because of him.

Chishui, who wasn’t afraid of Situ Nan, directly asked, “Situ, why are you here? Does your Elder Palace still find the treasures insufficient?”

“Haha, who would complain about having too many treasures! Besides, you guys are too sneaky, following us here and leaving the others in the Swirling Sea. I can’t tolerate that, and I had no choice but to bring Fengyu and the others over,” Situ Nan said, pointing at a group of unfriendly Inheritors behind him.

Feeling guilty, Chishui dared not look and turned away without saying anything.

Seeing Fengyu!s defeat, Situ Nan sneered and continued, “You’ll all have to thank me later! ”

With that, he took out a small seal, approached a tombstone, gently placed the seal on it, and streams of light began to spread. Many people were astonished.

Jian Wushuang, however, showed a hint of curiosity.

As representatives of the Kui Organization, they had followed the guidance of

Shen Ling to this place and, by a stroke of luck, obtained the Bloodluo Crystal.

The people from the Elder Palace obtained the key to open the relic without any prior conditions, and they were the last to arrive.

The Elder Palace!

That was the direct lineage of Zhen Ling.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but break into a cold sweat.

One side was Zhen Ling, and the other was Shen Ling.

Both were people not to be trifled with.

He felt like he was just a pawn in the game.

How did that cave mansion end up in the Swirling Sea?

Why were he and Bai Junwang so lucky? There seemed to be someone behind all this, manipulating events in the shadows.

As the light flowed, Jian Wushuang was blown away by the air current, feeling a bit dizzy.

The ones in the front were still those tier 6 Emperors.

This time, Jian Wushuang didn’t seek the limelight but stood quietly at the back.

Glancing at Gong Miaoyi, he revealed a faint smile.

Originally thought to be in control of others’ destinies. he realized he was just a pawn as well.

Ahead, Bai Junwang, with his neck pulled forward, looked like he was eager to enter, which made Jian Wushuang find it amusing. Being used and still putting in so much effort!

Who were they fighting for?

Enthusiasm instantly dropped, falling to the lowest.

However, there were still ten tier 5 peak-level Emperors following Bai Junwang, responsible for protection.

“Hmm?”

Jian Wushuang followed a certain aura, shifting his gaze to the two individuals standing at the very back.

“It’s him!” Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised.

One was a robust man with a bare upper body, wearing peculiar long pants, and the other was a middle-aged man with white-speckled hair.

Both were tier 5 Emperors, with the bare-chested one being a tier 5 peak-level, exuding a powerful aura.

“Bukun! Both the father and son are here!”

Having encountered them once at Shangqing Palace, Jian Wushuang found their Origin Source quite unique, leaving a deep impression on him. Unexpectedly, he encountered these two here.

Ahead of them was someone he hadn’t met before, but someone he had been longing for.

“Luo Sha!”

The Crown Prince of the MO Luo Kingdom, accompanied by several powerful individuals, a total of eight tier 5 Emperors, with varying levels of strength.

Jian Wushuang glanced at his demeanor.

Superficially, it was hard to discern, but the power contained within matched the Beast God Weapon on Jian Wushuangs body—it was the Arm of the Candle Dragon.

Perhaps because Jian Wushuang had glanced at him or because of the Candle Dragon aura emanating from Jian Wushuang, the MO Luo Crown Prince, Luo Sha, also looked in Jian Wushuangs direction.

The two locked eyes and nodded at each other.

Jian Wushuang didn’t want to reveal his intentions to avoid arousing suspicion, while Luo Sha felt that Jian Wushuang was extraordinary, surrounded by ten tier 5 peak-level protectors—a formidable force larger than his own.

It was impossible to find such a force in the Western Sea; perhaps it was the peak force of the Inner Sea or the descendant of a prominent figure from

Tiannan.

Such figures had vast backgrounds, standing confidently before everyone, clearly not ordinary people and not to be offended—certainly not like his foolish brother.

“Interesting!” Jian Wushuang chuckled inwardly.

A person capable of commanding an army was indeed extraordinary. Although there was a slight difference in strength, it was not to be underestimated.

Luo Sha had now broken through to the tier 5.

While Jian Wushuang had a record of killing tier 5 Emperors, the opponent he faced was too weak—lacking any eternal treasures and fighting alone.

His aura was also weak, incomparable to Luo Sha.

Jian Wushuangs eyes sparkled.

If he could collect more Beast God Weapons before the emerging the Dao, elevate it using the Power of All Things, there was a real chance his divine body could reach 50,000-fold.

He could hardly imagine how strong his breakthrough would be.

Perfected Extreme Dao, Ultimate Sword Dao, and the divine body reaching an astonishing 50,000-fold… Once he achieved Dao Merge, he would reach tier 5. Then, no one would be able to stop him.

Things he dared not even think about before were becoming a reality in just a few thousand years at the Qishen Temple.

Of course, this was also related to the Time Pavilion. He had practiced in the starry sky for countless years. Although there was no accurate record, he had experienced a hundred epochs..
