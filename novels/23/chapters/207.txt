Chapter 208: Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Not long ago, these old sect powerhouses were very interested in the extraordinary exceptional genius, Jian Wushuang. Even experts of several old sects had pondered over what they could offer to attract him.

But now, after seeing Grayrobe and especially the token, they all gave up.

They knew what his token implied: the people being preyed on by this horror force seldom escaped from the entire Nanyang Continent.

“Hmm, that guy can be proud of it. He should have the qualification to be preyed on by the horror force.” Mo Lingtian sneered at this moment.

Experts of the 12 Dynasties and other old sects thereupon felt pity for Jian Wushuang and his adversity right now, but only Mo Lingtian was taking pleasure in his misfortune.

Nearby people shook their heads with resignation.

At this moment, all of them were sympathetically looking at Jian Wushuang who stood in the limelight.

Grayrobe saw all of the experts’ expressions, as was expected. He sneered, and then looked at Di Xi. “Your Majesty, what do you think?”

“If you want the Tianzong Dynasty to be history, you can set about rescuing that guy.”

Hearing that, Di Xi was temperamental.

In his eyes, there was a little craziness and also a little rationality, but the rationality prevailed in the end.

Di Xi clenched his hands tightly, letting out a sigh, and then he collapsed onto the chair and closed his eyes without saying anything.

“Hmph, it’s great you know your place.”

Grayrobe sneered at Di Xi and then traveled down to Sky Valley.

Everyone was staring at Sky Valley. They had noticed that those purple-masked killers from Blood Feather Tower were nearing closer and closer to Jian Wushuang.

In Sky Valley.

Everything had calmed down. Only the corpses of the geniuses from the Cosmos Empire were messily lying around.

As for Ling Xueyu, whose arms were cut off and Dantian was destroyed, Yang Zaixuan did not torture him any longer but directly killed him.

Although the Tianzong Dynasty made a clean sweep in this fierce battle, they also suffered great losses.

Except for Jian Wushuang, Baili Chen, Feng Yutian, and Mu Yingying who were mortally wounded. Their faces were currently as pale as death.

Su Rou was more severely wounded.

Even if she took several high-grade healing elixirs, she would only be able to recover consciousness.

What they received were just physical wounds. Though these were severe, they could recover.

While Yang Zaixuan...

“Second Brother.”

Jian Wushuang stood in front of Yang Zaixuan, looking at his broken arm with self-accusation and guilt in his eyes.

“If, if I could have completed the breakthrough earlier...”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

“Only the left arm was cut off. I’ll be fine.” Yang Zaixuan took a look at Jian Wushuang and comforted him.

However, Jian Wushuang was silent.

“The broken arm is not beyond recovery.” Mu Yingying’s voice sounded.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan looked at Mu Yingying immediately.

Mu Yingying said, “You know that I come from Mu clan, which is very good at alchemy. Once, I had heard from one of the clan’s elders that there is a kind of organ-neogenesis elixir, named Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir.”

“Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir.” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He didn’t know much about elixirs, so he had never heard of the Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir.

“This kind of elixir can regenerate broken limbs, thus it also can absolutely recover Yang Zaixuan’s broken arm. But the level of Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir is quite high. Even people in the Mu clan merely hear about it but no one can refine it,” Mu Yingying said.

“Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir, I’ve heard of it as well.” A soft voice sounded. It was from the nearby Su Rou who was still lying on the ground weakly.

“As long as the elixir is obtained, it would be able to recover Lao Er’s arm. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to refine this kind of elixir. Few people can refine it on the whole Nanyang Continent, so it is hard to obtain it.”

“It is hard to obtain, but that’s provided it does exist,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Hmm.” Yang Zaixuan also forced a smile.

“Alright. Let’s just move on. All the geniuses of the Cosmos Empire are killed, and the armlets from the geniuses of the Immortals-killing Empire have been taken by me. Let us six divide these armlets equally,” Jian Wushuang said suddenly.

Hearing that, the five people nearby all smiled. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Haha, all the armlets from the geniuses of two large empires. How many points will this be!”

“There’s a plethora of points. If we divide them equally, without exception, we will take up the top six on the new standings after Point Grab Battle.”

“This time, our Tianzong Dynasty will be famous in the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties.”

Yang Zaixuan, Su Rou, Baili Chen, Feng Yutian, and Mu Yingying were all surprised. Then the five people’s eyes simultaneously focused on Jian Wushuang.

They all knew that it was because of Jian Wushuang that they could reach this step.

Because of his world-shaking strength after he broke through.

That opportunely verified what Jian Wushuang said before he had broken through.

“After the breakthrough, I will lead you to sweep over the northwestern dynasties and create a new legend!”

A smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face.

Sweep over the northwestern dynasties!

Create a new legend!

He did it!

However, at this point...

Jian Wushuang suddenly felt alarmed, and the hairs on his skin erected.

“This feeling!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrunk slightly.

It was not the first time that he had experienced this feeling.

“Blood Feather Tower!”

Jian Wushuang yelled, and then a killing intent immediately erupted from him.

Chuu!

A shadow and cold blood-red blade appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

The blood-red blade directly stabbed at Jian Wushuang in such an unusual and odd way.

It instantly pierced Jian Wushuang.

But no blood flowed out after his body was pierced, and there wasn’t even the sound of a blade piercing him.

“Residual shadow?”

The fighting purple-masked killer felt frightened, and soon he saw Jian Wushuang appear beside him.

Chuu!

Jian Wushuang was filled with such murderous intent that he directly stabbed at that purple-masked killer with rage.

The purple-masked killer raised his blood-red blade in order to fend off the attack.

Bang!

The purple-masked killer was knocked back immediately because of a fierce explosion and then powerfully struck a tree, causing it to become seriously cracked.

At the moment when this purple-masked killer was repulsed...

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several ghostly figures appeared around Jian Wushuang in succession, with innumerable eyes filled with killing intent gazing at him.

Glancing around, Jian Wushuang saw that there should be 11 people as well as the person beaten back by him earlier, thus it totaled to 12 killers.

What’s more, all of these killers wore purple masks with powerful auras exuding from them.
