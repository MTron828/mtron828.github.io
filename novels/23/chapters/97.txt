Chapter 98: Excoriation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was night, within the empty ground of a manor.

Zoom! Zoom! Zoom!

Streaks of scorching sword shadow were chopped out fiercely one after another and the high temperatures seemed to burn the air.

Soon after, Jian Wushuang sheathed his sword and stood still.

“As a 6000-point-valued sword skill, Sword Skill of Blood and Fire is way better than Formless Sword Wave in the term of power, and its moves are more exquisite. I can only execute the fifth move with my current ability. I have to study for a period of time before executing the sixth move,” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

However, it would definitely shock many if they knew that Jian Wushuang could execute the fifth move of Sword Skill of Blood and Fire.

If a man could execute the fifth move of Sword Skill of Blood and Fire, it meant that he could pass the Seventh Level of Dragon Gate without difficulty.

Everyone in the Dragon Palace knew that Jian Wushuang was most versed in the sword essences of both the Gale and the Earth.

In addition, the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire was just exchanged from Secret Pavilion that day.

…

Early morning the next day, Jian Wushuang entered the Hall of Fire, which was one of the Four Halls of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind.

Today, a Palace Master would give a lesson in the fire temple. Although Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Sword Essence of Raging Fire for half a year, he comprehended it by himself. Therefore, in the Dragon Palace, he would listen carefully to the Palace Master.

Casually sitting in the corner of the fire temple, Jian Wushuang relaxed with closed eyes and awaited the Palace Master. The surrounding Disciples of Dragon Palace looked at him from time to time with a weird gaze.

“He’s Swordsman. Why does he come here?”

“People in the fire temple comprehended the Fierce Fire Realm, but Jian Wushuang has comprehended the sword essence of Gale and Earth.”

“Does he want to comprehend the Fierce Fire Realm?”

“A man can comprehend three realms at the same time. Are you kidding me?”

“Swordsman is too ambitious.”

“Hmm. The more ambitious he is, the more foolish he is. Trying three realms at the same time. Who is he?”

“You are right. It’s exceedingly hard to comprehend two realms at the same time. Even a peerless genius would suffer from fatigue if he comprehended three realms.”

Those Disciples of Dragon Palace chatted with each other casually. Their voices were not loud, but not quiet, either. They did not care whether Jian Wushuang heard it or not.

Whatever they said, Jian Wushuang didn’t pay attention to them. He was still relaxing with closed eyes. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Soon after, the Palace Master of the fire temple arrived. He looked at Jian Wushuang with amazement, and then sat and gave a lesson with his legs crossed.

After an hour, this Palace Master of the fire temple waved goodbye and the listeners started to leave.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and a smile emerged.

“Since half a year ago, I have pored through the sword principle of Fierce Fire alone. I was confused about many things. However, the confusion has been cleared up after the Palace Master’s lesson.”

Jian Wushuang was satisfied with this lesson. He had benefited a lot from it and was enlightened in many aspects.

After that, Jian Wushuang left.

In the palaces of the Dragon Palace, white-robed Palace Master White was walking slowly.

“Palace Master White.” A figure appeared suddenly in front of Palace Master White.

“Temple Master Yao.” Palace Master White smiled. “Did you finish your class?”

“It is finished. Their comprehension depends on themselves.” Temple Master Yao gave a slight smile and said, “I came here for a reason.”

“I saw the little disciple Swordsman in the class when I was imparting knowledge,” Temple Master Yao said directly.

“What?” Palace Master White was shocked and said, “Did Swordsman go to your class?”

“Yeah.” Temple Master Yao nodded and said, “The brat is noteworthy in the Dragon Palace. His potential absolutely could rank in the top five amongst all disciples of the Dragon Palace. That’s why I informed you about him.”

“I see.” A serious expression emerged on Palace Master White’s face.

“The next thing depends on you. You should exhort him not to waste much time comprehending the Fierce Fire Realm. I’ll leave,” Temple Master Yao said and then left.

Palace Master White stood there with a saturnine and gloomy expression.

“I didn’t expect that Swordsman would try to comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. Doing three things at the same time. Comprehending three sword essences at the same time? What is he thinking?” Palace Master White gave a cold humph and then directly went to the manor where Jian Wushuang lived.

In the manor, Jian Wushuang was practicing his sword skill diligently.

“Swordsman.” Palace Master White appeared.

“Palace Master White.” Jian Wushuang put away his sword and paid his respects.

“I have heard that you have exchanged for the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire in the Secret Pavilion yesterday and attended the class of Temple Master Yao. Do you want to comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire?” The expression of Palace Master White grew cold.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Stupid! Idiot!”Palace Master White was mad.

“The Martial Arts way is fraught with troubles. You are a young talent and have deep comprehension of the sword essences of Gale and Earth. It’s highly possible for you to combine the Gale Realm with Earth Realm in the future. You will be amongst the top ranks if you are in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. It’s also likely for your strength to equal or even outclass the Palace Masters of the Four Halls of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind!”

“You are promising and our Dragon Palace also possesses the hope to cultivate one more top powerhouse.”

“I have far higher expectations from you!”

“But now, you are so overconfident that you want to comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire?” The cold gaze hardened in Palace Master White’s eyes.

“Do you know that nobody has endless energy? Doing two things at the same time is the limit. Doing three things at the same time is ridiculous…”

“I know that you think your strength will grow if you comprehend three sword essences at the same time. However, you will bear a greater burden!”

“In history, some geniuses of the Dragon Palace had a higher comprehension than you. However, they could only comprehend two realms at the same time. Yes, there have been geniuses who comprehended three realms at the same time, but do you know their results?”

“Take Ling Wuxiao, a genius about ten years ago in the Dragon Palace, as an example. He was a matchless genius. He comprehended three realms at the same time and combined them perfectly. When he was in the Initial Gold Core Realm, he could kill a powerhouse who was in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm!”

“He was way better than you. However, his speed of comprehending the sword essence became slower and slower. His cultivation was even stalled in a small bottleneck for many years. And his speed of improvement was also lower and lower. Finally, he was overtaken by other geniuses…”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang felt overwhelmed.

He didn’t realize that he would be excoriated as soon as Palace Master White met him.

“Swordsman, you should recognize that the road of cultivation will not be reset if you go awry.”

“Do you understand what I said?” Palace Master White looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Jian Wushuang was acquainted with what Palace Master White said.

“Okay. I have great faith in you. I believe that your future achievement will be greater than those of Bai Cheng and Su Lie. Therefore, you can’t let me down.” Palace Master White became calm.

“Okay. I have said what I should say. How you walk depends on you. Go ahead!”

After saying that, Palace Master White left.
