Chapter 3545: Asking for Information

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Earth Saint Star Master,” Axe One Master said.

“It’s him?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Axe One Master had given him a detailed list of experts, including experts from various forces in the surrounding Star Worlds.

Among them, there was naturally an introduction by Earth Saint Star Master.

The first impression that Earth Saint Star Master gave Jian Wushuang was that he was a difficult and terrifying super figure.

First of all, he was a genuine Ruler Realm expert. Secondly, he was extremely eccentric and eccentric. It could even be said that he was crazy!

He was an old monster who had lived for God knows how many years. His hometown, the Star World where he was born, had already reached its end a long time ago and finally collapsed. However, he survived. At that time, he was only a Principles Master.

However, after such a Principles Master collapsed in the astral world where he was born and had no worries at all, he began to crazily pursue his own strength. He roamed the three great battlefields and killed crazily, just like the current God Fei Master, he killed everyone he saw and did not care who he offended.

At that time, this Earth Saint Star Master had stirred up a bloody storm in the three great battlefields and made a great reputation for himself. At that time, he had offended many experts. There were even experts who joined hands to kill him, there was even a Ruler Realm expert who had personally made a move, but he had managed to escape.

In the end, he had even obtained an opportunity in the three great battlefields and leaped to become a Ruler Realm expert. Naturally, no one could do anything to him.

However, after this Earth Saint Star Master became a Ruler Realm expert, he gradually restrained his killing. He no longer killed as wantonly as before. Instead, he chose an earth star to occupy, he named this Earth Star the Earth Saint Star.

After that, the Earth Saint Star and the Earth Saint Star Master were recognized as the most untouchable existences in this territory.

“The Earth Saint Star Master is a crazy person who likes to kill. He has a very strange personality. I can’t ask him for the ice heart glazed jade.” Jian Wushuang did not frown.

Although he had some strength now, he could not ask him to face a Ruler Realm expert.

Moreover, this Ruler Realm expert was a person who liked to kill. If Jian Wushuang took the initiative to come to him, the Earth Saint Star Master would kill him before he could explain why he came.

“My young friend, the icy heart glazed jade is indeed a bit troublesome, but you don’t have to worry too much. Although the Earth Saint Star Master is not easy to deal with, he is only one person. Star Palace has some influence in this territory. I will try to contact the Earth Saint Star Master in the name of Star Palace and see if he is willing to exchange the icy heart glazed jade,” Axe One Master said.

“In that case, I’ll leave it to you, Axe One Master.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had no choice but to ask Star Palace to negotiate with him. For the time being, he did not have the ability to face the Saint Star Master.

“In addition to icy heart glazed jade, I also want you to ask about someone for me, Axe One Master,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Who?” Axe One Master looked at him.

“Star Luo Master!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Star Luo Master? Who is that?” Axe One Master was puzzled.

“I don’t know much about the identity of Star Luo Master, but I know that she was involved in the world-ending war in the Divine Beginning Realm. She stayed in the Divine Beginning Realm for a long time. During these 10,000 years, she was still in the Divine Beginning Realm, but she disappeared soon after. I suspect that she came to the Universe Battlefield. Even if she’s not in this territory, she might be in the nearby territory,” Jian Wushuang said.

Star Luo Master...this person was Leng Ruxue’s master! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In his previous life, it was this Star Luo Master and the three masters of the Saint Realm who forcefully opened the passage to the eternal chaotic world and brought Leng Ruxue to the Divine Beginning Realm. It was also the opening of the passage, it allowed Xuan Yi to find an opportunity to open the reincarnation passage and send his soul and Leng Rushuang’s soul to the Divine Beginning Realm.

Jian Wushuang did not know much about Leng Rushuang’s master. He had carefully checked the information of Star Luo Master in the Temporal Temple. He only knew that she had stayed in the Divine Beginning Realm for a long time, however, she was not a Ruler expert who had risen in the Divine Beginning Realm, but from the outside world.

She had participated in the destruction of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. It was because of this that the three Saint Realm Masters of the three Saint Realms had helped him open the passage to the eternal chaotic world.

However, when Jian Wushuang came to the Divine Beginning Realm and gradually rose to power, Star Luo Master disappeared completely. Jian Wushuang asked the Temporal Temple to investigate, but they did not find any trace of her, therefore, Jian Wushuang suspected that Star Luo Master had come to the Universe Battlefield.

If Star Luo Master really came, Leng Ruxue would most likely be with her.

The main reason why Jian Wushuang wanted to find Star Luo Master was to find Leng Ruxue!

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, there were two ways to restore his wife’s body. The iceheart glazed jade was just one of them. What Jian Wushuang wanted to do more was to find Leng Ruxue and suppress her, then he would find a way to let Leng Ruxue regain control of her body.

Naturally, he had to find the iceheart glazed jade, Star Luo Master, and Leng Ruxue as well.

“I’ve never heard of this Star Luo Master. But since he’s a Ruler Realm expert, it’s impossible for him to be unknown. I’ll use some of Star Palace’s intelligence abilities to look for him for you. As long as he’s in this territory, Star Palace should be able to find him. But if he’s in another territory, although Star Palace has some intelligence abilities, we’re not so sure that we can find him,” Axe One Master said.

“Well, I’m counting on you, Axe One Master,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t stand on ceremony with me. Whether I contact Saint Star Master for you or Star Luo Master for you, I won’t do it for free. You have to pay the price,” Axe One Master said suddenly.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“My young friend, I know that you received a lot of contribution points in the true treasure vault, and then you gave some to Heavy Master and Saber Python Master, and then you exchanged for the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword. But if I’m not wrong, you should still have 20 contribution points. These 20 contribution points are the price for Star Palace to contact Saint Star Master and Star Luo Master for you,” Axe One Master said with a smile.

“You need contribution points to gather information?” Jian Wushuang asked with a strange expression.

“Of course, in the Star Palace, no matter what resources you want to use, you have to pay a price,” Axe One Master said.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to take out his last 20 contribution points.
