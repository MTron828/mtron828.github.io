Chapter 3866: Si Yi

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although the cultivation environment in the Eternal Dark Prison was extremely harsh, it did not restrict the soul power of a cultivator. It was similar to the Red Cloud World. When Jian Wushuang released all of his soul power, it could cover an area of 100,000 miles.

“There is no one within 100,000 miles.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. He did not care and continued to move forward.

Half a day later.

“Finally, there’s someone.” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He could sense a strong aura within the range of his soul power.

This aura was not much weaker than Demon Monarch Ancient Night’s.

A figure rose up from the ground not far from Jian Wushuang and looked at Jian Wushuang, “How dare he use his soul power to investigate? Is he one of the five strongest experts in the ninth dark zone or one of the top 1,000 third-level masters?”

“But judging from his soul power, he doesn’t seem to be very strong.”

The two-meter-tall man in cyan armor with wings on his back frowned and hesitated.

In the Eternal Dark Prison, killing was too crazy. Countless prisoners had to kill others to get their treasures so that they could increase their own strength so that they could survive more easily. It was because of this that most of the prisoners…other than those who were extremely powerful and had absolute confidence, most of them were very careful.

Few people dared to release their soul power and investigate the surrounding scenes.

Therefore, when he sensed Jian Wushuang’s soul power sweeping toward him, the cold man with wings on his back immediately thought of escaping. However, Jian Wushuang’s soul power suddenly appeared in his mind. It was not strong. In fact, it could even be said that…it was relatively weak.

If he was really a top existence among the prisoners, his soul power should not be so weak.

“In any case, as long as I don’t meet the five strongest experts, even if there are thousands of top existences among the third-level masters, I can easily survive. Let’s go and see.”

The cold man with wings made up his mind and slowly approached his opponent.

Soon, Jian Wushuang appeared in the cold man’s sight.

“He looks so young with a Divine Sword on his back. I’ve never seen him before. He doesn’t seem to exist among the experts in the ninth dark zone.” The cold man frowned and stared at Jian Wushuang. “And the divine power aura on his body…”

“Principles Master? It’s just the divine power aura of Principles Master?”

The cold man was shocked.

There were hundreds of millions of prisoners in the first level of Eternal Dark Prison. Anyone who survived hundreds of chaos cycles was extremely powerful. The lowest level was at the peak of the second level, ordinary first-level and second-level Rulers would die in Eternal Dark Prison. It would not be long before they died there.

First-level and even second-level Rulers were the same.

But a mere Principles Masters had actually come to the Eternal Dark Prison?

“Did he use some secret technique to hide his divine power aura so that I couldn’t break it? Or is he a Principles Masters himself?” The cold-looking man could not be sure, but his gaze quickly turned cold. “Humph, I don’t care if he’s a Principles Master or not. I can confirm that he’s not one of the five strongest in the ninth dark zone. In that case, I have nothing to fear.”

The cold man spread his wings and turned into a black stream of light, appearing in front of Jian Wushuang at lightning speed.

“Is this the first opponent I’ve encountered since I came to the Eternal Dark Prison?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the cold man with a faint smile and said, “With wings on his back and an extremely cold aura, he must be the Si Yi Ruler from the Flood-dragon Wings Clan.”

Jian Wushuang had a very detailed information on the experts given by Demon Monarch Ancient Night. More than 90% of the prisoners in the ninth dark area were recorded in it.

The Si Yi Ruler in front of him was naturally in the information on the experts.

According to the information given by Demon Monarch Ancient Night, Lord Si Yi was the weakest among the prisoners in the ninth dark zone. In terms of close combat, his overall combat strength was just at the peak of the second level, however, his life-saving skills were very good. He was slightly stronger than Demon Monarch Ancient Night. Because of this, he was able to survive in the Eternal Dark Prison.

“Who are you? I’ve been wandering in the ninth dark area for a long time. I’ve seen or know most of the experts in the ninth dark area, but I’ve never heard of you.” Lord Si Yi stared at Jian Wushuang.

“My name is Blood Sword. I just came to the Magic Dragon Field not long ago. Of course, you don’t know me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“So you’re an expert from another field.” Lord Si Yi nodded secretly.

The first level of the eternal prison was simply too vast. There were countless prisoners who were still alive, and some of them loved to roam about, moving from one major region to another.

Ruler Flood-Dragon Wing had been adventuring in the ninth dark region of the Fiend Dragon region. He knew a bit about the experts of the ninth dark region, as well as the other dark regions of the Fiend Dragon region. However, aside from the Fiend Dragon region, he didn’t know much about the experts of the other major regions.

“Blood Sword, are you a Ruler or…a Principles Masters?” He asked. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Won’t you find out after a fight with me?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Humph, then die.”

He did not waste any more words. A jet-black light suddenly flashed on his body, and the wings on his back suddenly contracted. He had originally looked like a human cultivator, but in the blink of an eye, he turned into a huge monster with wings.

“Screech!”

A shrill screech sounded. Accompanied by the sound wave attack, the screech immediately rushed into Jian Wushuang’s soul sea.

“This should be Master Si Yi’s original body.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused. “He revealed his original body at the beginning and used the strongest killing move. It seems that the cultivators in Eternal Darkness Prison are not soft-hearted.”

Jian Wushuang’s divine power surged. He would not slowly test out master Si Yi like he did with the Demon Monarch Ancient Night in the Ancient Night Demon Palace.

Master Si Yi went all out as soon as he made his move. Naturally, Jian Wushuang unleashed his strongest battle strength in an instant. He even used the Wu weeping Divine Sword, which was a principles supreme treasure, on his weapon, the trace of universe principle that Jian Wushuang had comprehended also merged into his swordsmanship.
