Chapter 2788: Backup

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In just a short moment, Yin Su’er and Yun Shan had already decided to set aside their grudges and unite against the enemy!

This scene was naturally witnessed by the four great factions.

“Yunshan, I do admire you a little. This Yin Su’er has just severely injured your faction and killed many of the Grand Divine Paragons under her command. You yourself have been forced into an extremely sorry state by her. How long has it been? You can actually endure this and take the initiative to join forces with Yin Su’er?” Namo Palace Master looked at Yunshan in surprise.

“Hmph, although this old man is not satisfied with this little girl becoming the new Fort Lord of the Red Stone Castle and has been fighting with her for so many years, no matter how fierce our fight is, it is still an internal matter of the Red Stone Castle. And this Red Stone Castle is the foundation that the Red Stone Saint and I jointly created. This old man has poured almost all of my blood, sweat, and tears into it. Compared to the survival of the Red Stone Castle, this old man will put down any personal grudges!” Yun Shan said coldly.

“Oh?” Palatial Lord Nam narrowed his eyes.

Jian Wushuang could not help but glance at Yun Shan.

Previously, he did not know much about Yunshan and only knew how to help Yin Su’er defeat it.

However, he now had some respect for Yun Shan.

Indeed, perhaps Yun Shan was unwilling to accept Yin Su’er, but he would definitely give his all to the Red Stone Castle.

“With Yun Shan’s help and the backup that Yin Su’er and I have prepared, perhaps we can really fight against the allied forces of the four great organisations,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

...

“Namo, cut the crap with them. Just attack. The Grand Divine Warriors under Yin Su’er’s faction have been taking advantage of the time to recover their injuries and their divine power. If we don’t attack now, once they’ve all recovered, we won’t have an absolute chance of victory,” the Pavilion Master of Life and Death said coldly.

Palatial Lord Nam nodded slightly.

“We have a huge advantage in this battle. We have at least a ninety percent chance of victory, but we can’t be careless. Also, we need to be careful of that Jian Yi. His ability to freeze time and space is too strange. Moreover, his comprehension of the laws of space and time is extraordinarily high. Killing ordinary high-level Grand Divine Paragons is like slaughtering chickens and dogs. Although our allied army has many Grand Divine Paragons, we can’t withstand his unscrupulous slaughter, so we need to think of a way to prevent him from slaughtering us,” said the patriarch.

“That’s simple. Just arrange for a peak-level God Supremacy to fight him.” Palatial Lord Nam smiled. “East God, this Sword One has made your Godfiend Sect so miserable. Now, I’ll hand him over to you. How about it?”

“I am more than happy to do so. I will definitely skin this brat alive and tear his bones apart!!” The Eastern Deity’s gaze was cold as he stared fixedly at Jian Wushuang.

“Do it!”

Palatial Lord Nam smiled coldly. In an instant, the more than 50 Grand Divine Warriors from the alliance of the four factions behind him moved.

Buzz ~

There were more than fifty Divine Masters, each of them exuding a powerful aura that surged over like a torrent.

“Coming!”

Jian Wushuang, Yin Su’er, Yunshan, and the others had solemn expressions.

“Fort Lord, if you have any backup plans, use them quickly,” the Unparalleled Sword said.

“Yes.” Yin Su’er nodded, then immediately took out a command talisman and crushed it.

As soon as he crushed the talisman, the experts hiding in the nearby space that Yin Su’er had arranged beforehand moved.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

In the surrounding space, eight figures shot over at an astonishing speed.

These eight figures were also eight Great Divine Paragons. Among them, there were three high-level Great Divine Paragons.

“Those are... people from Baiyun Prefecture, Demon Sealing Hall, and Eclipse Sect?”

“Three first-rate factions?”

The experts from both factions were surprised to see these eight people.

“Hmph, Yin Su’er, looks like I still underestimated you. I never thought that you would have prepared a backup plan. Although I don’t know what benefits these three experts from the first-rate factions have obtained from you to actually help you, they’re just three first-rate factions. They only have eight God Supremacies. Do you think they can change anything?” Palatial Lord Nam smiled disdainfully.

Although the appearance of the eight Divine Venerates had greatly improved Yin Su’er’s faction, the difference between their factions was too great.

Even if Yin Su’er had eight more Divine Sovereigns now, her overall strength was still greatly inferior when compared to the joint forces of the four great powers.

Moreover, in terms of the highest battle prowess, the difference was extremely great.

“Die!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Palatial Lord Nam’s aura was overwhelming, far stronger than anyone present.

He was also at the forefront of the coalition forces. As soon as he charged over, only Yin Su’er from the Red Stone Castle and the Sword Union dared to face him head-on.

However, when Yin Su’er exchanged blows with Palace Master Nan Wu... Bang!

A deep sound of collision rang out. Yin Su’er’s face paled, and she instantly retreated explosively.

Although they were both peak Divine Venerates, the difference between their strengths was instantly revealed.

Palace master Nanshu was indeed worthy of being the publicly accepted number one expert of the Saints’ World. Even though he was slightly suppressed by Jian Wushuang’s domain and his strength was slightly limited, his battle prowess was still much greater than Yin Su’er’s.

In a one-on-one battle, Yin Su’er was definitely not Palace Master Namo’s opponent.

Jian Wushuang’s expression darkened when he saw this. “Elder Tong!”

A loud roar reverberated through the world.

In the next moment, elder Tong, who had remained hidden in the dark, charged into the battlefield as a streak of light.

He immediately began to fight Palace Leader Nan Wu.

“You’re... Old Tong, you’ve broken through?”

Palace Leader Nanwu was rather surprised when he saw the peak Exalt Tong who had appeared before him.

“Haha, I’ve only broken through recently as well. I really am lucky to be able to fight against the strongest expert of the Saints’ World right after breaking through.” Old Tong laughed aloud.

“Hmph, so what if you’ve broken through? If you dare stop me, you’ll die without a doubt!” Namo Palace Master shouted coldly. The terrifying aura on his body completely pressed down on Elder Tong.

Only when he truly came face to face with the leader of the Namo Palace could elder Tong sense the tremendous pressure from her.

He also understood that the number one expert of the Sacred Elixir World was not just for show.

“Fort Lord Yin, let’s join forces and fight Palace Lord Nanwu. How about it?” Old Tong said.

“Alright.” Yin Su’er nodded heavily.

In a one-on-one battle, neither of them was a match for the Namo Palace Master. If they worked together, they might be able to put up a fight.

Boom! Boom!

At the center of the battlefield, Yin Su’er and Elder Tong joined forces to fight Palace Master Nanwu.

However, it was very obvious that even if the two of them worked together, they would not be able to gain any advantage over Palace Master Nanwu.

However, no matter what, the two of them were still entangled with the most terrifying battle prowess of Namo Palace Master.

As for the other battlefields...
