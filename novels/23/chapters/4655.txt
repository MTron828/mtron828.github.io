4656 The Demoness of Da Qian (3)

In the vast forest, a mysterious giant beast with a pitch-black body and a purple tail was flying through the forest.

On the back of this huge beast, a young man dressed like a Ranger was lying on his back, sleeping soundly.

The beast’s soft fur was like mink fur, so Jian Wushuang had been sleeping on its back ever since he subdued it.

Due to the unique characteristics of the giant beast, Jian Wushuang gave it a nice name: ‘Ah Zi’

For more than ten years, the man and the Beast never stopped, running toward the boundary of this realm.

Originally, Jian Wushuang had wanted to learn more about this place from Ah Zi, but it could not give any useful information other than some simple thoughts.

The vast forest was quickly left behind. The further they advanced, the more auras of various living beings gradually increased.

On Ah Zi’s flat and wide back, the drowsy Jian Wushuang suddenly felt a great danger.

He suddenly sat up and saw a huge bird that almost covered the sun flying at a low altitude above the sun. Its pair of eyes, which were surging with green light, locked onto Jian Wushuang almost instantly.

The aura of facing death almost made Jian Wushuang shiver. He slapped Ah Zi’s big head and said, “Run, Ah Zi! Run for your life!”

Ah Zi’s claws dug into the ground and suddenly swept out, like an arrow released from a bow, instantly sweeping thousands of miles away.

However, the huge green bird that covered the sky was even more terrifying. It caught up with Ah Zi almost at the same time.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to pull out the Tarot Divine Sword, the humongous green bird transformed into a graceful figure and fell behind Jian Wushuang.

A slender hand pressed Jian Wushuang’s palm and the Tarot Divine Sword was pushed back into the scabbard.

“Don’t look back. Run…”

A weak voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s ears, and then there was no more sound.

Jian Wushuang was stunned and subconsciously looked back. A blue-haired, beautiful woman in a blue robe and a long dress hugged him tightly from behind. She had already passed out.

Jian Wushuang looked down and saw a palm-sized wound on the chest of the lady in green. Divine blood was flowing out.

After barely recovering from the shock, Jian Wushuang hesitated about whether to throw the woman of unknown origin down. She was obviously being hunted down.

After thinking for a while, Jian Wushuang sighed and did not make up his mind.

He held the lady in green in front of him and pressed his palm against his back, transferring his divine power to her.

As expected, the meridians of the lady in green that contained that kind of energy also rejected the divine power. However, her body did not reject the divine power and was recovering rapidly.

After smelling the restless aura, Ah Zi became even more irritable and fled even faster.

However, the next moment, a deep and sinister voice resounded in the surroundings.

“The b*stards running ahead, if you don’t stop, I’ll blast you all into pieces.”

Oh no! Jian Wushuang cursed in his heart and directly pushed the woman in green in his arms forward. Ah Zi understood his meaning and rolled her into her mouth with a tilt of its head. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang pulled Ah Zi and stopped.

Nearly six figures exuding boundless energy surrounded them from all directions. They all wore loose black robes with golden patterns on the cuffs.

With just one glance, Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly contracted. The six guys who did not seem to have high status actually had the strength of Half Ancestor realm!

The six figures surrounding Jian Wushuang were not in a hurry to kill him. Instead, they sized him up with a sense of judgment.

“Which sect are you from? Why are you traveling alone in this desolate land?” one of the older men stepped forward and asked in a deep voice.

Jian Wushuang had already prepared a script in his mind. He pretended to be timid and said, “I am from the mountains. I have no sect. I was born and raised in the desolate wildlands and have never left this place.”

The elder looked at Jian Wushuang again and said, “Since you have never left this place, let me ask you, have you ever seen a green Luan?”

Jian Wushuang immediately understood that the green Luan He was talking about should be the green-robed lady who had passed out.

“I’ve never seen one before. If there’s any news, I’ll definitely report it to you, My Lords,” Jian Wushuang said in fear.

The elderly man obviously did not want to stay here any longer, but just as he was about to leave, a strong man behind him whispered, “Second Brother, we can’t complete the mission without the green Luan. Why don’t we…”

At this point, they all looked at Jian Wushuang and Ah Zi.

“Forget it. This brat is unlucky. I’ll capture them to make up the numbers,” the Elder ordered, and a total of three streaks of energy formed and shot straight toward the ground.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. He waved his hand and several vast Sword Intents clashed with the three streaks of energy.

How could a Half Ancestor be able to resist a Sword Intent divine power that could content with an Ancestor realm expert?

The vast Sword intent easily shattered the silk and then directly killed the three people closest to it without losing momentum!

Everything happened in the blink of an eye. By the time the Elder reacted, a figure with a cold aura of death had already arrived behind him.

“No, if you kill me, you’ll be offending the entire–”

Without waiting for him to finish, Jian Wushuang directly cut off his neck with his palm.

The remaining two guys, whose legs were shaking like screening chaff, were also killed by Jian Wushuang.

From the beginning to the end, six Half Ancestors were all killed in less than ten breaths.

As soon as he landed on the ground, Jian Wushuang saw that the woman in green, who was hidden in Ah Zi’s mouth, was sitting on Ah Zi’s head and looking at him with interest.

She did not look injured at all.

Seeing Jian Wushuang, the lady in green jumped down from Ah Zi’s head, raised her eyebrows, and said with a smile, “I didn’t know you were so strong.”

Jian Wushuang glanced at her from the corner of his eyes. Obviously, he did not have a good impression of her, so he immediately left.

The green-robed lady was taken aback, and then she hurriedly said, “Hey, I haven’t thanked you yet!”

“Go away, demoness!” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

The green-robed woman was immediately flustered. “You brat, you actually dare to call me a demoness? I will make you pay for this!”

With that, a few green powers flew out of her sleeves and headed straight for Jian Wushuang.

“You’re too noisy!” He waved his hand and shot out a ray of divine power, instantly shattering the green power.

The entire forest was shaking.
