4256 Jian Wushuang Takes Action

Hearing this, Cang Feng’s eyes narrowed as he stared at the Mountain Shaker commander. He sneered, “Why wouldn’t I?”

Before he could finish his sentence, Hong Ye waved his hand with a smile and said, “Alright, I’m done. Zang Feng, Mountain Shaker is an old-school Omega Ruler who has lived through multiple chaos cycles. He’s not someone you can fight against.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Hong Ye turned to look at Commander Mountain Shaker and continued, “Mountain Shaker, hurry up and send out the third candidate.”

It was obvious that Hong Ye had already won this competition.

Commander Mountain Shaker’s face was extremely gloomy. He understood that if they wanted to leave this place alive, they could only follow Hong Ye’s rules.

Taking a deep breath, Commander Mountain Shaker turned his head and looked at the Ultimate Ruler under him.

Under his gaze, everyone could not help but shrink their heads and take a few steps back.

Cang Feng had won two battles, while Ruler Grotto Profound and Ruler Earthfury had lost one to another. His might was simply too great, and they had long since been scared out of their wits.

“Who is willing to fight?” Commander Mountain Shaker asked in a deep voice.

The many Ultimate Rulers in the crowd looked at each other in silence, as quiet as cicadas in winter.

It was true that they were working for the Overlord, but that did not mean that they would still go up even if they knew that they would die.

Commander Mountain Shaker’s heart sank when he saw this. He could not help but laugh bitterly, but he did not blame them.

“Cang Feng, as you can see, none of the Rulers under my command dare to accept my challenge,” Commander Mountain Shaker took a deep breath, turned his head, and said mockingly.

“Oh?”

Cang Feng’s brows twitched as his lips curled into a mocking smile, “Are the Overlord’s subordinates all such a bunch of cowards?”

Shaking his head in boredom, Cang Feng narrowed his eyes and glanced at the faces of the many Ultimate Rulers behind Commander Mountain Shaker. “If that’s the case, then I’ll choose my own partner.”

Faced with Cang Feng’s gaze, the hearts of the many Ultimate Rulers turned cold. They could not help but take half a step back, as if they were afraid of being picked.

Seeing this, the mockery in Cang Feng’s eyes grew.

At this moment.

His gaze stopped on the face of a black-robed, black-haired, cold-looking young man.

Under his gaze, everyone unconsciously took a step back. only this person remained standing there indifferently, his face expressionless. No one could tell whether he was happy or sad.

“Who are you?” Cang Feng asked with interest.

“Blood Sword.” Jian Wushuang glanced at him and replied indifferently.

“Why didn’t you retreat when you saw me?” Cang Feng continued to ask.

“Why should I retreat?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was neither happy nor sad as he asked.

“Hahahaha, interesting.”

When Cang Feng heard this, it was as if he had just heard a joke. He twisted his neck and said, “Blood Sword, it’s you. You are the candidate for the third battle!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Ultimate Rulers behind Commander Mountain Shaker trembled and looked at Jian Wushuang with sympathy.

“Blood Sword, you’ve done enough to defeat Cold Disaster,” said Commander Mountain Shaker. “You don’t have to fight.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “It’s fine.”

When the Mountain Shaker commander heard this, he was about to say something when Cang Feng provoked him, “Blood Sword, I see that you’re holding a sword. You must be a sword cultivator, right? We sword cultivators press forward with indomitable will and have no fear in our hearts. What can you achieve by dawdling?”

Jian Wushuang laughed and looked at Cang Feng, “Do you really want to fight me that much?”

Hearing this, Cang Feng laughed in disdain, “Blood Sword, hurry up and attack. If I’m in a good mood, I might even give you a few pointers on the way of the sword.”

Pausing for a moment, Cang Feng seemed to have thought of something and added, “Blood Sword, you’re also a sword cultivator, so you should know the origin of the way of the sword, right? Let me remind you that my comprehension of the origin of the way of the sword has already reached the third stage!”

“Give me some pointers? Third-level essence of the Dao of the sword?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but feel speechless. Then he shook his head and sighed.

“As you wish, then.”

Jian Wushuang took a step forward.

When Commander Mountain Shaker saw this, he knew that there was no way to change it. He could only helplessly warn, “Blood Sword, Cang Feng is much stronger than Cold Disaster. You must not force yourself. Once you realize that you are no match for Cang Feng, I will admit defeat immediately. As long as you admit defeat, I will protect you.”

Jian Wushuang nodded to show that he understood.

Looking at Jian Wushuang, Cang Feng’s lips curled up and he asked, “Blood Sword, are you ready?”

Jian Wushuang did not answer but said calmly, “Cang Feng, I’ll only use three strikes. If you can take all three, I’ll admit defeat.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone was stunned and looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief. They wondered if they had heard wrong.

Even Hong Ye, who was smiling triumphantly, was stunned.

‘This kid, did he know what he was saying?’

“Arrogant!”

Cang Feng laughed in anger. Without any hesitation, he stomped his foot and shot into the sky!

“Secret skill, sword flower water moon!”

Boom!

An extremely sharp sword light slashed out from Cang Feng’s blue sword. A terrifying sword intent spread out in all directions, and everyone’s hearts shivered as cold sweat appeared on their foreheads.

The next moment!

Cang Feng laughed coldly as he swung his sword at Jian Wushuang!

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang’s black hair was loose and his expression was calm. He spat out three words, “The first strike.”

Chi!

With a soft sound, Jian Wushuang casually struck out a crimson sword light.

It was a simple stroke without any power, but it seemed natural and flawless, as if swordsmanship was supposed to be like this.

The blood-red sword radiance quickly met the sharp sword radiance in Cang Feng’s hand.

However, such an ordinary sword strike was like breaking dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. It instantly reduced Cang Feng’s gaudy sword radiance to dust!

Like an egg hitting a stone, the sword light could not stop Jian Wushuang’s sword at all and broke into pieces!

“How is this possible?!!!”

Cang Feng’s pupils contracted as he exclaimed. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Bang!

The blood-red sword projection landed on Cang Feng’s body, directly cleaving him down from the sky. The sword projection drew an arc in the air before crashing heavily into the ground, creating a huge crater!

Dust and dirt filled the air as Cang Feng’s hair and face became disheveled. He could no longer maintain his calm, his face filled with fear.

A few hair-like cracks appeared on the blue divine sword in his hand.

“How could this be? How could this be?”

He knelt on the ground and raised his head to look at Jian Wushuang. His eyes were full of fear and disbelief.

He was an almighty expert of the Dao of the sword who was close to the level of an invincible Ruler!

“Nothing is impossible. The impossible doesn’t just come from your ignorance.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head and spoke again with a calm expression, “The second strike.”
