Chapter 2470: Striking A Deal

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After Crimson Stone Saint finished talking, he was silent again.

He did deliberately plot against Jian Wushuang before and intentionally forcing Jian Wushuang to become his disciple.

He was very confident in thinking that anyone would submit to fate and agreed to be his disciple for the sake of personal safety or benefits. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He had definitely underestimated Jian Wushuang’s capabilities as Jian Wushuang was a terrifying huge freak.

“Is that all?” Jian Wushuang stared at the Crimson Stone Saint calmly.

What Crimson Stone Saint did was justifiable and all the dots were connected, so he sounded credible.

Although Jian Wushuang had never heard of the Crimson Stone Fort, he did read about the nine realms of Golden Crow before.

“Crimson Stone Saint, let’s make a deal,” said Jian Wushuang suddenly.

“Deal? What deal?” Crimson Stone Saint looked over.

“I won’t be your personal disciple, but I can promise you when I’m sufficiently strong and powerful, I’ll go to Crimson Stone Fort and help your daughter, Yin Su’er. On one condition, you have to give me the Fengtian Scroll.”

“Fengtian Scroll?” Crimson Stone Saint’s complexion changed slightly.

That was the greatest opportunity and the most precious treasure in Saint’s Tomb.

He planned to pass it on to his personal disciple who will claim his mantle.

However...

“Jian Wushuang, you just said you will help Su’er? How will you offer your help?” Crimson Stone Saint asked in a deep voice.

“I’ll help as much as possible of course. If I’m powerful enough, I can help to resolve all the troubles your daughter has encountered,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Are you serious? How can I trust that you will do as you’ve said?” Crimson Stone Saint asked.

“Old man, not everyone is as impervious as you to lose face. I’ll keep my word, but neither will I take an oath or make an agreement with you. I’ve made an offer and requested something in return. It’s up to you to take it up or not.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand insouciantly.

Crimson Stone Saint fell silent once again.

Crimson Stone Saint finally broke his silence and said, “Okay, let’s do it.”

Crimson Stone Saint flipped his hand as soon as he said that. The void surrounding them distorted into weird shapes as it made an opening to allow an ancient and mysterious picture scroll to emerge from within. Crimson Stone Saint directly sent it into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Jian Wushuang raised his hand and took it with a smile cracked on his face, feeling very pleased. “Smart move, that saved me from spending the time and effort.”

Crimson Stone Saint’s face twitched slightly upon hearing that.

Only then did he remember Jian Wushuang had the capabilities to destroy him. Had he refused to accept the condition, Jian Wushuang could have easily killed him, bagged the Fengtian Scroll, and taken full control over Saint’s Tomb. Jian Wushuang would have owned everything within the tomb in that case including those the Saint intended to leave for his personal disciple.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang did not intend to do so.

“Jian Wushuang, Fengtian Scroll’s origin is extraordinary. I only managed to get one of the scrolls,” said Crimson Stone Saint.

“Only one of the scrolls? You meant there are many more Fengtian Scrolls?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

The Crimson Stone Saint nodded. “Yes. I don’t know how many scrolls there are in total, but each scroll is extremely precious. Although the scroll is of little use to an Undying Saint, it’s extremely beneficial to anyone below the Undying Saint cultivation level. There are rumors stating that if one can obtain more than three Fengtian Scrolls at a time, then it would be valuable to an Undying Saint. Unfortunately, I’ve only managed to get my hands on one of them and even that alone required exceptional good luck.”

“Understood.” Anticipation rose in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

He spent 10 days meditating upon Fentian Scroll which proved to be extremely helpful for him.

He was certain that Fengtian Scroll was of great help to him and that was just a single scroll. He could not help but wonder what if he could get more scrolls...

Jian Wushuang knew fully well that it was not going to be easy getting hold of other Fengtian Scrolls.

“Jian Wushuang, I have one more thing here which I wonder if you are interested,” announced Crimson Stone Saint suddenly.

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked over.

Crimson Stone Saint smiled slightly and when he flipped his hand, there was a blood-colored token in his palm.

This blood-colored token looked very ordinary but gave off an extremely unique aura. A hint of powers suspended on its surface at the same time.

That power was neither divine power nor some sort of pressure but an esoteric power.

“This...” Jian Wushuang frowned as he studied the extraordinary token. He knew at first glance it was something special.

“This is the Heaven Slashing Token which I got on a fortuitous occasion,” explained Crimson Stone Saint.

“Heaven Slashing Token originated from the Ancient God Realm. It came from the most ancient and mysterious force—the Heaven Slashing Alliance!”

The Heaven Slashing Alliance is very unique and might have been the most unique and distinctive alliance in Ancient God Realm. Surprisingly, the Heaven Slashing Alliance does not have any entry restrictions on its members and does not care about one’s background or identity. Anyone who wishes to be a member can join the alliance even if they already belong to another sect and are holding high-level positions like leaders or senior experts in their sects.”

Of course, there are extremely high prerequisites to join the alliance. In terms of strength, one must at least be an Ultimate God, preferably a Peak Ultimate God. Besides meeting the requirement of strength and power, one must own a Heaven Slashing Token and pass the test prior to becoming a member. I heard that the members get a lot of benefits.”

“What are the benefits?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Crimson Stone Saint shook his head. “I have no idea what they are as I’ve only heard rumors about them. I heard that the Heaven Slashing Alliance is extremely influential despite being rather lenient to their members who rarely keep in contact or form close relationships. As long as one can afford to pay the price, the alliance is able to dispatch three Undying Saints or above experts to any remote territory in Ancient God Realm within a very short period of time!”

“Dispatch three Undying Saints or above experts to any remote territory in a short time? Are they really that powerful?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The Crimson Stone Saint answered solemnly, “Of course. Jian Wushuang, you ought to know that Heaven Slashing Alliance exists completely in the dark. No one knows the true identity of any Heaven Slashing Alliance’s members. They are extremely careful and will completely erase all traces of their acts so that no one can find out their identities which prevents them from being assassinated.”
