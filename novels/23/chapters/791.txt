Chapter 792: Master’s Gifts (Section A)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Well, the three magnates acted quite speedily.” Xuan Yi said with a faint smile.

“They must be fearful of us making a scene in their sects, so they didn’t dare to delay the delivery.” Bai Hu laughed.

“I’ll go and have a look.”

Palace Master Xuan Yi followed Palace Master Destruction to check the treasures. Soon, he returned.

“Master, nothing wrong with those treasures?” Xue Lingtian asked.

“Nothing wrong. The three magnates know who they’re dealing with.” Xuan Yi smiled.

“Great.”

Xue Lingtian nodded and also got to his feet. He continued, “Master, I still have many things to attend to in the Void Temple. Since the matter here is settled, please allow me to go back to the Void Temple now.”

“We shall leave, too.” Bai Hu and Purple Mountain also stood up.

This time, they had been summoned by Xuan Yi and had come in a hurry although they were all in the middle of something.

Now that the matter was over, they would naturally return to their own places.

“Well, just go.” Xuan Yi waved a hand.

Xue Lingtian and the other two bowed respectfully to Xuan Yi and then walked up to Jian Wushuang.

“Junior Brother, this is my Message Token. If you encounter any problems, just let me know through this Message Token.” Xue Lingtian smiled.

“Thanks, Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang responded in gratitude.

Bai Hu and Purple Mountain also handed their Message Tokens to Jian Wushuang. The three of them then departed.

As he watched his three Senior Brothers leave, Jian Wushuang involuntarily heaved a sigh.

Although he had not interacted much with his three Senior Brothers, Jian Wushuang could tell that the three Senior Brother all treated him with sincerity.

“You kid…” Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang, still wearing a mild smile. “Now that you’ve decided to travel, I won’t stop you. Instead, I’ll give you some treasures.”

“Treasures?” Jian Wushuang’s heart lifted.

“Including you, I’ve taken in a total of four personal disciples so far. When your three Senior Brothers left the Firmament Territory for their adventures, I also prepared some treasures for them. Each of them received three treasures, and so will you.” Xuan Yi said. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This time, I’ll give you these three treasures without asking for anything in return. But in future, I’ll never give you anything free of charge. Even when you need my help to refine magic weapons or produce elixirs, you’ll have to pay a price, understand?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

It was already very generous for a master to give each of his disciples three treasures with no strings attached.

After all, treasures would never be given freely. If one wanted them, he would need to fight for them with his own effort.

“The first treasure I reserved for you is a magic weapon.” Xuan Yi said flatly.

“A magic weapon? Is it a sword?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, but not exactly a sword.” Xuan Yi smiled. “I’ve already given you the Emperor Sword. The Emperor Sword is an Eternal Weapon, the best of all the Eternal Weapons. Its power is already very impressive.”

Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement.

The power of the Emperor Sword was indeed remarkable.

During his fierce battles in recent years, the only weapon Jian Wushuang had used was the Emperor Sword. As he made progress, he was able to fully utilize the potential of the Emperor Sword. In turn, this magic weapon at the peak of the Eternal Realm enhanced his battle strength as well.

“The Emperor Sword is a pretty good weapon for battles. But it is not enough to be your trump card or help you maximize your battle strength. Thus, I want to give you another treasure, a magic weapon that has surpassed the Eternal Realm. Yeah, this is it…” Xuan Yi smiled and held his palm out.

A miniature mountain appeared on his palm. It was covered in green woods and forest and looked rather like a real mountain.

“Master, what’s this?” Jian Wushuang stared at this miniature mountain in amazement.

This was the magic weapon that Xuan Yi had prepared for him?

This was just a scaled-down version of a mountain!

“Well, you don’t recognize it?” Xuan Yi was still beaming at Jian Wushuang. “You’ve spent a total of six years at this place practicing martial skills.”

“Practiced for six years?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback. He gazed at the miniature mountain with a terrified look.

“This, this is the Sword Mountain?” Jian Wushuang stuttered.

He had stayed for a relatively long period in the Ancient Sect. He had spent six years on the Sword Mountain for study and practice.

However, the Sword Mountain was a majestic mountain.

While now…

Jian Wushuang stared unblinkingly at the small mountain on Xuan Yi’s palm. Its appearance was truly quite similar to the Sword Mountain that he had lived on for years despite the disparity in size.

“Your eyes didn’t betray you. This is truly the Sword Mountain. I’ve refined the Sword Mountain with special means. Didn’t I ask the three magnates for 5 kilograms of the Orichalcum? That is because I need it to further refine this Sword Mountain.” Xuan Yi said, beaming.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t believe his ears.

Refining a huge mountain into a treasure?

What kind of means did Xuan Yi use?

“Don’t look down on it. The Sword Mountain itself has some very powerful Restriction Formations. Though I’ve refined it, those Restriction Formations can still work. Therefore, there are two major uses of this Sword Mountain. First, it can turn into a sword-shaped offensive magic weapon.”

As he spoke, Xuan Yi flipped his palm. The miniature mountain in his hand instantly started to change. Very quickly, it turned into a longsword which was more than two meters long. This longsword was scarlet, as if it had been soaked in blood.

Moreover, though it was a magic weapon transformed from a mountain, the edge of the longsword was extremely sharp and glinted with chilling light.

“This…”

Jian Wushuang goggled at the two-meter-long scarlet longsword. It looked quite normal on the surface. But when Jian Wushuang saw its Sword Heart, he saw a world of hell with innumerable corpses littering the ground and a vast ocean of blood.

This was definitely the appalling Sword of Killing.

“What a horrible sword.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“This is the state when you use it as an offensive magic weapon. If you also turn into an Ancient God, you can control its size. Next, I’ll show you the mountain that it can change into.” As Xuan Yi finished these words, he tossed the weapon up in the air.

Rumbling…

A gigantic mountain suddenly appeared in the Void over their heads. It obscured the sun and the sky as it fell rapidly towards them.

At the bottom of the mountain, there were countless abstruse and mysterious cracks. These looked like open mouths that would swallow everything in their path.

“This state is devised to suppress your enemies. It has a built-in Secret Skill for suppression. When you refine it and become its master, you can directly grasp this skill.” Xuan Yi said.
