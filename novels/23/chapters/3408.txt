“Master Flame Mountain, thank you for letting me win.” Master Ancient Wheel stopped and said.

“Hmph, you’re not as good as me, so there’s nothing to be proud of.” Master Flame Mountain snorted. He was very clear that he had indeed done his best, but in terms of strength, he was indeed slightly weaker than

the Master Ancient Wheel.

“Ancient Wheel, don’t be complacent. Although you have defeated me and won one battle, your blood ancestor lineage has no hope of winning the remaining two battles.” After Master Flame Mountain finished

speaking, his body flashed and he left the hundred battle arena, he rushed toward the place where the experts of the serene ancestor lineage gathered.

Master Ancient Wheel opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he did not say anything. He also turned around and left the hundred battle arena.

When the surrounding experts saw this scene, they all sighed.

“As expected, the blood ancestor’s bloodline won this match.”

“It’s normal to win. In terms of strength, Master Ancient Wheel is slightly stronger than Master Flame Mountain.”

“Unfortunately, the hundred battle arena has three matches and two out of three wins. Even if the blood ancestor’s bloodline relied on Master Ancient Wheel to win one match, there’s no chance of winning the

remaining two matches. The nether ancestor’s bloodline knows this, which is why they brazenly told the blood ancestor’s bloodline about the name list and the order of the experts to fight.”

“Just wait and see. The blood ancestor’s bloodline won’t stand a chance in the next two matches. I hope they don’t lose too badly.”

Everyone chatted and laughed. Even though the blood ancestor’s bloodline had already won one match, none of them were optimistic about the blood ancestor’s bloodline. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Xuan Master also laughed coldly and directly rushed toward the hundred battle arena.

“Ancient Wheel, just send anyone to fight with me.” Master Xuan sneered.

The spectating experts also looked in the direction of the blood ancestor lineage with interest.

“In this second battle, who will the blood ancestor lineage send? Will they send Master Stabbing Heart?”

“It shouldn’t be. Among the Principles Masters of the blood ancestor lineage, besides Master Ancient Wheel, Master Stabbing Heart is the strongest. At the very least, he has reached the pinnacle of the void fourth

stage. If Ancient Wheel is a little smarter, he can send anyone to fight with Master Xuan in this second battle. Even if he loses, it doesn’t matter. As for Master Stabbing Heart, it’s best to stay in the third battle and fight

with Leaf Master!”

“That’s right. Although Master Stabbing Heart’s strength is a little weaker than that of Leaf Master, as long as he performs well, he can definitely fight with Leaf Master. There might even be a chance for him to win.

However, if he were to send any other Principles Master onto the battlefield, he would not be a match for Leaf Master.”

The surrounding experts who were watching the battle discussed animatedly.

They had even started to choose experts for the blood ancestor’s bloodline. In the end, most of them thought that it was best to choose a random Principles Master to fight against the Xuan Master in the second

match, so as to deliberately lose one match, then, they would put the victory of this match on Master Stabbing Heart in the third match.

However, these people were going to miscalculate in the end.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis, the second match…” Master Ancient Wheel looked at Jian Wushuang.

“T’ll do it this time.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Then, under the astonished gaze of Master Ancient Wheel, he directly rushed into the hundred-battle arena.

When Jian Wushuang appeared in the hundred-battle arena, not only Master Ancient Wheel was shocked, but also the experts from the nether ancestor’s bloodline and the surrounding spectators were completely

stunned.

“A Saint?”

“In the second battle, the blood ancestor’s bloodline sent an Immortal Saint to fight Xuan Master?”

“Even if they want to give up this battle, they should send a Principles Master, right? Sending an Immortal Saint to fight, isn’t that humiliating Xuan Master?”

Many people had strange expressions.

But some people recognized Jian Wushuang the moment they saw him.

“This man…is Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“He is Heavenly Sword Marquis. He said yesterday that he is the descendant of the Xue Bei and a member of the blood ancestor’s bloodline.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis is going to fight and challenge Xuan Master?”

“Is Heavenly Sword Marquis courting death? Although I know he is talented, he is just a Saint.”

Those who knew Jian Wushuang’s identity were stunned.

Even Master Ancient Wheel was suspicious of Jian Wushuang.

“Sir, what is your plan?” Master Ancient Wheel looked at Demon Master Chenhuo, trying to get some information from him.

However, Chenhuo said coldly, “Don’t worry, just watch.”

Hearing this, Master Ancient Wheel could only shake his head helplessly. He turned his eyes and looked at the hundred-battle arena again.

Jian Wushuang stood in front of Xuan Master in the hundred-battle arena. They were only a few hundred meters apart and were facing each other.

Xuan Master frowned when he saw the person in front of him was Jian Wushuang. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, what do you mean?”

“Haha, Xuan Master, can’t you see it?”

“Since I’m here, I’m here to fight you on behalf of the blood ancestor’s bloodline. I proved yesterday that I’m qualified to fight on behalf of the blood ancestor’s bloodline, don’t you think so?” Jian Wushuang said with a

smile.

“That’s true, but you’re just an Immortal Saint. If I can’t control my power well and accidentally kill you, what should I do?” Xuan Master said in a low voice.

“Haha, you can rest assured. More than 400 years ago, even the three masters of the Saint Realm couldn’t kill me. It would be too ridiculous for you to kill me,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Xuan Master was stunned.

“Xuan Master, you don’t have to worry about anything. I also want to remind you to use all of your strength at the beginning. Otherwise, you might be defeated by me, and then your Xuan Master will lose face,” Jian

Wushuang said.

“Humph, I, the Xuan Master, have reached the peak of the five realms of the Void Realm. How could I be defeated by you, an Immortal Saint? What a joke!” Xuan Master snorted with disdain.

“Let’s try it first.”

Jian Wushuang smiled, but his eyes suddenly became cold.

As the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand, a chill spread in the surrounding area.

Jian Wushuang moved!

His body fluttered like a leaf swaying in the wind, but his speed was astonishing. In the blink of an eye, he had appeared in front of the Xuan Master. Then, the Blood Mountain Sword slashed directly!

This sword seemed to be light and casual, but the moment the sword light slashed out, the power of the three wills that Jian Wushuang had grasped burst out instantly. Together with the life divine power, it

immediately revolved, making the power of this sword…it instantly increased by an unknown number of times!
