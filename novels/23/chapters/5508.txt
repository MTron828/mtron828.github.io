Chapter 5507 ¬†Unprecedented

At this moment, there were still some cultivators who had received messages but hadn't had the chance to check, only to find that the token was constantly flashing.

Each time, it signaled the transmission of a message.

Dao Lord: Jian Wushuang, breakthrough to the 12th level.

Dao Lord: Jian Wushuang, breakthrough to the 13th level.

...

Dao Lord: Jian Wushuang, breakthrough to the 20th level.

"Oh Heavens, is he really human?" someone exclaimed continuously, then stared directly at the leaderboard in the grand hall.

On the breakthrough list.

Ranked first was Jian Wushuang.

This was an overall ranking.

Most of the top positions were occupied by Dao Lords because it was easier for them to make breakthroughs.

Now Jian Wushuang had directly surpassed the first position.

Ranked first!

Breaking through 10 levels in one go.

And it was still changing.

12th level, 16th level, 20th level!

Now, not only the formidable individuals within the Beiwang Tower were astonished but also some challengers who were attempting the trials emerged to see what was happening.

"It's Jian Wushuang, the Inheritor who was taken away before reaching the Grave God Mountain!"

Many recognized Jian Wushuang's identity.

Si Tian, who returned from Fenyang Island, stood in the grand hall at this moment, his brows furrowed tightly.

"Dao Lord?" Si Tian's expression darkened.

Then he snorted coldly, thinking to himself, 'He's only a Dao Lord. After all, a Dao Lord is just a Dao Lord. As long as he doesn't complete the Dao Merge, I can suppress you any time."

Si Tian's current strength was among the top ranks even among the tier 5 Emperors. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

Although he hadn't achieved a breakthrough, he could reach the pinnacle.

This time he came specifically for the 49th level, and he was quite confident.

At this moment, he still had confidence in himself. Even if Jian Wushuang defied the natural order and broke through to the 20th level, it would only be equivalent to the strength of the 13th level, comparable to a complete-stage tier 4 Emperor at most.

There was still a considerable gap between them.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang was still very poor. He personally witnessed Jian Wushuang unable to produce even 100 million cubic godstones and ultimately failed to enter the valley.

Wanyan was the only calm person in the grand hall at this moment; he wasn't surprised at all.

Back in the blood mist of the Demon Sound Mountain, Jian Wushuang had erupted with the prowess of a tier 6 Emperor, and now he emerged from seclusion again for battle.

It's likely that he had already surpassed him by quite a bit.

At least he could break through to around the 40th level.

Adding the 10 levels from Dao Lords, that made it 40 levels, reaching the ranks of tier 6 Emperors.

Once the Dao Merge succeeded, he would directly become a tier 6 Emperor.

This was probably unprecedented, with no one before and no one to come after.

The current Beiwang Tower not only attracted numerous inheritors but also had many powerful Individuals from the Elder Palace coming to observe.

Among them was Qiuhuang, who even manifested an avatar.

"In the blink of an eye, is this kid already close to my level?" Qiuhuang shook inwardly.

Wu Zuo took a step and arrived next to Qiuhuang, encouraging him, "You have to work hard, or Jian Wushuang will surpass you."

"I've agreed to that matter, but I can only maintain it for three breaths. Everything depends on you!" Qiuhuang's expression remained unchanged as he transmitted his thoughts.

At the beginning of Jian Wushuang's proposed plan, Qiuhuang hesitated a bit, mainly fearing that Jian Wushuang might not be capable, and others might enter before killing him.

Now it seemed that there were no unexpected factors.

Wu Zuo was secretly pleased; the plan had a 70 percent chance of success.

With the Law Enforcement Hall cooperating with Qiuhuang, who was in charge of the central teleportation array, they could fully ensure Jian Wushuang's safe departure.

The two only exchanged a glance before leaving.

They didn't linger in this place.

Wu Zuo was well aware of Jian Wushuang's strength; there was nothing much to see here.

Could the future Inheritor of the Qishen Temple be weak?

The stronger Jian Wushuang demonstrated, the more confident Wu Zuo became in the path he had chosen.

In the future, when Jian Wushuang reached the pinnacle, inherited Qishen's legacy, not to mention a Hall Master, even making him a Palace Master wouldn't be excessive.

He had indeed helped Jian Wushuang quite a bit.

Now he stood firmly on the same boat, becoming Jian Wushuang's confidant.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang inside the Beiwang Tower was still unaware that he had attracted the attention of countless onlookers.

He was still immersed in his cultivation.

By now, he had reached the 40th level. The opponents he encountered were all tier 5 Emperors.

However, Jian Wushuang still showed no intention of drawing his sword.

The Phantom Sword Technique, surrounded by countless condensed Sword Qi, was formidable enough to slay any adversary.

Yet, the powerful figure shrouded in black mist had not revealed his title until now.

"I..."

Swish!

Countless Sword Qi swept through, dispersing the black mist once again.

Jian Wushuang curiously surveyed the changes around him.

Starting from the 10th level, stones appeared on the planet; at the 20th level, water emerged. By the 30th level, vegetation had grown, and now, at the 40th level, the transformations of this planet had surpassed Jian Wushuang's imagination.

Life had unexpectedly flourished.

"Is this the power of All Things?" Jian Wushuang exclaimed with joy upon this discovery.

This planet was connected to the power of All Things.

The similarity between this planet and the one he encountered in the starry sky was striking.

This connection proved immensely beneficial to his power of All Things.

He no longer worried about his power of All Things undergoing deviation; instead, he allowed it to evolve freely.

Because he realized that the ultimate evolution of the power of All Things might lead to life.

It was an entirely new force.

Godly power was merely the power of a divine body.

The power of All Things originated from the Myriad Dao Origin Source.

And after the transformation of All Things, what would it become?

Thought power gave rise to consciousness, consumption fostered life's robust growth, and the power of All Things evolved life.

That was the Life power.

As Jian Wushuang contemplated this, his aura became somewhat weighty‚Äîthe Life power.

He had never even heard of such a thing.

The Life power!

After another change in the surroundings, Jian Wushuang noticed an increase in the number of fish in the water.

These were the most primitive forms of life, creatures that still relied on water for survival and had not yet evolved the ability to exist on land.

"Well, let me give them a boost!" Jian Wushuang revealed a slight smile. He wanted to test whether the speculated Life power truly existed within him.

A powerful force of the power of All Things descended, followed by a rapid transformation.

At that moment, his Extreme Dao also, no longer suppressed by the power of All Things, began to undergo a metamorphosis.

Directly reaching the perfection of the ninth level.

The Extreme Dao was completely perfected, and the power of All Things also underwent a thorough transformation.

However, what emerged from the transformation was not the Life power.

Instead, it was a peculiar halo radiating green light.

As this unique force just came into being, the force of devouring swarmed in, starting to consume it.

"So, it's like this?"

The fusion turned out to be like this.

Without him needing to do anything, the three forces quickly devoured and then merged.

The Life power had already taken root the moment he conceived it.

A completely new power!

If someone could still master the power of All Things before, the Life power was something he had never even heard of.

Mastering the Life power meant perhaps living and dying along with all things.

Everything was at his whim.

The breakthrough on Jian Wushuang's side surprised the powerful figure in the distant black mist.

It didn't notice any visible change in Jian Wushuang; it was just curious why Jian Wushuang didn't directly kill him this time.
