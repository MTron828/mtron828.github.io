Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was the 121st year after Jian Wushuang had regained his consciousness.

“Third Brother, 11 of the 36 prefectures have fallen into the hands of the Big Three Countries. Emperor Xiao and Emperor had put up a fight, but were defeated due to their existing injuries. The fight almost caused Emperor Yun his life .”

“The Big Three’s force is formidable, Tang of the East is unable to overcome it!”

It was the 128th year.

“Third Brother, the Big Three Countries have already fight their way to the front of the Imperial Palace. Emperor Xiao had decided to give up Tang of the East and depart with Her Highness. I had no choice but to let them know that you are alive.

“Knowing that you are alive, Emperor Xiao was elated and immediately decided against leaving. He paid a hefty sum for the Eternal World’s greatest Formation master, Dao Master Spirit, to set up a strong Formation around the Imperial Palace!”

“Hmph, experts from the Big Three Countries had tried to break the Formation but failed. Even their Celestial Masters remain helpless in front of the Formation.”

It was the 210th year.

“Third Brother, I have good news, very good news. Her Highness has woken up!”

“Not only has she woken up, she also improved her strength and is almost as strong as a Celestial Master. She even battled against experts from Big Three Countries outside the Formation. Many Dao Masters of Big Three Countries couldn’t defeat her.”

“Third Brother, don’t worry. Her Highness and the Formation will prevent the experts of Big Three Countries’ from taking over. Emperor Xiao has decided to wait for your return.

It was the 580th year.

“Third Brother, have you not returned yet?”

“We have been hiding within this Formation for hundreds of years. Although we’re safe, the people from Big Three Countries curse us from outside of the palace every day. Their words are so foul that even I’m irritated, let alone Emperor Xiao!”

“Terrible, such a terrible feeling!”

“Third Brother, come back soon and kill this bunch of bastards!”

In the cave dwellings deep underground, sat a figure with his legs crossed and surrounded by dark golden light.

He had a handsome face and wore short hair. His muscles were bulging and the curves were almost perfect. The most attractive feature of his were the three golden Quadrangular Star images between his eyebrows.

The figure shook all of a sudden. In the next moment, the figure opened his eyes. A streak of golden light went past in a flash. Thereafter, a huge rift, within which consisted of nothing, appeared in the space in front of him.

Hum!

The dark golden light that had surrounded Jian Wushuang’s body vanished. Jian Wushuang’s body landed on the ground, and he promptly put on a scarlet robe.

“One thousand and two hundred years!

“My body has finally recovered!”

Jian Wushuang clasped both of his hands firmly, eyes flashing.

It had been the longest and the most mundane years for Jian Wushuang.

During this period of time, he had concentrated on healing his body, and could not cultivate his skills at all.

Now, he has finally healed his body, and upgraded his strength to a higher level.

Eyes narrowed, Jian Wushuang released his Bloodline Power. Instantly, his entire body turned to a shade of dark golden, while at the same time, the three Quadrangular Star images between his eyebrows gleamed.

“Three Star Ancient God!”

“And an fully established Three Star Imperial God at that!”

Jian Wushuang was delighted.

He had previously consumed King Luo Zhen’s Inheritance Essence Blood by force and even though 90% of it had gone to waste, the remaining power was not ineffectual.

Over the past one thousand and two hundred years, while Jian Wushuang was healing himself, he had completely assimilated the Ancient God Power that he had cultivated. As a result, he had not only became an Imperial God, but also enhanced his strength, attaining the Third Star Level!

One must know that a Three Star Ancient God was as powerful as a Dao Master in the world of humans.

But unfortunately, although his Ancient God Power had been enhanced, his ranking was not, which means that his ranking was still of the Eternal Level.

“Well, if you had slowly consumed the Inheritance Essence Blood, you would have at least become a Six-star Imperial God. Because of your careless handling, however, you have only achieved the Third Star level. Fortunately, your Imperial Bloodline has being fully accomplished.” King Gu spoke up.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang silently smiled, having no regrets at all. “I’m just grateful that my Imperial Bloodline has completely formed. As for improving my strength… that’s something supplementary and desirable, and I will not force myself to achieve anything.”

“That’s easy for you to say, but you have just wasted King Luo Zhen’s painstaking efforts. Keep in mind that if you can’t reach the Six Star level on your own, I will be the first one to come after you.”

“I’ll try my best.” Jian Wushuang shrugged, and immediately felt the power stirring within himself.

“During the battle of the Imperial Palace, my combat power had became as strong as that of a Rank One Dao Master. Now that my Ancient God Power has made a breakthrough by reaching the Third Star level, I’m stronger than ever.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with excitement.

“I have reached the Three Star Imperial God level, and there is a long way to go to achieve the ultimate level of the Ancient God Power. Nevertheless, my strength is comparable to that of a Rank Two Dao Master in the world of humans. My tactics and strategies will bring me one step closer to the peak of Rank Two!”

Ancient Gods were advantageously skilled.

The strength of a top Three Star Imperial God was comparable to that of a top Dao Master of Rank Three.

Jian Wushuang had reached the Third Star level recently. Yet despite being an Imperial God, he could only compete with Rank Two Dao Masters. With the addition of his strategies, he can advance towards the top of Rank Two. In comparison with his previous power at Rank One, he had indeed progressed tremendously.

“King Gu, I remember you mentioned that there are many great items left behind by Dao Yuanzi that’ll be helpful to me. What are they?” Jian Wushuang asked.

King Gu, who had been nesting in the cave dwellings, swiftly flung an Interspatial Ring towards Jian Wushuang after hearing this.

“That is Dao Yuanzi’s Interspatial Ring. Take a close look at it. I have already picked out the treasures which will be of great use for you.” King Gu answered.

Taking over the Interspatial Ring, Jian Wushuang scrutinized it.
