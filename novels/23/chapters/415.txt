Chapter 416: Origin Mark

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang sat quietly in a cave in the Inner Area. The cave was rarely visited and was surrounded by vast amounts of Slaughter Origin. Slaughter Origin rushed into the armlet on his left arm and condensed gradually into a black Mark.

This black mark had the faint appearance of a flame, but it did not look like a regular one.

“Origin Mark!”

When the black Mark condensed, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with pleasant surprise.

Origin Mark would condense only when his comprehension of this Origin had reached an extremely high level.

When Jian Wushuang had entered Inner Area half a year ago, he had been a step away from condensing Origin Mark. As he battled Stage Three experts during the past half year, he had made great progress in all aspects.

Including his Sword Principle and Origin comprehension...

This had finally culminated in his achievement of condensing his first Origin Mark.

“Origin Mark.”

Jian Wushuang stared at the Origin Mark on his arm. Using his will, he directed the Origin Mark’s power into his hand. He waved his hand and a terrible blast swept the cave with a loud roar.

“What immense power!”?

Jian Wushuang was ecstatic.

Origin Mark had greatly improved his strength. Jian Wushuang estimated that his strength had trebled.

“When the Origin Mark was condensed, my overall strength increased by nearly three times. My battle strength now should be equal to that of an expert at the Peak of Stage Three,” Jian Wushuang whispered.

Before this moment, he had reached the high level of Stage Three by virtue of Double First-grade Sword Soul, Blood River Realm, physical strength, and Heavenly Creation Skill.

While it was just a single Slaughter Origin Mark, it had strengthened his overall power by three times and elevated him to the Peak of Stage Three.

“Experts in the Inner Area have specials means or abilities to stay alive, even if their strength is weak. Before I condensed the Origin Mark, it was already difficult to kill me because I had the assistance of the Realm. Now...”?Jian Wushuang curled his lips into a playful smile.

Experts who dared to adventure in the Inner Area were generally confident of their own strength or their ability to survive.

During his half year in the Inner Area, he had fought many experts from the opposite camp. He had only managed to kill two of them, who were ordinary Stage Three experts. While they had skills that would have saved their lives, they had been restrained by his Realm and had failed to escape.

It had taken a long time for him to kill them.

Only two experts.

He had also suffered several crises. The most dangerous one was a battle with an expert at the Peak of Stage Three. That man was weaker than Xue Luo, but he was well-rounded with no obvious weaknesses. Under Blood River Realm’s suppression, he had still been faster than Jian Wushuang.

At the beginning of the fight, Jian Wushuang had already sustained serious wounds and had been?thoroughly outclassed.

Thanks to his Blood Puppet, he had narrowly resolved the crisis.

Now, he was at the Peak of Stage Three because of the power of Origin Energy. With the assistance of his Realm, he would be threatened by few experts.

…

In the vast Void.

A burly purple-haired man, clothed in a black shirt with two long spears on his back, slowly marched forward. He cast his eyes warily at the surroundings.

The two long spears could be connected together.

Suddenly, he saw someone rush toward him.

“That’s...” the purple-haired man recognized the man.

“Swordsman.”

In the past half year, Jian Wushuang had earned a reputation in the Inner Area. He had fought the purple-haired man before. At that time, the purple-haired man had an absolute advantage, but he had failed to kill Jian Wushuang as the latter had escaped with the help of his Realm.

“Dong Ming,” Jian Wushuang stood in front of the purple-haired man and looked at him.

“What? I taught you a lesson last time. Do you want me to beat you again?” Dong Ming, the purple-haired man, sneered at Jian Wushuang.

“I was indeed not strong enough the last time. I’ve improved my strength since then, so I’ll test it on you,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Test it on me? Hum!” Dong Ming snorted. An intense and horrifying aura began to surge from his body.

“Haha, let’s start,” Jian Wushuang laughed and released his Blood River Realm.

“This Realm again?” Dong Ming’s face darkened. He had failed to kill Jian Wushuang the last time because of this realm.

“Damn, if it weren’t for this Realm, you would just be a bug in the Inner Area. You would have been killed countless times,” Dong Ming growled.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. A freezing sword light penetrated the Void and roared toward Dong Ming.

Two tall Sword Soul Phantoms stood behind Jian Wushuang. They also brandished longswords with torrential sword light.

In?this slash, Jian Wushuang released his full power of Sword Soul and physical strength. He also?brought his Origin Mark to its extreme. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Dong Ming did not take Jian Wushuang seriously at first. After all, he had fought Jian Wushuang a few months ago and had outclassed the latter. He did not expect Jian Wushuang to improve much during such a short period.

Dong Ming realized his mistake in underestimating Jian Wushuang when the sword light appeared.

“This...”

Eyes widened in surprise,?Dong Ming swung the long spear in his hand and stabbed forward.

The movement was similar to a poisonous snake striking out of a hole.

Clang!

A deep crash sounded.

“What?”

Dong Ming’s face darkened. His long spear point had been twisted sideways by the sword light. The sword light continued to sweep toward him with great momentum.

Dong Ming immediately pulled his long spear back and swung it. He narrowly dodged the sword light, but he was blown backward by its power.

“Peak of Stage Three?”

Dong Ming was stunned.

Dong Ming was close to the Peak of Stage Three, but he was swept away by Jian Wushuang’s slash. It seemed that Jian Wushuang was much stronger than him in battle strength and had truly reached the Peak of Stage Three.
