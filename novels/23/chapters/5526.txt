Chapter 5526 ¬†Eternal Calamity Sword Technique, ¬†Annihilation

It was too difficult to merge the power of Life, so he had to resort to his supreme technique, channeling the Life power into the Sword Qi.

Only through this could he unleash immense combat strength.

Whether it was the formidable power of All Things or the power of Samsara, merging them onto his own Dao was exceedingly challenging.

"The journey of life is, in itself, countless tribulations!" Jian Wushuang floated above the Origin Source Sea, wielding the Jueyun Sword.

"The Eternal Calamity Sword Technique can also represent an eternal space, an eternal universe. Like all things, it is only in a different direction. The first calamity is in the Dao of the Sword!"

Jian Wushuang suddenly raised his hand, and the Jueyun Sword struck out, causing ripples across the four seas!

This sword technique!

It could slay a tier 6 Emperor.

The pinnacle supreme technique 'Eternal Calamity' was his creation throughout his life, intimately linked with his journey.

The tribulations he had faced were far more than just a myriad of calamities.

When he was weak, the first calamity before him was the Dao of the Sword.

Now, having mastered it all in one sword, it was a testament to the way of the sword, and a declaration to himself.

Although the Extreme Dao was powerful, it had followed him for a short time, lacking any special sentiment.

The Sword Dao was different. From its faint beginning, it accompanied him, as if it were innate.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have constantly diverted his attention to explore the Dao of the Sword. Having a more potent Extreme Dao, why bother cultivating the Ultimate Dao? It would only make him uneasy.

During the Dao Merge, he only needed to abandon the Sword Dao.

But if he did, would he be content?

Jian Wushuang pondered deeply within himself.

The Myriad Dao Sword Sovereign! T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

In the vast array of Daos he mastered, he singularly cherished the Dao of the Sword.

He aimed to exalt the Sword Dao, elevating it to untouchable heights.

Among the Myriad Daos, he sought to bring the sword to its pinnacle, the strongest and most perfect posture.

Moreover, the sword's decisiveness suited him well.

"Eternal Calamity Sword Technique!" Jian Wushuang's eyes burned with passion as he gazed at the sword, exclaiming, "Finally, success!"

Although the Ultimate Sword Dao had not yet entered the ninth realm, the sword strike he had created could already slay a tier 6 Emperor.

Due to the transformed power of Life infused within, this sword strike contained too much.

With a swing of the sword, it wasn't just a simple force of killing; above, it also harbored Thought power, Heart power, Devour, the power of All Things, and even Life itself.

A strike of the sword could bring about annihilation!

"Let's call it 'Annihilation' then!" Jian Wushuang murmured.

Then, he resumed his cultivation.

He possessed numerous universe crystals, rapidly advancing in the realm of space and continually exploring.

The boundary of the black hole was also approaching.

This time, his adversaries were many, not just Tie San alone, but the entire Elder Palace.

Fortunately, the strongest of the three Palace Masters was in seclusion, and Palace Master Chang Feng was absent. Only Palace Master Lu Hua offered full support.

Wu Zuo was the manipulator behind the plan.

With the supreme-peak not making a move, only those peak-level Emperors remained.

Although Wu Zuo would support him in secret, everything was uncertain.

He had to enhance his strength to the utmost.

Otherwise, there was a risk of exposure.

Their plan was in progress, and Shen Ling's scheme was also unfolding.

The supreme-peak expert hidden in the shadows manipulated some powerful figures within the Elder Palace in secrecy.

A darkness was enveloping the entire Elder Palace.

In the shadows of the Elder Palace...

"Shadow Three, Sixteen, and Seventeen are in position, ready to move at any moment!"

"No rush, wait a bit longer. If we act now, we'll expose ourselves. We can't be hasty!"

"Jian Wushuang is in prison, and Shadow Fourteen is in the Enforcement Hall. Nothing can go wrong!"

"Wait a bit more!"

This Shadow Three was one of the top three figures in the Shadow Sect, possessing supreme-peak strength.

Time passed swiftly.

Thousands of years, in the mundane mortal world, marked the birth of a civilization, the succession of several dynasties. Yet, for cultivators, it was but a fleeting moment, a breath.

On this day, the island where Longevity Hall was located was exceptionally lively, with all the palaces transformed into shades of red.

The areas previously destroyed by Jian Wushuang had long since been restored.

Not to mention, today was the grand wedding of Tie San, the Hall Master of Longevity Hall, and the entire island had undergone a thorough renovation.

At ten in the morning, everyone on the island was busy.

For this grand wedding, Tie San had brought in a group of Dao Lords from the outside world to handle the preparations, as the manpower on the island was insufficient and needed careful arrangements.

The visitors this time were all significant figures, each carrying weight in the Elder Palace.

Even the rival Divine Temple had sent formidable individuals.

Inside the main hall of Longevity Hall, numerous tables were already set up. Some relatively weaker Emperors had sensibly arrived early, giving face to Tie San.

In the grand hall's entrance, Tie San personally welcomed each guest. Whether they were tier 4 or tier 6 Emperors, he engaged in warm conversations with everyone.

Even several tier 6 Emperors were arranged outside the island, welcoming from a distance.

However, most of the guests this time were native Emperors from the Four Great Secret Realms and some elders. As for the Inheritors, they were few and far between.

Some of the Inheritors tied to the Elder Palace did come, such as Emperor Si Tian.

"Master!" Si Tian respectfully bowed.

"Disciple, you receive the distinguished guests here; I'll go to the rear hall to take a look!" Tie San always had a smiling face, and he had nothing to say to this disciple.

Not only in cultivation but also in financial matters, he had provided substantial assistance.

Si Tian's situation was similar to his, with average aptitude but exceptionally good luck.

Moreover, Si Tian had never disappointed him; each time, he steadily improved.

Now, he had already reached the peak-level tier 5, passing through the 48th level in the Beiwang Tower.

Not long after breaking through tier 5, he possessed such strength; in the future, he was expected to be a supreme genius.

Tie San put down what he was doing and walked into the rear hall.

Inside the hall, bright red silk was arranged, very festive.

"Miaoyi!" Tie San strolled over, his face full of smiles.

Gong Miaoyi smiled lightly, "Is everything arranged outside?"

"Everything is ready, just waiting for you!"

"After today..." Gong Miaoyi raised her head, looking at Tie San, and said with anticipation, "Is my father really in the mine?"

Tie San nodded and said, "I didn't dare to inform Big Brother about this matter, but I asked the people around him to help me investigate. That swordsman is very similar to your father!"

"When shall we go then?" Gong Miaoyi said happily.

"After today, anytime!" Then Tie San hesitated, "Just..."

Gong Miaoyi's expression became serious, saying solemnly, "As long as we find my father, I'll entrust myself to my husband for the rest of my life!"

"Good, I won't let you down!"

Tie San was very excited.

Initially, he was afraid that Gong Miaoyi wouldn't agree, after all, being a peak-level tier 5 Emperor, generally, they had pride, and she was also a woman with a unique constitution.

Now, he had worried too much.

As long as he obtained Gong Miaoyi, with his profound skills, entering the supreme-peak, he would naturally not mistreat her.

By then, he could also help Gong Miaoyi swiftly break through and step into tier 6.
