When he was communicating with Qiu Yue and found out that they were on Tai Yuan Star, Jian Wushuang found it fishy.

After all, Qiu Yue and the others were their own servants. What they wanted to do was to serve him and help him to take care of Sword Star. Why would they need to work elsewhere?

Then, looking at the sight before him…

Jian Wushuang didn’t need to ask and he understood.

“Young man, who are you?” The bald elderly holding a green whip looked at Jian Wushuang as he squinted his eyes.

“Sword Star, Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang spoke coldly.

“Jian Wushuang? Disciple of Star Palace?” The bald elderly was shocked.

Although he was a Universe God in the Third Heaven, he wasn’t the real disciple of Lineage of Star. In other words, he was just a servant in Lineage of Star. He didn’t have any identity token and hence he couldn’t feel the aura of disciples of Star Palace on Jian Wushuang. He couldn’t feel the token aura but he had heard of Jian Wushuang’s name.

Even though they were in Lineage of Star, the ordinary disciples didn’t bother with Jian Wushuang, However, he wasn’t someone a servant could provoke and get involved with.

“I see. It’s Mister Jian Wushuang. I am Bai Lipeng,” the bald elderly replied humbly.

“Bai Lipeng? You’re the one who brought my people to Tai Yuan Star?” Jian Wushuang spoke in a low voice.

“This… Mister Jian Wushuang, I think you misunderstood. I never forced them to work here. They came willingly. You can ask them if you do not believe me,” the bald elderly Bai Lipeng smiled faintly. He wasn’t worried that Qiu Yue would tell him the truth because, as long as Qiu Yue wasn’t stupid, they would know that their owner couldn’t possibly provoke his owner.

Hence, they could only say that they did it willingly. Then, the matter would be diminished, which was beneficial for both parties.

However, if the truth were to be told and even if Jian Wushuang had the heart to come forward on their behalf, he didn’t have the power to. In the end, he would only be inviting trouble. Similarly, it wouldn’t end well for them either.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and glanced at the people around him. He noticed that the maids and servants had lowered their heads. Even Qiu Yue stopped before she spoke and then lowered her head like everyone else.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t surprised but glared at Bai Lipeng. He glared at the whip in his hand and said, “Do you think I’m blind? The look like this and you say that they did it willingly?”

“Mister Jian Wushuang,” Bai Lipeng lifted his head and smiled faintly, “I’m working for Mister Xia Feng. Mister Xia Feng is kind and generous. He knew that we servants have it tough, so he gave us time to cultivate respectively. However, as they were doing so, no one could take care of Tai Yuan Star. As such, I asked the people in Sword Star for help.”

“Mister Xia Feng did it out of empathy with us servants. We can’t reject him. I think even Mister Jian Wushuang wouldn’t want to see Mister Xia Feng unhappy, right?”

“Xia Feng?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted.

He had heard of Xia Feng. He was also a Universe God in the Second Heaven, and also a disciple of Star Palace!

The only difference was that Xia Feng had proved his identity with his power long ago but Jian Wushuang… There was almost no one who recognized him to qualify his identity as disciples of Star Palace.

“So he gave an order for his own people to cultivate but let the people under my command work for you. That’s interesting.”

Jian Wushuang sneered at him but his gaze turned cold the very next moment.

“Forget about the fact if it was Xia Feng’s order. Even if it was, we are both disciples of Star Palace, without my consent, you forced my people to work here on Tai Yuan Star, does he qualify to do so?”

“Not only did you force my people to work for you, but you also hit my people… Humph!”

There was a sharp glare in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and his figure suddenly charged forward.

Jian Wushuang appeared before Bai Lipeng directly and the latter realized and waited to come to blows.

Rumble!

A scary Soul Attack consolidated into a sharp thorn and pierced through Bai Lipeng’s sea of consciousness.

“Ah!”

Bai Lipeng let out a groan in pain. His eyes turned bloodshot and his consciousness drowned in extreme pain. He lost the ability to fight back.

Pak!

Jian Wushuang’s hand slapped Bai Lipeng’s face and Bai Lipeng flew off. At the same time, he grabbed the green whip from Bai Lipeng’s hand.

“You dare to whip my people. Let me teach you a lesson today!”

A cold voice was heard from Jian Wushuang’s mouth. He gripped the long whip and swung. The long whip became a soul snake and whipped Bai Lipeng’s body continuously.

Pak! Pak! Pak! Pak! Pak!

The loud whipping sound could be heard clearly, accompanied by Bai Lipeng’s roars and bellows.

Bai Lipeng was a Universe God in the Third Heaven. He wanted to counter-attack with his all. However, as Jian Wushuang wielded the long whip, it naturally contained Soul attack. Every whip brought Bai Lipeng into a sluggish situation. He couldn’t dodge, nor he could match.

He could only embrace every whip on him. In just a short while, he was whipped by Jian Wushuang more than a hundred times.

From more than a hundred lashes, Bai Lipeng’s clothes were torn and his skin was worn. Some parts of his bone and flesh were mashed up too. He turned into raw flesh and was extremely pathetic but he was still alive.

“Show mercy, Mister Jian Wushuang. Let me live!”

Bai Lipeng started pleading.

He had no alternative, he had to ask for mercy.

If he didn’t, he reckoned he would’ve died from the whipping that Jian Wushuang gave.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang whipped Bai Lipeng’s face once and finally stopped.

“Listen up. I do not care if it was your personal idea or Xia Feng’s order. Let me keep this short, my people, without my consent, cannot be ordered to do anything!”

Then, Jian Wushuang threw the green whip away. He looked at the maids and servants who were shocked and said, “Let’s go back to Sword Star!”

Qiu Yue and the rest came back to reality. Then, they immediately followed Jian Wushuang and left Bai Lipeng lying there half dead.

…

Sword Star, in the lofty palace.

“What happened during the time I wasn’t here?” Jian Wushuang sat on the throne overlooking at Qiu Yue and the rest of the people.

Qiu Yue knelt down, “Mister, Qiu Yue didn’t manage Sword Star well. If Mister is angry, blame Qiu Yue alone.”

“I do not want to reprimand you. I just want to know what happened.” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “Tell me.”
