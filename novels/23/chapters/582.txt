Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

More than ten behemoths were rushing towards them. These figures, which were covered in dark purple scales, turned out to be Bone Dragons that, when they opened their huge wings, were as large as mountains.

A magnificent and domineering aura radiated from the Bone Dragons, making it hard for the human experts and common Demonic Beasts to breathe.

The Bone Dragon Clan, one of the three overload clans among the monster population, had arrived.

“Bone Dragon Clan!” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was surprised.

The three overlord clans were the Bone Dragon Clan, the Crystal-armored Monster Clan, and the Demonic Ape Clan.

The Bone Dragon Clan ranked first as its overall strength was higher than that of the Crystal-armored Monster Clan. What’s more, Bone Dragon Emperor was an immortal being whose age was known by nobody.

In the entire Ancient World, few people could compete with him and he was much stronger than Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

“Bone Dragon Clan!”

The human experts became more anxious upon seeing the appearance of these Bone Dragons.

They had just managed to send the Crystal-armored Monster Clan away when an even stronger clan, the Bone Dragon Clan, arrived.

Did the Bone Dragon Clan also come for the compass?

As the giant Bone Dragons finally appeared on the battlefield, their magnificent aura oppressed the whole battlefield and quieted it down.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, it’s so rare to see you face defeat,” the leading Bone Dragon, which was the largest, said in a deep voice.

“Hum, don’t be so complacent. You can try to battle with Sword Emperor. I can guarantee you that only the old devil in your Bone Dragon Clan can compete with him. I’m afraid none of your guys are qualified,” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor replied coldly as killing intent surged around him.

All the Bone Dragons in front of him were at Monster King level and possessed extraordinary strength. Nevertheless, since?Bone Dragon Emperor, who was the most powerful, did not show up, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would not give a damn about them.

Hearing his words, the leading Bone Dragon was silent for a moment before his huge eyes turned towards Jian Wushuang. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Are you Sword Emperor?” the Bone Dragon asked in a magnificent voice that contained a trace of respect.

“I am. May I ask why the Bone Dragon Clan has come here? Are you also after the compass?” Jian Wushuang replied calmly.

“The Compass?” the leading Bone Dragon shook his head. “We’re not interested in the compass. We were ordered by one of our lords to take you to see him. Please come with us.”

The Bone Dragon replied politely.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and thought,?“Is the lord he mentioned Bone Dragon Emperor?”

Jian Wushuang did not think too much of it but shook his head. He said, “I don’t know your lord. It’s not necessary for me to meet him. If he insists, he can come to see me. I don’t have the time to go with you.”

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s refusal, the Bone Dragon released an oppressing aura.

A human being suddenly appeared on the huge Bone Dragon’s back and spoke in a teasing tone.

“Third Brother, I haven’t seen you for so many years. I didn’t realize that it was so difficult to invite you now.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked to hear this voice and immediately raised his head to look at the man standing on the Bone Dragon’s back.

He opened his eyes wide in surprise.

“Second, Second Brother?”

His voice revealed a little surprise, but it was mostly filled with doubt.

Jian Wushuang felt it was completely unbelievable.

The man on the Bone Dragon carried a saber on his back and he had a cold face, which had changed a little over the years, becoming even colder. But Jian Wushuang still recognized him at a glance.

Second Brother!

In this world, only one person was qualified to be addressed as Second Brother by Jian Wushuang. That was Yang Zaixuan, one of Jian Wushuang’s three brothers from the Nanyang Continent!

Yes, that man was Yang Zaixuan!

Whether it was his appearance or the cold aura, he was definitely Yang Zaixuan.

“How can it be?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

After he left Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan on the Nanyang Continent, he went to the Divine Land to adventure alone.

After that, he had never heard news about them.

But now...

He had never imagined that he would see Yang Zaixuan again on the Monster Continent, not to mention that Yang Zaixuan was standing on the back of a huge Bone Dragon.

“Second Brother, why are you here?”

Although he was confused, Jian Wushuang still glided toward Yang Zaixuan and moved to step on the back of the Bone Dragon. However, the Bone Dragon, which was a Monster King, snorted angrily, obviously reluctant to allow him to step on his back.

“Behave yourself!”

Yang Zaixuan looked down coldly. As he stamped on the back of the Bone Dragon heavily, a commanding aura that contained endless majesty burst out of him.

It swept out in all directions.

This majestic aura, which was like an emperor reigning over the world, unconsciously made the crowd want to prostrate themselves and worship him.

Around the battlefield, the human experts, as well as the thousands of Demonic Beasts, were all deeply shocked when they felt the aura.

Even Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and Temple Master Black Spirit could not help looking at Yang Zaixuan.

Both of them felt great suppression from the majestic aura.

The Bone Dragon under Yang Zaixuan’s feet trembled under the suppression and dared not to disobey any more.

Jian Wushuang mounted the Bone Dragon and stood next to Yang Zaixuan, looking at him in surprise.

When he was on the Nanyang Continent, he had known that Yang Zaixuan was predestined?to be a warrior. But at that time the latter had just been in the Saint Realm.

After a few years, Yang Zaixuan’s strength had obviously improved greatly.

Even Jian Wushuang was affected by the terrifying aura suppression.

“Second Brother, we haven’t seen each other for so many years, but it seems like you’ve improved a lot,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

“You can defeat a Monster Emperor now. If I hadn’t made any progress, how could I be qualified to be your brother?” Yang Zaixuan said with an indifferent look.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and a smile appeared on his face.

“Let’s not talk about it anymore. My Master asked me to take you to see him. Come with me,” Yang Zaixuan said.

“Your Master? Wine Master?” Jian Wushuang frowned. He remembered that Yang Zaixuan was the disciple of Wine Master when he was on the Nanyang Continent.

“No, another Master. You’ll know when you see him,” Yang Zaixuan said.
