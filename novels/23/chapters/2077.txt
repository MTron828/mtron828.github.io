2078 The Black-armoured General

Xiu!

A merciless spear pierced through.

That speed, words could not express.

By the time Jian Wushuang heard that ear-piercing blast from the Void, the spear was already in front of him.

Jian Wushuang had moved first, logically he should be the one to make the first strike, but before he could even start on his sword skills, the spear had reached him.

“Hngh!”

With a snigger, Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword swiftly took it down.

This was the strongest skill within Sword Principle Xuan Luo – the Blast Rainstorm.

With a gong, the sound of the strike resonated.

Jian Wushuang could feel an immense power travelling across his Blood Mountain Sword..

This power, without a doubt, had surpassed Second Stage Great Emperors’ powers, it was a Third Stage power!

And from the looks of it, this one move was slightly stronger than all of Demon King Chen Yu’s powers had been back in Three Emperors World.

This strength travelled up towards his body. The strong body he had after cultivating the Immortal Celestial Body at this moment was roughed up pretty badly too.

Agh!

Jian Wushuang quickly retreated.

As he regained his balance, the Divine Power within him started doing its work, and soon his injuries were all recovered.

“Stage Three, stronger than Demon King Chen Yu?” Jian Wushuang licked his lips and stared at the black-armoured general.

“Junior, you’re not stronger than me. With me guarding here, you won’t make it through. Leave.” The general opened his mouth again.

“Won’t make it through? We’ll see about that.” Jian Wushuang sniggered, and attempted to strike again.

“Blockhead.” The general’s eyes radiated death as the spear in his hand was once again put into action.

Spear strikes came one after the other. The general’s fighting power, once ignited, was indeed of a Third Level Great Emperor.

Faced with such an expert, Jian Wushuang could not possibly win.

Suppressed at first contact, Jian Wushuang could only now resist with his almost invincible self defense mechanism.

Outside the Ancient Emperor’s Residence stood many Ancient Gods, all astonished by the ongoing battle.

“So powerful! That black-armoured general, he’s too strong!”

“The Sword Emperor himself is already an extraordinary being, having suppressed King Chen Xing. But against the general, it feels like a whole new level.”

“The disparity is quite big, the Sword Emperor has been completely suppressed.”

The Ancient Gods could not help giving praise.

“Hngh, I knew it, this Sword Emperor may be strong after passing those two obstacles, but passing the last challenge, that’s impossible!” Demon King Chen Xing sniggered, a grin on his face

In front of the residence’s huge gates, Jian Wushuang was still being suppressed by the general in an almost pathetic manner, relying purely on his self-defense mechanism to keep up.

“Junior, my patience has its limits. You can’t defeat me. Leave now, or don’t blame me for teaching you a lesson.” The black-armoured general’s voice was cold and harsh.

“Teaching me a lesson? We’ll see about that.” Jian Wushuang smiled back without hesitation.

That instantly infuriated the general.

He stopped holding back.

Hong!

An ear-piercing roar resonated through the entire Void, and even Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but look up.

What he saw was a deep, subtle flash.

It was pitch black, with not a single mark of impurity, glaring as it shone. Not only Jian Wushuang, but even the Ancient Gods outside the Ancient Emperor’s Grave were mesmerised by it. This eye-catching flash was actually the eerie shadow of the general’s spear.

The spear had left the general’s hand with such explosive speed, it was already reaching Jian Wushuang.

Too fast.

A speed beyond Jian Wushuang’s comprehension.

“Gosh, I’m not going to be able to block it?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He had intended to use his swordsmanship to block it, but found himself unable to catch up with the spear. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He could do nothing but watch as the spear approached.

Ultimately, without obstruction, the spear pierced through his body.

Hong~~

A power so strong it could have pierced Heaven and Earth went through him.

Jian Wushuang shook. That power was weakened by half passing through his Five Gem Amour, but whatever remained was still powerful enough to pierce a bowl-sized hole through his body.

Jian Wushuang, still in shock, was taken aback by the blast.

“Is he dead?”

The general, with death in his eyes, gazed upon Jian Wushuang.

But suddenly, Jian Wushuang, still being thrown aback from the blast, stopped abruptly within the void.

Jian Wushuang had his eyes fixated upon the general once again, the hole in his body now long gone.

“What?” The black-armoured general was obviously surprised.

He had just put a hole through Jian Wushuang. Normal Cultivators would have either been dead or greatly wounded by now. But the man before him … he showed no sign of weakness, his injury had already recovered.

His recovery speed, how could it be so fast?

“Impressive!”

“That was quite the spear. If I’m not wrong, there were some Rules of Order within it, right?” Jian Wushuang said with a tinge of excitement.

“You know about that?” The general was surprised, restraining himself. He stood statue-like once again, speaking coldly. “Your self defense mechanisms and restorative powers are impressive, I am unable to kill you. But you are still unable to pass me. So please, leave.”

“Unable? I don’t think so,” Jian Wushuang gave a cold laugh. “Ancient God Emperor, you thought I wouldn’t be able to tell someone was controlling this body I’m fighting with?”

The general’s pupils constricted upon the words “Ancient God Emperor”, a sharp glare could be seen in his eyes.

“The method of planting some consciousness within this Dao soldier, therefore controlling it? I’ve done it before. These kinds of tricks are no mystery to me,” Jian Wushuang sniggered. “The Dao soldier you control is very powerful himself, but a Dao soldier remains a Dao soldier. I can tell with a glance.”

“Controlling a Dao soldier, demonstrating Third Stage Great Emperor powers with Rules of Order with the power of consciousness alone… within these grounds, who else could it be but you, Ancient God Emperor?”
