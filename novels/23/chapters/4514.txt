4518 Void God Emissary

The days passed by in such a calm and peaceful manner.

For the next few years, Jian Wushuang would only communicate with Elder Ban Shan or Elder Mi Feng from time to time.

In addition, Jian Wushuang was immersed in cultivation and revealed his cultivation to the One Scar level.

This naturally caused a great shock in the God Refining Sect. Some people who were originally wavering were now completely certain that Jian Wushuang would be the next candidate for the Sect Master of the God Refining Sect. They leaned toward Jian Wushuang.

The God Refining Sect Master seemed to have the same plan. Occasionally, he would call Jian Wushuang to the Sect Master’s hall to discuss Dao and chat. On one hand, he could take the opportunity to confirm Jian Wushuang’s identity by beating around the bush. On the other hand, he could hint to Jian Wushuang that he was about to leave, and that Jian Wushuang might take over the position of Sect Master.

The Void Universe seemed peaceful, but the Divine Power Uower universe was different.

After a few communications with Cosmos Gods, Jian Wushuang learned that there were more and more probing attacks from the Void Universe to the Divine Power Universe in the Offworld Battlefield. It was highly possible that a great war would break out at any moment.

On this day, outside the God Refining Sect, a strange guest suddenly came.

Within the Sect Master’s hall of the God Refining Sect.

A strong and muscular old man with white hair that reached his waist and a bare upper body, wearing only a pair of black trousers, was slowly turning two silver balls in his hands.

The white-haired, burly old man’s upper body was covered with long, hideous scars. He was playing with the two spinning silver balls in his hands. Every time they collided, a soft thunder-like roar would be heard, and countless electric arcs would burst out.

Just by standing there, he exuded an aura as deep as the abyss and as heavy as five mountains. It was even faintly suppressing the God Refining Sect Master.

“Lord Emissary, are you here because the war is finally about to begin?”

The God Refining Sect Master said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

“That’s right.” The white-haired old man nodded and said in a deep voice, “The seal on Lord Void God’s side is about to be lifted. At most, in 60 years, Lord Void God will be able to completely lift the seal. At that time, we will attack the Divine Power Universe.”

“I’m here to ask you to prepare for the God Refining Sect’s funeral. Then, you can follow me into the Void Forbidden Land and wait for Lord Void God’s orders.”

“Is the battle finally coming…” the God Refining Sect Master mumbled to himself as a glint flashed across his eyes.

After taking a deep breath, the God Refining Sect Master cupped his hands and replied, “Your Excellency, I understand.”

“Yes.” The white-haired old man nodded in satisfaction and said, “Ba Huang, I’ll be staying here for a while or two. You should go and make your funeral arrangements.”

“Alright.” The God Refining Sect Master nodded his head and walked out of the main hall. A look of hesitation flashed across his face.

It seemed that it was time to decide who would be the next Sect Master after he left.

After pondering for a while, the God Refining Sect Master’s eyes flashed with determination and he spoke in a deep voice.

His voice was like rolling thunder, directly exploding above the God Refining Sect and into the ears of every disciple.

“The Heavenly Dao has sensed that I will leave the God Refining Sect soon to search for the true essence of the Great Dao!”

“Therefore, I’ve decided that my disciple Wushuang will temporarily take over the position of Sect Master and monitor the movements of the sect. The five Grand Elders will assist him together. If Wushuang has violated the interests of the sect or has failed to lead the sect well, he will be dismissed together!”

“If this Sect Master doesn’t return for a long time, Wushuang will work hard and live up to this Sect Master’s expectations, but will truly take over the throne and become the Sect Master!”

“Disciple Wushuang is to head to the Sect Master’s main hall to receive his title!”

As soon as he finished speaking, it was as if a stone had caused a thousand waves. The entire place fell into a short dead silence, and then it erupted!

“What? Jian Wushuang is going to be the next Sect Master?”

“He… it’s actually so fast?”

“Lord Sect Master is leaving?”

“In the future, won’t we have to obey Wushuang?”

In an instant, countless disciples were dumbfounded and shocked.

Elder Mi Feng, who was in the middle of condensing the immortal’s body, said ‘good’ three times in a row and laughed happily.

“Wushuang, this old man congratulates you!”

In one of the sleeping chambers, Elder Pan Shan, who was cultivating with his legs crossed, slowly walked out. He looked at the heated atmosphere in the God Refining Sect with a strange expression.

“This kid is going to be the Sect Master?” he muttered and shook his head. It was really rare to sneak into an enemy sect and become the head of the enemy sect.

He was looking forward to seeing how far Wushuang would lead the God Refining Sect after he became the Sect Master.

…

The seventh Corpse Caves of the limestone mountain.

Nu Xiong, Hei Chi, Zhengheng, and the other head disciples had complicated expressions.

In the past, Jian Wushuang was just a newbie that they could easily control. However, in just ten years, Wushuang had not only killed Yan Dan and broken through to the Scar level, but he was also about to become the next Sect Master of the God Refining Sect. He had reached a level that they could not even catch up with.

It really made one sigh.

“I knew this guy wasn’t an underground worm, but a dragon in the sky.”

Nu Xiong, who had fought with Jian Wushuang once, shook his head and sighed.

When he had been defeated by Jian Wushuang in one move, he knew that Jian Wushuang was not an ordinary person. Now, it seemed that his guess was right.

On the slope of the limestone mountain.

The alluring Jiu Sha, who was dressed in red, leaned against the entrance of the corpse cave with a dazed look in her eyes. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The speed of this man’s growth made her feel a little unreal.

The next time they met, it would not be that Junior Brother Wushuang, but the high and mighty Lord Sect Master.

…

All of a sudden, within the God Refining Sect, regardless of whether it was the disciples or the Elders, they all raised their heads and looked up at the sky. Their expressions were filled with wonder.

All in all, when the God Refining Sect Master finished his sentence, the entire God Refining Sect exploded!

On the peak of the limestone mountain.

...

“I’m going to be the Sect Master?” Jian Wushuang touched his nose. Not to mention the others, even he himself was dumbfounded.

He had guessed that the God Refining Sect Master would pass the position to him, but he did not expect it to happen so quickly.

Shaking his head, Jian Wushuang did not think too much about it. After putting away the divine corpse, he took a step forward and shot toward the Sect Master’s hall.

This time, the disciple in charge of guarding the hall was extremely respectful when he saw Jian Wushuang. He first greeted Jian Wushuang with fear and trepidation, afraid that Jian Wushuang would have a bad impression of him. Then, he hurriedly welcomed Jian Wushuang in.

As he walked into the hall, Jian Wushuang saw the God Refining Sect Master sitting on the main seat and the white-haired, burly old man with a bare upper body who was spinning a thunder ball in his hand.

When Jian Wushuang looked at the man, the white-haired, burly old man also turned his eyes to Jian Wushuang with interest.
