Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

With a slight bit of scorching heat, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship erupted.

Jian Wushuang slashed with his sword. Not only did he give full rein to his divine power and ancient God power to his extreme limit, but he had also performed with the slight bit of Power of Reincarnation that he had comprehended.

“Break!”

The cold sword light brought along a shrill piercing whistle and instantly hit the golden palm that was pressing down.

Hualala. An enormous amount of divine power dispersed and the huge golden palm was torn apart by the sword light.

“Mm? Not bad.”

Zhao Han saw the scene and sneered. He then flipped his wrist to reveal that he was wearing a pair of golden gloves.

The golden gloves gave out an outstanding power. They were obviously a very fierce Chaos Unique Treasure.

“Then, let’s give it a try!”

Zhao Han’s face grew ferocious as boundless divine power flowed into his hands in an instant. The golden bear statue that soared up from his body immediately bellowed at the sky above. The golden bear was acting as though it was insane. The two huge bear paws slapped out at lightning speed like a huge golden mountain. Every golden mountain covered an expanse of thousands of miles and traveling towards Jian Wushuang.

Looking at the golden mountains that were pressing in on him, Jian Wushuang couldn’t dodge.

“So strong. Compared to the earlier slam, it is much stronger,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn, “If so…”

Vroom. The billowing scarlet flame suddenly soared up and formed a crimson sea, surrounding Jian Wushuang.

And Jian Wushuang was the King of the crimson sea.

Once the secret skill of Scarlet Kingdom was put to play, Jian Wushuang’s overall performance doubled.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang roared and wielded his sword. A fierce power tore the golden mountains that were pressing towards him. Simultaneously, Jian Wushuang’s figure was moving closer to Zhao Han at a terrifyingly fast speed.

After a short while, Jian Wushuang appeared before Zhao Han.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, bleed to the end of the world!”

Jian Wushuang wielded his sword directly.

Wow!

Shrill crimson swordlight filled the air. In the dark void, it was like writing a bloody and sad yet stirring road to the end of the world,

The road to the end of the world was unusually brilliant.

The swordlight was aiming at Zhao Han’s throat.

“Funny!”

Zhao Han’s gaze fixed and the right hand in a golden glove suddenly became a dragon claw and clawed out at lightning speed.

Behind his back, there was instantly a powerful golden dragon and the golden dragon was clawing out with his claw.

Clash!

The dragon claw that Zhao Han struck out with grabbed Jian Wushuang’s sword directly. The clashing sound of enormous divine power didn’t move him at all.

“Grabbing my sword with a bare hand?”

“You have guts!”

Jian Wushuang smirked and Blood Mountain Sword in his hands immediately let out a shocking sword intention. The entire sword was giving out a shrill sword whistle.

“What?” Zhao Han’s face changed. He could clearly sense the terrifying sword intention from the sword and the shrill aura. He had an illusion that if he didn’t move his palm, he would definitely be chopped into two by the shrill aura.

Swoosh!

Without hesitation, Zhao Han immediately let go of Blood Mountain Sword and his figures

“Demonic dragon!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew cold, then his Soul Power turned into five demonic dragons in an instant. The five demonic dragons carried terrifying murderous intentions and charged forward like lightning.

“Five worms, how dare you act wildly before the real, huge dragon?”

Zhao Han shouted and the golden dragon behind him opened its mouth. A terrifying roar was heard. The sound wave of the angry bellow shattered the five demonic dragons directly.

But the demonic dragon just shattered and a black light shot towards Zhao Han in silence.

“That’s it…” Zhao Han contracted his pupils. He already could see that the black light was a black longspear. The black longspear carried a unique power and it came before his eyes in an instant.

“Humph!”

Zhao Han huffed and clasped his hands together. The huge golden bear was originally behind him but it suddenly appeared before him. The golden bear solidified its body and he blocked the spear, relying on its huge body.

Although the longspear was blocked, it contained a Soul Attack and it hit Zhao Han without hindrance.

“Consciousness attack?” Zhao Han creased his eyebrows and instantly recovered.

“He blocked my attack of Inextinguishable Light that I used with his God Killing Spear so easily?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

In the void, Zhao Han stood and regained stability. There was shock in his eyes as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

On the battlefield, there was a temporary silence.

At the surrounding, Hong Ri Mercenary Group, including those Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven who were there to kill Su Hong were gawking at the scene.

When Jian Wushuang and Zhao Han stopped, they came back to reality.

“So strong!”

“Too strong!”

“This is the fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list?”

“We are all Universe Gods in the Third Heaven but we are of a totally different level compared to the two of them. I feel that Mister Zhao Han could easily kill me with a casual slap, same goes for Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.”

Everyone was shocked.

Everyone was shocked by the terrifying battle.

In the middle of the battlefield, Zhao Han finally spoke again. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It seems that I’ve belittled you. You really do have the fighting power of one on the Universe God ranking list,” Zhao Han smiled faintly. “As you are quite powerful and you’re a disciple of Star Palace, as long as you can take my next move, I’ll let you live.”

“You’re boasting shamelessly,” Jian Wushuang shouted.

“Then, take this.”

There was a loud shrill and there were two rays of brilliant golden light from Zhao Han’s hands. The golden light was constantly magnifying like two golden suns. Then, there was an ancient, strong beast that appeared behind him out of nowhere. The beast had three heads and no one could recognize it.

However, the moment the beast opened its eyes, it sent chills down everyone’s spine.

Then, Zhao Han’s sun-like palm swung.

Rumble. The surrounding void started trembling with madness.

The terrifying power made every surrounding person roar uncontrollably.

Everyone couldn’t help but stare at the two golden suns.

“Real God unique skill!”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave. He knew Zhao Han, an expert on Universe God ranking list who had already comprehended a slight bit of Myriad Beasts Doctrine. He?had already created Real God unique skill.

Then, he tightened his grip and Blood Mountain Sword quivered in madness and let out its extreme power.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, Enduring Samsara!”
