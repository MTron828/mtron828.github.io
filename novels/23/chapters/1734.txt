Chapter 1735: Furious!!!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

At the hidden void in the dark storm.

Swish!

Ghost-like black robed figures appeared silently.

“Hehe, Mo Ying, I didn’t think that you would fail. Moreover, your target is merely a Real God.”

The four black-robed men who were originally at that piece of void looked over and their eyes were filled with relish.

“Hmph, if all of you have the talent, you can try assassinating him. I guarantee that the moment any of you approaches him, you will be discovered by him,” Mo Ying said coldly.

“Haha, the four of us are not assassins and we are not proficient in assassination. What we are proficient in is head-on extermination. Just look. Later on, you will know how Jian Wushuang was killed by the four of us,” one of the black-robed men sneered.

“There’s no rush. It’s still not the time for the four of us to strike. Let’s wait a while longer. The second wave of killing has not begun yet,” another black-robed man said.

“I will be watching.”

The few of them waited at their location quietly.

Within the dark storm, Jian Wushuang was walking forward slowly. After knowing that the Acheron Palace was trying to assassinate him this time around, he became even more vigilant to the point that his nerves became extremely tight.

Swish! Swish!

Occasionally, some dark wind blades would rush toward him but all of them would be dispersed by Jian Wushuang easily.

To the current him, the dark wind blades were not considered a threat. The real threat was the danger that was hidden in the darkness.

“King of Venomous Worms, is the move that you unleashed really effective?” Jian Wushuang was chatting with the King of Venomous Worms in his mind. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t worry. This is the Secret Skill that only my Plenilune Clan possesses. As long as someone approaches you, I will notice it straight away. However, the Secret Skill only covers a range of a thousand meters,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“A thousand meters is not too bad,” Jian Wushuand nodded his head.

The assassination moments ago had caused him to be terrified and at that moment he was still extremely fearful.

If that Almighty from before were to find another opportunity to attack him, Jian Wuhsuang had absolutely no confidence that he could avoid it again. However, the King of Venomous Worms had unleashed a Secret Skill which caused a special energy to cover a thousand-meter range around him.

If such a kind of Almighty were to launch a surprise attack on him again, at the very least, he would have some time to prepare.

At that moment…

“Eh?” All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang raised his head. He had already seen a figure who was sitting on the ground with his legs crossed at the end of his line of vision.

“Lei Chao!”

Jian Wushuang revealed a delighted expression and he walked over to the figure immediately.

“Jian Wushuang?”

Lei Chao, who had been sitting on the ground and did not dare to move about, also saw the arrival of Jian Wushuang and he revealed a delighted expression at once.

In no time, the two of them joined up with each other.

“Jian Wushuang, I did not expect you to really be able to find me,” Lei Chao’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

“I have exerted a great amount of effort to find you,” Jian Wushuang laughed. However, his expression turned grave quickly, “Lei Chao, the matter this time around is not normal.”

“Oh?” Lei Chao was stunned.

Jian Wushuang gave a simple explanation of the ambush that he had encountered in the dark storm, as well as his own judgement.

“Damn it!” Lei Chao clenched both his fists tightly and his expression became unusually ugly, “I have always felt that it was strange. When Old Freak Sui Gu was chasing me, he could have actually killed me. However, he did not do so. Back then, I still thought that he simply did not take advantage of the opportunity. However, looking at it now…”

“Jian Wushuang, I’m sorry. I implicated you,” Lei Chao said apologetically.

“No, the Acheron Palace’s target is me and they are trying to get rid of me. In actual fact, I am the one who got you involved in this,” Jian Wushuang said.

Indeed. If not for Jian Wushuang, the Acheron Palace would not put in so much effort and pay so much price to take action against Lei Chao.

Moreover, Lei Chao would also not go into the Buddhist Demon Sea and get himself in danger.

“Let’s not talk about this now. We have to quickly think of a way to get out of here,” Lei Chao said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and he had a grave expression.

All of a sudden…

“Jian Wushuang, someone has come,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice could be heard abruptly.

Jian Wushuang realized instantly that a ghost-like figure had appeared behind him again. Moreover, it was that same dagger which was emitting a shocking amount of cold light.

The dagger moved with lightning speed and it headed toward Jian Wushuang’s head again.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang gave a cold hum. This time around, he had taken precautions since a long time ago. He attacked straight away by swinging the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands, which were filled with an infinite amount of sword essence.

Clang!

The Blood Mountain Sword and the dagger clashed head-on and a violent sound of blows being exchanged could be heard. The ghost-like figure who had launched a surprise on Jian Wushuang then retreated abruptly.

“Lei Chao, be careful!”

Jian Wushuang did not forget to remind Lei Chao. However, when he looked at Lei Chao again, his expression changed fiercely.

Lei Chao had an extremely hideous face. His eyes, which were looking at Jian Wushuang, were also filled with a shocking amount of murderous intent.

He had already extended his palms and two flittering lights headed toward Jian Wushuang.

“This is…”

As Jian Wushuang looked at the two flittering lights which were shot over, he recognized them. They were two God Destroying Pearls!

Back then, His Highness Mu Hong had almost destroyed the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning by relying on the God Destroying Pearl.

Jian Wushuang was certain about the power of the God Destroying Pearl. One of them was already extremely frightening. With two of them, they definitely had the ability to kill a Sir God.

However, at that moment, the two God Destroying Pearls were thrown over from Lei Chao’s hands and it was very clear it was thrown toward him.

“Ancient God’s Secret Skill, Eight Divine Mountains!”

With a cry from Jian Wushuang, bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! ~~

Loud sounds could be heard repeatedly and a one hundred thousand foot tall golden Divine Mountains appeared out of thin air in front of Jian Wushuang again and again.

A total of eight golden Divine Mountains acted as a shield in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Explode!”

Lei Chao bellowed loudly and the two God Destroying Pearls exploded instantly.

Boom! Boom!

Two deafening booms could be heard abruptly. The frightening power also spread across all directions and destroyed everything.

The black storm, which was originally considered stable, became unusually violent due to the power generated from the attack. A great number of dark wind blades were blown about continuously and this caused the void to collapse crazily.

As for the eight lofty golden Divine Mountains in front of Jian Wushuang, seven of them had already collapsed and even the eighth Divine Mountain was shaky and about to collapse. However, it still blocked the attack from the two God Destroying Pearls forcefully in the end.

Although the power was blocked, Jian Wushuang was not delighted in the slightest. Instead, he looked extremely glum.

“Lei Chao!!!”

“Why?”

“How is this possible!!!”

Jian Wushuang was roaring and he was filled with anger.

Lei Chao was an expert who was well-respected by the people in the Lineage of Star.

He was a proud person and he had contributed greatly to the Lineage of Star. Moreover, when Jian Wushuang had only just arrived in the Ten Sanctuaries back then, it had been Lei Chao who guided him personally.

Furthermore, when Jian Wushuang was clearing the Inverse Cultivation Test, Lei Chao had protected him quietly from the side. Hence, it could be said that Lei Chao had taken great care of Jian Wushuang.

As such, after knowing that Lei Chao was in danger this time around, Jian Wushuang had rushed over to rescue him without any hesitation.

However, the scene that had occurred in front of him was something that he had never expected.
