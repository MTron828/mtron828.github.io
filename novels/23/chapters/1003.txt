Chapter 1004: Jin Yu’s Doom

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?” Jin Yu blurted out.

Jin Yu never would have thought that the auric blade he unleashed would be dispelled. His gaze had diverted to the pile of Chaos Gems still hanging in the air.

He had guessed that Jian Wushuang, at most, would be able to parry the ethereal blade that he conjured, if he was lucky to survive his deadly stroke.

But he could feel it. His auric blade had barely hit Jian Wushuang’s blade when the sheer might of the Sword Essence released by Jian Wushuang had disintegrated the auric blade.

“With his Sword Essence alone, he had undone the magic of my auric blade! Is he so powerful?”?There was a brief flicker of horror that flashed in Jin Yu’s eyes. He immediately waved his hand and summoned another auric blade, crimson red in color, that shot from above to defend him.

“Bang!”

A deafening bang resounded, sending ripples of shockwave sweeping into all directions.

Immediately, Jin Yu felt a tremor passing through him. He heard a strange groan from his body before he was instantly thrown off his feet by the residual forces from the earlier clash erupting from his body as he was thrown backward.

He was thrown so far behind for hundreds of miles until he finally stopped.

“How is this possible?”?Jin Yu looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

He was one of the proud and esteemed Rank Seven Reincarnators of the Samsara Temple! Yet, here he was, being ignominiously thrown back like a rag doll during a fight against a mere wretch of the Eternal Realm!

A mere wretch of the Eternal Realm!

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang looked into the distance, casting his sight as far as he could at Jin Yu, who was hundreds of miles away, with astonishment.?“Most of the Rank Seven Reincarnators of the Temple are Dao Masters who have reigned the pinnacle of Rank Two. I suppose Jin Yu is one of the few who have reached Rank Three.”

“Be that as it may… he is but only a Dao Master who has barely grazed the threshold of Rank Three. Such strength is hardly worth any notice in the face of yours.”?The Gu King remarked.

Jian Wushuang instead looked far into another direction.

Far away in another direction, Jian Wushuang could sense that the black-robed elder had caught up to the Dragon Wing Governor and was engaging him in a fierce battle. The merciless exchange of blows among them was so destructive that even Jian Wushuang could feel the quiver in the air around him.

“The Governor is in great trouble. I have to finish off Jin Yu as soon as possible and assist him.”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and dashed toward Jin Yu instantly.

“How is it possible that an Eternal Realm youngling wields such power?”?Jin Yu was gathering himself when Jian Wushuang had already appeared in his presence.

At the same time… “Crack!”

An earsplitting crack reverberated through the air; a pale purplish lightsaber had appeared before him without him noticing.

“What’s this? Such impossible speed!”?Jin Yu was astonished. He instantly threw himself backward, frantically waving his saber as he tried desperately to fend off any incoming attacks.

Out of fear and panic, he was unable to concentrate his powers into the blows he earlier cast. But being well-prepared this time, he mustered his powers and executed a blow with all his might, hewing into the air with a force so great that a huge ray of light tore through the air from his blade with the semblance of a dazzling river of light.

“Clang!”

There came a loud clang of steels gnashing against each other. Jin Yu was thrown back once more; only this time blood trickled from the edge of his lips, adding to the already pitiful state of his demeanor.

“Am I being soundly trampled?”?Jin Yu gasped to himself, astounded beyond measure.

He did not know that what Jian Wushuang had performed was the Second Sword Formation of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. That, with the abilities of the Blood-killing Plate Armor fully activated, Jian Wushuang could match the strength of a Dao Master at the pinnacle of Rank Three.

As a Dao Master who has barely grazed the verge of Rank Three, Jin Yu would most undoubtedly be beneath Jian Wushuang in strength and power.

“Crack!”

Once again, the pale purplish lightsaber defied both the laws of Time and Space and appeared before Jin Yu.

“Such speeds are impossible!”?Jin Yu panted, his face turning pale with fright.

The greatest strength of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was, after all, in speed.

The Second Sword Formation, otherwise known as the Flash Sword Formation, allowed its user to traverse the distances of thousands of miles in an instant; an ingenuity that was worthy of its name.

Overwhelmed by fits of panic and fright, Jin Yu flailed his sword wildly, trying desperately to fend off the menacing lightsaber.

Again and again, he resisted the blows cast by Jian Wushuang; and each time, he was thrown backward, his internal wounds growing increasingly severe as his strength and power slowly spent, as was his speed.

Death was upon him now.

A fear that he had never known, crept slowly into him, ensnaring what was left of his sanity.

Never would he have believed that a mere warrior of the Eternal Realm would be able to strike such intense fear into him!

“This sword formation… its powers… its swiftness… I cannot keep up… I cannot!” Jin Yu cried manically, looking as if he was on the brink of madness. “Jian Wushuang, stop! stop!”

“Your Chaos Gems… I promise… I will covet of them no longer… and I promise you I ‘ll help you to persuade the Rank Eight Reincarnator I mentioned to track down your father.”

“Please stop!”

“Please, just stop! Stop right now!”

Heeding nothing of his desperate pleas, Jian Wushuang continued unleashing his brutal onslaught with the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

Ridden by steel and pain, Jin Yu’s life inched closer to death. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“NO! NO!”

“Jian Wushuang! I am a Golden-clothed Deacon of the Samsara Temple, a Rank Seven Reincarnator, you can’t kill me!”

“You cannot kill me, Jian Wushuang! You will be visited upon by the consequences of your actions!”

“Wait and see! Just you wait and see!”

“Hahahaha…”

Jin Yu’s terrible and painful howls and shrieks of pain slowly subsided, replaced with delirious cries and roars of his final ounces of defiance.

Regardless of his foes’ plight, Jian Wushuang mercilessly continued with the execution of his blows to rain death upon his adversary, wearing a blank expression of utmost indifference and callousness. Before long, Jin Yu, a once-great Golden-clothed Deacon of the Samsara Temple and a Rank Seven Reincarnator, fell to his doom under the blade of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and whisked Jin Yu’s Interspatial Ring with an unknown current of air into his grasp before he pocketed the ring with a cold and stern look on his face.

“Ridiculous. My earlier courtesy to you was due to my need of your assistance. Your arrogance and haughtiness I have endured, despite your attempt to fleece me, because of your standing as one of the Golden-clothed Deacons of the Temple.”

“Yet you dare to attempt murder only because I have eluded your devious scheme?”

“You must have mistaken me for a useless fool!”

Jian Wushuang reflected quietly, his appearance cold with fury.

Throughout their encounter, Jin Yu had shown him not even an ounce of respect, wearing an insufferable air of smugness and pride since they first met at his castle. He had even made unreasonable demands and had tried to defraud him out of his greed.

These had all been tolerated by Jian Wushuang with an atypical patience.

Yet, now Jin Yu had tried to murder Jian Wushuang after he had left his castle because of the Chaos Gems the latter possessed.

Never would Jian Wushuang tolerate this insolence and contempt any longer!

Jin Yu’s standing and influence in the Temple meant nothing to Jian Wushuang. Being a brash person that he continually was and one who has a blatant disregard for niceties, not even the threat of reprisals from the Temple would dissuade him for executing the impudent wretch of Jin Yu!

With the deed complete, Jian Wushuang lingered no longer. He took into the air, speeding toward the other direction.

There, he knew, another fierce battle was taking place. The Dragon Wing Governor was at a severe disadvantage and his very life hung on a precarious balance.
