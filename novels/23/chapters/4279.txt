The ninth level of the God Refining Tower was filled with origin laws.

The law aura here was far more concentrated than anywhere else on the Ancient Path of Stars. Even the river of enlightenment in the Divine Life Palace could not compare.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged quietly and looked at the two words ‘Heart Observation’. A thoughtful look flashed in his eyes.

“If I’m not wrong, the test of the ninth level should be to comprehend the two words ‘Heart Observation’.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and started to carefully review every level of the God Refining Tower that he had passed.

!!

He remembered that the first level of the God Refining Tower had the energy devouring beasts. When he was killing the energy devouring beasts, he had used the Wuqi Divine Sword to crush and obliterate them.

The second level was the bandaged swordsman. On this level, although Jian Wushuang was still using the most ordinary swordsmanship, the divine power and origin of sword principle that he exerted were far higher than those on the first level.

Then, the Headless Commander on the third floor, the Gale Swordsman on the fourth floor, the Ancient Sword Saint on the fifth floor, Divine General Fei Hong on the sixth floor…the further he went, the more divine skills Jian Wushuang used. When he defeated Divine General Fei Hong, he had used all his divine skills except for the trump cards!

Every time he broke through a level, Jian Wushuang could feel that the aftermath of his divine power and some divine power were absorbed by the void in the God Refining Tower.

On the seventh floor, another ‘Jian Wushuang’ that looked exactly like him appeared.

His ‘simulacrum’ could accurately use every divine power he had used in the first few levels. Jian Wushuang had used all his skills and finally defeated it with the ‘Eternal Night’.

After that, it was the eighth floor.

There was no more opponent on the eighth floor, only a sword stone.

There was a sword mark on the sword stone, but no one knew who had left it. Even with Jian Wushuang’s amazing talent in sword principle, it took him nearly 60 years to comprehend the true meaning.

In the end, Jian Wushuang arrived at the ninth floor. Before he could see anything, he felt his vision go black as he was expelled by a huge force. It was as if heaven and earth could not contain him and he was out of place.

This time, Jian Wushuang had transformed into the most original divine power and entered the ninth level of the God Refining Tower that no one had ever stepped into before.

Perhaps from the start, this God Refining Tower was not a place for trials. Instead, it was a gift from the Ancient Path of Stars. The so-called trials were just different gifts that were decided according to everyone’s different Dao.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered as he lowered his head and muttered, “However, only those who can reach the top of the God Refining Tower have the right to receive this gift.”

“Well then. This means…”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and looked at the two words. He said in a deep voice, “As long as I can comprehend these two words, I’ll be able to devour and absorb all of the origin laws here. Once I do, I’ll be able to break through to the Ultimate Ruler Realm, or even higher!”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and started to think.

Heart Observation.

If his guess was correct, the main point should be the word ‘heart’.

Heart…what was it?

Jian Wushuang slowly closed his eyes.

The heart should be referring to the original heart, the Dao that one had advocated in the depths of one’s heart!

Gradually, Jian Wushuang’s mind became empty, as if he had returned to the ancient world, back to the Tianzong Dynasty, back to the Sword Marquis mansion in Bashui Commandery, Tianyan province.

That was the place where he began his sword Dao.

That was the first time he had held the hilt of his sword tightly when he was young.

That was his original intention when he first started to practice the sword.

Jian Wushuang started to search for the original heart that he had long forgotten and had no idea where it went.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, thousands of years had passed.

Jian Wushuang was still immersed in the search for his ‘original heart’ and was in the deepest level of comprehension. Meanwhile, the outside world had already changed.

On the Ancient Path of Stars, the biggest change was when Qiu Long challenged eight Overlords and won eight of them. He became the new king of the eight cities!

…

The 18th city on the Ancient Path of Stars was also the final city.

A grand ceremony for the coronation of a new king was about to begin.

Qiu Long was sitting on a throne. Except for Lord Blue, the rest of the eight magnates were sitting under him. Some of them were trying to please him, some of them were expressionless, and some of them had mixed expressions.

The Overlord was also among them. However, at this moment, there was no trace of overbearing majesty on his face. He was like a vulture to the extreme, lowering his head and not saying a word.

The last time they fought in the Overlord’s Divine Palace, it ended with his defeat.

Under Qiu Long’s strange power, his indestructible Overlord body was completely suppressed, and he was no match for Qiu Long.

In the end, he had no choice but to tell Jian Wushuang where he was going and let Qiu Long leave after destroying his Overlord Divine Palace.

“Everyone, to be honest, it’s really hard to reject the public’s sentiment for me to hold the coronation ceremony this time. Otherwise, with my humble and low-key personality, I wouldn’t have liked such an extravagant thing.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiu Long tilted his head, his right elbow supporting the throne, and the back of his hand supporting his chin as he said with a smile.

The Overlord, the young clan leader of the Moluo clan, the Nine Stars Saint Son, and the other emotionless big shots twitched their lips when they heard this. They finally witnessed how shameless Qiu Long was.

However, they all remained silent and did not say anything.

They knew that the reason why Qiu Long suddenly gathered them was not to witness him ascend to the throne. He must have a plan.

The young emperors of the Great Sun Divine Kingdom, the young princes of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom, and the Blood God and Scarlet Sun Demon Master of the blood sky hall all chimed in with a smile. the new king’s seat will naturally be occupied by the strong. Lord Qiu Long’s strength is outstanding, so he should be sitting on the throne.

After Qiu Long had defeated the eight Overlords, these people had announced their allegiance to him.

When Qiu Long heard this, he immediately laughed and said, “The four of you are the most sensible.”

After saying that, Qiu Long turned his eyes to the Overlord and the others. He laughed sinisterly and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, have you prepared any gifts for my ascension to the throne?”

The Overlord, the young clan leader of the Moluo clan, and the Nine Stars Saint narrowed their eyes. They knew that Qiu Long was about to reveal his true intentions. They cupped their hands and said, “Lord Qiu Long, we have prepared. Look, I have prepared a Supreme-grade divine medicine that can increase one’s divine power by 30%…”

Before he could finish, Qiu Long raised his head and interrupted him with a cold expression, “Supreme-grade divine medicine? Are you trying to fool this Lord? How can you even take out that kind of trash?”

The Nine Stars Saint’s face turned ugly. He suppressed his anger and asked, “Then may I ask what you want, Lord Qiu Long?”

Qiu Long laughed.

...

His gaze swept across the faces of the Nine Stars Saint Son, the Overlord, and the young clan leader of the Moluo clan. He licked the corner of his mouth cruelly and said with a fake smile, “I want all the God Sealing Tablets you have!”
