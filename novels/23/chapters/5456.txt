Chapter 5455 Palace Master Lu Hua

"This was shifted from the Forest of Eternal Secrets in the Earth Realm!" Wu Zuo pointed to one of the trees and spoke.

Jian Wushuang followed his gaze, and the tree was extraordinary. The aura emanating from it was no longer the Origin Source but a unique breath, more like the essence of plant life.

As he kept staring, the tree shook, and astonishingly, it opened a pair of eyes.

Indeed, it was a plant life.

"Don't be surprised; it's just guarding the house!" Wu Zuo remained calm about it because outside his grand hall, there were also these treasure trees, not fewer than those of the Palace Master.

The three Palace Masters of the Elder Palace, who Jian Wushuang came to meet this time, were under the charge of Emperor Lu Hua, who managed the Yuanyang Lake.

A supreme-peak level expert but far inferior in strength to Wu Zuo, he had earned some merits in ancient times, giving him a certain status among the elders.

Wu Zuo sneered inwardly, having achieved great success in the Earth Realm this time.

Not only did he enable the Inheritors to obtain the legacy of the three kings, but he also recruited Broly, a Transformation Dao Emperor.

This time, he would definitely enter the ranks of the Palace Masters.

The Elder Palace was originally managed by multiple Palace Masters, and adding one more was nothing significant.

Besides, he had accumulated some manpower under him, stabilizing his position among the elders.

"Later, you will meet Palace Master Lu Hua of the Elder Palace. Don't be nervous. Palace Master Lu Hua is very kind!" Wu Zuo said indifferently.

Jian Wushuang nodded. He wasn't nervous, just curious about the strength of this extravagant Palace Master.

Upon entering the grand hall and looking up, they saw a noble man sitting on the throne.

Both of them spoke together, "Palace Master!"

"Junior Jian Wushuang pays respects to Palace Master Lu Hua!"

Emperor Lu Hua sat on the throne. He smiled, his voice gentle, "No need to be constrained. I've heard about your matters. You can stay in the Elder Palace for as long as you want. Later, I'll have someone give you a token, and you can freely enter any practice treasure land around Yuanyang Lake."

"Thank you, Palace Master!" Jian Wushuang was somewhat excited.

Having wealth was indeed extraordinary.

Being so generous, he could freely cultivate in any treasure land.

Later, Emperor Lu Hua showed concern about Jian Wushuang's cultivation progress. After a conversation that lasted about a quarter of an hour, he took his leave gracefully.

As Wu Zuo, who had remained silent on the side, seemed to have important matters to discuss with Emperor Lu Hua, and being an outsider, Jian Wushuang found it inappropriate to linger.

Thus, he quickly found an excuse and left.

Upon exiting the grand hall, he was greeted by a tier 3 Emperor waiting for him outside. Tier 3 Emperors were considered the bottom tier in the Elder Palace hierarchy.

Initially, the Emperors from the Original Universe, whether tier 1 or 2, had all been elevated to tier 3 over the years,

responsible for overseeing the operations around Yuanyang Lake.

The present tier 3 Emperor was one of them.

"Lord Wushuang, this is a token bestowed by the Palace Master!"

Jian Wushuang accepted the token, bearing the imposing character 'Yuan' on its surface, written in ancient script. The token itself was a valuable item, clearly displaying the wealth and power of the Elder Palace.

On the back of the token was engraved the title 'Jia Nine', representing the authority of this token.

Jian Wushuang was familiar with the hierarchical system of the Elder Palace.Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

Jia Nine!

This title was not low at all.

In the beginning, there were only a dozen or so Jia-ranked elders in the Elder Palace.

Although almost all of them had been promoted to Jia rank in recent years, giving such a token with a Jia rank to an outsider like him was already generous, and even some tier 5 Emperors might not receive such treatment.

After expressing his gratitude, Jian Wushuang prepared to leave, soaring into the air.

"Jian Wushuang, long time no see!" A familiar voice sounded from behind, causing Jian Wushuang to halt in his tracks.

Turning around, he saw a figure approaching, and a smile played on Jian Wushuang's lips as he replied casually, "I was wondering who it was. So, it's you!"

The person behind quickly arrived in front of Jian

Wushuang, and a formidable Emperor's aura surged, directly suppressing Jian Wushuang's Dao Lord aura.

Dominating others using sheer momentum!

Boom!

Jian Wushuang didn't hold back either, erupting with force and sending the approaching figure flying several yards away.

"How is this possible?" The newcomer was astonished, surprised that Jian Wushuang, a Dao Lord, could possess such a powerful aura.

Jian Wushuang frowned, looking at the other person and said coldly, "What's impossible? You, Si Tian, can become an Emperor. Can't I suppress an Emperor?"

The person in question was none other than Dao Lord Si Tian, now addressed as Emperor Si Tian-a top-level tier 4 Emperor.

It seemed that Si Tian had done quite well in these years.

Back when Wan Xing was so formidable, he reached the peak-level tier 4 only after becoming an Emperor.

Now, Si Tian was catching up with Wan Xing.

In the Grave God Mountain, he could probably rank among the top thousand.

In recent years on the Grave God Mountain, only a few had broken through to become Emperors.

Not everyone immediately reached the peak-level tier 4 upon breakthrough; most stabilized their realms as tier 3 Emperors before advancing to tier 4.

In just a short 100,000 years, Si Tian had risen from a Dao Lord to the current state-a considerable practitioner with great fate energy, especially compared to Wan Xing, who had innate talent and potential.

"Hmph, still as arrogant as before. Too bad you're just a Dao Lord!" Si Tian sneered.

"Oh, really?"

Jian Wushuang regretted not killing this person back in Qiuhuang City. He blamed himself for not realizing his importance back then.

If he had taken down Si Tian, perhaps Zhen Ling wouldn't have given him such a hard time now.

Allowing Si Tian to grow unchecked, he had now become a top-level tier 4 Emperor. Not the kind of half-hearted tier 4 Emperor-Si Tian could probably rival tier 5 Emperors in the Four Great Secret Realms.

However, such strength was insufficient to be arrogant in front of Jian Wushuang!

Buzz!

As the aura overwhelmed the opponent, a hint of killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang's eyes.

Just as the two were in a stalemate, a tier 6 Emperor arrived from a distance.

"Outrageous! This is Yuanyang Lake, no fighting allowed!"

The old man had a stern face, and upon realizing that Jian Wushuang was just a Dao Lord, he sternly rebuked him with an air of superiority.¬†

Ignoring it, Si Tlan even revealed a faint smile.

Because the old man in front of him was his master!

100,000 years ago, after descending from the Grave God Mountain to the Heavenly Realm, he became a disciple of a tier 6 Emperor in the Elder Palace.

Although he was an Inheritor, he could still take a master. Consider it finding a backer for himself.

This tier 6 Emperor was the Hall Master of the Longevity Hall in the Elder Palace, with a high status. Though not as powerful as the Law Enforcement Hall, he was still a Hall Master.

Ordinary Inheritors wouldn't dare to be presumptuous in front of him.

But Jian Wushuang was different, both in status and personality.

"Senior, without asking for the facts, you come here to reprimand me. Isn't this unfair?" Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows slightly.

The old man, pointing at his nose and rebuking him as soon as he arrived, made Jian Wushuang feel unjust.

Meanwhile, he did not even look at Si Tian, who had provoked him first.

The Hall Master of the Longevity Hall didn't expect Jian Wushuang to dare to retort. He became furious, "Arrogant! This is Yuanyang Lake. You violate the rules and dare to speak impolitely. Where are the people from the Law Enforcement Hall? Take this person to the purgatory of the Demon Sound Mountain and suppress him for 100,000 years!"
