Chapter 3226: Di Hao and Light King

——

“Di Hao?” Jian Wushuang looked at Di Hao with a frown.

“They can just leave. As for me…” Di Hao’s face darkened. “It’s rare for me to meet Light King, the first on the True Saint List. How can I leave so easily?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Light King also looked at Di Hao. “Di Hao, do you mean you want to challenge me?”

“Yes.” Di Hao nodded. “Everyone in the Divine Beginning Realm thinks you’re the number one Immortal Saint. I’d like to know how big the gap is between you and us.”

“Okay, I’ll help you.” Light King smiled calmly.

Hearing their conversation, everyone present was stunned.

“Di Hao wants to challenge the Light King?”

“Challenge the number one on the True Saint Rank? He wants to challenge the strongest Immortal Saint?”

“This Di Hao is only ranked eighth on the True Saint Rank. Where did he get the courage to challenge the Light King?”

Many experts in this sealed space started to discuss.

Most people felt that Di Hao was too bold. Not to mention that he was only ranked eighth on the True Saint Ranking, even the top five or even the top three ranked Nine Temples Saintess would not dare to challenge the Light King, but Di Hao did it.

“This Di Hao…” Thunder God and Wan Xuan looked at each other, their pupils constricting.

Since no one thought highly of Di Hao, the two of them did not think that he was arrogant.

After all, the two of them had fought with Di Hao before. Moreover, both of them were defeated by Di Hao. In their eyes, although Di Hao was only ranked eighth on the True Saint Ranking, in terms of strength…he was definitely much stronger than Silver Wolf, who was ranked fifth on the True Saint Ranking. In fact, he might even be ranked in the top three.

Such a terrifying expert was qualified to challenge the Light King directly.

Originally, the people of the three Saint Realms had come to kill Jian Wushuang. But now, because of Di Hao’s challenge, everyone’s attention was focused on Di Hao and the Light King, so no one paid attention to Jian Wushuang for the time being.

Anyway, this space-time had been completely sealed, so the people of the three Saint Realms were not worried that Jian Wushuang would escape or something would happen. In their opinion, no matter what happened, it would not change the outcome of Jian Wushuang’s death.

In the void, Di Hao and Light King were facing each other from a distance.

“Di Hao, use all your skills, or you won’t have a chance,” Light King said in a low voice.

“As you wish.” Di Hao’s eyes turned cold, but he suddenly took a step forward.

Boom!

The void under Di Hao’s feet exploded as if it was going to collapse completely. He had already rushed to the front of Light King and swung his giant ax, it carried a world-shaking destructive aura as if it wanted to split the world in half.

Seeing Di Hao make his move, the Light King did not have any intention of moving at first. It was not until Di Hao’s ax swung down and appeared in front of the Light King, he pulled out the green long staff behind him, then, he simply stabbed forward.

This stab was simple and casual, but it contained a strange force. When the long staff stabbed out, a blinding light appeared out of nowhere.

The long staff came into direct contact with the huge ax. Just as the two forces started to collide, the Light King suddenly twisted his wrist. The green long staff was like a poisonous snake as it directly rushed toward Di Hao’s head. Under the endless light, Di Hao could not even open his eyes, and could only barely block the huge ax in front of him.

Bang!

A low sound of collision rang out, and a terrifying power passed through the huge ax to Di Hao’s divine body, causing his divine body to tremble slightly, and his body could not help but retreat.

“Haha!”

The Light King let out a hearty laugh, and the green long rod in his hand was like a green thunderbolt, casually smashing out.

This kind of smashing was like an adult hitting a child. There was no technical content, it was just an incomparably tyrannical crushing.

Di Hao’s forte was the principles of destruction and the principles of space-time. The power of the principles of destruction was incomparably tyrannical. He also used a huge ax. Logically speaking, in terms of power, he should be the best, however, facing this incomparably tyrannical rod technique of the Light King, he actually appeared to be in an incomparably miserable state.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

After exchanging blows, Di Hao was clearly at an absolute disadvantage.

However, at this moment, weng!

A heaven-shaking destructive aura suddenly surged out from Di Hao’s body. This destructive aura formed streams of destructive Qi currents that gathered around Di Hao’s body. In the blink of an eye, they actually formed a gigantic destruction beast…this beast of destruction was incomparably savage. It was purely born for destruction.

And the moment this beast of destruction made a move, the divine power aura on Di Hao’s body suddenly soared by a large chunk.

“Break for me!”

Di Hao exploded.

The huge ax in his hand suddenly swung out, and in an instant, that destructive aura soared to the extreme.

Everyone around the battlefield felt an unparalleled and unstoppable destructive power.

This power seemed to be able to destroy everything.

Facing this ax, even the Light King’s eyes flashed with a trace of surprise. But then, he held the staff with both hands.

Pa!

A clear sound of air being torn apart rang out. The staff that contained boundless light power smashed onto the huge ax like lightning. With a bang, the void trembled. In the next moment, under everyone’s shocked gazes…the Light King’s figure actually retreated explosively. It was only after a long while that his figure came to a halt once again.

“Haha, Di Hao, looks like everyone has underestimated you. Your strength is definitely not only ranked eighth on the True Saint Rankings. You can at least rank fifth, or even fourth. I reckon that you are only slightly inferior to the Nine Temples Saintess.” The Light King laughed heartily, his eyes also flickered with a dense radiance.

Di Hao’s expression was still cold.

Although his ax had indeed repelled the Light King, at the same time, he also knew that the reason why he was able to repent the Light King was because the latter had not used his full strength.

“Di Hao, I will use the fusion power of the two great principles next. You have to be careful. If you are accidentally killed by me, don’t blame me.” The Light King said again.

When these words were said, everyone present felt a shock in their hearts.

The Light King had fused the two great principles at the level of the Immortal Saint.

However, when the Light King and Di Hao fought earlier, he had only used the principles of light. However, he had never used the principles of wind, much less the fusion power of the two great principles. Until now, the Light King was finally going to use his full strength.

“Di Hao, take this move of mine…earth-shattering staff!”

The Light King continued to laugh loudly as he held the green long staff in one hand. His might suddenly soared, and he immediately smashed it forward without any fancy moves.
