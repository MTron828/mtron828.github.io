Chapter 625: Unfair?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

A little later, the host appeared at the Drill Ground on the other side, where the warriors from the Ancient World were gathered.

Just as before, he started reading the names on the list.

“Feng.”

The first name he read out was Feng.

No one felt surprised by that because Feng had demonstrated his incredible power in the first round and was regarded as the number one expert among them.

“Huo Ying.”

“Long Ying!

“Bing Shan!”

Those names echoed loudly throughout the area.

Jian Wushuang was the 13th one to be called.

He slightly smiled among the crowd, but he was not surprised.

Even though he had not used his World Body even once during the last five days, only relying on his Slaughter Body, he could easily rank within the top 20 among all the competitors. Therefore, he was confident in his results.

“He Xuan.”

“Dongfang Lingyue.

“Xue Feng.”

The red-robed woman, Xue Feng, let out a sigh of relief after hearing her name.

She had been worried about the result because Feng had defeated her in the first half of the first round. However, it turned out that anyone who demonstrated their talent and power would get into round two.

“I can’t believe Sword Emperor made it to the end of the first round.”

She could not help glancing at Jian Wushuang with an odd look.

Back when she was locked in battle with him, Feng approached them and defeated her, throwing her out the battlefield with one strike. She had thought that Jian Wushuang would suffer the same result as her, but she was wrong. Jian Wushuang had not been sent out of the battlefield, no matter how long she stood there waiting.

“Could it be that Jian Wushuang was hiding his power when he fought against me?”Xue Feng thought to herself.

Up in the air, the host suddenly paused after announcing one-hundred names.

“What’s the matter?”

Why did he stop reading?

“What’s going on?”

The warriors all looked confused.

Then, they heard an icy voice say, “The above 100 people can participate in the second round. Everyone else has been eliminated.”

Those words dumbfounded the warriors.

“What?”

“Is that it?”

“Only those 100 people made it to the second round?”

“No! It’s not fair!”

Someone roared.

“How could it just be a hundred people?”

In fact, those who had made it to the next round looked surprised as well.

They could not believe that among the one hundred thousand participants, only such a small number of them managed to pass the first round, while the other side of the battlefield had 900 people out of ten thousand from the Eternal World that could enter the second round.

There was a huge difference between the two numbers.

“It’s not fair. Why are there only 100 of us allowed in the second round while 900 passed? The number of our participants was ten times larger than theirs!”

“They showed more favor to those from the Eternal Worlds!”

“I don’t believe I’m weaker than the talents from the Eternal World. Why are they allowed in the second round but I’m not? Just because I’m from the Ancient World? I can’t accept this.”

Roars kept resounding from the Drill Ground.

There were many who had confidence in their power, but they were not on the list, so they were unconvinced.

“Humph!”

The host snorted and looked down at the warriors and used his aura to suppress the whole area.

The aura was a hundred times more powerful than the one Jian Wushuang had felt from Xue Yang. Everyone became quiet while facing this pressure. Some of the rebellious ones were even forced down on their knees by the pressure.

“I told you that everyone is equal in Firmament Territory Feast. Only your talent and power can determine your fate. Those who failed in the first round failed because you lack power.” The voice of the host was heard again.

“As for whether it’s fair or not, the weak have no right to judge that,” the host continued firmly.

He waved his hand and added, “As I said previously, the people on the list can stay. As for the others, your time in Firmament Territory Feast is over. You can choose to leave here on your own in a half hour or be killed.”

Those words caused the place to be shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere.

The warriors who failed in the first round had to leave hopelessly, no matter how unwilling they were.

They dared not challenge the host nor the sects behind him.

“Sword Emperor, congratulations!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Jian Wushuang, among us three, only you made it to the second round. Remember to win some fame for our Ancient World.”

Wu Xin and Ming Liu looked at Jian Wushuang with envy.

The two had tried their best to fight, but they were too weak and failed to earn themselves a place on the list.

“You two, please take care of yourselves.” Jian Wushuang shook his head while watching their backs. He could do nothing about their results.

He knew very well that, due to their weak power, no sect would offer them an olive branch, so leaving here was the best choice for them, as it would be too dangerous to adventure in the Eternal World.

Lots of warriors left while grumbling about it.

Jian Wushuang shook his head at them in secret.

“Is this really not fair?”

“Is it?”

He could not help looking toward the Drill Ground where the geniuses from Eternal World were.
