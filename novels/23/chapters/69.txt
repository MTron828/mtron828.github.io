Chapter 70: Do Not Reject Anyone

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He was victorious in all three battles, and all of them were narrow victories?”

“What a lucky guy?”

“This Swordsman… Is he hiding his strength?”

“Impossible. After all, he is just a newcomer.”

Those disciples of Dragon Palace knew that Jian Wushuang was only a newcomer who had passed the fourth level of Dragon Gate, therefore his strength should be very limited. However they were very suspicious of him after he won these three consecutive battles, beating his opponents.

A burly man came out among the crowd looking extremely domineering, wielding a thick broadsword.

“Lin Feng!”

“Lin Feng came out!”

Disciples of Dragon Palace all looked at this burly man.

“Lin Feng, you have gone through the fifth level. Aren’t you ashamed of challenging a newcomer?” Wang Yuan fumed with a dark face.

Although Jian Wushuang had defeated three challengers who were at the Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate, this burly man, Lin Feng, had passed the fifth level already. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“You are a swordsman. You should also have the strength to break through the fifth level. Why can’t I challenge him?” Lin Feng replied indifferently and his eyes looked to Jian Wushuang.

“Of course you can.”Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, “To duel, it is still a thousand points.”

“OK.” Lin Feng nodded, “Be careful.”

Whoosh!

Lin Feng crossed ten meters instantly and appeared before Jian Wushuang. He swung his thick broadsword ferociously, a Waterdrop Essence erupted. All of a sudden Jian Wushuang felt like he had been plunged into a boundless sea, with crashing waves. He was a lonely boat in the sea, at risk of capsizing anytime.

“Waterdrop Essence?” Jian Wushuang frowned, immediately berated in a low voice, “I’ll break it down.”

A strong sword light pierced out at an alarming rate, tearing down everything with its speed.

Om ~ ~ the thick broadsword brought stacked waves, covering everything.

The sword light pierced several ripples by Jian Wushuang. The power was weakened to the extreme, but the thick broadsword continued to deliver its full force.

“Retreat!”

Jian Wushuang retreated without any delay, exerting the Sword Essence of Earth at the same time.

The best skill of Sword Essence of Earth, thick and strong, was defense.

Hua hua hua hua~~~

Lin Feng’s broadsword domain erupted completely. A series of shadows split endlessly, and it did not stop. Jian Wushuang felt lost as if he had plunged into a huge whirlpool. No matter how he struggled to resist, he could not get rid of it. He only relied on Sword Essence of Earth to resist.

“Waterdrop Essence, this is Waterdrop Essence?” Jian Wushuang with a trace of horror.

This was the first time he had fought with such a strong concentrated drip realm. He had a new appreciation towards this Waterdrop Essence.

Water, The greatest power of water, despite it being seemingly weak and feeble, but it had the power to wear through boulders.

“After all, it is a lack of Sword Tactics of Sword Essence of Earth. Otherwise, I can fight with Lin Feng.” Jian Wushuang sighed. His heart was yearning for Formless Sword Wave.

“The swordsman is suppressed, he is finally suppressed!”

“He will be defeated!”

“It is normal. Lin Feng, after all, has passed the fifth level.”

The Disciples of Dragon Palace around he saw the scene on the battlefield, and all of them sighed.

But at this moment…

A sword shadow pierced out in a straight line, at incredible speed. It was the third type of Formless Swordsmanship——Expeditious Maneuver.

Logically, the third type of Formless Swordsmanship was not a threat to Lin Feng, but once this sword shadow appeared, boom!

It was an extremely forceful sword, it’s power unexpectedly soaring at this moment! Almost directly defeating Lin Feng’s offensive. The sharp sword shadow was more than a stroke crossing his shoulder.

“What?”

Still in shock, Lin Feng’s clothes at his shoulder had been cut away.

Jian Wushuang had still won this fight.

“What’s the matter?”

“Lost? How did he lose?”

“This…”

Everyone around was confused. Lin Feng was so superior, completely suppressing Jian Wushuang. And he should have won immediately, but yet he had suddenly lost.

Only Lin Feng, himself, barely knew the reasons for his loss.

“Strength, it’s strength. His power surged suddenly on that sword so that the power of his swordsmanship also rose sharply, tearing through everything directly.” Lin Feng thought inwardly.

But he was curious that Jian Wushuang was at Spiritual Sea Realm, like him. Why was his power so much stronger than his?

He did not know that compared to ordinary martial warrior, the biggest advantage of Jian Wushuang was not his sword essence, nor swordsmanship, but cultivation method!

He practiced the Heavenly Creation Skill. He was an Inverse Cultivator who defied the natural order!

Lin Feng’s power was at the peak of ordinary Spiritual Sea Realm, and Jian Wushuang, at the peak of his spiritual outbreak, could compare to Gold Core!

The spiritual power of Gold Core was far from Spiritual Sea Realm.

In the Dragon Palace, although there were numerous disciples, most of them were just as the Spiritual Sea Realm. Only a handful of people could breakthrough to reach Gold Core. All men defeated by Jian Wushuang were just at the Spiritual Sea Realm, and he deliberately controlled his power to fight with them.

However, Jian Wushuang had only broken out thirty percent power while facing Lin Feng!

Although it had only been 30%, it was also stronger than the normal Spiritual Sea Realm peak. So he defeated Lin Feng with one sword strike.

Lin Feng defeated. Jian Wushuang got one thousand points again.

“Who else wants to fight with me?” Jian Wushuang looked around, but those disciples of the Dragon Palace were now hesitant.

Before, everyone treated Jian Wushuang as a soft persimmon, and wanted to pinch and get points from him, but after these four showdowns, especially the fight with Lin Feng, they still did not know why Lin Feng failed in the end.

They also realized that Jian Wushuang had hidden his real strength before, so now no one was willing to duel him.

Watching this scene, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, but immediately laughed, “among disciples of the Dragon Palace, there are innumerable geniuses, so many people. Why is it so difficult to find someone to duel with me? Or are you reluctant to fight with me as I am just a newcomer?”

“Well, among you, as long as you went through the fifth level, you can challenge me. I will not reject anyone. As for the bets, all will be one thousand points.”

“Do not reject anyone?” Disciples of Dragon Palace around he turned to a dark face.

“This swordsman, what a crazy guy!”

“He even dares to say that he would not reject anyone, clearly looking down on the disciples who broke through the fifth level.”

“I’ll fight with you!”

Most of disciples of the Dragon Palace were infuriated by Jian Wushuang. A disciple who had broken through the fifth level came to fight with Jian Wushuang immediately.
