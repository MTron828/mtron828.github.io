Chapter 209: A Battle Rose Again

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Glancing at these 12 purple-masked killers surrounding him, Jian Wushuang’s face was cold.

The breaths of the twelve purple-masked killers were extremely violent. Among them, eight had reached the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, and the other four had reached the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

“Eight in the Exceptional Yin Void Realm and four at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm. Hmm, Blood Feather Tower really thinks highly of me.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly.

“Jian Wushuang, I didn’t expect that your strength would improve again in such a short period.” The purple-masked killer, who had been beaten back and struck a tree, currently walked again towards Jian Wushuang and stared at him with cold eyes.

“You’re... Ghost Tiger?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

He once met Ghost Tiger in the Nine Emperors Sect and knew that it was him who destroyed his father’s Dantian.

He said at that time that he must kill him if he saw him again. Now it was that time.

“How dare Blood Feather Tower send killers to Sky Valley to kill me?” Jian Wushuang was a little bit astonished and looked up to the vast upper void.

Not surprisingly, many experts from the 12 dynasties must have gathered in the upper void and kept watch over Sky Valley. Therefore, they should stop the intruding killers of Blood Feather Tower.

However, they easily approached him and had already gone through a round of slaughter, yet the 12 dynasties didn’t react at all.

It made Jian Wushuang feel astonished.

“Are you wondering why no one has come to help you?”

Ghost Tiger sensed what Jian Wushuang was thinking and smiled coldly. “Stop thinking, we were fully prepared in order to kill you during the Easternmost Hunting. This time, you must die and no one can help you.”

“Kill me? You?” Jian Wushuang looked indifferent.

“Haha, isn’t it enough?” Ghost Tiger laughed, then he winked at the purple-masked killer beside him.

“Action!”

Ghost Tiger took the lead and the reopening 11 purple-masked killers also burst forward and rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was stony-faced. Having glanced at Yang Zaixuan and the other four people, he took out his Triple-kill Sword and said, “Take care of yourselves.”

Having said that, Jian Wushuang directly met the killers head-on.

“Third Brother!”

Yang Zaixuan, Su Rou, and Baili Chen looked at Jian Wushuang with concern, but they were helpless to do anything.

After all, they had just gone through a fierce fight and had been seriously wounded. They had little battle strength now and thus they were of little help to him.

“Go to hell!”

Ghost Tiger and the purple-masked killer at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm besides him took the lead, rushing toward Jian Wushuang. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Two dazzling black lights burst out simultaneously: one rushed directly to Jian Wushuang’s throat and another one went to his heart.

“Get out of my way!”

Jian Wushuang thundered and his Triple-kill Sword burst out suddenly. With four sword essences combined together, he precisely played Idealistic Form of the Selfless Sword Technique.

A cold flowing light swept over overwhelmingly and, in the turn of a hand, the flowing light crashed with those two black lights.

Once its terrible power exploded, those two black lights dimmed. Even Ghost Tiger and the purple-masked killer of Yin Void Champion were fought off instantly.

One movement simultaneously forced back two at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm!

The attack of the left 10 purple-masked killers fell at the same time.

Jian Wushuang’s face changed a little, but the next moment, his figure turned into a phantom and he brandished the Triple-kill Sword as quickly as ghosts!

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

10 running crashes sounded. Jian Wushuang’s body shook heavily, and the ground under his feet cracked. He took several steps back with each step falling on the ground heavily and loudly.

Coming to a stop, Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the purple-masked killers with a grin. “You’re too slow!”

The purple-masked killers narrowed their eyes.

“This guy is strong in offense and he forced back two at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm with one movement. Unexpectedly, he’s also strong in defense as he managed to reflect back that attack of ours.”

“Hmm, he might be able to resist one attack, but maybe not the second one.”

“Come on. Kill him!”

The purple-masked killers unhesitantly took action again.

However, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and brandished his Triple-kill Sword freely.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The running crashes rose again.

The 12 purple-masked killers had tried their best and each one played their trump card. However, what about Jian Wushuang...

His overall strength had improved a lot after he combined four sword essences and his Cultivation of Spiritual Power had reached the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Now, his battle strength was much higher than a normal expert at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

More importantly, he had comprehended four sword essences, which were the Earth, Raging Fire, Waterdrop, and Gale.

It made Jian Wushuang be skillful in every aspect.

No matter in attacking, or defending, or a battle of attrition.

He was good at all these.

It could be said that he had no weakness.

The 12 purple-masked killers circled him, but he moved freely among them like a fish. With his skillful swordsmanship, he defended against all of their attacks easily.

Even he didn’t show any panic.

Seeing what happened under the void, the experts of the 12 dynasties and the old sects were shocked and their expressions were humorous.

“Eight in the Exceptional Yin Void Realm and four at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, such a powerful team jointly attacked him, but could do nothing?”

“It, it…”

“How could he be this strong?”

“The guy is really in the Primordial Gold Core Realm? How could one in the Primordial Gold Core Realm be so strong?”

All of them were perplexed.

The gap between the Primordial Gold Core Realm and Yin-Yang Void Realm was huge.

Some super geniuses might kill normal warriors in the Initial Yin Void Realm or Profound Yin Void Realm easily, which could be considered normal.

It’s nothing to rank-skip and challenge someone if one was a super genius with a high comprehension of sword essence.

But to skip this much was incredibly unusual.

If a genius of the Initial Yin Void Realm killed one in the Initial or Profound Yin Void Realm, they could understand it.

If he could kill one in the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, then that would be amazing!

Such a genius was rare in Nanyang Continent, let alone in the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties.

But now, Jian Wushuang, one in the Primordial Gold Core Realm, could fight against eight in the Exceptional Yin Void Realm and four at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm simultaneously and had even kept fighting until now.

What did that mean?

“It’s impossible,” an expert from one old sect couldn’t help but say.

At the same time, when the experts were talking about it, Grayrobe’s face fell.

“What are you doing, you idiots?” Grayrobe cursed and snorted.

His snorting sound resounded throughout the whole Sky Valley.
