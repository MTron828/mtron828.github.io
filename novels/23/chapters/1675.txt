Chapter 1676: Soul Attack Divine Weapon

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Stage Two Ultimate Real God was equal to an Eternal Real God of an ordinary cultivator. However, the distance was vast.

A Stage One Ultimate Real God himself, Jian Wushuang’s divine power and divine body was at the level of Chaotic Real God. Then, he reached stage two and his divine power and divine body instantly jumped to Almighty level!!

It was Almighty, an existence on the top of the pyramid in Eternal Chaotic World.

“This is the power that an Almighty possesses?”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and felt the strength in his hand. He wasn’t sure how much stronger it was compared to his strength before.

“Strong, unbelievably strong.”

“No wonder the Almighties could be high above. Merely the divine power and divine body itself is far beyond a Chaotic Real God.”

Jian Wushuang sighed.

Of course, he was only at stage two. Hence, his divine power and divine body was only the first level among the Almighties!

The Almighties were also segregated into three different levels. The three levels had their own names. The first level was called Sir God!

The second level was called Emperor God!

The third level, also the highest level in Eternal Chaotic World, was Great Emperor!

Among the three levels of Almighties, Sir God was naturally the most common, followed by Emperor God, and Great Emperor was the rarest.

Like the owner of Sky Sword Mountain, Gu Tong King and Gu Yi King, the two seven-star Ancient Gods were Sir God level.

The Star Palace Master, Luo Zhen King and Gu You King, the two eight-star Ancient Gods were Emperor God level.

As for Great Emperor, Jian Wushuang had yet to see one but he knew of Purple Moon Emperor, the master of Purple Moon Sanctuary.

Of course, Purple Moon Sanctuary had a super existence of a Great Emperor. Jian Wushuang believed that the other Sanctuaries should have super existences of Great Emperor level as well.

However, including the entire Sanctuary Alliance, experts who were of Great Emperor level were definitely extremely few.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power and divine body then was at the level of an ordinary Sir God.

“Divine power and divine body are considerable. Compared to an ordinary Sir God, my disadvantage should be in comprehension of Power of Heaven Way. If my comprehension of Power of Heaven Way reaches the standard of the seventh level in Doctrine Palace, I could totally fight against an ordinary Almighty,” Jian Wushuang muttered and he was filled with excitement.

Just then, vroom. A shadow suddenly appeared next to Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Long Qi,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely.

“You broke through?” Long Qi stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“From Pure Yang initial success stage to great achievement stage, although it is just a small breakthrough, your divine power and divine body went through such a drastic change. You cultivation methods are quite unusual. Even I have never seen such method,” Real God Long Qi’s voice was calm.

Pure Yang initial success stage to great achievement stage that he had mentioned was actually referring to Void Real God turning into Eternal Real God. It was just that the way Eternal Chaotic World and ancient times referred to realms differently.

“I am an inverse cultivator so my method is different,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Inverse cultivator? I have never heard of it,” Long Qi shook his head. There were no inverse cultivators back in ancient times.

“Don’t bother about that. Young man, I suddenly recalled that there is something that you might be able to use,” Long Qi suddenly said. At the same time, there was an item that popped into his hand.

“Mm?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the item in Long Qi’s hand.

It was a dark gold rod. The dark gold rod was long but extremely thin.

Under normal circumstances, an expert who was good with rods wouldn’t opt for a thin long rod to be his weapon.

“Lord Long Qi, this is?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

The dark gold rod was probably unsuitable for an expert who was good at rods while Jian Wushaung was a sword cultivator. A rod wouldn’t be of any use to him.

“This is Hong Jun Divine Rod. Of course, it is imitated,” Long Qi said.

“An imitated divine weapon?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Hong Jun Divine Rod wasn’t an attack divine weapon but a… Soul attack divine weapon,” Long Qi glanced at Jian Wushuang and threw the dark gold rod at Jian Wushuang at the same time.

Jian Wushuang caught the rod automatically.

He originally thought such a thin, dark gold rod shouldn’t carry much weight so he caught it with one hand. However, the moment he caught the dark gold rod…

An unprecedented strength pressed onto his hand and his palm instantly bent from the sudden pressure. His body too grew heavy and he quickly extended his other hand.

Using two hands at the same time, Jian Wushuang held the dark gold rod with difficulty.

“So heavy!”

“Too heavy. My divine power is at the level of an Almighty. In the end, I still find it strenuous to carry the rod with two hands.”

Jian Wushuang found it unbelievable. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Just how strong was an Almighty’s divine power?

Forget about the rod, he could break or lift up a hundred million jin mountain easily.

But then, the dark gold rod in his hand made him feel heavy and strained?

“Soul attack divine weapon? In other words, the rod was driven with soul power?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, you can give it a try now,” Long Qi said.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and instantly let his boundless soul power flow out to cover the dark gold rod. Then, Jian Wushuang slowly hid his palms and let his soul power carry the dark gold rod. He let it float in the air in silence.

“It’s still very heavy,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

His soul power already reached the level of a Chaotic Real God. However, it was still strenuous to carry the dark gold rod before him.

It was difficult to even carry it up. It would be total extravagant hope to manipulate the dark gold rod to kill his enemy.

“You try to control Hong Jun Divine Rod to move forward and see how far it can go,” Long Qi said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and did as what Long Qi had instructed to control the dark gold rod to move forward. However, even though he gave his all, the dark gold rod was still trembling in balance and traveling at an extremely slow speed.

After a while, the dark gold rod only traveled forward for a hundred meters and the moment it reached a hundred meters, bang! The dark gold rod directly landed on the crystal ground below and made a tremendous noise. Luckily, the material of the crystal palace was unusual. Otherwise, with the weight of the dark gold rod, it could easily break the crystal ground.

“The further the distance of soul power, the more difficult it becomes to control it. My current limit is only to control Hong Jun Divine Rod to travel for a hundred meters,” Jian Wushuang said bitterly.

“Hundred meters, barely.”

Long Qi muttered and waved his hand. Before Jian Wushuang, there was instantly a miniature gold turtle.
