Chapter 2990: Blood Blade Island

——

“Sir, are you joking? Can you complete this mission alone?” Uncle Lei’s expression turned cold. “Do you know where you are right now? This is the Godless Sea area. There are as many experts here as the clouds. There are even some Immortal Saints.”

“I, Young Master Jia, am being pursued by the four overlords of the Godless Sea area. There are more than ten Immortal Saints in each of the four overlords, and their leaders are said to be at the peak of rank one True Saint…”

Uncle Lei was interrupted by Jian Wushuang with a wave of his hand before he could finish his words.

“I know what you are talking about. The mission information that I received has a detailed introduction. I know more about the strength of the four overlords than you do. However, since I have received the mission information and know that the enemy’s strength is still daring enough to accept this mission, I naturally have the confidence to deal with it. You don’t have to worry about that.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was extremely cold.

His words also aroused the disgust of many experts in this team.

One had to know that this team had many Immortal Saints. Their young master had so many Immortal Saints escorting him, but in the end, he could only hide on this small island and did not dare to show his face at all. And now, a Divine Master had come to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance…he actually dared to say that he had the confidence to deal with it?

In the eyes of most of them, this was a joke.

“Uncle Lei, what should we do?” Young Master Qin Dong immediately looked at Uncle Lei.

Uncle Lei’s face was gloomy. He stared at Jian Wushuang, trying to see the change in his expression.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang had been wearing a mask all this time. The only thing that was exposed was his eyes, which were unusually cold. He could not figure out why.

“This time, the master asked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to issue a unique mission. That means that if anyone in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance accepts this mission, no one else will accept it during the mission period. However, if the other party wants to accept this mission, he must have the strength to complete the mission. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance will also test the difficulty of the mission!”

“And now, the Heavenly Sword Marquis has passed the examination of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and received this mission. That means that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance recognizes his strength and believes that he has the ability to complete this mission,” Uncle Lei said in a low voice.

“Ability? No matter how powerful he is, he is only a deity?” Qin Dong could not help but ask.

“There’s no other way. Now that the Heavenly Sword Marquis has arrived, we can’t let him go back. Even if we go back, we won’t have time to wait for the other experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to arrive. Therefore, we can only gamble!” Uncle Lei said.

“Gamble?” Qin Dong was stunned.

“We bet that Heavenly Sword Marquis is really confident in dealing with the four overlords as he said. At the same time, we bet that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will not violate their principles. Whoever is sent to complete this mission must have the ability to do so,” Uncle Lei said.

“So, we have to put our lives in the hands of the Divine Master?” Qin Dong’s face was a little ugly.

“There’s no other way.” Uncle Lei sighed and then looked at Jian Wushuang. “May I ask how you want to take my young master away?”

“Just follow me.”

Jian Wushuang said indifferently, but his body had already floated away.

Qin Dong and Uncle Lei looked at each other in dismay. They did not hesitate to follow him, and the rest of the team naturally followed.

Under Jian Wushuang’s lead, the group left the island and headed directly to the edge of the Godless Sea area.

On the way, the experts in the group looked a little unhappy.

“This guy wants us to leave the godless sea area so openly. Does he think that the four overlords’ spies are just for show?”

“That’s right. Without any disguise, the experts under the four overlords can recognize us as soon as they see us. Then, they will attack us directly. How can he resist them then?”

“It seems that this time, we are doomed.”

These people were more or less dispirited. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

And just as they had expected, their group of people did not need any disguise to travel in the void of the Godless Sea area. They were easily discovered by one of the four overlords, the people of Blood Blade Island.

In the Grand Palace.

“Island Master, we found the location of Young Master Qin Dong,” a thin old man reported.

“Found him?”

The Island Master of the Blood Blade Island was a young man with blood-red hair and a blood-red robe. His eyes were bewitching with red light. When he heard the report from the thin old man, the red light in his eyes was abnormally cold.

“Where did you find them?” The Island Master of the Blood Blade Island asked immediately.

“They’re in the void above the godless sea area. I don’t know what’s going on. Qin Dong and his guards are flying there without any disguise or disguise. It seems like they want to leave the godless sea area directly,” said the skinny old man.

“Without any disguise?” The Island Master of the Blood Blade Island raised his eyebrows. “Qin Dong should have known that the four overlords of the Godless Sea area have their eyes on them. He has been trying to find their location for a whole year. Now, they have shown up on their own accord?

“And they are so unscrupulous?”

Yes, Qin Dong’s people were too unscrupulous.

It was because they were unscrupulous that Blood Blade Island Master became more worried.

“Could it be that the Qin family’s experts have arrived?”

“No, the two camps over there are currently in a stalemate. Moreover, they are both monitoring and intimidating each other. If either side makes any movements, the other side will not miss this opportunity. If the people over there made any movements, I would definitely have received the news. But now, it seems that they haven’t. Moreover, if they really want to rush over from there, it will take a longer time. It is impossible for them to arrive so quickly.” The Island Master of Blood Blade Island tapped on the armchair with his fingers.

After a while, he looked up and asked, “Did our people see any special experts among Qin Dong’s guards?”

“Yes,” the skinny old man said, “according to the information from our spies, there is indeed one more person besides Qin Dong. That person is wearing a gray robe and a gray mask.”

“Gray robe? Gray mask?” The Island Master’s face suddenly changed. “Heaven-cleaving Alliance! It’s the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!”

“The Heaven-cleaving Alliance has interfered. This is troublesome.” The Blood Blade Island Master frowned.

The Blood Blade Island Master definitely knew about the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, which was famous and powerful in the Beginning Divine Realm. Moreover, he had always respected the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and did not dare to offend them.

The gray robe and the gray mask were obviously the attire of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s experts.

“Sir, our spies also sent news that the person wearing the gray robe mask is a Divine Master.” The thin and weak old man said.
