: One Versus Two

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The void had stiffened long ago.

The experts hidden in the surroundings were holding their breath as they anticipated.

Suddenly…

“Kill!”

Real God Han Quan let out an angry bellow.

In the instant the bellow stopped, Real God Han Quan and Real God Jiu Gong suddenly pounded out.

“Look.”

Real God Jiu Gong was covered in strong extermination aura, just like a demon who was going to destroy heaven and earth as he held a thick black saber in his hand.

“Green God Extermination!”

Rumble. Heaven and earth shook.

Real God Jiu Gong held the black saber in his hand and it was in constant miraculous movement.

Every miraculous movement it made gave out a suffocating power explosion. There was a total of fifteen moves and the black saber in his hand slashed fifteen times as well.

Jian Wushuang was still standing on the ground while the fifteen earth-shattering blade lights were flying towards him.

Every single one of the fifteen blade lights could easily kill a top Chaotic Real God.

Every single one of them was enough to strike fear in the experts at the surrounding of the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang glared and there was a boundless divine power that soared up. He leaped and wielded Blood Mountain Sword.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There was continuous clashing noises.

Every single clash broke the void. Heaven and earth were engulfed in an Extermination Storm.

The power dispersed after the fifteen clashes while Jian Wushuang continued to stand erect in the Extermination Storm.

“Your skill with a knife is pretty good. It’s a pity that you lack the strength,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“This boy…” Real God Jiu Gong’s face changed.

His Green God Extermination, fifteen continuous attacks of blade light, one was stronger than the other. When performed with full power, even the top ten experts on the Real God ranking list would find it difficult to withstand. However, Jian Wushuang took the attack so lightly and easily.

“Die!”

Another cold roar suddenly rang. The void behind Jian Wushuang was pierced all of a sudden.

The entire heaven and earth instantly turned murky. Among the murky heaven and earth, a dim light suddenly flashed and flew past the void. Jian Wushuang stood there and he could faintly hear tens of thousands of dragons roaring altogether. At the same time, there was a terrifying chill.

He was too lazy to even look to the back but slashed with his sword back-handedly.

A simple stroke but it contained the boundless divine power of an Almighty. He pressed his opponent with pressure. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Bong!

There was a loud thud and the universe resumed normalcy. The light grew dim and Real God Han Quan’s body flew backwards.

“Such strong power!” Real God Han Quan looked shocked as he bellowed, “Jiu Gong, this boy is very strong, far stronger than us. But his comprehension of Power of Heaven isn’t high. Don’t compete in strength, rely on techniques to kill him!”

“Understand,” Real God Jiu Gong’s gaze grew cold and the extermination aura rose again.

The boundless extermination aura soared up and instantly formed a tens of thousands of zhang tall extermination beast in the void.

The extermination beast roared and then opened its mouth. Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! One after another, extermination light shot towards Jian Wushuang.

The extermination lights weren’t exactly powerful but they were extremely fast. The direction which the lights were shot into were cunningly tricky too.

As for Real God Jiu Gong himself, he turned into a cloud of fog and hovered away.

Jian Wushuang gripped Blood Mountain Sword tightly with his right hand while his left hand quivered and exploded with a fierce divine power. It instantly shattered the void before him and the extermination lights that were aiming at him broke apart too. However, after they broke, the extermination beast that let out the lights instantly turned into a huge yet strange realm and expanded towards Jian Wushuang.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

He realized that in this realm, his sight was greatly hindered. He could only see at most ten miles surrounding him. Not only that, his soul power had been restricted in a similar fashion.

“Interesting,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Vroom!!

The void shook and a stream of darkness suddenly pounded him. Simultaneously, a blade light that contained boundless extermination power appeared next to Jian Wushuang out of nowhere and slammed at Jian Wushuang head directly.

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked by the sudden slash but he managed to respond in time. He suddenly turned and wielded Blood Mountain Sword.

The sword instantly dispersed the incoming sword light. But then, at his surroundings, there were suddenly countless dim lights from all directions.

“Boundless starlight!”

Real God Han Quan clenched his teeth as he stabbed with his long spear.

With that one stab, the countless dim lights surrounding Jian Wushuang flew towards him like lightning.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave. Even if it was him, he couldn’t block so many dim lights at that moment.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were whistles and explosions as Jian Wushuang was buried by the dim lights.

A terrifying divine power swept across and the earth shook.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two figures plunged and stopped in the void. They were Real God Jiu Gong and Real God Han Quan.

“This boy should be dead, right?” Real God Jiu Gong said in a cold voice.

“Definitely dead. My Boundless Starlight performed at such an environment earlier, it was impossible for him to block them. He is definitely dead!” Real God Han Quan was confident.

“He made the two of us team up to perform our killer techniques, Jian Wushuang died with pride,” Real God Jiu Gong sneered.

Just as the smiles on their faces were beginning to spread, they stiffened again.

In the divine power storm before them, there was a terrifying sword shadow that suddenly swept out to drive off the divine power storm. Then, a figure reappeared before everyone again.

He held his sword with one hand. The crimson robe that he was wearing turned into crimson armor that covered his body. There were a dozen faint white traces on the crimson armor, which were left by attacks from spear shadows of the boundless starlight. Although there were a dozen white traces on the crimson armor, the aura on him wasn’t worn out one bit. On the contrary… it became stronger!

“This?” Real God Jiu Gong stared. “Didn’t you say that this boy would definitely be dead? Why isn’t he dead or his aura weakened?”

“How is it possible?” Real God Han Quan had a look of disbelief.

He didn’t know that Jian Wushuang was not only strong in divine power, but also his divine body.

His divine power and divine body were at the level of an Almighty. The earlier technique was meticulous but the power was dispersed. Jian Wushuang was hit by the spear a dozen times but the remaining power after being weakened by Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor wasn’t enough to damage Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

“You have displayed almost all of your techniques. It’s my turn now.”
