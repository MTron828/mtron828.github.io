Chapter 1743: A Fight To The Death

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Since you have recognized me, all the more you have to die!” Emperor God Xue Gu’s eyes were filled with an infinite amount of murderous intent.

He was someone from the Acheron Palace and this was a secret that no one knew. However, at that time, Jian Wushuang knew about it.

“Die!”

Boom!!!

A frightening aura rose from Emperor God Xue Gu’s body and the whole universe turned into a sea of blood that was filled with countless skeletons in an instant. As for Emperor God Xue Gu, he was the emperor who ruled the sea of blood.

He was holding his crimson trident with one hand tightly. Similarly, the trident was filled with a great amount of vigor and the void shook wildly. After that, the crimson trident attacked again.

This time around, when the crimson trident attacked, it increased in size at the same time and it looked like a trident that could destroy the world. Comparing powers, it was many times stronger than before.

Upon seeing that, an unprecedented amount of madness glowed within Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

His Ancient God body was standing in the void proudly. At that moment, his right hand slapped his own forehead again.

It should be known that of the six Ancient God Stars in the space between his eyebrows, he had already destroyed three of them previously.

The Star Destruction Skill was a Secret Skill used by Ancient Gods to allow them to go all out. If only one or two stars were destroyed, it would be easy to restore them. However, if three stars were destroyed, it would be more difficult to restore them. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However…

“Slap!””Slap!””Slap!”

Sounds that sounded like constellations bursting could be heard repeatedly. At that moment, the three remaining Ancient God Stars in the space between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were destroyed at the same time.

In addition to the three stars that had been destroyed previously… Jian Wushuang had destroyed all six stars!

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang had given his all!

He wanted to fight to the death!

“Come!”

A furious roar came out of Jian Wushuang’s mouth and it reverberated across the big universe.

With all six stars destroyed, Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God Power rose again to a completely new level instantly.

Such a stage, combined with Jian Wushuang’s Stage Two Ultimate Real God’s Divine Power, made his Divine Power similar to that of a normal Emperor God!

Rumble~~~ A great amount of Divine Power moved about and it gathered at the index finger of Jian Wushuang’s right hand.

At that time, the index finger of his right hand had completely become a crystal jade and the crystal jade was dark gold in color.

“Ancient God’s Seventh Finger!”

“Vault of Heaven’s Finger!”

Jian Wushuang opened his mouth and he was extremely imposing. All of a sudden, the index finger of his right hand, which had completely changed into a crystal jade, was pointed.

The instant it was pointed out, the void in front of him burst open and a space vortex which covered tens of thousands of miles appeared from it. The space vortex was twisting everything in the universe and even the dark storm at the side twisted mercilessly.

Rustle~~~ More than half of the space storm, which originally covered the triangular island, was twisted instantly.

The Ancient God’s Finger, which was one of the Ancient God Clan’s Four Unique Skills, contained a total of nine fingers and every finger was more shocking than before.

Just the Sixth Finger, the Sun Corrosion Finger, was already earth-shaking.

For the Seventh Finger, it would be very difficult for even Seven-star Ancient Gods to use it under normal circumstances. Similarly, Jian Wushuang could not use it previously.

It was not until all his six stars were destroyed and that his Ancient God Power rose greatly like never before that he could use the Seventh Finger for real.

The Vault of Heaven’s Finger!

A finger that could destroy the vault of heaven!

A giant, dark golden finger came out from the space vortex which covered tens of thousands of miles and it clashed head-on with the incoming crimson trident which had expanded crazily right away.

With the clash, there were no violent booming sounds like before. However, the instant both attacks clashed, millions of miles of the surrounding void were torn apart into pieces. For example, the dark storm which had already been hit to the point that it almost fell apart was torn into pieces at that moment. In addition, the whole triangular island was completely exposed.

In the void, two shocking powers were still opposing each other crazily.

However, all of a sudden… boom!

A great amount of aura descended from the void on top abruptly.

Emperor God Xue Gu’s expression changed. After that, he raised his head abruptly and saw that the vault of heaven on top had undergone some changes for some reason.

The vault of heaven had already changed into an extremely beautiful world. The world contained mountains, rivers, birds singing and the fragrance of flowers.

The most eye-catching thing was the nine lofty continents that existed within the world. For the nine lofty continents, each of them was extremely huge and vast and the supreme aura that it emitted caused even Emperor God Xue Gu to be slightly fearful.

“This is a… Chaos Divine Treasure?” Emperor God Xue Gu’s eyes shrank.

Chaos Divine Treasures were the most powerful and valuable treasures in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Even Almighties and Real Gods did not have the right to possess them.

For example, many Sir Gods, which included some Sir Gods with weaker abilities, did not have the right to possess a Chaos Divine Treasure.

As for Emperor God Xue Gu himself, he possessed a Chaos Divine Treasure and it was the crimson trident in his hands. The trident was extremely powerful and with its power, Emperor God Xue Gu could be said to be someone powerful among the Emperor Gods.

However, the trident was merely an attack-type Divine Weapon. Among many kinds of Divine Weapons, attack-type Divine Weapons were no doubt worth the least.

However, the extremely beautiful continent which had appeared on top had caused Emperor God Xue Gu’s eyes to become scorching hot.

“It’s indeed a Chaos Divine Treasure. Moreover, it’s a kind of Chaos Divine Treasure that is extremely special and it is worth so much that it is shocking!” Emperor God Xue Gu’s shook.

He knew how valuable Chaos Divine Treasures were.

For his trident, he had paid a huge price for it. He had obtained it by luck after experiencing many life and death situations when he had entered a battlefield deep inside the Second Lair.

Even though it was only an attack-type Divine Weapon, it was still enough to make many Almighties envious of him.

However, for the Chaos Divine Treasure that Jian Wushuang took out, looking at its worth alone, it was worth at least ten times more than his crimson trident!

“Haha, this is really not a wasted trip.” Emperor God Xue Gu was extremely excited. His eyes, which were looking at Jian Wushuang, became filled with even more murderous intent.

“You wish to kill me and snatch my treasure away?” Jian Wushuang could see through Emperor God Xue Gu’s thoughts completely and he grinned hideously, “That will depend on whether you can survive this!”

“Mountain River Map!”

“Mountain river as palm and nine-province as seal!”

Jian Wushuang uttered every word with a pause and every word contained a special demonic power.

In the vast vault of heaven, within the world of the picture scroll which contained a total of nine lofty continents, one of the continents was as if it were completely alive and it freed itself from the world of the picture scroll. After that, it descended slowly.

Rumble~~~ The universe shook and all beings trembled with fear.

“This power…”

Even if it were Emperor God Xue Gu, when he saw the continent that was descending, his eyes became filled with fear.

“Nine-province of the universe, Qing Province as the seal.”

“First Seal, Split the Heavens!!!”

Boom!

The lofty continent descended completely.

Mountain River Map, the First Seal of the Nine Seals of Nine-province had descended!!!

In a split second, all the living creatures in the world submitted themselves!
