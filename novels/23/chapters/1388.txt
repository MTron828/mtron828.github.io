In a lofty palace, Bei Xiu, who was being entertained by a few beautiful concubines, revealed a shocked gaze.

“Finally. He is finally willing to leave Soul Island?”

Bei Xiu looked unusually cold.

“Jian Wushuang, I waited for you for so long. I thought you would stay on Soul Island for the rest of your life.”

Soul Island was the headquarters of Soul Master Temples. Although he had a strong background, it was best if he didn’t take action against Jian Wushuang openly.

But then, it was different if Jian Wushuang left Soul Island.

“If you’re leaving, don’t return for the rest of your life!”

There was murderous intention spreading across Bei Xiu’s sight. The very next moment, he left his palace.

…

In a deserted region.

A place that was publicly acknowledged to be very dangerous in Tian Ling land.

Even the top Gods in Tian Ling land didn’t dare to let loose when they were to be in the deserted region.

After all, there was a Real God that had fallen in the deserted region.

The deserted region was famous for its beasts.

Jian Wushuang, Feng Tao and Huo Yi had already arrived in the deserted region.

However, from the beginning, they had merely wandered around the border of the deserted region, not daring to go in deep.

“It’s a beast!”

Feng Tao turned to look and Jian Wushuang looked too. They immediately saw a unique-looking beast hiding among the bushes at the end of their sight.

“That is the beast?”

Jian Wushuang could feel the beast’s aura, which was rather unique. It was obviously different from the beast on Tian Ling land and the Eternal Chaotic World.

And that was the kind of beast that could nurture Tian Ling Crystal.

“It’s a pity that it is merely a rank two beast,” Huo Yi shook his head.

Jian Wushuang shrugged.

He also knew that only when a beast reached rank three could it be compared favorably with a three-starred Soul Master or a level three Divine General, which was when they had successfully nurtured a Desolate Crystal. As for those below rank three, the crystal would only be under the process. Even if they got it, there wouldn’t be much point.

Jian Wushuang’s task was to get ten Desolate Crystals. The Desolate Crystals, of course, had to be complete crystals.

In other words, he had to find a way to kill ten beasts that could compare favorably with three-starred Soul Masters and level three Divine Generals.

“Look for them slowly. Although this is the border of the deserted region, there is still danger. We have to be careful.” Feng Tao said.

Jian Wushuang and Huo Yi both nodded, then the three of them continued to go forward into the woods.

After a few days.

Rumble!

The green giant who was giving out a green gleam wielded his mace ferociously at the beast before him, which was more than five meters in size.

The beast swung a punch and collided with the green giant’s mace directly. Bang! There was a loud collision and the green giant fall a few steps back.

“Die!”

Huo Yi roared and suddenly he appeared behind the beast and he was holding a purple spear in his hand. The spear was consolidated via consciousness and stabbed at the beast.

“Roar!”

The beast let out an earth-shattering bellow and it turned and hit the green giant. The terrifying impact shattered the long spear and Huo Yi’s figure flew out altogether.

But then, a demonic dragon with a soaring aura entangled the beast’s body straight away. The demonic dragon had great power and it squashed the beast with intensity. At the same time, its dragon claw seized the beast’s back-spine while it chewed on the beast’s skull.

Kacha!

Although the beast’s defense power was strong, the demonic dragon’s bite broke it into two and a large amount of blood and flesh splashed around. The beast’s body shook and finally collapsed.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Feng Tao and Huo Yi appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re the best. Huo Yi and I can’t do anything about it,” Feng Tao looked at the dead body before him and laughed.

“Of course. Jian Wushuang is a peak three-starred Soul Master. How could a beginner three-starred Soul Master like us be comparable?” Huo Yi said.

“Huo Yi, hurry and dig out the Desolate Crystal,” Jian Wushuang said.

Huo Yi beamed with joy. He immediately squatted down to dissect the beast. Very quickly, he picked up a shimmering emerald green crystal.

“A Desolate Crystal. This is a good one!” Huo Yi held the emerald-green crystal and smiled delightedly.

“This is only the first one. Look how happy you are! We have a peak three-starred Soul Master like Jian Wushuang, so now we can have however many Desolate Crystal we want,” Feng Tao laughed.

“I’m flattered. I can only deal with weaker level three beasts. If we were to come across some that were stronger, I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Jian Wushuang, Feng Tao, I have a suggestion,” Huo Yi suddenly said.

Jian Wushuang and Feng Tao looked at Huo Yi.

“The deserted region is huge. Although it is only the border, it is still rather vast. Although there are many level-three beasts around this area, it is not easy to find them. The three of us spent a few days finding just one and that was considered lucky. If we were to be unlucky, we might not find one that we could deal with even in ten days or half a month.”

“So, I suggest that we part ways and look for the beasts. What do you think?” Huo Yi said.

“Separately?”

Jian Wushuang was fine with the idea but Feng Tao creased his eyebrows slightly, “The possibility to find a level-three beast if we were to go in separate ways is definitely greater. However, the probability to come across danger increases tremendously too. It’s fine with Jian Wushuang, but if it were to be either one of us, we might lose our lives.”

“Don’t worry. As long as we are not too far away and we keep in contact, once any of us is in danger, the other two can rush over for support,” Huo Yi smiled and explained.

“I’m fine with this,” Feng Tao nodded in agreement.

If they were not too far apart, they definitely could rush to one another in time with their traveling speed.

“Let’s part ways then,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The three of them immediately split up in the deserted region. Although they had separated, the three of them kept in touch at all times so that they knew one another’s rough location.

Jian Wushuang continued to look for rank three beasts in the region.

Only on the third day after they separated did Jian Wushuang find a rank three beast.

“The beast doesn’t have a strong aura. It should have just turned into a rank three beast not long ago. It is much weaker compared to the one I killed earlier. I can deal with it alone,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and then took quick action.

After a while, Jian Wushuang killed the beast directly. Then, he picked up a Desolate Crystal from its dead body.
