Chapter 3674: I Am the Heavenly Dao

“Jian Wushuang, are you saying that our Eternal Chaotic World was separated from the Divine Beginning Realm?” White Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Over the years, the Divine Beginning Realm was completely isolated from the Eternal Chaotic World because of the existence of the seal formation. This led to the gradual decline of the Eternal Chaotic World. Even the experts left behind from the ancient times were forced to sleep, but they were unable to leave this world. If you want to change this situation, you must remove the seal formation.”

“Jian Wushuang, since you can return to the Eternal Chaotic World from the Divine Beginning Realm, you must have a way to remove the seal formation, right?” The White Emperor asked.

“Of course I have a way to remove the seal formation, but I won’t do it.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, “To be honest, the existence of the seal formation has a very special meaning. Now that I’ve completely refined the seal formation, I’ve also refined the Eternal Chaotic World into my Secret Realm.”

“Under such circumstances, it’s impossible for me to remove the seal formation. However, I can leave a passage to the Divine Beginning Realm. In the future, any cultivator from the Eternal Chaotic World who meets certain conditions can enter the Divine Beginning Realm by themselves through the passage.”

White Emperor nodded secretly.

Although Jian Wushuang did not remove the seal formation directly, it was enough as long as there was a passage connecting the Divine Beginning Realm so that the cultivators from the Eternal Chaotic World could enter the Divine Beginning Realm normally.

“By the way, you just said that after you refined the seal formation, the entire Eternal Chaotic World became your Secret Realm. What do you mean?” The White Emperor asked, puzzled.

“It means that the Eternal Chaotic World is now completely under my control. To be more precise, I now represent the will of the Heavenly Dao of the Eternal Chaotic World. All the rules and order of the Heavenly Dao of the Eternal Chaotic World are under my control,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What?” The White Emperor was shocked.

The hundreds of cultivators on the throne were also shocked when they heard Jian Wushuang’s words.

The current Jian Wushuang was equivalent to the will of the Heavenly Dao in the Eternal Chaotic World?

The cultivators in the Eternal Chaotic World had always been in awe of the will of the Heavenly Dao because that power was simply out of their reach. However, what Jian Wushuang said now…he had become the will of the Heavenly Dao in the Eternal Chaotic World. This was simply unbelievable to everyone present.

“Jian Wushuang, are you...are you telling the truth?” White Emperor was in disbelief.

“Of course it’s true, and I will naturally prove it.” Jian Wushuang did not explain too much. Instead, he waved his hand.

In an instant, the world changed.

The people who were in the Hall of the Wushuang Saint Realm came to a vast and dark void in the next moment.

“Dark void?”

“We are in the dark void?”

“It’s really the dark void. With a wave of his hand, he quietly brought us to the dark void. What kind of trick is this?”

Jian Wushuang raised his hand again in shock.

He pointed at the dark and boundless void in front of him.

“Condense!”

As soon as he said that, a special power suddenly descended.

This power represented the heavenly will of the Eternal Chaotic World and the order and principles of this world. It directly descended into the vast void.

Then, under Jian Wushuang’s guidance, an Eternal World began to grow and evolve rapidly.

Under normal circumstances, it took a long time for an Eternal World to fully grow. But now, under Jian Wushuang’s guidance, the Eternal World was growing and evolving at an incredible speed, in just a moment, it had completed the early stages of its growth. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

An incomparably complete Eternal World appeared in front of everyone, and the Eternal World had begun to give birth to cultivators.

This scene shocked the hundreds of cultivators present and rendered them speechless.

Many people subconsciously thought that this was an illusion. They had quietly fallen into the illusion. But soon, as their perception became clearer and clearer, and they even had a short contact with the Eternal World, only then did they understand.

This was not an illusion, but a real one.

With just a thought, Jian Wushuang had formed a complete Eternal World!

And when he condensed the Eternal World, the unseen power descended. All of this proved that what Jian Wushuang said before was true.

Now, he had completely controlled the Eternal Chaotic World. His will was equivalent to the will of the Heavenly Dao of the Eternal Chaotic World.

He was the Heavenly Dao of the Eternal Chaotic World!

“Jian Wushuang, I can’t believe that you’ve reached such an incredible level in less than ten million years. You’ve directly refined the Eternal Chaotic World and controlled the Heavenly Dao Order of the Eternal Chaotic World. Tsk, tsk...”

White Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang and could not help but exclaim in admiration, “If I’m not wrong, you, who can control the Heavenly Dao Order of the Eternal Chaotic World, must be a top expert even in the Divine Beginning Realm, right?”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, which was a tacit agreement.

“I knew it.” The White Emperor sighed, then he said seriously, “You said that you would leave a passage to the Divine Beginning Realm so that the cultivators of our Eternal Chaotic World can enter the Divine Beginning Realm. However, in the Eternal Chaotic World, apart from us native cultivators, there are also those ancient experts who are sleeping. Once you open the passage, those ancient experts will definitely be alarmed.”

“Of course. Although the cultivation conditions in the Eternal Chaotic World have improved a lot compared to tens of millions of years ago, they are still incomparable to the Divine Beginning Realm. Those ancient experts had no choice but to sleep here. Once they have a chance to return to the Divine Beginning Realm, they will certainly seize it. When the passage to the Divine Beginning Realm is opened, those ancient experts will probably wake up,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If that’s the case, we have to be careful. After all, those ancient experts are all extremely powerful. If they were to wake up in one go...it would be fine if they could follow the rules. But if they don’t, it would definitely be a disaster for our Eternal Chaotic World.” The White Emperor frowned.

Although he had been publicly acknowledged as the number one expert in the Eternal Chaotic World all these years, he knew very well how terrifying those ancient experts who slept in the Eternal Chaotic World were. Toward those ancient experts…the White Emperor had always been incomparably fearful.
