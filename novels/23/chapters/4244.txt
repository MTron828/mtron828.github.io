4245 Feeling the Power of God

As hurried discussions broke out, Ruler Hao Jin raised his head, a hint of pride on his face.

The current him felt a greater sense of achievement when he heard others praise the Blood Sword than when he heard them praise himself.

On the sixth level of the God Refining Tower.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was grave and he was panting slightly. he did not look relaxed at all.

!!

The trial on the fifth level of the God Refining Tower was for a Sword Saint expert who had comprehended the tyrant’s sword path from ancient times. His strength was extremely powerful. Even for him, he had to go through a fierce battle before he could kill him with extreme difficulty with the Sundering Stars sword.

Of course, after killing the Ancient Sword Saint, Jian Wushuang also gained a lot. He gained all the comprehension of the ancient sword saint’s sword principle.

Jian Wushuang could feel that his comprehension of the third level of the origin of sword essence was like a bucket that was not filled with water. As he absorbed the comprehension of the sword principle of Gale Swordsman and the ancient sword Saint, it gradually became complete and spotless.

He only needed to absorb the origin comprehension of a sword expert’s sword Dao, and he would be able to break through the third level of the sword Dao origin in the universe and reach the fourth level!

At that time, his offensive power and swordsmanship divine arts would have a tremendous change again!

As he was thinking, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes and looked around.

This was the sixth floor.

The sixth level was a chaotic void. The law energy here was comparable to the Dao Comprehension River.

In the void and chaos, there was only a huge painting hanging.

In the huge painting, there was a figure wearing silver armor and holding a long sword. he looked like a guardian knight and a divine general of the ancient heavenly court.

The figure’s face was covered in silver armor, and his appearance could not be seen clearly. Only a pair of tightly shut eyes were exposed.

His figure was straight and he was filled with a dignified and inviolable aura.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a touch of coldness.

With just a glance, he could feel the threat that the silver-armored figure gave him.

The next moment.

“Mortal, do you want to challenge god’s might?”

A voice like Rolling Thunder came from the giant painting.

Then, the divine general in silver armor in the portrait suddenly opened his eyes.

Two extremely sharp beams of light burst out from his eyes.

Jian Wushuang did not reply. Instead, he took a deep breath and raised the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand.

This sword could not be avoided.

Ka-chak.

Then, a crack appeared in the middle of the portrait. The divine general in silver armor grabbed the crack with both hands and walked out.

An earth-shaking pressure suddenly descended on the entire area!

Under this pressure, the entire chaotic world seemed to tremble.

“Mortal, I am the first divine general under God Emperor daoless from 300 chaos cycles ago, Fei Hong. Countless Ultimate Rulers have died by my hands. Are you ready to pay with your life to challenge my dignity?” The flying swan divine sword was expressionless. it looked at Jian Wushuang with an oppressive gaze.

“You talk too much.”

Jian Wushuang snorted coldly and immediately controlled the Wuqi Divine Sword, turning into a sword light that charged at Divine General Fei Hong.

“My sword Dao is only for killing. Feel the power of God!”

When Divine General Fei Hong saw this, he suddenly drew the divine sword in his hand. A bloody aura instantly emanated from the divine sword in his hand!

“Split open the sky!”

Jian Wushuang’s black hair flew in the wind as he shouted coldly. The heaven-opening sword light in his hand slashed down at Divine General Fei Hong!

“A puny power.”

Divine General Fei Hong shook his head nonchalantly as he casually swung his sword at the heaven-opening sword ray!

This sword was just a casual strike, but it was filled with a sense of oppression and slaughter. It was as if there was an invisible force that wanted to drag people into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.

Bang!

With a loud explosion, the ever-victorious heaven-opening sword ray was split apart by a casual swing of Divine General Fei Hong’s hand.

“He’s very strong.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. With just a single exchange, he could feel that Divine General Fei Hong’s fighting power was definitely at the fighting power of an unrivaled Ruler. He was much stronger than anyone he had met in the God Refining Tower.

“The laws of the universe, the power of will!”

At that moment, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate anymore. He immediately used the ten times power of will that the universe had given him and the divine power in his body increased by ten times!

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang shouted in a low voice.

“Sundering Stars!”

The 1,000-foot sword rainbow instantly condensed. Jian Wushuang held the 1000-foot sword rainbow in his hand and slashed down at the flying swan divine sword like a peerless sword God!

This sword was enough to destroy a star.

“Oh? This sword strike is indeed remarkable.”

Divine General Fei Hong raised an eyebrow as a look of surprise flashed through his eyes.

Then, he shook his head and said, “However, that’s all there is to it.”

With that, Divine General Fei Hong’s divine sword was covered in blood as it slashed down at the sword rainbow!

The slaughter Sword Dao is indomitable. It’s the invincible sword Dao!

A blood dragon rushed out of the divine sword in Divine General Fei Hong’s hand, roaring and howling. It opened its mouth and bit the sword rainbow.

A burst of extremely overbearing sword essence immediately shot out from the blood dragon, trying to suppress the sword rainbow. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ka ka ka!

“Ka ka ka!”

In an instant, the blood dragon and the thousand-foot sword rainbow clashed. The two sword intents kept clashing and intertwining, making a muffled sound that shattered the void.

It seems that Divine General Fei Hong’s comprehension of sword Dao origin has also reached stage three top class!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and thoughts flashed through his mind.

If Jian Wushuang could defeat the flying swan divine sword and obtain his comprehension of the origin of sword principle, he was confident that even if he could not break through to the fourth level of the origin of sword principle immediately, it would be a matter of time.

All of a sudden, Divine General Fei Hong, who had been extremely difficult to deal with, had become a hot commodity in Jian Wushuang’s eyes to improve his comprehension of sword principle.

At that moment, a decisive look flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. His divine power, which was more than thirteen thousand times stronger, burst out and the universe law was also integrated into his swordsmanship. Without any hesitation, he attacked the flying swan divine sword.

Innate divine power, original universe!

At the same time, Jian Wushuang activated the original universe, which could greatly reduce the opponent’s power. The entire sixth level of the God Refining Tower was filled with suppression of Divine General Fei Hong.

“Oh? Mortal, I have to admit that you do have the qualifications to challenge me.”

Divine General Fei Hong’s eyes narrowed and he no longer held back. His majestic and overbearing divine power and unfathomable laws of the universe burst forth.

His aura started to surge!

“Mortal, feel the power of god!!!”

BOOM!

A sword Dao battle that transcended space and time had begun.
