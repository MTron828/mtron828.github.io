“Even you don’t think you can beat him?” Holy Master Dong Ming could not help but frown.

“Yes, but even if I can’t defeat him, he also can’t easily bring me down. Besides, this is the stronghold of the Ancient Demon Clan. We have the advantage of numbers. Jian Nantian said that they would come alone, so there is nothing to worry about.”

“The Heaven-ceasing Peak is a forbidden area in the Ancient Demon Clan. No one has been broken the rules and entered it since our clan was founded. Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang don’t have the right to enter the forbidden ground either!”

“He expects us to hand over her. How ridiculous!”

“Give my order to all our clansmen to prepare for a fight. In less than a month, we must give the disrespectful father and son a good welcome!”

Holy Master Ku Xin’s voice boomed in the palace hall.

The experts of the Ancient Demon Clan listened to him attentively, their eyes teeming with confidence.

There were three Holy Masters in the clan, but Holy Master Ku Xin was the most powerful. The clansmen were convinced that Ku Xin was the Ancient Demon Clan’s best chance in the coming battle.

The death of Holy Master Lei Yi was a huge blow to the Ancient Demon Clan. But as long as Holy Master Ku Xin was alive and well, the experts in Ancient Demon Clan would not lose their confidence.

The experts in the hall dispersed.

Holy Master Ku Xin lept into the air and and soared over pine trees toward a giant mountain in the center of the Ancient Demon Clan.

Tens of thousands of meters high, the giant mountain towered in the sky.

This was a breathtaking mountain, and around it were swirling scarlet currents, which encircled the entire mountain like roaring flames.

This was Heaven-ceasing Peak!

It stood right in the center of the Ancient Demon Clan, but generations of Ancient Demon Clansmen were still in awe of the mysterious mountain.

An old Black Tower lay at the cloud-covered summit of the rocky mountain.

Standing at nineteen stories tall, the Black Tower was massive.

On the nineteenth floor of the tower, a blue-robed woman sat cross-legged on a stone bed. Only silence accompanied her in the dim empty space atop the ancient Black Tower.

The woman exuded elegance, and though she was middle-aged, she still looked attractive with her snow-white skin.

However, the blue-robed woman was chained, both her hands and legs wore handcuffs and fetters made of a special material. Besides, she was trapped by a Restriction. Her Spiritual Power had been sealed, and so had her Bloodline Power.

She had been confined to this Black Tower for over 2000 years, and couldn’t move more than a radius of ten meaters around the stone bed.

Despite her imprisonment, she was calm and composed.

Of course, during the first few days of the 2000 years, she had struggled and was almost driven to madness, but time had calmed her down.

Suddenly…

“Apprentice!”

A strong, old voice penetrated the Restrictions on the giant mountain and passed through the Black Tower.

It reached the blue-robed woman’s ear.

“Master!”

The woman raised her head, looking calm.

The Holy Master Ku Xin, standing on the Void around the giant mountain, fixed his eyes on the old tower. He continued, “I must inform you. A month from now, our clan will have two guests–Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang.”

“What?”

The blue-robed woman in the Black Tower jumped up excitedly.

“Master, you promised me. You promised to spare them as long as I stayed here to reflect upon my mistakes!”

“You promised me!”

The desperate howls from the blue-robed woman echoed out from within the tower.

With the yells came a forceful push from the bloodline, and Holy Master Ku Xin frowned.

“More than 2000 years have passed, and she has suffered torment and pain in the Heaven-ceasing Peak. I thought that she would have forgotten them, but she is still thrilled at the sound of their names,”?Holy Master Ku Xin thought remorselessly.

“I have kept the promise that I made to you. Since I brought you here, our clansmen have not laid hands on either of them. I punished Jiu Xiu for extracting Jian Nantian’s Sword Soul. We had no intention of turning against them, but now they have threatened to attack our clan!” he continued with a sneer.

“What did you say?” The blue-robed woman was stunned. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang are coming to attack the clan?”

How is this possible?”

“I have underestimated them. I did not expect either of them to have attained such a high cultivation within 2000 years. Now one of them is a Supervisor of the Samsara Temple. Moreover, he is likely to become the personal disciple of the Samsara Temple Master and he has the battle strength equal to any Holy Master who has reached the Exceptional Realm. He is now my opponent.”

“The other is your son, Jian Wushuang. Although he is only at the Eternal Realm level, he is so strong that he brought down Holy Master Lei Yi.”

“They unparalleled talents of the Green Fire World, of the type seen only every billion years. Besides, yesterday they announced that they will break into the Heaven-ceasing Peak and kill anyone who gets in their way,” the Holy Master said coldly. These words also reached the blue-robed woman.

She was even more astounded.

“How did this happen?”

“What’s going on?”

The woman was full of doubts.

Since she chose to enter the Heaven-ceasing Peak, she never expected to be able to see either of them again. She hadn’t even dreamed that they would come to rescue her one day. All she really wanted for them was to live a safe and peaceful life in the Ancient World

But now…

“Apprentice!”

After a pause, Holy Master Ku Xin continued, “You already know the power of our clan and the reality of your situation. No one can save you.”

“In a month, the battle between our clan and the two of them cannot be avoided.”

“I promise you that I will not kill them, but I hope you can completely erase them from your mind this time. This is the best solution for our clan as well as for them!”
