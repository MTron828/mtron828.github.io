Chaos Divine Treasure?

The Emperor Sword Sect Master had demanded three divine weapons and one defense armor. However, all of them had to be Chaos Divine Treasures?

Upon hearing that, the first thought that the large number of experts present had was that the Emperor Sword Sect Master was crazy.

They were Chaos Divine Treasures. Even the most normal attack-type divine weapons were enough to cause many Emperor Gods to cast their covetous eyes on it or even go crazy for it. After all, most of the weaker Emperor Gods did not possess a single Chaos Divine Treasure, and one such example was Emperor God Xuan Wu.

Let alone a defense armor, which was more valuable than attack-type divine weapons.

It was just to enter the Emperor Sword Palace and Jian Wushuang possessed the Sword Principle Inheritance Token. Under such circumstances, the Emperor Sword Sect Master still demanded such an unbelievable price from him.

He was indeed crazy.

However, upon thinking about the words that the Emperor Sword Sect Master had just said, in that it was possible for the Sword Principle Inheritance Token that Jian Wushuang had taken out to be an imitation, everyone present understood.

All of them knew that the Emperor Sword Sect Master was making things difficult for Jian Wushuang on purpose.

As for the three Chaos Divine Treasure-level attack-type weapons and one defense armor, it was said by him randomly and even he himself knew that it was impossible.

“Emperor Sword Sect Master, I am probably not the only one who has come here with the Sword Principle Inheritance Token. I wonder what is the price that the rest of them paid?” Jian Wushuang questioned indifferently.

“Apart from you, Luo Xianzi came with a Sword Principle Inheritance Token. As for the price that she paid, its worth was naturally not less than yours,” the Emperor Sword Sect Master laughed.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang could not help but glance at Luo Xianzi.

However, it was a pity that Luo Xianzi still looked ice-cold and she did not say anything.

“Looks like this trip of mine was wasted,” Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically.

“Sword Emperor, since you are unable to pay the price, I’m sorry but you have to leave. Oh right, before you leave, you have to leave the Sword Principle Inheritance Token behind. It just so happens that this time around, my Emperor Sword Sect has a new genius Real God. Hence, it will be appropriate to give him this Sword Principle Inheritance Token,” Emperor Sword Sect Master said dully and his words were filled with ridicule.

“What a pity,” Jian Wushuang sighed lightly and he seemed to be unable to do anything. However, all of a sudden, Jian Wushuang raised his head again and he wore a joking smile. “Emperor Sword Sect Master, let’s change the conditions.”

“Change the conditions? How will we change it?” the Emperor Sword Sect Master looked over.

“Let’s forget about the three Chaos Divine Treasure-level attack-type divine weapons and defense armor. Instead, let me use the lives of the large number of disciples and experts of your Emperor Sword Sect in exchange for my right to enter the Emperor Sword Sect. What do you think?” Jian Wushuang said randomly.

As soon as his words left his mouth, the whole palace froze instantly.

The large number of experts in the palace opened their eyes wide and they had shocked expressions.

Using the lives of the large number of disciples and experts of the Emperor Sword Sect to exchange for his right to enter?

The meaning behind Jian Wushuang’s words…

“Sword Emperor, may I know what you are trying to say?” the Emperor Sword Sect Master’s expression turned cold and gloomy.

“What I am trying to say? Could it be that the Emperor Sword Sect Master really does not understand?”

Jian Wushuang laughed, “Before I came, I heard that there was an episode between you and my Palace Master in the past. Hence, I had already expected you to make things difficult for me on purpose. Originally, I planned to allow you to make things difficult for me. After all, your Emperor Sword Sect is the one who is in control of Emperor Sword Palace. As long as you do not overdo it, on the account of Sword Emperor Dugu, it will be alright even if I were to suffer losses.”

“However, it’s a pity that you are too stupid!”

“You are too arrogant!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice resounded within the palace slowly and the hearts of the large number of experts from the Emperor Sword Sect twitched.

They had a bad feeling.

At the next moment, what they expected really happened.

All of a sudden, frightening god power burst forth from Jian Wushuang’s body and it was accompanied by an extremely powerful sword essence which wanted to tear the vault of heaven apart. The god power covered the Emperor Sword Sect instantly.

Under the god power and sword essence, it was still alright for those Almighties in the palace. However, as for some of the Real Gods of the Emperor Sword Sect who stayed in the palace, as well as the large number of disciples of the Emperor Sword Sect who were outside the palace, most of them knelt down instantly. As for those people who were close to Jian Wushuang, blood flowed out of their ears, noses and mouths.

Such a scene caused the Emperor Sword Sect Master’ expression to change greatly.

“Jian Wushuang, please stop this!”

With a loud cry, an extremely powerful aura rose from the Emperor Sword Sect Master’s body.

Two frightening auras then clashed head-on in the palace, boom!

Under the attack of the two auras, the whole palace was smashed into pieces at once. The large number of experts inside the palace rose in succession.

A large number of experts appeared at the void and at the same time, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! A few figures flew over in succession from the surrounding. They were some of the Almighties of the Emperor Sword Sect.

Although the Emperor Sword Sect was not as powerful as the Abysmal Palace and Soaring Heaven King Palace. It was extremely old and it had a great foundation. On top of that, they were in control of the Emperor Sword Palace, a place that was rich in resources. Furthermore, they had a large number of experts. They had a total of seven Almighties. However, among them, the Emperor Sword Sect Master was the only Emperor God.

Just then, the seven Almighties, which included Emperor Sword Sect Master, were standing together and they were looking at Jian Wushuang with anger.

As for the experts who had come for the Emperor Sword Palace, all of them stood to the side and it was obvious that they did not want to be involved.

“Jian Wushuang, what are you trying to do?” the Emperor Sword Sect Master’s face was filled with fury.

Jian Wushuang’s suppression with his Divine Power previously had merely caused the consciousness of the disciples inside the Emperor Sword Sect to take some damage and no one had any serious injuries. However, Jian Wushuang’s actions were the same as hitting the face of the Emperor Sword Sect. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“What am I trying to do? Could it be that the Emperor Sword Sect Master has not guessed yet?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “I have already said that this Sect Master of yours is too stupid!”

“In actual fact, the moment I came to your Emperor Sword Sect, you should have treated me with respect. Not to mention making things difficult for me, if it were a Sect Master who was more sensible, he would probably be extremely modest and he would not get me to pay any price to enter the Emperor Sword Palace. Moreover, he might even think of ways to make friends with me.”

“As he is certain of one thing. Not to mention the fact that I possessed the Sword Principle Inheritance Token, even if I did not have it, with my abilities, I would still be able to enter the Emperor Sword Palace easily without much effort.”

“But you… haha. No wonder even though the Emperor Sword Sect possessed the Emperor Sword Palace, which is rich in resources, it is still unable to come up on top in terms of ranking among the large number of big powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and this caused Emperor Sword Sect Master to have an even uglier expression.

“How impudent! Jian Wushuang, don’t forget that you are now in my Emperor Sword Sect and you are not in your Lineage of Star,” the Emperor Sword Sect Master said with flames of fury.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushang shook his head and laughed, “You still do not understand. Be it the Lineage of Star or the Emperor Sword Sect, to me, aren’t both of them the same?”

As soon as his words left his mouth, Jian Wushuang’s body moved.

In the Emperor Sword Sect, the base of the Emperor Sword Sect, Jian Wushuang commenced his attack!
