Chapter 5334: Shocking Battle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The black-robed Emperor finally turned into ashes, leaving no trace of breath behind.

Ever since Jian Wushuang stepped into the seventh layer of the Ultimate Sword Dao, some structures within the Immortal Array gradually became less suitable for him. However, there hadn‚Äôt been much time for improvements.

Now it seemed that he wouldn‚Äôt have the opportunity for that anymore.

The towering demonic incarnation of the heavens destroyed half of the Beishan City. The city lord, who presided over this place, had long fled to the depths of Zhangzhou with his people, afraid to show his face. Fearful that Liuyang would go mad and slaughter him too.

Crack!

Jian Wushuangs body, pushed to the limit, radiated a colorful halo.

‚ÄúDaoist Liuyang, I have no grudges with you. Why push it to this extent?‚Äù Although he suspected Liuyangs identity was extraordinary, possibly a force opposing the Qishen Temple, he had no other choice. He hoped the other wouldn‚Äôt directly strike, believing that if he could stall for time, miracles might happen.

Zhen Ling had given him the Jade Tablet of the Qishen. There should be significant value in him. If he could delay for a while, perhaps Zhen Ling would appear.

Daoist Six Suns crushed some Black Emperors into pieces. He looked dovvn at Xiao Budian with a ferocious expression.

Daoist Liuyang casually crushed some remnants of the black-robed Emperor. The towering figure looked down at the tiny Jian Wushuang, revealing a hint of ferocity.

‚ÄúJian Wushuang, don‚Äôt play tricks. Even if the the Divine Temple Master comes today, he won‚Äôt be able to save you!‚Äù Liuyangs voice was extremely sinister.

He was extremely loyal to the Shadow Sect and had great expectations for them.

He hoped that one day, the Shadow Sect would defeat the Divine Temple and truly control the Four Great Secret Realms.

From this perspective, Liuyangs understanding of the Qishen Temple was not deep enough.

As soon as Jian Wushuang heard the mention of the Divine Temple Master, he immediately thought of the four temples mentioned by the old man with the goat horns. In the Original Realm, it was Zhu Yi‚Äôs territory.

Here was the territory of White Tiger Temple.

‚ÄúDaoist Liuyang, don‚Äôt let yourself be deceived. The Four Great Secret Realms are not what you imagine. The Temple Master is not the strongest in the Four Great Secret Realms; there a_re even more powerful beings.‚Äù

He was right. The Four Great Secret Realms truly did not belong to the White Tiger Temple; the true controller was Zhen Ling.

Daoist Liuyang had been a member of the Shadow Sect since he was weak, and he couldn‚Äôt be intimidated by this. He sneered, ‚ÄúArrogant kid, just because you come from the God‚Äôs Tomb Secret Realm, don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve seen enough. I understand the heavens better than you!‚Äô

As he spoke, he pointed to the sky above.

The strength of the Shadow Sect, in Liuyangs eyes, was beyond the imagination of a Dao Lord like Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this scene, Jian Wushuang understood that the other party was a fool, like a trapped beast in a cage, ignorant of the vast world beyond.

Ignoring strength, Jian Wushuang knew much more than Daoist Liuyang.

At the very least, he knew this place was the Qishen Temple.

The outside world was vast and boundless, while this place was like a birdcage.

Boom!

In the distant sky, a white-haired man moved at an extremely fast speed, much faster than the ancient boat. Just as Jian Wushuang sensed the opponent, the man had already arrived in front of him.

Looking at the man before him, Jian Wushuang couldn‚Äôt help but tremble. The aura was terrifying, comparable to Shan Jun, although Shan Jun had been injured and suppressed, so his true strength might not have been revealed.

White hair?

Surprise flashed in Jian Wushuangs eyes!

White hair wasn‚Äôt crucial; what mattered was the aura, surprisingly similar to his. Was the other person also in possession of a supreme physique? ‚ÄúInheritor!‚Äù The newly arrived Bai Junwangs eyes revealed greed.

The similarity in physical bodies made him instantly understand that the inheritor in front of him also possessed the supreme physique, even more perfect than he had imagined.

Bai Junwang looked up to the sky and laughed heartily, not hiding his greedy expression, ‚ÄúHeaven is truly helping me!‚Äù

A transcendent physique, a complete Dao ‚Äì once he took over this heir, he would become even stronger than he was now.

Currently, he relied on external forces. Although his physical body was perfect, and his origin source was comparable to the ultimate, it was still limited, only lasting for a short three days.

After seizing the inheritor, as the divine being had stated, he would gain everything from the inheritor, including the origin source, divine body, and even the physical body.

Standing on the side, Daoist Liuyang, upon seeing Bai Junwang, though not recognizing him, knew that a senior from the Shadow Sect had arrived.

‚ÄúI am Liuyang, the fourteenth generation of disciples of the Shadow Sect. I greet the senior!‚Äù Daoist Liuyang retracted his demonic transformation, resumed his original appearance, knelt on one knee, clasped his chest, and showed deep respect.

Bai Junwang wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in him; he just nodded and casually tossed a sack to him.

Inside were many treasures, but compared to Jian Wushuang, they were nothing.

If there were no such rules, Bai Junwang could easily kill him, saving a substantial amount of treasures for himself. Wouldn‚Äôt that be better for his future?

The difference lay right here.

Jian Wushuang watched everything, his eyes filled with despair.

Seeing the look in the other‚Äôs eyes, he knew there was no chance for a quick and painless death.

‚ÄúThis place is not suitable for a long stay. Follow me!‚Äù Bai Junwang stayed only for two or three breaths. He didn‚Äôt have much time to spare.

The retreat route had long been planned, and leaving now was the best option.

Along the way, they didn‚Äôt encounter any strong individuals from the Temple.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes slightly; this time, he was doomed!

At this moment, he let go of resentment, harboring no hatred towards others but blaming his own lack of strength.

He had to admit that his luck had been good enough, overcoming numerous difficulties and dangers to achieve his current success.

If he were to fall this time, so be it!

With his Heart power reaching the fifth level, he faced the situation more calmly than the Emperor.

One life, countless calamities!

This lifetime was sufficient, and if given another chance, he would spare no effort.

Just as despair engulfed him, a faint aura surged, reaching this place in an instant.

‚ÄúBai Junwang, you probably won‚Äôt be able to take him today!‚Äù

Bai Yi and Guangmu stepped forward side by side, surrounded by five tier 6 Emperors converging from all directions.

The five Emperors in black robes instantly erected a large array, enclosing them all.

Guangmu Tianzun roared in anger, his figure swelling, and his enormous eyes illuminating the heavens and earth.

Bai Yi, clad in silver armor, brandished a long knife that emitted a world- destroying aura.

Upon realizing they were surrounded, Liu Yang immediately panicked.

Bai Junwang also revealed a surprised look; he had failed to detect Bai Yi‚Äôs ambush, which was unexpected.

However, upon realizing that Bai Yi was only in his avatar form, he relaxed.

‚ÄúA mere law body, just as foolish as Wu Zuo.‚Äù As soon as he spoke, a fierce battle erupted.

Boom!

A vast black robe swept out, instantly engulfing him and Liu Yang.

Meanwhile, an earth- shattering battle unfolded in the outside world.

Bai Junwang, fighting against seven Emperors alone.

Among them, the strongest, Guangmu Tianzun, reached the pinnacle of strength. However, compared to Bai Junwang, he was still slightly weaker.

There was a significant disparity in origin source and divine body.

Bai Junwangs origin source had already dried up, and what he injected now was the origin source of myriad Daos. Simply put, it wasn‚Äôt his original source, diminishing his power with each use..
