Chapter 1129: The Potential to Be A ‘Leader’

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When he learned that the Sword World was about to open, Jian Wushuang immediately returned to the Green Fire Palace without hesitation.

After all, it only opened every hundred thousand years. If he missed the opportunity this time, he had to wait another hundred thousand years to enter it again.

On the way back to the Green Fire Palace, he received a message from Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long.

Dan Xin was indeed making fun of them.

Quite a few Celestial Masters from the two camps followed his instructions to mine Black Iron on that battlefield recklessly. Within a few days, someone had gathered five hundred thousand kilograms of Black Iron.

Nonetheless, when they handed the Black Iron to Dan Xin, he said whoever had cultivated for more than five hundred thousand years were not qualified to become the master of the Dan Xin Palace. Many Celestial Masters from the two camps had been outraged by this.

Each one of the Celestial Masters here had lived a long time. 90% of them had lived for more than millions of years and only a few had just lived for a hundred thousand years. As for people whose cultivation age did not exceed five hundred thousand years… There were few Celestial Masters in the two camps who met that condition.

In addition, Dan Xin also said that apart from that condition, the one who wanted to be the Dan Xin Palace’s master must possess great attainments on refining elixirs and have to pass the test of the Dan Xin Palace. All of a sudden, all the Celestial Masters from the two camps outside the Dan Xin Palace lost the qualification.

Those Celestial Masters had worked hard to mine the Black Iron, but they had no chance to give it a shot at last.

Naturally, they flew into a rage but could do nothing to Dan Xin.

They all knew Dan Xin was a complete lunatic.

He controlled the Dan Xin Palace, so they had to listen to what he had said.

In short, the battle for the Dan Xin Palace had calmed down and the Celestial Masters from the two camps had also left, leaving the Dan Xin Palace to stay where it was. The two camps had already sent some younger ones who possessed great attainments on refining elixirs here, but no one knew whether there was anyone who had become its master in the end.

In a lofty palace in the Jin Kingdom.

“Your Excellency, this is the information about Jian Wushuang from the Green Fire World.” A silver-robed man walked in.

“Information about Jian Wushuang? It finally comes!” A barefoot bald man stood at the center of the hall. He looked cold and had eyes like a hawk. He took the information with a wave of his hand and began to look through it carefully.

More than a decade ago, when Qu Yang sent Jian Wushuang’s name back to the Jin Kingdom, the senior officials of the Jin Kingdom already ordered people to investigate Jian Wushuang.

However, since the Jin Kingdom’s force in the Green Fire World was limited, their intelligence capabilities were naturally not so good. That was why the bald man just received the information about Jian Wushuang.

“Eh?” After he glanced over the intelligence about Jian Wushuang, his eyes turned cold.

“Jian Wushuang is from the Ancient World and is indeed an Eternal Realm expert. Since he was born, he has been cultivating for only more than two thousand years?” The bald man felt that it was incredible.

He could remain calm when learning that Jian Wushuang was only an Eternal Realm Expert, but when he saw his cultivation age, he was shocked.

“Two thousand years?”

“He killed nearly 20 Celestial Masters from my country in the battle of contending for Life Elixirs. He possesses the battle strength equivalent to that of a Celestial Master at the Exceptional Realm, but he has only cultivated for more than two thousand years?”

“He is so powerful now and if he is given another two thousand years or even 20,000 years, how mighty will he be?”

“Sunrise Sword Emperor is already a big headache for our country. Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang has greater potential than Sunrise Sword Emperor!”

This barefoot bald man roared.

The Jin Kingdom and the Green Fire Palace had fought with each other on this giant battlefield for five million years. The two sides had long been each other’s sworn enemy. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It seemed that the Jin Kingdom always had the absolute upper hand over so many years. In fact, be it the Jin Kingdom or the Green Fire Palace, they were clear that this situation would not last long. After all, the Jin Kingdom was an outsider who had no foundation on this battlefield.

However, the Green Fire Palace had the entire Green Fire World to support it. It was deeply rooted here and experts appeared continually. It was only a matter of time before it overtook the Jin Kingdom in strength.

However, the Jin Kingdom had one greatest advantage over the Green Fire Palace; it had a leader!

Its leader was its monarch, who was a supreme being in the Jin Kingdom and always kept his promises.

The Green Fire Palace, however, had never produced a “leader” that matched the monarch of the Jin Kingdom from its establishment till now.

The Jin Kingdom surely would exploit this advantage to the full. They did not expect the Green Fire Palace to have an expert that was likely to be a “leader”.

They had sensed a crisis the moment Jian Wushuang’s mother Ji Wumeng appeared many years ago. Therefore, when they learned that the Green Fire Palace was going to send her into the Samsara, they immediately dispatched a large number of experts to eliminate her. That was really a horrifying battle.

But in the end, she entered the Samsara.

This made the Jin Kingdom feel terribly uneasy because she was the first person who was qualified to be the “leader” of the Green Fire Palace.

But fortunately, they received the news that there was something bad happened during the process and Ji Wumeng failed to be the “leader” of the Green Fire Palace temporarily.

And the second person that upset the Jin Kingdom was Sunrise Sword Emperor.

Although he was just a Celestial Master presently, his battle strength matched that of a Universe Master. Precisely speaking, he was even a little bit powerful than an ordinary Universe Master. If he broke through to the Universe Master Level, he would possess the horrifying power to become the “leader” of the Green Fire Palace.

Moreover, he had fully grown up and it was extremely difficult for the Jin Kingdom to exterminate him in advance.

That was why the Jin Kingdom would have such a headache.

What was more terrible was that the barefoot bald man felt the same threat on Jian Wushuang, greater than the threat that Sunrise Sword Emperor posed to him.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor is indeed extraordinary, but he can only possess the battle strength to be a leader after he becomes a Universe Master. However, Jian Wushuang…”

“He is so mighty even at the Eternal Realm. When he becomes a Dao Master, he is supposed to match a common Universe Master. Once he integrates all his Sword Principles together and becomes a Celestial Master, he probably will possess the battle strength to be a leader. If he is lucky enough to become a Universe Master, maybe our monarch is no match for him, I am afraid.”
