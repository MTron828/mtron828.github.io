“Heaven Way is unfathomable. Furthermore, the deeper you dig into it, the more difficult it is to comprehend.”

“Jian Wushuang, you are only a Universe God after all, and you are only a Universe God in the Second Heaven. To be able to comprehend the third image of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation in three thousand years is already very impressive. You must know that an ordinary Real God might not even reach your level in three hundred thousand years or thirty thousand years, let alone three thousand years,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He knew that a Universe God was different from a Real God.

Once he reached the level of a Real God, it would be much easier to comprehend Heaven Way as compared to a Universe God.

A Universe God who could comprehend a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way was already considered a top genius. To a Real God, comprehending Power of Heaven Way was something common.

“Although it took me longer, I have reached this step regardless,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The step was referring to passing through the first level of Doctrine Palace!

Jian Wushuang, who had fully comprehended the third image of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation, had possessed the power to pass through the first level of Doctrine Palace.

In other words, his comprehension of Power of Heaven Way alone wasn’t any weaker than the four Kings’ in Sky Sword Prison. In terms of divine power, they were on the same level as well due to the fact that Real Gods were restricted.

Then, compared to the four Kings, he reckoned their only difference was their created unique skills.

Jian Wushuang was only a Universe God in the Second Heaven after all. The highest limit that he could reach was to create a beginner Real God unique skill. However, it was different for Real God. The unique skills created by the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison were much stronger.

“I am definitely weaker in terms of unique skill. However, I have many trump cards and techniques. On top of that, my divine body is strong. It should be sufficient to fight against Blood Emperor.”

“If so… I can began my massacre plan very soon.”

There was light shimmering in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Over the years, he had been wandering in Fiery Prison for training and never once left because of the threatening existence of Blood Emperor.

He never had the confidence to fight Blood Emperor, which led to a temporary hold on his massacre plan.

However, it was different then.

On that day, Jian Wushuang had found Fiery King.

“You’re ready to leave Fiery Prison? Where do you intend to go? To wander around and hunt down experts?” Fiery King looked at Jian Wushuang.

“No, I do not intend to wander around. I plan to head over to Darkness Mountain directly.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Darkness Mountain, Blood Emperor’s enemy’s nest?” Fiery King’s face grew solemn as he looked at Jian Wushuang, “You seem to be confident in dealing with Blood Emperor?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang smiled, “In Sky Sword Prison, there shouldn’t be anyone who has the power to kill me. Not even Fiery King yourself, I’m afraid.”

“Oh, so confident?” Fiery King raised his eyebrows, “If so, I will not say more. You already have my communication token. If you run into any trouble in Darkness Mountain, send me a message.”

“‘Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, he immediately departed.

Fiery King looked at Jian Wushuang’s shadow and sighed with emotion.

“Three thousand years ago, when this boy fought Blood Emperor, it was difficult for him to stay alive by giving his all. But today, three thousand years later, he is so confident that he can stay alive before Blood Emperor and even me. Tsk tsk, his speed of improvement is terrifyingly fast.”

“My Lineage of Scarlet has an impressive young man. I hope that this young man stands a chance to leave Sky Sword Prison.

…

Sky Sword Prison, Darkness Mountain.

It had been three thousand years since Jian Wushuang last came to Darkness Mountain, which was Blood Emperor’s territory.

In the void above all rolling hills, Jian Wushuang in a crimson robe, carrying a sword behind him, was walking forward slowly.

“Three thousand years ago, Blood Emperor and the experts under his command drove me to a miserable corner. I hid in the cave dwelling underground for a hundred years but didn’t dare to pop up. In the end, he even asked Heartless King to look for me. If it wasn’t for Fiery King’s arrival, even if I could have escaped Blood Emperor and Heartless King’s chase, I could only have found a place to hide again.”

“Hehe, the debt from three thousand years ago, Jian Wushuang is coming to take revenge today!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold and his Soul Power spread across wantonly.

In two days, Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power detected an expert’s existence.

“Universe God?”

Jian Wushuang towering in the void and he could clearly feel an expert in a cave dwelling in a mountain afar with his Soul Power.

The expert was just a Universe God and he was only on the third level.

“Although this Universe God has good defense power, it’s a piece of cake for me to kill him with my current power. However… He’s only a Universe God. Even if I killed him, it won’t be of much help to me,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and left.

He was also only a Universe God. The criteria for him to leave Sky Sword Prison was that he either kill a hundred Universe Gods or kill ten Real Gods.

If it were like before, when Jian Wushuang had not had enough power, he could only figure out a way to kill a hundred Universe Gods in order to bail himself out from Sky Sword Prison.

But now, he had absolute power and he was leaning towards the latter option.

“Killing one Real God is equal to killing ten Universe Gods, it is obviously a worthy choice.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and continued to search through Darkness Mountain.

His Soul Power was a great advantage that he had. Taking advantage of his Soul Power, it was too easy for him to find those experts in Darkness Mountain.

In a few days time, Jian Wushuang had found a Real God. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Real God Huo Yuan, on the third level in Sky Sword Prison, a Real God that has yet to grasp Heaven Way. Plus, he is an expert under Blood Emperor’s command. Three thousand years ago, he was among the Real Gods who were searching for me within the one million miles range.”

Jian Wushuang smirked coldly and instantly plunged towards the marsh where Real God Huo Yuan was at.

In the huge marshland that was up to a hundred miles wide, Real God Huo Yuan had opened up a cave dwelling below the marshland. Over the years, Real God Huo Yuan had been staying there.

It was a beautiful cave dwelling. It was spacious and there were various decorations. They were all brought in from outside the prison by Real God Huo Yuan himself. It was rather luxuriantly decorated.

On an exquisite stone bed in the middle of the cave dwelling, Real God Huo Yuan was lying casually with wine and food by his side.

All that was missing were a few beauties and maidservants serving him. If he had that too, no one would have been able to tell that he was a prisoner.
