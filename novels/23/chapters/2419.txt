Chapter 2420: Found Him

The core disciple quickly went back to his investigation.

Investigating the few sects that arrived first at the inner area was so much easier than simply investigating who passed the trial.

The core disciple once again appeared in front of Pang Tao after only half a day.

The core disciple said, “Senior Brother Pang Tao, I have the results. Among the numerous sects from Wusha Wilderness, three sects that first arrived at the inner area were Demonic Moon Sect, Heavenly Feather Sect, and Narcissus Island. They were the ones who arrived at the earliest. As for who among them arrived first, it’s undetermined.”

“Just these three?” Pang Tao squinted.

“Of these three, Heavenly Feather Sect could be immediately ruled out. After all, they are a weak sect and there are only three disciples listed to enter Saint’s Tomb. I received accurate intelligence that none of their three disciples are gifted in swordsmanship,” said the core disciple.

“Uh-huh.” Pang Tao nodded slightly.

The eighth trial bridge was a test specifically designed for swordsmanship. If they did not even have a disciple who was good at it, Heavenly Feather Sect would naturally not have anyone who could pass the trial.

“But the Demonic Moon Sect is a big sect. There are eight disciples who came into Saint’s Tomb. Moreover, there are two among the eight of them who are good at swords. I have information about these two people as well, one of them is the Demonic Moon Sect’s number one genius, Yao Xuan. As for the second one, he is only a normal talented disciple. Although he is a Second-Class Divine Demon, his sword principle understanding is rather low. I heard he is only at Merit in sword principles, and his sword skills are also quite mediocre. Probably not the person who could pass the test at the eighth trial bridge,” said the core disciple.

“Hmph, Merit in sword principles? Of course, he can’t pass. Even Yao Huan, who is the number one genius of the Demonic Moon Sect, can’t pass the trial. Let alone him.” Pang Tao sneered in disdain.

He knew about Yao Huan and they even crossed hands before. At that time, he was fighting against Yao Huan who was collaborating with two other First-Class Divine Demons.

Even when fighting three of them altogether, Pang Tao still crushed them.

In terms of swordsmanship, Yao Huan could only be considered as good. However, it would be a fantasy if he wanted to break through the sword principles trial on the eighth trial bridge.

“Narcissus Island is the only one left since we have ruled out those two sects. Narcissus Island is qualified to be one of the top ten grand sects in Wusha Wilderness. Is there anyone who is good at swords and has a really high comprehensive ability towards sword principles among their disciples?” Pang Tao asked.

However, the core disciple frowned upon that question. “Senior Brother Pang Tao, according to my intelligence, Yao Huan from Demonic Moon Sect is the only one possible to pass the trial bridge’s challenge among all three sects. There shouldn’t be anyone else. As for Narcissus Island... They have ten disciples who entered Saint’s Tomb like before, but there’s only one who is good at swords and most importantly, that person is merely in the Chaotic Realm.”

Pang Tao was slightly surprised. “Chaotic Realm? You’re saying that among the ten Narcissus Island disciples, there is a person in the Chaotic Realm who is good at swords?”

“Correct. But it’s impossible for a person in Chaotic Realm to break through the challenge on the eighth trial bridge,” said the core disciple.

“Impossible? How do you know it’s impossible? Do you know his level of understanding of sword principles?” Pang Tao looked over.

“Well. I actually don’t know, but his realm...”

Before he could finish, Pang Tao cut him off and said, “Being in his current cultivation does mean that his abilities are weak. However, the tests in the Trial Abyss do not emphasize on your cultivation level.”

Pang Tao paused when he reached that part of the sentence, his eyes glowing with an odd expression. “Chaotic Realm. A Chaotic Realm person from Narcissus Island. Wouldn’t he be...”

Pang Tao’s face changed as he suddenly recalled someone.

“Do you have any information about that Chaotic Realm guy? For example, his real name or his status on Narcissus island,” asked Pang Tao immediately.

“That isn’t clear for now, but I can go ask,” said the core disciple.

“Go ask immediately.” Pang Tao pushed him.

The core disciple held a token in his hand and immediately sent a message to the Great Compassion Sect’s intelligence department outside.

The Great Compassion Sect was the top sect in Wusha Wilderness. Having a foundation generations old, their intelligence gathering ability was also the strongest in Wusha Wilderness.

They had been keeping a close eye on grand sects like Narcissus Island, sects that are qualified to be in the top ten list.

If an incredible genius came out of Narcissus Island, the Great Compassion Sect would know everything about him. They even have detailed information about each core disciple from Narcissus Island.

Though, the Great Compassion Sect did not show much interest toward the outer disciples.

However, due to Elder Wujian, Jian Wushuang was a rather special Narcissus Island outer disciple, hence the Great Compassion Sect had taken note of him.

Besides, there were already instructions from the superiors in the Great Compassion Sect early on to keep a close eye on him.

Hence, they found his information with just a slight search.

The core disciple looked over at Pang Tao. “Senior Brother Pang Tao, I’ve found him. The Chaotic Realm disciple from Narcissus Island who entered Saint’s Tomb this time is called Jian Wushuang. According to what we know, he is only an outer disciple. There is an elder on Narcissus Island who looks highly upon him. It’s due to this elder that he could enter the tomb.”

“Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang?”

Pang Tao recited his name repeatedly, the glow in his eyes became extremely sharp.

“Indeed It’s him. It’s this Jian Wushuang!”

“Senior Brother Pang Tao, you’re saying that the guy who passed the eighth trial bridge is this Jian Wushuang? How is that possible?” The core disciple was in slight disbelief.

A mere Chaotic Realm disciple, who was only an outer disciple. An absolutely insignificant person—and he passed the challenge that countless swordsmanship geniuses failed to breakthrough?

“Hmph, I can’t guarantee if it’s some other people. But if it’s him, I can be sure that he is the one who passed the challenge on the eighth trial bridge. After all, this Jian Wushuang had almost become my master’s second personal disciple,” said Pang Tao coldly.

The core disciple was completely dumbfounded upon hearing that.

Did Pang Tao just mention his master?

Who was his master?

He was one of the Grand Elders of the Great Compassion Sect, and the widely renowned number one sword cultivator in Wusha Wilderness at the same time, Fan Jianxian!

That Jian Wushuang almost became Fan Jianxian’s personal disciple? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

How was that possible?

Besides, if he was that capable, why was he only an outer disciple on Narcissus Island?

Regardless of how doubtful the core disciple was, Pang Tao had decided it was him.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve heard so much about you from Master early on. I didn’t expect you to show up in Saint’s Tomb and pass the challenge on the eighth trial bridge,” murmured Pang Tao with his eyes glowing frostily.
