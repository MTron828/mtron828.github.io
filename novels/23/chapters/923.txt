Chapter 924: Jian Wushuang Against Xia Mang

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang’s towering size burned with wrath following his thunderous roar.

“He joined the fight! He joined the fight!”

“This is a battle of certain doom! How is it possible that he agrees to join the fight! What courage!”

“Is that folly, or does he indeed wields strength enough to defeat his opponent?”

Cries and yelling drowned over the incessant chatters rising from the spectator’s stand of the arena.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang appeared to accept his challenge, Xia Mang smiled maliciously. He flicked his wrist. A blood-red glove appeared out of nowhere, worn over his hand.

The glove exuded an aura of intense bloodthirstiness and malice, a clear sign that it was a strong and potent Emperor Weapon.

This appearance of the glove itself roused the fear of everyone present.

Many of the spectators present noted that Xia Mang had not used his glove when he defeated Li Tianchou.

“It seems that Xia Mang is thirsty for blood.”

The spectators braced themselves for a gruesome and terrible fight, some of them even began to fear for Jian Wushuang.

Xia Mang was the greatest warrior of the Eternal Realm in the lands of the Eternal World. Even the invincible Li Tianchou was defeated by him without any apparent effort. It was widely believed that no other warrior of the same realm would be equal to Xia Mang.

Xia Mang clenched tightly his gloved fists and instantly, the fabric of Space of the air around it began to crack and tear!

With a stare filled with hate and malice, Xia Mang looked at Jian Wushuang. “I will let you realize, Jian Wushuang, the differences between you and me!”

“Let the fight begin.” Jian Wushuang voiced rumbled as he replied coldly, his arms crossed at his front.

Xia Mang giggled wickedly and disappeared into thin air even before his laughter ended, appearing behind Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

“Such a speed!” The audience all gasped with amazement.

“Such a speed indeed…” Even Li Tianchou himself could hardly hide his bewilderment.

Xia Mang had not displayed the full extent of his quickness in his battle against Li Tianchou. What he had now shown was the agility and pace which none of the Eternal Realm could rival.

“Whoosh!”?A huge wave of air swept across the arena into the spectators’ stands.

Xia Mang appeared before Jian Wushuang, his cold and deathly eyes gleaming hungrily. Without allowing his opponent any chance to react, he struck at where Jian Wushuang stood immediately with his gloved fist!

“The Earth-Shattering stroke!”

Xia Mang bellowed loudly.

His fist slammed forth with terrifying destructiveness that even the air trembled.

The fabric of Space crumbled before the tremendous force of his stroke. The aura of his blow passed through the distortion caused to the rupture in the continuum of Space, growing rapidly into the size of a huge mountain; a blood-red mountain of Death!

The huge blood-red mound sped directly at Jian Wushuang, threatening to slam into him with a force sufficient to decimate all lives!

The overwhelming power of the aura from Xia Mang’s stroke tore through the air, ripping the surrounding Space into shreds as it began to crackle and snap.

The spectators at the stands all beheld the spectacle fearfully with their breaths held, watching blankly at what was to come.

To them of the common masses, this should not even be possible with one of the Eternal Realm!

“Does Xia Mang intend to kill Jian Wushuang in one stroke?”

“One stroke?”

“It may be possible with so powerful and terrible a stroke.”

The crowd now began to mutter and whisper anxiously.

But Jian Wushuang was still looking calm and collected, clearly unfazed by the tide of Death rolling towards him!

He could feel the pressure crashing into him face-first from the lumbering aura in the form of a blood-red mound rushing towards him. It was a strength almost impossible and yet immensely powerful for one of the Eternal Realm.

But this was hardly anything in the eyes of Jian Wushuang.

With everyone staring at him, Jian Wushuang moved.

He lowered himself into a Horse Stance and channeled all the might he could muster into his right fist.

This startled everyone who was watching him.

“H-he… he’s not drawing his sword?”

“He carries a longsword. He should most likely be a cultivator of swordsmanship. But why is he not drawing his sword to defend himself?”

“What is he doing? Is he thinking of fighting against Xia Mang with only his fists?”

“Is he mad? Or is he giving up, knowing that his end is inevitable?”

“Clearly Xia Mang has given his all by using his magical weapon! He even used his most powerful secret technique! And yet, Jian Wushuang chose to fight against him bare-handed? This is courting death!”

“He is mad!”

The bystanders around Jian Wushuang all believed that he was either driven mad or he had committed a serious blunder.

But in truth, Jian Wushuang was as tranquil as a still lake.

“A mere warrior of the Eternal Realm does not require me to draw my sword!”

Jian Wushuang screamed within himself with rage. He clenched his fist tightly, concentrating his powers and readied himself to retaliate.

In his fist, Jian Wushuang had accumulated the huge and terrifying powers produced by his methods of Inverse Cultivation – that allowed him greater power than that of his current level – which were increased by seventy-two fold with the use of the Twenty-forth Level of the Star-river Secret Skill!

The methods of Inverse Cultivation alone had bestowed upon Jian Wushuang strength and power far beyond that of the Eternal Realm, yet, he had also used the Star-river Secret Skill to further enhance its yield by seventy-two fold!

Seventy-two fold… The powers he wielded were truly unfathomable…

“I have something I have been waiting to tell you, Xia Mang.” Jian Wushuang wore a solemn expression as he looked at his opponent through the distorted anomaly between them.

“Ah?” Standing behind the huge blood-red mound of auric energies, Xia Mang was indeed surprised by Jian Wushuang’s sudden remark.

“You have always been widely acclaimed as the strongest warrior of the Eternal Realm in the domain of the Eternal World. But to me, you are nothing but a mere mockery of your pitiful self.”

“Worthless and puny!”

Jian Wushuang’s boomed loudly across the arena. At the same time, he punched with his fists forward, unleashing the astounding force that he had held in his fist.

Bang!

He drove his fist forward, creating a huge spiraling corkscrew of raging winds that immediately dispelled everything in its path.

With only sheer might, Jian Wushuang had shown that he required no secret techniques or any methods to defeat his foe.

It was a punch that fully demonstrated his power which was already close to that of a Dao Master!

With no need of drawing his sword or the use of any secret techniques, Jian Wushuang had shown to the world that he possessed the strength of a Dao Master!

And his single blow had fully illustrated how easily he could defeat his foe.

“Down you go!” Jian Wushuang roared.

“RUMBLE!”?The gigantic blood-red mound of auric energies shook and began to crumble, disintegrating instantly once it hit Jian Wushuang’s fist.

But his stroke was far from ending. The auric blow from his punch, after reducing the huge blood-red mound into nothingness, shot straight at Xia Mang and blasted directly into his outstretched palm which was wearing the blood-red glove.

Bang!

Then a loud crack like a smashing sledgehammer reached their ears of everyone around immediately, followed by the subtle, terrifying sounds of cracking bones.

“How is it possible?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Xia Mang’s eyes widened with shock and disbelief as he looked at his right hand.

His hand was completely mangled. The bones of his hand to his arm have all been utterly crushed by the shock of the blast which did not stop at that, instead, the impact was transmitted to all parts of his body.
