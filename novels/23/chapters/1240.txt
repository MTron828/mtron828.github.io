“No!!! ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The remaining Jin Kingdom Universe Masters on the entire battlefield were all caught in an unprecedented horror.

Jian Wushuang’s move was terrifying.

He used only one move to kill all their Celestial Masters.

Although for the Jin Kingdom, Universe Masters were their pillars. However, after the war, when they started to search for treasures on this battlefield, they would need a large number of Celestial Masters. But now, the Celestial Masters had all been wiped out!

How could they stay calm?

And what was more horrifying was Jian Wushuang’s incredible skill!

Contrary to the Jin Kingdom, the Green Fire World rejoiced over the massacre.

2,000 Celestial Masters had been killed in an instant!

One must know that only less than 2,00 Green Fire World Celestial Masters remained. They had been using Battle Formations to make up for their strength gaps. But now, all Jin Kingdom Celestial Masters were dead!

This alone pulled back the Green Fire World from the crisis of destruction!

In this ultimate battle, they finally saw the Stroke of Dawn!

“Shuanger!” Jian Nantian clasped his hands firmly and his eyes sparkled with unprecedented surprises.

One must know that the one launched the overwhelming move was his son!!!

“Jian Wushuang!”

Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao, Xue Lingtian, ??Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou all became excited again.

They knew that Jian Wushuang would never let them down.

Above the Void, Jian Wushuang hovered, emotionlessly.

He just slaughtered so many Jin Kingdom Celestial Masters but did not feel pity at all.

As he said before, all Jin Kingdom experts must die!

Gu King inside his body secretly admired. “It’s a Soul Outclass. Under normal circumstances, only the founder of the Star Bloodline and King Luo Zhen can use the skill. He actually utilized it when he’s only a Universe Master.”

“What an Inverse Cultivator!”

“He’s ignited the Fire of Soul as a Dao Master. Incredible! If he keeps improving his Soul Power, in the future, when he reaches the level of the founder of the Star Bloodline and King Luo Zhen, how strong will his Soul Power be?”

“Formidable!”

“A formidable Inverse Cultivator!”

Gu King knew very well how demanding Jian Wushuang’s previous move was.

However, being an Inverse Cultivator, Jian Wushuang ignited the Soul Power as a Dao Master and managed to exert that skill as a Universe Master.

And this skill had directly wiped out all the Jin Kingdom Celestial Masters on the battlefield!

In an instant, the situation completely changed.

Of course, although the situation had been reversed, it did not mean the Green Fire World was already safe.

After all, Jian Wushuang only killed the Jin Kingdom Celestial Masters. Their Universe Masters and the supreme monarch remained intact.

Swoosh!

Under the eyes of everyone, Jian Wushuang dashed and crossed over a half of the battlefield. Then, he appeared in front of the Jin Kingdom monarch.

“Jin Kingdom monarch!” Jian Wushuang sounded cold.

“Jian Wushuang!” Likewise, the Jin Kingdom monarch’s eyes flashed with coldness.

Just now, the Jin Kingdom monarch saw Jian Wushuang and did not pay much attention, because he thought it would not change anything even if he had broken through.

However, in a short period of time, Jian Wushuang proved him wrong: He alone was able to change the situation.

“Humph!”

The Jin Kingdom monarch snorted, in his eyes, there was immense killing intent. And at the next moment, he moved.

A harsh wind-breaking sound rang. The Jin Kingdom monarch showed up in front of Jian Wushuang. The black spear held by him took on a dark glow and overwhelming strong power. It rushed toward Jian Wushuang’s chest.

Splash… It pierced through the Void; a hole that covered a range of thousands of miles formed.

At the core of this big hole, a streak of bright black light rose up.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang squinted and did not draw a sword or perform any swordsmanship to resist.

Just when the black Flowing Light was less than one meter away from him, he finally lifted his hand.

He caught the Flowing light with his mighty right hand.

Boom!

The power that could easily wipe out a Universe Master burst out. But Jian Wushuang still clenched the streak of light in his palm. He did not release his hands until the power in the Flowing Light completely dissipated.

“What?”

Even the Jin Kingdom monarch was shocked.

Jian Wushuang dared to resist his attack bare-handed?

And he actually succeeded!

“Jin Kingdom monarch!”

Jian Wushuang hovered, still expressionlessly. He was still holding the black longspear.

“Being the head of a country and leading so many Universe Masters and Celestial Masters, you must be better than this!”

“Get all your strengths out, or it will be dull to beat you.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice spread slowly.

At the moment he finished, he flicked his wrists. Then, the Jin Kingdom monarch took a few steps back.

After regaining his stance, the Jin Kingdom once again looked at Jian Wushuang with a more serious manner.

“Jian Wushuang.” The Jin Kingdom monarch spoke slowly.

“I’ve seen your potential before and know you’re very promising, and might pose a threat to me. Now, I still underestimated you.”

“I regret it.”

“Regret?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“I regret that, when you wanted to destroy my Enduring Samsara Formation, I didn’t wipe you out at all costs. You actually escaped twice from me!” The Jin Kingdom monarch sounded cold. “If I’ve killed you at all costs, then it would not be so hard to raze the Green Fire World to the ground.”

“But now…”

The Jin Kingdom monarch looked around and wore a terrible face.

When the Jin Kingdom first arrived on the battlefield, they had mighty combat power and numerous experts.

After the last round of battle, especially after Jian Wushuang’s horrifying move, in addition to him, only dozens of Universe Masters survived.

If he wanted to occupy such a large battlefield with so few people, he would be lunatic.

“The Jin Kingdom has lost the battle!”

The Jin Kingdom monarch clasped his hands tightly, and although he was extremely unwilling, he had to admit it.

With their current combat power, it would be unrealistic to occupy a huge battlefield like this, let alone wipe the Green Fire World off the face of the earth…
