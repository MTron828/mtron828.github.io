Chapter 1185: Pre-emptive Strike

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The expression on Jian Wushuang’s face turned exceptionally ugly after he heard what the Samsara Temple Master had to say.

“Jian Wushuang, if what the Temple Master says is true, then the Green Fire Palace alone would be hard pressed to withstand the main body of the Gold Kingdom,” the Gu King’s voice rang out in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“No one in the Green Fire Palace is a match for the monarch of the Gold Kingdom. Just him alone could destroy all the experts in the Palace.”

Jian Wushuang’s figure trembled.

“The Samsara Temple Master’s right. This drastic turn of events would decide the survival of the entire Green Fire World.”

“Is there really no way for the Green Fire World to resist, everyone?” Jian Wushuang asked in a low tone.

“A way to resist? Of course, there is,” replied the Samsara Temple Master in a chilly tone. “Five million years ago, then the experts of the Gold Kingdom came upon our land, and their combined might was much more than ours on paper. We gathered every able soul in the Green Fire World and managed to hold their attack off.”

“Even though the situation this time is much more critical than the previous one, we still have a chance of survival. We need to work together, and if the entire Green Fire World unites, we still have a hope of surviving this crisis.”

The Temple Master’s speech led a few who were present to nod.

The experts who were gathered presently represented the upper echelon of the Green Fire World’s combatants, and if even they had no confidence of winning, then the entire Green Fire World would have scant hope of surviving the onslaught of their enemies.

“The spaceship carrying the main body of the Gold Kingdom is still within the portal. The Green Fire Palace will set up a huge formation of experts there and they will do everything in their power to hold up its advance. Even though they can’t possibly hope to stop it, they can delay it’s advance for at least dozens of years—maybe even for centuries. This will buy us some precious time to prepare,” said the Samsara Temple Master in a low tone.

“In addition, I’ve also come up with a plan after discussing with a few Palace Masters. I’ve called you over, Jian Wushuang, in hopes that you’ll take part in it.”

“Plan? What plan?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“The plan is for us to strike pre-emptively before the main body of the Gold Kingdom even arrives. We’ll wipe out all of their remaining power and foundations left behind by the Gold Kingdom from this battlefield!” the Samsara Temple Master said in an icy tone.

“Pre-emptive strike?” Jian Wushuang was shocked at first but soon nodded solemnly in agreement as well.

Indeed, if the main body of the Gold Kingdom could link up with their experts wandering in the battlefield and make use of the foundations set up by them, there would be no way of stopping them.

If all those foundations were destroyed, however, it would inconvenience the main body when it struck.

Just by destroying all the space wormholes, those special pockets of land that were controlled by the Gold Kingdom, scattered all over the battlefield would seriously limit their movement.

“The plan is sound, but it will not be easy to implement.”

“Even though many experts from the Gold Kingdom who remained behind on this battlefield have been killed in fights with our Green Fire Palace, there are still quite a few strong ones left. There are even a few Universe Masters from the Gold Kingdom here, and their strength is much greater than our own experts,” said Jian Wushuang solemnly.

“Furthermore, the Gold Kingdom has even set up a base on this battlefield and placed many restrictive Formations on it. If we wish to completely remove all of their foundations, we have to charge right into their base. How hard do you suppose that will be?”

“We’ve discussed all these concerns of yours previously,” the Tang Emperor said, “The combined might of the Gold Kingdom that is currently in this battlefield is indeed no weaker than us, if not stronger. That, however, was when we were still not willing to fight to the death.”

“Jian Wushuang, you think too little of the Green Fire Palace. We’ve been existing on this battlefield for more than 40 million years. How could the Gold Kingdom’s history of a mere five million years compare to ours?”

“Placing other matters aside, just the battle strength of our Universe Masters itself is already much stronger than that of the Gold Kingdom!”

“What?” Jiang Wushuang asked in surprise.

He knew that the Gold Kingdom had nine great Universe Masters in the past, and also peak Universe Master level experts like the Red Snow King.

“The Green Fire Palace, on the other hand, only had five Universe Masters, so how could the Tang Emperor claim that their battle strength was higher than that of the Gold Kingdom?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Look, Jian Wushuang,” said the Void Temple Master with a laugh. He then waved, and a man wearing a scarlet suit of armor appeared.

“And this is?” Jian Wushuang said as he looked in surprise at the man in scarlet armor. He then immediately realized the figure’s identity.

“A Puppet Fighter?” Jian Wushuang asked, getting excited. “And a puppet fighter at Universe Master level to boot?”

“Yes, this is a Puppet Fighter at Universe Master level,” replied the Void Temple Master with a faint smile. “The Green Fire Palace has exactly five of such Puppet Fighters.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes immediately lit up.

He could sense that the Puppet Fighter only possessed the battle strength of an ordinary Puppet Fighter.

Compared to Fu Yi, the Puppet Fighter at peak Universe Master level he obtained from the Star Island, it was much less capable.

Even so, it meant that the Green Fire Palace had the addition of an equivalent to five Universe Masters to their ranks.

“The battle strength of the Universe Masters of the Green Fire Palace has always been stronger than that of the Gold Kingdom. Furthermore, Heaven Shadow King was killed in the process of chasing after you. We also killed one of their Universe Masters by using the Celestial Master Golden Axe as bait. This resulted in the battle strength of our Universe Masters being much more than theirs.”

“As for those Formations in their base, we’ll find a way to break them!” said the Samsara Temple Master with a chilling laugh, “Before, we did not have much confidence to completely eradicate all influence of the Gold Kingdom from this battlefield and had held ourselves back; we didn’t dare to openly declare war.”

“Now, however, in such a time of crisis, even if we aren’t completely sure of ourselves, we have to act!”

“The Gold Kingdom has forced our hand!”

“Before the main body of the Gold Kingdom descends upon us, we have to find a way to get rid of their remnant forces in this battlefield. We have to destroy all of their remaining experts and even the foundations left behind by them!”

The desire to kill of everyone present was roused to a fervor by the Temple Master’s speech.

None of them would hold back when faced with such a hated enemy as the forces of the Gold Kingdom.

“This time, we only have one chance to accomplish our objectives. We can’t allow the Gold Kingdom any time to react. As such, we have to give it our best shot. Jian Wushuang, you’re a Green Fire Palace Master and possess Universe Master battle strength. You should join us,” the Samsara Temple Master said as he gazed at Jian Wushuang.

“No problem,” replied Jian Wushuang with a solemn nod. He gripped his palms tightly as well.

None of the Palace Masters, including Jian Wushuang, needed much time to prepare. Very shortly, they set off for their destination.
