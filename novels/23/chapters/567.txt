“Haha, Brother Wushuang.”

Laughter rang out. Qing Huo had initially walked out, having left the East Camp one month ago, but he hurriedly returned after he received the news that monster spies appeared around their tribe.

Wu Yuan and the other elders followed him.

Jian Wushuang looked at those around him and spoke with a smile on his face. “Qing Huo, Leader Wu Yuan, and everyone.”

A childish voice was then heard, saying, “Big Brother Wushuang.”

It was Wu Yu, and she stared at Jian Wushuang, looking delighted and surprised.

Qing Hu beside her looked at this young man with admiration.

“Little Yu. Qing Hu.” Jian Wushuang said hello to them while patting the girl’s head.

Then he said, “Leader Wu Yuan, Qing Huo, let’s go talk inside.”

“Sure.” Qing Huo nodded and walked toward their meeting tent, accompanied by his clansmen.

Jian Wushuang sat down with Qing Huo, Wu Yuan, and the elders while the other clansmen, including Wu Yu and Qing Hu, waited outside.

“Brother Wushuang, it’s good that you’ve come back. Now that we have a Divine Emperor’s protection, those monster spies won’t dare to offend us,” Qing Huo said with confidence.

Wu Yuan and the others nodded in agreement.

They had been worried that those monster spies would attack them. As their tribe had only one First-grade Divine General, they were unable to resist them. However, things had changed after the arrival of Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t worry. The target of those monster spies is not any human experts, but me. Since their plan has failed, they should have left. Even if they haven’t left, they won’t show up again,” Jian Wushuang said.

Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang with a frown. “Brother Wushuang, do you mean that those monster spies came for you?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then told them about his experience on the road.

Qing Huo, Wu Yuan, and the others were petrified when they learned that this Divine Emperor had been ambushed by a Monster King and eight Rank Nine Monsters.

“Fortunately, Temple Master Black Spirit showed up, or I might have been killed,” Jian Wushuang said in a relaxed tone.

Qing Huo began to blame himself. “It’s my fault. I was just thinking of sending a message to ask for your help, but I didn’t consider what their purpose was and almost put you in danger.”

“Qing Huo, you don’t have to think like that. I’ve stayed in the Wu Yan Tribe and can be regarded as one of your clansmen. If the Wu Yan Tribe gets into trouble, I should be the first one to arrive,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Qing Huo and Wu Yuan were gratified by his response.

“Temple Master Black Spirit asked me to visit her after I return to the Holy Place and she wanted to inquire about something, so I can’t stay long.” Jian Wushuang continued, “I’ll be here for two days. If those monster spies remain here, I’ll kill them all. And if they have disappeared, I’ll leave.”

“OK, that’s good.” Wu Yuan nodded.

“Hmm, Temple Master Black Spirit is the backbone of our human population. Indeed, we can’t make her wait long.” Qing Huo nodded.

“Oh, right.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and took out a few Jade Slips. “Leader, these are Level Seven and Level Eight Bone Fusion Technique manuals that I got from our league. I do have Level Nine and Level Ten manuals, but the league set a rule that manuals at Level Nine and above are not allowed to spread out, so I’m only able to give you two levels of manuals.”

“Level Seven and Level Eight?” Wu Yuan’s eyes became fervent as he said, “That’s enough, that’s enough.”

“Level Seven and Level Eight. Wow, I’ve just reached Level Six,” Qing Huo responded with surprise and delight. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Regarding Level Nine and Level Ten, they already knew about the rules of the Monster-exterminating League.

The Level Nine and above manuals, which belonged to the second volume of Bone Fusion Technique, were very precious, so it was forbidden to spread them out. Even experts from the Monster-exterminating League who had paid Monster Cores for them were unable to give those manuals to anyone else.

Over the next two days, Jian Wushuang remained with the tribe. Sometimes he played tricks on Wu Yu, and sometimes he gave Qing Hu some guidance.

As the first young man in this tribe, Qing Hu was talented. Jian Wushuang thought that this young man would probably be a Divine General and might become a Divine Emperor if he was lucky.

As Jian Wushuang expected, the monster spies who had shown up around the Wu Yan Tribe had disappeared, though he did not know whether they had left or were hiding somewhere.

Jian Wushuang only knew that since those spies appeared, they would not hide for long, because a Divine General Guard led by a Divine Emperor had come here and they were looking for monster spies on a massive scale. And once they found them, those spies would be killed without a doubt.

Calm was restored in the tribe.

Now, Jian Wushuang was about to leave for the Holy Place and numerous clansmen saw him off.

“Qing Huo, how long have you been a First-grade Divine General?” Jian Wushuang walked with Qing Huo as he spoke.

“It’s been a long time.” Qing Huo sighed. “I’m not sure if I can ever be a Second-grade Divine General in my lifetime.”

“You will be.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, took out an Interspatial Ring, and gave it to Qing Huo. “There are several Monster Cores inside this. It’s enough for you to spend several days on the third floor of Earth Core Palace. It won’t be difficult for you to make a breakthrough during that time.”

“Brother Wushuang, this is...” Qing Huo hesitated.

“Take it. You know that I’m an outsider, so I don’t know whether or not I can return to the tribe. You’re the only pillar of this tribe and should get stronger,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Qing Huo breathed deeply as he took the Interspatial Ring.

“Thank you,” Qing Huo said with gratitude.

“OK, goodbye everyone.” Jian Wushuang turned around and clasped his hands toward those clansmen when he arrived at the tribe’s gate. Then, he left. Wu Yu’s childish voice was heard once again.

“Big Brother Wushuang, I wish you all the best!”
