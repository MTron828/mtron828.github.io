Chapter 1532: Three Tests, Three Chances!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Real God Wu Bei’s voice reverberated in the third level in the cave and the one hundred thousand Universe Gods in the open ground were shocked.

Among them, some heaved a sigh of relief.

These were those who had gotten White Blaze Fruits in the first and second level of the cave. Then, with all Universe Gods gathered together, they would be besieged by a large crowd of Universe God if massacres were to be permitted.

Luckily, massacres were prohibited in the third level.

In the void, Real God Wu Bei’s voice continued.

“On the third level of the cave, there’s no fights nor massacres, only three tests.”

“The one with the most outstanding performance among the three tests would receive a chance and the chance naturally means a White Blaze Fruit Tree.”

The Universe Gods on the open ground were in tumult.

“Test?”

“Three tests?”

“I wonder what the context of the test will be.”

As the Universe Gods were talking among themselves, Universe God Liu Ying lowered his voice and asked, “Real God Wu Bei, do you mean the final chance will be decided according to our overall performance in the three tests?”

“No, no…” Real God Wu Bei shook his head, “You misunderstood me. I mean, there will be three tests and the one who performs the best in every test will receive one chance. In other words, three tests and three chances. Naturally, there are three White Blaze Fruit Trees.”

“What?” The Universe Gods on the open ground were stunned.

“Three White Blaze Fruit Trees?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes opened in surprise.

In the lofty hall outside the cave.

“Impossible!!!”

“Fake. Real God Wu Bei is lying!”

“Three White Blaze Fruit Trees, is he joking?”

The experts in the hall, including the twenty Almighties, stood up in surprise.

Three White Blaze Fruit Trees?

One must know, from the ancient times till then, there had only been two White Blaze Fruit Trees in Eternal Chaotic World.

The first tree was from the ancient times, which had been destroyed long ago.

The second tree was the one that fell into Real God Wu Bei’s hands during the crazy fight.

Back then, for the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit Tree, many Almighties had participated in the fight. There were even Almighties that had died from the fight.

But then, Real God Wu Bei said that he had three White Blaze Fruit Trees?

“Hurry, hurry up and ask if he really has three White Blaze Fruit Trees. If yes, ask how he got the other two trees,” the red-haired elderly immediately sent in a message. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

On the open ground of the third level of the cave.

“Real God Wu Bei, you really have three White Blaze Fruit Trees?” Universe God Liu Ying asked suspiciously.

“Of course, otherwise… With only one White Blaze Fruit Tree, how could I nurture so many White Blaze Fruits in such a short period of time? You must know that the total of White Blaze Fruits that appeared in the first and second level of the cave was about eighty pieces,” Real God Wu Bei smiled faintly, As for the other two White Blaze Fruit Trees’ origin, I can’t explain much. I can only tell you that there was an expert that helped to cultivate it.”

“An expert that helped to cultivate it?” Everyone on the open ground gasped.

In the lofty hall.

“Back when Real Wu Bei got the White Blaze Fruit Tree, it was just a sapling and it was not too long ago. During this time, even if the sapling grew mature, it would be impossible for one tree to have so many White Blaze Fruits. Hence, he must be telling the truth,” the red-haired elderly said.

“It is believable!”

“It seems that there was really an expert that had helped him to cultivate two White Blaze Fruit Trees. Who could the expert be? Could it be one of the few?”

“No way. Even though the few are powerful, they might not be capable of cultivating a new White Blaze Fruit Tree.

“Regardless of who the expert was, there’s a great chance laid before us. Previously, I thought there was only one White Blaze Fruit Tree and the possibility of us getting it was rather low. But now, there’s a total of three trees and the possibility of us getting one is much greater.”

“Mm, we shall see these guys’ performance.”

Although the Almighties were thirsty for White Blaze Fruit Trees, they could only place their hopes in the Universe Gods in the cave.

They could only rely on the Universe Gods to fight for the White Blaze Fruit Tree for them.

In the cave.

“I know everything that happens in the cave will definitely be watched closely by many Almighties. If so, let me tell the Almighties, the chance is laid before you. As for if you can get it or not, it depends if the guys that you sent in respectively are striving for it or not,” Real God Wu Bei said with a smile.

“Alright. I’ve said what I have to. Then… three tests, let’s begin with the first one straightaway.”

As he spoke, Real God Wu Bei’s blurry shadow waved his hand.

Vroom.

A boundless power concentrated in the void above the open ground. Then, there was a huge chess board that appeared.

On the chess board, there were only black chess pieces but no white chess pieces. There was a total of a thousand black chess pieces.

Looking at the huge chess board, the Universe Gods on the open ground were shocked.

“This… what is this?”

“Chess?”

“This test, would it be for us to play chess?”

“No, it’s not that simple. Every chess piece on the board gives me a very different feeling.”

It caused a great commotion at the open ground.

Jian Wushuang, who was in the middle of the open ground, saw the huge chess set that had appeared in the void above and he stared.

“This is the Scattered Stars Game?”

“Yes, it’s the Scattered Stars Game.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shined.

He was not unfamiliar with the Scattered Stars Game.

Back when he had first step foot in Eternal Chaotic World and wandered in Dayu World, the Master of Dayu Palace who was a Universe God in the Third Heaven on the peak of Dayu World had taken out the Scattered Stars Game.

However, the Master of Dayu Palace only had the Little Scattered Stars Game and there were only a hundred chess pieces. Hence, there were only a hundred moves.

Even so, Jian Wushuang had received great benefits from resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game back then, especially regarding his understanding towards swordsmanship, which had advanced by leaps and bounds.

Jian Wushuang had already found out from King of Venomous Worms that the Scattered Stars Game was of an unusual origin.

It was created by an Almighty. Not only was there a Little Scattered Stars Game, but there was also a Great Scattered Stars Game

There were ten thousand chess pieces in a complete Little Scattered Stars Game, with a total of ten thousand moves.

The huge chess board that appeared in the void above the open ground wasn’t a complete Great Scattered Stars Game. After all, there were only a thousand chess pieces.

However, to many Universe Gods, the Scattered Stars Game with a thousand chess pieces were already unfathomable.

“The first test is to resolve the Scattered Stars Game?”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrunk.
