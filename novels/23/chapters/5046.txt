Chapter 5049  The Master Behind the Scenes

For nearly 20,000 years, rumors about Cui Jing, the third-in-command of the Eternal Wushuang Auction House, had overshadowed all others.

There was a simple reason for this: he was known for his insatiable thirst for killing and his love of battle.

Over the course of 20,000 years, the Eternal Wushuang Auction House had long risen to become a presence above the Heavenly Regions. Even the foundation of some Super Heavenly Regions could not compare.

This was because what supported the Eternal Wushuang Auction House was the heritage of an Emperor, the heritage of Emperor Liu Ya.

One Emperor-grade pill was enough to mobilize an entire Super Heavenly Region.

As the third-in-command of the Eternal Wushuang Auction House, Cui Jing had proven his bloodlust and love for battle in a bloody that occurred 10,000 years ago.

Facing several Super Heavenly Regions and the attacks of dozens of Yan Immortals, he fought until the very end, enduring until reinforcements arrived.

Even before his injuries had fully healed, he rode alone through the night to reinforce, single-handedly annihilating two Super Heavenly Regions.

Over a dozen Yan Immortals, countless top cultivators, and living beings all perished in the void with no chance of escape.

He severed the heads of the two lords of the Heavenly Regions and brought them back to the Eternal Wushuang Auction House together with their immortal sources. They were auctioned off at a starting bid of one Sky Crystal.

It was from that battle that nearly 100 Heavenly Regions learned of Cui Jing's name.

Now, he stood at the center of the Heavenly Hall, his black and gold robe fluttering. He looked at the representatives of the Shangjun Sect with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

All the Yan Immortals looked at Cui Jing and unconsciously felt a chill on their necks. The auction of human heads from 10,000 years ago was still vivid in their memories.

"Y-Young Master, let's go quickly…"

The elder Yan Immortal was extremely nervous and anxious, not knowing how deep the roots of the Eternal Wushuang Auction House ran. Hence, stepping back was the most crucial thing to do.

However, the Young Master of the Shangjun Sect was still in a confrontational state, his eyes ice-cold.

Cui Jing could not be bothered to warn him. He turned around and said, "Give the pouch to Qing Ling and let her count it."

The Young Master of Guhai City reacted and nodded, handing the pouch to Qing Ling.

Qing Ling took it, opened the pouch, and examined it for a moment. Then she bowed slightly and said, "Sir, there are exactly 12 billion Black Mountain Crystals in the pouch, accurate without error."

Cui Jing nodded and prepared to leave.

But then, a chilly voice rang out, "The Eternal Wushuang Auction House is certainly generous."

"What I'd like to ask is whether the buyer of this pill is truly Guhai City, or is it actually the Eternal Wushuang Auction House?"

The entire Heavenly Hall fell silent, all the Yan Immortals and the lords of the Heavenly Region stared at this scene.

Anyone with functioning eyes could see that only an enormous entity like the Eternal Wushuang Auction House could afford 12 billion Black Mountain Crystals.

Even though Guhai City was a superpower that spanned 13 Heavenly Regions, it was absolutely impossible for it to have 12 billion Black Mountain Crystals.

The result was self-evident.

Moreover, there was another layer of meaning behind Cui Jing giving 12 billion Black Mountain Crystals in public.

Cui Jing represented the Eternal Wushuang Auction House.

His willingness to give away 12 billion Black Mountain Crystals in public was a way of repaying the favor from 10,000 years ago, when Guhai City had extended a helpnig hand to the Eternal Wushuang Auction House.

This was also a signal to all the Transcendent Immortals present and the lords of the Heavenly Regions: as long as you helped Eternal Wushuang Auction House, they would naturally repay you tenfold or a hundredfold.

Therefore, this was a display of generosity without any pretense.

However, when the Young Master of the Shangjun Sect said it, it didn't seem so appealing.

Cui Jing stopped and a strange smile appeared on his cold face. He turned around and said in a low voice, "The buyer of the pill is obviously Guhai City. Didn't you see all that?"

When the Young Master of Shangjun Sect heard this, he smiled slightly. "I see. But isn't the Black Mountain Crystals used to purchase the pill provided by Eternal Wushuang Auction House?"

"If it was provided by Eternal Wushuang Auction House, then what's the point of putting this pill up for auction?"

As soon as he said this, a commotion broke out in the Heavenly Palace.

All the elder Yan Immortals of Guhai City had solemn expressions, ready to fight at any moment. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Cui Jing smiled, "This pill was indeed acquired by Guhai City, but the Black Mountain Crystals were sent to the auction house by the elders of Guhai City in advance."

"What, you don't believe me?"

The noise gradually died down, but tension remained.

"How can we believe it?" The Young Master of Shangjun Sect smiled.

At this moment, Cui Jing burst into laughter. "Why should I make you believe me? I didn't say it to make you believe; I said it to inform you. Whether you believe it or not doesn't matter!"

The eyes of the Shangjun Sect's Young Master instantly became clear and cold.

"Young Master, let's go!" the elder whispered. "This is Eternal Wushuang Auction House. We shouldn't get into a dispute here."

The cold light in his eyes disappeared. The Young Master of the Shangjun Sect suddenly smiled. "It seems that Eternal Wushuang Auction House is not such a clean place either, full of impurities and filth."

As soon as these words were spoken, all the Yan Immortals looked shocked. The Shangjun Sect was going to confront Eternal Wushuang Auction House!

Cui Jing's expression turned cold, but he still suppressed the anger in his heart and looked at him. "What's your name?"

All the elders of the Shangjun Sect were shocked. The oldest of them cupped his hands in a trembling voice. "Lord Cui, our Young Master is still young and full of vigor. If he offended you in any way, please--"

Before he could finish his sentence, Young Master Shangjun Sect stopped him and said in a serious tone, "I am the son of the Sect Master of Shangjun Sect, Qin Tuo."

"Qin Tuo, that's a good name." Cui Jing suddenly clapped his hands and laughed. "But do you think it's better for you to say that with your own mouth or have it carved on your tombstone?"

When the Young Master named Qin Tuo heard this, his eyes narrowed and he involuntarily took a step back.

Cui Jing smiled disdainfully and prepared to leave.

Qin Tuo, who realized that he had lost his composure, instantly felt embarrassed. He said angrily, "Who do you think you are, a mere auction house! How dare you go against the Shangjun Sect?!"

At this point, the entire place erupted in shock. More than half of the Yan Immortals looked at Qin Tuo with a meaningful look.

Shangjun Sect was the top Super Heavenly Region in the entire Great Si Region. It was true that it could sweep over half of the ordinary Heavenly Regions.

But this time, they had kicked a hornet's nest. They had challenged a terrifying force that had wiped out more than ten Super Heavenly Regions 10,000 years ago. the consequences were not something they could resist.

Cui Jing stopped, his black and gold robe fluttering despite the lack of wind.

In the next moment, he suddenly turned around and, with unimaginable speed, kicked Qin Tuo in the chest.

Boom!

Qin Tuo was sent flying a hundred feet and crashed heavily into the jade wall.

The Heavenly Palace was deathly silent, all the Yan Immortals were astonished.

None of the Yan Immortals had expected Cui Jing to kick the son of Shangjun Sect so unreservedly and without any restraint.
