Chapter 183: Two Months

In the air outside of the Nine Emperors Sect.

“Young Master!”

A purple-robed figure suddenly appeared beside Wang Yuan and respectfully said, “Grayrobe from Blood Feather Tower is coming in person, and he will arrive here in several minutes.”

“So fast?”

With a frown, Wang Yuan casually threw away the fruit he had been eating, and ordered, “Dan Wu, go stop them. I’ll go after my Third Brother.”

“Yes,” The brown-haired elder beside Wang Yuan answered, and then his figure instantly disappeared from the air.

“Little Condor, let’s go.” Wang Yuan patted the Purple Cloud Condor under him.

The Purple Cloud Condor flapped its wings and flew towards the Nine Emperors Sect.

Jian Wushuang and his comrades had just come out of the Nine Emperors Sect.

“Third brother.” Riding on the Purple Cloud Condor, Wang Yuan turned up in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Eldest Brother,” Jian Wushang said with a forced smile.

“Where is your father? He isn’t in the Nine Emperors Sect?” Wang Yuan was puzzled.

“Young Master, ” Dan Jiu said, “Master Wushuang’s father is in the Nine Emperors Sect, but he is trapped in a Spirit Locking Spell, so...”

“Spirit Locking Spell?” Wang Yuan widened his eyes. With his background, of course he knew about the Spirit Locking Spell. He realized right away why Jian Wushuang had not successfully rescued his father.

“The experts from the Blood Feather Tower are coming. Let’s leave first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Er, we must leave right now,” Wang Yuan seriously said and nodded. Then, they left the scope of Nine Right Mountain very quickly.

Soon after they left, Grayrobe arrived with as many as ten purple-masked assassins.

Naturally, they found nobody.

When Grayrobe saw Jian Nantian was still imprisoned in that yard, he breathed a sigh of relief.

“Jian Nantian is extremely important to our Blood Feather Tower. Tower Master specially paid a high price to get a Spirit Locking Spell at that time to imprison him. Now it looks like Tower Master is really farsighted,” Grayrobe conceitedly replied and laughed.

...

Soon after leaving Nine Ring Mountain, Jian Wushuang and others stopped in the air.

Jian Wushuang thanked the seven Golden Dragon Ambassadors, “Thank you for your help this time. Although I was unable to save my father in the end, I will still remember this debt of gratitude.”

“Brother Wushuang, we weren’t actually of any help this time,” said Ye Rufeng, while spreading out his hands.

“Yes. We fought against the experts of Nine Emperors Sect, but we failed to rescue your father in the end,” Shui Minghao also said.

They exchanged courteous?words. Afterall, these Golden Dragon Ambassadors also felt regret.

Although they had put forth their strength, they did not really rescue Jian Wushuang’s father. Hence, they could not receive Jian Wushuang’s full gratitude. At most, they would get a small debt of gratitude.

“Since the matter has passed, we’ll leave now.”

The seven Golden Dragon Ambassadors quickly left, one by one.

Having said goodbye to the Golden Dragon Ambassadors, the four siblings, Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou, went back to the Dragon Palace.

Soon after they arrived, Palace Master White came to talk with Jian Wushuang.

“I have heard the story. I never thought Blood Feather Tower attached such great importance to your father. They not only secretly arrange six powerful purple-masked assassins to guard your father, but also use the Spirit Locking Spell to imprison him,” said Palace Master White.

“I did not expect that either.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“It’s troublesome,” Palace Master White slightly narrowed her eyes and continued saying, “Only a legendary expert that has reached Divine Transcendence could break the Spirit Locking Spell. In the entire Tianzong Dynasty, only one man has actually reached that level.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression darkened.

He also knew that, so he felt worried at the bottom of his heart.

“I’m cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill, and it’s possible to reach that level one day. However, it’s just a chance, and it might take a very long time,”?Jian Wushuang thought solemnly.

“Actually, Jian Wushuang, if you want to rescue your father now, there might be a way,” Palace Master White suddenly said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked over at Palace Master White.

“Don’t forget that the Easternmost Hunt will begin in two months. All 12 Northwestern Dynasties will participate in the hunt, and many experts from those old sects will be there,” said Palace Master White.

“Perform well in the Easternmost Hunt and attract the attention of the old sects, there should be someone who has reached Divine Transcendence in the old sects. As long as you become a disciple of an old sect, you’ll have a chance to approach those transcendental beings.”

“If you are lucky to become a personal disciple of a transcendental being, it will be easy to ask your Master to help save your father, won’t it?”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“That’s true!”

“There must be some experts who have reached Divine Transcendence in those old sects. As long as I perform excellently in the Easternmost Hunt, I’ll get the chance to enter those old sects and even become a disciple of one of those supreme experts.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were sparkling with a dazzling light.

Previously, he was looking forward to this Easternmost Hunt, but he did not yearn for it so strongly.

But now, things had changed.

During the Easternmost Hunt in two months, he would do his best to perform well.

“It’s good that you’ve come around to the idea. There are still two months before the Easternmost Hunt. Prepare well in these two months. Anyway, the Easternmost Hunt is not the same as the selection battle,” Palace Master White warned.

“Although you have incomparable talent, it is only in Tianzong Dynasty. In the Easternmost Hunt, there are other exceptional geniuses from as many as eleven other dynasties. At that time you will meet them.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang tightly clenched his fists and heavily nodded.

Palace Master White departed shortly after that, leaving Jian Wushuang standing there with unprecedented determination in his eyes.

“Two months...”

“I still have two months. In these two months, I have to improve my strength as much as possible.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Having decided, Jian Wushuang immediately fell into earnest cultivation.

However, it was not practical for the current Jian Wushuang to greatly improve his strength in such a short period. He knew that himself.

After all, his strength was already very terrifying, and there were only two ways to enhance it further.

Either a breakthrough to the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

Or in sword essence comprehension, combining the Sword Essence of Earth with the other three sword essences, combining all four sword essences together. Then, his strength would achieve a whole new level.

In both spiritual power and sword essence comprehension, he had found himself stuck at a bottleneck. It would not be easy for him to make a breakthrough.

Having a breakthrough depended on opportunity and timing, so it was impossible to guess when it would happen.

When the timing was right, he would naturally make a breakthrough.

Since his cultivation of spiritual power and the comprehension of sword essence were both hard to enhance, Jian Wushuang spent all his energy on his swordsmanship...
