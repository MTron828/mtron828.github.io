4716 About the Realm

Jian Wushuang nodded. He could tell that Chun Qiu was in a bad mood, but he did not say anything and left the Great Lonely Heaven with him.

In Little Lonely Heaven, above the clouds, Jian Wushuang looked at him and asked, “You want to kill the Young Emperor for revenge?”

Chun Qiu was stunned for a moment, then he shook his head slightly and said, “Although he’s someone I want to kill on the spot, compared to others, I’d rather be the first to kill his Imperial Father with my own hands!”

Jian Wushuang knew that there must be a secret behind this. He had known long ago that Chun Qiu was not an ordinary top cultivator, but the son of an Emperor of the Heavenly Court.

“My Imperial Father, Emperor Fenghua, died at the hands of Zhen Wuyang. The entire Heavenly Court was destroyed along with him. In the end, I was the only one left, and I became a prisoner.”

The past was long gone, but it still wrapped around him like chains, causing him to sink into anger and hatred all the time.

Even though he wished he could kill Zhen Wuyang, he was not even qualified to see him. He did not even know where the Heavenly Court was.

Jian Wushuang did not comfort him. Instead, he placed his palm on Chun Qiu’s shoulder and patted it gently.

Chun Qiu looked at him gratefully and said slowly, “Brother Jian, if it wasn’t for your appearance, I’m afraid I would still be a prisoner in that black mountains. I’ll remember all the kindness you’ve shown me, and I’ll never forget it until I die.”

Jian Wushuang said, “Live well and keep improving your strength so that you can kill your enemies one day.”

Chun Qiu nodded. “Don’t worry, Brother Jian. I believe that day will come.”

“By the way,” he suddenly hesitated and said after a moment. “Brother Jian, if such a day really comes, will you help him?”

The ‘him’ that Chun Qiu was referring to was naturally the Young Emperor.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head without hesitation and said, “By then, I’m afraid I’ll have already left this place. What you’re worried about won’t happen. What you need the most now is to constantly improve your strength.”

Chun Qiu nodded and took out the palm-sized eight-armed pottery Arhat. He returned it to Jian Wushuang and said, “Brother Jian, I’ll return it to you. It can only display its strongest power in front of an expert.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and pushed the eight-armed Arhat back. “This thing is not of much use to me. I can give it to you for self-defense, but don’t rely on it too much.”

Chun Qiu did not decline and carefully put the eight-armed pottery Arhat back into his arms.

“Chun Qiu, the Emperor you’re talking about, is it the cultivation realm after Yan Immortal, or is it just a title?”

Jian Wushuang had never asked this question before. Now that he suddenly thought of it, he decided to ask.

Even though Chun Qiu had yet to become a Yan Immortal, he was still the son of an Emperor. Naturally, he would know more about the situation than Jian Wushuang.

When Chun Qiu heard this, he explained carefully, “Emperor is actually a form of respect. It’s not a cultivation realm, but it’s a true dividing line.”

“When I was young, I heard my Imperial Father’s admonishments. I vaguely knew that to become an Emperor, one must have fate energy, the Great Dao to build the Heavenly Court, and one’s own cultivation realm.”

“The most important step to becoming an Emperor is to enter that level. However…” Chun Qiu’s memory seemed to be a little blurry. “I seem to have forgotten what level it is.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. He had long realized that the True Souls of the three Emperors that he had first come into contact with had all surpassed the level of Yan Immortal.

If one wanted to become an Emperor that could create a Heavenly Court, they would have to step out of the mysterious realm of the Yan Immortal.

As for what other realms there were, Jian Wushuang was at a loss. He could only move forward carefully and comprehend.

With the three Emperors’ True Shadows by his side, he could protect himself from any powerful force.

There was no sun in the sky of Little Lonely Heaven, but it was never dark. It was always a peaceful day, very similar to the scene of a mountain sky.

After a few days of casual discussion with Chun Qiu, Jian Wushuang began to cultivate.

He took out a few books on the way of the sword that he had bought in Jingchuan Sky City.

Looking at the ancient marks on the books, Jian Wushuang estimated that the age of these books was probably tens of thousands of years older than him.

There were a total of four books, and the ancient aura sealed on them had been severely exhausted. With a casual wave of his hand, the seal disappeared with the wind.

These four books were randomly selected from the hands of various Yan Immortals, and they were the oldest Sword Dao in the Great Yan Domain.

Three of them taught the foundation of sword principle, which was of great benefit to cultivators of the Sword Dao. From the residual aura of these isolated books, the writers had already reached the realm of the derived immortal when they created these sword principles.

Like a whale sucking in water, Jian Wushuang quickly absorbed the sword principle knowledge in the three books. Finally, he looked at the last book. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The two simple and sharp words ‘Collection of Swords’ seemed to have been casually written on the first page with a straw stick dipped in ink.

Jian Wushuang was a little puzzled. He seemed to have forgotten which stall he had bought this book from, and he had no impression of it.

Casting aside the distracting thoughts in his mind, he waved his hand and flipped to the first page.

What he saw was a blank space.

Not a single word appeared on the yellow paper that was suffused with dark green.

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat. “No way. Did I meet a scammer?”

He did not believe it and hurriedly turned it over and over to check.

In the end, he came to the conclusion that he had been cheated by a profiteer.

This was a wordless heavenly book.

Jian Wushuang did not know whether to laugh or cry. After checking it again with Yan power and confirming that it was of no value, he was ready to throw it away.

However, the next moment, a warm and cool aura flashed in his hand. If one did not pay attention, it would be impossible to notice.

He subconsciously looked at the ‘Collection of Swords’ in his hand. An extremely dense Immortal Qi, like clouds and smoke, rotated on the lone book for a moment and then fell into the book in an instant.

As if he had realized something, Jian Wushuang hurriedly opened the wordless heavenly book in his hand.

On the withered yellow paper that was suffused with dark green, the Immortal Qi was dense to the extreme. It was like a terrifying dragon the size of a finger, circling the paper.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were wide open. He could not figure out where the aura, which was both familiar and strange, came from.

Soon, the cloud-like aura suddenly condensed and instantly transformed into a figure the size of a fingernail.

He completely held his breath. The scene before his eyes seemed a little mysterious.

That thumb-sized figure was extremely small, but the White robe he wore made him look like an Immortal, with the air of a Grandmaster.

Although the figure had no facial features, the aura it gave off was very familiar to Jian Wushuang. It felt like he was an old friend.
