4236 Snake Slaying (Part Seven)

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s aura was extremely powerful. A pressure from the depths of his soul suddenly descended!

This was the power of intimidation!

In an instant, time seemed to have frozen. Everything began to slow down, as if they had fallen into a quagmire.

Under this power, Heavenly Snake Playboy actually felt that he was extremely small, and he had a feeling of wanting to worship him.

This was the way a higher being looked down on a lower being.

This was a complete suppression of inferior lifeforms from the soul and bloodline of a perfect lifeform!

Jian Wushuang took advantage of this brief moment of sluggishness and immediately shot out of Heavenly Snake Playboy’s mouth. Then, he slashed down with the Wuqi Divine Sword!

“Sundering Stars!”

Bang!

In an instant, a thousand-foot long sword rainbow condensed in Jian Wushuang’s hand. Like a god descending to the world, his black hair fluttered and the silver sword rainbow slashed toward Heavenly Snake Playboy’s head!

Ka ka ka!

At this moment, the void trembled because of this sword intent, and it let out a cracking sound.

Suddenly, the silver sword rainbow fell directly on the giant python that Heavenly Snake Playboy had transformed into, opening a deep wound.

“Roar!”

Heavenly Snake Playboy let out an extremely shrill scream. Divine blood spurted out from his snake body and splattered on the ground, burning countless holes in the ground.

Under this sword, Heavenly Snake Playboy’s divine power was obliterated. The sharp sword will continued to wring in his body, killing the divine power in his body.

Roarrrr!

Due to the excruciating pain, Ruler Heavenly Snake writhed on the ground. His huge tail smacked the entire Eighth City, causing it to shake.

At this moment, the countless cultivators of the Eighth City who were watching the battle from afar were shocked to the extreme.

“Heavenly Snake Playboy…he’s been defeated?”

“Tu…snake-slaying? Is Heavenly Snake Playboy really going to die at the hands of the Blood Sword?”

“Something big has happened! This is going to be a big problem!”

“Invincible! The Blood Sword is invincible!”

“Who can block the Blood Sword?”

When countless people saw this scene, their faces were first filled with shock, and then they shouted in disbelief.

Ruler Lange and the others also had looks of disbelief on their faces.

“Did this Blood Sword really defeat Heavenly Snake Playboy?” Lange’s eyes flashed with disbelief.

Behind him, the Jiuxi Holy Land disciples were so frightened that their eyes almost popped out.

Divine Lord Tiancang’s eyes flickered continuously and his gaze toward Jian Wushuang was filled with fear.

However, he quickly calmed down after taking a deep breath.

In his expectation, Jian Wushuang should have been killed by Heavenly Snake Playboy. Then, he would take advantage of Heavenly Snake Playboy’s relaxed vigilance to kill Jian Wushuang in one blow!

But now, although the expectations were different, the effect was no different.

“Lange, now is the time. It’s our turn to attack!” A cold glint flashed in Divine Lord Tiancang’s eyes as he turned around and shouted.

Bang!

At once, Divine Lord Tiancang stomped his feet and shot up into the sky, shooting toward Heavenly Snake Playboy!

Lange’s eyes flickered with thoughts. He looked at Jian Wushuang coldly and sneered, “Blood Sword, Blood Sword, you are indeed very strong. However, I will be taking the head of Heavenly Snake Playboy!”

Whoosh!

He held the snow-white divine spear in his hand and also swept up.

“Junior Sister Jiuxi, watch how I cut off the head of Heavenly Snake Playboy!” He looked back at Holy Maiden Jiuxi and said proudly.

Divine Lord Tiancang and Ruler Lange did not hesitate any longer and charged toward Heavenly Snake Playboy at the same time!

“Heavenly Snake, those who commit injustice are doomed to destruction. Do you know who I am?” Divine Lord Tiancang laughed and a blue saber appeared in his hand. Lightning rolled on the saber and it slashed toward Heavenly Snake Playboy!

“Heavenly Snake Playboy, remember, Lange is the one who killed you! Hahaha!” Lange laughed as well. His body flashed and he stabbed toward Heavenly Snake Playboy’s head with his snow-white spear!

This change had come too quickly.

It was so fast that Jian Wushuang did not even have time to react.

By the time Jian Wushuang reacted, Divine Lord Tiancang and Ruler Lange had already passed him and were closing in on Heavenly Snake.

“Idiot!”

Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly turned extremely gloomy.

Heavenly Snake Playboy was now in an extremely dangerous situation. Even he planned to avoid it.

If the two of them rushed forward now, was it really certain that Heavenly Snake playboy would die?

Heavenly Snake Playboy, who was sprawled on the ground with divine blood gushing out of his mouth, raised his head and looked at Divine Lord Tiancang and Ruler Lange, who were shooting toward him. His golden vertical pupils suddenly showed joy.

Buzzzzzz!

Before Divine Lord Tiancang and Ruler Lange could get close to him, his huge snake tail shot out and wrapped around Divine Lord Tiancang’s body, pulling him fiercely!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Divine Lord Tiancang’s expression changed drastically. He felt that after being wrapped by the snake’s tail, he could not use any of his divine power. The lightning that was rolling on the divine knife in his hand exploded on the snake’s tail, but it only left a black mark.

“How is that possible?” Divine Lord Tiancang was shocked.

Ruler Lange’s face instantly went pale with terror.

He looked at Divine Lord Tiancang, who was struggling, and he felt his entire body tremble in fear.

Run!!!

Ruler Lange took a step forward, immediately preparing to flee.

Before he could take two steps.

A forked tongue shot out of Heavenly Snake Playboy’s mouth, wrapped around Ruler Lange, and pulled him back toward Heavenly Snake Divine Lord!

“No!”

Ruler Lange struggled and howled.

However, it was of no use.

If Heavenly Snake Playboy had not met Jian Wushuang, he would definitely be the most terrifying existence in the top ten cities on the ancient road of stars. How could he resist?

Ruler Lange was instantly swallowed by Heavenly Snake Playboy, and his huge, sharp fangs stabbed into his neck.

Ruler Lange’s divine power was constantly being sucked away by Heavenly Snake Playboy.

Ruler Lange began to struggle madly, but after a few seconds, he gradually stopped moving. His hands and feet went limp, and in the end, his divine body turned into dust.

Heavenly Snake Playboy’s injuries and the divine power that Jian Wushuang had obliterated immediately recovered at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

The cultivators of the Eighth City, who were watching the battle from afar, shook their heads without any pity when they saw this.

“This person is truly stupid to the extreme.”

“Hmph, who is Lange? Does he really think that anyone can step on his head?”

“Does this person think he’s a Blood Sword? Is Heavenly Snake Playboy someone he can provoke?”

“He really deserved to die. He can’t do anything right, but he’s good at ruining things.”

The Rulers who were watching the battle looked at the people from the Jiuxi Holy Land with ridicule.

The next moment, they let out a long sigh.
