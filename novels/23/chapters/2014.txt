2015 One Versus Six

“Six Great Emperors!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold as he stared at the six Great Emperor with a billowing murderous intention in front of him.

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao thought he was going to perform the Secret Skill of Star Palace to fight against them.

But in actual fact, Jian Wushuang had never planned to do so.

If he performed the Secret Skill of Star Palace, he might really be able to beat off the six Great Emperors. He might even kill a few of them. However, it would take a few thousand years until he could perform the skill again. He had just entered Three-Emperors World and the danger in Eternal Chaotic World was just starting to be unearthed, what could they do if there was another drastic changed after he performed the secret skill?

There was no doubt that the Secret Skill of Star Palace absolutely couldn’t be performed.

Moreover, most importantly, the six Great Emperors had yet to corner him to that stage!

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang roared and his roar reverberated through the universe. Jian Wushuang’s body started magnifying at a terrifyingly fast speed as well.

His body increased in size by a dozen times and it became a one-hundred-zhang-tall giant.

The giant was golden-jade skinned and there were heads and arms that extended from his body. In an instant, it had nine heads and eighteen arms. His eighteen arms held a sword each. There was a burst of bloodline power.

His huge figure blocked before the six Great Emperors.

“Ancient tribe bloodline?”

The beast-like bald man among the six Great Emperors recognized Jian Wushuang’s bloodline in the first glance. Then, he smirked in disdain, “So what if you have an ancient tribe bloodline. You are courting death if you dare to block before the six of us!”

“Kill him!”

The beast-like bald man took the lead to attack.

Rumble.

The battle-axe descended in heavy darkness.

The battle-axe slammed. It could break heaven and split the earth.

The other five Great Emperors next to the bald man didn’t hesitate either.

They launched attacks simultaneously.

There were powerful attacks flying at Jian Wushuang.

Abysmal Saint Master and the other two members in the void behind saw the scene and they were terrified.

“Jian Wushuang, what is he doing?”

“Secret Skill of Star Palace, hurry up and perform Secret Skill of Star Palace!!!”

“He has yet to perform the Secret Skill of Star Palace until now. Is he really thinking to fight against the six Great Emperors alone!? It’s impossible. It’s impossible!!!”

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao were worried.

As they watched him, Jian Wushuang, who had nine heads and eighteen arms, his nine pairs of eyes were shimmering with coldness.

His eighteen arms wielded the swords.

Vroom.

There was a shapeless sword intention that suddenly soared and Jian Wushuang seemed to turn into a black hole.

A huge black hole that could swallow all power.

In the huge black hole, his eighteen swords flew out one after another.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Mixed Element Spirit!

The six Great Emperors attacked at the same time and all their attacks were fast and fierce.

However, the attacks had yet to hit Jian Wushuang and were blocked by a sword.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There were continuous clanging noises and the attacks by the six Great Emperors were blocked by Jian Wushuang.

None of the attacks hit Jian Wushuang’s divine body for real.

“How is it possible?”

The six Great Emperors looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Such a unique sword intention,” the beast-like bald man was taken by surprise too. The sword principle that Jian Wushuang performed was really strange. It looked ordinary but it blocked all their attacks.

“The attacks of us six Great Emperors are fierce. Even if he could block our attacks with his sword principle, the impact itself should be strong enough to injure him or even kill him. But he is completely undamaged?” The purple-haired young man who drove six Hong Jun Golden Swords looked shocked.

Completely undamaged!

Yeah, they could see clearly that although Jian Wushuang had moved backward under the strong impact of the attack when Jian Wushuang took their hits, his aura didn’t grow any weaker but his fighting power was maintained at its peak.

“He took my battle-axe hit earlier too and he was fine,” the beast-like bald man squinted his eyes and humphed coldly, “Sword Emperor’s divine body is strange. Let’s not bother about it for now. Let’s kill the other three persons first. Don’t let them seize any chance to escape!”

“Okay.”

The five Great Emperors nodded and their figures immediately plunged out. They wanted to go around Jian Wushuang and go after Abysmal Saint Master and the other two.

Jian Wushuang smirked coldly at the sight. The boundless divine power and the power of the ancient tribe bloodline swept out from his body.

“Ancient God Secret Skill, Moon Picking Skill!”

Vroom!!!

Heaven and earth shook. The spacetime around Jian Wushuang’s huge divine body was affected. It instantly rumbled. The entire universe and the entire spacetime mercilessly pressed down on the people within the region.

The six Great Emperors felt the pressure from the surrounding spacetime and their bodies were restricted.

Moon Picking Skill was one of the strongest secret skills of Ancient God. It was extremely impressive.

Especially after Jian Wushuang’s breakthrough, his divine power and ancient tribe bloodline power had increased tremendously. When he performed the secret skill again, it even influenced the Great Emperor experts.

As the six Great Emperors’ bodies were pressured by the spacetime, Jian Wushuang attacked again.

He waved his eighteen arms at the same time.

“Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Monsterfy On Will!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were sword lights that ignored the spacetime and appeared before the six Great Emperors straight away.

Fast, too fast.

It was so fast that the Great Emperors were astonished.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo had four moves. Monsterfy On Will was the stroke that focused on speed the most among the four moves.

The stroke was performed with one’s will.

Although the six Great Emperors were pressured by the spacetime, they were trying to get close to Abysmal Saint Master and his troops. However, they had no choice but to stop to block the sword principle as it charged at them. Now, the six Great Emperors were raging with anger.

“Sword Emperor, as you are really courting death, I shall fulfill your dream!!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Full force. Kill him first!”

“I don’t believe that we six Peak Chaotic Realm and Mister Ling Zong can’t kill Sword Emperor who is only in Early Stage Chaotic Realm!”

“Die!”

The six Great Emperors were obviously provoked.

From the skills that Jian Wushuang had performed, they might not be able to kill Abysmal Saint Master and his troops if they didn’t kill Jian Wushuang first.

Hence, there was no need for discussion among the six and they made a unified choice.

They would use their full force to kill Jian Wushuang first!!!
