Chapter 437: Beimo Cave Mansion

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“In the Flaming Battlefield, we have a tacit agreement that lords won’t join fights!

“Therefore, when both sides fight for control of the cave mansions or other important items, Stage Three experts and Heaven-defying Level experts mean a lot!

“Previously, each camp had three Heaven-defying Level experts, so both sides possessed equal battle strength. When fighting for control of cave mansions or important items, both camps would send their Heaven-defying Level experts to balance out the highest level battles, so they usually ended in a stalemate.

“However, now that you have killed Deng Huo, their camp has lost a Heaven-defying Level expert. You have upset the balance!”

“In the near future, if we need to fight for control of a cave mansion or some important items, we will hold the advantage because, including you, we have four Heaven-defying Level experts. Their camp will not be able to beat us, so we’ll gain more benefits,” Spirit Lord said with a smile.

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

If lords did not show up, a Heaven-defying Level expert would be the deciding factor in conflicts of interests.

“Although Deng Huo had not reached the Cloud Realm, he was still more important than a lord. After all, both sides have lots of lords, so it’s no big deal for them to lose one. However, there were only three Heaven-defying Level experts in each camp. If such an expert dies, his camp will suffer a great loss.

“You killed a Heaven-defying Level expert, so you will receive more rewards than you would for killing a lord,” Spirit Lord said.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang did not know how to respond.

Since Heaven-defying Level experts were so important, it was no wonder that he would receive such a big reward.

“Spirit Lord, you just said I have two options. What’s the second one?” Jian Wushuang asked. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Our camp controls 99 cave mansions. Of course, counting Jiushe Cave Mansion, we have 100 cave mansions now. The second option is to allow you to enter one of those cave mansions,” Spirit Lord replied.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“You mean that I can choose a cave mansion to explore once.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands with a gush of excitement in his eyes. Then he asked, “Spirit Lord, are the three marquis cave mansions included in 100 cave mansions?”

“Yes.” Spirit Lord nodded.

“Okay, then I will take the second option and I want to explore Marquis Beimo Cave Mansion,” Jian Wushuang said without hesitation.

Ever since he went to Treasure Vault and read the information about the cave mansions, he had been longing for the chance to enter Beimo Cave Mansion.

Marquis Beimo had comprehended World Origin to an amazing level. He left three opportunities in his mansion, and that was very attractive to Jian Wushuang.

“You really made a good choice.”

Spirit Lord looked toward Jian Wushuang and said, “Of those cave mansions, the cave mansion Marquis Beimo left is the most precious. It commonly costs 100,000 battle achievements to enter that mansion!

“As for the other two marquis cave mansions, you only need to pay 50,000 or 65,000 for each mansion.”

Jian Wushuang touched his nose. He still remembered how the cost of entering Beimo Cave Mansion had startled him at the time.

It was lucky that he received this special reward, or he might have to wait a long time to meet the requirement.

“Beimo Cave Mansion is in the Outer Area. You should know its location, so you can go there whenever you want,” Spirit Lord added.

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised. “I don’t need a token or a form of identification?”

“No, I will send a message to the experts who are guarding the mansion. They will identify you when you get there,” Spirit Lord replied.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Then you can go,” Spirit Lord said while waving his hand. Jian Wushuang immediately left the tent.

After he submitted his task and gained his battle achievements, Jian Wushuang immediately left for Beimo Cave Mansion.

He could not wait any longer.

Beimo Cave Mansion was in the Outer Area.

A few days later, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Beimo Cave Mansion. At the sight of it, he immediately perceived the powerful Formation surrounding the mansion.

The Formation did not release any power, but it could still frighten him a bit.

Beimo Cave Mansion was heavily guarded. It had even more experts than Jiushe Cave Mansion.

Jian Wushuang slowly approached the entrance but found the Formation blocking his way.

“Who is it?” A cyan-dressed man, who was standing by the entrance with several experts, shouted.

“Swordsman,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Swordsman?” The cyan-dressed man and the experts beside him were shocked.

The news that Jian Wushuang killed Deng Huo had spread through the whole Flaming Battlefield over the past several days, so the experts who guarded Beimo Cave Mansion had also heard about it.

“Sir, you are Swordsman?” the cyan-dressed man immediately changed his attitude and said respectfully, “I received an order and know you have an opportunity to explore Beimo Cave Mansion. I didn’t expect you to come so quickly.”

The cyan-dressed man was an expert at Stage Three, but he still called Jian Wushuang “Sir”.

“May I go inside now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sorry, Sir. I do believe you, but we have rules. I need to identify you before you can enter,” the cyan-dressed man said.

“How will you identify me?” Jian Wushuang replied peacefully.

“As we all know, you’ve awakened a Double First-grade Sword Soul and can display a Realm Technique... Blood River. Sir, as long as you perform one of those techniques, I can let you enter,” the cyan-dressed man answered.
