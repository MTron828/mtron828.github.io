Chapter 2929: Xue Dong King

——

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the Evergreen Realm Lord.

“Xue Dong King!”

The Evergreen Realm Lord smiled. “Xue Dong King used to be an Invincible Divine Master in the Inkstone Realm. When he was a Divine Master, his comprehension of rules and Dao had already reached the level of an Immortal Saint. He even created an absolute art at the level of a Saint. Later on, he paid a price to obtain a Heaven-cleaving token and passed the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s test to become a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes immediately lit up.

Since Xue Dong King was a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he must know the location of the secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance around the Inkstone Realm.

“Where is Xue Dong King now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Don’t worry, my friend.” The Evergreen Realm Lord said indifferently, “Xue Dong King is in the Inkstone Realm. It’s not difficult for you to find him. Just ask a slightly stronger Great Divine Master and you’ll know. However, Xue Dong King has a very strange temper. If you want him to tell you the location of the secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, you’ll have to go through a lot of trouble.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “He has a weird temper. How weird is that?”

“It’s simple. He likes to fight. He’s a battle maniac. He only respects experts who are stronger than him or are recognized by him. It’s hard for ordinary experts to meet him or to befriend him because he won’t talk to you at all. Instead, he takes the initiative and is very enthusiastic when facing those who are stronger than him and can be recognized by him.”

“My friend, if you want to see him, you have to be prepared in advance,” said the Evergreen Realm Lord.

“Prepared? You mean, fight with him?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“Of course. You have to fight with him and get his approval before he will talk to you. In addition, he has deliberately set up a series of powerful means in his residence. These means are so powerful that no ordinary person can break in. In other words, you have to go through the means he has set up over the years before you can really see him,” said the Evergreen Realm Lord.

“So harsh?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

They had met each other not long ago. If Xue Dong King did not want to meet him, he could just disappear.

However, he had deliberately set up many means in his residence. No matter who it was, they had to break through all the means to meet him.

“Xue Dong King is indeed eccentric, but it should not be difficult for me to break through his means with my strength,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t be too confident, my friend. I forgot to tell you that Xue Dong King has made a breakthrough to the Immortal Saint-level not long ago. His battle strength is much stronger than mine, so his tricks are naturally more powerful,” said the Evergreen Realm Lord.

“A breakthrough?” Jian Wushuang was stunned, but then he shrugged helplessly and said, “No matter what, I have to try. Thank you, Evergreen Realm Lord. Goodbye!”

Jian Wushuang stood up and left after saying his thanks.

Evergreen Realm Lord looked at Jian Wushuang’s departure with a strange expression.

“Jian Yuan is not only in the Inkstone Realm but also in the surrounding territories. I’ve never heard of him. However, the pressure he gives me is very great. It’s even greater than the pressure from the other three Realm Lords in the Inkstone Realm. Where did this expert come from?”

“Did he really come to my Inkstone Realm just for the secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?”

The Evergreen Realm Lord pondered for a moment before shaking his head, no longer thinking about it.

…

On top of a smooth cliff, there was a huge Scarlet Castle.

This red castle was extremely famous in the entire Inkstone Realm. After all, that Xue Dong King who had already broken through to the Immortal Saint Realm and could threaten the four Realm Lords lived here. Around the Scarlet Castle… a layer of scarlet mist surrounded the castle, flowing normally like a scarlet river. From time to time, faint blood-colored bubbles would appear.

In the deepest part of the castle.

“Seventh young master, go back. The clan leader misses you every day. Even if you still have some resentment toward what happened back then, it has been so many years. No matter what you do, you still have to care about the relationship between father and son.” A white-haired old man stood below the steps, he looked eagerly at a blood-haired, blood-robed man above him.

That blood-haired, blood-robed man was none other than the Xue Dong King.

“The relationship between father and son? Hehe, how laughable. Back then, he complained that my cultivation speed was slow and that I didn’t live up to expectations. When he beat and scolded me countless times, I could still understand and still be able to consider the relationship between father and son.

“But back then, I accidentally provoked a slightly more powerful clan, and he directly tied me up and sent me to the other party’s residence. When I was at the other party’s disposal, did he ever consider the relationship between father and son?

“Hmph, back then, if it wasn’t for my intelligence and the fact that I knew how to endure humiliation and burden, and that I was finally able to survive under the endless torture of that Fang clan, did he ever miss me at that time? Did he ever come to visit me? I’m afraid that at that time, I had already become an abandoned child in his hands in order to quell the fury of that Fang clan, right?

“At that time, he did not care about my life or death at all. Now that I’ve become stronger, he misses me. Does he have to care about the relationship between father and son?”

“What a joke! What a big joke!”

Xue Dong King sneered, but his voice was unusually cold.

“Scram. Go back and tell him that I’ve already broken off my relationship with him. Tell him to stop bothering me in the future. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!” Xue Dong King waved his sleeve, a terrifying aura that had already reached the level of an undying saint directly pressed down on the white-haired old man.

The white-haired old man’s expression changed drastically, and he forcefully endured the pressure, he continued, “Seventh young master, the clan has encountered a great crisis this time. No matter what grudges you have with the clan leader, I beg you, on account of the fact that you share the same bloodline, no matter what, you must lend a hand.”

“Lend a hand? If I don’t personally exterminate them, it’s already very worthy of them.” Xue Dong King snorted coldly, but he was already completely enraged in his heart.

He waved his hand, and a majestic force immediately acted on the white-haired elder.

The white-haired elder was severely injured. He spat out a mouthful of blood and shot backward in a sorry state. In the blink of an eye, he had already disappeared in front of Xue Dong King.

Although the white-haired elder was sent flying, Xue Dong King’s anger did not completely disappear in the palace. The entire palace was still under great pressure and did not calm down for a long time. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
