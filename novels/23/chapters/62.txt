Chapter 63: The Fourth Level

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“On the first floor, the opponent I met was good at axemanship, but he did not comprehend any of the Essense Realm of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, it was easy to defeat him.” Jian Wushuang thought privately, then he entered the second floor.

The opponent he faced on the second floor had comprehended a trace of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. It was the Gale Essence, but only the initial stage, so Jian Wushuang still defeated him easily.

On the third floor, Jian Wushuang faced a much stronger opponent. After all, one must pass through the third level, at the least, to enter Dragon Palace. Naturally, it was more difficult.

“Go to hell!”

An ice-cold sword light flashed before disappearing in an instant.

In the end, Jian Wushuang defeated him with the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship.

on the fourth floor, Jian Wushuang’s opponent was a black-clothed elder, who held a Purple Soft-Sword in his hand.

CHUU!

Another ice-cold sword light flashed. Once again, it was the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.

“Formless Swordsmanship?” The black-clothed elder smiled slightly and said, “What a coincidence, I can use the Sword Essence of Gale too.”

The same ice-cold dazzling sword light appeared in the black-clothed elder’s hand.

They were brandishing two of the same sword shadows with the same sword essence. Not only that, both of them released nearly the same spiritual power because the opponent was from the Dragon Gate.

Clang!

The two sword edges met.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was astonished and downcast. He could clearly tell that the swordsmanship used by the grey-clothed elder was faster than his, even if it was only by a little.

“His comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale is higher than mine.” Jian Wushuang realized immediately.

“Sword-killing Movement,” Jian Wushuang followed with the second move of Anonymous Swordsmanship.

“Haha, it’s useless. In the Dragon Gate, the real test is in your comprehension of Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. Martial arts technique and swordsmanship don’t make a big difference here. Besides, I can use Sword-killing Movement too.” The killing intent from the purple soft-sword in the black-clothed elder’s hand exploded, attacking with a sword light which was equal to the one Jian Wushuang released.

Once again, two equal sword lights met, and the black-clothed elder suppressed him again.

“Little Boy, give it up. You are too weak in the Sword Principle of Gale to pass the fourth level,” the black-clothed elder said with a smile.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang’s expression became serious, then he said, “What about this move?”

After saying that, a heavy sword essence was released. Jian Wushuang swung his long sword with great momentum.

“It’s… Earth Sword Essence?” The black-clothed elder’s expression changed.

It’s not easy to comprehend the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. Comprehending one was difficult, to comprehend two at the same time was much more difficult. Yang Zaixuan, who passed through the eighth level just now, was a super genius that comprehended two at the same time.

The black-clothed elder didn’t expect that the little guy standing in front of him, who was under 20 years old, not only had a high level of comprehension in the Sword Essence of Gale, but also comprehended Earth Sword Essence at the same time.

Hum~~~

A sword shadow with great momentum rushed straight towards him, as if it could chop up a mountain.

After perceiving the great amount of power contained in the sword shadow, the black-clothed elder’s countenance changed a little. He didn’t fight back recklessly, quickly choosing to dodge it instead. However, before the elder could use his sword to attack, Jian Wushuang changed his sword essence again.

He used the Sword Essence of Gale along with the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.

“He can shift between the Sword Essences of Gale and Earth so easily?” The black-clothed elder was surprised and smiled bitterly.

The Sword Essences of Earth and Gale. One was massive and majestic with power and influence, while the other was flexible and visionary. If he could perfectly transition between them, these two sword essences would produce a terrible power which the grey-clothed elder could not oppose.

The Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate, passed!

As for the fifth level, the opponent Jian Wushuang faced also comprehended the Sword Essence of Earth. Not only that, he was stronger than Jian Wushuang in Sword Essence of Earth comprehension and used it more freely. Jian Wushuang tried his best, fighting with him for quite a while. But finally, he was defeated, causing him to stop at the fifth level.

When Jian Wushuang walked out of the Golden Pavilion, all the experts of Dragon Palace that were waiting outside looked at him.

“Passing through the Fourth Level is good enough, so he is qualified to enter Dragon Palace. However, there is a large gap in skill between him and Yang Zaixuan.”

“An extraordinary genius like Yang Zaixuan is rare. It is impossible to come by two in a single day.”

Everyone in the area was secretly discussing it.

“Little guy, what’s your name and how old are you?” Palace Master White walked to him and asked directly.

“Swordsman,” said Jian Wushuang, still chose to use this pseudonym, “17 years old.”

“17 years old?”

Everyone in the area was astonished, including both of the palace masters. then, Palace Master White smiled and said, “haha, good. It seems that we have one more genius.”

“It’s rare for a 17-year-old kid to pass through the Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate. You could be ranked between middle and upper among the many disciples in Dragon Palace.” Palace Master Black, who stayed silent, nodded in agreement.

“Ye Rufeng, you brought a good disciple to Dragon Palace.” Palace Master White looked over at Ye Rufeng.

“I just did my duty,” said Ye Rufeng, remaining humble.

“Yang Zaixuan, Swordsman, from now on, you are both disciples of Dragon Palace. Congratulations for becoming one of the many Monsters in Tianzong Dynasty,” said Palace Master White with a laugh.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan stood side by side. After hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and Yang Zaixuan was indifferent as always.

“Come with me. I will take you to visit Dragon Palace,” said Palace Master White, intending to escort both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.

Suddenly, the surroundings totally calmed down.

A white-haired man wearing white, slowly walked into the people’s sights.

“His hair is as white as snow, the strongest genius, Bai Cheng!”

“The strongest disciple in Dragon Palace!”

“It’s him. he actually appeared.”

As he approached, all the disciples of Dragon Palace watched him with grim looks on their faces.

“Is he Bai Cheng?” Jian Wushuang slightly squinted his eyes while hearing Bai Cheng’s name mentioned in their discussion.

“The strongest person in Dragon Palace?” Yang Zaixuan raised his head and saw the white figure, with cold and prideful eyes, walking slowly in their direction.

The white-haired man in white stopped. His black eyes, full of arrogance, swept over them as the sides of his mouth stretched upwards to form a meaningful smile.

“I heard that a newcomer passed through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate today, so I wanted to see for myself.”
