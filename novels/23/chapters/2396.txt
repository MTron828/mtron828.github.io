Chapter 2397: Saint’s Tomb

Outer Court, inside the courtyard where Jian Wushuang lived.

“Jian Wushuang.” Elder Wujian appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Elder Wujian, it’s rare for you to visit me. What’s going on? Have you got news of those materials that I asked for your help to look out for?” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at Elder Wujian.

“The materials that you are looking for are extremely rare. How could I possibly locate them in such a short time? I came to see you today for something else. Jian Wushuang, have you heard of the Saint’s Tomb?” Elder Wujian had a straight face.

“Saint’s Tomb?” Jian Wushuang’s heart shook.

He stayed in the Blazing Moon City as a teenager in his current life and liked reading biographies which mentioned many special places in the Wusha Wilderness, dangerous places, and so on.

At the same time, those biographies also recorded some Peak Experts.

The Saint’s Tomb was one of the places Jian Wushuang came across in a biography.

“I’ve heard of the Saint’s Tomb. It seems to be a place where a Wusha Wilderness Peak Expert left behind a long time ago,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, but it’s not a long time. It was only three to four hundred thousand years ago. At that time, Wusha Wilderness’s situation was almost the same as now. The major sects were presented with the Great Compassion Sect was still recognized as the top sect at that time. The only difference was that although the Great Compassion Sect was extremely tyrannical, there was someone else with an even more terrifying existence in the Wusha Wilderness. That person’s existence was so overbearing that even the Great Compassion Sect was respectful of him and didn’t dare to provoke the person!”

“That person was the Crimson Stone Saint!” said Elder Wujian.

Jian Wushuang knew everything in his heart.

He had read some legends about the Saint’s Tomb and knew a little of the Crimson Stone Saint.

Crimson Stone Saint. In order to obtain the Saint title, he was naturally an Undying Saint!

During the Ancient God Domain days, a cultivator first became a God then a Transform God, Pure Yang, Chaotic, and above the Chaotic was the Divine Demon! Above the Divine Demon Realm was the Ultimate God.

The Undying Saint was beyond the Ultimate Gods.

Such an expert was regarded as someone prominent even in the entire Ancient God Domain. A real expert was highly regarded no matter where he was.

An Undying Saint would naturally be the absolute powerhouse in the small Wusha Wilderness.

Although the Great Compassion Sect was great, and Undying Saint could easily destroy anything with a flip of his hand. Therefore, the Great Compassion Sect naturally would be respectful of the Crimson Stone Saint.

“The Crimson Stone Saint was born in the Wusha Wilderness, but when he became a First-Class Divine Demon, he left the Wusha Wilderness, and went to roam the outside world. When he returned again, he was already a lofty Undying Saint and probably was the only Undying Saint born in the Wusha Wilderness in these hundreds of thousands of years,” commented Elder Wujian admiringly.

Undying Saint had an immortal body and such cultivation level was hard to attain. There were countless cultivators in the Wusha Wilderness, but it was already considered good to be able to produce an Undying Saint in the hundreds of thousands of years.

For some small territories, there might not even be one Undying Saint in millions of years.

“After the Crimson Stone Saint returned to the Wusha Wilderness, he stayed in the Wusha Wilderness for a long time, but his condition did not seem well. He was in a weakened state. At that time, many experts in the Wusha Wilderness thought that the Crimson Stone Saint must have sustained serious injuries or been poisoned to the point of beyond salvation. He had only stayed in the Wusha Wilderness for a few thousand years. After a few thousand years, there was news that the Crimson Stone Saint had fallen!”

At that time, all the sects and countless experts in the Wusha Wilderness felt sorry for the Crimson Stone Saint. However, three hundred thousand years after the Crimson Stone Saint died, which was approximately tens of thousands of years ago, someone accidentally found the Saint’s Tomb that he left behind!”

This Saint’s Tomb was the cemetery of Crimson Stone Saint. He knew that he wouldn’t live long, so he created it during the time he stayed in the Wusha Wilderness. He had accumulated many treasures and countless opportunities in his life and buried them within the tomb.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After the Saint’s Tomb was discovered, various sects of Wusha Wilderness and countless experts had gone crazy! Everyone was eager to enter the tomb and obtain the many treasures left behind. Unfortunately, the Saint’s Tomb was specially prepared for the younger cultivators. There are restrictions in the tomb and those above Ultimate Gods couldn’t enter at all. Even Peak Stage Divine Demons had to suffer quite a lot once they entered the tomb.”

“Therefore, the only ones who could enter the Saint’s Tomb were those below the Peak Stage Divine Demons level.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes strangely flashed.

“The Crimson Stone Saint knew that he was about to die, but before he died, he left behind a Saint’s Tomb? It’s also specially prepared for the younger generation. The purpose of him doing this...was perhaps not merely for the benefit of the cultivator in his hometown. I’m guessing he was probably also looking for a suitable heir?” mumbled Jian Wushuang under his breath.

He had experienced many of those caves and tombs that were left behind by experts in his previous life. They usually had their personal agendas for leaving those caves or tombs behind. In many cases, they wanted to find a suitable heir. The Crimson Stone Saint was probably not an exception.

Jian Wushuang even guessed that the saint had probably left part of his consciousness behind in the tomb.

“Elder Wujian, you came to me today and talked about the Saint’s Tomb. Is the Saint’s Tomb about to open?” asked Jian Wushuang.

Elder Wujian nodded. “Yes. The Saint’s Tomb opens every thousand years, and it has been exactly a thousand years since the last time it was opened. It will be opened again in a month’s time. There have been discussions among the sects that each sect has some quotas on the number of candidates that could be sent to enter the tombs according to their strengths. Narcissus Island has ten quotas. The Lord and elders had a discussion of who would enter the tomb. You are among one of the ten.”

“Am I?” Jian Wushuang looked weird.

He knew his identity of being only an outer disciple of Narcissus Island and he had hardly shown his strength in front of people. There were not many people who knew of his strengths and they would never spread the news.

Under such circumstances, how could he possibly be nominated?

Jian Wushuang knew that Elder Wujian probably fought for his place.

“Elder Wujian. Although you are one of the elders of the Circle of Elders, the seats to enter the Saint’s Tomb wouldn’t come easy. It must have been a tough fight for me to be one of the conquerors,” asked Jian Wushuang in a straightforward manner.

“It’s not easy, but the effort pays off. Anyway, the candidates are now decided. One month later, you can go to the Saint’s Tomb with the other nine core disciples,” said Elder Wujian.
