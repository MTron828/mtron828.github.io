Chapter 3002: The King Was Furious

——

“He’s dead!”

“I killed a rank two True Saint after consuming five drops of the god-burning poison.”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and looked calmly at the place where Holy Master Huocang had disappeared. He was quite excited.

120 years ago, when he met a rank two True Saint, he could barely fight him even if he used all his skills.

But now, he had met a rank two True Saint. He did not even use many of his trump cards. For example, he did not guide the sword intent in the Blood Mountain Sword, nor did he use the Mountain River Map. He just relied on his secret technique and the sword technique he created, he easily killed Holy Master Huocang.

Of course, the most important thing was the sword technique he created.

“I’ve studied it for 120 years, and I’ve created two sword skills. One of them, ‘Evening Elephant’, is based on strength and power, but its level is only at the second level. However, ‘Star Dream’ is my biggest achievement in the past 120 years. It’s a real third-level secret skill, and it’s based on tearing and cutting. It can bring my battle strength to the maximum.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

The absolute arts created by the Immortal Saint were divided into many levels.

Just like the seventh level of the Immortal Saint, the absolute arts were also divided into seven levels.

The second-level absolute arts were usually created by a second-level True Saint, and many second-level True Saints were not qualified to create such absolute arts.

And the third level absolute arts were undoubtedly created by a third level True Saint.

Of course, Jian Wushuang was not a rank three true saint, but he was able to create Star Dream because his comprehension of space-time principles and sword principle had reached the level of a rank three True Saint, with the help of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual and the void swordsmanship, he was able to create this move.

This move was indeed extremely terrifying.

“The Star Dream swordsmanship alone is enough to kill an ordinary rank two True Saint. If I guide the sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword, my strength will soar again. By then, even if I encounter a rank two Peak True Saint, I should be able to suppress him. Of course, if I encounter a rank three True Saint, I’m afraid I won’t be able to fight him.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

With a wave of his hand, he took away the treasures left behind by Holy Master Huocang and his interspatial ring. Then, he turned around and left to find his next target.

What Jian Wushuang did not know was that the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had been completely shaken.

…

The Magic Note Divine Kingdom occupied a total of 36 realms and was extremely powerful.

The nest of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom was in the center of the 36 realms, on a floating land.

On that piece of land, there were countless palaces and pavilions. The grand atmosphere was endless.

In the very center, at the peak of the Great Divine Mountain, a palace that was completely constructed from light purple crystals stood there.

At this moment, in this purple palace, a purple-robed elder was kneeling respectfully. There was not a single human figure in front of him. There was only a towering purple statue. Although that purple statue was a human figure, it was extremely blurry…it was impossible to see its appearance clearly.

“King, Holy Lord Huocang is dead.” The purple-robed elder said respectfully. He did not even dare to raise his head.

The purple-robed elder’s voice rang out in the palace, but there was no response for a short period of time.

After a while…

“Huocang…that little fellow, his master, is a good brother who followed me to conquer the world. Back then, in order to establish the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, I led all my brothers to battle for a full 100,000 years. During these 100,000 years of battle, 70-80% of those brothers died. There weren’t many left. Huocang’s master also died as a result.”

“When he died, his master begged me to take care of his disciple for him. But now that Huocang is dead, how can I face that old brother?”

A hoarse and deep voice sounded in the hall.

The voice seemed ordinary, but it contained endless dignity. The kneeling purple-robed old man did not even dare to breathe.

After a while, the hoarse voice sounded again, “Find out who did it?”

“We are investigating, but according to the information we have now, the person who killed Holy Master Huocang should be the same person who killed the six-level one True Saints under the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. He is wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, so we can be sure that he is an expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. In addition, this Heaven-cleaving Alliance expert is acting strangely. He likes to hide his aura and disguise himself as a Holy Master,” said the purple-robed elder.

“He killed six level one True Saints of my Magic Note Divine Kingdom in one breath, and he even killed Huocang. No matter who he is, he is unforgivable.” A hoarse voice sounded. “Go, find him and kill him!”

“Yes!”

The purple-robed elder nodded respectfully and immediately stood up to leave.

After the purple-robed elder left, the huge divine hall once again fell silent.

After walking out of the Divine Hall, the purple-robed old man who was kneeling respectfully and did not even dare to breathe had completely changed his appearance.

His gaze was ice-cold, his aura was cold, and his face also carried a certain amount of dignity.

As soon as he walked out of the Divine Hall, many experts immediately surrounded him.

“The king has already ordered that no matter who that person is, find him and kill him!” The purple-robed old man’s voice was ice-cold.

“Yes, sir.” The surrounding experts all replied in unison, their killing intent soaring to the skies.

“In addition, this person is from the heaven cleaving union. From the looks of it, he has accepted a mission from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. This mission might require him to kill a batch of experts from my Magic Note Divine Kingdom, and it should be those who have sinned. Pass down the order, tell the experts under my Magic Note Divine Kingdom to be careful during this period of time, especially those who have sinned.” The purple-robed elder instructed.

“Yes.” Everyone nodded.

Soon, the high-level experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom began to be tempted.

…

In a flash, it was already the seventh day since Jian Wushuang killed Holy Master Huocang.

Now, Jian Wushuang had arrived in another domain.

In a huge mansion, it was originally peaceful and quiet. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

But suddenly… Boom!

A terrifying boom suddenly sounded, immediately breaking the silence of this world.

Whoosh!

A figure dashed out of the mansion and fled into the void as fast as he could.

“You want to escape?!”

A cold shout echoed.

Another four figures rushed out and chased after him at an amazing speed.

“Good lord, there are three experts hiding in a mansion. Two of them are at the peak of the second rank, and the last one is a third rank True Saint. How ruthless!”

Although Jian Wushuang was wearing a mask, his expression under the mask was quite interesting.

He glanced at the four people behind him. The aura they emitted was extremely shocking.
