Chapter 2884: Guiding Sword Essence

——

“I can’t block it anymore!” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

Clang!

A purple spear pierced the Blood Mountain Sword, causing it to slightly change its direction. The other Purple Spear, which pierced out simultaneously, grazed the Blood Mountain Sword and suddenly stabbed toward Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Jian Wushuang could not resist it, but before the Purple Spear touched his divine body, a Purple Emperor Bell appeared.

The Purple Emperor Bell formed a layer of purple energy shield in front of Jian Wushuang. As the Purple Spear stabbed toward him, the energy shield only lasted for a moment before it cracked.

“The Purple Emperor Bell is still a top-tier heavenly treasure. Unfortunately, it can’t withstand the attack of the Immortal Saint with the saint treasure.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

After breaking the energy shield of the Purple Emperor Bell, the Purple Spear continued to stab at Jian Wushuang.

However, because the Purple Spear had weakened too much, it could not even break the dark golden armor on Jian Wushuang’s body.

However, Jian Wushuang was still in a terrible situation. It was not easy for him to stabilize his body.

When he looked up again, he saw that the World Master, the Temple Master, and Elder Su had surrounded him in a triangle.

“It’s tough for me to fight against three Immortal Saints at once. They didn’t use their full strength just now, but I’m still at an absolute disadvantage. So I can only use that move to fight them.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. A faint sword essence had already risen.

This sword essence seemed weak and did not have much power, but it instantly surged into the Blood Mountain Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

There was a supreme sword essence hidden in the Blood Mountain Sword.

The supreme sword essence was extremely powerful, but now Jian Wushuang had already begun to guide it.

Boom!

The terrifying sword essence directly exploded in the Blood Mountain Sword.

The power of this sword essence was not too strong, but it was extraordinary.

It was a supreme sword essence that carried a shocking will.

The sword essence swept across the world, and all the ants in the world were ants.

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword tightly and felt the supreme sword essence that burst out from the Blood Mountain Sword. He even felt that all the people in the world were subservient to him. At this moment, he was the king of billions of sword principles.

World Master Tian Qu, Temple Master Tian Xu, and Elder Su, surrounding him, immediately sensed the sword essence.

“This sword essence…”

“It’s so powerful and transcendent!”

“As expected, the sword principle treasure refined by Mo Tao is the divine sword in this kid’s hand!”

Elder Su’s eyes were abnormally hot.

The three Immortal Saints had made reasonable arrangements before they attacked. The Blood Mountain Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand was his.

Therefore, the more powerful the sword was, the happier he would be.

“Kill him!” Realm Lord Tian Qu shouted in a low voice. Endless destructive power surged out from his body, but he attacked again.

Elder Su and the Heavenly Void Temple master did not hesitate. They immediately went forward.

The three Immortal Saints attacked again.

Boom!

This time, both of Realm Lord Tian Qu’s hands were filled with black divine power, but both of his hands attacked Jian Wushuang crazily.

Elder Su held the golden long stick tightly in his hands. This time, the long stick fell from the sky and smashed toward Jian Wushuang.

As for the four arms of the Heavenly Void Temple master, each of them held a Purple Spear. The Purple Spear was like purple lightning, shooting toward Jian Wushuang.

Although the three Immortal Saints still had some trump cards that they had not used, their strength as Immortal Saints had burst out.

Their attacks were also extremely terrifying, which made the countless cultivators in the market speechless.

However, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light, and his supreme sword essence instantly soared.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang let out an angry shout and slashed out with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

This sword carried a shocking power and brought out Jian Wushuang’s power and comprehension of sword principle to the fullest. He also guided the supreme sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword to the greatest extent.

The sword essence of Blood Mountain Sword was too strong. With Jian Wushuang’s current ability, he could only guide less than one-thousandth of it.

But even if it was less than one-thousandth of its power, it was enough to increase the power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship by more than ten times!

Boom!

A huge sword light that blotted out the sky appeared out of thin air.

This sword light was extremely resplendent and attracted everyone’s attention the moment it appeared.

At the same time, everyone could feel the terrifying power contained within this sword light that could destroy everything and tear apart the heavens and earth.

This power even caused the eyes of the three Immortal Saints who had already unleashed their attacks to shrink.

“This power… be careful!” Elder Su shouted.

In an instant, the three of them switched from attacking to defending. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The three of them attacked together, trying to block this earth-shaking sword light.

The strength of the Immortal Saint was not undeserved. Under the combined attack of the three of them, the sword light was finally blocked. However, the power of the sword light was so strong that it still forced the three of them to retreat a long distance, and even made them look a bit embarrassed.

“The sword essence did not disappoint me.”

Jian Wushuang looked at all of this with a hint of excitement in his eyes.

He knew that the sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword was very powerful. Even if it only guided less than one-thousandth of its power, it could still make the power of his swordsmanship soar.

He had tried it before, and the power of the swordsmanship had increased by more than ten times.

However, he had never really guided the sword essence to fight with others, and this was the first time.

This was the first time he had displayed the power of this sword intent, and its power was indeed shocking.

“Now that I’m using my full strength, my divine power is slightly stronger than ordinary Immortal Saints, and with the guidance of sword intent, the power of my sword technique will increase by more than ten times. Under such a premise, even if my comprehension of the rules, understanding of the sword principle, and even my absolute arts are inferior to Immortal Saints, it’s still enough to fight with Immortal Saints head-on!”

“Even if it’s one against three, I’m not afraid at all!”

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent surged and his supreme sword essence swept out in all directions.

He faced the three Immortal Saints alone with one sword and did not show any fear at all. Instead, he directly charged out at this moment. The world-shaking and terrifying battle intent from his body made many cultivators in the market who were watching the battle cry out in surprise.

It was hard to imagine that a mere Divine Master could still have such a shocking battle intent when facing the three Immortal Saints.

His battle intent and that unstoppable momentum had even completely suppressed the three Immortal Saints!
