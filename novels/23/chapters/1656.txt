1657 Being Killed Instead

Jian Wushuang stood in the dark void. He was staring at the black, giant hammer which contained an infinite amount of Thunderbolt Power, as well as the nine crimson giant dragons which were both aimed at him.

He could feel the power that the two attacks were releasing clearly.

“Haha. Two Chaotic Real Gods have teamed up straight away and used their full power from the get-go. They really think highly of me,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently. However, a vast amount of Divine Power containing Ancient God Power had already risen from his body.

Buzz~~~ Jian Wushuang changed into a one-hundred foot tall Ancient God body and there were six stars on the space between his eyebrows.

“Universal Laws!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned imposing and many Ancient God shadows appeared behind him.

Similarly, those Ancient God shadows were extremely huge. They were standing behind Jian Wushuang and there were hundreds of them.

The shadows were all staring strongly. With a wave of Jian Wushuang’s big hands, the Ancient God shadows behind him also swung their palms at the same time.

Rumble!!

Hundreds of palm prints attacked at the same time.

When a palm print attacked alone, it was not very powerful. However, the key point was that there were many of them. In no time, the hundreds of palm prints clashed with the black giant hammer and the nine crimson giant dragons.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

Fierce booming sounds shook the heavens and Real God Xue Ling, as well as Real God Gu Ying, were completely swallowed up by the palm prints.

The nine crimson giant dragons that Real God Xue Ling unleashed were dissipated by the attack and Real God Gu Ying’s crimson giant hammer attack was repelled.

However, at that moment, Jian Wushuang who was originally standing in his original position, dashed forward fiercely.

Thousands upon thousands of shadows burst forth at the same time. Jian Wushuang’s body was like a ghost and he appeared behind Real God Gu Ying in an instant.

“Eh?” Real God Gu Ying’s expression changed slightly as he had already sensed Jian Wushuang’s body behind him.

Jian Wushuang’s body was covered with a dark golden light and he was emitting a great amount of power. With his left hand holding his sword, he raised his right hand slowly and his index finger pointed toward Real God Gu Ying from afar.

When he stuck out his finger, the void collapsed straight away.

An ancient, pitch black, giant hand, which contained frightening power, appeared out of thin air and attacked Real God Gu Ying fiercely.

Although Real God Gu Ying was a Chaotic Real God, he could not help but feel fearful at that moment.

“This power…”

Real God Gu Ying gritted his teeth and he raised his black giant hammer, which contained an infinite amount of Thunderbolt Power, again. With a rustling sound, the Thunderbolt Power shattered the void and everything else into pieces. It then changed into a Thunder God Hammer and struck the approaching giant finger.

Bam!

A giant black hole appeared out of thin air. The black hole contained a great amount of Thunderbolt Power which was dancing in it, and it looked just like a Thunder Prison.

However, in the Thunder Prison, a ray of black light was glowing even more brilliantly and by going along Real God Gu Ying’s arm, it struck his body directly.

“Puff!”

Real God Gu Ying gave a groan and his expression turned ghastly pale. Moreover, his body had also retreated quickly.

It was only after a long time that he regained his posture.

“What a great power. Even though I unleashed my strongest move, I was still pushed back?” Real God Gu Ying had already opened his eyes wide and he was filled with fear.

“Gu Ying, be careful!” a strict cry could be heard.

“What!?” Real God Gu Ying’s expression changed greatly as he had already seen the ghost-like shadow which had appeared behind him at some point in time. Moreover, the shadow had already swung the long sword on his hands. With that, an icy-cold sword light ripped open the void mercilessly and headed for his head.

It was too close to him and its speed was too fast. As such, Real God Gu Ying did not have the ability to dodge the attack.

Swish!

Real God Gu Ying’s head was sent flying. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Before his consciousness dissipated completely, Real God Gu Ying was still filled with disbelief, “How can his speed be so fast?”

He did not know that Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine had already cleared the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace. On top of that, by unleashing his attack with Chaotic Real God-level Divine Power, he would be more powerful than many of the top Chaotic Real Gods. Since Real God Gu Ying did not know about this, Jian Wushuang naturally exceeded his expectations.

In just an extremely short period of time, Real God Gu Ying, who was filled with murderous intent, and who had wanted to kill Jian Wushuang moments ago, was dead.

“Run!”

“I have to run away quickly!”

Upon witnessing the death of Real God Gu Ying, Real God Xue Ling suppressed his fears and escaped immediately.

He had always been far away from Jian Wushuang. Moreover, he was proficient in speed. On top of that, he reacted straight away by unleashing his Secret Skill to escape. As such, even Jian Wushuang was unable to give chase and he could only look on as Real God Xue Ling’s body disappeared.

“Even though they are merely two normal Chaotic Real Gods, they still dared to lay their hands on me. They are really quite gutsy,” Jian Wushuang sneered and he came beside Real God Gu Ying’s body immediately. With a wave of his hands, he destroyed Real God Gu Ying’s body. As for Real God Gu Ying’s treasures and Qian Kun Ring, they naturally landed in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

After Jian Wushuang scanned through Real God Gu Ying’s Qian Kun Ring, he became disappointed.

“Even though he is a Chaotic Real God, he only has these few items? Moreover, he has only obtained six Demon Cores? Not to mention, they are all Grade One Demon Cores.”

Jian Wushuang was not interested in the treasures in Real God Gu Ying’s Qian Kun Ring. Although he was a normal Chaotic Real God, all his items amounted to one to two hundred Doctrine Gems. However, Jian Wushuang was not too concerned with that.

He was more concerned about the Demon Cores!

It was obvious that six Grade One Demon Cores were unable to satisfy him. However, it was still considered a gain.

“After getting Real God Gu Ying’s Qian Kun Ring, by taking into account his Demon Cores and converting his Demon Spirits into Demon Cores, I currently have a total of twenty-eight Grade One Demon Cores, two Grade Two Demon Cores and a Grade Three Demon Core. With this number of Demon Cores, I should be able to raise my Ultimate Divine Power by quite a bit.”

Jian Wushuang could not help but clench his fists. Filled with excitement, Jian Wushuang left the battlefield immediately. In a split second, he opened up a simple cave on a dark mountain and started to absorb the pure power within the Demon Spirits as well as Demon Cores.

…

From the vast void, Real God Xue Ling had been escaping miserably. It was only after running for an hour’s time and confirming that Jian Wushuang had stopped chasing him that he stopped.

“That Jian Wushuang has actually become so strong?” Real God Xue Ling’s eyes were still filled with shock.

It should be known that when Real God Gu Ying and he had decided to lay their hands on Jian Wushuang, they had made nothing of him.

They had seen the Three-Horned Star Demon that Jian Wushuang had killed. However, in their eyes, they felt that Jian Wushuang had used some special means such as the famous Secret Skill of Star Palace of the Lineage of Star.

In the end, Jian Wushuang was merely a Void Real God.

However, in actual fact, that was obviously not the case.
