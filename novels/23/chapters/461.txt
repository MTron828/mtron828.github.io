Chapter 462: Fury

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt was a kind of thunderbolt. Its power was much greater than that of Purple Heaven Thunderbolt.

Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt was also extraordinarily violent. Usually, a single flash could eviscerate a novice lord.

Refining Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt into a bead to concentrate its power would result in even more massive destruction.

Jian Wushuang had exploited Demonic Grenade once in the Nanyang Continent. At that time, he had refined the Thunderbolt to a bead so that its power could explode instantly. However, Demonic Grenade’s power paled in comparison to Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt.

“That’s Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt!”

A few lords from both camps who were nearby also noticed it. When they realized that Myriad Islands Lord had thrown a Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt bead, they were terrified and were worried for Jian Wushuang.

A Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt bead explosion next to an advanced lord would kill him easily. Even a superior lord would suffer terrible injuries unless his physical strength matched the Black Yuan Lord’s.

However, Jian Wushuang was only in the Saint Realm. It was almost impossible for him to survive the Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt.

“Boy, you are only in the Saint Realm. You should feel lucky to be killed by a Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt bead. ”

The Myriad Islands Lord smiled coldly. It seemed that he was picturing Jian Wushuang’s demise by the Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt.

Myriad Islands Lord’s move was unexpected.

The Drifting-blood Marquis camp were aware that the Pale Moon Marquis would seek a chance to attack Jian Wushuang. That was why the Black Yuan Lord, the Iron Saber Lord and the Loftiness Lord worked together to protect him. However, no one had expected that the Pale Moon Marquis would be so cunning.

They had let the Demon Soul Lord, a superior lord, distract him while the Myriad Islands Lord sneaked up on him.

This ruse had worked well.

The Demon Soul Lord had been held back by the Iron Saber Lord and the Loftiness Lord for a short moment, but no one was able to stop Myriad Islands Lord’s Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt bead.

These events unfolded so quickly that Jian Wushuang wasn’t able to respond immediately. When he realized the danger and wanted to escape, it was already too late. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Go to hell!”

The Myriad Islands Lord roared. The Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt emitted dazzling silver light and exploded.

A tremendous power erupted in the palace.

The explosion rocked the big cave mansion with a deafening and terrifying noise.

The energy released was strong enough to easily outclass and kill an advanced lord.

Being less than a meter away from the explosion, Jian Wushuang was exposed to more than 90% of its power.

Boom ~~~ Visible residual waves from the explosion billowed from its epicenter and propagated through the palace, affecting most of the lords. Many had to close their eyes.

After a long time, the palace settled down.

Things came to a close.

The lords of both camps looked at the place where Jian Wushuang had been.

“Is he dead?”

Everyone was thinking the same thing.

“Swordsman,” the Iron Saber Lord’s face was clouded over.

“Look, look at this Blood River, it is still here,” a lord of the Drifting-blood Marquis camp suddenly said.

Everyone immediately looked at the Blood River which was still there. It continued to emit the aura, which had not weakened. Instead, it was still rolling.

“What’s going on here?”

“The Blood River didn’t disappear? Is Swordsman still alive? He didn’t die, did he?”

“Still alive?”

The lords of both camps were incredulous.

Was he still alive? Was it possible?

“Hmm?” the Myriad Islands Lord squinted.

The smoke from the explosion had cleared and a figure gradually appeared.

He carried a longsword. The clothes on his upper body were split. His skin was darkened, which gave him a wild appearance. Meanwhile, the right side of his body drew attention. It looked slightly red and there were a few tiny wounds on it, but they were obviously superficial injuries.

“How is it possible?” the Myriad Islands Lord was shocked.

“Impossible!” the Demon Soul Lord couldn’t help yelling.

All the lords of both camps who witnessed this were astonished.

He didn’t die, did he?

He wasn’t even really injured. There were only a few insignificant wounds on the right side of his body.

How was he able to do that?

“The power of Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt is intense. If I had been in Jian Wushuang’s place, I wouldn’t have been seriously hurt, it would definitely mess me up. It is impossible not to sustain any nasty injuries, but this little guy...” the Black Yuan Lord looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise as a thought suddenly appeared in his mind.?“What if his body is stronger than mine?”

He was not aware that when Jian Wushuang was inside the Universal Thunderbolt Pool in Bei Mo Marquis Cave Mansion, he had already absorbed 37 Purple Heaven Thunderbolts. Now his body was on par with a superior second-grade magic weapon.

Even among the lords, Jian Wushuang was already incredible. Although the Black Yuan Lord was ranked first among numerous lords of the two camps, his physical strength was just good enough to reach the requirement of a superior second-grade magic weapon. Compared to Jian Wushuang, he was inferior.

In the palace, the lords of both camps were shocked speechless.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang’s expression was glacial and he was filled with fury.

In the icy depth of his eyes, rage burned.

“Demon Soul Lord and Myriad Islands Lord!”

“You two got a good trick.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice filled the palace. Its cold tone was reminiscent of December’s frost.

The sneaky attack that the Demon Soul Lord and the Myriad Islands Lord had launched infuriated Jian Wushuang.

The Myriad Islands Lord snorted in response. “Actually, you are the good one. A Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt bead exploded near you, but it still couldn’t kill you. Little guy, you are so lucky!”

“I’m sorry that I disappointed you two,” Jian Wushuang said. “I am still alive, but I’m afraid you guys will die soon.”

As he finished his words, he suddenly waved his hand. A scarlet figure immediately popped up beside him.

The Blood Puppet had appeared.

Jian Wushuang took out ten Blood Gems and soon they were all swallowed by the Blood Puppet.

Ten Blood Gems would allow the Blood Puppet to show its full power once.

“Sword Ancestor created the Blood Puppet. I really want to know the extent of its power!” There was a severe expression in his eyes as Jian Wushuang pointed to the front.

“Blood Puppet, kill the two of them!”
