Chapter 1404: Amaze The World With A Single Brilliant Feat!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

At the border of Titanic Star, all the disciples were dumbfounded. They were all shocked.

Everyone’s gaze was fixed on Luo Quan as Luo Quan’s pathetic roar reverberated in their ears.

“Phantasmagoria, it’s phantasmagoria!” One of the disciples shouted.

Suddenly, everyone understood.

Looking at the sight before their eyes, Luo Quan was obviously in Jian Wushuang’s phantasmagoria. He couldn’t shake it off, he couldn’t free himself from it. He could only suffer under the effect of the phantasmagoria. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Such a scary phantasmagoria, even Luo Quan couldn’t shake it off!”

“What did he go into the phantasmagoria? How could he be in so much pain?”

The surrounding disciples were terrified.

What they didn’t know was that the reason the Eighteen Asura Hell that Real God Demonic Rain created was to torture. It was a method to torture one’s consciousness.

Eighteen Asura Hell had eighteen floors of dreamland in total. Every floor was a phantasmagoria of suffering.

Jian Wushuang was performing the first six floors.

Luo Quan drowned in the six floors of phantasmagoria and he was naturally suffering.

“No, no!”

His pathetic groans continued but suddenly, it was as though Luo Quan’s tongue was removed. His words were blocked and they could barely hear noises from his nose. He seemed to be saying…

“Let me live, please. Show mercy!”

“Let me go, please. Let me go!”

That sight struck up terror.

The disciples were imagining just how scary the phantasmagoria was that was making Luo Quan beg for mercy.

In the Milky Way, Hall Master Yuan and the other ten deacon elderlies stood side by side as they watched the sight before them. Even the deacon elderlies were shocked.

“Previously, in the Supreme Tower, his consciousness attack couldn’t be performed as he was fighting against a war puppet. Now that he is facing a human cultivator, he could put many tricks to play. Just the phantasmagoria that he showed currently is impressive enough!”

“True. Luo Quan is a genius disciple in the Lineage of Star. He has high hopes of entering Star Palace. Although he isn’t as good at consciousness, he is at least at the level of an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven. But he begged for mercy in the phantasmagoria that Jian Wushuang put him in. To be able to do so, not only would it require Jian Wushuang to have a stronger consciousness than he does, but it also requires a terrifying dreamland technique!”

“I’m curious about what Luo Quan went through in the dreamland.”

The deacon elderlies conversed casually.

As dreamland was only aimed at one single person, only that particular person could experience the phantasmagoria in the dreamland. The others could only see Luo Quan in agony. He looked like he was suffering but no one knew what he was going through in the dreamland.

On Titanic Star, the disciples saw Luo Quan in pain and everyone gulped. Qu Yang, who was in the crowd, was terrified too.

“I already reminded Luo Quan to be careful of Jian Wushuang’s consciousness attack but in the end, he still failed,” Qu Yang shook his head and sighed.

Back when he had met Jian Wushuang in the Milky Way, he had fought with Jian Wushuang and he taught him a lesson. Hence, in the entire Lineage of Star, only he knew that Jian Wushuang’s power wasn’t as weak as it looked, especially his consciousness attack.

Hence, he had especially reminded Luo Quan earlier.

However, even with his reminder, Luo Quan still fell into Jian Wushuang’s dreamland and was unable to free himself from it.

On the other side, Lu Han’s face grew grave.

He finally knew why Hall Master Yuan and the other deacon elderlies had agreed that Jian Wushuang was stronger than him.

Even Luo Quan couldn’t withstand it and got struck by the phantasmagoria. If it was him, he would not be able to fight back either.

“Am I leaving Lineage of Star?”

Lu Han felt bitter.

In the middle of the battlefield, the veins on Luo Quan’s forehead and arms all popped up. He looked extremely ferocious.

He was still in the dreamland and he was suffering on the third floor of dreamland, Ironwood Hell.

Jian Wushuang was standing there with a cold expression.

“Qiu Yue, did you see that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, we saw, Mister. We saw.” There was an obvious excitement in Qiu Yue’s voice.

“That will do,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. He was too lazy to take another look at Luo Quan but he looked at the deacon elderly who was the host for the rotation battle, “Can you announce the result?”

The deacon elderly was stunned but immediately responded.

“I announce that, in this battle, Jian Wushuang is the winner!”

The deacon elderly announced the result straight away.

Of course, even if he didn’t, everyone at the scene could tell.

Luo Quan’s consciousness was drowning in the dreamland. He couldn’t shake it off. If Jian Wushuang were to take action then, he could have killed Luo Quan easily.

Jian Wushuang turned around and walked to the back after the announcement.

“Jian Wushuang, Luo Quan’s phantasmagoria…” The deacon elderly couldn’t help but say.

“Soon, he will come back to reality,” Jian Wushuang said and left without turning back.

As expected, Luo Quan who went through the six floors of dreamland slowly recovered.

However, even though his consciousness had recovered, he was still terrified.

“Jian, Jian Wushuang!!!”

Luo Quan stared at Jian Wushuang but there wasn’t any sort of denial. There was only terror.

No one knew how much indescribable torture he had gone through in the dreamland in a short period of time. The suffering was so real that he would never forget it for the rest of his life. It was the scariest dreamland he had encountered since he had started cultivation.

He definitely didn’t want to experience such a dreamland a second time.

Hence, he naturally didn’t dare to provoke Jian Wushuang again. He could only move back with some help from two other disciples.

In the first battle in the rotation battle, Jian Wushuang had won!

The result naturally shocked the surrounding disciples.

“Jian Wushuang defeated Luo Quan? He didn’t even move an inch. He only performed a dreamland technique and defeated Luo Quan. He was totally thrashed.”

“How could it be? Isn’t Jian Wushuang always weak?”

“Eight hundred years ago, when he first came to the Lineage of Star, any ordinary disciple could easily have trampled him.”

“Jian Wushuang improved tremendously in the past eight hundred years. His power increased so significantly but he never shows off. Even when all of us doubted his power and thought he wasn’t qualified to become a disciple of Star Palace, he never explained himself. During this battle, he proved himself to us with his power. His patience and endurance is next level!”

“Amazing the world with a single brilliant feat!”

“Jian Wushuang, impressive!”
