Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Unrealistic?”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “I never expected to kill him with my Soul Attack. I only wanted to catch him by surprise in order to create an opportunity for Duan Lingfeng. This is unrealistic?”

“Create an opportunity?” King of Venomous King was shocked, “If it was merely to merely create an opportunity, it might work!”

“If so, I shall give it a try. I happen to have yet to put the secret skill of Tian Yuan to play. Today, let’s try the power of the secret skill on this Sky Devourer.”

“However, with my current Soul Power, I can only pull off the secret skill of Tian Yuan once. If I were to create an opportunity for Duan Lingfeng with the secret skill, I could only run for my life after he was killed or severely injured.”

“In other words, I only have one chance!”

Jian Wushuang held his fists tight as his gaze grew solemn.

Then Jian Wushuang sent a message to Duan Lingfeng.

“Duan Lingfeng, I will create an opportunity for you. It will be rather short and it will pass almost instantly. You must grab this opportunity.” Jian Wushuang sent a short message.

Duan Lingfeng received the message as he was fighting against the man in the black robe. He looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Jian Wushuang was just a Universe God in the First Heaven after all.

He was able to create an opportunity for him.

Jian Wushuang didn’t explain further but started taking various measures.

Vroom!

A terrifying crimson flame erupted from Jian Wushuang.

The crimson flame formed a huge fire sea and filled the entire universe. Jian Wushuang was right at the core of the fire sea, as though he was the king in the fire sea.

The secret skill of Scarlet Kingdom was performed straightaway.

At the same time, the power of Stars within his body was triggered entirely!

If Scarlet Kingdom could merely increase the speed of Jian Wushuang’s attack, then the secret skill of Star… As the scariest and the most fundamental secret skill for Lineage of Star, not only can the secret skill of stars increase Jian Wushuang’s power by ten-fold in a short period of time, it could even enhance his Soul Attack by ten-fold.

Vroom vroom vroom.

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power was burning insanely with an enormous amount of Soul Power surging. His eyes turned cold as he stared at the two of them who were fighting before him.

The very next moment, his body suddenly charged forward.

The man in the black robe revealed his terrifying fighting power and he was fighting against Duan Lingfeng face-to-face ferociously.

During the fight, the man in the black robe had been keeping an eye on Jian Wushuang at the same time, After all, his target, his prey was Jian Wushuang. He naturally couldn’t let Jian Wushuang run away.

When Jian Wushuang charged forward, the man in the black robe noticed at the very moment.

“Asking for it!”

The man in the black robe immediately turned and charged towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked cold, but there was an absolute calmness in his faint gold eyes.

Blood Mountain Sword was in his hand when the man in the black robe turned to charge at him. Jian Wushuang wielded the sword subconsciously.

He looked like he wielded the sword and he really did swing out sword light. But in actual fact, it was just a cover-up to mislead his opponent. The true move lay in the Soul Power that Jian Wushuang transferred, with which he performed the secret skill of Tian Yuan!

“The first level of secret skill of Tian Yuan, Inextinguishable Light!”

Swoosh!

A bunch of light that was transformed solely by Soul Power and was sent out in silence.

Under the cover of the sword light, no one noticed.

Everyone on the scene, regardless if it was the man in the black robe, Duan Lingfeng, or even the Universe Gods on the spaceship afar, no one noticed the existence of the light bunch.

The light bunch was hidden among the sword light and charged towards the body of the man in the black robe.

The man in the black robe glared at Jian Wushuang with madness. When he saw the sword light that Jian Wushuang sent out, he looked at it in disdain.

“It is futile!”

Along with the loud thud and soaring fierceness, the man in the black robe laughed maliciously. He held his fist and smashed it over ferociously.

Hong!

The sword light that Jian Wushuang swung out shattered while part of the impact of the terrifying power from the punch landed on Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Poof!”

Jian Wushuang immediately spat a mouthful of blood. His face grew pale in that instant. However, it was merely part of the power. So, it was sufficient to kill him.

“Luckily, I am only affected by parts of the power. If I were to take a punch directly, even though my divine body was strong, I wouldn’t be able to take it. I would definitely die!” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold as he glared at the man in black robe, “If I am severely injured, don’t you think you’ll be okay.”

Jian Wushuang saw the Inextinguishable Light immersing in the man in the black robe’s body under the concealment of his sword light.

The man in black robe didn’t notice the Soul Attack previously. When the Inextinguishable Light entered his body, he finally reacted.

“This is…?” The man in black robe contracted his pupils.

After the light bunch entered his body, it suddenly formed a huge Soul thorn and attacked his consciousness.

Although he was a Peak Universe God in Third Heaven, the strength of consciousness was merely at the level of a Universe God in the Third Heaven. Plus, he wasn’t under any prevention, the Soul Attack with the secret skill of Stars and Tian Yuan that Jian Wushuang performed gave him a direct hit. Suddenly…

“Ah!”

The man in the black robe groaned in pain and he sounded hysterical. His eyes were bloodshot red as he hugged his head and shook insanely.

Looking at the sight, Jian Wushuang quickly shouted, “Duan Lingfeng, right now. Do it now!”

Behind the man in the black robe, Duan Lingfeng acted swiftly when he noticed the transformation. He seized the opportunity and took action.

“The tenth!”

Another crimson blade light descended.

In the dark universe, there was only the crimson blade light that lit up the world.

Everyone was uncontrollably attracted to the crimson blade light.

The tenth!

When Duan Lingfeng was fighting with the man in the black robe earlier, he had only played till the ninth. Then, the tenth was Duan Lingfeng’s real strongest stroke.

That stroke shocked Jian Wushuang entirely. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The blade light appeared behind the man in the black robe like lightning. The man in the black robe noticed the light and he forcefully resisted the pain his consciousness was feeling and wanted to block the attack.

However, under the sharp pain in his consciousness, it was extremely tough for him to manipulate his divine power. He could barely lift his head but in the end… The blade light swept past his palm brutally and over his neck. His head flew off just like that.
