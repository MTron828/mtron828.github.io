Chapter 3427 Forgiveness

“The sixth level of the Void!”

“It’s definitely the sixth level of the Void, a super expert comparable to the Sect Master!”

The snow-white long-haired woman and the three-meter-tall middle-aged man’s figures started to tremble slightly, the three-meter-tall middle-aged man directly shouted in a low voice, “Hei Yao, what that disciple of yours has done, he actually dared to provoke a super expert of the sixth level of the Void!”

“I, I don’t know either.” Master Hei Yao was also extremely shocked and furious at this moment. “Although I know that Qingyan is usually a little reckless, I still know his limits. Who knew that he actually provoked such an existence?”

Master Hei Yao also had some bitterness that he could not say at this moment.

When he learned that Saint Qingyan had been killed by Demon Master Chenhuo, he immediately invited these two fourth level of the Void to take revenge. Moreover, he was mentally prepared at the beginning because in his opinion, no matter what Saint Qingyan said…he was only a Saint. How strong could the experts he could provoke be? Therefore, the Blacklight Master’s previous guess was that the Demon Master Chenhuo was probably only at the void three realms, at most at the void four realms. If that was the case, with their lineup, it would be very difficult to kill the other party, however, they could teach the other party a lesson, which could be considered as giving him face back.

As for the void fifth level…the Blacklight Master had just thought about it.

He thought that if the Demon Master Chenhuo was an expert of the void fifth level, then the three of them might not be the other party’s match. However, the three of them were not too afraid when they joined forces. Moreover, the other party would more or less give some face to the Illusory Moon Sect, they would not continue fighting. In this way, they would only suffer a slight loss.

In short, regardless of whether it was experts at the third, fourth, or even the fifth level of the void, they were still within the scope of the three of them.

But now, the person in front of them had revealed his strength and actually reached the sixth level of the Void?

“Heavens, the sixth level of the void, how many are there in the entire Divine Beginning Realm? What ability does that disciple of mine have to actually provoke such a super expert?” The Blacklight Master roared in his heart.

“Even within my Illusory Moon Sect, there is only Sect Master alone among the six Void Realms’ super experts. Moreover, Sect Master has repeatedly warned us that we must not provoke experts at this level. This is because as long as we reach the six void realms, we will be able to do whatever we want within the Divine Beginning Realm. Even a Saint Realm Master might not be able to kill some of the slightly stronger six void realms!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“That’s why even the three great Saint Realms wouldn’t dare to provoke such an expert. But now, we’ve actually provoked one?” The snow-white long-haired beauty’s expression was extremely solemn.

“It’s too late to talk about this now. Let’s first think about how to reconcile with the other party. If we really provoke such a great enemy for the sect this time, then we’ll very likely become the sect’s sinners,” The three-meter-tall middle-aged man said solemnly.

Offending a void six realm expert for no reason was something that even the three great Saint Realms were unwilling to do, let alone the Illusory Moon Sect.

The three of them were also very clear that offending a mysterious void six realm expert would be a great disaster for the Illusory Moon Sect.

There was no need for the other party to come knocking on their door. The other party only needed to encounter experts from the Illusory Moon Sect in the Divine Beginning Realm in the future and kill every single one of them. That would be a disaster for the Illusory Moon Sect…because the experts of the six states of the void could easily kill the Principles Masters of the Illusory Moon Sect.

On the other hand, on the Illusory Moon Sect’s side, even if they used the entire sect’s strength, they would not be able to kill a person of the six states of the void.

“Hei Yao, this matter was caused by your precious disciple. You can speak of this matter yourself,” the snow-white long-haired beauty said.

Master Hei Yao’s expression sank. Although he was extremely unwilling, he still forcefully suppressed the fear in his heart and slowly walked to the front of Demon Master Chenhuo.

“This…this lord.” The Blacklight Master opened his mouth and his voice was clearly filled with respect.

Once these words were said, the countless cultivators in Wu Xin City immediately went into an uproar. However, they could understand. Clearly, the three Principles Masters of the Illusionary Moon Sect had kicked an iron plate this time.

The person in front of them was an existence that the three of them and even the entire Illusionary Moon Sect could not afford to offend.

“What do you want to say?” Demon Master Chenhuo’s expression was cold as he looked down at Blacklight Master.

“Sir, this matter is purely because that disciple of mine did not know the immensity of heaven and earth. He actually offended you. He deserved to be killed by you, sir. The three of us did not know your strength, so we offended you just now. We hope that you can forgive us, sir.” Blacklight Master’s attitude was extremely low, he no longer had the airs of a law master. He had even asked for mercy from Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Mercy?” Demon Master Chenhuo snickered, “You weren’t acting like this just now. Now that you see that I’m strong and you can’t afford to offend me, you’re asking for mercy? If I didn’t have the strength, wouldn’t I have already been killed by the three of you?”

“This…” Blacklight Master’s expression changed, but he did not know what to say. They were indeed in the wrong in this matter.

“Sir.” The beautiful woman with snow-white long hair walked up, she said respectfully, “This matter is indeed the fault of the three of us. We have offended you. Sir, no matter how you want to punish the three of us, the three of us will admit it. However, sir, please don’t blame our Illusionary Moon Sect. After all, this matter is purely a private matter of my dark light. It has nothing to do with the Illusionary Moon Sect. The three of us only acted on behalf of ourselves this time. We didn’t represent the Illusionary Moon Sect.”

“Oh?” The Demon Master Chenhuo raised his eyebrows and glanced at the snow-white long-haired woman before he immediately smiled, “You are quite clever. Although you say that it has nothing to do with the Illusory Moon Sect, you are actually using the Illusory Moon Sect to make this old man have some misgivings. Moreover, you even said that the three of you are willing to accept the punishment. This can be considered giving this old man a way out. Haha, you are really very clever.”

The snow-white long-haired woman’s expression changed slightly. That was indeed what she meant, but she was directly pointed out by the Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Girl, don’t think of using the Illusionary Moon Sect behind you to threaten this old man. To be honest, a mere Illusionary Moon Sect is really nothing to this old man,” said the Demon Master Chenhuo directly.

“That is only natural. Lord’s strength is monstrous. Even if Lord Sect Master were to come personally, my Illusionary Moon Sect might not be a match for you. How would I dare to use the sect to threaten you?” Said the snow-white long-haired woman.

“Hehe, your words are quite pleasant to hear. In that case, this old man can ignore this matter. However, this old man has one condition.”
