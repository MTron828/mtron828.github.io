4708 Heaven-Patterned Bone Armor

In addition to the flocks of cranes in the sky, there were also top cultivators flying over their heads from time to time.

After advancing to the Yan Immortal stage, other than using telepathy to travel, the simplest minor divine power like the Earth Shrinking Mountain River had a wide range of uses. It was mainly a movement technique, allowing one to travel immense distances.

Obviously, this Young Emperor was also a Yan Immortal.

The two of them used the minor divine power of Earth Shrinking Mountain River to travel around the continent.

However, it was difficult for Chun Qiu. He could only barely follow behind the two of them even though he was flying with all his might.

They travelled across the Jingchuan Heaven Domain, taking in the sights of the the mountains and rivers.

Among them, there were no less than a hundred bustling cities, and even Yan Immortals would exchange their insights and techniques here.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor strolled in the largest Tian City. It was bustling with thousands of top cultivators.

Countless rare and precious treasures were placed on the ground for trade and exchange.

“This thing is a hard currency. You can basically buy everything you need.” The Young Emperor caressed a thumb-sized black mountain crystal and threw a storage bag to Jian Wushuang. “There’s a whole ship’s worth of crystals inside. You can use them as you wish.”

“…”

Although there were many top cultivators in this bustling Tian City, none of them were noisy. Everyone seemed to have a goal in mind and would leave immediately after they completed it without saying a word.

Walking among them, even Jian Wushuang, who was used to seeing Supreme Treasures, began to be tempted.

There were all kinds of Supreme Treasures, and some of them were broken. Some of them even contained a tiny bit of Imperial Emperor’s fate.

Jian Wushuang also picked out some of the sword principle books that were still useful.

As the Young Emperor had said, the black mountain crystal was really hard currency. With only half a ship of crystals, he had bought four or five books about sword principles.

As for sword principle, Jian Wushuang hoped to gain some insight from each unknown sword principle so as to enrich his entire Sword Dao framework.

The Young Emperor beside him, on the other hand, liked to buy some little things that were not of much use but were extremely ingenious.

Along the way, he had stuffed no less than a hundred trinkets into his storage bag.

Jian Wushuang did not like crowded places. Just as he was about to explain the situation and leave, he had a strange feeling that made him subconsciously look at the inconspicuous stall beside him.

Among all kinds of broken treasures that seemed to have been abandoned for countless years, a palm-sized bone armor engraved with complicated and incomprehensible patterns came into his eyes.

Jian Wushuang stopped and walked to the front of the stall with his eyes wide open.

“Xuan…”

“Xuan Yi!”

Jian Wushuang’s body trembled and he subconsciously reached for the bone armor.

An extremely old palm suddenly grabbed his wrist like an eagle’s claw, making it impossible for him to move an inch further.

“I only trade and not sell anything in this stall.”

A hoarse and low voice came from under the tattered robe. Half of his face, which was only exposed from the hood, was full of black and white stubbles, looking extremely old.

Jian Wushuang, who had intended to throw the whole storage bag to him, was stunned and did not know how to answer.

Just as Jian Wushuang was in a daze, the claw-like palm cut open his palm and took out something.

Everything happened in an instant. It was so fast that Jian Wushuang could only react when everything was over.

He suddenly pulled back his palm, only to find that his palm was completely undamaged, without the slightest injury.

However, the slight pain still reminded Jian Wushuang that what had happened was real.

“What did you do to me just now?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was low and his cold eyes were filled with killing intent.

“It’s just a harmless and insignificant exchange condition. It’s yours now.” The stall keeper hidden in the black robe said in a low voice and put the bone armor in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

After realizing that there was nothing wrong with his divine body, Jian Wushuang did not bother to investigate. He looked at the bone armor in his hand with a frown.

The Young Emperor, who was standing to the side, was also interested when he saw him acting like this. He squatted down and looked at the bone armor as well. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The words that could be vaguely seen from a certain angle had disappeared when he looked at them carefully.

The ‘Xuan’ word and ‘Yi’ word that were getting clearer and clearer did not show their shape anymore.

However, Jian Wushuang had a feeling that the bone armor definitely recorded something that had broken the ancient times and was definitely related to that person!

“Where did you get this bone armor?” Jian Wushuang looked up at him and asked.

The stall keeper shook his head. “I don’t know either. No one knows where he came from. Perhaps everything will only be clear when he has no choice but to appear.”

The unorganized sentence was like a premonition or omen, obscure and difficult to understand.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to ask more, the stall-keeper spoke again, but this time it was about their safety.

“There’s someone watching you in the dark.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang thought of something and subconsciously looked into the distance.

The thousands of cultivators who had deliberately concealed their auras all looked over at this moment.

Swish!

Nearly a hundred arrows came from all directions, carrying mighty Yan power.

Jian Wushuang suddenly waved his arm and a pure barrier enveloped the three of them.

Clang, clang, clang!

Each of the arrows, as thick as an arm, pierced through the barrier, but could not move any further.

Looking at the sharp arrow less than a finger away from his eyes, the Young Emperor’s face darkened.

Jian Wushuang remained silent. He raised a palm and waved it in the air. Suddenly, the void collapsed and a black-robed man was directly brought over.

However, before anyone could say anything, the black-robed man who had been captured directly shattered his own life source and turned into dust on the spot.

The next moment, the sky above the entire Tian City cracked. Hundreds and thousands of black-robed men swept over like an endless sea.

Even Jian Wushuang’s expression turned ugly.

From these figures that were coming from all directions, he could sense the aura of at least 15 Yan Immortals and an uncountable number of Ancestor-level Entry Yans.

“Are these people here to seek revenge?” Jian Wushuang frowned and looked at the Young Emperor.

The Young Emperor’s eyes sank. “How did these scumbags know I was here?”

Chun Qiu nudged Jian Wushuang and signaled him to leave.

Jian Wushuang did not make a decision. He did not have a good impression of the Young Emperor, but he did not hate him either.

He had stayed in the Six Heavens Realms because he had been threatened, but now the situation seemed to have changed.
