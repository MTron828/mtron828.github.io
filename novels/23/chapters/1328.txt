Chapter 1329: Master of Silence Gloriette in the Snow Dojo!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On the way to the Snow Dojo, Jian Wushuang tried to understand more about the essence of swordsmanship in order to develop more powerful unique skills.

When he occasionally met some bandits, he would fight with them to practice his swordsmanship.

Jian Wushuang never missed any opportunity for him to cultivate.

And ten years passed quickly.

“In front of us is the Snow Sacred Land, let’s go there.” Lord Wu Cang pointed to a vast floating land.

The Snow Sacred Land was the capital of the Snow Kingdom, in which the royal family of the Snow Kingdom, powerful groups and several large military forces gathered.

Jian Wushuang followed Lord Wu Cang to the Snow Sacred Land and took a wormhole to the Snow Dojo.

The headquarter of the Snow Dojo was a vast, floating building complex, with numerous palaces and attics.

Thanks to Lord Wu Cang, Jian Wushuang entered into the headquarters of the Snow Dojo.

They went into a gorgeous palace.

“Since you aren’t a member of the Snow Dojo, it is better for you to stay here and I will take a chance to ask the route of the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries for you.” Lord Wu Cang said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Opportunities?”

Was it so difficult to ask for a route? Maybe, Lord Wu Cang was going to ask for someone with a higher status.

Lord Wu Cang explained, “Yes, the person was Master of Silence Gloriette, one of the three masters in the Snow Dojo.”

“Master of Silence Gloriette?”

“He has supreme power and unimaginable talents in the Snow Dojo. He can determine my life and death. Although I am a Golden Deacon in the Snow Dojo, I don’t have many opportunities to see him.” Lord Wu Cang appeared a little bit embarrassed.

Jian Wushuang knew why Lord Wu Cang was behaving so cautiously.

After all, Master of Silence Gloriette was so powerful that he could determine the life and death of Lord Wu Cang.

“Wait here for around half a month until the Master of Silence Gloriette holds a meeting with the Golden Deacons. I will ask him at that time.”

Jian Wushuang expressed his appreciation.

He knew how difficult it was to ask the Master of Silence Gloriette for something.

So Lord Wu Cang wouldn’t help him if he didn’t think highly of Jian Wushuang’s potential or hope that Jian Wushuang could join the Snow Dojo.

The half a month passed quickly.

Jian Wushuang stayed at the palace according to Lord Wu Cang’s word.

“Lord Wu Cang must have met Master of Silence Gloriette since many Golden Deacons attended the meeting.” Jian Wushuang was curious about how things were going.

And Lord Wu Cang didn’t come back until the night.

But he looked worried when coming back.

“How is it going?” Jian Wushuang asked Lord Wu Cang.

Lord Wu Cang sighed without answering him immediately.

“Is Master of Silence Gloriette annoyed by my request?”

“No. I didn’t even ask.” Lord Wu Cang felt sorry.

“Why?”

“Actually I planned to ask him today in the meeting. But he was angry today in the meeting and he scolded us, even beating two Golden Deacons. How did I dare to ask him right then?” Lord Wu Cang explained.

Jian Wushuang understood now.

No one dared to ask anything when Master of Silence Gloriette was angry.

“But why was he so angry?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s all about the ranked battle.” Lord Wu Cang signed.

“The ranked battle?” Jian Wushuang had never heard about that.

Lord Wu Cang started to explain, “It’s the ranked battle with Universe God Palace. You may have only heard about the Snow Dojo when you were in the Dayu Universe. But the Snow Dojo is one of the two genius concentration camps in the Snow Kingdom. And the other one is the Universe God Palace.”

“The Snow Dojo and the Universe God Palace were both founded by the royal family of the Snow Kingdom, they were divided and always competing with each other. Every ranked battle is held between the Snow Dojo and the Universe God Palace.”

“The ranked battle is seemingly aimed to facilitate communication among all the talents, but it is in fact a battle to determine the winner.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

It’s understandable that fierce competition rose between two genius concentration camps.

“So Master of Silence Gloriette got angry for losing the battle?” Jian Wushuang asked.

No. The battle will be held in three months but we know the possibility to win is low when comparing their strengths.

“What is the probability of victory?”

“Less than three tenths.” Lord Wu Cang answered, “The fact is that the Snow Dojo has been defeated five times consecutively. Another defeat will be a stigma for us.”

“No wonder Master of Silence Gloriette is so angry.”

Every leader would get anxious when his team could barely win after failing in the battle for five times!

At that moment, the worried Lord Wu Cang came up with an idea and he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I know how to ask him.”
