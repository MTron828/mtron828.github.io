Chapter 2112 Returning the Favour

“Emperor God Liu Guang?” Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were raised. “He’s on the list as well?”“Yes,” Ancestor Tian Chen replied. “She may not be the best amongst pinnacle Emperor Gods, but she has shown great improvement in power over the years. She has potential. Offering her a seat would give her a minimum twenty-percent chance of becoming a Great Emperor.”

“What’s your relationship with her, Wushuang?” Emperor Bai asked.

“It began like this,” Jian Wushuang said, “the Lineage of Stars encountered a crisis back then, extreme methods were used. For this I invited Emperor God Liu Guang to take down Deluge Fortress together, along with the fort lord. It was a personal favour I asked Liu Guang for. My powers have improved over the years, but not once has she asked me to return the favour.”

“Oh?” Empero Bai nodded. With a wave of his hand, Emperor God Liu Guang’s name was removed from the list.

“Emperor Bai, what is the meaning of this?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Emperor God Liu Guang was already on the list, her ability levels roughly the same as the others, I just didn’t know who to pick. Since she has relations with you, you can use this to return the favour,” Emperor Bai smiled. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Thank you, Emperor Bai,” Jian Wushuang was grateful.

He did not like to owe others favours, it was circumstance that forced him to. Now he could finally return it.

“No problem, you are also amongst the top ranks of our Sanctuary Alliance. A word from you is enough to assign one or two seats on your own. Her name was on the list anyway,” Emperor Bai waved his hand.

“For the other seats, we were not able to reach a consensus despite many meetings. From the looks of it, we need to let them compete for it.”

“A fair fight, not a bad idea,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Oh yes, Wushuang, you’ll have a seat amongst the dozen entering the Heaven Repairing Palace as well, make your preparations.” This came as a revelation to Jian Wushuang.

“Me?”

Was the purpose of opening the Palace not to allow Emperor Gods become Great Emperors?

He was already at Great Emperor level, and had been for a long period of time.

As if he had read his mind, Emperor Bai could not help but smile. “A Great Emperor would help the Sanctuary Alliance and Eternal Chaotic World tremendously in the upcoming battle, right? What more of a strong Great Emperor? According to what I have heard, you were to defeat Sky Swallowing Clan leader Ba Su face-to-face. I assume your abilities are already at the pinnacle of the Second Stage level.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang did not deny it.

“That’s it,” Emperor Bai continued. “The Palace is not as simple as helping Emperor Gods become Great Emperors. It also helps Great Emperors like yourself to feel what the Rules of Order are like!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

The Heaven Repairing Palace could help him experience Rules of Order?

“Don’t be shocked, of course the Palace has greater utilities. If not, the Alliance would not have used sixty percent of our hard-earned resources on its activation,” Emperor Bai said. “However, it only barely lets you experience Rules of Order. Barely. To realise and master the Rules of Order from the interaction alone would be impossible, no matter how powerful your realisation abilities were.”

Jian Wushuang understood, but could not hide his disappointment.

He thought from the interaction with Rules of Order, perhaps he could try to learn it.

From the looks of it, there was no way.

“Of course, even if you do not manage to learn it, experiencing it alone will do you wonders in the future. The Palace will also improve your abilities in all ways. It won’t help your Inverse Cultivation with the third stage, but it’ll still improve it nonetheless!”

“With your abilities,even without Rules of Order or the third stage Inverse Cultivation, you still have a chance with Third Stage Great Emperor abilities! Having a Third Stage Great Emperor would be fantastic for our battle efforts!”

Jian Wushuang understood.

The Eternal Chaotic World currently only had one true Third Stage Great Emperor, Emperor Bai. That included both the Sanctuary Alliance and Special Tribes Alliance.

The rest were at most Second Stage Great Emperors.

The known Third Stage Great Emperors of the Three Emperors World were Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, and Demon King Chen Yu – that made three of them. Kaiser Blood even had the potential to battle Emperor Bai face-to-face. Under these circumstances, the Eternal Chaotic World needed a new Third Stage Great Emperor.

And Jian Wushuang was the closest amongst them to reaching that stage.

“Understood, rest assured that I will do my best to reach Third Stage as soon as possible,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“No rush, don’t stress yourself out. That won’t do any good,” Emperor Bai smiled. “Here are three letters, one for each seat in the Palace. One is for you. Please pass the other two to Emperor God Liu Guang and Jue Xian.”

Jian Wushuang received the letters before going on his way.

“No rush back to the Red Dragon Sanctuary, let Jue Xian wait there a bit longer. I should return the favour first,” Jian Wushuang smiled, and made his way to Emperor God Liu Guang’s residence.

Outside the ten Top Sanctuaries, in the dark Void, lay a floating plateau.

It may not have been big, but it was extremely idyllic, with its fair share of mountains and streams.

At its centre was an ancient palace. Emperor God Liu Guang was amongst two purple-haired lasses.

“Qing Xuan, we are about to enter battle with the Three Emperors World, are you ready for it?” Emperor God Liu Guang asked.

“Relax sister, this battle concerns the life and death of the Eternal Chaotic World. As an Almighty, I am already mentally prepared. Unfortunately, I am only an ordinary Sir God, I cannot influence much. But you sister, a pinnacle Emperor God, has a greater responsibility,” the purple-haired lass replied.

“Oh yes, I have heard rumours from the Sanctuary Alliance saying that they would open the Heaven Repairing Palace again. You have a shot at those seats.”

“Heaven Repairing Palace?” Emperor God Liu Guang shook her head and laughed. “Too many people fighting for those seats. Is not as easy as you think it will be.”

Just when Emperor God Liu Guang finished her sentence:

Wong!

A figure directly appeared within the palace without warning.

Emperor God Liu Guang and her purple-haired lasses sensed it, and immediately sent people to check it out.
