Moreover, Jian Wushuang realized that the Spiritual Power and Origin Energy in the Eternal World were much richer.

The Origin Energy was at least 100 times richer than that of the Ancient World.

Jian Wushuang had cultivated the Fourth Level of the Earth Core Palace in the Monster Continent. Compared with the Eternal World, the Origin Energy there was also much weaker. However, this was just an ordinary place in the Eternal World.

“The Ancient World is incomparable to the Eternal World.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Just like the disparity between Nanyang Continent and the Divine Land, the difference between the Ancient World and the Eternal World was beyond words.

The Skyscraping Realm experts from Ancient Worlds around Jian Wushuang looked around and gasped in admiration.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang saw a man he knew, “Dark Emperor?”

“Jian Wushuang?”

Jian Wushuang had spotted Dark Emperor, a black-robed man with a cold face. Jian Wushuang had met him before. Dark Emperor noticed Jian Wushuang too.

He walked towards Jian Wushuang, accompanied by a black-skinned elder with a frail and thin frame. Jian Wushuang recognized the elder.

“Dark Emperor, Sir Ming.” As Jian Wushuang looked at them, a smile spread on his face.

Dark Emperor had done him a favor when Jian Wushuang was dealing with Su Ming. There were no grudges between the two of them. Although Jian Wushuang disliked Dark Emperor’s selfishness, he was happy to meet an expert who came from the same Ancient World.

Sir Ming was a top expert as famous as Dark Emperor.

As they came from the same Ancient World, the trio naturally stuck together.

“Are you Jian Wushuang? I’ve heard of you.” Sir Ming looked Jian Wushuang.

“It’s my honor to be known by you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“We are in the Eternal World, just call us by our names. My name is Ming Liu.” Sir Ming said.

“Call me Wu Xin. I will be in trouble if anyone here wants to kill me just because he dislikes the name of Dark Emperor.” Dark Emperor said.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Dark Emperor and Sir Ming were the unbridled top two experts in their Ancient World,

However, they seemed cautious and did not dare to use their titles in the Eternal World.

“It seems that only the three of us from our Ancient World made it here to the Firmament Territory Feast.” Dark Emperor commented as he looked around and realized that he didn’t know anyone else.

There was another Drill Ground, but fewer people were gathered there.

“Is that another Drill Ground over there?”

“I guess people there are geniuses of the Eternal World!”

“Geniuses of the Eternal World?”

Unlike them, people on the other Drill Ground were familiar with the Eternal World. They cast occasional glances at the Ancient World visitors.

Those glances were full of disdain!

It was clear that the geniuses of the Eternal World looked down on them.

The Eternal World geniuses had an innate sense of superiority, because the Ancient Worlds were plane worlds at a lower level, while the Eternal World had the dominant position of Heavenly Laws.

“A super expert in our Ancient World once reached Eternal Realm in the Eternal World. When he returned, he said that the gap between the Eternal World and the Ancient World was huge. ”

A purple-clothed elder in the crowd spoke aloud.

“People in the Eternal World are born in particularly favorable natural conditions. Regardless of their talent, warriors will reach Skyscraping Realm and comprehend Dao within 100 years. Those who are talented can make it in decades! That’s a built-in advantage we don’t have.”

His words caused a great stir in the crowd.

In the Eternal World, no matter how little talent warriors had, they could easily reach Skyscraping Realm within 100 years.

But in the Ancient World, only a few could reach Skyscraping Realm.

In the Divine Land where Jian Wushuang came from, only three had reached Skyscraping Realm. They were the Three Ancestors.

Warriors in Ancient Worlds had to accumulate plenty of experience before they could even hope for an opportunity to reach Skyscraping Realm.

However, Skyscraping Realm experts in the Eternal World were common.

“Comparisons are odious.” Many were complaining.

“Even the most ordinary places in the Eternal World possess Spiritual Power and Origin Energy at levels 100 times?that of the Ancient World. With such an environment for cultivation, of course they’re stronger than us.” Dark Emperor muttered with dissatisfaction.

“They should look down on us. We are much weaker.” Jian Wushuang thought.

“It is only because they have a better cultivating environment. We will be no weaker than them in future.” Ming Liu was unwilling to concede.

The Skyscraping Realm experts of the Ancient Worlds continued to discuss. They felt uncomfortable under the watch of those disdainful eyes.

Right then...

“Boom!”

A powerful force suddenly arose from the Drill Ground where the geniuses of the Eternal World had gathered.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
