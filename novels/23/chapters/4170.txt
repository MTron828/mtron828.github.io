4171 The Eternal Night

“You’re looking for death!”

A cold light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. His two fingers were like swords as he ruthlessly hacked at Heavenly Ruler’s head!

Buzzzzzz!

There was no resistance at all. A blood line appeared between the eyebrows of Heavenly Ruler. Then, Heavenly Ruler’s divine body broke from the middle and was directly split into two by Jian Wushuang’s finger!

!!

This was not the end. Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and an extremely sharp and overbearing sword essence burst out from his hand. Once again, it crushed every part of Heavenly Ruler’s divine power into ashes!

The Heavenly Ruler had been completely annihilated!

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang stood with his hands behind his back and his expression was uncertain. He did not expect that in the end, this person would still leak the news.

“Forget it. I don’t think the Lord Zhennan would be able to guess anything based on what he said. Even if he did notice something, it doesn’t matter. At most, we’ll just fight.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head and stopped thinking about it. Anyway, with his current strength, even if he were to face the Lord Zhennan, he might not be able to defeat him, but he was sure that he was definitely not weaker than the Lord Zhennan.

“The most important thing right now is to improve my strength. As long as I’m strong enough, so what if everyone knows that I have a big secret?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered. Then, he took a step forward and went far away.

…

At the same time, in a Palace not far away.

Lord Zhennan was dressed in a blood-red robe, his hair tied into a small braid hanging loosely on his back. His eyes were slightly closed, and he was sitting on the main seat with his bare feet.

A spear-wielding guard in heavy armor stood respectfully below him.

This divine armor guard was the last remaining divine armor guard who had besieged the nine-tribulation King a thousand years ago.

“Your Highness, I just heard the voice of the Heavenly Ruler saying that he has a great secret to tell you.” The guard said.

Lord Zhennan slowly opened his eyes and said, “This king heard it as well, and this king can also sense that Heavenly Ruler and Star Ruler’s auras have already disappeared. They must have been killed to silence them.”

The divine armor guard raised his head in confusion, “Your Highness, could it be that Heavenly Ruler’s message about the secret he wanted to tell us was true? But with his strength, what big secret could he possibly know?”

“Ah, don’t underestimate anyone. There are many opportunities in the Tarot Ruins. Who knows what Heavenly Ruler and Star Ruler have found?” Lord Zhennan smiled and shook his head. He then stood up and said, “Let’s go and see Heavenly Ruler.”

“Yes!”

The godly armor guard respectfully acknowledged.

A moment later, the two of them arrived at the void where the Heavenly Ruler had fallen.

“Your Highness, the Heavenly Ruler has indeed fallen here!” The divine armor guard could not help but tremble as he sensed the remnant energy of the Heavenly Ruler.

The Lord Zhennan did not reply. He squinted his eyes and muttered to himself in surprise, “What a powerful aura of the Dao of the sword. I don’t think there’s a Ruler of the Dao of the sword who is as powerful as this in these ruins.”

Lord Zhennan’s eyes flashed with a hint of thought. He could not help but think, ‘Could it be that Qing Xuzi has returned?’

As soon as this idea came out, he shook his head and denied it.

Qing Xuzi’s reputation was no less than his. Even though he had disappeared for more than a thousand years, it was not to the extent that the two of them did not know him.

If it was Qing Xuzi who was after them, they would have told him their names.

Presumably, the person who had killed the Star Ruler and Heavenly Rulers was not famous.

“Your Highness, what should we do now?” The guard asked.

Lord Zhennan muttered to himself, “Let’s go back first. With such a powerful sword aura and the fact that he could easily kill Star Ruler and Heavenly Ruler, this person can’t be weak. The fight for the opportunities in the Tarot Ruins has just begun. I will have to deal with this kind of person sooner or later.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Yes!”

The two of them gradually left.

…

At the same time, in a remote corner far away from the central area of the Tarot Ruins.

Jian Wushuang was sitting cross-legged, and in front of his knees was the ‘Tarot sword manual’!

This Tarot sword manual had a faint divine power fluctuation. Like a halo, it wrapped around the Tarot sword manual.

These ripples of divine power had been left behind by Ruler Tarot all those years ago, and it was precisely because of these ripples of divine power that the Tarot sword manual had been able to remain undamaged even after hundreds of chaos cycles had passed.

“There are only five pages in total?”

Jian Wushuang frowned. The Tarot sword manual was not as thick and complicated as he had thought. There were only five pages in total, and each of the five pages corresponded to a sword principle super power!

In other words, this Tarot sword manual recorded a total of five sword Dao divine abilities!

Jian Wushuang used his divine power, stretched out his right hand, and flipped to the first page.

An extremely strong resistance came from the sword code. Although this resistance was strong, it was not harmful. It was like a test to see if the reader had the strength to inherit his sword code.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang snorted coldly. Divine power surged from his hand and he immediately suppressed the resistance. He then turned to the first page.

On the first page of the gold-stamped paper, there was a passage written with a sharp pen. It introduced the first divine ability of the Tarot sword manual.

Light will be devoured by darkness, living beings will walk towards the cold of Midwinter, and the sun will eventually fall into the arms of the dark night. The world will then fall into the deepest darkness.

“This darkness…”

“Its name is…”

“Eternal night!”

In an instant, the world in front of Jian Wushuang changed.

Time seemed to accelerate, and everything around them was fading. Flowers and trees began to wither, and the vitality of all living creatures in the world was slowly fading away.

The stars dimmed, and the world seemed to have become a thick gray.

A moment later, the entire universe fell into an eternal night. A deathly, cold, lonely, and rigid aura filled the air.

There was no longer any light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The root of all this was because a figure with an unclear face and figure suddenly appeared in Jian Wushuang’s mind and wielded a sword.

All the darkness was the power of this sword!

This strike could strip all life and bring eternal darkness to the world!

The name of this sword was eternal night!

…

In the blink of an eye, a year had passed.

Jian Wushuang just looked at the Tarot sword manual and did not move at all, as if he had fallen into the deepest level of comprehension.

In a 100-foot radius around him, streaks of pitch-black sword light rose up. Then, like a huge net, they intertwined together and formed a huge black ball that wrapped around Jian Wushuang, who sat cross-legged.

Spring went and autumn came. The second year had passed.

The black ball’s color became darker and darker. Darkness even began to spread out, robbing everything around it of its vitality.

Then, it was the third year.

Jian Wushuang had closed his eyes and the area within a hundred miles of him had turned into a cold dead land covered in darkness!

He was completely immersed in the deepest level of comprehension. In the center of his divine body, the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass with seven leaves was melting and consuming at an extremely fast speed. Then, it turned into comprehension of sword principle and was completely absorbed by Jian Wushuang.

The fourth year…the fifth year…the sixth year…

At the end of the seventh year, Jian Wushuang finally opened his eyes!
