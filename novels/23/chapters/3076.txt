Chapter 3077: Ten-Star Pagoda

——

“The genius feast is a gathering of many top geniuses in the First heaven, but not all first-level True Saints can participate in it. Before participating in the genius feast, you have to go through a round of assessment, which is the Ten-Star Pagoda behind me!”

“There are ten levels in the Ten-Star Pagoda, and each level is more difficult than the last. To participate in the genius feast, you have to pass the fifth level at the very least,” a person in charge of the registration office said.

“Jiu Luo, you go ahead first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.” Jiu Luo nodded and went straight into the pitch-black tower.

Jiu Luo did not stay in the Ten-Star Pagoda for long. During this time, the first to the fifth level of the tower soon emitted a burst of dazzling light. It meant that Jiu Luo had passed the fifth level, and soon…the sixth floor also burst out with a bright light.

“The sixth floor?”

Countless first rank True Saints raised their heads to look at the pitch-black pagoda.

The Ten-Star Pagoda was extremely difficult.

Ordinary first rank True Saints would find it extremely difficult to pass the fifth floor.

As for passing the sixth floor, one had to be an extremely powerful first rank True Saint. There were not many experts who had signed up to participate in this genius banquet.

At this moment…the seventh level of the black tower suddenly emitted a dazzling light.

In an instant, the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm burst into an uproar.

“The seventh level, that person just now actually passed the seventh level!”

“So powerful!”

“It has been two months since the start of this genius banquet. Although many people have passed the fifth or sixth level of the Ten-Star Pagoda, there are still pitifully few people who have passed the seventh level. In total, there are probably only a few dozen people!”

“If he can pass the seventh level of the Ten-Star Pagoda, he will definitely make it to the end of the genius feast.”

A lot of whispers sounded.

When Jiu Luo walked out of the Ten-Star Pagoda, a lot of people looked at him with respect and envy.

To be able to pass the seventh level of the Ten-Star Pagoda, he was undoubtedly at the top of this genius feast.

“Jiu Luo, how do you feel?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Jiu Luo.

“I’m fine. The first six levels are easy for me, but the seventh level gives me a certain amount of pressure. As for the eighth level, the opponents I met there are much stronger than me. I can’t pass it at all,” Jiu Luo said directly.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Jiu Luo was a rank one True Saint, but his battle strength was comparable to a rank two True Saint. In terms of talent, he was extremely high. It was normal for him to be able to pass the seventh level of the Ten-Star Pagoda.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, it’s your turn. I can pass the seventh level. With your strength, it’s easy for you to pass the eighth level. It shouldn’t be a problem for you to pass the ninth or even the tenth level,” Jiu Luo said.

“Ninth level? Tenth level?” Jian Wushuang smiled. After a while, he entered the Ten-Star Pagoda.

Once he entered the Ten-Star Pagoda, Jian Wushuang came to an independent space.

A towering figure stood in front of him. This was the opponent he was going to face on the first level of the Ten-Star Pagoda.

“Challenger, defeat me and you can go to the next level,” the towering figure said coldly.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and soon made his move.

In the Ten-Star Pagoda, Jiu Luo and many other geniuses were waiting quietly.

Many people’s eyes were fixed on the Ten-Star Pagoda.

A moment after Jian Wushuang entered the Ten-Star Pagoda, the first floor burst out with a dazzling light. Then the second floor, the third floor, the fourth floor… All the way to the sixth floor, all of them took only a short time to pass through.

Then it was the seventh floor. Jian Wushuang seemed to have stopped for a while at the seventh floor. The light on the seventh floor only lit up after a long time.

After passing the seventh floor, Jian Wushuang walked out of the Ten-Star Pagoda.

“The seventh floor again!”

“These two people have passed the seventh floor, and it’s obvious that they know each other.”

“Where did these two geniuses come from? Are they from the same sect?”

The surrounding people were full of curiosity.

Jian Wushuang returned to Jiu Luo.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, you didn’t try hard, right? Otherwise, with your strength, how could you only pass the seventh level?” Jiu Luo looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange look.

“It’s just a test at the registration office. It’s enough to pass. There’s no need to show off too much,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jiu Luo shrugged and said nothing more.

In the void not far away, Bai Xiao and the three disciples from the Dao Palace saw everything.

“The Heavenly Sword Marquis didn’t use his full strength at all,” the red-haired man said.

“Yes.” Bai Xiao nodded. “If the four of us were to challenge the Ten-Star Pagoda, any one of us would be able to pass the eighth level at the very least. If we’re lucky, we might even be able to make it to the ninth level. The Heavenly Sword Marquis’ sword techniques are clearly above mine. Furthermore, according to what master said, he has always been concealing his skills and strength. Therefore, if he were to really use his full strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to make it to the ninth level.”

“But he only passed the seventh level,” said the beautiful woman in golden armor.

“There’s no rush. Now that he has participated in the genius feast, he will definitely make a move. We’ll watch carefully,” Bai Xiao said.

After passing the registration, Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo waited in the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm for the start of the genius feast.

They waited for another month.

It took them three months to register. During these three months, many rank one True Saints passed the test of the Ten-Star Pagoda and participated in the genius feast, there were more than 20,000 people. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Among these 20,000 rank one True Saints, there were many talented geniuses.

Soon, the genius feast officially began.

The first round, the free-for-all!

Every 100 people were grouped together to fight in the free-for-all. In the free-for-all, these True Saints could use any method to fight. and during the fighting process, once their divine bodies collapsed, they would be considered eliminated, until there were only 10 people left in this 100 people.

In other words, this free-for-all did not require one’s strength to be very strong. One only needed to be able to survive in this free-for-all.

In addition, there were rules in the genius feast. No one was allowed to use poison, which could restrain the immortal body.

After all, this was just a genius feast. It was a contest between geniuses, but it was not a real battlefield. It was not a real life-and-death battle.

The chaotic battle began one after another.

Although Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo signed up at the same time, they were not assigned to the same chaotic battle.
