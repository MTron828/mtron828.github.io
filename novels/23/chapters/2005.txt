Chapter 2006: Jian Wushuang’s Value

Just as everyone was confused, Emperor Bai spoke again, “No one knows what is in the dark millstone. Under such circumstances, the four members of the expert troop from Sanctuary Alliance have to be extremely careful. Jian Wushuang, you are an inverse cultivator and you have a unique ability that could be put to use. Besides, unlike the other three, you are still in Sir God realm. There are many things that would be too obvious if the three Great Emperors were to do them in the dark millstone. So, you will have to do on their behalf.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The other Great Emperors understood then too.

It was true that Jian Wushuang was just a Sir God and he wouldn’t catch so much attention as compared to the other three Great Emperors. Hence, it would be much more convenient for him to carry out some task.

“This crisis concerns the life and death of Eternal Chaotic World. Before such a crisis, everyone should prioritize the situation. Everyone here, including the experts under your control, have to put down all resentment. Do you understand?” Emperor Bai looked around and intentionally lingered his gaze on Abysmal Saint Master for a while.

Everyone knew that Abysmal Saint Master and Jian Wushuang were unhappy with one another and they had been in a fight before.

Now, both of them were in the expert troop. If they were to have conflict, they would be in big trouble.

Abysmal Saint Master noticed Emperor Bai’s gaze and nodded heavily. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Colored Glaze,” Emperor Bai spoke again.

“Mister Emperor Bai,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze stood up.

“The unique concealment skill that you obtained from the ancient battlefield is useful for the expert troop. Share it with the four of them,” Emperor Bai commanded.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze had a unique concealment skill.

The concealment skill could rein in one’s aura entirely without leaking any bit. If they were to perform this skill when they hid, even when a Great Emperor spread his soul power, he wouldn’t be able to find them. It was absolutely the strongest concealment skill in Sanctuary Alliance.

Such a skill was really useful for the expert troop.

For instance, if the experts from Acheron Palace and Holocaust Sect were to be hunting for them in the dark millstone, as long as they leave their sights and hide, the enemy could only dream of finding them.

“Sure,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze didn’t hesitate and agreed.

Although she was the only one with the concealment skill, she knew her limits as the existence of Eternal Chaotic World was at stake.

“Jian Wushuang,” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang again, “Lineage of Star’s Secret Skill of Star Palace is powerful. Anyone who can cultivate it will have an extra trump card. The four of you should form expert troops to barge into the dark millstone. It is very dangerous. The four of you having an extra trump card will mean having another layer of defense. So… I hope you will share the Secret Skill of Star Palace as well.

“The Secret Skill of Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang thought but instantly decided, “Sure!”

Although the Secret Skill of Star Palace was precious and it could even be described as the biggest trump card that Lineage of Star had.

Eternal Chaotic World was at the brink of extermination. If Eternal Chaotic World were to disappear, Lineage of Star naturally would go down altogether.

Under such a situation, Jian Wushuang, of course, wouldn’t be loath to share it.

Forget about the fact that it was only for Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao to inherit the Secret Skill of Star Palace, even if Sanctuary Alliance wanted all experts in Eternal Chaotic World to inherit the secret skill in the end, he wouldn’t hesitate.

“That’s great. The four of you shall head back and get ready. Leave within ten years’ time,” Emperor Bai said.

“Yes!”

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao took the order.

“Jian Wushuang, stay back. The others can be dismissed too,” Emperor Bai waved.

Very soon, the Great Emperors left.

Eternal Chaotic World was facing such great danger. The Great Emperors who were the higher-ups in Eternal Chaotic World naturally came to the forefront and they had to be prepared at their fastest speed. They would collaborate with the four-members expert troop who would barge into the dark millstone from within with force so they could destroy the dark millstone.

…

In the spacious Presbytery Pavilion, there was only Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

“Actually, in the beginning, Red Dragon and Tian Chen recommended that Zi Xu should go. After all, not only is Zi Xu powerful, he has many skills. He would be helpful to the four-members’ expert troop. In the end, I chose you. Jian Wushuang, you should know the reason behind this,” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, it’s because of the defensive power of an inverse cultivator,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Yes,” Emperor Bai smiled faintly, “An inverse cultivator is ridiculously amazing. The unique capability of one on the seventh step of inverse cultivation, the others might not know it but you and I are both inverse cultivators and we know clearly that it means that the perfect Chaotic divine body is almost immortal. With such power, you will be even more useful than Zi Xu in the four-members expert troop.”

Jian Wushuang looked cold.

Perfect Chaotic divine body, even when his divine body collapsed entirely, it could be reorganized as long as his divine power was sufficient.

Although Jian Wushuang had only reached the first stage and the divine power that he possessed was only enough to reorganize his divine body four times, he couldn’t be truly defined as unrivaled. However, in terms of defensive power or his ability to suffer a beating, only Emperor Bai from Sanctuary Alliance was stronger than him.

“Mister Emperor Bai, don’t worry. I will give my all in the trip into the dark millstone, but as for Abysmal Saint Master…” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Don’t worry too much about Abysmal Saint Master. I know him well enough. He is arrogant and easily jealous. In simpler terms, he is narrow-minded and he couldn’t take anyone stronger than him. However, he knows what’s right and what’s wrong. In the trip into the dark millstone, he wouldn’t cause you any trouble, nor will he scheme against you because he himself knows that it’s extremely dangerous for the four of you to barge in. If you die in there, there will be no benefit to him at all,” Emperor Bai reassured him.

“Mm, alright then,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

With his current power and skills, he wasn’t afraid of Abysmal Saint Master, nor was he worried that he was being schemed against. However, the mission was no trivial matter. Jian Wushuang didn’t wish for unnecessary trouble that would affect the success or failure of the mission.

“Oh yeah, I have an elixir here. I prepared it for you. This is also the reason I made you stay back,” Emperor said and he flipped his wrist. He took out a white elixir that was the size of a pigeon egg.

There was only one elixir but it gave out a tempting fragrance. It instantly filled the entire Presbytery Pavilion.

If there were other experts in Presbytery Pavilion, it absolutely would stir their greed.
