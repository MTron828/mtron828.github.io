Chapter 298: Fight to the Death!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Mr. Huangfu Ming, I wonder why you have come to our Heartless Sect.” Master of Heartless Sect spoke in a low voice.

“Master of Heartless Sect?” Huangfu Ming cast a glance at the Master of Heartless Sect, then coldly said, “None of your business. Just stand aside. If you dare to step in, there is no need for your Heartless Sect to exist.”

“Huangfu Ming.” The expression of the Master of Heartless Sect changed.

Huangfu Ming, who was unwilling to talk with the Master of Heartless Sect, looked downward with his cold eyes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In a courtyard, Jian Wushuang, who had just returned, squinted and looked up at the sky. The moment he moved his body and appeared in the air, he saw Huangfu Ming and the black-clothed elder.

“Just as I expect, they are from Skywave Prefecture.”

Jian Wushuang did not feel surprised and knew why they came.

“They don’t dare to make trouble for Leng Rushuang, so they came to piss me off. Hum, the Lord of Skywave Prefecture is quite narrow-minded.”?Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Are you Swordsman?” Huangfu Ming looked towards Jian Wushuang.

“Huangfu Ming.” Jian Wushuang also recognized the challenger.

Huangfu Ming was the Half-saint expert that ranked 41st on the Bloodmoon List.

All the experts within the top 27 had reached the Saint Realm, except the Lord of Skywave Prefecture. As the only Half-saint expert, he also had battle strength in the Saint Realm.

Huangfu Ming could rank 44th, indicating that he was one of the strongest among the Half-saint experts.

“Huangfu Ming is much stronger than Xue Ying and Liu Ye.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Swordsman, you must know why I’m here. You offended our Mansion Master. I’ve been ordered to take your head,” Huangfu Ming said coldly.

“There’re many people who want my head. Who is he?” Jian Wushuang gave a contemptuous smile.

He was not afraid of Holy Emperor Palace. How was it possible to put a Lord of Skywave Prefecture in his eyes?

“You are courting death!” Huangfu Ming shouted.

He moved his wrist and a double-edged giant axe appeared in his hand. He took a sudden step in the air, causing invisible waves to spread out.

He immediately lifted up his giant axe and hacked at Jian Wushuang.

The slash was extremely powerful, seemingly strong enough to cut through a mountain.

Jian Wushuang stared at it coldly, with a cyan Long Sword in his hand. The ordinary sword only looked sharp. However, a roaring power erupted as Jian Wushuang’s spiritual power surged.

“Selfless Sword Technique, fifth move!

“Blood Rupturing Movement.”

His World Origin suddenly erupted, shaking the surroundings, as if the whole world in front of him was being suppressed.

They launched frontal attacks, without any tricks.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang halted and was instantly repulsed. After retreating back almost 100 meters, he regained his stance.

“I performed Blood Rupturing Movement with all my strength, but I was still overpowered by him?”?Jian Wushuang thought in surprise.

“Hum, the famous Swordsman is just so-so,” Huangfu Ming said with a cold smile.

“I underestimated you at first. Then, try my sixth move,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“The sixth move, you still can’t overpower me.”

Huangfu Ming lifted his double-edged giant axe, with a rush of battle intent in his eyes. His body became larger at this moment, and a scary aura began gushing out.

The Giant Axe suddenly lashed out.

“Selfless Sword Technique, sixth move!”

While remaining composed, Jian Wushuang swung his long sword again.

Boom!

This time, Jian Wushuang and Huangfu Ming retreated at the same time. Both of them were repelled more than 1,000 meters. Huangfu Ming even retreated to the edge of Heartless City.

This time, the result was a draw.

“Good, you live up to the position of a top expert who ranks 41st on the Bloodmoon List. Since I matched you with the sixth move, accept my seventh move,” Jian Wushuang said, with a casual smile on his face, while lifting his sword.

“The seventh move?” Huangfu Ming’s face changed.

He had performed his best move with that attack, which was barely enough against the sixth move Jian Wushuang displayed. Now, what would happen if Jian Wushuang performed the seventh move?

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice resounded through the area as his Long Sword violently lashed out.

Suddenly, the world fell into darkness.

In the darkness, only a brilliant steak of sword light remained, lighting up the world.

Huangfu Ming began to panic and performed his best move again.

The moment his stroke collided with the streak of sword light, his Giant Axe was knocked away. Then the sword light, still at full power, slashed through Huangfu Ming’s body.

Huangfu Ming widened his eyes, but his body was already split in two.

All the onlookers were shocked.

An eerie silence fell upon all of Heartless City.

Countless eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang slowly withdrew his sword and could not help but shake his head while watching Huangfu Ming’s body fall down.

“He really is strong. If I fought with him a year ago, I would not have killed him so easily. But now, he was not even qualified to see the eighth move.” Jian Wushuang spoke frankly.

On hearing this, everyone was petrified.

“The eighth move?”

“He could perform the eighth move?”

“He, he did not use all of his strength?”

Everyone shouted in shock.

Huangfu Ming, who ranked 41the on the Bloodmoon List, was considered a top Half-saint expert. However, Jian Wushuang killed him without using his full strength. What did it mean?

Their First Protector might not be far off from the strength of a real Saint Realm warrior.

In fact, after a year of cultivation, Jian Wushuang’s strength improved greatly. He could kill a Half-saint expert a year ago, so there was no doubt that he was extremely powerful now.

People haven’t noticed it because he rarely displayed his moves.

“Skywave Prefecture... I originally thought I would go there after a period of practice. Now that the Lord of Skywave Prefecture has come to find me first, I’ll take the next step forward.”?Jian Wushuang thought and looked toward the black-clothed elder.

“Listen, go back to tell your Lord that I will fight to the death with him outside of Heartless City in three days.”
