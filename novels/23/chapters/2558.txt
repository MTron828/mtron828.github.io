Chapter 2559: Ultimate God Realm

Time flowed swiftly like the waters.

A year had passed.

“Mr. Jian Yi, Clan Leader Situ is here.” Xiao Tiexin passed a message.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang immediately opened up his eyes.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang smiled and left the secret chamber right away.

“Mr. Jian Yi.” Situ Yuan was still as humble and polite.

“It’s the one-year deadline and looks like Clan Leader Situ has brought me good tidings,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“I’m glad that we did not fail on your request, Mr. Jian Yi. We’ve sold ninety percent of your resources while the Situ Clan have purchased the remaining ten. The final accumulated Primordial Stones are at two hundred ten thousand pieces which are all kept in this Interspatial Ring. Please have a look.” Situ Yuan passed an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was overjoyed upon receiving the ring and carefully counted.

“Mr. Jian Yi, truthfully those resources are worth more than two hundred forty thousand. You could’ve received two hundred seventy thousand or even two hundred eighty thousand Primordial Stones had we employed certain strategies to liquidate them, but we sold them for you as soon as possible since you’re in urgent need of Primordial Stones,” said Situ Yuan.

“I’m quite happy with two hundred ten thousand pieces. You have my gratitude Clan Leader. I shall remember this forever,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Haha. You’re too polite, Mr. Jian Yi. This is only a small matter, don’t worry about it.” Situ Yuan lightly smiled. “Mr. Jian Yi, I shall say farewell if there isn’t anything other matters.”

“Safe journeys.” Jian Wushuang personally sent off Situ Yuan.

After a while, Jian Wushuang went back inside.

“Liquidating these resources has gotten me two hundred ten thousand Primordial Stones and if I add on the three hundred ninety thousand pieces with me that’s a total of six hundred thousand!” Jian Wushuang tightly held his fists together.

600,000 Primordial Stones was enough for him to make a breakthrough into the Ultimate God Realm.

It was even sufficient for him to upgrade his divine power a little after making his breakthrough.

Jian Wushuang immediately returned to his secret chamber and began to refine the Primordial Stones without any hesitation.

He could not wait to make his breakthrough into the Ultimate God Realm.

Inside the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang took out all his Primordial Stones which piled up the entire chamber. A terrifying power of absorption began soon after.

Jian Wushuang had previously spent almost two months to refine just 160,000 Primordial Stones obtained from the Shi Clan.

He would need at least six months for the entire 600,000 pieces.

However, Jian Wushuang did not mind spending half a year doing so.

Although Pei Qi’s challenge caused quite a stir in the Northern Darkstar Continent with his death causing even bigger stimulation. However, the stir gradually calmed and the continent had returned to its previous peacefulness as time passed.

Another half a year had passed under such peacefulness.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang had absorbed divine powers from the last Primordial Stone.

After a while, a sharp light glowed from within as he opened his eyes.

“Primary-Stage Ultimate God!”

“This is the power that an Ultimate God possesses!”

Jian Wushuang tightly held his fists together and felt the divine power surge in his body.

The divine power was not too much broader than when he was at the Peak Divine Demon level. However, the crux was that it became way more powerful.

A huge gap exists between the Divine Demon Realm and Ultimate God Realm and that made all the difference.

“My divine power’s strength is probably comparable to regular Earth Ultimate Gods the moment I’ve reached Ultimate God Realm while those secret techniques I’ve learned have also gotten quite an upgrade,” mumbled Jian Wushuang to himself.

He did not leave his seclusion right away. Instead, he continued to cultivate his secret techniques.

Once he became an Ultimate God, he could start upgrading his secret techniques by leaps and bounds.

For example, he could begin studying the Primordial Void Celestial Body’s third volume!

The same could be said for the second volume of Seven Stars Secret Technique.

As for the Divine God of Punishment secret technique, he had reached its second stage not too long ago making it impossible to reach the third stage in a short time. However, his God Shadow form could be upgraded slightly.

In the meantime, it was not easy for him to have already reached the Golden Armor in his Nine Sparkle Star Armor, hence there was no way he could upgrade it anytime soon.

It took another six months for him to finally finish cultivating his secret techniques.

Such was also because he had perfect comprehensive and fast understanding skills. A normal cultivator would have needed a very long time to study and cultivate such powerful secret techniques.

Some people had to spend a few hundred years studying one secret technique while it was not surprising either for others to spend even a few thousand years.

In Jian Wushuang’s past life, some people would spend ages studying a secret technique such as Emperor Bai being the typical example.

However, it was as such because the cultivation conditions in his past life were limited.

In his Ancient God Domain’s current life, the needed time to cultivate a secret technique would not take as long as Emperor Bai.

It took only a total of one year with half a year spent absorbing Primordial Stones and the other half cultivating secret techniques.

“I’m currently comparable to regular Earth Ultimate Gods in terms of divine power. My divine power would become even stronger than San Shouwang if I used my secret techniques while my understanding of Space-time Law and Transmigration Law has achieved a major upgrade from the Fengtian Scroll’s assistance these days. I can now more or less be comparable to the level of a regular Earth Ultimate God especially when it comes to Space-time Law...

“I’m not weaker than San Shouwang in terms of divine power and law understanding while my secret techniques can overtake San Shouwang. My only shortcoming right now is Sword Principle!” Jian Wushuang mumbled.

In his recent cultivation, his understanding of the Sword Principle had greatly improved and was only a step from developing his Sword World.

However, that step was a huge leap to take.

San Shouwang was someone who had fully developed his Principle World to the extent of his Principle World ultimately crushed Pei Qi’s Principal World in the battle.

In other words, San Shouwang’s Principle World was incredibly overbearing.

In such a situation, Jian Wushuang would be at a great disadvantage unless he could develop his Sword World to counter it.

“Sword World...”

Jian Wushuang meditated as his mind suddenly shifted, a surging sword essence swept out and formed a huge Sword World which shrouded the entire secret chamber.

Beams of sword essence filled every corner of the chamber.

Jian Wushuang did not feel happy at all.

‘Just like Fan Jianxian, I could easily build a Sword World frame—a model if you will. But that’s only an empty shell without a core. The concept of a real Sword World is completely different altogether,’ thought Jian Wushuang to himself.
