Chapter 1048: Three Moves

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Oh, you agreed to it?” The corner of Jian Wushuang’s mouth lifted to form a smile. He felt no surprise whatsoever.

He knew Patriarch of Empyrean Glory would agree because that was the only way the latter would be able to kill him.

Jian Wushuang didn’t wish for Fourth Sister to risk her life for him. Neither did he want to kill off Jiu Xiu; he still wanted to get secrets out of the latter. Thus, he gave Patriarch of Empyrean Glory such a chance.

“Third Brother.” Su Rou glanced at him.

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He was no fool. Since he dared to demand three head-on moves from Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, he would naturally have the means to take it.

“I’ve learned three Sword Principles in the Heaven and Earth Rank. I’m not weaker than ordinary Celestial Master experts. Moreover, I have the Blood-killing Plate Armor for self-protection. Though it’s not enough to beat Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, it wouldn’t be easy for him to kill me with just three moves,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Up above the Void, Su Rou, Celestial Master Dong Ming, and the other spectators were already standing on the fringe of the battleground, leaving plenty of space for Jian Wushuang and Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

There was a distance of a thousand miles between them as they confronted each other. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I don’t know where you found the confidence to take three of my moves head-on. But since you want to dig your own grave, I’ll naturally help you.” Dim light glinted in Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s pupils. The ruthless aura that he was emanating turned even more ferocious.

“Show me your best moves.” Jian Wushuang gripped his Blood Mountain Sword, his Sword Essence bursting forth and surging toward the sky.

The crowd of spectators couldn’t help holding their breath at the sight of the rise of their two auras.

Suddenly, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory made his move.

“Brat, this is my first move!”

His voice shook the sky, the sound echoing through the Void. Simultaneously, an explosion of light burst forth from within him. His right palm was immediately scorched black and a terrifying power that seemed capable of destroying heaven and earth rapidly concentrated on the palm.

In the blink of an eye, the condensation of power reached its pinnacle.

“Concealed Bat Palm!”

With a wave of his hand, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory immediately grabbed at Jian Wushuang at a lightning speed.

The pitch-black palm continuously enlarged in the Void until it was large enough to cover the sky. In a flash, it emerged in front of Jian Wushuang.

The boundless pressure crushed the space easily, causing the pupils of the spectators to rapidly shrink.

“Such incredible might!”

“Is this the strength of a Celestial Master expert?”

“No. Ordinary Holy Master experts wouldn’t possess such powerful strength. After all, the one who’s making a move is Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.”

Exclamations resounded one after another.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was indeed an infamous character.

It was precisely his powerful and unyielding might that earned him such fame.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was exceptionally solemn when he saw the large, pitch-black palm that had crushed the Void around it flying toward him. He immediately swung his sword in response.

His action carried the power of his three Sword Principles.

An incredibly violent sword light descended.

This sword light was strong and imbued with Yang energy. It carried an aura that seemed capable of wiping out everything before it. It was as if it could rip apart and destroy every scenery.

The attack that Jian Wushuang produced was the strongest one in his repertoire: Earth-shattering Style!

“Bang!”

The terrifying sword light and the lightning-fast, pitch-black palm collided. All of a sudden, the world crashed.

Sword shadows burst forth inside the Void that experienced a frantic collision, easily carving massive space rifts in the Void.

“Crash!” It felt as if the entire world was being mercilessly torn apart.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang’s muffled snort rang as he was flung away by the force of the collision. He was forced backward several tens of thousands of miles.

Once he regained firm footing, he felt a metallic taste in his mouth and promptly coughed up blood.

“The gap between of us sure is big.” He stared fixedly at Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, secretly shaking his head.

He had improved his strength significantly ever since the three Sword Principles that he created reached the Heaven and Earth Rank. It was already very close to the strength of an ordinary Holy Master expert. Even so, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory immediately crushed him. Evidently, his opponent was far stronger than ordinary Holy Master experts.

On the other side, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was frowning. “Looks like I’ve really underestimated you, brat. I didn’t expect your strength to be so close to that of a Holy Master,” he said loudly.

His words immediately prompted cries of surprise among the spectators.

To think that an Eternal Realm expert would possess battle strength close to that of an ordinary Celestial Master!

This fact was inconceivable to them.

“Humph! Don’t feel so proud of yourself. That move isn’t my strongest unique kill and I’ve merely used seventy percent of my strength. I’ll be using my full strength in my second move,” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory said with a sneer.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrunk against his will. He was on his guard.

When he was done speaking, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory slowly lifted his hand. This time, his palm harbored a power that was formed out of two mingling forces.

The two mingling forces which were evidently different yet were perfectly melded by Patriarch of Empyrean Glory. The airflow that revolved around the periphery of his palm took on two colors: one black, and the other a flame-like red.

With the combination of the two strengths, his might suddenly increased sharply. Patriarch of Empyrean Glory once again made his move.

This time, he threw a punch.

The punch caused explosions that detonated the Void. The fist that was wrapped in two mingling forces of black and red harbored enormous strength. It directly streaked across several tens of thousands of miles to arrive in front of Jian Wushuang.

It was frighteningly fast.

It was so fast that Jian Wushuang couldn’t react in time to withstand it. He could only watch as the clenched fist crossed the layers of bombardment to hit his body.

Jian Wushuang felt as if a meteorite had struck him. Even with his Blood-killing Plate Armor diluting nearly 90 percent of that frightening power, the remaining power still wreaked havoc in his body and caused him to tremble violently.

“Pfft!”

Blood spouted from Jian Wushuang’s mouth. Mixed in the blood was traces of his flesh. He was fiercely thrown backward tens of thousands of miles, knocking into countless mountains. In the end, he was embedded inside a large mountain wall.

“Boom!”

The mountain immediately fell apart, causing an explosion of crushed rocks. Jian Wushuang once again appeared in the world.

Only now, he was battered and bloodied all over. His face was so pale that it was nearly colorless. He was an incredibly sad sight.

“What a formidable move.” Jian Wushuang was still experiencing lingering fears at the thought of the punch that he just took on.

Not only was the previous punch exceptionally powerful, but it also harbored a secret strength. That secret strength was like ripples of vibration that pierced Jian Wushuang’s defense and directly set off within him.

That attack was so strange and mysterious that he didn’t immediately notice it. His Blood-killing Plate Armor had no way of warding off or weakening its might as well.

Thus, it resulted in his current pathetic state.
