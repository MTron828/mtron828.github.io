4503 People Die, Lights Go Out

Yan Dan, the head disciple of the God Refining Sect, who had broken through the Scar level, was killed by Jian Wushuang with one finger?

Fu Chen looked at Jian Wushuang in a daze. His throat rolled and he continuously swallowed his saliva.

Something big!

Something big was about to happen!

!!

The head disciple of the God Refining Sect, the next Sect Master of the God Refining Sect, had been killed by Jian Wushuang in an instant!

Just how strong was this Wushuang?

Shock filled Fu Chen’s eyes, his legs trembling.

The next moment.

Then, he saw Jian Wushuang’s gaze fall on him.

He could not help but shiver, and his heart turned cold.

“I… I didn’t see anything.”

Fu Chen swallowed his saliva and subconsciously blurted out while trembling.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered slightly as he looked at Fu Chen’s terrified expression. He could not help but feel a little speechless.

Was he afraid that he would silence him?

Jian Wushuang shook his head and ignored him. He took a step forward and suddenly shot toward the center of the Land of Gods like a cannonball.

In the distance.

The Heaven’s Gate disciples, who had quarreled with Yan Dan outside the Land of Gods, noticed this scene and their pupils shrank.

“Yan Dan, this fellow, actually died in the hands of his fellow disciples?”

The head disciple of the Heaven’s Gate had a serious look in his eyes. He then turned to look at another disciple beside him and asked, “Tianxuan, I’ve been in seclusion all this time and was unaware of the outside world. When did the God Refining Sect produce such a disciple? Who is that person?”

The disciple beside the Heaven’s Gate’s head disciple heard this and replied respectfully, “Eldest Senior Brother, you might not know this, but I heard that in the God Refining Sect’s disciple selection this time, there was a peerless genius called Wushuang. It should be this person.”

“Wushuang?”

The Heaven’s Gate’s first disciple raised his eyebrows and laughed. “This person is quite something. He’s much stronger than that trash Yan Dan.”

After saying that, the Heaven’s Gate’s head disciple shook his head. After a moment of silence, he muttered, “The God Refining Sect has always been on bad terms with our Heaven’s Gate. Now that Yan Dan is dead, I’m afraid that this person is very likely to become the Sect Master of the God Refining Sect in the future. If we have the chance later, it’s best to get this person up and kill him to avoid any future trouble.”

“Yes!” The disciple quickly nodded.

On the other side.

Supreme Bing Ye’s lips curled into a mocking smile as he watched this scene.

“This Jian Wushuang is really a jinx. Wherever he goes, something happens.”

Bang!

In the next moment, he stomped his right foot and immediately turned into a soaring sword light, chasing after Jian Wushuang.

At the end of the crowd.

Supreme Gongyang rubbed his nose and revealed a bitter smile.

“These two people are not the type to stop.”

Shaking his head, he also flew up and turned into a bright light, flying forward.

…

Outside the Land of Gods.

Elder Shen Lian, who was sitting cross-legged in silence, seemed to have sensed something. He frowned and his expression changed.

Then, he flipped his right hand, and an ancient lamp appeared in his palm.

The faint candlelight on the ancient lamp flickered, and in the blink of an eye, the flame on the ancient lamp’s wick was extinguished.

Upon seeing this, Elder Shen Lian’s expression changed drastically. He stood up abruptly and stared at the Land of Gods while screaming.

“My son!!! Yan Dan!!!”

Elder Shen Lian was already in a state of fury. Countless veins were throbbing on his forehead, and his facial features were twisted.

“Who killed my son?!!” Elder Shen Lian roared, his eyes were filled with hatred. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

An extremely terrifying and brutal aura was emitted from his body.

The divine lamp was bound to a wisp of Yan Dan’s life source. The stronger Yan Dan’s life source, the brighter the flame on the divine lamp. On the contrary, the weaker the Yan Dan’s life source, the dimmer the flame on the lamp.

And just now, he had seen the light on the lamp go out with his own eyes.

A person died like a lamp going out.

Now that the lamp was extinguished, it naturally meant that Yan Dan had fallen!

Anger!

An indescribable fury almost burned Elder Shen Lian to ashes!

Yan Dan was dead!

His only son, Yan Dan, whom he had high hopes for, who was going to become the Sect Master of the God Refining Sect in the future, had died in the Land of Gods.

Pfff!

A muffled sound was heard. Elder Shen Lian was so furious that he could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

His head of green hair exploded and turned ashen white. His lips were bloodless and extremely dry.

...

Elder Shen Lian’s eyes were bloodshot as he glared at the Land of Gods. His entire body was trembling with anger.

“Who killed my son? I’ll go to hell and kill you. I’ll also slaughter all your friends and family in this world!”

Elder Shen Lian was on the verge of going crazy. His eyes were filled with ferocity and his face was extremely ferocious.

He had a faint intuition in his heart.

The person who had killed Yan Dan was most likely Wushuang, whom they had regarded as prey!

“Wushuang… It’s definitely Wushuang!”

Elder Divine Sickle stared at the Land of Gods and a look of struggle flashed in his eyes. He could not wait to enter the Land of Gods and kill Jian Wushuang. However, when he saw the rings of restriction light that spread out, a touch of fear appeared on his face.

A moment later, Elder Shen Lian took a deep breath and sat down cross-legged.

“Wushuang, you’d better pray that you die in there. Otherwise, if you come out alive, I’ll skin you alive and torture you in every way I can to make you regret being born!”

A look of hatred and enmity appeared in Elder Shen Lian’s eyes.

…

...

In the Land of Gods.

After Jian Wushuang passed by many Heaven’s Favorites, he did not hold back his aura anymore. He turned his void power into divine power.

Boom!

The cultivation of an Intermediate Supreme martial artist instantly spread out and shot up into the sky, causing thousands of thunderclaps to explode!

An aura of the same origin as the 99 restrictions spread in all directions. The terrifying power of the restrictions suddenly shrieked like a swallow seeing its parents and swept away Jian Wushuang, allowing him to pass.

Behind Jian Wushuang.

Supreme Bing Ye’s Half Invincible Supreme cultivation realm, which was only a step away from the Invincible Supreme, also skyrocketed!

The two of them, one in front and one behind, were like two meteors in the sky river, directly breaking into the deep layer of the Land of Gods!

“Intermediate Supreme realm? This guy has broken through again!”

Supreme Bing Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he felt the imposing aura from Jian Wushuang.

“However, since you have made progress, I have my own opportunities!”

Supreme Bing Ye coldly snorted and lowered his head to look at the silk pouch hanging at his waist.

This silk pouch contained the power of Great Void Divine Emperor’s attack!

This was also the biggest guarantee that he dared to challenge Jian Wushuang and declare that he wanted to kill Jian Wushuang. It was his trump card!

Boom!

He took a step forward and the God Slaying Sword appeared in his hand. He immediately shot it at Jian Wushuang!
