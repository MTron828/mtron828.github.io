“The two of them are aiming at Blood Demon Church!”

Elder Xue Yang felt terrified but he didn’t reply to Jian Wushuang’s question instantly.

He knew clearly how brutal Blood Demon Church’s conduct was. If he were to expose the privacy of the internal Blood Demon Church and they were to find out, he would definitely end miserably.

“Why? You’re not willing to?” Fiery King glanced at Elder Xue Yang, “It seems like you will have to suffer for a bit.”

“Elder Xue Yang,” Jian Wushuang suddenly spoke.

Elder Xue Yang looked at Jian Wushuang subconsciously and was immediately attracted by the glaring crimson light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The crimson light was like a scarlet sun that was extremely eye-catching.

Eighteen Asura Hell instantly descended.

“No, no!!!”

Elder Xue Yang instantly gave out a blood-curdling scream. He fell into the dreamland and was unable to free himself from it.

With Jian Wushuang’s current soul strength, it was close to a Real God’s dreamland when he performed Eighteen Asura Hell with his all and it was extremely torturous to one’s body and mind.

Although Elder Xue Yang was a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, he couldn’t endure the terrifying torture of Eighteen Asura Hell.

“Ah! Ah!!!”

Elder Xue Yang’s eyes were?bloodshot and his face was distorted in agony. He looked extremely ferocious.

The entire heaven and earth was drowned in his shrill scream. Luckily, before Jian Wushuang had pulled him into dreamland, Fiery King had already set up a layer of restraint at the surrounding void. Hence, the scream never spread and there was no communication allowed.

Very soon, Elder Xue Yang walked through each kind of torture in the dreamland and it slowly dispersed.

Elder Xue Yang looked exhausted as he collapsed on the ground. However, there was still an unprecedented fear on his face.

“Elder Xue Yang, the earlier dreamland, do you want to experience it again?” Jian Wushuang glared at Elder Xue Yang and said coldly, “Don’t be in a hurry. We have time. The earlier phantasmagoria, if you are willing to, we can do it ten times or hundred times.”

Ten times? A hundred times?

Just one time could make Elder Xue Yang close to going mad.

“No, no. I’ll say. I’ll tell you everything,” Elder Xue Yang shook his head and shouted.

Jian Wushuang and Fiery King smirked coldly at his reply.

“Jian Wushuang, your torturing measure is really impressive,” Fiery King couldn’t hold back his compliments.

In terms of power, Fiery King might be stronger by one notch. However, in terms of torturing measure, Jian Wushuang, who was a Universe God good at soul attacks, was much more skillful than Fiery King.

When he performed Eighteen Asura Hell with his all, forget about Elder Xue Yang, even an ordinary Real God might not be able to withstand it.

“Tell me, in Blood Demon Church, how many Real Gods are there in total?” Jian Wushuang enquired.

“There’s a total of four. There are three first-stage Void Real God and the other one is the founder of Blood Demon Church who is a Real God who already reached the second stage,” Elder Xue Yang didn’t dare to hide.

“Second stage?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Eternal Real God?” Fiery King’s face grew solemn.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were three stages for a Real God.

The first stage was Void Real God, which was the most ordinary king. In Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, some weaker sects were appendage to Real Gods of that stage. For instance, Seven Planet Palace Master who Jian Wushuang had once suppressed, the Real Gods that were imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, including Fiery God, Blood Emperor, Heartless King and so one, they were all in that stage.

However, Fiery King was considered at the peak of Void Real God.

The second stage of Real God was Eternal Real God.

Real Gods at this stage were much rarer than the first stage Void Real Gods. Even within Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, if an Eternal Real God were willing, he could easily started a force or sect. For instance, most of the deacon elderlies were Eternal Real God.

As for the third stage of Real God, it was known as Chaotic Real God.

Those were Real Gods at the peak. There were very few Real Gods of that stage. Even a force like Lineage of Star had very few Chaotic Real Gods.

Of course, the bunch of Chaotic Real God at the peak were listed on the Real God ranking list. Their fighting power was extremely strong.

Like Lei Chao, he was one of the Chaotic Real God listed on Real God ranking list.

“For the three stages of Real God, every stage marks a vast difference. The Eternal Real God in Blood Demon Church is much scarier than the three Void Real Gods team up,” Fiery God explained.

“Besides the four, is there any other experts in Blood Demon Church? I’m referring to the kind that is always in seclusion and hardly reveal themselves normally,” Jian Wushuang continued to ask.

“I really have no idea,” Elder Xue Yang shook his head and said pathetically, “Mister, although I am an elderly in Blood Demon Church, there are about twenty elderlies like myself in Blood Demon Church. We are considered higher-ups but we have no idea about the core secret in Blood Demon Church. For instance, I have no idea if there’s any hidden expert in Blood Demon Church.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and didn’t doubt what Elder Xue Yang said.

“I have a portrait here. Take a look and see if you know this person or if you have seen this person in Blood Demon Church,” Jian Wushuang took out a painting of Leng Rushuang.

Elder Xue Yang took a look at the portrait and he immediately looked shocked but he immediately shook his head, “Mister, I’ve never seen this person.”

“Are you sure?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“I am sure. After all, a lady that looks this beautiful, if I were to see her, I’d definitely have an impression but I don’t recall at all. This lady is definitely not in Blood Demon Church. Even if she were, I reckon she should be kept as maidservant by the people in the church. A maidservant that is so beautiful, who’s willing to bring her out to share with everyone…” Elder Xue Yang had yet to finish his sentence.

Pak!

Jian Wushuang had already given Elder Xue Yang a tight slap. Then, Elder Xue Yang immediately spat a mouthful of blood and stunned.

“Maidservant?” Jian Wushuang harrumphed coldly.

He knew very clearly that there might be people with great power in the world who could forcefully take control of a Primordial Great Sinner. However, in Blood Demon Church, there wasn’t anyone who had the ability to.

Plus, according to the information that he had gotten from Vientiane Tower, Leng Ruxue’s position in Blood Demon Church was extraordinary.

“You’d better think about it carefully. If you say any more nonsense, you’re going to die,” Jian Wushuang bellowed.

“Yes, yes.”

Elder Xue Yang nodded continuously and his eyes suddenly twinkled, “Yeah, mister. There’s a mysterious person in Blood Demon Church. He might be the person you’re looking for.”

“A mysterious person?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “Tell me.”
