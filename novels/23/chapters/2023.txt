2024 Brutal

As expected, as the cultivators went ahead one after another, there was hardly anyone who could last for ten breaths in the fight against silver-armored Dao soldiers.

Among the three to four contestants, there was only one who passed the first round.

The time flew past. In the blink of an eye, the silver-armored Dao soldiers had already fought with more than half of the contestants.

“Next, Ah Shou!” The elder called.

“Haha, it’s finally my turn,” Jian Wushuang let out a burst of hearty laughter. Before everyone’s gaze, he walked forward.

Everyone focused their attention on Jian Wushuang.

Because Jian Wushuang’s aura was so powerful, they can’t belittle him.

Jian Wushuang came before the silver-armored Dao soldiers and he felt the prohibition of the ten thousand miles range.

“Begin,” the elder said. The silver-armored Dao soldiers didn’t hesitate and rushed out.

Then, Jian Wushuang smiled maliciously without fear. He charged out fiercely as well.

“What is this guy doing?” The surrounding spectators were surprised.

Everyone knew that Dao soldier was powerful. Hence, no one would opt to fight a ferocious fight against the silver-armored Dao soldier head-on. They would normally rely on their own skills to drag the silver-armored Dao soldier on. It would be enough if they could drag them on for ten breaths of time.

Jian Wushuang was the first who charge at the silver-armored Dao soldier and obviously wanted to fight it head-on.

“Take my punch.”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and there was a bolt of divine power that soared in his hand and became a huge fist.

The silver-armored Dao soldiers punched ferociously too.

Both parties fought head-on without any patterns.

Bang!

There was a low thud. Jian Wushuang took one step back from the impact from the collision of the terrifying power but the silver-armored Dao soldiers didn’t move at all.

“D*mn it. This thing’s punch is tough. However, I am not afraid of anyone’s punch,” Jian Wushuang raged furiously and there was boundless anger in his eyes.

“King of Beast’s Divine Punch…”

Roar!

There was a faint roar and there was a shadow of a huge beast that appeared from nowhere behind Jian Wushuang.

His punch brought about a hit as powerful as a thunderbolt.

One punch was followed by another.

Every punch contained the power that shook all cultivators at the scene.

The silver-armored soldier had no emotions but only knew to punch ferociously against Jian Wushuang.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There was a continuous collision of punches that reverberated in the independent space. There was a large amount of power that dispersed in all directions and caused a huge movement after every collision.

Jian Wushuang also fought ferociously against the silver-armored Dao soldier.

The people who were watching the fight looked dumbfounded.

“This person is so powerful!”

“How dare he fight against silver-armored Dao soldiers with punches and strength!? He didn’t have the lower hand at all. With that in itself, he should be in the top ten among the contestants in this ranking competition.

“Not only is he powerful, he is terrifyingly fierce and… brutal. Yeah, brutal.”

The surrounding people nodded simultaneously.

The vibe that Jian Wushuang gave was too brutal.

It was so brutal that it struck fear in the others. He was simply a war chariot that elbowed and jostled its way around. He wasn’t a person anyone wanted to offend.

As Jian Wushuang fought with the silver-armored Dao soldiers, ten breaths of time passed.

The silver-armored Dao soldiers stopped. Although Jian Wushuang was still soaring with battle intention, he stopped too.

Jian Wushuang then exited the ten thousand miles range.

He exited and glanced at the other cultivators. He then broke into a smirk, “A bunch of puss*es! What are you looking at? Are you afraid of me now? If you are, admit defeat if you plan to go against me in the second round. Then, I won’t have to beat you up! If you don’t surrender, I will defeat all of you one by one!!”

Then, Jian Wushuang walked to the side arrogantly.

Although the cultivators looked upset, no one stood against him.

The power that Jian Wushuang had put on display was amazing. There were very few of them who were confident in winning against him,

Among the crows, the handsome Lin Tianhao and the lady in green stood side by side.

Then, a young man in purple robe walked over, “Brother Tianhao, where does this Ah Shou come from? How could he be this powerful and he could fight head-on with the silver-armored Dao soldiers?”

“There are so many unknown experts in Three-Emperors World. Who knows where this reckless b*stard comes from,” Lin Tianhao replied in disdain.

“Brother Tianhao, you fought with this Ah Shou before. What do you think of his power?” The young man in purple robe continued to ask.

“He is quite powerful. His punch skills are okay. That’s all I know. After all, I only fought with him for a short instant. I didn’t put all my skills to play. As for if he used all his skills, I am not sure myself,” Lin Tianhao replied.

“I see,” the young man in purple robe nodded faintly. He looked at Jian Wushuang with a tinge of fear in his eyes, “This Ah Shou is so brutal and he is so terrifyingly powerful. I hope that I won’t have to go up against him in the second round.

The ranking competition continued.

After Jian Wushuang, there was quite a number of cultivators that fought against the silver-armored Dao soldiers, including the handsome Lin Tianhao.

Among the hundred experts in early stage chaotic realm that joined the ranking competition, Lin Tianhao was among the few on the top. He could be said to be one of the few strongest experts. It was not surprising that he passed the first round.

The first round of ranking competition ended very quickly.

There were originally over a hundred cultivators but it was left with only thirty-six people left after the first round of the ranking competition.

Among the thirty-six contestants, they had to fight for the five quotas.

The rules for the second round was very easy. They would fight one-on-one after drawing lots. When the nine final candidates were sifted out, there would be a rotation battle. Then, they could decide on the five strongest candidates.

After drawing lots, the elder announced the first pair of opponents.

The opponent that Jian Wushuang was going against in the first battle was Qiu Ming. Jian Wushuang looked around and saw the man in a purple robe who was standing next to Lin Tianhao.

“He is my first opponent?” Jian Wushuang scoffed.

The man in a purple robe looked distressed.

He had been praying hard to not go up against Jian Wushuang earlier. But the moment the second round commenced, he was allocated to fight against Jian Wushuang.
