4210 Divine Lord Mu Chong

When the Ultimate Rulers saw the two golden words ‘Blood Sword’ on the stone tablet, they felt a chill run up their spines and up to their heads. Their bodies trembled and they did not dare to speak anymore.

“The Blood Sword has yet to stop. I’m afraid that its target is the first city’s city Lord who is ranked first.” The Ultimate Ruler who had revealed the truth earlier muttered to himself.

The rules of the ancient path of stars did not necessarily state that one had to be near the first city in order to be able to challenge The Second City. If one wanted to, even if one was ranked last in the first city, one could still challenge the people in The Second City.

For example, the first city’s city Lord, Ruler Bone Armor, was the strongest person in the first city. Naturally, he had the power to enter the second or even the third city.

!!

However, rather than being the last in the second and third cities, he might as well be the governor of the first city. That would be more practical.

…

On the streets of the first city, Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm as he walked slowly.

The Wuqi Divine Sword, which was attached to his waist, had not been unsheathed from the beginning to the end. To Jian Wushuang, these Ultimate Rulers were enough to crush him when he was a fourth-level Ruler, let alone now that he had broken through to the fifth-level Ruler.

No one could take a single move from him.

510th place.

438th place.

219th place…

Third place!

Jian Wushuang’s speed did not stop for a moment. In just half a day, he had risen to the third place!

At that moment, not only the people outside the city began to pay attention to Jian Wushuang’s ranking, but even those who had been defeated by Jian Wushuang in the first city had walked to the streets and followed Jian Wushuang without saying a word.

In the beginning, there was only one person following Jian Wushuang.

As more and more people were defeated by Jian Wushuang, his ranking became higher and higher. Gradually, the number of people following Jian Wushuang also became a dense black mass at a speed visible to the naked eye.

They followed Jian Wushuang from a distance and looked at his back with respect.

Among them, there were many who had looked down on Jian Wushuang when they first saw that he was only at level five. But now, they were completely convinced by the strength that Jian Wushuang had displayed and were in awe of him.

Thump thump thump.

Under countless gazes, Jian Wushuang took off the wooden token of the Second Palace and knocked on the door of the Second Palace.

A moment later, a handsome young man in white walked out of the palace with a cold face and a scimitar in his hand.

First city, second place, Divine Lord Mu Chong!

In the first city of the ancient road of the star Palace, the rankings on the stone stele were constantly changing. After all, everyone was an Ultimate Ruler, and the stronger ones had long since walked ahead of them. Thus, the remaining Ultimate Rulers were actually not too far apart in terms of strength, and it was a common thing for the rankings to change.

However, in these thousands of years, only two people’s names had never changed!

The two of them were the first and second ranked Bone Armor God, Divine Lord Mu Chong!

It was said that Divine Lord Mu Chong’s talent was astonishing. From the start of his cultivation to becoming an Ultimate Ruler, he had only spent a few chaos cycles. He might not be comparable to the divine sons and Divine Sons of the universe, but he was still one of the top geniuses among ordinary Ultimate Rulers!

For thousands of years, ever since Divine Lord Mu Chong stepped onto the ancient path of stars, he had firmly occupied second place and had never changed his position!

“I wonder if the Blood Sword will be able to defeat divine Lord Mu Chong with its previous battle record.”

“Divine Lord Mu Chong is the first city’s pride and joy. We don’t know how many people have lost to him. Even though the Blood Sword has displayed extraordinary power, it’s still unknown if it can be a match for Divine Lord Mu Chong.”

“That’s right. It has been close to a few thousand years since Divine Lord Mu Chong has fought. no one can say for sure how strong he has become.”

Outside the city, quite a few Ultimate Rulers were looking at the stone stele and discussing it.

If someone had told them that a Ruler of the fifth level could rise from the last place all the way to the third place in the first city, they would have scoffed at it and treated it as a joke.

But now, the fact was right in front of them. They no longer looked down on Jian Wushuang.

However, Divine Lord Mu Chong had used tens of thousands of years to build up his reputation. Hence, they were more inclined to believe that Divine Lord Mu Chong would win.

At the same time, a heated discussion erupted in the first city.

“Although Divine Lord Mu Chong is very strong, the strength of the Blood Sword can not be underestimated. One must know that the Blood Sword has only used one finger to reach this point!”

“I bet that the Blood Sword will win this battle!”

“No matter what, there’s going to be a good show to watch this time.”

The people in the city knew more about Jian Wushuang’s terror than the people outside the city!

The outsiders only saw Jian Wushuang’s ranking rise, but they did not see that the opponent he had defeated had only used one finger from the beginning to the end!

As everyone discussed, Divine Lord Mu Chong walked out of the palace.

He did not pay attention to the discussion but looked at Jian Wushuang up and down. Then he frowned and said, “A fifth-stage chief Ruler?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm. He had heard this question more than a hundred times since he entered the ancient path of stars.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded frankly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Interesting,” Divine Lord Mu Chong smiled and continued, “it’s not easy to reach this point as a fifth stage great Ruler. Even if your talent isn’t as good as mine, it shouldn’t be too far off. How about this? I’ll give you a chance. Cultivate to the level of an Ultimate Ruler first, then come fight me.”

With that, Divine Lord Mu Chong planned to return to the palace. He was originally very interested but after thousands of years, someone had finally walked up to him and attacked him.

When the results came out, he only saw a fifth stage Ruler. He immediately felt that the meaning was dull.

He had become famous at a young age and had always been proud. In his opinion, even if his opponent was not the Young Emperor of a Divine Kingdom or the Divine Son of a sacred land, he should at least be a top-tier Ultimate Ruler.

What was a mere fifth stage chief Ruler worth?

Many of the Ultimate Rulers who saw this could not help but shake their heads.

“Divine Lord Mu Chong is still as arrogant as ever.”

“Hmph, it seems like Divine Lord Mu Chong’s arrogance has grown to the point where he is conceited over the past few thousand years.”

“In my opinion, the Blood Sword has arrived at the right time. It’s about time the first city of the ancient path of stars is reshuffled!”

They were discussing in low voices.

As for Jian Wushuang, he squinted his eyes and a strange expression appeared on his face.
