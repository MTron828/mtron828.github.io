4817 Going to Upper Desolate

After traveling for less than half a day, the Sect Elders and a group of disciples who had come to find Xi Qingchi appeared in front of them.

“Uncle Li, you guys are finally here!” Xi Qingchi’s face was filled with anger. “If you had come a little later, were you planning to go to the demon’s lair to find me?”

The Elder known as Uncle Li had a calm expression and held a jade staff in his hand. After hearing her complaints, he smiled bitterly. “My Little Ancestor, we’ve all been trying our best to find you. We’ll definitely find you in less than half a day.”

Xi Qingchi snorted, then picked up the red ribbon tied to the Demon Lord and shook it. “I’ve already caught this guy. Let’s return to the sect!”

Uncle Li was stunned. Before he could calm down, the figure in Xi Qingchi had already swept into the distance like a graceful swan.

Jian Wushuang and Di Qing followed him.

On a misty mountain, there were more than 100 chains that cut across the mountains, connecting the sects on each peak together. It was a majestic sight.

This was the most famous sect in the entire Qingzhou. It was called the Shangqing Pavilion. Almost half of the cultivators in the Qingzhou Yeavenly Region were proud to cultivate in the Shangqing Pavilion.

This was because the Sect Master of the Shangqing Pavilion was a powerful Yan Immortal, and he had more than a dozen powerful disciples who had entered the Yan stage. No matter which Heavenly Region he was on, he was an existence that dominated.

The great Mountain-Guarding Formation that enveloped the entire Shangqing Pavilion also showed its transcendent status.

Although the Mountain-Guarding Formation could be easily destroyed by Jian Wushuang, he still restrained his aura and prepared to enter the mountain gate of Shangqing Pavilion with Di Qing.

However, immediately after, more than ten disciples who were guarding the mountain flew out from the dark and stopped them.

“Shangqing Pavilion is an important place, outsiders are not allowed!”

“A bunch of stupid things, can’t you see that this lady invited an important guest?” Xi Qingchi turned around and scolded angrily.

“It’s alright, Miss Xi. We won’t go in. We’ll wait here for a day. If it’s really inconvenient for Miss Xi, we’ll take our leave,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently. He took a few steps back and waited quietly.

“Hmm, okay. I’ll go with you after I get my things.” Xi Qingchi said hurriedly. Then, her figure flashed and she directly entered the mountain gate.

Looking at her figure, Jian Wushuang had a premonition that something was off.

…

“Why can’t I go? I must go today!”

Inside the Shangqing Pavilion.

Xi Qingchi stood on a mountain rock and shouted angrily with her hands on her hips. She had already changed from her red makeup to a plain shirt.

“You dare ask me to lure out the Nightmare Demon Lord? And now, you don’t dare let me travel outside our Heavenly Region? ”

“Nonsense! Qingchi, hurry up and come down!” a middle-aged man in a white robe, who had a myriad of brilliance hidden within him, shouted angrily. His every move was surging with Yan power.

Xi Qingchi still had her hands on her hips. “I won’t. Xi Qinghua, do you agree or not?”

“I don’t agree!” The middle-aged man was furious. “You wretched girl, do you know your place? Do you know what a Heavenly Region is? A little girl like you, you couldn’t even get out of the Heavenly Region before you were torn apart by the astral wind!”

“Don’t give me that. I’ve heard this kind of lie a lot. Don’t try to lie to me, I’m leaving this time, no one can stop me!” Xi Qingchi shouted.

The middle-aged man clearly had no intention of tolerating this unruly and willful girl. With a wave of his hand, thousands of wisps of light immediately firmly wrapped around Xi Qingchi and dragged her down from the mountain rock.

“Just you wait, girl. You can forget about getting out even if you miss 1 year out of 100 years of confinement!”

“Ah! No, Father, I don’t want to be confined!” Xi Qingchi screamed and struggled, but she was only at the peak of the Entry Yan stage. How could she break free from the restraints of a Yan Immortal?

Right at this moment, a stream of light instantly shot down from the mountain rock, directly cutting off the light in the middle-aged man’s hand. Then, he directly carried Xi Qingchi on his back and ran.

Due to its extreme speed, by the time he reacted, the stream of light had already fled more than a hundred miles away.

It was a strange beast that was completely snow-white and looked like a fox but also like a mystic tiger. It was so fast that it carried Xi Qingchi and escaped from the mountain gate of Shangqing Pavilion in a flash.

“All Elders and disciples of the Shangqing Pavilion, listen up. Capture Xi Qingchi alive. I’ll bethroth her… to whoever that catches her!”

For a moment, all the sects of the Shangqing Pavilion were in an uproar. A total of more than 60,000 disciples were all dispatched to capture Xi Qingchi alive!

Jian Wushuang, who had been waiting outside the mountain mate, raised his eyebrows slightly when he heard the warning that resounded through the sky.

A moment later, a gust of fragrant wind swept out from the mountain gate. Xi Qingchi, who was riding on the back of the strange beast, was excited. “My Lord, my father has agreed. Let’s run!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang and Di Qing looked at each other and then shook their heads helplessly.

In this originally misty and aloof mountain gate, a grand chase was staged.

Three figures broke through the clouds and flew up, followed by tens of thousands of disciples. They were quite frightened.

However, with the help of Jian Wushuang and Di Qing, the tens of thousands of disciples could only watch the three figures disappear into the sky like stars.

The middle-aged man rushed over after a while, but when he saw that the clouds had already been emptied, there was no sign of his daughter.

He was in despair and roared, “Who is it? Who took my daughter away!”

In the distance, the sound of Xi Qingchi seemed to come from the heavens, “Father, don’t worry. I will be safe and sound. Maybe I will find mother in the process of my travels in the future…”

“You’re gonna anger me to death…”

The clouds and smoke dispersed, and the blue sky disappeared. In its place was an endless void.

Countless suns and stars decorated it, and many Heavenly Regions and planes also entered her eyes.

“It’s so beautiful. No wonder my mother left my father to travel in the void!” Xi Qingchi muttered.

Jian Wushuang did not want to ask about her family’s private affairs. He also knew that the girl had snuck out without her father’s permission, so he planned to send her back once he knew the exact location of the Upper Desolate.

Then, he asked, “I say, Miss Xi, do you know where the Upper Desolate Heavenly Region is?”

Xi Qingchi regained her senses and blinked her lively eyes. Then, she said with certainty, “I know, I definitely know. It’s there.”

With that, she stretched out her slender palm and pointed to a desolate void where even the sun and stars were rare.

Jian Wushuang and Di Qing were on their last legs. They did not care if she was telling the truth or not. After confirming it again, they moved forward.

With his Yan power’s protection, even though Xi Qingchi was only at the peak of Entry Yan cultivation realm, she could still deal with the terrifying void astral winds with ease.
