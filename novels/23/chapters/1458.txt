Chapter 1459: Universe God Long Xiu

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In Sky Sword Prison, in the depths of the forest, Jian Wushuang was sitting on a huge rock as he slowly opened his eyes.

“My soul strength has reached the limitation of a Universe God!”

There was a smile plastered on Jian Wushuang’s face.

For a hundred and seventy years, when he was wandering in Sky Sword Prison, he was mostly fighting against experts to train his swordsmanship and close combat power.

As for soul attacks… for one hundred and seventy years, he had almost never used any Soul Attack.

However, what Jian Wushuang had never expected was that even when he didn’t intentionally improve his Soul strength, it had reached the limit of a Universe God’s in the hundred and seventy years.

At that level, it was already at the limit that a Universe God could reach. Any higher would be the level of Real God.

Reaching such state, Jian Wushuang’s soul attack would be a notch higher compared to before. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Plus, in the hundred and seventy years, his swordsmanship and close combat power would improve tremendously. His overall power was one notch higher compared to before.

“The current me, if my full power were to be put into full play, out of the experts in the third level in Sky Sword Prison, I would be at the top. I am even close to the second level. It’s a pity that I never created any Real God unique skills and yet I can be compared favorably with the experts truly in the second level,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

With the aid of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation, his comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine improved tremendously too.

However, to be truly evenly matched with the Real Gods who comprehended the Power of Heaven Way on the second level, he still had a way to go.

“Continue to train!”

Jian Wushuang smiled and soon continued his journey in Sky Sword Prison again.

During his journey, although he had never once kill any Universe God, he wasn’t in a hurry.

To him then, it was most important to continuously improve his power. As for the massacre… it wasn’t time yet.

In the cold void, there was a breeze blowing. Against one’s body, it made one’s heart cold too.

Jian Wushuang, in a crimson robe and carrying his sword on his back, moved forwards slowly as his Soul Power swept across.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked as he noticed a figure that appeared within the coverage of his Soul sensory.

It was a blonde-haired, brawny man. Even though he was far away, Jian Wushuang could feel the raging tyrannical aura in his body.

The blonde-haired brawny man reminded people of a ruthless lion.

“Universe God Long Xiu?”

There was a glimpse of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and he immediately plunged towards where the blond-haired brawny man was.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang appeared before the blonde-haired brawny man.

“If I’m not mistaken, you’re Jian Wushuang who just got into Sky Sword Prison, right?” The blond-haired brawny man glared coldly at Jian Wushuang.

“I am,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “I’ve been wandering around Sky Sword Prison for a hundred and seventy years and I have fought many experts. However, it is my first time seeing you, Universe God Long Xiu.”

“You knew my identity but you have the guts to appear before me so frankly. You… are very courageous,” The blond-haired brawny man Universe God Long Xiu said.

Jian Wushuang smiled at his reply.

However, he knew clearly that Universe God Long Xiu said so not because he was arrogant, but because he had the right to.

Universe God Long Xiu. Among the experts in Sky Sword Prison, he was on the third level but he was at the top of the third level.

Plus, Universe God Long Xiu was widely recognized as the most annoying one by all Universe Gods in Sky Sword Prison.

He cultivated an impressive secret skill in martial art motion. His martial art motion was known as the first in Sky Sword Prison!

Secondly, he was also good at his travel speed. When he runs at full speed, even a Real God couldn’t catch up with him.

As for his divine body, he too was strong. In combination with defense secret skill and defense treasure, many Real Gods’ defense power couldn’t be evenly matched with his.

A Universe God who possessed terrifying martial art motion, fast in speed, strong divine body and almost no weakness. He could move around Sky Sword Prison as freely as he wished.

There was a rumor that he had once met one of the Kings of the first level in Sky Sword Prison. The King took action against him but didn’t manage to kill him.

One should know that the strongest in Sky Sword Prison was the four Kings.

Even the Kings couldn’t take care of him. Who else could kill him?

Because so, although Universe God Long Xiu was only on the top of the third level, he could move around Sky Sword Prison freely. Many experts on the second level who met him would opt to detour without hesitation.

But then, Jian Wushuang took the initiative when he found Universe God Long Xiu.

That was why Universe God Long Xiu had complemented his courage.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re just a newbie. You didn’t find a place to hide but wandered around to fight against experts. It seems that you are trying to train yourself using the experts in Sky Sword Prison. Now, you took the initiative to look for me. Why? You want me to be one of your whetstones too?” Universe God Long Xiu glared at Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, you live up to your reputation, Universe God Long Xiu. You could tell the purpose of my visit at first glance. However, the purpose of my visit is not only treating you as one of the whetstones but also, if possible, I’d like to take your head,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

Universe God Long Xiu’s face grew solemn.

In Sky Sword Prison, only he would ask for trouble with the others and take their heads. Since when there was someone who would boast shamelessly that they wanted to take his head instead!?

“You’re asking for death!”

Universe God Long Xiu took action directly as he bellowed.

He turned into a beast and a terrifying, raging aura spread.

Wow!

A simple charge and there were nine shadows that plunged from the void.

The nine shadows looked so surreal.

“This martial art motion…” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows as a shrill light flashed in his eyes.

“Behind!”

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power instantly locked onto his target, Universe God Long Xiu. He turned instantly and wielded Blood Mountain Sword smoothly.

The soaring murderous intention of Universe God Long Xiu led to flowing golden light from his body. Both his hands turned into claws. Wow! Wow! Wow!

In the void, there were suddenly three golden claw marks. The three claw marks tore the void. Dang! Dang! Dang! The claw mark collided with Blood Mountain Sword and the impact exploded. Universe God Long Xiu went illusionary and appeared in the nine shadows again while his real body appeared next to Jian Wushuang.

His right index fingers were engulfed with intense golden light. The golden light was like a golden long spear aiming at Jian Wushuang’s skull.

Jian Wushuang shook and his arms moved in a creepy manner. The sword slashed and Universe God Long Xiu retreated.

Universe God Long Xiu harumphed coldly. Suddenly, there were shadows in the surrounding void again. The shadows hemmed Jian Wushuang in and they launched attacks at him simultaneously.
