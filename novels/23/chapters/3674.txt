Chapter 3675: Wake Up

Jian Wushuang also knew why the White Emperor was so afraid of those ancient experts.

After all, the Eternal Chaotic World had almost been destroyed by those ancient experts tens of millions of years ago.

Of course, those were mainly the experts left behind by the three saint realm camps. The people left behind by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect would not pose a threat to the Eternal Chaotic World, after all, the Eternal Chaotic World was derived from the Seven Star Divine Realm.

“Don’t worry. Since I can open the passage to the Divine Beginning Realm, I naturally have ways to restrain the ancient experts who have awakened. With me around, they won’t act recklessly.” Jian Wushuang’s words were filled with absolute confidence.

He was indeed confident.

Whether it was the experts left behind by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect or the people left behind by the three Saint Realm camps, they did not need to care anymore.

Not to mention that this was the Eternal Chaotic World, the strength of the ancient experts would be greatly suppressed. Even in the Divine Beginning Realm, their strength would be at its peak, Jian Wushuang could still easily suppress them.

The only one who was more troublesome was probably that existence.

“White Emperor, let’s go meet the ancient experts.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and waved his hand again.

The world changed. The people who were originally in the dark void came to a huge ancient battlefield in the blink of an eye.

This ancient battlefield was the huge battlefield where the Green Fire World was located.

Over the years, because the spiritual power of the Green Fire World began to recover rapidly, the spiritual Qi of the ancient experts became more and more abundant. This led to the ancient experts who were scattered around the Eternal Chaotic World sleeping, most of them came here.

There were a lot of ancient experts who were sleeping on the ancient battlefield.

“Everyone from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, wake up.”

Jian Wushuang looked down at the ancient battlefield and said softly.

His voice was very casual, but it carried a transcendent will and spread out at an astonishing speed. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This ancient battlefield, and even the entire Eternal Chaotic World, a large number of experts from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect camp who had been sleeping here since the world-ending battle, regardless of how long they had been sleeping…regardless of their current state, they could hear this voice extremely clearly. At the same time, they could also sense that transcendent will.

Immediately, the experts from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect who were sleeping on the ancient battlefield and in the Eternal Chaotic World woke up.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

The world began to shake.

Ancient and majestic auras rose from every corner of the Eternal Chaotic World, especially on the ancient battlefield where the Green Fire World was located.

Jian Wushuang, the White Emperor, and hundreds of high-level experts of the Eternal Chaotic World gathered in the void of the ancient battlefield, at this moment, they could clearly sense the terrifying aura that came from their surroundings, which made them tremble and suffocate.

Any one of these auras gave people the feeling that they could not block it.

Among the hundreds of cultivators in the Eternal Chaotic World, most of them were trembling even though they were ‘Rulers’. Even those ‘Rulers’ who had reached the top level were trembling, their hearts were also trembling.

Even the White Emperor had a terrible look on his face.

Only Jian Wushuang had a faint smile on his face when he sensed the rising auras.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Towering figures rushed over from every corner of the ancient battlefield.

In the blink of an eye, more than 100 ancient experts had arrived, and the number was still increasing.

An hour later, there were more than 400 ancient experts, some of whom Jian Wushuang had seen before.

Saint Soul, Granny Snake Flower, Icefire Saint, Old Monster Mang, and Barbaria Ruler had all helped him in the past.

Among them, there was One Star Weng.

“Haha, I was wondering who it was. So It’s you, little guy.” One Star Weng saw Jian Wushuang in front of him and immediately understood that it was Jian Wushuang who had woken them up. He could not help laughing heartily.

“One Star Weng, long time no see.” Jian Wushuang also smiled slightly.

One Star Weng had once saved his life and given him an opportunity. Although the strength of One Star Weng was nothing in front of him now, Jian Wushuang had been anxious about that favor. Therefore, he treated One Star Weng differently, Jian Wushuang’s attitude was naturally different.

“This time, there are quite a lot of people who have woken up. Except for those top existences, most of the others are here.” One Star Weng looked around the void.

“Well, the battle was too heavy. There were very few experts left in the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. More than 90% of the experts who slept in this realm for countless years died or could never wake up again. Now, we are the only ones who can be woken up,” Granny Snake Flower said.

“Little guy, you woke us up this time. Do you need our help?” One Star Weng looked at Jian Wushuang.

“No rush. Let’s wait for them to come,” Jian Wushuang said.

One Star Weng and the others nodded secretly. They were not in a hurry. After all, the spiritual power in the ancient battlefield was quite strong. Even if they did not sleep, they could stay for a long time.

While everyone was waiting, nine figures flew over as if they had discussed it.

Seeing the nine figures, One Star Weng, Granny Snake Flower, and the others who had arrived earlier immediately showed respect.

Jian Wushuang also smiled when he saw the nine people.

He had seen all nine of them.

Eight of them were the eight experts who had helped him greatly when he was awakened by Xuan Yi during his reincarnation. At that time, Jian Wushuang did not know how strong these eight people were, but now he could tell at a glance.

These eight people were all Principles Masters, and three of them were very strong among Principles Masters.

As for the other person, he was wearing a white robe. His skin was fair and his face was as warm as jade, but he was extremely cold. There seemed to be no emotion in his eyes. He stood at the front, and the eight Principles Masters faintly took him as their leader.

The moment this person arrived, Jian Wushuang immediately felt a shocking sword essence from him. That sword essence was not only powerful and terrifying, but it could also activate the universe origin of Sword Principle!

In the entire Divine Beginning Realm, there was only one other person who could activate the universe origin of sword principle who had reached the fourth stage of sword principle.

Di Shisan!
