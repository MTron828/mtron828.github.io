5065 Opportunity to Transcend to the Grand Yan Immortal Cultivation Realm

The Boyang Bottle, within which 3,000 worlds grand worlds could be hidden, was known as the ‘Infinite Bottle’.

It was the companion of Emperor Yang Jun.

Always worn by Jian Wu Shuang, all the opportunities and items he had acquired since arriving in the Great Yan Domain were hidden within the Boyang Bottle.

Now that he saw the Boyang Bottle again, Jian Wushuang tensed up.

The expression on the Young Emperor’s face also momentarily became unnatural, but he quickly smiled and said, “Uncle Yu, the journey from the Heavenly Court to the Six Heavens Realm is quite far, and you must be a bit tired. I’ve already prepared some fine wine…”

Uncle Yu waved his hand and looked at Jian Wushuang with a gentle gaze. “Young Friend, this item belongs to you.”

He nodded.

“That’s good. Now that it’s returned to its original owner, I can rest easy,” Uncle Yu said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang cupped his hands in thanks and quickly put away the Boyang Bottle.

He added, “Oh right, I haven’t opened this small bottle of yours. It’s always in its initial state.”

With just a cursory glance, Jian Wushuang knew that the Boyang Bottle had indeed never been opened, and the faint sealed aura still lingered.

He heaved a sigh of relief and then cupped his hands in relief.

Uncle Yu smiled and nodded. “Young friend, you don’t have to be so polite. This is what I should do. Take a look and see if there’s anything missing.”

Jian Wushuang did not even look at it. He tied the Boyang Bottle to his waist and said, “Uncle Yu jests. The fact that you have returned what I have lost is already my good fortune. If I were to investigate further, I would truly be a petty person.”

“Haha!” Uncle Yu laughed. “Interesting, how amusing.”

“Don’t be coy. Did you come all this way just to deliver a little bottle?” the Young Emperor asked as he shook his head. “Did you bring any treasures with you?”

“You, indeed, can’t hide anything from me,” Uncle Yu said helplessly. “Of course, I’ve brought treasures for you.”

“Quickly, show them to me!” the young Emperor said eagerly.

“This time’s treasure is extraordinary,” Uncle Yu appeared quite mysterious as he casually brushed his hand, and a palm-sized jade box landed on the desk.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes moved slightly and he roughly guessed what was in the jade box.

The Young Emperor impatiently opened the box, and the hall was immediately filled with brilliant light and a rainbow of colors.

The incredibly rich fragrance of medicine almost solidified, bringing a sense of refreshment and joy upon inhaling it.

Inside the jade box were two pills.

The pill was almost transparent, and the supreme fate energy contained within it was like a cloud that rose and spun.

With just one glance, Jian Wushuang knew that these two pills must be Zhen Wuyang’s painstaking work!

In fact, the value of these two pills was even higher than Emperor Liu Ya’s emperor-grade pills!

This was because he could feel that the fate energy contained in these two pills had long surpassed the power of the Yan Immortal realm and had reached a different level.

Who could condense the fate energy of a Grand Yan Immortal into a pill?

Only an Emperor.

When he opened the jade box and saw that it contained pills, the Young Emperor could not hide the disappointment in his eyes. “There, there’s nothing special about this.”

“…”

“…”

The only one who could disdain pills of this level was probably Young Emperor. Even an ordinary Yan Immortal, with even the most mediocre aptitude, would ascend to the rank of a Grand Yan Immortal within a year of consuming one of these pills. This was the terrifying level of these two pills.

Uncle Yu smiled. “Yan’er, you just have to try. Leave the rest to…”

Before he could finish his sentence, the Young Emperor raised his head and swallowed the two pills like he was eating beans.

“…”

“…”

“I ate it, but it didn’t seem to have any effect.” The Young Emperor rubbed his belly and raised his eyebrows at Uncle Yu.

Indeed, when the two pills were ingested, there was no awe-inspiring scene as expected, not even a hint of mystical change; it was as if they had disappeared without a trace.

“Who, who asked you to eat both of them…” The corner of Uncle Yu’s eyes twitched. “One of them was supposed to be for Young Friend Jian Wushuang.”

The Young Emperor’s eyes widened. “Ah?? Why didn’t you say so earlier? Do you want me to spit it out?”

Uncle Yu smiled bitterly. “You are always so impatient.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He scratched his head. “You can’t blame me, Uncle Yu. You didn’t explain yourself.”

Then, Uncle Yu looked at Jian Wushuang apologetically, “Wushuang, it’s my fault. I’ll ask the Emperor for another one for you.”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang shook his head hurriedly, “Uncle Yu, you don’t have to do that. I’ve never done anything good for the Heavenly Court, and receiving this pill would make me feel undeserving. I can’t bear it.”

“Besides, it’s the correct choice to let Young Emperor eat both pills. Please don’t make things awkward for me.”

Uncle Yu said with some difficulty, “But this pill was given by the Emperor to thank you for protecting the Young Emperor back then.”

“There’s really no need. The pill is too precious. I definitely can’t accept it.” Jian Wushuang shook his head firmly.

He understood the importance of these pills; they guaranteed the ascent of a Yan Immortal to a Grand Yan Immortal without fail, which was simply incredible.

Once he accepted this pill, it would be equivalent to accepting Heavenly Court’s favor. Moreover, this favor was too heavy, he would definitely not bear it.

From the looks of it, the two pills had been eaten by the Young Emperor. It was the best way to deal with it.

Uncle Yu wanted to say more, but the Young Emperor spoke up, “Alright, Uncle Yu, don’t be so conflicted. At most, you can just send another one over. The most important thing now is to return to the Heavenly Court as soon as possible.”

Upon hearing this, Uncle Yu could not help but smile and cry, “You brat, am I really that unwelcome here?”

After some more conversation, Uncle Yu left.

Only Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor were left in the huge Heavenly Palace.

“He’s finally gone.” The Young Emperor heaved a sigh of relief and raised his eyebrows.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang didn’t understand.

What the Young Emperor did next made him widen his eyes.

He reached out and wiped his mouth. Two pills that contained supreme fate energy fell into his palm again.

“You… didn’t you eat them?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in shock.

The Young Emperor smirked triumphantly, “Of course not. You should know my condition. These pills are useless for me. I could eat a thousand of them, and they wouldn’t have any effect.”

“So, I pretended to eat it and hid it in my mouth.”

With that, he handed the two pills directly to Jian Wushuang.

“Instead of letting them go to waste, I’d rather give them to you.”

Looking at the two pills in his hands, Jian Wushuang still resolutely gave them away.

Looking at the two pills brimming with fate energy in his hand, Jian Wushuang still insisted, “If you don’t take them, then you might as well throw these pills away. They are just useless junk to me.”

“But…” Jian Wushuang swallowed the words that were about to come out of his mouth and let out a sigh.
