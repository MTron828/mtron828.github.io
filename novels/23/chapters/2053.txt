2054 The Suspec

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked at Abysmal Saint Master strangely.

He had shared resentment with Abysmal Saint Master before. Abysmal Saint Master had looked for an opportunity to kill him back then.

However, after a trip to Three-Emperors World, their resentment had naturally been resolved. Now, both parties held no grudges. They could even be considered great friends.

Jian Wushuang understood Abysmal Saint Master. Although he was jealous, he wasn’t one that acted hastily.

Abysmal Saint Master paused and continued, “I wanted to kill you, Sword Emperor. However, my intention was frank. All the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance knew that I didn’t want to see you grow and be above me. I wasn’t hiding anything.”

“However, Zi Xu was different!”

“Before the danger of Eternal Chaotic World was revealed, before I really took action against you, Zi Xu once revealed his intention to kill you when he was talking to me. In our conversation, now that I think back, there was a tinge of incitement in his speech.”

“Incitement?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Great Emperor Xi Zu wanted to kill him and he’d incited Abysmal Saint Master to come after him?

However, Great Emperor Zi Xu behaved rather gently and humbly when he’d met Jian Wushuang. He didn’t reveal anything different.

Besides Abysmal Saint Master, the other Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance couldn’t have known that Great Emperor Zi Xu had wanted to kill him.

“From what I know, Zi Xu is laid back and gentle. He never questions the affairs in Sanctuary Alliance. He almost never takes the initiative to offend anyone but he killed Real God Wu Bei in secret and wanted to kill you, Jian Wushuang. Forget about the fact that both Real God Wu Bei and you were only Real Gods and had never once offended him. On top of that, both of you are inverse cultivators. Now, that’s interesting,” Emperor Bai muttered and his voice was cold.

“Of course, with that alone, we can’t be certain that Zi Xu is a spy. It is most likely he isn’t as broad-minded as we thought he was,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“That’s true,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “However, I have another reason that led me to suspect him. Abysmal Saint Master, do you remember Great Emperor Colored Glaze invited you and Great Emperor Zi Xu to join forces to come to Green Fire World?”

“Of course I do. I thought we were going to win for sure. We never thought that you would be so powerful and that you would have another mysterious expert who assisted you too,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“The mysterious expert is Lord Spirit Sound. We go way back,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Back then, Lord Spirit Sound suppressed Great Emperor Zi Xu. However, after the battle ended, she told me that Great Emperor Zi Xu… had intentionally held his power back.”

“What?” Abysmal Saint Master looked in shock.

“Zi Xu has been hiding his power?” Emperor Bai creased his eyebrows too.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes contained a chilly gleam.

After Lord Spirit Sound fought with Great Emperor Zi Xu, she had told him to be careful of Great Emperor Zi Xu because she could tell that Great Emperor Zi Xu wasn’t as simple as he looked. One should know that the power that Great Emperor Zi Xu had put on display had already gotten him the fifth place on Eternal Chaotic World’s Heaven and Earth Supreme Ranking List.

He was already so powerful when he held back his power. Just how strong would he be if he were to put his full power on display?

“It seems that Great Emperor Zi Xu was really not as simple as we imagined him to be,” Emperor Bai said in a low voice. Although he always saw Great Emperor Zi Xu, he had never fought with him. Hence, he couldn’t tell if he was hiding his power.

However, Lord Spirit Sound was an expert from ancient times and she was powerful. Plus, she had fought with Great Emperor Zi Xu head-on. She definitely wouldn’t come to that conclusion out of nowhere. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“With the two reasons and what Abysmal Saint Master said earlier, I believe that Great Emperor Zi Xu is the biggest suspect,” Jian Wushuang said.

Of course, he had only said suspect. He couldn’t be sure.

After all, he didn’t have any evidence.

“As long as we have a suspect, we can slowly investigate. When we return to Sanctuary Alliance, I will investigate it personally,” Emperor Bai said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang and the other two Great Emperors nodded heavily.

“Oh yeah, one more thing…” Jian Wushuang spoke again, “Many years back, when I was still in the sixth step of inverse cultivation, I once went to Emperor Sword Sect when Lineage of Star was in a dangerous situation because of the news about Star Palace Master’s passing. When I was on my way back, I came across a mysterious expert who tried to assassinate me!”

“The mysterious expert was extremely strong. I believe he wasn’t much weaker than Underworld God, who was in the first place among Emperor Gods. Plus, he had a move that exploded the fighting power of a Great Emperor. Back then, it was a great threat to me. Even now, I don’t know who the mysterious expert was, nor do I know who sent him.”

“However, one thing I am sure about is that he absolutely wasn’t an expert from Acheron Palace, because Acheron Palace once attempted to assassinate me and I knew their methods. If they wanted to assassinate me, they absolutely wouldn’t only send him alone. They would plan meticulously.”

Emperor Bai heard and nodded faintly.

“The expert who tried to assassinate you, I will investigate him personally as well. Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace have been in the dark in Eternal Chaotic World for so many years. They finally took action and they are definitely well prepared. Over the years, they shouldn’t have only placed one or two of their men in Sanctuary Alliance. As the dark millstone stopped, we of Sanctuary Alliance don’t have to be in a hurry to fight them!”

“During this time as we prepare for war, let’s find out everything,” Emperor Bai’s eyes were gleaming. He was obviously angry.

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao saw and nodded faintly.

Sanctuary Alliance and Eternal Chaotic World had been at peace for too long.

In peace, there was definitely hidden decay. There were spies that the enemy had placed and it was time to root them out.

As the four of them chatted, they returned to the buildings in the surrounding dark.

Not long after the four of them returned, the Great Emperors that Emperor Bai commanded to get Jian Wushuang from Bronze Heart Region returned too.

These Great Emperors had gone and taken a trip to Bronze Heart Region. However, they didn’t see Jian Wushuang but had met some experts from Three-Emperors World. Both parties had fought but it led to neither victory nor defeat. Emperor Bai had sent them a message and they’d left in time.

On their way back, these Great Emperors were still confused as they had yet to find out the cause and effect.

However, there was one person who understood.

The person was naturally Great Emperor Zi Xu!

He looked rather at ease but he was in distress.

“It seems that Emperor Bai has already realized that there is a spy among the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance, but I wonder if he will suspect me.”
