Chapter 512: Heaven Wing City

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

That night, the bright moonlight spread like water, slightly illuminating the ground.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on the ground with his bare upper body. He slightly closed his eyes and felt the strange energy flowing through his body. His dark and strong muscles were also slowly wriggling.

Suddenly, a burst of sound emanated from his body as his skin immediately became covered with sweat and a wild aura suddenly radiated from him.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes.

“Bone Fusion Technique, the sixth level, I’ve succeeded!”

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with surprise and joy.

He had easily succeeded in cultivating the Fourth Level of the Bone Fusion Technique, and his cultivation for the Fifth and Sixth Level was not difficult either.

His physical strength soared every time he cultivated a new level.

After cultivating the Sixth Level, his physical strength had been enhanced to a new level once again.

“My current physical strength has at least doubled compared to when I battled with Qing Huo,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

It was already very amazing.

He had been able to fight a Seven-cloud Realm expert by virtue of his physical strength. Since he had improved his physical strength two more levels now, his power would be even more incredible.

“This is only the Sixth Level. What if I cultivated all 12 Levels of the Bone Fusion Technique...” Jian Wushuang wondered.

He was full of curiosity towards the creator of the Bone Fusion Technique.

How amazing was this expert who created such an amazing Body Reshaping Technique!

“No matter who he was, he was definitely a supreme expert,”?he thought.

The higher levels of the technique were only available to those who joined the Monster-exterminating League.

Therefore, whether the Holy Place existed or not, Jian Wushuang still had to become a Divine General in the League so he would have access to the higher levels of the Bone Fusion Technique.

“A month,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

A month was not a short amount of time for him. He would not waste it.

He stayed in the Wu Yan Tribe to meditate quietly on the Slaughter Occult from the Restriction in the Six-story Pagoda. Meanwhile, he used the World Scroll to meditate on the World Origin.

His Original Body and doppelganger were working on comprehending the two different Origins simultaneously, yet independently. In this way, he would yield twice the results.

The Aura-concealing Technique, “Aura Restraint,” was indeed delicate. It took him several days to comprehend it and learn to completely restrain his Saint Realm aura.

Now that he had concealed his aura, other experts could not see through his strength, unless they were supreme experts, like the Three Ancestors, who were far beyond him.

However, those kind of experts were too rare.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

He had improved his comprehension of the Slaughter Origin during this period, but he was still a step away from condensing the eighth Origin Mark. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

On the other side, he had made great progress in comprehending the World Origin and had condensed the sixth Origin Mark.

He was quite satisfied with his performance. The only thing that he was unsatisfied with was his level of cultivation.

Even though he had been at the Saint Realm (Venerable Master) for a long time, he still could not feel any signs of a breakthrough. It might be a long time before he entered the Cloud Realm.

In the early morning, a large number of clansmen gathered on the Drill Ground of the Wu Yan Tribe.

They came to see Qing Huo and Jian Wushuang off.

“Father...” Qing Hu stood next to Qing Huo, reluctant to see him leave.

“Big Brother Wushuang, kill a lot of Demonic Beasts,” Wu Yu said to Jian Wushuang.

“Uncle Qing Huo, remember to kill even more Demonic Beasts! It would be best if you could kill all those damn Demonic Beasts.”

“Brother Wushuang, take care of yourself and Uncle Qing Huo.”

While being accompanied by the clansmen, Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo arrived at the entrance gate of the tribe. He was touched by their warmth and enthusiasm.

“Wushuang, let’s go,” Qing Huo said.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded, then they left the tribe.

Several days later, they arrived before a giant city.

“A city?”Jian Wushuang looked at it.

On the journey, he had passed by large and small tribes, but he had yet to see any cities on the Monster Continent.

This city was much larger than any city he knew of in the Divine Land.

“This is Heaven Wing City, one of the Eight Cities of the human population on Monster Continent.”

Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang and explained, “The human population has eight cities like this one. The tribes come here to exchange goods, and each city has a Saint Castle. If you want to be a Divine General, you must go there for the assessment.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang slightly nodded.

“The Monster-exterminating League has set a rule. Flying is forbidden in the Holy Place and the Eight Cities, as is fighting. We have to queue up to enter the city,” Qing Huo said. They went to the front gate where a large number of Human Warriors from various tribes were queued up.

Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo also stood in the long queue.

“Flying is forbidden as well as fighting?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“No one dares to violate the rules set by the League. Of course, if you have the opportunity to become a Divine Emperor in the future, you don’t have to follow these rules. Experts, like Divine Emperors, have certain privileges,” said Qing Huo.

“Divine Emperor?”Jian Wushuang was intrigued by these words.

He had heard about the Divine Emperors from Qing Huo before.

In the Monster-exterminating League, where all high-level human warriors of the Monster Continent gathered, Divine Generals were the most common and were generally Seven-cloud Realm experts.

There were numerous Seven-cloud Realm experts on the Monster Continent. Therefore, there were countless Divine Generals in the Monster-exterminating League.

Above the Divine Generals were Divine Emperors!

According to Qing Huo’s description, Divine Emperors had entered the Dao. If they were in the Divine Land, they would be as strong as the Nine Sovereigns, or maybe even stronger.

However, there were 108 Divine Emperors in the Monster-exterminating League. In addition, there were many other experts who were qualified to be Divine Emperors in the League.

Compared with the Monster-exterminating League, the Divine Land, where Jian Wushuang had just come from, was indeed much weaker.
