Chapter 968: Chaos Gold Bead

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The Blood-killing Plate Armor can greatly improve your strength, but the other three treasures are also quite good. You can take a closer look at them.” Gu King’s voice rang out.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the other three useful treasures.

One of the remaining three treasures was an ancient flying black boat. It had been shrunk and was held in the Interspatial Ring. Jian Wushuang could feel the flying boat’s aura and its formation.

“Is this a flying boat?” Jian Wushuang was in doubt.

“That is the Spaceship.”

Gu King said, “The Eternal Chaotic World is huge. The distance between worlds is far beyond your imagination. Under normal circumstances, a Dao Master needs to spend tens of thousands of years to reach the nearest neighboring world. To save time, they invent all kinds of transportation treasures.

“The most common of these is the Spaceship.

“When you become a Dao Master in the future, you will definitely go to the Eternal Chaotic World. If you only rely on your feet, it will be too much trouble. The Spaceship in front of you can save you a lot of traveling time by accelerating your speed by 1,000 times. And although it’s not a high-end Spaceship, it’s expensive.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded and appeared shocked.

A Dao Master was already fast and could travel 10,000 miles in an instant. This Spaceship actually could increase that speed by 1,000 times!

However, it could only be used outside of a realm. If it was within a realm—for example, in the Green Fire World, where laws were different—it could not be activated.

“I don’t need the Spaceship now, but when I enter the Eternal Chaotic World, it will be of great use to me,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Then, Jian Wushuang looked at the third treasure.

The third treasure was two golden beads the size of a baby’s fist. The golden beads emitted a strange aura, which even Jian Wushuang found amazing.

“Gu King, what are these?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Those are Chaos Gold Beads. The Blood Killing Sect invented this special treasure and then it became widely acclaimed in the Eternal Chaotic World,” Gu King continued.

“The Blood Killing Sect invented it? Is it an evil treasure?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“This treasure itself is not evil. On the contrary, it has a great effect on all cultivators. Almost all the experts in the Eternal Chaotic World want the Chaos Gold Beads. The treasure is not evil; however, its refining process is quite evil.” Gu King sounded grave.

“Why do you say that?” Jian Wushuang asked in doubt.

“A Chaos Gold Bead is made of hundreds of millions of lives,” Gu King said.

“Hundreds of millions of lives? Isn’t that the same as the Life Devouring Formation’s process?” Jian Wuhsuang widened his eyes.

“No, it isn’t.” Gu King shook his head and continued, “The Life Devouring Formation reduces lives to nothing, while the Chaos Gold Bead consumes only the small purest part of one’s life. Therefore, the lives that have been refined can survive. And after some time, they can completely recover from it.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang said while cocking one eyebrow.

“Although it was invented by the Blood Killing Sect, the Chaos Gold Bead is common in the Eternal Chaotic World. Later on, many experts and forces secretly refined Chaos Gold Beads. Some even especially raised a few Eternal World creatures to refine the Chaos Gold Beads,” Gu King said.

“Raised a few Eternal World creatures?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “How did they do that?”

Gu King replied, “I just said that the refining of the Chaos Gold Bead only needs a part of the vitality, and that vitality can still be recovered. Some forces occupy a realm to raise creatures. Every once in a while, they extract part of the creatures’ vitality to refine the Chaos Gold Bead. Then, when the creatures recover, they extract their vitality again. Such is their practice…”

“They actually raise creatures to use their vitality. How cruel!” Jian Wushuang commented.

“In the vast Eternal Chaotic World, anything goes. There are countless things that are a hundred times crueler and eviler. What can you say about raising a world of creatures?”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and soon collected himself.

“Gu King, what is the effect of the Chaos Gold Bead?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Chaos Gold Bead absorbs the purest part of life. And after special refining, it will be free from impurities. That is to say, you can consume the energy in the Chaos Gold Bead directly. The energy will be all yours, which is much easier than cultivating and accumulating by yourself.

“Take you as an example, you have just become a Three-star Ancient God and have the power of a Three-star Ancient God. If you want to cultivate and accumulate the Ancient God Power to reach the top of the Three-star level, it’ll take you a long time. However, if you have the Chaos Gold Bead, it will be different!

“The Chaos Gold Bead contains a huge amount of energy. As long as you continue to absorb it, you can swiftly improve your Ancient God Power. Dao Yuanzi has left two low-grade Chaos Gold Beads. At your speed, within a thousand years, you should be able to absorb one of them. And after consuming the other one, you will be able to reach the peak of the Three-star level, and even break through to the Four-star level.

“If you swallow both of them at the same time, you may increase your Ancient God Power to the Four-star level, or maybe above the Four-star level.

“Moreover, the energy in the Chaos Gold Bead is pure; there are no impurities. You don’t have to worry about any side effects. The energy will build you up and help you grow in the future,” said Gu King.

“Is it that remarkable?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

No wonder the experts and forces in the Eternal Chaotic World occupied realms to raise creatures to refine Chaos Gold Beads.

The Chaos Gold Bead was indeed effective.

Jian Wushuang found himself tempted by the bead, even though the refining of the Chaos Gold Bead was evil and even vicious, which Jian Wushuang resented a lot.

But since it was already made, the refining process had nothing with do with him.

Jian Wushuang would not hesitate to absorb the two Chaos Gold Beads.
