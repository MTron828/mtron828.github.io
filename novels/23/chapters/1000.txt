Chapter 1001: The Outcome

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“So, Mr Jin Yu. I’ve shown you the two Chaos Gems I have prepared for you. Will you help me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Jin Yu looked at Jian Wushuang; now renewed with a faint glimmer of respect for the latter’s ability to afford two Chaos Gems.

The mere ability to be able to afford two Chaos Gems alone proved that Jian Wushuang was hardly ordinary.

“I will help you, out of respect for the Dragon Wing Governor; and your promise of the two Chaos Gems,” said Jin Yu.

“My thanks to you, Mr Jin Yu.” Jian Wushuang said happily. “The person I wish to locate is called Jian Nantian. He is a Reincarnator from the Ancient World who came here 2,000 years ago.”

“Jian Nantian?” Jin Yu nodded. “I will do my best. Give me three days and you will have your answer. You may stay here if you will, as you await my answer.”

“That is fine with me.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Let us stay here for three days then. I am hardly busy for now,” said the Dragon Wing Governor with a laugh.

“Please see to their accommodations, Ye.” Jin Yu commanded lazily with a wave of his hand.

“As you wish.” The grey-robed elder named Ye responded and immediately led them to their rooms.

As Jian Wushuang and the Dragon Wing Governor left, Jin Yu stood motionless at the mezzanine with his feet still bare. A sly smile crept over his face.

“What luck! To think that I can earn two Chaos Gems through so simple a task!” Jin Yu murmured gleefully.

He had lied to Jian Wushuang, telling him that divulgement of news about Reincarnators would result in terrible comeuppance if caught in the act.

In truth, the news of Reincarnators was not as closely guarded as rumored to be. In fact, the upper echelons of the Temple guarded such secrets with merely a lackadaisical zeal.

Thus, the leak of information about a single Reincarnator would neither alarm the Samsara Temple, and nor would Jin Yu need to suffer any punishment.

“Apart from two Chaos Gems, there is still the Dragon Wing Governor…” Jin Yuyin broke into a hushed sinister glee. He conjured a token in his palm and delivered a message.

“Master Di Yan. I have two people currently taking up lodgings with me. I wager one of them might interest you.”

…

For the next three days, Jian Wushuang and the Dragon Wing Governor stayed temporarily in the castle.

Anxious that he would finally secure news of his father’s whereabouts, Jian Wushuang seethed with excitement. He grew so nervous that he could hardly calm down and focus on his training.

Three days passed quickly.

Jian Wushuang and the Dragon Wing Governor were led back into the grand hall where they once again met Jin Yu.

“Jian Wushuang. There has been an outcome on the errand you have bidden me of.” Jin Yu said, looking down at them.

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly with hope as he looked at Jin Yu.

“I’ve searched for the name of the person you gave me. But no such man exists among all Reincarnators of the Temple below Rank Seven,” said Jin Yu.

“No such man exists?” Jian Wushuang’s face turned. “How could it be possible?”

“Are you certain that you have examined the names of all the Reincarnators, Mr Jin Yu?” Jian Wushuang asked anxiously.

“Hmph!” Jin Yu scoffed indignantly. “Are you questioning my honor, Jian Wushuang?”

The domineering demeanor of their host left Jian Wushuang speechless.

Standing beside him, the Dragon Wing Governor turned to him and spoke in a low voice, “Be at ease, Jian Wushuang. Jin Yu is a Golden-clothed Deacon of the Samsara Temple and a warrior of great standing across the Samsara Continent. With your promise of reward, I am sure he will do his utmost to see that your bidding is done. His honor is worth this much at least.”

“I apologize for the impertinence.” Jian Wushuang muttered, aware that he had overreacted.

“Mr Jin Yu. With my companion’s promise of so great a reward as two Chaos Gems, I am sure we can agree that he is absolutely certain that his kin must be one of the Reincarnators of the Temple. Is it possible for other reasons for not being able to find him?” The Dragon Wing Governor asked.

From his perch, Jin Yu glowered down once more as he answered, “I’ve ascertained that there is no such man among all Reincarnators below Rank Seven. There are only two possibilities that can explain this regrettable outcome.”

“First, the person may have become a Rank Seven Reincarnator, like me. Information about him will be kept from me since we are of the same rank.” Jin Yu said.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, into one of renewed optimism and promise.

“Yes, yes!”

“That’s very likely to be the case.”?Jian Wushuang clenched his hands excitedly as flurries of thoughts, delighted yet on the brink of delirium, flowed through his mind.?“My father is a man of great talents. It is possible that he might have become a Rank Seven Reincarnator. It should be normal that Jin Yu cannot find him.”

“And what of the other possibility, Mr Jin Yu?” The Dragon Wing Governor inquired again.

“The one other possibility being that he is dead.”

Indifferent to the weight of his grim message, Jin Yu continued, “It is but unfortunate tidings that Reincarnators rarely survive the tests of the Samsara Temple. Reincarnators are required to traverse and navigate their way through the countless trials and tribulations of certain death. It is even likely that not even one from the mass of ten thousand Reincarnators could survive the grueling and deadly trials. Records of Reincarnators who have died are completely erased. Hence, the inability to locate his name.”

“Jian Wushuang. Your kin, he hails from the Ancient World, you say? He was chosen to be a Reincarnator 2,000 years ago?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head blankly. “It is not yet 2,000 years since he became a Reincarnator.”

“Hahaha…” In spite of that, Jin Yu broke into a giggle. “Then he can only be a Rank One Reincarnator since he was drafted from the Ancient World. It is impossible for a Rank One Reincarnator to reach Rank Seven in less than 2,000 years. Not with the onerous difficulty of the tests of the Temple.”

“That would mean that your kin, is more likely than not, dead!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Dead?” Jian Wushuang was astounded by shock before he began shaking his head violently in denial. “Impossible! That’s impossible!”

His face darkened with despair.

He was certain of his father’s ability. The difficulties of the tests of the Samsara Temple might be able to defeat most common warriors, but never his father!

“Be that as it may, I have completed the task as you have bidden me to. I have reported to you the outcome of my errand. You may choose to believe it and you may not. But that is no longer any concern of mine. Now hand me the rest of the Chaos Gems you have promised me.” Jin Yu’s boomed as he extended his hand.

Jian Wushuang grimaced with anguish and denial. Biting hard, he handed the Chaos Gems to Jin Yu even though the outcome was too hard for him to swallow.

Jin Yu beamed widely as at the sight of the Chaos Gems. He then looked once more at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang. There is a favor that I might be able to do for you. I can see that you do not approve of the outcome of my finding.” Jin Yu said.

“Ah?” Jian Wushuang looked up at Jin Yu incredulously.

“I am but merely a Rank Seven Reincarnator. I am only allowed access to information on Reincarnators below Rank Seven. However, I am familiar with a certain Rank Eight Reincarnator who might be able to help you, for he is able to examine the information of all Reincarnators below Rank Eight. I would not mind enlisting his help if you are agreeable to a reasonable reward.”
