Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang arrived at Fang Han’s camp.

“Please report to the commander that the leader of the tenth 100-soldier squad, Jian Wushuang, wants to see him,” Jian Wushuang spoke to a guard outside the camp.

“Wait a minute,” The guard answered and left to convey the message.

Soon, the guard returned from the camp and said, “Commander said he is busy now. He needs you to wait here.”

Jian Wushuang squinted in consternation but he was patient and decided to wait. However, Fang Han had still not shown up after an hour.

“It’s already been an hour.”

Jian Wushuang raised his head. He had a steely look in his eyes. “Fang Han, I’ve shown you respect, but you don’t care. In this case, don’t blame me later.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and suddenly stepped out.

“Fang Han commander!”

Jian Wushuang spoke with his great Spiritual Power. His words exploded over the camp like a thunderclap.

It caused a great disruption in the campsite of the First Army, where all the sergeants raised their heads in shock.

They were confused as to who was shouting so loudly at Fang Han commander.

Inside the camp, Fang Han, a plump middle-aged man, was drinking wine. He didn’t look as busy as he had claimed.

“Hum, Jian Wushuang, since you upset Jin Ling, you can’t expect to have a nice time here,”?Fang Han smiled coldly. He did plan to meet Jian Wushuang after a while, but...

“Fang Han commander!”

A cold yell reverberated through the camp. It felt like thunder with a Sound Wave Attack.

Thwack!

The flagon in Fang Han’s hand shattered and its contents splashed on the floor.

Fang Han’s face clouded over.

“Damn!” with a great yell, Fang Han stood up and walked outside.

Jian Wushuang stood outside the camp, longsword in hand and face devoid of expression. Sergeants from the First Army surrounded him, all staring at him in shock.

“Jian Wushuang!”

A furious yell issued from the camp. Soon, Fang Han showed up. His eyes were filled with rage as he looked at Jian Wushuang and said in a cold voice, “Jian Wushuang, I told you that I’m busy and asked you to wait for me here. How dare you shout at me. Your wild behavior is not allowed here.”

“Wild?” Jian Wushuang frowned, then laughed and said, “Fang Han commander, I think you need to understand the situation now.”

“I’m not here to meet you today. I’m here to demand an explanation.”

“Explanation?” all the sergeants were stunned.

A leader of a 100-soldier squad had come to demand an explanation from a commander. He is going to...

“Jian Wushuang, what do you want?” Fang Han’s expression was glacial.

“There is a rule in the East Camp that all 100-soldier squads take turns every month to guard the rear of the East Camp. But when I got here, you immediately asked me to go to the Sky Solitude Mountains. My squad has been there for two months but no squad has relieved us, and there hasn’t even been a messenger to explain why!”

“Fang Han commander, don’t you need to give me an explanation?” Jian Wushuang looked at Fang Han coldly and yelled, “Three breaths, within three breaths you have to give me a good explanation, otherwise don’t complain that I am not nice to you.”

Having heard Jian Wushuang’s words, the sergeants understood the situation.

Finally, they knew Jian Wushuang’s purpose in meeting Fang Han.

“Jian Wushuang, didn’t I already send a messenger to tell you that the First Army has been fighting with the Demonic Beasts? We are suffering from a lack of manpower, so I need you guys to keep guard there. Is there a problem?” Fang Han answered in a low voice.

“Manpower shortages?” Jian Wushuang laughed and said, “It is not a bad excuse to fool little kids, but not me.”

“Two breaths have passed, you still have one more.” Jian Wushuang stared at Fang Han. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hum, I am the commander of the First Army. Even if I don’t have a reason, I can still order you to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains, and you have to do it. You have to obey me.” Fang Han snorted.

Without responding, Jian Wushuang raised his head. His eyes were filled with fury.?“Three breaths already.”

A powerful aura suddenly erupted from Jian Wushuang’s body and then immediately swept away.

The sergeants near him could sense this aura and were stunned.

They didn’t know what Jian Wushuang’s plan was.

But this soon became clear with Jian Wushuang’s next actions.

He transformed, leaving behind a residual shadow. At the same time, the powerful aura became a huge hurricane and barrelled towards Fang Han.

“Action!”

“He, he took actions?”

“A leader of a 100-soldier squad attacked a commander?”

“How dare he!”

“He is crazy!”

The sergeants around were flabbergasted by the sight.

Even Fang Han was taken aback but soon, he gave an angry laugh.

“How dare you.” Fang Han snorted. He did not show any trace of fear.

The commanders of the First Army in the East Camp were all top Second-grade Divine Generals or Eight-cloud Realm Peaks, with strength acknowledged by all.

Among the human group in the Monster Continent, only the Divine Emperors and a few advanced Second-grade Divine General who were in defiance of the natural order were able to defeat him, but Jian Wushuang...

Deep down, Fang Han looked down on him.

He was aware that Jian Wushuang had just become a Divine General. It was also his first time joining the military camp.

That meant he hadn’t had any chances to fight Demonic Beasts previously.

“Hum, a young man who has never met a Demonic Beast dares to attack me. You are killing yourself.”

Fang Han’s face clouded over as a Giant Axe appeared in his hand.

Om ~ ~ ~?The Void in front of Fang Han split, exposing Jian Wushuang’s figure.

Jian Wushuang held a Triple-kill Sword and was filled with Killing Intent. Silence fell around him.

“The commander of the East Camp usually has the top Second-grade Divine General’s battle strength. If I want to challenge him, I have to use some skills,”?Jian Wushuang squinted and stared at Fang Han.

He made up his mind.

Once he started the action, he would not hold back. He would definitely defeat the opponent and wouldn’t give him a chance to fight back.

Less than 10 meters away from Fang Han, Jian Wushuang finally struck.
