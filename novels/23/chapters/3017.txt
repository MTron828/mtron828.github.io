Chapter 3018: Gold King

——

“Your Highness Gold King, let’s do it!”

As soon as Lord Wu finished speaking, Gold King, the middle-aged man with short golden hair, took a step forward.

Gold King looked at Jian Wushuang with his sharp eyes like a fierce beast. “First rank True Saint?”

“Third rank True Saint?” Jian Wushuang also looked at Gold King. “And he seems to be very powerful among the third rank True Saints.”

“I don’t have any grudges with you, but since you’ve angered the king, then you deserve to die!” Gold King said emotionlessly. As soon as he finished speaking, Gold King moved.

A golden stream of light flashed across the void and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. At the same time, a golden spear appeared in Gold King’s hand.

He held the golden spear in one hand and rotated it. Immediately, a golden airwave swept out. The golden spear was like a golden flood dragon in his hand.

The spear pierced through the air, producing a piercing sound.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“After I became an Immortal Saint, the strength of my divine power has increased too much. I don’t know how much it has reached, but I still feel that I’m stronger than a rank three True Saint. Now that I have the chance to fight with a real rank three True Saint, I’ll give it a try.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed, he only used 50% of his divine power.

However, even if it was only 50% of his strength, it was still very powerful.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang waved his right hand, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand slashed down like a bolt of blood-red lightning.

Clang!

The blood-red lightning instantly collided with the golden flood dragon.

As soon as they came into contact, Jian Wushuang immediately felt a strange spiral force coming from the Gold King’s spear, accompanied by an astonishing explosive force.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang retreated backward in a sorry state. After a long while, he stopped again.

“Humph, I heard that you killed both Tian Mound King and Stone Saint in one move, and your battle strength was close to that of a rank three True Saint. But now, it seems that you are just so-so.” Gold King snorted.

“Haha, I was too arrogant.” Jian Wushuang laughed self-deprecatingly.

He had only used 50% of his divine power, but now it seemed that 50% was not enough.

“Let’s try again.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but he rushed forward and raised the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Whoosh!

It was still the same brutal blood-red lightning.

However, this time, Jian Wushuang used 70% of his divine power.

It seemed that 70% and 50% were only 20% more, but 20% was enough to raise Jian Wushuang’s strength to a whole new level.

Gold King struck again.

“Buzz!”

A dazzling golden light lit up.

The golden light was invincible and collided with the blood-red lightning again.

However, this time, the golden light dimmed and even Gold King’s body trembled slightly.

“What?” Gold King was a little surprised. In the next moment, he and Jian Wushuang both retreated.

This time, they were evenly matched.

“His divine power has increased, and it has improved a lot. He is not inferior to me at all?” Gold King stood firm and looked at Jian Wushuang again with a serious expression.

He was also very shocked.

After all, Jian Wushuang was only a rank one True Saint, and it seemed that he had just made a breakthrough.

But in terms of divine power, he was on par with him?

After all, he was a True Saint expert who was infinitely close to the peak of rank three!

“Your name is Gold King, right? How is my power? Do you want to try again?” Jian Wushuang looked at Gold King with interest.

“Although I don’t know how a rank one True Saint like you can have such powerful divine power, a person’s strength is not determined solely by the power of divine power.” Gold King sneered. Suddenly…whoosh!

A strange golden light flashed and disappeared.

Gold King’s figure disappeared completely. In its place, the golden light moved through the void at a terrifying speed.

“Speed?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned, but then he burst into laughter. “Do you think I’m afraid of you when it comes to speed?”

Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all. He turned into a streak of silver light and burst out in an instant.

His comprehension of the space-time rule had completely burst out. At the same time, he also used the silver light movement technique to its fullest.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Silver light flashed crazily in the void, which was obviously faster than the golden light formed by Gold King.

Both of them reached their maximum speed, and in the blink of an eye, they fought again in the void.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sound of metal colliding rang out continuously. In less than a breath’s time, the sound of metal colliding rang out nearly a hundred times. In just a breath’s time, the two had exchanged close to a hundred head-on blows.

Fast!

Both of them were too fast.

It was so fast that many of the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom who were watching the battle were confused, because they could not catch the figure of Jian Wushuang and Gold King.

Finally…

Chi!

With a slight sound, the golden light shot out and went back into Gold King.

However, Gold King was clearly in a sorry state at the moment. There was a white mark on the shoulder of the divine armor on his body.

The white mark was left by Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword.

However, it was just a scratch, not a direct attack. Otherwise, it would not be as simple as leaving a white mark.

However, the appearance of the white mark meant that Gold King was at a disadvantage in the fight just now.

“Haha, Gold King, you have comprehended the principles of gold. How stupid you are to compete with me, who has comprehended the principles of space-time.” Jian Wushuang sneered.

In terms of speed, he was indeed superior to the Gold King. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In fact, in terms of comprehending the principles of space-time, he had reached the limit of the second stage.

Gold King’s comprehension of the principles of gold was also the limit of the second stage.

However, the principles of gold were strong. It was good at strength and power, while the principles of space-time were best at speed.

Jian Wushuang, who had comprehended the principles of space-time, was naturally faster than Gold King, who had comprehended the principles of gold. Moreover, Jian Wushuang had the help of movement skills.

Gold King was furious that he had suffered a small loss in front of so many people.

“How fast is my speed? I have been a rank-three True Saint for many years. I don’t believe that I can’t compete with you, a True Saint who has just broken through, in terms of the skills I have created,” Gold King said in a low voice. The next moment, he attacked again.
