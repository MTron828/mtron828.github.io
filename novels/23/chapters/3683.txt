Demon Realm.

Corpses littered the ground on the huge battlefield. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The decisive battle between the Nine-tailed Clan and the other three Divine Clans had already reached the final stage.

“The tide has already passed. Three clan leaders, do you still want to continue fighting to the death?”

Xiao’er’s expression was ice-cold as she stood there arrogantly. Her clear and cold eyes swept over the three clan leaders in front of her.

Beside Xiao’er, the sand sea devil master stood there respectfully. He was clearly a supreme expert who had reached the peak of the sixth level, but beside Xiao’er, he was like a slave.

And on the surrounding battlefield, the situation was completely one-sided.

The three great Divine Clan’s camp had already shown signs of being defeated. Even if they continued to fight, they would only be fighting like cornered beasts. They would still be unable to change the outcome.

This scene made the three clan leaders’ faces extremely ugly.

“Three clan leaders, I’ll give you a chance. Surrender or die!” Xiao’er shouted sternly.

The three clan leaders looked at each other in dismay.

Although they were unwilling to accept it, they had no choice in the face of the absolute difference in strength.

“Surrender,” the current clan leader of the Blood Clan said first.

The Blood Clan had suffered a great loss when Jian Wushuang led Demon Master Chenhuo and eccentric Ming Huo to kill the clan leader of the Blood Clan. They had not fully recovered until now, the Blood Clan was the weakest among the three Divine Clans. Even the current clan leader was lucky enough to become the clan leader.

Now, in the face of absolute strength, he did not have any room to struggle. He was willing to submit.

As for the other two tribe leaders, they also secretly sighed and immediately chose to submit.

From then on, the Nine-tailed Clan was the leader of the four great celestial races in the Demon Realm. The other three great celestial races completely submitted to the feet of the Nine-tailed Clan.

A moment later, the curtain of this great battle had completely fallen.

However, at this moment, Xiao’er immediately ordered, “Everyone, recover your divine power as quickly as possible. In an hour, follow me!”

This order caused everyone to be extremely shocked.

“Nine-tailed Clan leader, in an hour, where do you want us to follow you?” The Gu tribe leader asked.

“The three great divine territories!” Xiao’er’s eyes flashed with a shocking cold light.

…

Heaven-cleaving Star, one of the two great headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!

This Heaven-cleaving Star was originally the location of the Heaven-cleaving Palace, and the top geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance had all gathered here.

However, at this moment, besides the many geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Palace, there were also countless top experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance gathered on this heaven-cleaving star!

Among them, the three palace masters of the Heaven-cleaving Palace and the few commanders in charge of the battle were the leaders.

There were more than a hundred Principles Masters, and the lowest among them was an army of at least a rank six True Saint.

It could be said that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance had gathered all the high-level battle forces that they could mobilize.

“So many people, close to a hundred thousand rank six True Saints and more than a hundred Principles Masters, what are they doing?”

Among the densely packed crowd, many of the Heaven-cleaving Palace’s genius disciples were also mixed in. At this moment, the hearts of these Heaven-cleaving Palace’s genius disciples were extremely shocked.

They were not the only ones. In fact, although many of the Heaven-cleaving Palace’s experts had gathered here, they did not know what exactly they were trying to do. Therefore, when they saw the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s gathered power…a huge wave rose in their hearts.

And at the front of the crowd, the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Palace and the few commanders stood side by side.

“All of the highest combat power that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance can mobilize is gathered here. Only those who have ventured into the cosmic battlefield can not return in a short period of time. Otherwise...” A commander said.

“It’s fine.” Palace Master Raincloud waved his hand. “This time, it’s not just the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. The Temporal divine hall and the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist sect will also take action. It’s said that the four great celestials and the Eight Directions Celestial Sect will also take part in the battle. They only have one target, and that is the three great Saint Realms!”

“The three great Saint Realms will definitely be destroyed in this battle!”

The commanders were all excited.

At this moment, one of the three Palace Masters, Askheaven Demonic God, suddenly opened his eyes.

“The Alliance Master’s orders have arrived!”

The figures of the commanders and the other two palace masters trembled.

“In that case, let’s set off!”

Instantly, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s army of over a hundred Principles Masters and nearly a hundred thousand True Saints and above headed toward the Third Heaven.

At the same time, in the Temporal divine hall and the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect.

The Temporal divine hall had gathered all the top-tier saints and Principles Masters together.

This time, they did not leave any leeway. The spacetime divine hall had gathered more than eighty Principles Masters, and more than a hundred top-tier saints.

Apart from that, the four ancient immortals, who had never been involved in worldly affairs, personally rushed over.

As for the heavenly ancestor Daoist sect, there were countless experts. At this moment, they had gathered an army of more than a hundred law masters and nearly a hundred thousand saints.

The moment the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s army moved out, the experts from the spacetime divine hall and the heavenly ancestor Daoist sect also moved out.

Other than that, the eight directions heavenly sect, which was made up of six great heavenly sects, also moved out.

The Purple Blood Sect, the Supreme Oblivion Valley, and more than ten ancient sects of the Divine Beginning Realm had also moved out.

At this moment, everyone pointed directly at the three Great Saint Realms in the Third Heaven!

…

After the Fourth Heaven was completely desolate, the Third Heaven had become the absolute holy land for cultivation in the Divine Beginning Realm.

And the three great Saint Realms, which were high and mighty, occupied the territory with the best cultivation environment in the Third Heaven.

Normally, the Third Heaven was extremely lively. This was especially so for the territories around the three great Saint Realms. As they were closer to the three great Saint Realms, these territories had also benefited greatly and were extremely prosperous.

However, the territories around the three great Saint Realms appeared exceptionally quiet today.

The reason for this was because there were countless numbers of experts from all directions sweeping over these territories.

Powerful auras swept out wantonly, causing the cultivators in these territories to be like frightened birds.

“There are so many experts, there must be more than 100,000 of them, right? And there are even so many Principles Masters.”

“From the looks of it, they are heading towards the three great Saint Realms!”

“What’s going on? What’s going on? Why are there so many experts heading towards the three great Saint Realms? could something have happened in the three great Saint Realms?”

Many thoughts appeared in the minds of the cultivators in the three great Saint Realms.

Most of the cultivators in the three great Saint Realms did not know what had happened, but they could tell from the army of experts that something big must have happened in the three great Saint Realms!
