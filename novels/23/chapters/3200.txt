Chapter 3201: Admitting Defeat

——

The three secret skills of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect greatly improved his strength. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The divine punishment skill, the Seven Star secret skill, and the nine brilliant star armor!

Previously, Jian Wushuang had only used the divine punishment skill, including the battle with the 13 axes in the Nine Wolf Mountain Range and the fight with Duan Lang.

But now, he had directly used the seven-star secret skill and the nine-dazzling star armor.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Jian Wushuang’s divine power aura rose from the original limit of rank six to rank seven True Saint!

“Has his divine power aura improved?”

“Has he made a breakthrough?”

“Not a breakthrough. He just used a secret skill to improve his realm.”

“It’s extraordinary that it can help a rank six ultimate True Saint reach rank seven True Saint in such a short time.”

The eyes of the surrounding experts lit up with anticipation.

This battle had shocked the Principles Masters twice.

The first time was when Jian Wushuang used the shadowless escape skill.

The second time was when Duan Lang cultivated the Black Devil secret skill to the profound realm and used the Black Devil Realm.

This had changed their judgment of the outcome of the battle.

Now, they were looking forward to being shocked for the third time.

In the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang, who had temporarily reached the level of a rank seven True Saint, was exuding a majestic divine power that was even stronger than Duan Lang’s. It was normal for him to be at the peak of rank six to rank seven True Saint, it seemed that there was only a difference of one level, but there was a difference of several times or even nearly ten times in the power of divine power.

The nine luminaries star armor could also greatly increase the power of Jian Wushuang’s attack.

“Duan Lang, take this!”

Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. He held the Blood Mountain Sword with both hands and raised it high.

The moment he raised it, the Blood Mountain Sword instantly stirred the surrounding space and time, turning the surrounding space and time into the blood.

The blood-red sky, the blood-red earth, and even the air began to fill with blood mist.

Duan Lang stood in front of Jian Wushuang. He even seemed to be able to see the piles of bones under Jian Wushuang’s feet condense into a blood sea. The shocking killing intent soared to the sky, making Duan Lang’s heart skip a beat.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was no longer a human cultivator, but an asura who had transformed into hell!

It was a blood-colored Asura!

The blood-colored Asura raised the sword in its hand and slowly slashed out.

It was a simple slash as if it did not contain any power.

However, the moment the Blood Mountain Sword was slashed out, a shocking blood-colored sword light suddenly attacked.

“This sword…” Duan Lang frowned slightly and a trace of doubt arose in his heart.

He could see that the power of the blood-red sword light that Jian Wushuang displayed was indeed powerful. However, in the light wheel level, this sword light was also only at the level of a rank eight absolute art. Moreover, it was coming toward him so openly, he could totally try to avoid it. Even if he could not avoid it, he was confident that he could easily withstand it.

“This Heavenly Sword Marquis has been accumulating power for so long. Is this the best sword technique he can use?” Duan Lang was still confused.

Suddenly…a wave of space-time power came toward him without any warning.

“What?” Duan Lang was shocked. “This power, this is…”

Before Duan Lang could do anything, the space-time he was in instantly froze.

Time-space freeze!

Although the time-space freeze could not last long for Duan Lang, who also comprehended the space-time principles and had a high level of comprehension and strength.

Jian Wushuang did not need the time-space freeze to last long. He only needed a moment. It was enough in the blink of an eye.

In a battle between experts, especially when their strength was at their level, even such a short and negligible moment was enough to determine the winner.

Duan Lang was caught in the space-time freeze and instantly regained his senses. However, by the time he regained his senses, the blood-colored sword ray had already appeared less than three meters in front of him.

At such a close distance, even Duan Lang did not have the ability to block it. He could not even wave his arm to block the spear in front of his chest. He could only watch as the blood-colored sword ray struck his body.

Bang!

With a low boom, Duan Lang was shot out like a cannonball. On the way, he kept rolling and retreated to the edge of the battlefield before he could stabilize himself, as soon as he stabilized himself, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

His body was still shaking crazily.

After a while, he raised his head again and looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of astonishment.

“That was…the heaven-designated skill!” Duan Lang was in disbelief.

He did not expect that Jian Wushuang could perfectly integrate the first move of the space-time divine skill, the heaven-designated skill, into his swordsmanship.

He was seriously injured when he was not paying attention.

Fortunately, his body-protection ability was strong enough. Even though he was not blocked at all, Jian Wushuang’s sword strike did not completely destroy his divine body on the spot. It was only 70% destroyed!

After all, 70% of his divine body was not completely destroyed and did not need to be reconstructed. Therefore, in theory, he did not lose.

“Sure enough, even if I go all out and use many secret skills to use this Blood Asura, I can only severely injure him. However, it is still not enough to directly destroy his divine body,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile, then, he flipped his palm and put the Blood Mountain Sword back into his interspatial ring.

“This battle…I admit defeat!”

Jian Wushuang’s clear voice echoed throughout the drill ground.

Duan Lang was stunned and immediately frowned.

The experts watching the battle looked at each other with strange looks.

“Admit defeat? Heavenly Sword Marquis actually admitted defeat?” Feixue was very surprised.

“That sword attack just now should be Heavenly Sword Marquis’s strongest sword attack. However, this sword attack only caused Duan Lang’s divine body to be heavily injured. It isn’t enough to completely destroy Duan Lang’s divine body. In other words, Heavenly Sword Marquis isn’t able to directly defeat Duan Lang,” Qian Hongzi said.

“Even if that’s the case, it doesn’t mean that Duan Lang can defeat Heavenly Sword Marquis, right? The strength of the two of them should be on par. If Heavenly Sword Marquis were a little more tenacious, he would definitely be able to win in the end,” Feixue said.

“That’s the case, but…” Qian Hongzi laughed instead, “Feixue, don’t forget that regardless of whether Heavenly Sword Marquis wins or loses, he can still head to the Blood Wave Realm, but Duan Lang can’t.”

Feixue was startled, but he immediately understood as well.
