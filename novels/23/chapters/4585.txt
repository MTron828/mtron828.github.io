4588 Comprehending the Sword

He did not know if it was a dream or an illusion.

Thank you readers!

The Great Dao Comprehension that the Cosmos God had left in Jian Wushuang’s divine consciousness was opened by him.

However, at the moment it was opened, he suddenly woke up.

“You’re awake, little guy.” Shi Ting stood on the Taoist sanctum that was made of divine power and looked at Jian Wushuang with relief.

Jian Wushuang propped himself up with one hand and stood up instantly.

“What is this place?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the huge square that was completely made of vast divine power and he had not reacted yet.

“This is the place you should be comprehending.” Shi Ting laughed.

Jian Wushuang did not lack comprehension. With just a hint, he instantly realized that the Daoist Rite Temple was built by the divine weapons of left by the unparalleled warriors.

“Thank you, Old Sir.” Jian Wushuang cupped his fists and looked at Shi Ting with even more admiration.

Shi Ting clapped his hands and said, “This is the place that is most suitable for you. However, your final cultivation will depend on your own fate.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang agreed and was about to sit cross-legged to cultivate when he was stopped by Shi Ting.

“Little guy, this kind of cultivation method will have little effect on you,” Shi Ting said as he raised his right hand.

Suddenly, the Tarot Divine Sword that was hanging behind Jian Wushuang’s back soared into the sky and hovered above his head as if it had a mind of its own.

“The path of cultivation is to constantly search for the Dao and the process of Dao vindication. You’ve already vaguely touched that level, so I’ll give you a trace of Enlightenment.”

Shi Ting’s words were clear but they were like hammers that smashed into Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Before chaos was formed, when heaven and earth were still one, chaos was the Dao. The chaos turns into clear and turbid Qis, and these two Qis are two streaks.”

“When the great era begins, the number of Daos will increase.”

“Dao appears to have no limits, but it has limits. Some people can pry into the profoundness within and prove themselves, while some people can’t touch that layer of meaning in their entire lives.”

“Little guy, although you already have a complete Dao, it’s not yours. But with your current realm, it’s rare for you to understand the meaning.”

“All I can do now is to let you guard the Dao in your heart and stabilize your state of mind.”

Shi Ting did not care about Jian Wushuang’s arrogance. He said slowly, “Unparalleled existence.”

Boom!

It was as if a thunderbolt had exploded in his divine sense. Jian Wushuang could no longer remain calm.

He directly stretched out his hand and the Tarot Divine Sword appeared in his hand. divine power surged out uncontrollably.

Holding the Tarot Divine Sword, Jian Wushuang was like an unsheathed sharp sword, revealing its sharp edge!

“Not bad, the divine power is sharp. It seems that you have some understanding of the sword.” Shi Ting seemed to be satisfied.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and then said firmly, “Sir, I think I have roughly understood the concept in my heart. I am determined to enter the Dao with the sword!”

Shi Ting nodded and signaled Jian Wushuang to make his move.

In this vast and majestic divine power dojo, the divine power that he had used up could be replenished almost instantly.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang no longer held back and directly activated Chaos Overlord Body. The purple color of the ‘Chuan’ character between his eyebrows exuded.

“Eternal Night!”

Jian Wushuang directly performed the first move of the Tarot Sword Manual. Blazing black gas gushed out from the sword and transformed into a black ball that swept toward Shi Ting.

With the support of the vast divine power, the momentum and power of the first move of the sword code were several times stronger than the previous ones.

Just as the black ball was about to hit Shi Ting, the space around it paused. Then, the black ball split into two from the center and dissipated into black smoke.

Jian Wushuang was not surprised by the situation and directly used the third move of the sword code, Dusk.

At that moment, with Shi Ting as the center, the pit that should have collapsed did not appear. Instead, a huge repulsive force hit Jian Wushuang and sent him flying.

After retreating for dozens of feet, Jian Wushuang stabbed his sword into the ground to stop his retreating figure. His Qi and blood were boiling violently.

He swallowed the blood in his throat and slowly got up.

The Sword Manual’s Dusk did not affect Shi Ting at all. Instead, the damage that was rejected was reflected back to Jian Wushuang, which made him extremely depressed.

And Shi Ting stood at the same spot from start to finish, not even moving a step.

Looking at his calm appearance, he probably did not even use much strength.

Jian Wushuang adjusted his state of mind, took a deep breath, and quietly induced the fourth move.

“Four Seasons.”

A silent cold light emerged from Jian Wushuang’s feet. With the support of the vast divine power of the dojo, it swept through the entire dojo almost instantly.

Under this move, even the divine power that supported the operation of the Daoist sanctum paused for a moment.

Now’s the time!

Jian Wushuang suddenly jumped and poured all his divine power into the Tarot Divine Sword. He slashed down from the sky and attacked Shi Ting.

The slash that could easily tear the universe apart only left a faint white mark in the air of the Land of Sorrows. When the sword mark reached Shi Ting, it was only an inch long.

Shi Ting stretched out his index and middle fingers and pinched the sword mark, causing it to be destroyed!

After the attack stopped, Jian Wushuang did not stop. He stepped on the ground and ran toward Shi Ting.

In an instant, a carefree Tarot divine corpse appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

All the previous moves were in service of this moment. The huge figure was like a mountain, and it pressed down with Jian Wushuang’s sword!

Whizz…

A slight collision sound was heard, and time seemed to have stopped.

The shadow of Supreme Tarot had yet to retreat, and Jian Wushuang was still suspended in the air. The long sword in his hand was only one palm away from Shi Ting, but it could not move an inch further.

Shi Ting was still standing at the same place. He raised his right palm above his head as if he was holding a sword to block Jian Wushuang’s most powerful attack.

“The person who created this set of sword techniques was quite experienced. If he were to improve one more step, it would be considered to be truly perfect,” Shi Ting said softly as if he was feeling sorry and pushed his right hand up slightly.

In an instant, like a receding tide, Jian Wushuang was sent flying.

Shi Ting’s attack seemed to be as light as the wind, but when it actually landed on his body, it almost made him lose the ability to resist.

After landing on the ground, Jian Wushuang directly spat out a large mouthful of divine blood. The Tarot Divine Sword, which had never left his hand, was also nailed to the side. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

An unprecedented sense of powerlessness overwhelmed him. The last time he felt this powerlessness was when he was Void God, who had broken through the universe to kill him.

Shi Ting walked slowly toward Jian Wushuang with his hands behind his back.

“Who wrote the sword techniques you are using?”

Jian Wushuang stood up slowly with the help of the Tarot Divine Sword. “He’s a genius Senior from my Divine Power Universe.”

“To be able to comprehend this sword technique, he must be a Heaven’s Favorite. But why doesn’t he improve this sword technique?”

“That’s because the Senior who created the sword code has already died,” Jian Wushuang said dejectedly.
