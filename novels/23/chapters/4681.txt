4683 Yan Immortal

“I respect his decision,” Leng Rushuang said with a bitter smile.

Ninth Kalpa King took a step back and lost his soul. He had never expected that Jian Wushuang would be so determined to destroy his Ancestral source in such an intense way!

The Ancestor realm supreme fate energy dissipated between the heavens and earth, and it was impossible to gather it back.

There was no turning back. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Master, Dao Yan asks you to stop.” Dao Yan knelt heavily on the ground, his eyes filled with tears.

“Why are you doing this, cosmos God?!” Elder Xue Bo wept. “Is the universe that you’ve been protecting all this time not enough for you? Aren’t you going to miss us?”

“Alright! Fine! This old man will go with you.” Without hesitation, Elder Xue Bo reached out to destroy his life source, but he was held back by Long Yan and Long Chi.

“No, there must be a reason for Jian Wushuang’s actions. Otherwise, he would have no reason to do so…” Feng Qi slowly got up and murmured.

At the same time, Ninth Kalpa King also recalled the conversation he had with Jian Wushuang.

One of the most important words was the Great Yan Domain!

Ninth Kalpa King seemed to have realized something. Could Jian Wushuang’s scattering of the Ancestral fate energy be related to the Great Yan Domain?

The Ancestor fate energy returned to the thousands of Daos in the heavens, and every Half Ancestor felt the shackles on their bodies begin to loosen.

Supreme Dao Yan was Half Ancestor realm.

Everyone’s eyes were slightly red as they looked at the figure whose aura was gradually weakening.

In the hazy fate energy, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with great difficulty. He looked at his old brothers who had walked out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. He smiled and finally lowered his eyes.

At first, the thousands of rays of the Great Dao enveloped his body, but in the end, they dissipated in the same way.

The peak Ancestor realm expert of the universe no longer existed.

Jian Wushuang himself felt extremely relaxed and ethereal. His divine soul seemed to have flown up to the Nine Heavens, but he did not know where it was.

At the same time, the divine power in his meridians and Dantian began to dissipate, and in its place was an unknown energy.

The energy was like clouds and mist, but it was majestic and vast.

That was – Yan power!

When this kind of energy was born in the meridians, it would burn directly in the meridians, and even the soul would find it difficult to bear the pain.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes and a shadow began to be peeled off from his back.

The past that was formed from obsession, mortal cultivation, and all of one’s own comprehension began to take form.

Divine blood gushed out from every pore of Jian Wushuang’s body, soaking his white shirt in blood. However, he remained silent and slowly removed his past self from his divine body.

It was the most lustrous light, different from the red light of the sun, which was bright in the Dao Field.

A clay idol that was exactly the same as Jian Wushuang began to take shape.

A large area of the Dao Field collapsed, and the clouds gathered.

When the sun in the heavens beyond the heavens shone its brilliant rays of light again, everything fell silent.

The divine blood dissipated in the air. Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a white robe, sat on the spot, without any color of blood.

He forced his eyes open and then passed out.

Behind him, a True Shadow with a bright glow around it slowly opened its eyes.

The consciousness of the primal chaos was slowly born, and the clay idol began to look at everything in front of it with curiosity and confusion.

On the clouds, everyone rushed forward. Leng Rushuang crazily held Jian Wushuang, who had passed out.

As for Ninth Kalpa King and the others, they were shocked as they looked at the True Shadow that was exactly the same as Jian Wushuang.

“I’m… Hungry…” The clay idol opened its mouth and looked at everyone.

In the next moment, he was actually lying on the top of the clouds, looking at the clouds that were formed by pure divine power, and he began to eat heartily.

“This… Is that Jian Wushuang too?” Feng Qi was dumbfounded. She could not believe her eyes. She looked at the guy who was lying on the clouds, eating the clouds like eating cotton candy.

“Delicious, delicious…” the clay idol mumbled as it ate, like a child.

Everyone looked at each other and then hurriedly welcomed Jian Wushuang into the Cloud Palace.

As for the clay idol, it was directly carried by Ninth Kalpa King on his shoulder and sent into the heavenly Cloud Palace.

In the Cloud Palace, looking at the True Shadow that was almost the same as Jian Wushuang, everyone looked at each other. No one spoke first, but they all could not take their eyes off him.

Jian Wushuang had been led into the inner hall, and Leng Rushuang, Feng Qi, and the others were taking care of him.

Only ‘Jian Wushuang’ was left sitting in the same place, grinning foolishly…

In the end, it was the Ninth Kalpa King who probed, “Uou are Jian Wushuang?”

The clay True Shadow laughed foolishly. “I’m hungry…”

…

“What’s your name?”

“I’m hungry.”

…

After asking a series of questions and only getting the words ‘I’m hungry’, everyone understood that this fellow’s intelligence was probably not much stronger than a newborn baby.

No one could do anything about this guy who had been extracted from Jian Wushuang’s body. They would only have an answer when Jian Wushuang woke up.

In the inner hall, Chu Zhi was carefully placing pieces of the Ice of the Extreme North on Jian Wushuang’s body.

Feng Qi was sitting on one side of the bed, her eyes closed as she tried to sense his life force.

Previously, in the Cangwu Platform, she had transferred most of her Ancestral source into Jian Wushuang’s body. In some ways, only Feng Qi knew Jian Wushuang’s body condition better than anyone else.

However, Jian Wushuang’s current situation made Feng Qi feel helpless.

The current Jian Wushuang was like a big cocoon that was completely sealed off. It naturally rejected divine power.

No one could see his condition, but they could feel that his aura was stabilizing.

“Sister Feng Qi, how is Wushuang’s condition?” Leng Rushuang asked nervously.

Feng Qi frowned and said in a low voice, “His breathing is stable. There doesn’t seem to be any major problems. However, I’m afraid that his Dao will never come back.”

“It’s good that he survived. No matter what he becomes, I’ll always be with him,” Leng Rushuang said firmly.

Feng Qi did not say anything more and slowly walked away. Her back seemed to have aged a lot in an instant.

In the huge inner hall, only Jian Wushuang was left, whose Great Dao had disappeared.

When the last trace of divine power was expelled from his body, the vast Yan power finally surged!

A mysterious state was added to his body.

In the endless darkness, Jian Wushuang’s divine consciousness seemed to be swimming in eternal darkness.

The extremely intense feeling of weightlessness made him feel extremely uncomfortable.

It was as if he was falling without end, and an ethereal voice rang in his ears.

“Wushuang, you should not have disobeyed me.”

“You’ll regret this…”

In the pitch-black darkness, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and subconsciously looked at the extreme darkness below him.

The thing that was emitting endless darkness was actually a pair of pitch-black pupils that were like black holes!
