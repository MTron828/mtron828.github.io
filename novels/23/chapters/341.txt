Chapter 342: The Four Holy Masters

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The battle in Ice Nether Valley, especially the news of Jian Wushuang killing seven Saint Realm experts by himself, spread rapidly like a hurricane.

The entire Nanyang Continent was shocked by it.

Jian Wushuang was also remembered by all the experts in Nanyang Continent as an incredible monster-like warrior. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In a town near Ice Nether Valley lied a contact point for Alchemy School. Jian Wushuang and others were staying there for now.

In the hall of the contact point, Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan sat by a table, waiting in silence.

Before long, Wang Yuan and Wine Master walked in.

“How is little sister?” Jian Wushuang instantly asked.

“She will be fine,” Wine Master smiled and said, “That little girl has a very special constitution. Even I can’t decipher its secrets. Her heart and soul, though they were damaged a lot, will recover over time. So It’s not a big deal.”

“That’s great,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded while finally feeling relieved.

“Third brother, the person you should be worrying about right now is not little sister, but yourself,” Wang Yuan looked at Juan Wushuang with a serious look and said, “What you’re facing right now is far more serious than little sister. You have to figure out what to do.”

“That’s true. Holy Emperor Palace is not a force to be trifled with,” Wine Master said directly to Jian Wushuang.

“Holy Emperor Palace is like an overlord of Nanyang. Although?they are always ranked the same as Alchemy School, they are in fact slightly superior to Alchemy School, no matter in history, culture, or overall strength. Although this time you killed seven of there Saint Realm experts, which is a great loss to them, you still didn’t weaken their core strength at all!”

“What’s more, now that Holy Emperor Palace knows your actual strength, they won’t leave you any chances. Once they move, they will make sure to take your life. If I am not wrong, Holy Emperor Palace will send one of their four Holy Masters to kill you!”

“Four Holy Masters?” Jian Wushuang asked and raised his eyebrows.

Previously, he had heard Mo Yun speak about the Second Holy Master, who must be one of the four Holy Masters.

“The four Holy Masters... How should I put it... They are strong and dreadful!” Wine Master said solemnly.

Jian Wushuang squinted.

He knew that Wine Master was a super expert who had reached the pinnacle. His strength would definitely be ranked at the top in the Nanyang Continent. The Great Elder, a warrior with the greatest strength out of all those experts, was just like Feng Daoyang of Ice Nether Valley. He was only equal to Wine Master in the aspect of battle strength.

With his battle strength, Wine Master should be unrivaled in the Nanyang Continent, but he called the four Holy Masters “dreadful,” so the four Holy Masters should be exceptionally strong.

“The four Holy Masters of Holy Emperor Palace are indeed very powerful,” Wang Yuan also commented in a solemn tone.

Since he was the young master of the Alchemy School, and Alchemy School had many conflicts with Holy Emperor Palace over the years, he knew a lot about Holy Emperor Palace.

“I’ve heard from my father that each of the four Holy Masters have truly reached the pinnacle, and have lived for hundreds of years. Their cultivations are immeasurable, and each one of them can easily eliminate a top sect.”

“Moreover, the four Holy Masters are ranked by their battle strength from the first to the forth.”

” The Fourth Holy Master is a little weaker, while the Third Holy Master is slightly superior to him. The Second Holy Master is even stronger. As for First Holy Master, he is truly an old monster, and is regarded by many people as the strongest expert in Nanyang Continent!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked after hearing this.

The four Holy Masters were all experts who had reached the pinnacle.

Even in Ice Nether Valley, the strongest among the Three Valleys, there was only one supreme expert that had reached the pinnacle.

“I’ve met Second Holy Master and Fourth Holy Master before, and had fought with Fourth Holy Master... But, I lost the battle,” Wine Master said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, and Yang Zaixuan were all shocked.

Even Wine Master couldn’t beat Fourth Holy Master, the weakest of the Holy Masters?

“Don’t doubt it, all four Holy Masters have lived longer than me. In addition, the amount of manuals and treasures in Holy Emperor Palace is enormous. So it’s normal for them to be stronger than me, even though we are at the same level of cultivation. Especially First Holy Master, who is indeed a legend. But it would be an exaggeration to call him the strongest expert of Nanyang Continent,” Wine Master smiled and said.

“Is there anyone who is stronger than First Holy Master?” Wang Yuan looked at Wine Master.

“Of course,” Wine Master chuckled and said, “Nanyang Continent is not as simple as you think.”

“On the surface, Alchemy School and Holy Emperor Palace are indisputable overlords with connections to all the strongest experts. However, in fact, those top experts all know that there is one person in Nanyang Continent who is far beyond their reach,” Wine Master said.

“Who?” Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, and Yang Zaixuan immediately looked at Wine Master.

They were all eager to hear about the expert who was truly the strongest in the Nanyang Continent.

“This person is the mysterious monarch of Tang Dynasty!” Wine Master said.

“Him?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“The monarch of the Tang Dynasty is stronger than First Holy Master?” Wang Yuan was also shocked.

“Believe me,” Wine Master smiled and said, “You are all young, so there are many things you don’t know about. Even you, Wan Yuan. Although you are the young master of the Alchemy School, you are not your father, so what you know is limited. But an old fellow like me knows some things.”

“Many old freaks like me know that the most horrifying power in Nanyang Continent is neither Holy Emperor Palace nor Alchemy School, but the monarch of Tang Dynasty. He is the reason why none of the sects or powerful forces dare to meddle with the Tang Dynasty. He, as one person, is much scarier than the whole Holy Emperor Palace.”

“There is a saying among us old freaks, the monarch of Tang can fight against all of Nanyang!”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang and the others were astonished.

A man who was strong enough to fight the whole Nanyang Continent by himself?

Though it sounds a little exaggerated, it still showed the monstrous strength of the monarch of Tang Dynasty.

“It seems like I looked down on Nanyang Continent,” Jian Wushuang smiled and sighed to himself.

He always thought that the monarch of Tang Dynasty was mysterious, but he had no idea that the monarch had such horrifying power.

“Alright. That’s enough talk about him. What you need to worry about is the four Holy Masters. We don’t know which one Holy Emperor Palace will send to kill you.” Wine Master looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Your strength is nearly equal to mine, so you will stand a chance to surviving if Holy Emperor Palace sends Fourth Holy Master.”

“But you will be in trouble if Holy Emperor Palace sends Third Holy Master to go after you!”
