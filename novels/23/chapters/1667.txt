Chapter 1668: Desperate Situation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“I belittled the dark region,” Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth. He had already put the secret skill of Dragon to play to a great extent as he was besieged and hemmed in by the Star Demon.

In actual fact, he was cautious enough. After he entered the dark region, he had been spreading his soul power to his surroundings and even part of the underground was within the coverage of his soul power. He didn’t notice the existence of any Star Demons, nor did he notice any danger. Hence, he was courageous enough to chase after Real God Zi Ye.

But, he had never thought about the Star Demons hidden underground. They were out of the coverage of his soul power.

With Real God Zi Ye’s explosion, the Star Demons hidden deep underground were startled and popped up.

Then, he was cornered in a desperate situation.

“What should I do? What should I do?” Jian Wushuang constantly thought about the countermeasures. He was calm and composed and wasn’t panicking from the desperate situation he was in.

After all, a desperate situation like this was something he had encountered countless times before.

“The number of Star Demons is too huge and they were pressing in too closely. I didn’t even have a chance to use Mountain River Map.”

Jian Wushuang’s trump card, Mountain River Map, once he performed Nine-province Seal and possesses the power to destroy the world, he could kill a large number of Star Demons on the spot. However, it wasn’t easy to perform the trump card. He would at least require time to accumulate power. However, the Star Demons obviously wouldn’t give him that chance.

As for the secret skill of Star Palace… The secret skill of Star Place could only last for one breath when the number of Star Demons surrounding him was so huge. Even if he performed it, he reckoned it wouldn’t be of much help.

His two strongest trump cards were as such. As for his other tricks, like his soul attack, if he were to be fighting against weaker Star Demons, it would be fine. However, the crucial point was that there were tens of Three-Horned Star Demons and hundreds of Two-Horned Star Demons. Jian Wushuang’s soul power was at the level of an Eternal Real God and it wouldn’t pose a threat against Two-Horned Star Demons.

The other two secret skills of Ancient God tribe wouldn’t help him to shake off the danger before him either.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang suddenly looked down at the dark ground under him. On the cracked dark ground, there weren’t any Star Demons that popped out anymore.

“To the underground!”

Jian Wushuang immediately snuck into the dark ground and plunged towards the underground.

He knew that although Star Demons were extremely strong, they were different from human cultivators. They relied mostly on their sight power to hunt, unlike human cultivators who covered their surrounding with consciousness. As long as he went underground and got out of their sight, he could stand a chance to escape.

His idea was great, but in the end, not long after he went underground, he immediately soared up from the underground.

“The underground in the dark region contains such strong corrosive power!” Jian Wushuang looked unpleasant.

He finally understood why the Star Demons in the dark region opted to hide deep underground. It was because there was a unique corrosive power in the underground. The deep it was, the stronger the corrosive power was. It was so strong that Jian Wushuang’s Chaotic Real God level divine body couldn’t withstand it. However, to Star Demon, the corrosive power was an extremely great supplement. It was also the corrosive power that had nurtured them all this while.

“If I can’t go underground then I shall try the river!”

Jian Wushuang spread his soul power to his extreme and he could feel that there was a huge river tens of thousand miles away. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The river current was tempestuous and the river was in black. It looked unusually creepy.

However, at the crucial moment, Jian Wushuang couldn’t be bothered. He plunged down and fled into the black river without hesitation.

The moment he entered the water, he felt a bolt of corrosive power as well.

“Luckily, although the river has corrosive power, the corrosive power isn’t as strong as deep underground. With my divine body, I can just about withstand it,” Jian Wushuang muttered as he plunged into the water.

Although the countless Star Demons plunged into the river after Jian Wushuang, the moment he reached the bottom of the river and was covered by the water, they found it difficult to see Jian Wushuang’s location.

“There’s hope,” Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

However, the surprise only lasted for a short while. Then, Jian Wushuang noticed two figures that followed behind him.

There were two tall Three-Horn Star Demons and the two of them were a crimson red. They looked just like two Crimson Star Demons. One of them had fought against Jian Wushuang earlier and inflicted a severe injury that broke his arm.?He even lost his Blood Mountain Sword because of it.

When there was only one, it already caused such damage. Then, there were a total of two Crimson Star Demons behind Jian Wushuang and their eyes were giving out crimson light. They weren’t giving him a chance to escape and locked their gazes on Jian Wushuang even when they were in the river

“D*mn it!”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but curse. Then, he immediately made a decision.

“Two Crimson Star Demons…” Jian Wushuang’s gaze grew cold and there was a unique power that soared from within.

That power was the power of Star Palace.

Besides, between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows, there was a total of six gold ancient stars that revealed themselves. Along with Jian Wushuang’s expression, the top two ancient stars broke apart.

The secret skill of Ancient God… Star Destruction Skill!

The two ancient stars shattered and turned into a boundless power of Ancient God that instantly flowed into Jian Wushuang’s right index finger. In addition to Jian Wushuang’s divine power and the power of Stars, the finger suddenly gave out a resplendent, divine glow.

“Ancient God’s Sixth Finger, Sun Corrosion!”

Rumble.

A huge sun suddenly surfaced from under the river.

The sun was extremely glorious along with having a terrifying power. The surrounding river water was evaporating at a terrifying speed.

Ancient God’s Sixth Finger!

The Sixth Finger was performed by Jian Wushuang along with the secret of Star Palace and the prerequisite of him breaking two ancient stars.

The power of the finger had already reached the extreme limit that a Real God could achieve. Even the Real Gods on Real God ranking list, there were definitely very few who could perform such a powerful attack.

Then, the finger suddenly charged towards the two crimson Star Demons that were chasing after him. Then, the two crimson Star Demons were drowned straightaway.

Just as Jian Wushuang performed Ancient God’s Sixth Finger with his all to kill the two crimson Star Demons, in the deepest bottom of the river…

Vroom!

There were two crimson lanterns that appeared from nowhere. The two lanterns were as glorious as the sun but due to the existence of the prohibition, the light didn’t spread.

“The Power of Star Palace?”

An ancient yet deep voice was heard, but the voice didn’t spread.
