Chapter 3569: Six Human-Shaped Sculptures

Previously, Jian Wushuang had only tried to rush out of the high platform. As soon as he moved, the human-shaped sculpture closest to him would wake up and stop him. He had been unable to break through just one human-shaped sculpture, naturally, the other human-shaped sculptures did not wake up.

But now, the humanoid statue had been thrown out of the high platform. He had successfully arrived at the middle of the high platform. When he arrived here, a total of five humanoid statues around the high platform opened their eyes at the same time, including the one that had been thrown out of the high platform by Jian Wushuang, a total of six humanoid statues moved to kill him at the same time.

“Only six?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He thought that he had created the most powerful skill and broken through the first human-shaped statue, so the next 17 statues should all wake up. However, only six of them attacked, only one-third of them, the remaining 12 statues still did not move.

“Can six human-shaped sculptures stop me?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold.

After all, there was a huge gap between an absolute art at the peak of the sixth rank and the most powerful absolute art at the sixth rank.

The difference in the power of the absolute art was more than 10 times.

This meant that Jian Wushuang could easily crush any human-shaped sculpture. However, if six of them joined hands, he could still crush them with the Starfire Burning Sun move.

Soon, Jian Wushuang made his move.

Boom!

The power burst out. Jian Wushuang’s shadow sword emitted a faint purple cold light and slashed out in an instant.

The Sword Shadow swept out, forming a raging purple flame that covered the six human-shaped sculptures in front of him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The six human-shaped sculptures immediately made their moves. They stood in front of Jian Wushuang and attacked together. The posture and power of the six human-shaped sculptures were exactly the same, it was exactly the same as the swordsmanship of the human-shaped statue that Jian Wushuang had been fighting for 3,000 years.

The swordsmanship was only at the peak of stage six.

However, after the six human-shaped statues displayed their swordsmanship, an incredible scene appeared.

The six human-shaped statues displayed their swordsmanship individually, but after they displayed their swordsmanship, the swordsmanship of the six human-shaped statues immediately formed a whole, as if their swordsmanship was a whole, the six Sword Shadows also completely merged into one, instantly forming an incredible sword shadow that slashed toward Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

The Sword Shadow swept through the battle as if it was a piece of dried twigs. The burning purple flames that covered the entire sky disappeared in an instant, and Jian Wushuang’s sword move completely disintegrated.

The power of the sword shadow was still applied to Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang only felt an incredible power rushing toward him, instantly pushing him back to the starting point, which was the center of the high platform.

After returning to this place, the six human-shaped sculptures immediately stopped and returned to where they were standing and closed their eyes again.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang’s mind was in a daze.

“How, how could this be?”

Jian Wushuang’s face was full of disbelief.

After all, he had created the most powerful skill of the sixth stage. His Starfire Burning Sun move was obviously much more powerful than the swordsmanship displayed by the human-shaped sculptures, even more than ten times, however, when the six human-shaped sculptures joined hands and displayed the same swordsmanship, they actually merged together and completely crushed him.

“A formation. These human-shaped sculptures use a special formation.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

He could see that these human-shaped sculptures combined their swordsmanship with a special formation to form a whole. After forming a whole, the swordsmanship was dozens of times more powerful than the swordsmanship displayed by each of them, it was much stronger than his Starfire Burning Sun, which was why he was crushed.

“I thought that as long as I created the strongest sixth-level skill, I would have a chance to pass through this high platform. But now it seems that I’m still far from it.” Jian Wushuang felt bitter in his heart.

The swordsmanship power formed by the combination of six human-shaped sculptures was much stronger than the strongest skill he had created. So if ten human-shaped sculptures joined hands…or if all 18 sculptures joined hands? Then what incredible power would they have after combining their swordsmanship?

“It’s not enough. Creating the strongest absolute art of the sixth realm is not enough to break out of this array. It’s far from enough!”

“If these 18 sculptures can perfectly combine their swordsmanship and increase the power of their swordsmanship by dozens or even hundreds of times, then if I want to break through this place, I have to create at least the Ruler Realm, which is a seventh-level absolute art!” Jian Wushuang’s face was very ugly.

A rank seven secret art was a Master Realm secret art.

Under normal circumstances, only experts at the Master Realm could create such a secret art. Of course, a few heaven-defying experts at the pinnacle of the six realm could also create such a secret art, but after all, there were too few of them, in this territory, there were not many experts at the pinnacle of the six realm, but among these experts, there was probably no one who had created a Master Realm secret art.

If there was one person, Jian Wushuang knew it was Di Shisan!

Di Shisan, the leader of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, who had a great relationship with Jian Wushuang.

According to Elder Dark Bone, Di Shisan was a genius of sword principle. His understanding of sword principle had reached a new level, which many experts at the Ruler Realm had never been involved in. His understanding of sword principle was so high, it was no surprise that he must have created a Master Realm absolute art.

However, Jian Wushuang could not find another person in this territory besides him.

What kind of person was Di Shisan?

He was definitely a shocking sword principle genius.

Jian Wushuang was not so arrogant as to be able to compete with such a sword principle genius.

Moreover, Di Shisan was a genuine Principles Master, and he was also a Principles Master at the pinnacle of the six realm. However, Jian Wushuang was just an Immortal Saint.

For an Immortal Saint to create at least a level seven absolute art, the test of the human-shaped sculpture array was so harsh that it was unbearable.

“This test...” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, feeling a little angry.

He was angry because the test was too difficult.

He had been through all kinds of tests in his two lives, but he had never felt that it was so difficult.

It was so difficult that he even felt a little hopeless.

“No, I can’t be anxious, and I can’t be completely hopeless.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth and quickly calmed down.
