Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Celestial Master Green Wolf is in Exceptional Realm and wears a protective armor. He is indeed strong in defense. However, I’m covered in Blood-killing Plate Armor and cultivate Golden Image Secret Skill. Moreover, I have a strong body. In terms of defense, I’m better than him!” His eyes flashed with excitement.

When it came to surviving, Jian Wushuang believed that he was the best present.

Compared to Celestial Master Green Wolf, the elixirs would definitely be safer with him!

“Prepare to die, Jian Wushuang!”

The strong elder shouted as his heavy sword became as gigantic as a mountain that charged at Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!” The middle-aged man bearing a thunder-like mark on his forehead snorted as he brandished his Giant Axe at Jian Wushuang.

Besides, the third Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm the Jin Kingdom sent also arrived. He charged at Jian Wushuang directly.

“Damn!”

Celestial Master Green Wolf’s expression changed dramatically. He glared at Jian Wushuang as he warded off the third Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm.

However, he could only stop one of them. There were still two more Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm and a few advanced Celestial Masters that had targeted Jian Wushuang.

“Come and try me!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with immense battle intent. His Blood Mountain Sword was shaking. Then, he struck quickly.

Sword light flashing, Jian Wushuang single-handedly engaged the strong elder, the middle-aged man, and a few advanced Celestial Masters. The fight was intense.

Bang! Bang! Clang! Boom!

Thunderous sounds reverberated in the battlefield. At that time, Jian Wushuang released all the power in his body. His Blood Mountain Sword was going full speed ahead. He had warded off the strikes from the strong elder and the middle-aged man with a thunder-like mark. On the other hand, the few advanced Celestial Masters charged directly at him.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang looked cold. A jolt went through his body but he swiftly recovered.

“Kill!”

“Kill him!”

“He actually wants to fight us alone? He’s digging his own grave!”

The several advanced Celestial Masters who surrounded Jian Wushuang were full of killing intents.

Jian Wushuang was only fending off the two Celestial Masters and ignored them, which left them furious.

All of a sudden, they struck again.

The strong elder and the middle-aged man with a thunder-like mark moved as well.

Two Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm, along with a few advanced Celestial Masters encircled Jian Wushuang.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Horrifying growls reverberated in the air.

The thunder lasted for several seconds. The two Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm and the advanced Celestial Masters had attacked Jian Wushuang 10 times, but it turned out that…

“Die!”

An advanced Celestial Master screamed furiously and brandished his sword at Jian Wushuang. However, he just crouched. At the next moment, a beautifully sorrowful sword light glided over.

“What?” The advanced Celestial Master widened his eyes.

Never did he except a blow from Jian Wushuang, who had been besieged by them for a long time. He actually had the strength to fight back?

Moreover, his swordsmanship was formidable and swift as usual.

The Celestial Master was penetrated in the throat before he was able to dodge. His corpse fell to the ground.

“Get lost, all of you!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and again he brandished Blood Mountain Sword. This time, he used Heaven’s Bane to sweep his opponents.

The advanced Celestial Masters who had surrounded Jian Wushuang all withdrew.

When they had retreated to a safe place, they stopped to stare at the scarlet-robed youth carrying a longsword. All of them looked disheartened.

“Two Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm and several advanced Celestial Masters joined to besiege him. It turned out he actually killed one of us?” The strong elder widened his eyes with disbelief.

“He, Jian Wushuang…” Green Wolf was fighting another Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm. At the sight of this, he was shocked as well.

If he had been besieged like that, he would have been badly injured. He would never dream of killing one of the opponents.

But now…

“Go on!”

“Jin Kingdom bastards, go on! I’d love to see who die first!”

Jian Wushuang fixed his cold eyes on them, and his provocation left everyone present in fear.

The strong elder and the middle-aged man with a thunder-like mark both looked terrible.

However, at this time…

“Prepare to die, Jian Wushuang!”

With a shout, a frosty bald teenager strode toward Jian Wushuang, carrying his golden machete.

Immediately, the bald teenager clenched his gold machete with both hands. Power surged from him. Behind him, a golden dragon spectral image emerged. With overwhelmingly strong power, he struck out.

“Dragon Slayer!”

The bald teenager looked vicious. The moment he brandished the machete, terrifying strong power gathered and rush to Jian Wushuang.

“Damn!”

“It’s Jin Yi!”

“Celestial Master Jin Yi from the Jin Kingdom, he’s among the top three even in Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm of the Jin Kingdom. Not even Celestial Master An can compare with him. Moreover, this is his best move, Dragon Slayer!”

Celestial Masters of Green Fire Palace were all shocked at the sight of this.

Celestial Master Green Wolf furrowed his brows. “Celestial Master Jin Yi has performed his best and famous strike, even if Jian Wushuang fends it off, he’ll be badly injured, Jian Wushuang…”

Boom!

A surging golden saber shadow fell from the sky toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt Majestic Mountain power rushing to him.

The strike was even more formidable than the combined forces of the strong elder, the middle-aged man with a cloud-like mark, and several advanced Celestial Masters.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang never feared.

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth, his eyes flashing with madness. Ancient God Power surrounded his Blood Mountain Sword as he expanded his body to three meters high. His body took on a dark gold glow. Then, he brandished his sword.
