Chapter 3358: Searching

Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the secret realm of heaven and earth, a group of 15 people from the Temporal Temple and the Xiaoyao Mansion were wandering around.

The secret realm of heaven and earth was not big. Soon, Jian Wushuang and the others arrived at its core. There were many palaces and pavilions standing there. These palaces and pavilions were quite majestic, obviously, they were not something that ordinary small sects could have.

“The treasures left by the Amethyst Demon Sect are probably hidden in these palaces and pavilions. Let’s take our time to find them.” Jian Wushuang smiled and the group immediately began to search carefully in the palaces and pavilions.

Time passed, and more than half a day passed ina flash.

They had searched all the palaces and pavilions in the secret realm, but they did not find any treasures.

“How could it be?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Is the treasure not hidden in the palaces and pavilions, but somewhere else in the secret realm? Or is there no treasure opportunity left by the Amethyst Demon Sect in the secret realm?” Sword Dragon Master said.

“No, it’s too early to tell, Maybe the treasure is hidden here, but it’s hidden so well that we didn’t find it. Let’s search again,” Jian Wushuang said.

The people of the Xiaoyao Mansion, including Marquis Xiaoyao, did not have any objections.

Soon, they searched the palace again. This time, they searched more carefully. It could be said that they searched the entire palace, but they still found nothing.

“It seems that even if there is treasure left by the Amethyst Demon Sect in the secret land, it must be hidden very well. If we continue to search like this, it’s probably useless, Why don’t we spread out and search?” Marquis Xiaoyao suggested.

“Spread out?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and then smiled. “Yes, but there’s no need to spread out too much. How about this, the experts of the Temporal Temple and your Marquis Xiaoyao each send a team of two to search. That way, even if we find the treasure, we can share it fairly, right?”

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Marquis Xiaoyao’s expression did not change, but his heart jumped.

He actually hoped that the experts from both sides could split up to search for the treasure. In this way, if his people were lucky enough to get the treasure, they could say that they did not get it, and Jian Wushuang would not be able to explore it, they had a chance to take the treasure for themselves.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang had already seen through his plan, so he said that they would move in pairs. Moreover, both sides would send one person each. In terms of the number of people on both sides, the Temporal Temple would have a few more people, in this way, the Temporal Temple would have a

chance to secretly occupy the treasures they found.

After Jian Wushuang made his decision, the experts from both sides quickly began to work in pairs to search the secret land of heaven and earth.

As the leader, Jian Wushuang, of course, was with Marquis Xiaoyao. The two of them also searched the secret land of heaven and earth.

However, even though the group had been divided into several groups and the efficiency of the search was much higher than before, they still could not find anything after searching.

Time passed, and soon, Jian Wushuang and the others had entered the secret land of heaven and earth for a day.

Ina magnificent palace, two rule masters stood in the middle and carefully observed the surroundings.

One of the two Principles Masters was Master Tianfu from the Temporal Temple, and the other was Master Xue Yi from the Xiaoyao Mansion.

“We’ve been to this palace several times, but we didn’t find anything before. It seems that we can’t find anything this time,” Master Xue Yi said.

“Don’t be anxious. Keep looking carefully. We can’t tell if there are any special mechanisms or formations hidden in this palace. It’s just that we haven’t activated them yet,” Master Tianfu said.

Master Xue Yi shrugged and could only continue searching. The two of them also kept trying to move the decorative equipment in the palace to see if there were any mechanisms, but unfortunately, there was nothing.

The two of them could only sigh softly and leave the palace.

Just as they walked out of the palace, a gray stream of light suddenly flashed around them.

“Huh?” Master Tianfu narrowed his eyes. “Master Xue Yi, did you see a gray light just now?”

“Gray light? What gray light?” Master Xue Yi glanced at Master Tianfu. He and Master Tianfu had walked out of the palace at the same time, but he had indeed not seen any gray light just now.

“That’s not right. I clearly saw a gray light flash just now. Although it disappeared very quickly, there was definitely one.” Master Tianfu was incomparably certain.

“You really saw it?” Master Xue Yi’s expression also moved.

Master Tianfu was a dignified Principles Master. Of course, there was no way he could have seen anything wrong. Since he had seen the gray light just now, there was an 80% chance that he was right.

And just as the two of them were extremely puzzled.

‘The gray light lit up once again, and this time, it came directly in front of them.

“What is this?” Master Xue Yi’s expression immediately changed.

“Be careful!” Master Tianfu immediately shouted out.

Xiu!

‘That gray light carried an incomparable speed and impact force, instantly enveloping Master Tianfu and Master Xue Yi. The two of them had not even seen clearly what this gray light was, however, a terrifying might had already swept over.

Boom!

The peaceful heaven and earth secret realm suddenly let out a roar. It was like a sudden clap of thunder on flat ground, instantly exploding.

This terrifying roar was accompanied by a shocking might that spread wildly in all directions. At the first moment, it crushed some of the surrounding palaces and pavilions into powder. Even the entire heaven and earth secret realm was on the verge of collapsing under this terrifying might, it’s all falling

apart.

“What’s wrong?”

“What’s going on?”

“What a terrible power. Who is it?”

Many experts, including Jian Wushuang and Marquis Xiaoyao, who were searching for treasures and opportunities in the secret land of heaven and earth, were shocked by this terrifying power. One by one, they soared into the sky, appear in the void, all eyes, all look to the source of that power.

However, when they took a look, they could only see the shocking might and energy that was crazily attacking, as well as the large waves of air that were stirred up by the might. They could not see anything else clearly. After a while, the might gradually depleted, only then did they see the void clearly.

They could see that the void, including the land, had already become a piece of trash. A huge pit appeared in everyone’s line of sight, and under the pit, one of Master Tianfu and Master Xue Yi stood there trembling, the other had already half-knelt down. Both of their faces were pale, and their auras were

completely dispirited. There was still blood spewing from their mouths under their feet.

This scene caused everyone’s pupils to constrict.
