“I’ve seen the mirror image of Jian Wushuang fighting with someone. He killed a rank seven True Saint with the strength of a rank four True Saint. No one can surpass him. But how could he fight Duan Lang?” The white-robed young man asked in confusion.

“It’s like this…” The red-haired girl told him what had happened.

The white-robed young man was surprised. “Temple Master Bai Xing gave him the quota to enter the Blood Wave Realm?”

“Yes, and the order has been made public. Temple Master Bai Xing gave the order himself. No one can change it except for the elusive Temporal Temple Master,” the red-haired girl said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s not strange. In the opening of the Blood Wave Realm this time, Duan Lang should be one of the five spots in our Temporal Temple. However, now that this spot has been given to the Heavenly Sword Marquis, how could Duan Lang be willing to accept it? It’s normal for him to want to challenge the Heavenly Sword Marquis.” The white-robed young man nodded slightly, then, a smile appeared on his face. “The Heavenly Sword Marquis is so talented that he might be even more talented than you and me. I’m a little curious about his battle with Duan Lang.”

“Come, let’s go and take a look.”

“Okay.” The red-dressed girl immediately agreed. He came here to find this white-robed man.

In the center of the spacetime island, there was a huge drill ground.

This drill ground was not only vast but there was also a vast spacetime in the center. This spacetime was where the cultivators of the spacetime divine hall usually sparred.

Now, the drill ground was quite lively. Many experts of the Temporal Temple had come here.

“There are quite a lot of people. There are more than a dozen Principles Masters.”

The white-robed young man, Qian Hongzi, and the red-clothed girl, Feixue, came to the drill ground together and looked around.

There were more than 20 people on the drill ground, and there were more than a dozen Principles Masters.

In fact, these Principles Masters stayed on the time-space Island all year round and had nothing to do. They only came to watch the fight when they knew there were two little guys. Of course, most of them were here for Jian Wushuang.

After all, Jian Wushuang’s battle record of killing a seventh rank True Saint in the fourth true realm had shocked these Principles Masters.

“By the way, why aren’t Di Hao and Yue Yu here?” Qian Hongzi asked.

There were many top-level Immortal Saints in the Temporal Temple, but most of them were very old and had passed their era. Therefore, they were not qualified to enter the Blood Wave Realm.

In this era, there were five people in the Temporal Temple who were qualified and had the potential to enter the Blood Wave Realm, excluding Jian Wushuang.

Besides Qian Hongzi, Feixue, and Duan Lang, there were two other people, Di Hao and Yue Yu.

“Yue Yu is still adventuring in the outside world and hasn’t come back yet. I sent him a message and he said that he will return to the spacetime island in three years,” Feixue said, “as for Di Hao…this cultivation madman only cares about himself. He only focuses on cultivation and doesn’t care about anything else. Although he has returned to the spacetime island, he entered the spacetime tower as soon as he came back. He didn’t respond to my message.”

“These two guys…” Qian Hongzi smiled bitterly.

At this moment, two figures appeared in the vast space in the center of the drill ground under everyone’s gaze.

These two people were naturally Jian Wushuang and Duan Lang.

“Is he Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Qian Hongzi stared at Jian Wushuang with interest, then casually said, “Feixue, who do you think will win the battle between Heavenly Sword Marquis and Duan Lang?”

“I don’t know, but in my opinion, Duan Lang has a good chance of winning.” Feixue said, “Duan Lang has long surpassed the rank seven True Saint Realm, and his talent is very high. His strength is very close to yours and mine, and he hasn’t fought with us for many years. Maybe his strength has improved a lot. Even I’m not sure if I can win against him.”

“As for that Heavenly Sword Marquis…three hundred years ago, he was only able to kill a primary rank seven True Saint. Now, three hundred years later, if he wants to be compared to Duan Lang, I feel that he is slightly inferior.”

“What you said is right, but don’t forget one thing. Giving the spot to Heavenly Sword Marquis was an order personally given by Hall Master Bai Xing. Hall Master Bai Xing’s character has long been decided in the Temporal Temple. She is one-sided and will never favor anyone. And since she gave the spot to Heavenly Sword Marquis, it means that in her heart, Heavenly Sword Marquis is more suitable to head to the Blood Wave Realm than Duan Lang. and in terms of strength, that Heavenly Sword Marquis might have already surpassed Duan Lang.” Qian Hongzi said.

“Surpass Duan Lang? That’s impossible, right?” Fei Xue could not believe it.

“Just watch.” Qian Hongzi smiled faintly.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lang faced each other from a distance in the vast space. Jian Wushuang looked calm, but Duan Lang clenched his hands and looked at Jian Wushuang with a cold gaze.

“Duan Lang!”

A cold voice suddenly sounded. The people around the drill ground immediately looked at the noble figure in the void.

“Temple Master Bai Xing.” Duan Lang immediately bowed respectfully.

“It was my personal order to give the quota to Heavenly Sword Marquis. How dare you question me?” Temple Master Bai Xing looked down at Duan Lang.

Duan Lang immediately became nervous.

He did not expect Temple Master Bai Xing to directly question him before the battle with Jian Wushuang began.

“Temple Master Bai Xing,” Duan Lang said respectfully, “I don’t dare to question your name. I’m just absolutely confident in my own strength. I’m sure that my strength is definitely above that of Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

“Oh?” The beautiful eyes of Palace Master Bai Xing lifted, following that, he coldly said, “This battle can determine the strength of the two of you. If it is really as you say and you defeat Heavenly Sword Marquis and win this great battle, then I guarantee that I will let you enter the Blood Wave Realm.”

“What?” Duan Lang was stunned at first, but soon after, he became ecstatic.

The expressions of the people around the drill ground became strange.

“What’s going on? Palace Master Bai Xing’s orders have already been given out, so there shouldn’t be any changes. Even if Duan Lang really defeated Heavenly Sword Marquis, those five spots shouldn’t be changed to his name, right?” Feixue was filled with doubt.

“Are you stupid?” Qian Hongzi sneered, “Who said that the Temporal Temple only has five spots? If Palace Master Bai Xing is willing, not to mention one spot, even if there are two or three more spots, it wouldn’t be a problem.”

Feixue was stunned for a moment before coming to a realization.

“That’s right, that’s right. I forgot that every time we enter the Blood Wave Realm, the five spots are only given to the Temporal Temple by the various powers in the outside world. It isn’t something that the Temporal Temple fought for….”
