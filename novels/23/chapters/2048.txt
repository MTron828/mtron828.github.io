2049 Demon King“s Power

At the very moment when both parties collided, Jian Wushuang could distinctly feel an unprecedented power pounding at him madly.

Even if Jian Wushuang performed Mixed Elements Spirit with his all, he wouldn’t be able to resist the power. There would still be parts of the power that would transmit to Jian Wushuang’s divine body through his hands. Jian Wushuang’s divine power was extremely fierce but he had suffered some damage.

Although his divine body had instantly recovered with the operation of divine power, Demon King Chen Yu’s punch did cause damage to his divine body.

On top of that, Demon King Chen Yu’s fist didn’t hit his body but merely collided with his sword principle. The impact injured his divine body.

Such power would absolutely be a notch stronger than when Jian Wushuang exploded his full power.

“It seems that I belittled Three-Emperors World. The Three-Emperors World has even scarier Great Emperors.”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold. His figure quivered he stood steadily in the void. Then, he suddenly turned illusionary.

He was just like a spirit. Jian Wushuang appeared next to Demon King Chen Yu and there was a sharp gleam from Blood Mountain Sword.

The chilly gleam surged and there was a drop of blood faintly condensing on the tip of the blade.

Xuan Luo Sword Principle, the move that focused on instant explosion and piercing, the name of the move was… Extreme Blood.

“Such a joke!”

Demon King Chen Yu smirked in disdain. Then, he waved and a large dark cloud came over.

The cold sword light that Jian Wushuang had performed was smashed by a large demonic region before it appeared before Demon King Chen Yu. The power was diminished tremendously and in the end, the entire stroke shattered.

“To be able to take a punch of mine head-on, not too shabby. But in the end, you still have to die!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s demonic power was impressive. Just as he spoke, his originally two-meter-tall figure suddenly increased and became ten zhang tall. His skin turned into an ancient bronze color and he had a total of eight arms that extended outwards.

The eight arms were holding various weapons.

There was a broadsword, a huge club, a bronze mirror, a large seal…

In-between Demon King Chen Yu’s eyebrows, the third eye suddenly opened and it was hanging vertically. There was a crimson glow to it and it could charm anyone.

“Die!”

Demon King Chen Yu roared and his eight arms moved at the same time. He instantly came before Jian Wushuang and the various divine weapons swept down.

The broadsword tainted the surrounding void with blood and the broadsword continuously magnified and covered the sky. It formed overlapping sword shadows and they instantly slashed.

The black club was brutal. It turned into a bolt of black lightning and suddenly struck.

The bronze mirror gave out a purple ray of light. The purple light contained an extermination aura and it charged at Jian Wushuang.

The seal was originally an ordinary seal. As the yellowish-brown power filled the air, the seal turned into a huge mountain and crushed down on Jian Wushuang.

…

The eight various divine weapons in Demon King Chen Yu’s hands were performing different tricks.

Their powers were all terrifying.

Looking at the intense attack, Jian Wushuang was shocked but not fearful.

Vroom!

Jian Wushuang’s divine body grew tremendously too. Then, he had nine heads and eighteen arms that popped up instantly. All eighteen arms were holding swords.

“Come on!!!”

He roared. Jian Wushuang and Demon King Chen fought fiercely.

Even though Jian Wushuang had eighteen arms and his opponent only had eight, so he looked like he had the upper hand.

But in actual fact, the eighteen arms increased Jian Wushuang power to a limit. However, Demon King Chen Yu’s was different.

His eight arms wielded various types of divine weapons and could perform the power of the divine weapon flawlessly and fiercely.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were continuous loud bangs and the entire universe was in a divine power storm.

There was a terrifying power and aura that constantly spread, which caused the thirteen Great Emperors who were watching near the battlefield to be fearful.

There was no doubt that Jian Wushuang’s power was beyond Ling Zong’s or any one of the the thirteen Great Emperors’.

Then, Demon King Chen Yu, who was fighting against him, was even scarier!

He was one of the three Emperors that Three-Emperors worshipped!!

Hong!

There was another roar. On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang looked solemn, “This person, he is so powerful. He is at least a dozen times stronger than Ling Zong. He is much stronger than me too. I am suppressed when I fight against him?”

Jian Wushuang was in disbelief. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After he had broken through and gotten to the second stage, his power had increased tremendously. Even when the thirteen Great Emperors joined forces, he could be fearless and he could even injure them.

With his power, he thought that besides Emperor Bai, Emperor Thirteen and those ancient old monsters who were in a deep sleep and yet to wake up, there couldn’t be anyone who could be his match in Eternal Chaotic World.

However, Demon King Chen Yu before him was stronger than him. Much stronger than him.

“There’s such a powerful expert in Three-Emperors World?”

Jian Wushuang muttered an he had already thought of retreating.

He knew that his power wasn’t as strong as his opponent’s and there were thirteen Great Emperors waiting at the side. Jian Wushuang wouldn’t continue to fight against Demon King Chen Yu stupidly.

There was a billowing divine power with an ancient tribe bloodline power that exploded from Jian Wushuang.

Behind Jian Wushuang, there were lofty ancient tribe shadows. There seemed to be more than a hundred or thousand shadows.

“Ancient God unique skill, Universal Laws!”

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang slapped and Reincarnation Palm flew forward.

The Ancient God shadows behind him followed his actions and slapped their palms forward. Every palm contained boundless power.

The palms moved to bury Demon King Chen Yu simultaneously.

As for Jian Wushuang, he retreated as the Universal Laws performed.

“Go away!!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s power increased and the eight arms waved continuously to shatter the palms moving toward him. At the same time, he saw Jian Wushuang retreating.

“You, can’t escape!”

Demon King Chen Yu was soaring with murderous intention. Just as he roared, one of his eight arms clenched a jade ruler.

The jade ruler merged with the universe and there was yellow sand that instantly swept out.

The boundless sand swept out in madness. It instantly formed a huge yellow sand prison that covered the universe. It naturally covered Jian Wushuang too.
