Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s sword collided with the weapon from one of Puppet Fighters and forced the puppet downward. Then, he drew back his sword and quickly stabbed towards the puppet’s throat.

He was so fast that the puppet couldn’t completely defend itself and got hit.

“One defeated, but there are still nine left.”?Jian Wushuang smiled.

Several minutes ago, he was being overpowered by the Puppet Fighters and could barely fight back. But, now that he had decided to no longer restrain his power, he could battle them with ease.

Things continued on in a good direction.

One after another, Jian Wushuang quickly defeated the rest of the Puppet Fighters.

Finally, he cleared the 26th floor.

The senior experts were startled by the sudden change that occurred between Jian Wushuang and the Puppet Fighters.

“What’s going on?”

“His power greatly improved.”

“How could he release so much more power in such a short amount of time?”

The experts were confused. They had thought that the 25th floor was Jian Wushuang’s limit and that there was no way he could pass the 26th floor. So, what they had just witnessed was completely beyond their expectations.

“He is only in the Skyscraping Realm, yet he is as powerful as a Divine Realm expert.”

“I think it should be because of his strong body. He must have practiced some secret skills to strengthen his body, which allowed him to exert more power than other Skyscraping Realm experts,” Palace Master Destruction cried out in astonishment.

“His strong body?”

The experts stared at Jian Wushuang closely, no longer paying any attention to the other disciples.

At that moment, they were concerned with Jian Wushuang the most.

As they continued to watch, they realized it was true, Jian Wushuang had made it this far by relying on his body.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi, is it true that Jian Wushuang has practiced some secret skills to strengthen his body?” Palace Master Mo Tao asked Xuan Yi.

The experts all immediately looked toward Xuan Yi.

“I don’t know.” Xuan Yi shook his head.

His answer surprised the experts, who expect him, as Jian Wushuang’s master, to know every one of his disciple’s skills.

“I really have no idea about that,” Xuan Yi added.

“There are some secret skills in our sect that can be used to strengthen one’s body, but our sect regulations limit access to those skills. Only Divine Realm experts are allowed to practice them ad I’m a man of principle. Since Jian Wushuang has not reached that level, there is no way I have given any of those skills to him. As I see it, he already possessed this skill before entering our sect.”

After hearing that, all the experts were lost in thought.

They believed in Xuan Yi and knew that he would not lie to them.

“None of the information from the Firmament Territory Feast revealed that Jian Wushuang possessed this level of strength.”

“This boy is really cunning. He has hidden his real power from us this whole time, even during the Firmament Territory Feast.”

“I reckon if it was not because he wanted to get more resources, he would not have exposed his power to us even now.”

“He is really patient and determined. He truly lives up to his fame as a genius.”

When those experts looked at Jian Wushuang again, their eyes became frenzied.

Without question, they all wanted to have him, a genius with such great talent and a determined mind, as their disciple.

“He has passed the 26th floor, so I’m curious if he can pass the next floor as well,” someone suddenly said.

In fact, all the experts were looking forward to seeing what Jian Wushuang did next.

They changed their mind. In the beginning, they believed that Jian Wushuang would fail on the 18th floor, which turned out to be wrong. Later, they believed that the 25th floor was his limit, but he had already made it to the 26th floor.

At this point, they finally realized that they should give up predicting his performance because they did not know whether he had any trump cards remaining.

On the 27th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road, Jian Wushuang was facing an even greater pressure than before.

He had made a full use of most of his advantages when fighting with the Puppet Fighters on the 26th floor, and it had still been hard for him to defeat them.

Now, facing an even more difficult challenge, the 10 powerful Puppet Fighter on the 27th floor, he was not sure if he could succeed again.

“Just fight and see what result is!”

His eyes were filled with battle intent as he made his move and brought out a second figure that shared his exact appearance.

He revealed his two Original Bodies.

“Swish! Swish!”

The World Body and Slaughter Body charged at the 10 Puppet Fighters at the same time, with each body taking on five puppets. In no time, the 27th floor was embroiled in two intense battles.

“Doppelganger Secret Skill!”

The experts narrowed their eyes at the scene, but they were not surprised.

They had already heard about Jian Wushuang displaying this skill in the Firmament Territory Feast.

Chuu!

A spear attack that was targetting Jian Wushuang’s World Body quickly drew near.

The World Body met the spear with a sword and the sound of the loud collision echoed out. Before the World Body could regain his balance, two more Puppet Fighters drew near him and attacked. Seeing that, he hurriedly moved and dodged the attacks.

The World Body was completely suppressed, as was the Slaughter Body, who was fighting at the other side.

Though the situation was bad, Jian Wushuang remained calm.
