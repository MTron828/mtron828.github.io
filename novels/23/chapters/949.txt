Chapter 950: Power to Shatter the World

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The massively tall illusory figure of the Ancient God pointed its earth-shattering finger. At the same time, a layer of gold light descended. Wherever the light traveled, there would be explosion after explosion ringing in the Void. Its finger had yet to fall entirely but there was already terrifying aftermath spreading in all directions at a frantic speed.

Xia Yong stood in front of the enormous finger with a grim expression on his wizened face. He then unleashed his Holy Master might.

“The secret skill of the universe… Monster-slaying!”

His twin set of forces had risen to their peak. The green sledgehammer in his hand was shaking violently, emanating a majestic might. Endless power gathered on his yellow palm, and immediately his palm turned entirely red.

Following the sharp increase in the size of the sledgehammer in his hand, Xia Yong charged at the finger in the Void.

His attack detonated the entire world.

The explosion shattered the Void into smithereens. Above it, terrifying aftermath rippled. These ripples surged toward the finger in succession, swiftly weakening its power. Huge amounts of the Ancient God Power imbued in the finger dissipated in all directions.

By the time the finger truly came into contact with the sledgehammer, the former had already had its power reduced by ninety percent. However, the rest of the power had thoroughly exploded.

Following the massive explosion, a stifled groan came out of Xia Yong’s mouth. He was forced to take three steps backward in retreat, each step spanning a hundred miles.

“How is possible that I’m at a disadvantage?” Xia Yong appeared stunned.

He had unleashed all of his Holy Master might. In fact, he had even used his strongest secret skill.

Yet, he was still forced backward by Jian Wushuang’s second pointer and reduced into a state of disadvantage.

Just then, Jian Wushuang whose face was so warped that it was hard to tell it was him bellowed once again. He patted his chest, forced the Blood Essence out of his body. He gripped the Blood Essence firmly in his hand. With a pair of eyes that harbored an unprecedented level of madness, he once again pointed at Xia Yong.

“The Third Finger of the Ancient God: World-shattering!”

“Boom!” He abruptly triggered the boundless Ancient God Power.

The Third Finger of the Ancient God originated from the inheritance that Jian Wushuang awakened. It was something that he knew how to use the moment he awakened those memories but unfortunately, he was not equipped with the strength to unleash its true might.

Things were different now. Since engulfing the thirty percent of the Ancient God Power in the Blood Essence and reaching the Peak of the Four-star Level, he was able to unleash its full power, even if just barely.

Before the illusory figure of the Ancient God hovering in the empty space in the Void could fully dissipate, Jian Wushuang’s action caused the figure to begin solidifying again. This time, it became so solid that it appeared almost tangible.

Simultaneously, he had taken a step forward with his other feet. His feet had solidified into a tangible form.

There was only half of the illusory figure in the beginning, yet it was now complete!

The now-complete illusory figure now emanated an aura that was many times stronger than when Jian Wushuang made his second move.

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang’s hair was windswept as he let out a crazed roar.

His roar shocked the hearts and minds of every martial artist present. It was a kind of fear that struck deep into their souls.

Under everyone’s intense gaze, a shocking radiant light burst out of the eyes of the enormously tall illusory figure. Then, it once again pointed at Xia Yong.

This action immediately broke the barrier, extinguished the stars, and shattered the world.

This action harbored a shockingly terrifying might!

This action also carried Jian Wushuang’s unprecedented anger!

This action even contained his endless love for Leng Rushuang!

This was his anger toward the crown and his revenge for Leng Rushuang and his Senior Brother!

“Boom!”

The terrifying pointing motion surged madly to the sky, crushing everything that stood between heaven and earth.

A shocked expression crossed Xia Yong’s wizened face as he stood underneath the finger. “There’s an even stronger move from him?”

He was panicking.

This was the first time in the many years since he became a Holy Master that he felt fear.

That was merely the second finger earlier. Even though he managed to block it, he was nevertheless forced to use his full strength and eventually forced into a state of disadvantage.

The third finger was now several times stronger than the second.

Even though it was him, he could not help feeling as if he would be unable to block this attack.

Xia Yong snorted coldly, his gaze once again taking on a crazed quality.

“I don’t believe that an Eternal Realm dweller like you can really cause such trouble!”

“Come at me!”

Xia Yong’s expression turned exceptionally malevolent as he bellowed again and again. His terrifying Holy Master power was once again concentrated in his hand. The differing twin forces in his body climbed to a peak.

Xia Yong made his move.

He remained as domineering as ever as he swung his sledgehammer. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It was his strongest swing, containing his pride as a Holy Master expert and confidence in his strength.

This swing contained a strength that was capable of flattening the world.

The enormous golden finger that was capable of destroying the world and the sledgehammer that was capable of flattening the world hovered in the Void.

They collided!

“Buzz!” Strange aftermath ripples began spreading, continuously absorbing the power imbued in the finger. However, the golden finger effortlessly slammed through all obstacles and collided with the sledgehammer in a flash.

“Bam!”

The world seemed to crash around them.

“Kaboom!” The terrifying might formed a storm of power that emanated great pressure. Xia Yong stood under the storm of power with his eyes narrowed. His grey and long hair were billowed around him and his clothes were all tattered.

However, his gaze harbored a never-before-seen madness!

“This is impossible! Impossible!”

“I’m a Holy Master who is considered unparalleled in the Ancient World! How can I lose to an Eternal World dweller like you?”

“I refuse to believe it!”

Bellows of madness came out of Xia Yong’s mouth without ceasing. His face was now a terrifying shade of red.

The two forces madly collided wand suppressed each other. For a moment, there was no clear victory.

“Swoosh!” Just then, an enormous figure of red appeared next to Xia Yong and spoke in a cold yet unusually deep voice.

“You old little thing, did you forget about me?”
