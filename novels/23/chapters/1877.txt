“Too vast,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Compared to the vast Sword Principle that he felt before him, the Sword Principle that he had comprehended before was merely a drop in the ocean.

There was not only one Sword Principle contained in the sword tomb but various kinds.

Jian Wushuang could feel the Sword Principles very clearly. With slight guidance, he would be able to grasp them. In turn, his understanding of Sword Principle would improve tremendously.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang settled down very quickly and he started to comprehend the vast Sword Principle in the sword tomb wholeheartedly.

Not only him, but also Luo Xianzi and the other two Real Gods from Emperor Sword Sect that had Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens started comprehending too.

As for experts who didn’t have Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens, they couldn’t enter the sword tomb but they could only find a place to sit outside of the tomb. Although they couldn’t feel the vast Sword Principles in the sword tomb, it was far behind the few who had Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens.

The effect might not even be ten percent of Jian Wushuang’s and the other’s.

But even so, the experts weren’t willing to miss the chance.

Everyone seized the time and immersed themselves in comprehension.

Time flew past…

In the blink of an eye, thirty years passed.

Every time Emperor Sword Palace opened, it opened for a thousand years.

It had only been thirty years. It was a short time but Jian Wushuang opened his eyes again.

“Emperor Sword Palace deserved sword cultivators to be crazy about. I only comprehended here for thirty years and I have improved tremendously in my comprehension of Sword Principle. In one thousand years’ time, I’m afraid it is insufficient for my Sword Principle to reach a brand new level,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hand and his eyes were filled with excitement.

Although he was thrilled, Jian Wushuang was still suspicious.

After thirty years of comprehension, although the power that the sword tomb displayed was enough to surprise him, he felt that the sword tomb wasn’t as simple as it looked in its appearance.

It wasn’t just his gut feeling. It was also a conclusion that he had got from comprehension for thirty years in the sword tomb.

The sword tomb had boundless Sword Principle and sword intention. Although both Sword Principles and sword intentions were displayed perfectly, Jian Wushuang believed that Sword Emperor Dugu, who had built Emperor Sword Palace, would have more skills than this.

“What other mysteries are hidden in the sword tomb?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and stood up slowly.

Just as everyone was fully immersed in the comprehension of Sword Principles and sword intentions, he stood up and walked out of his cultivation platform.

In sword tomb, Jian Wushuang casually walked as he looked around.

With his naked eyes, he couldn’t see anything strange about the sword tomb. There were many swords in sword tomb that had been stabbed into the ground.

“If there is nothing strange about the sword then it should be the sword intention…” Jian Wushuang muttered.

His consciousness blended in the sword tomb and he started feeling the countless sword intentions.

He didn’t comprehend, only carefully studied.

It took a few years to study it.

“Mm…” Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes in shock, “These sword intentions are strange.”

Strange!

Jian Wushuang did find it strange.

The strangeness was from the sword intention itself but the direction that sword intention swept to.

The sword intention soared but Jian Wushuang could feel that the sword intention that had swept out was slanted in one direction.

Yes, slanted.

The slanting position was like it was intentionally drawing closer. If he were to describe it with a term…

“Worship!”

“Pilgrimage of Tens of Thousand Swords!!”

Jian Wushuang stared and he immediately felt every sword intention carefully.

In his senses, the tens of thousands of soaring sword intentions were worshipping one direction.

In the direction that the sword intention worshipped, Jian Wushuang came to a corner at the border of the sword tomb in the end. Then, there was a thick and heavy sword. Most importantly, the heavy sword was broken from the middle.

A broken sword!

The surface of the broken sword was blotted with rust. It felt as though it was a metal scrap.

However, Jian Wushuang could feel that the sword intentions of the tens of thousands of swords were faintly worshipping the broken sword. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In the entire sword tomb, only the broken sword had never let out any sword intention since the beginning.

“It seems that the broken sword is the true core of the sword tomb,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The sword wasn’t right in the middle of sword tomb but in a corner at the border that was least noticed. There wasn’t an aura or sword intention that was given out and the broken sword seemed to prevent the probing of soul power. Even when he covered the range with soul power, he couldn’t feel the existence of the broken sword.

“This broken sword, I wonder what kind of mystery it is carrying?”

Jian Wushuang was curious but he didn’t show it. Very soon, he returned to his cultivation platform and closed his eyes to continue comprehending.

As for Luo Xianzi and the others, they were comprehending with full concentration. No one noticed him.

Then, Jian Wushuang comprehension focused on the broken sword as his core.

His consciousness followed the guidance of the sword intention and fixed upon the broken sword.

At that moment, the ordinary broken sword with blotted rust made a drastic change in Jian Wushuang’s consciousness.

The blotted rust instantly disappeared.

The originally thick and heavy sword transformed into a one-meter-long sword in Jian Wushuang’s consciousness. It gave out faint golden lustre and on the surface of the blade, there was a dragon-shaped secret pattern. The dragon-shaped secret pattern wiggled slowly as though there was a real dragon that was sealed in the sword.

Besides, most importantly, there was a brand new sword intention soaring on the golden sword.

The sword intention was supreme!

It was like the king of the swords, like the sovereign that rules the world!

It was also like the ruler of heaven and earth. The sword intentions of the world took it as their focus.

In the sword tomb, the sword intention was like the true prince while the surrounding tens of thousands of sword intentions were like feudal officials that were worshipping and yielding to it.

It was the king of the swords!

Just as Jian Wushuang felt the sword intention, his heart quivered. In his head, there was suddenly an image.

In the image, there was a middle-aged man in a golden dragon royal robe and golden dragon crown. He was holding the golden sword as his Emperor aura swept out and he wielded the sword.
