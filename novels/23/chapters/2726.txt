Chapter 2727: Run!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The six of them had their eyes fixed on the stone coffins as the figure of a short-haired woman slowly rose from the stone coffin under their scrutiny.

The short-haired woman had dull and lifeless eyes. It was obviously a corpse puppet.

However, the short-haired woman’s body was filled with a faint golden light, unlike the other corpse puppets Jian Wushuang and the others had seen before.

“Did you see the golden light?” Devilish Wind King’s eyes widened.

“Gold-armored! It’s a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet!”

“A Gold-armored Corpse Puppet with two Silver-armored Corpse Puppets and two Bronze Armor Corpse next to it?”

Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Yi Shen were frightened.

“Run!”

Saber Master did not hesitate as he gave a command and moved at top speeds toward the opposite direction.

“Run, run!”

Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, Yi Shen, Devilish Wind King, and Jian Wushuang did not hesitate either.

The short-haired woman had dismissed their intention to fight.

Although the short-haired woman also wore an Interspatial Ring on her hand, they did not have the slightest intention to covet it.

It was no joke as a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was comparable to a Peak Ultimate God.

Fifty years ago, apart from Jian Wushuang, the five of them including Fo Yi did not know the combat power of a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and naively went ahead with the battle. It was fortunate that none of them were sacrificed even though the Saber Master was severely injured. After the painful experience, they no longer had the courage to carry on after seeing a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The six of them frantically ran.

The short-haired woman who walked out of the stone coffin was a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. She had hollow eyes while the corner of her mouth was slowly muttering a word—kill!

Boom!

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, two Silver-armored Corpse Puppets, and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets started frantically chasing after the six of them while moving at very fast speeds. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet had an exceptionally incredible speed.

Saber Master shouted on top of his lungs, “Spread out and run! Spread out and run!”

The six of them immediately spread in different directions.

While they were scattered all over the place, the five corpse puppets also went in separate directions.

The five corpse puppets had their targets.

A Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet was chasing behind Jian Wushuang.

“It’s okay. It’s just a Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and at the same time glanced around to check the others out.

He was shocked to find out something.

“The Devilish Wind King sure is unlucky!”

The rest also gave the Devilish Wind King pitiful looks.

The most terrifying Gold-armored Corpse Puppet that even Saber Master could not compete with—that short-haired woman was aiming at the Devilish Wind King.

“Shit! Shit!”

“There are so many of us. Why me?”

Devilish Wind King was cursing under his breath with a gloomy expression.

There were only five corpse puppets while there were six of them fleeing for their lives. Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen was the only one without a corpse puppet staring down or chasing him and seemed very relaxed.

The one chased after Saber Master was only a Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet which he could easily handle with his strength.

Who would have thought the most terrifying Gold-armored Corpse Puppet would not go for Saber Master or the two High-level Grand Ultimate Gods—Hong Chen and the Long Xianzi? It went for the Devilish Wind King instead.

It was not the Devilish Wind King’s lucky day.

“Apart from the unlucky Devilish Wind King, Yi Shen isn’t looking too good either,” mumbled Jian Wushuang.

He looked in the direction of Yi Shen who was also trying his best to flee while the one chasing after him was a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.

Although not comparable to the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet had the combat prowess of a Peak High-level Grand Ultimate God and Yi Shen might not be able to handle it in a one-on-one battle.

In other words, Jian Wushuang had the better luck among those three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods whereby he was only spotted by a Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet.

“This cemetery is extremely dangerous and the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet is even more terrifying. We’ll be targeted if we aren’t careful. Now that the six of us are scattered all over the place. Only Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen has the capacity to help Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen while none of the others can offer help at the moment. However, I’m afraid that Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen may not be willing to help at all,” murmured Jian Wushuang softly and shook his head.

“Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen! Both of you, take care.”

Jian Wushuang sighed and sped up.

As Jian Wushuang expected, Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen did not care about Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen even though there was no corpse puppet chasing behind him and continued to run following his path.

The six of them were scattered in different directions while moving very fast and would soon lose sight of each other.

Jian Wushuang was skimming forward swiftly in the void above the cemetery. His specialization at Space-time Law allowed him to be good with speed, hence he was not even moving at his top speed yet the corpse puppet behind him was already unable to get close.

“There are many corpse puppets in this cemetery, so I shouldn’t walk around alone. Otherwise, I may arouse more corpse puppets. I’d better get rid of this Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet as quickly as possible or...I can just kill it!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly as he noticed the Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet behind him happened to be the one wearing an Interspatial Ring.

“A Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet...”

Jian Wushuang glanced around the void. Saber Master, Devilish Wind, and the others were very far away from him and would not be able to see his show of power and method from afar.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang suddenly pulled to a stop in the void before turning around.

The Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet that was following him had no reasoning skill as it maintained its speed and attacked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang gave a cold smile.

Buzz!

A gush of majestic golden divine power surged behind Jian Wushuang before a huge and boundless 10,000-foot-tall Golden God Shadow was formed out of thin air.

Divine God of Punishment!

The 10,000-foot-tall Divine God of Punishment was the third level of Divine God of Punishment.

It was very different compared with previous levels of Divine God of Punishment.

Those previous ones were just a shadow while the 10,000-foot-tall Golden God Shadow had completely solidified with its surface covered in a layer of bright golden armor!

The magnificent Golden God Shadow was wearing golden armor and had transformed into a true Golden Emperor!

The Golden Emperor stood behind Jian Wushuang with its sharp eyes bore into all things beneath it!
