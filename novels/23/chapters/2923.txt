Chapter 2924: Escape

——

His parents in this life, his elder sister, second brother, and the people closest to him would be implicated.

Jian Wushuang had to ask them to leave as soon as possible.

But now, he did not know where he was. So there was only one way to take Zhuo Yunfeng and the others away.

Jian Wushuang took out a message token. It was the first time he had taken it out since he got it.

“Miss Xiao Er, there’s something I need your help with.” Jian Wushuang had already sent the message.

…

In the witch desert region, under the command of the Beiming Star Field in the Pill Sun Sacred World.

It was the 12th month, and the snow-covered the entire Burning Moon City with a layer of silver clothing.

In the courtyard in the center of the City Lord’s mansion, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin stood together.

“Darling, do you remember when I was pregnant with Shuang Er?” Luo Xinqin asked.

“Of course I remember.” Zhuo Yunfeng smiled. “Shuang Er is a child with extraordinary talent. He stayed in your arms for nine years, nine months, and nine days, and it snowed in Burning Moon City for nine years, nine months, and nine days. Strangely, the snow stopped on the day Shuang Er was born, and the sky cleared in an instant!”

“I wonder how this child is doing outside now?” Luo Xinqin asked.

“I don’t know, but with his talent and speed of improvement, his strength is probably many times stronger than before. He might have already reached the peak of the reverent-god realm. His achievements are not what we can imagine,” Zhuo Yunfeng said with a smile.

“Yes.” Luo Xinqin sighed softly.

But at this moment…

Weng!

A figure appeared in the sky above the burning Moon City’s City Lord’s mansion without warning.

This figure wore a simple gray robe and a gray mask. As soon as he appeared, a majestic aura immediately enveloped him.

“Zhuo Yunfeng, Luo Xinqin!”

A cold voice sounded both inside and outside the City Lord’s mansion.

The entire City Lord’s residence instantly erupted into a clamor. The many cultivators in the residence looked up at the gray-robed masked figure with endless terror.

Even the two god-fiend realm experts sent by the Great Tragedy Sect to secretly protect Zhuo Yunfeng and his wife were highly shocked at this moment.

“Greetings, milord. May I know why milord has come to my Burning Moon City?” Zhuo Yunfeng immediately stood up and said respectfully.

“You are Zhuo Yunfeng? Is that your wife, Luo Xinqin, beside you?” The gray-robed masked figure asked.

“Yes.” Zhuo Yunfeng nodded subconsciously.

“If that’s the case, then there’s no mistake. Come with me.” The gray-robed masked figure waved his hand, and immediately, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin lost the ability to resist. Instead, they were directly driven by the gray-robed masked figure to rush towards the surrounding void. Soon, they disappeared from the world. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was not until the three of them left that the governor’s mansion exploded.

The two divine devil realm experts who were secretly protecting Zhuo Yunfeng and his wife were shocked.

When Jian Wushuang left, he had reached an agreement with the Great Tragedy Sect. Before Jian Wushuang returned, the Great Tragedy Sect would do their best to ensure the safety of his parents. But now, Jian Wushuang’s parents were in the governor’s mansion of Burning Moon City, had they been taken away?

If Jian Wushuang did not see his parents when he came back, would he not be furious?

“Quick, report this to the Sect Master.”

The two divine demon realm experts of the Great Tragedy Sect immediately sent a message.

In a remote void in the witch desert region, the gray-robed masked figure suddenly stopped. Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were floating beside him.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were also a little frightened.

“My Lord, why did you bring us here?” Zhuo Yunfeng could not help asking.

“Do you two have a son named Jian Yi?” The gray-robed masked man looked over.

“Jian Yi? No, I only have two sons. One is Zhuo Peng, and the other is Jian Wushuang. There is no one named Jian Yi,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Jian Wushuang?” The gray-robed masked man’s expression changed. He flipped his hand and took out a portrait. “Is it the person in the portrait?”

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin glanced at the person in the portrait. They immediately recognized that it was Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, it’s him. The person in the portrait is my Shuang Er,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“That’s right. You two wait here,” the gray-robed masked man said coldly, but he did not explain much.

Not long after.

“They’re here.” The gray-robed masked man suddenly raised his head.

He saw two figures rushing over from the void not far away.

One of the two people was also wearing a simple gray robe and a mask. As for the other person, it was Zhuo Bing!

“Bing Er.” Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were both shocked when they saw Zhuo Bing.

“Father, mother, you’re here too?” Zhuo Bing was also extremely surprised.

She was clearly still cultivating in the ancient star hall just now, but a gray-robed masked man directly barged in and brought her here with effective means.

The experts in her Ancient Star Hall, including the strongest Divine Master, did not even have the slightest chance to struggle.

Not long after Zhuo Bing arrived, Zhuo Peng also arrived. He was also brought here by a gray-robed masked man.

Since then, the four people closest to Jian Wushuang had all gathered.

“Everyone is here. Let’s hurry up and leave this world.”

The three gray-robed masked men reached an agreement. Then, they immediately left with Zhuo Yunfeng, Zhuo Bing, and Zhuo Peng.

…

Within the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the white-robed bald man and the will of the Heavenly Dao worked together. In merely two hours, an enormous teleportation channel had already appeared in the sky. This spatial channel was enormous and boundless. After it was constructed entirely… only then did the will of the Heavenly Dao completely dissipate.

Soon after, numerous figures began to stride over from the other end of the spatial channel.

A large number of figures appeared in the air the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. There were over a hundred of them.

However, terrifying was that the aura of each and every one of these people was exceptionally tyrannical. Any one of them was sufficient to cause the experts and disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to tremble in fear. Just like the Immortal Saints of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion… at this moment, all of them lowered their heads in fear.

These people were all experts at the level of the Immortal Saints. In addition, there were ten figures at the very front of the crowd. Their auras were towering and far surpassed the Immortal Saints.

Those ten people were actually the ten supreme Masters of Laws.

However, regardless of whether it was the Immortal Saints or the ten Masters of Laws, they were all unable to conceal the existence of the white-robed bald man at the very front of the crowd.

What the white-robed bald man had arrived at this moment was not his consciousness but his true body!
