All of a sudden, the entire great hall of Cosmos God was filled with the sound of ‘agreement’. The word ‘fight to the death’ shot up to the heavens and shook the Nine Continents!

Thank you readers!

Cosmos God took a deep breath and looked at the Supremes in the hall. He nodded slightly in his heart.

As long as the morale was still there, all obstacles were just waiting for them.

“I’ll fight force with force, and accompany you to the end.”

An Invincible Supreme expert said, his eyes surging with battle intent.

!!

“That’s right, if you want to fight, then fight. At most, you’ll die!”

“As cultivators, why should we hesitate to fight?”

“When the Yin and Yang are in chaos, I will dye the sky with my divine blood!”

The other Invincible Supremes also spoke out.

To be able to cultivate to this realm, which one of them was not a Dragon or Phoenix among men, an existence that ruled over all ages?

Life and death had long been disregarded by them. From the moment they stepped into the Offworld Battleground, they did not even care about their own lives.

Only the Dragon, Phoenix, and Qilin races remained silent and avoided the gaze of Cosmos God.

Cosmos God could only pretend not to see this.

“Alright, everyone. In that case, all of you should go back and recuperate and prepare yourselves while waiting for the great battle to begin.”

The eyes of Cosmos God flickered as he spoke in a deep voice.

In this battle, the people from the Void Universe suffered heavy injuries, but the people from the Divine Power Universe were also injured. They had to make full use of their time and maintain their peak condition.

“Yes.”

The crowd dispersed, and the hall returned to silence.

Cosmos God’s straight back relaxed and he sighed softly. He no longer concealed the fatigue between his brows.

He had been far, far too tired after defending for 100,000 chaos cycles.

Rubbing the space between his brows, Cosmos God turned to Lan Lan and said, “Little Lan, go to the depths of the universe again on my behalf and summon all the Invincible Supremes who are still in the depths of the universe to the Offworld Battlefield.”

“Alright.” Lan Lan did not waste any time. After nodding in agreement, she walked out of the hall, released a Cosmic Boat, and shot into the depths of the universe.

After Lan Lan left, only Cosmos God and Lan Su were left in the great hall.

“Master, if all of the Invincible Supremes are transferred here, I’m afraid that without the suppression of the Invincible Supremes in the depths of the universe, there will inevitably be people who will take advantage of this opportunity to wreak havoc in the world.”

Lan Su said worriedly.

Hearing this, Cosmos God frowned and glanced at Lan Su. “Desperate times call for desperate measures. At this point, if we can’t hold this battle, the entire Divine Power Universe will be destroyed. There’s no need to worry about anything else.”

Pausing for a moment, Cosmos God continued, “If anyone dares to cause trouble at this time and we lose this battle, naturally we can forget about this. If we win, this old man will go and settle the score.”

“Yes, I understand.” Lan Su nodded in a daze.

“Yes, you can leave too. Let me be alone.”

Cosmos God waved his hand and dismissed Lan Su. He first looked down at the torn sleeve on his right hand, then looked up at the sky. His gaze seemed to penetrate the roof of the hall and looked at the endless starry sky. He sighed softly.

The thing that made his heart sink the most happened because he could no longer suppress Void God after the battle.

“I have to let the others grow up quickly.”

Reining in his thoughts, the eyes of Cosmos God flashed with a look of Enlightenment.

…

At the same time, in the depths of the starry sky.

A giant black turtle the size of an entire star field was swimming back and forth.

Some space pirates and cultivators who were passing by were shocked when they saw the giant turtle. They quickly moved away and did not dare to block the way.

“This… this is a f*cking turtle?”

“This turtle head is bigger than a planet!”

“Let’s go, let’s go! It must be some old monster!”

The cultivators and space pirates all exclaimed in amazement.

On the turtle’s back, no one could hear the excited screams of a young girl.

“Wow wow wow, Master, so this is the depths of the universe?”

“This is too beautiful!”

“Wow! Aohou! Aowu!”

The young girl was none other than the young girl who had met Jian Wushuang once at the Southern Ocean island.

During this period of time, she traveled the entire universe with Fengtian Patriarch and finally arrived at the depths of the universe, which was also the most prosperous area in the universe.

Chu Zhi’s eyes glowed as she looked at the countless galaxies orbiting in front of her. Countless galaxies were drawn horizontally, and countless races were shuttling back and forth in the universe.

In the past, when she was at the Southern Ocean Immortal Island, the starry sky she saw was only so big. She thought that the starry sky was really only so big. It was only at this moment that she realized that the starry sky in the universe was so bright and beautiful. It was a beauty that she had never imagined.

“Calm down, calm down… Chu Zhi! Calm down!”

Just as Chu Zhi was making a big fuss, her head suddenly exploded. She could not help but hold her head in pain and grimace.

“Master, why did you hit me?”

The child opened its big bright eyes and looked at Patriarch Fengtian with a wronged expression.

“Don’t act like you’re being wronged.”

Fengtian Patriarch blew at his beard and glared at the girl. He then said with a look of disdain.

“My dear disciple, your Master, I, am a respected figure in the universe. You’ve made yourself look like you’ve never seen the world before. It’s embarrassing for your Master.”

...

“Oh…”

Chu Yang’s ‘oh’ was dragged out, making the meaning of the ‘Oh’ sound a little awkward.

“Master, I haven’t seen anyone greet you along the way. They’re all very respectful.” Chu Zhi mumbled softly.

“What are you saying?”

Upon hearing this, Fengtian Patriarch was instantly infuriated. He snorted coldly and said, “When I dominated the universe back then, the depths of the universe were still in chaos. It’s normal for these little guys to not recognize me.”

When Chu Zhi heard this, she could not help but stick out her tongue playfully.

“Alright, I can’t be bothered to talk to you about this.”

After a pause, the expression of the Fengtian Patriarch gradually became solemn. He said in a deep voice, “Disciple, I’m leaving.”

“Leaving?”

Chu Zhi was stunned when she heard this, but her eyes immediately lit up with excitement as she nodded with a smile, “Sure, when are we leaving?”

Fengtian Patriarch took a deep breath and shook his head. “Disciple, it’s not us. I’m the one who will be leaving, alone.”

“Huh?” Chu Zhi was stunned when she heard this, and her face revealed a confused expression.

Ever since she was an infant and had learned how to speak, she had been by the side of the Fengtian Patriarch.

She had never thought that her Master would leave her one day.

She did not know why, but she suddenly felt as if all her strength had been sucked out of her. Her feet became lighter and heavier, as if she was stepping on clouds. It also felt as if a large stone was blocking her chest, causing her breathing to become somewhat sluggish.
