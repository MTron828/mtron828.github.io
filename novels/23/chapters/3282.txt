“Silver Wolf, before you entered the Blood Wave Temple, you didn’t even dare to show your face in front of the Heavenly Sword Marquis for fear of being targeted and killed by him. You’re not as good as the Nine Temples Saintess. Now that you’ve come out of the Blood Wave Temple and saw that the Heavenly Sword Marquis hasn’t broken through to become Principles Masters, you’ve become arrogant?

“What a joke.” Underworld Emperor looked at Silver Wolf, his face was full of mockery.

Upon hearing Underworld Emperor’s words, Silver Wolf’s face suddenly changed.

Before entering the Blood Wave Temple, not only him, but all the experts of the three Saint Realms in the Blood Wave Realm were extremely afraid of Jian Wushuang. No one dared to show their faces in front of Jian Wushuang.

Even outside the Blood Wave Temple, Silver Wolf had waited until Jian Wushuang had entered the Blood Wave Temple to fight for the last Blood Wave Token. Everyone knew this, but now, Emperor Ming had said it in front of everyone, which made Silver Wolf feel embarrassed.

“Humph, what a joke. Why should I be afraid of him?” Silver Wolf snorted.

“You know very well whether I’m afraid or not.” Emperor Ming sneered. He wanted to say something, but Jian Wushuang, who had been standing silently by the side, stopped him with a wave of his hand.

“Silver Wolf,” Jian Wushuang opened his mouth and looked over. “Congratulations on breaking through to become a Principles Master.”

“Eh?” Silver Wolf was shocked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He did not expect Jian Wushuang to congratulate him first?

They did not have any friendship, only a great enmity. Such a congratulations would not be good.

Sure enough, Jian Wushuang continued, “It’s said that the supreme Principles Master is far more powerful than the Immortal Saint. Now that you’ve broken through, your strength must be much stronger than before, right?”

“Nonsense. The Principles Master and the Immortal Saint are two completely different levels. Of course, the gap is huge,” Silver Wolf said before asking, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, what are you trying to say?”

“Nothing. I’m just curious how much stronger you are now that you’ve become a Principles Master. That’s why I want to fight you head-on,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

His words were extremely calm. However, as soon as he said that, the entire void instantly quieted down.

Many people looked at Jian Wushuang with astonishment and astonishment.

Although Jian Wushuang was the focus of everyone’s attention previously, they only looked at him with surprise and disdain because he had not broken through. But now, they looked at him as if he was...as if they were looking at a fool.

Yes, they were looking at a fool.

After all, although the Immortal Saint was only one step away from the Principles Master, the difference was like the difference between heaven and earth. After all, the power of the Principles Master’s will was too strong, it was almost impossible for the Immortal Saint to make up for it.

In the history of the Divine Beginning Realm, there had been countless talented experts, many of whom were enough to shock the world. Similarly, there were also many who were able to cross ranks to challenge the Principles Master, however, they were only at the level of a True Saint. It was impossible for a True Saint to challenge a Principles Master.

At least in the history of the Divine Beginning Realm, there had never been an Immortal Saint who could defeat a Principles Master. It was impossible for him to even fight a Principles Master head-on.

Jian Wushuang knew this, but he still took the initiative to challenge Silver Wolf. Was he not a fool?

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what did you just say?” Silver Wolf looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange smile.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” Emperor Ming and Di Hao also looked over, among them, Emperor Ming said directly, “Brother Heavenly Marquis, you don’t have to pay attention to him. At most, you can let him be proud for a while. If he dares to be presumptuous again, I, Brother Geng Hao, will help you teach him a good lesson.”

Di Hao also nodded slightly.

Apparently, both of them thought that Jian Wushuang was a little impulsive to take the initiative to challenge the Principles Master.

After all, they were both Principles Masters now and knew how powerful the Principles Master was.

However, after hearing the Underworld Emperor’s words, Jian Wushuang just shook his head and smiled. “It doesn’t matter. Since I dare to take the initiative to challenge him, I naturally have a certain degree of confidence. You two just watch in peace.”

Underworld Emperor and Di Hao looked at each other. Although they were still frowning, since Jian Wushuang had said so, they would not stop him. Moreover, they knew how strong Jian Wushuang’s life-saving ability was, after breaking through to Principles Master, Silver Wolf might be able to crush Jian Wushuang, but it was almost impossible to kill him.

Therefore, they could rest assured that Jian Wushuang would make a move.

At this moment, the smile on Silver Wolf’s face grew wider, and a trace of killing intent emerged from the bottom of his heart.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis and the three Saint Realms have been at each other’s throats for a long time. The highest-level officials of the three Saint Realms all want to kill him, but they have been unable to kill him in the Blood Wave Realm, but that was before...”

“Before, the battle strength in the Blood Wave Realm was only at the Saint Realm, so any battle strength above the Principles Master level would be limited. But now, we Principles Masters who have made a breakthrough in the Blood Wave Realm are not limited in strength at all. With my current strength, I have a chance to kill Heavenly Sword Marquis with all my strength.”

“Of course, the premise is that he doesn’t use space-time teleportation and Emperor Ming and Di Hao don’t help him.” Silver Wolf narrowed his eyes.

He believed that he now had the battle strength to kill Jian Wushuang, but he did not want to kill Jian Wushuang in the beginning because Jian Wushuang’s life-saving ability was too strong, in addition, Emperor Geng and Emperor Hao were obviously on Jian Wushuang’s side.

However, it was different now because Jian Wushuang had taken the initiative to challenge him, which gave him a chance to fight Jian Wushuang face-to-face. Moreover, Jian Wushuang would never choose to use space-time teleportation to escape in the beginning, this gave him a perfect opportunity to kill Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang’s divine power was vast and his chances of success were slim, what if he succeeded?

“Although I’m one of the top geniuses in the Life and Death Saint Realm and have reached the Principles Master Realm, I still can’t enter the highest level of the Life and Death Saint Realm. However, the highest level of the Life and Death Saint Realm values Heavenly Sword Marquis so much that even the Saint Master has been paying attention to him.. If I can kill Heavenly Sword Marquis again, it will definitely bring me closer to the highest level, and I might even be favored by the Saint Master!” Silver Wolf clenched his hands, at the thought of this, his heart became incomparably excited.
