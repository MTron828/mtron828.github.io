Chapter 4109: Greeting Gift

“So many Supreme-beings?” Jian Wushuang was secretly amazed.

Supreme-beings were the pinnacle existences in the universe. Even in the depths of the universe, it was very difficult to meet one. But now, in the Life Palace, there were more than ten Supreme-beings gathered in front of him.

Moreover, these ten Supreme-beings were staring at him. It was obvious that they were here because of him.

“Jian Wushuang, come here.” Blood Wave waved at Jian Wushuang.

“Senior Blood Wave.” Jian Wushuang immediately came to Blood Wave’s side.

“Let me introduce you. This person beside me is Giant Axe. Like me, he is also one of the first Supreme-beings in the Life Palace,” Blood Wave said.

There were five Chief Supremes in the Life Palace, all of whom were Supreme-beings.

Since Giant Axe was also a Chief Supremes, he was naturally a powerful Supreme-being who could establish his own divine kingdom.

“Greetings, Giant Axe Supreme-being.” Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully.

“Third-level Ruler?” Giant Axe Supreme-being looked down at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, how long have you been cultivating?”

“More than 300,000 years,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Only more than 300,000 years?” The Giant Axe Ruler could not help but be surprised.

The experts from the Life Palace were also shocked to hear this.

300,000 years was too short for everyone present.

It was known that it took an extremely long time for an ordinary cultivator to grow from birth to the Ruler level.

Unless a cultivator with a heaven-reaching background could save a lot of time by cultivating with a large amount of resources. However, even under such circumstances, it only took him 300,000 years to reach the third level of the Ruler level, it was still very impressive.

However, Jian Wushuang did not have a heaven-reaching background. He just relied on himself to slowly cultivate at the edge of the universe. Most importantly, he was a cultivator with a perfect life…it must be known that a cultivator with a perfect life level…breaking through the bottleneck was many times more difficult than ordinary cultivators.

It was incredible that he could reach this level in about 300,000 years.

“Haha, it seems that my Life Palace will soon have another Supreme expert.”

Supreme Giant Axe laughed. Suddenly, he flipped his hand and a crystal-clear fruit appeared in his hand. He took the fruit to Jian Wushuang, “I’m one of the chief supremacies of the Life Palace. It’s rare to see another perfect life form with great potential in the Life Palace. I have to show you something. Take this middle-grade principle divine fruit as my welcome gift.”

“Welcome gift?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and hesitated.

“Take it. You can use this principle divine fruit,” Blood Wave said with a smile.

“Thank you, Supreme Giant Axe.” Jian Wushuang accepted the crystal fruit without hesitation.

Jian Wushuang immediately sensed an extraordinary power of universe principles from the crystal fruit.

“Although this fruit is common among the many divine fruits in the universe, it has the most extensive use. A divine fruit of universe principles contains an extremely rich power of universe principles. Under normal circumstances, if a Ruler can eat an ordinary low-grade divine fruit of universe principles, he has the hope of comprehending a trace of universe principles,” Blood Wave said, “Jian Wushuang, have you comprehended any universal principles yet?”

“I’ve already comprehended some of the universal principles,” Jian Wushuang said, but he did not mention that his comprehension of the universal principles had reached a certain level.

“Oh?” Ruler Blood Wave’s eyes lit up. “You’ve only reached the third-level Ruler level, but you’ve already comprehended a trace of the universal principles. Your comprehension is extraordinary.”

“Not bad at all.” Supreme Giant Axe nodded with a smile. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Since you have already comprehended a hint of the principles of the universe, this fruit will be of even greater use to you. After all, those who haven’t comprehended any of the principles of the universe might have a chance of comprehending a hint of the principles by devouring the fruit, but that chance is far too low. If you have already comprehended a hint of the principles of the universe, after devouring the fruit, your comprehension of the principles of the universe will increase dramatically in the next year.”

“This is only a low-grade principle divine fruit. The middle-grade principle divine fruit that Giant Axe just gave you can be sold for 500,000 universe origin stones in the universe. If you swallow this middle-grade principle divine fruit, your comprehension of the universe principles will greatly increase in the next ten years,” Blood Wave said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang was immediately delighted.

The mid-grade principle divine fruit was worth 500,000 origin stones. It would be useful even for an ordinary Supreme expert, but it would definitely be more useful for him.

“Of course, although the mid-grade principle divine fruit is very useful to you, don’t eat it in a hurry. After all, there is only one fruit. You can wait for an opportunity. For example, if you have a special encounter, you can eat it with half the effort,” Blood Wave said.

“I understand.”Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“Well, I’ve given you the gift. Cultivate well, and I’ll leave now.” Giant Axe Supreme said.

“Thank you, Giant Axe Supreme.” Jian Wushuang thanked him again.

Giant Axe Supreme waved his hand and left.

After Giant Axe Supreme left…

“Gu Yi,” Blood Wave suddenly said.

“Ruler Blood Wave.” A Supreme immediately came forward.

“This little guy just came to the Life Palace and hasn’t been baptized by the Life Nirvana Pool. You’ve been in charge of this pool for a long time. Tell me, when will the next Life Nirvana Pool open?” Blood Wave asked.

“Normally, the Life Nirvana Pool will only open once every million years. However, Jian Wushuang is a perfect life, and he has only cultivated for about 300,000 years. There’s no need to wait so long. How about this? I’ll go back and make some preparations. In 20 years, the Life Nirvana Pool will open,” Supreme Gu Yi said.

“Okay.” Blood Wave nodded.

“Jian Wushuang, come with me. I’ll take you to the palace to find a place to live.” Blood Wave flew up with Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang and Blood Wave left, the experts of the Life Palace who were strong in the Purple Temple began to discuss among themselves.

“The treatment of a perfect life is really different. Not only does Ruler Blood Wave receive him personally, but he also brings him here for a life test, and he even brings him to find a place to live.”

“Not only that, didn’t you see Supreme Giant Axe give him a welcome gift just now?”

“I dare say that if it had been a manifestation-level creature, even a peak manifestation-level creature, Supreme Giant Axe wouldn’t have given him a mid-grade principle-god fruit as a welcome gift.”

“A mid-grade principle-god fruit? That’s quite a valuable treasure for an ordinary Ruler, isn’t it?”
