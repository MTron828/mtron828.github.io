Chapter 1434: Massacre

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body and mind hovered like a ghost.

“What?”

“Sword?”

The bearded middle-aged man, Universe God Zhu Xin, and the others were shocked.

When they saw Jian Wushuang’s techniques, they determined that Jian Wushuang was an expert with a terrifying consciousness attack. But then, Jian Wushuang plunged forward with his sword.

“Be careful!” The bearded middle-aged man suddenly roared.

Jian Wushuang’s ghostly figure had already appeared before the Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven who stood closest to him. Then, Blood Mountain Sword was wielded silently.

“So fast!” The Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven was shocked. He quickly blocked with a longspear.

Hua!

The sword light fell down in silence.

The swing wasn’t of a high level but Jian Wushuang performed it perfectly with his divine power. Most importantly, the swing contained a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation.

Even though it was just a bit, it was the supreme Power of Heaven Way after all. That instant, the power of the sword increased by countless orders of magnitude.

Dang!

A low clashing noise was heard and the longspear flew off while the swordlight continued to slash the body of the Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven without diminishing force.

The Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven couldn’t resist any further and was killed directly.

“Third!”

“Bastard!”

The bearded middle-aged man and the others were caught by surprise.

“You killed our third, you have to die too!” The bearded middle-aged man bellowed.

Just as Jian Wushuang was wielding his sword like the ‘Third’, the bearded middle-aged man, Universe God Zhu Xin, and the others launched their attack at Jian Wushuang.

A few fierce strokes of force were charging at Jian Wushuang from all directions. At such a close distance, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be able to resist.

Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!

There were noises of metal collision. The forces that the bearded middle-aged man and the few others made hit Jian Wushuang’s body directly. For instance, the bearded middle-aged man’s ax hit Jian Wushuang’s head, but Jian Wushuang was covered by a layer of crimson armor. The attacks were weakened by the crimson armor before it transmitted through Jian Wushuang’s divine body. It didn’t manage to affect Jian Wushuang at all.

Jian Wushuang continued to wield his sword.

“Xie Yue!”

The cold sword technique was a unique skill that Jian Wushuang had created through the years he comprehended the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation. It was a Peak rank three unique skill.

The sword light approached at an unbelievably fast speed.

“How is this possible?”

The bearded middle-aged man stared while the cold swordlight continued to magnify in his eyes.

Psst!

The swordlight pierced through the bearded middle-aged man’s skull and instantly killed him.

That scene frightened the few other bandits.

“Run!”

“Hurry up and run for your lives!”

Without hesitation, the few bandits started running.

With a short exchange of blows, Jian Wushuang’s power had made them terrified.

They knew clearly that Jian Wushuang could easily kill them all.

So, they could only run for their lives.

Looking at the bandits running away, Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold and aimed at Universe God Zhu Xin immediately. He then chased after him.

“Run, run!”

Universe God Zhu Xi had terror plastered across his face. As he ran, he muttered continuously, “Too strong, too scary!”

“An extremely strong consciousness attack. Just a few techniques and he almost wiped out all Universe Gods below the level of Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. His swordsmanship is even scarier. Just a casual swing, but both the eldest and the third couldn’t resist it. The scariest part is his defense power. We are four Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven and an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven, our full blows didn’t affect him at all. Even if he’s a Real God, his defense power shouldn’t be so strong, right?”

“Universe God ranking list, yes, he definitely has the fighting power of an expert on the Universe God ranking list. But why isn’t he there on the Universe God ranking list?”

The bandits living in the boundless void had a certain level of understanding towards experts on the Universe God ranking list. They were certain that Jian Wushuang wasn’t on the list but the power he used wasn’t any weaker than the experts on the Universe God ranking list.

“He’s another hidden, infamous monster!” Universe God Zhu Xin clenched his fists.

Just then…

“Are you still thinking of running away?”

He heard a cold voice. He then saw a huge, blazing quicksand flowing towards him from the nearby void. Suddenly, Universe God Zhu Xin was covered by it.

Along with the tremendous increase in Jian Wushuang’s power, the blaze quicksand region naturally expanded too.

Universe God Zhu Xin, a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, drowned in the eruption of blazing quicksand and his speed was weakened by half!

But Jian Wushuang appeared behind Universe God Zhu Xin in an instant.

“No!” Universe God Zhu Xin let out a shrill scream.

Jian Wushuang slashed and it was like how he had killed Xie Yue. The slash had carried a slight of Power of Reincarnation, but it oppressed Universe God Zhu Xin entirely. With one slash, Universe God Zhu Xin became a cold, dead body. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The first target, eliminated!”

Jian Wushuang overlooked Universe God Zhu Xin’s body but his gaze was cold and without pity.

As for the few bandits that had run away, Jian Wushuang didn’t go after them.

“Come here.” Jian Wushuang sent a message to the man in black who was waiting outside Ancient Moon Island.

The man in black quickly arrived at Ancient Moon Island.

The moment he arrived at Ancient Moon Island, he looked at the dead bodies all over and his face grew grave.

He thought Jian Wushuang barging into Ancient Moon Island openly was an act of overrating his ability, but then…

“He lives up to his name as a disciple of Star Palace from Lineage of Star. His power is impressive. I wonder how far away is he from the Universe God ranking list?” The man in black thought to himself.

“This is the dead body of Universe God Zhu Xin, am I right?” Jian Wushuang threw Universe God Zhu Xin’s body before the man in black.

The man in black looked for a while and nodded, “Yes.”

“Alright, let’s go to the second target then,” Jian Wushuang spoke.

“Yes,” the man in black nodded.

Jian Wushuang and the man in black departed again after a simple clean up.

The rest of the time, Jian Wushuang found one target after another under the lead of the man in black. Then, Jian Wushuang had used the thunder trick to kill them. With Jian Wushuang’s power, as long as he didn’t come across any Real Gods, he could run wild in the boundless void.

He had read through the eleven targets in his tasks long ago. They weren’t hard to deal with.

Jian Wushuang wiped out everyone and carried out massacres. In thirty years, he finished his first part of the task, which was to kill all eleven targets.

Plus, in the thirty years, most of the time was spent simply travelling in the boundless void, while hardly any time was used for the actual executions.
