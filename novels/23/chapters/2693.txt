Chapter 2694: Alliance

Jian Wushuang and Gu Mo had hidden agendas of their own. However, they had not truly fallen out so they greeted each other during their first meeting.

“Alliance Master Su Han, please come in.” Gu Mo led Jian Wushuang walking towards the insides of the Corpse Palace and soon arrived in a big hall.

This was a glorious and splendor hall with tables placed on both sides and almost 100 moving beauties dancing in the middle of the hall.

The dancing beauties did not stop after Jian Wushuang and Gu Mo entered the hall. However, a long-robed middle-aged man and a green-clothed lady stood up from behind the tables on both sides.

“Alliance Master Su Han,” said the long-robed middle-aged man.

“Greetings to you, Alliance Master Su Han.” The green-clothed lady looked rather humble.

“Oh, both Master Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master are also here?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the both of them without any signs of surprise.

He knew this would be an extraordinary dinner. Apart from the Corpse Palace—Divine Dragon Gang and the Purple Dress House would come forward.

“The two of us will not turn down a personal invitation from Palace Master Gu Mo,” said the green-clothed lady—Purple Dress House Master.

“Haha... Everybody, take your seats.” Gu Mo also sat down in front of the table at the highest point as he waved his hand and smiled loudly.

Jian Wushuang and two others quickly found their respective places and sat down.

“It’s been such an honor that all three of you can gather at my Corpse Palace today. Come, let me call out a toast in your honor,” said Gu Mo with a smile as he raised the glass in his hand.

Jian Wushuang, Sheng Long, and the Purple Dress House Master also raised their glasses to drink together.

Gu Mo wiped the edge of his mouth after finishing his glass of wine and started to speak seriously. “Honorable guests, I’ve invited the three of you to this dinner tonight for one reason only.”

Jian Wushuang, Sheng Long, and the Purple Dress House Master immediately turned to look at Gu Mo.

‘I really want to see what this Gu Mo wants to do?’ Jian Wushuang smiled coldly in secret.

“Honorable guests, all of you know that the Danyang Continent is huge with many forces, powerful organizations, and clans on this piece of land. If we put aside the top five peak organizations, there are already many first and second-rated forces on the Danyang Continent. As for third-rated forces like ours—there are as many as the stars in the sky,” said Gu Mo loudly.

Jian Wushuang’s facial expression did not change.

However, Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master frowned.

They previously went looking for Gu Mo so that Gu Mo would hold that dinner in hopes of resolving issues with the Sword Alliance.

They wanted to investigate if there was really a powerful clan supporting the Sword Alliance and the Alliance Master’s intentions.

However, Gu Mo mentioned the situation in the Danyang Continent as soon as he opened his mouth. That caused Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master to feel slightly odd.

On the other hand, Gu Mo continued, “The situation of the Danyang Continent is too complex with extremely crazed fights between the forces. Third-rated forces like Corpse Palace, Sword Alliance, Divine Dragon Gang, and Purple Dress House are like lonely kayaks when caught in such crazy fights. We’re so vulnerable that we’ll be wiped out and taken over by others at any minute. I believe all of you have the same thoughts as I have.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Mo looked over at the trio sitting beneath him with a smile on his face.

Jian Wushuang only gave an indifferent smile as a response.

However, the facial expression of Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master had completely changed.

They could recognize there was some hidden meaning in Gu Mo’s words and matters were not going as per what they initially agreed.

“Palace Master Gu Mo, what are you trying to say?” Sheng Long asked in his deep voice.

“Haha... What I want to say is very simple. All four third-rated forces—Corpse Palace, Sword Alliance, Divine Dragon Gang, and Purple Dress House—are located in the same area. We are pitifully weak if we remain alone as none of us will be able to fight if we meet any second-rated forces or a really powerful expert. However, if all four of us unite like strings twisted into a piece of rope, even the strongest second-rated force could not easily take action against us. Won’t that be nice as our opportunity of surviving in this Danyang Continent would increase?” Gu Mo said with a smile.

“Strings twisted into a piece of rope? I wonder how Palace Master Gu Mo plans to do this?” Sheng Leong asked.

“An alliance. The four of us should unite and form a new alliance,” replied Gu Mo.

“Alliance? What you mean to say is a merger, right?” Sheng Long’s eyes grew cold.

“You can say that too.” Gu Mo nodded gleefully.

The faces of Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master completely darkened after hearing that.

They had finally understood that the real purpose of Gu Mo’s dinner was not to take action towards the Sword Alliance.

Uniting them was just an excuse as Gu Mo’s true aim was to take over these three forces.

Focusing their aim at the Sword Alliance and investigating the origins of the Sword Alliance was just an excuse to gather them in the Corpse Palace.

After all, Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master would not join any of Gu Mo’s dinner at the Corpse Palace under normal circumstances.

However, Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master were the ones that proactively sought the Corpse Palace out this time...

“Palace Master Gu Mo, we’re invited here to resolve the matter where the Sword Alliance recently destroyed both the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang. My Purple Dress House is not interested in the alliance that you mentioned,” said the Purple Dress House Master directly.

Sheng Long also seriously said, “The same applies to my Divine Dragon Pavilion. There’s no need to continue if Palace Master Gu Mo held this dinner intending to form an alliance. I’ll make my move first.”

Sheng Long stood up and walked towards the exit after he spoke.

The Purple Dress House Master also stood up to leave while Jian Wushuang was the only one left sitting there.

Gu Mo looked on with a smile without any intention of stopping them as the two of them left.

A figure suddenly appeared in front of Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master when they just arrived at the entrance of the hall.

“My guests, the dinner has just begun. Why are you in a hurry to leave?” A cold voice could be heard coming from that person’s mouth.

It was an elder with a cold and lifeless figure whose voice also sounded as though there was no life in it.

“Shi Mo!!” The faces of Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master darkened.

Shi Mo—Gu Mo’s elder brother—was an extremely strong Peak-level Heaven Ultimate God. At the very least, he was much stronger than both Gu Mo and Sheng Long.

However, Shi Mo was not the only one who appeared at that moment. Two other figures were standing behind him. They were a man and woman whose aura had also reached the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm.
