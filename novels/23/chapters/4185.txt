4186 Besieging and Killing the Ninth Kalpa King

Jian Wushuang knew very well that the reason he had been able to kill Ruler Horned Flame was not only because his power was far above that of Ruler Horned Flame after he had used the original universe. Most importantly, his Wuqi Divine Sword had instantly destroyed Ruler Horned Flame’s body defense, rendering his true treasure armor useless.

Without the protection of a true treasure armor, Jian Wushuang could naturally kill him with his divine power.

Run!!!

At that moment, the effect of life intimidation disappeared. The divine armored guards seemed to have found a life-saving straw, and they immediately shot back in fear.

!!

The divine armor guard instantly moved ten thousand feet and let out a sigh of relief.

Just as he turned his head to see if Jian Wushuang had caught up with him, he suddenly saw from the corner of his eye that a blood-red sword light as bright as the moon was slashing at him with the power of thousands of thunderbolts!

The blood-red sword gleam that was as bright as the moon grew larger and larger in his eyes. Then, it grew larger and larger, and finally…

“No!”

“Arghh!” The guard howled as the blood-colored sword light streaked through him. In terms of power, he was inferior to even the Ruler Horned Flame, and his defensive abilities were even weaker. The guard was instantly slain, and the blood-colored sword light continued for another 1500 meters before finally weakening and disappearing.

In the distance, Jian Wushuang withdrew his gaze with an indifferent expression. With a step, his body turned into a black flowing light and rushed toward the Ninth Kalpa King’s battlefield.

In the Tarot Ruins, above the nine-layered clouds.

“Ninth Kalpa King, surrender obediently!”

“Ninth Kalpa King, if you give up resisting and swear a tribulation oath to be my slave, we can spare your life!”

“Ninth Kalpa King, three million years ago, when you exterminated my entire clan, did you ever think of this day?”

“Ninth Kalpa King, hand over that Supreme divine medicine, and we, the Blood Sky Palace, promise you that we will never interfere in your affairs!”

A series of cold sneers kept coming. The Ninth Kalpa King stepped in the void, his expression gloomy to the extreme.

Lord Zhennan, the Ruler Silver Roc, the Third Prince of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom, and the nine blood messengers of the Blood Sky Palace.

A total of twelve Supreme existences among the Ultimate Rulers had formed an encirclement and trapped him.

Not only that, but the Ruler Silver Roc and the others were obviously prepared. they had also set up a powerful array around them, which greatly suppressed the Ninth Kalpa King’s strength.

Even though the Ninth Kalpa King’s combat strength was heaven-defying, he could only ward off the attacks of these twelve super experts and not fight back.

If this continued, the Ninth Kalpa King understood that even if he was a perfect life form with boundless divine power, he might still be exhausted to death here.

“If you want me to die, sure. But I’d like to see who will be the first one to die with me!” The Ninth Kalpa King’s gaze slowly swept across the faces of Lord Zhennan and the others, and a cold sneer appeared on his face.

He did not show any fear in the face of these threats. On the contrary, he could feel the blood that had been frozen for dozens of chaos cycles begin to boil.

It had been many years since the Ninth Kalpa King had stepped into the Ultimate Ruler realm. No one had ever posed any threat to him, not to mention this life-and-death crisis in front of him!

“You’re putting up a stubborn resistance.”

“It’s a pointless struggle.”

The twelve other Ultimate Rulers laughed coldly, but none of them were in a hurry to attack.

They knew that with the Ninth Kalpa King’s heaven-defying combat strength, at this final juncture, if he really fought to the death regardless of everything, at least half of the twelve of them present would fall in the hands of the Ninth Kalpa King and be buried with him!

No one wanted to be a scapegoat.

“Oh? Why, just now you all said that you wanted to kill me, but now you don’t dare to?” When the Ninth Kalpa King saw this, he suddenly laughed out loud. His laughter was extremely arrogant, contemptuous, and unbridled!

As soon as he finished speaking, the Lord Zhennan and the others could not help but look a little unsightly. Which of the twelve of them was not a top-tier heaven’s favorite in the outside world? Who would not be afraid and respectful when they saw them?

“Fine, since you guys aren’t going to make a move, I’ll make a move!” After the Ninth Kalpa King finished laughing, his eyes suddenly turned cold and he stared at the Ruler Silver Roc.

The Ninth Kalpa King hated the Silver Roc to the core!

“Die!”

In the next moment, the Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes flashed with a cold light and he attacked the Ruler Silver Roc!

As for the Ruler Silver Roc, he seemed to have sensed it long ago. He took out a golden spear and shot it at the Ninth Kalpa King!

At the same time, the Ruler Silver Roc stepped back slightly. Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince rushed out from both sides to block the Ninth Kalpa King!

Two huge divine wheels appeared behind Lord Zhennan. These Divine Wheels were engraved with nine-legged golden crows. Immediately, like a blazing sun, they smashed toward Ninth Kalpa King!

As for the Third Prince, who was wearing a nine-clawed Python robe and a purple gold crown, he flipped his right hand, and a pale Golden Dragon-patterned Jade seal appeared. It carried an overbearing and unparalleled suppressing force and pressed down on the Ninth Kalpa King!

“Get lost!”

The Ninth Kalpa King frowned, and a touch of anger flashed across his face. He sent out two palms, one toward the divine wheel of Lord Zhennan and the other toward the Dragon-patterned Jade seal of the Third Prince.

“Great destruction seal!”

“Great yellow spring seal!”

“Rumble, rumble, rumble!”

In an instant, the Ninth Kalpa King used his ultimate technique, and a violent aura burst out with him as the center!

Two thick and terrifying palms, along with the Ninth Kalpa King’s palm strike, ruthlessly smashed toward Lord Zhennan’s two huge divine wheels and the Third Prince’s Dragon-patterned jade seal! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince were both of noble status, so the divine wheel and the Dragon-patterned jade seal were naturally not ordinary items. One was refined from the core of the sun, and the other was a replica of the Imperial Jade seal of the Supreme Emperor God from the Da Feng Divine Kingdom. Both of them had reached the level of high-grade Supreme treasures of principles.

Bang!

However, these two high-grade nomological supreme treasures were directly sent flying by the Ninth Kalpa King’s two terrifying palms!

As for the Ninth Kalpa King, other than pausing for a moment, his qi and blood were slightly turbulent. He once again stretched out his five fingers and grabbed at the head of the Ruler Silver Roc.

Even the confident Silver Roc Ruler was taken aback by this.

The golden axe could not even stop the Ninth Kalpa King for a breath’s time. It was directly turned into powder by the Ninth Kalpa King’s violent divine power. Just as the Ninth Kalpa King’s five fingers were about to hit the head of the Ruler Silver Roc, nine ghostly figures appeared behind him in an instant.

“Die!”

A cold voice was heard. Then, the nine Blood Nether Emissaries hacked down at the Ninth Kalpa King’s back with black evil Sickles in their hands.
