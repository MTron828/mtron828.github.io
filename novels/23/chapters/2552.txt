Chapter 2553: Seclusion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Inside a secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with an unfurled scroll floating in front of him.

It was none other than the Fengtian Scroll.

“I’ve currently reached a Regular Peak Divine Demon level regardless of my Space-time Law, Transmigration Law, or the Sword Principles understanding. However, I’m still quite a distance away from becoming an Earth Ultimate God.

“Despite the Situ Clan providing me with enough Primordial Stones a year later, I’m afraid I won’t be confident enough to defeat the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord even after making a breakthrough to the Ultimate God Realm from refining and absorbing those stones. An immense increase to my overall abilities is insufficient so long my Laws and Sword Principles understanding isn’t up to par.”

Jian Wushuang knew very well that even if he had made a breakthrough from Peak Divine Demon to a Primary Stage Ultimate God, it would only reinforce his divine powers and perhaps his secret techniques as well at most.

A cultivator’s divine power was not a true reflection of their abilities. Laws and Principles understanding; secret techniques; self-creation masterstroke and tactics; and many other factors were also crucial elements which would decide one’s capabilities.

He unquestionably held an advantage against the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord when it came to secret techniques.

However, he was still a far cry away in respect to his other abilities.

This was especially true for his Sword Principles...

He was in the Complete Sword Principle Realm as of then and would be able to develop his Sword World with further progress.

Opening up his Sword World would be a huge push for his abilities.

Jian Wushuang had the first-hand experience of the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s Sword World followed by the Ancient Witch’s Spear World. His abilities were greatly limited when he came under the oppression of Principle Worlds.

The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord was an Earth Ultimate God and had probably also developed his Principle World. Jian Wushuang would have to open up his Sword World to stand a chance of defeating him.

“Not only do I have to open up a Sword World, but I’ll also have to upgrade my Space-time and Transmigration Laws understanding. I’ll also have to think about establishing my masterstrokes... Well, I’ll just do it step by step.”

Jian Wushuang was in no hurry as it mattered not if he could not achieve much within a year since he could just continue his studies.

Jian Wushuang very soon began his studies with the assistance of Fengtian Scroll’s Cosmic Mysteries.

He was born with high comprehension skills and his progress was incredibly swift with the help of the Fengtian Scroll.

The Northern Darkstar Territory clans were relieved following Jian Wushuang’s closed-door seclusion.

They were worried that Jian Yi would continue looking for trouble with them after accepting their gifts like what he did with the Ye, Jiang, and Huo Clan.

However, it seemed that Jian Yi still had some self-respect.

The Northern Darkstar Territory finally returned to its usual peacefulness since Jian Yi did not take any further actions and the incident gradually died down.

Time ticked by slowly and three months passed in a flash.

...

In the void furthest from the Northern Darkstar Continent...

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly appeared.

It was a middle-aged man dressed in green. Everything else about him was normal other than his face looked stern while carrying a battle blade on his back.

“The Northern Darkstar Continent... I’m back! Pei Qi has finally returned to the Northern Darkstar Continent after forty thousand years! Haha!”

He let out a burst of maniacal laughter that resonated with Heaven and Earth like a huge wave that echoed between them for some time.

The middle-aged man’s laughter gradually dissipated as his facial features began to relax after some time.

“San Shouwang. You probably never thought I’ll return one day, right?” The man’s voice was cold. “You killed my parents, annihilated the entire Pei Clan, and chased me out of Northern Darkstar Territory forty thousand years ago. I was extremely humiliated and had to tiptoe between life and death for forty thousand years. I’ve finally reached the same power level as you!

“I’m currently the strongest possible version of myself since I’ve peaked out my abilities in every aspect with no room for further progress. I’ll kill you this time!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The green-clad middle-aged man arrived at a group of extremely huge barracks along with his bottomless hatred and rage.

These barracks were the Official Army Barracks.

These barracks were extremely vast and towering as it was the strongest Official Army in the Northern Darkstar Territory and also the strongest power under the Territorial Lord’s control.

A few soldiers stood like statues at the barrack’s entrance.

A man walked toward the barracks gate which the soldiers immediately stopped when they saw him approaching.

One of the soldiers growled, “Stop, this is the Official Army Barracks. Trespassers will be killed without mercy!”

The middle-aged man gradually stopped and raised his head to look at the soldiers before emotionlessly saying, “I’m here for a challenge.”

The soldier frowned. “A challenge? What kind of challenge?”

The middle-aged man did not say another word as a terrifying divine power aura suddenly burst out of his body.

The divine power aura was suffocatingly strong as it swept in every direction and caused a violent gust of wind to blow everywhere within the void.

The few soldiers who were blocking the middle-aged man instantly turned pale as their legs trembled underneath that man’s aura.

His terrifying divine power aura even swept toward the barracks’ insides.

There were countless experts within the Official Army with Ultimate Gods alone totaling to at least a thousand! During that moment, many soldiers in the barracks—including squad and platoon captains who were at Primary Stage and Advance Stage Ultimate Gods—instantly felt the aura and were extremely stunned.

There were five commanders within the barracks and even the five Peak Ultimate God commanders were also incredibly surprised.

“That aura...belongs to an Earth Ultimate God!”

“This Earth Ultimate God’s divine power aura isn’t His Excellency, the Territorial Lord’s. Who is it from?”

“The aura is being projected from outside the barracks. Let’s quickly head there right now!”

The entire Official Army barracks descended into a stir.

In just a short moment, a large number of Official Army soldiers—including the commanders and captains—appeared at the barracks’ entrance. Many pairs of eyes gazed surprisingly at the green-clad middle-aged man.

At the same moment, the middle-aged man directly looked back at those soldiers before him.

The green-clad middle-aged man’s mouth emotionlessly spat out, “I want to challenge the Territorial Lord!”

The commanders shuddered.

They already suspected his reason being here was to challenge the Territorial Lord. However, he would have to pass certain basic tests to certify that he was sufficiently qualified and capable to challenge the Territorial Lord.

The tests were very quickly held and settled within the barracks.

The green-clad middle-aged man of course easily passed all the tests and was deemed qualified to challenge the Territorial Lord.

“Go and tell your Territorial Lord I’ll be meeting him in the Combat Ring ten days from now. The victor will be the last one standing!”

He immediately left after leaving behind his message.
