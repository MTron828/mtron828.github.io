Chapter 2671: Wu Xin

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The strong wave of Heaven Ultimate God’s divine power suppressed Jian Wushuang’s body like a tsunami.

The burly man called Wu Xin’s cold staring toward Jian Wushuang with both his eyes were like two rays of explosive lightning. “Are you sure you want to challenge me?”

“Definitely.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently and seemed extremely at ease under Wu Xin’s suppressive aura.

“How much would you like to bet?” Wu Xin asked.

“My bet just now with Leng Xing was already two hundred Divine Elixir Pills. You’re a Heaven Ultimate God so your bet needs to be higher. Let’s agree on five hundred Divine Elixir Pills,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Alright, I agree.” Wu Xin directly nodded. “We maintain the fight on laws and principles understanding while I’ll take note to hold back my divine power. Let’s begin.”

Wu Xin did not waste time after he finished speaking with his extremely cold voice as his body started moving.

Hum!!

The same situation happened as a large number of apparitions appeared.

These Dragon Phoenix Pavilion Heavenly Prides came to the Sacred Palace because of the Space-time Beast as all of them had meditated on the Space-time Law.

It was without a doubt that Wu Xin had the highest understanding among them in Space-time Law.

The apparitions that concurrently appeared overwhelmingly blotted out the entire void and ground as Wu Xin had conjured 1,000 apparitions at that moment!!

1,000 apparitions were the limit for apparitions cultivation. Achieving this step meant that Wu Xin’s Space-time Law understanding had reached the peak of the first stage with his next improvement being achieving the second stage—Space-time Strangulation.

Such a level of understanding was definitely extremely strong among Heaven Ultimate Gods. Many Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods were also unable to achieve the second stage Space-time Strangulation after all.

“You have quite a good understanding of Space-time Law.” Jian Wushuang only smiled indifferently as 1,000 apparitions also appeared following a slight twitch of his body.

A large number of apparitions filled the entire battlefield as both of them were moving at high speeds and soon clashed head-to-head with each other.

Clank!

Loud clanking sounds of metal on metal could be heard as the people surrounding the battlefield immediately looked towards the sound’s origin but only to see two strong divine powers fighting against each other before another loud humming sound could be heard at another void not far from that location.

An Earth Ultimate God Sacred Palace disciple could not control himself and ask, “C-can you guys see where their true bodies are at?”

“I can’t. I can only see these apparitions while following the sounds.”

“I can’t see them too.”

“They are moving too... Too fast!!”

“This is true speed. I’ve seen two Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods fighting and their speeds were also extremely surprising. However, there’s a huge difference between them and these two.”

“Even if hundreds of worked together, they’ll only be easily killed by those two under such extreme speed if this was a real battle as Peak Earth Ultimate Gods’ attacks won’t be able to touch those two under such scary speed in addition to having so many apparitions.”

The surrounding Sacred Palace disciples stood there in shock as they looked at Jian Wushuang and Wu Xin bumping into each other in the middle of the battlefield.

However, they only saw them fighting unstoppably with nobody capable of seeing clearly their true bodies’ location.

Sounds of exclamation naturally could be heard expanding.

Even the three heavenly prides of Dragon Phoenix Pavilion were also making noises as they saw the course of events before their eyes.

Two figures were slowly walking over in the void far away from the battlefield.

“Brother Si Zhen, I’m sorry for troubling you this time.” A black-robed elder with eagle-like eyes was smiling softly. “My Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples have met with some bottlenecks in their Space-time Law understanding and the Space-time Beast in your Sacred Palace is quite intriguing. They must be able to learn something after meditating for one month in front of the Space-time Beast in your Sacred Palace.”

“Haha... It’s no trouble at all. Brother Teng, there’s no need to be so polite with me. You’ve paid a certain price after all.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was also smiling.

At this moment, continuous humming noises could be heard from the void in front of them.

“Hmmm?” The black-robed elder and Palace Keeper Si Zhen were both surprised.

“I specifically asked your disciples from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion to take action and teach my Sacred Palace disciples a lesson. However, their interaction should have long finished as so much time passed. Why are they still fighting until now?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was slightly surprised.

“Let’s go over and have a look,” said the black-robed elder with a smile.

The duo immediately increased their speed and soon arrived at the void outside the Space-time Palace only to notice the battle in front of them.

“Wu Xin actually took action?” The black-robed elder squinted his eyes when he saw the battlefield’s scene. “The person fighting with him is...a Peak Earth Ultimate God. However, his speed isn’t any weaker than Wu Xin and is equal with Wu Xin in this fight?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The black-robed elder asked, “Palace Keeper Si Zhen, who’s this young guy?”

He had no idea that Palace Keeper Si Zhen was slightly stunned at that moment.

He definitely recognized the person fighting Wu Xin and it was none other than Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang had been training in retreat as per his knowledge. When did he come out?

He knew slightly about Jian Wushuang’s strength.

He purposely requested those heavenly prides from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion to teach the Sacred Palace disciples a lesson at that time so that his disciples would understand the limits of their abilities on top of wearing down their inner ignorance and create awareness that there were stronger people out there in the world.

However, he had not previously considered these Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples would end up fighting with Jian Wushuang.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen replied upon hearing the black-robed elder’s question, “This guy is Jian Yi and had just become one of the Sacred Palace’s disciples. He had been keeping a low profile ever since and had been training in seclusion. I wonder why he suddenly came out from his seclusion today and got involved in the fight against these Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s people.”

The black-robed elder praised, “Jian Yi? This youth is quite good. Although he’s just a Peak Earth Ultimate God, his Space-time Law understanding has reached the first stage’s peak. He’s as good as Wu Xin on top of being so brilliant in swordsmanship.”

“Brother Si Zhen, who would have expected you to have such a strong genius in your Sacred Palace?”

Palace Keeper Si Zhen could only embarrassingly smile.

“He has a high understanding of Space-time Law but is sadly only a Peak Earth Ultimate God. There’s still a slight difference between him and Wu Xin.” The black-robed elder smiled indifferently. “Look, Wu Xin is starting to take things seriously.”

Palace Keeper Si Zhen immediately looked over.

Sure enough, the duo who were fighting furiously on the battlefield distanced themselves from each other before Wu Xin took out a smaller and thinner golden-purple staff apart from the dark-gold staff he initially held in his hand. This golden-purple staff had a very unique aura that was surrounded by a surging Space-time Law power.
