4751 The Tarot Divine Sword Is Destroyed

Sword Intent and Sword Dao were mountains and seas of their own.

Even if he did not use his Sword Intent to form a blade, he was confident that he could exert 100 percent of the sword power of Wushuang’s sword principle with just a tree branch!

Long ago, in the Divine Power Universe’s Cloud Palace, he had sparred with Sword Immortal Ding Baiyi for more than 100,000 years, and they had used a peach branch.

An Invisible Sword was formed, and Ding Beichun’s aura turned cold. It was as if he had become a sword.

Wisps of Invisible Sword Intent escaped from every pore of his body. On his naked upper body, the flowing clouds and water ripples began to fluctuate, as if a great river and sea were rising.

As he pointed his sword forward, thousands of water ripples climbed onto the blade of the sword, like a dragon ready to strike.

“My sword principle is called the Seven Swords of Northern Spring. Although it has the name of ‘Seven Swords’, it only has three actual Swords Intents. I’m afraid it’ll be difficult to complete the remaining four Sword Intents.”

Ding Beichun said slowly, “However, I’ve forced back 6,000 peak Yan Immortal realm cultivators with only three of these sword moves, and I’ve never been defeated before. Brother Jian, please take a look today.”

Jian Wushuang replied, “My pleasure.”

A ripple quietly appeared in the air. Ding Beichun stood still, but his aura, along with the Invisible Sword in his hand, suddenly expanded.

It was only then that Jian Wushuang realized that the flowing clouds and water patterns on Ding Beichun’s body were not a pattern, but a Sword Intent that was transformed from a prop!

Every flowing cloud water ripple was a Sword Intent. At this moment, almost half of the space in the chasm was covered by Ding Beichun’s Sword Dao.

It was as if there were a million swords pointing at him. An unprecedented pressure made Jian Wushuang solemn.

The ‘Star’ Sword Intent had forced Ding Beichun to retreat.

The Sword Intent of the ‘River’ also rose up. A more vigorous and majestic Sword Intent turned into a surging sky river and flowed out of Jian Wushuang’s sleeve.

Jian Wushuang had a deeper understanding of the first two moves of the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent.

The two Sword Intents, Star and River, not only complemented each other, but also had their own unique sword momentum.

These two styles of Sword Intents were the framework and cornerstone of the entire Wushuang Sword Dao, so that there was no situation of crushing each other between the two. They were both powerful and had an endless momentum of peak Sword Intent.

Perhaps, only the latter two moves, Lake and Sea, would have a more terrifying and stunning performance.

The so-called Sword Dao, sword technique, and Sword Intent.

No matter how gorgeous it was, it was still a killing technique. The ultimate goal was to become more powerful and limitless.

This time, Jian Wushuang took the lead.

One sword strike was enough to destroy a million enemies, and the sword waterfall surged toward Ding Beichun.

Jian Wushuang was no longer sitting on the long river. Instead, he stood on the spot, raised his hand, and condensed an Invisible Sword. He buried it in the sword waterfall and attacked!

At this moment, Ding Beichun’s eyes were filled with fanaticism. The sword patterns on his body had been personally carved by his Master, and a full-force attack from him could push back 6000 top cultivators.

If this sword move of his failed, did it mean that the young man before him really had the strength to fight with his Master?

The dazzling flowing clouds churned like hundreds of dragons, coiling around each other as they swept over.

The two sword principles that belonged to the peak of the world collided.

The Young Emperor, who was watching from afar, was shocked again. He immediately retreated from the natural moat without thinking.

Whirrr– Boom!!!

The earth-shattering clash tore apart everything in sight.

The sea of purple-red lava surged and rose thousands of feet high, crazily devouring the last piece of land.

At the same time, the entire black stone hall began to collapse. The 10,000 swords hanging in the sky trembled and then broke.

Such a destructive clash shook the entire Sword Heaven. At the same time, invisible shockwaves spread across half of the Heavenly Realm.

The Faries, who was still washing up in the sea of flowers, was the first to feel the shockwaves. They all looked in Sword Heaven’s direction in shock.

“Sister, isn’t that a place strictly forbidden by the Emperor? Why is there such a loud noise?” the yellow-robed fairy asked nervously. “Should we report this to the Emperor?”

When the white-robed fairy heard this, she raised her delicate hand to silence her. “Don’t bother about things that we shouldn’t ask about. The Heavenly Court will send someone to investigate.”

When the other Fairies heard this, they did not say anything more and continued to wash up.

Only the white-robed fairy hesitated. The only person who had the right to enter Sword Heaven at this moment was the Young Emperor.

However, what was his purpose in entering?

Thinking of this, a stream of light formed by Yan power spread out from her hand and quickly swept into the clouds and disappeared.

At the same time, Uncle Yu, who was meditating in the Wind-Listening Platform, suddenly opened his eyes and disappeared in the next moment.

More than half of the black stone hall was damaged, and the ground was cracked open for nearly ten thousand miles. Purple-red lava seemed to boil the sky.

Under the ground that was as deep as the abyss, three figures stood above the lava.

Ding Beichun, who was half-naked, was gasping for air. Although Jian Wushuang looked calm, his palms were bleeding, which showed that he had not won easily.

Although Jian Wushuang had added an Extinctive Sword Strike into the River move Sword Intent, he had almost lost the battle.

He had not expected that Ding Beichun’s sword technique actually contained three Sword Intents.

The three of them combined into one profound sword move.

It had to be said that Ding Beichun’s sword principle was extremely powerful. With an indomitable aura, Jian Wushuang vaguely felt that it was similar to Ding Baiyi’s Extinctive Sword.

Even so, Jian Wushuang still won. He won not because of his cultivation realm or Yan power’s background, but purely because of the sword principle.

After Ding Beichun calmed his breathing, he cupped his hands at Jian Wushuang and said, “Brother Jian, I lost.”

“Continue to cultivate diligently. When your Sword Dao is complete, come and find me,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

Ding Beichun laughed. “If there comes a day when my Sword Dao is fully integrated, I will definitely prove my Dao to Brother Jian.”

The Young Emperor floated between the two of them and asked with slight confusion, “By the way, do you smell anything?”

Ding Beichun was taken aback. He turned to look at the huge cauldron that had been half-swallowed by the lava. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“My, my furnace!”

As the wind blew, his body grew tens of thousands of feet. He jumped into the magma and pulled the huge furnace up.

However, it was too late. The sun-like light in the furnace was no longer there, and it had become extremely dim.

Ding Beichun’s hands trembled as he slowly opened the lid of the furnace.

Immediately, countless pungent black smoke scuttled out.

“Brother Jian, your sword seems to have been destroyed…” With a long face, he reached out and took out a Sword Embryo that was beyond recognition.

Jian Wushuang, “…”

The young Emperor said, “Beichun, have you thought about how you’re going to get beaten up?”
