“Jian Wushuang, long time no see. Do you need help?”

The incomer’s faint laughter reverberated in the universe. Everyone at the scene was astonished.

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zi Xu and Great Emperor Colored Glaze saw the incomer and their eyes dilated in shock.

No doubt, they had never seen an enchanting woman in a red robe.

However, the enchanting woman in the red robe gave out an aura that wasn’t weaker than theirs. She was definitely at the level of a Great Emperor.

The moment she appeared, she brought about great pressure to the other three Great Emperors. She was obviously not only a Great Emperor but an extremely strong Great Emperor.

“Previously, there was a mysterious Emperor Thirteen. Then, Jian Wushuang’s sword servant reached the level of a Great Emperor. Now, there’s another Great Emperor? She obviously knew Jian Wushuang personally. Since when did Great Emperor experts become so invaluable?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze muttered.

However, they didn’t know that Jian Wushuang was quite shocked then.

He looked at the enchanting woman in the red robe and it stirred a great commotion in his heart.

The enchanting woman in the red robe, he of course knew her!

“Lord Spirit Sound!!!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but clenched.

“It’s her?” King of Venomous Worms who was living on Jian Wushuang was shocked too.

That was right. The enchanting woman in the red robe who had suddenly come was Lord Spirit Sound who had stayed in Star Foggy Sea back then!

Back then, before Jian Wushuang had yet to leave Green Fire World, he had once received a great opportunity. It was in Star Foggy Sea. Through the test on Star Island, he became a disciple of Star Palace in Lineage of Star. Then, Star Foggy Sea was under Lord Spirit Sound’s control. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When Jian Wushuang first saw Lord Spirit Sound, he thought Lord Spirit Sound was from Lineage of Star and it was Master of Star Palace who had intentionally arranged to pick disciples for Lineage of Star.

Even Lord Spirit Sound had said that herself.

When Jian Wushuang passed the test and became a disciple of Star Palace in Lineage of Star, Star Foggy Sea had been within Jian Wushuang’s control. Then, Lord Spirit Sound left and Jian Wushuang had no idea where she went.

In the beginning, Jian Wushuang never minded much.

But later on, when he really arrived in Lineage of Star then became the new palace master of Lineage of Star, and after he had found out more about the environment of Green Fire World, he noticed the unusual.

Firstly, everyone from Lineage of Star, including Master of Star Palace, had no idea who Lord Spirit Sound was. Hence, it was even more impossible that it could have been Master of Star Palace who arranged it.

Secondly, under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for Star Foggy Sea to appear in Green Fire World.

After knowing this, Jian Wushuang started suspecting Lord Spirit Sound’s true identity.

He had even asked King of Venomous Worm about that before. After all, King of Venomous Worms had stayed in Star Foggy Sea for a very long time but he had said that he wasn’t sure either.

Just then, Lord Spirit Sound reappeared in front of him again. Jian Wushuang had finally determined that Lord Spirit Sound was from a great background.

As for controlling Star Foggy Sea for Master of Star Palace, it was a plain joke.

After all, the aura that Lord Spirit Sound had displayed was of Great Emperor level!

During the Master of Star Palace’s peak, he was only a Peak Emperor God. How could he command Lord Spirit Sound?

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath. He didn’t think further but answered, “Lord Spirit Sound, lend me a hand. I, Jian Wushuang, and Green Fire World will remember this.”

“No problem,” Lord Spirit Sound smiled faintly.

After that, she suddenly pointed with her delicate finger.

Rumble. The spacetime shook. The dark void where Jian Wushuang was instantly dispersed and the vast darkness prison around him broke apart.

There was boundless light that filled the universe. Jian Wushuang moved and he immediately shook off the darkness prison.

The sight shocked Abysmal Saint Master, “She broke my darkness prison so easily. This person’s power is not any weaker than mine.”

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Great Emperor Zi Xu and Great Emperor Colored Glaze appeared next to Abysmal Saint Master.

As for Jian Yi and the five godly spirits, they naturally came behind Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Spirit Sound, thank you,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

“Hehe. Don’t worry about it. I have stayed in Green Fire World for so many years and I do have feelings for the place. How could I just sit and watch outsiders trying to conquer Green Fire World?” Lord Spirit Sound said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded and he looked at the three Great Emperors again.

“Lord Spirit Sound, could you please help me keep one of them busy next?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sure,” Lord Spirit Sound nodded and then she pointed at Great Emperor Zi Xu, “Among the three, this person in the purple robe is the strongest. I will keep him occupied so he doesn’t have extra time to attack. As for the other two, you can take care of them.”

“No problem,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

As long as Lord Spirit Sound could keep Great Emperor Zi Xu occupied, Jian Yi, the five gods and himself could deal with Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

“Let’s do it!”

Lord Spirit Sound didn’t waste any more time but flew out.

“Hey, you in purple robe, your opponent is I,” Lord Spirit Sound flashed a malicious smile at Great Emperor Zi Xu. There was a strange light in her eyes.

Great Emperor Zi Xu’s heart skipped a beat. His face instantly grew solemn and he lost the relaxed look earlier.

“Oh, you could resist my magic. Not too shabby,” Lord Spirit Sound commented. Then, there was a evil-looking crimson sickle in her hand.

Wow!

From a very far distance, the crimson sickle in Lord Spirit Sound’s hand was swung out.

Just like Death’s sickle.

Wow! Wow! Wow!

The three sickle lights swept out simultaneously and instantly formed three brilliant sickle rivers in the void.

The three sickle rivers were beautifully magnificent. They were captivating.

The sickle river flowed over and Great Emperor Zi Xu instantly felt that he was in a billowing sickle ocean that he couldn’t shake off.

He instantly counter-attacked. Every time he broke a sickle light, there was another brilliant sickle light that flew at him again.

In an instant, Great Emperor Xi Xu of the fifth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list was suppressed by Lord Spirit Sound.

“So strong?”

Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s faces changed at the sight.

They could tell that although Lord Spirit Sound was far below the mysterious expert Emperor Thirteen, she was much stronger than all the ordinary Great Emperors in Eternal Chaotic World. If they have to list her in terms of ranking in power, she absolutely could fight with Red Dragon King in the second place.

“Even if I were to be at my peak status, I reckon I would still have the lower hand when I fought with this person,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Then, Jian Wushuang, Jian Yi and the five godly spirits moved at the same time!
