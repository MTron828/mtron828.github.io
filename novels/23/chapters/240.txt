Chapter 241: The Nine Emperors Sect is Finished!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Run!”

“Run now!”

The forlorn, shrill voices rang out in succession. The surviving Gold Core Realm experts of the Nine Emperors Sect madly ran away like extremely frightened birds, while the experts of the Raindrop Pavilion seized the opportunity to hunt them down.

“Haha, where are you going?”

“Since you have come, stay here.”

“You said you would make our Raindrop Pavilion disappear. Haha, I think your Nine Emperors Sect should disappear now.”

The experts of the Raindrop Pavilion were excited and unwilling to give up the opportunity to trample them.

The Nine Emperors Sect was a top Sect, but with their five Yin-Yang Void Realm experts killed by Jian Wushuang, the Nine Emperors Sect lost their battle strength and could no longer stand up to the Raindrop Pavilion.

The battlefield was a mess.

After he killed the last Yin Void expert, Jian Wushuang stayed suspended in the air but stopped attacking.

He had no interest in warriors at the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

After a while, the whole battlefield went still.

More than half of the experts of the Nine Emperors Sect had been killed. Although a small number of them were lucky enough to escape, it would not change anything because their top experts had all been killed.

After this fight, the Nine Emperors Sect would fall into decline.

“The Nine Emperors Sect is finished!”

A green-robed elder, who hid in the dark, was sighing because of what happened.

“Why?”

A teenager beside the green-robed elder asked in surprise, “Because of Jian Wushuang? Just him?”

“Just him.” The green-robed elder nodded. “Recently, the Nine Emperors Sect had suffered a lot because of Jian Wushuang. They had just recovered, but bumped into Jian Wushuang again. This time they lost their strongest warriors. The Nine Emperors Sect doesn’t have a single Yin Void expert anymore. How could they rank in the “three sects and four schools” of Tiannan Province.

“Even without the attack from Jian Wushuang and the Raindrop Pavilion, it wouldn’t have been long before the Nine Emporers Sect disappeared.”

After hearing this, the teenager said, with a flicker of complex emotion in his eyes, “It turns out that it’s possible for someone to trample a large sect if he is powerful enough.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

These three from the Ouyang clan still stood nearby, above the tall building.

“Ku Ya of Blood Feather Tower.” The elegant man looked serious.

“Ku Ya had reached the Exceptional Yang Void Realm, close to the Peak, and was almost strong enough to be on the Heavenly Dragon List. In our Ouyang clan, there are less than three people who are qualified to fight against him. Only our Clan Leader could defeat him.”

“Jian Wushuang killed Ku Ya with only one stroke after that surge of power?”

The elegant man squinted and pondered over it for a while. Then he suddenly looked at Ouyang Xiu and said, “Ouyang Xiu, tell me what Jian Wushuang said when you fought with him.”

Ouyang Xiu had already fallen into shock. He did not recover from it until the elegant man called him. When he saw the hint of coldness in his eyes, Ouyang Xiu was scared and immediately spoke. “Jian Wushuang said that from now on the Ouyang Clan has nothing to do with the Raindrop Pavilion. If our Ouyang clan is not convinced, you can go find him.”

“That’s it?” The elegant man looked awful.

“He said that if the Ouyang clan wanted to help the Nine Emperors Sect in this fight, he would not mind slaughtering the Ouyang clan,” Ouyang Xiu replied with a slight sense of terror.

The elegant man breathed a sigh of relief.

“Jian Wushuang does not like our Ouyang clan, but he will not attack us,” the elegant man said in a low voice.

The Ouyang clan had a grudge against Jian Wushuang.

In the Tianzong Dynasty selection battle, Jian Wushuang had killed Ouyang Haotian and Ouyang Haoyue, the two geniuses of the Ouyang clan, so the Ouyang clan had harbored hatred towards Jian Wushuang.

Now the elegant man was not thinking about how to fight Jian Wushuang, but he was deliberating about whether Jian Wushuang really hated and would attack the Ouyang clan.

He did not dare to think about how to deal with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s strength had reached a terrifying level.

He was only 20 years old, yet he already had such achievements. If given several years, he could easily slaughter the Ouyang clan.

“Ouyang Xiu!”

The elegant man stared at Ouyang Xiu with wide eyes and coldly said, “Listen, from now on, treat the people of the Raindrop Pavilion politely. Recently, it is not peaceful in the Tianzong Dynasty. If you piss off a powerful opponent, you will definitely be punished by the clan.”

“Yes, Yes!” Ouyang Xiu nodded, without hesitation.

...

The battle was over.

The Nine Emperors Sect was defeated. Although they suffered a great loss, the Raindrop Pavilion had gained more because they became famous throughout the whole Tianzong Dynasty.

In a secret chamber of the headquarters of the Raindrop Pavilion, Jian Wushuang sat by the roundtable with the excited Tang Wuji. The several foreign experts respectfully stood behind them while glancing at Jian Wushuang from time to time.

Their eyes were full of admiration and worship.

This black-robed youth killed the strongest warriors in the Nine Emperors Sect by himself and even killed an expert in the Exceptional Yang Void Realm.

He saved the Raindrop Pavilion.

Now they understood why Jian Wushuang dared to say such words two days ago.

“How many did we lose?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Tang Wuji and asked.

“Not bad. I lost quite a few Gold Core Realm warriors, but none of the Guests in the Yin Void Realm died,” Tang Wuji smiled and said.

“In spite of these losses, our Raindrop Pavilion became famous through this battle. Especially with you, boss, it’s only a matter of time before we take the place of the Nine Emperors Sect and became a top force in the Tianzong Dynasty.”

“Don’t count on me,” Jian Wushuang rolled his eyes towards Tang Wuji and continued, “I just helped you this time. I don’t care what level your Raindrop Pavilion reaches.”

Tang Wuji could only shrug his shoulder.

He really wanted Jian Wushuang to stay in the Raindrop Pavilion. He was even willing to give him his position as Pavilion Master. If he stayed here, the Raindrop Pavilion would become more and more powerful.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang had no such plan.

On that day, Jian Wushuang left the Raindrop Pavilion and went to the Golden-dragon Palace.
