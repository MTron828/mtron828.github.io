4603 Dying Snake God

Ever since she found out that the Fengtian Patriarch had passed away, she had sat in a daze for seven days. It was as if her soul had been drawn away, and she had lost all faith and reliance.

Even Supreme Dao Yan could not cheer her up.

In the end, it was Jian Wushuang’s words that woke her up from her meditation.

The moment she left the Holy Land, she experienced the extreme evil of the universe. This was fatal to an extremely naive child.

The only thing Jian Wushuang could do now was to help her let go.

“We’ll reach the crack in a day at most,” Jian Wushuang said. “But I think the crack should be more tightly guarded. I’m afraid those guys are already waiting for us there.”

Even if there were 20 Void Masters who are in the Six Scar level guarding the crack, Jian Wushuang was confident that he could protect Dao Yan and Ban Shan until they reached the Divine Power Universe.

However, Shi Zhuzhi and Snake God were his biggest concerns. Without a perfect plan, Jian Wushuang would never let have free roam.

“I’ll go first. You guys wait in the nearby Star Field. If I’m free, I’ll come and pick you up. If I can’t come back in seven days, Elder Dao Yan, you guys can hide and wait until the crack weakens before you break out,” Jian Wushuang said.

Ban Shan was about to speak when Dao Yan reached out to stop him. He said, “We’ll listen to Palace Master Wushuang’s orders. Even if we go together, we’ll only cause trouble for Palace Master Wushuang.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang nodded. Just as he was about to leave, Chu Zhi pulled on the corner of his clothes and said timidly, “You Terrible Chess Player. Don’t leave me behind.”

Jian Wushuang rubbed her hair and said, “Wait for me for two days. I’ll come back to pick you up in two days at most.”

Chu Zhi gritted her teeth and then released her grip. “Terrible Chess Player… Besides Master, you’re the only one I know. Don’t leave me behind.”

Jian Wushuang felt sad. After making the promise, he rushed into the crack.

A year might be long for ordinary living beings, but for cultivators, it was almost like the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang gambled that Snake God and the others did not strengthen their arrangements and went to the 23 cracks again.

As soon as he stepped into the enchantment around the crack, a thick aura of death hit him in the face.

He was slightly stunned. The corpses of the Void Masters he had killed were still scattered in the void, and their positions had not even changed.

Other than that, there was no other aura of a living person.

Could it be that no one had made any arrangements in the past year, and no one knew what had happened here?

Jian Wushuang could not believe that none of the Void Masters on duty had noticed the situation.

With Snake God’s suspicious and treacherous nature, it was impossible for him not to be guarding this place.

Could it be that they were not in the Void Universe? Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang was overjoyed and was about to test the waters.

Jian Wushuang was shocked and immediately released his divine power to create a formation.

In the next moment, the boundary of the crack suddenly burst open, and a bloody figure jumped into the Void Universe.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed. “Snake God?!”

At this moment, Snake God’s black robe had been torn to shreds. His exposed skin and scales seemed to have been peeled off by a great force, revealing his dark gray skin and flesh.

Of the nine heads that represented Snake God, only two were left. It seemed that the wounds on the broken neck had just recovered.

Snake God, who seemed to be on the verge of death, could not help but tremble when he saw Jian Wushuang. His vertical pupils turned gray. “It’s you, Jian Wushuang?!”

Jian Wushuang did not speak, but he released his aura, which expressed his hostile attitude.

Sensing his gradually rising terrifying aura, Snake God suppressed the uneasiness in his heart and said in a deep voice, “Why are you here? Get lost, or I don’t mind killing you on the spot!”

“Oh? With your current strength?” The divine pattern was brilliant and appeared on Jian Wushuang’s black robe. He looked at Snake God with a cold smile and said, “Why don’t you give it a try now?”

After sensing the change in his aura, Snake God’s face turned ashen. “How could you…”

Jian Wushuang knew how to take advantage of a person’s misfortunes. He immediately pulled out the Tarot Divine Sword and immediately released the fifth move of the Tarot Sword Manual.

A giant phantom of Tarot condensed in the sky. Unlike before, a huge sun appeared above the tip of the phantom. It was divine and magnificent!

Looking at the Sword Intent coming at him, Snake God, who was almost out of energy, could no longer pretend. He roared, “Jian Wushuang, you can’t kill me. Once I die, all the secrets will disappear, including the news of your Master, Xuan Yi!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled, and the giant Tarot phantom image tilted to the side, almost brushing past Snake God as the attack fell.

Boundless Sword Intent surged and tore apart the starry sky. Snake God was a little slow, and he could not move away in time. His entire left arm was shattered by the Sword Intent.

Jian Wushuang reached out and grabbed Snake God’s blood-drenched body, pulling Snake God in front of him.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were as deep as water. “Tell me all the secrets you know and I’ll spare your life!”

Snake God’s ugly face was twisted due to the intense pain, making it even uglier.

With a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth, Snake God said with resentment and jealousy, “It has only been 10,000 years, but you have grown to such a terrifying level. Jian Wushuang, what kind of monster are you?”

Jian Wushuang tightened his grip on Snake God’s neck and said, “Don’t keep me in suspense. As long as I exert force, you will die!”

Hearing this, Snake God laughed strangely. “If you kill me, someone else will replace me soon. Jian Wushuang, can you kill them all? If you kill me now, I guarantee that you won’t even be able to leave the Void Universe!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled. Just as he was about to kill Snake God with a palm strike, Snake God suddenly said, “There are forces behind me that even I don’t dare offend. Even if you’re able to fight against me now, will you be able to deal with a few guys who are as strong as me?”

“You’re looking for death!” Jian Wushuang shouted and exerted force in his palm.

Snake God’s throat let out a hissing sound. “Listen to me. Do as I say and head to the Polar Sea. I guarantee you will be safe!”

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to speak, a strong aura began to spread from the void crack.

“They’re already here. If you don’t do as I say, we’ll both die here!” Snake God slowly closed his eyes and no longer spoke.

Feeling the terrifying aura getting closer and closer, Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth and dragged Snake God, who was like a dead dog, into the depths of the Void Universe behind him.

When the two of them completely disappeared, the 23 crack enchantments were torn apart.

Several figures with vast void energy around them appeared.

“Why is there the presence of divine power here? Could it be that Snake God is already dead?”

“If he’s alive, I want to see him. If he’s dead, I want to see his corpse. I can’t let him live.”

“Yes, Sir.”
