Chapter 5305: Ancient Sects

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Alright, you only have two days, so cherish them. This is the map of the area near Yuan Yang Lake. If you want to leave the lake, you can take the teleportation array to the Northern Region and explore those ancient sects!”

“Ancient sects?” Jian Wushuang swallowed.

“Let’s go now!”

“But!”

With a smile on his face, Yang Sanmu waved his hand, and a giant ancient boat appeared in the sky.

The ancient boat was rather simple, with only a small pavilion and a puppet fisherman at the front.

Once on the ancient boat, Jian Wushuang discovered a familiar aura, an eternal aura.

“Is this an Eternal Treasure?” Jian Wushuang asked calmly, somewhat uncertain.

Yang Sanmu widened his eyes and exclaimed, “Kid, your eyesight is not bad!”

Indeed, it was an Eternal Treasure. Among the fifth-rank Emperors, Yang Sanmu was one of the wealthiest, even surpassing some less fortunate sixth-rank Emperors.

Apart from the treasures of the universe, he had collected all kinds of Eternal Treasures, from top-notch to ordinary.

This ancient boat was one of them.

It hadn’t been brought out since ancient times.

The power of Eternal Treasures was boundless. With a slight movement, they could transform into a stream of light, heading straight for the end of the sky.

First, Yang Sanmu took Jian Wushuang to the central palace above Yuan Yang Lake, where there was a large hall responsible for teleportation, connecting to the Northern Territory.

Due to time constraints, they couldn’t delve deep into the Northern Territory. Instead, they could only seek out some ancient sects on the outskirts for a casual visit.

To call it a visit was, in fact, just a sightseeing tour.

Entering the teleportation hall, Jian Wushuang saw a familiar face.

“Senior Qiuhuang!’

Qiuhuangs appearance was different from when they were in the treasure hall. Now, sitting at the center, he exuded a majestic aura, his strength already restored to its peak.

A tier 5 peak Emperor!

In the Elders’ Palace, even the weakest Emperors were tier 5 Emperors. Otherwise, they would have been eliminated long ago; Emperors below the tier were deemed useless.

“Hehe, I knew it was you, kid, in the Demon Sound Mountain!” Qiuhuang grinned, as if he had already guessed.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and said, “Senior is truly wise.”

“Cut the nonsense. The trial in the Original Realm is about to begin. Hurry up and go in!” The old man with sheep horns frowned. He had a low opinion of Qiuhuang. In terms of seniority, he had far more experience. As one of the first Emperors plundered, he maintained an air of seniority towards newcomers like Qiuhuang.

“Little Qiuhuang, I brought Wushuang here not to return to the original realm but to go to the Northern Region. Open the array quickly!” The old man with horns ordered.

Qiuhuang stood up directly from his throne. This body was just one of his avatars; his true self was in seclusion, cultivating.

A slender figure rose suddenly, creating a substantial momentum. After all, he was a tier 5 peak Emperor. Even as an avatar, he possessed the strength of an ordinary tier 5 Emperor.

This place was the central hub of the Elders’ Palace, and the avatar seated here naturally had to be formidable.

“The Northern Region?”

“The trial is about to begin. M/hy go to the Northern Region now?” The old man with goat horns spoke with a touch of anger. “Brother Wu Zuo specially arranged for Wushuang to stay for two more days to familiarize himself. Besides, when he goes back, Brother Wu Zuo will personally escort him. You don’t need to worry about it!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Upon hearing Wu Zuo’s intentions, Qiuhuangs gaze towards Jian Wushuang became even more incredulous.

In just a few days, Jian Wushuang had already established a connection with wu zuo.

Jian Wushuang stood on the side, nodding in agreement.

“Sorry for the trouble, Senior Qiuhuang!’

Whoosh!

The two stepped into the array, and in an instant, they crossed countless domains.

Northern Region, also known as the Northern Territory!

In the ancient territory of Liuzhou, there lay the city of Sharuo.

The vast expanse of Liuzhou was almost as large as a high-level realm, with Sharuo City ranking among the top three major cities.

Only such ancient cities boasted teleportation arrays.

Arrays of this scale could bankrupt a Grand Yan Immortal with each

activation, a cost affordable only to Emperors.

Fortunately, each activation could transport tens of thousands, making it feasible for some Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals to operate it.

The ancient and massive teleportation array stood at the heart of Sharuo City, adjacent to the city lord’s mansion.

Constructed by a tier 5 Emperor, who tragically fell during a sect battle, the management of this supercity fell to his descendants.

The current city lord, though not a tier 5 Emperor, was a highly esteemed fourth-tier peak-level Emperor in the region.

When Patriarch Sharuo fell, the city should have changed hands, but the tier 4 Emperor showed great boldness. He directly went to the White Tiger Temple after the sect battle and gifted Sharuo City to the White Tiger Temple.

Naturally, the White Tiger Temple accepted the gift, and no one dared to harbor ill intentions.

However, at that time, there was a shortage of manpower, so the fourth-tier Emperor took charge temporarily.

Although this was the official story, there were hidden details, known only to the people of the White Tiger Temple and the Emperor.

Outside the teleportation array, a team of Emperors stood guard year-round, protecting the array.

Of course, what outsiders saw were only hundreds of Dao Lord-level Grand Yan Immortals and one Emperor in black from the city lord’s mansion.

This Emperor team belonged to the White Tiger Temple and usually practiced within the White Tiger branch. They rarely ventured outside.

Even though the four major secret realms were chaotic, the chaos only reached the pinnacle. Emperors with weaknesses shivered at the sight of White Tiger Temple members and dared not cause trouble.

Those who dared to cause trouble possessed the strength of either a tier 5 or even a tier 6 Emperor.

At this moment, many powerful individuals came and went outside the teleportation array.

“So, this is Liuzhou!” A young man in a white robe, wearing a high crown, exceptionally dignified in demeanor but somewhat frivolous in behavior, remarked.

Though only a Grand Yan Immortal, his strength approached the threshold of a half-step Emperor. He was a distinguished figure in the sect, he was a Prince, with a noble status.

Following behind him were other outstanding figures from the sect, each possessing Dao Lord-level strength.

Among this group of handsome men and beautiful women was an elderly man who appeared the least conspicuous but held the strongest power—a

third-tier Emperor.

“Old Ge, I think Sharuo City is just so-so. It’s not as good as our Muyu City!’ The dignified young man expressed disdain for the ancient Sharuo City as soon as he spoke.

However, the elderly man, Old Ge, smiled with a kind expression, explaining, “Young Master, don’t underestimate Sharuo City. When the lord of Sharuo City roamed Liuzhou in the past, this place was bustling!’

“That’s all in the past!” The young master, with a hint of disdain, led the group down the teleportation array, casting a disdainful glance at the crowded surroundings.

Teleporting between cities was an expense they could afford individually, without crowding with those people..
