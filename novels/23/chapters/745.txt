Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and watched the “awl” draw closer.

Faced with this powerful strike, Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly. He casually brandished his Emperor Sword.

Luo Ao snarled. His eyes were scarlet. “Go to hell!”

The Demon Heart Spear Technique was Luo Ao’s trump card. It consisted of nine moves.

Although Luo Ao had only mastered the first three moves, the three strikes were extremely powerful.

But… Clang! Clang! Clang!

Three continuous crashes echoed through the sky.

Jian Wushuang only took three steps back before he regained his balance.

Luo Ao was stunned.?“How is this possible?”

Normally, even an expert at Step One of the Eternal Realm would need to use full strength to resist his strongest moves.

However, the boy, a One-star Ancient God, had withstood three strikes with ease.

“Is that your best move?” Jian Wushuang spoke.

“Huh?” Luo Ao was shocked. He nodded subconsciously.

Jian Wushuang sighed. “You’re too weak.”

“What did you say?” Luo Ao’s face darkened.

A Divine Realm expert dared to humiliate him, an Eternal Realm expert.

Although he had just reached the Eternal Realm, he was stronger than ordinary Divine Realm experts.

“The Secret Skill you displayed was good, but your Spear Principle is poor. You haven’t condensed the Spear Heart, so you can’t give full play to this skill.

“Six Steps of the Eternal Realm, you might not reach Step One of the Eternal Realm,” Jian Wushuang said in a flat toneless voice.

Eternal Realm experts were considered to be supreme existences in the Firmament Territory.

However, their strength differed.

There was a yawning gap between the strongest and the weakest.

It was said that Xuan Yi was the most powerful Eternal Realm expert and all the other Eternal Realm experts were in awe of him.

If an Eternal Realm expert had a full understanding of the Nine Occults of a Dao, he would have an opportunity to break through the Eternal Realm.

In other words, all Eternal Realm experts had fully comprehended an Origin Dao. And even if some of them had mastered more than one Origin Dao, their strength would not increase.

Their battle strength depended on their comprehension of Weapon Dao.

The Eternal Realm was comprised of six steps. It was equivalent to the six levels of Weapon Dao.

Each level brought a dramatic increase to their strength.

Furthermore, it caused their Sword or Saber Techniques to metamorphosize so that their overall strength surged.

Jian Wushuang had reached Level Two of Sword Heart, so he was able to make a breakthrough to Step Two of the Eternal Realm.

Luo Ao did not possess the Spear Heart, which meant he had not reached Step One of the Eternal Realm.

He was at the bottom of the Eternal Realm experts.

“I haven’t condensed the Spear Heart, but I’m still an Eternal Realm expert, far superior to you at the Divine Realm.” Luo Ao was infuriated by Jian Wushuang’s words. He attacked again with his long spear.

Jian Wushuang looked at his opponent with scorn.

Then he made a move.

His Sword Heart shook slightly, activating 10 percent of its power.

Now his strength had reached a new level.

“Secret Skill—Twilight!”

A cold sword light flashed across the sky like a shooting star.

Over the last 100 years, Jian Wushuang had made unprecedented progress. He had invented numerous Secret Skills, such as the Netherworld, which had unmatched offensive power.

Twilight targeted speed. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It unleashed the fastest strikes among the numerous sword moves that Jian Wushuang had invented.

The sword light flashed by ruthlessly.

Luo Ao looked ferocious, his eyes blazing with fury. But the next moment, he had no head.

The Eternal Realm expert was killed in a single strike.

“What?!”

Upon seeing this, the other two Eternal Realm experts, who were busy fighting the two Demon Gods, were petrified.

Gu Mian and Gu Wu also widened their eyes. They could not believe what had just happened.

With a look of indifference, Jian Wushuang waved his hand. He took Luo Ao’s Interspatial Ring and then charged toward the other experts.

“Oh, no!”

“Shit!”

The white-haired elder and purple-clothed lady were terrified.

The two Demon Gods had been difficult to deal with, but now there came another…

“Run!” the woman shouted.

“I don’t believe it,” the elder roared.

He did not try to escape, rather he turned to dive toward Jian Wushuang and slashed at him with his broadsword.
