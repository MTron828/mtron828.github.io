Chapter 1184: Change in Situation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Holy Master Cloud was born at the most ancient time when the Green Fire World had just been created.

Before, Jian Wushuang had only heard of this most ancient Holy Master, and it was the first time he had actually laid eyes on him.

“Are you Jian Wushuang?”

Holy Master Cloud cast a friendly gaze toward Jian Wushuang. “Not long ago, I hear that you’ve died. I was still privately mourning your ‘death’, but now I see that you’re alright. I believe that the people of the Gold Kingdom will be pulling their hair out when they know that you’re still alive.”

“You’re too kind, Holy Master Cloud,” said Jian Wushuang, seeming somewhat humble.

“Well, since the six Green Fire Palace Masters are present, let’s talk business,” said the Samsara Temple Master, his tone extremely serious.

“What happened, Palace Masters?” asked Jian Wushuang with a frown.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re our trump card, and ordinarily, I wouldn’t disrupt you from practice, but this incident concerns the survival of the Green Fire Palace and perhaps even the entire Green Fire World,” replied the Samsara Temple Master solemnly.

“It’s that serious that it concerns our survival?”?thought Jian Wushuang, secretly shocked.

“Look, Jian Wushuang,” said Holy Master Cloud as he gently waved his hands. An image immediately appeared in the Void at the middle of the temple hall.

It showed a vast, black Void with a huge portal. An ancient spaceship was traveling in the portal.

“What’s this?” asked Jian Wushuang in surprise as he studied the image.

“This shows the Void surrounding this battlefield and beyond the Green Fire World,” replied Holy Master Cloud in a low tone.

“The Void surrounding this battlefield?” Jian Wushuang asked, his eyes turning chilly. “There’s a portal there? And there’s also a spaceship flying toward us? Could it be that there’s another force arriving in the Eternal Chaos World?”

Jian Wushuang knew that three batches of experts from other worlds had descended upon this battlefield after the birth of the Green Fire World.

The first two batches of intruders were discovered and wiped out in time by the experts from the Green Fire Palace.

The third batch was the Gold Kingdom.

Now, from the scene depicted in the image, there seemed to be another force arriving at the borders of the Green Fire World again.

“Another force?” said the Samsara Temple Master as he shook his head slowly. “Jian Wushuang, maybe you don’t know yet, but the Spacetime of the battlefield we’re on is extremely unique. It’s actually a huge Spacetime vortex!”

“Spacetime vortex?” Jian Wushuang was extremely alarmed. “Could it be that the battlefield we’re on is wrapped within a huge Spacetime vortex?”

“That’s right,” said the Samsara Temple Master with a nod. “It’s a vortex of considerable size, but the Green Fire World—this battlefield included—have not been in danger so far even though we’re inside it.”

“Such vortexes are extremely frightening, and experts from the Eternal Chaos World have tried to avoid it all along. Who would court death by trying to charge through it? It’s also the same reason that for all these years, very few people have come to this battlefield.”

“The last few huge forces, the Gold Kingdom included, stumbled into the vortex by accident and arrived at the battlefield after somehow managing to survive.”

“So, that’s what happened,” said Jian Wushuang as he understood.

“No wonder the Eternal Chaotic World knew nothing about such a huge and valuable battlefield floating around here even after so many years. No real expert has even come here before.

“So, it turned out that this battlefield is situated within a Spacetime vortex.

“To the people of the Eternal Chaotic World, to encounter such vortexes would be akin to facing a natural disaster. Who would take the risk to go into one of his or her own accord?” he thought.

“This vortex is akin to a protective umbrella for the Green Fire World. We could dominate this battlefield for so long because of it.”

“Furthermore, many generations of experts from the Green Fire Palace have put in much effort and paid the price to integrate a huge formation in the Void surrounding this battlefield into the vortex!”

“This formation has been a pillar of support for the Green Fire Palace. Because of its existence, we can have real-time information once anyone steps into the battlefield, and we can get rid of him or her before he or she can even send out any message.”

“It’s also because of its existence that experts from the Green Fire World can leave the vortex to seek their fortune elsewhere.”

“Now, the spaceship you see in this image has bypassed the need to reach this battlefield via the vortex by creating a portal between the Void there and the outside world,” said the Samsara Temple Master with a serious expression on his face.

“To achieve this feat, not only does the person or people involved have to be extremely powerful and have access to many resources, most importantly someone on their side has to set up a formation within the Void to receive them.”

“An inside job?” said Jian Wushuang, momentarily stunned. He realized who it was in the next instant, however. “It’s the Gold Kingdom!”

A few Palace Masters together with Holy Master Cloud all had ugly expressions on their faces. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It was definitely not the work of an expert from the Green Fire Palace. None of them would spend so much effort and sacrifice so much to bring in force from the Eternal Chaotic World into the battlefield.

As such, the perpetrators could only be the experts from the Gold Kingdom!

“That is to say, the spaceship is carrying reinforcements from the Gold Kingdom!” said Jian Wushuang in a low tone.

“Yes, but to be more exact, they’re the main body of the Gold Kingdom,” replied the Samsara Temple Master.

“The main body?” asked Jian Wushuang, perturbed.

“The Gold Kingdom is a major force that has gained a firm foothold in the Eternal Chaotic World. Their monarch is a grand expert who has already surpassed Universe Master level and achieved leader level!” explained the Samsara Temple Master in a low voice.

“Five million years ago, the experts of the Gold Kingdom came to our world, but they accidentally arrived at this huge battlefield after going into the Spacetime vortex.”

“After their arrival, their experts realized that this battlefield was a huge treasure chest and tried all means to destroy our Green Fire World so that they could have it all for themselves. Luckily, there were not too many of them, and even though we didn’t manage to achieve a decisive victory in the life and death struggle with them, we still managed to withstand their attack.”

“Now, however, the main body of their army is arriving on that spaceship!”

“This battlefield is extremely valuable, and I bet the Gold Kingdom will send out many experts to secure it. It’s a possibility that even their monarch could be coming himself!”

“It’s a crisis of unprecedented scale for the Green Fire World, and our biggest fear. We hoped that the Gold Kingdom would never be able to pinpoint our location after five million years, or that even if they did, the Spacetime vortex would serve as a deterrent. But who knows…”

“Sigh, our greatest nightmare is finally upon us!”
