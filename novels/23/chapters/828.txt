Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the open space stood the six hundred and eighty experts who had passed the preliminary test. Jian Wushuang was among them.

The tall man stood above the void, looking down at them saying, “It’s impressive that you survived under my aura, however, don’t get too excited. You have simply passed the first round and the following tests will be far more difficult.

“Next, I’ll take you to one of the Royal Guard’s campsites, and you’ll have to battle the participants from other prefectures who have passed the preliminaries there. The winners of these battles will be able to join the Royal Guard.”

After saying this, the man turned to the blue-haired lady and asked, “Is the wormhole ready?”

“Yes.” The lady nodded.

“It has cost us so many Divine Gems to set up this wormhole in order to transport these people.” The tall man sighed.

“We have no other choice. It would take us several years to get there on foot with those participants following, that’s assuming that we don’t encounter any unexpected trouble on the way,” said the lady with a smile.

“Right. Let’s open the wormhole. I’ll personally take those people to the campsite.” The tall man ended the talking.

Soon, he led those participants to a huge wormhole, which could transport a hundred people at a time. The six hundred and eighty participants and some experts of the Blood Hades Prefecture were transported to the campsite in seven separate batches.

The campsite lay among endless ancient mountains.

When they arrived, many people from other prefectures were already waiting there.

The preliminary that was held in the Blood Hades Prefecture was aimed at eliminating the weaker participants.

In the following rounds, all superior Divine Realm experts from the thirty-six prefectures who had passed the preliminary would have to take the following tests together.

Those who had passed the preliminary of the Blood Hades Prefecture numbered around six hundred and eighty; the number from each prefecture was roughly the same. In total, there would be nearly thirty thousand participants included in the following rounds.

Moreover, all those candidates were obviously powerful, as they had passed the preliminary.

Standing in the crowd with other participants from the Blood Hades Prefecture, Jian Wushuang could not help pondering.?“The preliminary was an aura suppression and ended so quick. What will the second round of elimination be?”

As he was lost in thought, a group of people flooded toward them in a gold light from the void not far away.

They moved fast in a large group with an overwhelming aura. When they got closer, Jian Wushuang could see that they were, in fact, a group of soldiers in gold armor.

Each guard’s armor was engraved with the Golden-dragon Mark.

“They are the Royal Guards!”

“They’re the Royal Guards!”

“How powerful their auras are! Those soldiers are in the superior Divine Realm just like us, but I can tell that every one of them is much stronger than we are.”

Staring at the gold-armored soldiers, the participants were excited and their eyes sparkled.

Royal Guard, the strongest and most elite troop in the Tang of the East.

To be a member of this troop is what had driven all those participants to the campsite.

“Are they the Royal Guards?”?Jian Wushuang looked at the Golden-armored soldiers.

He could feel an overbearing aura from them.

Among those soldiers, he found that most of them were in the Divine Realm while some of them were in the Eternal Realm. He even managed to sense some powerful auras, which he knew he had to take seriously.

“Just as I have heard, the Royal Guard really does have some experts.”?Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

With his current power, he could battle a Six Steps of the Eternal Realm expert. In view of this, he could be among the stronger ones in the Royal Guard. Though not among the elite of them.

About a thousand people of the Royal Guard were present in the campsite, and their leader was a beautiful young lady, who was also dressed in gold armor, however, she had a killing intent between her eyebrows. Her eyes were chilling, her aura overbearing.

The lady greeted the commanders of each of the thirty-six prefectures before casting a cold eye over the thirty thousand participants.

In an icy voice, she spoke up, “Listen up, only one thousand of you will be able to join in our troop. That’s to say, the rest of you will be eliminated.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Her words electrified the participants.

Soon, the place was in an uproar.

These participants had all passed the preliminary held by their prefectures, which had fully demonstrated their power, however only one thousand of them will eventually be able to join the Royal Guard.

Too harsh!

The conditions of joining the Guard were indeed very harsh.

“The following tests are very simple.” The lady’s deep voice echoed once more.

“We’ll test your power!

“Wherever in the Tang of the East or the Eternal World, power speaks louder than anything. It’s the same in our Royal Guard. So, the following tests are aimed at finding the most powerful one thousand among you.

“By having you battle each other.”

“You are now standing in a special campsite of our Royal Guard, and a Restriction has been created for it.”

As the lady’s voice fell, a faint gold halo suddenly rose up surrounded the campsite and everyone in it.

“This Restriction is created by an excellent Formation-maker. Inside it, you can fight, free of the fear that you’ll be killed because this Restriction will protect your life by transporting you out of it before you get killed.

“However, being transported out also means that you’re eliminated.”

“And what you are required to do is to battle each other within the Restriction. Just don’t use the attacker or life-saving skill that uses the power of others. You can use any other means. Until only one thousand of you remain in the Restriction. Do you understand?”

The lady looked around after saying those words.
