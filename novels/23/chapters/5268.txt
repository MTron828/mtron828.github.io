Chapter 5267: Who Is in Favor, and Who Is Against?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Devouring Demons sensed the aura and frantically tried to escape, attempting to bypass Hu Qing and attack the city. But the long staff didn’t give them a chance; it swung again, obliterating countless Devouring Demons.

Hehe…

They began to feel fear!

This was unprecedented; even when they were slain, they had no regrets or complaints. But now, they were afraid.

They were afraid of the aura emanating from Hu Qing.

Demon suppression!

On the city wall.

Countless people were shocked!

Hu Qings power erupted instantly, unbelievably strong; this was not just comparable to an Emperor but a true Emperor-level powerhouse.

In a single breath, he slaughtered millions.

In the time it took to finish a cup of tea, there wasn’t a single Devouring Demon left.

Ji Chaoyang stood on the city wall, staring blankly at Hu Qing.

The aura was very unfamiliar, making him wary.

“Hu Qing,” Ji Chaoyang tentatively called out.

Outside the city, Hu Qing put away his staff. Once the golden hoop was on, it couldn’t be removed anymore.

With it on, thoughts of aversion to evil filled Hu Qings mind.

This hatred wasn’t directed solely at the Demon Lord but at all the miscellaneous Devouring Demons.

All those fragments of consumption deserved to die.

Turning his figure, he arrived at the top of the city wall. When he saw Ji Chaoyang, he nodded faintly, reverting to his former demeanor.

After he didn’t notice anything wrong, Ji Chaoyang finally breathed a sigh of relief.

This city wall of theirs was probably the fastest to end the battle among all the Original Planets!

Once the first was done, there would be a second.

However, no matter how fiercely they fought now, they couldn’t attract the attention of the Qishen Temple. Because at this moment, within the cosmic sea of the Qishen Temple, there was an overwhelming sense of death.

The four main temple leaders arrived in person, accompanied by three guardians.

Seven tier 6 Emperor-level powerhouses.

In the outside world, let alone the Original Universe, even in the vast River of

Time, they could dominate. Currently, within the River of Time where the Original Universe resided, there wasn’t a single peak-level universe powerhouse; these tier 6 Emperor-level beings truly stood supreme.

Apart from these individuals, there were also over 2,000 elders who had been teleported here.

All the elders assigned to the four temples had gathered.

They exchanged glances, saying nothing.

Meanwhile, the seven guardians were seething with rage.

“True Spirit, Lord Zhen Ling, this matter goes against the rules. There are too many deviations from the orders set by the master. We find it hard to comply!” declared Bai Yi, the leader of the White Tiger Temple.

Among the four temples, he was the one advocating for an assault!

Although they had been constantly suppressing and subduing the four major secret realms, their strength remained formidable. Bai Yi had once killed a rebellious tier 6 indigenous Emperor in one of these secret realms.

His words carried significant weight.

Zhu Yi controlled the vast treasury of the Original Realm, Long Yi was in charge of operating the Qishen Temple, and Xuanwu Yi remained the most enigmatic, establishing his base in external worlds.

Xuanwu Vi controlled over a hundred domain realms, with ten of them turned

into powerful puppet worlds. No one knew just how many formidable puppets he had created.

Not only puppets, but he was also a supreme master of formations, surpassing the previous Divine Masters.

These four were the true core of the Qishen Temple, holding almost all of its treasures.

As for the guardians, they looked at each other.

They possessed nothing except their combat prowess.

Lord Zhen Ling twirled his beard and glared, then waved his sleeve, shouting,

“It’s broad daylight, and you’re holding a lantern. What are you looking at?”

The guardians hunched their bodies, attempting to speak, but they were interrupted by Lord Zhen Ling.

“Do you know what you should do?” Zhen Ling asked, his voice cold.

“l do. I am here to guard the master’s physical body,” the Guardian replied.

Zhen Lings face grew even colder. “So you are aware of your identity, then?”

“Yes, I am. I am a Guardian,” the Guardian responded, somewhat puzzled by Zhen Lings tone.

“Oh, so you do know,” Zhen Ling sneered. Then his expression turned stern. “If you know, why are you still standing here? Go back to the God’s Tomb and wait for further instructions.’

Her furious command sent shivers down the spines of everyone present.

Many among them keenly sensed the aura Zhen Ling had just released – the aura of the universe’s origin source, a tremendously powerful one. It belonged to a pinnacle figure in the universe, the ‘Universe Master’.

The Guardian trembled inwardly, his form bending lower. Without a word, he vanished into the cosmic sea.

Once the three Guardians had retreated, Zhen Lings expression softened. She turned to the four main Hall Masters and a smile crept onto her face.

“Cough, they are just a few servants. Please forgive their ignorance!” Zhen Ling, in an unprecedented move, actually bowed respectfully.

This surprising gesture left the Temple Masters astounded, secretly wondering what scheme the old Zhen Ling was plotting this time.

Seeing the strange smile on Zhen Lings face, even the elders could not help but shrink back involuntarily.

Even those Guardians, once the personal guards of the Qishen, found themselves without a voice. Now it seemed like they were on Zhen Lings side, and the establishment of the ‘Elder Palace’ could benefit them. At least, they would have authority in the future.

Not that they dared to object; even if they had the courage, they wouldn’t confront Zhen Ling. They stood firmly on her side.

The First Seat of the White Tiger Temple, Temple Master Bai, looked pale but resolute. Despite his fear, he spoke up, “Zhen Ling, our master established the core when he created the Four Temples. That cannot change!’

The other Temple Masters followed suit, echoing his sentiment.

“I understand. I never intended to change that. However, the Qishen Temple needs additional power now. These elders have shed blood and risked their lives for the temple. It’s time for them to be revived and regain their vitality, settling back into the Four Great Secret Realms.”

“And establishing the Elder Palace can’t be delayed!’

“Having said my piece, who is in favor, and who is against?”

Zhen Ling spread his hands, facing thousands of elders on one side and the established core of the Four Temples on the other. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As soon as she spoke, a palpable tension filled the air.

The elders were excited; they were unequivocally supportive. But the Four Temples… they hesitated.

Zhu Yi stepped forward, the first to voice her stance. “l will follow the Master’s will.’

Upon hearing this, Temple Master Bai of the White Tiger Temple snorted coldly and disappeared, leaving the scene.

“I have no objections either!” Long Yi lacked confidence, and he didn’t have many followers.

He wasn’t as strong-willed as the White Tiger Temple, didn’t have the confidence of Zhu Yi controlling the treasury, and didn’t have the profound foundation of Xuanwu Yie

Originally, he was strongly opposed to this matter.

The four temples, as the core, had been the rule for many years. Now, with the sudden addition of the Elders’ Palace, wouldn’t this lead to division within the Qishen Temple?

But facing the powerful Zhen Ling, he could only bow his head.

Xuanwu Yi, standing at the back, revealed a faint smile, nodded slightly, and counted as agreeing.

“Three to one, this matter is settled. Since Bai Yi questioned my command, let him go to the God’s Tomb and guard the old master’s physical body!’

With a light, airy sentence, Zhen Ling exiled the White Tiger Temple to the desolate God’s Tomb.

Among the four great secret realms, the God’s Tomb was the most mysterious and also the most barren..
