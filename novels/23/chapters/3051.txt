Chapter 3052: Three Paths

——

In the Treasure Pavilion, a secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“Lord Sky Shuttle.”

Jian Wushuang stood in front of the Golden Light Shadow, Sky Shuttle.

“What do you need?”

Lord Sky Shuttle’s voice was still cold and emotionless.

“I want to ask how many sacred elixirs are needed to exchange for the second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual,” Jian Wushuang said.

The Gold-splitting Secret Manual had always been of great use to Jian Wushuang.

The reason why Jian Wushuang had made such great progress in the space-time principles and sword principle was related to the Gold-splitting Secret Manual.

However, there were four volumes of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He had only obtained the first volume, which perfectly dissected the first and second stages of the space-time principles. However, the third stage of the space-time principles, the first volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual, only dissected a part of it, he had only dissected a part of it, but he had not dissected a large part of it.

Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the space-time principles had reached the third stage. The first volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual was obviously not enough to satisfy his needs, of course, he wanted to get the second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual.

“The second volume?” Lord Tianshou looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise, then he said, “The second volume, the Gold-splitting Secret Manual, is indeed within the scope of authority of a heaven-level member, but it requires a total of eight billion sacred elixirs!”

“Eight billion?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Previously, the first volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual was worth 800 million sacred elixirs.

Now, the second volume required eight billion sacred elixirs, which was a tenfold increase!

8 billion sacred elixirs was an astronomical figure for him before.

But now, he had the gift from Xue Bei, so he was confident.

Moreover, the Gold-splitting Secret Manual was very helpful to him, so it was definitely worth the price.

“Sir Tianshou, I have a treasure here. I don’t know how many sacred elixirs it can be exchanged for.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out a Universe Crystal.

At first, Sir Tianshuo did not seem to care about it. However, when he saw what Jian Wushuang took out, his expression changed.

“Universe Crystal!”

Sir Tianshuo was indeed the Treasure Pavilion’s weapon spirit. With just a glance, he had recognized the Universe Crystal. “You have a Universe Crystal? This can only be found in the Universe Battlefield!”

“Sir Tianshuo, how many sacred elixirs can I exchange for this Universe Crystal?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Sir Tianshuo gave Jian Wushuang a deep look. He did not ask how Jian Wushuang had obtained the Universe Crystal, instead, he answered directly, “Universe Crystals are very rare in the Divine Beginning World. Even among Principles Masters, very few are able to take out a Universe Crystal. Its uses are also very broad. Under normal circumstances, one Universe Crystal can be exchanged for billions of sacred elixirs. You are a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. With your authority as a heaven-grade member, I can exchange this Universe Crystal for 7.5 billion sacred elixirs.”

“7.5 billion?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Previously, Xue Bei had said that it would be no problem for one Universe Crystal to exchange for five billion sacred elixirs, which meant that Universe Crystals were worth more than five billion sacred elixirs. Now it seemed that it was true.

“One Universe Crystal can be exchanged for 7.5 billion sacred elixirs. If I add in the resources I obtained from the massacre in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, I can directly gather eight billion sacred elixirs.” Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised.

Xue Bei gave him 10 Universe Crystals.

However, he knew that Universe Crystals were extraordinary. Jian Wushuang would not exchange them for sacred elixirs unless it was absolutely necessary.

Now, in order to get the second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual, he was willing to exchange for one. As for the second volume, he would not exchange for it if he could.

“Sir Tianshuo, there is an interspatial ring with many sacred elixirs and a lot of resources. Its value is definitely not less than 500 million sacred elixirs. With this Universe Crystal, I can get 8 billion sacred elixirs. I want to exchange for the second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

Sir Tianshuo took the interspatial ring and glanced at it briefly. Then he nodded slightly and said, “Sure, what else do you need?”

“I also need a file about the third heaven,” Jian Wushuang said again.

…

An hour later, in the Hall of the secret lair, Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, sat in front of a table. In his hand, he was carefully reading a file, there was a basic introduction to the third heaven, as well as a specific way to get to the third heaven from his current territory.

“According to this document, there are three ways to get to the third heaven from the endless territory,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

The first of the three ways was to travel alone. There was a detailed star map of the territory and some spatial passages that could be used as transit.

However, the territories near the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow were all remote in the endless territories. The geographical location was also very far from the third sky. If a True Saint traveled by foot alone…it would take tens of thousands of years to reach the third sky. Even if there were some transit space passages in the middle that could reduce a lot of time, it would still take hundreds of years at the very least.

Using this path to reach the third sky would cost the least, but it would be the most troublesome.

The second path was to directly go through the wormhole and reach the endless territories.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance was one of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning Realm. Moreover, it was the most powerful one. Its influence spread to every corner of the Divine Beginning Realm. Every secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance had a space passage leading to the third sky, through this space passage, one could reach the third heaven from the endless territory in less than 15 minutes.

However, although this path was the fastest and simplest, the cost was the greatest.

After all, the farther the distance, the more expensive it would be to teleport. For example, Jian Wushuang usually had to pay a great price to travel from one territory to another in order to complete the tasks of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and that was only for the close distance.

If he was far away, even in the endless territory, he would have to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of sacred elixirs to teleport.

This was the case in the endless territory alone, and it was even more expensive to teleport from the endless territory to the third heaven. It would cost a total of two billion sacred elixirs!

Two billion sacred elixirs…although Jian Wushuang still had a total of nine Universe Crystals on hand, and any one of them could be exchanged for 7.5 billion sacred elixirs, he did not want to exchange them easily.

Moreover, two billion sacred elixirs were too high a price for single teleportation, so this path was also rejected by Jian Wushuang.

In this case, there was only one last path left.
