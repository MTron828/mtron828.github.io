Chapter 5467 ¬†Origin Source Recognition

Emperor Zhutianj's gaze was intense as he briefed Jian Wushuang on matters of comprehension. Afterwards, Jian Wushuang sought a secluded place to cultivate alone.

The success in Dongsheng was indeed a tremendous encouragement for them: either succeed or meet one's end.

10,000 years seemed too short for those peak-level tier 5 Emperors.

Even an epoch was acceptable for them, as long as there was hope.

Currently, their hope lay in the Origin Source reaching the realm of the black hole.

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment, shook his head. These people had hope, but he truly had none.

If reaching the realm of the black hole could be accomplished, he needed to focus on refining the Extreme Dao directly and then embark on the pursuit of the Sword Dao. With both paths perfected, he could prepare for the Dao Merge.

Although they had no assurance of breaking through the Black Hole realm, he had the capability to reach fifty thousand times the power of the divine body. Moreover, he had not yet obtained the token, and everything for them was still a long way off.

Comprehending the Origin Source of the Universe, gaining recognition from the Origin Source of the Universe, would allow him to obtain a token from the Demon Sound Hall and randomly acquire some treasures.

As for those treasures, he didn't really care much. According to Emperor Zhutian, they were given based on time. The faster one gained recognition, the more treasures they received.

The most crucial item was the token itself, as it contained a trace of the Universe Origin Source, allowing continuous comprehension.

On this point, Jian Wushuang was not lacking. There were too many Origin Sources on the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard for him to comprehend. He could even devour them to strengthen his Extreme Dao.

Although the amount was small, it was still flesh!

The Origin Sources on the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard were too powerful; he couldn't even devour some of them, and there were even some he couldn't comprehend.

Obtaining a trace of the universe Origin Source to devour was nothing short of excellent.

Emperor Zhutian, spending hundreds of years, could gain the acknowledgment of the universe's Origin Source. He estimated a shorter timeframe.

Ascending the mountain swiftly, he reached the summit and comprehended the universe's Origin Source.

To gain recognition from the Origin Source was simply a matter of deepening his understanding on the existing foundation.

Jian Wushuang found an open space, sat cross-legged. It was his first time contemplating at such a close distance, and the progress was rapid.

Much more effective than sitting idle in his cave.

The faint sound of demonic melodies surrounded Jian Wushuang. Immersed in it, he felt as if he had returned to the days of sword practice.

In the past, sword practice was a matter of every breath and every millimeter. Now, utilizing the essence of the Sword Dao, he could unleash millions of swords with a single breath.

Unconsciously, he executed his past sword techniques. A miniature figure floated on the Sea of Origin Source, practicing the ancient sword art.

The Dao is at its simplest.

He indeed gained many insights.

However, most of his focus remained on the universe's Origin Source. Gazing at the magnificent source, he couldn't help but drool at the thought of devouring it.

If he could swallow this Origin Source, he might directly grasp the realm of black holes.

Regrettably, he could not devour it.

Back when Shan Jun was present, even when confined, he could take down the Origin Source for Jian Wushuang to devour.

Once he succeeded in integrating the Dao and possessed Shan Jun's strength, he would definitely try.

Thinking of Shan Jun reminded him of the karma on his body.

Too much.

First, he had to seal the karma and resolve the cause and effect. In this calamity, he was bound to face it.

HIs only choice was to break free of it.

He wondered if Hu Qing had the ability now, but Hu Qing's path was not the orthodox Buddhist path but a path of Zen, offering little help.

"How about Tongtian Buddha?"

Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Actually, there was no need to focus on those few individuals from the Original Universe; one could entirely seek solutions within the Four Great Secret Realms.

To the west!

In the extreme west of the Heavenly Realm, the Daxing Buddhist Dao.

He could go there.

On the journey, another goal emerged.

Once, the thought of merging with the Dao seemed distant, but now it was getting closer.

The breakthrough in the Sword Dao was related to Gong Miaoyi and Nie Yuan. The breakthrough in the Extreme Dao was connected to the realm of black holes, both having clear directions.

Only a breakthrough opportunity was missing.

Once they all reached the point of completion or perfection, he had to merge with the Dao.

Whew!

A breath was expelled, shaking the trembling Origin Source.

Hum!

For others, this sound was familiar‚Äîit was the sound of recognition from the Origin Source.

It had only been a few years, and Jian Wushuang himself hadn't expected it to happen so quickly.

Emperor Zhutian in the distance slightly opened his eyes, showing shock and envy in them.

However, he just nodded at Jian Wushuang without speaking, continuing to meditate with closed eyes.

Jian Wushuang was overjoyed as he received the token that floated from the Origin Source and felt the aura above.

It was more than he had imagined. The sliver of cosmic Origin Source that Shan Jun gave them initially was not as much as what was on the token.

After obtaining the token, there was no need to continue contemplating. Although contemplation aided cultivation, he didn't care much about that bit of assistance.

Holding the token, he thought of directly devouring the Origin Source within it. However, upon second thought, if he truly devoured the Origin Source within, it would probably be impossible for him to enter the Demon Sound Hall in the future.

After all, one needed this token to enter.

"Never mind, let's leave this place for now!"

The help from the Demon Sound Mountain was limited, and although cultivation here was faster than in the cave abode, after years of seclusion, Jian Wushuang had little left to improve. What he needed now were some powerful opportunities.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to leave, another tier 5 Emperor stood up and headed towards the Demon Sound Hall.

Since time was not an issue, Jian Wushuang stopped in his tracks, ready to see if the other could pass through.

The other tier 5 Emperors also opened their eyes when they saw someone attempting the challenge.

The success of Dongsheng was indeed stimulating to them.

"Wanyan, have you reached the black hole realm too?" Emperor Zhutian's eyes were deep, somewhat incredulous. Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

They had known about Dongsheng's divine body being at 50,000-fold, but they were unsure about reaching the black hole realm.

Now it seemed that reaching at least the black hole realm in spatial Origin Source was necessary to break through.

Wanyan, the tier 5 Emperor, didn't say much, only revealing a slight smile.

Reaching the black hole realm was not that easy.

It wasn't necessary to reach the black hole realm to pass through.

Whoosh!

As the token entered the Demon Sound Hall, the six guardians, who were already waiting outside, opened their eyes, and the battle began the moment they did.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang's eyes focused, surprised at the scene.

This tier 5 Emperor named Wanyan, although unfamiliar to him, seemed to practice the Origin Source of Shadow Dao based on his methods.

His figure was extremely elusive, instantly transforming into countless shadows, each shadow possessing the same strength as his main body.

This was even more abnormal than his supreme physique, undoubtedly a unique and extraordinary Great Dao.

"The Kill Formation of Myriad Shadows!" someone exclaimed!

Then everyone looked over.

Jian Wushuang was not quite clear about the opponent's ultimate technique, so he listened carefully to the discussions among the other Emperors.

"I didn't expect him to reach the level of Myriad Shadows. In our space, there are probably no more than three experts who have reached the level of Myriad Shadows, and all of them are tier 6 Emperors. How did Wanyan reach such a level?¬†Isn't he just a tier 5 Emperor?"
