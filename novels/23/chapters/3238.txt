“Du Jiu is dead!”

“Quick, take his interspatial ring. The Blood Wave Token must be in his interspatial ring.”

“The Blood Wave Token is mine. Whoever dares to snatch it from me will be killed!”

The experts who were originally surrounding and killing Du Jiu immediately went crazy after Du Jiu died. Numerous burning gazes swept across the void in front of them. In the next moment, they froze on the interspatial ring Du Jiu had left behind.

“Over there!”

Many figures instantly swarmed forward. The one who rushed at the front was the remaining Invincible Saint.

This Invincible Saint was Saint Purple Dragon. His strength was average among the Invincible Saints, and he was not famous in the Divine Beginning Realm. However, now that Du Jiu died, he should be the strongest among the experts present, he was also the one who had the best chance to get the Blood Wave Token.

“We’re close. We can get the Blood Wave Token soon.” The Saint Purple Dragon with long blood-red hair and a wicked face had an unprecedented gleam in his eyes as he watched Du Jiu’s interspatial ring getting closer and closer to him.

However, just when he appeared in front of the interspatial ring and was about to take it away, a hand suddenly reached out from the void and grabbed the interspatial ring. Then, it was taken back.

This scene made Saint Purple Dragon’s eyes crack!

“Put it down!”

With a roar, Saint Purple Dragon did not care who was in front of him, and he swung the sledgehammer in his hand at lightning speed.

The sledgehammer contained an aura that could destroy heaven and earth. It streaked across the space and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and the Blood Mountain Sword turned into a bolt of blood-red lightning and swept out with a shocking evil aura.

It was the Peerless Sword manual, Xi Xiang!

When Jian Wushuang used the three secret skills at the same time, the power of this move was extremely terrifying.

Bang!

With a loud sound, your Saint Purple Dragon’s body shot out, and he sent two people flying in the process.

After a long while, the Saint Purple Dragon finally managed to stop.

“Who is it?” The Saint Purple Dragon raised his head and looked at the void in front of him.

He was sent flying with just one blow. He did not know his opponent’s actual strength, but in terms of strength and power, he was sure that he had reached the level of the True Saint List.

With Saint Purple Dragon’s gaze, he immediately saw Jian Wushuang’s appearance.

“He looks like…Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Saint Purple Dragon’s pupils could not help shrinking.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“The Heavenly Sword Marquis who could not even defeat the experts of the three Saint Realms, the Light King, and the Nine Temples Saintess?”

“It’s him. He was the one who defeated Du Jiu’s divine body in a sneak attack.”

“The Blood Wave Token has fallen into the hands of Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

Many experts on the field looked at Jian Wushuang in unison. Although their eyes were burning with greed for the interspatial ring in Jian Wushuang’s hand, no one chose to attack immediately.

After all, Heavenly Sword Marquis was too famous.

“Everyone, Du Jiu’s Blood Wave Token has fallen into my hands. Do you want to snatch it from me again?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but there was no fear in his voice, there was only indifference and absolute confidence. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, these experts frowned deeply.

Of course, they coveted the Blood Wave Token, but no matter how much they coveted it, they had to have the strength to snatch it.

Previously, the Blood Wave Token had fallen into Du Jiu’s hands. Although Du Jiu’s strength was not bad and his life-saving ability was not bad, with so many of them working together, they had the ability and great chance to kill Du Jiu or force him to hand over the Blood Wave Token.

But against Heavenly Sword Marquis…

After all, Heavenly Sword Marquis was an existence that even the combined efforts of the experts of the three Saint Realms, Light King, and Nine Temples Saintess could not do anything to.

The move of time-space teleportation alone was enough to allow him to run amok in the Blood Wave Realm.

Now, all the forces in the Divine Beginning Realm recognized that he had the best life-saving ability among the Immortal Saints!

If they wanted to take the Blood Wave Token from Jian Wushuang, they would have to kill him. It was impossible.

Therefore, although Jian Wushuang was alone and in front of them when they saw him take out the Blood Wave Token and put it into his interspatial ring, they remained silent!

From the beginning to the end, no one made a move.

The Saint Purple Dragon was also silent and did not make a move.

“It seems that you don’t intend to fight for it. In that case, I’ll take my leave.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and disappeared in a flash.

Not long after Jian Wushuang left, whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

One figure after another rushed to the battlefield, but by the time they arrived, the fight for the Blood Wave Token had ended.

“What’s going on? Who obtained the Blood Wave Token?” A cold voice came from a middle-aged man in a snow-white robe.

There was a flame mark on the middle-aged man’s forehead, and he felt extremely violent and violent!

“Sir,” Saint Purple Dragon said with a hint of respect, “the Blood Wave Token that was just created was taken by the Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis? Is he Heavenly Sword Marquis of the Temporal Temple? Is he a rank six True Saint?” Flame Emperor asked.

“Yes, but unlike before, he has reached rank seven True Saint, so his strength is obviously closer. We were trying to kill Du Jiu, but we couldn’t do anything to him in a short period of time. Heavenly Sword Marquis killed Du Jiu’s divine body with one strike. After Du Jiu died, his interspatial ring fell into Heavenly Sword Marquis’ hands,” Saint Purple Dragon said.

“That’s troublesome.” Flame Emperor frowned.

He was ranked 15th on the True Saint List and was very strong. However, no matter how strong he was, he was helpless when he heard that the Blood Wave Token had fallen into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

“Although Heavenly Sword Marquis is not very strong, his life-saving ability is widely recognized as number one. Even if he appeared in front of me and asked me to kill him, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to kill him, let alone get the Blood Wave Token.”

Thinking of this, he could not help but sigh, “I have no choice. I can only wait for the next Blood Wave Token to appear.”

He quickly left.

At the same time, the third Blood Wave Token that appeared fell into the hands of Heavenly Sword Marquis. This news quickly spread throughout the Blood Wave Realm.

After receiving this news, all the experts within the Blood Wave Realm felt a trace of helplessness in their hearts. They no longer had any thoughts or thoughts toward this Blood Wave Token.

After all, treasures were meant for the capable.
