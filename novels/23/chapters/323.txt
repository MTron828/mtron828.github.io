Chapter 324: The Tricolor Hyaline Vine

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The legendary Extreme Yin Body was extremely powerful. Once it took form, it would have the power to destroy the world.

But it had a disadvantage. It could not bear even a hint of Yang Qi. Therefore, the owner of the Extreme Yin Body had to ensure that she remained a virgin. Once she had sex with someone, her Extreme Yin Body would immediately ruin her, and she would be doomed to die.

The one who had sex with her would gain a lot.

Ye Chen used some tricks to get Su Rou to join their valley. Then he spent a lot of energy looking after Su Rou so that she would be loyal to him. Everything he had done was aimed towards getting Su Rou’s Extreme Yin Body.

“I have raised and pampered her for more than 10 years. In only Eight days, it will be time for her to repay me.” Ye Chen stood there with a distorted smile.

The white-haired elder beside him wore a faint smile, without saying a word.

...

As the young master of Ice Nether Valley, Ye Chen was the most outstanding genius among this year’s disciples. The news that he invited experts from every force or sect to his wedding had spread throughout the whole Nanyang Continent.

Ye Chen had a good reputation in the Nanyang Continent. Moreover, he was the young master of Ice Nether Valley. Thus, the experts from each force or sect would give him face and attend his wedding.

Though many solitary warriors did not receive the invitation, they could still come to the wedding. Ice Nether Valley spread the news that they would welcome everyone on the wedding day.

That was why a large number of warriors traveled to Ice Nether Valley.

There was a city near the mountain gate of Ice Nether Valley.

The gate would be opened on the day before the wedding. Many solitary warriors, who arrived ahead of time had gathered in this city. Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei arrived here two days in advance.

They were sitting by the window in a hotel.

“A lot of people came here.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the crowd in the street. There were some powerful experts and they all came for this wedding.

“Hum, a crowd of people who just came here for fun,” Chi Mei, who sat opposite Jian Wushuang, snorted and said, “Ice Nether Valley invited all the powerful forces to the wedding. Many experts only came here in hopes of catching a glimpse of some powerful experts.”

Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

For some weaker warriors, it would be good luck to see the legendary top experts who had reached the Half-saint level or Divine Transcendence. They rarely had the opportunity to meet those top experts, but this time they would see many of them on the wedding day.

“Swordsman, let’s go to the market,” Chi Mei suddenly said.

“Market?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise, “Is there anything good there? Are you interested?”

“Hey hey, you don’t know that. Some treasures might not be in the top experts’ hands. Sometimes, if they are lucky, some weak people can get invaluable treasures that even I would be envious of,” Chi Mei replied with a mysterious smile.

“This time, lots of experts have gathered in this city. Some of them will sell their treasures. If we’re lucky, we might find something good.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and showed interest.

Then they left the hotel and walked along the street towards the market.

Jian Wushuang wore a bamboo hat, to cover his face, and withdrew his aura.

Chi Mei also hid his aura at the request of Jian Wushuang. His ability to restrict his aura was marvelous. Even experts who had mastered Domain would not be able to recognize his strength. They might think he was an ordinary servant or a steward.

Both of them walked down the street without arousing any attention.

Soon they arrived at the market.

“You’re right. It’s quite lively here,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, while noticing lots of people crammed in the market.

The market was quite crowded, and some warriors were selling their treasures.

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei roamed freely, looking at the treasures once in a while. Most of the treasures were quite normal, so Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei were not interested. After an hour, Jian Wushuang still had not seen a treasure that he even slightly cared about.

At this moment…

“Hum?” Chi Mei’s eyes lit up. He pulled Jian Wushuang’s sleeve and said, “Swordsman, look at that.”

Jian Wushuang saw a half-naked strong man standing there with a Three-colored Spiritual Vine in his hands. The man was surrounded by many warriors.

“That is...” Jian Wushuang looked toward the Three-colored Spiritual Vine and asked.

“If I am not wrong, it should be a Tricolor Hyaline Vine,” Chi Mei licked his lips and replied, “It is a rare Natural Treasure and used widely. It is often used to refine high-level elixirs, such as the Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir and the Saint Breakthrough Elixir. They all need the Tricolor Hyaline Vine.

“But the Tricolor Hyaline Vine is rare and invaluable. We’re lucky to see it here.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He did not know how precious the Tricolor Hyaline Vine was, but it was an ingredient in the top elixirs, so it must be priceless.

“Let’s have a look.”

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei walked forward.

The strong man shouted. “Three Divine Power Elixirs and one million drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. No bargaining. I spend a lot of effort to get this Tricolor Hyaline Vine. If not for an emergency, I wouldn’t be selling it here.”

“Three Divine Power Elixir and one million drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid?” Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei were surprised. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Divine Power Elixir was used to improve a Yang Void experts’ cultivation. It was effective and its price was high. A Divine Power Elixir cost a million drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.

“If the Tricolor Hyaline Vine is put up for auction, it would sell for 10 million drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. But he only wants three Divine Power Elixirs and a million drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. It’s a bargain,” Chi Mei said with a faint smile. Then he walked forward.

“I want this Tricolor Hyaline Vine.” Chi Mei spoke. “But I only have two Divine Power Elixirs. I can use a million drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid instead and give you two Divine Power Elixirs with two million drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. How about it?”

The strong man frowned.

Before the strong man could think, a light voice suddenly was heard. “Ha-ha, a Tricolor Hyaline Vine, good stuff. I want it!”
