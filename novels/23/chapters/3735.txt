Chapter 3736: Tyrant Axe

Supreme True Treasures were precious to begin with.

Supreme Flight Type True Treasures were enough to make people go crazy.

After hearing that a Supreme Flight Type True Treasure had been born, many great beings on the Third Continent went crazy. Countless great beings, including those Rulers who were adventuring on the Third Continent, rushed over at the fastest speed, regardless of whether they were far from the place of birth or close to it, regardless of whether they were close or far away from the place of birth.

For a time, the location of the blood-red vortex became the focus of the entire Red Cloud World.

“The speed of the emergence of the black wings is too slow.”

Although Jian Wushuang was the first to arrive at the place of birth, as time passed, when two-thirds of the black wings broke free from the blood-red vortex, there were already more than 500 experts gathered around.

More than 500 people, although they were all Principles Masters, could not pose a threat to Jian Wushuang. However, the number of them could not be completely ignored by Jian Wushuang.

Moreover, the black wings still had not fully emerged. There was still an endless stream of experts arriving from all directions.

Although Jian Wushuang was only a Principles Master, he was undoubtedly the focus of attention of all the Principles Masters present.

“It’s Blood Sword Master!”

“Damn it, Blood Sword Master is actually here. Now it’s going to be very difficult for us to fight for the black wings.”

“Humph, even if Blood Sword Master is as powerful as a Ruler, it won’t be so easy for him to get the black wings later.”

Many strange gazes swept over Jian Wushuang from time to time.

There were more than 500 Principles Masters present. Some were strong and some were weak. There were also a few who had reached the pinnacle of the six realm.

However, everyone knew that Jian Wushuang was the most terrifying of them all. When the black wings fully emerged, fighting over them would be the greatest threat to these Principles Masters.

“These Principles Masters are all very wary of me.” Jian Wushuang sensed the gazes around him and could not help narrowing his eyes.

He had no choice. His previous battle with Pupil Master had made him famous.

Now everyone knew that his battle strength was comparable to that of a Ruler, or even an Advanced Ruler. It was definitely not something that an ordinary Principles Master could compare to.

Since everyone present was only a Principles Master and no Ruler was present, he was naturally the most eye-catching one.

“It will take some time before the emergence of the wings. Although more experts will arrive during this time, I’m confident that I can obtain the black wings if only a Principles Master arrives and not a Ruler-level expert. I’m afraid that a Ruler will arrive.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Jian Wushuang was not worried about the number of Principles Masters unless they were like the Blood Saber Emperor, who could unleash the strength of an ordinary Ruler in a short period of time.

These Principles Masters would not be able to stop him now.

However, it would be different if a Ruler-level expert was present.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed. “Damn it, what I’m afraid of comes true.”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked to the side. His soul power had already sensed an extremely powerful aura and was rushing over at a terrifying speed. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In just an instant, he appeared around the blood-colored vortex and a golden figure slowly appeared.

It was a tall man wearing golden armor, boots, and carrying a golden axe on his back.

This tall man’s eyes were long and narrow, and his eyes were suffused with a faint golden light. When he arrived near the blood-colored vortex, he glanced at the black wings that were slowly breaking out from the core of the blood-colored vortex, and his eyes instantly lit up, a hint of fanaticism appeared on his face.

“Tyrant Axe!”

“It’s Ruler Tyrant Axe!”

“He actually came as well.”

When the surrounding Principles Masters saw this person, they immediately began to stir.

Many people looked at the golden figure with fear and respect in their eyes.

Ruler Tyrant Axe was also a famous and powerful Advanced Ruler in this Star Field. He was also the leader of a force.

“I was worried that there would be an expert at the Ruler level here, but now there’s an expert at the Advanced Ruler level.”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened at the sight of the arrival of the Ruler Tyrant Axe.

An Advanced Ruler was qualified to stop him.

He was not confident that he could defeat the well-known Ruler Tyrant Axe in a head-on battle, let alone fighting for treasures.

The reason why the Ruler Tyrant Axe had such a name was that his axe skills were extremely powerful and terrifying.

“It seems that I’m quite lucky. There are six or seven people who live in the Third Continent, and I’m the first one to arrive at the place where the flying Supreme True Treasure was born.” Ruler Tyrant Axe’s soul power swept through the surrounding void, he did not sense any other Ruler’s aura.

Although there was no Ruler, there was still one aura that he could not ignore.

“Is this kid the Blood Sword Master?” The Ruler Tyrant Axe fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked at him as well.

Their eyes met, creating a faint electric spark in the void, but that was it.

The black wings had not yet been born, and there were so many Principles Masters around, so they naturally could not fight first.

“Humph, I heard that Blood Sword Master defeated Pupil Master and forced him to flee. He is quite capable, but Pupil Master is only a primary Ruler, but I’m different.”

“Blood Sword Master, I hope you don’t block my way later, or else...” A sneer appeared on Tyrant Axe’s lips.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had the same thoughts as him.

The black wings that were about to break free from the blood-red vortex were the most powerful Flight Type True Treasure. Jian Wushuang was determined to obtain it.

Even if the Tyrant Axe Ruler was present, Jian Wushuang would not be afraid. If the Tyrant Axe Ruler stood in his way, Jian Wushuang would fight him to a draw.

At the bottom of the blood-red vortex, 80-90% of the black wings were already exposed. They were about to be completely revealed.

At this moment, more than 700 Principles Masters had gathered here. Some of them were astonishingly famous and powerful, fortunately, other than Ruler Tyrant Axe, there was no other Ruler present.

Beside the blood-colored vortex, more than 700 experts were staring at the bottom of the vortex, staring at the black wings.

Everyone was waiting for the black wings to come out completely.

Finally, the last part of the black wings broke out of the blood-red whirlpool, and the entire black wings rose up.

At the same time, the majestic aura of the Supreme True Treasure swept out instantly.
