Chapter 1273: Mr. Zhuge!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Kid, how… dare you!!! ”

The black-robed man’s angry voice echoed throughout the battlefield and stunned everyone there.

They could not help thinking,?“Jian Wushuang has defeated Universe God Lei Ming because of his power. What has that got to do with courage?”

However, when Jian Wushuang heard the man’s words, he narrowed his eyes.

“Mr. Zhuge!”

Universe God Wu and Universe God Lei Ming came up to the black-robed man.

“Lei Ming, you’re a Universe God, yet you have lost to a Universe Master?” Universe God Wu said in a low voice.

“I didn’t know that the kid is so strong even if he is just a Universe Master!” Universe God Lei Ming looked frustrated.

For him, losing to a Universe Master would definitely be a lifelong disgrace.

“Jian Wushuang.” Universe God Qian Luan came over to Jian Wushuang and praised him, saying, “I looked down on you before because I didn’t expect you to be so powerful.”

“You are giving me too much credit, Universe God Qian Luan.” Jian Wushuang replied in a humble tone.

“Let’s talk about it later.” Universe God Qian Luan looked ahead and her eyes became cold. “Zhuge Qiu, today, does your Holy Prefecture want to interfere in our matters as well?”

“Zhuge Qiu?” Jian Wushuang quickly recalled the name in his mind.

Zhuge Qiu was an expert from Holy Prefecture and was extremely powerful among the Universe Gods in the First Heaven. He was near the top of his level and was even more powerful than Universe God Qian Luan and Universe God Wu.

“I have no interest in the battle between you and Xiu State,” the black-robed elder Zhuge Qiu replied directly.

“Mr. Zhuge?” Universe God Wu and Universe God Lei Ming were taken aback by his words.

Zhuge Qiu had come here in order to help them. What did he mean when he said that he was not interested in their affairs?

“Hump, although I’m not willing to intervene in this matter, there is a person that I must take away today,” Zhuge Qiu continued.

“Take one person away? Who is that person?” Universe God Qian Luan asked.

“Him!” Zhuge Qiu pointed at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and suddenly he understood.

“He is our Seventh Divine General. Why do you want to take him away?” “He is our Seventh Divine General! Why do you want to take him away?” Universe God Qian Luan shouted.

“Why?” “Because he killed one of the core disciples of Holy Prefecture!” Zhuge Qiu’s voice was cold.

“What?” Universe God Qian Luan was amazed.

The other cultivators, including Universe God Wu and Universe God Lei Ming, were stunned as well.

Zhuge Qiu stared at Jian Wushuang closely and asked, “Kid, you’re Jian Wushuang, right?” “You should know why I want to take you away.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Great.” Zhuge Qiu continued speaking coldly. “We have in total about 20 Core Disciples in our prefecture and each of them is well-trained with a talent in refining elixirs, weapons, or making Formations. They are all extremely rare geniuses.

“These core disciples have also cultivated a unique Secret Skill. Once they are killed, their grievances will be attached to their murderers and only the experts of our Holy Prefecture can sense that grievance. I can sense a dense grievance of our core disciple from you. You must have killed one of our Core Disciples not long ago. Am I right?”

“Yes, right.” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“It seems that you are not worried about the consequences of killing our Core Disciple?” Zhuge Qiu’s face darkened.

“Since he is already dead, why should I worry?” Jian Wushuang answered.

“You are really not bothered at all, are you?” Zhuge Qiu’s voice became icy and he turned to Universe God Qian Luan. “Universe God Qian Luan, you have heard this boy admitting his crime, so, it’s reasonable if I take him to the Holy Prefecture, isn’t it?”

“This…” Universe God Qian Luan frowned before continuing, “No matter what Jian Wushuang has done before, he is now the seventh Divine General of our Scarlet Island. You can take him away after getting our permission. I will report this matter to our Lord and with his consent, you can then take Jian Wushuang away.”

“So, I have to receive permission from your lord first?” Zhuge Qiu sneered and continued, “Sorry, I can’t wait for your lord to arrive here to give his permission. I’m going to take this kid away now. If you dare, you can try to stop me.”

Universe God Qian Luan’s face darkened at his words.

Right then, Jian Wushuang chimed in with a mocking tone. “Zhuge Qiu, shouldn’t you ask me whether I’d like to go with you first?”

“Ask you first?” Zhuge Qiu looked toward Jian Wushuang again.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “You speak as if you could take me anywhere you want. I don’t think that’s true. “Zhuge Qiu, I am here and I really want to see how will you take me away today?”

Everyone around was stunned when they heard this.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang was trying to challenge Zhuge Qiu.

“How dare he provoke Mr. Zhuge. He is courting his death!” Universe God Wu looked at Jian Wushuang with pity in his eyes.

“Hump, does he really think that he is invincible after beating me??“Mr. Zhuge is near the peak of the First Heaven and Jian Wushuang is just a Universe Master. How dare he?”?Universe God Lei Ming also sneered.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Zhuge Qiu narrowed his eyes and a smile played around the corners of his mouth.

The smile was as sharp as a blade.

Swish!

Without any warning, Zhuge Qiu made a direct move.

He shot out and reached for Jian Wushuang, like a black flowing light before everyone could react. Then, he punched Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

His power overwhelmed Jian Wushuang, who was flung aside and smashed into the ground, creating a huge pothole.

The move was so sudden that it was some time before everyone realised what had happened.

“So fast!”

“Too fast!”

“Is Jian Wushuang dead?”

A sudden exclamation could be heard on Leopard-print Island.

“Zhuge Qiu!” Universe God Qian Luan was enraged.

“Hump, that kid was courting death. He has no one to blame but himself.” Zhuge Qiu flicked his sleeves, looking indifferent.

But right then… Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

The ground of the island suddenly cracked and a figure rose to the sky. It was none other than Jian Wushuang.

His aura was still strong and there were no injuries on his body.

“What?”

“He is not injured at all?”

The people on the island were very surprised.

Even Zhuge Qiu was a little amazed.

“Zhuge Qiu!”

Jian Wushuang’s icy voice echoed all around, but there was no anger in him; instead surprise and excitement could be seen in his eyes!

He felt as if his blood was boiling inside him.

“Haha!! ”

“Great!! ”

“Finally, you have come!! ”

Jian Wushuang laughed wildly.

The other experts, including Zhuge Qiu and Universe God Qian Luan, were stunned by Jian Wushuang’s wild laughter.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of excitement. He stared at Zhuge Qiu and said, “You are the first person that I’ll be going all out to fight with after I entered the Eternal Chaotic World.”

Jian Wushuang’s icy voice echoed all around and his fingers danced on his Blood Mountain Sword, which was quivering at that moment.

His sword was already thirsty for blood.
