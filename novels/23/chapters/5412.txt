Chapter 5411 ¬†Turtle Spirit Island Lord, Gui Ling

They returned in defeat!

No, this time, they not only lost their feathers but also ended up in a sorry state.

Kun Tai led his people to leave first, and Luo Chuan informed his master, 'Turtle Spirit Island Lord', that there was no need for the members of the Demon Army to stay; it would only bring shame.

As the time for a cup of tea passed, a massive turtle shell appeared. Even before its arrival, the spiritual consciousness had descended.

On the enormous turtle shell, there was a human face, with kind and benevolent features!

Luo Chuan quickly bowed respectfully, "Master."

There was no need for him to explain in detail; The Island Lord of Turlte Island, whose name was Gui Ling, manipulated the space of heaven and earth, dividing and examining it carefully.

"Come back with me!" Island Lord Gui Ling's voice carried great authority. Jian Wushuang and the others had already been noted, but with the space damaged, it was impossible to find many clues.

However, supreme Eternal Treasures were scrutinized carefully.

The Bloodfall Crystal!

An ancient cave mansion!

These needed further investigation; such powerful eternal treasures couldn't be so simple.

Luo Chuan dared not refute and followed the turtle shell back.

Meanwhile, Island Lord Gui Ling's true form stayed behind.

Except for him, someone else had arrived here.

The newcomer was a tier 5 Emperor, leaving no mark in ancient times, and without any name in the Four Great Secret Realms. However, his strength made even tier 6 Emperors bow their heads.

"Island Lord!"

"An Inheritor!" Island Lord Gui Ling's tiny eyes flickered. The ancient cave mansion was evidently not as simple as Jian Wushuang and the others had imagined.

The top-notch inheritors among them all mobilized.

Even Kun Tai, who had left, was unwilling. When he returned to Turtle Spirit Island and was contemplating whether to report the matter, he learned that the eldest prince, Luo Sha, had already made a breakthrough, reaching tier 5. Moreover, upon emerging from seclusion, he had reached the peak of the tier 5.

Not hesitating any further, Kun Tai directly reported the matter.

Luo Sha frowned.

The lord of Turtle Spirit Island had gone, and he didn't dare to contend for it. But with the reputation of the Mo Luo Nation, how could he not go?

He immediately gathered a large army and set out to battle in the Redwood Sea Region.

In the Black Demon Sea.

The world sank.

On a desolate small island, the bones of sea monsters covered the ground. The sky was shrouded in ominous dark clouds hanging low, seeming as if you could touch them by raising your head, but in reality, they were thousands of meters above the ground. The water in the sea turned black under the gloomy clouds.

That's how the Black Demon Sea got its name.

Jian Wushuang and the other two sat cross-legged on the broken mountain of the small island, each recovering their strength.

Bai Junwang was doing fine; he had an abundance of Origin Source, but his divine body and physical body were too weak.

Fortunately, Gong Miaoyi had obtained treasures left for him by Gong Yun in the mansion, several hundred billion godstones accumulated by the Stellar Pavilion over countless years. Some of them belonged to other powerful beings who had stored their treasures here.

Now, all of it had been taken by Bai Junwang to enhance his physical and divine bodies.

Originally, Bai Junwang intended to wait for Shen Ling to bestow him with a divine body. However, he had just received earth-shattering news.

The divine body and the physical form both exist, but he needs to retrieve them himself, and as for their location, it's all determined by fate.

This statement made Jian Wushuang sneer for quite a while.

Gong Miaoyi, on the other hand, used all her time to enhance her control over the Bloodfall Crystal, resulting in a noticeable improvement in her strength.

In order to suppress her, Bai Junwang had to quickly enhance his own strength.

Jian Wushuang recovered quickly, and a trace of his consciousness clone remained long-term within Gong Miaoyi, comprehending the meaning of Ultimate Dao within it.

Especially the word "Suppress". Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

The profound meaning contained within it was deep.

Sword Dao!

Jian Wushuang carefully grasped the insights; he unexpectedly sensed the Sword Intent from Gong Miaoyi's Origin Source, even though she wasn't a practitioner of Sword Dao.

The spatial Origin Source clearly contained the illusions.

How could there be a Sword Dao Origin Source in Gong Miaoyi's Origin Source?

The only plausible explanation would probably be that her father was a Sword Dao expert, at least an Emperor.

That would make sense.

He didn't bother with all that, just focused on comprehending.

Just a single word "Suppress" allowed him to grasp many pure Sword Dao Origin Sources.

For the eighth level of the Ultimate Sword Dao, there was finally a faint understanding.

After the Heaven's Punishment Sword Strike, it was Mighty Suppression!

After Mighty Suppression, what comes next?

Jian Wushuang shook his head. He hadn't figured out Suppress yet, so he couldn't look too far ahead.

This time in cultivation was truly immersive!

The three of them progressed together, unaware that they had spent a thousand years cultivating on this deserted island.

They paid no attention to anything outside.

Being top-tier experts, closing in for a million or even a billion years at a time was not considered long.

Many Emperors, during a crucial seclusion, could span several epochs.

Of course, most of them utilized time acceleration.

Just like Jian Wushuang.

The time in the time house, multiplied by a thousand, wasn't too expensive.

Outside, a millennium could be a million years inside, and a million years of cultivation might just be a moment of enlightenment, making it feel like no significant time had passed.

During this time outside, however, there were earth-shattering changes.

Mo Luo's country launched a massive attack, flattening Redwood Island, annihilating Stellar Pavilion, and imprisoning all the high-ranking officials.

Dozens of tier 5 Emperors stationed in the Swirling Sea.

The island lord of Turtle Spirit Island personally sat in command.

Apart from these people, inheritors arrived.

Zhen Wuyang even had a great battle with the Island Lord Gui Ling.

That ancient cave mansion was shattered, indicating its significant involvement.

It wasn't just because of the top-notch Eternal Treasures.

Though rare, top-notch Eternal Treasures weren't enough to attract Inheritors, especially several of them at once.

In the end, both sides agreed to issue a wanted notice for Gong Miaoyi and two other mysterious Emperors.

They were searching for the whereabouts of the Bloodfall Crystal.

In the Swirling Sea.

Several palaces faced each other from a distance.

While they were referred to as representatives of two powerful factions, aside from the Island Lord of Turtle Spirit, there were also powerful figures from Mo Luo's country.

Although the Grand Elder didn't come, they sent several tier 5 experts, indicating their stance.

On the side of the inheritors, besides Zhen Wuyang, there were also Jian Wushuang's familiar acquaintances, Tongtian Buddha, and Wanderer Chishui.

Before entering the Qishen Temple, they were all at the top-level tier 4. Only Chishui Traveler reached the peak-level of tier 4.

And now, all three were tier 5 peak-level experts.

Their strength was extraordinary. One Zhen Wuyang alone could compete with a tier 6 peak-level expert like the Island Lord of Turtle Spirit Island.

Although the Gui Ling had some reservations, in terms of real combat power, these three working together made the Gui Ling truly not an opponent.

In the hall where the Inheritors gathered.

Zhen Wuyang sat in the high seat, favored by Zhen Ling this time. Zhen Ling had informed him in advance about the opportunity here, but realizing that one person couldn't seize it all, he invited Tongtian Buddha and Chishui. Naturally, he was the initiator this time.

"Brother Zhen Wuyang, the three of us are already sufficient. There's no need to look for others. It's just an old guy who has become a king of the beasts. The three of us are more than enough to handle it!" Chishui was very confident, but of course, he also feared calling in others, which would mean less for each of them.

Zhen Wuyang considered many factors in his actions. Unlike Chishui, who had been a lone ranger for a long time, he thought about everything.

Tongtian Buddha, sitting on the other side, kept smiling without saying a word. He had no objections to this matter; whatever way they wanted to do it was fine.
