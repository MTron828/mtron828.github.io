Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang obtained the inheritance of the First True King, which was already considered incredibly fortunate, not inferior to some of the Inheritors on the Grave God Mountain.

Although he hadn’t acquired the inheritance of that True King yet, it was already within his grasp.

“Second Brother, as good as the ancient times may be, the present is equally if not better!” Wu Zuo said meaningfully, “Do you know, what is the true core of the Qishen Temple?”

Jian Wushuangs eyes immediately lit up, but he dared not inquire directly. Instead, he vaguely replied, “The core? Selecting Inheritor?”

It was just a probing question.

However, Wu Zuo’s eyes gleamed, and he began talking about something unrelated to the Qishen Temple.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“The giant egg inside the Three Kings Hall, you should be aware of it!”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had always had a speculation, whether it was true or false. It seemed that today he was going to get an accurate answer.

“That giant egg gave birth to a powerful being, and this powerful being has some connection with you!”

Jian Wushuang was greatly surprised. He had indeed guessed right. Wu Zuo continued, “Could it be that Shen Ling?”

“It is him. Initially, Master instructed a Divine Master to suppress the Three Kings Court. Fuego perished, the Three Kings fell, but the existence that emerged from the giant egg was suppressed in the Qishen Temple. He is the one who orchestrated behind the scenes, manipulating Bai Junwang to ensnare you!” Wu Zuo explained in one breath.

This was within Jian Wushuangs expectations.

Although his expression showed surprise, deep down, he had anticipated it and was not overly shocked!

Just wondering why Wu Zuo would bring up this matter.

Could it be because of the appearance of Fuego?

That’s also a possibility.

Later, Wu Zuo confirmed his thoughts.

The appearance of Fuego posed a great threat to the Qishen Temple, and he had to be eliminated.

But now, they couldn’t find the opponent, not even with Zhen Ling.

Jian Wushuang was somewhat puzzled and asked, “Since there’s a threat, why plant this trouble in the first place?”

Based on his deduction of Shen Lings strength, at most, he was just a half-baked Universe Master. With such a weak existence, how could Qishen of the past have taken notice?

They could have just killed him directly, or thrown him into the starry sky to lie low. Why bother suppressing him within the Qishen Temple? Wasn’t that asking for trouble?

A giant egg caused the destruction of the Three King Courts and brought out Fuego, this super powerful being. Even if the Qishen wasn’t afraid of this force, they didn’t need to keep suppressing him!

Unless there was a tremendous benefit.

Wu Zuo was momentarily unsure of how to answer; in fact, he wasn’t very clear on why it was done this way!

All of this was told to him by Zhen Ling, all for the purpose of winning over

Jian Wushuang.

“Well, I’m afraid the old man has other plans. In any case, it’s highly beneficial!” Wu Zuo vaguely responded.

However, Jian Wushuang remained steadfast in his belief. If the formidable beings of the Qishen considered it highly beneficial, then the other party must be extraordinary.

A single egg could actually cause the destruction of the Three King Courts.

Fuego and Shen Ling were not experts from the Moro Temporal Space, but they came from the depths of the starry sky. There probably lay even greater secrets there.

But Jian Wushuang was unaware of it at the moment.

Wu Zuo saw that the timing was about right. He had said what needed to be said and now began to approach the matter indirectly, trying to discern Jian Wushuangs current sentiments.

“The appearance of Fuego is a calamity for the Qishen Temple. Now, we need a chosen one to suppress this calamity!” Wu Zuo finished speaking and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows slightly. Deep dovvn, he felt something was not right. Could he be the chosen one?

After all, Fuego was a Universe Master who had not yet fully recovered to his peak state. Even at the beginning of his recovery, Jian Wushuang wasn’t a match for him, let alone now.

Even if he successfully merged the Dao, he was still far from being a match!

“Well… ” Jian Wushuang hesitated.

“Don’t rush to answer!” Wu Zuo personally poured him a glass of wine and continued, “When I heard Lord Zhen Ling say this, I also found it unbelievable. Normally, in the face of such a formidable enemy, we should go first, but guess what Lord Zhen Ling said?”

Without waiting for Jian Wushuang to respond, Wu Zuo revealed it directly. “Lord Zhen Ling said directly that you are the protagonist of this era!”

“Everything in the Qishen Temple from now on is within your grasp. You are the heir the Qishen Temple is searching for across time and space!”

Wu Zuo became more and more excited as he spoke, He wasn’t trying to deceive Jian Wushuang; it was Lord Zhen Ling who had said so himself. predicting tne ruture:

Jian Wushuang stood up directly. The impact of these words on him was too profound.

He found it hard to believe himself.

“Brother Wu Zuo, these words must not be spoken lightly. On Grave God Mountain, there are many with greater potential than me, and Senior Shang has already reached the supreme-peak realm. He is more capable than I am!” Although he said these words, deep down, Jian Wushuang was ecstatic.

He had always had this feeling that the Qishen Temple seemed to be meant for him.

He was destined!

Wu Zuo also stood up slowly, patted Jian Wushuang on the shoulder, and said, “Brother Wushuang, some things are destined early on. Even if you fight with all your might, there won’t be a good outcome. I swear by the laws of heaven that everything I just said is what Lord Zhen Ling said. If there’s a half-truth, I’ll be struck down by the Nine-Colored Divine Thunder!”

As these words were just uttered, a dark cloud faintly appeared above the cosmic sea of the Qishen Temple.

Zhen Ling blinked his pea-sized eyes, touched his nose, sensing that something was amiss there, but paid no attention to it. He sat alone in front of the chessboard, contemplating how to deal with that figure, Fuego.

Now that the game had already begun, it was a matter of when the opponent would make a move.

This time, once the opponent appeared, he would be there in an instant, directly killing them and eliminating this threat.

“Fuego? Frolasa? Hmph!”

As for Jian Wushuang on the other side, the words just spoken by Wu Zuo didn’t seem like lies!

Moreover, daring to swear to the Heavenly Dao, it couldn’t be baseless!

Jian Wushuang now truly believed it.

He even felt a bit dazed.

No wonder Zhen Ling had given him the personal belongings of the Qishen Temple; it turned out that he had been recognized as the Inheritor of the Qishen Temple long ago.

In the midst of things, it was all the will of heaven.

He was the biggest gainer in the Three Kings Court.

This probably also had Zhen Lings secret support.

If Zhen Ling knew that Jian Wushuang was thinking this way, he would probably admire himself.

It’s good that Jian Wushuang dared to think.

It’s just that he didn’t know why Zhen Ling insisted on waiting for him to complete the Dao Merge before going to the Grave God Mountain.

Now that he had received the treasures sent by Wu Zuo, he felt that there might be an explanation. Perhaps Zhen Ling was likely to temper him, as the path of a strong person could not be too smooth.

Then Wu Zuo began to talk about Fuego.

The more Jian Wushuang listened, the more unbelievable it became.

“Am 1 to be bait again?” he questioned.

Wu Zuo consoled him, saying, “It’s not exactly bait. The other party wouldn’t dare to threaten you. When Fuego revived, it was because of the Origin Source you refined for Bai Junwang. If Fuego wants to restore his strength, he will definitely come to you!’

Jian Wushuang hesitated; the last time, he was kidnapped by Bai Junwang, wasting a considerable amount of his time..
