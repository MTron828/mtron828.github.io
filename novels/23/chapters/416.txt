Chapter 417: Triple Shift

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How could it be possible?”

“How could he have made such rapid progress in such a short period of time?”

Dong Ming was shocked.

He clearly remembered that he had been able to overpower Jian Wushuang a few months ago, though the latter had the help of his Realm.

“How had Jian Wushuag reached the Peak of Stage Three so quickly? How could he become even stronger than me?”

Dong Ming was unaware that Jian Wushuang had not yet condensed the Origin Mark in their last exchange. With the Origin Mark, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength had increased several times and now exceeded his.

“I’m in big trouble!”

Having realized the full extent of Jian Wushuang’s battle strength, Dong Ming’s face fell.

It had only been a minor inconvenience for him to be trapped in the Realm when he was stronger than Jian Wushuang. But now that Jian Wushuang’s power had grown, the Realm became a nightmare.

Jian Wushuang rushed forward and brandished his sword to attack Dong Ming. The latter barely managed to parry the strike.

“Run, I have to run quickly!”

With a trace of madness in his eyes, Dong Ming looked desperately for an opportunity to flee.

“Dong Ming, are you expecting to escape from my Realm? You must be kidding,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Damn!”?

Dong Ming swore under his breath.

Dong Ming was close to the Top of Stage Three in terms of battle strength and had excellent power, speed and defensive ability. He would not be afraid to challenge some experts at the Peak of Stage Three, who were even stronger than Jian Wushuang.

After all, he would still be able to escape if he failed.

But Jian Wushuang... his Realm was too strong and too unpredictable.

Experts in the Inner Area had already made judgments on Jian Wushuang’s Realm. Someone much stronger than Jian Wushuang could outclass or compete with him even when trapped in his Realm.

Otherwise he would need special skills to survive. For example, Wind Demon could easily escape from Jian Wushuang’s Realm with his extraordinary speed.

These were the two types of people who could calmly face Jian Wushuang’s Realm.

Others were doomed to die in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Dong Ming was far weaker than Jian Wushuang and he had no special abilities. His death loomed large before him.

“No, no!”

Dong Ming’s face was distorted with fury and panic. His continual attempts to flee were thwarted by Jian Wushuang. Dong Ming grew desperate.

He could not escape.

He was completely crushed by Jian Wushuang. As the attacks continued to rain on him, he grew too exhausted to resist.

The only thing waiting for him was death.

“I won’t, won’t accept it!”

Dong Ming roared in anger and gathered the last of his energy and to make his final struggle.

“Won’t accept it? You were quite arrogant the last time you met me,” Jian Wushuang sneered. He vaguely remembered that Dong Ming had mocked him a few months ago.

Furthermore, Dong Ming was from the rival camp. Jian Wushuang would not show him mercy.

Finally, Dong Ming’s resistance broke down. Jian Wushuang’s sword pierced his chest in a killing blow.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and retrieved Dong Ming’s Interspatial Ring. He glanced at the treasures in it and broke out into a smile.

“Great, he has lots of treasures, even more than the two Stage Three experts I killed earlier. There are even two Blood Gems,”??Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up with pleasant surprise.

In the Interspatial Ring, there were two Blood Gems and plenty of treasures and Raw Gems.

More importantly, the ring contained Dong Ming’s ID token.

“Another 1000 battle achievements. Now I have 4000 battle achievements,”?Jian Wushuang held Dong Ming’s ID token in his hand and curled his lips.

Before entering the Inner Area, he had adventured in the Outer Area with Sir Axe, Lei Dao, and the others, where he had killed a 10-member team on his own. Though they had just been Stage Two experts and were worth only 100 battle achievements each, he had obtained 1000 battle achievements in that fight.

During the half a year in the Inner Area, he had fought many times and killed two Stage Three experts using his Realm Technique. That earned him 2000 battle achievements.

By killing Dong Ming, he now owned 4000 battle achievements.

“There was a manual in the Treasure Vault list that I couldn’t afford. But now it seems that I’ve earned enough battle achievements to redeem it.”

Jian Wushuang laughed and left the Inner Area, heading for the campsite of Drifting-blood Marquis.

He passed through the Inner Area and Outer Area in a hurry. His journey was uneventful and he did not encounter any challengers. A few days later, he arrived at the campsite of the Drifting-blood Marquis.

It was bustling with activity, as it always did.

Jian Wushuang entered the campsite Treasure Vault and glanced casually at the grey-clothed elder sitting there.

Jian Wushuang perused the treasure list. A few?moments later, he found the manual he sought.

Triple Shift?, a first-grade manual!

Although first-grade manuals were rare and precious in the vast Divine Land, there were a few of them in Drifting-blood Marquis’s Treasure Vault. However, most of them were incomplete. The only complete one was?Triple Shift?.

It was much stronger than?Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt?, which Jian Wushuang had cultivated.

“My biggest advantage is the Blood River Realm superimposed by Road to the Underworld and Tenfold Realm. Once the Realm is released, I can choose to fight or escape a battle. However, experts who have excellent speed can easily escape from my Realm,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

His Blood River Realm was not invincible either.

For example, Wind Demon, the first expert he had met in the Inner Area, had managed to flee from his Blood River Realm. This was because he had been too quick, making it impossible for Jian Wushuang to kill him.

At that time, Jian Wushuang had been impressed and envied Wind Demon’s speed.

If he wanted to elevate the use of his Realm, he needed to move faster.

Triple Shift?would help him meet this requirement.

Triple Shift?had three levels, and?its first level would enable him to travel 100 miles in a?single breath.

Being able to perform the astonishing feat of traveling 100 miles in a breath by studying this manual demonstrated its great worth.

It was not easy to acquire a first-grade manual such as this. It would cost him 4000 battle achievements.
