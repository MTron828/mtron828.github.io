Chapter 264: Throw him out

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Spar with me?” an interested smile showed on Jian Wushuang’s face.

Jun Yi explained, “Take it easy, I just want to have a competition with you in martial arts, nothing to do with Cultivation of Spiritual Power.”

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Sparing when one ventured outside was normal. Besides, the white-robed woman–Jun Yi–standing in front of him was humble. It was hard to refuse her.

“Okay, please.” a cyan long sword showed in her hands.

“Sir, be careful!”

After she had said that, wow! In a second her figure turned into a sharp sword, breaking through the void and hurtling at Jian Wushuang. The sword light seemed to penetrate everything.

Seeing that, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help marvelling at Jun Yi’s outstanding mastery of Sword Principle.

He moved and brandished his Triple-kill Sword casually. An ordinary move hit right on the sword edge of Jun Yi’s long sword and deflected her attack instantly.

Then three more moves went towards Jun Yi?in succession.

It horrified Jun Yi. She brandished her long sword and barely managed to block those attacks, while her body took a few steps backward.

“His swordsmanship is so fast.” Stabilising herself, Jun Yi looked over at Jian Wushuang, “I have to go all out to beat him.”

As soon as she finished saying this, a mighty sword essence burst from her. It turned into a fog, coming at Jian Wushuang.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang looked at the grey fog with confusion. The next moment he felt traces of killing intent from it, but he found that he was trapped and couldn’t move.

“Such a strange skill.” Jian Wushuang was shocked by this.

Jun Yi attacked again, bang! Her body suddenly flew at Jian Wushuang, then her long sword turned into a flowing light rushing towards him at an amazing speed.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly and lifted up his long sword, in which a trace of the Origin of the World was contained. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Clang!

Jun Yi’s cyan long sword was knocked off, and her body was also beaten back.

Coming to a stop, Jun Yi looked at Jian Wushuang with shocked eyes, “Though I have used Sword Realm, I still lose completely. His swordsmanship is so strong!”

“What’s the skill of turning sword essence into fog?” suddenly Jian Wushuang asked her.

“Sword Fog.” Jun Yi told him, “one move of Sword Realm, which is a Sword Principle secret in Daluo Heaven Sect.”

“Sword Realm?” Jian Wushuang felt curious.

It was so special. Trapped in the fog, he found it hard to move. If he didn’t use his Origin power, he could not defeat her so easily.

“You said that you were a disciple of Daluo Heaven Sect. I am just about to go there, would you mind leading the way?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Both Jun Yi and the green-haired maiden behind her smiled.

They thought Jian Wushuang was going to Daluo Heaven Sect to learn and it was a good thing especially after they saw that he was quite good at Sword Principle.

“We welcome you, please follow us.”

Jun Yi said this, then she and the green-haired maiden led Jian Wushuang along. Soon they came to an old sect.

Located at the top of a mountain, the old sect was magnificent, much larger and awe inspiring than those Jian Wushuang had seen before.

Led by Jun Yi, Jian Wushuang wasn’t stopped by the gatekeepers of Daluo Heaven Sect. They came to a hall.

“Please wait here for a minute.”

After saying this, Jun Yi and that green-haired maiden left. A while later, Jun Yi and a black-haired elder came.

“Jun Yi, is he the one you told me who is much stronger than you in Sword Principle?” the black-haired elder looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jun Yi nodded, then she said to Jian Wushuang,”Swordsman, this is our Law-enforcing Elder, Elder Qiu Ying.”

“Oh, Law-enforcing Elder? ” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He knew there were Law-enforcing Elder in older sects, such as the Law-enforcing Elder in Wilderness Sword Sect. They were more like senior servants dealing with affairs of the sect, but they were actually not the top executives of the old sects.

There was House of Elders in these old sects, and these elders were top powerhouses and the core of an old sect.

“Nice to meet you, Elder Qiu.” Jian Wushuang said politely.

“Make yourself at home.” Qiu Ying waved his hands and sat on a chair in front of him casually, “Jun Yi said that your swordsmanship was good, judging from your age, you came here for a coach, right?”

“No,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and replied.

“No?” Jun Yi was surprised, and Qiu Ying frowned as well.

“What are you coming for?” Qiu Ying asked.

“I was asked by someone to visit Ling Han, the Ninth Elder of Daluo Heaven Sect. Is he here?”Jian Wushuang said.

“The Ninth Elder?”?Qiu Ying’s face changed, looking Jian Wushuang up and down, then sneered, “young man, is Elder Ling Han someone you can see if you want to? Even it were me, I see him only a few times every year.”

“I was asked to see him, besides, he would have been told that I would come.” Jian Wushuang said with a calm voice.

“Enough!” Qiu Ying shouted in a deep voice, he sneered, “young man, how could you boast without shame at such a young age, Elder Ling Han does not know you and apparently, you are here to make trouble. Throw him out!”

“Elder Qiu.” Jun Yi was a little worried.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly.

Qiu Ying was kind before he knew that he didn’t come here for a teacher but was looking for Elder Ling Han.

Two disciples outside the gate came in.

Seeing that, Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold, then he sneered, “I didn’t expect that the Daluo Heaven Sect would treat a guest like this, I will leave.”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t in the mood to explain. He stopped just before leaving.

“By the way, this is the token, proving that I have come and kept my promise, but you didn’t believe it.”

Jian Wushuang threw the token which Wang Yuan gave him to Qiu Ying, then he left directly.
