Chapter 1804: Whose Head

“Mister Wushuang, the formation is controlled by these formation pearls. Fifty-thousand years ago when the formation first blended in the Spacetime Storm, the power wasn’t strong. But as time went by, the formation became more and more ferocious. Now, it has even become the biggest reliance of Green Fire World and also Green Fire World’s most lethal tactic,” Palace Master Yuan said.

Palace Master Yun had been in charge of controlling many formations in Green Fire Palace before the war with Jin Kingdom fifty-thousand years ago until then.

Palace Master Yun also knew the changes that the huge formation brought to the entire battlefield the best.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows when he heard what Palace Master Yun said.

Jian Wushuang could understand when he had mentioned the biggest reliance but how had it become a lethal tactic?

“Mister, you can move your consciousness into the formation pearl to control the formation,” Palace Master Yun said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and followed Palace Master Yun’s instruction. He spread his soul power and moved them into the formation pearls. With the formation pearls, Jian Wushuang quickly took control of the entire formation. The moment he controlled the formation, his heart quivered.

“Spacetime Storm!”

“This formation could move about the strength of Spacetime Storm?”

Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

Including the Spacetime Storm around the battlefield, the Spacetime Storm definitely had the power to destroy everything.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had thought his master Xuan Yi had only created the formation to blend into the Spacetime Storm in order to stop outsiders from enter with the aid of Spacetime Storm.

Jian Wushuang had always thought it was so.

But then, Jian Wushuang had realized that the formation had already almost taken full control of the Spacetime Storm!

With the formation, he could move about the strength of Spacetime Storm. Just how terrifying was the power?

“Lethal tactic, no wonder it could be referred to as a lethal tactic!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands together.

He also understood why Devil Church had had scruples with Green Fire Palace back then. They were worried about the formation!

“It’s a pity that the Spacetime Storm has balanced. Once we use the formation to move about the strength of the Spacetime Storm, it will lose balance entirely. By then, it will destroy heaven and death, which means the end of the world. Unless there’s a day where the formation can gain full control of the Spacetime Storm completely. However, I wonder how long it will take until there’s that level of control,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Palace Master Yun by the side also said, “The formation has yet to evolve to its maximum, it still has space for improvement. But before that, unless we intend to meet death together with our enemy, we won’t use this lethal tactic.”

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Oh yeah, Mister Wushuang, as you are controlling the formation, you can look at the battlefield via the formation. Take a closer look, you might be surprised,” Palace Master Yun smiled mysteriously.

“Surprised?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had been wandering in Eternal Chaotic World for so long and he was even listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

He had even watched a battle between ancient experts. What else could surprise him?

With curiosity, Jian Wushuang started looking around.

With the formation, Jian Wushuang could immediately see the entire ancient battlefield.

The ancient battlefield was vast, boundless!

Jian Wushuang reckoned that even if he were to plunge through the battlefield at his full speed without hindrance, he wouldn’t be able to make a lap at the border of the battlefield without a few thousand years.

In a huge ancient battlefield, there was a ruin with countless bumps and hollows that was filled with ancient yet mysterious aura. It was impressive.

“The location of Green Fire World is there…” Jian Wushuang looked at the corner of a battlefield.

When he looked in the direction of it, his facial expression quickly changed.

He was originally calm but he suddenly became shocked and then dumbstruck. In the end, he looked in disbelief.

“This… how is this possible???”

“Impossible!!!”

Jian Wushuang let out a low bellow.

He was an expert on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, an existence who possessed the fighting power of an Emperor God, and he was knowledgeable and experienced. But then, he couldn’t conceal his astonishment. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Not only him, but also King of Venomous Worms who was in harmony with his mind and blood. He was also dumbfounded.

Looking at Jian Wushuang’s expression, Palace Master Yun smiled faintly and he wasn’t surprised.

In actual fact, anyone who saw the scene in the middle of the battlefield, or maybe the ‘thing’, would be astonished.

“Unbelievable!!”

Jian Wushuang muttered as he gasped a breath of cold air. He saw the entire ancient battlefield through the huge formation.

At the same time, he saw Green Fire World that was right in the middle of the ancient battlefield, but Jian Wushuang also saw that there was an unbelievably huge head there clearly!!

Yes, it was a head!
