Chapter 1260: Jian Wushuang, Your Turn to Shine

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

With slight hesitation, Mo You continued, “One month ago, in the Red Water Alliance’s territory, we already announced that we were going to launch a slaughter in the city today. We’ve given the people who don’t belong to the Red Water Alliance one month to leave this place, so who do you think those who still stay are?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression shifted.

The people who knew this news but still did not want to leave should be the experts in the Red Water Alliance.

“I understand. So, we don’t need to waste time. Let’s do it.” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold.

“Seventh Army, to action! Inside the city, kill all the people that you see!”

Given the order, the sergeants of the Seventh Army immediately swarmed into the city.

There was a Formation around the city, but it was not strong. There were many people who were good at Formations in the Seventh Army, so it took only a couple minutes for these 30,000 sergeants to break through the Formation and slash into the city.

Violent explosions soon sounded in the city.

Obviously, the sergeants in the Seventh Army already started the battle with the experts from the Red Water Alliance.

The entire giant city was filled with war.

In the void outside the city, Jian Wushuang, Lin Dong and Mo You were supervising. These three Divine Generals did not take any action yet.

For them, it was not valuable to kill the ordinary Holy Masters and Universe Masters.

“Seventh Divine General, the commander said you only spent less then ten thousand years cultivating and then you left your hometown to explore the world?” Lin Dong looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded indifferently.

“So have you got any experience in fighting with any Invincible Universe Masters so far?” Lin Dong asked.

“Yes, in my hometown, I did meet an opponent who was an Invincible Universe Master,” Jian Wushuang said.

He was talking about Long Xu King.

“Only one?” Lin Dong looked odd.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

He had met only one Universe God yet, and that was Long Xu King. However, he had met two Universe Gods. Chen Universe God was for Jian Wushuang to verify his invincible Universe Master battle strength, so he did not count him as one. However, he had killed Jin Feng of the Jin Kingdom, who was a First Heaven Universe God.

After Jian Wushuang answered, Lin Dong frowned and scoffed, “No wonder the commander asked us to take good care of you and give you more chances to practice!”

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Seventh Divine General, you might not really know that we Divine Generals have been in the Nine Star Sea for a long time. Even the Sixth Divine General has been here for thousands of years. During this period, we have been battling with Golden-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture, so we’ve got lots of killing experience!” Mo You smiled.

“I’ve fought more than 14 invincible Universe Masters and have met some of them several times, so I’ve had more than one hundred battles with the Universe Masters!”

“Lin Dong is even better. He has met more than 20 Invincible Universe Masters and has experience in killing hundreds. There were many cases in which he fought two or three Universe Masters at the same time.”

“However, you’ve only had one fierce battle with an invincible Universe Master, so don’t you think we need to take care of you?”

Mo You and Lin Dong smiled wordlessly.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Indeed, according to killing experience, he was not as good as these two Divine Generals.

“This task is pretty simple. It would be good enough if only Mo You and I took control, but the commander also assigned you to join the battle. If I am not wrong, the commander wants you to practice more, and then you can adapt to the Eternal Chaotic World and get used to battling with experts soon,” Lin Dong said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, and he felt even more confused.

At this moment…

Bang!

A powerful aura rose up at the corner of the city.

“Hmm?”

Jian Wushuang, Lin Dong and Mo You all sensed this aura and instantly looked towards it.

In the void where the aura was rising up, a stalwart elder donned in scarlet armor was waving a scarlet sledgehammer that exploded with strong power. His eyes turned red and were full of Killing Intent.

There were many Universe Masters in the Seventh Army fighting the scarlet elder. Some of them were even Peak Universe Masters.

However, the elder’s sledgehammer exploded with tremendous power. Seeming completely unfazed, he slammed the Universe Masters with his sledgehammer and killed them one by one.

In only a couple minutes, five Universe Masters in the Seventh Army were killed by the elder.

“That is… an Invincible Universe Master?” Jian Wushuang looked at the elder in surprise.

“He is the Universe Master Bei in the Red Water Alliance!” Lin Dong and Mo You both frowned. Obviously, they recognized him.

“When the Master of Scarlet Island led his army to kill all the Universe Gods in the Red Water Alliance, they even killed several Invincible Universe Masters. However, two of them were pretty lucky and escaped. These two were Gu Nan Young Alliance Master and Universe Master Bei!”

“Universe Master Bei is very famous here, and his strength is also extremely strong. He ranks first in the Red Water Alliance. That is why the commander asked me to come here,” Ling Dong said.

He was the Second Divine General in the Scarlet Island, and his strength ranked second among the Divine Generals, so his battle strength was better than Universe Master Bei’s.

“Before, we thought that if all the Universe Gods were killed, Universe Master Bei would lay low for a while after escaping. To my suprise, he’s in the first city that Scarlet Island wants to take over. He really has guts,” Mo You said, “Lin Dong, based on your strength, you will be the only one who can defeat him. You should take action.”

“No rush.” Lin Dong shook his head and looked at Jian Wushuang, “The commander asked us to give you more chances to practice, so Jian Wushuang, I will leave Universe Master Bei to you. You can just try your best to battle with him. When you can’t keep up any longer, you can send me a message.”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Without hesitating, he glided forward to the city.

Lin Dong and Mo You were still standing there and looking at him.
