Chapter 2571: Prized Treasure

“Haha, Shi Clan. I don’t have time to play with you!”

Jian Wushuang burst out in a fit of triumphant laughter with his voice echoing across the sky as he left the perplexed Shi Clan experts behind.

Even though the Shi Clan experts tried their best to hold Jian Wushuang back, they failed miserably and could only watch him leave right under their noses.

“Damn, he’s gone!” Shi Qianhan stood there with a stony expression.

A Shi Clan Elder said, “There’s no way we could stop him. He’s extremely strong and is much stronger than any of us. The key is that his physical protective capabilities are strong. Our five Peak Ultimate Gods teamed up and yet it was impossible to kill him! The battle armor he wore is a Heavenly Treasure for sure!”

“How did he acquire such an amazing treasure?”

Everyone in the Shi Clan was clamoring enthusiastically over the treasured armor.

No one was hurt in the battle as the Shi Clan did not suffer any damages and Jian Wushuang was also left unscathed.

After the incident, news that Jian Wushuang possessed a Heavenly Treasure Armor spread like wildfire throughout the Northern Darkstar Continent.

Countless clans and experts in the Northern Darkstar Continent showed interest in the news.

It was a piece of Heavenly Treasure after all!

Heavenly Treasures were invaluable to an Earth Ultimate God, especially when most of them did not even have one!

The armor caused an uproar across the entire Northern Darkstar Continent.

In the most central part of the Northern Darkstar Continent, a huge underground palace was surrounded by numerous heavy restrictive shields within the Territorial Lord’s mansion. The Territorial Lord—also known as San Shouwang—was seated alone when suddenly...a figure appeared outside the restrictive shield to deliver a message.

San Shouwang opened his eyes with slightly furrowed brows. With a wave of his hand, all the restrictive shields melted away as a burly man walked in.

The burly man was a commander of the Official Army.

“Didn’t I say not to disturb me within these thousand years?” San Shouwang’s voice was cold and laced with anger written all over his face.

“I’m sorry, Territorial Lord. I’ve got a piece of news which is very important to you. It’s for that reason I came immediately to send this message,” said the burly man.

“Oh?” The anger on his face gradually faded. “Tell me about it.”

The burly man said, “Not long ago, an expert called Jian Yi broke into the Shi Clan Mansion and fought against Shi Clan’s five Peak Ultimate Gods. The five Peak Ultimate Gods were unable to defeat him because he wore incredibly powerful armors. Many experts present at the time believe the armor he wore was a piece of Heavenly Treasure!”

“What did you say?” San Shouwang sprang up with widened eyes widening as he stared intensely at the burly man.

“Heavenly Treasure? You mean Jian Yi has a Heavenly Treasure Armor?” San Shouwang’s eyes flashed with great interest from excitement.

“I am not too sure whether it’s a piece of Heavenly Treasure or otherwise, but it fits the description judging from the battle armor’s powers. Even if it’s not a Heavenly Treasure, it’s a least a top Natural Treasure. I received this news and immediately came here to notify you about it, Territorial Lord,” explained the burly man.

“Haha, how lucky am I? God must also be helping me!” San Shouwang laughed heartily with his maniacal sounding laughter. “Heavenly Treasure... Even though I already have one Heavenly Treasure on hand, it’s just an ordinary one. A defensive Heavenly Treasure is ten times more precious than an offensive Heavenly Treasure. How great it is to have such a rare piece of treasure appear before my eyes? Furthermore, its owner is just a Peak Ultimate God?”

An offensive Heavenly Treasure weapon was enough to move San Shouwang’s heart but would not tickle his greed.

A defensive Heavenly Treasure was a different story.

“I learned that the Destruction Law and Destruction Divine Armor is sufficiently powerful as a protective shield. Unfortunately, I’ve always lacked suitable and powerful armor. If I have both protective mechanisms, what Earth Ultimate God could cause any harm to me? And now...”

“Where is Jian Yi?” San Shouwang asked.

The burly man said, “He’s still in the Northern Darkstar Continent. I’m afraid he’s been targeted by all the other clans, especially the three top-tier clans. The Shi Clan, Wu Clan, and Situ Clan would be keen to lay their hands on this treasure!”

“Huh, do they even deserve this armor?” San Shouwang sneered. “They may still have a chance if I don’t show up. However, they’ll have to make way for me now that I’m personally going out! Summon the Official Army now to accompany me and find Jian Yi!”

“Yes,” answered the burly man as he nodded solemnly.

After a short while...

The burly man appeared in front of San Shouwang again. “Territorial Lord, the fourth and seventh battalions have been summoned.”

“Let’s go.” San Shouwang quickly rushed toward Jian Wushuang with the Official Army after giving a big wave. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At the same time, Jian Wushuang had also received news from the Situ Clan.

“Has he departed? He’s only leading two battalions. The combat powers of those two battalions are incomplete so they won’t threaten me at all.”

Jian Wushuang sat on the attic’s roof with a strange smile appearing on his face.

“Just like I thought, San Shouwang will definitely be keen when he finds out about it and personally comes to snatch it away from me once I display the Golden Glass Armor’s powers. It’s the exact outcome I desired!”

Jian Wushuang made a trip to the Shi Clan to seemingly find fault with them.

However, his real purpose was to show off the Golden Glass Armor’s powers to the public and let news of it travel to San Shouwang.

San Shouwang had announced his seclusion to the world that he was no longer accepting any challenges.

A Heavenly Treasure Armor would be enough to make him go crazy.

As expected, San Shouwang had made an appearance!

“It won’t take more than half an hour to get here from the Territorial Lord’s mansion. I might as well go there and wait for him.”

Jian Wushuang stood up before slowly moving into the void next to him.

He felt the presence of a large number of cultivators around him in the surrounding void along his path.

The cultivators came from various clans like the Shi Clan and Wu Clan but were only following him as no one dared to launch an attack on Jian Wushuang.

The clans had gotten news that San Shouwang was making a move.

If the Territorial Lord was involved, the Heavenly Treasure Armor on Jian Wushuang was not something clans like them could fight over.
