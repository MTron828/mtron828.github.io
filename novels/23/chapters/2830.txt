“Retreat, quickly retreat!”

As soon as the commander of the Heavenly Void Army gave the order, the experts of the Heavenly Void Realm camp immediately began to retreat like a tide.

Naturally, the people of the Pill Sun Sacred World were unrelenting. They seized the opportunity to pursue and kill.

In the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and the Marquis of Three Yin were fighting head-on. Neither side could do anything to the other.

However, they were aware of the situation around them.

“They lost?”

The Marquis of Three Yin was in disbelief, but his eyes were staring at Jian Wushuang coldly.

.

“Sword One, you have good skills. You control such a powerful corpse puppet army. I want to know where you got these corpse puppets,” The Marquis of Three Yin said coldly.

“It has nothing to do with you, Marquis Three Yin, right?” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“That’s true. Even though I know you may have some secrets, I can’t do anything to you with my strength. But don’t be proud. I can’t do anything to you, but my palace master has many ways to deal with you. Although you won the battle today, sooner or later, my palace master will come back. We’ll see if you can resist him,” The Marquis of Three Yin said with a cold smile. His body had also floated backward.

“You want to leave?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

He did not intend to let the Marquis of Three Yin leave so easily.

He immediately rushed toward the Marquis of Three Yin and pursued him. But, unfortunately, the four domains were still pressing on the Marquis of Three Yin’s body.

He was defeated. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Heavenly Void World had been completely defeated, and many experts were fleeing frantically.

As for the experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World was doing its best to chase after the experts from the Heavenly Void World. They wanted to retain as many experts from the Heavenly Void World as possible.

This chase continued for a full 15 minutes. The Pill Sun Sacred World finally came to a halt after chasing for a very long distance.

They were still on the vast ice plains. In the air, many experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World were gathered there. As for the experts from the Heavenly Void World Camp, they had already left far away. As for the experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World Camp, they were chasing after them. Corpses were left everywhere along the way.

At this moment, these experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World were floating in the void. Yet, all of them had incomparably excited expressions.

“We’ve won!”

“We’ve won this battle!”

“The Pill Sun Sacred World has defended.”

The many experts were incomparably excited and delighted in their hearts.

At the same time that they were excited and delighted, many gazes could not help but look towards the void at the very front. It was a young man in a golden robe who held a sword in one hand.

Many corpse puppets were surrounding the golden-robed young man.

All the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World looked at this person with respect and admiration.

They all knew that the Pill Sun Sacred World could win this battle because of this person.

Sword one, the publicly acknowledged strongest expert of the Pill Sun Sacred World!

In this battle, he fought head-on with the Invincible Divine Master, the Marquis of Three Yin. They were evenly matched and even suffered a slight loss. However, this strength was once again affirmed. There was no doubt about the Invincible Divine Master.

Apart from his personal strength, the strength he possessed also shocked everyone.

Previously, they had all thought that their side would definitely lose this battle. However, in the end, this sword one had actually brought out a powerful corpse puppet army. The corpse puppet army completely obeyed his orders because a powerful corpse puppet army had joined them. This completely changed the situation on the battlefield.

The corpse puppet army was too powerful.

Such a powerful force was completely controlled by Sword One alone.

Awe!

Everyone was full of awe toward Jian Wushuang.

Even Yin Su’er had a trace of awe toward Jian Wushuang.

There was no other way. Jian Wushuang was too powerful now.

He was stronger than everyone in the Pill Sun Sacred World, and the power in his hands was enough to sweep across the entire Pill Sun Sacred World.

Although she was the lord of Crimson Rock Castle and was in control of the Pill Sun Sacred World on the surface, she asked herself that if Jian Wushuang wanted to, he could easily take away her authority as the controller.

“Sword One...” Yin Su’er narrowed her beautiful eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang with a complicated expression.

At this time, Jian Wushuang had put the corpse puppets back into his interspatial ring.

After putting the entire corpse puppet army into his interspatial ring, he flashed and appeared beside Yin Su’er.

“Lord Su’er, how are our casualties?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“More than 10 Great Divine Masters have died, and more than 1,000 Divine Masters have died. However, compared to the loss of the Heavenly Void World, our side is perfect,” Yin Su’er said.

She was telling the truth.

The Heavenly Void World had suffered heavy losses in this battle.

Previously, because of the appearance of the corpse puppet army, the situation had been reversed, and many experts had been killed. Later, in the 15 minutes of pursuit, more experts from the Heavenly Void World Camp had died. Although there were no detailed statistics, they estimated that... in this battle, more than sixty Great Divine Masters from the Heavenly Void Realm Camp had died.

The Heavenly Void Army had also suffered heavy losses, and many of those Great Divine Masters had also died.

Compared to the losses of the Heavenly Void Realm Camp, the experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World had indeed been very lucky.

“The main reason is that you brought out the corpse puppet army. If it weren’t for the Corpse Puppet Army, our Pill Sun Sacred World would have been in danger in this battle.” Yin Su’er sighed softly, then she asked, “Mr. Sword One, how come you have such a powerful corpse puppet army?”

Yin Su’er was very curious about this question.

She was not the only one. Many Pill Sun Sacred World experts, including Elder Tong and Great Divine Master Jue Xin, were also very curious.

After all, there were hundreds of corpse puppets, the weakest of which was an advanced divine master. The corpse puppet army was enough to sweep across the entire Pill Sun Sacred World. They wanted to know how Jian Wushuang had obtained such a powerful force.

“Well... I can’t tell you about it. Anyway, I got lucky.” Jian Wushuang smiled and laughed.

He was the only one who knew about the secret realm. So, naturally, he could not tell others where it was.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang did not want to say more, Yin Su’er and the others did not ask further.

“In any case, the Pill Sun Sacred World won this battle!” Yin Su’er smiled.

“We’ve won!”

“We’ve won!”

The people around them were also overjoyed.

After a long while, Yin Su’er said loudly, “Everyone, clean up the battlefield carefully. After that, we’ll go to Crimson Rock Castle together. I’ve already ordered people to prepare a banquet there. So today, our Crimson Rock Castle will celebrate with everyone here!”
