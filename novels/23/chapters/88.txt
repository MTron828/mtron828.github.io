“What?” The smile on the warrior in silver froze at once. He looked in disbelief at the sword light that had suddenly appeared.

“It’s him?” The warrior in silver also recognized who had executed that move.

Was it that Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea, whom he had paid no attention to and regarded boring to kill?

Yes, it was exactly that Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea. When everyone around, even including Ye Mei herself, did not realize what was happening, Jian Wushuang had clearly seen the warrior in silver’s figure and cleaved toward him.

“This sword light…” A flicker of fear appeared in the warrior in silver’s eyes.

The sword light was too fast, even much faster than what he could execute with his full power. It was too fast for him to defend. In the next instant, the sword had directly roared past right in front of him.

“Ah!”

The warrior in silver immediately let out a sad and painful cry, looking at his right hand with astonishment. Actually, that sword light had directly chopped half of his palm off as streams of blood wildly burst out.

“What?”

The several people around also witnessed what had happened. They finally were able to clearly see the warrior in silver’s figure, as well as his palm chopped in half and the Purple Soft Sword that had dropped on the ground.

At that moment, everyone stopped breathing.

“Run!”

With half of his palm chopped off, the warrior in silver’s face twisted with great pain, but he still remained a little sober. Instead of picking up the chopped off half-palm and that Purple Soft Sword, he rushed out and escaped.

He clearly knew that what he was most versed in were assassination and high speed. As for face-to-face slaughter, either Ba Yan or Tai Shan, who were both in the Profound Gold Core Realm, could beat him single-handedly. Hence, once his figure was seen, he had to leave immediately. What was worse was that his right hand was crippled now, and his battle strength was largely reduced.

“As long as all of you have come, then stay here.”

A floating voice was passed into the warrior in silver’s ears when his complexion sharply changed.

“Shua!”

The icy Sword Edge directly penetrated through the warrior in silver’s chest from the back, with its edge passing right through the entire heart.

The third movement of Formless Swordsmanship… Expeditious Maneuver!

The warrior in silver just felt a little sweetness in his throat. In the next instant, a gush of blood spurted from his mouth, before his body slowly slumped down to the ground.

Even when he died, he could not believe that he would die at the hand of a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea.

After killing the warrior in silver, Jian Wushuang put the Triple-kill Sword back into its sheath. Then, he bent over to pick up the warrior in silver’s Ring of Heaven and Earth and that Purple Soft Sword from the ground before turning around to look at Ba Yan and the others.

As soon as he turned around, Jian Wushuang found that all of Ba Yan, Tai Shan, Ye Mei, and that purple-haired middle-aged man were staring at him with shocked faces.

“Swordsman, you… you killed him?” Ba Yan said in astonishment.

“Should I not try to kill him and wait for him to kill you one by one?” Jian Wushuang asked in return.

Both Ba Yan and Tai Shan looked at Jian Wushuang in a different way.

Like Tai Shan, he did not regard Jian Wushuang as somebody at all before this. In his view, a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea trying to complete the task of the Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard meant that he was pursuing death. He had even quarreled with Jian Wushuang. But now… Tai Shan absolutely could not look down upon Jian Wushuang. Instead, he felt deep fear toward him from the bottom of his heart.

Yes, it was fear.

After all, that warrior in silver had killed three of his companions in front of him, but he did not even see the shadow of their opponent. However, Jian Wushuang did directly slaughter that warrior in silver.

Having witnessed such strength, how could he stand there with no fear?

As for Ye Mei and that purple-haired middle-aged man, they had seen before that Jian Wushuang killed the Herculean Demonic Monkey in the Profound Gold Core Realm in just a moment, so they had known that Jian Wushuang’s strength was very horrifying. Yet, when they saw Jian Wushuang so easily slaughter that warrior in silver, they still felt extremely shocked.

“Swordsman, thank you!” Ye Mei earnestly stared at Jian Wushuang and expressed her gratitude.

Just now, that warrior in silver had aimed to kill her, which she knew very clearly. If Jian Wushuang had not saved her in time, she would be dead now.

“You’re welcome. Anyway, we are companions. Of course I can’t watch you be killed,” Jian Wushang casually answered.

Ye Mei nodded slightly. Although Jian Wushuang seemed to be very casual, she had remembered his kind help.

“All right. The guy who was in our way has been killed. Captain Ba Yan, let’s continue ahead,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Huh?” Ba Yan was stunned before grasping his words. Then, he nodded in a hurry, saying, “All right, all right. Let’s go!”

…

At night, on a hill, Ba Yan and the other several people were gathering in front of a fire.

“How could it be? That man was only in the Profound Gold Core Realm with not very powerful strength. He was just relatively good at assassination. If I fought against him face-to-face, maybe I could have beaten him.” Tai Shan’s voice was very solid.

“Humph, what a shame! Anyway, you are an expert in the Profound Gold Core Realm, but couldn’t see his Cultivation of Spiritual Power!” Ba Yan sneered.

“That’s all due to that guy’s high speed!” Tai Shan curled his lip and then said, “Yet, Brother Swordsman is really awesome. He’s only in the Spiritual Sea Realm, but he so easily killed a warrior in the Primordial Gold Core?”

After knowing Jian Wushuang’s real strength, Tai Shan was not proud at all in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Really awesome!” Ba Yan also praised him. “Such an excellent Spiritual Sea Realm Warrior can’t be an ordinary person. In my opinion, he must possess a great background. He is even maybe a disciple of the Dragon Palace.”

“Dragon Palace?” Both Tai Shan and the purple-haired middle-aged man opened their eyes wide.

“That Swordsman is really a Disciples of Dragon Palace,” said Ye Mei just then.

“Really?” Ba Yan, Tai Shan, and the purple-haired middle-aged man’s showed expressions of great interest.

At their side, Jian Wushuang was casually sitting on a giant rock, playing with the Purple Soft Sword in his hand.

That Purple Soft Sword was obtained after killing that warrior in silver. What was noticeable was that there were two red characters engraved on its Sword Hilt… “11”.

“11?” Jian Wushuang murmured. Then, he turned his hand over and a small scroll appeared.

That was naturally the task scroll of the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace’s task of Stage One had been mostly finished, so he began studying the task of Stage Two.

Opening the scroll…

“Task of Stage Two: Kill the Dark Silver Guard!

“Task Location: Innumerable Huge Mountains.

“Task Description: In the Palace of the Dongyang Commandery Prince of the Tianzong Dynasty, there is a well-cultivated guarding army called the Dark Silver Guard. There are more than 100 Dark Silver Guards, who often secretly help the Palace of Dongyang Commandery Prince to kill enemies and complete some confidential tasks. The cultivation process of the Dark Silver Guard is extremely cruel and complicated…”
