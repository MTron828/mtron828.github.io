Chapter 398: It’s All Because of this Swordsman!

Wu Ta despaired when he saw how fast Jian Wushuang moved in the Blood River.

He understood that Jian Wushuang might not be as strong as he was, but he was definitely exceptional in other fields.

It was impossible for him to kill such a formidable opponent.

“Quick! Get as many the Blood Gems and tokens as you can!” Wu Ta growled.

The Silver-winged Army experts gave up stopping Lei Dao and his companions. They focused their efforts on collecting the Blood Gems, but trapped in the Blood River, they were overpowered by their opponents and gained only a few gems.

It was not long before all the Blood Gems and tokens were gathered by the experts.

The Iron Saber Army and the Silver-winged Army stood on opposite sides of the hall and regarded each other.

The Silver-winged army experts looked crestfallen.

“How many Blood Gems did you get?” Wu Ta asked.

“Six.” a white-robed man answered. He was the one that had collected some gems before Jian Wushuang displayed Road to the Underworld.

“I got one.”

“So did I.”

“I was lucky. I got two.”

Three more people answered while others remained silent. Wu Ta’s face darkened.

He had seven commanders in his army, but they had only obtained 11 Blood Gems, less than one-third of all the gems.

As for the four tokens, Wu Ta had obtained one, while the remaining three had been seized by General Qing.

“It’s all because of him!”

“Swordsman!”

“Damn him!”

Wu Ta and the Silver-winged Army experts glared at Jian Wushuang spitefully.

They hated him!

They had outnumbered the Iron Saber Army by one and could have won the battle. Instead, they had suffered a great loss because of Jian Wushuang and his skills.

To make matters worse, they were powerless against Jian Wushuang. Even Wu Ta himself could only look at Jian Wushuang with desperation.

Wu Ta had tried to defeat Jian Wushuang but had failed. It was possible that only the top experts of the Nature-defying Level or Stage Three stood a chance to kill Jian Wushuang, but Wu Ta had his doubts.

In contrast, the commanders of the Iron Saber Army were all beaming with joy.

“Haha, what a big harvest!”

“Yes, we have earned much!”

“Thanks to Swordsman! Without his Domain skill, we would have lost!”

Lei Dao and Shi Ling laughed complacently, and even General Qing was grinning.

They had gained most of the gems and three tokens out of the four.

This was a much bigger haul than the Silver-winged Army’s.

While Jian Wushuang was conversing cheerfully with the commanders, they felt a breeze and a figure appeared.

“Your Excellency!”

They bowed respectfully to the newcomer.

It was the Iron Saber Lord.

The Lord was accompanied by a silver-robed man with an expressionless face. The latter stood in front of the Silver-winged Army’s commanders, revealing his status as the Silver Wing Lord.

The Silver Wing Lord had immediately spotted the blood river when he entered the hall.

“It’s a good domain skill. Even I am affected by it.” Silver Wing Lord was astonished, he quickly regained his composure.

“Your Excellency.” Wu Ta bowed to him.

“How was it going?” Silver Wing Lord asked flatly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Not long after we came into this hall, we found dozens of Blood Gems and four tokens that we could use to enter the inner part of this mansion. We fought hard with the Iron Saber Army, but...” Wu Ta lowered his voice and continued, “but we only obtained 11 gems and one token while the Iron Saber Army got the rest.”

“What?” The Silver Wing Lord’s eyes flashed with anger.

“Your Excellency, We’ve tried our best to fight them, but that Swordsman’s Domain skill was so tricky. I tried to kill him but failed. He has so many ways to protect himself.” Wu Ta sighed.

The Silver Wing Lord turned his attention to Jian Wushuang through the Blood River.

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat as he felt his gaze. The Blood River began to evaporate.

“Iron Saber, it looks like you’re luckier than me today,” Lord of the Silver-winged Territory sounded emotionless.

Iron Saber Lord smiled in response and he cast his eyes on General Qing.

“Did you really get three tokens?” he asked the general.

“Yes, your Excellency!” the general answered.

“Well done.” Iron Saber Lord smiled and nodded. He gave Jian Wushuang a meaningful glance, then stretched his hand toward General Qing, “Give me the tokens and keep the gems for yourselves.”

General Qing immediately handed the tokens to his lord without hesitation.

“Iron Saber, let’s have a talk,” Silver Wing Lord said.

“Ok, why not. But among the tokens, I got three while you got one, I have more leverage than you.” Iron Saber Lord smirked.

Silver Wing Lord’s face twitched in irritation and he snorted. “You’re lucky to have a brilliant follower, that’s all.”

Iron Saber Lord did not react to the remark. He looked at Jian Wushuang and the others, “Your business is done here, go back now.”

“Yes, your Excellency!”

General Qing and Jian Wushuang nodded and left the cave mansion, smiling.

The Silver-winged Army commanders left as well. In stark contrast with their opponents, they were in low spirits.

As the commanders walked through the long Bluestone Corridor, they didn’t run into any danger.

After leaving the mansion, the Iron Saber Army commanders gathered in the void above Demon Heart Canyon to distribute the Blood Gems.
