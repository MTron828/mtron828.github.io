Chapter 689: Sneak Attack

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

This black gem appeared ordinary and did not shine with luster. However, it gave off an extremely strong Killing Intent, which was an indication of its extraordinary origin.

Jian Wushuang obtained it from a Divine Realm expert who he had killed. He had no idea what it was exactly, but he did feel that this was something special.

“What is it?”

Hu Hu observed the black gem from a distance of 10 meters. He could see that it was extraordinary, but he could not tell its origin from such a distance.

“Let me have a closer look at the gem,” Hu Hu said.

“OK.”

Jian Wushuang nodded, slowly stepping forward with the black gem in his hand, came to a stop when he was less than a meter away from Hu Hu.

“This gem…” Hu Hu leaned forward and stared at this black gem intensely, “It has rich Killing Intent. Is this the legendary Soldier Killing Gem?”

Hu Hu focused all his attention on the black gem, not taking the slightest precautions against Jian Wushuang.

“The time is right,”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with killing intent. The next moment a cold sword shadow burst out with the suddenness of a thunderbolt.

The movement of the sword was extremely fast!

And, too sudden!

Although Hu Hu was cautious by nature, it was obvious that he did not consider Jian Wushuang any form of threat as he was just a Skyscraping Realm expert. In addition, he had been distracted by the black gem, so the sudden sword stroke of Jian Wushuang had completely caught him off guard.

“What?”

Even though Hu Hu was rich in combat experience, he was still startled by such a close sword stroke. His eyes were wide open and the hair on his back of neck stood up. In this life-and-death situation, he used all his experience and with great difficulty moved his body slightly.

This move meant he avoided being attacked at any vital body parts. However, the longsword still struck Hu Hu on his shoulder. The sharp Emperor Sword cut through his strong body, which had been enhanced by Body Reshaping Techniques, as easily as cutting through a piece of paper. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The longsword cut straight into Hu Hu’s shoulder and nearly cut off half of his arm before it came to a stop.

“Bastard!”

Hu Hu shouted like a raging lion. Mighty Spiritual Power surged along his remaining good arm and then to his palm, which was like a huge fan, and slapped toward Jian Wushuang’s head with extreme force.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and moved his body in a weird way to avoid Hu Hu’s palm comfortably. At the same time, Hu Hu had stepped backward to create a distance between the two.

In the hall, they stood there facing each other.

Jian Wushuang, holding his Emperor Sword, coldly stared at Hu Hu.

Hu Hu’s half arm hung loosely. A lot of blood gushed from the wound and dripped onto the ground. He stared at Jian Wushuang, with his face turning purple and his eyes full of anger.

“Boy, what a devious move!” Hu Hu growled.

“Devious?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “In this world, everyone lives by the law of the jungle. How can you say I’m devious? Also, you were quite devious yourself when you cooperated with an expert and killed the Ancient Sect disciple, were you not?”

Hearing these words, Hu Hu was surprised, but then a cold smile appeared on his face. “It seems that Ancient Sect has discovered my secret. But it’s so stupid to send a Skyscraping Realm bug to attempt to kill me. You will die today.”

“I will die? I don’t think so.”

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. He stopped talking with Hu Hu and rushed forward with speed.

As soon as he appeared in front of Hu Hu, he waved his Emperor Sword and attacked him.

With this single move, countless sword shadows seemed to burst out in an instant.

He had exerted about seven-tenths of the power of the Sword Heart in his sea of consciousness.

“Humph, ridiculous!”

Hu Hu snorted, as a red cloud burst out from his body. This Secret Skill could greatly increase his strength.

At the same time, he turned over his remaining good hand, and in it appeared a double-edged giant axe. The huge axe seemed to weigh at least a thousand pounds, but Hu Hu held it as though he was holding a feather. He then launched the axe forward.

It carried such force with it, that it even created a fierce blast in the air.

Jian Wushuang’s sword slashed its way toward it.

Bang!

When the two collided, Jian Wushuang even found himself struggling to remain upright.

“This guy even has a lot of power in his left arm,”?Jian Wushuang frowned.

His strength at this moment was at the same level as when he killed Bing Ji. He completely crushed Bing Ji who was in his prime when they had fought.

However, he drew with Hu Hu who only had the use of his left arm, his weaker arm.

Jian Wushuang was a little surprised, but Hu Hu was really astonished.

“My right arm was wounded, but my left arm has not suffered any injuries. But still, my full attack has been parried by this guy of Skyscraping Realm?”?Hu Hu glared at Jian Wushuang with a shocked look on his face. He knew in that instant that Jian Wushuang was at least as strong as an advanced Divine Realm expert.

“That boy!”

He dared not to underestimate Jian Wushuang any longer. The red cloud exuding from him became even heavier and formed a red crystal armor to shield him.

Hu Hu’s aura began to rise.

“This Secret Skill…” Jian Wushuang observed the red armor surrounding Hu Hu with a serious look.

He could tell that Hu Hu was using some Secret Skill which could multiply his power in a short period of time. It was the same as the Thousands Apes Hand used by Bing Ji. However, as Bing Ji was just an ordinary advanced Divine Realm expert, it only enhanced his offensive power five times.

Even though Hu Hu had not started his attack yet, Jian Wushuang could see that Hu Hu had cultivated the highest level of his Secret Skill and could definitely increase his offensive power eight times or even ten times.

Moreover, Hu Hu’s comprehension of Dao was definitely more in-depth than that of Bing Ji. He definitely ranked high among the advanced Divine Realm experts if he revealed his true strength.

“Fortunately, I chose to start with a sneak attack and cut his right arm so that he could not go all out, otherwise…”

Before Jian Wushuang could finish his thought, he suddenly saw that Hu Hu swallowed an elixir in front of him.
