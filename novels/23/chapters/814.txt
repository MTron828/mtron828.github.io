“What did you say?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

At that moment, he turned around and gave Lin Wan an icy look.

When Lin Wan saw Jian Wushuang turn around, a feeling of hope returned to her. “I said you are afraid of Xia Yan and his elder brother. What about it?” she asked.

“No, not that,” Jian Wushuang said, still staring at Lin Wan, “You said Xia Yan’s elder brother is the princess’s husband? There is only one princess in the Tang of the East, isn’t there?”

“Yes,” Lin Wan answered and nodded. “The princess is Leng Rushuang, the most beautiful girl in the Eternal World. As for her husband…”

Lin Wan continued after a pause, “Although Sister Shuang is not married yet, the current ruler of the Tang of the East, Empress Leng, has long agreed with the Xia Clan that Xia Yan’s elder brother will be her husband. So, it’s a done deal.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang oozed a freezing aura. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Leng Rushuang… ”?he murmured the name in his heart.

From the time he began to cultivate until now, he had met all kinds of women and had come into contact with many that were beautiful or graceful.

But, Leng Rushuang was the only one who gave him a special feeling.

He had only seen her a few times, but he knew exactly how he felt about her.

When Lin Wan said that Xia Yan’s elder brother was the husband of the princess, a fit of petulant sulkiness rose in his heart.

“You called Leng Rushuang Sister Shuang. You seem to know her and have a good relationship with her, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, of course I know her. Her parents, Emperor Xiao and Empress Leng, are good friends with my father. He used to visit them, and my father took me with him when he went to the Tang of the East, so I’ve met Sister Shuang many times. Because of that we are close to each other,” Lin Wan told him.

“Sister Shuang is an indifferent but good person. In the Tang of the East, and even in the whole Eternal World, she has very few friends, but I should be considered one of her few friends.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang raised his brows and looked at Lin Wan again, then he said, “Okay, I’ll help you.”

You’re reading on Thanks!

“Really?” Lin Wan became jubilant, “What else do you want? Just say it!” she hurriedly added.

“The 100 million Divine Gems you promised is enough,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“No problem, I’ll give you the Divine Gems now.”

With that, she took out an Interspatial Ring and gave it to Jian Wushuang.

“There are 100 million Divine Gems in it. Please check it. If it’s okay, you can go to the Blood Battle Arena now. I’ll bring Xia Yan there before long. Be careful when you fight against Xia Yan. You just have to do your best, I won’t blame you if you lose.”

Jian Wushuang took the Interspatial Ring and searched it with his consciousness before looking up and saying, “I won’t lose!”

Then he turned and left directly, leaving Lin Wan alone in the tent.

“Counting Swordsman, I have found three powerful Divine Realm experts. Leaving aside the first two, Swordsman was able to stand up to Lei Xin in a head-on battle. Maybe he can beat Xia Yan!” Lin Wan murmured with delight.

…

Once he came outside of the tent, Jian Wushuang quickly found Yang Zaixuan.

“Third brother, who was looking for you and why?” Yang Zaixuan asked urgently.

“It’s not a big deal,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Come on, let’s both head to the Blood Battle Arena.”

“You’re going to the Blood Battle Arena? What are you going to do there?” Yang Zaixuan asked, puzzled.

“What am I going to do?” Jian Wushuang squinted but the corners of his mouth turned up and formed a sneer. “I’m going to grab the title of ‘the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World’.”

“Huh?” Yang Zaixuan looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise and then a meaningful smile spread across his face.

Without asking any more questions, he followed Jian Wushuang toward the Blood Battle Arena.

The Blood Battle Arena was still as crazy and lively as it had been before.

The arena was large enough to allow two powerful experts in the Eternal Realm to fight using their full power without affecting the countless people in the audience.

When Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan arrived at the Blood Battle Arena, two superior Divine Realm experts were having a fierce fight inside the arena.

However, they had no interest in watching duels between superior Divine Realm experts, so they sat quietly in a corner and waited for Xia Yan.

About half a day later, along with a buzzing sound, a lot of powerful people suddenly emerged.

As soon as these people arrived, a terrifying aura spread out over the Blood Battle Arena and, for a moment, the entire Blood Battle Arena grew completely silent.

Countless people in the audience stared with wide eyes at these people.

Those people were horrifying, especially the first few who oozed a unique and profound aura, which was more than enough to represent their identity.

“They are Dao Masters!”

“Why has more than one Dao Master come to the Blood Battle Arena in person?”

“What, what’s going on?”

Everyone in the audience was in a state of shock and dullness.

The two superior Divine Realm experts who were fighting on the arena instantly stopped and ran off the arena.

In the silence, Lin Wan, who was standing among the people on the edge of the arena, pointed to the graceful young man, Xia Yan, and shouted, “Xia Yan, you are called the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, but I do not believe that there is no one stronger than you among the innumerable Divine Realm experts in this vast Eternal World!”

After pausing for a fraction of a second, she went on, “Today, I’ve brought in three Divine Realm experts to fight you one-on-one. If you defeat them, I will recognize your strength and accept your proposal. But, if you are defeated by any of them, forget about the proposal.”

The second these words came out of her mouth, the audience roared.

Beside Lin Wan stood a skinny hunchbacked elder with silver hair. At her words, he forced a smile and said, “Master Xia Yan, she has spoiled by me and is always fooling around. Please don’t mind her.”

“Please don’t stand on ceremony, lord. Miss Wan’er is too noble and can’t be compared with ordinary people,” Xia Yan replied with a modest smile.

Then, he turned his eyes towards Lin Wan and said, “Miss Wan’er, the so-called title of the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World is just an empty honor, so it’s not worth mentioning. But, since you want to test me, I’ll fight with all my strength.”

“Which three Divine Realm experts did you bring? You can ask all three of them to come up and fight against me together. If I fail to defeat them within 15 minutes, it will be considered my loss!” he added.
