Chapter 2568: Killing San Shouwang

“In that case, I’ll be frank.”

Under Situ Yuan’s expectant gaze, Jian Wushuang scratched his nose and slowly said, “My intention is simple. I want to kill San Shouwang and replace him!”

Kill San Shouwang and replace him... Jian Wushuang made it sound so casual like it was such an easy matter. However, it was like a blockbuster bomb going off in their minds to Situ Yuan and the Elders.

Situ Yuan and the Elders were flabbergasted as they turned to look at Jian Wushuang in horror.

“Mr. Jian Yi, are you joking?” Situ Yuan tried to remain calm.

“I certainly don’t have time to crack such a joke. I want to kill him and will need a little help from the Situ Clan of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I wonder what Mr. Jian Yi wants us to do?” Situ Yuan asked.

“I don’t need the Situ Clan to get publicly involved or be present in the fight with San Shouwang. I’ll handle him by myself. However, the Official Army under him is such a nuisance,” said Jian Wushuang in a low voice.

“I know the Situ Clan is well connected and has good relationships with the army commanders and captains. I need the Situ Clan to send the Official Army away from the Northern Darkstar Continent. You can perhaps assign them some tasks in the wilderness or get them to solve some obstacles far away. In short, I don’t want to be interrupted by the Official Army when battling San Shouwang.”

“That’s impossible.” Situ Yuan shook his head. “The Situ Clan is indeed close with some of the army commanders and captains. However, our relationship bonds aren’t enough for us to get them to do anything or assign them a task elsewhere. There’s no way we’d be able to send them away from here.”

“Well, if there is a will, there is a way. Why don’t you give it a try?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “I can give you some time to consider. I’ll come back tomorrow for your decision. Let me tell you that you’ll only have one chance. If you miss it, there won’t be next time.

“Xin’er, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang left without turning back.

After they left the Situ Mansion...

“Mr. Jian Yi, don’t you think you’re a bit crude?” Xiao Tiexin looked over.

“Crude? It’s a simple matter so there’s no need to beat around the bush.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“True.” Xiao Tiexin nodded. “However, you’re going to kill San Shouwang—the Northern Darkstar Continent’s Territorial Lord. I’m afraid the Situ Clan doesn’t dare to help you.”

“No, they’ll help me.” Jian Wushuang gave a confident smile.

“Why do you think so?” Xiao Tiexin asked in puzzlement.

“Because they have no choice.” Jian Wushuang looked extremely confident. He did not explain further and left right after.

At the Situ Mansion in a magnificent meeting room.

A heavy restrictive shield covered the entire meeting room. Situ Yuan and the Elders were seated while donning extremely solemn expressions.

“Fellow Elders, what do you think about today’s affairs?” Situ Yuan asked.

“What else could we think? Kill San Shouwang? Jian Yi must be crazy. Who does he think he is?” A red-haired elder curled his lips.

What a joke! As the Northern Darkstar Continent’s Territorial Lord, San Shouwang was recognized as the most powerful man on the continent. He was challenged four times since becoming a Territorial Lord and killed three Earth Ultimate Gods during these challenges.

He had proven himself to be so powerful, who would simply boast being able to kill him?

“I also think it’s weird.”

An elderly woman with a snake-head crutch softly said, “Let’s not discuss whether Jian Yi can kill San Shouwang. Even if he can, why will he want to do it? As far as we know, he came to the Northern Darkstar Continent not too long ago and has always been a lone ranger with no conflicts against San Shouwang. Even if he coveted the Territorial Lord position, he could always openly challenge San Shouwang. All he needed was to wait a little longer. However, he seems like he can’t wait to take action and wants the Situ Clan to help send the Official Army away... It’s just weird!”

“Yes, I think Jian Yi is very likely with San Shouwang who’s eager to take action against the Situ family but lacks an opportunity or excuse to do so. We definitely cannot agree to help him out if he’s with San Shouwang. Once we agree to help him, we’ll fall into the trap and San Shouwang will use this excuse to destroy us. When the time comes, even our allied experts won’t be able to help us,” said a young-looking white-haired old man.

“Clan Leader, we can’t agree to this!”

“Yes, the Situ Clan will be walking on thin ice once we’ve agreed to it.”

The three Peak Ultimate Gods Elders present unanimously disagreed to help Jian Wushuang.

However, Situ Yuan frowned after listening to the Elders before he mumbled, “I think Jian Yi isn’t on San Shouwang’s side for certain and I also feel he has a reason to go against San Shouwang.”

“Oh, what’s the reason?” The Three Elders immediately looked toward him.

“Have Three Elders noticed the veiled woman standing next to Jian Yi?” Situ Yuan asked.

The Three Elders looked at each other. They indeed noticed the veiled woman but did not care too much about her.

“I’ve kept in touch with the veiled woman and even gotten her background checked. Although she has hidden information about herself well, I managed to find out things about her. The veiled woman is Xiao Tiexin, the Xiao Clan’s only survivor!” Situ Yuan said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“What?” The Three Elders were taken aback.

“Xiao Tiexin? The Xiao Clan’s Eldest Young Miss? She’s still alive and daringly appear in the Northern Darkstar Continent?”

“That’s right.” Situ Yuan smiled faintly. “How was the Xiao Clan destroyed and how deeply-rooted was Xiao Tiexin’s hatred toward San Shouwang? Three Elders probably know about it but Xiao Tiexin has been by Jian Yi’s side. Even though Jian Yi claims that Xiao Tiexin is his younger sister, I think she’s Jian Yi’s follower.

“Xiao Tiexin used to be the Eldest Young Miss of a large family but willingly followed Jian Yi. I’m sure Jian Yi must’ve promised her something! Perhaps to kill San Shouwang and avenge her mother.”

The Three Elders looked at each other with shocks flashing across their eyes.

If the veiled woman was Xiao Tiexin then everything made perfect sense.
