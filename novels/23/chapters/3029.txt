Inside the palace, which was entirely made of lilac crystals.

Lord Wu had reported Jian Wushuang’s attack on the Heaven Magus Palace to the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, who was waiting outside the palace.

In the middle of the palace, the Magic Note King was sitting on a lofty throne with a gloomy face. In front of him, there was a vague figure floating in the air.

This hazy figure was obviously the embodiment of the consciousness of an expert.

“Senior martial brother, that Heavenly Sword Marquis is simply going too far. However, junior martial brother can’t do anything to him, so I can only seek your help, senior martial brother,” the Magic Note King said solemnly.

If others were to hear the Magic Note King’s words, they would definitely be shocked.

This was because no one in the outside world knew that the Magic Note King had another senior martial brother.

After all, he was already a powerful rank four True Saint, and his senior brother...how powerful was he?

“Junior brother, I already know about this matter you mentioned. Unfortunately, I can’t help you,” the hazy figure said directly.

“Why?” The Magic Note King asked anxiously.

“It’s very simple. That Heavenly Sword Marquis’ battle strength is no weaker than yours. In a head-on confrontation, even you can’t compare to him. Although my strength is slightly stronger than yours, I’m only at the peak of the rank four. Even if I join hands with you, I can at most suppress him, but I can’t kill him. In the end, I can’t do anything to him either,” the hazy figure said.

“We can’t kill him together, but you have a suppression-type holy treasure. We can suppress him together,” the Magic Note King said seriously.

He knew his senior brother very well. Not only was he powerful, but he also had a lot of treasures. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

His senior brother had an extremely rare suppression-type holy treasure, and it was of a high level. As long as they could suppress Jian Wushuang, they did not have to worry about not being able to suppress him.

“I can suppress him, but I will not help you unless it is a hatred that will not rest until one of us is dead,” the hazy figure said.

The Magic Note King was stunned. He looked up and asked, “Senior brother, are you worried about the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?”

“Yes.”

The hazy figure nodded. “Junior brother, according to what you said, Heavenly Sword Marquis is only a rank one True Saint, and it is very likely that he has just broken through, but his battle strength is enough to rival a rank four True Saint. What does this mean? It means that he is a genius, a super-genius, a super monster!

“Such a super monster and he is from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, how can he be easily suppressed by you?

“But he has not admitted that he is a genius of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces,” said the Magic Note King.

“If he doesn’t admit it himself, doesn’t that mean that he isn’t?” The hazy figure shook his head and smiled. “No matter what, I have gone to the third heaven to explore, and I have seen a genius of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. That genius has never admitted to outsiders that he is a member of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces because they want to temper themselves, so they will not easily expose their identity!

“And the genius I’ve seen is a second level True Saint, and he’s been a second level True Saint for a long time, and his battle strength is only comparable to a rank four True Saint. Such a genius can have a certain status in the Three Palaces, and this Heavenly Sword Marquis has just broken through to the rank one True Saint, and he’s already able to fight you head-on, and he even has the upper hand in a head-on fight. Such a terrifying talent is dozens of times more outstanding than the Heaven-cleaving Palace genius I’ve seen, hundreds of times!”

“Such a super monster is definitely one of the most terrifying geniuses in the Primal Chaos Palace. Such a super monster is not only highly regarded by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, but also to a large extent, the master of the principles of the Alliance has appeared. Those who want to take them as their personal disciples, especially a genius like the Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’m afraid that there are more than one or two who want to take him as their personal disciple.”

“In other words, not only does Heavenly Sword Marquis have the Heaven-cleaving Alliance behind him, but he also has the master of a principle master. How can we afford to offend such a person?”

The Magic Note King’s expression turned solemn.

Of course, he understood what his senior brother had said.

He had asked Jian Wushuang in detail whether he came from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces before making his move.

If Jian Wushuang really came from the Three Palaces, he would not dare to kill him.

“Senior brother, this is just your guess, but what if he is not from the Three Palaces?” The Magic Note King was still unwilling to give up.

“Even if he is not, since he can become a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he must have shown his talent on the way to completing the mission. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance must have noticed him long ago, and such a genius will definitely be noticed by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance from time to time. If we join hands to suppress Heavenly Sword Marquis, there is still more than an 80% chance that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will come to us directly,” the shadowy figure said with certainty.

“In any case, as long as we make a move, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will target us no matter what. Moreover, the Heavenly Sword Marquis has only killed a few of your True Saints. At most, you will lose some face. It is not a real feud that will not rest until one of us is dead. Why do you have to take such a big risk to deal with him?”

“Junior brother, you have become the king of a region for too long. But you have to remember that after our sect was destroyed and our master died, the two of us became stray dogs. At that time, in order to survive, we used all kinds of methods. How could we still care about our ego?”

“In this world, the weak are prey to the strong. The strong are respected. What is face? Only survival is the most important thing.”

The blurry figure was very open-minded.

It was just a little bit of face. If he lost it, he would lose it. How could he risk his life just for a little bit of face?

“I understand.” The Magic Note King nodded slightly. Obviously, he had been persuaded by the blurry figure.

“It’s good that you understand.” The hazy figure said, “How about this? Don’t you want to lose face?

“Then do your best to minimize the loss of face. On the surface, you can still protect the four people under you unyieldingly. On the other hand, tell your most trusted person to meet Heavenly Sword Marquis. Tell him the location of the four people and let him kill them.”

Hearing this, the Magic Note King could not help but glare.

On the surface, he pretended to be very tough in protecting his subordinates, but in the dark, he told the Heavenly Sword Marquis where the four people were hiding?

This method...

“That Heavenly Sword Marquis only wants to complete his mission, but he has no intention of becoming your enemy. There’s no need for you to lose so much face. As long as you tell him the location of the four people, he should be able to take this opportunity to step down,” said the hazy figure.

“Got it. Thank you, senior brother.”

The Magic Note King nodded. He already knew what to do.
