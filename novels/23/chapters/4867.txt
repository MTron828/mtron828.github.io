4872 Sir Yuan

Jian Wushuang retreated slowly and the Invisible Sword had already formed quietly.

At present, this old man who was more than ten feet tall, as if he had walked out of the black fog, did not have any surging force around his body, but the great momentum that he exuded was indeed not to be underestimated.

He also realized that although this old man did not show his strength, he would probably not be at a disadvantage against Di Qing, and might even end up in a draw.

The Young Emperor stepped forward and stood in front of Jian Wushuang. He said nervously, “Sir Yuan?”

“What?” The black-robed old man looked at the Young Emperor with doubt in his eyes.

“I’m Prince Yan,” The Young Emperor added.

The black-robed old man’s eyes suddenly focused, “You are Little Yan?!”

The Young Emperor heaved a sigh of relief and said with a bitter smile, “It’s me. I thought you had forgotten about me.”

“Good kid. You’ve changed a lot since we parted.” The black-robed old man’s figure suddenly dispersed and then condensed in front of him again. His eyes could not help but reveal a look of joy.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief and put away the Invisible Sword.

It was a good result to avoid a battle that would cost a great price.

The Young Emperor scratched his head. “It’s been too long. If I didn’t remember what you looked like when I was young, I’m afraid I would be in trouble today.”

The old man known as Sir Yuan raised his head and laughed. Then, he said, “Don’t worry, Little Yan. Even if you don’t remember what I look like, I will always remember what you look like.”

“I understand,” the Young Emperor also smiled.

“Alright, since you’ve come to see these old bones of mine, then come to my palace and have a seat,” Sir Yuan said with a wave of his sleeve.

The Young Emperor nodded and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang shook his head discreetly and a flash of vigilance appeared in his eyes.

He could smell danger from the open hall. If he rashly entered, he was afraid he would encounter an uncontrollable crisis.

“This is?” He looked at Jian Wushuang.

The Young Emperor hurriedly added, “This is my close friend, Brother Jian.”

Sir Yuan nodded, “Since you are Little Yan’s best friend, I will not banish you for now. Come in with me.”

With that, his figure was like mist, floating towards the main hall.

Seeing that he had left, Jian Wushuang looked at the Young Emperor and frowned. “How much do you know about him? Do you know how many things he has been hiding from you?”

The Young Emperor was a little dumbfounded. After a while, he said, “Sir Yuan was one of the only two founding Elders who followed me closely when I was young. Although he resolved his Immortal Source not long after, I’ve always known how protective he was of me. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have left his inheritance to me.”

As he spoke, he stretched out his palm and placed it on Jian Wushuang’s shoulder. “Brother Jian, trust me this once. Sir Yuan would never have any ill intentions toward us.”

Jian Wushuang opened his mouth but did not say anything in the end.

The two figures then entered the awe-inspiring giant hall together.

What he did not say was actually quite important.

If what the Young Emperor had said was true, that Sir Yuan had died from unsealing his Immortal Source and only left behind a trace of obsession, then the current situation was completely different from what he had said.

Sir Yuan did not die at all. In other words, he still had an abundance of Immortal Source. The figure that appeared was not his last obsession, but a real Immortal body that had not been broken.

This was also why Jian Wushuang hesitated. After all, it was the right thing to do when facing an extremely powerful existence who was hiding something.

As soon as he stepped into the giant hall, the dark and gloomy aura dissipated a lot.

The first thing that entered his eyes was a series of elegant-looking pavilions and terraces, not the solemn and cold deathly silent hall.

“Little Brat Yan, Come, come, come, fish with this old man.”

On a pitch-black Immortal pavilion in the sky, Sir Yuan sat on the roof and raised his fishing rod.

“I’m coming,” the Young Emperor answered and stepped into the pavilion with Jian Wushuang.

After handing him a fishing rod, he looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Boy, do you like fishing?”

Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “It’s alright. I was addicted to it for a while when I was killing time.”

“That’s good. A steady heart with good composure is a good seedling for being able to keep her composure.” After throwing him a fishing rod, he began to fish excitedly.

The Young Emperor sat in the middle and wanted to ask about the situation, but he did not know how to start, so he hesitated.

However, it was Sir Yuan who spoke first, “Little Brat Yan, is there any change in Emperor Zhen Wuyang?”

The Young Emperor replied, “My father is still the same. He said that he settled down after establishing the Great Si Region and has been living in the Heavenly Court.”

“That’s good. His mission is complete. It’s time for him to take a break,” Sir Yuan nodded. “Tell me, why did you think of seeing me?”

“Um, that…” The Young Emperor scratched his head awkwardly. “I was here to accept the inheritance…”

When Sir Yuan heard this, she hurriedly sized him up. “Little Yan, is your Immortal body better?”

“No, I still have a flaw. I still can’t cultivate. After my father used a secret technique to raise me to the Yan Immortal level, I can’t advance any further,” the Young Emperor said.

“Damn it! You have the bloodline of a first-generation legendary Emperor. How could this happen?” Sir Yuan frowned. “Is there no chance of change?”

“Sir Yuan, I’ve accepted it. Even my father can’t do anything about it. It’s not to bad after all,” The Young Emperor smiled and said. “The reason I came here is not for myself, but to let Brother Jian accept the inheritance of Sir Yuan.”

Upon hearing this, he looked at Jian Wushuang again, “For him?”

“That’s right, I’m just a Yan Immortal who can’t cultivate. If it wasn’t for Brother Jian’s protection, I would’ve died in the assassination attempt.”

As he spoke, he told her about the complicated relationship between the Princes.

In the end, he said faintly, “In the end, our generation will only end the war with killing.”

Sir Yuan was silent. He reached out and patted the Young Emperor’s shoulder. “It’s been hard on you.”

“But my inheritance is gone.”

The Young Emperor did not understand what he meant, and his eyes were filled with doubt. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“If you had accepted my inheritance after I destroyed my Immortal Source, you would have been able to see it. But now, everything has changed.” Sir Yuan sighed. “Even though I can’t explain what has happened, it has really happened.”

Jian Wushuang also perked up his ears at this moment. He knew that Sir Yuan was about to reveal the real secret.

“The so-called Yan Immortal and even the Grand Yan Immortal are ultimately nothing more than the word ‘Immortal source.’”

“The Immortal Source is the true foundation, and it complements the Immortal root. It is the most important thing to a Yan Immortal. The shattering of the Immortal Source means the complete death of a Yan Immortal.”
