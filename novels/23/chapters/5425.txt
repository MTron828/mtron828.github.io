Chapter 5424 - 5424: Risk It All

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

With the dual cultivation of Origin Source, once he broke through, it was likely that no one could stop him, neither Shen Ling nor Zhen Ling.

Jian Wushuang hesitated.

Facing the Universe Master directly, he dared not.

The power of all things suppressed. He hadn’t tried it. If there was no danger, he could give it a try, but now…

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s hesitation, Bai Junwang immediately took action. He wanted to try.

The majestic existence remained still, and the beam of light erupted from his eyes.

He wanted to eliminate Jian Wushuang.

Bai Junwang roared. With numerous divine bodies, he transformed into a figure as vast as the Universe Master and walked towards him generously.

As the light column condensed, Bai Junwang flashed to the top, but the light beam continued to burst straight out.

“Come!”

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth, not hesitating for a moment, and directly rushed up.

He bypassed the straight line and rose into the air.

Seeing Jian Wushuang, Bai Junwang revealed a fiery gaze and nodded.

The others, watching these two, initially thought they were insane but quickly grasped the situation.

“Stop them!”

The Universe Master’s physical body!

A piece of flesh would be enough for them to comprehend, let alone the complete body.

Not only Gui Ling and others but also Zhen Wuyang, Chishui, and Tongtian burst forth.

However, not everyone was equally fervent.

Ultimate Emperors pursued different goals, and it was normal. His cosmic secret technique was close to reaching completion, and the breakthrough wouldn’t take long.

From Emperor to Universe Master, it was a qualitative change from space to time. The nature was different, and the difficulty of breakthrough could be imagined.

Especially mastering the Ultimate Dao of Destruction.

It required shattering the entire space and reshaping a timeline. And space existed within every moment of time.

In the vast universe, as long as there was a breath of time, a space was established, carrying the universe’s spatial dimensions.

The people of Elder Palace approached, seeing that Shang remained unmoved.

They spoke, “Not going forward to take a look?”

“No need. It’s useless for me. Let them fight!” Shang shook his head.

Situ Nan exclaimed, “Not even helping?”

“How could it be that easy!” Shang’s words had just fallen when the Universe Master’s physical body indeed began to change.

Gui Ling, who ran even faster than Jian Wushuang Bai Junwang, was directly smashed to pieces by a palm.

After reassembling, Gui Ling no longer dared to approach.

Bai Junwang sneered, “Fool!”

To claim this physical body, the first step was to suppress it.

Jian Wushuang’s figure transformed into a black hole, releasing the Power of All Things. The familiar and longing force made the body constantly shrink, ultimately turning into a towering figure, finally starting to move its steps.

It charged towards Jian Wushuang.

“Is this what they call suppression?” Jian Wushuang was exasperated.

This was clearly using him as bait.

Attracting the opponent to his side.

The Power of All Things was a rare and precious Origin Source even in ancient times.

It required the condensation of countless types of Origin Sources, and it had to be the Ultimate Origin Source.

Just like the Myriad Origin Sources.

However, the Myriad Origin Sources encompassed ordinary elements.

The condensed power of all things had impurities.

Only when the Ultimate Dao converged could the pure Power of All Things within Jian Wushuang be condensed.

He was not in the ancient times. Otherwise, he would have been worshipped as an ancestor in ancient times.

A vast amount of Power of All Things scattered from the black hole and entered the Universe Master’s body.

Originally, he thought his Origin Source was robust, but as it continued to converge, he found that it couldn’t stop, and the effect was very weak.

There was no way. The opponent was the Universe Master. Awakening this body was too difficult. Jian Wushuang was only a Dao Lord; there wasn’t enough Power of All Things to awaken a Universe Master.

Bai Junwang didn’t dare to delay. He directly abandoned the physical body, and the illusory shadow of his divine body rushed into the Universe Master’s body.

Just as he entered, he was shaken out by the protective consciousness of the body.

Clearly, the body had not yet awakened.

“Wait a little longer!” Jian Wushuang roared, his brows furrowed.

This time, he staked his life to assist Bai Junwang. After this is done, it wouldn’t be excessive to kowtow a few times in gratitude!

Jian Wushuang once again condensed a massive Power of All Things, digesting up to 90 percent of his Origin Source throughout his body. He then invested it into the Universe Master’s physical body.

Bai Junwang advanced once again, holding his breath. But this time, Zhen Wuyang and others came over.

Qing Mang, Zhi Shan, and Lan Yu intercepted them.

From a distance, Shang, who had abstained from intervening before, now took action. Initially, he refrained to allow personal cultivation opportunities, but now he assisted because someone was blocking the path of Zhen Wuyang and others.

Not only him, but Situ Nan from the Elder Palace also made a move.

“How arrogant!”

The three elders fought desperately. They could resist just these three Inheritors, but Shang and Situ Nan were not weak. Both were at the pinnacle of tier 6, approaching supreme-peak.

Jian Wushuang didn’t have much time to spare on these matters. He shouted,

“Hurry and go in, they can’t hold on for too long!”

Below, Bai Junwang was also decisive. The phantom of the divine body merged with the Universe Master’s physical body.

With a momentary gap as the physical body awakened, Bai Junwang seized the opportunity and entered.

After Bai Junwang converging into the physical body, Jian Wushuang came to a halt.

As soon as the eyes of the physical body opened, they slowly closed again.

If the awakening truly happened, all of them would be finished.

Exhaling, Jian Wushuang’s aura suddenly plummeted, weakened to the extreme.

Several cloaked Emperors grabbed him and hastily retreated to recover their strength.

Upon restoring the Origin Source, he frowned, realizing that Gong Miaoyi was missing. After scanning the surroundings, he found that she had already joined forces with the Crown Prince of the MO Luo Kingdom, Luo Sha.

“Damn it!”

He knew Gong Miaoyi was extraordinary, having the Ultimate Origin Source within her; how could she be controlled?

The opponent also possessed the Bloodfall Crystal, a treasure capable of activating relics, not to be underestimated.

The Elder Palace had that small seal, and the Bloodfall Crystal had fallen into the hands of Gui Ling.

Now the three elders of the Kui were under siege, and the situation was dire.

If these three elders couldn’t hold their ground, they would face the danger of being eliminated.

If they failed, it would all be in vain.

Bai Junwang was currently integrating his physical body, unable to be of any assistance. His strength was too weak, and rashly joining the battle would lead to his demise.

What to do?

Jian Wushuang glanced at Gui Ling and the others.

They were hurt by the Universe Master’s physical body and dared not approach again.

Just as he observed Zhen Wuyang and others in a confrontation, Jian Wushuang discreetly transmitted, “Island Lord, when a rabbit dies, the fox grieves. You know the situation. I’ve handed over Gong Miaoyi to you. But if you wait for them to settle scores with us, don’t expect to survive either.”

Gui Ling, who was sitting cross-legged in the distance, was stunned for a moment, then turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

He had checked the strengths of the 5 Emperors before entering. He also witnessed the release of the mysterious power that assisted Bai Junwang in entering the Universe Master’s physical body..
