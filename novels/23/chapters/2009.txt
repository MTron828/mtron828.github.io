2010 The Master of Silver-Winged God Mansion!

Above God Mansion was state!

The biggest territory in Three-Emperor World would be state!

A state conquered seven God Mansion. Hence, the eighty-four God Mansions were under twelve states.

Every state would have a supreme leader. According to Tian Xingzi, the leader of the state would be one who reached Peak Chaotic Realm level.

“Twelve state-leaders, eighty-four master of God Mansions, thousand three hundred regions…” Jian Wushuang was astonished at the piece of information that he retrieved.

He wanted to know more information from Tian Xingzi, such as the secret of the world.

The world was in the huge, dark millstone that destroyed everything. There was definitely a great secret.

It was a pity that what Tian Xingzi knew was limited. He who was only a master of a region, an ordinary Early Stage Chaotic Realm naturally wouldn’t qualify to know much about the secret of Three-Emperors World.

“Double Dragon Region is under which God Mansion. Who is the master? And how can I find the master?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Mister, Double Dragon Region is in Silver-Winged God Mansion…” Tian Xingzi immediately replied.

After finding out everything that he needed to know.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a sword light slashed and chopped Tian Xingzi’s head directly.

Jian Wushuang was an outsider and he only asked Tian Xingzi the general questions about Three-Emperors World. Tian Xingzi definitely would find him suspicious. Hence, he naturally couldn’t stay alive. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The moment Tian Xingzi died.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were three figures that appeared next to Jian Wushuang and they were naturally Abysmal Saint Master and the other two members.

“Did you hear that?” Jian Wushuang looked at the three of them.

Their expressions were extremely solemn.

“A thousand and three hundred regions. Every master of a region would be a Sir God. In other words, there would be a total of one thousand and three hundred Sir God experts. Now, there are eighty-four masters of God Mansion, which are eighty-four Emperor God experts. Lastly, the twelve state leaders, which are twelve Great Emperors!!!” Great Emperor Zhi Luo couldn’t help but be astonished, “So powerful. The Three-Emperors World is so powerful!”

“They are very powerful,” even Abysmal Saint Master nodded in agreement. “These region masters, God Mansion masters and state leaders are merely those with titles. In Three-Emperors Worlds that is so huge, it is impossible that all experts take up the position as the masters or leaders. There definitely are more experts that we don’t know of. If all of them add up, I am afraid that their power wouldn’t be any weaker than Eternal Chaotic World!”

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Jiu Qiao frowned.

The Three-Emperors World was really powerful. They could compare favorably with Eternal Chaotic World and they might even be more powerful. It was absolutely not plain guess but it was really possible.

“There is a dark millstone that destroyed everything on the outside; there is Three-Emperors World with many high standard cultivators and experts on the inside. This…” The four of them looked in distressed.

“Regardless, let’s report the information here to Emperor Bai first,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“Yes,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded.

After they entered Three-Emperors World, their connection with the outside world was sealed off.

Regardless of if it were a communication token or consciousness reincarnation, they couldn’t work.

However, Emperor God Jiu Qiao could use his doppelg?nger to stay connected to Sanctuary alliance. It was also the reason why Emperor Jiu Qiao was one of the four members in the expert troop.

In Eternal Chaotic World, in the void near the dark millstone, there was a lofty palace towering there. The palace maintained the same traveling speed as the dark millstone.

In the palace, Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger was seated there.

He reported whatever he knew about Three-Emperor Worlds after he entered the dark millstone.

When he finished, the surrounding Great Emperors were solemn.

“Too, too powerful!”

Red Dragon King spoke first, “From the region master, God Mansion masters and the twelve state leaders that we know of, their fighting power of Almighty level could compete against Sanctuary Alliance. If taking those experts who didn’t take up the post into consideration, the power of Three-Emperors World absolutely wouldn’t be any weaker than the forces in Eternal Chaotic World combined.”

“If Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace have hidden power…”

The surrounding people became quiet.

The silence went on for a while until Emperor Bai finally spoke, “Three-Emperors World might be very strong but we couldn’t determine if the experts in Three-Emperors Worlds would come out to fight a life-and-death war against Eternal Chaotic World. Moreover, if they were to turn out in full strength, Eternal Chaotic World could still gather all forces to compete. But the most crucial part is still the dark millstone!”

“If the dark millstone doesn’t stop, no preparation or skills will be of use, no matter how how many experts we have or how powerful they are!”

Everyone nodded.

That was true. The dark millstone was the crucial part.

Only when the dark millstone was completely destroyed or stopped would the Eternal Chaotic World would stand a chance to live.

As for within the dark millstone, the experts from Three-Emperors World weren’t the ones that they needed to deal with.

“Jiu Qiao.”

Emperor Bai looked at Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger, “Tell Abysmal Saint Master to find the truth behind the Three-Emperors World. It is impossible that such a powerful world wouldn’t carry any core secret. The region master that they questioned earlier was probably too weak and isn’t qualified to know them. Tell them to slowly go up by ranking and find a stronger God Mansion master and to state leader. They have to unearth the secret of the world!”

“And, they have to speed up and not delay any further!”

“Yes.”

Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded solemnly.

Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger shared the message to the expert troop who was far in Three-Emperors World. They received the message that Emperor Bai conveyed.

“Go up by ranking?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, “I already found out where the Silver-Winged God Mansion Master resided from Tian Xingzi. The God Mansion Master is an Emperor God level expert. He definitely knows more things than Tian Xingzi.”

“Mm, let’s head to look for the Silver-Winged God Mansion Master,” Abysmal Saint Master agreed.

The four of them immediately departed according to the route that Tian Xingzi provided earlier. They traveled in the direction where the Silver-Winged God Mansion Master resided.

However, the four of them didn’t know that when they plunged in the direction of the master of Silver-Winged God Mansion, there were a few figures that were traveling to the residence of Silver-Winged God Mansion Master in the far-away void.

The few figures were soaring with a terrifying aura.

Especially a bald man, who was only about five foot three. Although the bald man was shorter, his body was extremely muscular. His aura was the strongest and his rage was also the most ferocious among all!!

His name was Ling Zong but he had a nickname: Beast!
