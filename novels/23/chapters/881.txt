Chapter 882: A Trap?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang had a long talk with Ling Long.

Ling Long had been struggling in Fog sea for all these years. Her strength was quite good in the Eternal Realm, but being alone in the Fog Sea, the danger is everywhere. She was very vigilant but still almost killed many times.

Luckily, Ling Long escaped death over and over again with her various skills. She came to Star Island at random.

She had never seen Jiu Zui since the day they ran away separately. She had no trace of him.

“Our destiny is at the mercy of God. Only Jiu Zui himself can save his life. Nothing we can do.” Jian Wushuang sighed lightly and added, “You can live here for the moment. Although the island is a prison, no one will kill you anyhow.”

“Cool.” Ling Long nodded. From what Jian Wushuang had said she learned a little about the island and thought it was a good place for her.

Jian Wushuang helped Ling Long find a dwelling place and then went back to his house directly.

Upon his arriving, Qian Yu came over.

“Blood mountain, someone tells me there will be a fight between you and Tian Quan three days later, and the cost is enormous for the loser. Is this true?”

Qian Yu had been cultivating beside Star Jade Wall for a period of time and he wasn’t there when Ling Long came.

“Yes. Anything wrong?” Jian Wushang looked at Qianyu. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

For the last two years, Jian Wushuang had spent most of his time improving his skills. But in his spare time, he drank alcohol with Qian Yu now and then, and gradually they two were sort of buddies.

“Damn! You were in Tian Quan’s trap. ” Qian Yu moaned.

“Trap? What trap?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well, you’ve been here just two years, and don’t know the situation. On Star Island, there are twelve Kings renowned for prominent skills. Tian Quan ranks 6th regarding his strength among them. As far as I know, he had been immersing in practicing a secret skill all these years. Probably just around these days, he might make crucial progress. ”

“Once he succeeds, his strength will grow dramatically. Then, except for the king who had past Second Level Dark Tower, he will second to none. I guess the reason he wanted it in three days is that he will become very strong at that time and then he can defeat you easily.” Qian Yu explained.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, but not surprised at all.

“Oh, you are totally not worried about that, are you? ” Qian Yu gazed at his partner with an astonishing look.

“Nothing to worry about. Just take measures as the situation calls for.” Jian Wushang smiled confidently.

“Right then. Happy to hear you are fully prepared. Wish you good luck.” Qian Yu left immediately.

Jian Wushuang stood where he was with a hint of chill in his eyes.

“What a trap! He wants to beat me hollow three days later when he is strongest. Unfortunately, he won’t succeed but be defeated instead.” Jian Wushuang laughed callously.

Is it a trap of Qian Yu for him?

Actually, that was also what Jian Wushuang wanted.

“Even though his strength will rise dramatically after his breakthrough, such an improvement is far from enough to help him pass through the second Level of the dark tower. ”

“But my situation is different!”

“My Sword Heart has reached Level five. And with the first Divine Yin Thunder, my strength has tremendously improved. Definitely, my skill is better than him. Maybe I can pass through Level Two of the dark tower. ”

“I was about to have a try today, but in case of any trick from Tian Quan, it’s better to wait until three days later before the duel starts.”

As he made up his mind, Jian Wushuang immediately headed to the palace of Yin Thunder again to improve Divine Yin Thunder inside his body.

Three days elapsed quickly.

In the center of Star Island, there was an extensive drill ground. It was so vast that even Dao Masters could fight without any restraint.

The drill ground was made to killing for experts on the island.

At the moment, thousands of hundreds of people gathered around the drill ground.

More than nine out of ten experts (over 600) stuck on the island arrived. Even most of dignitary Twelve Kings showed up.

It was the day Jian Wushuang and Tian Quan would have a duel.

It was a battle between two great experts. Moreover, the loser would suffer.

If he lost the fight, one promised to give the other treasures worthy of one trillion.

And if the result was the other way around, the loser had to give up all his possession and left Star Island for 100,000 years, like gone forever.

Such a big duel was particularly remarkable in this place.

Early in the day, Tian Quan wore a purple gown, standing in the center of the drill ground grimly. He was waiting for Jian Wushuang.

Everyone cannot help but look at him while remarks were inundated the whole ground.

“This guy has passed the first Level of the dark tower a long time ago and then obtained the strongest secret skill on the island. The skill is hard to get, but he has been keeping learning. I bet he is in good command of it. His strength is absolutely improved.?”

“Oh? But I’ve heard he made no progress in a phase for a long time and devoted full energy into it. I wonder if he takes a big step. ”

“I guess he does.”

“Rumors go that the reason why Tian Quan wanted to have the duel today is that his strength could grow much bigger after those days.”

“Really? Then such an arrangement is totally a trap for Blood Mountain, isn’t it? ”

They just continued to exchange their opinions. Some uttered in a deep voice while others blurt out loud.

Tian Quan heard them clearly. A cold smile showed on his face.

“Blood Mountain? Just a newbie here, reckless and stupid. Soon I will let him know who is the best on Star Island.” Tian Quan said to himself piercingly.

What he didn’t know was that, when he was waiting there for a fight, his enemy appeared in the dark tower.

Second level inside the dark tower.

With the Gold-armored Ancient God appearance, Jian Wushuang stared at Blood Demon in high rank in front of him with a hint of dark golden light in his eyes.

Two years ago, he stood the same place, trying to defeat high ranked Blood Demon with his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. He failed downright as a result.

Today, two years later, he came here for another try
