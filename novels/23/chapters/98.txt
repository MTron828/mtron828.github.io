Chapter 99: Bold Jian Wushuang

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang stood with a solemn expression.

“Palace Master White is right. To learn three kinds of sword essence at the same time is to do three things simultaneously. It is too difficult. But that is only for ordinary geniuses, not for me!”

Jian Wushuang didn’t think he was superior and better than other geniuses. However his circumstances were quite different!

“I practice the Heavenly Creation Skill. It is a defiant form of cultivation. It is different from others!”

“I have also awakened my Sword Soul and have completely mastered it, while others have not.”

Jian Wushuang clearly knew what road he should take.

The burden was really too heavy for others to master three kinds of sword essence at the same time. But it was easy for Jian Wushuang to do it for his Sword Soul which had awakened.

After staying in the Innumerable Huge Mountains for half a year, he learned three kinds of sword essence at the same time, which was equal to doing three things simultaneously. But he still comprehended them at an amazingly fast speed, way beyond anyone’s imagination.

There were only three kinds of sword essence, which was definitely not his limit.

If there was a chance, he was even eager to study the fourth Sword Essence of Dripping Water.

“After I have completely awakened Sword Soul, the speed at which I study the sword essence is much faster than others. With such a powerful Sword Soul, if I only concentrated on studying sword essence of the Gale and the Earth, I would be wasting all my talent.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were resolute.

He agreed with Palace Master White’s opinion, but he would not follow that advice blindly.

After all, he decided on what path he would take.

Two days later, the Temple Master Yao in the Fire Temple gave another lecture, and Jian Wushuang went there to listen once more.

When Jian Wushuang appeared again, Temple Master Yao showed a little weird expression. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the lecture, Temple Master Yao directly said, “On the road of Martial Arts, do not get distracted. It is necessary to remember to devote yourself to studying one road until the end. Then the ultimate result you will achieve will be much better than those who are distracted.”

Temple Master Yao casually said it, but many Disciples of Dragon Palace who listened to the lecture knew that he was talking about Jian Wushuang.

So did Jian Wushuang. But he just shrugged with resignation.

After Temple Master Yao finished his lecture, many Disciples of Dragon Palace went out of the temple one after another.

After leaving, Jian Wushuang indistinctly heard people discussing.

“Who did you think the words of Temple Master Yao referred to in today’s lecture?”

“Undoubtedly, he referred to Swordsman.”

“Well, I guess so. He is particularly gifted at sword essence of the Gale and the Earth. However, he is insatiable, even expecting to master the Sword Essence of Raging Fire?”

“He is so courageous that he could learn three kinds of sword essence at the same time. It has been so hard for me to obtain one kind of essence.”

“It is said that Palace Master White had warned him in person not to do too many things at one time. However, it is obvious that he is not following her advice.”

“Hum, he is too arrogant to follow the advice of Palace Master White.”

In a manor of Dragon Palace, Nangong Jie as well as other two Disciples of Dragon Palace gathered together and talked about Jian Wushuang.

“Ha ha, that Swordsman is so bold and naive that he doesn’t even listen to Palace Master White. He insists on studying Sword Essence of Raging Fire. He will soon come to an unfortunate end.”

“Learning three kinds of sword essence at the same time. Who does he think he is?”

“What an idiot! I am treating him as my opponent but never expected that he is such an idiot!”

“Ha ha!”

Nangong Jie crazily and madly laughed.

He was very jealous of Jian Wushuang and bitterly hated Jian Wushuang.

The reason for jealousy was that Jian Wushuang had made such great progress after he joined Dragon Palace for only three months.

He hated that Jian Wushuang had defeated him in front of so many people that he lost all his face and his 12,000 points were gone.

Now, Nangong Jie was very pleased to know that Jian Wushuang was so arrogant as to study Sword Essence of Raging Fire.

However, Palace Master White who warned Jian Wushuang was furious after hearing that Jian Wushuang did not follow her advice and continued to study the Sword Essence of Raging Fire.

“Bastard!”

“Arrogance!”

“Ignorance!”

“This guy, does he really think he is so great?”

Palace Master White was so disappointed about this.

There were lots of Disciples of Dragon Palace, even many outstanding and talented people, such as Bai Cheng and Su Lie who were senior people, and even Yang Zaixuan who passed the Eighth Level of Dragon Gate as soon as he came into Dragon Palace.

However, she thought most highly of Jian Wushuang as he progressed so quickly and she hoped that he would obtain huge achievements in the future.

But now, Jian Wushuang was not satisfied with sword essence of the Gale and the Earth. He insisted on studying Sword Essence of Raging Fire.

How could she not be sad or angry?

“Let it go,” Palace Master White suddenly calmed down and said, “He chooses his own way. Others can’t force him to change. Since he wants to take the extreme way, just leave him alone.”

“It’s a shame given his talent.”

“Alas ~”

Palace Master White slightly sighed and quickly stopped thinking about it.

After that, she put Jian Wushuang to a lower level in her heart.

In the manor.

“Lao San, I hear a lot of Disciples of Dragon Palace talking about you, and they say you are at the fork of your cultivation. What’s exactly going on?” Wang Yuan asked with frowning.

“I also heard about it.” Su Rou said.

“There is nothing special,” Jian Wushuang immediately told them briefly.

“Lao San, Palace Master White had warned you in person not to study the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. Should you not follow her advice?” Wang Yuan asked feeling surprised.

“Although what Palace Master White said made sense, I’m the one that knows myself best and exactly what to do next,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Really?” Wang Yuan stopped frowning and immediately laughed. “Lao San, I trust you. Since you think this choice is right, it is certainly right. As for others, nobody cares what they are thinking. Even Palace Master White may be wrong.”

Obviously, Wang Yuan disagreed with what Palace Master White said.

“I agree with you. You should go your own way. What other people say is just a reference,” Su Rou said.

Jian Wushuang felt touched and warmed to the bottom of his heart, affectionately looking at Wang Yuan and Su Rou.

“Well, it’s time for you to work hard at cultivating. Then your strength will prove that you were right when others look at you,” Wang Yuan said and laughed.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

As time passed, Jian Wushuang persisted in cultivating his own way, ignoring the Disciples of the Dragon Palace doubts.

Whenever there was a Temple Master of Fire Temple using swords, Jian Wushuang would get there to listen to their lessons.

Thus, his comprehension of the Sword Essence of Raging Fire did not fall behind at all.

Seven days passed quickly.

In his manor, Jian Wushuang finished practicing swordsmanship and was sitting beside the stone table. He took out a pot of wine and drank it.

“Ten days passed … After getting the Bottleneck-breaking Elixir, I immediately swallowed it. But I didn’t sense the sign of a breakthrough until now. It seems that the first Bottleneck-breaking Elixir is unable to take effect.” Jian Wushuang secretly sighed.
