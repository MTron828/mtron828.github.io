“Oh no!” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed.

If it was just a simple soul attack, Jian Wushuang would not take it to heart.

His physique was special, so any soul attack would be ineffective against him. Even if it completely destroyed his soul, he could instantly repair it.

However, if his opponent’s soul attack was accompanied by the charm skill, it would be completely different.

The charm skill was not aimed at the human soul, but at the consciousness!

Jian Wushuang had experienced the charm skill of the Nine-tailed Clan. Previously, in the Blood Wave Realm, the charm skill of the Nine Palace Saintess alone could not affect him. But now, the charm skill was used by Da Yu, who had reached the fourth realm of the void, the charm was many times stronger than the charm of the Nine Temples Saintess.

Even though Jian Wushuang’s state of mind was very strong, under the charm of Da Yu, his state of mind was shaken and his consciousness was about to fall into a daze.

But before his consciousness fell into a daze, he had already taken out the second bead. As the bead broke, the shocking power contained in it immediately burst out.

Of the two beads that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance had given him, one was refined by Palace Lord Shuiyun and had already been used up by him. As for the current bead, it was refined by Palace Lord Askance.

Palace Lord Askance was ranked second among the three Palace Lords of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. In terms of strength, he was even stronger than Palace Lord Shuiyun.

Furthermore, Palace Lord Shuiyun’s strongest secret art, the Shuiyun World, more or less had the effect of trapping and entangling the enemy. Its true might was not particularly powerful, but Palace Lord Askance was famous for his absolute offensive techniques.

Rumble ~ ~ ~

The world trembled as endless black air waves surged up. These black air waves were like rolling devil clouds.

These devil clouds crazily gathered together, forming an extremely enormous devil might.

The devil might was imposing, suppressing everything in the surroundings. And in the center of this devil might, a black devil god that was thirty feet tall was condensed.

“What is this?”

“What a terrifying demonic aura. Isn’t this pressure a little too strong?”

“I’ve seen this Demonic God before. This is the heaven-seeking Demonic God, one of the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. It’s the heaven-seeking Demonic God’s famous ultimate move!”

“Heaven-seeking Demonic God? This is the heaven-seeking Demonic God?”

“What a good fellow. Previously, it was Palace Master Shuiyun’s famous ultimate move. Now, it’s the heaven-seeking palace master’s famous ultimate move. What is the relationship between Heavenly Sword Marquis and the Three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?”

The experts spectating the battle were all staring in shock at the Black Demonic God that appeared in the middle of the battlefield.

Askance Palace Lord was named after him. This move was even more famous than Shuiyun Palace Lord’s Shuiyun world.

“Askance Palace Lord?” Da Yu, Da Su, and the Principles Masters of the nine-tailed race all frowned as they looked at the Black Demonic God.

Askheaven Empyrean was a peak existence that they did not have the qualifications to interact with.

“Hmph, how about Askheaven Fiendcelestial? You killed my sixth sister. Even if Askheaven Empyrean from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were to personally come, you will still die!” Da Yu’s voice was cold, her eyes suffused a demonic green light. This green light burst forth like a green sun that illuminated the entire world.

Suddenly, the green light turned into a huge green light beam and shot directly at the Asura Demon God.

“This move...” Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank slightly.

He had seen the same move from the Nine Temples Saintess, but the power of this move was obviously much stronger.

It was not surprising that this move should be the inheritance secret skill of the Nine-tailed Clan. Just like Jian Wushuang was a member of the ancient clan in his previous life, some of the ancient clan’s inheritance secret skills were very powerful.

The Nine-tailed Clan was ranked as one of the four great divine clans as well as the ancient clan, so their strength was naturally extraordinary. The inheritance secret skill of the Nine-tailed Clan, of course, was not weaker than that of the ancient clan, the power of this inheritance secret skill was so strong that it could even pose a threat to some experts of the five void realms.

However, the one standing in front of Da Yu was Askance Demon God, the famous move of Askance Palace Master.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had regained his consciousness. He looked at the green beam of light and his eyes flashed. He immediately began to guide Asura Demon God. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Break!”

With a low roar, Asura Demon God, who was three meters tall, looked cold and emotionless. Under Jian Wushuang’s guidance, Asura Demon God threw a punch forward.

This punch was extremely brutal and contained endless demonic power. In an instant, it smashed into the green light.

Boom!

The void trembled. Without any suspense, the green light was smashed into pieces and spread out in all directions.

Then Asura Demon God took another step forward and threw another punch. This punch was aimed at all the people of the Nine-tail Clan.

“Attack together!” Da Yu growled.

Immediately, nine experts from the nine-tailed race, including Da Yu and Da Su, took action to block the punch.

However, under the punch that contained demonic might, the nine figures retreated explosively.

With just one punch, the nine Principles Masters from the nine-tailed race were sent flying. This was the strongest heaven-seeking fiendcelestial of the heaven-seeking palatial lord!

“So strong!”

“This is Askance Sky Demon God!”

“Too strong!”

“The power of one punch is actually so terrifying?”

The surrounding experts who were watching the battle could not help but exclaim in amazement when they saw the scene on the battlefield.

The nine-tailed race members had already steadied themselves, but most of them had ugly expressions on their faces.

“Is this the Askance Sky Demon God that mother mentioned? He is really strong,” Da Su said in a deep voice.

“He is very strong. However, this heaven-seeking Fiendcelestial is merely a technique left behind by the heaven-seeking Palace Lord. It is not something that the heaven-seeking Palace Lord can personally use. Although its might is equally powerful, every time the heaven-seeking Fiendcelestial uses an attack, it consumes a large amount of energy. The energy that this heaven-seeking Fiendcelestial has condensed is not much. At most, it can only use a few more attacks before its energy is completely depleted!”

“We don’t need to fight it head-on. We just need to force it to use up its strength,” said Da Yu.

Everyone from the Nine-tailed Clan nodded.

“Let’s go!”

Soon, the nine members of the Nine-tailed Clan attacked again. Jian Wushuang had no choice but to lead the Asura Demon God to fight.

However, just as Da Yu had said, the Asura Demon God was only one of the skills left in the pearl by Palace Master Asura. As the number of attacks increased, the power of the Asura Demon God would be depleted, it would not last long.

Without Askance Demon God, it would be difficult for him to deal with the Nine-tailed Clan alone.

However, there was good news. While Jian Wushuang was fighting the Nine-tailed Clan with Askance Demon God, Temple Master Bai Xing secretly told him that reinforcements from the Temporal Temple were coming!
