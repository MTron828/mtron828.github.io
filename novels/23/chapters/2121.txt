Chapter 2122 Jian Wushuang“s Retaliation

“Looks like I underestimated the capabilities of the Acheron Palace.” Jian Wushuang thought solemnly.

He made a decision instantly.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang left the altar.

He appeared in the dark space which was severely damaged. He scanned the emperor gods sitting at the other altars and said, “All of you continue to meditate and cherish this opportunity. Let me handle the commotion outside.”

He then left the eleven emperor gods behind and dashed out of the palace.

“There shouldn’t be any problems since the Sword Emperor decided to handle the matter personally. Let us continue.” Underworld God said before he closed his eyes.

The remaining ten emperor gods composed themselves and continued meditating.

Outside the Heaven Repairing Palace, Demon King Chen Yu was still in a frenzy, throwing punches at the palace. The palace looked like it was going to collapse at any moment.

None of the experts from Sanctuary Alliance could stop him as he rained down punches ruthlessly on the palace.

Right then…

Whoosh!

A beam of light burst forth from within the palace. The moment it appeared, a terrifying sword aura swept out in all directions.

Jian Wushuang had fire in his eyes. Divine power raged all around as Blood Mountain Sword turned into lightning and slashed towards Demon King Chen Yu.

With his current power level, even a casual slash was very powerful to the point a stage three great emperor like Demon King Chen Yu would be threatened.

“Huh?”

Demon King Chen Yu frowned. His fist changed its target, from the palace to the sword light.

Clang!

The collision between flesh and metal made a thunderous sound.

After the collision, Demon King Chen Yu staggered while Jian Wushuang took three steps back.

While Jian Wushuang was moving back uncontrollably… Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Seven beams of golden light glowed.

Every beam of light was a sword which contained great power. They were his Hong Jun Golden Swords.

Before Jian Wushuang entered the Heaven Repairing Palace, his understanding of the Spacetime Doctrine had limited him to being able to command only 6 of these swords. After half a month of intense cultivation, his understanding had reached the peak of the ninth level within the Doctrine Palace, hence he was able to command the seventh sword.

The seven Hong Jun Golden Swords were like seven shooting stars. They streaked across the space and appeared in front of Demon King Chen Yu together.

“Humph!”

Demon King Chen Yu grunted as demonic mist surrounded him. His right hand enlarged and encompassed all seven swords. With a bang, the seven swords flew backwards.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned dark upon seeing this.

“Demon King Chen Yu has grasped a little of Rules of Order. He is much stronger than me if he uses his power together with his secret skills. Each slash by any of my seven swords has the power of a top tier stage two great emperors. However, he simply used his fist and punched all swords away. This power…”

“It’s a pity that he has come too early. If he came ten days later, I would have successfully Celestial Immemorial Body. Using that power, it would be much easier to deal with him,” Jian Wushaung muttered.

The Immemorial Celestial Body would not only make his diving body stronger, but also strengthen his body’s self-defense mechanism.

He should also experience a leap in the quantity and quality of his divine power.

When he had first cultivated the first scroll of the Immemorial Celestial Body, the quality of his divine power had increased threefold.

Even though the second scroll would not have such a crazy leap, there would still be a leap in his power.

Using that insane divine power, he could match Demon King Chen Yu in power without even grasping Rules of Order!!

However, the fact was that he had not cultivated the second scroll of Immemorial Celestial Body, hence his fighting power was not at that level.

“Even though my fighting power is lower, I can still fight him head on using the unique properties of an inverse cultivator.” Jian Wushuang thought as a glimpse of sternness flashed across his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang? It’s you again!!!” Killing intent spew forth when Demon King Chen Yu saw him.

He hated Jian Wushuang to the core.

At first, Jian Wushuang had ventured into the Three Emperors World and destroyed the Supreme Emperor Stone. This had caused their plan of using the Supreme Emperor Stone to destroy the Eternal Chaotic World to fail.

Then, Jian Wushuang had helped to expose Zi Xu’s true identity as a spy.

Jian Wushuang had used himself as bait and deduced that there was a spy among the higher ups within the Sanctuary Alliance. The reason why the spies among Sanctuary Alliance were found and killed were largely due to him.

Lastly, the reason why the plan for the Special Tribes had failed was also due to Jian Wushuang!!

This meant that the reason why the Acheron Palace had failed over and over again was because of him. This was also the reason why he had been shamed in front of Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen.

“Looks like it’s my lucky day. You managed to escape the other time in the Three Emperors World, but you won’t be so lucky this time around.

“What a joke. You couldn’t even kill me the previous time. This time, you probably can’t even fight me head on.” Jian Wushuang said coldly as he attacked.

“Haha. You’ve got guts!!!” Demon King Chen Yu fought back, excited. He completely ignored the Heaven Repairing Palace.

Compared to the emperor gods, Jian Wushuang posed a bigger threat to the Three Emperors World!

He was an inverse cultivator like Emperor Bai with terrifying growth. If this were to continue, he could become the second Emperor Bai. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Killing him would mean much more than killing the emperor gods within the Heaven Repairing Palace.

Demon King Chen Yu was confident about being able to kill Jian Wushuang.

Back in the Three Emperors World, the reason Jian Wushuang had survived was because Emperor Bai had arrived on time to save Jian Wushuang. Another reason was because all Jian Wushuang did was run.

Now that Emperor Bai was not around, no one could stop him.

Furthermore, Jian Wushuang did not show any signs of wanting to escape and wanted to fight him straight on.

How could he miss such a precious chance?

“Die, Jian Wushuang!”

Demon King Chen Yu roared as six more arms grew to make up a total of eight.
