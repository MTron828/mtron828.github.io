Chapter 1421: Finally Passed The Test!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The cloud over Jian Wushuang lingered for ten years.

“It’s been ten years.”

“It’s the first time I’ve seen someone’s God Test should last ten years!”

Even Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao, who had stayed for a long time in the Firmament World, felt surprised by Jian Wushuang’s God Test.

Ordinary practitioners’ God Tests, even the longest, usually lasted for only several days.

But now, it had been ten years since the beginning of Jian Wushuang’s God Test and it was still going on.

“His mind has been on the verge of collapse for ten years. He is truly resilient.” Hall Master Yuan Palace praised Jian Wushuang.

“Even Real Gods of the vast Eternal Chaotic World, including you and me, would have gone mad from staying in such a torture for ten years, but Jian Wushuang has endured.” Lei Chao was also surprised.

This kind of test was really painful.

Almost every breath was a kind of suffering. Ordinary practitioners, who could only maintain for several days, were considered to be good.

But Jian Wushuang had resisted for ten years. No wonder Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao couldn’t help but admire him.

Just then…

“Huh?” Hall Master Yuan felt that Jian Wushuang’s breath was calming down.

“Maybe the God Test is coming to an end.” Lei Chao said.

For ten years, the breath of Jian Wushuang had been violent, just like a mad man.

But now, the breath of Jian Wushuang had quickly calmed down.

In just a moment, his breath had completely calmed down, and his grim face gradually relaxed.

In the heavens, the cloud gradually dissipated.

A golden light suddenly appeared, illuminating the whole heaven.

“Divine Light!”

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao looked at each other and smiled.

“Haha, the God Test is over!” Hall Master Yuan was excited.

“Our ten years’ wait has been rewarded!” Lei Chao said happily.

Divine light was the light that only appeared after the God Test was finished.

When Jian Wushuang passed his first God Test there was a similar Divine Light, so this time, the light showed that Jian Wushuang has succeeded!

Bang!

A golden light came down do Jian Wushuang in nine rays, and in an instant he was completely enveloped by the warm light.

Like the first God Test, the light came in nine rays, which were now embracing Jian Wushuang.

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao were waiting and watching the whole process.

The baptism of the Divine Light did not last long, and it soon ended.

As soon as it was over, the clouds dispersed, and the whole sky was again bright.

After being embraced by the light, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes.

The moment he opened his eyes, a powerful light burst from his eyes. The light was so powerful that it flashed and tore apart an island in the distance directly.

“The God Test is over now!”

Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly with his heart full of joy.

“Congratulations.” King of Venomous Worms said. He also felt relieved for Jian Wushuang’s success.

During the ten years when Jian Wushuang endured the torture, King of Venomous Worms always feared that Jian Wushuang could go mad.

“Jian Wushuang. Come on.” Hall Master Yuan came to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang said hello to Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao respectfully.

“Congratulations, you have passed the God Test!” Hall Master Yuan smiled, “Now you only have to pass another God Test and then you will be a top genius in the future!”

“I’m looking forward to that day, too.” Lei Chao also laughed.

Jian Wushuang was delighted.

Jian Wushuang had passed two thirds of the God Test, each round of which was risky.

There was still only the last step, and also the most difficult one.

“Jian Wushuang, what happened to you in the God Test?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

Lei Chao also looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

They did not know what Jian Wushuang had experienced, but they could feel the danger of the process.

After a while, Jian Wushuang said, “I went through the Nine Lives Reincarnation Test!”

“Nine Lives Reincarnation Test?” They were curious about the details.

Then Jian Wushuang recounted his experience in a simple way.

Through the simple description, Lei Chao and Hall Master Yuan could still feel how dangerous it was and they were shocked.

“Nine Lives Reincarnation?”

“You had to integrate the memory of the nine different lifetimes, and even the illusory consciousness, into your own consciousness?”

“What a terrible torture!”

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao couldn’t help exclaiming.

This was absolutely the most unusual and dangerous God Test they had ever heard of.

“Nine memories and consciousness were imposed on me, and they were beyond what I can control. I was on the verge of madness but, fortunately, I reached the first level of the mind status from the experience in the Mind Cliff. As such, I could remain clear-minded, which was the most important thing!”

“In these ten years, every moment was a torture of life and death for me because I had to fight with an illusion. I had to stay alert or I would collapse. Honestly, I feel proud of myself” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He knew how difficult the God Test was. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Even Real Gods found it hard to overcome, but Jian Wushuang had survived.

It was a kind of unimaginable resilience and perseverance that had enabled him to survive.

“Though, without the appalling thunderstorm, the second round of the God Test was far more difficult than the first one.” Jian Wushuang said.
