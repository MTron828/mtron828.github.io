Chapter 2550: Lavish Gifts

“That’s a smart move.”

Shi Qianhan coldly sneered, “Although he went to those clans to find fault with ridiculous excuses, he didn’t ruin their relationship or offend them. On the contrary, he tried his best to protect their dignity while leaving them no choice but to go along with him. It’s a shame he uses such methods but his strength is undeniable.”

“Yes, I can see that the clan experts were laughing when Jian Yi left with no signs of any displeasure,” said the old man in black.

“That’s true. He probably needs a lot of Primordial Stones. Otherwise, he won’t use such despicable and self-degrading means. Those clans are also well aware of this and are willing to give away those Primordial Stones since the amount he asked for isn’t too much and rather give in to him,” said Shi Qianhan.

“Will Jian Yi come after us if that’s the case? We did have some issues with him earlier,” said the old man in black.

“How dare him!” Shi Qianhan’s voice turned cold. “Unless he has gone crazy, he won’t dare to target the Shi Clan!”

That was true.

Jian Wushuang only targeted some of the relatively weaker mid-tier clans. He would definitely want to stay away from those prominent and powerful clans like the Shi Clan or Wu Clan.

After going to a few more clans, news started to spread and some mid-tier clans took the initiative to send Jian Wushuang Primordial Stones.

“Mr. Jian Yi, the Han Clan have just sent you ten thousand Primordial Stones on top of some other cultivation resources and treasures.” Xiao Tiexin handed an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang rubbed his forehead with a rather strange expression and darted a look toward the table next to him which had no less than ten Interspatial Rings.

He did not expect that after going to three clans, the other Northern Darkstar Continent clans voluntarily made their ways and proffered him gifts.

It seemed that those clans had communicated with each other and came to a consensus to send him rather generous gifts. Those gifts ranged from between 7,000 to 8,000 Primordial Stones while some went up to 10,000 and 20,000 Primordial Stones.

He had received around 140,000 Primordial Stones from those clans in addition to the 50,000 Primordial Stones each from the Ye, Jiang, and Huo clans. He had accumulated a total of 290,000 Primordial Stones on hand!

290,000 were a huge number of Primordial Stones but Jian Wushuang was still unsatisfied.

He needed at least 500,000 Primordial Stones for his breakthrough to the Ultimate God Realm and still had 200,000 more to go.

What those clans were doing made it difficult for him to continue his Primordial Stones milking plan.

Those clans probably knew he needed Primordial Stones and took the initiative to give him after all. Therefore, they had given him quite a fair bit of Primordial Stones.

No matter how brazen Jian Wushuang was, it made no sense to find fault with those clans who extended an olive branch out to him.

“Now, I can’t continue doing what I was doing but there are only two hundred ninety thousand Primordial Stones which is a far cry from what I need. What should I do now? Shall I go for the three top-tier clans?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes as he pondered.

Those who presented him gifts were small and medium clans.

On the other hand, the three top-tier clans had been rather quiet.

Jian Wushuang could no longer go to the small and middle clans, hence he turned his attention to the three top-tier clans.

However, the top-tier clans were difficult to handle.

“Each of the three top-tier clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent has four to five Peak Ultimate Gods with each no less powerful than the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor. They might shun me if I visit them on my own.” Jian Wushuang brushed his nose as he carefully considered his next course of action.

While Jian Wushuang was pondering...

A thick voice suddenly rang, “Is Mr. Jian Yi in?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head.

Xiao Tiexin went out to check and returned after a while.

“Mr. Jian Yi, someone from the Situ Clan is here,” announced Xiao Tiexin.

“Situ Clan?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The Shi Clan, Wu Clan, and Situ Clan were the three top-tier clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent.

The Situ Clan was the weakest among them.

The Shi Clan and Wu Clan had not done anything, but the Situ Clan took the initiative and approached him.

“Please bring him in,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

Xiao Tiexin soon led a middle-aged man wearing a loose and long robe to Jian Wushuang’s location.

The middle-aged man was gentle and polite. He bowed to Jian Wushuang with great humility and introduced himself upon seeing Jian Wushuang. “I’m the Situ Clan Leader, Situ Yuan. A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Jian Yi.”

“Are you the Situ Clan Leader?” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised.

The middle-aged man before him was obviously a High-Level Ultimate God, yet he was the Situ Clan Leader?

He even bowed to Jian Wushuang while bearing such a noble identity?

“You’re so polite and humble. Please have a seat.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Situ Yuan immediately took a seat.

“I wonder what brings you here today?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Situ Yuan said, “I’m here today to be your friend, Mr. Jian Yi. I know you’ve visited the Ye Clan, Jiang Clan, and Huo Clan some time ago before asking them for a lot of Primordial Stones. Are you in urgent need of Primordial Stones?”

“Yes, you’re right. I urgently need a large number of Primordial Stones.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Situ Yuan smiled faintly and immediately withdrew an Interspatial Ring.

“There are one hundred thousand Primordial Stones in this Interspatial Ring. I hope it’ll be helpful to you, Mr. Jian Yi.” Situ Yuan handed Jian Wushuang the Interspatial Ring.

“One hundred thousand Primordial Stones?” Jian Wushuang was impressed.

Xiao Tiexin was also shocked to hear that.

The other small and medium clans could only offer 10,000 to 20,000 Primordial Stones at most while the Situ Clan straightforwardly offered 100,000 Primordial Stones.

It was such a lavish gift! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I’m concerned.” Jian Wushuang smiled but did not accept the Interspatial Ring.

“Mr. Jian Yi, what’s on your mind.” Situ Yuan was humble and patient.
