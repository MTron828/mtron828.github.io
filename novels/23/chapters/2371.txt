Chapter 2372: Pavilion of Divine Mystery

“Gratitude?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Gentlemen, I would like to speak to Junior Brother Wushuang in private for a moment.” Yin Long looked at the people behind him.

“Senior Brother Yin Long, we’ll see you later in that case.”

Immediately, the few outer disciples respectfully left, leaving only Jian Wushuang and Yin Long at the courtyard.

Yin Long sat down on the stone stool right next to Jian Wushuang.

“Senior Brother Yin Long, you’ve defeated Qian Xia?” asked Jian Wushuang casually.

Yin Long shook his head. “No. Although I didn’t defeat him, we were tied. The Elders decided to accept both Qian Xia and me as core disciples since they couldn’t decide on a clear winner.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang finally understood.

“That’s also thanks to your last night’s advice, which once again motivated my will for battle. If I had been using merely my full force, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to achieve today’s result,” said Yin Long.

“It’s really because your fundamental abilities are not weaker than Qian Xia, it really doesn’t have much to do with what I’ve said.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Yin Long did not dwell on the issue and directly asked, “Junior Brother Wushuang, to be honest, the one who has the qualification to be called ‘Number One’ in the Outer Court is neither Qian Xia nor me. It should’ve been you. I don’t understand as you’ve met every criterion to become a core disciple, why didn’t you even take part in the Selection?”

He crossed hands with Jian Wushuang the day before. Even though Jian Wushuang was still not in the same state as him, his abilities were definitely above Yin Long. Yin Long did not even have a chance to retaliate.

Abilities like that were truly above him and Qian Xia. He even felt that Jian Wushuang’s battle abilities were not below regular experts in Divine Demon Realm.

However, having such strong fundamental abilities yet happily remaining as an outer disciple seemed odd to Yin Long.

“It’s really no big deal. I don’t like to be leashed, so being an outer disciple is the best choice for me. As for being a core disciple, I have no interest whatsoever.” said Jian Wushuang.

“Is that so?” Yin Long wryly smiled.

He had such strong desires to become a core disciple that he was willing to sacrifice everything for it and yet Jian Wushuang did not have the slightest interest!

“Senior Brother Yin Long, please keep what happened last night to yourself. Please don’t tell anyone as I don’t want to stand out. It would be wonderful just to peacefully stay in the Outer Court.” said Jian Wushuang.

Yin Long nodded and said, “Understood. Now I finally understand why Elder Wujian treats you differently—it’s not because you have some unique relationship with him, but to him, your gift and abilities are much more outstanding than most core disciples.”

Jian Wushuang shrugged without giving a comment.

Yin Long very soon left. He had already become a core disciple, hence naturally he would have to move into the Inner Court.

As for Jian Wushuang, he continued staying in the Outer Court as a humble outer disciple.

Although the doubtful voices against him were getting louder, he did not pay attention to them. He only wanted to restore his strength in peace and quiet.

Two months passed by in a flash.

Narcissus Island’s Divine Mystery Pavilion!

The Divine Mystery Pavilion was an agency on Narcissus Island that gathered intelligence and assigned missions to its disciples.

There were a huge number of disciples on Narcissus Island, staying on the island, and practicing in isolation was not always good for personal growth. Some real-life experiences were always needed. The missions assigned by Divine Mystery Pavilion played an effective role in building experiences.

One day the Circle of Elders’ Ninth Elder, Wujian, arrived at the Divine Mystery Pavilion.

“Ninth Elder, what brings you here?” A purple-clad disciplinary elder respectfully walked over.

“I’m here to see what missions are available in the Pavilion this time around,” said Wujian.

“Please wait, let me show you all the missions that we’re ready to assign.” The disciplinary elder walked away and soon brought back a lot of jade slips for Wujian.

“Ninth Elder, these are all the missions. Please have a look.” The disciplinary elder was extremely polite. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wujian nodded his head slightly and started browsing through the missions.

There were all kinds of missions prepared for Narcissus Island’s disciples in the jade slips.

The rather regular missions that were supposed to be assigned to the outer disciples.

The harder missions that were suitable for the core disciples. There were even missions for experts among the core disciples to gain experiences.

Wujian browsed through more than ten missions. Although there were various levels of difficulty, he could not find one that caught his eyes.

Until he saw the thirteenth mission.

Wujian’s eyes brightened up. “Oh? This mission is at Luogu Territory?”

“Luogu Territory? Do you mean the mission to the Mu Clan?” The disciplinary elder came over.

“Yes, Mu Clan.” Wujian nodded.

“This mission is quite unique and tricky, we are planning to send a few core disciples who have reached the Divine Demon Realm but it still feels insufficient.” said the disciplinary elder.

Wujian nodded and smiled. “It’s a little insufficient. How about this? Get one more person—bring Jian Wushuang, it should suffice.”

“Jian Wushuang?” The disciplinary elder doubted.

He knew all the core disciples on Narcissus Island, including the two who had recently been selected—Yin Long and Qian Xia.

However, Jian Wushuang was not within his knowledge.

“This Jian Wushuang is currently in the Outer Court,” said Wujian.

The disciplinary elder was startled. “Outer Court? An outer disciple? Ninth Elder, are you suggesting to let an outer disciple join Xiao Heng’s group of five to carry out the mission?”

“Why? It isn’t allowed?” Wujian glanced over.

“Oh n-no. Since the Ninth Elder has given the order, of course, it is doable.” The disciplinary elder awkwardly smiled.

An elder from the Circle of Elders was considered extremely powerful on Narcissus Island. As it was only a mission, of course, Wujian’s request was not a problem.

“Well then, go ahead and organize it.” Wujian waved his hand.

“Yes.” Nodded the disciplinary elder.

“Letting an outer disciple join a mission with five core disciples who have reached Divine Demon Realm at Luogu Territory, what is happening here?” The purple-clad disciplinary elder felt the situation to be very strange but went on to organize it anyway.

Seeing the disciplinary elder leaving, Wujian mysteriously smiled.

“That kid has been lying low since he arrived on the island, never offending, crossing hands with anyone, or showing his true abilities.”

It would be such a waste to let him permanently relax like that. How could I let him be?”
