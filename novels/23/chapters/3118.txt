Chapter 3119: The Great War Had Begun

——

“It’s true that the Purple Cloud Pavilion is tyrannical. However, the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion is far away from the True Martial Kingdom. How could the Purple Cloud Pavilion be interested in such a distant place?”

“Moreover, the territory near the True Martial Kingdom is the territory of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. Even if the Purple Cloud Pavilion really wants to extend their hand, they can not treat the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion as a decoration!”

Elder Zi Xing looked at Chu Yi with a cold gaze. “Therefore, I am certain that the genuine force country that you said is dependent on the Purple Cloud Pavilion is just empty words. Or perhaps, it is just the two of you making the decision on behalf of the Purple Cloud Pavilion.”

When they heard elder Zi Xing’s words, Chu Yi Xiao and deacon long frowned.

“Humph, this old guy is quite smart. So what if these words are from the two of us? I am a core disciple of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Naturally, my words represent the Purple Cloud Pavilion.” Chu Yi laughed.

“Hehe, a mere core disciple can’t represent the entire Purple Cloud Pavilion. Even this rank six True Saint beside you can’t represent the entire Purple Cloud Pavilion,” Elder Zi Xing snickered, “a rank six True Saint is merely a deacon in the Purple Cloud Pavilion. He can’t even be considered as one of the upper echelons of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. If he wants to represent the Purple Cloud Pavilion, he must at least have an elder who is at least a rank seven True Saint!”

The corner of Deacon Long’s mouth twitched slightly.

Elder Zi Xing was right. He was only a Deacon, and his position in the Purple Cloud Pavilion was not high. Of course, he could not represent the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

However, no matter what, he was still a genuine rank six True Saint. He also cared about his face. Of course, he was a little angry that Elder Zi Xing had looked down on him in front of so many people.

“Cut the crap. The Purple Cloud Pavilion of the True Martial Kingdom is doomed. If you know what’s good for you, get out of here. Anyone who still stays in this mansion in 15 minutes will be killed without mercy!” Deacon Long shouted.

“Haha, What Big Words!”

A burst of laughter suddenly sounded. The evil master who had been standing beside Jian Wushuang stepped forward, he sneered and said, “You are a Deacon of the Purple Cloud Pavilion, right? How dare a mere Deacon talk so brazenly and kill you without mercy? Humph, if the Pavilion Master of the Purple Cloud Pavilion said this, I’m afraid he would have some courage.”

“Boy, who are you?” Deacon Long looked at the evil master.

Although the evil master was only a rank one True Saint, he was too confident. Even a rank six True Saint like him dared to talk so brazenly, which made Deacon Long not dare to underestimate him.

“My name is the evil master, and this is Mirage Water. Both of us are from the Primitive Palace. Today, the two of us have decided to stay in this mansion and not leave. If you have the ability, you can directly kill the two of us later.” The evil master sneered.

“Primitive Palace?” Deacon Long’s expression immediately changed.

Of course, he knew about the Primitive Palace of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

They were the genius disciples of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Primitive Palace.

Under normal circumstances, the geniuses of the Primitive Palace could become the disciples of some Invincible Saints. If they were lucky, they could even become the disciples of the Principles Master. They would definitely have great achievements in the future. Such genius disciples…the Heaven-cleaving Alliance paid great attention to them.

Now, the two genius disciples of the Primitive Palace were right in front of him. If he killed them…he could immediately imagine what would happen to him.

Without a doubt, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would definitely kill him, and they would even vent their anger on the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

And when the time came, forget about protecting him, the Purple Cloud Pavilion would probably think of ways to capture him and personally send him to the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces to apologize.

“I absolutely can’t kill these two people!” Deacon Long had already made up his mind, he immediately said seriously, “So they are the genius disciples of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. For the sake of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, I won’t make things difficult for you, but everyone else must die!”

“Do it!”

Deacon Long glanced at the Third Prince beside him.

The Third Prince did not want to talk nonsense with the Sixth Prince for a long time. After hearing Deacon Long’s words, he waved his hand.

“Except for the two geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, kill everyone else without mercy!”

A cold voice reverberated in the sky.

Instantly, the eyes of the three hundred plus experts behind the Third Prince emitted a rainbow light.

A shocking killing intent instantly swept out.

“Kill!”

“Kill them all!”

“All of these people must die!”

Numerous low cries reverberated in the sky.

These over 300 experts all attacked at the same time.

A terrifying aura that contained killing intent shot straight into the sky. A large number of experts attacked at the same time. The layers of arrays in the sky above this mansion could not withstand the attacks of so many experts and instantly collapsed.

Once the array was broken, the experts from both camps faced each other.

“Attack, kill!” Sixth Prince also let out a fierce shout.

Instantly, many experts from Sixth Prince’s camp also moved, including the Purple Blood Camp.

The Purple Blood Camp was worthy of being Sixth Prince’s most elite force. The experts of the Purple Blood Camp were not only strong individually, but they were also well-trained and knew how to cooperate with each other. Although this small Purple Blood Camp only had about forty experts…the battle power that burst forth in an instant was extremely powerful.

As soon as the two sides’ experts came into contact, the Purple Blood Camp charged at the front like a sharp knife. It directly charged into the Third Prince’s camp and then began to slaughter wantonly, the Third Prince’s camp was actually instantly shattered into pieces by the Purple Blood Camp’s charge.

After that, a fierce chaotic battle began.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

The shouts were deafening. Nearly 600 True Saint experts from both camps were fighting each other.

Jian Wushuang, the Sixth Prince, Mu Qing, the evil master, Mirage Water, Elder Zi Xing, and Xin Zong had not made a move yet. They just stood in the air above the mansion and looked at the battlefield.

“Sixth Prince, the Purple Blood Camp in your hands is quite powerful. There is a big gap between the two sides, but your Purple Blood Camp has completely equalized the battlefield,” the evil master looked at the battlefield in front of him, he laughed casually.

“The Purple Blood Battalion is the most elite force in the Zhen Wu Kingdom. Father had given me this force in the beginning. However, after my father went missing, the Zhen Wu Kingdom underwent a great change. Many soldiers in the Purple Blood Battalion defected. Some of them were pulled over by Third Brother. Moreover, during the battles between Third Brother and me, some of the soldiers also died. That is why there are only a few people left. However, even if there are only forty or so soldiers left, the combat power of the Purple Blood Battalion is still very strong!”

“All these years, the reason why I have been able to fight against the third elder has been because of the Purple Blood Battalion!” The Sixth Prince said solemnly as he clenched his fists tightly together.

The evil master raised his brows but did not say anything more.

At that moment, on the other side of the battlefield, Deacon Long’s figure moved and he charged straight toward the battlefield.

Deacon Long moved and Elder Zi Xing immediately made his move as well.
