Chapter 409: Jian Wushuang, Erupt!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How can it be possible? ”

Sir Axe, Zang Feng, and Feng Zi were petrified.

There were so many squads in the vast Outer Area that it was almost impossible for two squads to meet twice. However... they had now run into the same people.

The situation was exactly the same!

“It’s a trap!”

“These people must have left marks on us or on our treasures.”

Having fallen for the same trap twice, Sir Axe realized that the rival squad had specifically targeted them.

Lei Dao, Shi Ling, Yan Mo, and Bing Yue looked sick with worry.

The two hostile squads had surrounded them, cutting off all openings for escape.

It was difficult for them to escape, but if they had a head-on confrontation... three of the 20 opponents were experts at the Peak of Stage Two.

As for Sir Axe’s squad, only Sir Axe himself had the battle strength of the Peak of Stage Two.

The immense gap in strength between the two groups could not be bridged even with Jian Wushuang’s Realm Technique.

“It’s over.”

Sir Axe involuntarily trembled in fear.

“Swordsman, Zang Feng, Feng Zi, Lei Dao, Shi Ling, Yan Mo, Bing Yue,” Sir Axe called. There was a hint of despair in his eyes. “The two squads must have left a mark on me or on one of my treasures. I’m afraid that they deliberately released me after they ambushed my squad the last time.

“Their intention was to ambush me again.

“They have 20 experts, including three at the Peak of Stage Two. We will not be able to fight them, so follow my orders later and find an opportunity to escape. We might yet survive with the help of Swordsman’s Realm Technique.

“Let’s do our best.” Sir Axe roared.

“Bastard, even if I have to die, I’ll drag you down with me,” Lei Dao said. His eyes were frenzied.

“Try our best!”

“We won’t make it easy for them to kill us!”

Zang Feng, Shi Ling, and the other comrades were resolute. Crazed determination shone in their eyes.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.?“I have to use my full strength this time.”

The two hostile squads approached. Jian Wushuang and his comrades were besieged by them.

The elder with sword-shaped eyebrows looked at his opponents and sneered. “I let them go the last time to catch a bigger fish. It’s now time to take my hook back.”

“Right, we can’t use the same trick again,” a fat middle-aged man, an expert at the Peak of Stage Two, said.

“We don’t need to show mercy. Let’s kill them all!” the elder with sword-shaped eyebrows responded in an icy voice.

“Let’s do it!” The two hostile squads obeyed the elder’s order and charged forward.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Strong waves of power propagated through the area and shook the ground.

The 20 experts darted toward Jian Wushuang and his comrades from all directions. Most of them had fevered looks in their eyes. Some of the attackers cackled loudly.

“Swordsman, display your Realm. Gentlemen, let’s fight,” Sir Axe said, barely hiding the desperation in his voice.

The battle started.

A terrifying Sword Essence suddenly erupted from the squad of eight experts. Sir Axe and Lei Dao looked toward its source and saw two tremendous Sword Soul Phantoms rise.

Each being almost 100 feet tall, the Sword Soul Phantoms towered above them like mountains.

Splendid, terrifying Sword Essence radiated from the two Sword Soul Phantoms. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

30 feet of Sword Soul Phantom was third-grade while 100 feet of Sword Soul Phantom was considered first-grade. This meant that there were two first-grade Sword Souls.

It was therefore not surprising that the Sword Essence was so powerful.

“Gosh!”

“What’s this?”

“Sword Soul Phantom?”

Sir Axe, Lei Dao, Shi Ling, Yan Mo and other comrades were stunned.

The two Sword Soul Phantoms were so close to them that they could feel their effects more than the others.

“Swordsman!”

Sir Axe looked at the owner of the two Sword Soul Phantoms. It was Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was emotionless as he turned his palm upwards. The Triple-kill Sword appeared in his hand.

The power of the first-grade magic weapon immediately radiated outwards.

This was accompanied by a mighty Blood River which swept out and covered the entire area. The two hostile squads were trapped in it.

The invisible Sword Realm hung over the Blood River.

Jian Wushuang had just performed Road to the Underworld and Tenfold Realm.

The power from the Double First-grade Sword Souls gathered in Jian Wushuang’s body.

Jian Wushuang had reached his peak strength when he produced the Triple-kill Sword.

He stepped forward, crossed in front of his comrades and stood in front of the elder, who had been leading the charge.

Jian Wushuang brandished his Triple-kill Sword ruthlessly.

The strike was silent and was accompanied by neither sword light nor shadow.

Nevertheless, the elder with sword-shaped eyebrows and his squad felt an impending sense of doom.

“Damn it!”

The elder had recognized the two Sword Soul Phantoms.

The Blood River also imposed great pressure on them.

Jian Wushuang’s strike chilled the elder’s blood.

“Quick, let’s block him together!” The elder with sword-shaped eyebrows shouted.

His people started to display their best Killing Moves.

The elder with sword-shaped eyebrows and the fat middle-aged man also exerted their full strength.

However...

Shua!

An invisible wave gave off a faint glow in the dazzling sunshine.

It was a streak of sword light, which was almost imperceptible as it flashed across the sky.
