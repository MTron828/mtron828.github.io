Chapter 412: The First Battle in Inner Area

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was filled with anticipation for the battle.

He had been waiting for this moment for so long.

After he entered Divine Land, he had held his power back for every battle.

He had wanted to push himself to his peak power during the fights, but he hadn’t been forced to that point. For the battle where he and his team had been trapped in Outer Area, he had erupted with his full power and killed all his opponents. However, it had happened so quickly and was over before he could enjoy the fight.

He had not had a chance to show his real strength until this moment in Inner Area.

“Let’s fight!”

Jian Wushuang directed a fiery gaze at the coming storm.

Abruptly, the storm’s progress stopped and a spooky figure dived out from it. This figure split the void and approached Jian Wushuang swiftly.

“So fast!”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Based on what he had read, he knew that while Wind Demon was an ordinary expert at Stage Three, he was good at comprehending Gale Origin and had a terrifying moving speed, of which many top experts at Stage Three were jealous.

Jian Wushuang was cautious and unleashed his Triple-kill Sword, which struck forward like a dragon.

The skill he displayed was the Dragon-killing Sword Technique, a first-grade sword technique that he had gained in Sword Tower.

This was just the first move, but its power was astounding.

Wind Demon looked calm. With a twist of his hands, he made a fist. As his fist collided with Jian Wushuang’s sword, the sword shook.

Wind Demon then gathered a large amount of Gale Origin and shaped it into a long spear. The spear radiated with a chilling aura as it targeted Jian Wushuang’s head.

The spear pierced through the void at an amazing speed.

Jian Wushuang managed to lift his longsword just in time to hold the spear off. He was forced backward several hundred meters before he could stabilize his stance.

“Boy, don’t tell me that is all you have.” Wind Demon looked down at Jian Wushuang from the Void.

Wind Demon hadn’t shown his full strength, and yet he had overpowered Jian Wushuang. From the moves they had exchanged, he could tell that Jian Wushuang was far from reaching Stage Three.

Jian Wushuang remained silent, but his eyes grew bright as powerful killing intent swept over him.

Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!

Boom! A blood river spread across the sky. It covered most of the area and hung over Wind Demon.

Sword Realm, Tenfold Realm!

Slaughter Domain!

Jian Wushuang displayed two more techniques. The three skills worked in concert to press Wind Demon downward.

“How powerful his Realm is! Even I’m suppressed by it.”?As Wind Demon was lost in thought, he suddenly sensed an overpowering Sword Essence.

He immediately looked toward its source and paled visibly when he saw two huge Sword Soul Phantoms rising behind Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Soul Phantom!”

“Two Sword Soul Phantoms of 30 meters tall!”

Wind Demon was stunned.

Few experts on Flaming Battlefield had awakened souls, and Jian Wushuang was the first expert he had met with two awakened souls.

“Wind Demon, let’s try another round.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

Swish!

Covered by Sword Essence, Jian Wushuang turned into a sharp sword that cut through the void toward Wind Demon. As Jian Wushuang swung the Triple-kill Sword at Wind Demon, the two Sword Soul Phantoms attacked with him.

The power of the Sword Soul flowed to the sword and elevated the force of the attack to a new peak.

Wind Demon looked grave as he saw the approaching sword and heard its piercing scream.?“He showed his power of top Stage Two in the previous attack.?Now, with the help of Double Sword Souls, his attack has become more powerful than mine.”

Wind Demon was experienced in fighting, so he was able to assess the situation.

Streams of green energy rose up from his feet like wind.

Jian Wushuang’s sword pierced Wind Demon’s chest, but he quickly realized that it was a shadow and not Wind Demon’s real flesh. Wind Demon reappeared beside Jian Wushuang.

“How could he be so fast even when affected by my Realm?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

He thought he had been fast, but Wind Demon was swifter even when being repressed by the blood river.

“Wind-shadow Kill!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Wind Demon stretched his hands at Jian Wushuang. From his fingers, streams of green energy gathered together into more than ten sharp spikes.

The spikes glowed with cyan light under the sun. They turned into beams of light that rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang tried to dodge all the spikes, but one spike found its target on Jian Wushuang’s shoulder and cut his skin.

“Eh?” Wind Demon was astonished.

The spikes were not that powerful, but with so many of them and at their high speeds, they should have done more damage than just causing a superficial wound to Jian Wushuang.

“He has a very strong body.” Wind Demon reasoned.

Suddenly, he felt a fierce wind behind him. He turned around and found a scarlet palm formed by the Blood River aimed at him.

The palm slapped at Wind Demon. Wind Demon regained his balance. His body flashed, leaving shadows in the Blood River. In the very next moment, he appeared in the sky far away, beyond the reach of the river.

Standing at the center of the river, Jian Wushuang glanced at Wind Demon.

“Swordsman, you’re indeed powerful. I’m looking forward to fighting you next time.” After saying this, Wind Demon disappeared.

“Is he gone?”

Jian Wushuang sighed as he watched Wind Demon leave.
