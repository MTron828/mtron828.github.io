Chapter 5482 ¬†Leaving

Jian Wushuang was not surprised by this.

At the time, if Liu San'er were to say that he wanted 1,000 taels of gold, he would comply.

These people couldn't kill him either.

If Liu San'er chose to leave this place with him, he would break free, and then extract the soul fragments of Thirteen Niang and Liu San'er from this timeline. This would give them a chance to be reborn.

"It's time to end this!" Jian Wushuang raised his hand, and a strand of golden sword appeared in it.

A terrifying aura instantly swept through the heavens and earth.

The old man who was fishing on the cloud-layered mountain felt the pressure and his expression changed. He shouted, "Kid, you dare!"

Jian Wushuang threw out the golden sword, hands behind his back, a fierce wind blowing, yet he stood still. His hair fluttered with the burst of wind as he loudly declared, "Why wouldn't I dare!"

Boom!

The next moment, the bodies of the constables began to rupture, and the scene around Jian Wushuang shattered. Not only the people in the city, but the entire city itself trembled.

The old man in the clouds wanted to intervene, but the figure of Divine General Moyin slowly approached, raising his hand to stop him.

The Divine General reminded, "Lord of the Clouds, we must not interfere!"

"He will destroy the entire space; this space is not like the universe space!" Lord of the Clouds was somewhat anxious.

The Demon Sound Divine General's eyes narrowed, coldly saying, "You know this is a mortal space! This is your creation; if he can restore his strength, it's also because of you!"

Lord of the Clouds, whose name was Yun Zhong, was also one of the 18 Divine Generals. Though of the same status as the Demon Sound Divine general, there was a gap in their strength.

Among the 18 Divine Generals, Divine General¬†Moyin ranked higher, while he was at the bottom.

Hearing the reminder from Divine General¬†Moyin, Lord of the Clouds could only swallow his anger. He watched as Jian Wushuang in the mortal world's space, ascended in broad daylight, leaving the original location.

Swish, swish, swish!

Three figures appeared in a vast palace.

Not only did Jian Wushuang come out, but Dongsheng and Wanyan also arrived at this place together.

"I was in the underwater world, how did I end up here?" Dongsheng wondered.

Wanyan's expression was equally serious; he had originally been in the cellar.

Jian Wushuang, however, remained calm. There was just one thing he hadn't anticipated ‚Äì by breaking the mundane space, he unintentionally brought these two along.

After arriving at the treasure hall, the three didn't immediately embark on exploration. Instead, they recounted their own experiences.

Upon hearing everyone's stories, Jian Wushuang realized he had the worst of it.

One became the Dragon King, commanding winds and rains in the underwater world, while the other wreaked havoc in the cellar.

Only Jian Wushuang fell into the mortal mundane world, reduced to a beggar.

"I was so close to clearing it, what a pity!" Emperor Dongsheng regretted it.

Jian Wushuang vaguely glossed over his own experiences. He feared that if he revealed the truth, these two would be compelled to kill him.

They were on the verge of clearing, while Jian Wushuang endured torment in the oppressive city.

"Never mind, this place is strange; let's first figure out what's going on here!" Wanyan shook his head, dispelling the group's disappointment.

They turned their attention to the treasure hall, another cultivation site.

However, this one was adorned with opulence, everything shining brightly. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The three were cautious, still haunted by their encounter with the Blood Demon last time, which had left them terrified.

However, the Blood Demon had consumed their flesh and blood as a preparation for them to enter the mundane mortal world. This time, there shouldn't be any danger in the cultivation site.

Buzz!

A sudden hum echoed.

The three immediately felt something was amiss.

"How dare you intrude into my territory!" a gloomy voice rang out, startling the trio.

Jian Wushuang, in particular, stepped back. Above the palace, a majestic dragon slowly descended, its enormous eyes fixated on them.

"This is the land of the Dark King! Trespassers shall die!" The colossal dragon's body began to shrink, transforming into a figure standing before them, over two meters tall.

Dongsheng sensed the oppressive aura emanating from the figure and quickly explained, "Senior, we are Inheritors here to receive the inheritance. We were unintentionally transported here; please forgive us!"

"Hmph! Still trying to explain!" The dragon-turned-human flapped its wings, sending the three flying.

They were no match at all.

Jian Wushuang cursed inwardly. It must be because he had destroyed that mortal space; someone behind the scenes sought revenge, leading them to be transported here.

The dragon-man, with just his aura, nearly killed them. He walked towards them, a body covered in red scales, each emitting an aura comparable to the perfectly cultivated divine body.

This dragon-man wasn't a puppet but a powerful practitioner on the path of a divine body.

Jian Wushuang quickly discerned the opponent's details.

However, knowing more at this point was useless. They lacked the strength to fight back; it seemed they were destined to die!

"Senior Moyin, are you trying to lead us to our deaths?" Jian Wushuang couldn't help but shout in anger.

What he did in the mortal world was like a slap on Moyin's face, yes...

But was it necessary to go this far?

He could gather a bit of mental power; that wasn't his fault!

It could only be said that the person who arranged that world was too twisted.

Or maybe he was too powerful.

Only when the latter spoke did it sound a bit arrogant, but Jian Wushuang didn't dwell on it.

Hearing Jian Wushuang mention the name of the Demon Sound Divine General, the dragonman paused, stopped in his tracks, and exclaimed, "Moyin? Do you know the Divine General?"

"I do. The three of us were sent here by Divine General Moyin!" Jian Wushuang explained hastily when he saw the other party halt, "We came to inherit the legacy. If you don't believe it, you can ask the Demon Sound Divine General."

Dongsheng and Wanyan, having followed suit, quickly nodded.

The dragonman was somewhat puzzled. He was the strongest War God under the throne of the Dark King, and the Dark King was a Universe Master under the command of Qishen.

He was aware of the 18 Divine Generals.

However, all the Qishen had fallen for an unknown period, and he had been in a constant slumber. How was it possible for someone to appear here now?

Rip!

The sound of space being torn resonated, and an old man walked out from the crack, leaning on a cane.

"Dragon God, long time no see!"

"It's you, Lord Yun Zhong!" the Dragon God exclaimed.

The newcomer was the old man who orchestrated things in the mortal world.

"Is what they said true?" Dragon God still found it hard to believe. He distinctly remembered that everyone had fallen.

The Lord of the Clouds ignored him, instead looking at Jian Wushuang and the others, apologizing with a smile, "Sorry for being late. Originally, I thought you wouldn't be here so soon. Unexpectedly, there was a little situation in the middle, and you were transported here ahead of time. I forgot to brief Dragon God about this."

Dongsheng and Wanyan quickly bowed, showing a respectful demeanor.

Jian Wushuang didn't buy into this. He felt it was premeditated. Lord Yun Zhong arrived neither too early nor too late. He appeared only after they revealed their identities.

However, upon realizing that the other party was Lord Yun Zhong, Jian Wushuang was surprised. This was also one of the 18 Divine Generals.

It seemed that more than one Divine General had been revived. Fuego's appearance had cost Zhen Ling a fortune, resurrecting so many powerful beings.
