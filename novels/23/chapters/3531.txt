Chapter 3532: Poluo God

Because he knew how Heavy Master was like, even though he knew that Heavy Master did not like him, when he found out that Heavy Master was being hunted by God Fei Master, he still rushed over to save him.

If it were anyone else, even if Jian Wushuang came to save them, he would not be so enthusiastic.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’ll remember what happened today. I’ll definitely return the favor in the future,” Heavy Master said.

“Heavy Master, you’re too kind.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

They were still exchanging pleasantries, but at this moment… DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang and Heavy Master’s expressions changed.

“What’s wrong, you two?” Purple Sound Master looked over.

“It’s a message from my Star Palace saying that a universe supreme treasure is being born in the nearby territory. They want us to go there immediately,” Heavy Master said seriously.

“A supreme treasure is being born?” Purple Sound Master raised his eyebrows. “If it’s just an ordinary elementary universe supreme treasure, it will take a very short time for it to be born. Even if we get the news now, it’s probably too late for us to go there. The person who sent the message must know this. But since he sent the message, could it be that it’s an advanced universe Supreme Treasure?”

The three Universe Battlefields were filled with a large number of opportunities and treasures. For example, the birth of a true treasure was a common occurrence.

As long as it was a universe true treasure, it would take a certain amount of time for it to be completely born. The higher the level of the true treasure, the longer it would take for it to be born.

“It’s not an advanced universe true treasure, but its value is higher than an ordinary advanced universe true treasure,” said Heavy Master.

“It’s not an advanced universe true treasure, but its value is higher than that of an advanced universe true treasure? Could it be...” Purple Sound Master immediately thought of a possibility.

“It’s Poluo God! It’s a part of Poluo God!” Heavy Master said excitedly.

“Is it really Poluo God?” Purple Sound Master became excited.

“Guys, what is this Poluo God? Why are you so excited?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

Although he had received the message, it only said that it was a component of Poluo God. He had just entered the Universe Battlefield, so he did not know what Poluo God was.

Heavy Master immediately explained, “Poluo God is a very famous treasure in Devil Smoke Valley. No one knows what level it is exactly, but conservative estimates say that it is at least at the peak level, and its power is extremely strong.”

“Unfortunately, this true treasure hasn’t been complete since it was discovered. Instead, it has been disassembled and formed into parts. It is said that there are a total of 36 Poluo God parts, and these Poluo God parts alone have power equivalent to a low-level universe true treasure. However, if three Poluo God parts are combined together, their power is far higher than a high-level universe true treasure, and it is even close to the level of a top-tier true treasure!

“If there are more than nine Poluo God parts, the combination of them would be extremely terrifying, even among top-tier universe supreme treasures.”

“However, although there are 36 Poluo God parts, there seem to be less than 20 Poluo God parts in Devil Smoke Valley. Some parts have already been spread around. Some people have collected three Poluo God parts, but some don’t. This makes the Poluo God parts even more valuable than ordinary advanced universe supreme treasures, even though they are only elementary universe supreme treasures.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to see the Poluo God component appear near us. Let’s go. We’ll rush there immediately. If we’re too late and let the Poluo God component fall into someone else’s hands, we’ll regret it,” the Heavy Master said.

Immediately, the three of them rushed toward the place where the Poluo God component had appeared.

The Black Thunder Pool was also a dangerous place in Devil Smoke Valley.

This place was filled with dark black divine lightning. These dark black divine lightning were extremely violent and powerful. Ordinary Principles Masters would dare to enter this black thunder pool, but this black thunder pool was only on the ground…there were some in the lower sky, but the void above was not touched. Thus, Principles Masters who passed by could choose to fly directly from the void above the Black Thunder Pool, not having to worry about encountering any dangers.

However, today, a holy rod part was born in the Black Thunder Pool.

When Jian Wushuang, Heavy Master, and Purple Sound Master arrived at the Black Thunder Pool, they immediately saw a black holy rod in the void in the middle of the pool.

The black holy rod was not big, and it was smaller than ordinary stick-type supreme treasures. However, the power it emitted was quite impressive.

“Is that the Poluo God part?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the black staff and narrowed his eyes slightly. Then, he noticed the human figure in the void near the black staff, and his expression became solemn.

The three people appeared beside one of the human figures.

“Saber Python Master,” Heavy Master greeted the man.

“Heavy Master, Purple Sound Master.” Saber Python Master nodded slightly, but then he looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Who is this?”

“He just arrived in our Star Palace. His name is...” Heavy Master did not finish his sentence.

“Blood Sword, just call me Blood Sword,” Jian Wushuang said first.

“Blood Sword Master, it is very nice to meet you.” Saber Python Master was very humble.

Jian Wushuang also nodded slightly.

Saber Python Master was a Principles Master in Star Palace, and his strength had reached the peak of the void four realms.

This time, Saber Python Master was the first to discover the appearance of the Poluo God component. He was also the one who had sent the message to them.

“Saber Python, how long until the Poluo God component is born?” Asked Heavy Master.

“Although the Poluo God component is only a low-level universe true treasure, it was decomposed by Poluo God. The time it takes for it to be born is not any shorter than a normal high-level universe true treasure. It has been a while since I discovered the Poluo God component. It should be soon before the Poluo God component is born,” said Saber Python Master.

“However, it was born in the Black Thunder Pool. As long as it doesn’t go underground, it’s not dangerous. Therefore, people often pass by here. Although I was the first to see it, others still found it while I was waiting for it to be born. So far, many people have gathered here.”

Jian Wushuang and the other two also looked carefully at the people around them.

At this moment, there were eight experts waiting for the appearance of the Poluo God component, not counting them!
