At first, Jian Wushuang?felt it was odd?that he was able to completely absorb 37 Purple Heaven Thunderbolts, but he quickly realized why.

Purple Heaven Thunderbolts were used?for?building up?and strengthening the body.

However, Jian Wushuang cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill?and was already a Venerable Master. Right now, the biggest difference between Jian Wushuang and normal warriors was his body.

This wasn’t in reference to his physical strength. Instead, it was?his body’s foundation!

After?he broke through to the level of Venerable Master, his body continued to?strengthen, gaining unlimited possibilities.

How much?a body?could be strengthened and how many?Purple Heaven Thunderbolts it could absorb, depended on the body’s foundation?and the warrior’s endurance. Obviously, Jian Wushuang was able to bear much more than those lords.

Even the Black Yuan Lord could only endure 15 Purple Heaven Thunderbolts, but Jian Wushuang was able to absorb 37 of them.

“Now, my body is...”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help inspecting his body. He could only vaguely sense its strength at the moment.

“Previously, my body was only on par with?a medium third-grade magic weapon. However, after absorbing so many Purple Heaven Thunderbolts, it seems to have reached a new level. But now, it should be good enough to match up against superior second-grade magic weapons, shouldn’t it ?”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

Superior second-grade magic weapons?only ranked second to first-grade magic weapons!

This is the?current strength of?Jian Wushuang’s body!

Such a?strong body was already?incredible among many lords, not to mention those in the Saint Realm.

With this body,?which?was comparable to superior second-grade magic weapons, if Jian Wushuang?stood there and let a Stage Two warrior, or even an ordinary Stage Three expert, attack him, they wouldn’t be able to hurt him at all.

If they?wanted?to harm him, the opponents need to be in the upper level of Stage Three or even possess a Heaven-defying level of strength. But, even?then,?they would only be able to hurt him.

As far as?killing him though, ordinary lords wouldn’t be able to do that.

“Since my?body was?strengthened so much, what about my power...” Jian Wushuang was filled with expectations as he clenched his right fist and?launched a punch toward the area directly in front of him.

Bang!

A powerful wind-breaking sound filled the area. This punch, which flew through the air, created a thunderous sound that caused the whole area to tremble.

“This power,”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Eight times!”

“The power of that attack was eight times stronger than before!”

Jian Wushuang was very happy and surprised.

With the increase of his physical strength, his power had skyrocketed.

The strength of his body has risen from a?medium?third-grade magic weapon to a superior second-grade magic weapon. It?was strengthened?so much?in such a short time, it was no wonder his power had also been?enhanced to eight times that of his previous ability.

His overall?ability surged to a new level once again.

Now, if he met Deng Huo again, he?would be?able to kill him without using the Blood Puppet.

“Unfortunately, I am only in the Saint Realm. If I could break through?and?become a lord,?I would definitely be able to absorb a lot more of the Purple Heaven Thunderbolts inside the Universal Thunderbolt Pool,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

“Anyway, I should be satisfied with this.”

Jian Wushuang was delighted. He?turned?around and left the Universal Thunderbolt Pool without any hesitation.

Outside the hall, An Feng had been waiting there?for a few days now. When he?noticed Jian Wushuang exiting the hall, he rushed to welcome him?as quickly as possible.

However, upon seeing Jian Wushaung again, An Feng was surprised.?He?noticed that Jian Wushuang was?obviously?different from several days ago. Even though his aura was still the same as before, he could tell that Jian Wushuang was much stronger.

Previously, he felt slightly stressed when facing Jian Wushuang, but?that was because of?Jian Wushuang’s amazing battle results. Now, when Jian Wushuang was standing in front of him, he could feel a?harsh oppression. It seemed that he could easily be killed by Jian Wushuang.

“Congratulations, Lord Swordsman.” An Feng immediately?realized that Jian Wushuang had improved immensely inside the Universal Thunderbolt Pool.

Jian Wushuang smiled at him and said, “An Feng, take me to the place?with the third opportunity!”

Jian Wushuang was filled with anticipation towards the third?opportunity, which was also the last one in the Bei Mo Cave Mansion.

After all, the first couple?opportunities had already satisfied him a lot.

He received a first-grade magic weapon, the Dragon King Bow, from the first opportunity, granting him another terrifying trump card.

He completely?absorbed 37 Purple Heaven Thunderbolts in the second opportunity, tremendously strengthening his body, which improved his overall ability enormously.

Both of these opportunities had already benefitted him greatly, so?what about the third one?

An Feng and Jian Wushuang quickly arrived at an open space in the deepest part of the cave mansion. There, in the middle of the open space, stood a thatched cottage.

“A thatched cottage?”?Jian?Wushuang was secretly surprised.

Bei Mo Marquis left a thatched cottage in his cave mansion. That was really unexpected.

“My lord, this thatched cottage is the third, the most precious, and most important opportunity.?It has a name to go with it. We call?it the Cottage World,” An Feng said.

“Cottage World?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. “World Origin?”

“Yes,” An Fend nodded and said, “Bei Mo Marquis had reached great heights incomprehension of World Origin.?Among these three opportunities, only the Cottage World is?related to the World Origin. I think the reason?that you came to the cave mansion of Bei Mo Marquis?is?to comprehend World Origin as well, right?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“This is it. I?don’t think?that the opportunity inside the Cottage World will disappoint you at all, but before you enter, I must inform you that you need to?proceed with?caution. Everyone only receives one chance?to enter the?Cottage World. It’s very rare, so you have to take advantage of this opportunity,” An Feng said.

“My lord,?upon entering the thatched cottage, you will see a futon. Once you sit on?it,?you will understand what’s special about the Cottage World. However, you will also?quickly fall into a gentle slumber afterward.”

‘Slumber?” Jian Wushuang looked at him with a curious expression.

“Don’t worry.?This slumber is?definitely something good.?You can take it as?a form of enlightenment, and the longer you spend slumbering, the more beneficial it will be for you. However, the instant you wake up, the opportunity will end,” An Feng said.

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang didn’t know how to react.

“You have to go into Cottage World and experience it yourself to truly understand,” An Feng said with a big smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded?gently, then he slowly walked?toward the thatched cottage. Once he reached the front door, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, opened the door, and entered the thatched cottage.
