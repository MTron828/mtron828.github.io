Chapter 251: The Starlight Sword Array

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Too fast!

Jian Wushuang moved so fast that it took some time for people to notice that he appeared beside Mo Lingtian.

Mo Lingtian however, did notice, but before he reacted, Jian Wushuang’s palm already landed on his face.

“Puff!”

With a single move from Jian Wushuang, Mo Lingtian spat a mouthful of blood. He shot back like a shell and violently crashed into the Drill Ground, which made the area shake so much that cracks appeared.

“Senior Brother Lingtian.”

Seeing this, the man and the lady that Mo Lingtian brought were shocked to the core.

Mo Lingtian struggled to stand up slowly with a disreputable state. His chest was swollen like a bun; blood could be dimly seen in the corner of his mouth, and his whole body was shaking uncontrollably. By then, his eyes were started turning icy.

“It’s just seven months since we met last time, how could he have increased his strength like this?” Mo Lingtian was astounded by Jian Wushuang. Then he looked at the man and the lady next to him and said seriously, “This fellow is a little bit odd, let’s display the Starlight Sword Array together and then kill him.”

“Starlight Sword Array?” The man and the lady were shocked.

The Wilderness Sword Sect was well-known for the Sword Principle. The Sect not only owned a large number of transcendent swordsmanship and Sword Skills, but also owned some sword formations.

The sword formations were extraordinary and gained a good fame in the entire Nanyang Continent.

Normally these sword formations were used to against the powerful enemies. However, Jian Wushuang was just at the Initial Completion of Yang Void Realm!

Was it necessary for three experts of the Peak of Yang Void Realm to activate the sword formation by joining hands?

“Don’t underestimate him. Hurry up,” Mo Lingtian said without stopping.

The man and the lady nodded heavily, and moved into action without hesitation.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The three figures instantly stood together side by side, followed by the burst of three sword essences. In no time the sword essences directly beamed into the sky.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang held his head up, and looked at the three with astonishment.

“Show him what we are capable of.” As soon as Mo Lingtian threw a deep roar, the three figures violently glided up at once, and in no time appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

A second later, the three slashed their sword simultaneously.

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

Three streaks of sword light lashed out. Each one was extremely dazzling and held incredible power.

The moment the sword light rushed forward, the three streaks of sword light merged into one as if they were launched by a single person.

The integrated sword light got more and more dazzling, as it was flying towards Jian Wushuang in a much fiercer state.

Jian Wushuang was holding an ordinary cyan-colored Long Sword in his hand.

Seeing the sword light getting closer, he moved his wrist and fiercely slashed his Long Sword out.

The fourth move of Selfless Sword Technique!

He activated the Origin of the World.

Thud!

The two sword lights collided together, leaving an almighty bang behind.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was a little bit shocked. He could tell there was a force bypassing his attack and coming in close contact with him. However, he couldn’t help taking a few steps backwards.

After retreating for dozens of meters, Jian Wushuang regained his balance, held up his head and set his eyes upon Mo Lingtian and his companions at the front.

“Sword formation?” There was a surprised look in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Kill him!” Mo Lingtian’s eyes were icy. With a snarl, the three displayed their movements simultaneously again.

“Interesting.” Jian Wushuang sneered. He immediately moved up to them.

Boom!

The horrible sword essence broke out again. Due to the strength of the sword formation, Mo Lingtian and his two comrades seemed to have integrated into one person. They grabbed the sword simultaneously, and by then, both the swordsmanship power and the sword speed got greatly increased.

The three were all at the Peak of Yang Void Realm which already afforded them an upper hand. Now joint fight made their battle strength reach an even higher level.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang activated World Origin and Slaughter Origin simultaneously and engaged himself in the fierce fight. In a short time, it was hard to tell who had the upper hand over the other.

“Is the sword formation that powerful?”?Jian Wushuang pondered in surprise.

If Mo Lingtian and his two comrades fought with Jian Wushuang individually, all of them would be easily killed by Jian Wushuang. Even if the three allied but did not display the sword formation, Jian Wushuang could handle them calmly and kill them one by one.

But now they were displaying the sword formation and seemed like a single person. This greatly enhanced their overall strength. Even though Jian Wushuang already activated the World Origin and Slaughter Origin, he still did not have an upper hand.

Jian Wushuang was surprised, while Mo Lingtian and his comrades were shocked.

“We, we already displayed the Starlight Sword Array by allying together. How is it possible we still can’t kill him?”

“He is just at the Initial Yang Void Realm. Why is his strength comparable to us three?”

“Origin, he comprehended the Origin, and he comprehended more than one. What’s more, his strength is stronger than the ordinary Initial Yang Void Realm. I am afraid his strength is as good as the Exceptional Yang Void Realm right now.”

“How is that possible that there is such a powerful expert of the Initial Yang Void Realm in this world?”

Mo Lingtian and his comrades all felt it was inconceivable.

After all, they had already used the Starlight Sword Array. They could even defeat Dan Yi, an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm who comprehended the Origin. However, they couldn’t defeat Jian Wushuang, who was merely at the Initial Yang Void Realm.

“Your sword formation is indeed excellent,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

Mo Lingtian and his comrades looked toward Jian Wushuang at once.

“But it’s over.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were icy. He moved his wrist and got his cyan Long Sword inserted into the Interspatial Ring. A second later, he slowly pulled out the Triple-kill Sword that he carried in the back.

No sooner had he drew the Triple-kill Sword out from its sheath, a scary killing intent spread out.

Mo Lingtian and his comrades darkened their faces.

“Hmph, he changed a sword, so what?” Mo Lingtian sneered. “Don’t waste time on him, just use the unique skill. Let’s do it!”

With a monstrous breath, the three figures fiercely glided out again.

“Go to hell!”

Mo Lingtian shouted. At that moment, the three all displayed their own unique skill.

Instantly, three towering sword shadows could be seen bursting out almost at the same time. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The unique skills they displayed were different, but the power activated by these skills were all earthshaking. The moment the power was activated, the experts standing outside the Heartless Island immediately looked toward them. Even the experts who were fiercely fighting in the Heartless Island right now also threw their eyes over one after another.

A second later, the three sword lights, each having immeasurable power, were instantly combined into one.

All of a sudden, the sword light became twinkling and dazzling, as if it was a ray of starlight in the dark Void!

Rumble!!!

The cold sword light pierced through the air, and was tearing everything in heaven and earth. Soon after, it appeared in front of Jian Wushuang,

Jian Wushuang looked cold. Feeling the chill heavy wind, he instantly slashed his Triple-kill Sword out.

Buzzing! The towering sword essence was just activated!

Then Jian Wushuang slowly waved the Triple-kill Sword down. He was displaying the fifth move of the Selfless Sword Technique!

The fifth move was called Blood Rupturing Movement.

Unlike the previous four moves, the Blood Rupturing Movement mostly relied on strength.

The majestic sword shadow was immediately activated.

This was a very slow slash, as if it didn’t contain any strength. However, when it collided with the dazzling sword light that Mo Lingtian and his comrades displayed...

Boom!

The horrible roar was heard, and it shook the area so much.

A second later, the majestic sword shadow just overwhelmingly smashed the sword light to pieces. Then the sword shadow continued to move toward Mo Lingtian and his comrades.
