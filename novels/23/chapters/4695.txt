4696 The Undercurrent Surges

After Emperor Fenghua died and the Heavenly Court fell, the Young Emperor in a purple robe who looked like a sick man seemed to have entered a no man’s land, and his terrifying means almost single-handedly controlled the whole event.

In the Heavenly Realm, all the Yan Immortals were exterminated, leaving only Chun Qiu, the son of Emperor Fenghua.

After that, he was brought to the black mountain and underwent an extremely long life as a prisoner.

The more he feared the Young Emperor, the more he hated him.

As he walked into the depths of the hall, Jian Wushuang’s gaze never wavered.

“A man of unknown origin with his cultivation sealed by chains could kill three Emperors by himself. What kind of amazing person is he to be able to accomplish such an impossible task?”

In the silent hall, only the Young Emperor’s eerie voice resounded.

“You are the Emperor of an area?” he turned around and looked at Jian Wushuang with raised eyebrows.

Jian Wushuang did not answer him. Instead, he threw a mirror to him and said, “I’ve fulfilled your conditions. It’s time for you to fulfill your promise.”

“Oh? Is that so?” The Young Emperor took the Reverse Heavenly Mystery Mirror and glanced at it casually. Then, he threw it back to Jian Wushuang. “But why don’t I remember making a promise?”

As soon as he said that, both Jian Wushuang and Chun Qiu’s hearts sank.

He did not expect that this Young Emperor, who seemed extremely shameless, would be so brazen.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were as calm as water. A long, narrow, and Invisible Sword appeared in his palm.

The Young Emperor’s eyes narrowed and he subconsciously took half a step back.

The image that Jian Wushuang had left behind was so shocking and terrifying that it affected his judgment.

As if it could feel its master’s heart that was about to explode, the long sword let out a cold sword cry.

Step by step, Chun Qiu followed closely behind. The resentment and anger after being fooled buried his last bit of humiliation, making him even more determined to take revenge.

The chain and metal plate on his neck began to surge with an endless power of imprisonment. His meridians began to be imprisoned. Every time he used a portion of Yan power, his meridians would curl up in pain.

However, Jian Wushuang did not seem to be troubled at all and continued to move forward firmly.

“I said, untie me!”

Jian Wushuang’s suppressed rage resounded. Half of his face was covered in dark blue confinement power, and he looked particularly terrifying and ferocious at the moment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Young Emperor, who had been frightened a moment ago, revealed a strange smile the next moment.

As soon as he said that, the skinny purple-robed man swept over and slapped Jian Wushuang with his palm.

The endless Yan power was like a vast ocean.

However, Jian Wushuang only lifted his sword and slashed once. The mighty Yan power was split into two halves from the middle and swept to the sides.

The Young Emperor’s eyes narrowed, and he said slowly, “I seem to have suddenly remembered.”

“I’ll definitely keep my promise to you, but before that, I’d like to ask you a few questions.”

He smiled slowly, not caring about the current situation at all. He said to himself, “Are you an itinerant Immortal, the master of a Heavenly Court, or the son of the Emperor?”

Suppressing the annoyance in his heart, Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice, “I’m a wild crane.”

“It’s hard to imagine that a wild crane can reach your level. I’m afraid that there are very few Heaven’s Favorites like you in all the Realms,” the Young Emperor said faintly. “Follow me. I promise that I’ll give you whatever you want the moment it becomes a possibility.”

“I’m not interested,” Jian Wushuang said concisely.

However, the young Empyrean Lord did not seem to hear him. He extended a finger and said, “In a hundred years, if you wish me to ascend to the throne, I will give you an entire small world. On top of that, I can agree to several conditions.”

“I said, I’m not interested!” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“You’ll agree to my offer. I’m not an evil person. It’s just a win-win situation.” The Young Emperor half-leaned on the bed again as if he had him in the palm of his hand. “Although you call yourself an itinerant Immortal, I can feel that you’re in such a hurry to leave, not because you’re afraid, but because you’re looking for something.”

“But in this Great Yan Domain, all the Emperors and Yan Immortals are just a speck of dust.”

“Without a Heavenly Court, without any foundation, I can guarantee that you will soon be destroyed, let alone searching aimlessly.”

The Young Emperor stood up and whispered to Jian Wushuang, “As long as you help me ascend to the throne, I will definitely make you an Emperor in the Great Yan Domain.”

Jian Wushuang stopped talking and just looked at him coldly.

The Young Emperor smiled playfully, then reached out his palm from his luxurious clothes and pressed it on his neck.

The iron plate with the power of the great restriction shattered.

Yan power, which was surging to the extreme, instantly filled his limbs and bones. The Yan Immortal realm that had been confined all this time was completely released, and his aura rose to another realm.

Jian Wushuang looked at him deeply, then turned around and prepared to leave.

However, as he stepped out, purple-robed figures slowly walked out from the darkness on both sides of the hall.

Every single one of them was surrounded by a vast amount of Yan power, there were no less than 20 of them!

Jian Wushuang stood still and the Young Emperor walked over. He placed his palm on his shoulder and said, “I’ve told you my ambition and secrets. You know what it means.”

With more than 20 Yan Immortals, even if Jian Wushuang completely released his realm and fought to the last moment, it was impossible for him to break out of the encirclement and he would definitely die.

The threat was obvious.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang turned around and said in a deep voice, “Are you threatening me?”

“It’s not a threat, it’s just a clear attitude.” The Young Emperor shrugged. “It’s a win-win situation, and I really can’t bear to let you leave.”

“It’s only 100 years. I won’t bother you anymore, whether it’s successful or not. As a reward, I’ll give you everything you want, including the entire Six Heavens Realms.”

The hall was deathly silent, leaving only the flickering of the candles.

After a long time, Jian Wushuang said, “Okay.”

A smile finally appeared on the Young Emperor’s pale face. “Very good. Welcome to the new era.”

Jian Wushuang’s face was extremely calm. “100 years is the limit.”

“Understood.” The Young Emperor smiled and nodded.

As he walked out of the hall, a feeling of being in a different world emerged in Chun Qiu’s heart.

The shackles that had been binding him for countless years had been removed, which meant that he was free from now on.

He did not expect the Young Emperor to let him go so easily and not even stop him.

He had probably become the first former Emperor to survive the Young Emperor’s attack.
