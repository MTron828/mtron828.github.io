Chapter 1987 Exit Seclusion

Terrifying!!! Scary!!!

It was absolutely accurate to describe him as unrivaled.

Jian Wushuang finally understood how Emperor Bai could be high and mighty. He understood why the Great Emperors from the second era didn’t even have the courage to taunt him.

He also understood why Emperor Bai wasn’t afraid even though he had dealt with Emperor Thirteen and knew that his opponent might be stronger than himself.

Because Emperor Bai had been unrivaled long ago.

Emperor Bai was also an inverse cultivator and had already stepped foot on the seventh step of inverse cultivation. Plus, he should be on the ultimate stage of the seventh step.

His divine power was boundless and enough for him to collapse ten times and to remain alive.

On top of that, he had extremely strong power. Even though his opponent might be much stronger than him, it was absolutely impossible for his opponent to kill him.

Because he was invincible, he was unrivaled.

“I just stepped foot on the seventh step of inverse cultivation and my divine power could only support me reorganizing my divine body four times. I still can’t be considered undefeatable, but at least I will be fearless towards the second era!” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

He didn’t mention the ancient times or the first era.

Merely in the second era itself, he was absolutely unstoppable.

Dealing with the Great Emperors in the second era, like Red Dragon King, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zi Xu and so on, even if Jian Wushuang couldn’t win against them, he didn’t have to be fearful of them, because even if the Great Emperors were to join forces to kill him, it would still be difficult.

Besides, after reaching the seventh step of inverse cultivation, there was a secret skill that Jian Wushuang could perform.

The secret skill was naturally the strongest secret skill of body refinery by the ancient tribe, Immemorial Celestial Body.

He had obtained the secret skill long ago but he hadn’t had the qualifications to cultivate it. But now…

“The strongest secret skill of body refinery. Even compared to the secret skills of body refinery from ancient times, Immemorial Celestial Body could be listed in the top ten. Such a secret skill… Even if it is just the first volume, it would enable my divine body and divine power to reach a brand new level once I cultivate it. By then, my power will improve tremendously too.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

However, although he had the qualifications to cultivate the secret skill then, he would need some time to cultivate the first volume successfully.

“I shall take my time. After all, I fully comprehended the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body long ago. Even though there are a few procedures that are more difficult, I could definitely cultivate the first volume of the secret skill successfully within a few thousand years,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang understood his constitution of the perfect Chaotic divine body and also his current power. He didn’t further verify them but exited seclusion.

In the lofty hall, Jian Wushuang sat on a throne. Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, Su Rou and the others gathered by his side.

“Shuang, judging from your aura, you’ve broken through again?” Jian Nantian looked at Jian Wushuang as his eyes shimmered with joy.

“Mm, I just broke through,” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

“That’s great!!”

They were thrilled with excitement.

“Green Fire World finally has an Almighty,” Wang Yuan cheered.

Although Jian Wushuang was attending garrison personally duty in Green Fire World and he had Jian Yi under him, regardless of if it was Jian Yi or Lord Sound Spirit who had assisted Jian Wushuang, they weren’t people from Green Fire World after all. It was only Jian Wushuang who was from Green Fire World.

Although Jian Wushuang had great fighting power then, he had yet to reach Almighty realm.

Green Fire World had yet to give birth to an Almighty. Now, they finally had.

“Father, you should be nearing a breakthrough soon, right? I could feel your soul power growing so quickly. I think you should be able to substantiate a substantive soul soon,” Jian Wushuang commented.

“Mm, should be soon. Within ten thousand years, I’m guessing,” Jian Nantian replied.

Everyone was surprised at having more great news.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows too.

“Alright, everyone, tell me what happened during the time when I was cultivating in seclusion,” Jian Wushuang asked.

Then, everyone immediately reported what had happened in the past three thousand years briefly.

In the past three thousand years, Green Fire World had faintly settled down. Various forces and experts from Eternal Chaotic World had sent ten hundred million geniuses to the thirty percent territory. After reproduction for three thousand years, the number had increased by a dozen times. Just as Jian Wushuang had expected, the people who were born in Green Fire World were much more gifted than those who had been born in other parts of Eternal Chaotic World.

Plus, they were getting more and more outstanding through the generations. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The thirty percent territory was given a name of Myriad Noble Region while the remaining seventy percent territory was known as Green Fire Region.

The two territories were bound by the agreement and they hardly had dealings with one another. They naturally had conflicts. On top of that, cultivators from both parties were growing at a shocking speed.

Especially the geniuses. There were too many geniuses across Green Fire World now.

It included many who possessed special constitutions.

However, because there were too many geniuses, most of them would opt to train themselves in Eternal Chaotic World after they reached Universe God level.

On the ancient battlefield, the passion of the experts from Eternal Chaotic World to wander didn’t diminish even though three thousand years had passed. There was a continuous appearance of multiple opportunities. There were many amazing ones too. It even stirred up many battles and countless experts fought over it.

However, the occurrence of battles in order to get opportunities and treasures was only right and proper. All in all, it wasn’t too drastic of an incident.

Everything was calm.

Jian Wushuang understood what had happened in the past three thousand years briefly and he didn’t ask further. He had already passed down the affairs of Green Fire World to his father, Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, Su Rou, and the others.

Then, Jian Wushuang went to see three other people.

They were Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, and Hall Master Nie Yun.

The three hall masters of Lineage of Star were there, in Green Fire World.

According to the agreement, besides the ten Almighties who were in charge of looking after Myriad Noble Region, the other experts from Eternal Chaotic World above Almighty level were prohibited from entering Green Fire World.

However, the three hall masters were special.

That was because the three of them were Jian Wushuang’s men.

Hence, Jian Wushuang had already sent a message for Wang Yuan to bring the three hall masters into Green Fire World when he knew they had arrived.

“Palace Master, you have finally exited your seclusion,” Hall Master Gu Xin was obviously excited to see Jian Wushuang.

“Palace Master, your aura, did you break through again?” Hall Master Yuan’s eyes glowed.

“I did. However, you don’t have to announce this. Only the three of you need to know this,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“That’s great!” The three hall masters were thrilled with joy.

They knew that Jian Wushuang could suppress Emperor God when he was at Real God level. Then, as he broke through and leaped on the seventh step of inverse cultivation, his power had definitely improved tremendously.

They believed that he could compare to a Great Emperor favorably with his power!

Great Emperor! Lineage of Star finally had a Great Emperor.

How could they not be excited?
