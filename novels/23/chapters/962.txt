Chapter 963: Send a Message to Say Hi

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Jian Wushuang knew that swallowing the Essence Blood and gaining the battle strength of an Imperial God were not the only reasons he destroyed the life-threatening Formation and killed Dao Yuanzi. He had assistance from the Mountain River Map as well.

At that time, Dao Yuanzi had looked furious, and it was also because of the Mountain River Map.

According to Dao Yuanzi, the Mountain River Map was a Chaos Divine Treasure!

“What is a Chaos Divine Treasure?” Jian Wushuang had no idea what that was.

“It’s a rare kind of treasure that exists in the Eternal Chaotic World. Although a Chaos Divine Treasure is not very much of a use for experts such as Star Bloodline’s founder and King Luo Zhen, it can be enormously helpful for experts who are weaker.”

“Someone like King Gu Tong, who is in his peak days, would covet a Chaos Divine Treasure,” King Gu said seriously.

“Is it that precious?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

“It is.” King Gu continued, “Furthermore, the map has been refined with a special technique which hides its scent. That’s why I failed to recognize it as a Chaos Divine Treasure, until you used it in that battle.”

“Jian Wushuang, did your master give this map to you?”

“Yes, he did.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“I am getting increasingly curious about your master. He granted you a secret skill to raise the intensity of your awareness, 13,800 Emperor Weapon as your wedding gifts, and even a Chaos Divine Treasure…” Gu sighed in awe.

Putting aside the secret technique to strengthen one’s awareness.

As for the 13,800 Emperor Weapon, it meant little to King Gu as well. After all, in the Eternal Chaotic World, an Emperor Weapon was too ordinary.

But a Chaos Divine Treasure was a different story.

“Only a few experts possess Chaos Divine Treasures in the Eternal Chaotic World, and the ones that are able to cultivate them are even fewer,” King Gu added.

“Your master gave you a Chaos Divine Treasure, this shows that he must have an outstanding background. Maybe he is not as powerful as Star Bloodline’s founder and King Luo Zhen, but he must be famous in the Eternal Chaotic World.”

Jian Wushuang agreed.

His master, Palace Master Xuan Yi, had always been mysterious.

His origin, background, strength, and everything else about him remained a secret to everyone.

Before Jian Wushuang, he had accepted three disciples. They did not practice hard, yet all of them became Dao Masters. Xue Lingtian had even almost reached the peak of Rank Three.

Later, Palace Master Xuan Yi accepted him. In the beginning, Xuan Yi was an attentive master to Jian Wushuang. Later, Jian Wushuang was allowed to wander in the outside world without Xuan Yi’s interferences. Only when Jian Wushuang was in trouble would Xuan Yi came to his disciple’s rescue.

On the Selection Ceremony, he had prepared 13,800 Emperor Weapons, which was unbelievable to the Green Fire World.

When Xuan Yi had first learned about the Ceremony, he started to prepare the gifts. When the gifts finally arrived, three years had passed.

He prepared 13,800 Emperor Weapons in three years!

And King Gu Tong turned out to be Ancient Sect’s Sect Master!

Back in the Firmament Territory, Ancient Sect’s Sect Master had always been recognized as the greatest expert. However, during Jian Wushuang’s stay in the Firmament Territory, he had never met the Sect Master, let alone witnessed the Master’s swordsmanship. He never imagined that the Ancient Sect’s Sect Master turned out to be a Seven Star Imperial God!

The Ancient God Clan from the Eternal Zone of Firmament Territory was most likely to be linked as well.

In addition, King Gu Tong seemed to have helped Jian Wushuang on Xuan Yi’s order.

Xuan Yi could dispatch even a Seven Star Imperial God? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

And he actually had a Chaos Divine Treasure like the Mountain River Map.

Everything showed that Xuan Yi possessed great capabilities.

“I haven’t talked to my master in a long time. I should send a message to pay my respects.” Jian Wushuang decided and immediately took out a message token from his Interspatial Ring.

Although he was injured, he could still send messages through message tokens.

“Master, I am still alive.” Jian Wushuang sent a very brief message.

Moments after he sent his message, he received a response from Xuan Yi.

“I know.”

Xuan Yi’s voice was indifferent and did not sound surprised at all. “When I accepted you as my disciple, I planted a Sword Spark in you. The Sword Spark is connected to you. The Sword Spark, although weak, did not disappear. And I know that you are still alive.”

“I am very weak now, and it will take a long time for me to recover.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Don’t worry, take your time.” Xuan Yi said while smiling.

“Thank you for your help in the battle of the Tang of the East.” Jian Wushuang said, grateful to his master.

“It was Gu Tong who helped you in the battle of the Imperial Palace. It had nothing to do with me. You should go thank him instead.” Xuan Yi laughed.

Although Xuan Yi put it this way, Jian Wushuang was highly aware that Gu Tong only helped because Xuan Yi had ordered him to.

“Master, when I was using the Mountain River Map to kill Dao Yuanzi in the battle, he said that the map is a Chaos Divine Treasure.” Jian Wushuang appeared doubtful.

“Oh? Dao Yuanzi had a discerning eye. He indeed came from the Blood Killing Sect.” Xuan Yi gave a faint smile. “It is indeed a Chaos Divine Treasure. Unfortunately, it is a damaged one. Its power has been diminished.”

“Damaged?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

“Nevertheless, it can be of great help to you. You should take it,” Xuan Yi said.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded, and then continued, “Master, the Universal Dao Scripture that you gave me was a secret technique to improve my awareness, is that right?”

“Oh? You found out?” Xuan Yi admitted with a smile.

“So I was right.” Jian Wushuang fell silent.

He had only speculated that the Univeral Dao Scripture might have something to do with his heightened awareness. He had just confirmed this speculation.

“Awareness is important for a warrior. You are still physically weak, and you don’t feel the importance of awareness yet. In the future when you get stronger, you will experience the benefits of strong awareness.” Xuan Yi smiled.

Jian Wushuang nodded, but immediately asked in a grave manner. “I have one more question. Master, are you really just an Eternal Realm level expert?”
