Chapter 72: Scheduling a battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Damn it.” Wang Yuan gnashed.

“Bro senior, can I help you?” Yang Zaixuan said with an increasingly cold look on Nangong Jie.

They all knew that Nangong Jie Gong did it deliberately.

“No” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He knew that Yang Zaixuan had enough strength to defeat Nangong Jie, but he thought this was his own matter and he did not want others to help him.

“I lost this battle. One thousand points, here you are.” Jian Wushuang gave Nangong Jie one thousand points directly without hesitation.

After getting the one thousand points, Nangong Jie didn’t change his facial expression but touched his nose and said suddenly: “Swordsman, do you want to fight with me one more time?”

“Uh?” Jian Wushuang was so surprised.

“Nangong Jie, don’t go that far!” Wang Yuan immediately shouted.

“Don’t get me wrong.” Nangong Jie shook his head and said, “I intend to continue the battle for points, but this time the condition will be changed. For example, you will win as long as you withstand my swords for three times. What do you think about it?”

“I can win after three swords?” Wang Yuan immediately looked at Jian Wushuang in confusion.

Disciples of the Dragon Palace around him all looked over and discussed this heatedly.

“What does Nangong Jie intend to do? Jiang Wushuang will be the winner after fighting with him for three moves?”

“In the past battle, Swordsman used nearly 20 moves before he won.”

“What’s wrong with Nangong Jie? Does he want to give his points to others for nothing?”

These disciples of Dragon Palace were confused over Nangong Jie’s behavior, because in the past battle, Jian Wushuang endured nearly 20 moves before he won.

Now he wanted to defeat Jian Wushuang with less than three moves. What a joke!

“If I agree with the battle, how many points will you bet?” Jian Wushuang looked at Nangong Jie calmly.

“One thousand points is too few. I believe you have many points now because you have won so many battles before, so I will bet my seven thousand points, including my current points and the one thousand points I won from you.” Nangong Jie said with smile.

“Seven thousand points?” People around he were all shocked.

“Nangong Jie is too confident!”

“How could he be so brave to bet seven thousand points in such an unfair confrontation?”

“Seven thousand points?” Jian Wushuang smiled sightly with his pupils shrinking, but then he rejected, “Sorry, I’m not interested in it.”

“What?” Nangong Jie changed his facial expression.

“He refused? It was incredible!” someone around exclaimed.

“It’s clear that the Swordsman can win points without any effort, but he refused it. Is he a fool?”

“Humph! You are a real fool. Nangong Jie must have enough ability to bet on seven thousand points with the Swordsman. In my opinion, the Swordsman is really stupid if he agreed with the battle.”

“Yes, Nangong Jie absolutely has enough confidence in his strength.”

Many of these disciples of Dragon Palace were shrewd enough to see through the intention of Nangong Jie.

Jian Wushuang, of course, was not a fool.

“Humph! Wanting to set a trap for me to get more points from my hands?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly.

In the past battle, though Nangong Jie did his utmost to conceal himself, Jian Wushuang saw the truth clearly.

“He did not do his best, and he even just used less than half of his strength.”

Jian Wushuang knew it clearly.

It looked like Nangong Jie beat him with nearly twenty moves in the last battle, but in fact, Nangong Jie did it deliberately.

Jian Wushuang had no doubt that if Nangong Jie goes for broke, he could not withstand one move, let alone three moves.

“His comprehension for sword essence is much better than me, and he definitely has the strength to break through the sixth level!”

The sixth level!

Yes, this was Jian Wushuang’s assessment for the strength of Nangong Jie.

Nangong Jie was at the level of Gold Core and his understanding of sword essence was at the sixth level of Dragon Gate. His strength could surely defeat him with no more than three moves.

“He rejected? He didn’t fall into my trap?” Nangong Jie was very angry at this moment, “How did he know that I deliberately concealed my strength? Or was he too cautious to use seven thousand points to bet with me?

“Nangong Jie.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was heard again.

Nangong Jie could not help looking up.

“If you really want to bet with me, it’s ok.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and continued, “but today I battled with others many times and my spiritual power has been consumed greatly. My wrist is hurt, so I have no power to battle again. Therefore, we can conduct this battle in three months’ time.”

“Three months?” Nangong Jie frowned.

“Of course, after three months, I will have a fair battle with you, and I will accept any points you want to bet. What do you think? “Jian Wushuang said.

Hearing these words, Nangong Jie’eyes were bright.

“Deal!” Nangong Jie agreed quickly.

“Deal!”Jian Wushuang nodded seriously.

Hearing their words, people around were confused.

“Is this swordsman stupid?”

“Having a fair battle with Nangong Jie in three months? Points are also up to Nangong Jie?”

“Does he think that he can beat Nangong Jie in three months?”

“He is definitely crazy!”

Almost everyone thought Jian Wushuang was crazy and silly.

After all, Nangong Jie had great strength. Many disciples knew from the last battle that he could break through the sixth, and he was also an expert of the Gold Core Realm.

While Jian Wushuang, just was at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm. Even if his strength was great enough to fight with Primordial Gold Core, how was his understanding of sword essence?

Jian Wushuang’s understanding of sword essence could just narrowly break through the fifth level.

What a big gap!

Could he make up such a large gap in three months?

What a joke!

“Haha.” Nangong Jie was very happy, and he laughed, “Your words have been heard by so many people present. I will come see you in three months.”

After these words, Nangong Jie turned around and left happily.

As he was leaving, Nangong Jie was still thinking about the scene in three months.

“This guy didn’t know that I just showed a small part of my strength and I didn’t show my perception of sword essence completely. I also didn’t show my trump card. Even in this case, I beat him easily. How can he beat me in three months?”

“Haha, come on. I’m looking forward to that day, but that day, I will bet much more than seven thousand points.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Nangong Jie was full of confidence for the battle in three months.

All those on the Martial Arts Practice Field looked at Jian Wushuang with pity in their eyes.

However, no one noticed that a subtle smile appeared in the corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth.
