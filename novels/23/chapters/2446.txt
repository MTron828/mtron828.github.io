Long Zishan explained as if he could read Yu Aoqing’s mind, “Jian Wushuang could so unscrupulously kill Junior Brother Pang Tao and many various sects’ genius disciples. I’m 80 percent certain that his power is above mine. Not only you and I are going to join forces but they will also have to launch an attack together.”

Long Zishan’s final sentence was directed to the few Great Compassion Sect’s First-Class Divine Demons.

There were a total of four Great Compassion Sect First-Class Divine Demons apart from Long Zishan and Yu Aoqing who had just arrived.

The four First-Class Divine Demons nodded in unison after hearing Long Zishan’s words.

Yu Aoqing’s eyes were locked on her target and solemnly nodded.

“Let’s go!”

Following Long Zishan’s low command grunt, the six First-Class Divine Demons concurrently aimed their attacks at Jian Wushuang.

Long Zishan took the lead as the strongest among the six.

The purple armor on Long Zishan was glowing in a faint purple light, while a dark purple spear was in his hand. A cyclone from vague purple divine powers formed under his feet as he made his move, making it seem as though he was stepping on a purple dragon.

He was moving extremely fast, appearing first in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Go to hell!”

Long Zishan’s eyes shone like they were filled with electricity and the dark purple spear in his hand instantly turned into a bolt of purple lightning and whizzed towards Jian Wushuang.

“Long Zishan is much more powerful than Pang Tao.”

Jian Wushuang murmured his admiration towards Long Zishan in his heart, after judging Long Zishan’s skill when he made that attack.

Jian Wushuang also reacted immediately. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Hum!

A sword intent rose sharply.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered sharply as he drew his sword and swept it around. His actions were smooth and coherent.

Swash! A poignant sword-light emerged.

A very gorgeous and extremely enchanting faint purplish sword-light cut through the void, just like a purple phantom gliding past.

Purple Blood Sword Technique—Purple Light Phantom!

They were both purple, but one resembled a flash of purple lightning while the other was a poignant purple sword-light. The two instantly collided.

Snap!

A crisp sound rang in the void followed by before a purple arc and sword-lights filled the space.

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently as the two collided before casually swiping across his Blood Mountain Sword and dividing its sword intent into three cold sword-light streaks that were directed at Long Zishan.

Long Zishan was neither afraid nor perturbed. The dark purple spear in his hand shot out and pierced one after another. Clang! Clang! Clang! All of Jian Wushuang’s three sword-lights were impeded.

At that instant, Jian Wushuang lunged forward and a surge of sword intent spread out like waves in a boundless ocean, instantly oppressing Long Zishan’s body and the surrounding void. A series of invisible sword-lights appeared out of thin air and those sword-lights engulfed Long Zishan from every direction.

“Such a weird sword technique.” Long Zishan’s expression changed.

Under the coverage of those sword-lights, Long Zishan had to defend himself with all his strength as he retreated.

The two were exchanging moves, and it was obvious that Long Zishan was at a disadvantage.

However, Long Zishan was no longer Jian Wushuang’s opponent. At the same time, while Jian Wushuang was fighting Long Zishan, that cold woman, Yu Aoqing had disappeared. The moment Jian Wushuang repelled Long Zishan, he felt chills crept up his back.

Jian Wushuang was instantly alerted.

Swash!

A cyclone was formed out of thin air and in the center of the cyclone, a jet-black dagger came straight out.

The dagger exuded an astonishing gleam of phantom-like chilliness and went straight for Jian Wushuang’s back.

Yu Aoqing, the dagger’s owner, had an extremely cold expression on her face.

Swish!

The dagger penetrated Jian Wushuang’s body but surprisingly it did not hit any tangible matter. Instead, it made an air cutting sound.

The dagger stabbed nothing but air.

“Was that just a shadow?”

“That’s fast!”

Yu Aoqing squinted her eyes slightly before instantly located Jian Wushuang’s location and creeping up beside him.

Jian Wushuang casually raised his hand and wielded his sword.

It was an ordinary sword movement that seemed powerless, yet it had completely held Yu Aoqing captive. Yu Aoqing was unable to evade, forcing her to discharge her divine powers to parry off that attack.

Clang!

There was a low and muffled impact sound. Yu Aoqing’s figure was slightly shaken. The dagger in her hand collided with the sword-light resulting in its directional change, but she still managed to resist the sword attack.

Swoosh!

Yu Aoqing’s figure backed away and pulled some distance apart from Jian Wushuang.

“Be careful, he is very fast. His sword techniques are also very strange and terrifying,” shouted Yu Aoqing in a low voice.

Long Zishan as well as the other four Great Compassion Sect First-Class Divine Demons disciples had also noticed the same issues.

“Don’t fight against him one-on-one, use the Four Elephant Formation,” shouted Long Zishan.

The four Great Compassion Sect First-Class Divine Demons disciples exchanged glances and nodded.

The very next moment, the four emanated their auras which merged into a powerful entity under their formation.

Swoosh!

Those four First-Class Divine Demons simultaneously moved.

All four of them attacked but Jian Wushuang felt like it was coming from only one person.

“Is that a formation?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He could not help but started to admire how incomparable the other sects in the Wusha Wilderness were to the Great Compassion Sect.

He had killed so many other sects’ genius disciples in the past half a day, yet he had never encountered such a formation that could fully integrate a team’s combat power as one and unleashed its full potential like how those four First-Class Divine Demons had just done.

The four had a tacit understanding of each other and worked well together, making the formation’s power greater.

The formation did not add up their combat power like one-plus-one but multiplied it by multiple folds.

It was obvious that when the four First-Class Divine Demons teamed up, they gave Jian Wushuang a much more terrifying feeling than ordinary Peak Divine Demons.

Long Zishan’s combat power was no less than a Peak Divine Demon, but the threat and pressure Long Zishan brought to Jian Wushuang were no greater than the current four First-Class Divine Demons altogether.

“The four joined forces and didn’t give me a chance to break them apart. That’s quite smart,” murmured Jian Wushuang while still being extremely relaxed.

“Kill him!”

One of the four murderous First-Class Divine Demons waved a giant axe in his hand.

Bang!

A towering axe’s shadow appeared out of thin air and went down full force on Jian Wushuang.

“This power has definitely reached the Peak Divine Demon Realm,” exclaimed Jian Wushuang as his figure swayed and left a few space-time shadows behind.

The axe cut through those shadows but never managed to land a hit on Jian Wushuang’s physical body.
