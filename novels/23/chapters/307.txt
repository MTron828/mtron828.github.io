“I will leave now,” Tan Feng said while clasping his hands. He left directly.

Leng Ruxue appeared in front of her elder sister and said angrily, “Elder Sister, didn’t you say that Big Brother would not die? Did you lie to me?”

“No, I didn’t lie to you.” Leng Rushuang shook her head and replied coldly, “He is still alive, but he would have died if Tan Feng had stayed.”

“Alive?” Leng Ruxue was shocked, as she had just seen Tan Feng kill Jian Wushuang and take his body away.

“Come with me.” Leng Rushuang did not explain and moved toward the lake.

Leng Ruxue followed her sister.

They appeared over the lake and looked downward. After a while, Jian Wushuang showed up in the lake.

“Big Brother.”

Leng Ruxue could not believe it. “Who was killed?”

“It was his doppelganger.”

Leng Rushuang stared at the Triple-kill Sword while saying, “His tactic is unusual indeed. He can use the natural power and has a doppelganger. How powerful he is!

“We thought he planned to escape under cover of the lake. Actually, the moment he jumped into the lake, he himself was parted from the doppelganger. He also unbound the sword and Interspatial Ring. Then he let his doppelganger take them and appear before Tan Feng.

“He gave up his most important magic weapon and all his treasures in order to deceive Tan Feng. He let Tan Feng think that he was dead, so he could have a chance to survive.

“Like a phoenix, rising from the ashes!

“He is very decisive!”

It was known that Leng Rushuang had been as cold as frost. She was so powerful that few things could shock her, but she was surprised by what she saw today.

Jian Wushuang was too decisive. In an instant, he gave up all his possessions, including his precious Triple-kill Sword, and quickly carried out his plan.

An ordinary warrior might not be able to act decisively like him.

Because of his decisiveness, he could save himself.

If Jian Wushuang had not given up his Triple-kill Sword, Tan Feng would have wondered about the whereabouts of the Triple-kill Sword after he killed its owner. Tan Feng had recognized that the Triple-kill Sword was unusual, so he would not leave without it. Then he would go back to look for it and would find Jian Wushuang hiding at the bottom of the lake.

Leng Rushuang said Jian Wushuang was resolute, because she saw his determination.

She knew that Jian Wushuang would challenge Tan Feng again and take his Triple-kill Sword back if he could survive.

It all came from his confidence in his own strength and talent.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was floating in the lake. He struggled to approach the shore. As soon as he reached the shore, he fell down and fainted.

Although his doppelganger had independent consciousness, it was still connected to the true self. Once the doppelganger was killed, the true self would suffer a lot. Moreover, the second volume of Soul-Devouring Secret Skill he performed had placed a heavy burden on him.

He himself was seriously injured in the fight with Tan Feng.

Therefore, he had been on the edge of collapse. It was a miracle that he could hold on till now.

Leng Rushuang and Leng Ruxue appeared by Jian Wushuang’s side.

“Big Brother.” Leng Ruxue immediately stooped down and wanted to help him up.

Leng Rushuang glanced at Jian Wushuang. Then she waved her hand, a blast of invisible power slowly lifting his body.

“Let’s go. Bring him back to Nature Residence. Maybe we can save his life,” Leng Rushuang said peacefully.

“Okay.” Leng Ruxue did not refuse to return this time. Then she flew away with her elder sister.

...

A larger number of warriors were waiting for the battle result in Heartless City.

“I wonder whether Protector Swordsman can escape from Tan Feng’s hands.”

“I think he could. Our Protector Swordsman has the battle strength of the Saint Realm. Maybe he could not fight against Tan Feng, but he is able to run for his life.”

“I don’t think so. You know, Tan Feng has mastered Domain. He is much stronger than Man Yan.”

Many experts of the Heartless Sect were waiting above the void.

They originally wanted to follow Jian Wushuang and Tan Feng, but they did not have an opportunity, because Jian Wushuang and Tan Feng were too fast.

Soon after, an old figure appeared before their eyes. He was Tan Feng.

“We know the result.” They all looked at Tan Feng.

Whoosh!

The fat middle-aged man from Holy Emperor Palace appeared by Tan Feng’s side and asked with a smile, “Sir, how did it go?”

“Since I dealt with such a nobody personally, what do you think?” Tan Feng gave a faint smile.

“You mean he is dead?” The middle-aged man’s eyes lit up.

Tan Feng did not explain. He waved his hand, the corpse of “Jian Wushuang” appearing in front of them.

Many experts’ face fell after watching this. In contrast, the middle-aged man became excited.

He exclaimed, “Haha, Jian Wushuang, this is him indeed.

“This guy and his father posed a threat to our Holy Emperor Palace. Though his father is more dangerous, the boy has infinite potential. If given several years, he would catch up with his father. Now we have killed him.”

“Sir, thanks for your help,” the middle-aged man said gratefully.

“Don’t forget the things you promised to me.” Tan Feng smiled and looked at the middle-aged man.

“Sir, don’t worry. Our Holy Emperor Palace pays more attention to our reputation than those two things.” The middle-aged man nodded in delight. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The big news soon spread through the Skywave Prefecture.

Swordsman, who had just taken the place of Man Yan, was killed by Tan Feng.

It was believable because Tan Feng had displayed his corpse in front of many people.

The whole Skywave Prefecture sighed with emotion for this peerless genius.

The next day, the Bloodmoon List was renewed. The name of Swordsman was removed on the list, which also proved that Jian Wushuang was dead.
