Chapter 5276 - 5276: Been Discovered

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Perhaps in the entire Original Universe, only Jian Wushuang was this extravagant.

Jian Wushuang had his own plans. He never intended to push his divine body to its extreme limits from the beginning. His advantage lay in the path of the origin source. But now, that path was no longer feasible. So why not perfect his physical body first, especially the undying and indestructible aspects of his supreme physique? The temptation was irresistible.

With just a strand of hair, he could fully recover. He could even condense a clone with a single breath. This was exactly what he had dreamed of.

Preserving his life always took precedence!

Only with life could he contend.

As for his divine body, he had the Beast God Domain; he wasn’t in a rush about that.

This time, his basic divine body was expected to be 3,000 times stronger, a small achievement.

With the addition of the Beast God Domain, he could reach around 10,000 times, just enough to cultivate his supreme physique.

When he returned to the city wall, he realized there wasn’t a single person there. It made sense; in a month’s time, many had entered the Time Chamber, preparing to make a desperate attempt.

If they could advance to the level of extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals, they might have a chance to fight again. Without the combat power of extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals, staying behind meant waiting for death.

They were now terrified by the ninth wave, fearing that the subsequent waves would continue to increase in difficulty.

Looking at the dark turmoil outside the city, Jian Wushuangs eyes turned, resonating slightly with the chaos.

Buzz!

A pair of crimson eyes flickered, but in an instant, they disappeared into the darkness.

Jian Wushuang saw it clearly, his eyebrows furrowing slightly.

Just now, a trace of thought power enveloped a transmitted message. He couldn’t understand it; it seemed to belong to the language of the Devouring Demons.

“Do these Devouring Demons realize that I am similar to them?” Jian Wushuang was shocked!

Cold sweat instantly broke out on his back. If that was the case, the higher-ups of the Qishen Temple might also notice.

Maybe they had already found out!

Considering how the Qishen Temple treated these Devouring Demons, obviously considering them as monsters while he possessed the power of devouring, this association made Jian Wushuangs eyes reveal a hint of fear.

He quickly crushed the information enveloped in thought power.

He buried the devouring desire deep down, taking a deep breath.

If the Qishen Temple discovered the secret within him and didn’t take action against him, it meant he hadn’t crossed the Qishen Temple’s bottom line yet.

It seemed this place was not an opportunity but a tomb!

His tomb, Jian Wushuangs tomb.

If someone wanted to harm him, no matter how many cards he had, he wouldn’t be able to resist.

Fortunately, his mental state was strong enough. He steadied his mind.

In the sky.

A space was torn apart, and from the rift, a woman in red armor stepped out.

Her features were delicate, her eyes icy, and her face bore visible lines. She wore a red armor, exuding a powerful aura.

Jian Wushuang knew she was the one Qiuhuang had mentioned. He quickly approached and respectfully bowed.

The woman in red armor spoke with a deep voice, a lifeless tone that made Jian Wushuangs spirit tremble. Despite her lack of visible energy, the pressure she exerted was stronger than Zhen Wuyang, stronger than any Emperor he had ever encountered.

“Jian Wushuang, I am here on Lord Qishen’s orders to take you to the Demon Sound Mountain for your Nine Body Refinement.”

“Thank you, Emperor!” Jian Wushuang bowed again, showing the respect he had accumulated over the years for powerful beings.

“You may call me Zhu Qi,” said Zhu Qi, her cold and delicate face showing dissatisfaction with the title Emperor’.

Jian Wushuang stood aside, quickly nodding in agreement. However, he still added the honorific ‘Lord’ before her name.

“No need to resist. I will take you through a time-space transfer!” Zhu Qi extended her slender arm, her palm revealing an eye. She grabbed Jian Wushuang, who found himself sucked into that eye. Through Zhu Qi’s eye, he could see the outside world.

It was truly miraculous!

Jian Wushuang felt like a child at the fair for the first time, wide-eyed and curious. He looked around, but no matter how he shifted his gaze, the scene before him remained unchanged.

Indeed, this was Lord Zhu Qi’s perspective.

The two individuals, or rather just Zhu Qi alone, returned to the spatial crack and appeared in the void of the Original Universe.

They appeared within a massive formation, and Zhu Qi took out a token from his hand, on which Jian Wushuang recognized the words ‘Vermilion Bird Temple, Zhu Qi’.

“Vermilion Bird Temple, Zhu Qi!” Jian Wushuang whispered to himself. According to his deductions, the Zhu Yi mentioned by Qiuhuang should be the Temple Master.

This realization relieved him. Initially, he thought it might be the Temple Master of the Qishen Temple. It seemed the Qishen Temple was much stronger than he had imagined.

At least, any random individual there was more powerful than all the Emperors he had ever encountered. Perhaps his vision was limited, unable to perceive the truth.

However, this Lord Zhu Qi was undoubtedly much stronger than Zhen Wuyang.

After placing the token into the formation, the world spun around them. Jian Wushuang felt the scene before his eyes swirling.

The sensation of everything spinning didn’t bother Jian Wushuang. It continued until everything he saw turned into a circular tunnel. Zhu Qi took a step forward, and the tunnel vanished. The world stopped spinning, and Jian Wushuang could finally see the outside clearly.

The majestic Demon Sound Mountain stood before him, shrouded in mist drifting in the sky. The pitch-black mountain was bare, not much different from the primordial stars.

Upon reaching their destination, Zhu Qi did not show any intention of releasing Jian Wushuang.

Zhu Qi landed at the entrance at the foot of the mountain, and Jian Wushuang blinked, observing everything outside.

Whoosh!Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In the next moment, Zhu Qi’s figure moved like a ghost. On the narrow path, countless figures were walking slowly, while Zhu Qi covered a hundred yards with each step.

He surpassed everyone!

Although Zhu Qi was fast, Jian Wushuang could still clearly see the world outside.

“What is that?” Jian Wushuang was astonished!

That venerable monk sitting cross-legged on the 3,000-feet mark… Wasn’t it Qianshou Buddha he had seen before?

“Qianshou Buddha, and countless other Buddhas!” Jian Wushuang squinted. It seemed that the opportunity Qiuhuang mentioned was right here!

Seeing the Emperors struggling to walk a couple of feet in distance, he understood why Zhu Qi had taken him under her wing.

If Emperors were finding it hard to traverse this path, he would probably die instantly if he ventured out!

Familiar figures appeared before him. The once mighty Emperors, now struggling to walk a couple of feet, looked like elderly people, stopping for a rest every couple of steps.

Zhu Qi’s speed was impressive. In no time, he reached halfway up the mountain.

This place was different from below. There was a pagoda reigning over this area. Jian Wushuang was familiar with this pagoda; it was the Eternal Tower’ of the peak power.

The Eternal Tower, which was now only several hundred feet in size, was surrounded by hundreds of evil figures madly attacking it from the outside.

Although he couldn’t sense their aura, judging from their eyes, he recognized the identities of these evil figures..
