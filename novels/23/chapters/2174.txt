Chapter 2175 Hell on Earth!

“Insane!”“They have lost their minds!”

“The Three Emperors World people have all lost it, killing everyone in sight!”

“There are so many dead. Countless cultivators in my city have slaughtered each other. All are dead!”

The messages were being sent to Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai as soon as they could.

With the Crimson Light covering the Three Emperors World, countless cultivators – Real God or Sector God – could not resist it. Being powerful simply slowed the time of transformation.

But the Crimson Light barely affected the Almighties, and the Almighties of the Three Emperors World were not affected either.

But they saw what the Three Emperors World experts had done.

“Assholes!” Emperor Bai shouted.

“Worse than dogs!” Jian Wushuang had his eyes dead on Kaiser Blood. He had never wanted to kill another so badly in his life.

He had already witnessed Kaiser Blood sacrificing all those experts for his own personal objective – activating the Opposing Blood Formation.

That alone disgusted Jian Wushuang and the others.

But what Kaiser Blood was doing outdid everything else.

Previously, he was only targeting the Chaotic Realm and above experts. But now Kaiser Blood’s claws have stretched to all the Cultivators within the Three Emperors World.

Most of them were weak, innocent cultivators.

But there were millions and millions of them.

Amongst the normal cultivators were newly-born infants and strong-willed youths.

Even Jian Wushuang treated the enemy with mercy, only taking out the high-level experts of the Three Emperors World. The Eternal Chaotic World had no intention of attacking anyone below Chaotic Real God.

Even the enemies treated them with mercy.

But, as the leader of the Three Emperors World, Kaiser Blood’s actions had sincerely enraged Jian Wushuang and the others!

With the Crimson Light covering the Three Emperors World, countless cultivators were slaughtering each other, the Three Emperors World had turned into a hell on earth!

Such demonic measures!

“If I took down Kaiser Blood now, would the formation stop?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No way,” Emperor Bai shook his head. “The formation is already in place, the cultivators have all turned into demons. Even if we took down Kaiser Blood now, there would be no way to save the cultivators anymore.”

Nothing would change even if the formation stopped.

Furthermore, it was easier said than done, taking down Kaiser Blood.

If Emperor Bai could have, he would have done it already.

“If I had destroyed the Opposing Blood Formation earlier…” Jian Wushuang’s face sunk in despair.

He had tried his best.

But despite all efforts, he had failed.

Emperor Bai took a deep breath, but he was much calmer than Jian Wushuang.

Emperor Bai was an expert from the First Era – he had seen much worse than Jian Wushuang.

He had witnessed too many disasters in his lifetime.

When the First Era collapsed, countless Cultivators fell. That was much scarier than what was happening in the Three Emperors World.

Emperor Bai had seen it all.

Even though he felt pity for what was happening in the Three Emperors World, it was no more than that.

In front, Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, Leng Ruxue and Ba Su stood side by side.

Amongst the five, Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu had no pity for the cultivators of the Three Emperors World at all. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Leng Ruxue had that wicked smile on her face still.

Ba Su was petrified however, and he even regretted joining the Three Emperors World forces at that moment. Even though the Three Emperors World made him more powerful, the things Kaiser Blood and the rest had done scared him.

“Kaiser Blood, how is the progress?” Lord Fen asked casually.

“It is going as expected. No cultivator below Chaotic Realm can resist it, and have all started slaughtering each other.”

“The more they slaughter, the more Blood Qi they offer to me. About thirty percent of the cultivators have died already,” Kaiser Blood was smiling deviously as if the thirty percent were no more than ants to him.

“Thirty percent? How’s the Blood Qi then?” Lord Fen followed.

“Not bad, once they all die, the Blood Qi should be enough,” Kaiser Blood said.

The Opposing Blood Formation was a sinister formation he had spent ages crafting.

The energy source of the formation was boundless Blood Qi.

How had he gained it?

From the endless slaughter of others.

When the cultivators of the Three Emperors World self-destructed, the Blood Qi he gained from them helped him to get the Formation working.

But that was only the beginning.

If Kaiser Blood wanted to truly activate the formation, he needed much more Blood Qi.

That was how the Crimson Light had started to cover the entire Three Emperors World.

The endless slaughter brought boundless Blood Qi for the formation.

“Hmm?”

“Forty percent,” Kaiser Blood said.

That was only a moment after.

It only took a moment of time to turn from thirty to forty percent?

How many millions of cultivators had died in that instant?

How terrifying was that, that speed?

“Die!” Only one word came from his mouth.

So much rage and anger could be felt from within his sentence.

“Kill them all,” Jian Wushuang was equally pumped up.

They could not stop the formation, but they would not stand back.
