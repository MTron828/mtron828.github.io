Chapter 1435: The Second Part of The Task

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“In thirty years, he completed the first part of the task?”

When Hall Master Yuan received the news, he was shocked.

Although the first part of the task was the simplest among the three, Hall Master Yuan thought Jian Wushuang could use some time and effort to complete it.

After all, although the eleven targets were easy, most of them were among bandit groups. To kill them among the bandit groups wasn’t that easy.

Under normal circumstances, Jian Wushuang could first pretend to be a bandit and blend in with the bandit group. Then, he could seize a chance to kill the target. But, in the end, it obviously wasn’t carried out like that.

“This young man swept all the bandit groups with ferocious power one after another. It seems that after he passed through his inverse cultivation test, his power increased to be much greater than I’d imagined,” Hall Master Yuan complemented and he then sent Jian Wushuang a message.

“Jian Wushuang, you’ve completed your first part of the task. The one billion Chaos Gems, I’ll give them to you after you return to Lineage of Star.”

“Now, I’ll assign you your second part of the task. Listen carefully.”

Jian Wushuang listened attentively.

“At the border of the boundless void, there was a huge piece of floating land called Floating City. In Floating City, there was a Universe God named Su Hong waiting for your arrival. Your task is to escort the Universe God across the boundless void into Purple Moon Sanctuary,” Hall Master said.

“Escorting?” Jian Wushuang first stunned then he creased his eyebrows, “Only escorting across the boundless void? It’s so simple?

“Simple? No, the second part of the task is far more difficult than the first. Plus, there is a very high reward for it. The reward for completion of your second part of the task is to stay in Real God Hall for one month,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

Real God Hall!

It was the most precious land of opportunities in Lineage of Star. The reason that he could master a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation was due to Real God Hall.

It was a pity that the terms to enter Real God Hall were too exacting. Even disciples of Star Palace would only have one chance to enter for free and could only stay for one month per visit.

Then, the reward for the second part of the task was to enter Real God Hall again. The reward was much more precious than one billion Chaos Gems.

With such an abundant reward, the difficulty of the task would definitely be far beyond the first part of the task.

“I’m only telling you the requirement of the task. As for the exact cause and reason, meet up with the owner of Floating City and Universe God Su Hong when you arrive at Floating City and they will clarify everything with you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He cut off his communication with Hall Master Yuan. Then, Jian Wushuang took out the map.

“Floating City, it’s there… It’s not that far from me. With my speed, I should be able to get there in twenty years!”

Jian Wushuang waved and a huge spaceship appeared from nowhere.

Jian Wushuang got the spaceship from a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven when he was completing the first part of his task. It was of a much higher level spaceship compared to his own, the travel speed was much faster too.

Jian Wushuang drove the spaceship towards Floating City directly and he arrived at Floating City before the twenty years was up.

Floating City was at the border of the boundless void.

To be able to take up such a huge plot of floating land there showed that the owner of Floating City was a man with remarkable power. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Jian Wushuang arrived at the city owner’s palace and met the owner of Floating City, Jian Wushuang understood.

The owner of Floating City was a Real God expert and he was extremely strong among Real Gods. Although he couldn’t be compared with Lei Chao, who was an expert on the Real God ranking list, he wasn’t any weaker than the deacon elderlies in the Lineage of Star.

In a lofty hall.

“Disciple of Star Palace?”

A good looking middle-aged man dressed in luxurious clothes, also the owner of Floating City, looked Jian Wushuang up and down, “Well done. He hired a disciple of Star Palace from Lineage of Star. The ancestor of Su Family is quite capable.”

“Ancestor of Su Family?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

He came before he accepted the disciple task of Lineage of Star. As for the ancestor of Su Family, he had no idea about it.

“I called Su Hong over,” the owner of Floating city smiled faintly.

Soon, a black-haired man in singlet walked into the hall.

“City owner,” the black-haired man bowed politely at the owner of Floating City.

“Su Hong, the person who will escort you to Purple Moon Sanctuary is here. It’s this person next to you,” the owner of Floating City said.

The black-haired man named Su Hong immediately turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Su Hong, greetings. I wonder, what’s your name, mister?” Su Hong asked humbly.

“I’m Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Jian Wushuang?” Su Hong tried to think quickly in his head but he had never heard of Jian Wushuang’s name. He then creased his eyebrows.

“Su Hong, you should be glad. Your ancestor at home thinks quite highly of you. He even paid an outstanding price to hire a disciple of Star Palace to escort you,” the owner of Floating City smiled.

“Disciple of Star Palace?” Su Hong had his eyes wide-open and he immediately revealed a happy expression.

He was originally from Purple Moon Sanctuary and he knew the overlord of Purple Moon Sanctuary, Lineage of Star. At the same time, he also knew just how impressive the disciple of Star Palace from Lineage of Star was.

A Universe God in the Third Heaven, who was a disciple of Star Palace, was definitely one of the top among Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

“City owner Universe God Su Hong, although I received the escort mission, I have no idea what I might come across during the process of escorting. I don’t think the issue is bandits that are wandering in the boundless void, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“If it was just to deal with the bandits, there would be no need for you, a disciple of Star Palace, to come,” the owner of Floating City smiled as he replied. He looked towards Su Hong and said, “Su Hong, you should tell him.”

“Yes,” Su Hong nodded and started explaining, “Mister Jian Wushuang, to be frank with you, I am a descendant of the direct line of Su Family in the Land of Fire and Ice in Purple Moon Sanctuary. We, Su Family, have been businessmen through generations. We have many properties in the Land of Fire and Ice, and can be considered a force with decent power.”

“However, among Su Family, there is another hidden sect. The sect shares a different surname and is under the control of a person with different surname. They have been rather rampant recently and they have been trying to overwhelm the voice of the host. Especially when there was an accident not long ago, the head of the Su Family passed away and there was no one among the direct line of descendants who was qualified to inherit the position. Hence, the ancestor of Su Family selected me, who has been wandering outside to return to Purple Moon Sanctuary to inherit the position as the head of the Su Family.”

“So, the sect with the different surname naturally wouldn’t let me return to the Su Family after they found out about the news.”
