Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The same time when Jian Wushuang and the others arrived at the outskirts of Bane City.

Many figures were standing in another void. These figures were exuding extremely strong divine power.

Their divine power obviously meant that they had achieved the level of Grand Ultimate God.

However, the crucial part was that there were more than 20 figures standing in this void and that meant that there were more than 20 Grand Ultimate Gods!

It had to be known that there were many factions in the Crimson Stone Fort and Blood Thunder King’s faction was publicly known for having the most Grand Ultimate Gods. However, they also only had around a dozen of them.

Standing in front of these 20 over Grand Ultimate Gods were the extremely beautiful yet strict Yin Su’er. She looked at the huge city in front of her with a cold look in her eyes.

“It’s almost time, let’s take action right away.” Yin Su’er had a serious expression on her face. With the wave of her hand, the 20 over Grand Ultimate Gods behind her immediately started moving.

These 20 over Grand Ultimate Gods instantly turned into 20 over streams of light while Yin Su’er also went skimming out. They appeared in the void on top of Bane City within the blink of an eye.

Rumble~~~

One after another, huge coercive forces directly came suppressing down.

Yun Shan and the others who were hiding in a secret chamber located in Bane City were instantly alerted.

Then, a large number of people directly rose up.

“Yin Su’er!!” A strict glance was released from the eyes of a short elder with young features and old man’s hair. His glance came exploding towards Yin Su’er like two lightning bolts. The divine power that belonged to a Peak Grand Ultimate God was also released from his body.

This short elder was the person controlling another large faction in the Crimson Stone Fort, Yun Shan!!

“Are you finally taking action?” Yun Shan had a cold look in his eyes.

“Yun Shan, we’ve been fighting for so many years and we should end it today.” Yin Su’er’s voice could be heard in the entire Bane City.

“Everybody, kill!!”

Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

More than 20 over Grand Ultimate Gods behind Yin Su’er immediately took action and went rushing down like extremely hungry beasts.

“Block their way.” Yun Shan also yelled out with a low voice and around a dozen Grand Ultimate Gods around him also came rushing forward fiercely with overwhelming aura.

A total of almost 40 Grand Ultimate Gods from both sides instantaneously started fighting one another.

The huge battle completely broke out.

“It’s started.” Jian Wushuang and the others stood in the void outside of Bane City. Although they were some distance away, they were still able to clearly see what was happening in the city and felt the waves of scary hums exploding in the city at the same time. Behind Jian Wushuang, Old Tong, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, An Ying and Lan Junzhu also had different expressions on their faces.

“Crimson Stone Fort, it’s a fight between two of their strongest factions.”

“That is the Crimson Stone Fort Master, Yin Su’er while the other is the Crimson Stone Fort’s First Elder, Yun Shan. Rumors state that these two have been fighting for many years and have gone through all sorts of fights since the falling of the Crimson Stone Saint. Are they finally ending things now?”

“There are so many Grand Ultimate Gods. Didn’t they say that these two factions of the Crimson Stone Fort only have around seven to eight Grand Ultimate Gods? Even Blood Thunder King that has the most Grand Ultimate Gods, have around a dozen only. However, why... Why are there so many here?”

“There should be around a total of forty Grand Ultimate Gods here, right? This is the first time I’ve seen a battle between so many Grand Ultimate Gods.” Old Tong and the others secretly sighed.

Grand Ultimate Gods were definitely the strongest experts in the Danyang Continent.

Under normal circumstances, one could easily build a first-class force in the Danyang Continent with two to three Grand Ultimate Gods while pinnacle forces had around one dozen of them.

There were around 40 of them here... In the Danyang Holy Domain, only the Crimson Stone Fort was capable of this.

Even Jian Wushuang had to gasp with admiration that a lean camel was still bigger than a horse.

“It looks like Yin Su’er has taken over the other four smaller factions in the Crimson Stone Fort. Those small factions have a couple of Grand Ultimate Gods and they all listen to her right now. She really has some strong ways.” Jian Wushuang mumbled.

He had to admit that Yin Su’er really had some tricks up her sleeves or it would be impossible for her to support the Crimson Stone Fort alone for so many years.

There were currently a total of 20 over Grand Ultimate Gods under Yin Su’er’s lead. All of them were much stronger in both volume and quality, even their higher level combat power... In the void located in the middle of Bane City, Yin Su’er was having a combat with Yun Shan and the two of them were pushing their power to the limit.

However, Jian Wushuang could obviously see that Yin Su’er definitely had the upper hand in this battle.

It could be said that Yin Su’er’s side had an absolute upper hand in both higher level combat power and the fights between the Grand Ultimate Gods.

‘She definitely has an advantage and it’s quite a huge one. However, it would be difficult to completely defeat Yun Shan’s faction or kill Yun Shan in a short period of time based on this advantage alone. The other forces must have received news now that this battle has exploded and they must be rushing over right now.’ Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

As he was thinking about this, the token given by Blood Thunder King and stored in his interspatial ring immediately reacted.

“Alliance Master Su Han, Yin Su’er has already taken action, please hurry to Bane City.” There was a hint of anxiety in Blood Thunder King’s voice.

Blood Thunder King obviously did not expect Yin Su’er to take action so speedily as she directly found a chance to carry out a sudden raid. Apart from that, she did such a good job in keeping it a secret that no information was leaked previously.

“I’ve already received news and am rushing my way over. I will be there momentarily.” Jian Wushuang purposely sent a message.

Moments later, he took the token up again. “Blood Thunder King, I’ve already rushed over to the void outside Bane City and I’m in this direction.”

Jian Wushuang informed Blood Thunder King of his location before glancing at Old Tong. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Old Tong, Blood Thunder King is coming in a short while. In order to be safe, hide yourself. You can take action after I’ve sent you a message.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright.” Old Tong nodded and went skimming towards the surrounding void by himself.

Moments later, more than a dozen figures came rushing over.

A total of 16 people arrived and everyone of them had strong divine power. They were all in the Grand Ultimate God level but they were only Primary-level and High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. There were no Peak Grand Ultimate Gods among them.

“Alliance Master Su Han, you travel so speedily.” A smile immediately appeared on Blood Thunder King’s face when he saw Jian Wushuang.

“Coincidentally, there’s a spatial passage located in the territory belonging to my Sword Alliance that connects to the void nearby to Bane City. That is why I arrived sooner.” Jian Wushuang said.

“I see.” Blood Thunder King raised his eyebrows before turning his attention to the Grand Ultimate Gods behind Jian Wushuang.

“Hmm? Why aren’t Old Tong and Old Snake here?” Blood Thunder King asked in surprise.

“My Sword Alliance has been continuously expanding recently and we’ve attracted many strong opponents. I have to keep some power in the Sword Alliance to attend to them during this mission, I hope that you can understand.” Jian Wushuang said.
