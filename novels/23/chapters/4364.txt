4368 Chase After

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang turned his head to look at the three great masters, and his expression suddenly became so gloomy that it could drip water.

He had never expected that Supreme Lie Chen would have a pair of heart’s eye heavenly pupils that could see through the illusions of the world.

Now, it was probably impossible for him to hide his identity again.

“Fine, since you like to chase after me, I’ll give you a big gift!”

Jian Wushuang stretched out his hand to touch the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword that was hidden behind his black robe. The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

Whoosh!

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang took a step forward and shot toward the Galaxy!

“Hahaha, Jian Wushuang, you came to me and now you want to escape?”

The three great masters looked at each other and laughed.

At that moment, even Green River Supreme, who had just experienced the pain of losing his grandson, had long forgotten the pain. In his eyes, there was only greed for the reward and the treasures that Jian Wushuang had on him!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The three of them followed closely behind and soon disappeared into Planet Tianhuang.

On the Spratly sand island.

Everyone watched the four of them leave with their mouths wide open, unable to come back to their senses for a long time.

It was not until a long time later that they heard the sound of people swallowing their saliva in unison.

“Did you guys hear what Supreme Lie Chen just said? The masked man is Jian Wushuang!”

“I heard that Jian Wushuang became powerful because of the Tarot Divine Sword. He didn’t even use the Tarot Divine Sword just now, but he was able to fight against three great Supremes. It seems that the universe has seriously underestimated Jian Wushuang’s power!”

“I said before that Young Master Qingmu could easily defeat Jian Wushuang. Now it seems that I was too short-sighted and ignorant.”

A Ruler who had previously said that Young Master Qingmu could suppress Jian Wushuang said with a bitter smile.

Jian Wushuang is the real number one heaven’s favorite in the world. He’s overpowered everyone in his generation!

“Young Master Qingmu, you’re far from that!”

More people looked at Jian Wushuang’s disappearing back with awe and envy.

They were all Ultimate Rulers, but Jian Wushuang’s strength was far from theirs.

It was only at this moment that they finally believed that there really were existences in the universe who weren’t even at the Ruler realm but were able to contend with Supremes!

On the other side of the Spratly Islands.

The star rhythm Ruler was in a daze. When Jian Wushuang defeated Young Master Qingmu, she thought that Jian Wushuang was just bullying a junior because of his cultivation. Now that she knew that Jian Wushuang was also in the Ultimate Ruler Realm, the invincible illusion and worship she had for Young Master Qingmu instantly shattered.

“It turns out that he…he is Jian Wushuang.”

The Starstreak Ruler muttered to herself.

Stardust, comparing that Young Master Qingmu to Jian Wushuang is like comparing a grain of rice to the bright moon. You have eyes but no pupils.

The Stardust Ruler sighed and looked at the place where Jian Wushuang had disappeared. His eyes were filled with longing.

“This is how a man should be.”

…

Outside Planet Tianhuang.

Jian Wushuang turned into a ray of light and sped forward.

The three great Supremes, Lie Chen, Green River, and Darknorth, also turned into shooting stars and followed closely behind.

“Lie Chen, if we force Jian Wushuang into a corner, he’ll definitely use the Tarot Divine Sword. We’ll have to rely on you to stop him then.”

Supreme Green River’s eyes flickered.

Supreme Lie Chen nodded his head and sneered, “As we all know, Jian Wushuang can only use the Tarot sword once. I’ll use the death substitution talisman to block it.”

With that, he flipped his right hand, and a person with the same appearance as him appeared.

There was a yellow talisman on the insignificant person’s forehead. It was enough to block a fatal blow for him!

It was because of the presence of the scapegoat that the three of them dared to pursue Jian Wushuang without any worries.

Supreme Green River smiled when he saw this. He then looked at Jian Wushuang and shouted, “Jian Wushuang, you little thief, surrender now. Hand over the Tarot Divine Sword and the ancient bronze cauldron, and I’ll spare your life!”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang looked at Supreme Green River as if he was looking at a fool. Then, without saying a word, he continued flying forward.

He remembered that there was a backtrack place not far away from Planet Tianhuang. The spacetime there was chaotic and the void was cracked all year round. It was the perfect place for him to use his trump cards!

“Jian Wushuang, this little thief, is leading us to the place of backtrack.”

Lie Chen and the other two were universe Supremes, so they were not stupid. After thinking for a while, they guessed Jian Wushuang’s intention.

“Hmph, the little thief’s escape route is just what I wanted. If we kill Jian Wushuang there, the remaining divine power fluctuations will immediately cause chaos in the void storm. No one will know that we killed Jian Wushuang and took the Tarot Divine Sword.”

As a result, the people on both sides each had their own ulterior motives, and they continuously approached the place of backtrack with a tacit understanding.

After the time it took for three incense sticks to burn, a Whirlpool made up of countless broken stars and meteorites appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped and turned to look at the three great masters.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang quickly thought of countermeasures in his mind,

Among the three great Rulers, the advanced-level Supreme Lie Chen was the strongest, followed by the middle-level Supreme Green River, and the weakest was Supreme Darknorth.

If Jian Wushuang wanted to escape, he would have to find a way to kill one of the Supreme martial artists. Otherwise, if the three Supreme martial artists worked together to cast a spell, even if he had the Tarot Divine Sword, he would only be defeated.

...

if we use the Tarot Divine Sword to kill Supreme Blazing Owl first, it’ll be too risky. It’s very likely that we won’t be able to kill him. Instead, we’ll be attacked by the other two great Supremes.

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought. Ever since he had used the Tarot Divine Sword, he had killed the Black Eagle Ruler and the others, but they were all beginner-stage Supremes. As for whether he could kill senior Supremes like Supreme Lie Chen, who were at a higher stage, he was really uncertain.

“In that case, why don’t we first use other divine abilities to hold off Supreme Blazing Owl and Supreme Darknorth, then kill them in a compromise…”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed and a cold killing intent surged in his eyes. He locked his gaze on the face of Supreme Green River, who was charging toward him!

First, kill Supreme Green River!

At this moment, the three Supreme martial artists who were following closely behind arrived together!

“Hahaha, Jian Wushuang, you little thief, you really know how to bury yourself!”

Supreme Green River stood in the middle and sized up Jian Wushuang from head to toe. A hint of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes.

As for Supreme Darknorth and Supreme Lie Chen, they took a step forward and blocked Jian Wushuang’s path of retreat. Then, they casually waved their hands and created a space of their own!

“Jian Wushuang, you little thief. I’ve said that I will kill you today!”

“Go to hell!”

...

Supreme Green River let out a maniacal laugh and took the lead to attack. The seven Star demonic saber reappeared in his hand, and a monstrous demonic might swept out in all directions, shattering the starry sky!

“If the heavens want them to die, they must first make them wild. Green River, the one who should die today is not me, but you!”

After Jian Wushuang finished his words, his eyes were filled with killing intent!

“Innate divine ability, life intimidation!”
