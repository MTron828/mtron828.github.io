Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’m really glad that we weren’t like Thousand-edge back then, who would rather burn his soul to commit suicide than submit,” Thousand Kills Emperor Lord said.

“Me too.” Blood Rain Demon Monarch nodded with a smile. “Thousand-edge is a little too stubborn. To be more precise, he’s a little too arrogant and unwilling to submit to a Principles Master. But he didn’t think that Blood Sword Master was able to comprehend a trace of the universe principle, and he was already so powerful at the level of a Principles Master. How great would he be in the future?

“It is not shameful to submit to such a great being.”

“This Blood Sword Master is very polite to us. It has only been 100,000 years. What is there to be unable to endure? Furthermore, this Blood Sword Master has promised to bring us out of Eternal Dark Prison. After 100,000 years, he will set us free. When that time comes, the universe will be so vast that we can go wherever we want.”

“Haha, right now, I feel that being able to submit to this Blood Sword Master is actually an opportunity for both of us,” said Thousand Kills Emperor Lord.

“Yes, I think so too. It’s definitely worth it to be able to leave Eternal Dark Prison after submitting to him for 100,000 years in exchange for real freedom.” Blood Rain Demon Monarch’s eyes were shining.

If 30 years ago, they were more or less reluctant to submit to Jian Wushuang, but they were forced by the situation.

Now, 30 years later, they were no longer reluctant. On the contrary, they were extremely willing to accept this fact and even regarded it as an opportunity.

…

In the ninth dark zone.

After separating from Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand Kills Emperor Lord, Jian Wushuang continued to wander around.

Unlike before, he was now absolutely confident in his own strength. Even without the token of a disciple of the Red Cloud Lineage, he had the ability to dominate the first level of Eternal Dark Prison.

Three days later, Jian Wushuang met an expert who was wandering alone, Ruler Wu Yan.

Ruler Wu Yan was a third-level master who ranked in the top 100 among the experts in the ninth dark zone.

His offensive power was extremely strong, his body protection ability was strong, and his speed was also good. If he fought in close combat, he could be said to have no weaknesses.

However, the only weakness of Ruler Wu Yan was that his life-saving ability was a little weak and he did not have very powerful life-saving methods.

“You are Blood Sword Master?”

Ruler Wu Yan, who was wearing black armor and carrying a saber on his back, stared at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

“It’s said that you were targeted by Thousand-edge Demon Monarch not long after you roamed in the ninth dark zone. Thousand-edge Demon Monarch was searching for you, trying to take away your principle true treasure Divine Sword. With his ability, he should have found you long ago, but you are still alive?

“Did you hand over your nomological true treasure sword to Thousand-edge Demon Monarch in exchange for your life?” Ruler Wu Yan frowned slightly.

“Ruler Wu Yan, don’t waste your time. Just attack.” Jian Wushuang did not bother to explain further.

“You’re courting death.” Ruler Wu Yan’s eyes turned cold. He transformed into a cold black blade and charged toward Jian Wushuang.

A suffocating power also pressed toward Jian Wushuang.

Knowing that Ruler Wu Yan was powerful, Jian Wushuang did not intend to fight him directly. Instead, he waved the Wu Qi Divine Sword in his hand and the endless essence spread out.

In an instant, a sea of sword essence filled every corner of the world, surrounding Ruler Wu Yan in the center.

“I have encountered many experts throughout my journey in the ninth dark zone. I have fought with many masters of the third level, but so far, I have never killed a master of the third level purely with my swordsmanship.”

“Ruler Wu Yan, you will be the first master of the third level that I will kill with my own strength!”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice resounded in the air.

It sounded like a joke to Ruler Wu Yan.

“Haha, ridiculous. You want to kill me?

“Even the five strongest experts in the ninth dark zone might not be able to do it. What are you?

“You are just a Principles Master. You should be so arrogant and accept your death!” Ruler Wu Yan shouted, his killing intent soared to the sky.

However, he could not get close to Jian Wushuang at all. The surrounding waves of sword essence were rushing toward him crazily. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The waves of sword essence were vast and mighty. With the support of the sword formation, the power of each wave was extremely strong. The power of each wave was not under the attack of an ordinary third-level master.

Ruler Wu Yan’s body was like a saber. It was extremely sharp, and he defeated the waves of sword essence that were rushing toward him.

However, after defeating dozens of waves of sword essence, Ruler Wu Yan’s situation changed.

“How can this be?”

“The waves of sword essence are as powerful as the attacks of a third-level master. But why do they seem endless and endless? And they are coming from all directions at the same time. I can only passively resist them. It’s fine for a short period of time, but if it goes on for a long time, how can I resist them?”

Ruler Wu Yan’s face was cold. He had sensed that Jian Wushuang’s sword formation was difficult to deal with.

Without hesitation, he immediately displayed his strongest move.

His entire body turned into a black saber, which was 30 meters long and emitted a monstrous power. It directly hacked at the sea of sword essence in front of him.

However, only a part of the sea of sword essence was destroyed by the Dark Saber. Immediately, a large amount of sword essence filled up and the Sea of sword essence immediately recovered.

“What?”

Ruler Wu Yan was shocked.

He realized that Jian Wushuang’s sword formation was not only extremely difficult to deal with, but also extremely tough. His strongest attack could not break the sword formation completely.

Since he could not break the sword formation, he could only be trapped in the sword formation and passively resist the impact of the waves of sword essence time and time again. He could not escape at all.

His divine power was also being consumed at an alarming rate. Over time, more than half of his divine power had been consumed.

“Before it evolved into a Wavelight sword formation, the Wavelight sword art could trap people, but the waves of sword essence of the Wavelight sword art were too weak. Any third-level Ruler could easily resist them without using much divine power. At that time, even if I trapped a third-level Ruler in the Wavelight sword art, I would not be able to kill him.”

“But now, it’s different,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

The Wavelight sword formation evolved from the Wavelight sword art was not only tough and hard to break, but the waves of sword essence were also very powerful. No third-level master dared to underestimate such power, they had to try their best to resist it, so it would consume a lot of their divine power.
