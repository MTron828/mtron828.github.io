Chapter 1646: The Fifth Level

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“This Monster King.”

Jian Wushuang held his sword with one hand, unleashed his speed and chased the Monster King continuously as he wanted to kill him.

However, although the Monster King’s speed was inferior to Jian Wushuang, he could still use the Power of Spacetime to move around in the void to dodge the attack. Hence, Jian Wushuang was unable to do anything to him for a period of time.

In no time, both their bodies stopped moving.

“Jian Wushuang, I admit that your current abilities are not weaker than mine. Thus, it’s pointless for us to continue fighting as we will not reach an outcome. As such, let us call it a day here,” the Monster King said.

“Call it a day? You wish!” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly, “Do you think that by relying on some of the different ways of using the Power of Spacetime to avoid fighting with me head-on, I would be unable to do anything to you? Don’t forget that I have yet to use my martial art motion at all.”

“Martial art motion?” the Monster King was shocked.

He remembered at once that back then, when Jian Wushuang had fought with him, he had unleashed a martial art motion. Moreover, that martial art motion was extremely strange and it could create hundreds of shadows at the same time.

At that very moment, when Jian Wushuang fought with him, he had indeed not used it yet.””

“Monster King, just admit your defeat earnestly.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated through the area. When his body moved fiercely, close to one hundred shadows appeared immediately.

Similarly, there were close to a hundred shadows. However, when Jian Wushuang unleashed that move at that very moment, it was completely different from before.

Previously, his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine had only had the right to clear the third level of the Doctrine Palace. However, at that moment, he was extremely close to the fifth level.

Furthermore, that martial art motion Secret Skill of his was closely linked to his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine.

Many shadows could be seen moving around in the void and their speeds were extremely fast.

Just like before, the Monster King wanted to rely on his Power of Spacetime to deal with Jian Wushuang. However, this time around, puff! A sword light appeared beside the Monster King straight away and there was no way for him to dodge the attack. Therefore, he could only choose to fight with Jian Wushuang head-on.

However, as soon as he clashed with Jian Wushuang head-on, he would definitely be completely suppressed.

“Damn it!”

The Monster King gritted his teeth and he had an extremely ugly expression. However, his situation became worse by the second and finally, Jian Wushuang’s sword struck his head.

Buzz~~~ The Fighting Space quietened down.

“Monster King, thank you very much for your twenty years of training time,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently.

The Monster King had a gloomy expression. At the same time, his eyes were glowing with a cold light and he was filled with dissatisfaction.

However, no matter how dissatisfied he was, with so many people looking at the Fighting Space, he could not go back on his words. Hence, he could only give twenty years of training time to Jian Wushuang earnestly.

After that, he gave a cold hum and left.

“Thirty years of training time.”

As Jian Wushuang looked at the extra numbers on his own Token of the Fairy Palace’s legacy, he revealed a smile.

For the Spacetime Doctrine, he was already extremely close to clearing the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace, and he was confident that he could achieve the standard needed to clear it in ten years’ time.

However, at that moment, he had a total of thirty years.

“This is more than enough and there is no need for me to continue betting on matches.”

Jian Wushuang moved his body and headed outside the Fighting Space immediately.

As soon as he walked out of the Fighting Space, he realized that many eyes were looking at him at once.

Those eyes were filled with admiration.

“This Jian Wushuang has actually defeated the Monster King?”

“He is the person recognized as the number one among the Void Real Gods. Moreover, he has only just made a breakthrough to Real God and it is obvious that there is still huge room for his abilities to improve.”

“It is really not possible to look at an Inverse Cultivator normally.”

Even though there were still voices discussing the matter, Jian Wushuang had already left.

After leaving the Fighting Space, Jian Wushuang came before the Fairy Palace again. After that, he entered the Spacetime Fairy Palace straight away and began his comprehension.

As per what Jian Wushuang expected, he managed to fully comprehend the fifteenth picture scroll within the Spacetime Fairy Palace in less than ten years.

With that, Jian Wushuang’s level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine was high enough to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace!

“By clearing the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace, one would possess the right to live in the Thunderbolt Island permanently. However, to achieve that, I would have to first challenge the Doctrine Palace for real.” Jian Wushuang laughed, “There’s no rush. Let me first grasp the power of the final stage of the Flowing Light Secret Skill. Moreover, I also have one trump card that I have not touched for many years and it’s time for me to take a look at it.”

Within the Thunderbolt Island, there were many standalone spaces which were prepared to allow some experts to practice their Secret Skills.

At that moment, within one of the stand-alone spaces which was in complete darkness, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

An uncountable number of shadows seemed to have flooded the whole standalone space. Moreover, those shadows were moving at high speed and it was impossible for anyone to use their naked eyes to differentiate the real body which was hiding within the shadows.

Puff!

All of a sudden, the great number of shadows dissipated and only Jian Wushuang remained in the whole standalone space.

“After my comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has achieved the standard needed to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace, I can indeed unleash the power of the final stage of the Flowing Light Phantom. However, I have only just entered the fifth level and it is still a bit difficult for me to unleash it. Compared to the Real God who created this martial art motion, I am probably still very far away. However, when my comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine reaches the peak of the fifth level, where it is extremely close to the sixth level, I should be comparable to that Real God,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

After having a good grasp of the martial art motion, Jian Wushuang flipped his hands and took out an item.

What Jian Wushuang took out was a normal picture scroll that did not seem unusual when seen with naked eyes.

The picture scroll was also slightly yellowish in color.

For such a kind of picture scroll, even if it were thrown onto the streets, no one would bend down and pick it up.

However, Jian Wushuang was certain that such a normal picture scroll was worth so much that countless experts would fight for it madly.

It was because of that fact that it was a Chaos Divine Treasure!

“Mountain River Map!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing brilliantly and he was looking at the ancient picture scroll which was floating in front of him.

The picture scroll was given to him by a Master. Moreover, it had also been with him for many years.

However, during those years, Jian Wushuang had only used the picture scroll once. That time, he had to rely on swallowing the blood that King Luo Zhen left behind forcefully to unleash the techniques of the picture scroll with difficulty. It was just that one time.

As for his Master Xuan Yi using the Mountain River Map to refine the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara later on, that was his Master’s technique and it was unrelated to him.

There was no choice. The picture scroll’s level was too high. Hence, Jian Wushuang absolutely did not have the right to use its power with his abilities.

He had never possessed the ability.

In other words, although he had an unbelievable treasure, he could only leave it lying in his Qian Kun Ring as he was unable to use it.

That had always been the case.

However, at that moment, it was different.

“The Mountain River Map is a valuable treasure that is at the level of a Chaos Divine Treasure. Under normal circumstances, only Almighties will be able to unleash the full power of a Chaos Divine Treasure. However, for the current me, I do not need to unleash its full power. It will be enough as long as I am able to unleash a portion of its power!” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly.
