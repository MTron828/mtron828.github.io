Chapter 2825: In Front of the Battle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

Many experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World were staring at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s prestige in the Pill Sun Sacred World was too high. Many people knew that the reason why Crimson Rock Castle was able to win the previous battles and regain control of the Pill Sun Sacred World was mainly because of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had created one miracle after another in the Pill Sun Sacred World.

Now that both sides were at such a huge disadvantage, these people also hoped that Jian Wushuang could create another miracle.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile. “I have indeed prepared some methods for this battle. If they are used well and everyone works together, they should be able to contend with the experts of the Heavenly Void Temple in front of them. They might even have a good chance of winning. As for what these methods are, I won’t say for now.. I will use them when the time comes.”

Hearing this, the surrounding people nodded heavily. At the same time, they felt more confident.

If Jian Wushuang did not prepare any tricks, they would not be able to fight against him with their current strength. However, since Jian Wushuang had prepared in advance and was facing all kinds of legends about Jian Wushuang… they had some confidence in their hearts.

However, Yin Su’er and Yun Shan looked at each other in dismay.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They did not think that Jian Wushuang really had trump cards.

Instead, they thought that Jian Wushuang was pretending to be calm so that the morale of their camp would not completely collapse.

In the opposite camp, in the Heavenly Void Army.

The sergeants of the Heavenly Void Army all looked cold and solemn. At the front, many Great Divine Masters of the Heavenly Void Palace gathered together. The leader was a burly man in dark green armor.

This burly man was the commander of the Heavenly Void Army.

As the commander of the Heavenly Void Army, although he was only a Peak Great Divine Master, his position in the Heavenly Void Palace was not inferior to that of the Marquis of Three Yin, who was an Invincible Divine Master.

Behind this commander of the Heavenly Void Army, there were a few silver-armored men standing there. These people were the ‘generals’ of the Heavenly Void Army.

At this moment, many experts of the Heavenly Void Temple were also looking at the scene in front of them with interest.

“It seems that the Pill Sun Sacred World has really declined. They were given so much time to prepare, yet this Crimson Rock Castle only managed to gather so few experts. There are less than seventy Great Divine Masters?” A general could not help but snicker.

The people beside them also revealed looks of disdain.

After all, this was a world. Logically speaking, it should be easy to casually bring out more than a hundred Great Divine Masters. However, the Crimson Rock Castle had so much time to prepare, yet they only managed to gather less than seventy Great Divine Masters. This number… was indeed a little too few.

It was very normal for the people from the Heavenly Void Temple to look down on them.

One had to know that in the Heavenly Void World, the Heavenly Void Temple Master’s words carried weight. He did not need to prepare much. With just a word of instruction, he had mobilized far more Great Divine Masters than the Pill Sun Sacred World.

“The Pill Sun Sacred World, when Sage Redstone was still alive, was worthy of our Heavenly Void World’s attention. But now… it’s too weak!”

“This time, I thought that we would have a tough battle with the Pill Sun Sacred World. But now, it seems like we don’t have the chance.”

“Just based on the experts gathered in the Pill Sun Sacred World, our heavenly void Army only needs to charge forward, and these experts of the Sacred Pill Sun World will be defeated!”

Many experts of the Heavenly Void Temple were chatting casually. Not many people took these experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World seriously.

Only the commander of the Heavenly Void Army had an incomparably cold expression. “Although the battle strength of the Pill Sun Sacred World’s camp can not compare to ours, their strength is still not weak. Not only do we have to defeat them, but we also have to strive for the least casualties.”

“Marquis of Three Yin.” The commander of the Heavenly Void Army suddenly looked at the Marquis of Three Yin who was standing quietly at the side.

The Marquis of three Yin’s position in the Heavenly Void Palace was extremely high, second only to the Master of the Heavenly Void Palace.

However, the commander of the Heavenly Void Army was also the right-hand man of the Master of the Heavenly Void Palace. The two of them could talk to each other as equals.

“What’s the matter?” The Marquis of Three Yin swept his gaze over.

“I heard that you fought with the strongest expert of the Pill Sun Sacred World before and you had the absolute advantage?” The commander of the Heavenly Void Army asked.

“That’s true.” The Marquis of Three Yin nodded.

“That’s good. I need you to come out now and fight with the strongest expert of the Pill Sun Sacred World in front of the experts from both sides.” The commander of the Heavenly Void Army said.

“Fight again? Are you trying to…” The Marquis of Three Yin frowned. He had already guessed the intentions of the commander of the Heavenly Void Army.

“That’s right. I want to weaken the morale of the Pill Sun Sacred World camp.” The Heavenly Void Army commander said, “I’ve heard of the strongest person in the Pill Sun Sacred World before. He seems to be called Sword One, and he’s only a senior great divine venerate. However, his prestige in the Pill Sun Sacred World is extremely high. Previously, the Pill Sun Sacred World had endless internal strife. It was because of his help that Yin Su’er was able to turn the tides.”

“Right now, once the Great War between our Heavenly Oasis World and the Pill Sun Sacred World breaks out, even if the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World are no match for him, they will most likely fight to the end with all their might. This is because most of them will believe that this sword will once again turn the tide of the battle. Even if this sword one doesn’t have the strength, as long as he opens his mouth and casually says something, such as saying that he still has some trump cards that he has yet to use, the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World will most likely believe him. At that time, when they start fighting madly, it will be quite troublesome for us.”

“That’s why I asked you to attack now and kill Sword One directly in front of the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World, or even severely injure him. No matter what, you just need to defeat him or suppress him.”

“As long as the people of the Pill Sun Sacred World see their strongest expert showing signs of defeat, their morale will plummet. They won’t be too crazy to resist, and it will save us a lot of trouble.”

“I understand.” The Marquis of Three Yin nodded slightly. He also knew the intention of this Heavenly Void Army commander.

The Marquis of Three Yin did not hesitate too much and immediately moved forward.

The Marquis of Three Yin crossed a distance and stopped in the middle of the two camps. His cold eyes looked at the many experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World.

“Sword One!”

His magnificent voice spread across the entire ice field.

In the Pill Sun Sacred World, the experts immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was strange. He immediately walked forward.

“Marquis of Three Yin, what do you want to do?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

“Nothing. It’s just that the last time I fought in your Sword Alliance’s headquarters, I didn’t have a good time. Now that I see it again, I can’t help but want to fight with you again,” The Marquis of Three Yin said with a faint smile.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank.
