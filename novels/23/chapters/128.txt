Chapter 129: Back to Tianyan Province

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It has been three years since I left Sword Marquis Mansion. I should go back.”Making up his mind, Jian Wushuang went straight toward Tianyan Province.

On the way, he also began to delve into the Selfless Sword Technique.

The Selfless Sword Technique the robust man gave him only had the first half of the volume. It had a total of six sword skills.

Jian Wushuang was attracted to this volume after reading its introduction.

The Selfless Sword Technique was different from all other sword skills Jian Wushuang had ever studied.

Like Formless Sword Arts, Formless Sword Wave, Sword Skill of Blood and Fire, and Reincarnation Sword Skill. All those sword skills were only for one sword essence.

The Formless Sword Arts targetted the Sword Essence of Gale, while the Formless Sword Wave targetted the Sword Essence of Earth.

But the Selfless Sword Technique targetted four Sword Essences, not just one.

No matter which Sword Essence you comprehended, you could study and delve into the Selfless Sword Technique. Furthermore, the Selfless Sword Technique was even more suitable for warriors who had combined different sword essences.

The power of the six sword skills depended on the comprehension level of sword essence.

Jian Wushuang had now perfectly combined the Sword Essences of Gale and Raging Fire. What he needed, was a sword skill which could execute two sword essences at the same time. The Selfless Sword Technique was more or less suitable.

Jian Wushuang immediately began to delve into the first move of the Selfless Sword Technique.

The first move was called Idealistic Form.

Two days later, on his way through the Dark Forest, Jian Wushuang took out his Triple-kill Sword.

“Idealism. Solipsism...”

Jian Wushuang murmured in a deep thought. The Triple-kill Sword flew out like a streak of light and pounded on a strong tree. The sword shadow, that combined both Sword Essences of Gale and Raging Fire, exploded.

BANG!

The trunk of the entire tree was directly pierced and a circular hole with a diameter of more than 20 centimeters appeared. The center of the entire tree was completely hollowed out.

Seeing this scene, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lightened.

“This is Idealistic Form, Its power is very strong.”?Jian Wushuang thought,?“I only combine two Sword Essences, forming the Fiery WindSword Essence. Its power would be?even?more terrifying if I could combine three or four Sword Essences.”

Jian Wushuang was also very excited.

The experience in the Ancestor’s Land benefited him a lot.

The first was his cultivation. Although he focused his mind and body on delving into sword essences over those two years, leaving little time for cultivation, his spiritual power still increased faster than ordinary warriors simply because of the Heavenly Creation Skill.

Now, he had already broken through from the Initial Gold Core and reached the Profound Gold Core Realm.

Actually, his Supreme Golden Core was a hundred times stronger than an expert at the same level.

When he was in the Initial Gold Core Realm, the strength he could release was stronger than normal warriors in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Now, after reaching the Profound Gold Core Realm, his strength would be matchless among the warriors in the Gold Core realm when he released his full power.

And his progress in Sword Essence was even greater!

His comprehension in all four Sword Essences had advanced by leaps and bounds. The Sword Essences of Gale and Raging Fire had even been combined perfectly.

Now, he had also had the Selfless Sword Technique... His strength as a whole was much stronger than it was two years ago.

A few days later, Jian Wushuang walked out of the Dark Forest, and what appeared in front of him was the Tianyan Province that he was quite familiar with.

“Tianyan Province. Bashui Commandery. I am back!”

...

It was still bustling in the Bashui Commandery.

While wearing a black robe and a bamboo hat, Jian Wushuang appeared in a restaurant. Near the window on the second floor of the restaurant, having ordered a pot of wine, he drank alone with his eyes focused on the huge mansion outside of the window.

It was also bustling in the mansion, and Jian Wushuang could even see some disciples of the Marquis’s mansion practicing sword skills on the drill ground.

“It is the same as before,”?Jian Wushuang secretly thought.

Sword Marquis Mansion!

His roots!

He lived there for a full sixteen years.

“Three years ago, Sword Marquis Mansion was greatly troubled because of me. Four elders also died because of me. I don’t even know the current state of the Sword Pavilion.” Jian Wushuang was anxious.

In the Sword Pavilion, his father had worked hard for a long time. When he was young, his aim was to inherit the position of Sword Pavilion Master.

Who could have expected that an incident would occur when he was taking pains to accomplish his goal!

After that incident, he, the future Sword Pavilion Master, had to leave the Tianyan Province, and the Four Great Elders of the Sword Pavilion were all killed. It can be said that the backbone of the Sword Pavilion was gone overnight. Therefore, Jian Wushuang was very anxious about the current state of the Sword Pavilion.

But at this moment…

Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!

Heavy footsteps were heard from the outside streets, and the whole street shook slightly. People in the middle of the street scattered. Jian Wushuang looked through the window to the source of the footsteps.

What he saw were three large Wildebeests slowly coming from the end of the street.

Wildebeests were generally a spirit beast in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Their strength was normal. But they were gentle and relatively easy to tame, and their speed was amazingly fast. Therefore, some big forces would tame a few Wildebeests for riding.

On the three Wildebeests, there were three figures. Two men and a woman.

Jian Wushuang could not help but tilt his lips when he saw the woman on the middle Wildebeest.

“Jian Meng’er!” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

This was beyond his expectations. The first disciple of the Marquis’s mansion he met after coming back was Jian Meng’er, who had tangled with him before.

“Profound Gold Core Realm? Not bad.” Jian Wushuang was smiling.

He could see that the aura of Spiritual Power from Jian Meng’er had reached the Profound Gold Core Realm.

It must be noted that Jian Meng’er’s age was the same as his. He was only 19 years old this year.

A 19-year-old warrior at the Profound Gold Core Realm was already very marvelous.

“When she was defeated by me three years ago, she went to the Tianyuan Sword Sect to practice with her Great Master. According to speculation, within three years, she was not allowed to leave the Tianyuan Sword Sect. She also came back today? What a coincidence!” Jian Wushuang’s expression became odd.

Under his watch, Jian Meng’er and the other two people on the wildebeests entered Sword Marquis Mansion.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang heard the comments from the people around him.

“Is the girl on the Wildebeest Jian Meng’er, the exceptional genius from Sword Marquis Mansion?”

“Yes, It’s her. It is said that she went to the Tianyuan Sword Sect to practice after being defeated by Jian Wushuang three years ago. She had never shown up since then. Now she finally returns after three years.”

“It’s normal to come back. After all, the situation Sword Marquis Mansion is terrible. If she doesn’t come back, Sword Marquis Mansion will disappear.”

Several warriors were talking about it. Although their voice was lowered, Jian Wushuang could still clearly hear what they said.

“Sword Marquis Mansion will disappear if Jian Meng’er didn’t return?”?Jian Wushuang sightly narrowed his eyes and in his dark pupil as a streak of cold light flashed.
