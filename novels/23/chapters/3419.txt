Chapter 3420 The Youth Zhao Mang

“I was indeed born with no meridians. From the moment I was born, I was just like that little fellow beneath my feet. I was unable to condense divine power at all, so naturally, I was unable to truly become a cultivator. Because of this, my parents tried everything for me, but unfortunately, they were unable to improve. Later on, as I grew older and older, I also knew that the most important thing in this world was strength.

“Without power, I’m nothing. Even though I know I can’t gather divine power, I still try my best to cultivate. If I can’t cultivate divine power, then I’ll refine my body. I’ve worked so hard just to change everything one day…”

Demon Master Chenhuo’s face became misty.

Apparently, when he was young, he suffered a lot because of his naturally terminated meridians.

Otherwise, the fact that the Demon Master Chenhuo could dominate the Divine Beginning Realm meant that his situation had changed.

Pausing for a while…the Demon Master Chenhuo continued, “No matter who it is, as long as they are willing to persevere and work hard, they will be rewarded. My hard work has indeed been rewarded. Or perhaps, I was lucky enough to meet my master!

“My master was already one of the elders of the Amethyst Demon Sect at that time. He was also a Principles Master of the three void realms. He saw me and saw my naturally terminated meridians at a glance. Perhaps because of my hard work, he personally accepted me as his personal disciple and spent a great price to reconstruct my meridians. He also took me to the Amethyst Demon Sect. From then on, my fate changed dramatically.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang understood.

It was no wonder that Demon Master Chenhuo was so loyal to the Amethyst Demon Sect and his master. It turned out that his fate had changed only when he met his master.

If he had not met his master, he would not have achieved so much in the future.

“This little guy in front of me is also born with terminated meridians. Like me, he knew that he could not condense divine power, but he still refused to admit defeat and tried his best to temper his body. I see him now as if I saw myself in the past.” Demon Master Chenhuo kept staring at the young man below, his eyes were filled with melancholy.

“Hmm? This young man seems to be planning to go back,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

He had noticed that the young man who was carrying a giant rock and running between the mountains below had put down the giant rock on his body and was walking toward the nearby city.

“It seems that he lives in the city. He just went to this secluded place outside the city to cultivate,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “Chenhuo, since you said that he is the same as you were when you were young and he is going to Wu Xin City, why don’t you and I follow him?”

After a moment of hesitation, Demon Master Chenhuo nodded slightly and said, “Okay.”

Both of them set off, but they slowed down and followed the young man to the giant city.

They watched the young man enter the city and soon entered a huge courtyard.

“This courtyard seems to belong to a family. It seems that this little guy is a family disciple,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“It’s fine if he is the son of an ordinary cultivator. Even if he has naturally terminated meridians, it has nothing to do with other people. But a family disciple…the competition within the family is very fierce. This little guy doesn’t even have a trace of divine power. He must have suffered a lot growing up in this family environment,” Demon Master Chenhuo said with a frown.

“There’s a tavern across the street from this family. Let’s go there for a drink and ask about this little guy.” Jian Wushuang smiled and headed straight for the tavern.

When they arrived at the tavern, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo sat by the window. Through the window, they could see the huge courtyard across the street.

“My Lords, what can I do for you?” A black-clothed attendant appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo.

Jian Wushuang casually waved his hand and took out an interspatial ring. The interspatial ring did not recognize its owner. The black-clothed attendant scanned it with his consciousness and immediately sensed the dense accumulation of saint elixirs. There were at least 100,000 saint elixirs!

“I want to ask you some questions. Answer honestly. If I’m satisfied, the interspatial ring will be yours,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Please ask, my Lord. I’ll tell you everything I know.” The black-clothed attendant’s eyes were burning with passion.

He was just a waiter in the tavern. Although he had just reached the level of the immortal saint, he was at the bottom of the immortal saint ranks. 100,000 saint elixirs was already a huge fortune for him, of course, he would cherish the opportunity in front of him.

“Let me ask you, where is the huge courtyard across the street?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sir, that is the mansion of the Zhao family, one of the five families in the Wu Xin City. Although the Zhao family is not a big family in the Bone Flood Domain, the Wu Xin City is one of the most prosperous cities in the Bone Flood Domain. To be able to occupy a place in the Wu Xin City, the Zhao family’s heritage is not weak. There are rumors that the Zhao family once had a Peak Saint, but I don’t know if they still have one now,” the black-clothed waiter said truthfully.

“Do you know of a young man in the Zhao family who is unable to condense divine power?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, I know of him. Zhao Mang, the third young master of the Zhao family, is a good-for-nothing young master in the Wu Xin City. He is quite famous in the Wu Xin City,” the black-clothed attendant said with a smile.

“It is said that Zhao Mang has been unable to absorb spiritual Qi and condense divine power since he was born. He is already 16 years old, but he is still unable to become a cultivator. Many people in the Wu Xin City regard him as a joke.” “Even his father, the current patriarch of the Zhao family, has always regarded Zhao Mang as a disgrace. His two brothers have long drawn a line between them and have no contact with him. If it weren’t for the fact that he is more or less of the bloodline of the Zhao family and that his sister, the fourth young miss of the Zhao family, has been protecting him, Zhao Mang would have been expelled from the Zhao family.”

“Even his father and elder brother regard him as a disgrace?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“This is a family. In such a competitive environment like the Third Heaven, these people no longer have any kinship in their eyes, only strength and self-interest.” Demon Master Chenhuo’s face was cold. “However, there is still his sister in the Zhao family who stands up for him. It can’t be considered a complete betrayal.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Indeed, at least one person is sincere for his good.” Jian Wushuang also smiled.
