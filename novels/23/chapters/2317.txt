“Therefore, you two can just sit tight and wait for your deaths obediently!”

Her cold voice reverberated in the air. Just as she finished her words, the red-haired old lady pointed the dragon head truncheon towards Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi. Despite being at a distance, a dense stream of devilish aura gushed out from the dragon head truncheon.

The devilish aura filled the atmosphere and morphed into a giant demonic dragon in the blink of an eye.

The demonic dragon was entirely black and emanated a frightening aura. It let out a deafening roar before rushing towards Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi.

Before the demonic dragon approached, a stifling pressure swept across Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi.

Jian Wushuang was unmoved. He had seen too many Half Step Divine Demons in his previous lifetime. Now that he was facing one again, he was still as calm as ever despite not recovering fully.

However, Lin Yi wasn’t able to be as composed as Jian Wushuang.

“Damn it!”

Lin Yi cursed. Before the demon reached him, he drew the sword from his back.

Powerful sword essence erupted into the sky. Since he had reached the minimum threshold of Sword Principle, Lin Yi’s sword essence was clearly way stronger than before.

Lin Yi took a big step forward and swung his sword decisively.

Just like a streak of sword light that was about to split the heavens.

The strike was blurry but had unwavering dominance. In the next instant, he struck the head of the giant demonic dragon. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Demonic mist tumbled around the demonic dragon. Despite having a powerful aura, it was split into two by the sword light and dissipated into the atmosphere.

“Huh? The red-haired old lady with the dragon head truncheon was astonished and turned to the other four Chaotic Realms. “Didn’t your Zhuge Family say the one escorting the lad was an ordinary Peak Chaotic Realm? Yet, he sliced my demonic dragon in a single strike. His strength is probably not any weaker than a Half Step Divine Demon’s!”

“This...” The four Chaotic Realm experts couldn’t answer at that moment.

From the intelligence gathered by the Zhuge Family, Lin Yi was indeed an ordinary Peak Chaotic Realm. Although his Sword Principle was pretty good, it wasn’t too extraordinary.

However, just like the red-haired old lady had said, he was really strong.

“It looks like our Zhuge Family’s intelligence was erroneous. Although Lin Yi was much stronger than we expected, he shouldn’t be beyond the range Your Honor could handle, right?” one of them asked.

“Yeah, I can still handle him, but the difficulty is a lot higher. The promised remuneration has to increase by 30%,” said the red-haired old lady.

“30%?” The four Chaotic Realm experts turned solemn. However, after communicating with their consciousness, they nodded their heads in unison. “As long as Your Honor is willing to stick to your end of the deal, 30% should be acceptable.”

“Alright. Leave Lin Yi to me. However, you guys will have to finish off Jian Wushuang personally,” the red-haired old lady said.

“Not a problem,” the four Chaotic Realm experts agreed decisively.

They only found Lin Yi to be a slight issue. As for Jian Wushuang, a mere Pure Sun Realm wasn’t something that would bother them.

Once they had reached an agreement, the red-haired old lady made the first move.

“You are Lin Yi? To be able to slice my demonic dragon in a single strike, you are pretty strong. However, even if you can slice one, can you deal with five?” the red-haired old lady stared at Lin Yi. Divine power surged from her and an intense devilish aura gathered. Soon, five demonic dragons had formed.

“Shit!”

Lin Yi was flabbergasted.

His all-out strike could destroy a demonic dragon. However, he had to deal with five at the same time now!

Lin Yi was plunged into exceptional danger instantly.

“Pal, run away now!!!”

Lin Yi shouted. Sword essence surged as he charged towards the five demonic dragons.

Powerful sword light flickered as Lin Yi tackled the five demonic dragons.

However, it was clear that Lin Yi was in an absolutely disadvantageous position. He would be able to barely keep himself alive and couldn’t possibly care for Jian Wushuang at this juncture.

He only hoped Jian Wushuang would be fortunate to escape from this.

What he had never expected was that Jian Wushuang wouldn’t attempt to flee at all.

When he heard Lin Yi shouted, Jian Wushuang remained rooted to the ground.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The four Chaotic Realm experts from the Zhuge Family had already surrounded him.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang remained unmoved, they scoffed.

“Hehe! Brat, are you so afraid that you have become dumb? Lin Yi ordered you to flee immediately, and yet you choose to remain behind?”

Although you have frightening talents, you are still too young and haven’t been through many ordeals. In a life and death situation, you have became paralyzed in fear.”

“It’s good that way. You will have a quicker death and won’t suffer as much.”

The four Chaotic Realm experts chatted casually and weren’t concerned by Jian Wushuang at all.

However, what they didn’t notice was when they were mocking Jian Wushuang, contempt was gleaming in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“That Half Step Divine Demon expert is held up by Uncle Lin Yi. There isn’t even a Peak Chaotic Realm among the four of them!” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He wasn’t silly and he wasn’t paralyzed in fear.

In his previous lifetime, he had been through numerous setbacks. In the most pressing danger, he could still remain calm while searching for a glimmer of hope.

His current encounter wouldn’t even have been considered a small wave.

The reason why he didn’t heed Lin Yi’s advice to flee at the first instance was because... Only four Chaotic Realms weren’t qualified to make him flee.

In the air, Jian Wushuang stood peacefully. He flipped his palm and a red sword appeared in his hand.

The sword was four feet long and didn’t have a sheath. The red body made it look as though it was submerged in fresh blood.

When it appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand, it instantly attracted the attention of the four Chaotic Realms.

“This is...”

They stared at the sword.

At first glance, the long sword looked ordinary. However, it seemed to have been to hell and back. Corpses were scattered everywhere and the sea of blood was vast and boundless.

“Great sword!”

“That’s definitely a terrestrial treasure. Moreover, it’s a peak terrestrial treasure or even a heavenly treasure!”

Without a doubt, this was a stunning killing sword.

This sword was none other than the... Blood Mountain Sword! The sword that had descended from the sky when Jian Wushuang was born!
