“Second Master!”

“No!”

Seeing Xia Yan’s death, both the two guards turned pale with fright.

After they saw the sword light flash towards them under Jian Wushuang’s control, their fright plateaued.

Just two guards with no lifesaving item like Xia Yan.

The sword light still looked powerful after crumbling the bronze palm and killing Xia Yan.

The power behind it diminished by one-tenth, but, it was the power of a Dao Master, which the two guards, as two Eternal Realm experts, could never withstand all the same.

“Damn!”

“We’re finished!”

The sword light stabbed the two guards at an amazing speed and pierced through their bodies one after the other, destroying their Life Cores.

After that, the sword light finally disappeared in the air.

Above the sea, with a wave of his hand, Jian Wushuang swiped the three dead men’s treasures and Interspatial Rings and shattered their bodies.

He sighed in relief after finishing and observed the token in his hand.

“Master said the first streak of Sword Essence was the weakest one among the three in this token.”?He narrowed his eyes while recalling Xuan Yi’s words.

The Sword Essence he wielded mimicked the first streak, however, it still crumbled Xia Yan’s bronze palm, behind which was the power of a Dao Master too. Obviously, the palm proved no match for his Sword Essence.

“With the first streak of Sword Essence being so powerful, what about the other two streaks of Sword Essence? How powerful can they be?

“The Sunrise Sword Emperor, who crafted those Sword Essences, how powerful could he be?”

Jian Wushuang wandered in those thoughts for a moment. Shaking his head, he stopped mulling over it and looked around while murmuring to himself, “I’d better leave this place now.”

He set off at once.

An hour later after he left, an old figure appeared at this void.

He none other than Elder He, the great Dao Master of the Xia Clan.

He had a grave expression when he appeared. With chilling eyes, he scanned around and sensed the Restriction Xia Yan set and some remaining energy of the fight.

“Yes, right here, Second Master caught up with Jian Wushuang and battled him.

“He was less powerful than Jian Wushuang, but the two guards with him were the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm experts. Besides, he also had a lifesaving item that master gave him. It should have been easy for him to kill Jian Wushuang, however, he was the who perished.”

You’re reading on Thanks!

The elder stroked his chin and pondered quietly.

The Core Disciples of Xia Clan all had an object attached to their life in the clan, therefore, the moment Xia Yan died, the clan knew it. Soon, Elder He realized it and rushed to the void where Xia Yan died.

“Could it be Jian Wushuang killed Second Master?”

“But Jian Wushuang is just a Divine Realm expert without any background, how could he kill Second Master and his two guards? Besides, Master said that he sensed Second Master use that copper sheet. So why did Second Master die all the same?”

The elder frowned hard while trying to deduce the heart of the matter. Right then, he spotted a faint streak of Sword Essence gleaming in the air.

“This Sword Essence is so powerful!

“It’s the king of the sword! Invincible!

“Even though most of its power dissipated, it is still sharp and fierce. The person who created it must be extremely formidable.”

“In the Eternal World, no more than five people can create such a powerful Sword Essence!

“Who exactly is this person?”

A chilling light flashed n the elder’s eyes.?“No matter who you are, I won’t let you escape!”

Above the vast sea, Jian Wushuang marched forward without delay, long sword straddled across his back.

Having been far away from where he battled Xia Yan and sure that the Xia Clansmen could not catch up, he finally rested on an uninhabited island.

“The Xia Clan will be furious when they learn of Xia Yan’s death,”?he thought to himself.

Being the son of the Master of the Xia Clan and the brother of the number one exceptional genius, as well as the youngest Eternal Realm expert in the Eternal World, Xia Yan attained a high status in his clan.

In no way would the clan?not?be enraged by his death.

That was to say, Jian Wushuang offended the clan incredibly this time.

He had to?kill Xia Yan at that time, otherwise, it would have been him.

He might be a negligible man to the Xia Clan, but even a rabbit would bite if cornered.

Since Xia Yan had wished to kill him, no matter how eminent this man was, he dared to fight back.

This was what kind of a person Jian Wushuang was!

“Since there is a grudge between Xia Yan and me, the clan must have known that he had ventured out to kill me. When they discover his death, they will conclude that I’m the murderer. As it’s too easy for them to trace my background, master and the Ancient Sect may be involved in this matter.”?Jian Wushuang pondered with a curled lower lip.

“I have to inform Master of this in advance, buying him some time to prepare for it.”

Having made up his mind, Jian Wushuang connected with Xuan Yi, informing him of the whole thing.

Xuan Yi remained cool after hearing Jian Wushuang’s words.

He responded quickly to him, “I figured as much. Don’t worry, no harm will befall on sect. But you should still be careful. And don’t get yourself killed by the Xia Clan.”

Having received his master’s reply, Jian Wushuang sighed in great relief.

He did not worry about himself. What concerned him more was that Xuan Yi and the Ancient Sect would be dragged into this matter.

After getting the reassuring response from his master, the burden weighing his heart lifted.

“Master is mighty. Besides, Senior Brother is?now one of the 18 masters of the Void Temple. Given this, the Xia Clan will reconsider before they strike the Ancient Sect.

“I weep at my own weakness!”

“Powerful enough to frighten the Xia Clan, they dare not mutter even a single word against me for killing a scum like Xia Yan.”

For a while, Jian Wushuang’s complex feelings overwhelmed him, but he shook his head and ceased his pondering. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“By the way, as the second master of the Xia Clan, Xia Clan must be rich and have many treasures. Let me see if any of them can be of any use.”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang?quickly pulled out Xia Yan’s Interspatial Ring.

He searched it meticulously.
