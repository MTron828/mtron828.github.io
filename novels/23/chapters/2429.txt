Chapter 2430: The Frenzy Began

Crimson Stone Saint flipped his hand in the hidden space, and a white-colored token suddenly appeared.

He mysteriously smiled while looking at the white token.

“It’s about time, let’s begin.”

The first position token... Kid, we’ll see how you fare.”

Crimson Stone Saint swung his hand as he exclaimed, turning the white token into a flash before it vanished.

Gong!

The giant structure of the Saint’s Tomb shook. The tremors were very violent as if the grounds were shattering and mountains moving.

The sudden changes startled those genius disciples in the inner area.

“Is it starting?”

Many disciples’ eyes were burning with enthusiasm.

Meanwhile, in the area where Jian Wushuang was located...

Narcissus Island, Ancient Star Temple, Great Compassion Sect led by Pang Tao, and disciples from many other sects were gathered there and waited calmly.

Jian Wushuang immediately stood up with everyone when the Saint’s Tomb started trembling.

“It’s coming.”

“I wonder where the first position token will appear.”

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong felt fanatically excited. All of them were truly looking forward to it.

Right then...

A roaring rumble tore through the air. The ground suddenly broke open in the area where Jian Wushuang and his companions were, shooting up a blinding white light beam from below.

In the blink of an eye, the white light moved into the middle of the void and appeared in front of all those disciples.

The genius disciples on the scene were all stunned.

“That’s...”

“A position token?”

“The first position token!”

A number of them could not recover from the amazement.

One should know that the inner area was extremely large, and the place those six position tokens would appear was random. Those genius disciples from various sects could only rely on their own luck. Obviously, none of those disciples expected such good fortune to have the first position token appearing in their local area.

It was a short surprise which became chaotic the next moment.

“Do it!”

“Grab it, quick!”

“The token is mine!”

Shouts suddenly filled the air. The total number of genius disciples was around a hundred and in that instant, other than a small number of Second-Class Divine Demons, most disciples dashed towards the floating white token in the void.

For example, Pang Tao from the Great Compassion Sect did not miss a beat, taking the lead with two First-Class and seven Second-Class Divine Demons from his sect following right behind him.

Pang Tao’s face was stern as he had set his mind in seizing the white token.

“Little Brother, stay far away and don’t get involved in the battle.”

After Zhuo Bing advised Jian Wushuang, she turned to her companions. “Everyone, let’s do this!”

“Right.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Move!”

Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, Su Tong along with the more capable Second-Class Divine Demon disciples from Narcissus Island and Ancient Star Temple sprung into action.

Lines of figures charged rapidly towards the white token.

As for Jian Wushuang, he did not take action at this first moment. He stood there at the same place and observed calmly instead.

The fight had begun.

“Haha, it’s mine. The first token is mine!”

A young man in an elegant sky-blue long robe laughed maniacally. He was a Second-Class Divine Demon that was physically the closest to the white token, hence he was the first to arrive and naturally held the white token in his hand.

However, as soon as he caught the token and was about to keep it in his Interspatial Ring...

“Watch out!” Somebody suddenly shouted.

The warning came from a First-Class Divine Demon who was also from the same sect as the young man.

The young man’s face changed but he could not react in time as a strange scarlet light beam went through his body and instantly ended his life.

A petite young lady in red with a frosty expression was right next to the young man and the strange scarlet light was actually her cold-looking spear which was currently floating in front of her. She immediately reached out to grab the white token upon killing the young man.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three fatal attacks were directed right at her.

Two of those attacks were sent by two Second-Class Divine Demons. However, the third stroke was released by a First-Class Divine Demon.

“Damn!”

The young lady in red clenched her teeth forcibly halted her steps and dashed sideways at the same time to avoid those attacks.

A ghastly dark figure appeared next to the young man’s body and extended his large hand to take the young man’s Interspatial Ring and white token.

Gong!

A giant mountain appeared out of nowhere above the darkly-clad figure, and more than ten attacks were sent out from around him at the same time.

“No!”

The darkly-clad figure got stunned. Although he was quite a capable First-Class Divine Demon, it was just too difficult facing so many attacks from every direction.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Noises of impacts were heard. The darkly-clad figure gave his all but still could not ward off all the attacks. Finally, his body suddenly collapsed after getting hit by a few attacks.

Thus ended the life of a First-Class Divine Demon!

Just in such a short time, two Divine Demons—a Second-Class and a First-Class—respectively died under a crowd of attacks.

However, that was only the beginning. Following that...

“Kill! Kill!”

“I’ll kill whoever seizes the token!”

“The position token is mine. Anybody who dares to take it will receive no mercy!”

Manically shouts filled the edge of the skies.

The competition started as soon as the position token appeared, and so were the killings.

“This is pretty crazy.”

Jian Wushuang stood idly at the edge of the battlefield and observed everything that was happening.

Those sect geniuses could still coexist peacefully, not only in the outer area but also in the inner area when trying out the challenges on the Bridge of Trials. However, they started their bloody fights as soon as the position token appeared. This only showed the importance of the position token and the strong desires of all disciples from every sect over the Fengtian Scroll.

However, due to the extremely crazy competition, more than ten disciples fell shortly after the battle started, and one of them was even a First-Class Divine Demon.

After all, First-Class Divine Demons usually had a safety token and would break it as soon as they encountered a crisis.

Up to that point, nobody had the chance to store the white token into their Interspatial Ring. As soon as someone got close to the white token, people around would issue coordinated attacks and kill them on the spot. Hence, the white token was still floating midair and illuminating its white light, stirring greed in all of the disciples there.

In such a frenzied competition, even First-Class Divine Demons who were extremely capable did not dare to be reckless.
