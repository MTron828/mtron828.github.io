4638 The Great Catastrophe Begins!

Divine power poured out into the void.

With Jian Wushuang as the leader, five million top cultivators gathered in the crack and finished the battle in one go!

Stepping on the outermost part of the Offworld Battlefield, a similarly vast void energy permeated the air.

There were a total of ten columns, and at this moment, nearly eight of them had fallen. The remaining ten ordinary Supreme experts were desperately running back, and behind them, nearly 100 Scar level Void Masters, who were acting as scouts and vanguards, were chasing after them.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold and he struck down with his palm.

Suddenly, the void was raised and a huge palm print directly killed Void Masters!

All the cultivators were shocked. Even a Half Ancestor could not kill hundreds of void Masters with one palm.

Great Void Divine Emperor and Golden Crow Emperor looked at the black-robed figure with a complicated expression. In just a few tens of thousands of years, he had grown to an existence that they had to look up to.

After the void power had completely dissipated, the dozen or so Supreme Masters quickly ran to Jian Wushuang.

One of the slightly older Supreme experts panicked and said, “Palace Master Wushuang, things are bad. The void has cracked open, and they are attacking us from the crack!

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned. Then, he leaped forward quickly, followed by more than five million cultivators.

The void crack was located at the border between the Divine Power Universe and the Void Universe. In that mysterious area, both divine power and void power were weak.

When the army of the Divine Power Universe arrived at the border, all the cultivators gasped.

At the intersection of the barrier of cracks, a huge chasm had opened up on both sides. It was like a Heavenly Gate, and countless void power was escaping from it.

The army of Void Warriors gushed out of the crack like a black fog.

Those ‘old friends’ also appeared.

Void Mater Ba Huang, who was covered in black fog, led more than 200,000 scouts and cultivators to look at Jian Wushuang from a distance.

200,000 scouts meant that there were nearly 50,000 Scar level Void Masters. Their role was to act as a sharp knife and stab into the heart of the Divine Power Universe.

The two Half Ancestor Void Emissaries who had been killed by Jian Wushuang were now charging over with the army of Void Warriors.

Seeing his nemesis, Void Mater Ba Huang and the Two-In-One Void Emissary almost wanted to kill Jian Wushuang.

However, this was not the end. An endless stream of Void Warriors, seemingly connected to the sky, stepped out of the Void Universe.

A great pressure pressed down on every cultivator’s heart, but no one took a step back. They were silent and dead silent.

On the other side of Vopid God, another earth-shaking phantom image was formed.

As the black mist surged and fell, a majestic treasure figure wearing a black and gold robe and an Emperor’s crown appeared. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s eyes darkened. Devouring Emperor, who had shocked the entire universe in the Polar Sea Star Field, had come!

The appearance of the two Ancestor realm experts made all the cultivators feel despair.

Then, Devour One, who had six Arms of Laws behind him, arrived with six other members of the Devourers!

Three Ancestor realm experts!

Three unparalleled existences appeared in the camp of the Void Universe!

The heavens and earth changed, and even the void shattered when it first descended.

There was no place that could accommodate three Ancestor realm experts.

At that moment, even Jian Wushuang felt helpless.

Ancestor realm beings were beings that truly transcended the laws. Even Half Ancestor realm beings would find it difficult to cause them any harm.

Three Ancestor realm experts were too terrifying.

“Do you really want to destroy my Divine Power Universe?” At this moment, all the cultivators were disheartened.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang took the lead and released a vast amount of divine power. The unparalleled divine power soared along with the divine patterns and actually blocked the invading void power.

At the same time, Feng Qi of the Phoenix clan, Linhe Dragon Emperor of the Dragon clan, Supreme Xue Bo, and Xiang Qing and Xiang Huang — a total of seven Half Ancestors — released their divine forms at the same time.

The void was brilliant, and the divine power that belonged to the Divine Power Universe showed its tough side.

With a surge of monstrous divine power, the old man took a step forward, and an earth-shaking black water treasure form appeared behind him.

Strange and majestic energy instantly dispersed the void power.

All the cultivators looked at this scene in shock, and then their burning and blazing eyes rose again.

it turns out that our Divine Power Universe also has Ancestor realm existences!

White Ape’s eyes turned slightly red. At the same time, the divine power belonging to the peak of the Invincible Supreme realm surged.

Great Void Divine Emperor’s usual expression of joy and anger finally curved up the corners of his lips.

After seeing the old man’s figure, Devour One’s scarlet eyes narrowed, and everything he had experienced in the Polar Sea Star Field came back to him.

“Could it be that he was also abandoned there?”

There was no answer. Devour One’s opponent was not Old Master. He had locked onto Jian Wushuang before he stepped into the Offworld Battlefield.

The monster’s terrifying growth finally made Devour One and his organization feel that something was wrong. No matter what, Jian Wushuang had to die in today’s battle!

Ever since he escaped from Old Master, Void God had just recovered. The fear in his heart made him confront Old Master immediately.

Devouring Emperor, who was extremely mysterious and had been controlling the situation from behind the scenes, looked at Old Master with a strange expression.

For a time, all the power of the two universes was gathered in this cruel and damaged outer space border.

This was going to be the grandest battle since the chaos.

Whether it was the winning side or the losing side, they would have to pay a terrible price.

“If you surrender, I’ll let you all live. Otherwise, you’ll die here!”

Void God said in a voice that sounded like a giant bell. He was high up in the air and his aura was filled with evil energy.

However, no one in the Divine Power Universe replied. Everyone’s eyes were filled with the desire to die and they scoffed at Void God’s words.

Without skin, how can hair attach itself? When the Divine Power Universe completely fell, anyone would become the Void Universe’s plaything to be killed at will.

Jian Wushuang laughed loudly and his golden eyes were filled with disdain. “Such lowly behavior. All of you have worked tirelessly to occupy my Divine Power Universe for a trillion years. Everyone knows your evil heart. Now, you are persuading us to surrender before the battle between the two armies. You are indeed despicable!”

Jian Wushuang’s words were like knives that cut the entire Void Universe.

Void God’s face darkened, and he waved his hand to punish them.
