Chapter 927: You’re Still a Joke as a Dao Master!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The experts in the audience did not expect this battle to evolve into such a situation.

The original contest between the two groups in the Eternal Realm had now turned into a battle between Dao Masters.

Emperor Leng, who sat in the heart of the audience, threw a lavender Luminous Pearl into the air. The pearl cracked and subsequently formed an enormous layer of Restriction that enveloped a large area of the drill ground.

Only Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang were enveloped in the Restriction area.

“Now you can fight as hard as you can,” Emperor Leng said.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief.

He did not want that to hurt the audience again. With Emperor Leng’s layer of Restriction, he could use his skills without having to worry about the audience.

“Jian Wushuang,” Xia Mang called out in his cold voice.

Jian Wushuang looked over at him and their eyes met.

In the next second, they both disappeared.

“Bang!”

No one in the audience saw where Jian Wushuang or Xia Mang had gone. Following the loud roar, they saw a huge sword scar in the center of the drill ground. It was almost ten meters wide.

Before the audience could react, another explosion went off in the Void and formed a huge Black Hole. The residual power was swept around like a tornado.

Everything happened too swiftly.

Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang moved so quickly that the audience in the drill ground could not see what was happening.

They could only hear the violent explosions in the Void and see the cracks on the ground.

Only the experts in the audience got a clear look at the battle and what they saw amazed them.

They saw Xia Mang sending palm strokes flying in the Void without an end, creating a formidable force. Sometimes, it resembled the eruption of a volcano and other times, like the surge of the magnificent sea or the descent of a meteorite that threatened to destroy the world.

Xia Mang unleashed his Creation-Level Dao at its full strength.

This was the real battle strength of a top Rank One Dao Master.

However, Xia Mang’s strength surprisingly did not seem to work on Jian Wushuang.

In fact, Xia Mang had no advantage at all.

The top experts in the audience could see that Jian Wushuang was executing his swordsmanship at full strength, too. Each of his movement was unprecedentedly fast. Moreover, his sword contained the Destruction aura of the Scarlet Thunderbolt, which boosted the power and speed of his swordsmanship.

Jian Wushuang had such amazing swordsmanship. Besides, he was now a Gold-armored Ancient God who possessed the Star-river Secret Skill and the Level Two Divine Yin Thunder. This placed Jian Wushuang in a better situation than Xia Mang.

“Bang!”

There was another loud thump.

Then a giant portal appeared above the battlefield. This was a Black Hole formed by the collision of their power.

Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang separated again.

Xia Mang roared as he glared at Jian Wushuang. Then, his body was soon enveloped in a layer of bloody mist.

The bloody mist gathered and condensed behind him, soon forming five giant beasts.

These five beasts were strange and fierce. Not only were they tall, but their arms were thick and strong as well.

Xia Mang’s eyes had also turned scarlet.

“That’s… Five-fingered Palm!”

“He has such a Secret Skill.”

The top experts in the stand were surprised to see the fierce beasts behind Xia Mang.

The Five-fingered Palm was a creation of a very powerful top Dao Master of the Eternal World, on par with Emperor Leng and Emperor Xiao, a long time ago. It was a Secret Skill that was ranked in the top three of all palm skills.

The power of this Secret Skill could not be underestimated.

When Jian Wushuang saw the five fierce beasts, he knew that Xia Mang was about to perform his unique skill. He focused his energy on his Interspatial Ring, sending streaks of Flowing Lights shooting out of it. The Flowing Lights were sword shadows.

“Sword formation, condense!”

Jian Wushuang used his intention to command the numerous sword shadows to combine at an astonishing speed. Soon, they formed a lavender sword that was six meters long.

This sword was also formed out of 36 magic weapons. It was the first step to lay down the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

Though Jian Wushuang had been displaying the first step of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation earlier, the swords of the Formation were different. The swords he had previously used in the Formation were called Xue Tianluo while the ones he was using now were the One-meter swords. Each of them was worth one billion divine crystals.

There were now 36 of these one-meter Sword, one of which was already much more powerful than an ordinary Emperor Weapon. Its wielder was none other than Jian Wushuang, who was in the Eternal Realm…

“Go!”

The lavender sword turned into a purple Flowing Light, carrying the Divine Yin Thunder that rushed out so quickly that it seemed like they had never been in the Void.

Xia Mang snorted coldly. Behind him, the five fierce beasts bellowed.

“Five-fingered Palm! Cloud-covering Hand!”

The killing intent surged in Xia Mang’s eyes. He made a heavy slam with his right hand.

His palm cut through the Void without making any sound.

In the next moment, a giant palm print emerged from thin air. Then, as if the palm stroke had broken many layers of the space, there was one Black Hole after another in the Void. They all aimed straight for Jian Wushuang.

Just then, numerous lavender Flowing Lights fell down like meteorites and crushed the center of this giant palm.

“Kaboom!”

A loud crashing noise reverberated in the air and a large amount of power began to disperse into the surroundings.

The center of the giant palm broke open, leading to its collapse. The lavender Flowing Lights also rebounded from the crash and flew out toward the rear.

“Is this all you’ve got, Xia Mang?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“Hm?” Xia Mang looked up at him.

“I’ll repeat what I’ve previously said if this is the extent of your strength.”

Jian Wushuang’s words reverberated through the entire drill ground.

“You were a joke to me back when you were in the Eternal Realm!”

“Even now as a Dao Master, you’re still a joke!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Second Sword Formation, condense!”
