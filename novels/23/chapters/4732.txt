4734 The Battle Between Two Princes

In the vast Heavenly Realm, almost at the same time as the pillar of light rose, nearly 100 figures with great momentum swept across the wilderness.

…

“Congratulations to the fourth Prince for obtaining the Immortal Peach.”

A handsome young man in a white court robe stood on the peak of a mountain with a misty mountain. He was holding a glazed Immortal Peach in his hand, which seemed to contain a great opportunity.

Behind him stood close to 20 powerful Yan Immortals.

The handsome young man was Prince Qian, Prince Yan’s fourth brother.

The Immortal Peach was constantly emitting a weak aura. Relying on his five senses, he rushed to the continent at the center of the Heavenly Realm almost immediately. He cut open the divine mountain and obtained the Immortal Peach.

A smug expression appeared on his face. This was his first time obtaining an Immortal Peach.

In the previous Peach-snatching competitions, he had never been the leader. It had always been Prince Jiu.

However, this time, the winner would probably change.

The first person to obtain the Immortal Peach was almost certain of the outcome. In fact, they only needed to hide in the following period of time.

Apart from the planned encirclement, it would be too easy to pass seven days.

However, Prince Qian did not think that victory was already in his grasp. His brothers were not easy to deal with, and they were all extremely powerful in terms of strength and influence.

It had been almost 20 days. Other than his big brother who posed no threat, the other Yan Immortals who participated in the fight for the Peach were most likely divided into different camps.

Thinking of this, he reached out and took out a wisp of energy from the Immortal Peach and handed it to a Yan Immortal beside him.

“Take this aura and leave. Go as far as you can. Find Prince Yan along the way and try to make him the target of everyone.”

The middle-aged Yan Immortal understood tacitly and used a small technique, changing the energy in his hand into the shape of an Immortal Peach.

“Don’t worry, Fourth Prince. Leave the rest to us.”

Prince Qian nodded in satisfaction. The 20 Yan Immortals behind him split into two groups. One group followed him while the other escorted the fake Immortal Peaches away.

The Immortal clouds were vast, but he did not stop. He was about to leave with the 12 Yan Immortals.

At this moment, a terrifying sense of danger suddenly surged from behind him.

“Fourth Brother, where are you going in such a hurry?”

That slightly thin figure with a pair of dark eyes slowly walked out of the forest, alone.

However, when this one figure appeared, it made all the Yan Immortals feel like they were facing a great enemy.

Prince Qian’s pupils constricted as if he had seen the last thing he wanted to face.

In this fight for the Peach, other than Prince Jiu, there were two other people that he was most afraid of.

One of them was Prince Yu, and the other was the figure in front of them, his fifth brother, Prince Mo.

There was no other reason. It was rumored that the two of them had already comprehended their own Immortal styles.

Once one comprehended the Immortal style, even if it was just a trace, it meant that one had taken the step forward. When the opportunity came, one could completely advance to the next cultivation realm.

They had thought that they would only find out after at least two or three days, but they did not expect that the most troublesome guy would come after them in less than half a day.

Prince Qian smiled stiffly. “Oh, so it’s you, Fifth Brother. Why? Did you detect the aura of the Immortal Peach? Where is it?”

Prince Mo, who was all alone, obviously did not want to say anything. He pointed at him and said in a low voice, “Fourth Brother, hand over the Immortal Peach and I’ll let you leave. It’s better than being eliminated on the spot.”

A look of disgust flashed across Prince Qian’s eyes. “Do you know how many Yan Immortals are blocking your way? I advise you to get as far away as you can, so that I won’t have to do anything later.”

“It seems like there’s no room for discussion.” Prince Mo spread his hands and sneered.

“Do it!” Following Prince Qian’s furious shout, all the Yan Immortals moved. Their vast Yan power turned into a dense net and descended on Prince Mo.

“A motley crowd.”

With Prince Mo as the center, dark blue crystals suddenly refracted in the air. Like ripples on the surface of a Lake, they started to move rhythmically.

At the same time, Prince Mo waved his hand. A long whip that was completely condensed from dark blue crystals, hundreds of feet long, fell from the ripples.

A faint sense of transcendence burst forth, shaking the heavens and earth.

The long whip stopped, and an unimaginable potential energy spread out in ripples.

Anyone who got close to it would have their divine body shattered in an instant. Then, with a flash of white light, they would leave the Heavenly Realm.

While holding the crystal whip, Prince Mo’s body seemed to be surging with a terrifying energy.

Every time the long whip was swung, it could destroy a Yan Immortal.

Every one of them was a top existence in the Heavenly Domain, yet they could not even withstand a single strike from Prince Mo.

In just a few dozen breaths, the 12 Yan Immortals were all eliminated by Prince Mo’s attack!

Cold sweat trickled down from Prince Qian’s sideburns. Everything had happened so quickly that it was too late for him to escape.

Prince Mo’s companion walked out of the darkness and blocked his way.

“Fourth Brother, hand over the Immortal Peach and I’ll let you two go,” Prince Mo said indifferently. The crystal whip in his hand was like a swimming dragon that coiled behind him.

“Fourth Prince, give it to him. As long as there’s life, there’s hope,” Prince Qian’s companion advised in a low voice.

He gritted his teeth and remained silent. If he handed over the Immortal Peach, it would be equivalent to him being eliminated. In the later stages, the winner of the Peach competition would be selected from Prince Jiu, Prince Yu, and Prince Mo.

A moment later, Prince Qian made up his mind and gritted his teeth as he threw the Immortal Peach to Prince Mo.

Looking at the Immortal Peach in his hand, which was glowing with treasure light and had overlapping rainbow shadows, Prince Mo smiled secretly and put it in his arms.

“Partner, let’s go!” Prince Qian did not have the slightest intention of stopping. He stomped on the ground and suddenly rose up.

However, in the next moment, the crystal whip that was coiled in the air shot out and struck Prince Qian and his companion.

The two of them did not even have time to make a sound before they completely disappeared.

It was as if nothing had happened. It was extremely quiet.

At this moment, there were only two figures left on this broken mountain peak. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The corners of Prince Mo’s mouth curled up into a smile, and his figure disappeared.

Everything returned to silence.

Not far away from the broken mountain peak, a monster ape was curled up under a huge cliff. Its eyes were as big as wheels, and they were filled with anxiety.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor, who were lying on the monster ape and witnessing everything, looked grave. They were obviously shocked by Prince Mo’s fierce attack.
