Chapter 1212: A Sharp Warning!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Kill!” they cried.

“Kill!” more voices chimed in.

“Kill them!” the people were shouting.

The battle cry burst forth from the battlefield. Countless experts from the two camps approached each other like wasps.

Quietly suspended in the center of the battlefield was an enormous scarlet worm beast with thousands of tentacles. On it stood Jian Wushuang, eyes gleaming and staring straight ahead.

Experts from two camps were getting closer to him.

“It’s time!” Gu King shouted.

“Gu King!” Jian Wushuang called out.

Jian Wushuang shouted.

“Leave it to me!” he screamed.

“Plenilune Secret Skills, Howling to Sky!!!” Gu King cried out.

Gu King roared when the horrible aura leaped up from his huge body. He opened his bloody mouth and took a deep breath. The roar broke out so violently that everything in the universe trembled.

“Hoot!!!” he cried.

With a hint of sharpness, the roar rocked everything in the universe, even vibrating time and space.

The world was shaken in the blink of an eye!

When Gu King was roaring, a faint Fire of Soul also burned fiercely in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness. In an instant, a vast Strength of Soul burst out.

“Ancient God Secret Skill… Mind-controlling!!!” shouted Gu King.

The same Mind-controlling Secret Skill turned into a horrible Soul Attack with Gu King’s roar when it was combined with Strength of Soul…

Sound waves that were visible to the human eye kept being released and amplified. They rushed towards experts of the Gold Kingdom in heavy waves.

Experts of the Gold Kingdom had been attacked even before the battle started. These waves contained Sound Wave Attack and the horrible Soul Attack. They attacked separately, but were still damaging.

More than fifty Universe Masters of the Gold Kingdom trembled under the heavy attack, but soon returned to normal.

However, more than 90% of the 1,500 Holy Masters were immediately struck into dullness.

They stood still, like idiots.

“Damn!” the Red Snow King shouted, changing his expression.

The battle was underway, and already over 90% of his Holy Masters were unresponsive?

This could be a disaster for the Gold Kingdom.

“Kill!” screamed Jian Wushuang.

“Kill!” cried Gu King.

None of experts from the Green Fire World were affected.?In the blink of an eye, huge tactical formations rushed into the Gold Kingdom’s camp, bringing with them horrible power. The Holy Masters, who were still stuck in a daze, could not react at all.

“Chi! Chi! Chi! Boom!” thundered all around.

Right at this moment!

Right at this moment, while over 90% of the Holy Masters were in a daze, the experts of the Green Fire World rushed onto the battlefield and slaughtered willfully. In one breath, they had killed over 400 Holy Masters!

“Damn it!” cried the Red Snow King.

“Bastard!” another Master shouted.

The Universe Masters of the Gold Kingdom started cursing.

The Holy Masters who had not been killed yet regained consciousness, but were still in a state of shock.

Obviously, experts from the Green Fire World could not help being overjoyed.

“Aha, Jian Wushuang, well done!” one of them shouted.

“Well done!” said another.

“Impressive, Your Highness!” cried yet another.

So many people shouted that Jian Wushuang could not recognize their individual voices.

He was also overjoyed when he saw that over 400 Holy Masters of the Gold Kingdom had been exterminated.

“400 Holy Masters!” he said, satisfied.

The Gold Kingdom had many Holy Masters, but it was still a great loss when 400 of them were killed.

Most importantly, they had been killed even before the battle had started. This was a sharp warning.

Besides, Jian Wushuang had managed to beat Long Xu King perfectly. Experts from the Green Fire World joined in the rising morale.

“Gu King, let’s go!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay,” Gu King answered and nodded. His enormous body rushed out towards the front of the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze at the most central battlefield, knowing clearly what he should do.

“Our tactical formations of Holy Masters’ battle strength is at the Holy Master level. They were almost able to fight the Holy Masters of the Gold Kingdom. It was essential to fight their Universe Masters…” Jian Wushuang said with a cold look.

Speaking of Universe Masters, the Green Fire World had only six, including him.

There were less than twenty huge tactical formations capable of battle strength at the Universe Master level.

The Gold Kingdom, however, had more than fifty Universe Masters.

“Long Xu King was badly injured,?and is hovering between life and death. Their monarch didn’t show up. No one in their camp can resist me!” Gu King said.

“While I can still fight freely, I must kill as many Universe Masters as possible to weaken their battle strength,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang was bursting with killing intent. His eyes locked on a red-robed woman far away who was carrying a scarlet scythe.

She was a Universe Master of the Gold Kingdom!

“Kill!” he chanted.

Jian Wushuang growled, jumped off of Gu King’s body, and quietly floated outward.

“You want to stop me with such weak tactical formations? Naive!” laughed the woman.

The red-robed woman looked cold with amazing killing intent in her eyes. She was fighting a Bloodseeker Tactical Formation formed by thousands of Dao Masters who were in implied agreement with each other. A Bloodseeker created in battle was able to fight Universe Masters.

The Bloodseeker was the same as normal Universe Masters in either power or defense, and even a little stronger than some ordinary ones. It moved slowly, though. The red-robed woman held the scarlet scythe and floated quickly, making fun of the Bloodseeker.

“I’m not playing anymore. You losers can go to hell!” she shrieked.

The red-robed woman looked cold, and the scarlet scythe in her hand gleamed with frost. She floated and quickly came to the head of the huge Bloodseeker. She raised the scarlet scythe, stabbing directly at the space between the eyebrows.

Unexpectedly, a gust of wind came from behind. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“What?” she said, shocked and quickly turned around. She saw a dazzling sword light and the figure of the scarlet-robed man who used the sword.

“Jian Wushuang?” the red-robed woman shouted with great fear.

From the Spaceship, she had seen how Jian Wushuang had defeated Long Xu King.

Even Long Xu King was utterly defeated by Jian Wushuang. What could she do?
