4742 The Ancient Secret

However, in Jian Wushuang’s divine sense, the galaxy that he had constructed shattered as if nothing had happened.

This seemed to be of little value, but it was indeed a little value. It seemed that other than being vast and boundless, it had no other use.

Could it be that this comprehension that could only be formed in the spiritual awareness was only used to trigger his intracranial climax?

Soon, Jian Wushuang denied it. When the realization that this move could build galaxies appeared in his mind, it made him recall the Divine Power Universe back then. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In the Divine Power Universe, a Supreme realm being could build a Divine Kingdom, which was equivalent to an extension of his own Domain. In the Divine Kingdom he built, the enemy’s power would be greatly weakened.

And now, the galaxy that was constructed in his mind seemed to have the same effect as the construction of a Divine Kingdom.

Since it was roughly the same, could he materialize the galaxy in his mind?

As Jian Wushuang thought about it, he started to try.

His finger pointed in the air, and a star pattern fell out, which was extremely mysterious and profound.

However, just as Jian Wushuang was about to take a step further and comprehend the realization, a sigh that seemed to be tortured to the extreme interrupted his thoughts.

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang suddenly became alert. He retracted all of the Yan power that had just dissipated on the surface of his body and was ready to deal with the situation at any time.

With this sigh, the stone bead, which was originally like a small planet, returned to its previous gray appearance and rolled to Jian Wushuang’s feet.

The atmosphere was deathly still. He lowered his body, his hand already on the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword, warily looking in the direction of the sound.

To be able to stay in this space without Jian Wushuang noticing at all, how terrifying was his strength?

He did not act rashly. He was thinking about how to escape.

As the sigh stopped, the space that had fallen into extreme darkness suddenly brightened up like the sun, making everything visible.

Jian Wushuang was shocked, because he just realized that there was a figure sitting cross-legged in front of him!

It was a tall and strong figure. Even though his back was facing Jian Wushuang, he still gave off an oppressive feeling.

“Why, why…”

An extremely bitter voice suddenly sounded. Then, under Jian Wushuang’s gaze, the majestic figure actually reached out his palm and patted his head.

“Why can’t I figure it out? why can’t I figure it out…”

“There must be a problem somewhere. Right, there must be a problem with my comprehension.”

In the midst of the bitter mumbling, the breathtaking figure slowly stood up, and the magnificent clothes on his body fluttered without any wind.

Then, Jian Wushuang finally saw the face of the majestic figure.

His extremely handsome face looked somewhat delicate, perhaps because he was too young. His brows were like distant mountains, and his eyes were like stars. He looked like a figure that had walked out of a painting.

At such a close distance, he ignored Jian Wushuang and was completely immersed in his own comprehension.

The terrifying pressure from the Yan power surged around him, as if a million divine mountains were pressing down.

Jian Wushuang felt extremely suffocated and the divine blood in his body flowed faster.

Such a terrifying derivative skill was beyond his knowledge. Even the aura of the three Emperor’s True Shadows could not resist it!

However, the power of this cultivation realm disappeared as the attractive figure opened his eyes.

His eyes were filled with death and pain, which made Jian Wushuang feel that he was facing some kind of bottleneck and could not break through.

“Why? I’ve already taken that step. Why can’t I sense the Emperor’s fate energy…” The eyes of the terrifying figure were listless and he started to lose his soul.

“Will it be difficult for me to become an Emperor even after this?”

Jian Wushuang was a little confused. He stood up slowly and walked toward the figure.

Surprisingly, the breathtaking figure did not look at Jian Wushuang. No matter how he waved his hand, it was of no use.

“Strange, he can’t see me. Is he not alive?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. Then, he stretched out his palm and tried to touch him.

However, the next moment, the attractive figure suddenly raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang with sharp eyes, “Who is it?”

Jian Wushuang took a few steps back and his heart almost stopped beating.

However, he soon realized that the figure was not looking at him. Instead, it bypassed him and looked at an unknown place.

Jian Wushuang looked back and did not see anyone else.

He began to understand something. He had mistakenly entered this space, and everything that had happened was most likely an image that had been sealed away for countless years.

Then, the figure seemed to be talking to someone, and a trace of pain flashed in his eyes.

“No, I can’t. I can’t make this decision.” The breathtaking figure retreated, the pain in his eyes also began to show hesitation.

However, as time passed, the pain and hesitation in his eyes gradually wavered.

This terrifying figure seemed to have reached a certain condition with an unknown object.

In the end, he reluctantly said, “Fine.”

As soon as the word fell, the entire hidden space began to shake violently, and fine cracks covered the entire green stone slab.

The space seemed to be collapsing.

Jian Wushuang did not have much time to think. He hurriedly retreated and prepared to escape.

A huge tremor resounded, and the hidden space began to fall apart. Countless gravel fell down.

Fortunately, the passage could still hold on and did not break.

Jian Wushuang ran away. Just as he was about to escape from the hidden space, he looked back.

The image in the hidden space was dying. However, just as it was about to die, the human-like image received some kind of sublimation, and a unique fate was added to it.

Boom boom boom!

The entire divine peak collapsed completely, and even the hidden space was destroyed.

Jian Wushuang stood on a mountain and looked at the broken divine peak that was still kicking up dust. He had a complicated expression.

Everything he had just experienced was like a dream. Even though it had only been a few days, it made him feel as if he had traveled to an unknown era.

Who could have left behind that scene just now?

He gently clenched his fist and realized that he had returned to his peak condition. His Yan power seemed to be able to make a breakthrough at any time.

The fierce battle in the sky was now eerily silent, but Jian Wushuang knew that the fight for the Peach was not over.

He could feel that the aura of the person who had ambushed him was still in the sky.

Since he had not died, he had to do something, such as revenge.

His feet stomped on the ground and Jian Wushuang’s figure disappeared. The entire divine peak under his feet collapsed.

“Still not giving up? Do you really want me to kill you here?”
