Chapter 1021: The Scarlet Yang Sword Principle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was indeed astonished.

He had studied the powerful Yang Sword Principle he acquired from Dao Yuanqi extensively.

From Dao Yuanzi’s instruction, he had developed the better part of the Sword Principle and had almost succeeded in completing it.

He had been stumped by the last step, however, Dao Master’s powerful strike just gave him inspiration.

“I must provoke him to draw out his attacks. The more techniques I see, the more I’ll be able to understand. ”?Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and called out, “Gu King!”

“Leave it to me! His ability is unfounded, but it will take but a second for me to heal you.” Gu King said seriously.

As a Plenilune Centipede, Gu King had mastered the skill of healing.

It was because of both his own great defensive power and Gu King’s healing skills that Jian Wushuang believed that he was invincible.

“Fight!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with renewed spirit, and with a roar, he lunged toward the Dao Master.

“Humph!”

The Dao Master resolutely stared down his attacker.

The second round of the battle was even more ferocious.

Dao Master Dreamless was faster and more vicious, and Jian Wushuang strained to parry the brutal blows over and over again.

“Ultimate Dragon-killing!”

The Dao Master struck Jian Wushuang once again, and the latter was thrown back.

Within moments, however, Jian Wushuang came at him again.

“Again!” Jian Wushuang was provoking the Dao Master, regardless of his own injuries.

“Die!”

“Ultimate Dragon-killing!”

Dao Master Dreamless put his full might behind his more powerful maneuver. He hit Jian Wushuang again and again. If his opponent had been anyone else, they would have died on the spot. However, after being injured numerous times, Jian Wushuang continued to spring back, as determined as ever.

This might have been reasonable if the Dao Master had only struck once or twice, but his opponent had been hit at least 10 times and was still full of energy.

“How is this possible? How is he unharmed?” Dao Master Dreamless was in shock.

The crowd was also dumbfounded.

They had all failed to sense Gu King inside Jian Wushuang, healing him immediately each time a blow landed and sustaining his strength and stamina.

“There’s no other way, I have to use my secret weapon!”

Dao Master Dreamless’s eyes were purposeful. He drew out a jade bottle and swallowed a drop of Essence Blood.

Immediately, his aura flared up, and his pupils burned a fiery red.

With his eyes fixated on Jian Wushuang, he lifted his spear to attack.

“Golden-dragon Drill!”

With a loud shout, Dao Master Dreamless twisted his wrist and threw out his spear in a strange maneuver.

The nearby Void was shattered immediately. Out of nothing, emerged a giant Black Hole, and at its center was a golden vortex. From deep within the vortex, the long spear launched out at Wushuang in the form of a dragon.

The earth shook.

The crowd stared at the golden dragon in unprecedented astonishment.

“So th-this…” Diyan was also amazed. “The great power of a Celestial Master!”

With just one drop of Essence Blood, Dao Master Dreamless was able to perform his move at the level of a Celestial Master.

The blow sent tremors into the earth.

The strike rattled the crowd.

Jian Wushuang froze at the sight of the dragon. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Th-this maneuver…”

The attack filled Jian Wushuang’s vision.

It was a paralyzing and dominating blow.

As the spear sped toward him, the secret of the Third Sword Principle dawned on Jian Wushuang.

“Could this be the answer?”

He finally deciphered his dilemma.

Jian Wushuang was estatic.

Right as the spear reached his chest, he returned the blow.

Jian Wushuang’s strike was just as agressive, and perhaps even more vicious.

All of his strength poured into the blow.

Bam!

The ground quaked at the ear-piercing sound.

Shoo!

Jian Wushuang was forced backward like a Flowing Light. When he finally found his footing, Jian Wushuang felt a sweet taste climbed into his mouth and spat out blood. Drained of color, his face still reflected a curious expression.

On the other side, standing in the Void, Dao Master Dreamless was also pale. It was not easy for him to release his strongest attack. With astonishment in his eyes, he looked to Jian Wushuang.

“You, you’ve broken through?”

He spoke slowly.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smirked and wiped the blood from his mouth, saying, “I couldn’t have devised my third Sword Principle so fast if it wasn’t for you. Thank you.”

Indeed, without the inspiration of Dao Master Dreamless’s fierce attack and excellent spear skills, Jian Wushuang would not have succeeded in inventing his own third Sword Principle so soon.

During the fierce battle, he had been enlightened. The secret of the last step dawned on him, and the Third Sword Principle finally revealed itself.

Staring at the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang murmured, “My third one is Dao Yuanzi’s legacy. It’s yang, fierce, and overwhelming. It’s replete with power. It will be the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle!”

After the Coalescence Sword Principle and the Aurora Sword Principle, Jian Wushuang finally devised his third one, the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle.

Being the strongest Sword Principle, it achieved the Universe Level at its creation.
