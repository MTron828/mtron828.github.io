Chapter 1473: Three Thousand Years

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Holocaust Sect, in Eternal Chaotic World, was hated by everyone.

Especially by Fiery King, who once watched the merciless act of Holocaust Sect with his own eyes, and loathed them even more.

“It’s a pity that it isn’t Eternal Chaotic World, but Sky Sword Prison. Even if we find out about Blood Emperor’s true identity, we can’t do anything about him,” Fiery King continued, “The experts in Sky Sword Prison are all prisoners. They have trouble even keeping themselves alive. Who would be bothered if Blood Emperor was one of the experts from Holocaust Sect. As for myself, even if I intend to take action against Blood Emperor, under the limitation of divine power, I can only suppress him and torture him. But it’s impossible for me to kill him!”

Fiery King was publicly acknowledged as the number one expert in Sky Sword Prison.

Even if it was him, under the condition where his divine power was limited, he couldn’t kill a King.

“Jian Wushuang, if Blood Emperor is really after you because of your Blood-killing Plate Armor, you have to be careful,” Fiery King looked at Jian Wushuang and exhorted. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Blood-killing Plate Armor, to us ordinary Universe Gods, isn’t very useful. However, to Blood Emperor, who is from Holocaust Sect, it is very useful. If he were to get Blood-killing Plate Armor, he could figure out a way to enhance the power of Blood-killing Plate Armor over the years. He could level up Blood-killing Plate Armor into Blood-killing King Armor!”

“Once he obtains Blood-killing King Armor, I dare say that his fighting power should be able to reach the second stage of Real God. By then, he could leave Sky Sword Prison,”

“And this should be his only chance to leave Sky Sword Prison. He definitely won’t let the chance slip!”

“Hence, even if I just taught him a lesson earlier and warned him, he will definitely not hesitate to take action against you if he has a chance.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He also knew that Blood-killing Plate Armor was useful to Blood Emperor.

Before Blood-killing Plate Armor, Blood Emperor definitely wouldn’t be bothered by Fiery King’s threat. After all, although Fiery King was strong, he couldn’t kill him.

“At first, I intended to train myself at Blood Emperor’s Darkness Mountain for a while. Then, when my Flowing Light Phantom reaches the second level, I will start my massacre plan. However, it seems like my plan has to be delayed,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

Blood Emperor had his eyes on Jian Wushuang. If he were to continue training in Sky Sword Prison or launch a massacre plan, Blood Emperor might find him again. Then, he wasn’t sure if he could keep himself alive in a fight against Blood Emperor.

“Jian Wushuang, if you want to train, why not just return to Fiery Prison with me?” Fiery King said.

“Fiery Prison?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“We, the four Kings, each have our territories in Sky Sword Prison. Blood Emperor’s territory is here in Darkness Mountain, while mine is in Fiery Prison. It is much bigger than Darkness Mountain and there are more experts there too. Plus, it is my territory. You can fight against anyone as training. Regardless of how much Blood Emperor is dying to get the Blood-killing Plate Armor from you, he doesn’t have the guts to barge into Fiery Prison to hunt you down. Plus, he can’t hunt you down anyway,” Fiery King suggested.

“Great idea,” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

What he lacked was training.

There was still room for improvement in terms of his power.

Once he improved his power, he would be confident enough to fight against Blood Emperor. By then, even if he were to wander in Blood Emperor’s territory, Darkness Mountain, Blood Emperor could only sit and watch but couldn’t do anything about him.

“If so, let’s depart immediately!”

Jian Wushuang immediately departed to Fiery Prison with Fiery King.

Fiery Prison was just like rolling hills, but most of the hills were made of volcanoes.

At that very moment, among the scorching hot volcanoes, Jian Wushuang stood with his sword while there was a short elderly in red armor before him.

The short elderly held a red hammer in each hand while he revealed a smile on his face. “Jian Wushuang, did you offend Mister Fiery King? Mister Fiery King sent us a message that, if we were to ever come across you, we have to try our best to kill you.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and wasn’t surprised.

After all, it was a requirement that Fiery King had suggested.

As he wanted to train himself in Fiery Prison, it naturally had to be a life-and-death challenge.

If the experts in Fiery Prison were to hold back their power, the training wouldn’t be as effective.

“Want to kill me? I shall see if you have the ability to,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Kill!”

The short elderly didn’t bullshit anymore. There was a chilly gleam in his eyes as he charged forward.

Hong! Hong!

The two red hammers pierced the air and slammed down toward Jian Wushuang with boundless power.

Jian Wushuang immediately wielded his sword to block.

From that day onwards, Jian Wushuang wandered in Fiery Prison alone and exchanged blows with many experts in Fiery Prison.

There were more experts in Fiery Prison than in Darkness Mountain, especially experts on the second level. There were a total of eight in Fiery Prison itself. The others were made up of many Real Gods and Universe Gods on the peak of the third level.

These people were suitable for Jian Wushuang to train himself on.

Plus, the experts didn’t know Jian Wushuang’s relationship with Fiery King. They even thought Jian Wushuang had offended Fiery King, which explained why Fiery King was so angry that he wanted him dead.

Hence, the experts in Fiery Prison who came across Jian Wushuang tried their best to kill Jian Wushuang.

But Jian Wushuang’s defense power was extremely strong and he could barely deal with them.

During his training, Jian Wushuang’s power was increasing gradually.

The years flew past.

In the blink of an eye, it had been three thousand years.

For the past three thousand years, Jian Wushuang had been fighting vigorously with all the experts in Fiery Prison.

In addition to the one thousand three hundred years that he had been in Sky Sword Prison, he had been imprisoned for four thousand three hundred years.

Four thousand three hundred years was an extremely long time to Jian Wushuang.

…

In Fiery Prison, on the top of a huge volcano, on the border of the volcano crater, Jian Wushuang sat in silence, alone. He slowly opened his eyes and revealed a joyous expression.

“Three thousand years!”

“I have been cultivating and comprehending in Fiery Prison for three thousand years. I have finally comprehended the third image of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation!”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly while he felt a despondent mood.

He was a person of quick comprehension and he possessed high innate advantage in terms of comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine.

He didn’t use too much time to fully comprehend the first two images of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.

However, he had used a total of three thousand years to comprehend the third image and he had many related trainings in the past three thousand years.
