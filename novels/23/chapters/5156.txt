Chapter 5160: Ranking

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Original Universe

Countless cultivators gazed up at the starry sky.

A massive stone stele, resembling the sun and the moon, was visible from anywhere. Simultaneously, those Yan immortals who had entered the affiliated world of the Qishen Temple also saw the list.

The Universe Deity-Demon List was divided into Heaven, Earth, and Human categories.

The Heaven category corresponded to Emperor-level experts, the Earth category to Grand Yan Immortals, and the Human category naturally to those Yan immortals.

However, the Yan immortals of the current era had been astonishingly brought into the Qishen Temple’s affiliated world.

As for the Grand Yan Immortals, they had long transcended the world’s constraints, so the Qishen Temple couldn’t astonish them.

Yet, given such a tremendous opportunity, even if the Temple didn’t intervene, these Grand Yan Immortals would come on their own.

As for the Emperors, that went without saying. They were beings beyond the universe’s control, yet they longed for the Qishen Temple even more.

The rankings on the three lists were from top to bottom. The Heaven list featured over 10,000 Emperor-level experts.

The list was arranged based on the strengths of the experts in the Original Universe, If Emperors from other universes arrived, the Universe

Deity-Demon List would accurately judge and include them.

This was an unparalleled eternal treasure, not only boundlessly powerful but also able to accurately calculate an Emperor’s strength.

“Look, there’s the Patriarch’s name on the Heaven list,” exclaimed a young woman from the Dream Clan standing behind the Dream Dao Ancestor.

This exclamation drew everyone’s gaze. “Dream Dao Ancestor, ranked 97th on the Heaven list, a top fourth-tier expert from the medium-grade world, Great Dream Realm.”

The introduction below the name stated clearly, even marking the expert’s strength and the world where their Dao Arena were located.

In another part of the Great Desolate Wilderness, Jian Wushuang and his companions also noticed this list.

However, they had no time to spare. If the Emperors from the

Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm didn’t arrive soon, they would all perish here.

“Brother Jiu Yu, when will the assisting Emperors arrive? We can’t hold on much longer!” gasped Jin Hong, one of the geniuses from the Dongyan Realm. They had been fighting against those monsters for a whole day.

Their Yan power had reached the point of exhaustion. If it weren’t for the fact that, this time because of the Qishen Temple, they had exchanged all their assets for pills, they would have all perished already.

Now, the pills were used up. If reinforcements didn’t come soon, they could only meet their end here.

In addition to dealing with these monsters, a portion of them also had to protect Jian Wushuang and Hu Qing, the two burdens.

“Luo Shui, come back to me. You don’t need to protect those two useless people. Hurry and take my place; I can’t hold on anymore,” Jiu Yu said, ignoring him completely. He had to give up on Hu Qing and Jian Wushuang. It was a matter of life and death now. Even if the Emperors blamed him in the future, he could explain. After all, the Dao was difficult to traverse. He had become a fourth-tier complete Grand Yan Immortal with great difficulty. He couldn’t die for someone else just because of an Emperor’s words.

If he knew that their Emperor Dongyan had already fallen, he didn’t know if he would be happy or sad.

Luo Shui was also in a dire situation. Although the powerful monsters were being held off by those fourth-tier complete Grand Yan Immortals, she still had to deal with two Nine Revolutions-level Sprites.

Even though she only had a fourth-grade Dao, she could still barely cope with these two Nine Revolutions Sprites who had no consciousness. However, she couldn’t break free at the moment. What the Emperor had instructed naturally outweighed that genius from Dongyan Realm.

“The Emperor’s instructions cannot be abandoned,” Luo Shui said softly but firmly. After speaking, she devoted her whole being to dealing with those two monsters, ignoring the genius.

Jian Wushuang hid behind Luo Shui, his eyes fixed on the Universe Deity-Demon List. Hu Qing did the same.

They had initially intended to help, but the sudden appearance of the stone tablet left them utterly stunned. Everyone present was momentarily baffled by its abrupt appearance, unsure of what had transpired. However, amidst the chaos, they scarcely spared it a glance before plunging back into the battle.

Jian Wushuang and Hu Qing, on the other hand, were entranced by the Universe Deity-Demon List. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Whether it was their own intuition or the list assisting them in identifying their rankings, they immediately spotted their names at first glance.

“Hu Qing, Rank 160 million, Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, hailing from the high- grade world of Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm.”

High- grade world?

It seemed that, unconsciously, Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm had already restored the source of the heavenly realm!

Narrowing his eyes, Hu Qing studied the list, which laid bare the true strength of many individuals.

For instance, Tongtian Buddha was no longer just a Dao Ancestor; he had ascended to the position of a Ruler. As for himself, he was ranked 160 million, a considerably high position in the entire universe. Especially considering he was only a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

Most of those ranked higher than him were close to the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, with only a few of them being Nine-turn Grand Yan Immortals.

Jian Wushuangs ranking was not too different from Hu Qings, despite being only a Three-turn Grand Yan Immortal.

At the same time, many powerhouses also noticed Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, Rank 167,849,099, Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, originating from the middle realm of Great Si Region.”

A Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal managing to secure a position around 167 million astonished many Grand Yan Immortals, making them question whether the list was erroneous.

To understand, it’s crucial to know that almost all the five billion Grand Yan Immortals were at the Ninth Revolutions level. There were only a few scattered individuals at the Six Revolutions level among them. Each of these individuals was extraordinary, especially those Sixth Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals who ranked among the top two billion. They represented the pinnacle of the ultimate path.

But a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal somehow managed to secure a position among the 160 millionth rank. This fact was beyond belief for everyone.

The names on the list seemed endless, but only the top trillion were displayed. Among these trillion, less than 10 percent were at the Three Revolutions level, most being at the Six Revolutions level.

This gave an idea of just how remarkable Jian Wushuangs rank was.

Jian Wushuang himself was not surprised by his rank. He was well aware of his own strength, much stronger than Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals but weaker than those at the Perfected Nine Revolutions level.

He looked upward, all the way to the top.

Information about billions of people appeared in his mind. Such memory capacity was effortless for Jian Wushuang at the Grand Yan Immortal level. He could even easily do this at the Yan Immortal level.

“Luo Shui, Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, ranking over 400 million!” Jian Wushuang shook his head bitterly.

His focus wasn’t on those ordinary Grand Yan Immortals; he directly turned his attention to the top thousand ranks.

“Jiu Yu, ranking 456, Perfected Nine Revolutions Circle Grand Yan Immortal, from the high- grade world of Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm.”

This ranking surprised Jian Wushuang. He hadn’t expected Jiu Yu to be so powerful. Although he had heard that Jiu Yu had integrated several Dao paths, considering this ranking spanned the entire universe, being within the top 500 was extraordinary..
