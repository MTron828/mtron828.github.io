Chapter 2453: The Ultimate Strike of Death

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“No, he’s actually scarier than Senior Brother Qiancheng!” Long Zishan stammered.

Truthfully, Tu Qiancheng was skillful but however great he was, it was impossible for him to face close to 50 First-Class Divine Demons in that manner when he was only in the Chaotic Realm.

Forget about the Chaotic Realm, even if Tu Qiancheng was a First-Class Divine Demon like the rest, he would have chosen to escape at the first given moment upon receiving attacks from so many genius disciples. He would never have the stamina to stay back and start a huge battle against them.

However, Jian Wushuang dared to do it!

Not only that, he actually succeeded.

Almost 50 First-Class Divine Demon genius disciples joined hands together, but could not kill Jian Wushuang in a short time.

Not to mention that a lot of those First-Class Divine Demons were already being overpowered by Jian Wushuang’s abilities and stamina while fighting him, they also became fearful of him.

“At this rate, how could we even think of avenging Junior Brother Pang Tao?” Long Zishan was very anxious.

However, at that moment, a frostily beautiful woman was standing in a corner of the battlefield.

She was Yu Aoqing.

She did not join in the siege and attacked Jian Wushuang. She was only quietly standing there and staring deadly at Jian Wushuang.

Everything in the surroundings including those people and the battle had vanished for her.

Even her own presence was as good as vanished.

There was one person left in her entire world which was Jian Wushuang.

In her mind, she was recalling her master’s teachings.

Her master was one of the highest-ranking elders in the Great Compassion Sect who used to be a killer. An assassin!

He was such a great killer that he would be called the Emperor in the Dark.

As long as he made a move, he would ensure his opponent dies.

That master of hers taught her how to become a truly qualified assassin and also told her about the special state an assassin should achieve.

That state was the State of Self-Oblivious.

Forget about oneself. Forget about the world. Forget about everything. Remember only the target and the mission.

Although her master had achieved that profound state and demonstrated it to her before, Yu Aoqing never fully grasped it.

However, at that very moment, she had her full attention staring at Jian Wushuang who was on the battlefield, watching his every move and even facial expression.

Finally, she understood something.

“Forget about myself. Forget about emotions...”

Yu Aoqing murmured to herself and her figure disappeared in a flash from the battlefield in the next moment.

She had completely blended into the air, becoming part of the space, time, heavens, and earth. Nobody could realize her existence when she was in such a special state.

She gradually moved closer to Jian Wushuang and very soon arrived somewhere near him.

Jian Wushuang was still unleashing his sword techniques and fighting frenziedly with those First-Class Divine Demons. Their battle intent was shaking the Heavens.

“Buzz off!”

With a furious shout, Jian Wushuang lashed out his sword sideways and struck four First-Class Divine Demons before him with the back of his blade.

Although those four First-Class Divine Demons tried blocking with their full might, the overpowering sword pressure still hit them hard as they fell towards the ground.

Yu Aoqing made her move at that moment.

Nobody had realized that, including Jian Wushuang.

Yu Aoqing appeared behind Jian Wushuang and suddenly thrust her pitch-black dagger towards Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“Self-Oblivious State, Exterminate with One Strike!”

Yu Aoqing’s eyes showed a terrifying glint of coldness.

It was a crouching assassin who finally found the perfect time to strike and unleashed her ultimate strike of death.

That one strike was enough to cause fear on any Divine Demon.

It was too sudden.

Yu Aoqing’s appearance was just too sudden.

Nobody noticed she was there previously. Only when Yu Aoqing appeared and thrust a dagger out that people were suddenly aware.

“It’s Yu Aoqing!”

“When did she get there?”

“That strike was...perfect. What a perfect strike!”

“Nobody would be able to block that strike.”

The First-Class Divine Demons on the battlefield were all awestruck. Some even had fear written on their faces.

All of them could recognize just how terrifying Yu Aoqing’s strike was.

Her movement was so clean and perfect without any sense of redundancy when she attacked. That strike was sure to kill.

Yu Aoqing’s attack at that time was really a pleasant surprise. It was just too perfect.

“Junior Sister.”

Even Long Zishan was shocked by Yu Aoqing’s movement. He believes if that sudden strike was to be directed at him, he might not even have a survival chance.

Following right after that shock was a feeling of ecstasy.

He could tell that Jian Wushuang did not notice Yu Aoqing’s sudden appearance as well. It was impossible for him to dodge Yu Aoqing’s perfect strike.

Jian Wushuang was indeed incredibly surprised. The perfect killing strike from Yu Aoqing was also out of his expectations and he did not have time to react to it.

He could neither avoid the attack by relying on his movement speed nor using his sword technique.

He could only allow the dark dagger to stab his heart.

However, he barely panicked. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ring!

The extremely cold black dagger which brought an infinite amount of killing intent was closing in on Jian Wushuang’s body.

The dagger finally tore through Jian Wushuang’s attire and penetrated his skin.

Thud!

When the soft sounds of the blade entering his body were heard, Yu Aoqing felt somewhat excited.

“Master, I’ve finally done it!”

I’ve finally achieved what you described as the State of Self-Oblivious!”

Yu Aoqing mumbled.

The many First-Class Divine Demons who were attacking Jian Wushuang were ecstatic when they saw that.

However, suddenly...

Clang!

A metal clashing noise was heard and all those genius disciples’ ecstatic smiles froze one by one.

Yu Aoqing surprisingly felt some resistance on the tip of her dagger and was shocked the next moment.

The tip of her dagger had indeed penetrated Jian Wushuang’s skin and went into his flesh. However, it only pushed slightly into it and did not reach Jian Wushuang’s heart. It stopped at the rib bone in front of his heart.

An explosive power had been projected when the dagger’s tip touched his rib bone but it did not shatter it. Instead, that bone had blocked the dagger.

“B-bone?”

Yu Aoqing was completely shocked. “My stroke couldn’t shatter his rib bone?”

“How is that possible?” The genius disciples around were also dumbfounded.

Long Zishan was also awestruck.

They could not believe their eyes.

One must understand that, although a cultivator could practice body tempering methods and have a strong divine body, it was only an external feature and would not help with internal resistance.
