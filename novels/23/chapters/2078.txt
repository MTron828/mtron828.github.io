Chapter 2079 Ancient God Emperor

Under the huge gates, the black-armoured general’s eyes shimmered in astonishment, fixated on Jian Wushuang.

After a moment of silence, the general finally spoke. “You are smart, but even if you know this Dao soldier’s being controlled by the Ancient God Emperor, what else can you do?”

“Haha, if you were alive, defending your gates with your consciousness-controlled Dao soldier alone would suffice. But what’s left of you is that very strand of consciousness, and a brittle one. It’s already extremely difficult for you to remain within these gates, don’t even bother mentioning engaging in battle!”

“Which means to say, the longer your soldier fights with me, the more damage it brings to your strand of consciousness. That’s why you didn’t want to fight me from the very beginning, convincing me to leave. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang grinned as he watched the general.

The general was fully covered in his black armour, so Jian Wushuang could not see if he had had a change in facial expression.

But he did sense something change through the general’s eyes.

“Under these circumstances, the only way to block me is to kill me swiftly, which you had just attempted. You couldn’t do it. Even if I can’t defeat you, as long as I force you to engage in battle with me… let’s see how long your consciousness will last,” Jian Wushuang sniggered.

The general’s glance shifted, facing Jian Wushuang again. “You’re right, with simply my consciousness, I can’t block you. Since it has to be this way, come on in.”

After being said, the ancient residence gates – scribbled with weird marks and drawings of ancient beasts – rumbled and slowly opened behind the general.

A broad pathway appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

As for that black-armoured general? He was now stationed beside the residence’s gates, eyes shut, reverting to his original statue form.

Seeing the gates now being opened for him, Jian Wushuang showed a faint smile and made his way in.

Outside the Ancient Emperor’s Residence, countless Ancient Gods had their eyes fixated on that entrance.

When they saw the gates open, each and every one of them was astonished.

“How is that even possible?” King Chen Xing was even more bewildered.

He knew how terrifying the general was.

When he had first fought the general, a strike of the spear had been enough to badly wound him. He had almost lost his life then.

Without a choice, he had had to leave.

But now, Jian Wushuang had even defeated the general?

“He actually made it through the three obstacles my father left behind?” King Chen Xing appeared extremely gloomy, before snorting, “Even if he made it in, my father may not approve him!”

“My father was one of the strongest in the First Era, you think it’s easy receiving his approval?”

That thought remained lingering in King Chen Xing’s heart.

The huge, ancient place was a place of wonders, even challenges could be found within it.

But these challenges were reserved for the weaker Ancient God Clan people when they entered once every one million years. It meant nothing to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had made his way through without any more obstacles.

Before long, he reached the deepest part of the Residence. There, a hazy figure was seen sitting cross-legged.

It was a strong man in gold robes, his height beyond three metres.

There he sat. The first impression he gave people was the word “lionheart”, and within it an undeniable authority and dignity.

This air of authority was as if he had the entire world under his foot, countless experts were simply ants to him.

In a glance, Jian Wushuang knew who the other person was.

“Greetings to you, Ancient God Emperor.” Jian Wushuang gave a small bow as a form of respect.

“Jian Wushuang?” The Ancient God Emperor gave him a glance. “You’re good. Only an eight-star Ancient God, that’s simply an Emperor God amongst human Cultivators. But your fighting power is obviously on par with Second Stage Great Emperors, even my Nine Great War Spirits couldn’t stop you.”

“Such impressive leapfrogging skills, you remind me of someone by the name of Emperor Bai, have you heard of this person?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Emperor Bai was from the First Era, of course the Ancient God Emperor knew about him.

“Emperor Bai is not the leader of the Sanctuary Alliance. Both he and I practice Inverse Cultivation,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Indeed,” The Ancient God Emperor smiled indifferently, unsurprised. “In the beginning, that kiddo Emperor Bai was the same as you, nothing more than an Emperor God. But his fighting power kept the weaker Second Stage Great Emperors real busy. People then started to infer that it had to do with his unique method of cultivation, leading to the discovery of Inverse Cultivation. There were a few Third Stage Great Emperors back then who were interested in his method, and wanted to snatch it away from him.”

“In the end, the Third Stage Great Emperors were powerless, even though they had joined hands, even though kiddo had Peak Second Stage fighting powers.”

“When he surpassed Great Emperor levels, no one could touch him.”

“The kiddo’s defense mechanisms were the same as yours.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang gasped silently.

He had heard things regarding Emperor Bai, like how he was one of the strongest during the First Era. But he could not be compared to elites like Ancient God Emperor and Sword Emperor Dugu. Furthermore, Ancient God Emperor was way more ancient than Emperor Bai. It only made sense that he called Emperor Bai “kiddo”.

But the Emperor Bai of today couldn’t be compared to how he was back in the First Era.

According to Emperor Bai, he was now at the peak of the Third Stage, almost between that and the Fourth Stage. That kind of fighting power would be slightly stronger than Ancient God Emperor’s prime.

“I didn’t like that kiddo. Nor do I like you.”

Ancient God Emperor gazed upon Jian Wushuang with that same air of authority surrounding him, and said, “You know, it’s hard to keep my strand of consciousness around. The reason why the gates open once every one million years is because it takes a lot of energy to control whatever I need once it opens, and this energy only fully regenerates after a million years.

“You barging in this time has forced my consciousness to awaken. Having offended me this way, if I had more than simply that strand of consciousness, I would have killed you!”

As he spoke, a murderous aura covered Jian Wushuang.
