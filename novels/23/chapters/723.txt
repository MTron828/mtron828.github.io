“If I don’t use the power of my Sword Heart, I’m much weaker than him in physical strength. But his fighting skills are inferior to mine and his spearmanship is not as good as my swordsmanship, either,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Both of them had their own advantages.

Gu Changfeng was physically strong while Jian Wushuang was excellent at fighting skills and swordsmanship.

“Jian Wushuang, your swordsmanship is very excellent, but your physical strength is lacking. I guess you haven’t cultivated the Ancient God Secret Skill yet?” Gu Changfeng asked.

“Ancient God Secret Skill?” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He had heard of the Ancient God Secret Skill and that it could greatly enhance one’s offensive power.

It was the best among the Secret Skills which could enhance offensive power.

For Sect experts in the Firmament Territory, there were three great opportunities in Eternal Zone, Demon God Essence Blood, Life-and-Death Baptismal Pool, and the Ancient God Secret Skill.

“I knew it.”

Seeing Jian Wushuang shake his head, Gu Changfeng was not surprised.

Through his fight with Jian Wushuang, he had already discovered that Jian Wushuang was physically weak. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang had not cultivated the Ancient God Secret Skill yet.

“Gu Changfeng, are you saying that you’ve cultivated the Ancient God Secret Skill?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He knew that those Secret Skills which could enhance one’s offensive power were only accessible to Divine Realm experts in the Firmament Territory. Since he was just a Skyscraping Realm expert, he was not qualified to cultivate them yet.

This obviously made him weaker than Divine Realm experts in physical strength. If it were not for his Sword Heart, he would not be able to compete with those advanced or superior Divine Realm experts no matter how strong his swordsmanship was.

After hearing his words, Gu Changfeng blinked and said, “Of course I’ve cultivated the Ancient God Secret Skill. Actually, everyone in our tribe, including the clansmen who have not awakened their bloodline, have cultivated the Ancient God Secret Skill. But the levels we have cultivated are different.”

“For example, Gu Lan is cultivating Level Two, which can enhance his physical strength six times!”

“I’m cultivating Level Three, which can directly enhance my physical strength nine times.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes wide in astonishment.

No wonder Gu Changfeng and Gu Lan were so strong physically. Both of them had cultivated the Ancient God Secret Skill.

The Ancient God Secret Skill could also enhance one’s power was available to the clansmen who had not awakened their bloodline?

“Since they can cultivate it at their current level, what about me?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Let’s go. I will take you to the place where we cultivate the Ancient God Secret Skill,” Gu Changfeng said and laughed.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head eagerly, his eyes full of excitement.

Jian Wushuang followed Gu Changfeng to a hillside.

The entire Eighth Tribe was located on a huge mountain. On this hillside, there was a large black temple.

It looked ancient and one could feel its mysteriousness even before entering.

There were several clansmen standing guard in front of the temple.

When Gu Changfeng and Jian Wushuang approached the front gate, the clansmen immediately turned and faced them.

However, they could feel the pure spiritual aura of Jian Wushuang, so they glanced at him and then allowed him to enter.

Except for the bright gems shining in the slightly dim temple, there were no other decorations.

“Jian Wushuang, look at the surrounding stone walls,” Gu Changfeng said.

Jian Wushuang immediately fixed his eyes upon them and was shocked.

He realized there were ancient words carved all over the stone walls.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang frowned as he began to read the ancient words.

“This is?Star-River?, the Ancient God Secret Skill I’m cultivating. You can start reading from there,” Gu Changfeng pointed to a stone wall.

Jian Wushuang looked up and found the first chapter of this Secret Skill.

“One of the three Ancient God Secret Skills, the Star-river Secret Skill!”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Even though he knew about the existence of the Ancient God Secret Skill, he did not expect there to be three types.

The Star-river Secret Skill that was carved on the stone walls in front of him was one of the three Ancient God Secret Skills that could greatly enhance one’s offensive power.

With a trace of doubt, Jian Wushuang continued to read it.

The Star-river Secret Skill was divided into many levels, Level One, Level Two… and the 11th level!

This stone wall recorded the 11 levels of the Star-river Secret Skill.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang had been completely taken aback.

“11 levels, there are 11 levels!”

“How could that be possible?”

Jian Wushuang looked at it in shock as he was roared wildly in his heart.

He realized that the Star-river Secret Skill was the one which Vice Palace Master Ling Yu mentioned before. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

But Vice Palace Master Ling Yu said that this Secret Skill was comprised of five levels, each of which could enhance one’s offensive power three times. After he cultivated to Level Five, his offensive power would be enhanced 15 times.

This Secret Skill was absolutely heaven-defying.

After all, the Secret Skills in the Firmament Territory or even the Eternal World could only enhance one’s offensive power 10 times at most.

Because of this, this Secret Skill attracted experts and disciples from all the Sects in the Firmament Territory.

All the experts wanted to obtain more Ancient God Essence Blood and cultivate the highest level of the Secret skill so that they could enhance their offensive power 15 times, which would be a huge advantage.

However, none of them knew that the Secret Skill they were crazy for actually consisted of 11 levels instead of five!

Each level could enhance one’s offensive power three times. After someone cultivated the highest level, his offensive power would be enhanced 33 times.

“Terrifying!”

“What a terrifying Secret Skill.”

Jian Wushuang was completely taken aback.

The experts in the Firmament Territory were already quite eager to obtain the first five levels. If they knew that there were 11 levels, they would definitely go crazy!

“Oh no!”

Jian Wushuang’s look suddenly changed. He stared at Level 11 and read it through quickly. He was even more astonished.

“The 11th Level?”

“No, the Star-river Secret Skill has more than 11 levels!”

“The 11th Level isn’t the end of the Star-river Secret Skill!”
