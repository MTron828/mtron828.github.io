“A secret chamber?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Different from the secret chambers in the outer layer, nearly all the chambers in the inner layer contained treasures and opportunities.

Nearly every untouched chamber meant there would be something to gain. And because Jian Wushuang was now in an unexplored area, the chamber before his eyes might be the same.

Without thinking, Jian Wushuang opened the door and walked in.

The first thing he saw was a purple saber floating in the air. The saber gave off a ruthless aura, surrounded by Purple Thunderbolts.

“It’s aura... It’s a first-grade magic weapon!” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

A first-grade magic weapon might have been rare in the Divine Land, but it was common in this mansion, as there were so many magic weapons, manuals, and elixirs of the first-grade.

Jian Wushuang went over to the saber and tried to gather it in his Interspatial Ring, but he was stopped by a Purple Thunderbolt.

“Get away from me!

“How dare you, a Sword Principle cultivator and in the Saint Realm, try to take hold of me! Get lost!”

A fierce voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and observed the saber.

Magic weapons always had their spirits, and a first-grade magic weapon’s spirit could be very intelligent. And this spirit of the saber was as wild as the saber itself.

“Interesting.”?Jian Wushuang smiled and reached his hand toward the saber again.

“Get your hands off me!”

As the saber let out a shrill scream, Purple Thunderbolts continued emerging from the blade one after another. An ordinary expert at Stage Two or Three might have shrunk back, but Jian Wushuang was different.

Although he was hit by the Purple Thunderbolts, Jian Wushuang was not hurt at all. Eventually, he was able to grab the saber firmly and put it into his Interspatial Ring by force.

“You’re just a spirit, so stop struggling.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and was about to leave the chamber. Right then, he heard someone talking.

“There’s a secret chamber here, but it seems that someone has broken in before us.”

“Is someone coming here?”?Jian Wushuang walked out of the chamber with a frown.

The moment he was out of the room, he saw two figures approaching him.

One of them was a slovenly black-haired man, and the other one was a stone-faced man in a long silver robe.

At that moment, they spotted Jian Wushuang as well. They seemed to be surprised upon discovering that Jian Wushuang was in the Saint Realm. And after they could see his face clearly, their facial expressions became strange.

Jian Wushuang had the same expression on his face as the two men did while he bowed and said, “Your Excellency.”

That black-haired man was no other than Iron Saber Lord himself.

Jian Wushuang had come from the Iron Saber Territory and was a commander in Iron Saber Lord’s camp. Moreover, he had been on the Flaming Battlefield under his orders.

From the very beginning, he had been an underling of this lord.

“Swordsman.” Iron Saber Lord looked at Jian Wushuang with a frown. “Never thought I would meet you here.”

“Iron Saber, it’s bold for your man to make his way here as only an expert in the Saint Realm.” The stone-faced man showed a meaningful smile. He was Jian Wushuang’s acquaintance.

“Your Excellency.” Jian Wushuang greeted the other man, Silver Wing Lord.

He had met the lord once when he was still in the Iron Saber Territory.

At that time, the lord had been a man of great supremacy to him and had intimidated him, but now Jian Wushuang felt quite calm seeing him again.

“Swordsman,” Iron Saber Lord pulled a long face and continued, “the inner layer is a dangerous place. Even I have to be extremely careful while exploring here. You’re just in the Saint Realm and should try your luck in the outer layer. So, what are you doing here?”

Jian Wushuang looked up at his lord. He could see that the words of the lord were attempting to reprimand him, and that somehow warmed his heart.

He understood that Iron Saber Lord had said that because he thought of him as a brother and cared for his safety.

“When I was serving as a commander in the Iron Saber Territory, I heard that His Excellency cares for his men very much. Now, I know it’s true,”?thought Jian Wushuang. Then he said to his lord, “Your Excellency, I’m not interested in the opportunities or treasures in the outer layer.”

“So, then you entered the inner layer?” Before Iron Saber Lord could finish speaking, Silver Wing Lord chipped in with a smile, “Boy, don’t you know that the inner layer is a battlefield only for lords? What’s your business here?”

“I...” Jian Wushuang could not find the words to answer that question.

“I can’t say that it’s because I think I’m no weaker than a lord. And even if I did say so, I guess they wouldn’t believe me.”

“Well, since he is already here, there is no need to figure out the reason.” Iron Saber Lord waved his hand and ended the topic. He said to Jian Wushuang with concern in his eyes, “The inner layer is full of danger. You’re lucky to have made your way this far, but you won’t always be such a lucky one. Encountering a more powerful Puppet Fighter will only lead you to a dead end.

“So, from this moment on, you’re going to stay with me. Silver Wing and I will try our best to keep you safe.”

However, upon hearing this, Silver Wing Lord frowned and argued with him. “Iron Saber, we’re in a dangerous place and might meet with trouble at any time. He will only slow us down. It’s...”

“Swordsman is my subordinate.” Iron Saber Lord shot a glance at Silver Wing Lord.

Silver Wing Lord forced a smile and shrugged, saying, “Fine. Since you’re the stronger one, it’s up to you.”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang could not help rolling his eyes and saying, “Your Excellencies, don’t worry. I’ll take care of myself. Maybe I can lend a hand if we run into danger.”

“Lend us a hand? No.”

Silver Wing Lord looked at Jian Wushuang meaningfully and continued, “Boy, I know that you have killed a rival at the Heaven-defying Level, but it will be a different story to kill a lord. You’ll learn that when you’ve fought with a real lord.”
