Chapter 2911: Dragons and Phoenixes

——

“The power of the Golden Dragon and the Blood Phoenix is really powerful.” Jian Wushuang looked at the two giants in front of him with a heavy heart.

“Humph, sword one, do you think the sect-protecting formation of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is only so powerful in attacking?” Long Xingzi sneered and looked at the three Immortal Saints around him. “Use that move!”

Chu Yong and the other two nodded heavily.

In an instant, their divine power surged again.

Golden light surged out of Long Xingzi’s body.

“Dragon and Phoenix cry, kill the demon!”

With Long Xingzi’s low shout, the three-clawed Golden Dragon, which was over 300 meters long, suddenly let out a dragon cry.

The Dragon’s cry was unusually loud and reverberated between heaven and earth. At the same time, visible ripples spread out and covered the void around Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

When the ripples spread out, he had already sensed the special power contained within them.

“Space-time, it’s the power of space-time.” Jian Wushuang was shocked and immediately realized that the space-time he was in had been completely sealed.

A huge force came directly toward him and sealed him.

Although Jian Wushuang had monstrous strength, he felt that he had nowhere to use it at this moment.

The power firmly sealed him, making it very difficult for him to move.

At this time, the Blood Phoenix on the other side had endless blood-colored flames surging on its body. The color of the blood-colored flames was darker than before, and it had even turned black and red.

The temperature of the black and red flames was even more astonishing.

“Bind!”

The Fire Phoenix also let out a cry, and in the next moment, endless black and red flames crazily covered this patch of the void.

Moreover, the moment the flames touched this patch of the void, they immediately fused perfectly with the space-time energy that acted on this patch of the void. In an instant, this patch of void started burning crazily.

Under the burning of the terrifying flame, everything was annihilated.

In the surrounding void, Long Xingzi and the others watched everything with a trace of coldness in their eyes.

When they saw that Jian Wushuang had been completely covered by the black-red sea of fire, a cold smile appeared on their faces.

“Although the sect-protecting formation of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is mainly used to defend against external enemies, and although it’s not very good in terms of offensive and killing, now that the four of us are driving the formation to evolve into a Golden Dragon and a Blood Phoenix, together with the Dragon-phoenix cry, even an ordinary Immortal Saint who has mastered the immortal body would find it difficult to resist it.”

“As for Jian Yi, although he has also mastered the immortal body, he is only a Divine Master and doesn’t have much divine power. Under this move, he won’t be able to hold on for long and his divine power will be completely exhausted. At that time, even if he has the immortal body, he will definitely die!” Long Xingzi sneered.

The three Immortal Saints and Long Xingzi also had the same thought.

They all thought that Jian Wushuang was dead for sure!

Even if he did not die, his divine power would be exhausted. Then they would kill him.

But at this moment, something unexpected happened!

Buzz!

A sword light suddenly lit up. It seemed to be able to tear the world apart.

After it appeared, it directly split the sea of fire where Jian Wushuang was in half. A large number of flames spread in all directions, revealing a wide passage.

At the end of the passage, a young figure holding a long sword slowly walked out.

“What?”

“He actually broke this move?”

“How is it possible? The most terrifying thing is not the burning of the Blood Phoenix’s flames, but the space-time imprisonment that comes with it. Under the space-time imprisonment, he should have been burned by the Blood Phoenix’s flames, but he actually broke free from the Golden Dragon’s space-time imprisonment?”

Long Xingzi and the other three were shocked.

They did not know that the space-time imprisonment of the Golden Dragon was indeed powerful. If it were any other Immortal Saint, he would not be able to resist the space-time imprisonment and would only be burned by the Blood Phoenix flame.

However, Jian Wushuang was different.

First, his divine power was extremely powerful.

Second, he was good at the space-time rules and had reached the level of the Immortal Saint.

Thirdly, and most importantly, he knew how to use such a space-time imprisonment skill. For example, the heaven-designated skill, which could freeze time and space, was much more profound than this space-time imprisonment skill. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang was very familiar with this skill, so he naturally knew how to break it.

Therefore, after falling into space-time imprisonment for only a moment, he directly broke free.

“Dragon and Phoenix cry is indeed a good technique, but unfortunately, it’s me.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and looked at the Golden Dragon and Blood Phoenix in front of him with a fierce look in his eyes.

Then, he slowly raised the longsword in his hand and slashed it.

This slash seemed to be an easy one, but, the moment it was slashed, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship, the supreme sword essence guided by the Blood Mountain Sword, and the power of the infinite sword tree in his body had been exerted to the extreme, buzz, buzz, buzz. Many space-time rules condensed together with the sword essence, forming one space-time blade after another.

More than 400 space-time blades were densely packed together, and these space-time blades had wholly merged with the sword essence.

The space-time rules and swordsmanship were perfectly combined!

The ninth move of space-time swordsmanship, Storm!

Boom!

A fierce wind suddenly swept up between heaven and earth. A colossal storm rose out of thin air in the void where Jian Wushuang’s sword essence was directed.

This storm contained more than 400 space-time blades and endless shocking sword essence. It was terrifying, and the storm had already swept toward Golden Dragon and Blood Phoenix.

Golden Dragon and Blood Phoenix seemed to have sensed the terrifying power contained in this storm and wanted to flee at once.

However, the storm was too fast, at least more quickly than their fleeing speed.

Moreover, the storm was getting bigger and bigger as it swept through.

The Golden Dragon and the Blood Phoenix did not escape far before they were swept into the storm. But, then… under the endless killing power, the Golden Dragon and the Blood Phoenix did not struggle much before they were directly crushed into pieces. Then, they turned into a sky full of power and returned to the sect-protecting array.

“How could this be?”

Long Xingzi and the others behind them were shocked when they saw this scene.

The Golden Dragon and Blood Phoenix formed by the sect-protecting formation fully guided by the four of them were mighty. They should have been able to fight against a true saint who had an immortal body, but Jian Wushuang crushed them?
