Chapter 2678: Purple Beast Alliance

“Dismiss them?” The Heaven Ultimate Gods from the Dragon Divine Gang stood gazing at each other.

“We have already planned on yielding to the Purple Beast Alliance. Our Dragon Divine Gang will naturally honor you as our leader If you manage to resolve the Purple Beast Alliance,” said the graceful red-clothed woman.

The purple-haired middle-aged man and the rest standing beside them also nodded—having the same thoughts as the graceful red-clothed woman.

“How much time is left from the due date the Purple Beast Alliance gave you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“We still have three days. A huge group of masters from the Purple Beast Alliance will arrive after three days if I’m not mistaken. The Purple Beast Alliance Master will also be here in person,” said the graceful red-clothed woman.

“I’ll come again three days later if that’s the case.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently and immediately left with his apparitions.

A racket immediately started in the meeting hall after Jian Wushuang left.

“Everybody, let’s discuss this. Can this person really get rid of the Purple Beast Alliance three days later?” The Heaven Ultimate Gods started discussing amongst themselves.

“Dong Xue, what do you think?” The purple-haired middle-aged man looked at the graceful red-clothed lady. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I have no idea.” The graceful red-clothed lady shook her head. “Although this Su Han is only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God, all of you’ve seen his strength displayed to the extent we’re unable to resist his attacks at all. He’s too fast and it’s very simple for him to kill us.

“He definitely can go up against an ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods with his speed. However, all of you know the Purple Beast Alliance Master’s strength. Not only is he a true Peak Heaven Ultimate God, but he’s also very powerful such that our previous gang master died in his hands. Su Han won’t have a high possibility of winning if he goes against the Purple Beast Alliance Master but he’d at least be qualified to fight him.”

“Aren’t you just wasting your breath?” The purple-haired middle-aged man rolled his eyes.

“Haha... I cannot judge if this Su Han can really defeat the Purple Beast Alliance Master and make the alliance leave. However, I’m sure of one matter—it’s something between him and the Purple Beast Alliance while the Dragon Divine Gang retains its middle-ground. It has nothing to do with us if he’s really defeated or died in the hands of the Purple Beast Alliance Master. We only need to surrender to the Purple Beast Alliance after everything ends.”

“We’ll only need to surrender to him if he’s really strong and can make the Purple Beast Alliance leave with his power. Our Dragon Divine Gang won’t suffer any losses no matter the outcome,” said the graceful red-clothed woman called Dong Xue.

“That’s true.” All the Heaven Ultimate Gods around her nodded in agreement.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

The experts from Purple Beast Alliance really came attacking them once their time was up.

The Purple Beast Alliance was much stronger than the Dragon Divine Gang with almost 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods when it came to overall strength. The Purple Beast Alliance had gone all out at that moment. The Purple Beast Alliance Master had personally led around 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods along with many Peak Earth Ultimate Gods and arrived at the void on top of Dragon City.

More than 100 densely packed figures were standing in the void.

The Purple Beast Alliance Master was a more than two meters tall burly man with purple-colored armor. He was casually sitting on a huge purple-colored throne while engrossingly looking at the black fortress underneath him.

A petite old man asked, “Alliance Master, one month has gone by and there’s still no news from the Dragon Divine Gang. It looks like they don’t plan to surrender. Shall we directly take action?”

“There’s no hurry.” The Alliance Master waved his hand. “This Dragon Divine Gang is a third-rated clan. Although I’ve killed their gang leader, they still have many Heaven Ultimate Gods under their control. It’ll be a waste if we kill all these Heaven Ultimate Gods. We’d be able to include them into our Purple Beast Alliance if they proactively surrender and therefore once again increase our overall strength. Our Purple Beast Alliance will be considered extremely strong among the third-rated clans in the Danyang Continent by then.

“How about this, let’s give them another hour. We shall directly take action and wipe them out if they still aren’t making any moves within the next hour.”

“Noted.” The petite old man nodded before opening his mouth and spoke in an austere manner. “Those from the Dragon Divine Gang—your one-month time limit is up. Let us know if you choose to surrender or we’ll wipe you out. My alliance master has given his orders to grant you another hour. Our alliance will take action and wipe out your Dragon Divine Gang if you don’t respond after the hour.”

The austere voice which came from the Heaven Ultimate God’s mouth echoed mightily throughout the entire Dragon City.

Many Dragon Divine Gang experts gathered in a castle surrounded by the huge dragon located in the center of Dragon City. Each of them had a serious expression on their faces after hearing that voice.

“We only have one hour left, what should we do?” The purple-haired middle-aged man was extremely worried.

“Don’t panic, let’s see if Su Han will take action. We can just surrender in the end if he doesn’t,” said the graceful red-clothed woman, Dong Xue.

The Dragon Divine Gang experts could only suppress their fear and continued waiting there.

However, their wait did not last long as a figure slowly rose upward in Dragon City.

That figure’s appearance immediately caught those Dragon Divine Gang experts’ attention.

“It’s Su Han!!”

“He has finally appeared!”

“Let’s see if he can chase away the Purple Beast Alliance.”

The Dragon Divine Gang experts looked on in anticipation.

At the bottom of their hearts, they preferred surrendering to Su Han as the Purple Beast Alliance had previously killed their gang leader—making them resistant to the alliance as their previous gang leader had always treated them well.

Jian Wushuang had already appeared in the void and before those Purple Beast Alliance experts.

The Purple Beast Alliance experts also looked towards him but none paid him much attention as they noticed the divine power spreading from Jian Wushuang’s body was only at the High-level Heaven Ultimate God while their alliance had several High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“You’re the Purple Beast Alliance Master?” Jian Wushuang had an indifferent smile on his face as his sight directly landed on the Alliance Master sitting on the throne right in the middle of the crowd.

The Alliance Master glanced at Jian Wushuang but was too lazy to reply to him.

The petite old man beside the Alliance Master shouted in a deep voice. “You aren’t one of the High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods from the Dragon Divine Gang. Who are you?”

Jian Wushuang replied, “I’m Su Han. Unfortunately, I’ve set my eyes on the Dragon Divine Gang, hence the Purple Beast Alliance can only return to whence you came from.”

Jian Wushuang spoke as though nothing mattered. However, the petite old man immediately gave him a strict glance and said, “How dare you!!”

“Reckless idiot!”

“Where did this idiotic young man come from?”

The expressions of the Purple Beast Alliance experts turned cold.

The Purple Beast Alliance Master calmly said, “Kill him.”
