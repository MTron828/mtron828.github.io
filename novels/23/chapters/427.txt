Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bang!

As soon as Deng Huo entered the Jiushe Cave Mansion, he started searching desperately. Soon he found Lady Red who was building the Formation in the main shrine.

“There she is.” A coldness flashed in Deng Huo’s eyes.

Lady Red was establishing the complicated Formation. She needed to arrange it involving many areas within the cave mansion, including its main shrine.

Suddenly, a thunderous sound boomed. Lady Red turned and was astonished to find Deng Huo rushing towards her.

Before Deng Huo reached Lady Red, Jian Wushuang, who followed Deng Huo all the way, shot a looked at Deng Huo. Whoosh~~~ The vast blood Realm stretched and surrounded Deng Huo.

Suppressed by the Realm, Deng Huo slowed down a little.

“Triple Shift.”

Jian Wushuang shot forward like a Flowing Light.

Flying through the void with a residual shadow left in the air, he passed by Deng Huo and arrived before Lady Red first.

“Oh?” Deng Huo stopped and flashed a look of surprise at Jian Wushuang, “Nice speed.”

“Swordsman,” Lady Red was relieved after seeing Jian Wushuang.

“Leave him to me, continue your work.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.” Lady Red nodded and stepped back. She knew that there was nothing she could do for the fight.

“Who are you?” Deng Huo stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold and haughty face.

“Swordsman,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Swordsman? I have not heard about you.” Deng Huo shook his head, shot a disdainful look at Jian Wushuang, “You are not thinking you can stop me, are you?”

“How would I know if I don’t have a try?” Jian Wushuang said with a cold smile. At the same time, a powerful stream of battle intent arose.

A Heaven-defying Level.

This was the first time he had fought with a real expert of the Heaven-defying Level!

He had not dared to fight with an expert of Heaven-defying Level before. After the Jiushe Cave Mansion, he had comprehended the second move of Heart-killing Sword Technique and his offense had increased. Therefore, he was eager to fight against an expert of Heaven-defying Level.

“I want to know, how wide the gap between me and a real expert of Nature-defying Level is?”?Jian Wushuang licked his lips.

Seeing the battle intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, Deng Huo sneered, “Seeking death!”

After saying that, Deng Huo charged toward Jian Wushuang with a cyan saber in his hand and a big and tall Saber Soul Phantom on his back.

Heaven-defying experts had all generated “Souls”. For example, Deng Huo had built a Saber Soul.

It was nearly 20 meters high, which was a second-grade Saber Soul.

“Boy, show me whether you are able to survive my saber.” Deng Huo roared, raising his cyan saber and slashing at Jian Wushuang.

As if it was splitting the heavens.

With the blessings of his Saber Soul, it was powerful enough to frighten Stage Three experts.

However, Jian Wushuang was waiting for it with keen, sparkling eyes, “Good!”

Then he became serious. Two First-grade Sword Soul Phantoms rose behind him, which seemed much taller and bigger than Deng Huo’s. Jian Wushuang stepped forward and thrust his Triple-kill Sword.

The sword shadow rushed out like lightning. It was the second move of Heart-killing Sword Technique... Desperation!

A move with almost all his power.

It was powerful enough to impale a Stage Three expert’s body and hurt another one heavily.

Then the lighting sword shadow crashed with the blade light.

Boom!

The whole Jiushe Cave Mansion shook, and the horrifying power wave caused by their collision spread out overwhelmingly.

It shattered many stone stools, tables and decorations in the main shrine. In a blink of an eye, the main shrine was flattened, full of broken stone and dust.

Lady Red, who had retreated to the outside, was shocked after seeing the scene.

She knew she would have died if she had not escaped the wave.

In the center of the main shrine, the two forces separated after a good while, both Jian Wushuang and Deng Huo stepping back simultaneously.

Deng Huo came to a stop and looked at Jian Wushuang, seriously rather than disdainfully. When he saw the two Sword Soul Phantoms behind Jian Wushuang, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Double First-grade Sword Soul, it seems I underestimated you.”

He didn’t pay attention to Jian Wushuang until now.

But after a short fight, he was surprised by Jian Wushuang’s battle strength.

“The sword move he displayed was almost as powerful as mine, nearly reaching Nature-defying Level.”?Deng Huo thought secretly,?“I thought Bone King was the strongest among them, but didn’t expect that Swordsman is much stronger than Bone King.”

Bone King was just capable of fighting with him, he wouldn’t be a threat to Deng Huo.

But Jian Wushuang was much stronger than Bone King. It drew Deng Huo’s attention. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

During the last fight, Deng Huo could not establish an advantage over him.

“Deng Huo, you ‘re a top expert of Heaven-defying Level. Is this your strength?” Jian Wushuang stared at Deng Huo with furious eyes.

“You’re challenging me. As you wish.”

Deng Huo’s voice was cold. However, his battle strength was increasing and his white robe fluttered in the breeze. As he finished talking, he stepped forward. Whoosh~~~ A thrilling sonic boom spread in the void, he was more powerful than before.

“Is this your full strength?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, “That’s what I’m expecting.”

“Asura Secret Skill, Bridge of Helplessness!”

Boom!

The whole Jiushe Cave Mansion was shaken.

On the edge of the Blood River, a towering long blood bridge suddenly appeared, extending to the end of the river at an amazing speed. Jian Wushuang stood on the bridge. A large amount of blood-red energy gathered around his body, as if he was an Asura in a blood-red armor.

His battle strength jumped too, which was now no less than Deng Huo’s.
