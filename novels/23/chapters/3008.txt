Chapter 3009: Seal

——

In an ordinary city in the territory around the Golden Mountain Sect.

This city was quite prosperous. There were many cultivators, and they were all quite powerful.

In a tavern, a few cultivators were sitting at a table, chatting leisurely.

“Have you heard? The territory we’re in has been completely sealed off.”

“Sealed off?”

“I’ve heard about it as well. It’s said that all spatial passageways have stopped operating. The territory of more than a thousand cities around us has been completely sealed off by a layer of the array. and the cultivators within the array are only allowed to enter and not exit. It’s indeed completely sealed off.”

“Array? A few days ago, I sensed a golden light suffusing out from the void. Could it be that golden light?”

“Yes, it’s that golden light. I heard that it was an order personally given by the Magic Note King. All the upper echelons have participated in it. Their goal is to kill an expert. To be precise, it’s an important criminal.”

“Even the king has been alarmed? What’s the background of that person?”

The tavern was not noisy, to begin with. Upon hearing the conversation of the four, many people gathered around.

Soon, the whole tavern began to talk about this matter.

No one noticed that a gold-robed man was sitting quietly by the window at the edge of the tavern, holding a glass of wine. His expression was indifferent as if he did not fit in with the noise around him.

But in his heart…Jian Wushuang felt extremely strange.

“He has directly sealed off more than 1,000 cities in an area and stopped all the spatial passageways in this area. He wants to completely trap me here and not give me a chance to escape.” Jian Wushuang praised in his heart.

When he had escaped from the Gold Mountain Sect, the first thing he wanted to do was to use the spatial passages to leave this place. He did not expect that all the spatial passages would stop working.

He had no choice but to hide in this city for the time being. Then he heard that the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had sealed off this area.

“It’s definitely not enough to seal off this area. If nothing goes wrong, the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom will find a way to thoroughly search this territory and find me at all costs,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Although he knew this, he was not worried at all.

Because the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom would definitely treat him as a True Saint and an Immortal Saint no matter what.

If he was really an Immortal Saint, it would be easier to find him hiding in this area. However, he was just a Divine Master.

There were thousands of cities in this area. How many Divine Masters were there? It was an astronomical figure.

Even Great Divine masters were countless.

He was only one of the so many people, so it was not easy to find him.

Moreover, when he met the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, he had worn a special costume of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. That costume had changed his aura. Now that he was not wearing that costume, the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom could not recognize him at all.

Even those Golden Mountain Sect disciples who had met him before…when Jian Wushuang had fled, he had deliberately controlled his facial muscles to change his appearance. Now, even if those Golden Mountain Sect disciples were standing in front of him, they might not be able to recognize him.

Under such circumstances, who would recognize him as the important criminal?

“Although the people of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom can not find me, it’s troublesome to be locked in this area.” Jian Wushuang shook his head slightly. “Forget it, I’ll find a place to cultivate first.”

After leaving the tavern, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at a secret room.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang was sitting alone with his legs crossed. His eyes were shining with a strange light. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Although I didn’t feel too much pressure from being chased this time, after experiencing a chase, I was also somewhat stimulated. I feel that the bottleneck in my body has loosened a little. Let’s prepare to take a look first.” Jian Wushuang smiled, soon, he closed his eyes.

Time passed, and a month passed in the blink of an eye.

During this month, just as Jian Wushuang had expected, the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom searched the cities and territories continuously in order to find him.

And now, the search had come to the city where he was.

In the void, several figures were floating side by side. These figures all had extremely powerful auras.

The Magic Note Divine Kingdom was located in a relatively prosperous place in endless territories. It controlled a total of 36 territories and had many experts. There were more than 100 experts at the True Saint-level alone, and this person had killed Jian Wushuang, the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had made a big move. Now, there were more than 60 True Saints who had rushed to this sealed area.

There were many True Saints in charge of searching the various cities. For example, the few people that appeared in the sky above this city were all True Saints.

Buzz, buzz, buzz.

Vast soul power spread out from the bodies of these few True Saints, covering the entire city below.

“There are many cultivators in this city, but there isn’t a single Immortal Saint. As for Divine Master level experts, there are countless of them. However, there are only about 200 people above the Divine Master level,” a purple-robed woman said.

“Although that person’s strength is tyrannical, and his combat strength is close to that of a third-level True Saint, his ability to conceal his aura is very impressive. All this time, the divine power and aura he has displayed are only at the Divine Master level. Therefore, those Divine Master are within our search range,” a tall man over two meters tall said coldly.

“Forget about those ordinary Divine Master. As long as they are at the Divine Master level or above, call them over and conduct a divine power inspection one by one.”

“Mm.” The violet-robed woman nodded.

The next moment…

“All cultivators at the Divine Master level or above, come over. Anyone who disobeys will die!”

The violet-robed woman’s icy cold voice that carried boundless might reverberated throughout the entire city.

The entire city immediately began to stir. As for the cultivators at the Divine Master level or above in the city, when they sensed this divine might, they trembled in shock and did not dare to disobey it in the slightest. One figure after another rose into the air, in the blink of an eye, more than 200 cultivators above the Divine Master level in the city had gathered here.

Jian Wushuang was also in the crowd.

At this moment, the purple-clothed woman took out a special crystal.

“That crystal…is it for the divine power test?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted slightly.

He recognized this crystal. It was a special crystal used to test the divine power level of a cultivator.

Under normal circumstances, as long as the cultivator’s divine power poured into the crystal, the crystal would have a reaction. Based on the reaction, one could know the specific level of the cultivator. No matter how good the cultivator was at concealing his aura…in front of this divine power test stone, there was no hiding.
