Chapter 567: Returning to the Wu Yan Tribe

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It should take the Temple Masters a much longer time to arrive at Blood Moon Plain from the Holy Place than from Heaven Wing City. However, Temple Master Black Spirit still arrived before the other two.

“Temple Master Iceberg, did you come here from the Holy Place?” Temple Master Black Feather shot him an odd glance and asked.

“No, I happened to be near the plain,” Temple Master Iceberg answered flatly.

“Oh?” Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea exchanged a glance, but they did not question him further. They turned to Jian Wushuang and said, “Are you Sword Emperor?”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath before walking to them. “Yes, I’m Jian Wushuang. I pay my respect to you, Temple Masters.”

Jian Wushuang bowed to all the masters except Temple Master Iceberg.

He had spotted Temple Master Iceberg’s killing intent.

“He gave up killing me and turned to kill the monster spies because he realized that Temple Master Black Spirit had arrived. If she hadn’t come or had come just a little bit later, I would have been killed.”?A sliver of light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Jian Wushuang.” Temple Master Black Spirit spoke.

Immediately, the other masters shut their mouth.

“I learned of this situation from Daofeng. If I’m right, this was a special trap that the monster spies set for you. They killed so many human warriors near the Wu Yan Tribe in order to draw you out of the Holy Place and kill you,” Temple Master Black Spirit continued.

Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

Normally, monster spies would hide from human experts, so he had been quite confused when he heard about the monster spies’ cruel crimes near the Wu Yan Tribe. At this point, he finally realized that it was all a trap.

“Were those spies mad? They killed so many people just to draw you out into this trap? Even though you’re talented, you’re still only an outsider,” said Temple Master Black Feather with an odd expression.

“All right. Whatever it was they wanted, they are dead now. ” Temple Master Black Spirit looked toward Jian Wushuang. “I believe that only a few of their forces are still left in our Human Territory. So, in the near future, they won’t be able to organize another assassination attempt on you.

“Jian Wushuang, you can pay the Wu Yan Tribe a visit before going back to the Holy Place, but once you return I want you to come see me. I have something to ask you.”

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After giving out that order, Temple Master Black Spirit turned around and left. Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea also left, returning to Heaven Wing City.

As for Temple Master Iceberg, he shot Jian Wushuang a chilling glance before leaving.

Now, only Jian Wushuang still remained on the plain.

He looked grim.

“I was too careless.”

He had thought that there were few who could threaten his life in Human Territory, but he had underestimated the power of the monsters.

It never occurred to him that the monsters would arrange such a powerful force to kill him.

Temple Master Iceberg’s sudden appearance was also beyond his expectations.

He had known that Temple Master Iceberg wanted to kill him, but he had not expected him to take action while they were still inside the Human Territory. Without Temple Master Black Spirit’s help today, Jian Wushuang might have already died.

“Danger lies everywhere on the road of cultivation, and every step on it should be taken with caution. No matter where I go, I should never let my guard down.

“After all, I won’t have a second chance at life.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists. This trap had taught him a valuable lesson.

With those thoughts in mind, he headed towards the Wu Yan Tribe.

In the monster spies’ information center, the black-robed elder received the news of his men failing to kill Jian Wushuang as soon as Temple Master Black Spirit killed the spies.

“Failed.”

“Even with 80 percent of our forces in Human Territory gathered at the Blood Moon Plain, they still failed to kill Jian Wushuang. Master Ji even lost his life.

“Trash, a group of trash!”

The elder roared, his eyes covered with streaks of blood.

A good while later, the elder finally calmed down.

“The loss of those spies will largely weaken our power inside the Human Territory. I must be more cautious from this moment on.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor must be enraged by the news.”

Thinking of this, the elder shuddered.

The Wu Yan Tribe used to be a busy place, but since monster spies started killing humans and destroying villages, the people there had become alarmed and frightened.

When Jian Wushuang arrived at the entrance of the tribe, the gate was shut. The whole place was heavily guarded.

“Luckily, the Wu Yan Tribe is safe.”

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief and passed over the gate through the air.

“Who’s there?”

When they spotted Jian Wushuang moving through the air, the clansmen immediately shouted at him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

However, they looked surprised when they finally got a clear look at Jian Wushuang’s face.

“It’s Master Wushuang!”

“Our hero, Sword Emperor, came back!”

“Look, guys, Sword Emperor came back!”

The place went into an uproar upon Jian Wushuang’s arrival. Almost everyone came out of their homes, full of excitement as they welcomed Jian Wushuang back.

Two months ago, the people from every corner of this tribe all heard that Jian Wushuang had killed Emperor Golden Snake and become a new Divine Emperor in the Monster-exterminating League.

For them, it was a miracle that Jian Wushuang could kill a Divine Emperor when he was only in the Saint Realm.

They did not care that their hero was an outsider. All that mattered to them was that they were both humans and that Jian Wushuang had joined their tribe.
