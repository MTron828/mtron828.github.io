Chapter 2952: Discovery

——

“Haha, Third Saint Umbra, I’d like to see if you’re dead or not!” Xue Dong King laughed coldly.

The cold elder’s body trembled as if he had gone mad. His scarlet eyes also looked at Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King were in the middle of him. The cold Elder knew very well that in this situation, he had no chance of survival.

“Xue Dong King, and you… Good! Good! I, the third Shadow Saint, have dominated the endless territories for so many years. Today, I am finally defeated by you. However, although we three brothers are dead, you will not have a good time!” The cold Elder shouted.

“Humph!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King had already stepped forward. With their combined efforts, the cold elder was killed in an instant.

But before he was killed, a message was sent out from the cold Elder’s hand.

…

In the void, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King stood side by side,

“The three Shadow Saints are dead,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“It’s all thanks to you, Brother Heavenly Marquis. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be so easy to kill the three brothers.” Xue Dong King chuckled, “It’s a good thing that I asked you to complete this three-star mission. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been easy for me to kill the three Shadow Saints alone.”

“Compared to those below the true saint realm, this ordinary three-star mission is indeed a little difficult.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

This mission was to kill the three Shadow Saints, but Jian Wushuang also saw the strength of the three Shadow Saints.

It was too difficult for an ordinary Peak False Saint to complete this mission.

Even for an existence like Xue Dong King, who was infinitely close to a True Saint, it was also a bit difficult to face such a mission.

“Brothers of the Heaven Marquis, since the three Shadow Saints are dead, let’s distribute the resources and treasures in their interspatial rings,” Xue Dong King suggested.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The two immediately began to distribute the treasures.

The three Shadow Saints were real immortal saints and had collected a lot of resources. They had obtained a lot of resources, but unfortunately, they did not have any precious treasures in their interspatial rings.

“The task is completed. Brother Heavenly Marquis, Let’s go back,” Xue Dong King said.

“Don’t worry.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand to stop him.

“What’s wrong?” Xue Dong King looked at him.

“Have you noticed that the place where the three Shadow Saints live, the palace below, is a bit special?” Jian Wushuang said.

“The palace is special?” Xue Dong King was stunned and immediately covered it with his soul power.

“This palace… is nothing special except for a layer of special restriction at the bottom,” Xue Dong King said.

“It’s the special restriction,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice. “The restriction is at the bottom of the palace, which means it’s underground. If I saw such an underground restriction, I would think that there is a secret chamber. The third Saint Shadow was in seclusion in the secret chamber, so he specially set up a restriction to prevent anyone from disturbing him.”

“But now, the third Saint Shadow has come out, and no one is in the secret room. Why is the restriction still open?”

“If it’s really just a restriction covering the secret room, they can use some of the restrictions at will. With their strength, even if they set up a restriction casually, no one should be able to break it in the secret shout domain. But look at the layer of restrictions below, it’s very powerful. Most importantly, the restriction has the ability of confusion and concealment, so you and I can’t see what’s on the other end of the restriction. That’s strange.”

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Xue Dong King also revealed a strange expression.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, are you saying that there is a secret hidden on the other side of the restriction?” Xue Dong King asked.

“I don’t know, but since we have found something strange there, there is no harm in going to take a look. Let’s go down.” Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately headed down to the palace.

The palace used to be where the third Shadow Saint’s clan lived. There were a lot of maids and servants in the palace, but now because of the death of the third Shadow Saint’s clan, the maids and servants were scared and fled in all directions, of course, they were both surprised and delighted at the same time.

The strength of the third Shadow Saint’s clan meant that they could finally get rid of the hands of the three demons.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King had already appeared at the bottom of the palace, in front of the restriction.

“This restriction does look powerful.” Xue Dong king looked at the restriction in front of him and waved the long saber in his hand. An extremely domineering saber light directly broke the restriction in front of him.

When the restriction was broken, many things hidden under the restriction were immediately exposed to Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King.

When they swept their soul power, they were stunned.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Their figures appeared next to a pool as if they had teleported.

It was called a pool, but there was no water in it. Instead, there were all kinds of black mud. In the center of the pool, which was the center of the survivors, there was an earthy yellow fruit tree, on the tree, there was an earthy yellow fruit the size of a baby’s head.

The earthy yellow fruit emitted a special fragrance. The fruit was surrounded by a hazy earthy yellow energy. Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King both recognized this energy. It was the power of the law of the earth.

“What a rich power of the law of the Earth. What kind of treasure is this fruit?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

“Tut, tut, no wonder it was covered with restriction. There is such a fruit hidden here.” Xue Dong King also praised, “I don’t know what this fruit is, but judging from the power of earth rules covered on the surface of the fruit, it must be a treasure that is very useful for comprehending the earth rules.”

“It’s a treasure, and its value should be extraordinary.” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly, but then his expression became strange. “No, there’s something wrong with this fruit. If I’m not wrong, it should not be fully ripe.”

“Not fully ripe?” Xue Dong King was stunned, but then he understood.

It was indeed not fully ripe.

If it had been fully ripe, the third Saint would not have let it stay here. It would have picked it long ago.

“I see. No wonder three Shadow Saints would close all the space passages leading to the outside world and completely cover the entire Dark Shout Realm with restrictions. It turns out that he did not want to make the Dark Shout Realm a better paradise for them, but for this fruit. They were worried that a powerful Immortal Saint would come to the Dark Shout Realm and discover the fruit, so they simply sealed the realm completely!” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.
