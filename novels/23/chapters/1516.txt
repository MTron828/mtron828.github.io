Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The speed at which Jian Wushuang and Xin Zhu were fighting was too fast. Moreover, the two of them were very powerful. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Although there were many Universe Gods near them, no one could interfere.

After seeing one of them chasing the other, a big portion of the Universe Gods followed as well. However, some of the Universe Gods stayed behind and chose not to follow.

“Too strong!”

“Be it Jian Wushuang or Xin Zhu, they are not people that we can stop. Hence, it will be almost impossible to snatch White Blaze Fruits from them.”

“There are so many Universe Gods. Even if Jian Wushuang is really killed in the end, the White Blaze Fruits will definitely not fall into my hands. Forget it.”

For the Universe Gods who did not give chase, most of them were shocked by the abilities of Jian Wushuang and Xin Zhu.

However, although they did not give chase, they sent a message at once to spread the case to the outside world.

In no time, countless Universe Gods in the cave were astonished.

On the island outside the cave, in the big hall.

Many Almighties, and the experts representing the various forces, gasped continuously when they received the news.

“One person has obtained a total of nine White Blaze Fruits. This Jian Wushuang is really greedy.”

“This cannot be called greedy. We can only say that his luck is good. After all, how can one not take it when something good is placed in front of him?”

“No matter what, this Jian Wushuang has now become a target of criticism of everyone and he is also the favorite person of all the Universe Gods.”

Favorite person!

Indeed, Jian Wushuang was a popular person.

From the time that Wu Bei’s cave had appeared to the current moment, quite a number of White Blaze Fruits had appeared as well. However, apart from Jian Wushuang, the luckiest person had only been able to acquire three White Blaze Fruits.

However, Jian Wushuang possessed nine White Blaze Fruits.

Hence, it would be strange if the Universe Gods who did not acquire even one White Blaze Fruit were not envious of him.

“Lei Chao, your Lineage of Star has made it big this time round,” a Real God who was beside Lei Chao jeered.

“It is still too early to say this now. Although Jian Wushuang has obtained nine White Blaze Fruits, we still don’t know if he will be able to bring those White Blaze Fruits out,” Lei Chao said earnestly.

“You’re right,” the Real God shook his head as well, “With nine White Blaze Fruits, the Universe Gods in the cave will definitely try to kill him with all their might. Even the monsters in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list will want to kill him. Under such circumstances, it will be difficult for him to bring all nine White Blaze Fruits out.”

“If I were Jian Wushuang, I would be slightly smarter and give up a few White Blaze Fruits. With that, nothing would happen to me.”

Many experts in the big hall were having a discussion and most of them had a relaxed expression.

Only Lei Chao was extremely anxious.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Lei Chao had sent a message to Jian Wushuang, “Remember, if the situation is dangerous, you can give up on a few White Blaze Fruits. To the Lineage of Star, acquiring two or three White Blaze Fruits from this fight is considered good. We don’t expect too many of them. Do not throw your life away for the White Blaze Fruits.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. He was very clear about that in his head.

If there were no choice, he would give up what was necessary without hesitation.

However, at that moment, he had not reached such a state.

“This Xin Zhu is really persistent!”

Jian Wushuang shot a glance behind him. Ten thousand miles away from him, Xin Zhu was flapping a pair of black wings that he had created using his Power of Consciousness and he was still giving chase. Although he was unable to catch up to Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang also found it difficult to lose him. As for the other Universe Gods, Jian Wushuang had lost them at the back.

“I have already unleashed the first stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood. However, this is only enough to ensure that he doesn’t catch up to me. To lose him completely, I would need to use the second stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

However, the key point was that it was not easy to use the second stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood. After all, it would deplete a huge amount of Divine Power. By maintaining it for just a short period of time, he would exhaust almost all of his Divine Power, and even the recovery ability of the King of Venomous Worms would be unable to recover his Divine Power in a short amount of time.

In an environment like this cave, as soon as his Divine Power was completely depleted, it would definitely become a disaster for him.

“If it’s just Xin Zhu alone, it’ll still be all right. However, the problem is…” as Jian Wushuang was thinking, his eyes turned serious abruptly. He had sensed a powerful aura that had appeared within the detecting range of his Soul Power.

That was a purple-haired young man with a stern face and his aura was a lot more powerful than the Universe Gods’, including Xin Zhu that Jian Wushuang had seen previously.

“That’s… Zi Dongwang!” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned unusually ugly.

Xin Zhu alone was already very difficult to deal with. At that moment, Zi Dongwang, who was even more difficult to deal with than Xin Zhu, had appeared.

It should be known that Zi Dongwang was a super monster who ranked second on the Universe God ranking list and he was only second to the God Destroying King who ranked first.

“Haha. Looks like my luck is not too bad.”

Zi Dongwang’s hearty, loud laughter reverberated across the whole horizon. His eyes had already locked onto Jian Wushuang. There was also a purple, evil aura around his body which caused his speed to become very fearsome. When he unleashed his speed, it would be slightly faster than Jian Wushuang and Xin Zhu’s.

“Oh no,” Jian Wushuang started to panic.

He had seen Zi Dongwang’s information thoroughly and knew very well that with his current abilities, he would be unable to compete with Zi Dongwang. To make matters worse, if Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu were to team up, he would have no choice but to escape shamefully.

“Zi Dongwang,” Jian Wushuang started to speak, “Let’s do a trade. If I give you three White Blaze Fruits, you will leave straight away. Deal?”

“Three fruits?” Zi Dongwang was astonished. He would be given three White Blaze Fruits if he left. Hence, Jian Wushuang could be said to be very generous.

“Jian Wushuang, you are smart. However, what I want is not merely three but six White Blaze Fruits. If you agree to this, I will leave straight away,” Zi Dongwang said loudly.

“Six fruits? Zi Dongwang, you are too greedy!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

He had finally acquired nine White Blaze Fruits after risking his life in Wu Bei’s cave. At that moment, Zi Dongwang didn’t need to do anything but leave. However, for that, he asked for six White Blaze Fruits. This was not just greedy, it was absolutely crazy.

“No deal? Then don’t blame me!” Zi Dongwang laughed coldly. The distance between him and Jian Wushuang was becoming shorter.

“Zi Dongwang, Jian Wushuang is not weak. If you don’t team up with me, you alone might be unable to kill him,” Xin Zhu’s voice could be heard abruptly.

“Xin Zhu, what are you trying to say?” Zi Dongwang looked over.

“Very simple. If you and I team up, this Jian Wushuang will die for sure. After that, the nine White Blaze Fruits shall be equally split between us. At the very least, you would get five and I would give four,” Xin Zhu said.

“Hmph, I have already said. I want six White Blaze Fruits!” Zi Dongwang bellowed.

“You are really unreasonable. Six White Blaze Fruits it shall be then, but give me the three remaining White Blaze Fruits!” Xin Zhu said.

“No problem,” Zi Dongwang nodded his head.

The two experts had reached a consensus.
