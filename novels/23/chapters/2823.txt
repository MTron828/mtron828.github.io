Chapter 2824: Great Disparity in Strength

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——————

The void was filled with a bone-chilling cold wind.

In front of them was a vast expanse of snow-white, endless glaciers that stretched as far as the eye could see.

This was the Ice Field, the boundary between the Pill Sun Sacred World and the Heaven Void World!

In the void, countless figures stood there, the cold wind blowing, but no one felt cold or uncomfortable.

These people were, of course, many experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World, led by Yin Su’er and Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, all of them were focused on the void in front of them.

“They’re here!” Yin Su’er suddenly said.

The experts present all became serious..

Under everyone’s gaze, an orderly army slowly flew over from the void in front of them.

This army was not large, only a few thousand people. However, every single soldier in the army exuded an extremely powerful aura. Most importantly, these auras were all connected to each other, forming a complete entity.

They were all wearing silver battle armors. Under the illumination of the glacier below, they looked awe-inspiring. They were clearly a huge army, with more than a thousand people. However, they gave off the feeling that they were just one person. They rushed over from afar at the same speed, when they got close, they stopped in unison.

Then, the army of more than 1,000 soldiers raised their heads at the same time, and a murderous aura suddenly swept out.

This murderous aura was so strong that even the great divine masters in the camp of the Pill Sun Sacred World could not help changing their expressions when they felt it.

“What a powerful army!” Jian Wushuang was also secretly amazed.

This was a truly invincible army.

It had not even started yet, but the feeling it gave people was completely different.

The Divine Sword Army that he created might look like it was made up of elite Divine Masters, but there were some military formations. In fact, Jian Wushuang knew very well that the combat strength of the Divine Sword Army was not just one or two levels lower than that of the Heavenly Void Army.

After all, the Divine Sword Army had not been established for a long time and had experienced a lot of killing.

However, the Heavenly Void Army was different. It had been established a long time ago. It had followed the Master of the Heavenly Void Palace to expand its territory. It had experienced countless killings, replaced generations of experts, and was still able to stay in the Heavenly Void Army, not only were they powerful, but they were also the best of the best. The key was their cooperation and tacit understanding, which was far from what an ordinary army could compare with.

Even if it was the Crimson Rock Army at its peak, they might still be able to barely compete with the Heavenly Void Army, but now… they were still far from it.

Seeing the Heavenly Void Army appear in the sky, the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World’s camp all had solemn expressions.

Yin Su’er’s gaze sank. “Something’s wrong!”

“What’s wrong?” Yun Shan, Palace Master Si Zhen, and the others immediately looked over.

“The aura of the divine power isn’t right.” Yin Su’er immediately said, “According to the information I received, that Heavenly Void Palace Master only ordered to gather half of the Heavenly Void Army, which is a thousand people. A thousand-man army should only have a hundred Great Divine Masters. But now, I can sense more than a hundred and fifty Great Divine Masters’ auras from the opposing camp, close to a hundred and sixty!”

Hearing this, Yun Shan and the others immediately released their soul power and started to sense it.

The result was obviously the same as Yin Su’er’s.

“There are close to 160 Great Divine Masters’ auras, what’s going on?” Palace Master Si Zhen frowned.

“If I’m not wrong, not only did that Heavenly Void Palace Master send the Heavenly Void Army, he also sent a portion of Great divine lords from the Heavenly Void Palace. In addition to Chen Kong and the others who had been staying in our Pill Sun Sacred World, he only managed to gather close to 160 great divine lords.” Yin Su’er said in a low voice.

As soon as these words were said, all the experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World sucked in a breath of cold air.

There were close to 160 Great Divine Masters?Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Was this a joke?

Moreover, they quickly sensed that among the 160 Great Divine Masters, only 60% were beginner Great Divine Masters. The rest of them were Advanced Great Divine Masters and Peak Great Divine Masters.

Especially the peak great divine paragons. When they counted them one by one, they discovered that there were a total of 15 peak great divine paragons from the Heavenly Void Temple!

15 Peak Great Divine Masters, 140 Advanced and beginner Great Divine Masters, and an Invincible Heavenly Void Army!

Their lineup was actually this powerful?

Looking at the turn of events in the Pill Sun Sacred World, even though Yin Su’er had been trying her best to rope in experts from various factions to participate in the battle, it was too short of time after all. Furthermore, Crimson Rock Castle’s wechat was already insufficient. Up until now, only about 70 Great Divine Masters had been persuaded, including those from Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Alliance, there was only about 70 Great Divine Masters present.

That’s right, there were about 70 Great Divine Masters. In terms of quality… most of them were just beginner Great Divine Masters. This was all that Yin Su’er could gather.

As for the number of Divine Masters, there were quite a number of them. The Crimson Rock Legion, the Divine Sword Legion, and the legions created by the four top factions had all been brought over. There were also four thousand Divine Masters legions that were temporarily formed by many Divine Masters from various factions.

However, although there were many Deity Masters, they did not cooperate with each other. They had the experience of fighting together. If they were to really fight, their combat strength would probably be far inferior to the Heavenly Void Army that only had a thousand people.

The difference in strength between the two sides’ lineup was simply too great.

“Damn it. I originally thought that the Heavenly Void Army that only had a thousand people would arrive. With the combat strength that our Pill Sun Sacred World has gathered now, we should have the strength to fight. I did not expect that the Heavenly Void Temple Master would actually send more than fifty Great Deity Masters.” Yin Su’er clenched her teeth tightly.

50 Great Divine Masters? That was too much power.

The extra 50 Great Divine Masters were beyond her expectations and beyond the scope of the Sacred Sundan World.

Yin Su’er was not the only one. Many experts from the Sacred Sundan World had already figured out the difference in strength between their camps. All of them had ugly expressions on their faces.

Jian Wushuang was the only one who looked calm.

“There are nearly 160 Great Divine Masters. The Master of the Heaven Void Temple is quite generous.” Jian Wushuang even chuckled.

“Mr. Sword One, how can you still laugh when there is such a huge difference between the two camps? Do you have a way to deal with it?” Yun Shan, who was beside him, noticed the change in Jian Wushuang’s expression and immediately said.

“If you have a way to do it, you can just deal with it.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Mr. Sword One, this battle is not a trivial matter. It concerns the life and death of our Pill Sun Sacred World. If you have any preparations, please take them out as soon as possible,” Yin Su’er said anxiously.
