4303 Entry Qualification in Hand

“Then…who’s the first candidate?” Jian Wushuang picked up the teacup, sipped the tea, and asked calmly.

Lady Blue laughed when he heard this, but she didn’t answer. Instead, she asked, “You should have an answer in your heart, right?”

Jian Wushuang’s hand that was holding the teacup stopped. He pondered for a while, then put the teacup down. He turned to look at Lady Blue and said, “I’m the first candidate?”

“That’s right.” When Lady Blue said that he had already chosen the first candidate, Jian Wushuang’s guess was pretty close.

!!

As expected, Lady Blue nodded and replied, “Naturally, it’s you. Jian Wushuang, your performance on the Ancient Path of Stars has been seen by that Lord. He sent me an order a few days ago to give you the first place to enter the Great Clan Gathering.”

After she finished speaking, she stretched out her hand and smiled.

“Jian Wushuang, congratulations.”

Even though Jian Wushuang was mentally prepared, his heart could not help but skip a beat when he heard Lady Blue’s definite answer. He felt that it was a little unreal.

That was an entrance ticket to a Grand gathering of all races in the universe that was held once every fifty chaos cycles!

In the Great Clan Gathering, the Supremes of all clans would gather to discuss the great Dao of heaven and earth. According to the previous rules, an Ultimate Ruler like Jian Wushuang would not even have the chance to touch the threshold. However, Jian Wushuang had become the first person to enter the Great Clan Gathering!

Jian Wushuang could not help sighing with emotion. On the Ancient Path of Stars, countless people had left behind piles of corpses for such an illusory quota.

A general’s success was built on ten thousand bones.

Too many people had lost their lives on this Ancient Path of Stars. They had spent countless years and effort, coming from all over the world, all for the sake of getting a spot in the universe banquet of all races.

Everyone was looking forward to becoming the lucky one to be pampered. From then on, their cultivation would skyrocket and they would become famous in the universe.

They advanced wave after wave, eager to try.

However, except for a few people who stood at the peak, most of the Ultimate Rulers on the Ancient Path of Stars had become the stepping stones of others. In the end, they had helped others while they themselves had turned into a pile of yellow soil and withered bones. They had died and their Dao had disappeared. They had been forgotten by time.

Jian Wushuang was one of them. Fortunately, he finally got the qualification to enter the competition.

He took a deep breath and in the next moment, the emotion in his eyes disappeared and was replaced with determination.

“Thank you,” he said.

Jian Wushuang stretched out his hand and shook Lady Blue’s hand.

Seeing this, Lady Blue smiled and withdrew his palm. A white jade pendant appeared under his right hand.

Jian Wushuang, this jade pendant is the invitation to the Great Clan Gathering. Lady Blue pushed the jade pendant with his right hand and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded and took the jade pendant carefully. He lowered his head and looked at it.

There were no words on the jade pendant. It was cool to the touch, as if it was an ordinary item. However, the moment Jian Wushuang felt it, he was shocked.

He felt as if he was in chaos. At this time, the universe had yet to be born and the world was still in a yin-yang chaos. He was like the most inconspicuous grain of sand in this chaos, insignificant to the extreme.

That feeling of being a drop in the ocean or a grain in Taicang was truly too insignificant.

The next moment.

The jade pendant turned into a warm current and disappeared into Jian Wushuang’s hand.

After that, the two of them chatted for a while. Lady Blue told him that the God Sealing Tablet had been cleared, and those who had obtained a spot in the universe banquet had to leave the Ancient Path of Stars to avoid affecting the fairness of others competing for the invitation.

After saying this, Lady Blue planned to leave. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Well, Jian Wushuang, you’ve received the invitation to the Great Clan Gathering. My task is complete, so I’ll take my leave.” Lady Blue stood up and said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded and looked at Lady Blue’s back as she left. He could not help but ask, “Lady Blue, if I may ask, what is your identity?”

Lady Blue’s steps, which had already crossed the threshold, could not help but pause. He turned around and smiled, “Is that important?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang touched his nose and knew that he had asked too much.

However, at this moment, Lady Blue smiled and added, “Jian Wushuang, we’ll meet again at the Great Clan Gathering.”

After saying that, Lady Blue no longer hesitated. In a flash, she disappeared at the door of Jian Wushuang’s Hall.

…

The moon splashed across the River of Stars, and the crows cried at midnight.

“Is it time to leave?”

Jian Wushuang stood at the entrance of the hall with his hands behind his back. He raised his head and looked at the devastating Galaxy unique to the Ancient Path of Stars. A thoughtful look flashed in his eyes.

He was now the most powerful being on the Ancient Path of Stars, and he had the ticket to the feast of all races in the universe. There was no point in staying here.

To him, leaving at this moment was indeed the best choice.

“But before I leave, I have to make arrangements for Sword Union.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and his eyes flickered.

After ten thousand years of development, the Sword Union had become quite well-known. There were more than a hundred top-tier Ultimate Rulers, and there were dozens of them who were almost invincible.

Besides Jian Wushuang, the Overlord, the Nine Stars Saint Son, and the young clan leader of Moluo were all unparalleled Rulers and could lead an area.

This kind of power, not to mention the Ancient Path of Stars, even in the universe, as long as a Supreme wasn’t present, it was enough to sweep everything in the world!

Although such a powerful force did not have strict sect rules, in the past ten thousand years, it had naturally formed a huge force with Jian Wushuang as the core. According to the division of strength, the status of the force was divided!

The next day, Jian Wushuang gathered all the high-level experts of Sword Union in the hall.

…

The next morning.

In the hall of the Sword Union, Jian Wushuang sat on the throne. On the two sides, starting from the Overlord and young clan leader Moluo, the high-level members of the Sword Union were arranged in rows.

Jian Wushuang was expressionless. Although he didn’t speak, a sharp pressure formed naturally and pressed down invisibly. Everyone in the hall lowered their heads and didn’t dare to look at Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The entire hall was silent.

No one dared to speak before Jian Wushuang did.

...

Unknowingly, Jian Wushuang was no longer the nameless person who could be manipulated by others. Now, he was the king who held the power of life and death in the entire Ancient Path of Stars!

He was the only powerful being on the Ancient Path of Stars who no one dared to disobey!
