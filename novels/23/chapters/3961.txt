Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Run!”

“Hurry up and run!”

“The gap is too big. There’s no way to fight them. Hurry up and run!”

“There are so many third-tier Rulers. If they want to kill us, it’s practically a massacre.”

The Rulers who were still alive under the command of the Devil Cloud Star were scared to the point of madness.

In just an instant, more than half of the hundreds of Rulers had been slaughtered, including many second-tier Rulers.

As for the three divine generals under Devil Cloud Star, one of them had fought against a Ruler of the other side. That Ruler was Thousand Kills Emperor Lord.

In the end, Thousand Kills Emperor Lord had only used one ax and this divine general was heavily injured on the spot.

If another two or three strikes were used, this divine general would probably be killed on the spot.

“Too powerful, too terrifying. This person isn’t even the strongest among them!” The heavily injured divine general looked at the Thousand Kills Emperor Lord in fear before turning to look at Demon Dragon Lord and Devil Scorpion Lord, he could tell that Demon Dragon Lord and Devil Scorpion Lord were even stronger than the heavily injured person before him.

To escape, the surviving Rulers of Devil Cloud Star had lost all will to fight and chose to flee at this moment.

However, even if they fled, the slaves under Jian Wushuang’s command were still madly chasing after them. They had killed many Rulers, and in the end, only less than 20 of the hundreds of Rulers escaped from the battlefield, when they returned to the back of Devil Cloud Star Master, the remaining people, including one divine general, were killed by Jian Wushuang’s slaves.

Although less than 20 of them had escaped with their lives, their bodies were still trembling and their faces were full of fear.

“We won!”

“Just as I expected, as long as all my slaves attack, they will be able to defeat Devil Cloud Star’s Rulers easily.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and looked at the battlefield in front of him, he was very satisfied.

“Haha, this is great! This is great!”

“So many Rulers have been killed in just a short while. It’s like cutting wheat.”

“Where did these dozens of experts come from? How come they are so ridiculously strong?”

The Rulers of the Divine Beginning Realm camp were still standing there, and most of them were in a daze.

Most of them did not know where these dozens of powerful Rulers came from, and most of them did not know that there was such a group of Rulers.

When they saw the Rulers under Devil Cloud Star’s command burst out with great power, these masters were terrified. However, who would have thought that the situation would be completely reversed in the blink of an eye.

“Xuan God, what’s going on?”

“Xuan God Palace Master.”

The invited Rulers from the Divine Beginning Realm camp all began to ask questions.

Daoist Xuan God laughed heartily and said, “Everyone, the Rulers you see now are all brought back by Blood Sword from a special place. They are all his servants.”

“Brought back by Blood Sword?”

“Servants?”

The Rulers of the Divine Beginning Realm were all shocked. They could not help looking at Jian Wushuang, who was behind the battlefield. Their gazes became even more respectful.

What a joke! If his servants were so powerful, how powerful was Blood Sword Master?

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The Rulers of Devil Cloud Star were defeated. The Rulers of the Divine Beginning Realm, including Jian Wushuang’s servants, also returned to Jian Wushuang’s back.

“Master, I’m glad I didn’t disappoint you,” Demon Dragon Lord said respectfully.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile on his face.

From the beginning of the battle, Jian Wushuang had carefully planned and planned.

What he planned was the Rulers under Devil Cloud Star.

He wanted to kill as many of the Rulers under Devil Cloud Star as possible, and if possible, kill all the Rulers who came with the Devil Cloud Star Army. In this way…even if he could not stop master Devil Cloud Star in the end, he would not be worried.

If there were no Rulers under the command of Master Devil Cloud Star, even if Devil Cloud Star won this battle and Jian Wushuang and the others retreated to the Divine Beginning Realm, there would be no Ruler to take care of Devil Cloud Star in the Divine Beginning Realm, it would be difficult for master Devil Cloud Star to carry out his plan. At the very least, it would buy Jian Wushuang a lot of time.

Therefore, he deliberately showed weakness in the beginning. He only asked the local Rulers of the Divine Beginning Realm, the Rulers who had been invited to this Star Field over the years, and the Principles Masters of the six realms to fight head-on, at the same time, he asked Daoist Xuan God to stay in the exquisite attic, where all 40 of his servants were staying. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When the time was right, Daoist Xuan God took out the attic in the center of the battlefield. His servants killed the Rulers of Devil Cloud Star in the shortest time possible, this made it so that even Devil Cloud Star Master, who was at the edge of the battlefield, could not come to his aid in time.

Although the final result was not too perfect, after all, more than ten Rulers of Devil Cloud Star’s lineage had escaped. Perhaps killing more than half of Devil Cloud Star’s Rulers was already a tremendous result.

“More than half of Devil Cloud Star’s Rulers have been killed, and the rest have been scared out of their wits. They won’t be able to attack for the time being. As for the Great Army of the Principles Masters…our Divine Beginning Realm’s side also has the advantage. It can be said that our Divine Beginning Realm’s side completely suppresses devil cloud star in terms of camp. We’ve already won half of this battle!” Daoist Xuan God clenched his hands, his eyes were shining brightly.

“Now, we just need to find a way to stop Devil Cloud Master and Shi Hua Divine Emperor. That’s enough.”

“Shi Hua Divine Emperor is easy to deal with,” Jian Wushuang said, “the information given by Ruler Chenyun is true. Although Shi Hua Divine Emperor is in the fourth level, his strength is average. The Immortal Dipper Battle Formation formed by my 36 slaves should be able to fight against him. The key is Devil Cloud Master!”

Jian Wushuang stared at the Devil Cloud Star Master through the void.

According to the information given by Ruler Chenyun, Shi Hua Divine Emperor’s combat strength was very certain, but the real strength of the Devil Cloud Star Master was very vague.

After all, the Devil Cloud Star Master had occupied a second-level astral world long ago and became the Master of the second-level astral world. He had not fought for a long time.

Not only that, but he had also been in closed-door cultivation in recent years. He had just made a breakthrough and reached the fourth level. Although he had just made a breakthrough, he had taken over the Divine Beginning Realm after all, with the help of the Divine Beginning Realm’s Heavenly Dao, no one could tell how strong he was.

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly raised his head and his pupils shrank.

Because he had already seen that Devil Cloud Star Master, who had been sitting lazily on the throne, had slowly stood up.

Devil Cloud Star Master was going to take action personally.
