Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In three months, he had killed five Real Gods!

Jian Wushuang’s existence already struck fear in all Real Gods in Sky Sword Prison. The Real Gods in Darkness Mountain who had attached themselves to Blood Emperor were seized by extreme fear.

However, just when Jian Wushuang had met the sixth Real God in Darkness Mountain and was killing the sixth Real God, Blood Emperor had finally arrived!

Blood Emperor had been searching for Jian Wushuang personally in Darkness Mountain when he had killed Real God Huo Yuan back then.

It was a pity that Darkness Mountain was rather huge. Jian Wushuang was quick in action and Blood Emperor couldn’t get there in time when he was killing the few previous Real Gods.

Until the sixth Real God….

In the spacious void, the breeze blowing was piercingly cold.

However, the air was static.

“Jian Wushuang, in three months, five Real Gods under my command were killed. You are really capable!” Blood Emperor’s gaze was cold, along with boundless murderous intentions, as he glared at Jian Wushuang.

“Just five Real Gods. Plus, although the five Real Gods were attached to you, there were no substantial benefits to you. Even if I killed them, what effect would it have to you, Blood Emperor?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Blood Emperor’s face grew dim.

Jian Wushuang made it sound so leisurely. Although there were no substantial effects to the five Real Gods’ death, what about his reputation?

The five Real Gods were an appendage to him and they were killed by Jian Wushuang directly in his territory. That had led to great disgrace to him.

Among the experts in Sky Sword Prison, it was probably the topic of conversation then. They were probably all making fun of him.

“As long as I kill you, everything will settle down,” Blood Emperor fixed his gaze at Jian Wushuang.

“True. It’d die down after you kill me and you’ll still be widely recognized as one of the overlords in Sky Sword Prison. As for the five Real Gods, there’ll definitely be other Real Gods to go under your command in the future. However, there’s only one problem,” Jian Wushuang looked at Blood Emperor with a cheeky smile, “That is… whether you can kill me.”

“You have a death wish!”

There was a sharp gleam in Blood Emperor’s eyes. Roar. There was a fierce aura soaring up, then his body immediately rose and turned into a three meter tall crimson figure, covered in blood.

A terrifying, imposing manner swept out.

Wow!

There was crimson light that plunged through the void. It was extremely creepy. It was as though the entire universe was drowning in a prison of blood.

“Blood Emperor!”

Jian Wushuang glared at the incoming Blood Emperor with his bright, sparkly eyes as he plastered a bloodthirsty smile across his face.

Vroom. There was an enormous amount of crimson flame which flooded in and formed a vast crimson ocean while Jian Wushuang was the King of the crimson ocean.

Simultaneously, an enormous amount of blazing quicksand flowed out.

Scarlet Kingdom and Blazing Quicksand were performed at the same time!

Over the course of three thousand years, Jian Wushuang’s Scarlet Kingdom had improved under the Fiery King’s guidance. He could already perform the third stage of Scarlet Kingdom then.

As he performed the mighty Scarlet Kingdom, Jian Wushuang’s power increased by double.

He moved and there were nine shadows that appeared all of a sudden.

Then, Jian Wushuang immediately wielded his sword.

“Ninth Heaven Stroke!”

Swoosh!

A boundless sword intention soared to the highest heaven. The moment the sword intention exploded, Blood Mountain Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand suddenly increased in size. Then, a towering sword shadow appeared in the void. The sword shadow carried a boundless sword intention just like a Nemesis Sword.

Along with the operation of Jian Wushuang’s divine power, the Nemesis Sword swung out.

“Nine Shade Crimson Knife!”

Blood Emperor let out a low roar too. As his figure moved, a significant horrifying crimson blade light revealed. There were crimson shadows on the crimson blade light, moving just like moving ghosts that were extremely creepy.

Suddenly, the two collided.

Dang!

The collision of fierce force made Jian Wushuang’s face grow grave. He retreated a few steps. Roar roar roar. There were roars reverberating in the universe simultaneously. Then, there was a demonic dragon that was formed by nine strips of Soul Power plunging in the direction of Blood Emperor along with boundless imposing aura.

“Go!”

Blood Emperor waved casually and there was no blade shadow. Only a crimson light glided past. The nine demonic dragons shattered into pieces altogether.

The void before Jian Wushuang suddenly shattered and the three meter tall crimson man that Blood Emperor had taken the shape of suddenly appeared from nowhere. Then, there was a crimson claw that clawed at Jian Wushuang’s head at lightning speed. In the end, it pierced Jian Wushuang’s head but there was no blood nor brains that flushed out.

“A shadow?” Blood Emperor felt his pupils contract.

Jian Wushuang’s figure was already next to Blood Emperor. Then, Jian Wushuang’s body was tense in a bow shape as he gripped Blood Mountain Sword tightly. He looked like he was well prepared.

“Ten Thousand Shadows!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Countless sword lights suddenly erupted. Every sword light was unbelievably fast and the power was terrifying. In that instant, there were hundreds of sword lights that were cast. The hundreds of sword lights were aiming at Blood Emperor’s throat, heart, skull and the other vital parts.

Every sword light’s angle was tricky.

Ten Thousand Shadows was like Ninth Heaven Stroke, they were created during Jian Wushuang’s training in the past three thousand years. They were Real God unique skills.

Jian Wushuang had only created three Real God unique skills by then. Besides those two, there was Crimson Light that he previously created.

Due to the limitation of his level, the three Sword Principles were merely beginner Real God unique skills. However, they were entirely different in nature.

Ninth Heaven Stroke, also known as Nemesis Sword, carried boundless sword intention. It focused on absolute power.

Ten Thousand Shadows was more suitable for close combat. Hundreds of sword lights launched attacks at one’s vital parts at the same time, so it was hard to guard against.

Crimson Light was a combination of speed and power. It’d be more suitable if it were to be used for surprise attack.

At the moment the countless swordlights erupted, the vigor in Blood Emperor’s body churned and formed a huge crimson beast. The crimson beast blocked Blood Emperor. Not only did it block all the sword lights, it also let out an angry bellow and charged towards Jian Wushuang. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang’s body flashed creepily and he shook off the crimson beast with ease.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, it seems that I have belittled you. In three thousand years, your power has increased to the current stage. It seems that even if it is me, I have to perform some tricks to be able to kill you!” Blood Emperor’s cold voice reverberated across the universe.

“Go ahead and perform all sort of tricks,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew extremely solemn.

“If so, then you, prepare to die!” There was a glimpse of murderous intention.

“Blood-killing Demon Prison.”

Vroom. A terrifying vigor erupted from Blood Emperor’s body and the vigor formed loud clouds of crimson fog that covered the sky. They flowed towards Jian Wushuang at a terrifying speed.

“This technique…”

The King of Venomous Worms in Jian Wushuang body was surprised.
