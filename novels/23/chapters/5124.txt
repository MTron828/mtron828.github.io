Below, the crowd was filled with shock!

Furthermore, the current strength of Fu Zhu exceeded that of Dong Jun.

This sent chills down their spines. The human race, originally at the bottom among the peak tribes, had risen to the top after Fu Zhu’s fall. Then, Dong Jun erupted, once again casting the glory of the human race, making it a peak tribe.

At this moment, the two powerful figures who had led the human race to the peak tribes were standing on the grand hall simultaneously.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Dong Jun saw Fu Zhu, who had once been like a father and teacher to him, and his eyes turned red.

“Ancestor, is it really you?” At this moment, he could hardly believe it, but he was very familiar with the aura emanating from Fu Zhu.

Fu Zhu smiled and turned to look at Dong Jun, “These years, you’ve suffered!” Their emotions couldn’t be expressed in words.

Dong Jun shook his head, tears streaming down his cheeks, and he trembled,

“I’m fortunate not to have let you down, Ancestor’s expectations.”

At this moment, he had none of the demeanor of the first-ranked expert, directly kneeling on both knees and respectfully saying, “I respectfully welcome the Ancestor’s return to the human race. The human race shall prosper!”

“The human race shall prosper!”

Many strong members of the human race below finally reacted. After all, a million years ago, they hadn’t yet grown, and they did not have much knowledge of this former ancestor. Most of them had only seen his sculptures in the hall on the divine mountain.

“Haha, please rise! Today is your wedding day.”

Fu Zhu looked at Dong Jun with satisfaction. This young descendant of the human race had risen from adversity and had restored the ancient glory. Fu Zhu was very satisfied, and his master, Jian Wushuang, had a special affection for Dong Jun.

“Yes, Ancestor!” Dong Jun stood up and hastily pulled his wife to his side, “Long’er, quickly greet the Ancestor!”

Long’er, wearing a red gown, had a pair of bright eyes and exquisite features that were particularly stunning. Upon hearing her husband’s words, she quickly bowed in respect.

“Long’er, greet the Ancestor!”

Fu Zhu’s face was full of smiles, and he nodded quickly, “Good, good, good!”

“Ancestor, who is this…?” Dong Jun had a guess in his mind, but he still couldn’t believe it.

Although his strength was now extremely formidable, and he even had the confidence to sweep across the entire planet by himself, he couldn’t see through the young man sitting in the main seat. Moreover, the Ancestor actually referred to him as his master.

“This person is the one who has shown great kindness to our human race and is also my master! ”

Fu Zhu’s words shocked everyone!

“Master?”

That young man was actually Fu Zhu’s master!

“Do you still remember that Secret Realm and your giant axe? They were all gifts from your master.”

Jian Wushuang did not pay attention to Fu Zhu but stood up and looked at Dong Jun, saying, “There’s no need to thank me; that axe originally belonged to you.”

“Belong to me?” Dong Jun was a little stunned!

The people below were so shocked that their jaws almost fell off. Dong Jun’s current strength was actually given to him by that young man.

“Yes, you belong to you. You are very similar to an old friend I know. Now that I see that you have inherited his legacy, it is time for me to leave.”

Dong Jun was puzzled and asked, “An old friend… Are you the ancestor of our human race?”

Upon hearing Dong Jun’s words, Jian Wushuang scanned the people around him and replied casually, “You could say that.”

Millions of years following Jian Wushuang, Fu Zhu was about to inquire but was interrupted.

“Alright, I’ve had my share of the celebration. It’s time for me to go.”

As Jian Wushuang’s words fell, he disappeared from the grand hall, leaving the people there in astonishment.

“I didn’t even sense any spatial fluctuations. How did he leave?”

“Master!” Fu Zhu mumbled. Having followed Jian Wushuang for millions of years, he understood his master’s immense power. At most, he had speculated that his master might come from another planet. He consoled himself, “We should be able to meet again.”

They didn’t think that Jian Wushuang didn’t belong to this starry sky at all, or that this starry sky belonged to Jian Wushuang.

Outside the starry sky.

Jian Wushuang turned around!

After billions of years of silence, his state of mind had changed. He had almost forgotten everything that had happened in the Great Si Region. However, he could not forget the battlefield in his mind.

With a thought, he could create the universe.

“Ultimate Sword Dao, the fifth level: Heartsword Cosmos!”

A million years ago, he had mastered the Ultimate Dao. This starry sky belonged to him now. The River of Time and Space, billions of universes, and countless territories were embedded in his Great Dao.

The first level of the Ultimate Dao, ‘Thought Universe.’

On the battlefield of bones, he had actually comprehended the power of the heart. The collision between the Heart power and the Ultimate Sword had allowed him to touch the Ultimate Dao.

The thought that led him to this starry sky had brought him here. Now, it was time to return.

An ordinary sword could harm the Physical body.

But a sword imbued with the Dao could obliterate the soul.

However, a sword wielded with mastery over one’s heart could strike directly at one’s essence. Even if the body and soul were intact, it could cause a sudden upheaval in one’s mental state. On the battlefield, the situation changed in the blink of an eye. Once one’s inner state wavered, it could easily become a breakthrough point, and falling on the spot was not uncommon.

Whoosh!

After consolidating all his thoughts into one, Jian Wushuang’s figure completely vanished from the starry sky, leaving no trace behind.

Hundreds of thousands of years later, a collision occurred among the countless planets beneath this starry sky. A great war that lasted for billions of years shattered the tranquility of the cosmos. A burly man wielding a massive axe rose to prominence and ascended to the position of Emperor. After a brilliant era, another Emperor arrived from beyond the stars and created a vast new world, incorporating countless planets, establishing his dominance.

However, these are stories for another time. Jian Wushuang has now returned to that battlefield.

In the Great Desolate Wilderness, beyond the realm border.

The remains of a massive army littered the void, and the ancient bronze temple resonated with the tolling of bells!

Gu Yuan held a spear in one hand and the severed head of a bald monk in the other, taking a step that brought him beside Qian He.

“These baldies are really uninteresting!” Gu Yuan remarked, crushing the bald Monk’s head in his hand without hesitation.

On the edge of the distant battlefield, a young samanera’s eyes quivered. He could sense that his masters had all fallen, but he dared not open his eyes to confirm.

The armored corpses surrounding them had closed in, but Jian Wushuang, with his eyes tightly shut, remained unmoved.

Taking advantage of this moment, Qian He and Gu Yuan took another step, bringing them just outside Jian Wushuang’s range.

“This man exudes the aura of Zhen Wuyang. I will kill him. As for the little baldy, I’ll leave him to you,” Gu Yuan declared without a hint of negotiation, not caring in the slightest that Qian He was stronger than him in terms of power.

Since the Ancient Era, he had followed his master to conquer the four corners of the world. He might not be the strongest among the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, but he was undoubtedly the most reckless.

Apart from his master, only the leader of the Pleiades and a few other peak Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals could hold him in check.

Beyond these individuals, even if Zhen Wuyang himself appeared, he would dare to step forward and fight.

With his long spear raised, Gu Yuan did not wait for Qian He to respond. He charged forward.

“Traitor scum, meet your doom!”
