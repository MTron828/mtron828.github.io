The situation on the battlefield changed due to the participation of Zhuo Bing and the others.

Narcissus Island’s Second-Class Divine Demons had gradually overcome the disadvantage with help from the three Ancient Star Temple disciples.

As for the First-Class Divine Demons, they were at a huge advantage.

Zhuo Bing suppressed Tang Xiao with an aggressive and precise combat skill, which also relieved Zhong Yi’s pressure.

Previously, Zhong Yi was struggling against two enemies, hence naturally he was losing. However, when he was battling head-on with Na Shiyu which was obviously not his opponent, Na Shiyu looked like he was on the losing end.

“Tang Xiao, we can’t hold it anymore. Let’s retreat,” roared Shiyu.

Tang Xiao looked awful, but he was very unwilling.

He was beaten by Zhong Yi more than ten years ago and was still being humiliated till today.

When he finally found a chance for revenge to wash off his shame, he encountered Zhuo Bing!

He was reluctant to just leave like that.

At that moment...

“Someone is here again?”

At that exclamation sound, many turned to look at a void not far away were four figures dashed in.

The four figures soon approached. Tang Xiao and Shiyu instantly knew who they were.

“They are from the Ancient Star Temple led by their top genius, Ling Dan!”

“D*mn it. We really have to go now.”

Tang Xiao dared not stay anymore.

With the addition of four people from Zhuo Bing and her team members, the battle situation had been reversed and they were no longer at an advantage. He intended to create more trouble for Narcissus Island, but the arrival of Ling Dan ruined his plans.

Ling Dan was one of the Twelve Minor Kings. His strength was undeniable even though he was ranked last.

Both Ling Dan and Zhuo Bing came from the Ancient Star Temple, so without hesitation, he would stand by Zhuo Bing’s side, and it would only be more difficult for them to retreat later on.

“Quickly retreat!” Tang Xiao let out a low yelp.

“Hurry up.” Shiyu also shouted.

The disciples from Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace did not hesitate at all. They instantly moved away from their opponents and began retreating.

Tang Xiao and Shiyu wanted to immediately escape too.

“Leaving? How could it be so easy?”

Zhuo Bing pulled a cold and hard face, but that did not stop her from chasing after the enemies.

Tang Xiao was furious and had to reveal his strongest trump card. Only with that did he manage to get rid of Zhuo Bing.

“Zhuo Bing, I remember what happened today. I won’t give up easily. Sooner or later, I’ll be back.” Tang Xiao left a ruthless remark when he left.

After only a brief moment, the disciples of Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace were almost gone.

Narcissus Island disciples finally breathed a sigh of relief in the void.

“Was he thinking of taking revenge? Huh, I’m here waiting.” Zhuo Bing smiled coldly while looking at the direction Tang Xiao was leaving.

“Junior Sister, what’s going on here?” Ling Dan who came over appeared beside Zhuo Bing and frowned while checking around.

“It’s nothing. I just had a battle with those people from Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace,” answered Zhuo Bing casually.

Ling Dan’s expression was strange.

Whether it was Zhuo Bing herself, Ancient Star Temple, Black Thunder Pavilion, or Cold Blood Palace, there was no hatred in between. Unless the other party had nothing better to do, they would never take initiative to stir things up.

If that was the case, how did Zhuo Bing meet the disciples from two major sects?

“Miss Zhuo Bing.”

Zhong Yi and Su Tong went over to Zhuo Bing. “Thank you for your help just now. Otherwise, I’m afraid that Narcissus Island will suffer a big loss.”

“Don’t mention it. I didn’t do it for Narcissus Island,” said Zhuo Bing, thereafter she immediately walked towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled seeing Zhuo Bing who was approaching him and said, “The mighty big sister.”

“You come over here with me.” Zhuo Bing took Jian Wushuang directly to a corner.

“Brother, what’s the matter with you? My father sent me a message before, saying that you went to Narcissus Island and became an outer disciple. How could an outer disciple that’s not even a Divine Demon Realm come into the Saint’s Tomb?” Zhuo Bing stared at Jian Wushuang and solemnly asked.

Although she had never met Jian Wushuang before, Zhuo Yunfeng had already informed her of some matters about Jian Wushuang.

She also knew that she had a younger brother who was extremely talented in sword arts.

However, she did not expect that she would encounter Jian Wushuang in Saint’s Tomb.

“I... I was able to come to Saint’s Tomb due to some special reasons.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly but did not explain too much.

“Well, since you won’t say it, I won’t ask anymore. You should know that Saint’s Tomb is full of dangers. It’s still manageable in the outer area, but the competition will be nasty when it comes to the inner area, especially during the fight for the last six seats. The people from Narcissus Island will definitely get involved. I’m afraid you won’t even know how you end up dying with your abilities,” said Zhuo Bing.

Jian Wushuang was speechless.

Obviously, his eldest sister was not aware of his real strength. He figured that either Zhuo Yunfeng did not tell her in detail, or she did not believe what Zhuo Yunfeng might have said.

“Big Sister, I know what you are worried about. I’ll be very careful when I get to the inner area,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Of course you have to be careful. Nevertheless, being careful is of not much help anyway with your abilities.” Zhuo Bing looked at him and took out a token. “This token is for you. If you encounter a life-and-death crisis in the Saint’s Tomb, don’t hesitate to crush this token.”

“Is this...the safety token?” Jian Wushuang was curious.

There were three safety tokens in the Saint’s Tomb among the disciples of Narcissus Island. They were with Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and Wei Qing.

The strength of the Ancient Star Temple was not much inferior to that of Narcissus Island. They had two safety tokens which were with Zhuo Bing and Ling Dan.

Without hesitation, Zhuo Bing gave her safety token to Jian Wushuang.

“You are really my Big Sister.” Jian Wushuang was moved.

“Brother, you must keep this safety token.” Zhuo Bing handed the safety token to Jian Wushuang, but Jia Wushuang did not accept it.

“Junior Sister.”

Ling Dan was calling out as he walked over.

Ling Dan had been paying attention to Zhuo Bing and Jian Wushuang. When he saw Zhuo Bing wanted to give her safety token to Jian Wushuang, he could no longer hold his tongue.

“Junior sister, what are you doing? This is a safety token. With this token, it’s as if you get one more life in Saint’s Tomb. This is your greatest life-saving tool. How can you simply give it to others?” Ling Dan frowned. At the same time, he looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of coldness.

Of course, that was also because he had just arrived and still had no idea about the relationship between Jian Wushuang and Zhuo Bing.
