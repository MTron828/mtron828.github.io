Chapter 506: The Divine General Arrives

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The black-haired man radiated killing intent as he stared at Wu Yu with his red eyes.

He had not taken it seriously when Jian Wushuang blocked in front of Wu Yu.

“Get out of my way!”

The black-haired man growled while slapping at Jian Wushuang as if he was shooing flies.

Jian Wushuang wore a flinty look as he immediately reacted.

As he clenched his right hand, a mighty power flowed through his arm and gathered in his fist.

Bang!

A deep collision was heard and the black-haired man immediately retreated.

“How is this possible?”?The black-haired man was surprised.

He could not believe that he himself, a Cloud Realm Demonic Beast, was defeated by a Saint Realm Human Warrior in a confrontation based on pure strength.

He had been unable to show his full strength because of serious injuries when he was besieged in the Green Hillock Tribe, but this Human Warrior was more seriously injured than he was.

“Demonic Beast bastard!”

This roar caused the black-haired man to be filled with despair.

Wu Yuan, like a furious lion, appeared beside the black-haired man and threw a punch at his head.

The black-haired man was unable to resist, so his head exploded, killing him without a doubt.

Wu Yuan quickly moved in front of Jian Wushuang and asked, “Little brother Wushuang, are you all right?”

“I’m fine.”

Jian Wushuang coughed. He had gained the upper hand in that confrontation, but it had still caused his injury to worsen because the black-haired man’s attack caused his blood to surge through his body.

Wu Yuan said in a gravelly voice, “It was my mistake. I didn’t expect that monster spy to be hiding his strength.”

“Little brother Wushuang, you’re very powerful. Even as a Saint Realm expert with serious injuries, you were able to block a Cloud Realm monster spy. You must have an amazing body.”

Wu Yuan could not hold back his praise.

It was rare to see such a powerful body in the Monster Continent.

“Big Brother Wushuang, thanks.” Wu Yu looked at Jian Wushuang with gratitude.

Jian Wushuang smiled. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“OK, since the monster spy has been killed, everyone can leave.” After Wu Yuan spoke, numerous clansmen obeyed his order and left.

“Qing Hu.” Wu Yuan looked over at Qing Hu. “You were good just now.”

Wu Yuan noticed that Qing Hu immediately tried to block with his long spear when the monster spy charged toward Wu Yu. It was hard for a 15-year-old teenager to have such quick and reliable reactions in a pinch.

Qing Hu stroke his head while grinning.

“Don’t be too proud. The monster spy was at the Cloud Realm. Even though he was injured, you were still incapable of fighting him. If Wushuang had not come to help, you would have been killed.”

Qing Hu lowered his head involuntarily.

“Alright, I don’t want to blame you, but you should remember to only do what you’re able to do next time. You’re the strongest youth in our tribe and your father is our hero. If you die, I won’t be able to give him an explanation,” Wu Yuan said.

“Yes.” Qing Hu nodded.

“Speaking of your father, he sent a message to me not long ago. He might return in a few days, so you’ll get to see him soon,” Wu Yuan added.

“Really?” Qing Hu looked up with excitement.

“Get prepared for it. Your father seldom comes back, so this is your chance to show him what you have learned over these years,” Wu Yuan said with a smile.

“OK, OK!” Qing Hu nodded. He was overwhelmed with excitement.

“Qing Hu’s father?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew that Qing Hu’s father was the tribe hero and a Divine General of the Monster-exterminating League, who had battled with Demonic Beasts and only returned once every several years.

A Divine General from the Monster-exterminating League. It’s said that only a top expert in the Cloud Realm is qualified to take up this post. I wonder how powerful he is,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a hint of expectation.

It was still peaceful in the Wu Yan Tribe.

The humans were united as one and rarely had conflicts with each other. Even when there was a conflict, it would be settled peacefully, so fierce fighting between two tribes was rarely seen.

After sitting on the bed all night, Jian Wushuang finally opened his eyes.

“My strength has reached its peak.”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes radiated a flicker of delight.

He had stayed in the Monster Continent for a dozen days already. Aided by his own recovery ability and Vitality Elixirs, he had fully recovered.

Only now that his strength had made a full recovery could he be confident in doing what he wanted.

“Uncle Qing Huo is back! Uncle Qing Huo is back!”

A loud voice instantly shook the entire tribe.

“Uncle Qing Huo? Qing Hu’s father?” Jian Wushuang frowned. He immediately walked out of his tent and headed for the Drill Ground.

Jian Wushuang saw a middle-aged man in a black suit standing in the sky, surrounded by many clansmen.

The middle-aged man, with stubble?on?his face, was casually chatting with Wu Yuan and Qing Hu.

The other clansmen on the Drill Ground were looking at him in admiration.

He was their hero!

They were proud of him.

“Seven-cloud Realm!”

Jian Wushuang recognized the middle-aged man’s level.

“As I expected, Divine Generals are experts over the Seven-cloud Realm,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

A Seven-cloud Realm expert was equivalent to a marquis in the Divine Land.

Here, Human Warriors had powerful bodies, so their strength was superior to warriors from the Divine Land when they were at the same level.

“Father, look at me,” Qing Hu said in a low voice.

A long spear appeared in his hand. Then he violently stabbed at the space in front of him.

The strike contained a mighty power and caused a loud air piercing sound.
