Chapter 2622: The Battle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Go!”

The nine Reincarnation Passages went crashing at Yuan Lei like nine gigantic asteroids under the guidance of Jian Wushuang.

Each of those nine asteroids contained immense and powerful energy.

Yuan Lei shivered and a surging pure divine power that could only be possessed by a Heaven Ultimate God concentrating in the void before him broke out within the blink of an eye. A barefooted green titan that was more than three kilometers tall formed with thick muscular arms and thighs and a single horn on its forehead. Its body surface was shrouded with terrifying divine power.

The green titan swung its muscular arm as soon it appeared and threw out a slap.

Boom!

The nine asteroids were immediately deflected away.

Jian Wu Shuang focused his eyes. “Nine swords combine, Heaven’s Edge!”

Ring!!

The nine asteroids were immediately deflected backward and overlapped each other before suddenly forming a huge Reincarnation Passage. A black divine sword shrouded with infinite Samsara Strength instantly shot out violently from the end of the Reincarnation Passage after that.

The black divine sword was a perfect sword formation formed through the combination of nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords.

The first stage of Transmigration Sword Formation, Heaven’s Edge... the first stage sword formation’s power completely broke out following the full activation of Jian Wushuang’s Transmigration Law.

Vroom!

The black divine sword pierced through the void with terrifying power and charging boldly at the green titan like an awl.

The green titan growled before tightly clenched its fist and punched violently with infinite force.

Impact noises burst out violently as the two made contact and a huge hole appeared on the green titan’s fist. The black divine sword continued its crazed attack and pierced through its palm before going through its chest. The momentum was finally exhausted and dispersed with the reappear of nine identical black divine swords flying sideways in the void.

The green titan should have fallen apart at that moment when being penetrated. However, it was still shrouded with surging energy.

Yuan Lei was still standing there behind it with a slight smile. “That’s truly a sword formation created by Sword Lord Tong Xin—such incredible power. You truly are gifted to be able to unleash the sword formation to such a level despite only learning it for a few years. Unfortunately, the distance between Earth Ultimate God and Heaven Ultimate God isn’t something that could be filled in with a sword formation.”

The penetrated hole on the green titan not only recovered, but its energy suddenly surged even higher before vigorously projecting outwards after he said that. A green-colored lance then appeared in its right hand.

“Vitality Law...”

Jian Wushuang squinted while staring at the green titan.

He could tell that Yuan Lei had studied Vitality Law as it possesses the characteristics of strong vitality, incredible resilience, and extremely firm defensive abilities. However, experts who studied Vitality Law did not possess very powerful offensive abilities.

Although being offensive was not Yuan Lei’s forte, he was a true Heaven Ultimate God after all.

Jian Wushuang did not dare to be careless. An immense gold-colored divine power was forcefully gathered accompanied with ringing noises at that instance and formed a more than nine kilometers tall Golden God Shadow behind him.

The divine Golden God Shadow stood tall while overlooking everything around it. The green titan was only three kilometers tall which was a dwarf compared to the Golden God Shadow in terms of size. Furthermore, Jian Wushuang’s overall ability surged even higher with the help of the Divine God of Punishment.

“You do have some tricks. Shame that they’re useless.”

Yuan Lei smiled faintly while suddenly lashing out his hand. A wholesome Principle World suppressed Jian Wushuang in an instant.

The Principle World was filled with powerful energy with the area that had opened up having probably surpassed 5,000 kilometers. Most importantly, the Principle World had reached Profound Realm since he was a Heaven Ultimate God.

A wave of vital energy was sweeping out at its surroundings as his Principle World pressed outward.

Life started bursting out in the wasteland below within a split second as large amounts of trees, flora and fauna burst out from the ground.

A refreshing breeze blew by as the environment between heaven and earth turned into a completely lively new realm. The green titan’s size immensely augmented as its power grew to a whole new level and it began to charge at Jian Wushuang with the lance in its hand.

However, Jian Wushuang sneered at the scene before him. Right then...

Boom!!!

A heaven-shaking sword essence suddenly surged as the 50,000 kilometers Sword World he developed was unleashed.

Although it was only a Merit Sword World, it ruthlessly swept out as soon as it appeared and the Profound Realm Principle World retreated swiftly like an ebbing tide under the Sword World’s influence.

“What?”

Yuan Lei was shocked, “A Merit Sword World could actually suppress my Profound Principle World? How’s that possible?”

Yuan Lei was completely stunned but did not know that the Heaven Ultimate God—Zhong Hun—that Jian Wushuang had killed was equally as stunned as he was.

Furthermore, that surprise was only the beginning as Jian Wushuang waved his arm right after that and a beam of light blended into the surrounding void. Heaven and Earth were shivering in that instance.

A most beautiful scroll painting world appeared out of nowhere from the Heaven above.

The scroll painting world was incredibly real with mountains, rivers, and even contained nine gigantic continents.

“What’s that?” Yuan Lei frowned.

“The Thousand Treasures Grand World, Transmigration World!” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice resonated.

Vrooooom~

The surroundings began to change.

The original wasteland initially became full of life with birds chirping and flowers blooming from Yuan Lei’s unleashed Vitality Law power. However, that environment had turned into infinite darkness in the blink of an eye. Gigantic Reincarnation Passages began to appear one by one out of nowhere in the darkness.

The Reincarnation Passages were spread out to different corners of the world as infinite Samsara Strength began to unscrupulously spread out.

The Transmigration World was filled with infinite Samsara Strength as Jian Wushuang stood in the center although he was the ruler of the Transmigration World!!

“Yuan Lei, welcome to my world.” Jian Wushuang smiled as his laughter resonated in every corner of the Transmigration World.

Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring!

The nine separated Infernal Crimson Divine Sword appeared before Jian Wushuang once again—trembling and shrouded with Samsara Strength—way stronger than before.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
