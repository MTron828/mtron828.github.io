Chapter 2334: Injured

The newly arrived person—a messy blonde short-haired muscular man—showed a beast-like grin and a beaming barbaric craze expression.

“That’s...Kuang Shi!”

“It’s him!”

The experts from both sides immediately recognized him.

Kuang Shi—an unaffiliated lone Divine Demon expert in the Anjiu Commandery.

However, he was there under the Lin Clan’s request as he dashed out of Lin Mansion.

“Hehe~”

Kuang Shi giggled with an opened mouth and dashed into the battle the next moment. He began to fight a Divine Demon expert from the Zhuge Clan.

Lin Clan’s Divine Demons received substantial help from him as the fights between both sides immediately turned more balanced with equal battle prowess and matching abilities.

“Lin Tiefeng, looks like your clan prepared very well this time, huh? You even invited Kuang Shi to be here. I wonder how much you paid him?” Zhuge Yuanchong smiled disdainfully.

“Hmph! How can I not have some preparations when you made such huge waves coming over?” Lin Tiefeng humphed coldly.

“That’s also true. However, do you think the Lin Clan won’t be slaughtered just because you hired Kuang Shi? Perhaps you’re underestimating us too much. We are at least ninety percent confident to win for our clan to dare touch yours.” Zhuge Yuanchong grinned mysteriously. “It’s about time. It’s coming.”

Just as the Lin Clan members were wondering what he meant dozens of figures dashing over from the distant void.

In the blink of an eye, they appeared in the void surrounding the battlefield.

Among them were three leaders with all of them being Chaotic Divine Demon.

Other than that, there were around a dozen pseudo-Divine Demon Realm experts with the rest being Peak Chaotic Realm!

It was a terrifying lineup!

Their appearance caused everyone on the battlefield to momentarily stop fighting.

“Xiang Zong?” Lin Tiefeng gave a deadly stare at one of their leaders who was a purple-haired middle-aged man.

“Xiang Clan?” The Lin Clan members were shocked.

Xiang Clan was one of the top six big clans of the Anjiu Commandery. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The Lin Clan was normally respectful toward the Xiang Clan and seldom crossed them.

However, why had experts from the Xiang Clan shown up?

Furthermore, it was obvious they were here to join forces with the Zhuge Clan!

“Clan Leader Xiang, the Xiang Clan, and Lin Clan never had any resentment toward each other. I had never offended you in any way for certain, but why are you here today?” Lin Tiefeng was trying hard to repress his anger.

“Haha, Lin Tiefeng, you had indeed never crossed the Xiang Clan. However, that doesn’t mean they won’t come looking for you!” Zhuge Yuanchong scoffed and laughed.

“Clan Leader Lin, the Xiang Clan has earlier come to an agreement with the Zhuge Clan. In addition, we have an inter-clan marriage and also share the same goals with the Zhuge clan, hence we’ll have to sacrifice the Lin Clan for Xiang Clan’s benefit,” said Xiang Zong.

“Sacrifice?” Lin Tiefeng burst into great anger, “Xiang Clan, you’re shameless!!!”

“Clan Leader Xiang, don’t waste time talking to him. Let’s work together and immediately destroy the Lin Clan,” said Zhuge Yuanchong.

“Those are exactly my plans.” Xiang Zong nodded before waving his large hand. “Move!”

Many experts from the Xiang Clan instantly began rushing into the battlefield like starving beasts.

“No!”

“This is bad!”

The experts from Lin Clan were horrified.

The Lin Clan would not be afraid at all were they to fight the Zhuge Clan alone.

However, when the Zhuge Clan collaborated with the Xiang Clan?

A great number of Xiang Clan experts had immediately rushed over and joined the battle which caused a huge gap between both sides’ battle power.

The Lin Clan experts were immediately suppressed.

Inside the Zide Palace.

A large number of Lin Clan’s disciples and family members were gathered together. Some who were at the Chaotic Realm unleashed their soul powers to check on the battlefield at the Lin Mansion’s gates.

Despair took over the Zide Palace when they saw the number of Xiang Clan members arriving.

“Xiang Clan... Xiang Clan has attacked us?”

“Dammit, is the Xiang Clan working with the Zhuge Clan?”

“Doomed! The Lin Clan is doomed!!”

Lin Tao who was guarding the entrance of the Palace and his Senior Brother were both equally shocked.

“The Xiang Clan?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He knew earlier that the Zhuge Clan had made extraordinary preparations which proved to be true.

The only matter Jian Wushuang did not expect was that the Zhuge Clan had secretly established an alliance with one of the six top clans of Anjiu Commandery, the Xiang Clan.

The Lin Clan was in deep trouble when a large number of the Xiang Clan experts arrived.

“Hm?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression shifted as he immediately stood up.

“Shuang’er, what is it?” Luo Xinqin immediately looked over.

“It’s Father. He’s injured,” said Jian Wushuang.

In the battle outside of the Lin Mansion, Jian Wushuang’s soul power could see Zhuo Yunfeng crossing hands with a Zhuge Clan Divine Demon expert and had suffered some injuries under the Divine Demon’s attacks.

“What?” Luo Xinqin was shocked. “Is he alright?”

“He’ll be alright for now,” said Jian Wushuang.

However, he knew very well that given the situation the Lin Clan had been completely overpowered and their defeat was only a matter of time.

As soon as they were defeated, perhaps all the experts in the Lin Mansion were going to be killed including his father.

“Perhaps it’s time for me to take action?” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself. Upon looking at Luo Xinqin before him who was extremely worried and anxious, he took a deep breath and said, “Please don’t worry, Mother. I’ll safely bring Father back.”

“You?” Luo Xinqin was stunned and immediately said, “Shuang’er, don’t be impulsive.”

She did not want anything to happen to Zhuo Yunfeng and neither did she want to see Jian Wushuang injured.

“Brother Wushuang.” Lin Yan and Lin Qingqing beside him both looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and did not say a word as he directly walked toward Zide Palace’s gates.

At the gates, Lin Tao and his senior brother—the black-robed man with the longsword on his back—were both quietly guarding. Even though the battle outside was fierce, they had no intentions of joining the fight.

They had their mission.

Jian Wushuang came up at that moment.

“Open the gates, I need to go out,” said Jian Wushuang directly.

“Go out? Jian Wushuang, you’d better stay here. What’s happening outside isn’t something you can interfere with,” answered Lin Tao.

The black-robed man shot a gaze at Jian Wushuang as well.

Both of them were responsible to keep Zide Palace safe and would not let anyone out until the battle was over and the Lin Clan was safe.

The gates of the Zide Palace would only be opened when the Lin Clan was defeated and needed to immediately escape.

Jian Wushuang did not say more and only pointed a finger outward.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you think you’re doing?” Lin Tao stared at Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang suddenly moved.

A ghastly shadow abruptly flashed by which caused Lin Tao’s eye to widen from his incapability to react.

Jian Wushuang’s figure had once again reappeared on the same spot.

“I’ll kill you if you dare stop me!”
