Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Elder Yi, when are you returning to the tribe?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The things that are needed in the tribe have been purchased. We can return anytime,” Elder Yi said.

“That’s great. I’ll follow you back to the tribe. I’d like to see King Gu Tong as well. I have many questions that I’d like to ask him personally,” Jian Wushuang said.

He had many doubts and questions in his mind. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It involved many aspects and King Gu Tong should be able to answer quite a few things for him.

“If so, let’s depart now,” Elder Yi replied.

“Sure, I have no plans anyway,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang immediately followed Elder Yi and they met up with the other guys under King Gu Tong in the city before they walked out of the city.

Outside the city, there was a troop of over ten people plunging forward in the spacious void.

They flew for a few days’ time without break.

“Jian Wushuang, there’s another half a day until we reach the tribe,” Elder Yi said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly and he was getting excited.

One should know that he made some great friends back in the Eternal Zone. Some even rescued him before.

Then, it had been tens of thousands of years. He wondered how the Ancient Gods were doing.

Half a day later, there was a huge tribe that appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Although it was a tribe, there were many towering, lofty buildings and some are floating.

Under the lead of Elder Yi, Jian Wushuang stepped foot into the tribe. He spread his Soul Power and sensed some familiar auras in the tribe.

“The aura is Gu Yang’s” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Gu Yang was the silver-armored Ancient God who had once saved him.

“Elder Ying is here too…”

Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement when he sensed all the familiar auras.

“Jian Wushuang, let me bring you to see King first,” Elder Yi said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Elder Yi immediately guided Jian Wushuang to the middle of the tribe, where a lofty purple palace was located. Outside the palace, there were a few Ancient God guards standing guard.

“King.”

Elder Yi bowed to the palace politely.

“Come in,” there was a lofty voice from the palace.

Elder Yi brought Jian Wushuang into the palace.

The moment Jian Wushuang entered the palace, he immediately saw a brawny shadow on the highest throne in the palace.

He was three meters tall and his skin was in dark gold lustre. There was a faint glowing gold light in his hands too. He still had yet to recover to his peak. However, there was arrogance in his eyes. The most interesting thing was the inverted seven stars in between his eyebrows.

The moment Jian Wushuang entered the palace, the brawny figure’s dark golden eyes looked like a bolt of lightning.

“King!”

Elder Yi knelt down directly.

“King Gu Tong,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely to show his reverence.

“Young man, it’s you?” King Gu Tong looked at Jian Wushuang. Naturally, he recognized Jian Wushuang.

“You can leave first,” King Gu Tong glanced at Elder Yi.

“Yes,” Elder Yi stood up politely and left.

There was only Jian Wushuang and King Gu Tong left in the palace.

“Sit,”

King Gu Tong waved and there was immediately a stone chair in gold that appeared next to Jian Wushuang out of nowhere. Jian Wushuang sat down immediately without courtesy.

“Jian Wushuang, how is your Master Xuan Yi?” King Gu Tong asked calmly.

“Master’s body disappeared before me. However, I can tell that Master isn’t dead. As for where he is now, I have no idea,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Hehe, that old man, he is still so mysterious,” King Gu Tong smiled faintly but wasn’t surprised.

“King Gu Tong, it has been so many years and you have yet to recover from your injury still?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

One should know that when King Gu Tong had been in Green Fire World, he had been severely injured and he couldn’t put his fighting power to play at all.

But then, it had been a total of tens of thousands of years and King Gu Tong had returned to Ancient God Sanctuary, King Gu Tong’s power had yet to fully recover after he had stayed in Ancient God Sanctuary for so long… Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power could clearly sense that King Gu Tong then was still in an extremely weak state.?In terms of his aura, it was barely comparable to a six-star Ancient God’s.

“I am not injured. I was invaded by a strange power. It wouldn’t be that easy if I wanted to resolve the power,” King Gu Tong shook his head.

“Power invasion?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “What power is that? Even you, a Peak seven-star royal Ancient God couldn’t endure it and cannot remove it after so many years?”

“This power, thanks to the battlefield at your hometown.” King Gu Tong said.

“That battlefield?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Now that you have come to Ancient God Sanctuary, I believe you understand what is so unique about your hometown. If not, let me tell you,” King Gu Tong started explaining.

“About this, the story began millions of years back. Actually, millions of years ago, I was already a Peak seven-star Royal Ancient God and the overlord in Ancient God Sanctuary. Back then, the eight-star Royal Ancient God who was ruling Gu King City accidentally passed away and the position of ruler of Gu King City was vacant. There were only two people who were qualified to fight for the position then. One was me and the other was King Gu You.”

“King Gu You and I are both peak seven-star Ancient Gods and we both have royal bloodlines. We also have many supporters and followers under us. Over the years, King Gu You and I were evenly matched. However, because of that, the match was hard to call and the one who could take the position of the ruler of Gu King City was undetermined. King Gu You and I knew that the only way to really take over the position to rule Gu King City was to see who broke through first and became an eight-star Ancient God!”

“Hence, the two of us went to look for opportunities in order to breakthrough.”

“King Gu You went to look for his opportunity while I went through a space gap in a unique mystery land by chance and came to the battlefield where your hometown was located.”

Then, Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

“It turns out that King Gu Tong came to the battlefield via a space gap. No wonder the experts in Green Fire Palace never noticed his arrival. If it wasn’t for King Gu Tong being attacked later on, Green Fire Palace wouldn’t know that there was a super existence in Green Fire World,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in shock.

The environment where Green Fire World was in was unique. It was located within a spacetime storm and there was a formation that Green Fire Palace set up in the spacetime storm.

Once outsiders barged in, Green Fire Palace would immediately notice.

However, in actual fact, there were two outsiders in Green Fire World that Green Fire Palace had never noticed.

The two outsiders were King Gu Tong and an expert from Holocaust Sect, Dao Yuanzi, that Jian Wushuang had killed.
