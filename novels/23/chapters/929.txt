“Rumble!” Jian Wushuang’s killing intent skyrocketed into the sky. The rumbustious drill ground gradually calmed down.

The audience, tens of thousands of them, all turned to Jian Wushuang.

They were also full of anger.

Nobody could endure this unfairness. They were also curious what Jian Wushuang would do next.

“Jian Wushuang, do you have any doubts about my decision?” Emperor Leng asked coldly.

She did not regret the decision that she had made.

The whole Eternal World might despise her for what she had done after today, but she did not care.

She cared only for success. The Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land would reach new heights once her plan with the National Master succeeded. When that happened,no one in the entire Eternal World would dare talk about her behind her back.

“Doubt?”

Jian Wushuang scoffed at Emperor Leng’s question. “Who dares to question your decision, Your Highness? But the protagonist of this Selection Ceremony, after all, is not Your Highness, but… Leng Rushuang!”

“Hm?” Emperor Leng did not expect such words from Jiang Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang ignored her and looked over at Leng Rushuang.

“Jian Wushuang…” Leng Rushuang looked at him with a complicated expression.

“Leng Rushuang,” Jian Wushuang called her name softly. “Do you remember the tune you played for me in the Nature Residence the day we first met in the Ancient World?”

Leng Rushuang did not answer.

“That tune is called the Icy Heart Melody.”

Jian Wushuang spoke slowly, “The Icy Heart Melody is supposed to be cold, but my heart melted after hearing it. From that time on, there’s a place in my heart for you. I never forgot you even after so many years have passed. In fact, I miss you more and more!”

“Leng Rushuang, forget everything else. In the presence of so many people and so many powerful experts in the Eternal World, I want to ask you…”

“Will you… marry me?”

There were tenderness and expectation in his eyes.

He waited for Leng Rushuang’s answer.

The drill ground was silent as everyone awaited Leng Rushuang’s answer.

Would she agree?

“I…” Leng Rushuang opened her mouth.

“Shuang’er,” Emperor Leng said in a warning tone as she glanced at her daughter.

Unfortunately for her, Leng Rushuang had lost all affection for her the moment she announced Xia Mang as the Emperor’s son-in-law. She ignored her mother and continued speaking.

Leng Rushuang stood on the stand, her beautiful eyes landing on Jian Wushuang.

There was only Jian Wushuang in her eyes at that moment.

She could not help recalling how she had met him for the first time in the Ancient World.

That day, when Leng Ruxue had caused a strong enemy to attack Jian Wushuang, she offered to help him. She was surprised at his stubbornness when he turned her down.

Later, Jian Wushuang made a desperate decision to abandon his doppelganger to survive. She appreciated his decisiveness.

Jian Wushuang was not strong back then. He was just nobody in the Ancient World.

But he impressed her.

Since then, Leng Rushuang had always been curious about him.

Perhaps, it was fate. Jian Wushuang possessed a special Cultivation Method that could neutralize the Icy Heart Poison in her body.

After that, they became involved with each other.

She would never forget the time when Jian Wushuang helped her transform the Icy Heart Poison in the Ancient World.

It looked like an ordinary detoxication process but it was her first time experiencing something like that.

She had never been in contact with a man due to her noble status.

That was the first time that a man touched her hand and even poured his Spiritual Power into her body.

For the first time, she was in such close contact with a man. His breath and aura were carved deeply into her mind.

She had always dreamed about him.

Now, he was proposing to her in front of so many people.

Leng Rushuang smiled.

She was born indifferent and there was almost never a smile on her face.

But she was smiling now, unleashing a beauty that drew all eyes to her.

Finally, she opened her mouth to speak.

Her simple words that carried an unprecedented determination spread around the drill ground.

“I… I’d love to!”

She said the three words.

Emperor Leng’s expression instantly turned cold.

Xia Yu and Xia Mang became sullen.

Jian Wushuang smiled with relief.

He was afraid that Leng Rushuang would reject him.

If that was the case, he would leave without saying anything.

Yet Leng Rushuang agreed.

She was willing to marry him!

“I have heaven and earth as my witnesses!”

Jian Wushuang extended his hand to make an oath. His voice was as sonorous as thunder, echoing in the sky.

“Leng Rushuang is my woman from today onward!”

“She will only marry me!”

“I, Jian Wushuang, will marry her, no matter what happens!”

“Whoever dares to stop me… has to die!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice, containing his killing intent and resolution, echoed throughout the place.

Everyone on the drill ground could feel his determination.

“Swoosh!”

His aura skyrocketed to its Peak. His Sword Essence surged at the same time, causing his Blood Mountain Sword to shake. Everyone was stunned. Jian Wushuang then raised his sword and pointed the tip at Emperor Leng.

“Emperor Leng… Will you stop me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

There was no respect in his tone.

There was only coldness.

This scene stunned everyone present.

“How dare you! You’re the first person who dares talk to me like this in so many years! You… deserve to die!” Emperor Leng was also furious and killing intent flashed dangerously in her eyes. She flew swiftly in his direction.

“Oh no!”?Xue Lingtian was shocked.

Many experts on the stand were also shocked.

Emperor Leng… She was going to personally attack Jian Wushuang!
