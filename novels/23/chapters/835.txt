Chapter 836: Asura

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Both Jian Wushuang’s and Asura’s battle intent reached a peak. A sliver of light flashed within their eyes almost at the same time.

Swish! Swish!

They suddenly disappeared from where they were standing.

“Where have they gone?”?Ouyang Xu and the others were watching them attentively.

The next moment…

Clang! A loud noise echoed in the center of the battlefield.

A dazzling sword light and a towering axe collided together.

The power of his Sword Heart reached a peak in his sea of consciousness. Jian Wushuang had given full play to the Star-river Secret Skill and increased his offensive power 33 times.

However, he did not gain the upper hand. He merely blocked Asura’s strike.

With a hint of ardor in his eyes, Asura glanced at Jian Wushuang and snorted coldly. Then, he struck again.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Every time he moved, there were axe shadows. They looked as if they could break mountains and crush experts in Step Three of the Eternal Realm.

In just a short period of time, he had launched, at least, a dozen strikes.

He was suppressing his opponent with pure power!

“You want to play tough? I’m not afraid of you.”?Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all.

Asura’s Axe Heart had reached Level Four, a level higher than Jian Wushuang’s Sword Heart.

However, by displaying the Star-river Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang had increased his offensive power 33 times. Relying on his secret skill, Asura could only increase his by 10. That was Jian Wushuang’s advantage. Moreover, because of the Heavenly Creation Skill, he was more powerful than ordinary experts.

A battle of strength?

He was not afraid!

Jian Wushuang met the axe shadows with his longsword.

It was a fierce battle of pure power.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

There were dozens of loud noises in succession, meaning that the two had exchanged dozens of moves in a short time. And with every sound, a blast wave swept toward the surroundings.

“I’m right. Your power is not weaker than mine. Since that’s the case… take my three strongest moves!” Asura roared. His muscles bulged, and his right arm grew a size bigger. He was holding his axe.

“Your three strongest moves?” Jian Wushuang looked serious.

He knew that Asura was going to display his best moves.

“The first move—Sky Splitter!”

Asura looked cold. He held up his axe with his right hand; terrifying power was gathering in it.

The next moment, the giant axe struck out.

Axe shadows smashed toward Jian Wushuang.

As soon as the axe shadow appeared, it seemed to have split the sky into two parts.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. He struck out his Emperor Sword. He displayed the first move of Boundless Heaven Sword Art— the Annihilation Sword Move.

Bang!

With a loud bang, they both fell backward at the same time.

“Let’s continue.”

Asura’s eyes sparkled as he raised the giant axe again. “Second move—Earthsplitter!”

Another axe shadow struck out, cracking the ground. Obviously, it was more powerful than the previous one.

Jian Wushuang instantly performed the second move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art— the Demon-slaying Sword Move.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang fell back several steps, but Asura was thrown straight back.

After regaining his balance, Asura had a stronger battle intent in his eyes. “Haha, I didn’t expect that after my second move, I’d still be at a disadvantage. For that, you must take my third move.”

This time, Asura raised his axe with both hands, a more overwhelming power gathered in them.

He attacked.

It was a strike that looked like it could destroy the world.

Jian Wushuang was extremely careful as he displayed the strongest move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art he had mastered.

“The third move—Red Shade Sword Move!”

It became a battle of pure power again.

With a deafening sound, the void seemed to explode completely.

This time, Jian Wushuang was thrown back like a shooting star. He even had a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.

As for Asura, he fell back rolling, and it took great effort for him to regain his balance. His face was extremely pale.

“This, this…”

“Blood Mountain can fight with Asura?”

“Is he really that strong? He wasn’t that impressive in the previous selection, was he?”

The onlookers were stunned. The recruits exchanged looks of disbelief. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The three old soldiers, especially the captain who had fought with Jian Wushuang before, were in shock.

It was obvious that both Jian Wushuang and Asura were powerful beyond his imagination.

Even after Asura had displayed his three strongest moves, the battle was still in a draw. There was no need for them to continue fighting.

“Blood Mountain.” Asura looked at Jian Wushuang with frenzied eyes. “You are really strong. I’m fortunate to have been able to fight with you before joining the Blood Eagle Guard.”

“Blood Eagle Guard?”?The words aroused Jian Wushuang’s interest. “Are you saying you’re going to join the Blood Eagle Guard?”

“Yes.” Asura nodded. “I participated in the selection of the Royal Guard in order to join the Blood Eagle Guard. It is a place for the strong, while the Dragon Guard, it is a place for the weak.”

“Whether you can join the Blood Eagle Guard is not up to you, is it?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Of course, but I have broken through the Military Pagoda the Blood Eagle Guard set up for challengers, and there is no problem with my identity. So, it’s certain that I can join.” Asura was confident.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was starting to understand better.

“Asura’s words show that he has a good knowledge of the Blood Eagle Guard.

“He knows how to join the Blood Eagle Guard, and he is quite confident in himself.”

“Blood Mountain, you’re no weaker than me. I could pass the test set by the Blood Eagle Guard, so could you. Aren’t you going to try?” Asura asked him.

“Does the test you mentioned refer to the Military Pagoda?” Jian Wushuang responded with a question.

“Yes.” Asura nodded. “There are a total of eleven floors in the Military Pagoda. If you pass through the first nine floors, you’ll meet the requirements to join the Blood Eagle Guard. If you want to try it, I can take you there.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

The Blood Eagle Guard was the elite of the elite, and just as Asura had said, it was a place for the strong.

The Dragon Guard was for the weak.

Jian Wushuang was longing to join the Blood Eagle Guard.
