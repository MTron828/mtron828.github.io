“In other words, not only would we encounter bandits in the boundless void, but we would also possibly meet the experts sent by the other sect that doesn’t share the same surname, that intend to kill you?” Jian Wushuang looked at Su Hong.

“Yes,” Su Hong nodded, “However, the sect under a different surname, also known as Chu Sect, their core force is under the watch by us, the Su Family. They can’t send anyone over. The most that they can do is to hire some Universe Gods to kill me at a high price.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “When do we depart?”

“Anytime,” Su Hong said.

“If so, let’s not delay any further. Let’s go now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright,” Su Hong nodded and turned to look at the city owner of Floating City, “Sorry for the trouble. Thank you.”

“I’m friends with your old man in Su Family. It’s nothing. Don’t mention it,” The city owner of Floating City waved.

Su Hong expressed his gratitude once again before leaving the hall with Jian Wushuang.

The palace where the city owner of Floating City resided had a troop formed by a dozen people waiting there.

When they saw Su Hong walk over, a brown-haired man who was supposedly the leader greeted, “Su Hong, we have been here for a dozen years. When do we depart?”

“Now. Immediately,” Su Hong replied.

“Oh?” The brown-haired man raised his eyebrows, then he noticed Jian Wushuang. He couldn’t help but ask, “Who is he?”

“He is a helping hand I called for. He will be escorting me to Purple Moon Sanctuary along with all of you,” Su Hong smiled and replied. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You found help?” The brown-haired man’s face changed, “Su Hong, you don’t trust us, the Hong Ri Mercenary Group?”

“No, no,” Su Hong shook his head as he denied, “An extra person will give an extra guarantee. Don’t worry, the commission won’t be a penny less than what I promised.”

“Then it’s fine,” the brown-haired man nodded and stole a glance at Jian Wushuang. Then, he called his soldiers to get ready to depart.

“Jian Wushuang, excuse me,” Su Hong looked at Jian Wushuang in embarrassment.

“These people are the mercenary soldiers that you hired?” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

“Yes,” Su Hong nodded and said, “After I received my old man’s message, I rushed over from Purple Moon Sanctuary. I have to thank Hong Ri Mercenary Group for the journey. The person earlier was the leader of Hong Ri Mercenary Group, Yu Gang. We have to pass through the boundless void soon. There are countless bandits in the boundless void. With Hong Ri Mercenary Group, at least the ordinary bandit groups won’t dare to make trouble with us.”

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang understood.

He knew about mercenary groups.

The mercenary soldiers made their way through the dangerous place. They especially opted to do escorts or other dangerous missions in order to make a profit.

Hong Ri Mercenary Group was complete and not too shabby in power.

As they were wandering into the boundless void, having a powerful mercenary group around them would definitely save a lot of trouble.

Very soon, everything was ready.

“Let’s go.”

Su Hong said and the huge spaceship drove out from the Floating City and towards the boundless void immediately.

After the spaceship drove out, two figures gathered at the corner of Floating City.

“Hehe, the mercenary group has finally departed.”

“They stopped at Floating City for ten years. I thought they’d never leave. It seems like they have to go through the boundless void anyway.”

They laughed as they chatted.

“Quick, inform the boss about this. Let our people keep an eye on this troop. This troop hired a complete mercenary group to escort. The owner of the troop should be quite significant. If we succeed, we will definitely gain bountiful harvest!”

“This is a great deal. If boss were to find out, he would definitely be thrilled!”

…

In the boundless void, the huge spaceship was plunging forward.

Even though there were some bandits sweeping out their consciousness occasionally during the journey, the moment the bandits looked clearly at the group formation, they ran away immediately.

After all, this troop had a complete mercenary group.

There were dozens of Universe Gods in the mercenary group. Among them, there were twelve who were Universe God in the Third Heaven. There were even four Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

With such a mercenary group, no ordinary bandit would dare to provoke them.

It was a rather quiet journey.

On the deck of the spaceship, the Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group gathered in small groups. Yu Gang was among them too.

“Leader, wasn’t Mister Su Hong alone all this while? Why is there another person with him out of a sudden?” A Universe God in the Third Heaven asked.

“He is someone Su Hong has specially requested help from. He said that he is going to escort him to Purple Moon Sanctuary with us,” Yu Gang said calmly.

“Help?” The surrounding Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group creased their eyebrows.

“He already hired Hong Ri Mercenary Group, isn’t that enough? He requested more help? Su Hong doesn’t trust us? Don’t forget that it had always been us Hong Ri Mercenary Group who escorted him here,” one of the Universe Gods commented unhappily.

“Who knows. Anyway, he promised that the price that we agreed upon wouldn’t be any less. That’s enough. As for who else he asked help from, it has nothing to do with us,” Yu Gang couldn’t be bothered.

“True,” the Universe Gods understood.

“Oh yeah, leader, what’s the name of the person Su Hong hired?” Someone asked again.

“I think it’s Jian Ke,” Yu Gang replied.

“Jian Ke, humph, I can tell it’s an alias.”

“He doesn’t even use his real name. I don’t think he should be that powerful. He must be much weaker than our leader.”

“That’s for sure. Our leader is at least a genius from a Holy Kingdom. He’s not a person that some random person like that could be compared to favorably.”

“I wonder what Su Hong was thinking. If he were to hire someone on the Universe God ranking list, it would be fine, but he hired someone that we have never heard of. I heard he paid a huge price. Tsk tsk. He might as well give it to us so we can go all out with our work.”

The people from Hong Ri Mercenary Group sneered and chatted.

In the cabin, Jian Wushuang was sitting opposite Su Hong. There was wine on the table before them.

“Jian Wushuang, you heard the conversation outside, right?” Su Hong looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Actually, the moment you announce your identity as a disciple of Star Palace, none of these people will dare to make such comments,” Su Hong smiled and said.

“It’s not necessary,” Jian Wushuang was cold, “They can speak as they wish and think as they wish. It has nothing to do with me. My task is to escort you to Purple Moon Sanctuary. That’s all I want. Plus, I it is better to not announce my identity in order to ensure your safety.”
