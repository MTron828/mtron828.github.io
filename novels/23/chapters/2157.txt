Chapter 2158 Ancient Blood Beas

The entire space was filled with blood-red mist. Jian Wushuang stood there and studied the floating corpse of the exotic beast.

Even though the beast was already dead, the body still radiated a horrifying aura.

“What kind of exotic beast is this?” Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows and thought to himself.

He had been venturing in the Eternal Chaotic World for so long and had heard of or seen most of the exotic beasts in the world.

However, he had never seen this type of exotic beast that excelled in ambushing before.

“It is very fast, much faster and stronger than any exotic beast I know of. An emperor god would probably die if that claw hit him. Its defense is also far greater than any of its kind.”

Jian Wushuang struck the exotic beast with an attack which was at the power level of a great emperor. However, the beast was not injured at all.

“Speed, power, defense. This exotic beast excelled in them all. Its aura was so well hidden that I did not detect its presence even using my soul power. This kind of exotic beast… seems like it has no weakness.” Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows.

Terrifying. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This was the most terrifying exotic beast that Jian Wushuang had ever encountered.

Even though that exotic beast was not a threat to him, it was undefeatable for those ordinary cultivators who were of the same power level as these beasts.

“I wonder if I will meet more of this exotic beast. Maybe there are even more powerful ones as well.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Jian Wushuang started moving as he continued his journey.

Before long, he met the same exotic beast which attacked him the same way again.

This time, there were five exotic beasts attacking simultaneously.

These five exotic beasts were of similar power level to the one that Jian Wushuang had just killed. Hence, they died without putting up much of a fight.

Jian Wushuang continued his journey, again.

In the dark space at the depth of the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground.

Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu and Leng Ruxue gathered once again.

“If everythings goes according to plan, Jian Wushuang will probably fight the Ancient Blood Beasts.” Kaiser Blood smiled coldly.

“Even though this tribe was not one of the top tier tribes back in the first era, their power is not to be looked down upon. Even the Seven Star Black Sect was exterminated during the tragic battle back then. They are lucky that they survived till today. It is a pity that their fighting power is far weaker than before.”

“Even so, the overall fighting power of this tribe is still far greater than the top tier special tribes in the Eternal Chaotic World. Before we suffered the heavy losses, the Three Emperors World only barely managed to suppress them. Those within the clan are not to be messed with.” Lord Fen said.

“Haha. Doesn’t Jian Wushuang want to know whether we are inside the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground? If he really wants to find out, he needs to first overcome the Ancient Blood Tribe. I am curious to find out if he has the ability to stand up to the entire tribe.” Demon King Chen Yu chuckled.

“He can manage tens of such beasts. However, if he ventures deeper into the forbidden ground, he will face more than just the Ancient Blood Tribe.” Kaiser Blood smiled.

The Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground was known by all for being the most dangerous place of all.

A part of it belonged to the Ancient Blood Tribe.

Even the Three Emperors World at its prime would not dare to declare war on this tribe. They would settle their disputes over treaties and agreements.

The reason why the experts from the Three Emperors World had hidden here was not only because this was a well concealed location.

More importantly, it was because the Ancient Blood Tribe was there.

If the army from the Eternal Chaotic World wanted to attack, they need to first bypass the Ancient Blood Tribe.

…

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang was still on the move.

When he was moving, he encountered small groups of Ancient Blood Beasts.

Each of these beasts was very powerful and could threaten any ordinary emperor gods. However, Jian Wushuang handled them with ease.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang focused his vision as he stopped in his tracks.

He saw six of the Ancient Blood Beasts up ahead. At the same time, more beasts started to emerge from his surroundings.

He did a quick count and realised there were fifteen beasts.

“After I entered the forbidden ground, I never ran into more than five of such beasts at any one point of time. Now, there are fifteen in front of me… Looks like I am near their home.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Each of the exotic beasts was extremely powerful and had seemingly no weaknesses.

“Any one of them can kill an emperor god. If ten of them work together, they can threaten ordinary great emperors.”

“No wonder the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground is called the most dangerous place in this world. No one under the realm of great emperors will dare to venture into this place.” Jian Wushuang thought.

Even peak emperor gods who did not possess the fighting power of great emperors would die under the combined assault of several Ancient Blood Beasts. If they ran into fifteen such beasts, they would definitely die.

While Jian Wushuang was thinking to himself, the fifteen Ancient Blood Beasts would not sit idle.

Everyone stared at Jian Wushuang with their crimson-red eyes. There was no communication between them. The moment they looked at Jian Wushuang, killing intent started to erupt from their bodies.

Immediately, whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Beams of red light streaked across the battlefield.

Fifteen of the Ancient Blood Exotic Beasts attacked simultaneously. Their speed was terrifying.

“These beasts did not try to communicate with me. They simply attacked.” Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows as he drew his Blood Mountain Sword.

“Let see if you are faster, or my sword skills are faster!”

Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

He swung the sword in his hand as he cast his sword skills.
