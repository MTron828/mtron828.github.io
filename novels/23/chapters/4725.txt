4726 There’s No Room for Discussion When Kicking You

The Young Emperor scratched the little girl’s nose and then reached for the thin purple-robed man behind him.

“You’ll lose your teeth if you eat too much sweet food.” The skinny purple-robed man muttered in a low voice, and then took out a handful of rainbow-colored sugar balls from his bosom.

The Young Emperor took out two sweets, one into the little girl’s mouth, and the other into his own.

The little girl crossed her arms in the Young Emperor’s arms and said smugly, “I’m not afraid of losing my teeth. Don’t lie to me, Da Ban. They all say that I won’t lose my teeth.”

The skinny purple-robed man named Da Ban, who the Young Emperor calls ‘companion’, did not say much. He distributed the candy in his hand to the rest of the children.

With the candy in her mouth, the little girl looked at Jian Wushuang curiously with her big eyes.

For some reason, Jian Wushuang was reminded of his childhood and his old brothers in the Divine Power Universe when he saw the girl’s red lips and white teeth.

“Young Emperor, who is this big brother?”

The Young Emperor turned around and looked at Jian Wushuang. Then, he smiled and said, “He’s my good friend. You have to call him Brother Jian.”

“Yes, yes, Big Brother Jian.” The little girl smiled sweetly at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled in return and subconsciously reached out to touch her small hair bun.

The Young Emperor patted her gently. “Go and play. I’m going to see my Imperial Father.”

The little girl nodded and said, “Young Emperor, don’t make the Emperor angry this time. He was really angry when you went back last time.”

The Young Emperor did not say anything. He just reached out and carried her on the rainbow bridge.

After leaving the escort girl, the hostility on his body quietly rose again, and his face also darkened, as if he was a different person from before.

He stepped onto the rainbow bridge and walked towards the Heavenly Court’s grand gate.

There were also more than 10 Yan Immortals guarding the Heavenly Gate.

The leading two Yan Immortals in golden armor, upon seeing this fiendish expression, immediately made way for him and almost dropped their axes on the ground.

The Young Emperor stepped into it, followed by Jian Wushuang and the others.

Buzz…

The flowing cloud water ripple spread between heaven and earth. Feeling the warm brilliance flowing around him, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes.

He saw countless majestic mountains and waterfalls that looked like jade belts embedded in them, forming a vast river.

In the center of the Heavenly Court, a vast green jade hall was located in the clouds. A grand sun was shining behind it.

“Is this the Heavenly Court?” Jian Wushuang looked at the magnificent and majestic momentum in front of him and was moved.

In front of the green jade hall, there was a road paved with smooth jade that led to the Heavenly Gate.

The Young Emperor took the lead and stepped onto the exquisite jade pathway, moving forward. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After sighing in his heart, Jian Wushuang and the others followed.

Feeling the brilliance around them, they did not say anything and headed straight for the Heavenly Court!

Just as they were about to step into the Heavenly Court, the flowing clouds condensed into two figures in robes on the smooth jade-paved ground.

“Greetings, Young Emperor.” Two figures that looked almost exactly the same bowed to the Young Emperor.

“Get lost!” The Young Emperor blurted and used his Yan power to push the two away, stepping into the giant hall.

As for the twin-like figures, they seemed to be used to it. After amicably bowing to everyone, they turned into clouds and dispersed.

As he entered the green jade hall and stepped into the vast square, Jian Wushuang saw that hundreds of Elders had already gathered.

Every Elder was surrounded by a layer of warm light. It was difficult to see their cultivation level, but one thing was certain. Every Elder gathered here was not below Cheng Qing’s.

Looking at the Young Emperor, who was filled with hostility, the hundred-odd Elders all cupped their hands and said, “Greetings, Young Emperor.”

The Young Emperor’s expression softened slightly when he saw the Elders, but he only said, “Let’s go in.”

With that, he went straight into the main hall.

A helpless look appeared on the faces of the Elders. This banquet would probably not end well again.

The Young Emperor sat down on the side of the Emperor’s throne with a cold expression.

Then, the group of Elders who had been waiting in the square entered the giant hall one by one.

None of them spoke. They all had their hands crossed in their sleeves and were looking down at their surroundings.

As the Yan Immortals entered one by one, the atmosphere in the heaven’s expanse palace became a little strange.

Surrounded by many Yan Immortals, a handsome young man in a white court dress walked into the palace.

Their eyes met, and the Young Emperor’s face grew darker.

It was the young man who broke the silence first. He said with a faint smile, “Second Brother, Prince Jiu, greets Eldest Brother.”

Jian Wushuang looked at him with a glint of amusement in his eyes.

The young man in white looked at Jian Wushuang subconsciously, as if he had sensed something.

At this moment, the Young Emperor slowly walked down from the side of the Emperor’s throne with a gloomy and majestic aura.

He slowly retreated, his expression unnatural.

“Tell me, did you send them?” The Young Emperor’s voice was cold and his eyes were filled with anger.

The corners of Pince Jiu’s mouth twitched unconsciously. “B-big brother, what are you saying? Why don’t I…”

Before he could finish his sentence, a powerful and heavy slap landed on Prince Jiu’s face. Immediately after that, he was kicked away by a powerful flying kick.

This combination of skills was simply too fast. After a series of afterimages flashed past, the Immortals finally reacted, and the two of them had already flown out of the hall.

“Brother Jian, let’s go and watch the show together!” Chen Qing said excitedly and pulled Jian Wushuang out of the hall.

In the corridor, the Young Emperor was riding on Prince Jiu’s body. He stretched out his two palms and began to slap him wildly.

On the other hand, Prince Jiu’s face was swelling rapidly.

“Young Emperor, stop fighting. The Emperor will be here soon!” One of the black-haired and black-bearded old men tried to stop him, but he did not dare to go forward.

For a time, there were many voices of admonishment, but the Young Emperor did not seem to hear it and continued to slap left and right.

“Prince Yan, that’s enough!” Prince Jiu, who was pressed to the ground, let out a furious roar. Just as he was about to attempt to resist, Chen Qing smiled evilly. He immediately released Yan power and firmly fixed both of Prince Jiu’s arms, rendering him unable to move.

“Cheng Qing, don’t be presumptuous. Why are you interfering in the fight between the Princes?!” a Yan immortal with an angry voice chided.

Cheng Qing glanced at him and then said disdainfully, “I’m going to interfere. If you have the guts, come and beat me up?”

“How dare you? You’re behaving like a dog, have you wasted all your cultivation?” the Yan immortal beside Prince Jiu pointed his halberd and shouted angrily.

Chen Qing’s expression suddenly turned cold, and his sword-like eyes shot toward him.

The Yan Immortal was about to continue scolding, but he saw this and immediately swallowed, retreating backward.
