Chapter 5460 ¬†A Waste

In the core of the cave mansion, the central hall.

The arrangement here astonished Jian Wushuang, who had seen a lot.

Bronze crystal lamps adorned the walls, typical tools used by tier 6 Emperors when setting up cave mansions‚Äînothing surprising to Jian Wushuang.

However, the flames contained in the lamps were streams of Origin Source, and not just any, but the Origin Source of the universe. Although just a trace, when combined with all the lamps in the hall, there were hundreds of them.

The value of this, even a tier 6 Emperor would bankrupt themselves trying to achieve.

And this was just one cave mansion; there were probably others on the island.

It was a little wasteful.

If he could devour such a vast universe's Origin Source, reaching the peak of the Dao would be a minor issue.

In addition to the lamps, the walls were also embedded with expensive Origin Source godstones, the Universe Godstones.

The stones they used were condensed by Emperors, containing the power of space.

On the other hand, the godstones condensed by the Universe Master contained the power of time.

The difference was significant. These godstones were once the hard currency of top-level experts. A single time godstone could almost exchange for an Eternal Treasure.

Following him, Gong Miaoyi, upon seeing everything before her, didn't know how to react and stood there in a daze.

Jian Wushuang made a welcoming gesture and said casually, "I probably won't be leaving for the next 10,000 years. You'll have to adapt to it here."

He came to the heavenly realm with the goal of Dao Merge. This time, the gains were significant; he could use the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard to elevate his Extreme Dao to the peak of the eighth level.

The Ultimate Sword Dao could also be elevated to the peak of the eighth layer by utilizing the sword Origin Source within Gong Miaoyi's body.

Next was the divine body. The treasures given by Hu Qing, along with the acquired vines, could all cause his divine body to surge.

Exhaling, Jian Wushuang casually sat cross-legged on a luxurious cushion. His mind instantly began to calm down, and the origin source gradually stabilized and rose.

In seclusion at this place, cultivation was at least a thousand times faster than in the outside world, and the cave mansion even had the ability to adjust the flow of time. The sourcùó≤ of this content nov(ùíÜl)bi((n))

Jian Wushuang manipulated the array, controlling the time flow at a level of ten thousand times.

One year here was equivalent to 10,000 years outside.

The recommended cultivation sites that Qiuhuang suggested were not hurriedly visited by him. At the moment, he focused on pushing his strength to its peak before venturing out.

In the distance, Gong Miaoyi casually found a cushion to sit on.

Jian Wushuang then sent out a divine sense, entering her body.

As long as Gong Miaoyi continued her cultivation, he could absorb the mysteries of swordsmanship from her Origin Source.

This type of cultivation had some differences compared to dual cultivation.

It was even faster than dual cultivation. His sword Origin Source had now reached the eighth layer, and it needed to quickly advance to the perfect eighth layer for future plans.

Gong Miaoyi made no resistance, as she also had her requirements.

"Jian Wushuang, don't forget the promise you made!"

Sitting in front, Jian Wushuang remained silent, only nodding slightly as he took out some assisting treasures and immersed himself in the Origin Source.

Gong Miaoyi's request was simple ‚Äì just a commission to find her father.

Although nameless, based on the appearance and some deeds left by Gong Miaoyi's mother, it wasn't difficult to locate.

In the Heavenly Realm, although there were many Emperors, they were not as numerous as ordinary people.

Not to mention emperors, even Dao Lords could be found based on some deeds and appearances.

Upon entering this realm, Jian Wushuang informed Qiuhuang of this matter. Qiuhuang held the central authority in the Northern Region, making it easy to find an Emperor.

Hoa k·ª≥

The only uncertainty was whether the father of Gong Miaoyi was in the Northern Region. If he resided in another realm, it would be somewhat tricky.

Fortunately, the lifespan of cultivators was nearly infinite. Waiting for thousands, millions of years, or even several epochs was not a problem.

Within the Origin Source, Jian Wushuang stood in the void, overlooking the entire Origin Source Sea. After breaking through the eighth layer of the Extreme Dao, he became more familiar with the power of black holes.

Although he hadn't completely mastered it, he had reached a half-black hole realm.

Fully mastering it was a bit difficult. His avatar flying within the black hole continued to explore and comprehend the spatial flows carved in the black hole.

"No, I can't covet the gains in the black hole. To master it, I must start from within myself!" Jian Wushuang clenched his fist slightly.

A singularity appeared and then spread.

The power of the black hole existed amidst destruction.

Destruction!

How violent it was.

His current strength still fell short.

The power of half a black hole realm was enough to contend with a peak tier 5 Emperor. To reach the complete power of a black hole, it might be comparable to a tier 6 Emperor.

This was normal. In the Four Great Secret Realms, once an Emperor mastered the realm of black holes, they became the pinnacle existence among tier 6 Emperors.

Mastering the black hole before integrating the Dao was somewhat unrealistic. He divided several avatars and began to comprehend singularities in the Origin Source Sea.

Time flew by, and tens of thousands of years passed without any clues. Jian Wushuang had to shift his focus elsewhere.

On the pillar of the Origin Source of the Ultimate Sword Dao, the true form of Jian Wushuang descended, accompanied by the heavy Jueyun Sword.

This sword originated from the hands of Emperor Jueyun, a perfect eternal treasure imbued with the terrifying essence of the Ultimate Sword Dao, so potent that even a mere touch could lead to the downfall of an ordinary Emperor.

In the past, he had to make do with some shoddy goods or sometimes could only employ the Formless Sword formed by the transformation of the Origin Source.

Now, he finally had a divine sword that could aid in his comprehension.

The Ultimate Sword Dao within the Jueyun Sword was incredibly upright and could even cleanse the evil aura within his body.

Jueyun, vanquisher of evil!

He had heard that a single utterance from Emperor Jueyun could dispel darkness before her, and none could withstand her sharpness.

Even the Universe Master had to give some face to Emperor Jueyun.

Such power was truly heaven-defying.

When Jian Wushuang cultivated as a Yan Immortal, he could rival a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

Now, as a Dao Lord, he could match a tier 5 peak-level Emperors. However, aiming to compete or even slay a Universe Master as an Emperor was extremely challenging, and he wasn't confident about it.

A Dao Lord cultivated the Origin Source Dao, an Emperor refined the spatial Origin Source, while a Universe Master manipulated the existence of time.

Many Dao Lords could comprehend the spatial Origin Source in advance, which was quite common and represented some peerless geniuses.

However, for an Emperor to comprehend the temporal Origin Source in advance seemed like an impossible tale.

Even the former Emperor Jueyun failed to comprehend the temporal Origin Source, which was why she remained stuck at the Emperor level.

The gap between Emperors and Universe Masters was akin to the gap between space and time.Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

The reason Emperor Jueyun was so extraordinary in the past was that her Sword Dao mastery included the essence of time, making her exceptionally powerful.

This ancient and peerless skill allowed an Emperor to grasp the temporal Origin Source, making them capable of standing against Universe Masters.

Just this one skill made Emperor Jueyun, with no mastery of the temporal Origin Source, create a peerless martial art that embodied time.

It sounded absurd, but when Emperor Jueyun showcased her strength, no one dared to question it.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. It was too distant and unfathomable.
