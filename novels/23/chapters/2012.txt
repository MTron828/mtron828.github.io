2013 Hong Jun Golden Sword’s Impac

The moment they appeared in the void, Jian Wushuang instantly noticed the five figures charging at them.

“Five Great Emperors? No, there are six of them. There is another one at the back,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock.

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao’s faces grew grave.

They already knew that there were many experts in Three-Emperors World. The experts of Great Emperor level that they knew of were already as many as twelve of them.

From the looks of it, the experts of Great Emperor level were more than that. Otherwise, it would be absolutely impossible for them to send six Great Emperors over straight away.

Vroom!

A blurry golden light suddenly soared from the surrounding void and covered the entire universe.

“Sh*t. These people came prepared. The power of the grand formation is exceptional. Even if the four of us launch a full-force hit at the great formation, I reckon we will only be able to break it after some time. I don’t think these people will give us any chance to hit the grand formation,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said coldly.

“Zhi Luo, do you have any solution?” Abysmal Saint Master looked at Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

Great Emperor Zhi Luo was good at the manipulation of spacetime power. In other words, she could use her manipulation of spacetime power to bring them out.

“Sure, but I’ll need some time to prepare,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo replied.

“If so, we have no choice but to fight them,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold as he glared at the six people in front of them. The five people in front were fine, but the beast-like bald man at the back put him under great pressure. However, the bald man didn’t seem to plan on attacking in the first instance. It was merely the five Great Emperors who were charging at them.

The five Great Emperors were billowing with murderous intention as they glared at Jian Wushuang and his troop.

Just as they charged over, they locked onto their respective targets.

Abysmal Saint Master, who was the most powerful, was fighting against two Great Emperors. The remaining three Great Emperors were fighting one-on-one.

“Zi Chen, you shall take care of Sword Emperor,” the old lady in a red robe assigned.

“No problem,” the purple-haired young man with purple eyes named Zi Chen replied. The young man wore a malicious smile as he looked at Jian Wushuang, “I heard that one of the most impressive skills that Sword Emperor has is Hong Jung Golden Sword. Hehe…”

Both parties, a total of nine experts of Great Emperor level, instantly fought together.

The moment they fought, the terrifying power swept out in all directions and shook the universe.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang looked cold. He gripped Blood Mountain Sword tightly with two hands and wielded his sword when he almost met the purple-haired young man with purple eyes.

A sword light swept out. Burble. A brilliant sword river appeared from nowhere and it was enchanting.

“Your swordsmanship is not too shabby,” the purple-haired young man smiled and swung a stroke.

The stroke left an evil purple strike in the void, just like a purple crescent moon.

Dang!

There was a deep clanging noise and the purple-haired young man retreated from the impact.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang had the absolute upper hand in the competition of strength.

There was a sharp light shimmering in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Just as the purple-haired man retreated, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were five resplendent golden lights that instantly burst out.

Every one of the five Hong Jun Golden Sword exploded with terrifying speed and power at the purple-haired young man.

The purple-haired man smiled maliciously at the sight. He then had golden lights floating next to him as well, a total of six.

The six golden lights became six resplendent golden light and pierced the void like a lightning.

The speed seemed to be slightly faster than the five golden lights that Jian Wushuang drove.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There were continuous clanging noises. The five Hong Jun Golden Sword that Jian Wushuang drove collided with the six golden lights that burst at him ferociously.

As they collided, his five Hong Jun Golden Sword had the lower hand.

“That is…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock. He stared at the six golden lights controlled by the purple-haired man.

Among the six golden lights, there were six golden swords.

“You have Hong Jun Golden Swords too?” Jian Wushuang was taken by surprise.

His Hong Jun Golden Swords were given to him by the ancient expert, Long Qi, who he met in the independent space when he was wandering in the Eighth Lair.

Ever since he had gotten the Hong Jun Golden Swords, they had brought great assistance to him. It was also one of his greatest skills.

However, as he fought with the experts from Three-Emperors Worlds before him who also used a total of six swords, his opponent’s Hong Jun Golden Swords were stronger than his in terms of speed and power.

He would understand if it was only faster in speed.

After all, the purple-haired man was a true Great Emperor. His comprehension of spacetime doctrine should have reached level nine in Doctrine Palace, which was higher than his. Hence, the speed of his Hong Jun Golden Swords was of course faster, but the power… Jian Wushuang’s power was much stronger than an ordinary Great Emperor’s. When he exchanged blow with the purple-haired man earlier, he had already confirmed that his opponent’s power was not his match.

However, both of them were using Hong Jun Golden Sword but his opponent’s were stronger than his? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Could it be…” Jian Wushuang thought of a possibility and his heart skipped a beat.

“I heard that you were good with Hong Jun Golden Swords previously and I was looking forward to fighting with you. I never expected that you were merely driving an imitation of Hong Jun Golden Swords and you could only control five at once. This is so disappointing,” the purple-haired man looked at him in disdain.

“As expected,” Jian Wushuang instantly understood.

He had guessed that the purple-haired man was driving genuine Hong Jun Golden Swords!!

As for his own Hong Jun Golden Swords, they were imitations.

Hong Jun Golden Swords’ imitations were naturally not the genuine Hong Jun Golden Swords’ match. They were vastly different.

It was the reason why the Hong Jun Golden Swords driven by the purple-haired man were stronger in power than Jian Wushuang’s when the purple-haired man’s power wasn’t Jian Wushuang’s match.

“The imitation of Hong Jun Golden Swords is so powerful and it is very helpful to me. If I were to get genuine Hong Jun Golden Swords…” There was a flash of greed in Jian Wushuang eyes but he quickly suppressed it.

He was well aware that it might even be a problem for the four of them to leave the place in peace, let alone killing his opponent and taking his treasure on hand.

“Die, Sword Emperor!”

The purple-haired man shot a purple light from his eyes. His body was ghostly as he pulled the distance between Jian Wushuang and himself far apart. He attacked Jian Wushuang with the six Hong Jun Golden Swords madly while Jian Wushuang dealt with it with his all. Although his Hong Jun Golden Swords weren’t as powerful, he could easily block the attack of the opponent’s golden sword in collaboration with his close combat power.
