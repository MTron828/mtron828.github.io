Chapter 2494: Strange Old Feng

After the incident, Wusha Wilderness had gradually calmed down.

The sects returned to their norm with disciples fighting and wandering around as they usually would. Nothing much had changed in Wusha Wilderness.

The only change was the disciples from every sect’s admiration toward Jian Wushuang.

He was a super demon who forced the Great Compassion Sect to bow down to him by relying entirely on his own abilities. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

During these calm moments, Jian Wushuang spent his days quietly within the walls of Blazing Moon City and cultivating secret techniques.

In Saint’s Tomb, he made a breakthrough to Second-Class Divine Demon Realm from Peak Chaotic Realm in an instant. Naturally, some of those secret techniques he was practicing could also be upgraded, but there was no time. Now, he finally had the luxury to begin advancing those secret techniques peacefully.

Four months passed.

Whoosh!

A figure floated in the void and hovered above Blazing Moon City Governor’s Residence as he stopped.

“My young friend, Jian Wushuang.” A deep but friendly voice resonated towards the Governor’s Residence.

In a short moment, a voice transmitting from within the Governor’s Residence, “Lord Yun Zhen is finally here! Please come in.”

Yun Zhen immediately flew into the Governor’s Residence.

In a yard under the willow tree where Jian Wushuang spent his younger days reading various journals, Jian Wushuang and Yun Zhen sat at a stone table and faced each other.

There were quality wine and fruits on the table.

“Lord Yun, you only return after four months. I hope you bring good tidings?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Yun Zhen turned his palm upwards and presented an Interspatial Ring he had prepared.

“As per your request, four portions of Red Sun Secret Essence, five Red Blood Fruits, one hundred Spectacular Beast’s Scales, and ten thousand pounds of Celestial Iron Ore. We had to obtain Spectacular Beast’s Scales from other Domains, hence the long wait. By the way, the two drops of Purple Shimmer which you requested for... I apologize that I could only find a drop of it,” said Yun Zhen.

Jian Wushuang took a glance.

It was true. Everything was there except for the other drop of Purple Shimmer.

Jian Wushuang frowned. “Only a drop of Purple Shimmer is missing? Didn’t you say you know who has the other drop? Don’t tell me you couldn’t ask from that person with your background and abilities?”

“My young friend, I’ve already told you that even though I know who possesses it, it won’t be easy to get. I tried many ways, but unfortunately couldn’t convince him to give me the Purple Shimmer.” Yun Zhen smiled wryly.

“May I ask who has the Purple Shimmer?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“He’s called Strange Old Feng. Have you heard of him?” Yun Zhen asked.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. “No. If even Lord Yun Zhen, can’t convince him, I guess he’s at least an Ultimate God expert?”

“Correct. Strange Old Feng is an Ultimate God. Furthermore, one with extremely strong abilities and very hard to deal with. I hear you were in Luogu Territory not long ago, so I assumed you probably know the situation over there?” Yun Zhen said.

“Luogu Territory?” Jian Wushuang’s heart was racing.

When he heard of the words ‘Luogu Territory’, the first thing he thought of was the mysterious reincarnated expert, Miss Xiao!

The reason he, Xiao Heng, and a few other disciples of Narcissus Island went to Luogu Territory was to rescue Miss Xiao. Luogu Territory was the most chaotic place in Wusha Wilderness with the highest ruthless killings.

Yun Zhen began to explain, “There are nine cities in Luogu Territory, with nine different governors, but the real power that controls Luogu Territory are a few reclusive Supreme Ultimate Gods who hide in the dark. Strange Old Feng is one of them. Furthermore, he’s an eccentric who’s extremely withdrawn.”

A few genius disciples from the Great Compassion Sect were wandering around Luogu Territory years ago and carelessly had a run-in with him. He cut-off all their limbs and hung them up the city walls before torturing them to death. When we learned about this occurrence, Supreme Elder Lei Chong personally went to seek justice for those disciples, hence the start of enmity between Strange Old Feng and us.”

Moreover, our hatred only grew stronger following multiple conflicts. In the end, I had to personally intervene and lead our three Supreme Elders to attack him, but he was incredibly fast and very good at staying alive. The four of us were cornered and couldn’t kill him. We came to a stalemate and since it wouldn’t do us any good if the fight continued, we stopped fighting.”

After that battle, we never took initiative to cross each other again. However, our hatred didn’t get resolved. According to our intelligence, the Purple Shimmer is in his possession. Recently, I have personally gone to look for him and try to convince him many times. I went to the extent of offering something of the equal value and even something of a higher value than the Purple Shimmer. Unfortunately, he didn’t agree.”

Yun Zhen looked helpless.

He had truly done what he could, but Strange Old Feng was relentless.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang finally understood.

The two parties already had hatred towards each other but since neither of them could hurt the other, they were forced to stop fighting. Unlike Jian Wushuang and the Great Compassion Sect who completely cast aside their grudges.

In a situation as such, it would be normal for Strange Old Feng to not hand over the Purple Shimmer to his enemy.

“Lord Yun Zhen, since this is the case, would Strange Old Feng exchange the Purple Shimmer with me if I personally look for him?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Well, I can’t say for sure. Strange Old Feng is a peculiar one and you can’t predict him as you do with a normal person after all. If you find him personally, he may or may not hand it to you. What’s worse is that he could just kill you. Of course, you don’t have to be afraid of Strange Old Feng with your abilities. I’d say, give it a try,” said Yun Zhen.

“In that case, could you come with me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not a problem. When would you like to go?” Yun Zhen agreed heartily.

“Shall we go now?” Jian Wushuang smiled. After he informed Zhuo Yunfeng, he and Yun Zhen began their journey to Luogu Territory.

There were nine cities in Luogu Territory with each of them humongous and filled with experts.

Following Yun Zhen’s lead, Jian Wushuang arrived at one of the cities.

“Is Strange Old Feng living in the city?”

Jian Wushuang squinted and spread out his soul power.
