Chapter 3022: Arrived

——

The world had fallen into a dead silence.

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were still standing in front of Jian Wushuang, staring at him. Their eyes were filled with anger and fear.

They had been shocked by Jian Wushuang’s strength.

At the same time, they also understood why Jian Wushuang took the initiative to expose himself and why he dared to stand there and wait for them to come.

Obviously, it was because Jian Wushuang had absolute confidence in his strength. He was so confident that he could fight against or even slaughter all of them by himself.

Now, there were still dozens of experts standing in front of Jian Wushuang, including experts close to the peak of stage three like Gold King.

However, with so many experts standing together, they still could not do anything to Jian Wushuang. They were even under great pressure, afraid that Jian Wushuang would take the initiative to kill them.

“What should we do?”

Lord Wu was carefully thinking about countermeasures.

But any countermeasures were useless in the face of absolute strength.

Jian Wushuang’s strength was there, so it was useless for them to kill him together.

“Your Highness Gold King, if you and Silver King join hands, can you kill him?” Lord Wu could not help asking.

Gold King and Silver King of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were equally strong and had fought together many times. Once they joined hands, an ordinary True Saint at the peak of rank three would have to retreat. This time, only Gold King came to kill Jian Wushuang, as for Silver King, he did not show up.

After hearing Lord Wu’s question, Gold King shook his head slightly, “No, this man’s strength is comparable to a peak rank three True Saint, and he is good at speed and movement. Even if Silver King joined hands with me, he could barely suppress him, but it’s impossible to kill him or suppress him.”

“His soul defense is also very strong. I just used my soul attack, but it didn’t affect him much. It’s impossible to kill him directly with my soul,” An old voice said, it was Soul Master, who was the best at soul attacks among the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

Soul Master was also a rank two True Saint, so his soul attack could have a great effect on ordinary rank two True Saints.

Unfortunately, although Jian Wushuang was only a rank one True Saint, his soul was extremely tough. Most importantly, he had the protection of the exquisite pagoda, so his soul attack could not even shake the exquisite pagoda, naturally, it had no effect on Jian Wushuang’s soul.

“There’s nothing we can do. Unless the King comes personally, no one in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom can do anything to him,” Gold King said in a low voice.

Lord Wu and the surrounding experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom looked at each other in dismay and secretly gritted their teeth.

Although they did not want to admit it, it was the truth.

A group of rank one, rank two, and even rank three True Saints could do nothing to the rank one True Saint in front of them.

…

In the void, Jian Wushuang was still standing there coldly and arrogantly.

He held the Blood Mountain Sword in one hand and stared at the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom with a hint of disappointment in his eyes.

He was indeed disappointed. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He had thought that with so many True Saint experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom working together, they would be able to give him some pressure. However, that was not the case.

He still had not fully displayed his strength and had only revealed a part of it. However, with his speed and agility, the Star Dream move and the god-burning poison, he could easily slaughter the experts in front of him.

“So many people had been searching for me and had even sealed off this territory. Now that I have taken the initiative to appear in front of you, you only have this much ability. I’m very disappointed.” Jian Wushuang sighed, “Forget it. I’ve already achieved my true purpose in this mission. I’m too lazy to bother you anymore.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang put away his Blood Mountain Sword and turned to leave.

But at this moment…buzz!

A black cloud suddenly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The black cloud contained a large amount of black divine power. The black divine power gathered crazily, and in the blink of an eye, it slowly condensed into a human figure.

It was a middle-aged man in a black robe. His face was thin, but he was extremely tall and strong.

The middle-aged man had a profound look in his eyes. His eyes were as vast as heaven and earth. There was also a strange black light flashing in his eyes as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes when he saw the black-robed middle-aged man who had suddenly appeared.

In the void not far away, the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom also raised their heads and looked at the man.

When they saw the face of the man, Lord Wu and Gold King were immediately overjoyed.

“Monarch!”

“Monarch!”

Lord Wu and Gold King shouted in unison.

Upon hearing this address, the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were instantly in an uproar.

Although they were all experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, they rarely had the chance to see the true face of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom’s monarch. But now, they had finally seen him.

“Greetings, monarch!”

“We pay our respects to the king!”

Many figures immediately bowed down, their voices filled with worship and reverence reverberating through the world.

The gazes of the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom turned fiery.

The Magic Note King had used his great means to create a Great Divine Kingdom. He was a famous peak existence in the endless territories.

Such an expert was naturally awe-inspiring.

This was especially so for the experts within the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Many of them had grown up listening to the legend of the Magic Note King. Some of them had even followed the Magic Note King to expand his territory and had personally witnessed the Magic Note King’s rapid rise. Hence, they had a blind admiration for the Magic Note Divine King.

And now, the Magic Note King had personally descended and appeared in front of them.

“The king has actually personally descended?”

“That’s great, the king has personally arrived. This time, that person won’t be able to act arrogantly.”

“Hmph, I admit that this masked man’s strength is terrifying, but no matter how powerful he is, he is nothing in front of the king. The king is a fourth level True Saint, and he became a fourth level True Saint a long time ago.”

“Let’s see how the king will kill the masked man!”

“He is dead.”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were discussing in whispers.

They had no doubt about the strength of the king.

Although Jian Wushuang had shown great strength in this battle, and even Gold King was no match for him, they did not think that Jian Wushuang could escape from the king, because it was impossible.
