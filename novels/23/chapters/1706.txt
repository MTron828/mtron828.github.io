Chapter 1707: Meeting His Highness Mu Hong Again

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

While being shrouded by the infinite amount of ‘pond water’ in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, Jian Wushuang had closed both his eyes and was still doing his best to absorb the Power of Absolute Beginning.

The amount of Divine Power that an Inverse Cultivator needed to accumulate in the stage of Real God had indeed exceeded Jian Wushuang’s expectations.

For the hundred droplets of Ultimate Divine Power, with the more progress he had made, the harder it would be to precipitate the droplets at the back.

Luckily, he was inside the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. If he had relied purely on absorbing the pure power of the Demon Cores or relied on his own training to accumulate, he could not imagine the amount of time he would take.

To date, ten years had passed. However, he was still quite far away from the maximum amount of Ultimate Divine Power he could possess in his body.

Gurgle~~~ The Power of Absolute Beginning was flowing about and it entered Jian Wushuang’s body continuously. At present, the eighty-eighth Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet was precipitating slowly in Jian Wushuang’s body.

“It’s the eighty-eighth droplet,” Jian Wushuang was filled with immeasurable joy.

Eighty-eight droplets was only twelve droplets away from a hundred droplets. Hence, it was already very close.

“If nothing goes wrong, in two or three years’ time, my Ultimate Divine Power can achieve its peak. At that time, I will be able to make a breakthrough to Stage Three Ultimate Real God,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Just then, Sir God Mad Dog sent a message over to him.

“Jian Wushuang, something has happened. Come out quickly!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes fiercely.

Sir God Mad Dog knew that he was training in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. If there was nothing that was extremely urgent, he would definitely not disturb him.

However, since Sir God Mad Dog had sent a message over, something big had definitely occurred.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang came out of the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning immediately. However, when he appeared at the top of the void, he saw a figure that was speeding over from afar.

Upon seeing the figure, Jian Wushuang was first stunned. After that, his eyes became filled with a great amount of murderous intent right away.

His Highness Mu Hong, who Jian Wushuang was staring at, naturally saw Jian Wushuang as well.

“It’s him?”

“Haha, enemies are really bound to meet each other.”

His Highness Mu Hong raised his eyebrows. After that, he continued to move toward Jian Wushuang. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At the start, when he saw that there was someone beside the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, he was shocked. However, when he was sure that the person was Jian Wushuang, he stopped having any worries.

After all, Jian Wushuang was merely his defeated opponent.

In the void, His Highness Mu Hong had already appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and he had stopped moving.

“Hehe, Jian Wushuang, we meet again,” His Highness Mu Hong looked at Jian Wushuang coldly and his eyes were filled with disdain.

Jian Wushuang did not speak. However, his face was ice-cold. The Blood Mountain Sword then appeared on his hands and a great amount of murderous intent rose from his body slowly.

“Why? You still wish to fight with me?” His Highness Mu Hong sneered, “Seems like I did not trample on you for long enough back then. It’s a pity that an unforeseen event occurred back then and you got away. However, this time round, you will not be so lucky.”

“Let me ask you. Where is Leng Ruxue?” Jian Wushuang spoke abruptly.

His Highness Mu Hong was stunned. After that, his face became distorted and he spoke: “Damn it. Is Leng’er’s name something trash like you can call out?”

“Where is she!?”

“If you refuse to say, I will kill you!!!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice sounded as though it came from an Abysmal Hell. Moreover, his body was also approached His Highness Mu Hong slowly. For every step he took, the god power and murderous intent on his body would be stronger.

At the start, His Highness Mu Hong did not care about Jian Wushuang at all. However, as Jian Wushuang walked toward him step by step, especially with that huge pressure that was exerted on him such that he was actually suffocating slightly, he started to feel fearful.

“Hmph, you are just a piece of trash. Since you have been trampled by me at another time, it will also be the same this time round,” His Highness Mu Hong glowed with a shrill light and he released his aura of a Sir God immediately. A green sickle also appeared in his hands. His body then turned vague and layers upon layers of green shadows burst forth at once.

As for Jian Wushuang, he just looked on coldly as His Highness Mu Hong attacked him.

When he had come across His Highness Mu Hong in the Blood Demon Church the other time, he had merely been a Universe God of the Second Heaven. As for His Highness Mu Hong, he had already made a breakthrough to become a Void Real God.

At that time, when they had come across each other again, Jian Wushuang was a Stage Two Ultimate Real God while His Highness Mu Hong, for whatever reason, had somehow made a breakthrough to Sir God and he had entered the ranks of the Sir Gods.

It was a similar encounter and a similar gap in terms of realm. However, the different thing was that the Inverse Cultivation Test would no longer descend abruptly for Jian Wushuang.

“Trash, go to hell!”

His Highness Mu Hong’s murderous intent burst forth and an infinite amount of green light appeared from his body. The green light then gathered around his body and changed into a gigantic green god. After that, His Highness Mu Hong swung the green sickle in his hands fiercely.

At once, a brilliant green sickle river materialized. During the process, the green sickle river expanded at a shocking speed and it covered the whole universe in the end. The frightening sickle essence that the sickle river contained also seemed to be able to tear everything in the universe apart.

Jian Wushuang took a step forward and raised the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands abruptly. His vast amount of Divine Power was then poured into the long sword without any restraint.

In the void, crimson sword shadows appeared out of thin air and every one of them was so strong that it was shocking. Moreover, there was a total of sixty-one of them!

The sixty-one crimson sword shadows then superimposed onto one another and fused. With that, a destructive power spread across the area.

Swish!

The crimson sword shadow was swung out straight away. It then split the space, time and heaven.

The brilliant sickle river which was in front of Jian Wushuang was destroyed instantly and the shocking sword essence continued to wreak havoc by tearing open many holes that were tens of thousands of miles big in the surrounding void.

The whole universe was submerged by the shocking sword essence.

Swoosh!

A figure retreated quickly from the void that the sword essence shrouded. It was His Highness Mu Hong.

However, when His Highness Mu Hong just regained his posture, he saw that the void in front of him had collapsed abruptly. After that, an ancient giant finger which contained an earth-shaking power pointed toward him right away.

Ancient God’s Sixth Finger, Sun Corrosion!

Since Jian Wushuang had already precipitated a total of eighty-eight Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets in his body, the amount of Divine Power in his body was a lot greater than that in the Almighties.

With such a huge amount of Divine Power, Jian Wushuang was absolutely not worried about its depletion. As such, he could unleash many strong moves and Unique Skills without the slightest scruple.

“Break!”

With a cry, the green god which covered His Highness Mu Hong gave an extremely loud roar. After that, with a violent swing of the sickle on His Highness Mu Hong’s hands, fierce winds sprang up and changed into a sickle shadow storm which covered an enormous area.

The sickle shadow storm struck the ancient giant finger and both of them turned into dust.

However, just then…

Swish!

A ray of golden light which was dragging its long, golden tail like a comet headed toward His Highness Mu Hong quietly.

“What?” His Highness Mu Hong was shocked. It was obvious that the ray of golden light had appeared too abruptly.
