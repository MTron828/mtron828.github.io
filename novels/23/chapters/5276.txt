“Senior, my decision is made. The state of my physical body directly impacts my personal combat power. The current Qishen Temple is a place I must contend for. I must enhance my combat abilities without delay.”

He aimed to noticeably improve his strength after every battle; otherwise, he risked being left behind.

Wan Xing and Hu Qing had considerably surpassed him in terms of combat power. In this ranking, Hu Qing had even overtaken him, and Wan Xing was nipping at his heels.

Without the One Thought Universe, he wouldn’t have achieved such a high ranking.

In terms of true combat power, both Hu Qing and Wan Xing were much stronger than him now.

Currently, he possessed the strength of a half-step Emperor, and at his utmost effort, he could match an Emperor. But it wasn’t enough.

In just a few decades, those who were once half-step Emperors could now match full-fledged Emperors, and former Dao Lords now possessed the power of half- step Emperors. Some particularly talented individuals even leaped from Dao Lords to being on par with Emperors.

And this was only the second stage.

When Jian Wushuang had entered, he could match Perfected Nine

Revolutions, but now his progress had been rapid. Only Hu Qing could rival him at this point.

But it wasn’t enough to settle for second place.

He aimed for the top, even surpassing everyone significantly, to truly manifest the vast difference in their paths.

Having mastered the Extreme Dao, he should have been ten or even a hundred times stronger within his current realm. Yet, among his peers, Hu Qing was still stronger.

Ji Chaoyang hadn’t received any inheritance, relying solely on his innate origin source Dao to become a Dao Lord. Once he reached the peak, he could still further improve, especially with future inheritances. At the very least, he would possess the combat power equivalent to an Emperor.

In this era of fierce competition, seizing opportunities depended on actual strength, not just potential. Except for Hu Qing, the chances of being noticed were one in a billion.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t afford to gamble on being noticed by the high-ups at the Qishen Temple.

He preferred to strive based on his own strength.

“Senior, for the supreme physique, I still need to exchange treasures to enhance the basic divine body!”

During his conversation with Qiuhuang, he learned the true difficulty of refining the supreme physique.

In purgatory, he struggled for thousands of years.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Every drop of blood, every piece of flesh, was refined into one entity.

In the end, his entire physique would be Immortal.

“10,000 years?”

Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised. Wasn’t a hundred years enough?

“Kid, the supreme physique is refined in nine stages. The fastest one among the nine-stage supreme physique takes at least 7,000 years, and the slowest could take tens of thousands of years. Considering your good foundation, saying it can be done in 10,000 years is already quite short.”

While speaking, Qiuhuang planned a large number of treasures in one place.

The supreme physique required many treasures, and success was not guaranteed.

It might be better to refine a high-grade physique. It takes less time, consumes fewer resources, and doesn’t need thousands of years. It saves divine power, effort, and money.

“Do you have a Time Chamber that lasts for 10,000 years?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, we have. The entire Qishen Temple is, in fact, a Time Chamber. One year here equals 10,000 years outside. If time flowed at the same speed inside and outside, the controllers of the Qishen Temple would all go crazy.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned. In the Qishen Temple, one year inside was equivalent to 10,000 years in the outside world. This was the first time he had heard of such a vast temporal space.

He wanted the flow of time to slow down, and within the Qishen Temple, time moved 10,000 times faster than in the external world. The temporal chambers had become much simpler too.

With just one Time Chamber that was 10,000 times faster and utilizing the temporal origin source of the Qishen Temple, the combined effect would be a speed increase of billions of times.

Seeing Jian Wushuangs concern, Qiuhuang reassured him, “Even if it’s 100,000 years inside, the Time Chamber will assist you, and it won’t affect your upcoming trial at all.”

“Oh, and you have a month of rest this time. The trials afterward will overturn the previous patterns. Earlier, it was all about selection; what’s coming next is refinement.’

Qiuhuangs words aligned with Jian Wushuangs speculations, and he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

If it wasn’t for the limitless stacking effect, he truly believed he could overcome the 19th wave.

After obtaining all the necessary treasures, including the Time Chamber, Jian Wushuang took out his token and glanced at the remaining treasure points, unable to help but be astonished.

He had nearly 14 million treasure points; he had only a little over 2 million

3 million had gone into restoring his strength and repairing his origin source using treasures. Afterward, with the remaining 8 million, he spent it all on top- grade divine bodies.

He exchanged for all the items related to the top- grade Nine Refinement. According to Qiuhuang, success came with the Sixth Refinement. If he couldn’t endure further, he could return the remaining treasures to him.

If he couldn’t withstand the first six attempts, it would mean failure, and then there would be no way to retrieve the treasures.

Besides, the supreme physique required him to go to another space; someone would come to fetch him later.

Carrying the weighty treasures, he left the Treasure Hall. Originally, he intended to visit the Grand Treasure Hall and see the old man with goat horns, but now he didn’t have the time.

He noticed Wan Xing also leaving the Treasure Hall. Presumably, he had heard about the month-long gap in the trials and approached Jian Wushuang for a conversation.

“Wan Xing, how powerful is the Eternal Treasure?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously. Even though it was a replica, it was still an imitation of the Eternal Treasure, something even the Emperor didn’t possess. He was naturally curious, and he wasn’t the only one; probably everyone was curious about it.

Wan Xing exuded a powerful aura. With a casual gesture, he conjured a golden seal surrounded by eight silver dragons. The silver dragons roared occasionally, displaying its undeniable might.

“It truly is a rare treasure!” Jian Wushuang complimented on the surface, but deep down, he felt an immense regret. Why couldn’t it be a sword?

Wan Xings luck was indeed unbelievably good. Jian Wushuang had heard that he originally practiced with a seal. His Emperor’s supreme skill also suited this type of large seal. All of this was fate, or perhaps, it was intentionally arranged by the Qishen Temple.

“It’s all external. The key is the treasure that can enhance one’s foundation,”

Wan Xing said with determination as he put away the Eightfold Cloud Dragon Seal.

He wasn’t wrong in what he said, but if others heard it, they would surely sneer in their hearts. Jian Wushuang, however, could understand Wan Xing.

In the future, the Ultimate Dao or the fusion of myriad Daos would reign supreme.

After all, the origin source was the mainstream. If the Qishen Temple nurtured those Grand Yan Immortals who pursued the divine body, they also had their reasons for doing so.

Among these three paths, Wan Xing didn’t take one of them. He had already reached his limit. Going further down would lead him to the path of origin source Dao, elevating his Dao to perfection. But even if his second- grade origin source Dao was perfect, it would still be inferior to the Ultimate Dao in the future.

His only way out now was to embark on the path of the divine body. However, the required inheritance for the divine body didn’t exist yet.

The only option was to use treasures to increase the multiplier for his divine body. Wan Xing did have the strength to do so, but this wasn’t a sustainable solution.

A few thousand-fold increase in power… it was manageable.

With the vast resources of the Qishen Temple, breaking through 10,000-fold was not so simple. Without breaking through 10,000-fold, he couldn’t achieve the 10,000-fold law.

After chatting for a while, they parted ways.

Jian Wushuang didn’t conceal anything; he directly mentioned that he intended to cultivate the supreme physique. Especially after he heard that Wan Xing spent over 8 million to practice the elusive ethereal techniques, which didn’t significantly enhance his strength, he was extremely surprised..
