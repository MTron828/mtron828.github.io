“For what?”

Bringing everyone to attention, Universe God Qing Yang smirked creepily and his bright voice was slowly heard across the place.

“It’s a master’s order. How could I go against it? Plus, you killed Jiu Xi.”

“Although I wasn’t that close to Jiu Xi, she was my junior disciple. How could I not take revenge on behalf of my junior disciple?”

“Jian Wushuang, come and fight me.”

Jian Wushuang replied calmly, “What if I don’t? This is Dayu Palace. How dare you act indiscreetly?”

The Master of Dayu Palace on the throne lifted his eyebrows and said, “Jian Wushuang is a guest in Dayu Palace. If he were to agree to fight a battle with you, you can exchange blows. But if he doesn’t, you can’t lay a finger on him.”

Universe God Qing Yang understood and he wasn’t surprised at all. He smiled faintly when he replied, “I, of course, wouldn’t act recklessly in Dayu Palace. However, now that Scarlet Island and Golden-sun Sect are in a fighting frenzy, if Holy Prefecture were to get involved, maybe even if we couldn’t destroy Scarlet Island entirely, we could cause them severe damage, right?”

“Threatening me?” Jian Wushuang looked at him coldly.

Universe God Qing Yang smiled faintly but didn’t reply.

Jian Wushuang kept quiet for a while and then he lifted his head and replied, “As you want to fight with me so badly, I shall grant your wish. I agree to fight with you, but this fight will have to wait.”

“Wait?” Universe God Qing Yang creased his eyebrows.

“During the time when we were resolving the chess game, I learned quite a bit. The most important thing now is taking time to digest everything. I believe it’s the same for you too,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and continued, “Don’t worry. It won’t be long. Just one year, I shall fight with you after one year. What do you think?”

“Just one year?” Universe God Qing Yang revealed a cold smile, “Alright then. I shall wait for you for a year in Dayu Palace!”

Then, Universe God Qing Yang didn’t bother with acknowledging anyone around him but bowed politely to the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang who was seated on the uppermost before he left.

After Jian Wushuang and Universe God Qing Yang left, the vacant lot before Fairy Palace suddenly became noisy.

“He agreed? Jian Wushuang agreed to fight with Universe God Qing Yang?”

“Universe God Qing Yang said it clearly that he is going to kill Jian Wushuang in the fight. Jian Wushuang still agreed to fight with him?”

“Although it is embarrassing to reject the other’s challenge, he is a Universe Master after all, while Universe God Qing Yang is the top among Universe Gods in the First Heaven. The gap between their ability is vast. Even if Jian Wushuang rejected him, no one would think badly of him. However, he accepted the challenge. It is unwise, isn’t it?”

The inner disciples of Dayu Palace started discussing among themselves.

Almost everyone thought Jian Wushuang was too impulsive.

From what they saw, if Jian Wushuang were to undergo God’s Test and become Universe God in the First Heaven, he could totally fight against Universe God Qing Yang. However, he was just a Universe Master.

With such vastly different abilities, how could he accept the other person’s challenge just because of a few brief threatening speeches?

On the thrones, the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang were chatting softly.

“Do you think the boy is impulsive or is he confident with his ability?” The Master of Dayu Palace said.

“I personally think that it’s the latter,” Wu Cang replied, “Jian Wushuang is talented. Universe God Qing Yang is far from his standard. As for disposition, his would only be higher, not lower, compared to Universe God Qing Yang. That could be seen through his reaction of remaining silent after he resolved the thirty-five moves in the Little Scattered Stars Game.”

“He is very low profile. He knew how to hide his light under a bushel.”

“For a person of such disposition, how could he be so impulsive?”

“Plus, he pushed the fight to one year later. Do not belittle a year’s time. He gained a lot from the Little Scattered Stars Game. Once he digests it properly, his ability could reach another higher level in this one year!”

“Obviously, he knew that. Hence, he agreed to fight with Universe God Qing Yang one year later.”

“If so, the one who will be in trouble after a year would be Universe God Qing Yang?” The Master of Dayu Palace smiled.

“Not necessarily. After all, Universe God Qing Yang is quite strong. He didn’t even give his all when he defeated Chu Xiao from Dayu Palace. In a year’s time, whether Jian Wushuang could improve himself to the level where he could be compared favorably with Universe God Qing Yang, or even overtake him, is hard to say,” Wu Cang shook his head.

“Haha, that’s interesting. One year later, I’d like to see who is the one that will be smiling till the end,” the Master of Dayu Palace smiled faintly, looking forward to the fight.

Jian Wushuang agreed to fight a final battle with Universe God Qing Yang in a year’s time. The news spread like wildfire.

The higher ups in Scarlet Island naturally heard about the news very soon. The Master of Scarlet Island immediately rushed to Dayu Palace personally.

On the second day, the Master of Scarlet Island saw Jian Wushuang.

“Island Master,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely.

“I’ve heard about it,” the Master of Scarlet Island looked solemnly at Jian Wushuang and said in a deep voice, “Jian Wushuang, you shouldn’t have agreed to fight a final battle with Universe God Qing Yang!”

Jian Wushuang kept quiet. He knew that the Master of Scarlet Island would say this.

“I know Universe God Qing Yang threatened you with Scarlet Island. That’s why you agreed to fight with him. Actually, his threat is nothing. Scarlet Island has existed in Dayu World for many years. If we were to be so easily bullied, we would have been gone long ago. As for what he said about joining forces between Holy Prefecture and Golden-sun Sect…”

“Set aside the fact that both of them have fought countless times and harbor a deep-seated hatred for one another, it is almost impossible that they are going to join forces. Even if they join forces, Scarlet Island isn’t afraid at all. At most, they would only take petty prizes from Scarlet Island but they wouldn’t dare to really drive Scarlet Island into a corner!”

“Once they force us into a corner, Scarlet Island could ignore Golden-sun Sect and fight to the death with Holy Prefecture or die together with Holy Prefecture. Or we could ignore Holy Prefecture and die together with Golden-sun Sect. Neither parties are stupid, they wouldn’t dare to do follow this course.”

“Hence, whatever that Universe God Qing Yang said was just empty talk. He only wanted you to agree with the fight. Then, he will kill you in a vigorous fight,” the Master of Scarlet Island was serious.

Jian Wushuang smiled in surprise as he listened. “Island Master, I knew long ago that Universe God Qing Yang’s threaten was nothing.”

“You knew long ago?” The Master of Scarlet Island creased his eyebrows, “If you knew long ago, why did you…”

“That’s because… I really want to fight with Universe God Qing Yang!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were beaming with excitement.
