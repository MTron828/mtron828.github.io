Chapter 2935: Three-Star Mission

——

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and continued to read the missions on the jade slip.

After a short while, he read through the missions briefly.

“Are all the missions here? So few?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

There were only about 20 missions on the jade slip, which was indeed a small number.

“These are only the missions in the territory around the nest. We can get there in the shortest time possible. There are more missions from other territories. Elder Qiu also has them. If you don’t think there are any suitable missions here, you can go to him. However, it’s more troublesome to carry out missions in other territories than in the territory around the nest,” Xue Dong King said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“In addition, the members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance are divided into different levels, ordinary, earth-level, heaven-level, and emperor-level. Naturally, the missions taken by the members of different levels are different. For example, I’m still an ordinary member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, so I can only take ordinary missions, but I’m not qualified to take earth-level missions.”

“Missions of different levels can be divided into one to three stars according to their difficulty. The one-star mission you mentioned to kill the peak divine master in the Blood Smoke Cave is a one-star mission. Under normal circumstances, the more difficult the mission is, the higher the reward will be,” said Xue Dong King.

Jian Wushuang understood.

“Sword Heavenly Marquis, look carefully. Do you think any of these tasks are suitable for you?” Xue Dong King looked over.

“I haven’t passed the assessment of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance yet. I’m not even an official member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. It’s useless to look at these tasks,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“How is it useless? With your strength, it should be easy for you to pass the assessment as long as you’re not too unlucky. After you pass the assessment, you can accept these ordinary tasks. First, see if there are any tasks that you think you can accept. Then, let’s join hands to do a job,” Xue Dong King said expectantly.

“Work together? Can we work together to complete these tasks?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“Of course.” Xue Dong King grinned. “We can work together to complete any task in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, but the reward will not change. We need to distribute it ourselves. In addition, the tasks that we work together to complete are not counted in the promotion task.”

“Promotion mission?” Jian Wushuang looked puzzled.

“Promotion missions are missions that need to be completed to advance from one level to another. For example, if an ordinary member wants to advance to an earth-level member, in addition to his own strength, he has to complete three three-star ordinary missions alone. If the same earth-level member wants to become a heaven-level member, he has to complete three three-star earth-level missions alone,” Xue Dong King said.

“Previously, I was just an Invincible Supreme Divinity, so I could only accept some 1-star ordinary missions. At the very most, I could only accept 2-star ordinary missions. As for 3-star missions, I’ve never tried them before. Now that I’ve broken through to the level of a saint, my strength has skyrocketed, and I’ve completely reached the level of an earth-rank member. However, although my strength has reached that level, I haven’t completed the promotion mission yet.

“In addition, I didn’t accept a three-star mission before, so I didn’t know how difficult it was. So I wasn’t sure at first. The best way is to join hands with others to try to complete a three-star mission. Naturally, you are my best candidate.”

After saying that, Xue Dong King looked at Jian Wushuang with some expectation.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded silently.

Xue Dong King had never tried a three-star mission, so it was normal for him to be cautious.

“If I pass the test in a year, I can try to complete a three-star mission with you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, that’s great.” Xue Dong King was delighted and immediately began to explore the jade slip. “There are only two 3-star normal missions in our territory. Of these two missions, although this one looks easier, it’s too troublesome. It’ll take at least a hundred years to complete. Moreover, the reward isn’t that great. It’s just a bare 1.5 million sacred elixirs. If we split it between the two of us, there won’t be much.”

“Let’s go with this one. It seems to be a good mission.”

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the mission that Xue Dong King was pointing at. The three-star mission mentioned by Xue Dong King was to kill the third Saint Shadows. The reward was two million saint elixirs, two superior third-grade offensive holy treasures, and one superior protective armor holy treasure.

“It’s to kill three Immortal Saints. Xue Dong King, are you confident?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“Well… I don’t know, but I’ve heard of the three Shadow Saints.” Xue Dong King’s face darkened. “The three Shadow Saints are in the territory we’re in, and they have occupied a large territory a long time ago. However, they are evil. After they occupied that territory, they completely turned it into their paradise. Countless cultivators in the entire territory submit to them and live like slaves.

“I heard that he had already closed the space passage between the realm and the outer realm. He also deployed various means around the realm and had an army guarding it. Unless the cultivators in that realm can cultivate to the immortal saint level, it’s impossible for them to escape from that realm.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned slightly cold.

“In other words, the three of them enslaved a realm?” Jian Wushuang asked in a low voice.

“Yes, countless cultivators in that realm are like slaves. They don’t have any freedom. They were even born to make fun of the three Shadow Saints. A long time ago, I heard about the three Shadow Saints. Unfortunately, I was only a Divine Master at that time, so I couldn’t deal with them. But now…” A cold light flashed in Xue Dong King’s eyes.

Jian Wushuang’s face was also cold.

He could tell that what Xue Dong King said was true. Otherwise, the mission to kill the three Shadow Saints would not have appeared in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

He had heard from the Bone Emperor that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would not easily kill some experts. However, if this expert was on the mission of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, there were only three possibilities.

First, this expert had provoked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Second, someone had given an extremely generous reward and price.

Third, this person deserved to die!!

The three Shadow Saints clearly belonged to that person who deserved to die.
