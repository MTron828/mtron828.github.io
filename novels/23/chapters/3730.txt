Chapter 3731: Was Completely Suppressed

Pupil Master had roamed the three battlefields for many years. He had faced many Advanced Rulers.

However, with his strength and his Supreme True Treasure Armor, those Advanced Rulers could not do anything to him. It would be as difficult as ascending to heaven to hurt him.

However, Jian Wushuang’s sword attack had made Pupil Master understand that Jian Wushuang’s strongest battle strength was definitely stronger than most senior Rulers. Only the top few senior Rulers could unleash such power, only then could he defeat his attack and hurt him through the Supreme Treasure Armor.

Such strength was enough to make Pupil Master feel fear.

Unlike Pupil Master and everyone else who were shocked, Jian Wushuang frowned slightly when he saw Pupil Master spit out blood.

He did not expect that he would only barely make Pupil Master spit out blood after displaying his strongest move. He did not expend much of his divine power.

“The Supreme True Treasure Armor is indeed incomparable to ordinary Pinnacle True Treasure Armor,” Jian Wushuang thought.

He knew that if Pupil Master did not have Supreme Treasure Armor and only had Supreme Treasure Armor, his sword attack with the Netherworld Divine Sword would have severely injured him, at least 10 to 20 percent of his divine power would have been consumed, but the divine power consumed by Pupil Master was negligible.

“With the protection of Supreme Treasure Armor, I can’t kill him alone.” Jian Wushuang understood this, but then he snorted and said, “Even if I can’t kill him, I have to teach him a lesson!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold, and he attacked again with shocking power.

Jian Wushuang hated Pupil Master a little.

As a Ruler, he did not care about his identity and attacked the Principles Master without any reason.

Such a person who did not care about his own reputation was despised.

Moreover, it was not the first time that Pupil Master had provoked Star Palace. Jian Wushuang had read that during his time in the three battlefields, Pupil Master had attacked experts from Star Palace several times, he had even made Star Palace suffer a setback and paid a great price.

However, because Pupil Master was strong and had the protection of the Supreme True Treasure Armor, Star Palace had been unable to do anything to him. They could only be angry but did not dare to say anything. Unexpectedly, Pupil Master had become even worse. This time in the Red Cloud World, he also targeted Master Guchi, almost causing Star Palace to lose one of its two experts at the pinnacle of the six realm.

After repeatedly bullying Star Palace, Jian Wushuang now had the ability to teach Pupil Master a deep lesson.

Even if he could not kill him, he had to at least let Pupil Master remember this lesson. In the Red Cloud World, including when he was adventuring on the three battlefields, he would have some scruples when he encountered experts from Star Palace, he did not dare to kill them recklessly.

Jian Wushuang unleashed his full strength.

Although he had fought Pupil Master before, he had never used the power of the will given by the universe principles, nor had he used his swordsmanship at full strength.

But now, Jian Wushuang’s full strength could only be described as valiant or terrifying.

His divine power was shockingly powerful.

His swordsmanship was even more mysterious. Each of his sword contained an extremely rich sword principle universe origin.

Although Pupil Master also used his full strength, he was completely crushed by Jian Wushuang in a fight.

It was one-sided!

Anyone with a discerning eye could see that Pupil Master was no match for Jian Wushuang.

“He’s too strong. His combat strength is too strong!”

“His divine power is definitely at the Advanced Ruler level. He’s stronger than ordinary Advanced Rulers, so he’s naturally much stronger than me.”

“His swordsmanship is even more terrifying. His understanding of sword principle is much higher than all the sword principle experts I’ve met. Sword principle origin. Yes, he has already stepped into the sword principle universe origin, and every move he makes contains a rich sword principle universe origin. His swordsmanship is not only extremely powerful, but also extremely profound. It’s not something I can compare to.”

The power of the divine power was comparable to that of a superior Ruler, and in his opinion, even a superior Ruler might not be as good as Jian Wushuang’s understanding of sword principle. This resulted in Jian Wushuang’s terrifying strength, he was definitely the best among the superior Rulers.

Pupil Master was completely unable to contend with him.

“It’s better to leave first.”

After a short exchange of blows, Pupil Master was completely shocked by Jian Wushuang’s strength.

Naturally, he had no intention to continue fighting with Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang had something that made him extremely desperate for a special treasure, with his current strength, it was definitely not something he could get.

He could only leave first and then think of other ways.

Pupil Master wanted to leave, but Jian Wushuang did not intend to let him leave.

“Magic Sand Domain!”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and instantly, endless black sand rolled up crazily. In the blink of an eye, it formed a huge black sand sea that covered the entire heaven and earth void.

Pupil Master’s figure was also covered by the black sand sea.

“A Domain Type True Treasure? Judging from its aura, it’s a Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure!” Pupil Master was shocked. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Domain Type True Treasures were extremely precious among the many True Treasures of the same level.

As for a Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure, its value was not much lower than a Supreme True Treasure.

Although he was a Ruler, and for some special reasons, he had accumulated two Supreme True Treasures over a long period of time. One was an attack type True Treasure, and the other was a Supreme True Treasure Armor. However, a Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure…he did not have one.

However, he did not expect that Jian Wushuang, a Principles Master, not only had a supreme offensive weapon, but he also had a Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure?

What Pupil Master did not know was that although Jian Wushuang was a Principles Master, he had killed three Rulers in the Divine Beginning Realm. The three Rulers were all from the second-level Star World, Devil Cloud Star. They were all extraordinary, Jian Wushuang had obtained this Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure from one of the Rulers. It was a ring called the Devil Sand Ring.

Jian Wushuang had long recognized the Devil Sand Ring as his master. Now, when he used it, it instantly formed a huge devil sand ocean that suppressed everything.

When Pupil Master was trapped in the devil sand ocean, he was immediately suppressed. His speed was greatly reduced, and his overall strength was greatly suppressed.

“Blood Sword Master, I’m leaving. Don’t go too far!” Pupil Master could feel the suppression of the surrounding sea of devil sand, and he could not help being shocked and angry.

“Go too far?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. “I’ve already said that if you don’t hand over three Pinnacle True Treasures to make amends, you won’t be able to leave so easily!”
