Chapter 501: Wait for Me!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Revenge?” Di Jing frowned and shot Su Ming a glance.

Su Ming’s face fell when he heard what Blind Emperor said.

“Ok, I grant your wish.” Di Jing nodded.

Just as those words escaped his mouth, Di Jing waved his hand and released a Restriction that covered a large space. And that space was a battlefield.

As Di Jing waved his hand again, Blind Emperor and Su Ming were immediately pushed into the battlefield by an immaterial force.

“This is a special battlefield just for you two. After entering it, only one of you will be able to walk out alive while the other one has to die inside.” Di Jing’s voice echoed throughout the battlefield.

“Thank you so much,” Blind Emperor said gratefully.

Blind Emperor and Su Ming stood facing each other 100 feet apart.

“Damn you blind man.”

Su Ming looked grim. He had worried that Di Jing would kill him directly, but now, it seemed that Di Jing wanted him to fight against Blind Emperor.

Since it was a battle of life and death, Su Ming had to kill Blind Emperor in order to survive.

Blind Emperor was trembling from being so excited.?“I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long.”

“Su Ming, you betrayed our master. When he was still alive, he told me to kill you the moment I met you.

“Now, a thousand years have passed and I’m on my deathbed, but finally, I’ve gotten the chance to accomplish master’s wish. I’ll be proud when I see him in heaven.”

“Blind guy, don’t be so stubborn as you’re already at death’s door,” Su Ming said coldly.

“At death’s door? Blind Emperor...”?

Upon hearing the words, Jian Wushuang finally understood that Blind Emperor was on his way to heaven.

“No wonder Di Jing said that whether or not he saved Blind Emperor, it would not change anything.”

This was a rare chance for Blind Emperor to get revenge for the Sword Ancestor.

“Go to hell!”

With no more words, Blind Emperor made his move.

Su Ming went over to the emperor after taking a breath.

If Blind Emperor was not dying, Su Ming would not have agreed to have a tough fight with him because his Illusory Sword Principle would be overcome by Blind Emperor’s Heart Sword Principle.

However, he was now involved in the battle and had to fight until one of them was dead.

One would live, one would die.

“Blind guy, I will send you to hell!” Su Ming was going to go all out in the fight.

Soon after, the two men were engaged in a fierce battle.

Outside the battlefield, the experts watched the fighting quietly. None of them dared to or could interfere in it.

Blood Bladesman and Dong Ming King stood in silence, well-behaved.

Half a day later, the battle was settled.

“Hahahaha, blind guy, how could you think that you can kill me?” Su Ming laughed crazily in the center of the battlefield, his face twisted, his eyes red—he was wild with great joy.

“I have to thank you, really. I’ve been stuck in this realm for a thousand years, and now, thanks to this battle, I’ve made a breakthrough!”

Su Ming clenched his fists. The onlookers could feel an overwhelming aura emanating from him—an aura that was much more powerful than someone in the Cloud Realm could have.

“No! This is not real.” Blind Emperor trembled, unwilling to give up. He had a bloody hole left by a longsword on his chest. His breath was dying out.

“Master, I’m so sorry that I didn’t kill him.”

Blind Emperor smiled sadly as his body fell to the ground.

Watching this scene, the onlookers let out sighs of pity.

“Su Ming made a breakthrough.”

“At such a critical moment, he managed to break through his realm!”

“What a pity! Blind Emperor had overpowered Su Ming with his Heart Sword Principle and absolutely had the upper hand. Who would have thought that Su Ming could break through his realm at the last moment!”

Everyone had witnessed Su Ming’s breakthrough and how he had become as powerful as the Three Ancestors, Blood Bladesman, and Bagu Cave Master.

That was also why Su Ming had survived and Blind Emperor had been killed.

“It’s a pity.”

Seeing the result of the battle, Di Jing could not help shaking his head. He then looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Boy, it’s time to leave.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly, his face flushed red, his teeth chattering. He gazed at the laughing Su Ming.

“I know you’re disappointed, but you have to put your feelings away now. Someday, when you’re powerful enough to get revenge, you can make those who hurt you pay you back whatever you want.” Di Jing tried to comfort Jian Wushuang.

“Ok.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and his eyes became red.

On this day, he and his father had been driven to the verge of despair, and Blind Emperor had even lost his life.

Without Di Jing, all of them would have already died.

He had to get his revenge someday.

Di Jing waved his hand and cut the void open, revealing a mysterious, huge wormhole.

“Go,” Di Jing said to Jian Wushuang. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang walked forward toward the wormhole, but suddenly, he stopped and turned back to look at Su Ming and the other experts.

There was a dead silence as everyone stared back at Jian Wushuang.

They could see a fierce and chilling killing intent in his eyes.

“Su Ming, I’ll never forget what you’ve done today!

“And all of you with him!

“Someday, when I come back, no matter if you’re in heaven or hell, I’ll kill you all!

“Wait for me!”

“Wait for me!”

Jian Wushuang’s last sentence kept swirling around in the experts’ minds.

“Buzz!”

With that sound, Jian Wushuang stepped into the wormhole and disappeared in the next moment as if he had been swallowed. What remained was his voice full of hatred resounding through the area.

As Su Ming, the Three Ancestors, Blood Bladesman, and all the other experts watched Jian Wushuang leave, anxiety was aroused in their hearts.

Maybe some years later, they would have to pay him back with blood for what they had done today.
