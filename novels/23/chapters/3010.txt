Chapter 3011: Attack

——

As soon as Lord Wu gave the order, 200,000 soldiers of the magic sound army arrived.

These 200,000 soldiers, including the top experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, went directly underground and began to search for Jian Wushuang in a depth of 1,000 miles.

However, after a year, 10, 20 years, they still could not find Jian Wushuang.

They had no choice. They had been looking in the wrong direction from the beginning, so it was impossible for them to find Jian Wushuang.

In a flash, the area had been sealed by the magic array of the dragon-imprisoning compass for 30 years, but the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom still did not give up on searching.

In the secret chamber in the city where Jian Wushuang was hiding.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly opened, and a strange light flashed in them.

“After 30 years of preparation, my divine power has accumulated to the limit of a Divine Master, and my comprehension of the rules and Dao has reached the peak of my level. In terms of absolute arts, the two moves, ‘Night Elephant’ and ‘Star Dream’, are powerful enough!

“I’ve reached the limit in all aspects, and because of the previous pursuit, the bottleneck in my body has loosened a little…”

“It’s time to try and breakthrough.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered.

Naturally, he wanted to break through to become an Immortal Saint.

This step was very difficult. He was not fully confident at the moment. After all, he did not really have the opportunity to make a breakthrough.

What he could do now was to be fully prepared and make a breakthrough by force. It would be good if he succeeded, but if he failed, he would not be able to make a second breakthrough for 200 years.

However, he was trapped in this territory. If he wanted to find a chance to escape, he could only make a breakthrough by force.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath. With a flip of his hand, several divine power fruits appeared in the void in front of him.

These divine power fruits were deliberately prepared by Jian Wushuang for the purpose of breaking through.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang swallowed the divine power fruits in one go. In an instant, a vast and pure power began to condense in his body. This power rapidly gathered his own divine power, in the blink of an eye, it formed a torrent.

At the same time, the Blood Mountain Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand suddenly appeared.

A large amount of the power of space-time rules gathered, and Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Space-time swordsmanship, Star Dream!

Boom! Boom!

While he was performing the swordsmanship, the torrent of divine power that Jian Wushuang had accumulated crazily rushed toward the barrier in his body.

It was a forceful attack.

After two consecutive attacks, the barrier did not budge at all.

“Again.”

Jian Wushuang was not discouraged at all. The pure power of the divine power fruit and his divine power had formed nine torrents, which was equivalent to an attack.

Now, he had only attacked twice, and there were seven more attacks left.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

There were three more fierce attacks. Jian Wushuang also attacked three times at the same time, each of which was a move of Star Dream.

The barrier trembled slightly for a moment, but it was not damaged.

“Continue!”

Jian Wushuang focused his eyes. Four of the remaining five streams of divine power rushed toward him at the same time.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

There were four more attacks. The barrier in his body shook violently under the impact, but it gradually calmed down after the impact dissipated.

“All eight attacks failed. There is only one chance left.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

The last attack was the strongest impact of the divine power he had condensed.

Although there was only one divine power torrent in this attack, it was more powerful than the previous four combined.

Most importantly, although the four torrents attacked at the same time, they hit the barrier at the same time, so the power was very scattered.

This time, the divine power torrents were composed of thousands of powers.

“This is my last chance. I’ll Fight!”

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth, his eyes shining with unprecedented sharpness.

The divine power torrents in his body also surged crazily and hit the barrier in an instant.

Rumble! The divine power was like a tidal wave, trying to break the barrier completely.

The barrier began to shake crazily as if it was about to collapse.

At this moment… Crack!

A faint sound rang out, but it made Jian Wushuang overjoyed.

Jian Wushuang had already seen that there was a crack on the barrier in his body.

Although the crack was very weak, the barrier had lost its ancient firmness because of the crack.

Boom!

The vast divine power surged and broke the barrier.

“Rumble!” The divine power surged into the barrier.

The Immortal Saint had arrived!

…

In a valley near Jian Wushuang’s city.

The three True Saint experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom gathered together.

The three True Saint experts were also in charge of searching for Jian Wushuang. They were not underground, but still searching in the cities.

After all, it was highly possible that Jian Wushuang was hiding underground, but it was also possible that he was hiding in the cities. The Magic Note Divine Kingdom did not want to give Jian Wushuang any chance to escape.

But at this moment…

Buzz!

A terrifying divine power suddenly swept out from the nearby cities.

“What’s going on?”

“What’s wrong?”

“Judging from this divine power, someone must be making a breakthrough, and judging from the aura alone, it should only be a Divine Master who has made a breakthrough to become an Immortal Saint. But isn’t this divine power a little too terrifying?

“It’s clearly so far away from us, but it actually filled us with fear.”

“This divine might seems to be stronger than the divine might of a second-level True Saint or even a third-level True Saint. How is this possible?”

The three True Saints raised their heads to look at the distant void, all of them extremely shocked.

And in the next moment, the three of them made a decision.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

“However, we have to go and see who broke through.”

The three of them immediately set off.

The three of them were still some distance away from the city, but they could still feel such a powerful divine might.

In that city, countless cultivators were completely under the pressure of that divine might.

“This, this…”

“Who is it? Who is it? Who is breaking through?”

“Looking at the divine power and aura, there is someone who has broken through to become an Immortal Saint. However, how could such a powerful divine might be something that an ordinary undying Immortal Saint could possess?”

“This is too terrifying. This divine might is too terrifying. I once had the fortune to see a peak rank two True Saint erupt with divine might, but it is far from being this terrifying.”

“Who is it? Who is in our city?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Countless people screamed in terror.
