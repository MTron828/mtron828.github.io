Chapter 4003: Killer Coming up to You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The giant universe boat continued to sail in the galaxy with the Purple Micro Star Field as its goal.

Jian Wushuang spent a lot of time on the universe boat with his wife, but he did not neglect his cultivation.

Over the years, he had refined the Heavenly Dao will of the Divine Beginning Realm. With the help of the Heavenly Dao will, his speed of comprehending the principles and the universe principles was ridiculously fast, especially the universe principles, he had improved at an amazing speed.

“When I was in the state of enlightenment, I comprehended both the principle of gold and the principle of darkness. The principle of gold has perfectly fused with the other principles, so I broke through to become a Ruler. Although I have comprehended the principle of darkness, I haven’t really fused it. Over the years, I have comprehended a lot of the seventh and eighth principles, but I still haven’t completely fused the principle of darkness. I feel that I’m still a little short.” Jian Wushuang sat there alone with his legs crossed, he muttered to himself.

The improvement of a Ruler’s realm was determined by the fusion principles.

He had fused five principles, so he could only be considered a second-level Ruler. Although he had comprehended the sixth principle, and even the seventh and even the eighth principle, as long as he did not fuse them…he would still be at the second-level.

Over the years, Jian Wushuang had also tried to fuse the dark principle, and he had found a way to do so. However, he was still a step away from the actual fusion.

Jian Wushuang estimated that he could break through this window at any time. When he fused the six principles, even a third-level Ruler would have a sudden increase in his overall strength.

“Under normal circumstances, the more principles I fuse, the more difficult it will be. Most Rulers in the universe have to stay at one level for a very long time before they can reach the next level. But for me, with the help of the divine realm’s will of Heavenly Dao, it’s much easier for me to fuse the principles than others.” Jian Wushuang chuckled, although he had not done anything in the past few years, he had gained a lot of benefits from the Divine Beginning Realm, and his overall strength had been increasing rapidly.

Suddenly…

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang raised his head.

He was in control of the universe boat, but his soul power had been spreading all the time. Because he had broken through to become a Ruler, his soul had also undergone a transformation. Now, his soul power could detect a wide area.

He could now sense that a large number of experts’ auras were rushing toward the universe boat.

“From the looks of it, they seem to be Space Pirates. Are they coming for me? It can’t be, right?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was strange.

However, he could sense that the Space Pirates were getting closer to the universe boat, but they still did not stop. Instead, they continued to fly straight toward the universe boat.

“Are they really coming for us?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the universe boat, Jian Wushuang, Leng Rushuang, and Devil Flame had gathered together. The three of them had a strange look on their faces.

“Under normal circumstances, no Space Pirates would be so blind as to come to trouble the universe boat. But these Space Pirates…” Devil Flame frowned.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang noticed that there were many familiar auras among the Space Pirates. Among them was the 13th leader of the Ancient Yuan Star, the robust elder.

“It seems that we have caused some trouble by saving that couple last time. These pirates are from the Ancient Yuan Star.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

The universe boat had already stopped in the galaxy.

The pirates had already come to the front of the universe boat. They saw a large number of pirates gathered there. At a glance, there seemed to be no less than 200 people. Among these pirates, nearly half of them were Rulers, although most of them were only first-tier Rulers, there were still more than 20 second-tier Rulers. There were even three third-tier Rulers.

The three third-tier Rulers were clearly in the lead, and aside from them, the muscular old man was standing with them.

“This is the universe boat.” The muscular old man’s gaze was cold as he stared at the universe boat that had already come to a halt.

“Tsk, tsk, this universe boat is quite big, and its value is probably not low. It’s not a waste for us to take the universe passage to get here.” Among the three third-level Rulers, a man in black armor smiled wickedly.

“Don’t be happy too early. Let’s wait until we kill the people in the universe boat.” The silver-haired middle-aged man in a long robe said.

The many Space Pirates from the Ancient Yuan Star were staring at the universe boat with a hint of excitement in their eyes.

In the universe boat, Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry to show himself. Instead, he said in a cold voice, “How dare you block my way? Are you tired of living?”

“Humph, boy, don’t put on airs. I’ve figured it out long ago. There are only three people in this universe boat. Two of them are only at the level of a second-level Ruler, and one of the guards may be stronger, but he’s probably only at the level of a third-level Ruler. How dare you say that we’re tired of living with such little strength?” The robust elder snorted.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

From the moment he entered the Purple Myrtle Star River, he had never shown his face or revealed his divine power.

After all, there was a magic formation on the universe boat, which would block the soul detection of ordinary experts. In other words, no one could tell how many people were on the universe boat from outside, what level of strength they were at?

However, the robust elder knew, and he even told them the truth.

“It’s that couple.” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

“That couple betrayed us?” Leng Rushuang frowned.

“It should be, but it’s hard to say if there’s a secret.” Jian Wushuang shook his head, and then he walked out of the universe boat.

Devil Flame wanted to go up, but he was ordered by Jian Wushuang to stay in the universe boat.

The cabin door of the universe boat opened, and Jian Wushuang slowly walked out of the cabin and appeared in front of the Space Pirates.

The Space Pirates immediately fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang had only fused five principles and was a second-level Ruler. The invisible pressure he gave people was also at the second-level Ruler level.

The moment the leaders saw Jian Wushuang, they immediately saw his realm.

“The couple didn’t lie. The Ruler of the universe boat is indeed a second-level Ruler!” The eyes of the strong elder lit up, and his face became a little ferocious.

The three third-level Rulers next to him also smiled.

Under normal circumstances, they would not dare to cause trouble for the experts on the universe boat. But when they learned that there were only three people on the universe boat, and that there were two second-level Rulers…and that there was a guard who was suspected to have the combat power of a third-level Ruler, they could not help it.
