Chapter 607: Su Ming’s Survival

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Secret Skills were very overwhelming and horrifying!

In the entire Ancient World, only the Dark Emperor could create a Secret Skill.

The strongest experts, such as the Bone Dragon Emperor and Sir Ming, had never created any Secret Skills. Only with some other techniques, could they have similar battle strength with Dark Emperor.

In terms of offensive power, Dark Emperor’s?Secret Skill was absolutely the best.

What astonished Su Ming, however, was that such a terrifying Secret Skill could be overcome by Jian Wushuang so easily, and the latter was just hurt a little.

“Humph! Dark Emperor was very selfish and only cared about his own interests. Maybe it was because he saw Jian Wushuang has incredible talent or thought about Bone Dragon Emperor, that he showed mercy just now. He has never been planning to protect me.”

“As for that space rift, well, he was just acting. Anyway, the Secret Skill was created by himself, and is so complex that other people cannot tell the difference.” Su Ming laughed coldly.

At this moment...

“Su Ming, come accept your death!”

A roar with rage was suddenly heard by Su Ming. His face became solemn. Then, his figure immediately rushed out. At the next moment, he had appeared in the Void, just standing in front of Jian Wushuang.

Seeing Jian Wushuang, a dark and cold smile appeared on Su Ming’s face. “Jian Wushuang, my good junior brother. You hate me so much, and want to kill me at immediately?”

“It’s good that you know this.” Jian Wushuang shot a glance at Su Ming. “Today, I’ll definitely kill you!”

“Kill me? Haha, you are kidding!” Su Ming suddenly laughed. “Jian Wushuang, you are too arrogant. You think you can kill me because I do not have the Dark Emperor’s protection? You are looking down upon me too much!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression couldn’t help changing slightly when he heard these words.

At this critical moment, Su Ming still had other trump cards?

However, Su Ming stretched out his hand, in which there was a Jade Slip surrounding by slight Thunderbolt power. Looking at this Jade Slip, a flash of coldness appeared in Su Ming’s eyes. “I thought I would use this Jade Slip later in the Ancient World, but now... I have to use it. How unfortunate!”

With a slight sigh, Su Ming slowly gripped the Jade Slip with his right hand. At the next moment, the Jade Slip was crushed.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang had a bad feeling.

As expected, after the Jade Slip was crushed, an incredible blast of power exploded, with dense Space Energy.

The Void above abruptly collapsed, and a huge whirlpool appeared from nowhere, connecting with another space. The other end of the whirlpool was full of mystery. At the sight of the huge whirlpool, many experts, including Bone Dragon Emperor and the Dark Emperor who had retreated to the Darkness Temple, greatly changed their complexion.

Everyone could feel the special aura spreading from that whirlpool.

That aura was alluring.

“Eternal World!”

“This is the channel to the Eternal World!”

Bone Dragon Emperor stared and shouted in a low voice.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

The channel to the Eternal World?

Generally, there was one-way travel from the Ancient World to the Eternal World, and the only way was through the use of the Ancient World Token. However, it was just the regular way.

Yet, sometimes, there was special situation.

Super experts, such as Emperor Xiao and Di Jing, could travel from the Ancient World to the Eternal World freely, and they could even bring someone from the Ancient World to the Eternal World.

Before that, Emperor Xiao had said, if Jian Wushuang could not break through before the Firmament Territory Feast, he would also bring Jian Wushuang to the Eternal World.

But now, the Jade Slip crushed by Su Ming, was apparently a very rare special way to the Eternal World.

“Aha, Jian Wushuang, you think you can kill me?” Seeing this scene, Su Ming was not surprised at all, but stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold smile.

A little while after the huge whirlpool appeared and the special aura was spread out, a figure slowly stepped out from the whirlpool.

This man was wearing a purple robe, on which some Scarlet Thunderbolts were embroidered. His body was strong, with a cold and proud face. He just stood there. Not intentionally, a light aura was spreading out, and the entire earth and heaven fell into a deathly stillness in a moment.

A Scarlet Thunderbolt was surging in the purple-robed man’s eyes, which swept past everyone present. Anyone who was swept by his eyes, even including Bone Dragon Emperor and Dark Emperor, could not help but shiver with terror. They all had a feeling that the purple-robed person could easily kill them with a single thought.

“How frightening!”

“This man!”

Everyone present looked at the purple-robed person with fear.

Just the aura made Bone Dragon Emperor and Dark Emperor extremely terrified. The man’s identity was very clear.

“Someone from the Eternal World!” Bone Dragon Emperor’s pupils shrank. “Like my master, he is a super expert from the Eternal World. But I don’t know who is stronger between the two.”

“Expert from the Eternal World?” Jian Wushuang also stared at the purple-robed person with terror. He could see that, the purple-robed person’s strength was far above the Skyscraping Realm, so he must be a super expert with a higher level strength.

The purple-robed person, who was stared at by everyone, swept around with his eyes filled with Scarlet Thunderbolts, and finally looked at Su Ming. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You are Su Ming, my junior brother?” The purple-robed person slowly spoke, in a low and heavy voice, just like the thunder.

“Su Ming, junior brother?” The experts present were all shocked.

The purple-robed person came after Su Ming crushed the Jade Slip, so they had guessed that Su Ming had some connection with that purple-robed person, but they had never thought that the purple-robed person would call Su Ming his junior brother.

“I am Su Ming. Who are you, my senior brother?” Su Ming looked at the purple-robed person in a modest way.

“My name is Xue Yang, and I am the guiding envoy of the Universal Thunder sect. Before long, Sect Master Lei Xin said that, he had traveled across a lot of Ancient Worlds, where he left some opportunities, and an opportunity was obtained by a little guy called Su Ming. He told me to pay attention to the situation of this Ancient World. Once you crush Sect Master Lei Xin’s pledge token, I’ll come and guide you to the Universal Thunder Sect.” The purple-robed person said in a very polite way to Su Ming.

“I thought you would stay longer in this Ancient World, but you crushed the Jade Slip so early.”

Hearing what Xue Yang said, the people around understood everything.

“So that is what it is. Su Ming obtained an opportunity left by a super expert of the Eternal World and has the chance to the Eternal world. How lucky!”
