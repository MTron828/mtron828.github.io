Chapter 3079: Duan Yu

——

“This Heavenly Sword Marquis is really well-hidden. In the first round of the chaotic battle, he easily passed by relying on his speed and movement techniques. In the second round of the path of reincarnation, he also kept his strength. He only walked 21,000 kilometers before he stopped,” the red-haired man said in a low voice.

“It’s fine. Let’s wait for the third round. The third round is the most important. In addition, Senior Brother Xiong Tao has already passed the second round and his ranking is close to his. If nothing goes wrong, the two of them will soon face each other in the third round. Once he faces Senior Brother Xiong Tao, it will be impossible for him to hold back,” Bai Xiao said.

When they heard Senior Brother Xiong Tao’s words, the eyes of the red-haired man, the beautiful woman in golden armor, and the black-robed young man lit up.

They were all rank one True Saints from the Dao Palace, but they were only average among the rank one True Saints in the Dao Palace.

And Xiong Tao…was widely recognized as the number one rank one True Saint in the Dao Palace!

This time, Xiong Tao had received a message from the top 100 talents and specially came to participate in the genius feast. Of course, he also hid his identity, so he hoped that he could have a fair fight with Jian Wushuang, he wanted to fight with Jian Wushuang for a legitimate reason.

Once Xiong Tao fought with Jian Wushuang, it would be impossible for Jian Wushuang to hold back.

“Let’s see.”

Bai Xiao and the other three were looking forward to it.

The third round of the genius feast was a one-on-one round battle.

The 100 geniuses who reached the third round would draw lots to decide the order of the battle.

The first opponent Jian Wushuang drew was called Duan Yu!

“Duan Yu?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He knew this name because Duan Yu had caused quite a commotion in the second round of the Samsara Road. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In the previous round of the Samsara Road, the only person who had made it to 25,000 miles was Duan Yu!

He was ranked first in the second round of the genius feast!

“The second round of the genius feast depends on the overall strength of one person. Since Duan Yu is ranked first, it’s not surprising that he should be the strongest in this genius feast,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, “I didn’t expect that the opponent I met in the third round would be the strongest in this genius feast. My luck is really good.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but he did not care at all.

In the void beside him.

“Haha, Heavenly Sword Marquis’s luck is really not good. His first opponent is Duan Yu!” The red-haired man laughed loudly.

“I know Duan Yu. He comes from the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion among the three pavilions. He is the number one genius of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. Although he is only a rank one True Saint, it is said that his battle strength is much stronger than ordinary rank three True Saints. In terms of strength, he is stronger than us,” Bai Xiao said.

“Judging from the fact that he just broke through the reincarnation path, Duan Yu’s strength is the strongest in this year’s genius feast, except for Senior Brother Xiong Tao. It seems that senior brother Xiong Tao may not have to fight personally. Duan Yu alone can test the strength of Heavenly Sword Marquis,” the black-robed young man said with a smile.

The four of them focused their attention on the battlefield at the front.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Yu had already appeared on the battlefield.

After seeing Duan Yu, the surrounding spectators looked at Jian Wushuang with pity.

“This guy is really unlucky. His first opponent is Duan Yu!”

“Duan Yu of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion is undoubtedly the strongest in this year’s genius feast. Whoever meets him will be a tragedy!”

“Let’s see how long he can last in Duan Yu’s hands.”

A large number of discussions were heard throughout the mystic realm without any concealment.

Almost no one thought highly of Jian Wushuang. If there was only one person who thought highly of Jian Wushuang, it would be Jiu Luo.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, come on, kill him.” Jiu Luo roared, causing many people around him to roll their eyes.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and Duan Yu were facing each other from a distance.

“Your first opponent in the third round is me. You are really unlucky.” Duan Yu, a half-moon-looking young man in a long robe, crossed his arms and stared at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“Maybe.” Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly.

“I’ll give you a chance. Make your move.” Duan Yu hooked his finger at Jian Wushuang.

“Okay.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. The Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand, and then he moved.

As if he had teleported, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Duan Yu, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand had been slashed out.

“Well, this speed…” Duan Yu was slightly surprised, but a purple saber immediately appeared in his hand.

The purple saber drew a purple shadow in the void and collided with Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword.

Clang!

With a sound of collision, a large amount of divine power crazily spread out in the surroundings.

Duan Yu was originally calm, but when the weapons of both sides collided, his face suddenly sank and his body suddenly trembled.

He raised his head in shock.

However, Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand became illusory and he casually waved it.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang waved it nine times in a row and also displayed a total of nine sword moves.

Although he had displayed nine sword moves at once, it gave people the feeling that he had only displayed one sword move!

It was the ninth heaven of the illusory sword!

The nine sword shadows were all extremely hazy. They overlapped and gathered together. The moment they were unleashed, Duan Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Boom!

A vast aura suddenly swept out from Duan Yu’s body, and a large amount of purple divine thunder swept out.

In an instant, the entire battlefield fell into a purple thunder hell.

The thunder hell completely covered Jian Wushuang and Duan Yu, so that the spectators outside could not see what was going on inside.

Only the crisp sound of metal clashing could be heard from the thunder hell, and the sound was very fast and dense.

In fact, the battle between the two in the thunder hell was indeed very fierce.

Jian Wushuang’s ninth heaven of illusionary sword was like a single move, overlapping with each other. It was so fast that Duan Yu had to Brandish his saber crazily to block Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

“Block it! Block it!”

Duan Yu roared in his heart.

Jian Wushuang’s continuous nine moves of swordsmanship increased the pressure on him.

But suddenly…

Boom!

Thunder hell completely dispersed, and a large amount of purple divine thunder scattered in all directions. Once his body was blown away, he also retreated.

The one who was blown away was Jian Wushuang.

He wiped the corner of his clothes and then raised his left hand. “I admit defeat!”
