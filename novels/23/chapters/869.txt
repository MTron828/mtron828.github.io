Chapter 870: The Prison

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was stupefied by what Qian Yu had said.

Which almighty power had such earthshaking skills that he could create such a huge Stellar Fog Sea and limit the entry of so many experts of the Eternal World above Dao Master level?

“The Stellar Fog Sea is full of Exotic Beasts and various dangers, but the core, Star Island, is the only safe place in the entire fog sea. If the experts who enter the sea and wander around are lucky enough, they will arrive at this Star Island.”

“There were 636 people on Star Island. With you, the number is 667 now,” said Qian Yu.

“636? Such a large number?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Is it?” Qian Yu laughed. “Blood Mountain, do you know how long ago the Stellar Fog Sea was created?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head without thinking.

“It must have been there for at least millions of years, I dare not say any more. And during this long period, some experts took the initiative to enter the Stellar Fog Sea to look for opportunities, and some were driven to the wall by their enemies and could only escape into the Stellar Fog Sea to try their luck. How many people do you think that would be in total?” Qian Yu grinned.

“That number would be terrifying!”

“But once they enter the Stellar Fog Sea, they will only have two possible endings.”

“One ending is for those with bad luck. They will wander around the Stellar Fog Sea, and be killed when they run into Exotic Beasts or some other trouble. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The other ending is for those with good luck like us, who come to this Star Island and live here for good after a long period of wandering.”

“Since ancient times, so many experts have entered the Stellar Fog Sea. But only six hundred people were lucky enough to reach Star Island. Is that a large number? It’s in fact very, very small. The vast majority of people have been killed by the Exotic Beasts while wandering in the Stellar Fog Sea.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded to himself.

Indeed, if these people on Star Island were all the experts who had survived in the Stellar Fog Sea for thousands of years, then just over 600 people was indeed a pitifully small number.

“We were lucky enough to get to Star Island and survive, but in fact, it is better to die than to live here,” said Qian Yu.

“It is better to die than to live?” Jian Wushuang was in a daze.

“Blood Mountain, I just said that Star Island is a huge prison. Although it can guarantee our lives as long as we stay here, it is perpetually enshrouded in darkness, and we have little to no chance of leaving,” Qian Yu explained.

“The long years are so boring, dull and dark. This kind of day is basically torture to human beings!”

“Many people can’t stand this kind of boring life. They would rather leave Star Island to wander in the fog sea and die at last than stay here.”

“Besides, there are some people who have been trapped on Star Island for millions of years and their minds have long been completely warped. They become crazy, so most people on the island are maniacs!”

“Like Shi Mo with whom you just fought. I heard that when he entered Star Island, he was quite a decent man. After being trapped for a million years on this island, he has become crazy and evil. Whenever a newcomer arrives, he will come out. If the newcomer is strong, nothing bad will happen. If not, he will be tortured and even ravaged.”

“After all, Star Island is very special. On this island, people can’t die. No matter how a person is tortured, he will not die.”

“Can’t die?” Jian Wushuang was in a daze. “I have just…”

He had clearly crushed Shi Mo’s life core, but he did not die.

“Yes, you couldn’t kill Shi Mo, not because of his special skill but because of the peculiarity of Star Island. There is a special restriction here. Once someone’s life is in danger, the restriction will be activated to protect his life,” said Qian Yu.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly as the questions on his mind were finally answered.

“Blood Mountain, you have just arrived at Star Island, so this place is still new to you. And there are some pretty good opportunities here. So you will not find it dull for a hundred thousand years, but after a few million years, you will be just like us.” Qian Yu’s face was full of confusion and despair.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank and he asked, “Is there really no possibility of leaving this Stellar Fog Sea?”

“Not exactly.”

“If there weren’t any possibility, the people on the island would have died in the fog sea long ago. Who would want to stay here and live this dull miserable life?” Qian Yu smiled faintly.

“However, the possibility is too low. It’s negligible.”

“Since the Stellar Fog Sea was created so many people have come to Star Island. But only one person has ever left alive.”

“Someone left alive?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes became bright and he quickly asked, “Who was it?”

“He was called Star King. He left four million years ago.”

“Star King?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had never heard of an expert in the Eternal World named Star King.

Besides, he had never heard of someone leaving the Stellar Fog Sea alive.

But what had happened to Star King?

“Qian Yu, how can we leave here?” Jian Wushuang continued to ask.

“There are two ways to leave here. The first one is to pass the tests set by Lord Spirit Sound.”

“Lord Spirit Sound?” Jian Wushuang was curious.

“Lord Spirit Sound is the servant of the almighty who created the Stellar Fog Sea. She controls Star Island. There’s a Black Tower on the island and there are three tests to pass there. If you can pass these three tests, Lord Spirit Sound will let you go,” said Qian Yu.

“It’s that simple?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“Simple?” Qian Yu sneered. “Blood Mountain, you have never experienced the three difficult tests. There are so many experts on the island and most of them are at the peak of the Eternal Realm. But do you know how many experts have passed the first test?”

“How many?” Jian Wushuang looked at Qian Yu.

“Twelve, only twelve!”

Qian Yu said in a solemn voice, “These twelve people are called the Twelve Heavenly Kings. All of them are top geniuses. Eleven of them could only pass the first test, and there was only one who could pass the second test!”

“And the reason why this one could pass the second test is that after he passed the first test he had the opportunity to cultivate his Secret Skill on Star Island and greatly improve his strength.”

“As for the third test, no one has passed it but Star King four million years ago.”
