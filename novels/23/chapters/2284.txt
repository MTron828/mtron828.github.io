Chapter 2285 Spacetime Reversal

In contrast to Emperor Thirteen and One Star Man, the beautiful woman, the bald man and the woman in crimson clothes stared right at the man. All three of them were enraged and in disbelief.“Old man, it is you!!”

The beautiful woman roared with shock in her eyes.

There was also a hint of fear in her eyes.

Yes, fear!

As a Master of the Holy Land, she was already on an equal level to Heaven’s Will. By rights, there should be nothing in this world that she would fear. However, Xuan Yi was an anomaly!

“Damn it. You should already be dead. How are you in this world?” roared the woman in crimson clothes.

“Yes. He is dead. This is probably a consciousness incarnation. If I am not wrong, he has been scheming in this Heaven and Earth for a long time. This passageway should also be part of his plan,” the bald man said.

“You are smart. I indeed have died. Even though my divine body was destroyed, my will was not!”

As he spoke, the aura that Xuan Yi had completely changed.

He was originally a gentle, ordinary man who had a warm smile. Instantly, he turned into the most powerful man in the world.

He stood there coldly. It was as though he was a mountain of ice. His eyes seemed so deep it was as though they contained trillions of stars. There was a will within his eyes that made the Heaven, the Earth and all sentient beings bow down to him.

No one could compare to him, even Masters of the Holy Land.

It felt like he could take on the Heavens, fight the Earth and dominate all sentient beings.

Even Heaven and Earth would submit to him.

If Jian Wushuang had still been awake and seen Xuan Yi, he would have been shocked.

The aura that Xuan Yi had now was the exact same as the bold man Jian Wushuang had seen in the Ancient Display within the gigantic head. The bold man who could battle the Heavens, fight the Earth and dominate all sentient beings. Even Heaven’s Will backed off when facing him!

That’s right. Xuan Yi was the bold man.

He was the owner of the gigantic head around the Green Fire World!!

He was the protagonist of the Great Battle of the Ancient Past aeons ago.

In the space around Heaven’s Horizon, within the area covered in grey mist, a passageway and a reincarnation passage had opened.

The entire Heaven and Earth fell silent.

All of the experts present widened their eyes and stared at Xuan Yi.

Countless experts felt compelled to bow down to Xuan Yi even though it was just a consciousness incarnation.

A consciousness incarnation was different from a consciousness embodiment. A consciousness embodiment had a portion of the person’s fighting spirit. The beautiful woman and the other two Masters of the Holy Land sent their consciousness embodiments here.

On the other hand, a consciousness incarnation was mere will. Under normal circumstances, it would not possess any power at all.

Even so, countless experts felt compelled to worship Xuan Yi’s consciousness incarnation and the three Masters of the Holy Land shuddered in fear.

Two figures appeared beside Xuan Yi. They were Emperor Thirteen and One Star Man.

“After so many years of hard work, we have finally reached where we are today,” Emperor Thirteen said coldly. Even so, one could clearly see the excitement in his eyes.

“Yes, I had forgotten how long we have planned and prepared for this day. Luckily, everything is going as planned. There have not been any major screw ups. Of course, I have to thank both of you for this,” Xuan Yi said with a deep voice.

“Both of us know what we should be doing. As long as the plan can come to fruition, our sacrifices will be worth it, no matter what we have to do. However, can we actually realise the plan?” Emperor Thirteen knitted his eyebrows and said.

“I have no idea. However, this is our last chance.” Xuan Yi said.

Emperor Thirteen and One Star Man fell silent.

Just like Xuan Yi said, this was indeed their last chance.

It was the last hope for the Seven Star Black Sect and this Heaven and Earth.

Xuan Yi stopped talking. The Picture Scroll World that was fused into Heaven and Earth turned back into the small Picture Scroll World and appeared in his hand. He then looked at the area covered in black mist where Jian Wushuang died.

There was only a large reincarnation passage there. No figures nor auras could be felt.

All of Jian Wushuang’s divine power had been annihilated under the ocean of red divine power.

Jian Wushuang died.

He had indeed died. Everyone saw it unfold before their very eyes.

Xuan Yi also knew that Jian Wushuang had died. He started to radiate a unique energy.

Xuan Yi pointed at where Jian Wushuang was with his right index finger.

The unique energy instantly filled the entire space.

“Spacetime Reversal!”

Xuan Yi said softly.

Instantly, changes started to occur to the spacetime in that area.

The entire spacetime, apart from the reincarnation passage, started to reverse.

Within moments, the spacetime showed the moment that Jian Wushuang was annihilated by the ocean of red divine power.

At this moment, a ray of excitement flashed through Xuan Yi’s eyes.

“Freeze!”

Two rays of light glowed in the reversed spacetime.

The two rays of light were two souls.

One of them belonged to Jian Wushuang while the other belonged to Leng Ruxue.

“Come here.”

Xuan Yi waved his hands as the two souls flew into Xuan Yi’s hand.

The entire process occured within moments. The three Masters of the Holy Land watched the entire process unfold before their eyes, yet they could not do anything to stop Xuan Yi.

Even if they wanted to, they could not.

Spacetime Reversal was such an incredible technique that even they would have needed certain conditions to have pulled it off back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World when they were at their primes. There was no way they could pull it off or cast this technique in this Heaven and Earth with the presence of the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

If they tried to stop Xuan Yi by force, their consciousness embodiments would crumble instantly.

Hence, all they could do was watch Xuan Yi cast Spacetime Reversal to reform Jian Wushuang and Leng Ruxue’s souls.
