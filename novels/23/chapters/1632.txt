Chapter 1633: A Big Secret

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

King Gu Tong went to the battlefield directly via the space crack instead of passing through the great formation which contained a spacetime storm. Hence, it was normal for him to go unnoticed by the Green Fire Palace.

However, how about Dao Yuanzi of the Holocaust Sect? How did he go into the Green Fire World?

Jian Wushuang’s mind was filled with doubts.

“The battlefield that your hometown is at is not normal. After arriving there, I only did a simple search and I found quite a number of treasures and opportunities. Hence, I concluded immediately that there is definitely a big secret and opportunities hidden in that battlefield!”

“I also saw the hope of making a breakthrough to an Eight-star Ancient God on that battlefield!”

After saying that, King Gu Tong could not help but clench his fists.

It was clear that the battlefield that the Green Fire World was at contained a big secret and many opportunities at that period of time. Even if it were King Gu Tong, he was also unable to remain calm about this fact.

“After that, for a period of time, I searched for opportunities all around the battlefield. I even used certain means to get many experts under me to search that battlefield. After searching for a very long period of time, we managed to find a few opportunities. Moreover, the longer I stayed at the battlefield, the more frightened I felt about it!”

“However, apart from opportunities, that battlefield was also full of danger. In the end, I underestimated it. Originally, I had thought that with my abilities as a top Seven-star Ancient God, I would be able to deal with the dangers even if I were to come across them in that battlefield. Indeed, I had managed to deal with the two dangers I encountered previously. However, during the third time… not only did it cost me all my best experts, I was also affected by this sinister corrosive power.”

“This power corroded my Ancient God Power as well as the Bloodline of my body to the point that my abilities dropped to the most primitive, lowest state. Moreover, if this power continues to corrode my body, my blood and my Ancient God body will be corroded completely which also means that I will be sucked dry and die as a result of this power!”

“At that point of time, I really thought that I would die and I had given up all hope. However, at the most critical moment, your Master, Xuan Yi, appeared,” King Gu Tong looked over.

“Master?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Your Master and I made a deal. He manufactured an elixir to help me stop this sinister power from further corroding my body. Moreover, he also gave me a Method to allow me to use my own power to remove this sinister power. Since I owe him a favor, he brought me to your hometown Green Fire World,” King Gu Tong said.

“This is the same as what Master said,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

Jian Wushuang had asked his Master Xuan Yi about King Gu Tong before.

Moreover, what Xuan Yi said was similar to what King Gu Tong had said.

“As for what happened next, you know it yourself. I continued to stay in the Green Fire World to get rid of the sinister power. However, the process was extremely slow. It was not until an unforeseen event where you appeared occurred that Xuan Yi made me take action. After I took action, my deal with him was complete. Hence, I naturally brought my people and left. However, even though I returned to the Ancient God Sanctuary, the sinister power inside my body is still not completely gone and it will take a period of time to be removed,” King Gu Tong said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood completely.

“King Gu Tong, you said that you followed the space crack of a mystery land and ended up at the battlefield of my hometown. Where is that space crack?” Jian Wushaung questioned seriously.

That was a space crack which would lead anyone straight to the battlefield of his hometown. As soon as it was discovered and news of it spread, it would definitely attract a great number of experts to go to the battlefield of his hometown.

Not to mention the fact that the treasures and opportunities of the battlefield were plundered by the experts, the most important thing was the safety of the Green Fire World!

That was his hometown.

“Don’t worry. The mystery land that the space crack is at is not normal and it will require a long period of time before it opens up. Currently, there is still a period of time before it opens up again. Moreover, even if that mystery land were to open up again, no one will discover that space crack. After all, that space crack is hidden extremely well,” King Gu Tong said.

“That’s still not too bad,” Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief and said earnestly after that: “King Gu Tong, please do not let anyone know about that space crack or the battlefield in my hometown.”

“No problem,” King Gu Tong nodded his head straight away, “Although that battlefield contains a big secret and great opportunities, it is considered a nightmarish place to me. In my remaining life, I will not want to take a second step into that place. Hence, I will naturally not tell anyone about it either.”

“Thank you very much,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“Jian Wushuang, although I will not tell anyone about that space crack or the battlefield in your hometown, I still have to remind you that the battlefield in your hometown is not normal. It might be a giant battlefield which has been passed down from ancient times. In other words, the giant battlefield has been passed down during the Ancient God Emperor’s generation.”

“Countless top experts have fallen in that battlefield. Moreover, those top experts did not consist of solely human beings but of many special clans as well. For example, within your hometown Green Fire World, there is quite a number of descendants of special clans which is inclusive of the descendants of the Ancient God Clan. All of this should be due to that ancient battlefield,” King Gu Tong said.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave.

He had already made some guesses about what King Gu Tong had said.

Within the Green Fire World, there were descendants from many special clans.

For example, he was a descendant of the Ancient God Clan and he possessed the Ancient God Bloodline which would be awakened when the opportunity came.

Apart from that, there were also the Heavenly Monster Bloodline, Sky-devouring Clan Bloodline, Crimson Phoenix Clan Bloodline and many more. Most of them were top Bloodlines.

The Green Fire World was completely isolated from the Eternal Chaotic World. Under normal circumstances, how could there be descendants left behind by so many special clans?

There was only one answer and it was definitely related to the top experts of many special clans dying on that ancient battlefield.

“Jian Wushuang, you came to the Ancient God Sanctuary for the Ancient God Unique Skills and Secret Skills, right?” King Gu Tong looked over.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“However, you are a Mixed Bloodline between Ancient Gods and human beings. Hence, it is impossible for you to join the Ancient God Palace by normal means,” King Gu Tong said.

“That’s indeed the case. Hence, I could only challenge the Star Moon Tower. Moreover, I have cleared the sixth level,” Jian Wushuang said.

“The sixth level?” King Gu Tong raised his eyebrows and he was not surprised, “An Inverse Cultivator is indeed impressive.”

“King Gu Tong, you knew that I was an Inverse Cultivator since long ago?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Of course. I could tell back when I was in your hometown,” King Gu Tong laughed.

“Then, did my Master know that I was an Inverse Cultivator a long time ago as well?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Since I was able to tell, your Master definitely knew about it a long time ago,” King Gu Ton giggled. “Your Master is the most mysterious and most unfathomable expert of all the numerous experts I have seen in my whole life.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
