Chapter 3568: The Most Powerful Ultimate Skill, Starfire Burning Sun! Translation

Another 1,200 years passed in a flash. Jian Wushuang had been trapped in this high platform for 3,000 years, including the 1,800 years he had spent before.

During the 1,200 years, Jian Wushuang did not move at all. He had been sitting cross-legged and thinking about various sword techniques. It was not until this moment that he slowly opened his eyes.

“It’s about time. If the evolution of swordsmanship in my mind is correct, then the final sword move that I have evolved should be able to reach the level of the strongest ultimate skill. Now I can only keep trying and practicing it.” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, then he stood up.

He glanced at the motionless humanoid sculpture with its eyes closed, and in the next moment, he directly rushed out.

The moment he moved, the human-shaped statue immediately woke up and rushed forward with a dark-black longsword in its hand.

The two of them met head-on on the high platform. Jian Wushuang did not dodge and directly used his swordsmanship to meet it head-on.

“Cut!”

A low shout came out of Jian Wushuang’s mouth, and the shadow-killing sword in his hand turned into a purple graceful sword. It was extremely violent and swift.

The human-shaped statue also slashed out its dark black longsword.

The two sword shadows collided head-on.

Bang!

A low sound of collision rang out. The two powerful forces collided, but the human-shaped statue was the first to be unable to withstand it. It took a few steps back.

“As expected, I have the upper hand.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The sword skill he had just displayed was the sword skill that had evolved in his mind over the past 1,200 years.

In his opinion, this swordsmanship could reach the level of the strongest absolute art. However, because he had just evolved it and had not really tried to practice it, it was naturally impossible for him to directly reach the level of the strongest absolute art, however, it was still much stronger than the average peak level six absolute art.

Therefore, he had gained the upper hand when he fought head-on with the human-shaped sculpture.

This was the first time that Jian Wushuang had gained the upper hand in the collision with the human-shaped sculpture after being trapped on the high platform for so many years.

“I have just evolved, and now I have such power. It proves that my evolution is not wrong. Next, I just need to keep practicing.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining. “Again!”

He immediately rushed toward the human-shaped sculpture again and chose to fight head-on.

Bang!

It was another confrontation. Jian Wushuang used the same sword move, but the power of this sword move was obviously a little stronger than the previous one, and it had a greater advantage in the collision with the human-shaped sculpture.

“Haha, continue!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was full of smiles as he rushed forward to meet the human-shaped sculpture head-on again and again.

He attacked again and again, displaying the swordsmanship that had evolved over 1,200 years. During this practice, the power of the swordsmanship had been increasing.

At first, he only had a slight advantage in the head-on collision with the human-shaped sculpture, but gradually, the advantage grew until it was completely crushed. Every head-on collision.., the human-shaped sculpture was almost pushed back by him by hundreds of feet.

Until the 171st collision between Jian Wushuang and the human-shaped sculpture.

“It’s like a volcano that has been dormant for many years suddenly erupting. The most important part of my sword attack is the instantaneous explosive power!”

“Instantaneous...explosive power!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light, and the Shadow Divine Sword in his hand emitted a faint purple cold light. In an instant, he slashed out.

The sword shadow swept across the air, but in the process, it seemed to form a burning purple flame and instantly covered the human-shaped sculpture.

After all, the human-shaped sculpture had no intelligence and was only blindly using sword skills to resist. However, when the two sword lights collided, the purple flame contained an earth-shaking power, it was like a volcano that had been silent for hundreds of millions of years suddenly exploded and destroyed the world in an instant.

Boom!

A violent explosion was heard, and the surrounding void faintly trembled.

The human-shaped sculpture had been completely swallowed by the terrifying power that erupted from the Shadow Divine Sword.

Whoosh!

Like a meteor, the human-shaped sculpture was completely blown away and directly flew out of the high platform. However, because of the material of the human-shaped sculpture, Jian Wushuang’s sword attack did not really cause any damage to it.

However, the result of sending the human-shaped statue out of the high platform was already a pleasant surprise to Jian Wushuang.

“The most powerful ultimate skill has been achieved!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes filled with unconcealable ecstasy.

The moment he sent the human-shaped statue out of the high platform, he knew that the power of his sword attack had indeed reached the level of the most powerful ultimate skill.

After 1,800 years of refining and upgrading his swordsmanship, and then 1,000 years of evolution, he finally created his most powerful ultimate skill.

He had already thought of the name of this ultimate skill.

“When this swordsmanship is performed, it’s like a sky full of sparks devouring everything. Its name should be Starfire Burning Sun!” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

The most powerful absolute art created by Jian Wushuang, Starfire Burning Sun, was born.

When Jian Wushuang created Starfire Burning Sun and sent the human-shaped sculpture flying out of the high platform, the first consciousness woke up again in the deepest part of this special space-time.

“He created the most powerful level six absolute art in just 3,000 years? He’s quite capable.”

The consciousness could not help but praise him at first, but then he said, “But he has already created a top-tier skill of the sixth rank when he arrived, so his starting point is quite high. It’s not too shocking for him to create the strongest skill of the sixth rank in 3,000 years. Moreover, the Immortal Saint can’t just create the strongest skill of the sixth rank to pass the 18-skill formation. He is still far from passing the 18-skill formation.”

With that, the consciousness went silent again.

Of course, Jian Wushuang did not know the existence of this consciousness at all, nor did he know how it evaluated him. He was only happy and surprised at his breakthrough in swordsmanship, at the same time, he began to look forward to the human-shaped sculpture array.

“I have created the most powerful skill of the sixth realm. A single human-shaped sculpture is no longer a threat to me, but I wonder if I can break out of this high platform now.”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang arrived at the central area of the high platform in the next moment.
