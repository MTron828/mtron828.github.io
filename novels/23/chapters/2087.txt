Chapter 2088 Ba Su

Everyone at the banquet fell silent after hearing what Jian Wushuang had just said.

Every expert was shocked beyond words.

Even though the way he had said it was tactful, the meaning behind the words was clear. Jian Wushaung was challenging Ba Su!

He was challenging the most powerful man among the Special Tribes!!

Even King Chen Xing, who was standing beside the Jian Wushuang, was stunned. He secretly transmitted a message to Jian Wushuang. “Ancient God Emperor, Ba Su is an extremely strong opponent. I fought him years ago and his fighting power was top tier amongst the stage two great emperors. What if he even reaches the power level of a stage three great emperor. If you were to fight him, what if…”

“No worries.” Jian Wushaung waved him off. His eyes were still set on Ba Su as he smiled, “What will your reply be, Mr Ba Su?”

Everyone shifted their vision to Ba Su.

They anticipated his reply.

Even though most of the experts hated the Sky Swallowing Clan, they still had to admit that Ba Su was the strongest man.

The only person who could barely come close in a fight was King Chen Xing.

No one knew much about the new Ancient God Emperor. Could he really go toe to toe against Ba Su?

Ba Su smiled creepily. He looked at Jian Wushuang and replied, “Since it’s a request from the Ancient God Emperor, why would I reject?”

“Please, follow me.”

Jian Wushaung stood up and flew towards a vast space.

Ba Su smiled indifferently as he followed suit.

They stood facing each other in the vast space. The crowd looked at them, excited.

On one side was the new Ancient God Emperor. On the other was the leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan.

Both of them had enormous power within their respective clans.

This battle was much anticipated.

Most of the experts, from the bottom of their hearts, hoped that Jian Wushaung would win.

The outcome of this battle determined the leader of the Special Tribes Alliance.

“I don’t care if I became the leader of the alliance as long as the experts in the Special Tribes are willing to help in dealing with the Three-Emperor’s World. However, no one from the Sky Swallowing Clan can be the leader.”

Jian Wushaung stood there motionless. He looked at Ba Su as his gaze turned cold.

He had just gotten word from the Sanctuary Alliance that the Sky Swallowing Clan was working with the Acheron Palace secretly. Who knew what would happen if they became the leader of the alliance.

Hence, anyone could become the leader of the alliance.

Anyone but Ba Su.

“Mr Ba Su, let’s fight.” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Ba Su had a playful grin on his face. He thought to himself: ‘If I can successfully become the leader of the Special Tribes Alliance, more than half of the plans my clan have will be complete. What follows will be much easier. As for the Ancient God Emperor… Haha, he thinks too highly of himself.’

Ba Su did not take Jian Wushuang seriously.

He had gotten to know things about Jian Wushuang through Acheron Palace.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had fighting power equivalent to that of a stage two great emperor. He would be on par or just a little stronger than King Chen Xing.

He was not worried at all.

“I will not go easy on you. From the looks of it you are really confident, my dear Ancient God Emperor.” Ba Su smiled coldly. Right then, HUM!!!

A wave of exceptionally strong bloodline power radiated from Ba Su as stripes of golden secret restrictions appeared on his face. His body turned from that of a normal human into that of an enormous golden bat.

The same secret restrictions appeared all over the body of the bat.

“A bat?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The first member of the Sky Swallowing Clan he met could also turn into a bat.

However, that bat did not possess a pure bloodline power. His fighting power was pathetic.

The Sky Swallowing Bat in front of Jian Wushuang was completely gold. Ba Su, too, had the bloodline power of an emperor.

“This Ba Su. He revealed his true form since the beginning?”

“What an overbearing aura. Is this the power of the strongest man among the Special Tribes?”

Many of the spectators showed fear when they saw the golden bat.

Ba Su’s face was covered with golden secret restrictions. He thought to himself, ‘I shall not waste time. I will end this battle fast and defeat him!’

Ba Su opened his mouth suddenly as a glint of cruelty flashed across his eyes.

“SCREECH!!!”

A stern hiss was heard as it reverberated through the air.

This high-pitched sound was painful for the ears. Most of the audience could not help but cover their ears.

Jian Wushuang felt an overpowering energy swept over him without any warning as the sound was heard.

‘This is … soul attack?”

Jian Wushuang turned pale. His self-defense mechanism was so strong that he was basically unkillable.

However, his soul was not very powerful.

This soul attack was the strongest attack Jian Wushuang had ever encountered.

This attack was too sudden and Jian Wushuang was not prepared for it. It was obvious that he was slow in trying to protect himself against this attack.

Hum!

By the time he had recovered from the attack, his head was still spinning. He saw a golden claw appear in front of him.

It was as though the golden claw was a bolt of golden lightning. It tore the void apart mercilessly. There was nothing obstructing its path as the claw swept over Jian Wushuang.

A terrifying aura and tearing force erupted from the attack. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Under the influence of the aura, Jian Wushuang turned into a meteorite and crashed down towards the ground.

Bang!

The entire earth shook and a large crater was formed. Jian Wushaung lay at the bottom of the crater, lifeless.

Every audience was shocked.

“Ancient God Emperor!” The experts from the Ancient God Clan panicked.

Ba Su stood tall on the void above the crater. He reverted back into human form. He mocked, “I thought that the new Ancient God Emperor could at least put up a fight. I did not expect him to be so weak.”

The entire Ancient God Clan was enraged upon hearing this.

Right then…

“Mr Ba Su, isn’t it too early to celebrate?” Jian Wushuang said suddenly.
