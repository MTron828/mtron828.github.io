Chapter 2602: The First Piece of Treasure

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a room on the second floor of the auction site, Jian Wushuang stood alone while looking down below.

“This room is pretty good. No matter what treasures I buy from this room, no one would know who I am. I don’t need to be afraid of being targeted,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

In the center of the display stage came a figure in a golden robe.

“Golden robe? Is this the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes went narrow.

The weakest among the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief was a Peak Earth Ultimate God. The stronger ones were Heaven Ultimate Gods. The one who appeared on the display stage was a Heaven Ultimate God.

“San Shouwang did say that he has an older brother who’s the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief before passed away. I wonder if it’s true.” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

San Shouwang did mention he had an older brother who was the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief before his death. It could be a possibility it was an empty threat toward Jian Wushuang for him to escape death. Regardless, Jian Wushuang felt it would be best to stay on guard nonetheless.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang was wary when he saw the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief.

“Everyone!”

The Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief called out in a thick and magnificent voice. His voice spread out along with his Heaven Ultimate God divine power which echoed vigorously throughout the auction site.

This huge auction site instantly fell into silence with everyone having their eyes on the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief.

The Golden Chief cleared his throat before saying, “I would like to welcome all of you for participating in our Star Picking Pavilion’s auction. Although this auction isn’t considered a top-tier auction in Danyang Holy Domain, the level of treasures auctioned are still reasonably high and won’t disappoint you.

“Without further ado, let’s begin the auction now. Let’s start with the first treasure. Please have a look.”

The Golden Chief announced loudly. An old gray stone staff appeared on the display stage with a wave of his hand.

The old gray stone staff was exuding a vast aura of soul power. That was Jian Wushuang’s Spiritual Stone Staff!

As soon as the Spiritual Stone Staff appeared, it immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“Is this...a treasure related to soul power?”

“Yes, it’s an offensive divine soul weapon which has reached the Heavenly Treasure level based on its power!”

“Oh my god, the first treasure to be auctioned is a Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon!”

There was an uproar from the crowd as everyone’s eyes instantly lit up.

The offensive divine soul weapon Heavenly Treasure was rarely used in real battles because not many people were good at soul attacks. It was something useless for them even if they managed to bid for it anyway, but they were still cheering excitedly.

The reason behind those cheers was due to how precious and rare that treasure was. If the first treasure to be auctioned was already so valuable, the other upcoming treasures must be of similar qualities. Everyone was looking forward to the auction’s upcoming treasures.

The auction of the Spiritual Stone Staff must be carried out at the same time of course. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Golden Chief grandiosity said, “Spiritual Stone Staff—a Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon. I don’t have to explain further about how precious it is. Let’s start with the auction with the starting bid of ten million Primordial Stones!”

The shocking amount of 10,000,000 Primordial Stones was only the starting bid.

However, everyone present was also aware the starting bid of 10,000,000 Primordial Stones was not expensive at all for an offensive divine soul weapon Heavenly Treasure.

There were people instantly rushing to bid.

“Fifteen million Primordial Stones!”

“Eighteen million!”

“Twenty-three million!”

...

The following incoming bids quickly rose the Spiritual Stone Staff’s price to 35,000,000 Primordial Stones and it was still going up frantically.

The bidders were experts who stayed in the second and third-floor rooms. The bids coming from the second floor were not many with most of them being the Heaven Ultimate Gods who were fighting neck-to-neck on the third floor.

At that moment, there were five people gathered in a room on the third floor.

Among the five were four Heaven Ultimate Gods with the weakest person being a beautiful woman. The beautiful woman’s strength was weak and pitiful in comparison to the four Heaven Ultimate Gods since she was only a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God. However, it was that weaker beautiful woman who sat leisurely in this room whereas the four Heaven Ultimate Gods stood respectfully behind her.

It was obvious that the beautiful woman had a great background.

“The first treasure to be auctioned is a Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon. I can see that Star Picking Pavilion is quite serious in their game. I was initially not very interested in this auction, but now I’m a little keen.” The beautiful woman smiled lightly and she eyed the Spiritual Stone Staff again.

“One hundred million!”

Those were simple words that emerged from the beautiful woman’s lips. However, everyone in the room and those who were on the auction site heard her.

The noisy auction site was silent once again.

Many people were wide-eyed with horror.

Even the experts from the second and third-floor rooms who were still competing for the Spiritual Stone Staff earlier went silent.

100,000,000!

The bidding price had just risen to 40,000,000 Primordial Stones but it quickly became 100,000,000 Primordial Stones.

Who would dare to call after that bidding price?

“It must be from the DongFang Clan judging from the room’s voice, right?”

“I guess only they have such courage.”

“They sure are filthy rich!”

“The Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon is something rare. I finally saw it and I tried to bring it back, but I can’t fight against her since someone from the DongFang Clan has raised the bid.”

After a moment of hesitation, the experts in those rooms gave up the bidding.

No way! Firstly, the bid was too high at 100,000,000 Primordial Stones which would make it the highest price ever paid for a Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon. In most people’s opinion, the Spiritual Stone Staff might not even worth 100,000,000 Primordial Stones.

Secondly, the one who bid... There were many experts around but only a few dared to compete with her.

The auction of the Spiritual Stone Staff was soon over with its final price being 100,000,000 Primordial Stones. The beautiful woman in the third-floor room had won the bid.

After concluding the bid, the beautiful woman glanced at an old man in purple in front of her and said, “Elder Xue, you are quite accomplished in soul attacks. Unfortunately, you have been unable to maximize the soul attack’s effect due to a lack of suitable offensive divine soul weapons. I’ll leave the Spiritual Stone Staff with you and hope that you can use it well.”

“Thank you, Miss.” The old man dressed in purple was so excited and quickly thanked the woman.

The beautiful woman waved her hand like she did not care at all.

100,000,000 Primordial Stones were nothing to her.
