Chapter 718: Xuan Yi’s Anger (Part 3)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The whole area was completely silent, except for the sounds of the seven ice-cold corpses slowly hitting the ground.

The seven people who survived, swallowed and stood there with their eyes wide opened due to their extreme fear.

Watching this, the experts of the other Sects were filled with shock.

They all knew that the Ancient Sect Palace Master, Xuan Yi, was terrifying and domineering, but nobody knew how powerful he really was.

In the beginning, they believed that Xuan Yi might be strong enough to fight the 14 Eternal Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard, but they thought it would be a tough fight. They didn’t expect him to kill them with only… one attack!

With only one attack, he had killed seven experts from Cloud Sea Asgard. That incredible sword move frightened everyone. Apparently, Xuan Yi was still holding back his strength or else all 14 of them would be dead.

Such terrifying strength!

Such overwhelming strength!

After seeing his strength, some of them started to wonder if Xuan Yi had broken through and become a supreme Dao Master.

It seemed to them that only a legendary Dao Master could perform such an incredible sword move.

“Go back and tell your Palace Master, nobody kills my disciples, no matter how badly they want to. You should be grateful that my disciple was not actually killed by your Cloud Sea Asgard. Otherwise… Humph!” Xuan Yi’s voice reverberated throughout the area.

Although Xuan Yi didn’t finish, everyone understood what he meant.

The seven people survived, including Lady Red, were suppressing their fear deep down inside of them, not daring to say a thing. They promptly told it in secret to Yun Fan, the Great Elder, and the Palace Master behind them.

“Cloud Sea Asgard has already given me an explanation. Now, it’s the Immortal Dynasty’s and Boundless Demon Sect’s turn.” Xuan Yi looked towards the experts of the Immortal Dynasty and Boundless Demon Sect, those two big groups.

Fear swept over these experts when they saw him staring at them.

The uncaged and untamed middle-aged man who led Immortal Dynasty promptly said, “Mr. Xuan Yi, the Immortal Dynasty didn’t hurt your disciple.”

“Neither did our Boundless Demon Sect,” said the people of the Boundless Demon Sect.

At this time, they absolutely would not dare to admit that they had intended to hurt Jian Wushuang.

As for An Chao of the Boundless Demon Sect, who had actually chased after Jian Wushuang, he was definitely the most frightened one. He was terrified that he would be got caught by Xuan Yi, the same way Wu Dao was, then controlled and forced to tell the truth. If that happened, he would definitely meet a very miserable end.

“If you two magnates give me ten million Divine Gems each, I will not get to the bottom of this. As for each of the other top Sects, you should give me one million Divine Gems. Anyone have a problem with that?” Xuan Yi’s voice grew cold.

“Okay, no problem.”

“No problem.”

The Immortal Dynasty, Boundless Demon Sect and those top Sects in the area were totally overawed by Xuan Yi’s strength, so no one dared to go against him.

They knew that Xuan Yi was taking advantage of the situation. However, they did have the ulterior motives. After all, they did make plans against Jian Wushuang. The Immortal Dynasty and Boundless Demon Sect even fought with him, so they definitely did not want to face a situation similar to the experts of Cloud Sea Asgard and have half of their experts killed.

Within a short amount of time, these Sects brought out enough Divine Gem to pacify Xuan Yi.

“Okay, let’s forget it! If anyone has any complaints, feel free to tell them to come find me.”

After he said that, he gave a profound look toward the seven remaining people in Cloud Sea Asgard and left with a wave of his sleeves.

While watching Xuan Yi leave, the experts finally sighed in relief.

Even the eight Eternal Realm experts from the Ancient Sect felt a sense of relief.

Palace Master Destruction said immediately, “I finally know why Xuan Yi is not interested in the opportunities in the Eternal Zone. He is so powerful that he is not inferior to Dao Master. So, why would he care these small benefits?”

“Exactly,” Mo Tao nodded and continued. “I knew Xuan Yi was powerful,?but I didn’t know he had reached such a high level. No wonder the other Sects are so afraid of him.”

“I’m sure Cloud Sea Asgard is full of regret now that they’ve lost seven Eternal Realm experts.”

“Cloud Sea Asgard did suffer a big loss. I suppose they will try to cause trouble for Xuan Yi in the future.”

“Cause trouble for Xuan Yi? Hmph! I don’t think any of them have the guts to do that except for their Palace Master himself.”

“Xuan Yi is quite crafty though. He personally killed people in Cloud Sea Asgard, but he only extorted the other two magnates for 10 million Divine Gems each. So, he didn’t offend them as badly as he did Cloud Sea Asgard. And, Cloud Sea Asgard won’t be able to do anything to him on their own.”

The surrounding experts from each Sect continued to talk about what just happened while constantly glancing towards the remaining seven Eternal Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard.

In the area where Cloud Sea Asgard had gathered, Lady Red’s face had turned dark-red because of all the bizarre looks she felt coming from her surroundings. At this moment, a Message Token in her possession reacted. Of course, the owner of this token was their Palace Master.

“Palace Master has sent a message.”

Lady Red immediately looked at the token as her eyes sparkled with excitement.

But, the message their Palace Master sent was very simple, only four words.

“Don’t upset Xuan Yi!”

Lady Red and the other people in Cloud Sea Asgard were shocked by this message.

“Xuan Yi killed seven of our people! Why did the Palace Master warn us not to upset him instead? Why is he so afraid of Xuan Yi?” Lady Red was a bit confounded.

After a while, she sighed and said, “Let’s go.”

The remaining people from Cloud Sea Asgard slowly left, along with their disciples.

Naturally, the experts of the other Sects left as well.

The trip to the Eternal Zone had come to an end. However, the incident with Xuan Yi killing seven Eternal Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard quickly spread throughout all of the Firmament Territory and continued to be a topic of discussion for quite a long time.

However, it wasn’t just because of Xuan Yi’s anger that Jian Wushuang’s death had become a heated topic among the experts in the Firmament Territory.

Quite a few people were sorry for Jian Wushuang because he was such a peerless genius.

However, as one of the main characters of this incident, Xuan Yi was sitting on the second floor of the Sword Tower, leisurely brewing his tea. On a table close to the wall, there was a floating shadow which appeared to be a Sword Spark.

It was the Sword Spark that had been taken from Jian Wushuang’s Sword Heart with a special method when Xuan Yi took him as his personal disciple.

This Sword Spark had not vanished, which meant that Jian Wushuang was still alive!
