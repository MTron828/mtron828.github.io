Chapter 5486 ¬†Dark King's Dao Image

Being in this realm, cultivation was indeed swift, but the assistance was limited; one still had to venture beyond.

Dongshen and Wanyan exchanged glances, both shaking their heads. Just when the trio was oblivious to their misunderstanding, a massive Dao Image descended from the apex of the treasure hall, resembling a convergence of celestial phenomena and a divine cauldron.

The three hastily retreated.

'Like sending me a pillow just when I'm feeling sleepy,' Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly.

Even if Lord Yun Zhong looked down on them, he wouldn't embezzle the original rewards.

After crossing the second bridge, there should be some substantial improvement at least!

Well, it was coming soon!

Another Dao Image appeared, but this time, it was the Dao Image of the Dark King, the Universe Master. This assistance was much more significant.

Comprehending a fragmented Universe Origin Source in the outside world was challenging, but here, they were given a true-to-life Dao Image, containing the complete Dark King Origin Source.

"You have only ten days, cherish them!" a majestic voice echoed, not Yun Zhong Jun this time but Divine General Moyin.

Ten days!

The three exchanged glances, and in an instant, they all found cushions and sat down cross-legged.

Their time was truly limited.

Ten days had to be seized.

Don't underestimate these ten days. With the complete Origin Source of a Universe Master before them, even a fool could make breakthroughs.

For Jian Wushuang, this Origin Source was crucial.

With this Origin Source, he could refine his own Origin Source Sea with the universe crystals he obtained.

His current Origin Source Sea was at the level of the Dao Lord, the Origin Source of the Dao.

To transform it into the Origin Source Sea of space, he needed to reach the Emperor level.

This time, he aimed to break through the ninth level of the Extreme Dao, even reaching perfection.

Let's see what it's like after achieving perfection in the Extreme Dao.

Hoo!

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes, and an avatar descended into the Origin Source Sea.

There were very few Origin Source fragments left in the current Origin Source Sea; most had been assimilated into it.

Splash!

Countless universe crystals appeared before him. Jian Wushuang stepped directly onto them, using the crystals as a small boat.

"Death King's Origin Source!" Jian Wushuang, amidst the sea of his own Origin Source, pierced through with a single glance, directly locking onto the Death King's Origin Source within the Dao Image.

It was the Origin Source of the Dao of Death, a unique Great Dao.

Death and Destruction were intertwined, and that Death King was once a peerless genius who almost stepped into the ranks of the Ultimate beings.

However, there was still a slight disparity between Death and Destruction. After becoming the Universe Master, his strength fell slightly short.

Jian Wushuang didn't know much about the Origin Source of Death. After all, it was a rare and special Origin Source.

However, grasping the mysteries of space and time within it was the key to advancement.

Delving into it, Jian Wushuang immediately felt the sea of his own Origin Source trembling.

No one dared to face death directly!

Even Jian Wushuang instinctively trembled. The terrifying aura approached, but having experienced too much, he had long learned to move against the wind.

Within the space, everything was encompassed‚Äîa breath of the revival of all things. However, compared to this spatial Origin Source, Jian Wushuang's space was more genuine.

It was the cosmic space, but when compared to Jian Wushuang, it was like the Emperors of the Original Universe compared to the Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms.

It still fell short.

Jian Wushuang's was more perfect, the convergence of countless heavenly spaces forming something tangible, like a real world. Once it descended, it would become a domain.

He had a premonition that if he could become the Universe Master, his One Thought Universe would likely truly become a universe.

At that time, he could hardly believe that, in the midst of battling others, he could directly call upon a universe into battle‚Äîsuch dominance was beyond imagination.

Absorbing the essence, discarding the dross.

Jian Wushuang began to comprehend the mysteries within the space of death.

In his Origin Source Sea, waves as mighty as towering mountains surged, caused by the fluctuations of the universal crystal.

While gaining insights, he took the opportunity to absorb the Universe Origin Source within the crystal.

His devouring force was extremely violent, ceaselessly engulfing the power of the Universe Origin Source from the crystal.

When the Dao reached its peak, he perfected his Thought power in the starry sky, reaching the third pinnacle. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Upon leaving, he condensed his One Thought Universe, broke through the fourth layer, and mastered the power of Devour.

Following that, he condensed the Power of All Things.

Among the three abilities bestowed by the Extreme Dao, Thought power was quite ordinary. It was possessed by everyone, and he was just a bit stronger than others.

The power of Devour, on the other hand, was somewhat special. Even Qishen had once mastered this ability.

Jian Wushuang didn't know much about this, but it was evident that the power of Devour was a more peculiar existence than Thought power.

Then there was the power of All Things. In reality, those who mastered this ability were usually powerful practitioners of the Myriad Dao or the Transformation Dao.

However, the order of mastery was different for him. He could grasp the power of All Things at the Dao Lord level, while practitioners of the Myriad Dao path and the Transformation Dao needed to reach the supreme-peak before condensing a trace of the power of All Things.

To master it, one probably had to wait for the transformation of space, becoming a cosmic space before being able to grasp the power of All Things.

Upon careful analysis, his three abilities were actually attainable by others. However, consolidating them together was a challenging feat.

Jian Wushuang's path to the Dao Merge required the preliminary mastery of Thought power, Devour, and All Things before reaching perfection, and then proceeding to integrate the Dao.

This proved to be the most challenging step.

Unity of the Myriad Dao resulted in the fusion of the power of All Things.

When these three elements overlapped, what kind of power would they form?

Jian Wushuang did not know, but he was approaching that step quickly.

The ninth level of the Extreme Dao was breached.

With the assistance of a substantial amount of universe crystals and a thorough comprehension of the complete Universe Origin Source, Jian Wushuang finally reached the ninth level of the Extreme Dao.

The Sea of Origin Source was pure, with no floating debris in the vast expanse of seawater, not even hidden reefs.

Now, Jian Wushuang's Extreme Dao Origin Source reached the purest state.

The only thing left was the final step of merging the three elements.

Unfortunately, the universe crystals were depleted, and even the universe godstones were entirely used up.

So many treasures were all invested in the Extreme Dao. Jian Wushuang couldn't help but feel a bit reluctant.

If he brought these treasures out, he could increase his divine body's power by 50,000-fold. Additionally, he could easily afford a set of Eternal Treasures.

The improvement in combat power after reaching the ninth level of the Extreme Dao was not as significant as obtaining some treasures for a quicker enhancement.

However, these were all external items, and Jian Wushuang could still distinguish them.

After breaking through the Extreme Dao, there was still some time. Jian Wushuang began to study the steps of merging the three elements.

First was Thought power, which evolved from the power of the mind. The power of Devour was borrowed from the realm of black holes.

In this way, he returned to the initial difficulty.

"The realm of black holes!" Jian Wushuang furrowed his brow.

His Heart power had long reached the fifth level, and his Thought power could be freely manipulated. He was only a hair's breadth away from achieving a perfect mental state.

To reach a perfect mental state, he needed to elevate his Heart power to the level of the sixth stage, which was the stage of the Unity of Heaven and Earth.

He was still a bit short of that, but breaking through the intricacies of Heart power cultivation required reaching the peak, a feat usually accomplished by formidable individuals who reached the supreme-peak level.
