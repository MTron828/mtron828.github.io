Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Boom!”

The terrifying explosion reverberated in the world as the two powers collided, causing the Void to rupture frantically.

Strong gales from the clash of the two energies exploded out. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Retreat!”

Even while grappling with shock, the Master of Samsara Temple and the others immediately retreated.

With a steely face, Jian Wushuang stood in the center of this powerful collision. His sword light remained as dazzling as ever.

“He managed to create a Supreme Secret?”

The eyes of the monarch of Jin Kingdom glinted as he stared fixedly on Jian Wushuang. He then sneered.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Both of them were pushed backward by the force at the same time.

“Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!”

Jian Wushuang treaded on the Void, each step imbued with million tons of force as he trampled on the Void.

He took a total of ten steps backward before stopping.

When he once again lifted his head, his battle intent was overpowering.

Meanwhile, the Monarch of Jin Kingdom had also taken ten steps backward before stopping.

To think that they would be evenly matched in a head-on collision!

“How is this possible?”

Red Snow King cried with an unprecedented sense of shock. His eyes were now entirely open as he stared fixedly at Jian Wushuang.

The Master of Samsara Temple and the rest were also stupefied.

Not even the Master of Samsara Temple was able to contend with the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness after exerting his full strength. Yet Jian Wushuang was evenly matched with the latter?

Was this a joke?

“1,800 years!”

“It has only been 1,800 years!”

Emperor of Tang clasped his hands tightly, a deep sense of surprise coloring his eyes.

The Master of Samsara Temple and the rest were overjoyed at the unexpected turn of events.

They were already deeply shocked when they found out that Jian Wushuang was no weaker than Red Snow King.

But they never once thought that the power of Jian Wushuang would be so much more frightening than what they imagination!

1,800 years ago, Jian Wushuang was merely equipped with the battle strength of a Universe Master!

He managed to improve his strength this much in a short span of 1,800 years?

“What a monster!”

The Palace Masters could not suppress their tempestuous hearts.

Their lifespans were all incomparably long. Never mind 1,800 years, it would be hard for them to see significant progress in their strength even after 18,000 years. Jian Wushuang’s progress was certainly extraordinary.

“That sword move earlier…” Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword’s eyes were wide open. The scene of Jian Wushuang unleashing his swordsmanship replayed in his mind over and over.

Previously, when another Palace Master said that he could no longer maintain his position as the top Sword Cultivator in the Green Fire World, he was unable to accept it.

Even though Jian Wushuang had previously shown strength superior to his, the former was an Inverse Cultivator with many treasures and plethora of tricks. In terms of kendo and swordsmanship, he believed that he was not any weaker than Jian Wushuang. In fact, he might even be stronger.

However, now that he had seen that sword move, he no longer harbored any thoughts of competing with Jian Wushuang.

That sword strike surpassed everything he knew about swordsmanship.

“He’s the true top Sword Cultivator of the Green Fire World!” Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword exclaimed in a solemn voice.

Over on the battlefield, the eyes of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom glinted as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“If I’m not mistaken, you ought to be a mere Dao Master?” he asked.

“So what if it’s true?” Jian Wushuang retorted in an icy-cold voice.

“How extraordinary that a mere Dao Master is able to create a swordsmanship of the Supreme Secret level and possess the battle strength of a Universe Master. Though I’ve seen countless talents in the Eternal Chaotic World, you’re much more noteworthy than any of them,” the Monarch of Jin Kingdom said with a smile.

“I’ll give you a chance in view of your talent.”

“Chance? What chance?” Jian Wushuang asked emotionlessly.

“I’ll give you a chance to swear your allegiance to me,” the Monarch of Jin Kingdom said, smiling. “My Original Body will soon be here. When that time comes, I’ll sweep this battlefield clean. Of course, that means I’ll be destroying all of you Green Fire Palace people as well. You too will die!”

“However, if you swear your allegiance to me, I’ll spare your life and even take you in as my personal disciple. The many opportunities and treasures left on this battlefield will belong to us both. What say you?”

“You’ll take me in as a personal disciple?” Jian Wushuang could not help sneering.

“Jian Wushuang, are you aware of what kind of illustrious existence His Highness is? He founded the great Jin Kingdom but has never taken any personal disciples! His willingness to do so is the result of the accumulation of your luck over your entire lifetime! Won’t you hurry up and agree?” Red Snow King cried.

“Heh. I’m afraid I’m unable to bear the love that the Monarch of Jin Kingdom has shown me,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“What?” The eyes of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom turned cold. Shaking his head, he said, “That’s a pity then. Since you’re not willing to accept me as your master and join my camp, that makes you my enemy. I have no choice but to exterminate a talent like you.”

“Exterminate me? Just based on the little shred of consciousness you have here?” Jian Wushuang mocked.

“How would I know if I don’t try?”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom laughed as he stared fixedly at Jian Wushuang with a pair of icy-cold eyes. Strange scarlet rays of light flitted inside his pupils.

“Buzz!” An incorporeal force attacked Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness.

A jolt went through his body but he swiftly recovered.

“Consciousness attack?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“You blocked it?” The Monarch of Jin Kingdom was rather flabbergasted. “I’ve truly underestimated you. Looks like I won’t be able to kill you with just this shred of consciousness but we can just wait for my Original Body to arrive to deal with you. Let me first put things in order here.”

“With me around, you won’t have this opportunity,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” The Monarch of Jin Kingdom narrowed his eyes.

“Swoosh! Swoosh!”

Their figures vanished at the same time.

When they reappeared, they were already locked in a fierce battle. The Void around them was instantly crushed as a result of their fight.

Wearing an icy-cold expression, Jian Wushuang held his trembling Blood Mountain Sword in one hand and immediately thrust it at the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

“Yin Spiritual Dragon!”

His Blood Mountain Sword immediately turned into an immense black dragon that violently tore at the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom appeared tranquil as he threw the pitch-black lance in his hand in a seemingly casual manner.

This time, the lance went straight through the immense black dragon and even destroyed the force concealed with the dragon.

“Spell of Disturbance.”

Following Jian Wushuang’s roar, gale began to rise around them and shadows of the sword burst forth from his hand.

In an instant, he created a storm of sword shadows that enveloped the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

The terrifying sword shadows abruptly exploded.
