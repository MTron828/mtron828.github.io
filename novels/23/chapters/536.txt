Chapter 537: Outburst!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Obviously, no one had expected Jin Ling’s action.

Even the sergeants in his squad, who had unconsciously obeyed his command to flee, realized what they were doing a moment later.

“Leader, how can we do this?”

“They rescued us. How can we run away and abandon them?”

“Leader!”

The sergeants stopped one by one. Some even turned back and ran towards Jian Wushuang and other sergeants, ready to fight against the Demonic Beasts with them.

“Run, run!” Jin Ling ignored them and still fled desperately.

“This bastard!” Qing Huo swore. The sergeants of the tenth and third squad were also surprised and angry.

“Brother Wushuang, what should we do now?” The leader of the third squad looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Try to survive,” Jian Wushuang answered calmly.

“Howl!” “Howl!” “Howl!”

Numerous Demonic Beasts, led by Mo Wu, who was covered with dark purple scales, roared and rushed toward Jian Wushuang and the other sergeants.

Most of the Demonic Beasts had just swarmed into the battlefield. In an instant, thousands of Demonic Beasts had managed to pass through the breach.

Most importantly, these Demonic Beasts were extremely strong, including dozens of Rank Eight Monsters and hundreds of Rank Seven Monsters.

This terrifying swarm of Demonic Beast rushed toward Jian Wushuang and the other sergeants.

“Go, go rescue them,” Fang Han called out in a shrill voice. He was the first one to rush toward Jian Wushuang.

The whole Seventh Army, as well as many sergeants of the Sixth Army, also ran towards Jian Wushuang.

Everyone wanted to rescue them, except Jin Ling, who was eager to run away.

“Jian Wushuang, die in peace,” Jin Ling whispered with a gloomy look. He turned back to look at the battlefield as he fled.

A swarm of Demonic Beasts had already flooded the area where Jian Wushuang and the others were.

Right then...

Buzz!

A terrible Sword Essence, which was strong enough to shake the entire area, suddenly burst forth.

In the center of the Demonic Beasts encirclement, a golden figure began to grow at an alarming rate.

A golden spectral image rose from behind Jian Wushuang and instantly grew to a full height of 60 meters.

Sword Soul Phantom!

The Strongest Sword Soul Phantom!

It was the first time that Jian Wushuang had used the Sword Soul Phantom since he arrived on the Monster Continent.

The 60-meter-tall Sword Soul Phantom which released a Supreme Sword Essence stood in the sky like a noble sword master.

“What’s that?”

The sergeants, as well as the Demonic Beasts, raised their heads and watched the Golden Sword Soul Phantom in confusion.

Jian Wushuang, who stood under the Sword Soul Phantom, released his Sword Soul Power.

“Get the hell out of my way!”

With a wave of his hand, Jian Wushuang swung the Triple-kill Sword while releasing a vast and mighty power.

The golden Sword Soul Phantom also swung the longsword at the same time.

A huge bright sword light suddenly appeared and swept the surrounding area. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Whoosh... The overwhelming sword light swept away the Demonic Beasts which were fiercely killing in the area around Jian Wushuang.

Although these Demonic Beasts used powerful moves and other means to resist, the sword power was too earth-shaking.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! The Sword Edge glided past the Demonic Beasts which were going to attack Jian Wushuang and the others, causing the Demonic Beasts to suddenly halt.

They stopped in mid-air, unexpectedly.

Space and time froze.

All of a sudden, dozens of Demonic Beasts fell down without any sign of a struggle.

The whole battlefield fell into a brief silence.

Everyone on the battlefield, including the Demonic Beasts, who looked at this scene were stunned.

Jian Wushuang killed dozens of Demonic Beasts with a single sword move.

Included in this count was a Rank Eight Monster and six Rank Seven Monsters.

“His battle strength...”

“What?”

“How’s this possible?”

The human sergeants in the surrounding area were flabbergasted by the sight of this.

The Demonic Beasts which had been attacking frantically were also astonished.

“So powerful?”

Mo Wu also looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Though he’s not a Divine Emperor, he’s definitely a heaven-defying Second-grade Divine General. In terms of battle strength, he isn’t weaker than an ordinary human Divine Emperor.”

“Damn it. How did such a strong expert appear among these humans?”

Jian Wushuang was currently the center of attention as he fought with a face full of Killing Intent and an extremely cold look in his eyes.

“Kill!”

He said coldly. As his killing intent soared, the supreme Sword Essence of the Golden Sword Soul Phantom also skyrocketed. At this moment, He stepped forward and the longsword swept through the surrounding area once again.

The six Demonic Beasts in front of him were his targets.

The six Rank Seven Monsters tried to resist. Nevertheless, when the sword arrived, their auras were instantly extinguished while their eyes were still wide open.

He instantly killed six Rank Seven Monsters with a single sword strike again.

The Demonic Beasts which had been violently attacking moments ago could not help trembling because of his terrifying strength and overwhelming killing intent. They quickly halted while being completely astonished by Jian Wushuang.

Mo Wu, the leader of the Demonic Beasts, glanced at Jian Wushuang in horror. He then snorted and said, “He’s the only strong one. Leave him alone. Go kill the other humans.”

“Howl!”

The Demonic Beasts roared in response, then immediately turned to attack the other sergeants.

“How can this be?”

Jin Ling had been watching from the rear as the situation unfolded. He thought that Jian Wushuang would definitely die, so he had never expected to see Jian Wushuang suddenly burst forth with an overwhelming power and force the Demonic Beasts to retreat.

“Bastard, how can you still be alive?”?Jin Ling’s eyes glazed over with resentment.

At this moment...

“Howl!”

A Demonic Beast appeared in the front of Jin Ling. It was a Rank Eight Monster which had entered the Formation much earlier, and it was preventing Jin Ling from escaping. What’s worse, several Demonic Beasts also ran toward him after avoiding Jian Wushuang.

Soon, several Demonic Beasts appeared behind Jin Ling and began to directly attack him.

“Oh no.”

Jin Ling’s expression darkened.

The converging attack of the strong Demonic Beasts forced him into a critical situation once again.
