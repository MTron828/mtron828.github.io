Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

The sound of the initial confrontation was loud enough to shake the entire area.

The whole battlefield was a surging storm of power.

All the spectators were shocked.

After all, there was a wide gap between Rank One Secret Skills and Rank Two Secret Skills. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Many geniuses were able to invent Superior Rank One Secret Skills. Each of the geniuses who made it through to the third round of the arena duels had created their own Superior Rank One Secret Skills, but the power of their skills was different and no one had displayed a Rank Two Secret Skill because it was much harder to create Rank Two Secret Skills.

A genius, who wanted to create a Rank Two Secret Skill, should have a high understanding of the Dao, especially the Weapon Dao.

For example, a genius might be able to invent a Rank Two Secret Skill, if he was adept at spear techniques and had done an in-depth study of the Spear Principle.

Few geniuses in this feast could meet these requirements.

However, Gong Chao was talented and regarded as the strongest genius in this year’s feast. Even the three magnates thought highly of him, so it was not a surprise that he was able to invent a Rank Two Secret Skill.

But, Jian Wushuang...

He came from the Ancient World.

A genius from the Ancient World was actually displaying a Rank Two Secret Skill to fight against Gong Chao?

Buzz... The endless energy storm filled the entire battlefield.

After a while, two figures retreated from the energy storm while trying to regain their balance.

Jian Wushuang gripped his sword with soaring battle intents in his eyes, while Gong Chao narrowed his eyes with a more solemn expression.

They were at their peak. Obviously, they fought to a draw in the initial confrontation.

“Good, do it again!” Gong Chao threw an icy stare at his opponent, then he charged forward with his Stone Cudgel.

“Come on!” Jian Wushuang growled.

His Sword Soul started shaking violently in his sea of consciousness, producing a mighty Sword Soul Power. As he moved, his body seemed to change into a sharp sword.

Swoosh!

A terrifying Sword Essence pervaded the entire battlefield.

“Humph!” Gong Chao snorted.

He launched continuous attacks with his Stone Cudgel. Each of the strikes radiated a mighty power that was strong enough to smash an ordinary Skyscraping Realm expert into pieces.

These two duelers continued to grapple with each other as the fight reached the white-hot stage.

The sounds from their confrontations struck terror into the spectators’ hearts.

“Too powerful, they are too strong!”

“What a terrifying strength! Both of them can easily kill me.”

“Gong Chao had a high understanding of the Thunderbolt Dao, far superior to us. Even Qianqiu Wuhen can’t hold a candle to him in the enlightenment of the Dao.”

“Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principle is amazing. He might be the best among us in the enlightenment of Sword Principle.”

Many geniuses could not help but shout their praises.

The experts in the Skyward Pavilion were astonished by Jian Wushuang’s performance.

“Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principle is great!”

“It’s unsurprising that Gong Chao had such a strength, but Jian Wushuang... we only knew that he was proficient in Sword Principle, so we didn’t expect him to be so powerful. None of the other geniuses are able to match him in Sword Principle. His Sword Soul Power is too strong. Even Gong Chao’s Staff Soul is weaker than his.”

“He surprised us once again.”

The knowledgeable experts marveled at Jian Wushuang’s strength.

Jian Wushuang was inferior to his opponent in the enlightenment of the Dao, but he narrowed the strength gap by using his Sword Principle.

”?Sword Principle,?” Xuan Yi thought as he stared at Jian Wushuang with a flicker of excitement in his eyes.

He also wondered.?“His Sword Principle Cultivation is amazing. It’s unbelievable that a Skyscraping Realm expert has such a powerful Sword Soul Power, but... is this his limit?”

All the experts in Skyward Pavilion felt how powerful his Sword Soul was and knew this Sword Soul Power was far superior to the other geniuses.

Nevertheless, Xuan Yi suspected that Jian Wushuang had not reached his limit...

On the battlefield, the fierce battle still continued.

”?I’ve already displayed my strongest move and used 70 percent of my Sword Soul Power, but I’m unable to gain the upper hand??” Jian Wushuang wore a solemn expression as his opponent continued to pressure him.

His strongest move was the Rank Two Secret Skill he had just performed, Sword Heart World. He had invented it after the one-month meditation in Enlightenment Mountain.

It was a mighty move.

Furthermore, he had the Strongest Sword Soul and 70 percent of his Sword Soul Power was far superior to the other geniuses. Even Gong Chao’s Staff Soul was weaker than his.

However, he was still neck and neck with his opponent.

Gong Chao’s Thunderbolt Dao was powerful indeed.

Boom!

Gong Chao brandished his Stone Cudgel, causing endless Thunderbolts to surge out as if a Thunderbolt dragon was charging toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stabbed forward with his Heart-killing Sword and unleashed an overwhelming Sword Soul Power which split the head of the dragon.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Gong Chao spoke. “You’re really strong. It seems that I have to use some of my trump cards if I want to defeat you.”
