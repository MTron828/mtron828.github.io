Chapter 1858: Funny Excuse

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Sir God Gu Xin.”

There was a cold voice. Among the experts of Abysmal Palace, Palace Master Wu Luo in green robe took a stride forward and his sharp gaze with boundless dignity fixed upon Hall Master Gu Xin.

“I came here today for one person only and he is Jian Wushuang. The feud between him and Abysmal Palace is deep-seated. Abysmal Palace has to kill him. As long as Lineage of Star hands him over, I will immediately leave.”

Hall Master Gu Xin’s face changed when he heard that. He replied, “I wonder when did Hall Master Wushuang offend Abysmal Palace?”

“When? Hehe, not too long ago, he killed Emperor God Fan Yuan and Emperor God Fan Yuan is a man under Abysmal Palace,” Palace Master Wu Luo replied coldly.

“What?” Hall Master Gu Xin stunned.

Jian Wushuang who was in the silver spaceship heard and he couldn’t help but laugh.

“Palace Master Wu Luo is so shameless. He uses such a funny excuse.”

Excuse, it was no doubt an excuse.

Emperor God Fan Yuan had been killed when Jian Wushuang had killed Emperor God Jin Ming who shared great resentment with Lineage of Star.

Jian Wushuang was sure that Emperor God Fan Yuan was a solo expert and he wasn’t related to Abysmal Palace at all. It was impossible that he was Abysmal Palace’s man.

After all, if Emperor God Fan Yuan was Abysmal Palace’s man, he definitely would have brought up Abysmal Palace when his life was threatened. But, he didn’t.

It was obvious that Emperor God Fan Yuan was merely an excuse that Abysmal Palace had found.

Emperor God Fan Yuan had already died anyway and the dead couldn’t bear witness. Abysmal Palace could say whatever they want.

“Palace Master Wu Luo, Emperor God Fan Yuan was really killed by Hall Master Wushuang. However, how could Emperor God Fan Yuan be Abysmal Palace’s man?” Hall Master Gu Xin questioned instantly.

“Humph, he is if I say he is. Stop this nonsense. Either Lineage of Star hands over Jian Wushuang or Abysmal Palace will barge in to destroy Lineage of Star. It’s your choice,” Palace Master Wu Luo’s cold voice reverberated in the sky.

However, just as he spoke…

“Haha, I originally thought Soaring Heaven King Palace was barbaric enough. But it seems now that Abysmal Palace is even better at it compared to Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

His laughter shook the sky and rang across the universe.

As the laughter rang across the universe, Jian Wushuang, who was on the silver spaceship, got out slowly with an icy look.

The moment he appeared, his eyes shot at everyone from Abysmal Palace like lightning.

At the same time, his voice with boundless chilliness was heard. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Abysmal Palace, right? Let’s just say Emperor God Fan Yuan was Abysmal Palace’s man. So what? I, Jian Wushuang, already killed him. What can you do about it?”

As his voice reverberated, not only the people from Abysmal Palace could hear it clearly, the spies who were hidden in the dark sent by all forces, including a few Almighties, could hear them clearly. In an instant, it stirred a commotion in the universe.

“You have guts!”

“An idiot that doesn’t know the immensity of the universe!”

“No wonder so many people want to kill him.”

The experts from Abysmal Palace were furious.

Palace Master Wu Luo stiffened and he stared at Jian Wushuang when he roared, “As you’re courting death, I will fulfill your wish!”

“Die!”

They didn’t bullshit anymore.

The moment Palace Wu Luo’s voice stopped, the eighteen Almighties from Abysmal Palace instantly pounded.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Eighteen fierce auras spread and pressed forward wantonly.

Especially the three leading figures, the three Emperor Gods were soaring with killing intention. They were all aiming at Jian Wushuang in the void in front of them.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two figures appeared behind Jian Wushuang at the same time. Looking at everyone from Abysmal Palace, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yin looked solemn.

“Both of you, be careful,” Jian Wushuang glanced at the two people behind him.

“Don’t worry, we will,” Hall Master Gu Xin nodded heavily.

Jian Wushuang didn’t speak anymore but waved and there were instantly four silver-armored Dao soldiers that appeared in front of them.

The four Dao soldiers looked cold and expressionless.

There was a chilly gleam in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Die!”

There was a low bellow and Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun and the four silver-armored Dao soldiers charged forward.

Jian Wushuang would naturally bear the brunt of the battle right at the front.

The two team formations were obviously out of proportion. Suddenly, they were going to fight head-on.

“Dan Tu, Luo Xian, the two of you team up with me and we shall kill Jian Wushang first. The rest of you, kill the two Sir Gods from Lineage of Star and destroy the four Dao soldiers. If you can’t destroy the four Dao soldiers, just keep them stranded for the time being. When we kill Jian Wushuang and the others, we will figure out a way to take control of them. They will be extremely useful to Abysmal Palace in the future,” Palace Master Wu Luo commanded.

“Yes,” the Almighties behind him nodded simultaneously.

The proud and aloof Emperor God Dan Tu and the green-robed maiden, Emperor God Luo Xian, followed behind Palace Master Wu Luo.

Suddenly, both parties were fighting together.

“Die!”

Palace Master Wu Luo’s aura increased tremendously and there was a flame soaring from his body as though he was covered in a layer of flame armor. His body grew to five meters tall and he was holding hundreds of millions of jin hammer with both his hands. The hammer was slammed in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

Dong!

The void wasn’t broken but there were shapeless waves that rippled as though it had hit the surface of the water.

However, the ripples contained terrifying power that could injure a Sir God badly. Then, there were more than hundreds of ripples that spread.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang hsrrumphed coldly and Blood Mountain Sword was drawn from its scabbard instantly.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, the fourth move!”

The sword was drawn and wielded. It was completed in an instant.

The stroke contained boundless reincarnation power. The reincarnation power was based on Jian Wushuang’s comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine and he had already reached the peak of the seventh level in Doctrine Palace.

Besides, most importantly, the stroke contained Jian Wushuang’s terrifying strength.

Divine power of a Third Stage Ultimate Real God and bloodline power of a seven-star ancient tribe expert, the combination of two brought about the strength that was double the power of an Emperor God.

The terrifying stroke whistled as it slashed. Instantly, most of the ripples that spread were broken while the sword light continued to sweep out. In the end, it shattered more than a hundred ripples.

“You’re quite powerful,” Palace Master Wu Luo was shocked.

Then, the two ghostly figures appeared next to Jian Wushuang at the same time.

Emperor God Dan Tu and Emperor God Luo Xian… The two Emperor Gods weren’t weak in ranking on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Emperor God Dan Tu was even extremely close to Peak Emperor God. Then, the two Emperor Gods let their fighting power explode as they went all-out.
