4924 Returning to the Battlefield

When the Young Emperor said this, there was only a cold smile left in his eyes. “And only the person who did such a thing knows in his heart.”

Prince Yu felt his ears burning. He gritted his teeth and said, “He’s still trying to argue. Imperial Father, don’t listen to his one-sided story!”

“If my words are one-sided, then so are yours. Of course, if you have evidence, why don’t you bring it up and testify on the spot?!”

The Young Emperor said coldly, not giving in.

Prince Yu gritted his teeth after hearing that. He could not produce any evidence.

Prince Mo died too quickly. The mysterious person who killed him did not leave any evidence at the scene.

Even if there was evidence left behind, it would no longer exist with the complete destruction of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture.

In this frozen atmosphere, Zhen Wuyang looked at Prince Yu and waved his hand, “Let’s not discuss this anymore. You can leave with your Yan Immortal. ”

Prince Yu was taken aback. He hurriedly said, “Imperial Father, why….”

Before he could finish his sentence, Zhen Wuyang suddenly released an unparalleled pressure that suppressed everything!

Under this pressure, even the Yan Immortal could not stand still and almost died.

“Alright, alright, Imperial Father, we’ll leave now!”

Prince Yu, who was kneeling in the air, could not even lift his head.

Zhen Wuyang did not look at him anymore. He waved his palm and dispelled the pressure.

Prince Yu heaved a sigh of relief, hiding his resentment in his heart. Then, he left the void battleground with less than 50 Yan Immortals.

At this point, the entire void battleground finally calmed down.

Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow was about to dissipate. Countless stars appeared behind him and then disappeared into the void.

This True Shadow that had been sealed in the ring by Zhen Wuyang from an unknown era was about to dissipate.

“Yan’er…”

The True Shadow of Zhen Wuyang was filled with guilt and reluctance. He reached out his hand to touch the Young Emperor’s cheek.

However, the Young Emperor subconsciously dodged his palm and lowered his head.

A hint of loneliness flashed in Zhen Wuyang’s eyes, but he immediately regained his calm. In the end, his Emperor Body slowly dissipated.

As he dissipated, he suddenly said, “Yan’er, I’ve let you down.”

The Young Emperor raised his head. His eyes were filled with confusion, but he could not find the answer in the end.

As Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow completely disappeared, the void battleground became deathly silent.

Jian Wushuang, who had recovered a little, let out a long sigh. If it weren’t for the appearance of Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow, he would have been turned into blood in the Blue Feather Bell.

The Young Emperor stood rooted to the ground, seemingly recalling what had just happened.

“Hmph, Prince Yan, do you think you can escape?”

At this moment, a furious roar came from the depths of the void. Then, the chaotic void was lit up. The group of Yan Immortals led by Prince Yu did not leave but returned.

At this moment, his eyes were filled with anger, as if he wanted to swallow the Young Emperor alive.

Jian Wushuang thought to himself, ‘This is bad!’

He did not expect Prince Yu to be so bold as to return. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At this moment, he had not even recovered half of his strength. It would be difficult for him to deal with these dozens of Yan Immortals and Prince Yu, who had many tricks up his sleeve.

If Prince Yu took out another ancient Immortal Weapon, he would be helpless.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang looked at the Young Emperor and said, “You’d better leave quickly. I think this place can’t hold on any longer.”

When the Young Emperor heard this, he smiled and said, “The reason why I came back was to save you. Now that you’re chasing me away, that’s too unreasonable.”

“Listen to me, you can’t stay here any longer. Even if Prince Yu catches me, he won’t dare to do anything to me.”

“You want to leave?” Prince Yu grinned hideously and pointed at Jian Wushuang. “None of you can leave here alive today. Except for Prince Yan, kill the rest!”

“Yes!” All of the Yan Immortals responded and released their energy at the same time, surrounding them from all directions.

“Looks like I can’t leave even if I want to.” Jian Wushuang sighed and an Invisible Sword appeared in his palm.

Seeing this sword, all the Yan Immortals were terrified.

They had all escaped from Jian Wushuang’s sword, so they naturally did not dare to underestimate him.

Under his sword, the Yan Immortals all trembled.

This was the first time that each of the Yan Immortals had faced such a terrifying Sword Principle. Before this, they had never seen an opponent who could use the Sword Principle so terrifyingly.

However, they had orders, so they could only brace themselves and accept the challenge.

With the combined power of fifty Yan Immortals, layers of majestic barriers surrounded Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor.

Jian Wushuang, who had yet to recover, was afraid that he would not be able to fight again.

He estimated that he could only release two Sword Intents at most before he would be exhausted.

When the barrier around him was thick enough, the aura around Jian Wushuang, who was originally calm, suddenly changed. He was like a True Sword that had been completely unsheathed.

Tens of thousands of Sword Intents surrounded him, filled with a murderous aura.

The next moment, he slashed down with the Invisible Sword in his hand.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Ocean Sword Intent, first move.

Star.

As the first sword move of the entire peerless Sword Dao, Star was the thickest sword move, filled with an awe-inspiring indomitable will.

However, this ordinary slash shattered the countless amount of Yan power.

Boundless Sword Intent surged and poured out crazily. Nearly a hundred pillars of light exploded.

Under this sword strike, even the void trembled. The barrier that contained the power of 50 Yan Immortal experts was directly cut open and then collapsed uncontrollably!

Seeing this, Prince Yu turned pale with fright. “Hurry up and block him! If anyone dares to let him go today, I’ll skin you alive!”

All the Yan Immortals were terrified, but they still braced themselves and went forward. At this moment, each of them completely released their Yan power, trying to trap Jian Wushuang and the others.

They had done it. Jian Wushuang had used up all his energy in this attack. He was unable to escape from the attack.

The endless Sword Intent dissipated. Looking at Jian Wushuang, the Young Emperor, and the thin purple robe who were surrounded by the power, Prince Yu could not help but smile.

The destruction of the Six Heavens and Prince Yan’s capture was the ultimate goal of this battle!

However, before the smile on Prince Yu’s face disappeared, he saw several figures rushing over from the front. They were so fast that they arrived in the blink of an eye.

“Not good, there’s a change!” His eyelids twitched, only then did he see that all of them were Yan Immortals!

A total of seven figures with strong Yan power around their bodies slowly walked toward Prince Yu, like the sharpest Sword Intents.

He subconsciously retreated and gritted his teeth.
