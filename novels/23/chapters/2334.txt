Chapter 2335: Jian Wushuang Attacked

“If you continue to stop me, I will kill you!”

Jian Wushuang said coldly and his voice reverberated in the Purple Virtue Hall.

The talented disciples and family members of the experts from the Lin Mansion looked over at Jian Wushuang, confused.

Lin Tao was breaking out in a cold sweat. From his forehead, a few strands of hair fell towards the ground.

These few strands of hair would not drop to the ground for no reason at all. Jian Wushuang had cut them off in that instant.

If Jian Wushuang had wanted to, he could have chopped off Lin Tao’s head.

“Did I almost die? How can this be? This kid?” Lin Tao was trembling as he stared dead at Jian Wushuang.He was in disbelief.

“Junior Brother!” The man in black clothes looked at Lin Tao and turned pale. He instinctively reached out towards the sword that was behind his back.

Suddenly, a cold pair of eyes looked at him. Rays of killing intent were seen in the pair of eyes.

The man in black clothes was frozen in fear. His hand stopped in mid-air.

He looked at Jian Wushuang in fear.

Even though Jian Wushuang simply looked at him, he felt that he was lost within endless sword essence. The sword essence was extremely terrifying. If he continued to reach for his sword hilt, he would have died before he had even drawn his sword.

“This, how is this possible?”

The man in black clothes was shocked beyond words.

Both of them had met Jian Wushuang before. Jian Wushuang had been a very modest and mild child.

Even when Lin Yan had said that Jian Wushuang could be the most talented person in the Sword Doctrine throughout the Wusha Barren Region, they had never taken his words seriously and had underestimated Jian Wushuang.

The door of the hall opened.

After the door opened, the aura that Jian Wushuang had completely changed.

Based on divine power alone, Jian Wushuang had the aura of an Early Stage Chaotic Realm.

This level of cultivation base was nothing. However, a person in this realm changed the perspective of everyone within the Purple Virtue Hall.

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang in fear. It was as though they were looking at an unmatchable killing machine, an overpowering emperor!

Jian Wushuang did not say anything else. He looked into the air as he dashed forward towards the battlefield.

The experts in the Purple Virtue Hall went into an uproar after Jian Wushuang disappeared from everyone’s sight.

These people were amazed, in disbelief and even in fear.

“Senior Brother, did you feel that?” Lin Tao trembled lightly as he looked at the man in black clothes beside him.

“I felt it. At that instant, I felt I would die from his gaze. You?” The man in black clothes nodded his head solemnly.

Both of them were raging with emotion and could not calm themselves down at all.

In the crowd, Luo Xinqin looked at Jian Wushuang’s back view. She seemed to have thought of something.

“Wushuang...”

...

Lin Mansion. The battlefield was shifted from the front door of the Lin Mansion to the sky above the mansion.

It was a one sided battle.

After the Xiang Family joined, the Lin Family could put up no resistance.

“Is it fate that the Lin Family will go down today in history?” Lin Tiefeng was desperate.

“Brother Lin, do not give up. There is still a chance.” Zhuo Yunfeng, who was not too far away, shouted at Lin Tiefeng.

“Chance?” Lin Tiefeng laughed bitterly. He looked over at Zhuo Yunfeng gratefully and said, “Brother Zhuo, the Lin Family has requested the help of many experts. You are the only one amongst them who is helping me wholeheartedly. The rest of them are here for their own vested interests. I am afraid I can only repay you in the next lifetime.”

“Do not say something so stupid,” Lin Tiefeng roared in a low voice.

Suddenly... Hum~

A white sword light appeared beside Zhuo Yunfeng and it swept towards his waist.

Zhuo Yunfeng was shocked. He tried to back off, but the sword light chased him down.

The person who had created that sword light was a white-haired elder in white clothes.

“Zhuge Yun!” Zhuo Yunfeng turned pale.

He was a Chaotic Divine Demon from the Zhuge Family. He was also known as the most powerful expert in the sword doctrine within the Anjiu Prefecture.

There was no way Zhuo Yunfeng could stop such a powerful expert.

“Watch out, Brother Zhuo,” Lin Tiefeng roared in a deep voice. He was preoccupied with Elder Chen and could not help Zhuo Yunfeng at all.

Zhuo Yunfeng had a gloomy look. He gave it his all in an attempt to block the sword light. Just then...

“This sword skill is so fast and unique.”

Zhuo Yunfeng widened his eyes. He could only block three sword lights out of the many even though he already tried his best. When the fourth sword light was descending upon him, he felt his life was in danger.

The sword light targeted his head. It would have penetrated his head in the next moment.

Just then...

Hum!

A formless energy swept forth. The sword light halted in mid air.

This halt gave Zhuo Yunfeng a chance to back off. The sword light missed his head.

“Soul Attack?”

This soul attack was extremely powerful. It was at the level of a Half-Step Chaotic Divine Demon.

“Within the Lin Mansion, there wasn’t anyone who could cast a soul attack at the power level of a Half-Step Chaotic Divine Demon. Who cast it?” Zhuge Yun stood there and surveyed the surroundings.

What attracted his attention the most was a figure that had appeared out of nowhere.

The figure was Jian Wushuang.

He appeared beside Zhuo Yunfeng.

“Father,” Jian Wushuang greeted him.

“Wushuang?” When Zhuo Yunfeng saw Jian Wushuang, he was enraged. “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be with your mother within the Purple Virtue Hall? Go back immediately.”

“If I leave now, I will never see you again,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Zhuo Yunfeng was stunned. He knitted his eyebrows.

“No matter what, you do not have the ability to interfere with this battle. Take your mother and leave the Lin Mansion. Leave Anjiu Prefecture!” Zhuo Yunfeng said authoritatively.

“I know my own abilities best. There is no need for me and mother to leave the Lin Mansion and Anjiu Prefecture.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly as he looked at Zhuge Yun.
