Chapter 5096 ¬†People From the Heavenly Court

Jian Wushuang, although anxious, quickly regained his composure.

He fixed his gaze on the dark-robed elder's shattered chest, where an indelible dark purple radiance was slowly flowing.

With a thought, Jian Wushuang swiftly retrieved two Emperor-grade pills. He placed one in the mouth of the dark-robed elder and crushed the other, scattering it over the wound.

Upon ingestion, the dark-robed elder's eyes widened abruptly. The effects of the Emperor-grade pill were so potent that words couldn't describe them. Even a Peak Grand Yan Immortal would be completely restored by it.

As the pill entered his mouth and the formidable medicinal effects coursed through him, the dark-robed elder quickly closed his eyes and began to adjust his breathing.

Jian Wushuang did not waste any time either. He reached out and drew away the mist and dust covering the wound.

Nan Xuan and Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo and the others also hurried over, collectively releasing their energy to protect the dark-robed elder.

Time passed slowly, and his injuries gradually stabilized.

Finally, the dark-robed elder slowly opened his eyes, his gaze shining as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

Then, in a voice that only the two of them could hear, he exclaimed excitedly, "Impressive, kid! Where did you get these pills, and why do they taste just like the ones I secretly ate all those years ago?"

"???" Jian Wushuang was left baffled. He hadn't expected the first thing the old man would say upon waking up to be about this. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

Following that, the dark-robed elder displayed a proud expression. "Kid, it seems you've managed to find that old guy's stash."

"..."

His mouth twitched. "Senior, it looks like you're not hurting anymore."

Then, the dark-robed elder finally assumed a serious tone. "Well, I'm not feeling any pain anymore, but that guy has pushed me one step closer to a dead end."

Jian Wushuang knew that every word he uttered was true, and he was inexorably heading towards his demise. His fate energy was exceptionally powerful, but it was also fractured, unable to coalesce, and could only be released.

Furthermore, this battle pushed the black-robed elder towards a dead end.

"Well, since the matter here is concluded, this old man will continue waiting for death."

The black-robed elder uttered his usual mantra, completely dismissing thoughts of life and death.

However, just as his words fell, his expression suddenly changed, and his gaze turned towards the distant void.

"Not good, those guys have also come!"

Jian Wushuang instantly became alert, but before he could speak, the black-robed elder urgently shouted, "Kid, what about the crystal I gave you earlier? Hurry up, escape, and let me hide inside."

...

Jian Wushuang followed the instructions and took out the ink-blue crystal from the Boyang Bottle. The black-robed elder directly plunged into it, disappearing.

With vigilance mixed with curiosity, Jian Wushuang wondered who the newcomers were that made the black-robed elder so cautious.

In the next moment, from the depths of the endless void, a vast and supreme aura of destiny emerged, covering the heavens.

These destinies were not just one, but dozens of them.

"Is there no end to this?!" Nan Xuan was almost exhausted.

Jian Wushuang squinted, sensing the majestic destinies approaching, devoid of terrifying intentions.

He pondered silently, "Could it be envoys from the Heavenly Court?"

As if to confirm his guess, ten figures with glowing halos, carrying supreme destinies, appeared in mid-air.

"Indeed, they are envoys from the Heavenly Court."

Jian Wushuang frowned, quickly realizing that the apocalyptic aura emitted by the Great Mi Heavenly had alarmed the Heavenly Court, prompting them to send their elders to investigate.

In an instant, ten majestic figures arrived, exuding an imposing presence.

Accompanying their arrival, the indescribable order of the heavenly path was rebuilt, and the once-chaotic void began to stabilize into eternal silence.

"Be careful, these newcomers are Elders from the Heavenly Court," the Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo whispered, his gaze heavy.

"So, these are the Elders of the Heavenly Court," Nan Xuan murmured thoughtfully.

Prince Jiu, on the other hand, breathed a sigh of relief. As the son of the Emperor, there was no one closer to the Heavenly Court's Elders than him.

Leading the ten divine figures was one with an angry expression, a pure face without a beard, and a chilling aura.

He took a step forward, his gaze slowly sweeping over Jian Wushuang and the others. After pausing briefly on Jian Wushuang and Prince Jiu, he withdrew his gaze.

"Who is responsible for this place?" the man with angry eyes asked in a cold tone, and an unimaginable pressure followed suit.

A Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal!

Jian Wushuang quickly realized that these Elders who had survived since the Ancient Era were at least at the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal realm, and it was even highly likely that some of them were at the pinnacle of the Grand Yan Immortal realm.

In the face of these formidable beings, resistance seemed utterly futile.

At this moment, everyone fell silent.

The reasons behind this massive destruction were too complex, and the instigator, the figure in the black robe, had completely disappeared, making it impossible to ascertain the truth.

Furthermore, the Heavenly Court was not a benevolent entity, and causing such destruction in the Great Mi Heaven would likely result in the Heavenly Court's interference.

This was Jian Wushuang's concern, which is why he had no intention of speaking up.

Nan Xuan, on the other hand, shook his head and looked around as if he were completely unaware of the situation.

The Divine Craftsman, Xu Tuo, clenched his teeth and remained silent. He understood that causing such terrible damage to the Heavenly Region would result in exile to desolate lands for eternity if the Heavenly Court discovered his involvement.

At this moment, Prince Jiu, who had remained silent until now, took a step forward and began, "Immortal Lord Zhen Yao, I..."

He did not finish his sentence as the enraged Immortal Lord Zhen Yao interrupted him with a cold, dismissive tone, "Your Highness, did I give you permission to speak?"

Prince Jiu fell silent, his face alternating between shades of red and blue. His anger flashed briefly in his eyes and then returned to its original state.

The gaze of Immortal Lord Zhen Yao continued to sweep the area, eventually stopping on Jian Wushuang, who maintained a calm demeanor.

"Jian Wushuang, you, explain what's going on here."

Jian Wushuang's figure stiffened slightly, feeling somewhat helpless.

He wasn't entirely sure why this Immortal Lord Zhen Yao knew his name, but he could vaguely speculate on some connections.

After a moment of contemplation, he began, "Originally, my companions and I came here for training and to pay a visit to the esteemed Divine Craftsman. However, an unexpected and significant change occurred."

"Suddenly, a malevolent creature arrived here and began wreaking havoc. It quickly laid waste to this place. In order to prevent the Great Mi Heaven from being destroyed, Divine Craftsman and I joined forces to resist this creature."

"However, that creature was too ferocious, and we were no match for it. Just as we were about to be defeated and on the brink of destruction, that creature suddenly fled from this place. Shortly thereafter, all of you arrived."

"Now, in hindsight, I believe that creature fled abruptly due to its fear of the immense fate energy of all the Immortal Lords present, causing it to hastily escape."

As he finished speaking, Jian Wushuang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

In his explanation, he managed to convey the situation accurately while also subtly flattering the Heavenly Court's Elders, earning a nod of approval from Nan Xuan in the process.
