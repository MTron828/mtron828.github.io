Chapter 3292: Surging Undercurrent (Part One)

______

Everything in the Blood Wave Realm had calmed down.

The fight for the Blood Wave Token had long ended, and all the opportunities in the Blood Wave Palace had been obtained. The trip to the Blood Wave Realm had come to an end, many experts present were quietly waiting for the spatial passage to appear.

Jian Wushuang, Emperor Ming, Di Hao, and the others were also waiting quietly.

But at this moment…

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.” A message suddenly came.

Jian Wushuang immediately took out a message token. “Temple Master Bai Xing?”

The person who sent the message was Temple Master Bai Xing.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I heard that you defeated Silver Wolf, who had broken through to become a Principles Master, in the Blood Wave Realm?” Temple Master Bai Xing asked first.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Since ancient times, you are the first person to defeat a Principles Master in the Immortal Saint Realm. You are indeed impressive,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“You flatter me, Temple Master,” Jian Wushuang said humbly.

“Don’t be too happy. I’m not sending you a message to compliment you. I’m telling you that the three Saint Realms will continue to make moves against you,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“The intelligence department of the Temporal Temple has already detected the high-level experts of the three Saint Realms and secretly dispatched many of them. Although we haven’t figured out where they are heading, everyone’s attention is focused on the Blood Wave Realm at this time. In addition to what the three Saint Realms did to you in the Blood Wave Realm, even a fool can guess that they are targeting you,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Indeed, in the Blood Wave Realm, the three Saint Realms had risked everything to kill him, but they did not succeed. Now that he had obtained the opportunity in the Blood Wave Palace, his strength had soared. This was definitely a greater threat to the three Saint Realms, the three Saint Realms would definitely not let him continue to grow.

“No matter what, I am a member of the Temporal Temple. It’s fine if the three Saint Realms attack me in the Blood Wave Realm, but if they attack me in the outside world in front of the Temporal Temple, it would be a total loss of face with the Temporal Temple. It seems that the three Saint Realms would rather fight the Temporal Temple than kill me,” Jian Wushuang thought.

“There are quite a number of experts from the three great Saint Realms. My Temporal Temple has only detected a small part of them, but even so, it is already very shocking. That is why I am sending you a message now. When you leave the Blood Wave Realm, you must be careful. After all, there is only one exit to the Blood Wave Realm, and that is the Saha Island. The three great Saint Realms will most likely set up an inescapable net there. Once you leave the Blood Wave Realm, they will use lightning-fast methods to kill you!”

“Yes!” Temple Master Bai Xing’s voice was cold.

“Of course, you are a member of the Temporal Temple, so we will do our best to protect you. When we sense the three Saint Realms are making a move, I will gather people as quickly as possible. I will lead them myself. When you come out of the Blood Wave Realm, the experts of the Temporal Temple will come to meet you.”

“Thank you, Temple Master.” Jian Wushuang thanked him immediately.

“Don’t thank me yet. I feel that the three Saint Realms will definitely do something big this time. I can’t guarantee that I can protect you, so I can only do my best. You also have to be well prepared. Fortunately, you have a good life-saving ability. When the two sides really fall out, you have to remember that you have to try your best to survive. Don’t worry about anything else.” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

After the communication ended, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and let out a long sigh.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, what’s wrong?” Emperor Ming, Di Hao, and the others looked at each other.

“Temple Master Bai Xing just sent me a message saying that the three Saint Realms will make a move against me on Saha Island. He wants me to be ready,” Jian Wushuang said seriously. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Three Saint Realms?” The expression of the Underworld Emperor changed.

“The three Saint Realms are really persistent!” Qian Hongzi cursed in a low voice.

Since they entered the Temporal Temple, they had been in conflict with the three Saint Realms. Later, the three Saint Realms joined hands to kill Jian Wushuang once, but they did not succeed. But now…the three Saint Realms wanted to attack Jian Wushuang not only in the Blood Wave Realm but also outside the Blood Wave Realm…

“The three Saint Realms and I have been fighting to the death for a long time. I expected the three Saint Realms to treat me like this.” Jian Wushuang was not surprised. He pondered for a moment, then he took out another token.

This token was given to him by Blood Wave.

“Master Blood Wave.” Jian Wushuang sent a message directly.

“Jian Wushuang, why are you looking for me?” Blood Wave replied quickly.

Hearing Blood Wave’s reply, Jian Wushuang could not help but feel happy.

Blood Wave had given him this token to contact his original body when he went to the universe battlefield. Therefore, Jian Wushuang was not sure whether this token could be used to contact Blood Wave’s consciousness in the Blood Wave Temple.

But now it seemed that this token could be used to contact Blood Wave’s token.

“Master Blood Wave, I want to ask, how long will it take before the exit of the Blood Wave Realm appears?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“An hour,” Blood Wave replied.

“So fast?” Jian Wushuang frowned and then asked, “Master Blood Wave, is there a second exit of the Blood Wave Realm?”

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, with his current strength, he did not need to worry about anything in the Blood Wave Realm. However, if he was outside the Blood Wave Realm, it would not be appropriate for him to confront the three Saint Realms directly, therefore, if there was a second exit in the Blood Wave Realm, he could leave quietly through the second exit, and all the preparations made by the three Saint Realms on the Saha Island would be in vain.

However, Blood Wave replied, “My Blood Wave Realm has long been fixed. There can only be one exit, and the location of the exit has been fixed for a long time. If my original body was here, I could easily change the location of the exit or create more exits. However, I’m only a consciousness now, and I can’t change anything.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang felt a little regretful.

“Jian Wushuang, you seem to be in some trouble?” Blood Wave asked.

“Yes, I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “As expected, my enemies in the outside world have set up an inescapable net at the exit of the Blood Wave Realm. Once I appear from the blood wave world, I will be immediately attacked by them.”

“I see.” Blood Wave understood and paused, then he continued, “The exit of the Blood Wave Realm can not be changed, but there is still a certain connection between the exit of the Blood Wave Realm. After you go out, if you are really attacked by them, I can still give you some help.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows..
