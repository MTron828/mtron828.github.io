Chapter 1811: Immemorial Celestial Body

In front of the gray stone tablet, Jian Wushuang stood calmly.

He didn’t hurry to learn the Immemorial Celestial Body. He had one thousand years. No need to hurry.

“Dao Yuanzi,” Sword Wu asked, “Have you heard of the Immemorial Celestial Body?”

“Immemorial Celestial Body?” Daoyuanzi was shocked. “Has the strong man left this here?”

“No. Just answer my question. Do you know or not?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course I know.” Dao Yuanzi nodded, “Immemorial Celestial Body is the strongest cultivation secret skills of the Ancient Clan, as definitely among the top ten in the whole universe. Unfortunately, only the pure ancient clan blood descendants can cultivate it. Other people cannot benefit from it even if they get it.”

“It seems that it’s a good secret skill,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Ancient World was so powerful with numerous excellent secret skills, far better than the current era’s.

And this Immemorial Celestial Body was ranked among the top ten skills, so it was obvious how powerful it was.

“The Immemorial Celestial Body, as well as the lineage inheritance of Wu Hun, will be beneficial to me,” Jian Wushuang thought, and started to learn.

There were many mysterious lines in the gray stone monument, and the Immemorial Celestial Body was within those lines.

As Jian Wushuang was learning, Wu Hun was thinking.

“The Immemorial Celestial Body is the supreme secret skill of the Ancient Clan. Back then, many talents could learn it and acquire it, but nowadays the situation is different. Few people are qualified.”

In ancient times, strong talents were as countless as stars.

The reason was that the cultivation environment of ancient times was much more superior.

Environment decides the quality of talents. Because of the great environment, there were many talents far more powerful than the current days.

Some of the most top-notch talents in the Eternal Chaotic World were just ordinary in the Ancient time.

Therefore, although Wu Hun had already lowered his requirements to the lowest level for Jian Wushuang, he was still unsure whether Jian Wushuang could realize the first volume of the Immemorial Celestial Body.

Wu Hun hoped that Jian Wushuang could succeed. “Well, I have waited for a long time for this little guy to come to me, and he happens to have the blood lineage of the Ancient Clan. I don’t want to lose the opportunity”

He didn’t want his own blood lineage to dissipate forever. He needed a descendant.

“I will see you later.” Wu Hun closed his eyes again.

The entire Crimson Lightning Region was completely quiet.

Jian Wushuang fully concentrated on the learning and soon 150 years passed.

In front of the gray stone tablet, Jian Wushuang, who had been sitting quietly, suddenly opened his eyes, and his face was revealing a smile of joy.

Later, he took out a token and and began to record something in the token. After a while, he stood up and went to Wu Hun

“Senior Wu Hun.” Jian Wushuang was respectful.

Wu Hun opened his eyes, “Hey, little guy, what doubts have you encountered on the way?”

“None. Everything goes well and I have solved my doubts along the way. Even if I have doubts, I have solved it myself. Now I have finished the first volume of the Immemorial Celestial Body. I have fully realized it.” Jian Wushuang said.

“How can that be possible?” Wu Hun was astonished. “You only spent one hundred and fifty years?”

“This is the record I made. Please have a look.” Jian Wushuang handed the token he had recorded to Wu Hun.

After picking up the token and reading, Wu Hun was shocked. “No mistakes.”

“You really realize the secret skills!”

He had never imagined that Jian Wushuang could not only meet his requirements, but would finish the task within only one hundred and fifty years!

“With that speed, he can fully comprehend the first three volumes, and even comprehend the first four volumes of the Immemorial Celestial Body!”

“Genius, great genius!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Even in my time, he could definitely be the top genius. Few people could do that. I collapsed for five years and lost hope to inherit my blood lineage. But at the last minute, I have been fortunate enough to meet such a top genius!”

“Haha, God favors me!”

Wu Hun was very excited.

But he remained calm before Jian Wushuang. “Since you have met my requirements, from now on, you are my descendant. I know you may have other masters or have inherited other lineages, but that doesn’t matter. You only need to know that the blood of the Ancient Clan is derived from me, which is enough.”

“This is my blood heritage, take it.”

Wu Hun gave the light beads that were completely condensed by the blood essence to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang received the bead and his Ancient God lineage started to vibrate violently.

“Just do the inheritance here so that I can also give you some advice,” Wu Hun said.
