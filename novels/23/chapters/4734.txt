4735 One After Another nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Within ten breaths, he wiped out 12 Yan Immortals by himself. What kind of existence could do it so easily?

Even Jian Wushuang could only take a roundabout route when he was surrounded by dozens of Yan Immortals. It was almost impossible for him to do it so easily.

But that impossible scene actually happened.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor had only arrived a moment after Prince Mo had appeared, led by the monster ape.

They had wanted to take advantage of the fact that both sides had suffered heavy losses to take the Immortal Peach, but they had not expected to see such a shocking scene.

From this, he had a preliminary judgment of the non-existent Prince Mo.

“Isn’t this guy a little too strong?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Young Emperor with a grave expression.

An indecipherable look flashed across the Young Emperor’s eyes. “It seems that they’ve also been breaking through their cultivation realms.”

Just as he was about to speak, a powerful force surged from the broken mountain peak.

Then, the Prince brought over 20 Yan Immortals to this place.

Sensing the fluctuation of Yan power in the air around him that had yet to stabilize, the space between Prince Jiu’s brows furrowed deeply.

It was clear that a battle had taken place here not long ago, but he was still a step too late.

“The Immortal Peach is in Jiao Province. He shouldn’t have gone far. Go and find it,” Prince Jiu said in a deep voice.

The group of Yan Immortals behind him accepted the order and scattered across the entire Jiao Province.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor rode on the monster ape’s head and hid under the cliff. They planned to continue moving after Prince Jiu had left.

In the next moment, the monster ape, which had been holding its breath, suddenly snorted.

The tremendous force caught the two people riding on top off guard, directly sending them flying. Then, they landed right behind Prince Jiu.

Prince Jiu, who was lost in his thoughts, was suddenly startled. He turned around and saw the two people who had appeared out of nowhere. He was at a loss and on guard.

“It’s you, Prince Yan?!”

The two of them were equally confused. They did not expect to meet in such a way.

The Young Emperor calmed down quickly and looked at Prince Jiu with a calm expression. “So what if it’s me?”

As if he had thought of something, Prince Jiu began to examine the two of them. “Is the Immortal Peach in your hands?”

“So what if they it is? Do you have the qualifications to take it away?” The Young Emperor’s eyes were filled with disdain.

Prince Jiu sneered. “I still have my reservations in the Heavenly Court. But here in the Heavenly Realm, let’s settle our old and new scores together!”

“Do you think you can?” The Young Emperor’s eyes were filled with faint contempt and disdain from the beginning to the end.

As if he felt humiliated, Prince Jiu growled in a low voice. A strong force surged and stirred the forest.

At the same time, the white-robed Yan Immortal on his back naturally matched Jian Wushuang.

The four figures were about to engage in a great battle!

The monster ape was lying on the cliff, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

In the blink of an eye, Prince Jiu’s aura had risen to its peak. His cold gaze seemed as if he was going to swallow the Young Emperor whole.

Just as they were about to attack, a voice suddenly sounded.

“Eh, Big Brother, Second Brother, you guys are here too.”

The Young Emperor and Prince Jiu looked at the voice at the same time.

He saw a thin, young, and handsome young man in a white robe flying over. He had no sense of retreat at all.

“What are you doing here?” Prince Jiu was on guard as he secretly increased Yan power’s power.

The handsome young man scratched his head and said, “Of course I’m here to find the Immortal Peach. Just now, my partner said that there was a strange phenomenon in Jiao Province, so I ran over to try my luck.”

The Prince said, “Aren’t you afraid that you will be eliminated right now?”

“Uh, then I’ll take my leave first, you guys continue.” The handsome young man grinned and quickly urged his companion to leave.

With the sudden participation of this handsome young man, this inevitable battle came to a tacit end.

They all had their concerns. Now that an Immortal Peach had appeared in Jiao Province, the center of the Heavenly Realm, the other princes and Yan Immortals were also coming. If they fought until both sides were injured, they would be in a very passive position in the following fight.

With a wave of his sleeve, Prince Jiu gave the Young Emperor a cold look, then turned and left.

The entire Jiao Province seemed to have quietened down.

“There’s no time to lose. We have to hurry and find Prince Mo,” the Young Emperor turned around and said to Jian Wushuang.

He nodded and looked around. When he realized that there were no hidden traps, he waved his hand and picked up the monster ape that was still lying on the edge of the cliff.

“If you expose us again, be careful that we don’t roast you on the fire!” Jian Wushuang said in a bad mood after slapping the big guy’s head.

When the monster ape heard that, it quickly shook its huge head and looked at him as if it was trying to please him.

The two of them had originally planned to release the monster ape on their way to Jiao Province, but they had discovered that it was extremely sensitive to the aura of the Immortal Peach and great danger, so they naturally continued to bring this burden.

They sat on the monster ape’s back again and followed the path that Prince Mo had disappeared in.

“Big Brother, long time no see.”

As he was traveling through the forest, a voice suddenly rang in his ears.

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat and he subconsciously looked to his side.

The handsome young man who had left earlier appeared out of nowhere and grinned at the Young Emperor.

A slender soft sword was suddenly pulled out and pointed forward. It was an inch away from piercing his neck.

The handsome young man hurriedly retreated to create a safe distance.

“Get as far away as you can. If you dare to take one more step forward, you’ll die,” the Young Emperor glanced at him coldly and said casually.

He smiled awkwardly. “Actually, Big Brother, I don’t have any ill intentions toward you. I just want to tell you that it’s best if you don’t fight with Second Brother and the others for the Immortal Peaches. Their strength and realm are only a step away from the Elders. I’m afraid you…”

The Young Emperor’s eyes were as sharp as knives as he looked at him. “Sy one more word and I’ll cut your tongue off.”

The handsome young man had no choice but to leave with his companion.

Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly turned back and said, “Don’t worry, Big Brother. No matter what, I’ll definitely help you with all my might when we get the Peach.”

After saying this, the handsome young man disappeared without a trace.

The Young Emperor looked ahead calmly as if he had not heard anything.

“This little brother is not bad. Is he your brother too?” Jian Wushuang turned his head and asked.

“The seventh son, Prince Lin.” The Young Emperor did not seem to want to mention the identities of the Princes. After revealing their identities, he fell silent.

Jian Wushuang was not too interested in it. After a simple nod, he sat in meditation on the monster ape’s back.

More than a month had passed since the battle for the Peach, and everyone knew who the Immortal Peach belonged to. The only important thing now was how to deal with these terrifying Princes and obtain the Immortal Peach.
