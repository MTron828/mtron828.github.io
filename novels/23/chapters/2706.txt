Chapter 2707: Battling A Grand Ultimate God

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Rumble!

The vast golden divine power condensed behind Jian Wushuang as a huge and infinite Golden God Shadow with a height of 8,000 feet appeared in the blink of an eye.

An 8,000-feet-tall Divine God of Punishment!

“It’s a pity that Fo Yi came a little earlier. If he had given me more time, the Divine God of Punishment would be more than eight thousand feet tall—at least nine thousand feet or even exceed ten thousand feet and achieve the third level of the Divine God of Punishment. The power of this secret technique will then have a qualitative change,” mumbled Jian Wushuang to himself.

However, his 8,000 feet tall Divine God of Punishment was much stronger than his previous 5,000 feet tall.

The huge Golden God Shadow formed was overlooking heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang then unleashed the Seven Stars Secret Technique and caused his divine power to skyrocket at an extremely terrifying speed.

His divine power had already reached the Peak Heaven Ultimate God Realm under the black stone’s disguise. However, his divine power had increased crazily once again and exceeded the Heaven Ultimate God realm in the blink of an eye. It ended up elevated to the Grand Ultimate God realm.

“Grand Ultimate God?”

“He has risen to the Grand Ultimate God realm?!”

Those people who were watching the battle exclaimed.

“So what if he’s a Grand Ultimate God?”

Fo Yi did not take Jian Wushuang seriously and dashed forward. The tip of the golden long spear in his hand condensed at one point as a bright golden light suddenly burst out.

Jian Wushuang gave a cold snort before taking a step and soon appeared in front of Fo Yi. He then swept his Blood Mountain Sword across. The movement seemed soundless and stirless but space-time, heaven, and earth seemed to have completely overlapped.

A unique sword shadow was fleeting amidst the overlapping!

Space-time Sword Technique’s sixth form—Overlapping Shadow!

Clang! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The sound of metal clashing rang as Jian Wushuang discharged his entire divine power.

His sword shadow collided with Fo Yi’s golden light before frantically permeating terrifying powers.

Fo Yi’s face sank.

“This kid has such amazing power. He’s so tyrannical.” Fo Yi was quite surprised.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had relied on his Perfect Chaotic Creature’s physical ability combined with the Primordial Void Celestial Body to produce divine power at the level of a Peak Heaven Ultimate God before making a breakthrough. After he had had a cultivation breakthrough and performed the Seven Stars Secret Technique along with the Divine God of Punishment, all of that strength combined was definitely not weaker than the average Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. In fact, it could even be stronger.

The reason they were evenly matched was only that Jian Wushuang’s had performed the Space-time Sword Technique against Fo Yi’s Golden Law. Among those two techniques, Fo Yi’s Golden Law was much stronger.

Buzz!

A slight sound of heaven breaking through could be heard as Fo Yi narrowed his eyes and noticed the void next to him. A huge black divine sword had appeared at some point like an awl that could drill through a mountain. It pierced through the void and shot toward Fo Yi. It was so powerful that Fo Yi dared not take it lightly.

“Retreat!”

Fo Yi stepped back and slightly lifted his golden spear amidst moving before causing his spear tip and the black divine sword to crash into each other. The black divine sword was slightly shaken and thrown into the nearby void before Fo Yi wielded the golden spear and swept it across in a special trajectory. Dazzling golden light flashed again and aimed at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was fearless as he swung his Blood Mountain Sword in concert with the Transmigration Sword Formation to fight against Fo Yi.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

There were incessant sounds of metal clashing with each clash accompanied by a pervading majestic force.

Old Snake was watching from a void nearby and secretly groaned, “Jian Yi is powerful for someone that’s only a Peak Heaven Ultimate God. He’s not weaker than the average Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. We could’ve handled Fo Yi together had he joined hands with me, but now...”

Old Snake shook his head slightly.

As expected, the golden spear in Fo Yi’s hand turned into a golden python in just a moment. It was swaying around and finally slammed against Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword and sent Jian Wushuang flying into the air.

At the same time, Fo Yi sneered, “Your divine power isn’t weak, but your understanding of the laws and principles is unfortunately too low. You can only dream of fighting against me with such strength level!”

Fo Yi continued to attack and had completely displayed his true strength.

He thrust his golden spear again and again. Every movement was mercurial and stronger than before.

For a time, Jian Wushuang could only put on a defense mechanism and retreated while being completely suppressed by Fo Yi.

Jian Wushuang’s face sank.

“I’m no weaker than him in terms of divine power. In fact, I’m slightly better than him. I’m indeed a lot worse than him in terms of law and principle understanding.” Jian Wushuang knew his shortcomings well.

His true cultivation realm was only a Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God after all. He was merely relying on his special physical abilities and also his secret techniques to reach the divine power level he was displaying.

In terms of law and principle understanding, he was considered extremely strong amongst the Heaven Ultimate Gods as many Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods were not as good as him. However, he was still lacking when compared to a genuine Grand Ultimate God.

More so when he compared himself with Fo Yi whose strength had reached the peak of a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God.

That was the reason Jian Wushuang was at an absolute disadvantage in the battle.

“The gap between our law and principle understanding is too large. I can only compensate for it with secret techniques.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

In the next moment, majestic divine power erupted from his body. The divine power was so pure that a layer of dark golden armor was formed over his body in the blink of an eye.

The dark golden armor was exactly the Nine Sparkle Star Armor!

The difference being only a piece of golden armor was formed over his body when Jian Wushuang previously used it.

The one he had on his body at that moment was dark golden in color!

The dark golden armor was no longer the Golden Amor, but had become the Precious Armor!

The third level of Nine Sparkle Star Armor—Precious Armor!

The dark golden armor covered Jian Wushuang’s entire body which made him look even more intimidating but his divine power had not changed in any way.

However, the fact that his divine power had not improved did not mean his strength had not.

Boom!

The black divine sword which resembled an awl that could drill through a mountain once again shot out under Jian Wushuang’s control and sent forth at Fo Yi.

It was still the Transmigration Sword Formation’s first level, Heaven’s Edge.

Fo Yi glanced at the black divine sword but did not fluster. He picked up his golden spear just like before and tried to cast the black divine sword away again.

However, the result was...
