Chapter 3091: Left Alone

_______

After a fierce battle, the ground in the void that had been completely sealed by the black fog had become pockmarked.

Even in the void, time and space had not completely calmed down.

Jian Wushuang and the others gathered together, and there were three cold corpses lying under their feet.

They were the red-haired man, the black-robed young man, and the beautiful woman in golden armor from the Dao Palace.

Although their divine bodies were intact and did not suffer any damage, their souls had been completely destroyed.

“Soul destruction…” Jian Wushuang shook his head secretly.

It was indeed difficult to kill a True Saint expert with an immortal body.

However, some special poisons that could corrode the body and soul were the two best weapons that could restrain the body.

Those special poisons were better. After all, if the poisons wanted to corrode the god power, they had to pass through the skin of the cultivator and transfer the poison into the other’s body. Most true saints wore protective armor, to do this, they had to forcefully tear apart the other party’s protective armor.

Therefore, in the Divine Beginning Realm, only those who used sharp weapons like swords, sabers, daggers, spears, and so on were suitable to use these special venoms.

As for those who used axes, hammers, or gloves, most of them used force to suppress others, sending their power through the suppression to the other party’s divine body. However, it was very difficult to deliver the venoms into the other party’s body, so they naturally could not use them.

Moreover, not only were these special poisons expensive, but they also needed a certain way to buy them. Thus, there were very few cultivators who really used these special poisons to kill their enemies, so they were not too frightening to true saints.

And what truly frightened True Saints was the destruction of their souls!

The soul was the foundation of the cultivators. Once their souls were destroyed, no matter how strong their divine bodies were or how much divine power they had, it was useless. This was common sense.

Therefore, experts who were good at soul attacks would attract attention no matter where they were.

“Jiu Luo,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said, “let’s part ways here.”

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, are you leaving?” Jiu Luo immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “I went to the Young Divine Sect to find a place to stay and familiarize myself with the environment of the First Heaven. Now that I’m familiar with it, I naturally have to leave.”

“But…” Jiu Luo wanted to say something, but Jian Wushuang had already waved his hand and interrupted him.

“Bai Xiao.” Jian Wushuang looked at Bai Xiao again. “I know what Bai Jue and Iceberg are planning. Go back and tell them that I’m grateful for their kindness, but I don’t plan to join the Dao Palace now. But they don’t have to feel regretful because I’ll go to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect soon.”

“Oh?” Bai Xiao was surprised.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He was telling the truth.

He had promised Xue Bei that he would go to the bloodline of the blood ancestor in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. However, he was too weak now, so he did not know much about the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect and the bloodline of the blood clan. Since there were many bloodlines in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect…there might be some internal competition, so he did not dare to go rashly. But when he was stronger, he would know more or meet experts from the bloodline of the blood ancestor.

“Goodbye, everyone.” Jian Wushuang did not stay any longer and left.

In the void, Jian Wushuang was flying forward alone.

Many thoughts appeared in his mind.

“Elder Mo Shan said that the heaven-cleaving secret realm will open in 80 years. Now, only 30 years have passed, and there are still 50 years left. In these 50 years, I can try to break through the First Heaven. Besides…”

“I am comprehending both the space-time principles and the reincarnation principles at the same time. Now, the space-time rule has reached the third stage, and I have studied it to a certain extent. In terms of comprehension, I am very close to a rank five True Saint. But in terms of the reincarnation principles, my progress is very slow,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He was comprehending both the space-time principles and the reincarnation principles at the same time, and the two complemented each other.

But now, the Samsara principles was far behind the space-time principles.

“I’m only a rank one True Saint now, but my comprehension of the space-time principles is too high. My realm is limited, and my progress is obviously not as fast as before. In the past 50 years, I can completely focus on the Samsara principles.”

After making up his mind, Jian Wushuang immediately began to think of ways to improve his comprehension of the Samsara principles.

On the other side…Bai Jue and Iceberg had long known that Jian Wushuang, Xiong Tao, and the others had been attacked. However, when they rushed over, the black-clothed men had already left, and Jian Wushuang had also left.

Then, they carefully inquired about the outcome of the matter and also obtained a mirror image of Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao’s battle.

Seeing the mirror image, both of them were very shocked.

“I knew this little guy was very strong. Otherwise, the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would not have given him a place to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm so generously. But I didn’t expect this little guy to be so powerful!”

“Xiong Tao is the strongest expert among the first rank True Saints of our Dao Palace, and he is a special life-form. His divine power is comparable to a third rank True Saint. How could he be no match for him?” Bai Jue exclaimed.

“That’s not all,” Iceberg said in a low voice. “According to what my disciple said, the Heavenly Sword Marquis didn’t use his full strength when he fought with Xiong Tao. It wasn’t until the black-robed men arrived that he revealed his full strength. He actually killed a peak fourth rank True Saint. It’s simply inconceivable!”

“Xiong Tao’s combat power is already considered incredible among the first rank True Saints, but he’s actually much stronger than Xiong Tao. Could it be that he’s also a special life form?” Bai Jue could not help but ask. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s very possible.” Iceberg nodded slightly.

“Forget it. No matter what this little guy’s background is, since he said that he would make a trip to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect in the future, this means that he doesn’t have any hostility toward our Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. In fact, he might even have some connections. That’s already not bad.” Bai Jue smiled, however, his expression immediately turned cold. “Let’s not talk about this little guy now. Let’s talk about those black-robed men.”

“Our Dao Palace has always been very strict in protecting the geniuses under our command, especially top geniuses like Xiong Tao. This time, Xiong Tao appeared at this genius banquet because he received my orders. I originally thought that Xiong Tao would only participate in this genius banquet and leave after a battle with the Heavenly Sword Marquis without encountering any accidents. I never expected that such a small mistake would actually cause our Dao Palace to suffer heavy losses!”
