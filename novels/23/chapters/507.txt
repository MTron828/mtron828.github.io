Chapter 508: Catch him!

“Where is the rest of this technique?”?Jian Wushuang thought with a flicker of desire in his eyes.

Since he was able to reach Level Four with ease, it would be easy for him to master Level Five and Level Six. That meant he still had more room to improve his body and strength.

While Jian Wushuang was absorbed in cultivation, Wu Yuan and Qing Huo were walking towards the Drill Ground, accompanied by many clansmen.

“Leader, I brought back Level Five and Level Six of the Bone Fusion Technique. I’ll carve the Level Five manual onto the stone tablet, as for Level Six...

“It’s precious, so I’ll give it to you. Leader, if our clansmen master Level Five, you can give them the Level Six manual,” Qing Huo said. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“OK, I think that’s good.” Wu Yuan nodded. “I’ll accept it. Qing Huo, we’ll all benefit from the two manuals you brought back. Thanks.”

“For our tribe and the entire human population, this is what I should do.” Qing Huo causally waved his hand.

They quickly arrived at the stone tablet, just in time to see Jian Wushuang practicing the Bone Fusion Technique.

“Hum, little brother Wushuang?”?Wu Yuan was astonished.?“He’s practicing the Bone Fusion Technique? He has a powerful body and is considered terrifying among warriors at the same level. Hasn’t he already practiced a Body Reshaping Technique?”

“Did he just start practicing Level One?”?Qing Huo wore a bemused expression.

Human Warriors from the Monster Continent usually exercised from birth. When their body became strong enough, they started to practice Body Reshaping Technique, which was usually around the age of seven.

Therefore, it was odd for them to see Jian Wushuang practicing this technique at the age of 20.

“Leader, who is he?” Qing Huo asked.

“He’s Jian Wushuang,” Wu Yuan replied, “Not long ago, his tribe was exterminated by another tribe. He had been chased out by his enemy and fainted in the back of the mountain. Yu’er found him and brought him back.”

“It’s strange. Several days ago, we caught a Cloud Realm monster spy. Because of my mistake, the spy almost hurt Yu’er and Qing Hu. Fortunately, he blocked the attack in time. His body is already very powerful, but he hasn’t practiced a Body Reshaping Technique?” Wu Yuan frowned.

Hearing this, Qing Huo’s face fell.

Jian Wushuang stopped his cultivation when Wu Yuan and Qing Huo noticed that Jian Wushuang had reached Level Four of the Bone Fusion Technique.

“He has reached the Fourth Level in such a short time. It should be easy for him to reach Level Five or even Level Six, but why hasn’t he practiced a Body Reshaping Technique before?” Qing Huo narrowed his eyes.

“Catch him!” Qing Huo growled.

The clansmen behind him rushed forward even though they were puzzled about what was happening.

Jian Wushuang, who had reached Level Four, was in a celebratory mood, but as he saw clansmen dashing toward him, he was stunned.

He looked over at Wu Yuan and Qing Huo. “Leader Wu Yuan, you...”

“Qing Huo.” Wu Yuan frowned at Qing Huo.

“More and more monster spies are hiding within the human population. A monster spy was killed several days ago, but there’s already another.” Qing Huo stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Father, you mean Big Brother Wushuang is a monster spy. How is this possible?” Qing Hu said while shaking his head.

“No, no. Big Brother Wushuang is a human. How could he be a Demonic Beast?” Wu Yu cried.

“You two kids know nothing. Little Yu, come here quickly.” Qing Huo said in a gravelly voice.

Wu Yu was dragged aside by the other clansmen even though she was reluctant.

Jian Wushuang was besieged by the clansmen who were holding weapons.

As the Divine General of the Monster-exterminating League, Qing Huo was their tribe hero, so those clansmen would not doubt his words.

“Wait a moment. Stop,” Wu Yuan ordered.

He glanced at Jian Wushuang with a hint of suspicion, but he said, “Qing Huo, don’t rush to a conclusion. We’d better check first.”

“Hum, every Human Warrior starts to practice a Body Reshaping Technique in their childhood, but he has never practiced a Body Reshaping Technique before and already has such a powerful body. If he is not a Demonic Beast, what is he?” Qing Huo responded in an icy tone.

“But this is not enough to confirm he is a Demonic Beast,” Wu Yuan said with a frown.

“We don’t know where he comes from.”

Qing Huo gave the young man a flinty look and said in a low voice, “Boy, you said that your tribe was destroyed by others and that you were being hunted by your enemy when you fainted at the back of the mountain. Then where are you from? Which tribe was hunting you?”

Although he felt aggrieved, Jian Wushuang had to admit that Qing Huo had reasonable grounds.

A Human Warrior in the Monster Continent would have practiced a Body Reshaping Technique since childhood, while Jian Wushuang, who had such a powerful body, started to cultivate this technique just now. It did not make sense.

Furthermore, Jian Wushuang came from the Divine Land, where he had no access to Body Reshaping Techniques.

He lied about his origin because he did not want anyone to know that he came from somewhere outside of the Monster Continent.

So how could he tell them the name of his tribe and enemy?

“I’m not a monster spy,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t argue for yourself.” Qing Huo said coldly while the other clansmen vigilantly stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Go invite Elder Water.” A clansman followed Wu Yuan’s order and left.

“Dad, Big Brother Wushuang was not a monster spy. Definitely not.” Wu Yu looked at Wu Yuan with a pathetic look.

“Don’t worry. Wait for Elder Water to arrive and everything will be made clear. If he isn’t, I won’t do him an injustice,” Wu Yuan said.

Wu Yu no longer spoke.

Jian Wushuang remained silent with a wry look.

Elder Water quickly arrived.
