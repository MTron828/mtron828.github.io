Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

It was true that it was a thousand-fold more dangerous than his first Inverse Cultivation Test. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“However, regardless of how dangerous it was, I passed through the second Inverse Cultivation Test,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Jian Wushuang,” Hall Master Yuan looked, “Now that you have passed through your second Inverse Cultivation Test and became a real Universe God in the Second Heaven, your power must have improved tremendously, right?”

“Power?” Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows and a smile was revealed on his face.

From a Universe God in the First Heaven to the Second Heaven, there was originally a huge gap. Any ordinary cultivator who managed to break through the threshold would naturally go through a transformation in power.

Jian Wushuang, who was an inverse cultivator, naturally had an even more terrifying power increase.

“I feel that I could currently fight against Ling Feibai without using Soul Power at all. It might even be difficult to call it a victory,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Ling Fengbai, the genius of the geniuses.

Due to the emergence of three Strongest Sword Principle, Ling Feibai, who was just a Universe God in the Second Heaven, could be compared favorably with an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven when his divine power erupted. Plus, he cultivated some secret skills and created unique skills. Hence, he could stand firmly on his feet among the Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven when it came to fighting power.

In the previous fight, Jian Wushuang could only rely on his Soul Power. He had put all of his tricks to play and could only be evenly matched with Ling Feibai. In the end, he was still defeated.

But then… Although they were both Universe Gods in the Second Heaven who had merged three Strongest Sword Principles, Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator and he possessed the Ancient God bloodline.

Even though he had passed through his second Inverse Cultivation Test and was still a five-starred Ancient God, he was now on the second stage of being a five-starred Ancient God. His Ancient God power had increased tremendously as well.

His divine power eruption alone was sufficient for him to fight against any Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. With the aid of Blood-killing Plate Armor and the divine power eruption, no ordinary Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven could win against him.

The eruption of divine power was so fierce. Even though he was weaker in unique skills, it could be compensated for.

Hence, Jian Wushuang had the guts to say that he could evenly match Ling Feibai without putting his Soul Power to play. It wasn’t a lie.

“I’m not sure how much more powerful you are now but I can sense that your overall power has increased tremendously,” Hall Master Yuan smiled, “And, as you have passed through your second Inverse Cultivation Test, you will appear as a Universe God in the Third Heaven in Lineage of Star. As you’re a Universe God in the Third Heaven, you can take a look at our most precious Real God Hall in Lineage of Star.”

“Real God Hall?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Real God Hall was quite famous in Lineage of Star.

Among all resources in Lineage of Star, it was the most precious kind.

It was a pity that the prerequisites for entering Real God Hall were extremely high. Not only did one have to be a disciple of Star Palace, but they must also be a Universe God in the Third Heaven.

Before Jian Wushuang had passed through his second Inverse Cultivation Test, he hadn’t been qualified to enter Real God Hall. But now, he was qualified.

“Real God Hall has great opportunities. If you were to grasp them properly, they would be enough for you to take your power to a whole new level. Plus, the opportunities in Real God Hall not only focus on power. They will be influential to your growth in the future,” Hall Master Yuan explained.

Jian Wushuang listened, getting more and more excited.

“Besides Real God Hall, Scripture Depository… As your second Inverse Cultivation Test was approaching, you had no time to cultivate your second secret skill. But now, you can take time to pick one from the remaining three secret skills and cultivate it. Any one of them would be extremely beneficial to you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had been yearning for the remaining three secret skills in Scripture Depository since long ago.

Especially when he had seen Ling Feibai performing Supreme Heaven during the battle. Ling Feibai defeated him because of that secret skill.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll give you a hundred years to cultivate the second secret skill from Scripture Depository. Be prepared. I will assign you your Ultimate Disciple Task a hundred years later,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Ultimate Disciple Task?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

“In a hundred years? Isn’t that too soon?” Lei Chao looked at Hall Master Yuan in shock.

“To the others, it might be too early. But to him, it’s not that early,” Hall Master Yuan smiled faintly.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

He had stayed in Lineage of Star for so long. Of course, he knew about the Ultimate Disciple Task.

Lineage of Star focused on nurturing geniuses, but geniuses only grow during difficulty and massacre. Lineage of Star knew that well.

Hence, Lineage of Star often passed down training tasks to their disciples. Among all the training tasks, the most dangerous and highest-level one would be the Ultimate Disciple Task.

The Ultimate Disciple Task could only be assigned to disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, and only disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven were qualified to complete the task.

The moment the task was given, the disciples couldn’t refuse and had to complete it within the given time. If one couldn’t complete it, the punishment would be severe.

Of course, the task would come with extra gifts. The extra gifts would also be a chance that was hard to come by. Hence, the strong disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven in Lineage of Star were dying to receive the task.

But because the difficulty of the final task was high, there were many disciples that died on the way to their journey. As such, under normal circumstances, only when disciples who were Universe God in the Third Heaven had reached a certain level would the task be assigned.

For one who had just passed their Inverse Cultivation Test and immediately received their Ultimate Disciple Task like Jian Wushuang, it would be quite rare. Only an absolute genius would receive such treatment.

“Come on, it’s time to return,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao departed back to Lineage of Star immediately.

…

In the boundless Milky Way, in Lineage of Star’s old lair.

Jian Wushuang parted ways with Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao the moment they returned.

Among the buildings, Jian Wushuang walked casually and came across many disciples in Lineage of Star on the way.

“Senior Jian Wushuang!”

“Greetings, Senior!”

The ordinary disciples saw Jian Wushuang and bowed politely.

Jian Wushuang found the sight strange.

“Before the battle, none of the disciples looked up to me. Forget about greeting me, they even looked at me in disdain. But now…” Jian Wushuang shook his head and sighed.

Power. It was all about power!

Ever since the battle where he had proved himself with his power, the doubts about him as a disciple of Star Palace in Lineage of Star had vanished into thin air.

The disciples utterly submitted to him and even revered him.
