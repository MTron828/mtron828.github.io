Chapter 1900: Indestructible Galaxy Formation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Outside Universe Galaxy, the experts from Star Extermination Alliance were still trying to figure out a way to break the formation.

No matter what tricks they pulled, even when the experts teamed up together, they couldn’t move the formation even an inch.

The formation was like an indestructible lofty mountain that blocked Star Extermination Alliance.

In the vast void, the commanders of the five major forces gathered together again.

“Although the galaxy is strange, I never thought it could transform into such a powerful formation!”

“We belittled Lineage of Star. I never knew Lineage of Star had such a trump card.”

“The formation is so strong, we couldn’t break it at all. What should we do?”

The few commanders looked distressed.

They didn’t know the galaxy in Lineage of Star contained such a powerful formation. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With the hindrance of the formation, as long as the experts from Lineage of Star didn’t come out recklessly, no matter how many experts from Star Extermination Alliance there were, they couldn’t do anything about them.

“Emperor God Tian Ling,”

Palace Master Wu Lou suddenly turned to a young man with snow-white hair who never spoke.

“In the fight earlier, why didn’t you attack?”

Palace Master questioned him, “Number One Divine King, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church and I already teamed up to suppress Jian Wushuang. If you join us and attack him with your all, the accumulation of our power could definitely kill Jian Wushuang. The moment we kill him, Lineage of Star will lose their final mainstay and they will definitely collapse.”

Number One Divine King, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church and the Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion looked at Emperor God Tian Ling in dissatisfaction.

When the experts from both campsites fought, the experts from Star Extermination Alliance attacked and most of them fought with their all but Emperor God Tian Ling…

From the beginning until the end, Emperor God Tian Ling had been staying in the nearby void without moving an inch.

Before the war ended and Lineage of Star returned to the galaxy, Emperor God Tian Ling had never fought.

One should know that it was a great opportunity. If Emperor God Tian Ling were to seize the chance, they definitely could make Jian Wushuang die on the spot.

Emperor God Tian Ling looked cold when he was being questioned by the others, “Three Peak Emperor Gods teamed up and couldn’t take down Jian Wushuang, who was only at Real God level and had only been cultivating for less than ten thousand years. How dare you question me?”

Palace Master Wu Luo and the other two Peak Emperor Gods were stunned.

“Emperor God Tian Ling, what do you mean?” Palace Master Wu Luo said angrily.

“There’s no issue. I only wanted to tell you that I disdain to besiege a Real God with three other Peak Emperor Gods. If I really want to attack, I will fight a fair battle with Jian Wushuang and kill him directly,” Emperor God Tian Ling said.

“Hehe, kill him directly?” Palace Master Wu Luo lifted the corners of his lips as disdain filled his eyes, “When the next opportunity comes, the three of us will stand-by-side and watch. We shall see how Emperor God Tian Ling kills Jian Wushuang alone.”

Number One Divine King and the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church sneered.

They had tested Jian Wushuang’s power personally.

The three of them had teamed up and gone all out but they could barely suppress him.

If they were to fight one on one, which of them would be Jian Wushuang’s match?

Although Emperor God Tian Ling’s ranking on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list was higher than the three of theirs, there should be a vast difference between his power and Jian Wushuang’s too.

“Alright, everyone. It’s not the time for arguments. Let us first think about how to resolve the formation in the galaxy,” the Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion tried to mediate the situation.

“Humph,” Palace Master Wu Luo humphed coldly and said, “The power of the formation is unusual. I’m afraid only a Great Emperor could break the formation. Although there are many Almighties in Star Extermination Alliance, the Almighties couldn’t concentrate all their power as one. In other words, it is difficult to do a hit similar to a Great Emperor’s.

“However, if there were to be a power superposition skill that was able to concentrate all our Almighties’ power into one, we might stand a chance to break the formation.”

“Power superposition skill?” The few experts at the scene exchanged a look.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there weren’t many of those power superposition skills.

A power superposition skill that could concentrate almost seventy Almighties’ powers as one would be even rarer.

At least, among the five forces, no one had that kind of power superposition skill.

“We can only make use of our sects’ influence and find a power superposition skill. Before we find one, we could take some measures,” the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church looked around.

“Although the galaxy formation is strong, there is definitely a flaw or weak point. Among the experts in five forces, there are many who are good at formations. Let them study and figure out a way to resolve it. Once they find a flaw, we can also break the formation even without power superposition skill.”

“Besides, before the formation breaks, we can’t let Lineage of Star be at peace. It’s obvious that they are trying to be a turtle hiding in their shells. If so, let’s send our men to taunt and ridicule them outside the galaxy. Let’s force them out of the galaxy.

Hearing what the Master of Real Martial Art had said, Palace Master Wu Luo and the others nodded in agreement.

“At this point, that’s all we can do,” Palace Master Wu Luo sighed.

“The formation gives Lineage of Star time to recover,” Number One Divine King felt regretful.

At first, Star Extermination Alliance could have just barged into the lair of Lineage of Star directly and rooted out Lineage of Star.

Then, their progress was stopped temporarily.

“Humph, let Lineage of Star live for a while. In no time, when the formation collapses, the people from Lineage of Star can’t escape,” the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church said coldly.

The higher-ups of the five forces reached a mutual agreement.

They sent their orders down.

From then on, although the experts from Star Extermination had given up breaking the galaxy formation, they continued to come before the galaxy every day to hurl abuse, humiliate and taunt the people inside.

They had no scruples and they were not worried at all.

The context of the humiliation was extremely sharp in one’s ear.

In short, they were offensive.

On the other hand, there were experts from Star Extermination who were good at formations constantly walking around the border of the galaxy to inspect the galaxy formation so that they could find a flaw in the galaxy formation or maybe figure out a way to break the formation.

Not only that, Star Extermination Alliance had also paid a great price to invite a few Almighties that were truly good at formations in Sanctuary Alliance so that they could help to inspect the galaxy formation.
