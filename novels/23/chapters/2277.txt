Chapter 2278 Descension

“It appeared, a complete passageway finally appeared!”All of the experts from the ancient past who wanted to get into the passageway and get back into the Absolute Beginning Divine World were elated.

“The passageway has completely opened. Looks like you are out of time,” Leng Ruxue stared at Jian Wushuang and said.

“So what if it had completely opened? All will be alright as long as you do not walk through the passageway,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Is that the case? Jian Wushuang, your understanding of this world is far too shallow. You are not to blame as you are always in this Heaven and Earth. You have yet to see what Absolute Beginning Divine World has to offer. Even though I only saw that world through the opportunities that my master left, I am already much more well informed than you.” Leng Ruxue smiled coldly.

“Jian Wushuang, do you think this is all that my master is capable of?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang turned pale as he had a bad feeling of what was to come.

At the next moment...

“Who is that?”

Someone exclaimed as the experts on the battlefield, including Jian Wushuang, looked over at Heaven’s Horizon once again.

At the edge of the dark mist, a blurry figure was walking out of the passageway.

It was a lady who was over two meters tall.

She walked out of the passageway and appeared in front of everyone.

The black mist around her finally dissipated and everyone could clearly see what she looked like.

She was extremely beautiful. It was as though she was a fairy from the fairy tales. Her looks were on par with Leng Ruxue’s.

Her temperament was the most attractive part of her.

She was extremely cold, just like Leng Ruxue.

Aside from her coldness, she was very proud.

This was the type of pride that only those who were at the highest level of their fighting power would have.

She scanned the battlefield with her icy eyes. She did not care about even the extremely powerful and famous people back from the Absolute Beginning Divine World like One Star Man, Bing Shan, Elder Shehua and Saint Soul. To her, they were insignificant.

“She, she is...”

Many of the experts from the ancient past widened their eyes in shock as they looked at the lady in disbelief.

Many of the experts gulped down air, not out of lust but because of their fear.

“Master of Holy Land, it is a Master of Holy Land!!!”

“The Master of the Holy Land has come personally!!!”

“Oh my god!”

These experts from the ancient past were stunned.

The Master of the Holy Land, the most powerful person in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Whatever they did, there would be rippling effects across the entire Absolute Beginning Divine World.

In the Absolute Beginning Divine World, the numbers of Master of the Holy Land were limited and one could count their numbers with just the fingers on their two hands.

This type of figure had come down to this Heaven and Earth personally?

“It is her!”

One Star Man widened his eyes as he stared at the lady. There was fear in his eyes.

He knew who she was and her true identity.

She was a true Master of Holy Land.

As a Master of the Holy Land, one was on an equal level to Heaven’s Will. Even though One Star Man was one step away from being one, their fighting powers were nothing alike.

Only the Leader of the Seven Stars, Emperor Thirteen, could hope to go against the Master of the Holy Land. The other six stars had to back off when they encountered her.

“No, there is no way a Master of the Holy Land can come to this Heaven and Earth personally. That is a consciousness embodiment,” One Star Man said deeply.

Indeed, an almighty Master of Holy Land would never come to this Heaven and Earth personally.

This was because even if they came here, they would be placed under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth and would not be able to use their true fighting power.

Under these circumstances, many things could go wrong.

The Master of the Holy Land was completely invincible back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Once one reached this level, they could do anything they wanted as it was almost impossible for them to die. However, there was a big chance that one would die here in this Heaven and Earth given how powerful the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth were.

No Master of the Holy Land would dare to mess around with their own lives. Hence, they would send in an consciousness embodiment in their place.

However, even their consciousness embodiments were incredibly powerful.

“Greetings, Master of the Holy Land!”

“Greetings, Lord!”

The experts from the ancient past greeted the lady respectfully.

The beautiful woman ignored all of these people, including Bing Shan.

She shifted her eyes and fixed her gaze on Leng Ruxue.

“Master.”

Leng Ruxue still had her white hair, grey irises, and a cold attitude. However, she immediately became more respectful when she spoke to the beautiful lady.

“Is that her master?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes as he studied the lady.

He felt a pressure like never before.

He had felt this pressure from Emperor Thirteen. However, the pressure from this lady was slightly stronger.

“I am here to bring you over to the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Let’s go.” The beautiful lady spoke coldly and firmly. It sounded as though she would not tolerate any disobedience.

She was one of the most powerful people in the Absolute Beginning Divine World for a very long time. Over the many aeons, no one had dared to disobey her as everything she said was an order, not a suggestion.

This was the absolute power she had.

“Yes.” Leng Ruxue nodded her head and started to head towards the lady.

Leng Ruxue took a step back right when she was about to start walking.

In the space less than ten meters in front of her, a sword light that was strong enough to tear even Heaven and Earth apart sliced the space mercilessly.

If she had taken that step out, she would definitely have been hit by that sword light.

“Huh? You still dare to stop me even in the presence of my Master? I do not know if you are really stubborn, or really dumb.” Leng Ruxue squinted her eyes slightly as she looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Evidently, that sword light had been created by Jian Wushuang to stop her.

“If you want to enter the passageway, you have to pass through me first,” Jian Wushuang said coldly and firmly.

“How dare you!”

A cold yell exploded in this Heaven and Earth.

Killing intent was clearly seen within the irises of the beautiful, tall lady, who stood beside the black mist. This killing intent turned into two flashes of lightning which attacked Jian Wushuang, threatening to turn him into ashes.

Jian Wushuang turned around as he swung the Blood Mountain Sword, which seemed as though it contained a storm, in rage.

Even when the Master of Holy Land was here personally, Jian Wushuang would not back down nor bow his head at all.
