Chapter 3617: 3,000 Years of Closed-Door Cultivation Translation

“What level is the heaven-suppression tablet?” Jian Wushuang asked in shock.

The heaven-suppression tablet was so terrifying that someone with the battle strength of a primary Ruler could instantly rival a superior Ruler.

“I don’t know what level it is, but I’m sure it’s more powerful than a supreme treasure. Only supreme-beings are qualified to use such a treasure,” Daoist Xuan God paused for a moment, then he said seriously, “Little guy, there’s only one reason why I’m telling you so much...”

“Your master is as strong as a superior Ruler. Although he doesn’t have your terrifying divine body, which is comparable to an elementary universe supreme treasure, the treasure in his hand is extremely powerful. Even so, he still died under that special spear. There’s no room for struggle. So, you must be very vigilant against that spear. In the future, if you meet an expert invited by the three Saint Realms and see him take out a strange spear, don’t hesitate and run away immediately. Do you understand?”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

He knew that it was the existence of that special spear that caused his master’s death.

He did not want to follow in his master’s footsteps. Of course, he had to be wary of that spear, which had a great restraining effect on any special life form.

“By the way, I’ve seen master’s heaven-suppressing tablet before,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It’s not strange.” Daoist Xuan God smiled. “Although your master died, he left a way out for the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. He sealed the entire Seven Star Divine Realm and kept all his treasures. He gave you the Mountain River Map, but the heaven-suppression tablet is too high-level. You were too weak to refine it.”

“But the heaven-suppression tablet must be left to you in the end. After you break through to become a Principles Master and break the seal, you can go to the heaven-suppression tablet and try to refine it!

“Once you refine the heaven-suppression tablet, your strength will certainly reach a new level.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The heaven-suppression tablet...Jian Wushuang had a trace of desire in his heart to make Xuan Yi, who only had the strength of a primary Ruler, a supreme treasure that could rival a superior Ruler in one leap.

“Well, continue to cultivate.” Daoist Xuan God waved his hand and said.

Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully to the three Rulers in front of him and then turned to leave.

After Jian Wushuang left, the three Rulers began to chat again.

“This little guy is worthy of being created by Xuan Yi, who gathered all the Heavenly Dao and good fortune in the Seven Star Divine Realm and the Divine Beginning Realm. He is even more blessed than Xuan Yi,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“Yes, a body-refining secret skill that can make your divine body comparable to a universe supreme treasure. I’ve never heard of it before. It’s too abnormal. Such a secret skill must come from the deepest part of the universe. In the deepest part of the universe, only some big forces can have it. To be able to get such a secret skill, it’s really extraordinary.” The Heaven Ancestor sighed.

“Not only that, he also had a special opportunity in the Blood Wave Realm. The Master of the Blood Wave Realm is undoubtedly a super powerful warrior from the depths of the universe. However, such a powerful warrior helped him with all his strength during the battle on the Saha Island. He even caused the entire Blood Wave Realm to collapse. It can be seen that their relationship is no small matter. After he came out from the Blood Wave Realm, his power has soared. It can be seen that the opportunity he got in the Blood Wave Realm is not small either.” Temporal Temple Master chuckled.

“He already has a heaven-defying opportunity. With the help of us and the things Xuan Yi prepared for him, he has thousands of opportunities in his body. If he can’t take the final step, there won’t be anyone else in the Divine Beginning Realm who has the same opportunity as him.”

The three sighed. Soon, Daoist Xuan God and Temporal Temple Master gradually disappeared. The Heaven Ancestor continued to pick up the axe in his hand and began to chop the trees next to him.

…

Jian Wushuang returned to the courtyard where he lived, but his heart was still very heavy.

“The supreme-level Immortal Xuan body did not disappoint me. It’s comparable to a divine body of an elementary universe supreme treasure, so I don’t have to care about ordinary elementary Rulers or even advanced Rulers now. However, just as Senior Xuan God said, Devil Cloud Star has a treasure that is specialized in restraining special life forms. My master died under that long spear. Although my current body-protection ability may be stronger than my master’s, that long spear can still pose a fatal threat to me.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

“Keep cultivating. I need to fuse the three rules as soon as possible and break through to become a Principles Master. When that happens, my strength will Sky Rocket. If I can refine the heaven-suppression tablet again, I might be even stronger than my master when he was at his peak. By then, even if my opponent has the special spear, as long as the real body of Devil Cloud Star Master doesn’t arrive personally, it shouldn’t be able to pose a fatal threat to me!”

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang began to cultivate in seclusion again.

This time, he was in seclusion purely to merge the three rules and break through to become a Principles Master.

Moreover, he had made up his mind that he would not come out of seclusion until he had completely merged the three princples!

Time passed quietly.

The merging of the three principles was dozens or even hundreds of times more difficult than the previous two principles!

However, Jian Wushuang had already mastered the destruction will. After so many years of groping, especially when he was trapped in the eighteen ultimate formation, the breakthrough in sword principle triggered the Universe Origin of Sword Principle. Although the universe origin was in the aspect of sword principle, it was more or less helpful to the various principles of heaven and earth.

Because of this, he had already made some progress in the fusion of the three principles. Now, he had obtained a large number of treasures from the Supreme Treasure Vault that combined the destruction principles, the space-time principles, and the Samsara principles, this allowed him to go further and further in the fusion of the three principles.

It was not until the 3000th year of Jian Wushuang’s seclusion.

Finally, he had completely fused the three principles he had comprehended.

“The three principles of destruction, space-time, and Samsara are perfectly fused!”

Jian Wushuang sat in the secret chamber with his eyes open, but his eyes were full of surprise and excitement.

After 3,000 years of secluded cultivation, he had finally taken this step and perfectly integrated the three principles. At the moment of integration, he immediately gained an additional power of will, however, this power of will was not what Jian Wushuang really wanted.

What he wanted was to break through the bottleneck that had troubled him for a long time.

“As I expected, after the three rules were merged, I could clearly sense where the bottleneck was. What I have to do now is to force a breakthrough!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed.

“Let’s begin!”

The Principles Master’s breakthrough began.
