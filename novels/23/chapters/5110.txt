Chapter 5111 ¬†Bloody Battle in the Great Desolate Wilderness (2)

Under the ancient Bodhi tree, the young samanera contemplated the Dao for 30 million years, firming up his Buddha's heart.

His purity of heart and unwavering determination left all who beheld him in awe, as if they were gazing upon the Buddha himself.

He had never experienced moments of doubt, not even when faced with the most profound scriptures. But now, he was confronted with the enormous matter of life and death. A young Yan Immortal with an equally resolute and pure gaze stared into his eyes, asking startling questions. Hu Qing found himself unable to maintain his inner serenity for the first time.

"Could it be that our masters' decisions were wrong, that we should not have made such a choice?"

"But my other masters have already sacrificed themselves in the Great Desolate Wilderness so that we could escape it. If we were to retreat, how could we face them?"

These profound questions left Hu Qing unable to maintain his composure. He stood there in a daze, unsure of what course of action to take.

Seeing Hu Qing no longer in a state of impulsiveness, Jian Wushuang released him and turned to look at the battlefield now engulfed in a bloody struggle. He furrowed his brows.

Just then, a small hand quietly tugged at the hem of his robe, and a trembling voice asked, "Kind sir, you said that you'll save us, even if it's just one person. Will you save my masters?"

Jian Wushuang turned and looked at the young samanera whose eyes still held a hint of timidity. He nodded solemnly, "Since I have said it, I will do it, but I may not be able to save them all."

"Then, I entrust it to you, kind sir." The young samanera, Hu Qing, folded his hands together in a gesture of gratitude and turned his gaze toward the masters locked in battle in the void. Eventually, a look of reluctance appeared in his eyes.

After making the decision, Jian Wushuang unconsciously raised his palm and patted Hu Qing's bald head. He instantly realized his action, blushed, hurriedly apologized, and then turned without hesitation to charge into the void.

Hu Qing pursed his lips and, in turn, subconsciously patted his own bald head. "Well, you must save all of my masters!"

On the boundary barrier, the void had already been shattered and torn apart by the supreme Yan power. The released Yan power formed the most violent whirlpool, with massive lightning bolts resembling giant dragons raging within the vortex, then erupting downward.

At the border of the Great Si Region, chaos had already taken complete hold. Various shades of iridescent divine blood splattered about, unable to descend due to its sheer purity, hovering in the void and making the battlefield even more gruesome.

The colossal war armor, reaching heights of tens of millions of feet, had succumbed to a state of frenzied rage.

But at this moment, the six Monks found themselves in even more dire straits, barely managing to hold their own thanks to their agility.

The gap between them was truly unimaginable, like an unbridgeable chasm.

Even with their combined might, they could not inflict significant harm upon the war-armored behemoth.

Once they reached the cultivation realm of Grand Yan Immortal, each Revolution would propel their skills and strength immensely. It was extremely difficult to compensate for the gap.

Among the six Monks, only one had reached the level of a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal. How could they contend with a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal?

This was something Jian Wushuang couldn't fathom.

Swinging his sword, each stroke capable of dealing severe damage to the Grand Yan Immortal, the war armor bellowed, "All of Zhen Wuyang's lackeys shall pay the price for my master!"

Above the bloody void, the composed and aged Grandmaster, almost single-handedly, bore the brunt of the war armor's relentless onslaught. The aura of his Image Form had dimmed to its limits, seemingly on the verge of vanishing at any moment.

Brilliant and dazzling spells stood guard in front of him, simultaneously drawing the majority of the armor-clad figure's attacks.

A horizontal sword strike sent hundreds of spells, along with the Grandmaster, flying.

Furthermore, the remnant sword continued its unrelenting descent, and once it struck, even a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal like him would undoubtedly meet his end instantly.

"Senior Brother!"

The other five Monks shouted, but they were too late to lend assistance, only able to watch helplessly as the sword descended.

In the next moment, a figure quietly appeared beneath the falling sword, raising a sword to meet it.

Clang!

The resounding clash of metal echoed through the ancient void, and an exceedingly pure Sword Intent burst forth, illuminating the profoundly dark void.

All the Monks widened their eyes in disbelief. Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com

The one who had previously resembled a bloodied corpse, lying almost lifeless in the Wild Desolate Wasteland, a mere fledgling Yan Immortal, was now single-handedly withstanding a sword strike.

Keep in mind, that sword strike came from a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal!

But this scene was undeniably real.

Time seemed to stand still as, beneath that descending sword, Jian Wushuang's eyebrows trembled slightly.

Jian Wushuang tightly gripped the Invisible Sword in his right hand, which had already become fragmented and shattered, his divine blood splattering into the void.

If it weren't for the terrifying defensive power of his Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body, that one sword strike might have turned Jian Wushuang into mere dust.

But he managed it, enduring the full force of the Nine Revolutions Great Yan Immortal's strike head-on.

Even the figure in battle armor was astonished, as if witnessing the impossible.

"You... you're not dead?"

Jian Wushuang's brow furrowed, and he quickly tossed an Emperor-grade pill into his mouth. "You want me dead? It's not that easy!"

"Then I'll make you die again!" The figure in battle armor was enraged, attempting to raise its left hand to strike him.

However, at that moment, six Monks simultaneously acted. They deployed six pure and sublime Buddhist chains of light that wrapped around the battle armor's left hand, preventing it from lifting.

"Good-hearted one, leave quickly!" Grandmaster shouted loudly, his expression solemn.

Jian Wushuang did not linger any longer. His figure vanished in an instant beneath the broken sword.

However, when he reappeared, it was in front of all the Monks.

"Everyone, leave quickly; I'll handle this." He spoke with an unquestionable authority.

Facing this young man who was merely a Yan Immortal, the Monks did not underestimate him.

They exchanged glances and then looked at Grandmaster together.

Grandmaster's expression was resolute, though there was a hint of hesitation that quickly vanished. "We can't retreat, we absolutely cannot retreat; we can only move forward."

"Can't you see the situation? Do you want all of us to perish here?" Jian Wushuang's voice grew solemn.

Grandmaster gazed at him. "Even so, we can't retreat. We won't take a single step back into the Great Desolate Wilderness. Even if it means death, we will die within the domain of the Great Si Region."

Boom!

In the midst of their conversation, the figure in battle armor swung his sword, scattering all the Monks.

Jian Wushuang narrowly avoided the strike and could not help but curse under his breath.

At this moment, Grandmaster spoke again, "My fellow disciples, I shall clear the path for you to the Great Si Region!"

As he uttered those words, a majestic Image Form emerged from pure Buddha's light, illuminating the countless realms.

Grandmaster's injuries instantly healed, and his aura returned to its peak in an instant.

Layers of hazy Buddhist light scripts flowed slowly around him, like the rising and setting of the moon and sun, too dazzling to gaze upon directly.

He clasped his hands together, and two supreme True Eyes emitted an unparalleled aura.

In this moment, his Immortal body and the majestic Image Form seemed to completely merge.
