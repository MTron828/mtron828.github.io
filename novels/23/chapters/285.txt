Chapter 286: A Twist

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Swoosh!

A chilling flash of a sword flew out and hacked right at the point of the spear, freezing Wu Jiu’s attack for a moment.

“Oh?”?Wu Jiu was amazed.?“he blocked my attack so easily?”

“That’s right. When Bei Mu and Leng Yang recommended him as a Protector, they said that they couldn’t beat him in a short while even in cooperation. Though it was due to their not trying their best, it still proved that this guy is much stronger than an ordinary expert in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.”

“It seems that I have to show a bit more strength to take him down,”?Wu Jiu thought.

He twisted his hands in a quirky way to throw his long spear at Jian Wushuang.

Along with this move, a huge vortex suddenly appeared.

Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!

He launched three attacks in succession with his spear, and each of them was as fast as lightning.

Jian Wushuang brandished the Triple-kill Sword and withstood the attacks.

“Bright Sun!”

A sliver of light flashed in Wu Jiu’s eyes. He raised the spear high and thrust at Jian Wushuang quickly.

Jian Wushuang held his sword up to defend himself. Though he succeeded, the power of the attack pushed him down, and the ground where he stood cracked under the force.

“Thunderous Explosion!”

With a loud shout, Wu Jiu held back the spear and then thrust again, like a dragon rushing at its target.

“Brat, go to hell!”

The dragon was so fast that Jian Wushuang could barely defend himself by putting the sword across in front of his chest. Two forces crushed together, throwing Jian Wushuang away as if he was blown off by an explosion. He fell on the edge of the Martial Arts Practice Field and bumped into the walls, cracking it into pieces.

“Powerful!”

“So strong!”

The other members of the Bloody Blade Team widened their eyes in shock.

“Humph, arrogant stupid, don’t blame me when you see the king of hell!” Wu Jiu snorted.

But just as he finished his speech, with a slight crack, from the broken walls emerged a figure who slowly walked to him.

“He didn’t die?”?Wu Jiu looked at Jian Wushuang in amazement.

“He is still alive? not injured at all?”

“He looks fine without even a scratch.” The members of the team were all astonished.

“Protector Wu Jiu, I thought you were as strong as you claimed to be. But it seems like you are not. I’m really disappointed,” Jian Wushuang said, shaking his head.

Wu Jiu was in a daze for a second, while the other experts of the Bloody Blade Team were stunned.

Having shown his strongest abilities, Protector Wu Jiu was still nothing more than a disappointment in Jian Wushuang’s eyes?

“No wonder you rank below 600th on the Bloodmoon List, Protector Wu Jiu. To tell you the truth, you are not even close to Shen Tianyu.” Jian Wushuang started moving as he was speaking.

Just in a moment, he crossed over 30 meters and came up to Wu Jiu. With his arrival came a puff of fog, coming into being the Realm of Sword Essence that wrapped Wu Jiu up. In the fog, suppressed by the Sword Essence, Wu Jiu could hardly move.

Just then, a shaft of dazzling sword light suddenly appeared and dove straight to Wu Jiu from above.

Frowning, Wu Jiu quickly thrust at the light with his spear.

Clang!

With a loud sound, Wu Jiu was forced to stagger backward, stern-faced.

But in the very next moment, sword flashes struck at him successively with frightening power and at an unbelievably fast speed, like roaring storms.

“This guy...” Wu Jiu hurriedly waved his spear to block the unceasing attack in horror.

Just in a breath, he successively blocked several attacks, but soon he found himself not able to keep up with the speed of the attacks.

“I can barely withstand the next attack.”?Wu Jiu’s heart tightened.

A cold metallic flash of the sword that shone like the light of the sun soundlessly reached Wu Jiu’s ear, making him chilled to the bone. But at that moment, he was not able to struggle but could only watch the flash getting closer to his face.

As the sword was about to pass over his head, it suddenly changed its course.

Clap!

The sword slapped in Wu Jiu’s face, making a loud sound, and his face began to turn into red and swollen. After spitting out a mouthful of blood, he smashed to the ground.

Swoosh!

The sword flashed again, and this time it hewed the ground beside Wu Jiu, whizzing past his arm. Crack! The center of the Martial Arts Practice Field was cracked into two parts by a long, bottomless rift measuring tens of meters.

The crack was in the shape of the sword. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Looking at the rift beside the ground where he was lying on, Wu Jiu swallowed hard, his throat getting dry.

He knew that if that attack had aimed at him, his body would have been cut into two parts like the ground.

“Protector Wu Jiu.” Jian Wushuang walked slowly up to Wu Jiu, looking down at him.

Trembling, Wu Jiu stared back at Jian Wushuang.

“You, you...” Wu Jiu wiped the blood off from the corners of his mouth, trying to get up.

Seeing Jian Wushuang suddenly get closer to him, Wu Jiu was more frightened and took a step back, saying, “What are you going to do with me?”

At this moment, Wu Jiu was in extreme fear.

“Nothing.” Jian Wushuang drew closer to Wu Jiu and said in a low voice, “Protector Wu Jiu, I’m not interested in being a Protector or the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid not because I am afraid. Don’t piss me off, or I’ll let you bear the consequences.”

“Though you’re the expert on the Bloodmoon List and very strong, you’re not made of iron and will die if you have your throat cut.”

Jian Wushuang stared at Wu Jiu sharply up close.

Wu Jiu was trembling, and he could feel Jian Wushuang’s killing intent. He finally understood that because of Jian Wushuang, a strong expert beyond imagination, the ninth team could kill Shen Tianyu.

“By the way, it’s time for you to give back what you borrowed from me, Protector Wu Jiu,” Jian Wushuang continued.

“What things?” Wu Jiu was stunned.

“Shen Tianyu’s body. I heard you took away the body, but I didn’t say that you did not need to return it,” Jian Wushuang replied with a casual smile.

Upon hearing this, the experts of the Bloody Blade Team were suddenly clear about the whole thing.
