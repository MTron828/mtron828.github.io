Chapter 2877: Joining Hands

——

Star Armor Realm, punishment prison, Sword World, and Nine Universe Blood Light River, Jian Wushuang had already exerted his realm techniques to the extreme.

Under the pressure of Nine Universe Blood Light River, the strength and speed of World Lord Tian Qu had been greatly suppressed. Now, the pressure on him had increased sharply, and his strength had been suppressed by more than 20%.

After all, he was an Immortal Saint.

His speed had been greatly reduced again, and he could no longer keep up with Jian Wushuang’s speed.

“Haha, Realm Lord Tian Qu, we’ll meet again.”

Jian Wushuang’s clear voice echoed in the world, but his figure kept pulling away from Realm Lord Tian Qu.

Realm Lord Tian Qu had no choice but to stop and watch Jian Wushuang leave.

Soon, Jian Wushuang completely disappeared from Realm Lord Tian Qu’s sight.

“How could he escape?” Realm Lord Tian Qu clenched his hands, his eyes surging with anger.

Although he was angry, Realm Lord Tian Qu still retained his rationality.

He had to admit that Jian Wushuang’s life-saving ability was very strong. He could not kill Jian Wushuang just because of his terrifying domain skill.

“No wonder this kid didn’t run away when he saw me coming. It turns out that he is very confident in his own strength or his life-saving skills. He just wanted to fight me face-to-face. After the fight, as soon as he achieved his goal, he left.” Realm Lord Tian Qu’s face was extremely ugly.

And right at this moment…

“Haha, Realm Lord Tian Qu, you’ve lost a lot of faces today. An Immortal Saint was actually tricked by a deity and could only watch as the other party left. This isn’t like you.” Deep laughter suddenly rang out from the surrounding void.

Realm Lord Tian Qu’s expression sank, his ice-cold eyes immediately turned towards the surrounding void.

However, he discovered two figures rushing over. One was old and the other was young. They were the black-robed old man from the Star Point Pavilion and the Young Master of the Star Point Pavilion, Chi Ming.

As for the one who laughed out loud, it was none other than the black-robed old man.

“Old monster Su from the Star Point Pavilion?” Tian Qu glanced at the two of them as his voice sank, “When did you arrive?”

“I arrived very early. It’s just that my Star Point Pavilion has a unique aura concealment technique and you didn’t discover it.” The black-robed old man laughed.

“Chi Ming greets Realm Lord Tian Qu.” Chi Ming bowed slightly.

Although he was the Young Pavilion Master of the Star Pavilion, when faced with a Realm Lord who was extremely powerful amongst the Immortal Saints, he naturally had to show some respect.

“Little fellow from the Star Pavilion?” Realm Lord Tian Qu’s expression was cold. “What are you all doing here?”

“To tell you the truth, we have been keeping an eye on Jian Wushuang for a long time, even earlier than you, Realm Lord Tian Qu. I asked someone to tell you the news about Jian Wushuang in the Fire Cloud Castle,” Elder Su said with a smile.

“Did you give us the news?” Realm Lord Tian Qu frowned.

He had come to the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City in a rage when he found out that Jian Wushuang had killed Qu Hong.

However, he did not know Jian Wushuang’s exact location at first. Later, someone told him that Jian Yi was staying in Fire Cloud Castle, so he left. He had been waiting near the Fire Cloud Castle for Jian Yi to appear, and he did get Jian Yi, unfortunately, he let him escape.

Now, he knew that it was someone from the Star Point Pavilion who told him the news.

“I have my eyes on Jian Yi, but he sent me a message asking me to take action. Is he trying to kill someone else?” Realm Master Tian Qu said coldly.

“Realm Master Tian Qu, don’t misunderstand. We don’t intend to kill someone else. It’s just that this is the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s territory, so it’s not convenient for our Point Star Pavilion to take action here. Moreover, although Jian Yi is only a Divine Master, his strength and skills are extraordinary. It won’t be easy to kill him. I’m sure you’ve already experienced this just now,” Elder Su said.

Realm Lord Tian Qu narrowed his eyes.

He had to admit that Jian Wushuang was indeed a difficult Divine Master to deal with.

“A Divine Master actually defeated my attack head-on!”

“After that, I tried my best to use my saint-level secret skill to kill him. That palm indeed crushed him completely, but after that, he was only in a sorry state and did not suffer any injuries. Such a method…”

There was no doubt that Jian Wushuang was not as strong as him.

However, after the battle, even if he did not choose to flee, Realm Master Tian Qu still did not have the confidence to kill Jian Wushuang.

“Old Monster Su, what does the Star Point Pavilion mean?” Realm Master Tian Qu looked at him.

“It’s very simple. It would be very difficult for me or Realm Master Tian Qu to kill Jian Yi. In that case, why don’t we join hands?” Elder Su said.

“Join forces?” The expression of Realm Lord Tian Qu could not help but shift.

“Realm Lord Tian Qu, you want to kill Jian Yi because you want to avenge your son Qu Hong. And the reason why our Star Point Pavilion wants to kill him is because of an item in his hands. Our motives aren’t contradictory, we can totally join forces.” Old Su said.

“You’re right, I only want him dead. As for the treasure on his body, I’m not too interested. Since that’s the case, we can indeed join forces. However, Jian Yi’s techniques aren’t ordinary, especially his domain techniques, they can restrict me greatly. Just now, he relied on his domain techniques to easily escape from me. Although you and I are both undying saints, if we can’t restrict his domain techniques, I’m afraid it would be very difficult to kill him.” Realm Lord Tian Qu said.

“That’s true, but it’s not a big problem.” Elder Su smiled.

“Don’t forget that our Star Point Pavilion is the number one chamber of commerce in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. We don’t have many other things, but we have the most treasures among all the forces in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. For example, we have quite a few domain-type treasures in our Star Point Pavilion. Although I don’t have any with me, I can find someone to send a domain-type sacred treasure over.

“At that time, with me personally controlling a domain-type sacred treasure, I can easily suppress Jian Yi’s domain. After all, he is only a Divine Master. Even if he has a domain-type sacred treasure of the same level, with his strength, he won’t be able to unleash too much power.”

“As long as his domain is restricted, he will be like a turtle in a jar. When that time comes, killing him will be much easier.”

“Sure.” Tian Qu’s eyes gleamed.

“Right, just in case, I’ve asked for another helper.” Elder Su suddenly spoke. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Who?” Tian Qu looked over.

“Don’t worry, you’ll know soon enough.” Elder Su smiled.
