Chapter 5479 Top Girl

"Two young masters, please come in. We'll bring the women out to you shortly!"

Following the person, they ascended to the third floor and entered a room adorned in pink. Through the window, they could still catch a glimpse of the snowy scenery outside.

Seated on a plush rocking chair, Jian Wushuang felt quite content.

In this mundane world, things weren't so bad after all.

Soon, the madam brought forward the so-called top girl of the Cui Xiang Building.

When Jian Wushuang saw the appearance of the woman, he nearly spat out in disgust. Pointing at her, he said to the madam, "Is this the top girl? The one worth ten taels of silver per night?"G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

The madam was somewhat embarrassed.

"Never mind, consider it a gift!" Jian Wushuang patted Liu San'er's shoulder and then said to the madam, "Do you have a woman named Thirteen Niang? Bring her here, and I'll take care of the expenses!"

Liu San'er grinned, "Big brother, so you have an old acquaintance here!"

The madam standing at the door felt a bit awkward and said, "Young master, Thirteen Niang has already been reserved. How about I bring two other top girls for you?"

"No, I want her. I can pay more!" After saying that, he tossed a dozen silver pieces onto the table.

Seeing Jian Wushuang's persistence, the madam couldn't say much. After all, who could argue with money?

Liu San'er leaned in, whispering, "Big brother, that's over forty taels of silver!"

"What's it to you! Go enjoy your top girl!" Jian Wushuang said impatiently.

All of this was a charade.

These ordinary people were just characters from a certain point in time.

Once he left this place, it would vanish, and so would they.

Now, it's uncertain when he could leave.

In this city, what secrets truly existed?

Jian Wushuang tilted his head, gazing at the snowy scenery outside the window, feeling somewhat dazed.

Beside him, Liu San'er clung to the leading lady, showering her with endless affection.

Before long, the voice of the old madam outside the door brought Jian Wushuang back to reality.

"Young sir, Thirteen Niang has arrived!" The madam pushed open the door, ushering in a woman clad in a thin red veil. After entering the room, Thirteen Niang adjusted her clothes and was about to cast a flirtatious glance at the guest in front of her when she recognized him and asked uncertainly, "Stinky beggar?"

The old madam on the side was startled, slapping Thirteen Niang on the shoulder in anger. "How can you speak to a guest like that? This young sir specifically requested you after declining the leading lady!"

"That's right, it's me!" Jian Wushuang revealed a slight smile.

Seeing this, the old madam smiled, saying, "Hehe, you enjoy yourself, young sir. I'll leave first."

Recognizing Jian Wushuang, Thirteen Niang, who was bold and fiery yesterday, now seemed a bit shy and blushed.

Bang!

A drunken man stumbled in, cursing as he entered. "You damned b*tch, who allowed you to leave? Did I not pay you?"

"Oh, Fourth Lord, this guest and Third Niang are friends. I just brought her here for a drink, and we'll leave soon!" The old madam hurriedly stepped forward to mediate, but the other party obviously wasn't buying it. He slapped the old madam across the face without hesitation.

"Hmph, a drink? Where can't I find a drink?" The drunk, addressed as Fourth Lord, grabbed the old madam's hair, brought his face close to hers, and angrily demanded, "I'm asking you, is there any wine here?"

Thirteen Niang was somewhat frightened, perhaps not wanting Jian Wushuang to see her in this state, so she directly ran out.

The old brothel owner's voice trembled, "Fourth Lord, I...

"How much did he pay?" Jian Wushuang stood up calmly and asked.

The drunkard looked at Jian Wushuang, a fierce light flashing in his eyes. "Kid, do I lack money? You want to compare yourself with me? Do you know who I am?"

Crack!

A wine jug flew out, directly smashing onto the drunkard's head.

The blood flowed down his face directly.

The one who threw the wine jug was Liu San'er. He was a bit tipsy, swaying as he walked over, pointing at the drunkard and cursing loudly, "Do you f*cking know who I am?"

The drunkard, struck by the blow, instantly sobered up, holding his injured head.

"I'm Li Si from the City Lord's Mansion. If you have the guts, don't leave. Wait for me!" Li Si left with a threatening remark, presumably going to get reinforcements.

Jian Wushuang heard this name for the first time. He hadn't been in this place for long, so he didn't know anyone.

On the side, Liu San'er, upon hearing the name, seemed to be stunned for a moment.

"Brothers, you better leave quickly. The other party is the steward of the City Lord's Mansion. It's not something you can afford to offend!" the old brothel owner advised.

Thirteen Niang had already left. Staying here was meaningless, so Jian Wushuang, carrying the dazed Liu San'er, walked towards the door.

"Big brother, we're finished!" Liu San'er held his head, squatting on a street corner.

Li Si's reputation was known to everyone in the eastern part of the city. He was the top lackey of the City Lord's Mansion, ruthless and vengeful, a fierce character who would settle scores.

"When you threw the wine jug, weren't you afraid?" Jian Wushuang found it somewhat amusing; this bewildered youth was just too young.

The two stood by the street, unsure of where to go!

In this vast city, there wasn't a single place to settle.

Because he had fought with Li Si, Liu San'er dared not return home and could only follow Jian Wushuang.

"To go to the City Lord's Mansion, which way should we take?" Jian Wushuang, seeing that the other was genuinely frightened, inquired about the City Lord's Mansion.

Liu San'er, dejected, said, "Just keep going along the next street; we'll get there. Let's forget about it for now and focus on saving our lives!"

Saving their lives?

There really was no need for that.

"You go to the west side of the city, wait for me in the fenced alley. I'll be there shortly!"

After saying this, Jian Wushuang took a brisk step and directly climbed over the wall.

He wanted to arrive at the City Lord's Mansion before the steward did and wait for him outside.

Since offense had been taken, it was either elimination or a future menace.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang's speed was fast. Though he was a mortal, past experiences had taught him a lot.

In less than a quarter of an hour, Jian Wushuang arrived at a corner outside the City Lord's Mansion. Looking at the snowy ground outside the mansion's gate, with no footprints in sight, he breathed a sigh of relief.

Then he began patiently waiting for Li Si's arrival.

Another quarter of an hour passed, but Li Si's figure was nowhere to be seen.

Jian Wushuang felt something was amiss. It had been almost an hour, and there was still no sign of the other party.

"Is there another way out?"

But that shouldn't be possible!

There was no movement inside the City Lord's Mansion either.

"Time to go!" An ominous premonition struck Jian

Wushuang, making him feel uneasy for reasons he couldn't fathom.

Since he arrived here, he had become an ordinary person, so feeling uneasy was somewhat normal, Jian Wushuang reassured himself.

The distance to the west of the city was not insignificant, and he didn't hurry on his way.

When he reached the fence-lined alley, Liu San'er was waiting there.

"Big brother, you finally came back! Where did you go just now?" Liu San curiously asked.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, gesturing for him not to worry about it, then spoke, "Let's find a place to hide for now, and we'll talk when it's daylight."
