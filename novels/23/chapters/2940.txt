Chapter 2941: Hunters and Prey

——

“Another five. This is the 12th Black Dragon Mountain expert I’ve killed.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the five corpses in front of him with a cold smile.

In two days, he had encountered three groups of Black Dragon Mountain experts.

These three groups were made up of Divine Masters, and they were all killed by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had killed 12 experts from Black Dragon Mountain, and he had gained more than 5,000 points.

“There are less than half of the 10,000 points left,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

With his strength, killing these Divine Masters was a slaughter.

However, no matter how many of them there were, there was no room for resistance.

At this speed, he could reach the requirement of 10,000 points in two days at most.

But at this moment… whoosh!

A figure suddenly rushed over from the distance and stopped in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked over.

It was a hunchbacked old man. The hunchbacked old man looked pale and weak, but his eyes were full of vigor.

When the hunchbacked old man arrived, he immediately saw five corpses floating in the void in front of him. The hunchbacked old man’s eyes immediately shrank.

“It’s him.” Jian Wushuang also looked at the hunchbacked old man.

Although he did not know the name of the hunchbacked old man, he still had an impression of him.

There were 27 Divine Masters participating in the assessment, but there were only five Immortal Saints.

The pale-faced hunchbacked old man was one of the five Immortal Saints.

“Sir, what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Did you kill those five?” The hunchbacked elder pointed at the five corpses and asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Judging from the residual aura of those five people, they are all at the Peak Divine Master realm and are not weak. After you killed them, you should have gained a lot of points, right?” The hunchbacked elder licked his lips.

“Yes, I got a lot of points. Including what I got before, it should be more than 5,000 points,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“5,000 points?” The hunchbacked old man’s eyes immediately lit up.

He was a Genuine Immortal Saint, but his strength was not very strong. That was why he came to participate in the assessment of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. To a large extent, he was also here to try his luck. And for this assessment mission, as an Immortal Saint, he… you have to get 50,000 points to pass.

50,000 points, but not a small number, the fastest and best way is to find the Black Dragon Mountain Immortal Saint, think of a way to kill two or three.

But he did not have the information to kill the Immortal Saint of Black Dragon Mountain, so he could only set his eyes on the Great Divine Master level of Black Dragon Mountain, in addition… There was also the Invincible Divine Master level who participated in the assessment!

Plunder!

Yes, the hunchbacked elder had already thought of plundering.

In any case, the goateed elder had said that there were no rules in this assessment and that any means could be used, including mutual plundering and killing!

Even if the hunchbacked elder killed Jian Wushuang now, it was not against the rules to take the identity tokens that represented points from Jian Wushuang.

“Boy, give me all the identity tokens you’ve got, and I’ll let you live. Otherwise…” The hunchbacked elder’s eyes turned cold.

“Otherwise, otherwise what?” Jian Wushuang smiled. “I’ve long seen that you have bad intentions. I do have no less than 5,000 points. If you want them, just come and take them. I don’t know if you have the strength.”

“You’re courting death!” The hunchbacked elder was furious, and the Immortal Saint’s aura rose instantly.

A terrifying pressure came directly toward Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, the hunchbacked elder immediately moved.

His eyes were full of killing intent, and he was already charging toward Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, it’s you who’s courting death.”

Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all. He rushed forward to meet the hunchbacked elder.

“You’re just a Divine Master. How dare you fight me head-on?” The hunchbacked elder laughed disdainfully. A dark long spear appeared in his hand. This dark long spear was covered with mysterious dark airflow. Under the hunchbacked elder’s control, with a swoosh, it turned into a bolt of sharp black lightning and burst out. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang also brandished his Blood Mountain Sword.

With a casual wave of the Blood Mountain Sword, an invisible sword essence and even a hazy sword shadow burst out.

Clang!

The two collided.

Under the impact of the terrifying power, the hunchbacked elder’s dark spear was knocked aside.

The Blood Mountain Sword continued to sweep toward the hunchbacked elder’s head.

“How is this possible?”

“A Divine Master’s power can actually suppress the Immortal Saint?”

The hunchbacked elder was shocked and immediately retreated backward. At the same time, layers of dark airflow condensed in front of him, trying to block Jian Wushuang’s sword.

The Blood Mountain Sword was above the dark airflow, and the endless dark airflow was immediately dispersed. A mocking smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face.

A majestic sword essence suddenly burst out.

The ninth move of the space-time swordsmanship, Storm!

Buzz, buzz, buzz. A large number of space-time rules gathered together with the sword essence, forming one space-time blade after another.

There were more than 400 space-time blades that had completely fused with the sword intent.

Space-time laws and sword arts were perfectly fused together!

Boom!

A violent wind suddenly swept up between heaven and earth, and a huge sword intent storm completely enveloped the void where the hunchbacked old man was.

This storm contained more than 400 space-time blades, as well as an endless amount of shocking sword intent. It was extremely terrifying, killing everything in its path.

“No!”

The hunchbacked elder let out a hysterical roar. His eyes were full of fear.

He had originally thought that Jian Wushuang was his prey and wanted to steal Jian Wushuang’s points. Since Jian Wushuang was unwilling to hand it over, he wanted to kill Jian Wushuang directly.

However, he had never expected that Jian Wushuang, a Divine Master, would have such terrifying battle strength.

As a result, the roles of hunter and prey changed in an instant.

The endless sword essence finally dissipated completely.

The world returned to peace. As for the hunchbacked old man, his body had already been ground into pieces. Only his dark spear and his interspatial ring remained.

Jian Wushuang went forward and put away the hunchbacked old man’s spear. Then he began to search the hunchbacked old man’s interspatial ring.

The hunchbacked old man was an immortal saint and had a lot of wealth. He had a lot of ready-made sacred elixirs, as well as a lot of identity tokens that represented points.
