Chapter 1906: Galaxy Giant

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Almost a hundred and twenty Dao soldiers and two Peak Emperor Gods, that’s the true power of Lineage of Star?”

“They have stronger power than Star Extermination Alliance but they have been holding back and didn’t attack. They are… showing the white feathers!!”

Showing the white feathers?

The guest elders thought of that.

Then, they gasped a breath of cold air.

As Lineage of Star had been showing the white feathers, Star Extermination Alliance broke the formation to barge in, didn’t it mean… it was a trap?

“Everyone, Lineage of Star has held back for two hundred and fifty years for the scene that just happened. Now, it’s time to haul the fishing net,” Jian Wushuang smiled,” Hall Master Yuan, tell them about the galaxy.”

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded. He looked at the guest elders, “Everyone, it looks as though Star Extermination Alliance broke the galaxy formation. But in actual fact, I was the one who led them to break it. Not only that, after they break in, I will lead them to the core region of the galaxy formation. Then, the galaxy formation’s power will be displayed fully.”

“Later, I will send all of you to the core of the galaxy formation as well. There, you will receive power support for the formation. The power that you can perform would be stronger than before. This is one of the advantages.”

“Second, I will control the spacetime in the core region. I will utilize spacetime to provide utmost assistance to all of you. For instance, when you were to be severely injured and at the brink of death, I will immediately perform spacetime measure to move you in order to ensure your safety. Of course, if you were to die too quickly, I couldn’t do anything about it.”

“Besides the two mentioned advantages, the galaxy formation also contains fierce attack skill. You will know about the attack skill later.”

Hall Master Yuan said and the guest elders were surprised.

Previously, they had thought that it was merely defense power of the galaxy formation.

However, from what it seemed, the formation was far beyond that.

They already possessed a stronger team formation than Star Extermination Alliance originally. In addition to such powerful formation… The time was right, geographical and social conditions were favorable to Lineage of Star.

These guest elders started to pity Star Extermination Alliance’s upcoming result.

“The people from Star Extermination Alliance have already arrived at the core region,” Hall Master Yuan suddenly said.

Everyone beamed with joy.

“Sword Emperor, let’s take action,” Emperor God Xuan Wu said in a hurry.

“Don’t be in a hurry, let me play with them first,” Hall Master Yuan smiled creepily.

In Universe Galaxy, the core region of the galaxy formation.

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance continued to plunge forward and intended to barge into the lair of Lineage of Star.

However, after flying for a while, forget about the lair of Lineage of Star, they didn’t even see a shadow.

“Something’s not right.”

The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church, “The galaxy formation was Lineage of Star’s reliance. Theoretically, when we were attacking the galaxy formation, Lineage of Star should respond. However, we already broke the formation and barged into the galaxy for so long. Lineage of Star didn’t even move an inch. There wasn’t any expert who came to stop us either. This is not normal.”

“What’s not normal? From what I see, Lineage of Star definitely knew Star Extermination Alliance had barged in and they are panicking. Hence, they are gathering their experts and disciples to plan how to escape,” Number One Divine King smirked in disdain.

“Escape?”

The surrounding people heard that word and they smiled. Obviously, they agreed with the idea.

Two hundred and fifty years ago, Lineage of Star and Star Extermination Alliance had fought and the difference in their power had been fully displayed.

Lineage of Star couldn’t match evenly with Star Extermination Alliance.

Otherwise, they wouldn’t have hidden in the galaxy formation for two hundred and fifty years and they wouldn’t have yet to counterattack when they were humiliated.

Then, the formation collapsed. Under normal circumstances, the experts in Lineage of Star would definitely opt to escape. At most, they would only send some of their experts to hold them back in order to buy more time for more people to escape.

Most people thought so.

It was because Lineage of Star had showed the white feather for over two hundred years. Hence, they thought so.

“Don’t bother about that. No matter what measure Lineage of Star takes, before the absolute difference of power, everything will be in vain. Until we barge into the lair of Lineage of Star, we will kill all experts in Lineage of Star,” Palace Master Wu Luo was soaring with murderous intention.

The people in Star Extermination Alliance nodded heavily.

Just then… Vroom!!!

A terrifying power suddenly concentrated in front of the experts in Star Extermination Alliance. In a short while, the power substantiated into four huge figures.

The four figures were four one-eyed giants that was more than ten zhang tall. The one-eyed giants were holding a mace each. Their intense aurae that carried rage within were given out from the one-eyed giants’ bodies and pressed at Star Extermination Alliance.

“What are those?”

“Such strong aurae. In terms of aurae, the four giants don’t seem to be any weaker than Emperor God.”

“Judging from their bodies, they were substantiated from energy, not real lives.”

The experts in Star Extermination Alliance stopped and their gazes fixed upon the four one-eyed giants.

In the depth of the galaxy, everyone in Lineage of Star could see clearly through the galaxy.

“Hall Master Yuan, these four giants are…?” The guest elders looked at Hall Master Yuan suspiciously. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“These are one-eyed giants substantiated by the galaxy formation, also known as galaxy giants. Every single one of them has the power of an Emperor God. With the power that the galaxy formation possessed, it could substantiate four of them and it is already at its maximum limit,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Everyone heard and was surprised again.

The four one-eyed giants were four Emperor Gods!!!

“Let the four one-eyed giants play with Star Extermination Alliance first,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

At the core region of the galaxy formation, four one-eyed giants had already attacked.

They were holding a mace each as they soared with murderous intention. They charged at the experts in Star Extermination Alliance ferociously.

The experts in Star Extermination Alliance were raging with anger. They naturally counterattacked immediately.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

A loud thud reverberated in Universe Galaxy. Every single thud could easily break mountains and split rivers. However, to Universe Galaxy, such a thud wouldn’t cause any effect.

In such a ferocious fight, the four one-eyed giants displayed fighting power that wasn’t any weaker than an Emperor God’s.

They brought about great trouble to Star Extermination Alliance.

However, there were many Almighties in Star Extermination Alliance. There was a total of ten of them. They weren’t shakeable by the four one-eyed giants.

In a short while, the four one-eyed giants were forced into a desperate situation.

“Hall Master Yuan, the four one-eyed giants can’t hold any longer,” there was a guest elder that immediately said.
