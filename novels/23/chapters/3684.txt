Chapter 3685: Impenetrable

The three great Saint Realms had been the overlords of the Divine Beginning Realm for countless years.

This place had once been the Holy Land of cultivation that countless cultivators dreamed of.

This place had given birth to countless top experts.

This place had once been looked up to by countless cultivators and countless factions.

All this while, the three great Saint Realms had been lofty and unsurpassable existences.

The three great Saint Realm masters represented the will of the Heavenly Dao of the Divine Beginning Realm. They had spoken and followed the principles in the Divine Beginning Realm, attracting countless experts to worship them.

Until now, the three great Saint Realms were still the heavens in the hearts of most cultivators in the Divine Beginning Realm!

But today, the three great Saint Realms were surrounded by countless experts.

The east side was directly in front of the three Saint Realms and was guarded by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

As the number one alliance in the Divine Beginning Realm, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was undoubtedly extremely powerful. The power that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance possessed was even more powerful than a sacred land to a certain extent.

And now, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was personally led by the three palace masters and the few commanders. They gathered more than 100 Principles Masters and close to 100,000 True Saints above rank 6. They only needed to wait for an order and this army of close to 100,000 experts…would directly attack the three Saint Realms from the front.

…

To the south was the Temporal divine hall, one of the three freedom alliances. In addition, the Purple Blood Sect, Supreme Oblivion Valley, and the other ten or so powerful forces of the Divine Beginning Realm were guarding it. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although the Temporal divine hall was relatively weak in the three freedom alliances, it did not have many cultivators. However, in terms of top-tier combat power, it was not much weaker than the other two freedom alliances.

As for the Purple Blood Sect, Supreme Emotion Valley, and the other ten or so great factions with deep foundations, they did not have many Principles Masters. However, they had countless cultivators at the level of saints, therefore, the two sides just so happened to combine together. They also had over a hundred Principles Masters and an army of over a hundred thousand Immortal Saints!

…

In the north, the top experts of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, who were called ‘Ancestors’ led the way. Ghost Ancestor, Spirit Ancestor, and even the Blood Ancestor had rushed back from the Universe Battlefield, these top experts, who were called ‘Ancestors’ led countless experts under their command.

In addition, there were the coalition forces of two of the six celestial sects.

In total, there were more than 100 Principles Masters gathered in the north, and there were more than 150,000 troops of rank six True Saints and above.

…

In the west, behind the three Saint Realms.

According to Jian Wushuang’s guess, once the three Saint Realms were defeated, countless cultivators would probably choose to flee to the rear. Therefore, the combat strength guarding the rear was definitely the strongest.

With Xiao’er as the commander, the combat strength of the four divine races was gathered under her command.

Each of the four divine races was extremely powerful. At their peak, there were more than 10 to 20 Principles Masters in any divine race, and the Nine-tailed Clan was even more powerful, because of Xiao’er’s relationship, the number of Principles Masters gathered had reached as many as sixty to seventy.

Even though they had just experienced a great battle and the four great celestial races had lost a lot of their combat power, after the four great celestial races were united, there were still more than one hundred and twenty Principles Masters, there were also other top races like the Blood Marten Clan, Devil Ape race, and other races from the Demon Realm who were all present.

It could be said that in this battle, Xiao’er commanded nearly 90% of the Demon Realm’s highest combat strength.

Other than that, there was also the remaining four-sided Sky Sect Alliance army from the six-sided Sky Sect Alliance Army.

With all of these added up, the combat strength here was shockingly strong. There were nearly 200 Principles Masters alone, and there were more than 300,000 experts above the sixth level True Saint Realm!

This strongest combat power would completely block the path of retreat for the cultivators of the three great Saint Realms, not giving them any chance to escape!

…

Of course, even though the three great Saint Realms were now completely surrounded, to truly destroy the three great Saint Realms and uproot them, there was still the most important link. If this link was not done, then this allied army operation…was nothing but a joke.

This link was the three great Saint Realm Masters!

The three Saint Realm Masters were supported by the will of the Heavenly Dao. They represented the will of the Heavenly Dao of the Divine Beginning Realm.

With these three Saint Realm Masters around, the three great Saint Realms would have nothing to worry about.

Therefore, if they wanted to destroy the three great Saint Realms, they first had to kill the three Saint Realm Masters.

However, the strength of the three masters of the Saint Realm was obvious. In the Divine Beginning Realm, even an expert at the Ruler Realm could not do anything to the three masters of the Saint Realm.

Buzz!

The space shook slightly.

Three figures appeared one after another in the empty void around the nest of the three Saint Realms.

These three figures were Jian Wushuang, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and Temporal Temple Master.

As soon as they arrived in the void, they sensed the countless experts gathered around the three Saint Realms.

“They are all here. It seems that we are only waiting for our attack,” Temporal Temple Master said with a smile.

“This time, we have gathered 80-90% of the top forces of the Divine Beginning Realm to attack the three Saint Realms together. In terms of overall strength, the Coalition army is much stronger than the three Saint Realms. They definitely have the ability to completely destroy the three Saint Realms.”

As the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master spoke, he suddenly changed the topic, “However, if we want to completely uproot the three Saint Realms, we must first kill the three Saint Realm Masters. Even if I, spacetime, and the Heaven Ancestor join hands, we can’t do that. Only you, Heavenly Sword Marquis, can do that.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“In addition, Xuan God has also sent word that star palace is fully prepared. As long as we attack the three Saint Realms, he and the Heaven Ancestor will lead the experts of Star Palace to immediately destroy the three Saint Realms’ base in the universe battlefield, which is the Holy Island,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Destroy the Holy Island?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. “Aren’t the Rulers from the Devil Cloud Star in the Holy Island? With them, Xuan God and the others won’t be able to do it easily, right?”

“No.” Temporal Temple Master shook his head. “Xuan God has already placed people in the holy pill, but according to the news from the Holy Island, the three Rulers from Mo Yunxing have already left the Holy Island. I don’t know where they are. Xuan God guessed that the three Rulers are most likely in the Divine Beginning Realm. They are most likely in the nest of the three Saint Realms.”

“Are the three Rulers here too?” Jian Wushuang looked into the void ahead.

His soul power had already spread out, but the three Saint Realms were too vast and were blocked by many magic arrays. Even he could not sense the auras of the three Rulers.
