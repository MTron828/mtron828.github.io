Chapter 121: The Roar From The Abyss

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“All of you can go to hell!”

With a thundering sound, Jian Wushuang suddenly flitted past those six gold-masked assassins like a ghost.

Before these six golden-masked killers including Darkblader, head of them, could make a response, their throats felt stung and then there disappeared both their sound and breath.

While Jian Wushuang was using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, he almost beat the purple-masked assassin to death.?Killing these gold-masked assassins was very easy for him.

“Do you think you can escape?”

Lin Yun took a deep breath and looked at his black robe. Then he chased after Jian Wushuang. As for the loss of those gold-masked assassins, it was not important to him.

After killing those six gold-masked assassins, Jian Wushuang fled into the woods. But Lin Yun appeared above the woods, standing in the air.

One was standing in mid-air while the other was fleeing through the woods in a rushed manner, using the trees to hide his presence.

Those two terrifying auras moved off into the distance.

Near Quiet Moon Lake, a lot of Warriors in the Gold Core Realm watched what was happening. The events they just witnessed had caused huge waves in their hearts.

What did they just see?

A total of ten gold-masked assassins came to kill Swordsman, but all of them were killed. Not a single one of them was left alive.

Then a purple-masked assassin appeared and fought against Jian Wushuang in person, but the result was that he was defeated and currently sprawled out in a huge pit on the ground. It was still unclear if he was alive or dead.

What had caused the land within a few hundred meters to dry out, become brown, and lose its vitality so easily?

Then, a second purple-masked assassin appeared, Lin Yun, who was, in fact, the Governor of Blizzard City.

Like a bomb, these scenes were exploding in the minds of these warriors, leaving them deep in thought.

There was no way.

So amazing!

Each scene was unbelievably amazing.

Even now, Lin Yun was still chasing after Swordsman.

“Hurry up! Let’s follow them.”

“Hurry up and follow! Let’s watch and see if Swordsman can escape.”

“Ha-ha, what an unprecedented battle! It was far more exciting than the battle with Xiao Mang. Hurry up so we can go.

A large number of warriors were suddenly storming out, chasing after Jian Wushuang and Lin Yun as if they were the tide.

“Wushuang, please run faster and escape! Please!” Su Rou was praying and clenching her beautiful hands as she rushed to the forefront.

...

In a forest.

Swoosh!

Terrifying?spear shadows bombarded towards Jian Wushuang like thunderbolts, as he shifted his body so fast that the spears struck the tree he was standing on instead. The overwhelming power of the attack caused the big tree, together with others around it, to splinter.

His face was red, and the tendons stood out under his skin, but a strong desire for survival could still be seen in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“I... still have the chance to survive!”

“There is still a chance!”

Raising his head, Jian Wushuang fixed his eyes steadfastly on a majestic mountain that was not far away, behind which the Abyss was located. It was recognized as the most dangerous area in the Endless mountain range.

The Abyss may be a dead end for others, but for him it was the last chance at survival.

Jian Wushuang was crazily roaring in his heart,?“Hold on, hold on.”

After he stopped using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, his aura had declined. But the damage caused by the incredibly overwhelming increase in power from using the Skill was beginning to show.

He felt like his internal organs were burning along with an unprecedented anguish.

The pain was too strong and sharp for an ordinary person to bear, even for those experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm, who were tremendously frightening. Clenching his teeth and hands, Jian Wushuang focused on keeping himself lucid. His fingernails were already digging into his flesh as he used his last bit of strength to stagger towards the Abyss.

He eventually made it to the top of the Majestic Mountain, in front of the Abyss that lay between the two mountains.

Not until he had arrived did he stop moving.

Whoosh!

But Lin Yun also arrived, staring at Jian Wushuang with his cold eyes.

There were also many Warriors following after him, all of which had eyes that were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

They all wore complicated expressions that seemed to express their sighs, pity, and mercy above all.

Everyone was well aware that Jian Wushuang had been driven into a corner.

Behind him was the Abyss, which could frighten anyone.?In front of his stood Lin Yun, a legendary expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

He had no chances left.

“Ten gold-masked assassins together with two purple-masked assassins formed this group, which was enough to kill an expert of the Yin-Yang Void Realm. As a kid in the Initial Gold Core Realm, you should be proud to die at the hands of our Blood Feather Tower,” Lin Yun said while staring at Jian Wushuang with his cold eyes.

“All that remains is for you to obediently accept your death.”

Lin Yun was approaching Jian Wushuang as he spoke.

Jian Wushuang felt something surge into his throat, then he coughed up a mouthful of blood. After wiping the blood from his mouth, he looked at Lin Yun, who was closing in on him. His lips were fraught with a strange smile.

“Do you think you can kill me by yourself?”

“Hahahaha!!!”

Jian Wushuang burst into mad, almost hysterical, laughter.

“My life can be taken by heaven, earth, or anyone else.”

“But the people from Blood Feather Tower, only you will never be allowed to kill me!”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang glanced towards everyone present. Then he?stepped back, rushed towards the Abyss, and jumped in.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang was overwhelmed by the cold wind from the Abyss. But he roared at it, full of unyielding will, growling at the heaven and earth.

“Even if a dragon rises out of the blue sea, I would have no good feelings for Wu Tai!”

“The day I return is the day all you demons die!”

“If I live through this, I definitely turn Blood Feather Tower upside down when I come back!”

His shout roared out, resonation with the Abyss so much that it reverberated through the endless sky, leaving a lasting echo.

Even the sky was shaking.

It resonated with the land.

All of heaven and earth was in shock!

A number of warriors gathered near the Abyss. They were pale at the moment because they could constantly hear the echoing of Jian Wushuang’s words in their mind.

“The day I return is the day all you demons die!”

At that moment, everyone stopped breathing and fell into deep silence.

“Will he really come back?” One of the warriors muttered.

There was an old burly man standing next to him who shook his head and said, “If he dies, then everything will end here. But, if there is a day where he really does return, I am afraid that Blood Feather Tower will come to an end.”
