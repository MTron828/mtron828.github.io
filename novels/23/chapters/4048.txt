Chapter 4049: The Fifth Level of the Principle Sea

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Azure Flame Astral World.

Under the jade blue sky, it was a purgatory.

The entire boundless land was being crazily burned by a blazing fire. This blazing fire had a strange purplish-black color. It had been burning on this land for countless years, yet it had never been extinguished.

The cultivators of the Green Flame Star World, not to mention the Rulers of principles, even some extremely powerful Rulers did not dare to easily set foot on this land. After all, if a Ruler stayed on this land for a slightly longer period of time…it was possible for them to be burned to ashes by the blazing flames of this land.

However, under this vile illusion, a devilish purple-clothed youth was located at the very center of the blazing flames of this land. Endless purplish-black flames were wildly burning. To this devilish purple-clothed youth…it was like nourishment for him.

He was training on this land, just like a fish in water, incomparably comfortable.

Right at this moment…

Sou!

A human figure suddenly descended.

“Disciple.” The Green Flame Star Lord appeared in front of the violet-robed devilish youth.

“Ruler, why are you here?” The violet-robed devilish youth raised his head in surprise.

“Something has happened. Disciple, come with me.” The Green Flame Star Lord spoke.

“Oh?” The violet-robed devilish youth could not help but stand up, asking in puzzlement, “What is it?”

“Gui Yun, who is guarding the Principle Sea, just sent me a message saying that a second level Ruler is currently challenging the Principle Sea, and has already passed the first three levels.” The Green Flame Star Lord said.

“What?” The violet-robed, devilish-looking youth was shocked, but then his expression turned extremely grave.

He now knew why his Ruler, the Green Flame Star Lord, had come looking for him.

This was because he was the only person in the entire Bone Pupil Star Field who had comprehended the principles of the universe. He was also known as the publicly acknowledged number one genius of this starfield, however, he had only comprehended a sliver of the principles of the universe at the fourth-level Ruler level. Up until now, he was still only at the fourth-level Ruler level. However, in terms of the principles of the universe, he had been able to pass the second level of the Principle Sea not long ago.

However, the difference between the second and third levels of the Principle Sea was already enormous. Furthermore, the other party was only a second-level Ruler.

“Let’s go to the Principle Sea.”

Green Flame Star Lord waved his hand and immediately rushed toward the Principle Sea with his disciple, the evil purple-clothed youth.

At the edge of the Principle Sea, the look of shock on the Watchman Gui Yun’s face had disappeared and was replaced by a faint smile.

He was also quite happy.

It was known that the reason why he, the watchman, existed was to dig out some super geniuses hidden in the universe. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang, who could pass the third level of the Principle Sea as a second-level Ruler, must be one of the top geniuses.

“A second-level Ruler can pass the third level of the Principle Sea. He is qualified for me to report it. Well, don’t worry, let’s wait for him to finish,” Gui Yun said with a smile.

Suddenly…Gui Yun opened his eyes wide.

“The, the fourth level?”

He was completely stunned.

It was already incredible for a second-level Ruler to pass the third level of the Principle Sea. However, he had just learned that Jian Wushuang had passed the fourth level of the Principle Sea!

After all, there were three steps in the Principle Sea, from the third level to the fourth level. It was a huge leap, but Jian Wushuang had also passed it?

“He has already entered the fifth level. Could it be that he can still pass the fifth level?” Gui Yun gulped, his eyes shining brightly. He was already looking forward to it.

The fifth level of the Principle Sea!

Jian Wushuang was still standing on the vast ocean, and in front of him was a cyan-robed elder.

Jian Wushuang was no stranger to this cyan-robed elder, because he had met him on the previous four levels. However, the strength he displayed was different on different levels.

“You have a bright future as a second-level Ruler.” The cyan-robed elder looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of admiration in his eyes.

“Please give me some guidance, senior.” Jian Wushuang was quite humble.

“Just like the first four levels, if you defeat me, you will be able to enter the sixth level.” The cyan-robed elder smiled slightly and then directly attacked.

Boom!

The ocean below suddenly surged up. The cyan-robed elder held a pitch-black long staff in his hand. The long staff was like the waves in the ocean, crushing toward Jian Wushuang in a mighty manner.

It was not very powerful, and the universe origin of the staff principle was not very strong. However, the long staff contained an extremely rich power of the universe principles.

Jian Wushuang immediately moved. He held the Wuqi Divine Sword in one hand, and a large amount of the power of the universe principles swept up and met it directly.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The two crazily collided on the surface of the ocean. They constantly competed in speed and power. In the blink of an eye, they had met hundreds of times.

Suddenly, the cyan-robed elder twisted his wrist casually, and the black longstaff suddenly split into two in the void. The two black longstaff smashed toward Jian Wushuang almost at the same time.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “It’s the same attack. I can’t tell which one is real and which one is fake. What’s going on?”

Jian Wushuang was confused.

The cyan-robed elder did not use a special movement technique or secret skill. Instead, he relied on his comprehension of the power of principles to change his attack from one to two, and they were exactly the same, Jian Wushuang could not see any flaws at all.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang urged his comprehension of the principles of the universe and tried his best to use his swordsmanship to block the two stick shadows.

However, in the Principle Sea, with the same divine power, the same comprehension of the dao, and even the same speed, he could not block the two stick shadows at the same time.

Jian Wushuang tried his best to block one of the stick shadows, but the stick shadow turned into an illusion, and the other stick shadow hit Jian Wushuang’s divine body without any resistance.

Jian Wushuang immediately retreated. It took him a while to regain his balance on the surface of the sea, and the crazy sea finally calmed down.

“Little guy, you lost.” The cyan-robed elder looked at Jian Wushuang calmly.

“How could this be?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He did not expect that he would lose like this?

Most importantly, when he fought with the cyan-robed old man, he clearly sensed that the cyan-robed old man’s comprehension of the universe principles was worse than his.

Yes, he did not know how high the cyan-robed old man’s comprehension of the universe principles was. However, in the fifth level of the Principle Sea, his comprehension of the universe principles was indeed inferior to his.

However, when the two of them fought, he lost.
