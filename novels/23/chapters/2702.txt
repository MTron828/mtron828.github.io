Chapter 2703: Heaven Ultimate God Breakthrough!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I won’t be taking the initiative in fighting for you according to Palace Keeper Si Zhen, but I’ll stay with the force you’ve created for the next two years. If an enemy arrives and is within my capabilities to handle, I’ll dismiss the enemy. However, I’ll leave if the opponent is much stronger than me without returning these Divine Elixir Pills and Primordial Stones,” said Old Snake indifferently.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and said, “That’s alright. Please come with me.”

Jian Wushuang immediately led Old Snake into Dragon City and arranged a place for his stay.

Jian Wushuang then entered his secret chamber and began to cultivate in seclusion.

There were a lot of Divine Elixir Pills suspended in front of him in the secret chamber.

“The Star Fort Master is only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. Old Snake has probably discovered that I’ve gotten on the Star Fort Master’s wrong side after arriving at the Sword Alliance. He should know that the Star Fort Master would probably be here to seek revenge yet he didn’t say or ask about anything. I guess he’s confident that he can deal with the Star Fort Master. In that case, I’ll focus on absorbing and refining these Devine Elixir Pills and achieve a breakthrough as soon as possible.

“Let’s start!”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and began to refine those Divine Elixir Pills without hesitation.

Time began to slowly pass.

While Jian Wushuang was refining those Divine Elixir Pills...

Inside the Star Fort magnificent hall.

Several figures gathered together with Gu Mo being one of them.

Gu Mo and Shi Mo had joined Star Fort a long time ago but did not announce to the public that they had created Corpse Palace just so a new second-rated force could be set up in a short period to enhance the Star Fort’s overall strength as they were planning to discreetly do so.

Surprisingly, their long-awaited opportunity ended up becoming great assistance to Sword Alliance instead.

In addition, Star Fort had suffered a heavy loss in the battle!

“I’ve received news that Su Han is currently cultivating in seclusion,” said a middle-aged red-haired man in a deep voice.

“That bastard is chilling after killing Fo Wu and Shi Mo? How dare he! He doesn’t even see Star Fort as a threat!” The eyes of the several Star Fort experts were burning with anger.

“Although he’s now in seclusion, we found out that he had invited a mysterious expert to man the Sword Alliance. This mysterious expert has a triangular head pattern-skinned green snake on his shoulder. If I’m not mistaken, he must be the Strange Old Snake of the Danyang Continent,” said the red-haired middle-aged man again.

“Old Snake? Isn’t he a Grand Ultimate God?”

“Su Han invited a Grand Ultimate God to man his Sword Alliance?”

“No wonder he dares to go into seclusion without worries. He has gotten help.”

All of those people present were just Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods and were rather knowledgeable. They had heard of Old Snake and knew he was a Grand Ultimate God they could not trifle with. Star Fort would not dare act rashly to seek revenge with Old Snake in town.

“Damn it! What the hell is the Sword Alliance’s background? How can they get help from a Grand Ultimate God?” A Peak Heaven Ultimate God cursed in a low voice.

Gu Mo solemnly said, “I’ve long suspected there should be other forces secretly backing the Sword Alliance. Sword Alliance’s rise is too fast. I’m sure it requires a lot of resources to support its growth. Likely, some forces are secretly supporting it. We initially thought their support was some relatively strong second-rated forces equivalent to Star Fort which was the reason we dared to fight against the Sword Alliance.

“Judging from the current situation, I’m afraid that the forces behind the Sword Alliance aren’t just some second-rated force, but a first-rated one!”

The situation in the Danyang Continent was complex whereby it was normal for some powerful forces to secretly support the rise of new forces.

However, a first-rate force would give support to the second-rated forces under normal circumstances and rarely support third-rated forces.

It was why Gu Mo and the others subconsciously thought the Sword Alliance had support from some second-rated forces.

However, they would never be able to invite Old Snake for help in such a short amount of time if that was the case.

“Hmph, no matter who’s behind the Sword Alliance, Star Fort would never let them off so easily for killing my big brother and Fo Wu even if they are the top guns!” Gu Mo shouted sharply.

“Yes, never let them off!”

Several other people also nodded in agreement.

Suddenly...

“Eh?” The red-haired middle-aged man was alerted. “Everyone, the Fort Master has responded.”

“Quick! Tell us what the Fort Master says!” Gu Mo immediately turned to the red-haired middle-aged man.

“The Fort Master says that he knows about everything, but is currently going through a critical period, so he won’t appear for the time being. However, he said it won’t take long and would be out of seclusion at most around a year with his strength also greatly improved by then. He’ll lead us to the Sword Alliance when the time comes. As for Old Snake, Fort Master may not be able to handle him now but things will be different after the Fort Master completes his secluded cultivation. Old Snake alone won’t be a threat to the Fort Master by then,” said the red-haired middle-aged man.

“Great!”

Gu Mo and the others’ eyes lit up with hope. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“The Fort Master told us to hold on and not rush into taking revenge. He’ll personally annihilate the Sword Alliance once he completes his secluded cultivation,” the red-haired middle-aged man continued.

“If this is the case, we shall then quietly wait.”

Gu Mo and others made a decision.

Jian Wushuang thought the Star Fort would gather their experts in the shortest possible time with the Star Fort Master personally leading them in attacking the Sword Alliance. He was prepared to fight the Star Fort but did not realize that the Star Fort Master was also cultivating in seclusion.

In addition, the Star Fort Master happened to be at his most critical stage which was why he could not make a move.

Therefore, there was no movement from the Star Fort for some time.

As for the movement within the Sword Alliance, the three forces—Corpse Palace, Divine Dragon Pavilion, and Purple Dress House—had all been assimilated into the Sword Alliance. Many experts from the three forces had joined the Sword Alliance with many even joined the Divine Sword Official Army. The strength of the Divine Sword Official Army had skyrocketed with those new additions.

The entire Sword Alliance had become much stronger than before.

Time was slowly passing by.

Jian Wushuang, who stayed in the secret chamber, had been seizing the time to refine and absorb those Divine Elixir Pills.

Jian Wushuang was left with 2,400 Divine Elixir Pills after 3,400 Divine Elixir Pills were deducted with the 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills given to Old Snake and needed one year and six months to refine all those 2,400 Divine Elixir Pills.

Once it was completed, his cultivation realm had made a breakthrough to the next realm as he anticipated!
