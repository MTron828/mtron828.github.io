Chapter 1705: Power of Absolute Beginning

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Within the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, white pond water was flowing about. Jian Wushuang was inside the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning and only his head was left on top of the water.

“This is the Power of Absolute Beginning?”

Jian Wushuang felt the white ‘pond water’ thoroughly.

It was pure and it did not have any impurities!

“It’s too pure. It’s power is even purer and in a greater amount than the Demon Core’s power,” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Hall Master Gu Xin was right. The Power of Absolute Beginning had to be the purest power in the Eternal Chaotic World.

For such a power, not only could it be absorbed and changed into Divine Power, it also contained shocking recovery powers.

It was no wonder that a dying Emperor God had recovered to his peak after staying in the Divine Pond for three years.

“Let’s try it.”

Jian Wushuang attempted to absorb the Power of Absolute Beginning at once.

As he absorbed, the white ‘pond water’ around him entered his body slowly. After that, with the Heavenly Creation Skill active, the pond water started to transform.

After just a short amount of time, a small bit of Ultimate Divine Power, which was transformed from the Power of Absolute Beginning, was formed.

“This speed of transformation… it’s a lot faster than when I absorbed the Demon Cores. Moreover, in terms of quality, it is a lot better. The Ultimate Divine Power that has been transformed from the Power of Absolute Beginning that I have absorbed for this period of time is probably slightly higher than the amount I would get from absorbing a Grade Three Demon Core,” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes wide and they were filled with delight!

“Let’s begin!”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and he made the best use of his time immediately to start absorbing and transforming the Power of Absolute Beginning in the Divine Pond.

As he absorbed, the Ultimate Divine Power in his body continued to increase. After that, the eleventh droplet of Ultimate Divine Power started to precipitate slowly.

In just three days’ time, the eleventh Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet was precipitated.

“It’s too fast. It has only been three days!” Jian Wushuang was over the moon.

It should?be known that if he had continued to rely on absorbing the Demon Cores, it would be unknown how many Demon Cores and how much time he would need to precipitate the eleventh droplet of the Ultimate Divine Power.

However, in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, he only took three days.

“Let’s continue…”

With a frenzy of delight, Jian Wushuang immersed himself completely into absorbing the Power of Absolute Beginning.

Time passed by slowly.

…

In front of the bamboo house, Sir God Luo Sha and Sir God Mad Dog were sitting opposite each other, just like before.

“Ten years has already passed. However, Jian Wushuang still has not come out of the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning? In ten years’ time, I wonder how much Power of Absolute Beginning he has absorbed. Old witch, doesn’t your heart ache at all?” Sir God Mad Dog laughed.

“Do you think that I am you?” Sir God Luo Sha shot a glance toward Sir God Mad Dog, “The Divine Power that an Inverse Cultivator needs has indeed exceeded my expectations.”

“Hehe,” Sir God Mad Dog laughed strangely. After that, he flipped his hands and took out two White Blaze Fruits. He gave one of them to Sir God Luo Sha.

“This is… a White Blaze Fruit?” Sir God Luo Sha revealed a surprised expression.

“Old witch, don’t say that I am reluctant. I only have a total of two White Blaze Fruits and they were given to me by Jian Wushuang. Now, I’m giving one of them to you. Aren’t I being a good person?” Sir God Mad Dog laughed strangely.

Sir God Luo Sha did not stand on ceremony and put the White Blaze Fruit into her Qian Kun Ring right away. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

As for Sir God Mad Dog, he held the White Blaze Fruit in his hands and started to eat it with huge bites. He looked like he was enjoying it.

“It’s really a waste for the White Blaze Fruit to be in your hands,” Sir God Luo Sha curled her lips.

At the same time as these two Sir Gods were having a conversation…

Outside the black void, a giant spaceship from the outside world was travelling slowly. In the spaceship, there were four figures and they were looking forward at the black void which was filled with dense fog.

Among the four of them, the person at the front was a handsome young man who wore a luxurious purple long robe as well as a heartrending smile, “That Sir God Luo Sha lives here? Haha, it’s really a very remote location.”

“It’s indeed remote.” A cold and gloomy old man who was beside him laughed: “If Your Highness doesn’t know, Sir God Luo Sha is an unsociable and eccentric person. Ever since her husband died, she hid herself from the world and she did not have any contact with the outside world. Even within the Sanctuary Alliance, there is probably less than ten people who know where she lives. We have also spent a lot of effort and time to find this place.”

“Oh, is that so?” the handsome man raised the corners of his mouth and his smile became even more obvious.

If Jian Wushuang were present, he would definitely be extremely furious when he saw the handsome young man.

As he was the person who was with Leng Ruxue in the Blood Demon Church back then… His Highness Mu Hong!

Back then, when Jian Wushuang had been fighting with His Highness Mu Hong head-on, he had come across the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven abruptly. In the end, he was trampled on by His Highness Mu Hong.

“How are the abilities of Sir God Luo Sha?” His Highness Mu Hong questioned.

“She’s very strong. Out of the Sir Gods, she should be at the top level. However, with our lineup, it will be easy to kill her.” The cold and gloomy old man answered. “For our mission this time around, killing Sir God Luo Sha is secondary. The most important thing is that Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.”

“The Seventh Palace Master has instructed us that we must get the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning at all costs. Even if we are unable to get it, we absolutely have to destroy it. If not… when a great battle breaks out in the future, the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning will give too mant benefits to the Sanctuary Alliance!”

The cold and gloomy old man was certain about how impressive the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was.

A dying Emperor God could recover to his peak after being in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for three years. If Sir God Luo Sha were to use it without caring about anything else, the Power of Absolute Beginning that had accumulated in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning could absolutely provide many Almighties with Divine Power and also heal their injuries continuously.

“When the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning had just formed, the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance wanted to place it in the Thunderbolt Island. However, the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning had long been like a treasure of Sir God Luo Sha and it was completely under her control. Without her consent, even the Sanctuary Alliance was unable to snatch it away with force. As such, they could only discuss some conditions with her.”

“However, the condition that Sir God Luo Sha brought up was to kill Emperor God Ling Yun and destroy the Soaring Heaven King Palace. However, she was rejected by the Sanctuary Alliance. Therefore, in a fit of fury, Sir God Luo Sha brought the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning along with her and left the Sanctuary Alliance. Since then, she has kept herself hidden from the world and has not come out. As such, the Sanctuary Alliance cannot do anything to her.”

“However, it is fortunate that she possesses the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning as this has given us an opportunity. If it were in the Thunderbolt Island, there would be nothing that we could do,” the cold and gloomy old man laughed.

“Hmph, since the Sanctuary Alliance cannot control Sir God Luo Sha, we shall be the ones to do it.” His Highness Mu Hong laughed coldly, “Let’s charge in directly.”

With the order of His Highness Mu Hong, the ancient spaceship immediately charged forward into the black void, which was covered by a seal.

It also moved at a shocking speed and headed toward the center of the dark void where a floating land was.

Atop the piece of floating land, the expressions of Sir God Mad Dog and Sir God Luo Sha, who were originally having a conversation, changed abruptly!
