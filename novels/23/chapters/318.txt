Chapter 319: The Reunion of Brothers

The dreadful blast of wind ceased slowly soon after it erupted.

A secret chamber’s gate of Ditian Prefecture was opened abruptly, and a cold-faced young man who wore a blood-red saber on his back walked out slowly. Just after he walked out, he saw Jian Wushuang standing in front of him at the Martial Arts Practice Field, starring at him.

“Second brother, it’s been a long time since I saw you. Your arm has recovered!” Jian Wushuang scratched his nose, and couldn’t help but smile after seeing the repaired left arm of Yang Zaixuan.

“Third brother?”Meeting Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan was surprised at first but soon turned indifferent again, “I thought you were killed by Tan Feng.”

“A warrior like Tan Feng could never kill me.” Jian Wushuang said.

“So confident huh?” Yang Zaixuan looked at Jian Wushuang, “I suppose your strength has improved a lot in the last two years?”

“Why not give it a try?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. The two brothers looked at each other, and smiled.

Strangely, Yang Zaixuan’s figure disappeared from right where he stood, and when he appeared again, he was already right in front of Jian Wushuang. Meanwhile, the blood-red saber on his back chopped out silently, stirring up heaven and earth the moment it flew.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, and soon the Purple Sky Sword appeared in his hand, sweeping out a blast of sword light which also moved the entire heaven and earth.

Clang!

The saber and the sword clashed at each other, and instantly caused two huge cracks on the center ground of the Martial Arts Practice Field, both of which were over a hundred meters long. And then...SHUA! SHUA! SHUA! The figures of the two brothers flashed in the void simultaneously, along with the deafening sound of clashes.

In the Ditian Prefecture, Wine Master sat decorously in an attic, cooking wine. The wine jug and bowl were trembling slightly along with the loud sounds of clashes out there.

“Are the two boys trying to tear down my Ditian Prefecture?” Wine Master took a glimpse at the void outside, shaking his head and smiling, and then continued to cook his wine.

About an hour later, the huge sound of collisions that rang over the whole Ditian Prefecture and the two crazy powers that clashed against each other gradually subsided.

In the Martial Arts Practice Field, Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan sat there at ease.

“Your strength developed a lot after near two years. Wine Master said you can almost defeat Tan Feng after you finished your cultivation. I didn’t believe this at first, but now I think you do have the strength,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

“So do you,” Yang Zaixuan looked over to Jian Wushuang, “if I’m not wrong, you would have still hidden much of your real strength.”

“Ha-ha, you would not have used your full strength as well,” Jian Wushuang said.

The two men lay there at ease, talking and commenting on each other’s strength.

The battle that happened just now was only a simple spar after their reunion, so both of them held back their strength.

Especially for Jian Wushuang, because he hadn’t even demonstrated his Domain...

“Let’s go and have a drink,” Yang Zaixuan said.

“Don’t hurry, big brother Wang Yuan will be here in a few days. We can drink together when he arrives,” Jian Wushuang said.

“All right,” Yang Zaixuan nodded.

They two waited for Wang Yuan at the Ditian Prefecture. During this period, they still challenged each other frequently.

Although they reserved their strength, every battle they fought still caused a great commotion and scars on the ground.

Yang Zaixuan also heard from Wine Master that Jian Wushuang killed Tan Feng, and knew that right now Jian Wushuang’s strength should be more powerful than his.

He fought with Tan Feng before, so he knew that even now he could barely compete with Tan Feng using his full strength. However, Jian Wushuang could kill Tan Feng, so Jian Wushuang’s battle strength must be superior to his.

Jian Wushuang also had a general understanding of Yang Zaixuan’s strength.

“A Predestined Warrior!”

That was Jian Wushuang’s commentary to Yang Zaixuan.

With real strength reserved, Yang Zaixuan’s battle strength was at best equal to a normal expert of the Saint Realm, but once he used his full energy to demonstrate High Heaven Technique, his strength would rise up to a brand new level with the heaven breath’s blessing, and surely could confront with those experts that mastered the Second Domain like Tan Feng.

Two days later, when Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were exchanging their thoughts and experiences on the Martial Arts Practice Field, a huge figure stepped across the courtyard and ran in. Just after entering the Martial Arts Practice Field, his hearty laughter sounded out.

“Ha-ha, second brother, third brother, it’s been a long time since I saw you! I missed you guys so much,” Wang Yuan rushed to Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.

“Big brother,” Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan stood up, with a hint of smile on their faces.

Wang Yuan ran over to them, and gave both Yang Zaixuan and Jian Wushuang a big hug.

“Second brother, how does your repaired arm feel?” Wang Yuan looked at Yang Zaixuan and asked.

“Not bad,” Yang Zaixuan moved his left arm.

His left arm was had been cut off. Later Wine Master obtained a Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir from Alchemy School and repaired his arm with it. The repaired arm was almost the exact same as the original one.

“Third brother,” Wang Yuan looked over to Jian Wushuang, ” one month ago, I heard that you were killed by a man named Tan Feng, and he took your body to the Holy Emperor Palace for a reward. I didn’t believe it at that time. I would never believe that you would die so easily. Looks like I’m right.”

“Ha, it was just a cover,” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Tan Feng has already been killed by me.”

“Oh?” Wang Yuan’s expression changed, “I heard that Tan Feng was an expert of the Saint Realm with great strength, and even mastered Domain. You could kill him, my brother? Gee, that’s awesome.”

Jian Wushuang shrugged casually,” well, we can hardly get together, so we must have a drink today.”

“I was going to drink with third brother before, but he said we need to wait for you to drink together. ” Yang Zaixuan said.

“I’m afraid we don’t have time to drink,” Wang Yuan shook his head, and his face stiffened, “the reason why I came here today is to discuss something really urgent with you and Wine Master. It is better since third brother is also here.”

“What is the matter?” Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan looked at Wang Yuan immediately.

“It is about little sister,” Wang Yuan said with a low voice.

“Little sister?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold immediately.

When he was still in Tianzong Dynasty, Jian Wushuang had heard from Wang Yuan that Su Rou was in a very special position in Ice Nether Valley. The Master behind her might do something harmful to her. Jian Wushuang was very concerned about it.

But at that time his strength was too weak and he was not certain whether Master would be against little sister, so he could do nothing but let Wang Yuan take care of Su Rou.

Now, since Wang Yuan came to them for Su Rou, something must have happened to her.

“Not long ago, Ye Chen, the Master of Ice Nether Valley, sent invitations to all the powerful forces in Nanyang Continent...Ten days later, he and little sister will hold their wedding ceremony in Ice Nether Valley!”
