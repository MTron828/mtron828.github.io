Chapter 2607: Stars of the Auction

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the individual room...

“Sir, here are the first four stages of the Transmigration Sword Formation, the golden rock, and also the Primordial Stones for the items you’ve sold after deducting our commission. It’s all here, please check carefully.” A Black Chief passed an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang took the ring, he took a quick look and nodded slightly.

The items he had sold in Star Picking Pavilion including the Spiritual Stone Staff had made him a total of 12,120,000 Primordial Stones. There were close to 75,000,000 Primordial Stones in the Interspatial Ring after deducting the 45,000,000 Primordial Stones for the four stages of sword formation, the golden rock, and commissions paid.

He was also in possession of a Divine Elixir Pill and various cultivation materials that amounted to 25,000,000 Primordial Stones.

In other words, Jian Wushuang had exactly 100,000,000 Primordial Stones!!

“I’m hoping that the one hundred million Primordial Stones is enough to help me purchase the Stately Painting,” mumbled Jian Wushuang to himself.

The auction continued.

However, the items that were displayed thereafter did not motivate Jian Wushuang to bid despite there were quite many valuable ones that caught the Heavenly Ultimate Gods’ attention who competed for them.

Time flew by and the auction had gone on for a full three days.

Many treasures had been sold in those three days, but the enthusiasm of those experts taking part in the auction did not even decrease.

However, Jian Wushuang began to feel uneasy as time went by.

“It’s been three days, but the Stately Painting’s bidding still hasn’t started. Could it be...” Jian Wushuang thought of a possibility that made him feel very uneasy.

At that moment, the Golden Chief cleared his throat on the display stage and spoke with his incredibly resonant voice, “Honored guests, this auction has come to its finale. The next items are the three star-treasures of this auction!!”

His words immediately lit up the enthusiasm in the house.

Many experts had their eyes burning with desire.

“Stars of the auction, it’s finally starting?”

“The three most valuable items featured are finally going to be auctioned.”

“Tsk tsk, I wonder what are the differences between these three items”

The experts were incredibly curious.

Even Heavenly Ultimate Gods on the third floor, the experts from Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan evidently became very serious before straightening their sitting posture.

Usual treasures could hardly catch the attention of those top powers of the Danyang Holy Domain. As an example, very few of the many treasures being auctioned earlier could spark their interests and make them bid for it.

However, the last three items were a different story.

The three stars of the auction even sparked some curiosity in them.

Contrary to the general emotions, Jian Wushuang sat in the individual room with a terribly gloomy face.

“What I fear most has happened!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists as his gaze turned frosty.

Earlier on, he caught words from the Black Chief that the Stately Painting would be auctioned in the event. As for when it would be auctioned, the Black Chief did not tell him due to the Star Picking Pavilion’s rules, hence Jian Wushuang had no idea either.

However, as the auction reached its finale, only three treasures were left and since the Stately Painting had not appeared, it was clearly part of the three stars of the auction!!

Stars of the auction. What did ‘star’ mean? Naturally, they would be the most valuable items and would receive the highest bids in the auction.

For the Star Picking Pavilion to consider the Stately Painting a star of the auction, its final bid would be very high. Moreover, the Heavenly Ultimate Gods on the third floor and the experts from powerful clans would surely notice that treasure. They most probably would stand up and compete for it.

Trying to outbid those powerful clans... Jian Wushuang was truly not confident at all with that little bit of wealth he possessed.

“Let’s see. I’ll have to think of other ways if it’s not going to work.” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

On the display stage.

“Honored guests, we’ll now begin the auctioning of the first star!

“Please take a look.”

The Golden Chief waved his hand as an ancient scroll painting that was turning yellow immediately appeared on the display stage.

The scroll painting looked ordinary at a glance with nothing fascinating about it such that nobody probably would lay their eyes on it even if they saw it on the streets.

However, none of the part-takers in this auction were ordinary people. Naturally, they could notice the unusual qualities of the scroll painting.

Its extraordinary qualities originated from its energy—so ancient and mysterious that no one could figure it out!!

Everyone was staring at the scroll painting but they felt as though they were staring into thin air or a shroud of mist. It was truly a strange feeling.

“Treasure. This is absolutely a unique and extraordinary treasure!”

Right away, the experts in the auction passed their judgments.

Although they could not tell what the scroll painting was, they were certain it was an incredible treasure.

While in the individual room, Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted immediately the moment he saw the painting. His body uncontrollably shook.

Nobody else could identify the scroll painting, but he could with just a glance.

That scroll painting had accompanied him for a long period of time. It even helped him out of limbo time and again—the Stately Painting!!

It was his ultimate treasure!!!

Even till then, he could still feel a connection with the Stately Painting in its current situation. The sense of connection was still very strong. Were it not for the restrictive shield around the edges of the display stage blocking his energy projection, he could have immediately reconnected with the Stately Painting and it would most certainly become excited.

“My old brother, we finally met again!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, his nails buried into his flesh. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I take that all of you have recognized the extraordinary quality of this scroll painting. If that’s the case, please let me make an introduction.” The Golden Chief’s voice resonated in the auction house.

“This item is called ‘Stately Painting’ and was passed to the Star Picking Pavilion by a Territorial Lord of a stellar region in Danyang Holy Domain. According to the Territorial Lord, the origin of this treasure is extremely mysterious. It did not originate from any ruin nor did it come from any expert’s offspring. Instead, it was taken out of a shattered void while a pair of Ultimate Gods were fighting.”

The experts in the auction were rather shocked upon hearing his words.

The void shattered and the treasure appeared in that shattered void?

Was the treasure really that mysterious?
