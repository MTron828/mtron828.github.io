Chapter 1108: An Order!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?” Jian Wushuang asked.

His expression changed the instant he read the message.

Coordinates to a zone on the battlefield were included the message, as well as an order!

The order was personally sent by Void Temple Master, one of the five Green Fire Palace Masters. He wanted all experts wandering in the battlefield to proceed with utmost urgency to the zone. Those too far away from the given coordinates were exempted, but those that were near had to rush over immediately.

“What caused Void Temple Master to send out such an order?”?thought Jian Wushuang, still feeling surprised. He then immediately took out the map to the battlefield again.

“The coordinates sent by the Temple Master are over here.”

Very quickly, Jian Wushuang had located the zone which Void Temple Master wanted the experts to proceed to; it was also in uncharted territory.

“This zone is not too far away from me, and I can reach there in a month at my current speed,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

One month’s journey was considered short in the boundless battlefield.

“Let’s set off quickly!”

Originally, Jian Wushuang had planned to remain at Chillywind Valley for a while more to see if more Ancient God Power or perhaps even other treasures would come out from the sinkhole, but he dared not delay carrying out Void Temple Master’s order and set off immediately.

His wounds had healed a long time ago, during the 10 days he spent observing the gales. Naturally, his speed was extremely fast.

At the same moment he received the message, many other Green Fire Palace experts also received the same order.

“Void Temple Master sent out this order personally to us? What’s so urgent? Something big must have happened in this zone!”

“Could it be the discovery of a new Secret Land? Or perhaps a big opportunity?”

“Something big must have happened. It’s a pity that the zone is far from where I am—way too far, to be exact. Even if I put everything down now and rush there at maximum speed, I’ll need at least a few centuries’ time to reach there. The incident must have long blown over by then!”

“It’s too far away. I can’t do anything as I couldn’t possibly make it in time to help.”

Those experts that were currently extremely far away from the zone were surprised to receive the order, but all of them ended up shaking their heads helplessly.

The zone was too far away for them, and these experts would need centuries to arrive there. Furthermore, one had to factor in the potential dangers that they would be faced with. Evidently, there was no way they could make it in time to provide assistance.

The other experts that were already nearby or even not too far away from the zone immediately made their way there.

“There must be some huge opportunity that showed itself. Otherwise, the Temple Master would not have asked so many of us to go to the zone. That said, nobody knows what sort of opportunity it would be. I’m so looking forward to knowing what it is.”

“Let’s go, let’s move immediately. The opportunity may have already been seized by others by the time we get there.”

Many Celestial Masters from the Green Fire Temple were rushing over to the zone at top speed.

At the same time, something was happening in the Void far away from the zone.

An indifferent looking man who was carrying a longsword on his back was bashing his way through all the obstacles in his path, as if he had turned into a sharp sword himself. He was just a Celestial Master, but the speed which he was traveling at was far beyond the capabilities of his peers.

The man was Sunrise Sword Emperor.

He was also advancing at maximum speed toward the zone.

Two figures were waiting quietly at a vast wasteland, and not before long, a black spot appeared at the limits of their lines of sight.

“He’s here,” said the short hunchbacked elder, a smile appearing on his face.

The black spot gradually grew bigger, and a figure appeared before them shortly after.

“We meet again, Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long,” greeted Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“How have you been, Jian Wushuang my young friend?” asked the Celestial Masters as they smiled too.

Although they had gone their separate ways, all three of them were wandering around the same area and they were not far away from each other. Naturally, they would meet again after receiving the Temple Master’s message. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I believe the two of you are also going to the zone?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Do you know the reason why we’re told to go there?” he continued asking.

The Celestial Masters shook their heads.

“Even though I don’t know what the call is all about, but I’ve been in the Green Fire Palace for so long and haven’t received many messages of this nature. I believe that something big must have happened in that zone,” replied Celestial Master Yi solemnly.

“If that’s the case, let’s not dally around any longer. We should set off immediately.”

Without waiting any longer, Jian Wushuang joined the Celestial Masters in their journey toward the zone.

They arrived at their destination one month later.

Only after arriving did they realize that the zone was actually made up of an endless chain of mountains, and there were many towering mountain ranges in it.

“I’ve never been to this place before. Let’s be extra careful,” said Celestial Master Yi.

“Right,” nodded Jian Wushuang gently. Suddenly, he sensed something.

At the same time, this case happened to the two Celestial Masters as well.

They could sense the presence of an expert from the Green Fire Palace from their tokens, and apparently, the expert was moving at an alarming pace.

“Seems like he or she is fleeing?” asked Celestial Master Yi with a frown.

“He or she could be fleeing or chasing after an enemy—another expert from the Jin Kingdom, for example. Let’s go to get a closer look for ourselves,” said Jian Wushuang.

The three of them immediately hurried off to their comrade’s location.

The expert had also seemed to sense their presence through his or her token; he was changing direction and moving toward them now.

After a while, they saw the expert.

“It’s Celestial Master Jin Qu!” said Celestial Master Yi emotionally.

“Just by himself?” exclaimed Celestial Master Meng Long, similarly emotional.

Celestial Master Jin Qu was a medium Celestial Master of the Green Fire Palace and considered as weaker compared to his peers. As such, under normal circumstances, he would be traveling with companions in uncharted territory.

Now, however, he was by himself.

Not only was he traveling alone, but his aura was also extremely weak and his complexion very pale. Evidently, he was also wounded seriously and two figures in gold armor were chasing after him.

“The Jin Kingdom!”

“It’s experts from the Jin Kingdom!”

The eyes of the Celestial Masters glinted as they noticed the figures in gold armor as their killing intents surged.

“Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang growled as the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand. He took a huge step forward, moving toward Celestial Master Jin Qu before the others.

Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long followed closely behind
