“Stop, stop it!!”

The Emperor God started shouting at him.

The others quickly responded as well.

“Jian Wushuang, stop. Stop it!”

“Sword Emperor, don’t act on impulse. We can discuss this!!”

“Jian Wushuang, what are you trying to do? Don’t forget that Green Fire World is on this ancient battlefield too!!”

Many started bellowing in anger while there were angry gazes on Jian Wushuang as well.

In their anger, there was a faint tinge of fear!

The power of the spacetime storm was too terrifying.

“Why? Do you know how to be afraid now?” Jian Wushuang sneered but the spacetime storm didn’t stop and became even more violent.

The extermination aura from the void above and the surrounding became more intense. There were many experts at the scene who were shivering with fear because of the extermination aura.

Jian Wushuang’s malicious laughter continued to reverberate.

“Actually, I didn’t want to use this trump card. But it’s a pity that you all are such bullies!!!”

“You really think I am just a softie from Green Fire World? That everyone could pressure me as they wish?!”

“So what if you are Sanctuary Alliance? So what if there are unique tribes? Even if the entire Eternal Chaotic World’s forces and Great Emperors gather here, so what?”

“Green Fire World is my hometown! Whoever dares to lay a finger on it, I will kill him!!!”

“You want the countless cultivators in Green Fire World to relocate and leave Green Fire World, I, Jian Wushuang, am the first to disagree. The billions of cultivators in Green Fire World absolutely wouldn’t agree as well. The ancestral experts from Green Fire World that died would be even more against that idea!!!”

“We of Green Fire World would rather become ashes with the ancient battlefield. We strive to fight a life-and-death battle. Until the very last person dies, until the very last drop of blood is shed, we will never give in!!!”

“Come on. If you have guts, come on in!”

His voice was like thunder, reverberated in the universe.

Behind Jian Wushuang, in Green Fire World, large number of cultivators stood together as Jian Wushuang’s hysterical laughter resounded in their ears.

At that very moment, they clenched their hands together as hopelessness filled their eyes. They were roaring from the bottom of their hearts.

They were born in Green Fire World!

It was where their roots were!

Countless ancestral experts saved Green Fire World for them!

Forget about the further history, merely tens of thousands years ago, when the troops of Jin Kingdom came, Green Fire World relied on themselves. Countless cultivators had advanced wave by wave and sacrificed countless experts. In the end, under Jian Wushuang’s lead, they had won and survived.

Then, Green Fire World’s potential was gradually unearthed and growing to prosperity.;

There were experts in Green Fire World who had put in painstaking effort, especially their leader, Jian Wushuang.

Then, the so-called experts from Eternal Chaotic World wanted to take away their hometown and chase them to other territories? To make them leave their homes?

They swore to not yield!!!

“Fight! Fight! Fight!”

“All of us are willing to following Wushuang City Master to fight a life-and-death battle!!”

“Until the very last person, until the very last drop of blood!!”

“We will never give in!!!”

“At worst, we will all meet death together!!”

There were angry roars with unprecedented determination and will that resounded across the sky.

Although the countless cultivators in Green Fire World were nothing before the experts from Eternal Chaotic World, they were willing to fight to the death!

There was soaring war intention that shook heaven and earth.

At the far front of Green Fire World, countless experts from Eternal Chaotic World gathered there. That very moment, the experts exchanged a look and became quiet.

They could feel Green Fire World’s war intention and their determination.

Most importantly, it was their determination. Their determination to live or die alongside Green Fire World.

It was obvious that Green Fire World wanted to fight till the end of the world with them.

The crucial thing was that they had the capital to meet death together. Once the spacetime storm power exploded, everything would vanish into thin air. Maybe the few Great Emperors who were powerful could survive in the spacetime storm with their fierce power but no doubt, the others would all die.

The ancient battlefield would vanish into thin air too.

“What should we do?”

Abysmal Saint Master, Colored Glaze Great Emperor, Great Emperor Zi Xu, Yan Zun and the other Great Emperors from the other three peak unique tribe gathered.

Although the Great Emperors were powerful, they felt helpless then.

They were helpless towards the spacetime storm.

“D*mn it. I wonder who was the one who set up such a terrifying grand formation in the void surrounding this ancient battlefield. Most importantly, the grand formation is in the hands of Green Fire World,” Abysmal Saint Master said in a low voice.

Then, spacetime storm had yet to stop and it grew stronger. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

There was no one who didn’t feel fearful of the spacetime storm.

With the threat of spacetime storm and Green Fire World. who viewed death as an option, many of them were thinking of retreating.

However, they were unwilling to just leave like that.

Just as the experts were caught in a fix, in the nearby void, a figure in grey robe walked over slowly.

With white hair and white eyes, his skin was as terrifyingly fair.

He was a man but he had a beautiful appearance that put all ladies in Eternal Chaotic World to shame.

Once he had appeared, everyone at the scene quietened down.

Countless gazes turned to him.

“Emperor Bai!!”

“That’s great. Mister Emperor Bai came personally!”

“The strongest one, Emperor Bai?”

Countless experts at the scene were surprised.

Jian Wushuang looked at the incomer too.

“He’s finally here?”

Jian Wushuang muttered. He sent a message to Emperor Bai long ago but Emperor Bai didn’t reply. Just then, when both parties were in a stalemate, Mister Emperor Bai finally appeared.

Jian Wushuang had a good opinion of him.

However, his good opinion aside, Green Fire World had such great potential and Emperor Bai was widely acknowledged as the leader, the strongest one. Jian Wushuang couldn’t be certain on which side Emperor Bai would take.

Emperor Bai appeared and first looked the pearl in Jian Wushuang’s hand. Through the pearl, he saw the changes in the surrounding ancient battlefield and his face grew solemn.

“Jian Wushuang, slow down the formation first,”Emperor Bai said.

Then, everyone looked at Jian Wushuang.

The great formation was still spinning and the extermination aura grew stronger over time. It was just like a knife above everyone’s head.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and looked at Emperor Bai solemnly. He moved his willpower and the grand formation stopped.

The void surrounding the ancient battlefield, including the spacetime storm, gradually slowed down.
