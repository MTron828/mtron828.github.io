Chapter 82: Meeting with Ye Rufeng Again

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“My brothers, what is your task?”

Wang Yuan immediately came close as soon as Palace Master White left.

“Damn it, Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard?” Wang Yuan screamed after he saw Jian Wushuang’s task, “Dragon Palace is so cruel, they made you complete the task of a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard when you are just a warrior of Spiritual Sea.”

Jian Wushuang smiled awkwardly.

There had always been a huge risk in Golden-dragon Guard’s mission.

Normally, One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard missions were completed by a warrior reaching the peak of Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, while Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard missions would be finished by Primordial Gold Core, the peak of Initial Gold Core Realm or even the Profound Gold Core Realm.

It was a joke that a Spiritual Sea Realm was even sent to complete a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard mission.

.Jian Wushuang, however, was totally different from other ordinary warriors because he was a disciple of Dragon Palace. He showed how outstanding he was by beating Nangong Jie of Profound Gold Core Realm.

“It seems ridiculous to ask a warrior of Level of Spiritual Sea to achieve that, but actually, it is not too difficult for me. The real arduous one, I thought, was at the second and the third stage because I don’t even know what they are.” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

He was more curious about the tasks at the last two stages. He had scrolls in his hands, but he did not open them in a hurry.

“Brother, your first stage mission was simple,” said Jian Wushuang when he had a glance at the scroll inYang Zaixuan’s hands.

Yang Zaixuan’s first mission was to kill a warrior of Profound Gold Core Realm who could be killed easily by him, although the warrior was good.

“When do you plan to set off?” said Yang Zaixuan.

“I am going to visit Secret Pavilion and then leave directly. What about you?” said Jian Wushuang.

“I will go now.” answered Yang Zaixuan.

“Good luck.” said Jian Wushuang and left for Secret Pavilion immediately.

With lots of points, he purchased as many Elixir Pills as possible.

First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill was worth twenty points, and he surprisingly spent one thousand points buying fifty.

He had no alternative. Other people may reach the peak of Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm from Initial Spiritual Sea Realm with the use of ten pills. Jian Wushuang, however, was different, because he needed too much Spiritual Power to support his Ultimate Spiritual Sea. It was questionable whether he would be able to reach Stage Three from Stage Two of Ultimate Spirit Sea.

What’s more, he also spent 1,200 points buying pills for treatment.

After his preparation, he set off.

…

The Innumerable Huge Mountains contained hundreds of mountains. The vast space and dangers in it were on another level compared to the Dark Forest.

Moon Heart City was located at the foot of Great Mountains.

Whoosh! A huge figure dived sharply in the vast place outside the city.

That was a big Spiritual Beast, Griffin, with huge wings carrying a man on its back.

Jian Wushuang directly jumped off its back and said “Thank you” to Golden-armored Sergent.

Nodded with a smile, the sergeant left riding the griffin.

As the city was very far away from Dragon Palace, it could take him over half a month. But now he just spent less than half a day by taking the beast.

Of course, he paid 100 points for that.

After entering the city, Jian Wushuang went straight to the crowded and noisy Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.

When he came to the counter, an old man behind the counter asked, “Can I help you?”

Jian Wushuang took out the pledge as a Disciple of Dragon Palace, which surprised the man. The man immediately said, “Master, this way please.”

Saying that, the man led him to the cellar.

There was a man there who seemed cold. By coincidence he knew Jian Wushuang.

“Your Excellency Ye.” said Jian Wushuang with surprise.

“Swordsman? I didn’t expect that you were here.” said the cold man with a smile when he saw Jian Wushuang.

The man’s name was Ye Rufeng, the Golden Dragon Ambassador, who had actually brought him to Dragon Palace.

“His Excellency, you know each other?” said the old man in confusion.

“We can handle this, you can go.” said Ye Rufeng.

“Yes, Your Excellency.” the elder immediately retreated.

“Haha, nice to see you again, brother.” said Ye Rufeng with a big laugh.

“What a coincidence!” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Come on and have a seat.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After sitting on chairs in the cellar, Ye Rufeng asked, “Brother, you were supposed to cultivate in the palace. Why did you come here? Did you get mission?”

As a Golden Dragon Ambassador of Golden-dragon Palace, Ye Rufeng knew about the Dragon Palace and understood that their disciples often received assignments from it.

“I am on my mission as a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard and the destination was Innumerable Huge Mountains.” Jian Wushuang said.

“What? You are here for a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard mission?” Ye Rufeng asked in shock.

“Yes, what’s wrong?” asked Jian Wushuang with confusion and he did not know why Ye Rufeng overreacted.

“Haha, that’s great, to tell you the truth, we actually were going to ask you to do us a favor.” said Ye Rufeng with a joy.

“What is that?” asked Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

He could enter the Palace just because of Ye Rufeng’s recommendation and he owed him. So Jian Wushuang would not decline it if it was not to the death.

“Follow me.” said Ye Rufeng and took him to another hidden cellar of the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.

There was a girl in purple practicing swordsmanship.

Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew!

The sword shadow was actually not bad.

“She is…?” asked Jian Wushuang looking at the girl.

Although the girl was young, she, with exquisite swordsmanship, reached level of Primordial Gold Core. What most impressed people was that the girl unexpectedly comprehended the level of Waterdrop Essence, although she was not yet high in it.
