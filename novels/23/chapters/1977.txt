As the extermination aura from the surrounding void slowly dispersed, the experts at the scene gradually let out a breath of relief.

Emperor Bai looked around and said in a great voice, “I already know what happened. If both parties continued to fight, it is definitely a fight with a risk of mutual destruction. I believe that there shouldn’t be anyone who wish to see such a situation. So, why don’t we both sit down and discuss this.”

Then, Emperor Bai glanced at Sanctuary Alliance and Great Emperors from the three special tribe.

The Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance naturally didn’t dare to go against Emperor Bai’s order. As for the Great Emperors’ from the three special tribe, they nodded faintly too.

They also knew that it wasn’t the way to continue in a stalemate situation.

“Jian Wushuang, how about you?” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodedd.

If it wasn’t necessary, he, of course, wouldn’t wish to really use the killer move to meet death together with the experts from Eternal Chaotic World.

“That’s great.”

Emperor Bai waved there was a lofty palace that appeared from nowhere. There were layers of prohibition over the palace.

“Come on in,” Emperor Bai’s voice reverberated while he entered the palace first.

Sanctuary Alliance and the Great Emperors from the three special tribes entered the palace one after another.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and entered the palace as well. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

...

In the lofty hall, there were thrones towering.

At the bottom half of the palace, there were dozens of thrones. The ruler of the bigger forces in Eternal Chaotic World sat there, including Emperor God Tian Ling from Soaring Heaven King Palace, Number One Divine King from Divine King Island. The peak Emperor Gods were gathered there.

Of course, these Emperor Gods, including Emperor God Tian Ling himself, were sure that they were only audience in the hall but had no right to speak.

Those who had the right to speak were the Great Emperors who were seated on the upper half of the hall.

Vroom!!!

There were shadows that substantiated one after another. Besides the Great Emperors who came from outside of Green Fire World, those who didn’t come personally, their consciousness incarnation were there.

The fifteen Great Emperors on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list were there.

The Great Emperors from special tribes were all there too.

The most eye-catching thing was that the Great Emperors were all seated on the left side of the hall.

On the right side of the hall, it obviously belonged to another camp. The camp was naturally led by Jian Wushuang. Next to him, there was Lord Spirit Sound, King Luo Yu and Jian Yi.

Compared to the other camp, Jian Wushuang was really much weaker. However, with the existence of spacetime storm, Jian Wushuang had great power too.

As for Emperor Bai, he was seated in between both parties.

“Let’s begin.”

Emperor Bai said softly then he became silent. He even closed his eyes faintly. He obviously didn’t intend to be biased.

He had been aloof to begin with. He was always high and above. Although he was widely acknowledged as the strongest in Sanctuary Alliance, he was almost never involved in any matter in Sanctuary Alliance.

An elder in a simple grey robe stood up.

The grey-robed elder first bowed politely at Emperor Bai then at other Great Emperors. Then, he looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Sword Emperor, I am Tian Chen.”

“Ancestor Tian Chen,” Jian Wushuang greeted politely too.

Ancestor Tian Chen was in fourth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, which was right behind Abysmal Saint Master.

Most of the matters in Sanctuary Alliance for all these years were taken care of by Ancestor Tian Chen and East Royal Emperor.

Besides, Jian Wushuang also knew that Ancestor Tian Chen was a Great Emperor who had a good opinion of him and anticipated for him to grow stronger when he had risen abruptly back then.

Hence, Jian Wushuang revered Ancestor Tian Chen.

“I believe Sword Emperor knows that I have always had high hopes for your growth. I am certain that Sword Emperor will definitely be one of the greatest fighting powers in Sanctuary Alliance in the future. The truth is as such too,” Ancestor Tian Chen first gave him compliments, then he said, “However, Green Fire World is unusual!”

“Its value and potential is too great. For Sanctuary Alliance, it would be of great help. Sword Emperor, you are also a member of Sanctuary Alliance. So, I wish Sword Emperor, you could consider on Sanctuary Alliance’s behalf, Sanctuary Alliance would definitely remember your contribution.”

Jian Wushuang grew in distress.

“Ancestor Tian Chen, I am really a member of Sanctuary Alliance but Sanctuary Alliance is an alliance that is free without restriction. Your goal is to fight against the two dark forces and those underlying dangers. What I could do is to help when Sanctuary Alliance is in trouble.”

“To put it in an indecent way, Sanctuary Alliance is nothing much to me. However, Green Fire World is different!”

“It is my root!”

“You want me to abandon my hometown for Sanctuary Alliance? That’d be a joke. Even if I agreed, a billion cultivators in Green Fire World wouldn’t.

Jian Wushuang looked determined and his voice was extremely cold too.

“Sword Emperor, is there really no space for negotiation?” Ancestor Tian Chen frowned.

“Of course there is. Otherwise, I wouldn’t sit here and talk to you,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice, “However, to get the space from me, you have to show your sincerity. You want the countless cultivators in Green Fire World to relocate and hand over Green Fire World? That’s impossible. Don’t even think about it!”

“I wonder what Sword Emperor would like?” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Very simple. I’d let the value of Green Fire World to be put to play in Sanctuary Alliance but I have a few conditions, “Jian Wushuang said.

“What conditions?” Ancestor Tian Chen and the experts looked at Jian Wushuang with full anticipation.

“The first condition is that Almighties to Real Gods in Eternal Chaotic World absolutely can’t step foot in Green Fire World,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

However, just as his condition was brought up...

“Impossible!!!”

There was a Great Emperor that slammed the table and stood up from Sanctuary Alliance’s side while there were many glares from the experts too.

“Jian Wushuang, you want Sanctuary Alliance to show sincerity and that is your attitude?” Ancestor Tian Chen stared at Jian Wushuang as his face grew grave.

Almighties to Real Gods couldn’t enter Green Fire World. In other words, only cultivators of Universe Gods level and below could enter. What was the difference from that to no one being able to enter?

That was Jian Wushuang’s sincerity?

“Don’t be in a hurry. Listen to me.”

Jian Wushuang looked around with a cold look.

Although the experts were raging with anger, they suppressed their anger to listen to Jian Wushuang’s explanation.

“Actually, all of you misunderstood Green Fire World’s value,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “All of you thought Green Fire World’s value was its unprecedented cultivation environment that was filled with intense spiritual influence of heaven and earth. You wanted to make Green Fire World into a sanctuary that surpassed Thunderbolt Island. But it actually wasted all Green Fire World’s resources.”
