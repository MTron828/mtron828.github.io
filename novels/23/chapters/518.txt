Chapter 519: Falling Out with Jian Wushuang

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He really came for the Jade Slip.”

Jian Wushuang sneered secretly. He had guessed that this was what Jin Ling had come for secretly.

“It’s an honor that Emperor Fengxiao gave the Jade Slip to me. How can I let him down by selling it?” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s not true.” Jin Ling said, “To keep his kindness in mind is more important than the Jade Slip itself.”

After a pause, Jin Ling continued saying, “Brother Wushuang, the Jade Slip is useless to you but useful to me, I hope you can do me a favor!”

He said this with sincerity.

He thought that Jian Wushuang did not know the Jade Slip’s value.

Because he had learnt in the Saint Castle that Jian Wushuang had come from an ordinary tribe and that there was nothing special about his background.

He had also never been to the Holy Place before. It was highly possible that he knew nothing about the Jade Slip.

Therefore, it was possible for him to trick Jian Wushuang out of the Jade Slip as long as Jian Wushuang did not know its value.

Jin Ling was right. Jian Wushuang really knew nothing about the Jade Slip. He didn’t even have the chance to ask Qing Huo. However, there was one thing that Jin Ling didn’t expect. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang was not stupid!

He was not an ignorant bumpkin who was naive and unaware of things.

Step by step, he had experienced many crises and troubles. How could he be foolish like Jin Ling.

He must be kidding himself in expecting to get the Jade Slip from Jian Wushuang with just a few words.

Jian Wushuang threw an Interspatial Ring at Jin Ling and said coldly, “The treasures in the Interspatial Ring are worth eight million Raw Gems. This should cover the cost of the Blood Kylin Leather Armor. Stop trying to get the Jade Slip.”

“Brother Wushuang.” Jin Ling was anxious.

“Qing Huo, let’s go.” Jian Wushuang did not spare a second glance for Jin Ling and walked off with Qing Huo outside the Heaven Wing Pavilion.

Gazing at Jian Wushuang’s back, Jin Ling’s hopeful, nervous and anxious eyes became cold with rising hatred and killing intent.

Finally as Jian Wushuang stepped out of the gate, Jin Ling’s hatred exploded.

“Stop!”

Swish!

Jin Ling rushed out like a Flowing Light.

Right after Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo stepped out of the Heaven Wing Pavilion and moved onto the street, they heard a sharp crackling sound from behind, then a distorted figure passed by and stopped in front of them.

Seeing Jin Ling who stood in front of him with a distorted face, Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Is he so easy to irritate?” Jian Wushuang sneered and said, “Jin Ling, what do you want?”

“What do I want?” Jin Ling stared at Jian Wushuang like a poisonous snake, “Jian Wushuang, you better sell it to me. Otherwise...”

“Otherwise? What?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold immediately.

He had politely called him “Brother Wushuang” in the Heaven Wing Pavilion. But now... his face had changed so quickly.

“What? You want to force us?” Qing Huo sneered at Jin Ling too. Though he didn’t know what Emperor Fengxiao had given to Jian Wushuang, he knew what Jin Ling had done.

Jin Ling didn’t answer him. But his eyes were full of killing intent.

“Do you want to fight? Don’t forget you are in Heaven Wing City.” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Haha, look, someone wants to fight here.” Qing Huo shouted. Hearing his words, many people on the street gathered around them, so did the guards of Heaven Wing City who arrived at the first time.

“Three Divine Generals?”

The guards were also under the command of the Monster-exterminating League and most of them were Divine Generals. Therefore they perceived the aura of their Divine General tokens.

“Sirs, you should know the rules of Heaven Wing City. If you fight here...” The leading guard frowned, gazing at the trio.

“Don’t look at us, it’s him.” Qing Huo pointed at Jin Ling and said coldly, “We just walked out of the Heaven Wing Pavilion. This man wanted a treasure belonging to my friend and is forcing my friend to sell it to him. We refused, so he blocked our way.”

“Oh?” The guards looked towards Jin Ling.

People around were all watching Jin Ling and whispering.

“Such bad behavior!”

“Hehe, the Heaven Wing City is one of the Eight Cities, no one is allowed to act like that.”

“What treasure is this? Even causing a Divine General to act like that?”

Jin Ling, while being stared at, became sullen and his eyes were cold as ice. Looking at Jian Wushuang, he said, “Jian Wushuang, there is one thing you should know.”

“My name is Jin Ling!”

“My father is Emperor Golden Snake!”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang did nothing, but Qing Huo suddenly narrowed his eyes.

A noise arose from the crowd.

Apparently they all knew Emperor Golden Snake.

The faces of those guards also changed.

“Jian Wushuang, you should know what I mean.” Jin Ling sneered.

The people around looked queer.

Threats!

An unscrupulous but real threat.

Many looked at Jian Wushuang with pity in their eyes.

Emperor Golden Snake was one of the 108 Divine Emperors. How could any human without a special background dare to irritate him?

“Compromise with him.”

“Sell it to him. Maybe you will suffer a loss, but it’s better than offending Emperor Golden Snake.”

“He is unlucky to have troubled Emperor Golden Snake’s son. I heard that Emperor Golden Snake always defends his son .”

People around were discussing and many advised Jian Wushuang to compromise by selling the Jade Slip to Jin Ling.

“Fellow Wushuang,” Qing Huo frowned and looked at Jian Wushuang, but he didn’t say any more.

Jian Wushuang stood in the center of the crowd with hands behind his back. Jin Ling haughtily stared at Jian Wushuang.

All of them were waiting for Jian Wushuang’s answer. Suddenly Jian Wushuang raised his head and asked with confusion, “I’m sorry, who is Emperor Golden Snake? I don’t know him!”
