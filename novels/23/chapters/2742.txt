Chapter 2743: Jian Wushuang Versus Saber Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

No matter if it was to get rid of a large faction in the Crimson Stone Fort to create an opportunity for Yin Su’er or so he could gain the most benefits during that trip to the secret realm, Jian Wushuang would not let go of that once in a lifetime opportunity.

“Saber Master, make your move.” Jian Wushuang smiled as his facial expression turned cold.

Saber Master also had an extremely cold expression. His killing intent slightly rose in the eyes as he looked toward Jian Wushuang.

Boom!!

Overpowering divine aura surged as Saber Master attacked in a domineering way as the crimson battle saber in his hand unleashed its strong power.

Jian Wushuang smirked as he slowly stretched out his hand and pressed downward in Saber Master’s direction.

“Domain Suppression!!”

Boom~~~

A total of three huge domains was unleashed at the same time.

The Star Armor Domain, Prison of Punishment, and Jian Wushuang’s Sword World brought humongous suppression to Saber Master.

The assembly of all three domains caused Saber Master’s facial expression to suddenly change.

‘This suppression is too strong. It’s even stronger compared to when he activated it with Long Xianzi’s golden light domain!’ Saber Master was secretly horrified.

He had no idea that Jian Wushuang had not done his utmost when working together with Long Xianzi to display their suppressing domains. For example, he did not unleash his Sword World’s complete power, and neither did he use his Star Armor Domain.

Although domains could be superimposed, it was done by two different people who would still have some differences when working together. Therefore, it was truly impossible to perfectly superimpose the domains.

However, he was executing the Star Armor Domain by himself at that moment, hence its power could be unleashed to the full potential when stacking up to perform three-domain suppression. Therefore, the suppression he gave Saber Master was naturally stronger than before.

Saber Master could barely execute 70 percent of his combat power as he was badly wounded. At that moment, he was only left with 50 percent of his combat power when faced with triple domain suppression.

Jian Wushuang was naturally unafraid of Saber Master who could only execute 50 percent of his combat power.

Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum!

Jian Wushuang channeled his mind as Space-time Blades appeared one by one out of nowhere in the void before him.

Each of those 18 Space-time Blades contained strong killing power.

Those 18 Space-time Blades directly attacked Saber Master under Jian Wushuang’s control.

Saber Master’s eyes turned cold as he slightly trembled before flames started pouring out and covered the heavens as he completely turned into a giant made out of flames. The flames covering the heavens started coming together to form several burning beasts that pounced toward the Space-time Blades as he made a simple step forward.

As a result, those burning beasts were torn from their middle by the Space-time Blades before those blades continued to attack Saber Master.

‘D*mn it, the suppression I’m facing is so strong that even the power of my law is largely affected when used.’ Saber Master’s facial expression darkened as he once again sent two burning flames from his eyes. Those two flames formed two flaming battle saber and slashed forward fiercely before those Space-time Blades were destroyed. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, a strong wave of wind had already arrived as the Space-time Blades dispersed.

Waves upon waves of sword shadows could be seen in the void ahead as they came toward Saber Master like a vast sea of swords.

Saber Master could only immediately take action to withstand the attack as he completely unleashed the Holy Treasure battle saber’s power in his hand and crimson saber-lights sparkled continuously.

Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!

The densely packed clashing sounds could be heard along with Saber Master’s extremely darkened facial expression.

‘This is bad, his sword technique is too domineeringly fast and strong. I can’t endure it in my current situation.’ Saber Master could feel a great wave of pressure as he clashed against Jian Wushuang’s sword technique.

The wave of pressure left him breathless.

Whoosh!

Saber Master made a move like the sea of flames directly invaded the space ahead before he retreated in a hurry.

Whoosh!

The heaven-covering sea of flames was directly cut open by another heaven-shattering sword attack. However, Jian Wushuang did not walk through the sea of flames thereafter. Instead, a huge black wood that exuded boundless Samsara Strength attacked Saber Master in the form of a black light ray.

The second sword formation of the Transmigration Sword Formation—All Sank!!

Saber Master’s facial expression changed when he saw that huge piece of black wood.

That sword formation had previously left him with a deep impression when he fought against Jian Wushuang. However, Jian Wushuang had not taken it seriously back then and only showed a little bit of his strength. At that moment, he was going all out which meant that the power of the huge black wood that was coming to attack him would be so much stronger compared to its previous state.

“Get lost!” Saber Master gritted his teeth and released all of the crimson battle saber’s full power as the domineering sword attack directly landed.

The saber-light was quick as lightning and collided head-on with the huge black wood.

However, the collision... Saber Master could feel his arm slightly numb following the bang as the battle saber almost flew out from his hand. On the other hand, Saber Master was sent flying outward like a cannon.

The huge black wood only slightly trembled before continuing its path to attack Saber Master.

‘It has such strong powers?’ Saber Master had a hint of horror in his eyes but his rage was much more prominent.

“*sshole, do you think you can beat me if I’m at my peak state?” Saber Master’s yell filled the sky as his face turned red with a hint of craziness filling his eyes.

Jian Wushuang secretly smiled when he heard the Saber Master yell.

He admitted he had been taking advantage at that time. Jian Wushuang would not have many advantages in facing him head-on if Saber Master was in his peak when coupled with the Holy Treasure battle saber’s support.

However, the world was cruel and nothing was fair.

If they were speaking about fairness, Jian Wushuang was only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God. It was truly unfair for him to cross an entire realm to face a top-tier High-level Grand Ultimate God such as Saber Master in a fight.

“Saber Master, accept your death willingly!” Jian Wushuang had a cold voice as the huge black wood formed from the Transmigration Sword Formation attacked crazily. He also moved his body as he pointed his sword to form a huge sword web that surrounded and covered Saber Master.

“You aren’t qualified to ask for my death!!” Saber Master was extremely angry and seemed completely crazy while looking on as the huge black wood attacked again. He knew he was unable to withstand it head-on so he suddenly retreated backward. In the course of retreating, he flipped his hand and took out a red pill.

The pill had a pungent fishy smell. Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed the moment Saber Master took the pill out.

“Is that...” Jian Wushuang was unable to recognize the pill the moment he saw it. However, he knew Saber Master had been forced to the edge by him and that pill must be extraordinary for Saber Master to take it out.

It was as indeed as he thought. Saber Master’s originally extremely weak aura had a sudden burst and increase after swallowing the pill!
