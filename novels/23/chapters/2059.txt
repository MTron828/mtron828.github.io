“The Great Emperor over the Vientiane Tower, I’ve dealt with him previously.” The Red Dragon King said. “His ability is considered average amongst the other Great Emperors, along with the fact that his self defence mechanism isn’t very strong… it won’t take much to kill him. The only point to be wary of is his Soul Ignition.”

“Leave this Great Emperor to me. Y’all take care of those Almighties at the Tower, don’t let a single one escape,” Emperor Bai muttered.

“Aye,” Jian Wushuang and the rest nodded.

The people began their work immediately.

Hong!!

An abrupt, ear-shattering roar could be heard.

The Protective Array over at the Tower’s lair could not withstand one blow from Emperor Bai, bursting immediately. The peace and tranquility within Vientiane Tower shattered along with it.

“Who was that?”

“What’s happening?”

One by one, figures appeared. Upon witnessing the broken Array, the experts within the Tower were both startled and angered.

Right after that, they saw several figures entering through the broken Array, pouring themselves in.

These people gave off the scent of absolute horror. They were obviously super experts of the Great Emperor level.

Whoosh!

An old figure suddenly appeared at the Void above the Tower. This grey-clothed elder had to be the only Great Emperor-level expect around.

“This is… Emperor Bai?” The elder gasped in horror upon seeing the white-haired, white-eyed man.

Emperor Bai roared, “After investigations conducted by the Sanctuary Alliance, the Vientiane Tower was placed within the Eternal Chaotic World by the villainous Acheron Palace, the evidence is clear!”

“Today, Vientiane Tower falls!”

“Death without mercy for all experts!”

Emperor Bai’s fearsome roar rang and echoed all around the lair, leaving the experts within the tower pale with fright.

“They found out?” The grey-clothed elder’s eyes drooped. He had just thought of his next course of action, only to realise Emperor Bai was already in front of him.

“Die!”

Without further words, Emperor Bai made his move.

His brutal punch swung out with a bang, destroying everything in its path before reaching the grey-clothed elder.

That made the elder’s hair stand on end. Having heard in the past how terrifying Emperor Bai was, he naturally gave everything he had to block him.

Pong! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A mellow roar. The elder’s face turned white instantly as he coughed up blood. He had taken a bad hit.

But, to survive a punch from Emperor Bai was worth being proud of already, regardless of its strength.

ARGHHHH!!!

With a fearsome roar, the elder’s boundless Soul Power was burning madly.

With death inevitable, he would give everything he has with his Soul Ignition, for one last battle.

However, even though the Soul Ignition had massively improved his combat ability to a whole new level, against Emperor Bai the elder stood no chance to retaliate.

It only took a couple hits for the elder to be neutralised by Emperor Bai. Before he died, the elder had only used one third of his Soul Power.

Even the strongest Great Emperor was annihilated by Emperor Bai’s thunder-like strikes. The remaining experts left at the Tower were taken aback upon witnessing it.

As Jian Wushuang, Red Dragon King, Great Emperor Colored Glaze and others barged into the Tower amongst the experts. A massacre ensued, like wolves among sheep.

The tower had its share of experts, but against these Great Emperors there was no place for resistance.

Within moments, half of the experts were destroyed.

“Mercy, have mercy my fellow lords. We were not aware of the relationship between Acheron Palace and the Tower, nor have we pledged allegiance to the Palace.” A cry for mercy surfaced.

As one sounded off, the rest followed, all stating that they too were not aware of the relationship.

Most of them really were not aware, and had seen themselves as members of the Eternal Chaotic World the entire time.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang and the others stopped the massacre, and gazed upon Emperor Bai.

But Emperor Bai was cold-hearted as one could ever be. “Even if there were indeed innocent or ignorant people within the Tower, the Tower has its fair share of moles and spies from the Palace. We of the Sanctuary Alliance are not able to distinguish them, nor do we have the time.”

“Desperate times, desperate measures. I would rather kill all than let one mole escape.”

“Die!!”

Determination could be felt from Emperor Bai’s voice.

The gaze of Jian Wushuang and others turned ice cold.

They agreed with Emperor Bai: The Sanctuary Alliance was busy preparing for battle against the Three-Emperors World, there was no way they had the time or effort to investigate and sort out who was innocent, and who was not.

To kill them all would be the simpler solution.

Even if they had killed a few people by mistake, so be it.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang and others started their massacre again, only this time with unseen resolve.

“No!!!”

The cries and screams of the experts were everywhere within the tower. Against the Great Emperors death was the only way out.

Soon after, the great lair within the Tower had quieten down, leaving only corpses and pools of blood.

So many experts within the Tower, not just the Almighties but also the Real Gods, cleanly wiped out under Jian Wushuang’s blade.

After the job was done, they rendezvoused with Emperor Bai.

“As the lair falls, the remaining parts of the tower can easily be destroyed by the Sanctuary Alliance forces. The Tower is finally gone.” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“This is just the surface of Vientiane Tower’s power. As the top merchant’s association, the top intelligence agency, and the top killer association … the Tower must have sent many experts to infiltrate our Sanctuary Alliance forces. These maggots, we will dig out as many as we can and exterminate them,” Emperor Bai said coldly.

Jian Wushuang and the rest nodded.

Now that the Tower’s lair is destroyed, leave the rest to Tian Chen. Next, we need to handle Zi Xu.”

Emperor Bai pulled a long face. “Jian Wushuang, Red Dragon, you two follow me. Abysmal, East Royal, you’ll all help Tian Chen with eliminating the remaining Vientiane Tower forces.”

“Aye.”

The Great Emperors responded in unison, taking off shortly after.

Under Emperor Bai’s lead, Jian Wushuang was once again brought to the enormous manor Great Emperor Zi Xu stayed in.

“Great Emperor Zi Xu, he didn’t escape?”

Jian Wushuang stood at the Void outside the manor, puzzled.

“This is the Eternal Chaotic World, the Sanctuary Alliance calls the shots. I had Tian Chen keep an eye on him way back ago. You think he could escape even if he wanted to?” Emperor Bai sniggered.

“That makes sense.” Jian Wushuang realised.

In the realm of the Sanctuary Alliance, under close watch by Emperor Bai himself? Even if Great Emperor Zi Xu wanted to run, he would not have known how.
