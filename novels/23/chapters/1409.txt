Chapter 1410: Victory Or Defeat!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Huh?”

Ling Feibai lifted his head and happened to see the crimson sun twinkling in Jian Wushuang’s eyes that was charging towards him.

“Dreamland again?”

“I told you, it won’t affect me.”

Ling Feibei roared and his fierce consciousness charged. He shook off the dreamland instantly.

Of course, although he had freed himself from the dreamland, it required some time for it to happen.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were twinkling with unprecedented light.

“I knew that it wouldn’t be of any harm to you. But as long as it affected you by a slight amount, it would be enough!”

Jian Wushuang’s roar reverberated in the entire Milky Way. Before the surrounding disciples’ gazes, Jian Wushuang, who was close to Ling Feibai, gathered the churning divine power in his body all into his right index finger. The very next moment, the index finger that had gathered boundless divine power spurted gold brilliant light.

“Fourth Finger of Ancient God, God’s Test!”

Rumble!

He pointed and the earth shattered.

The entire Milky Way darkened.

Among the boundless darkness, a huge bronze finger that seemed to extend over from the remote ages appeared.

The huge bronze finger brought about an imposing force that could destroy the world. When it appeared, every disciple’s face grew pale.

Even the deacon elderlies among the Milky Way were shocked by the sight.

“Bloodline Power!”

“Jian Wushuang has such a strong bloodline!”

“This kind of bloodline should be an Ancient God’s bloodline, right?”

Ancient God was definitely the utmost supreme bloodline in Eternal Chaotic World. The ferocity of Ancient God was well understood by the deacon elderlies.

Then, Jian Wushuang relied on his Ancient God power to put his Ancient God unique skill into full play, which was the fourth finger of Ancient God!

He had acquired the technique of the fourth finger after he had became a Universe God in the First Heaven and awakened again to inherit the memory. Only Ancient Gods above five-star were qualified to perform that technique. Even Jian Wushuang barely performed it.

However, he amazed the world with the single feat.

Rumble!

The bronze huge finger charged towards Ling Feibai. A terrifying manner suppressed the air and Ling Feibai was shocked.

He had just freed himself from Jian Wushuang’s dreamland and he had to deal with such a terrifying technique. Naturally, he was slightly slow in response. He couldn’t dodge in time but he immediately performed a Sword Principle to break the huge bronze finger apart.

Wah!

The eye-catching sword light suddenly erupted.

Ling Baifei couldn’t perform his unique skill in time and he only swung his sword. It gave out great power, especially a tearing power.

Bang!

The huge bronze finger collided with the sword light. A loud thud came along with psst psst psst. An enormous amount of divine power crushed and crashed. The eye-catching sword light wanted to tear down the huge bronze finger. However, Ling Feibai belittled the power of the fourth finger of Ancient God.

As it was a supreme unique skill of an Ancient God, even though Jian Wushuang concentrated the Ancient God power all over his body, he was only just able to perform the technique. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If Ling Feibai could perform his unique skill, he would be able to resist or even tear off the huge finger. However, a random swing wouldn’t be able to resist the huge bronze finger, let alone to tear it apart.

The huge bronze finger gave out strong power and collapsed the sword light like breaking a piece of dead word. Then, the huge finger covered Ling Fei Bai’s body directly.

“No,” Ling Feibai was frightened.

Bang!!!

The earth-shattering rumble was heard across Titanic Star and also the Milky Way.

The huge bronze finger erupted its power entirely and formed a bronze divine storm while Ling Feibai drowned in it.

“It ended?”

“Ling Feibai, did he lose?”

At the border of Titanic Star, the disciples were shocked at the sight.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void panting, but his gaze was fixed on the inner part of the divine storm.

Just then…

Rumble!!!

A scary aura suddenly swept out from the divine storm. The aura was extremely fierce and it broke off from the divine storm easily.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed and was replaced by a bitter smile.

The disciples at the border of Titanic Star were in shock.

They saw that after the soaring aura had broken the divine storm, a three meter tall Purple God which was covered with purple scales and had ferocious features appeared. The Purple God held a purple, soft sword in his hand. Although there was a tremendous change in his body, there was no change in his appearance.

The Purple God was Ling Feibai.

“Supreme Heaven!”

“Ling Feibai even used Supreme Heaven. It seems like he was cornered.”

“Haha, to be able to force Ling Feibai to this stage is very good.”

The deacon elderlies were chatting on the Milky Way. They knew that what Ling Feibai was going to do would be his strongest trump card.

On Titanic Star, Jian Wushuang stood there calmly with a bitter face.

Although the Purple God that Ling Feibai transformed into had a soaring aura, his facial expression was one of embarrassment. He looked at Jian Wushuang apologetically, “Sorry, I got too excited and used this technique subconsciously. Using this technique in the battle is rather unfair to all the disciples, including you. So… Consider me a loser for this battle.”

The disciples heard what Ling Feibai said and they were astonished.

“Ling Feibai admitted defeat?”

“But he won, no?”

Jian Wushuang lifted his head and looked at Ling Feibai, “I lost and I can only blame myself for not being powerful enough. Plus, according to the rules of the battle, disciples must refrain from consuming elixirs or performing secret skills of Star Palace. But the secret skill that you performed is secret skill of Star Palace. It should be another secret skill from Scripture Depository, right?”

“Yes, the secret skill is called Supreme Heaven,” Ling Feibai nodded.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang said calmly, “there are four secret skills in Scripture Depository. The secret skill of Star Palace is basic. Any disciple of Star Palace could cultivate that. However, the other three secret skills would require one to pass through the third floor of Star Tower in order to qualify to cultivate another one. You are able to cultivate Supreme Heaven and it must mean that you passed through the third floor of Star Tower. You obtained it with your own power, how’s that unfair?”

“So, I am the one who lost this battle.”

Then, Jian Wushuang looked at the deacon elderly who stood not far away and said, “Elderly, please announce the result then.”

The deacon elderly looked at Hall Master Yuan in the Milky Way. He then made the announcement when he saw Hall Master Yuan nod.

“Ling Feibai is the winner of this battle!”
