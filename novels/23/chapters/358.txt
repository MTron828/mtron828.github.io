Chapter 359: The Selection of Disciples

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

During the year Jian Wushuang was in the Ancestor’s Land, the Nanyang Continent was rather peaceful. The disturbance caused by the fight between Jian Wushuang and Second Holy Master concluded with Jian Wushuang’s disappearance.

Though Holy Emperor Palace suffered a great loss at Jian Wushuang’s hands, that didn’t shake its position as an overlord of Nanyang Continent.

The entrance to Holy Emperor Palace was on a huge island named Holy Emperor Island.

In recent days, the cities around Holy Emperor Island were crowded with experts from every corner of Nanyang Continent.

Inside a restaurant in one of those cities, a large number of warriors had gathered, most of whom were powerful youngsters. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

At a table sat two young men and a girl. One of the men and the girl were excited and looked like they were expecting something.

“Soon, we’ll step onto Holy Emperor Island!”

“I really want to see the location of the overlord of Nanyan, Holy Emperor Palace, myself.”

The man and the girl gasped in admiration from time to time, their eyes burning with excitement. The remaining handsome young man with purple hair looked calm.

“Brother Ji Chen, what’s wrong? We’ll arrive at Holy Emperor Palace soon. Why aren’t you excited at all?” the green-clothed girl asked in confusion.

“Holy Emperor Palace?” The handsome young man with purple hair, Ji Chen, smirked and shook his head before saying, “The palace is indeed powerful and also good at training disciples, but there are too many restrictions. I would rather temper myself by traveling the world rather than staying in the palace.”

“Like Jian Wushuang?” A voice echoed.

Ji Chen and the other two immediately looked toward the person who was speaking and bowed slightly. “Elder Qu.”

It was an elder with tangled red hair. He looked calm, and his aura showed that he was at the peak of the Saint Realm.

The elder casually sat down beside them. Cleaning his ears, he said, “Ji Chen, I know you greatly admire Jian Wushuang. Sure, he’s quite strong and generally recognized as the strongest genius on the Nanyang Continent by all the experts.

“But, until today, there has been no other genius like him in the history of Nanyang Continent. You’re indeed gifted, but still at no position to even compare with him.”

“What you need is solid and steady progress. Don’t aim too high!”

Ji Chen respectfully listened to the elder.

Elder Qu continued, “Holy Emperor Palace is the number one sect in our continent and only accessible to top geniuses. All of its disciples are real experts.

“You three are the most talented in our Desert Dynasty, especially you, Ji Chen. All of you should try your best to pass the test of Holy Emperor Palace. Do not miss this chance, it only happens once in a blue moon.”

“Understood.” Ji Chen and the others nodded.

While Elder Qu was talking to Ji Chen and the others, a young man carrying a long sword on his back was drinking alone at the table beside them. Not far from them, the young man heard their every word and smiled.

“Today, I arrived at Holy Emperor Island from Dark Forest, just as the palace is holding a selection for disciples. What a coincidence!”?The young man, Jian Wushuang, smiled oddly.

He had heard about the selections previously. Holy Emperor Palace held it every five years in order to select its disciples.

Numerous experts from Nanyang Continent would swarm to the island whenever the selection was held, for the only purpose of becoming a disciple of the palace and cultivating there.

Holy Emperor Palace was an overlord of Nanyang and could overpower the Alchemy School. So, saying it was the number one sect in Nanyang was a bit of an understatement. For those experts of Nanyang Continent, it would be good fortune to be able to cultivate in the palace.

It was similar to the Easternmost Hunt, held by Twelve Northwestern Dynasties in Tianzong Dynasty, that Jian Wushuang had participated in.

Only some old sects had been present at the Easternmost Hunt, yet there had still been a large number of experts fiercely fighting over it. It could be imagined how much more fiercely the experts would fight in the five-year selection.

While Jian Wushuang was in deep thought, suddenly...

Weng! Weng! Weng!

A deep bell resounded from far off in the distance, reaching the city and the restaurant where Jian Wushaung was.

“The selection begins!”

Many young experts stood up the moment they heard the bell, including Ji Chen and the others with him.

“Let’s go!”

Without thinking too much, those experts rushed towards the bell.

In a second, the noisy restaurant had become empty. Jian Wushuang was the only one sitting there, not in a hurry to leave. After finishing the wine on the table, he got up and slowly headed towards Holy Emperor Island.

At Holy Emperor Island, an ancient and majestic gate surrounded the area like a sleeping dragon.

Jian Wushuang stepped onto the island only to see a huge crowd of people from all corners of the Nanyang Continent standing in front of the gate. Some were alone, but others were accompanied by their elders.

In front of them, next to the gate, there was a long and towering staircase that led to the top of the gate. From the look of it, it had over a hundred steps.

“Is that the famous Holy Steps of Holy Emperor Palace?”?Jian Wushuang smiled while looking at the staircase.

The staircase was well-known. Everyone who wanted to pass the selection had to pass this first.

There were a total of 108 steps, with each bearing a powerful force. The further one went, the more pressure one would feel.

Passing those steps was the first test in the selection. The following test would only be available for those who climbed all 108 steps and made it to the top of the gate.

At the moment, all of the experts were waiting quietly for the beginning of the selection.

Jian Wushuang smiled while shaking his head as he watched the scene.

“The selection usually lasts for quite a while. I can’t afford to wait until it ends.”

Jian Wushuang smirked. Then, with a flash, he appeared at the foot of the Holy Steps.
