Chapter 2450: Heaven and Earth Aligns

“Did his divine power energy just become more powerful?”

Everyone around noticed the changes in Jian Wushuang’s energy.

“His cultivation level seemed to have increased. He probably performed a certain secret technique. Be extra careful.” Long Zishan frowned before immediately looking towards those around him.

Right at that moment, Jian Wushuang had already raised his head once again.

A horrifying divine power had violently emerged with a rumble as he raised his head. The two layers of the domain that were pressing against him—the grey mist field and the black energy flow that covered the sky—were immediately affected by the divine power he was projecting which greatly decreased its oppressive effects.

“No!” Yu Aoqing was shocked.

She had already sensed that the effects of her two domains on Jian Wushuang had been reduced quite a bit. Previously, she could at least suppress half of Jian Wushuang’s speed, but at this moment she could not even suppress 20 percent of it.

Jian Wushuang moved once again and exploded with much faster and more terrifying speeds than before!

“Careful, Junior Sister!” Long Zichan warned quietly.

Yu Aoqing immediately reacted and steadily gazed over.

Jian Wushuang’s figure had appeared before her with his long sword already swung out.

A blurry sword essence swept outwards.

The time and space around were immediately frozen as ripples formed within the void.

Space-time Sword Technique—First Form, Cutting Snow!

“His sword technique changed?” Yu Aoqing’s pupils shrunk slightly.

Jian Wushuang had been using Purple Blood Sword Technique all the while when battling against them before. He pushed his speed to the limits with that absolutely strange technique.

However, Jian Wushuang was using his own creation at this moment, the Space-time Sword Technique.

The sword technique he created was naturally his best and strongest sword skill.

Ring!

A sword shadow charged towards Yu Aoqing and it was impossible for her to dodged it. However, in the end, she was still one of the Twelve Minor Kings. Her black dagger had been pushed out in an instant such that even the void formed into a swirl as a result from that stab.

Clang!

The sound of metals clashing was heard as a trace of fear flashed across Yu Aoqing’s face. The dagger she was holding flew out of her hand as her figure instantly propelled backward. Fortunately, it was not life-threatening.

At the same time, Long ZIshan had already appeared on Jian Wushuang’s side.

“Eat this, kid!”

Long Zishan’s entire body was glowing bright with purple lights with traces of purple-colored electric bolts sparking out of his eyes. The long purple spear in his hand had turned into a huge purple lightning beam as it swept up with crackles and infinite power.

“Shura’s God-Eliminating Spear!”

Long Zishan shouted violently as the crackling lightning beam shot straight at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang steady his eyes and sent Blood Mountain Sword flatly outwards.

His stab directly went to the middle of the purple lightning beam as a unique Samsara strength swept outwards.

Ring, ring~~~ The crackling purple lightning in the lightning beam had turned into purple-colored divine powers and dispersed towards every direction.

“What?!” Long Zishan was absolutely shocked.

He did not expect that his most powerful strike was so easily dissolved by Jian Wushuang.

At that instant, Jian Wushuang attacked with his sword again.

Ring!

A blurry sword-light lit up and directly slashing at Long Zishan.

The sword-light was so incredibly fast that it was almost impossible to react to it.

However, Long Zishan reacted very quickly by retracting his spear to block the attack in front of his face.

Just as the sword-light most touched his long spear...

“Something’s not right!”

Long Zishan’s heart skipped a beat as the purple battle armor he was wearing immediately projected a blinding golden lightning bolt and once again formed a purple lightning armor on the surface of his purple battle armor.

There was no feeling of two weapons clashing just as his spear made contact with the blurry sword shadow. Instead, a beam of mysterious sword-light had slashed on the layer of purple lightning armor.

Samsara Sword Technique—Samsara Empty Strike!

Empty yet solid. Illusionary yet real.

As he took a frontal hit from Jian Wushuang, the purple lightning armor on the surface of Long Zishan’s body immediately dimmed. At the same time, a mouthful of blood shot out from Long Zishan’s oral cavity as his body flew out like a broken kite.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had warded off two experts—Yu Aoqing and Long Zishan. The Four Elephant Formation formed by those four Great Compassion Sect’s First-Class Divine Demon were the only ones left standing around Jian Wushuang like dumbfounded.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes seemed at a loss when he looked at those four.

Although his eyes looked lost, the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand was slowly raised.

He swung his sword again.

It was such a plain strike without sword-lights or sword shadows bursting out of it and also without any vibrations around.

The world remained extremely calm and quiet.

However, an extremely fast sword shadow suddenly slashed open the void under the silence.

Ring! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A blinding sword-light appeared out of nowhere.

The sword-light seemed to connect Heaven and Earth together. It was absolutely stunning and extremely bright.

The moment when it appeared, it became the core and the focus of the world.

It had even become eternal.

There were many genius disciples from different sects around the battlefield and all of them were mesmerized by the sword-light.

That strike was so beautiful!

“Nine seas and eight wilderness, Heaven and Earth align!” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

That stroke had connected time and space, yin and yang, life and death; all on a single point.

Its name was—Heaven and Earth Aligns!

That stroke was something Jian Wushuang discovered when he was in the middle of his massacre at Saint’s Tomb.

That stroke had included Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Space-time Law and was actually the second form of his Space-time Sword Technique as well!

Jian Wushuang had just created that form and this was the very first time it had been displayed.

Everyone around was immersed in the sword-lights’ absolute beauty.

However, the four Great Compassion Sect’s First-class Divine Demon in the middle of that sword-light had their living souls frightened out of their bodies.

The sword-light slashed everything opened from the moment it appeared, breaking the connections between four of them.

Their Four Elephant Formation was completely shattered.

However, the sword-lights’ full potential was not fully unleashed.

“Quickly, break the Safety Token...”

As one of the First-Class Divine Demons spoke, the sword-light had swept across their bodies before he could finish his sentence.

Ring~~~ The sword-light had finally dissolved.

Many disciples around the battlefield had finally snapped out of it.

When they looked over again, they realized in the void where the sword-light was at previously, those four Great Compassion Sect First-Class Divine Demon disciples had turned into badly decapitated corpses that were slowly falling downwards.

The air had frozen at that moment.

“That...”

Huan Chen and Hao Yang were standing side-by-side on the edge of the battlefield, feeling incredibly stunned.

They were planning to go forward and kill Jian Wushuang. However, who knew Jian Wushuang suddenly burst into action?

Merely in the blink of an eye, Yu Aoqing was flown off after taking a frontal hit; Long Zishan suffered severe injury; the four Great Compassion Sect’s First-Class Divine Demon disciples were eliminated directly.

The table was completely turned.
