Chapter 2631: One Against Four

“I was wrong?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly. “What Master Inspector means is that this Blood Gem mineral vein has nothing to do with Northern Darkstar Territory?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“That’s exactly what I mean.” Jin Yihang smiled sinisterly.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Jin Yihang before turning around and left.

Jin Yihang was smiling even wider when he saw that.

However...

“Commander Cang Heng.” Jian Wushuang ordered, “Tell the Official Army to retreat immediately and head back to the Northern Darkstar Territory.”

“Yes.” Cang Heng obeyed.

“Wait!” Jin Yihang was in horror and said in a low voice, “Jian Yi, what are you doing?”

Jian Wushuang turned around and sneered, “Isn’t it strange for you to ask this question, Master Inspector? You said that this Blood Gem mineral vein has nothing to do with my Northern Darkstar Territory. In that case, the Official Army doesn’t need to spend their time guarding this area. I’ll leave this completely to you.”

“Let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang led Cang Heng and the remaining commanders away—they were about to leave the area.

“Stop!” Jin Yihang shouted in a low voice, “You can go, but the Official Army has to stay.”

“Why is that so?” Jian Wushuang asked quizzically.

“No particular reason. I need your Official Army,” said Jin Yihang.

He could not help it. He could care less if Jian Wushuang had left and was what he wanted.

However, he did not think the same about the Official Army.

The Blood Gem mineral vein is so huge, hence it’s quite difficult to mine and would need many cultivators to work mining it.

They would need to monitor and guard the many cultivators mining the mineral vein to prevent things from going wrong.

Jin Yihang was an inspector sent by the Crimson Stone Fort, but only had five people in the team including himself. The five were enough to guard the Blood Gem mineral vein but were short-handed to fully monitor the mining activities and ensure the cultivators did not secretly hide a stash of the Blood Gems. A little carelessness was enough to lead to complete riots with many Blood Gems gone by then.

That was why he needed the Official Army!

The mining of Blood Gem would be safe and secure with two or three out of the ten battalions guarding the mineral vein.

Even though stealing seemed inevitable, the impact would not be big.

Jian Wushuang knew Jin Yihang’s intentions as he cracked a smile and said, “Master, you won’t give the Northern Darkstar Territory any benefits, but want my Official Army to guard the Blood Gem mineral vein. Can there be such a good deal in life?”

“I don’t care much, but you’ll have to ask these commanders if they are willing to guard it for you?”

Cang Heng and several other commanders who were behind Jian Wushuang stared at Jin Yihang with indifferent expressions.

Although they were not in a position to protest due to the other party’s identity, they looked extremely dissatisfied.

What a joke! Who would be willing to work without any returns?

Jin Yihang’s complexion gradually became ugly under the few commanders’ gaze.

“Let’s go.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand again.

Jin Yihang’s complexion turned ashen.

“Hmph, you have to get my consent before leaving here. The four of you, go get and kill them if they dare resist,” ordered Jin Yihang coldly.

The four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods behind Jin Yihang looked at each other and immediately stepped forward.

“Sorry, we’re only following orders,” said a white-robed middle-aged man among the four.

“Just surrender yourself so that you’ll suffer less. Otherwise...” said an old man with red eyebrows.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold as the four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods approached.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

The Transmigration Power-filled Infernal Crimson Divine Swords were suspended in front of Jian Wushuang.

Cang Heng and the other commanders were staring at Jian Wushuang behind him. Those commanders were merely Peak Ultimate Gods and unable to fight against the Peak Earth Ultimate Gods, hence Jian Wushuang was their only hope in walking away safely.

They had witnessed how Jian Wushuang defeated the Green Flame Territorial Lord, who was also a Peak Earth Ultimate God.

However, there were four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods in front of Jian Wushuang at that moment.

“Congeal!” Jian Wushuang indifferently said.

The nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords immediately overlapped at an astonishing speed before causing a huge and endless Reincarnation Passage to appear out of thin air. a black divine sword encased with the Transmigration Power shot out from the end of that passage.

The first level of Transmigration Sword Formation—Heaven’s Edge!

Boom!

The black divine sword was like a huge awl with a terrifying power that went straight at the four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods.

“So stubborn!”

“How dare you fire the first shot when facing four of us?”

“He can’t blame us since he has a death wish.”

The four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods’ expressions became cold as the four took action together.

The four of them discharged their divine power breath and were noticeably much stronger than the Green Flame Territorial Lord. Any one of them was more powerful than that of the Green Flame Territorial Lord.

The four of them then joined forces...

As a result...

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Four consecutive collisions blasted in the void before four people were sent flying like cannonballs.

The four people spewed blood as their divine power breath instantly died down along with the explosions.

Jian Wushuang was concurrently fighting alone against the four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods.

The four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods were completely defeated in just one blow!

“Humph!” Jian Wushuang snorted coldly. The black divine sword that resembled a huge awl shook slightly before a monstrous power erupted from it and charged toward Jin Yihang in the void.

“Sh*t!”

Jin Yihang was taken aback.

How could he think of resisting the blow as a merely High-level Earth Ultimate God when even four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods had been hit hard from the black divine sword’s impact?

“No, no! Stop it!” Jin Yihang hysterically pleaded. However, the black divine sword did not hold back and went straight at his divine body.

Jin Yihang’s physical protection methods collapsed as the terrifying power instantly passed through his body.
