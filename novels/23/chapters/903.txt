“You, come with me.”

Jian Wushuang ordered, looking down at the bald man who was kneeling in front of him. He glanced at the young men and women behind him and said to them, “As for you, go back where you came from and be careful not to get caught again.”

As soon as he had said this, Jian Wushuang took the bald man in one hand and set off, leaving the young men and women and the dead bodies behind.

“Dead, my brother, the devils from the Blood Clothing Sect are all dead,” said the little girl who was being held by her brother.

“Yes, they are all dead,” a dirty young man wrapped in an animal skin said. His eyes were shining. “It was that man, the lord, who killed them.

“He killed all the devils from the Blood Clothing Sect in seconds. What a top-notch expert. And it appears that he is going looking for trouble with the master of the Blood Clothing Sect.”

“The master of the Blood Clothing Sect? The demon?” The girl was stunned.

“I hope the lord can kill the demon.” The man clenched his hands and picked up the little girl. “Little Yin, let’s get out of here quickly.”

Soon, the young men and women who had been saved by Jian Wushuang all left.

They had thought they had no chance of surviving under the hands of the Blood Clothing Sect, but they had been extremely fortunate. Jian Wushuang had happened to cross their path and save them.

Jian Wushuang grasped the bald man from the Blood Clothing Sect, who guided him toward the Sect’s lair.

On the way, he asked some basic information about the Blood Clothing Sect and the strength of their master.

“Top of the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm?”?Jian Wushuang thought with a slight smile. He didn’t mind that.

He didn’t attach much importance to anyone below the level of Dao Master.

“My Lord, here we are,” the bald man said in horror.

Jian Wushuang stopped and looked at the huge rift in front of him. There were a few palaces and pavilions within and it was protected by a Formation with a blood-red light. It was clear that this was the lair of a sect.

“This is the lair of the Blood Clothing Sect and it has a Protective Array. But the Protective Array can only stop people in the Eternal Realm,”?Jian Wushuang thought. He smiled faintly with a sharp flash in his eyes.

Chhh!

A sharp sword slipped passed the bald man’s neck. Jian Wushuang killed him.

The bald man had thought that Jian Wushuang would keep him alive if he followed his instructions. But Jian Wushuang had had no intention of keeping him alive. He knew how the Blood Clothing Sect did things and had seen how he treated the young men and women.

Jian Wushuang continued moving closer toward the Blood Clothing Sect’s lair.

As soon as he appeared in the void above the rift, he set off the Protective Array. But he simply waved a ray of sword light and tore a hole in it easily. He rushed into the rift through the hole.

In a grand palace, in the very center of the Blood Clothing Sect’s lair.

“In three months, the next bloody baptism will be carried out. Is everything we need ready? How about the little guys?” The master of the Blood Clothing Sect asked coldly. He was a young man with a red sword scar between his eyebrows. He was wearing a scarlet robe. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Below him were several higher level experts, the Elders of the Blood Clothing Sect.

At this time...

“Wait.”

The master and the elders were startled. They were all clearly aware that someone had just torn a hole in the Protective Array.

“Someone’s breaking in,” one of the Elders said, standing up. But Jian Wushuang didn’t wait for them to react.

Swoosh!

A figure had appeared in the palace like a ghost.

Everyone in the palace stared at the newcomer.

“You’re the master of the Blood Clothing Sect, aren’t you?” Jian Wushuang questioned with a slight smile. He was looking up at the man at the top of the palace.

“Who are you?” the master of the Blood Clothing Sect asked with a cold expression. He could tell that the man in front of him was extraordinary.

Anyone who could tear the Blood Clothing Sect’s Protective Array so easily and break into the palace, was either a Dao Master, or at the top of the Eternal Realm. The Blood Clothing Sect did not want to provoke such a man.

“There is no need for you to know who I am. I am just here to ask something. And to clean this place out,” Jian Wushuang said. His figure floated out.

“Damn!”

“You are looking for death!”

“Kill him!”

The Blood Clothing Sect members became angry and attacked Jian Wushuang together.

However, Jian Wushuang was powerful. No matter how many Eternal Realm experts joined the fight, they were just going to get slaughtered by him.

Within a moment, the palace was completely quiet.

Jian Wushuang waved his sword and cut the Blood Clothing Sect master’s head off.

“The Void Temple Subsidiary Palace isn’t far from here?” Jian Wushuang thought with a smile. He had gotten his answer from the master of the Blood Clothing Sect, so he left immediately.

When he left, he even destroyed the lair, splitting it in half.

“Jian Wushuang, the Blood Clothing Sect has no enmity toward you and the master answered your question honestly. Why did you kill him and destroy the Blood Clothing Sect? You should know that the master of the Blood Clothing Sect has a good relationship with the two Dao Masters in this territory,” the Gu King asked Jian Wushuang.

“The Blood Clothing Sect has a horrible reputation. Their way of doing things is extremely vicious and cruel. Destroying this kind of sect is not a bad thing. Besides, it’s so easy,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“It seems that you are quite righteous. But I have to remind you, in this world, if you want to live long, you should keep as far away as you can from unnecessary troubles that have nothing to do with you,” the Gu King said with a sad tone. “My last host, King Luo Zhen just died because he wanted to deal with troubles that had nothing to do with him.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang nodded his head with a smile. “Don’t worry, if I wasn’t able to measure danger, I wouldn’t have been able to get out from the Ancient World to where I am now.”

“That’s good.” The Gu King responded and said no more.

AJian Wushuang went directly to the Void Temple Subsidiary Palace. When he arrived, he took out his master’s Senior Brother Xue Lingtian’s token to open the space wormhole.

With the space wormhole, Jian Wushuang quickly returned to the territory of the Tang of the East.
