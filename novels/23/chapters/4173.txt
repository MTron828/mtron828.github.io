4174 Mockery

“Blood Sword, since you’re with us now, we’ll definitely protect you,” The young girl, Qingxi, patted Jian Wushuang’s shoulder and snorted loudly, “however, with your strength, don’t even think about joining the Ninth Kalpa King. He’s the number one Ultimate Ruler in the entire universe. Even if he wants to expand his power and take in Rulers, he’ll be an Ultimate Ruler like my master. You’re only a fourth-level Ruler, so he’ll definitely look down on you.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh. However, he knew that the girl did not mean to belittle him, so he replied noncommittally, “What you said makes sense.”

“Of course.” Hearing this, Qingxi snorted complacently. then, as if she was afraid that Jian Wushuang would be depressed, she quickly comforted him, “You don’t have to worry. As long as you follow us obediently, when my master enters the camp of the Ninth Kalpa King, he will naturally protect us. My master is the kindest.”

Jian Wushuang found it interesting and nodded with a smile.

Water Sorcerer Ruler, who was walking in front, noticed this scene and could not help but turn back to glare at Qingxi. “Little Qing, be careful with your words and actions. Be careful with your words and actions!”

After saying that, Water Sorcerer Ruler looked at Jian Wushuang and said with a faint smile, “However, it’s a good fate for you to know us, young friend. If I can really enter the Ninth Kalpa King’s camp, it’s not impossible for me to protect you.”

“I’ll have to trouble you then, Water Sorcerer Ruler.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but he sighed in his heart.

From his observation, these three people were all kind-hearted people. This was naturally not a good thing, but in the Tarot Ruins, where killing and plundering had become a habit, it might not be a good thing.

A few hours later, Jian Wushuang, Water Sorcerer Ruler, and the others arrived at the central area of the Tarot Ruins.

“Little friend, that’s where the Ninth Kalpa King is.” Water Sorcerer Ruler pointed off into the distance at an endless mountain range, on top of which was an enormous palace.

Jian Wushuang looked up and saw many Rulers waiting outside the palace. They looked nervous. Most of them were Ultimate Rulers.

“Those Rulers, are they all Ninth Kalpa King’s men?” Jian Wushuang withdrew his gaze and asked in confusion.

Water Sorcerer Ruler shook his head and replied, “No, I think they’re all like us. They heard the news and came here to seek refuge with the Ninth Kalpa King. After all, the killing in the Tarot Ruins is too crazy. If you’re not strong enough and don’t have a backer, you can’t stand on your own.”

“Let’s go, we’ll head over too.” With that, Water Sorcerer Ruler led Jian Wushuang, Ruler Ran Gu, and Qingxi toward the palace.

“Blood Sword, when the time comes, we just need to stand behind my master and not say anything. Everything will be handled by my master.” Ran Gu walked beside Jian Wushuang and reminded him in a low voice.

“Alright,” he said. Jian Wushuang nodded to show that he understood.

A moment later, the four of them landed outside the palace.

As soon as they landed, they could hear the discussion of the Ultimate Rulers.

“What do you think the Ninth Kalpa King’s sudden expansion of power and recruitment of the Rulers of the ruins means?”

“I don’t know. Maybe the Ninth Kalpa King saw that the Third Prince and the Ruler Silver Roc were both expanding their forces and felt a sense of crisis?”

“The Ninth Kalpa King has always been arrogant. I’m afraid he won’t be interested in ordinary Ultimate Rulers this time.”

“Let’s try. If we can’t join the Ninth Kalpa King’s forces, we can only rely on the Ruler Silver Roc. But I heard that the Ruler Silver Roc is narrow-minded. If we rely on him, I’m afraid we won’t have a good time. Sigh.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Many Ultimate Rulers were discussing in low voices. Then, they saw the Sorcery God bring Jian Wushuang and the other two over and they let out a soft gasp.

“Eh? Two fifth-level chief Rulers, and even a fourth-level chief Ruler? With your strength, you’re here to join in the fun. Are you asking to be humiliated?”

“Hahahaha, what a joke. With such strength, he should have left the Tarot Ruins. Staying here is just asking for death.”

“At first, I was still a little uncertain and uncertain about joining the Ninth Kalpa King’s force. But with the help of these buggers, I suddenly became confident.”

Low sneers could be heard.

The people present were all Ultimate Rulers, and they were mocking him without the slightest bit of fear.

Qingxi and Ruler Ran Gu were instantly enraged, and even the Water Sorcerer’s expression turned unsightly.

“Master, they’ve gone too far…” Qingxi clenched her fists and said in a low voice.

Water Sorcerer Ruler took a deep breath upon hearing this, then said in a calm voice, “Let them say whatever they want, we just need to take care of ourselves.”

“But…” Qingxi was about to say something else when the Water Sorcerer interrupted her with a firm voice. “No buts.”

Qingxi could only lower her head.

Water Sorcerer Ruler could not help but let out a soft sigh upon seeing this. After some thought, he said, “Qing ‘er, only by joining the Ninth Kalpa King’s camp can we have a place to protect ourselves in the Tarot Ruins. with this place, we can have a chance to avenge your Eldest Senior Brother. So, let it be, as long as it doesn’t affect our entry into the Ninth Kalpa King’s camp.”

“I understand, master.” Hearing this, Qingxi still pulled a long face.

Water Sorcerer Ruler did not say anything more. He glanced at Jian Wushuang, who was standing at the back with his head lowered, and shook his head.

….

At the same time, in the palace.

The Ninth Kalpa King stood in the middle of the hall with his hands behind his back. Divine Marquis Qingfeng was half a body’s length behind him.

The huge Palace seemed a little empty.

“Ninth Kalpa, do you really plan to call upon the Rulers to fight to the death with the Ruler Silver Roc before you leave the ruins?” Divine Marquis Qingfeng asked.

“A life-and-death battle? Is he even worthy?” Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King sneered expressionlessly. Then, his eyes flickered with a cold light and he said, “If it wasn’t for the fact that he has so many rotten fish and shrimps around him, I would have killed him long ago. Why would I have kept him alive until now?”

Divine Marquis Qingfeng smiled bitterly and shook his head. “If only you had been willing to recruit the Ultimate Ruler in these ruins earlier, the Silver Roc wouldn’t have been here.”

“Don’t you know that I’ve kept the Ruler Silver Roc alive until now to wait for Jian Wushuang to come out so that we can take revenge together? If the Silver Roc hadn’t ambushed me in Fengyang Canyon, how could Jian Wushuang have been chased by Qing Xuzi?”

After a pause, the Ninth Kalpa King said with an indifferent expression, “Although we know that Jian Wushuang is still alive, there is no news from him. Let’s take revenge for him together.”
