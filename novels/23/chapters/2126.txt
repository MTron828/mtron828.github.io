Chapter 2127 The Salty Demon King Chen Yu

The terrifying onslaught continued. The fighting power that Demon King Chen Yu displayed shocked Abysmal Saint Master, Underworld God and everyone around.They knew they could not even fend off one attack at that level.

However, Jian Wushuang could fight the Demon King head on single handedly without backing off at all.

Demon King Chen Yu could not deal with Jian Wushuang even after he had risked his life and given his all. His face was dark.

After many collisions, the aura radiating from Jian Wushuang did not weaken at all.

Under the fury of attacks, Jian Wushuang was unharmed?

“This brat!” Demon King Chen Yu gritted his teeth and thought.

What he did not know was that Jian Wushuang was actually hurt.

After each collision, his divine body would be hurt. However, his divine power would heal the injury instantly. This caused the illusion that Jian Wushuang was completely unhurt.

This was how overpowered the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body in the seventh step of inverse cultivation was.

Demon King Chen Yu could not do much to Jian Wushuang. Furthermore…

“Chen Yu!”

Another message came through. This time. Demon King Chen Yu was surprised as the person sending the message was Kaiser Blood!

“Chen Yu, leave immediately. Emperor Bai is headed your way.” Kaiser Blood said urgently.

Demon King Chen Yu did not care about the six great emperors who were coming to assist. There was no way they could hurt him.

However, this was not the case for Emperor Bai.

He had fought Emperor Bai head on before. He clearly knew how powerful and scary that man was.

The last time they had fought in the Three Emperors World, he had some confidence. However, this time they were fighting in the Ancient Mystery Land, in the territory of Emperor Bai. His life would be at risk if he was overwhelmed by Emperor Bai and the experts from both the Sanctuary Alliance and the Special Tribes Alliance.

Even though Demon King Chen Yu was extremely unwilling to retreat, he dared not stay.

He took a deep breath and shouted, “Retreat!”

His voice reverberated across the battlefield. He had originally attacked Jian Wushuang in a frenzy. Now, he backed off quickly.

The experts from the other battlefield had long reached their limit. Now they heard the command to retreat, they heaved a sigh of relief and started to retreat.

“Humph. You do not simply come and go at will. Chase them and kill them all!” Jian Wushuang commanded coldly.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang turned into a shooting star and started the chase.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill them all!”

Abysmal Saint Master, Underworld God, Emperor God Tian Ling and East Royal Emperor chased alongside Jian Wushuang.

As for the five war spirits, Jian Wushuang recalled them to the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror.

The experts from the two different sides started a game of cat and mouse. They flew across the Ancient Battlefield at amazing speed.

Jian Wushuang and his allies had a very strong killing intent as they chased the people running quickly.

Within the Ancient Battlefield, they had no additional consideration as it was under the control of Sanctuary Alliance.

The situation was different for the experts from Acheron Palace.

“The six great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance and Special Tribes Alliance have already entered the Ancient Battlefield. I have already messaged the others to see if they will stop the bastards from Acheron Palace in time,” Abysmal Saint Master said giving chase.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned dark.

He knew clearly that there had to be a wormhole within the Ancient Battlefield. There would be no way that the experts from Acheron Palace could sneak past the various defences that Sanctuary Alliance had put in place otherwise.

Now these experts from Acheron Palace were heading towards the wormhole. They had no idea where the wormhole was, or whether the reinforcements could stop the intruders in time.

“It doesn’t matter how many I can kill, I have to try and kill some of the people from Acheron Palace,” Jian Wushuang said emotionlessly.

“All of the bastards from Acheron Palace should die!” Underworld God roared with great killing intent. His eyes were filled with anger.

Underworld God hated Acheron Palace greatly.

He hated them not just because they were part of the Three Emperors World. More importantly, they had tried to assassinate him before the Eternal Chaotic World was aware of the crisis.

When he had just broken through and become an emperor god and displayed great potential, Acheron Palace judged that there was a high possibility that he would become one of the higher-ups in the Sanctuary Alliance. Hence, they had planned an assassination once they received news that he had broken through.

For Underworld God, he barely survived the assassination. More importantly, his master, whom he respected greatly, had died in the process.

Underworld God could not forget this grudge even though years had passed.

Now he had finally broken through and become a great emperor and faced Acheron Palace once again.

“Kill! Kill them all!” Underworld God roared. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Emperor God Tian Ling and East Royal Emperor God at the side wanted to kill the experts from Acheron Palace badly.

The chase lasted half an hour. During this time, Emperor Bai arrived at the Ancient Battlefield and was finding his way to get to the experts from Acheron Palace.

The experts from Acheron Palace finally reached the space which hid the formation.

Hum!!!

The hidden formation was already operating at full force.

The camouflage was gone as it appeared in front of everyone.

There were four emperor gods in black cloaks who Demon King Chen Yu specially left behind to receive him. They were the few who activated the formation.

The wormhole was ready and the experts from Acheron Palace simply needed to step inside.

“Faster!” Demon King Chen Yu shouted as he and the other six great emperors dashed forward at their fastest speed.

The distance between the seven people and the wormhole was shortening.

“Oh no!”

The experts from Sanctuary Alliance all had black faces.

Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows tightly.

“No matter what, I have to kill some of them.” Jian Wu Shuang gritted his teeth. At his forehead were nine ancient god stars which were radiating jade-black light. Two of the topmost stars suddenly disintegrated.

Jian Wushuang casted Star Destruction Skill, and he destroyed two ancient god stars.

“Ancient God Secret Skill… Moon Picking Skill!”

Rumble~~~

Jian Wushuang’s bloodline power erupted after using Star Destruction Skill. He cast Moon Picking Skill right away using this powerful energy. The oppressive spacetime started to suppress the seven men who were running away.
