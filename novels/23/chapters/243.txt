Chapter 244: Unprecedented and Unparalleled Arrogance

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“On the 18th of the twelfth lunar month, there will be boundless white snow. At this time, demons and monsters will abound on the evil Heartless island.”

“The mountains will split asunder, the rivers will run dry, and the skies will be stained with blood as swords point towards the demon horde.”

“If the heavens favor me, it would be fortunate. However, if the heavens oppose me, there will be death!”

“With a sword in hand, I am invincible!”

These words spread out from the Raindrop Pavilion and throughout the entire Tianzong Dynasty in less than a day. Without exception, it shocked all of the top organizations in the Tianzong Dynasty. Innumerable houses were also shocked by this information.

In addition, when the young warriors heard, they burned with even more enthusiasm and their emotions surged forth!

“Haha, he’s taking up the challenge, this Jian Wushuang!”

“But, to say with a sword in hand, he is invincible! Jian Wushuang, he’s serious and quite daring!”

“Even though he knows it’s impossible, he won’t give up. This Jian Wushuang, he really lives up to his name, he really is unprecedentedly unparalleled!”

“I find myself looking more and more forward to that gathering on the 18th of the 12th lunner month!”

Everywhere, the whole Tianzong Dynasty was buzzing with discussions?about this topic.

The name Jian Wushuang had once again become a hot topic in the Tianzong Dynasty. It was impossible to avoid it and it was as if nothing else was talked about, to the extent that it even surpassed the Divine Transcendence of the Blood Feather Tower Master, Qi Luosheng.

As for the protagonist of this story, Jian Wushuang, his words began to spread from inside the Raindrop Pavilion. At this time, he had already arrived at an ordinary shop in the imperial palace of the Tianzong Dynasty. Wang Yuan had once brought him to this shop.

As Jian Wushuang stepped inside the shop, an attendant immediately came forward and invited him to the inner hall.

Inside the inner hall, he saw a purple-robed middle-aged man, with a stocky stature. This purple-robed middle-aged man was Dan Jiu.

“Mr. Dan Jiu.” Jian Wushuang had worked with Dan Jiu before, so they already knew each other.

“Master Wushuang, the young master of my house has summoned me and asked me to remain here in case you needed something. Is there, perhaps, something I can help you with?” Dan Jiu said with a laugh.

“There is something, I would like to ask eldest brother Wang Yuan for help,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“As you wish Master, I’ll pass your message onto to our house’s young master,” Dan Jiu said.

“I also need two Infinite Pure Yang Elixirs!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Infinite Pure Yang Elixirs, for breaking through to the Yang Void Realm?” Dan Jiu stared for a moment, then nodded his head and said, “Even though Infinite Pure Yang Elixirs are of the highest quality, it’s not rare in the Alchemy School. If I mention the young master’s name, I can get two of them without any difficulty. I’ll pass the message to my house’s young master immediately. I reckon that we’ll get a response in a few days.”

“A few days? That’s good, I’ll wait a few days,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded.

The same day, Dan Jiu hastily relayed the information to the Alchemy School.

The Alchemy School was situated deep in a mountain. On top of a giant mountain summit, Wang Yuan stood there with his hands behind his back. Dan Yi, clad in purple robes, stood behind him respectfully, waiting for his response.

“If the heavens favor me, it would be fortunate. However, if the heavens oppose me, there will be death!”

“Haha, third brother certainly has spunk!”

Wang Yuan laughed loudly, with a gleam in his eye. Then he turned, glanced at Dan Yi, and said, “In other words, on the 18th of next month, third brother will attack Heartless Island on his own?”

“It seems so.” Dan Yi nodded.

“Even though Blood Feather Tower isn’t important for much in the entire Nanyang Continent, for him to challenge the entire Blood Feather Tower on his own, I’m afraid it would still be fairly difficult.”

Wang Yuan’s eyes squinted, but shortly after he commanded, “Go find Third Elder immediately. Have him give you two Infinite Pure Yang Elixirs and deliver them to the Tianzong Dynasty. Tell them it’s my order. Also, give this message to Dan Jiu. Make him tell third brother that on the 18th of the twelfth lunar month, I’ll be going to the Tianzong Dynasty to help him!”

“Alright.” Dan Yi quickly responded and left immediately afterward.

Wang Yuan looked stared off into space.

“It’s a shame, the relationship between my Alchemy School and the Holy Emperor Palace is quite delicate right now. I can’t directly use the power of the Alchemy School to wipe out Blood Feather Tower. I can only depend on the Alchemy Guard I have trained, but Second Brother and Fourth Sister...”

“Second Brother, along with his master, Wine Master, came not long ago to ask my father for a Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir. Both he and Wine Master headed back towards that territory. I’m afraid that they’ll be unable to quickly return to the Tianzong Dynasty. However, shouldn’t Fourth Sister show up?” Wang Yuan muttered to himself.

One palace, one school, three valleys and four temples, eight sects, and an untold number of Dynasties.

Amongst the three valleys was the Ice Nether Valley.

“Master.” The maiden, Su Rou, clothed in black, arrived in front of a golden-robed man.

This golden-robed man’s clothes were luxurious and he had an outstanding complexion. On his face there was a smile that could make any person feel comfortable and at ease.

At first glance, each and every aspect of this golden-robed man was nearly impeccable.

“Rou, what is it?”

Seeing Su Rou walk towards him, the golden-robed man had immediately came over.

“I would like to go back to the Tianzong Dynasty,” Su Rou quietly opened her mouth and said.

“Eh?” The golden-robed man’s eyebrows lifted and he asked, “Is it because of those men you’ve become sworn brothers with?”

“Yes.” Su Rou nodded.

The Golden-robed man looked at Su Rou and immediately sensed a stubbornness in her eyes. The corners of his mouth lifted up and he said, “Go. Bring my bodyguards as well.”

“Thank you, Master,” Su Rou said as she stood up abruptly in surprise.

“Don’t worry, because this is the last time. Once this is done, you will come back, and you won’t take a single step away from my side for the following years. You will assist me with your all your might. Do you understand?” The golden-robed man said without sympathy.

“Yes,” Su Rou answered, then gritted her teeth and nodded.

Inside the Dragon Palace.

The two Palace Masters sat facing each other, one black and one white.

“Bai, are you sure you want to do this?” Palace Master Black looked at Palace Master White with a solemn look on his face.

“I’m sure.” Palace Master White had a look of determination in her eyes as she said, “that little fellow, Jian Wushuang, I’ve watched him grow ever since he entered Dragon Palace. I’ve always supported him in every way. He’s the most exceptional genius in our Dragon Palace!”

“For the meeting on the 18th, it’s obvious that there will be traps directed at him. Our Dragon Palace must have people stand up and help him. Only in this way can we be qualified to call him our disciple!”

“But...” Palace Master Black still wanted to say something.

“There’s no need to say anything, my mind is made up,” Palace Master White replied and waved her hands.

However, at that exact moment, at the edge of the hall, the palace doors suddenly opened and a golden imperial-robed man quickly rushed in. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Seeing this man, Palace Masters Black and White were both startled, and they both quickly stood up and saluted.

“Greetings, Your Majesty!”

“Both of you get up,” said Di Xi as he waved his hand and then wantonly sat down in an open seat.

“I overheard everything you just said,” Di Xi lowered his voice and said.

“Your Majesty...” Palace Master White looked at Di Xi with great anxiety.

Then Di Xi grinned and said, “I like it, go ahead.”

“Eh?” Palace Masters Black and White were both flabbergasted.

They both had originally thought Di Xi would rebuke them, but who would have thought Di Xi would unexpectedly support their decision.

“Jian Wushuang is the greatest genius of my Dragon Palace after all. For several reasons, my Dragon Palace is unable to protect him, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing we can do,” Di Xi said with great solemnity.

Palace Master White’s expression changed, then she immediately nodded her head gravely and said, “Your subordinate understands!”
