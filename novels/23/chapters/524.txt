Chapter 525: Guarding the Sky Solitude Mountains

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jin Ling!”

Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo stared at Jin Ling who had just shown up in front of them.

“I didn’t expect that we would see him here. It seems that he is in the Seventh Army as well, and since he is a Second-grade Divine General, he should also be a leader of a 100-soldier squad,” Qing Huo said quietly.

“It’s really an undesired encounter,” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Previously, Jin Ling and he had had several conflicts in the Heaven Wing City. Now, they were meeting again in the East Camp.

“Hum. ”

Jin Ling glanced at Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo and snorted, then he left.

Soon, another person emerged from the camp. That person was Fang Han.

“Fang Han commander,” Qing Huo called.

“Commander,” Jian Wushuang repeated.

“Are you Jian Wushuang?” Fang Han looked at him and nodded slightly. “From now on, you are the leader of a 100-soldier squad. Since I am your commander, you should obey my orders, do you understand?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Good. I have a task here, so I will let the tenth 100-soldier squad handle it.” Fang Han said.

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“To guard the Sky Solitude Mountains,” Fang Han said. “I will dictate the order soon. Today, you can take up the post of the 100-soldier squad and then go to the Sky Solitude Mountains.”

Without waiting for Jian Wushuang’s reaction, Fang Han returned to the camp.

Jian Wushuang was not bothered about Fang Han’s behavior. However, he noticed that Qing Huo had a strange expression on his face when he looked at him.

“Qing Huo, what’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Wushuang friend, we are so unlucky this time. We only just got here and are assigned to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains,” Qing Huo answered.

“What’s wrong with guarding the Sky Solitude Mountains?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s your first time in the East Camp, so you’re unaware,” Qing Huo continued as they walked. “The Sky Solitude Mountains is behind the East Camp. It is not at the front line, so there are few chances to fight with Demonic Beasts. They’re unlikely to attack the mountains!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The East Camp is at the front. The Demonic Beasts would need to overcome the defense of the East Camp before they can reach the Sky Solitude Mountains. But that’s almost impossible. If it does come to that, it would mean that the entire East Camp has already been destroyed!”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked slightly surprised, “So, why guard the Sky Solitude Mountains?”

“To handle the monster spies,” Qing Huo answered.

“The East Camp is huge and the east is vast. The Demonic Beasts sometimes attack the human group there. Typically, the Human Warriors from the East Camp can stop them, but a few monster spies can remain undetected.”

“Most of the monster spies would be found and killed, but a few of them can still escape and blend in with the human group. That’s why there are a few 100-soldier squads guarding the area around the Sky Solitude Mountains. Their responsibility is to wipe out all the monster spies!”

“However, these monster spies are everywhere so it’s not easy to defend against them. As the East Camp needs to focus on the attacks from Demonic Beasts, not many people can be spared to guard these places. Inevitably, some monster spies can escape from the East Camp and get into the Huaman Territory. Only a few of them would be found and killed by us.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly.

“Like the Sky Solitude Mountains, it is extremely vast and it stretches for millions of miles, but we are the only 100-soldier squad guarding that area. So what do you think about our chances of meeting the monster spies who pass by the Sky Solitude Mountains?” Qing Huo smiled bitterly.

“It stretches for millions of miles?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

It was impossible for one 100-soldier squad to guard thousands of miles of territory without letting a single monster spy sneak out.

“Does it mean we can’t see any Demonic Beasts or even monster spies when we are in the Sky Solitude Mountains?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, that’s why I just said we were so unlucky. The Sky Solitude Mountains is a desolate landscape, it is barely possible to get Monster Cores there,” Qing Huo answered with a bitter smile, “But the good news is there is a rule in the East Camp. All 100-soldier squads take turns to guard the Sky Solitude Mountain. So we will do it for one month. Next month, a new squad will take up guard there.”

“That sounds acceptable,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Jian Wushuang’s reason for joining the Military Camp was to kill the Demonic Beasts and get Monster Cores.

Obviously, he would not want to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains where the chances of seeing a Demonic Beast were remote.

If he had to stay in the Sky Solitude Mountains all the time, he would prefer to be a guard in the Holy Place or in the Eight Cities. It would be more comfortable and easier.

Soon, Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo arrived at the camp of the tenth 100-soldier squad.

As soon as they knew their leader had arrived, the 100-soldier squad immediately gathered at the open space.

The quality of the East Camp’s 100-soldier squads had always been very good. Even ordinary sergeants at the lowest level were at Six-cloud Realm and were superior lords in the Divine Land. And the leaders of 10-soldier squads were designated First-grade Divine Generals.

“My name is Jian Wushuang and from now on I’m your leader,” Jian Wushuang introduced himself simply. The sergeants adopted an air of humility towards Jian Wushuang as he was a Second-grade Divine General.

A 100-soldier squad was made up of ten 10-soldier squads. Each 100-soldier squad also had a Monster Discriminator.

The Monster Discriminator was the only one who could recognize the monster spies.

In less than half a day, Jian Wushuang had familiarized himself with the squad leaders in his command. That night, they went to the Sky Solitude Mountains.

When they arrived at the Sky Solitude Mountains, Jian Wushuang met the leader who was standing guard there.

“It seems strange that the commander has assigned you to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains now, because we have been here for less than ten days,” the leader said.

Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised but he didn’t really care.

“Anyway, only one month, I could stay here for one month,”??Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

With their caliber, one month was not that long.

Jian Wushuang and his sergeants were all patient and began the task in the Sky Solitude Mountains.
