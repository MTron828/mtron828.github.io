“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang harrumphed coldly while his Blood Mountain Sword let out a shrill whistle.

The sword light instantly burst out along with boundless Reincarnation Power. The stroke was Reincarnation Sword Principle, the sixth move!

It was also the most powerful stroke among Reincarnation Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang had created.

Under the trigger of Jian Wushuang’s fierce divine power and bloodline power, the power of the stroke was extremely terrifying.

Clang!

The sound of metal clanged and Jian Wushuang took a few steps back from the impact.

Just as he retreated, hong. A boundless bloodline aura spread and Jian Wushuang’s figure suddenly increased in size and instantly turned into black jade colors. Simultaneously, there were heads and arms extending from his body.

Ancient tribe body revealed itself with seven heads and fourteen arms. Jian Wushuang’s fighting power suddenly reached its peak.

“Die!”

The four Hong Jun Golden Swords flew out with ferocious sword intention while Jian Wushuang’s fourteen arms wielded a sword each and attacked.

The boatman in black wasn’t afraid and swung out his black saber continuously. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There were vigorous clashes of blades in the void. Jian Wushuang had already given full play to his swordsmanship and his close combat skill in collaboration with an intense attack of Hong Jun Golden Sword.

Even so, the boatman in black was responding rather at ease.

“Sword Emperor, compared to when you fought with Palace Master Wu Luo from Abysmal Palace a thousand years ago, your swordsmanship has improved tremendously,” the boatman in black smiled and his figure suddenly became creepy.

Just like the reflection in the mirror, he appeared in three different places in the void. When Jian Wushuang swept out his consciousness and located the boatman in black, the latter appeared next to him.

Then, the black saber was swept at him again. The darkness was as usual and the power was soaring.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang was pushed out by the impact.

After Jian Wushuang steadied himself, his cold eyes locked onto the boatman in black as his face grew solemn.

“This person is so strong!”

Strong, he was really strong!

One should know that, a thousand years ago, Jian Wushuang had collaborated his close combat skills with his Hong Jun Golden Swords and he had matched evenly with Luo Xianzi, who was in the twenty-first place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. After a thousand years of cultivation in Emperor Sword Palace, Jian Wushuang had improved tremendously in Sword Principle and his overall power.

Then, he was stronger than he had been a thousand years ago.

But in the end, when he gave full play to his Sword Principle, close combat skill and Hong Jun Golden Swords, he still had the lower hand.

“The boatman in black, who exactly is he?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He was sure that the boatman in black wasn’t a Great Emperor but an Emperor God expert.

He was definitely not on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. However, his power among all Emperor Gods on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list should definitely be in the top three, or even second to Underworld God. If the grey fog wasn’t dispersed by Jian Wushuang forcefully, the boatman in black would be able to fight with Underworld God with the existence of grey fog.

He was definitely a terrifying existence.

“He doesn’t exist on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Could he be from Holocaust Sect of Acheron Palace?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but ask.

Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace were hidden. Their experts almost never revealed themselves. Hence, Sanctuary Alliance didn’t know much about the experts that the two dark forces had.

If it was said that the boatman in black was from Holocaust Sect of Acheron Palace, it was possible.

Then, the boatman in black looked at Jian Wushuang.

“The infamous Sword Emperor is really not weak. Even I will have to pay a price if I want to kill you.”

Just as he spoke, the boatman in black suddenly flipped his hand and took out a creepy black pearl.

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of the black pearl.

The boatman in black had already squashed the black pearl. The pearl broke and dark energy that struck fear even into Jian Wushuang soared up. The dark energy concentrated on the black saber under the control of the boatman in black.

“Die!”

The boatman in black took action.

He swung out his black saber.

Suddenly, the universe was engulfed in boundless darkness. In the dark, a resplendent light shined.

The light was too bright.

It was definitely one of the brightest lights Jian Wushuang had seen.

And its speed was unbelievably fast.

The moment it was swung out, it appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. He who wanted to withstand it by performing Eight Divine Mountain wouldn’t have a chance either.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s face grew red while four out of his fourteen arms flowed with billowing divine power and wielded the swords.

The four sword shadows collided with the light.

Clang. A terrifying power traveled and almost instantly, the four swords in the four arms flew off.

But the power of the light didn’t decrease and hit Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Poof!”

Jian Wushuang spat a mouthful of blood while Jian Wushuang’s body retreated tens of thousands of miles away before he regained stability.

After Jian Wushuang steadied himself, he suddenly lifted his head, “A Great Emperor’s hit?”

Without a doubt, the power of the light earlier had already surpassed an Emperor God’s power.

It definitely had reached the level of a Great Emperor. It was equal to a Great Emperor’s hit.

Hence, it could throw Jian Wushuang’s sword away and continue to injure Jian Wushuang.

The boatman in black squinted his eyes, “He didn’t die?”

A Great Emperor’s hit was enough to kill an Emperor God easily. That was definite.

On Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, among all Emperor Gods, only two could withstand a Great Emperor’s hit but not die.

But then, Jian Wushuang had done it.

“It seems like your armor was no ordinary Chaotic Divine Treasure,” the boatman in black glanced at the crimson armor on Jian Wushuang.

He knew that the reason why Jian Wushuang could withstand the hit was because of the armor.

Jian Wushuang himself admitted that.

His divine power could be compared to an Emperor God’s favorably and in addition to his ancient tribe bloodline, his divine power was impressive. However, to block the earlier hit like a Great Emperor’s hit with his defense body, it was impossible. But he had Five Gem Armor!

As the only treasure that ancient tribe expert from ancient times, Wu Hun, had left for him, although it was broken, his defense power was still terrifying. Like the Great Emperor hit earlier, its power was diminished by ninety percent after Five Gem Armor. With only the remaining power left, it naturally couldn’t kill him.

“As a Great Emperor hit couldn’t kill you, it seems that I can’t do anything about you.”

“Sword Emperor, you’re lucky this time. We shall meet again.”

Just as he said that, the boatman in black floated to the far-off void.
