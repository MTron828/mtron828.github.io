Chapter 1486: Look For Someone

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

There was a huge threshold between Universe God in the Third Heaven and Real God.

Unlike leveling up to Universe God in the Second Heaven from the Firth Heaven. When the time came, it’d happen when one passed the God’s Test.

There were many Universe Gods in the Third Heaven in Eternal Chaotic World. Even in a smaller world, they could give birth to Universe God in Third Heaven and more than one of them.

However, Real Gods… compared to Universe Gods, there were much lesser Real Gods.

Countless Universe Gods would stop at the level of Universe Gods in the Third Heaven for their entire life.

Under such conditions, it was normal that the number of disciples of Lineage of Star who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven would be more than Universe Gods in the First and Second Heaven.

“Because there are too many disciples who are Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, the fight is the most vigorous, especially to fight for the quota as disciples of Star Palace,” Ling Feibai explained, “Then, among the disciples of Lineage of Star who are Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, the top two are listed in Universe God ranking list!”

“Besides the two of them, the others who are close to having fighting power like one on the Universe God ranking list, and even those who have fighting power like one on the Universe God ranking list, are almost a dozen of them. The duration that I’ve been a Universe God in the Third Heaven is too short. In terms of power, I might not be in the top twenty among the disciples.”

“You mean, when the fight for the quota as disciple of Star Palace starts, I might not be able to retain my position as a disciple of Star Palace?”

Jian Wushuang was quiet.

Ling Feibai was a genius through and through. However, it was a short time since he had broken through and become a Universe God in the Third Heaven. His power had yet to increase to its extreme limit. He still couldn’t fight against the genius disciples who had been trapped at the level of Universe God in the Third Heaven for many years.

“With your gifted talent, even if you became an ordinary disciple, when the next fight comes, you can easily take it back, no?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“That’s true,” Ling Feibai nodded with confidence, “Alright, I shall leave first. I have business to attend to.”

Ling Feibai left very quickly.

Jian Wushuang continued to walk forward but his facial expression grew strange.

“Battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace?”

“If Ling Feibai didn’t remind me, I would have forgotten about it.”

“However, with my current power, I might play the bully if I were to participate the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace.”

Jian Wushuang laughed from the bottom of his heart. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Four thousand years ago, when he had first passed his Inverse Cultivation Test in the Second Heaven and comprehended a slight bit of power of reincarnation, he had fought against an expert on Universe God ranking list, Zhao Han. Back then, his fighting power wasn’t much weaker than Zhao Han’s.

Then, after he went through four thousand years of training in Sky Sword Prison, his power had increased tremendously.

Previously, Hall Master Yuan never once see him when he launched his full power. He merely heard about him killing ten Real Gods in Sky Sword Prison and determined that he possessed the fighting power of the top thirty on Universe God ranking list.

One should know that the two most outstanding people from the disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, their ranking on Universe God ranking list was not in the top forties. Hence, neither were Jian Wushuang’s match.

Hence, Jian Wushuang felt like a bully to participle the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace with the other Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

“The current me, in Lineage of Star, or even Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, already stands steadily on my feet. Plus, I have many resources to hand, I can go and do that now.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes gave out a gleam.

…

Vientiane Tower, also known for covering all manifestations of the universe.

Its force covered every single corner of Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

In the secret room of Vientiane Tower on Star land, Jian Wushuang sat in his crimson robe with a sword on his back. There was tea served before him too.

“I wonder what Vientiane Tower can do for you?” A purple-haired elderly stood before Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“I want you,Vientiane Tower, to look for someone for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Look for someone?” The purple-haired elderly was surprised.

“I know Vientiane Tower does all kinds of deals. Looking for someone should be one of the deals, right?” Jian Wushuang lifted his head to look at the purple-haired elderly.

“Of course. In Vientiane Tower, as long you can afford to pay, there’s nothing Vientiane Tower cannot do for you,” the purple-haired elderly smiled faintly and then asked, “I wonder what’s the name of the person you’re looking for and where is he from?”

“Her name is Leng Ruxue, or maybe Leng Rushuang. She’s a lady from Snow Kingdom, an ordinary Eternal World. She only arrived in Eternal Chaotic World in the past recent ten thousand years,” Jian Wushuang said.

“The level of her power?” The purple-haired elderly asked.

“I don’t know,” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “Maybe a Universe God, also she may have broken through and became Real God.”

“You don’t know the level of her power?” The purple-haired elderly thought and continued to ask, “Do you know the person’s other characteristics?”

“And… she’s an inborn sinner!” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“What?” The purple-haired man’s face changed and immediately creased his eyebrows.

“Why, is there a problem?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, a little,” the purple-haired elderly nodded, “You should know that inborn sinners represent calamity. The experts in Eternal Chaotic World deep-seated hatred against inborn sinners, not much better than Holocaust Sect. Hence, as long as the inborn sinners aren’t stupid, they will intentionally hide their identity and they will keep a low profile. They won’t even use their name. Hence, it’ll be rather difficult for us to look for them.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly. He knew what the purple-haired elderly said was true.

After Leng Ruxue (Leng Rushuang) left Green Fire World, theoretically, she should first depart to Dayu World.

However, when Jian Wushuang was wandering in Dayu World, he once requested for the overlord of Dayu World, Dayu Palace and Scarlet Island to search for Leng Ruxue’s carefully. However, after the search, there found no trace.

Over the years, he had been looking for ways to find Leng Ruxue’s whereabouts, but he had achieved nothing.

He knew that it wasn’t easy to look for Leng Ruxue. Hence, he had came to Vientiane Tower.

In the entire Eternal Chaotic World, he reckoned that only Vientiane Tower had the ability to look for Leng Ruxue for him.

“Vientiane Tower is also known to be formidable. No matter how well she has hidden, you should be able to find her,” Jian Wushuang stared at the purple-haired elderly as he spoke.

“That’s true,” the purple-haired elderly smiled, “However, to find a person who has tried all ways to hide her identity in the boundless Eternal Chaotic World and without the knowledge of the inborn sinner’s power level, it is really not easy. Hence, the payment required is extremely expensive.”

“How much?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“One billion Chaos Gems. Vientiane Tower can guarantee that we will find Leng Ruxue’s whereabouts in ten thousand years time!” The purple-haired elderly said with full confidence.

“Ten thousand years?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “Ten thousand years, is a little too long.”
