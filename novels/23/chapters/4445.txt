4448 Meeting Cosmos God Again

“We’re here.”

Lan Su stopped and smiled.

“Everyone, our campsite is right in front.”

Hearing this, everyone could not help but look at each other, their faces full of curiosity.

!!

From time to time, Supreme experts could be seen walking around in a hurry. Among them, there were many Supreme with weak auras and injured divine bodies.

“Eh? Was that Supreme Bi An? Didn’t he disappear for hundreds of chaos cycles?”

“And that person over there… is he the once famous Supreme Qian Fang? The entire universe thought he had fallen, I didn’t expect him to be in the Offworld Battlefield wars the entire time!”

“The one whose divine body was on the verge of being shattered just now was Supreme Cangwu, right? Back then, when Supreme Cangwu was at his peak, he was actually injured so severely here.”

“It seems like the Void Warriors of the Void Universe are not easy to deal with.”

Everyone’s faces could not help but surge with a serious expression.

At this moment, a Primary Supreme realm divine general rushed over and cupped his hands, “Lord Lan Su, Cosmos God has been waiting in the main hall for a long time. He ordered me to bring all of you to the main hall to hear the announcement the moment I see you.”

“Yes!” Lan Su did not dare to delay. He quickly led Jian Wushuang and the others toward the main hall.

In the main hall, Cosmos God sat on the main seat. However, he appeared much more exhausted than he had been during the Universe Great Clan Gathering.

When Jian Wushuang saw Cosmos God again this time, he had more respect for him.

If not for Cosmos God’s efforts to turn the tide back then, the entire universe would have been destroyed by the Void Warriors of the Void Universe.

Furthermore, over the past tens of thousands of chaos cycles, Cosmos Gods had been stationed in the Offworld Battlefield while teaching others without discrimination, nurturing a large number of experts within the universe. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It could be said that a large part of the reason why the entire universe could be so stable today was due to Cosmos God.

“We pay our respects to Lord Cosmos God!”

The eleven Supreme martial artists all knelt on the ground and cupped their hands.

“No need to be so polite.” Cosmos God chuckled and stretched out his hand to support them. Instantly, a gentle force gushed out and helped everyone up.

Following that, Cosmos God surveyed the crowd and said, “I believe everyone has some understanding of the Void Universe by now, right?”

The crowd muttered and nodded.

“Well, I won’t go into detail about the Void Universe. I’ll tell you about the situation in the Offworld Battlefield first.”

At this point, Cosmos God’s face turned solemn. With a wave of his right hand, an image appeared out of thin air and was displayed before everyone.

In this scene.

A 30-foot-long crack in the void stood in the void like a pair of mysterious doors.

Countless monsters with terrifying appearances crawled out of the cracks in the void while roaring.

Some of these monsters had three heads and six arms, some had tails and huge mouths, and some had eyes all over their bodies.

Their auras were completely different from Jian Wushuang and the other ordinary Supremes, but their strength far exceeded that of Supremes of the same realm.

Outside the crack, a team of Supreme experts led by an Invincible Supreme cultivator was fighting against these monsters.

The battle was extremely tragic!

From time to time, Supreme experts could be seen dying. The famous Supreme experts who usually acted tyrannically in the depths of the universe were dying like raindrops on the battlefield.

No one retreated, no one was afraid, and everyone fought to the last moment.

The hall was completely silent. Before coming here, no one would have thought that the Offworld Battlefield would be so tragic.

“5,000 years ago, for some unknown reason, the crack in the void suddenly became bigger, and a large number of cultivators of the void poured out. These cultivators of the void didn’t fight on their own like before, but instead gathered together. If I’m not wrong, they can move freely. They should be from a force in the Void Universe under the command of one person.”

Cosmos God said in a deep voice, his eyes filled with solemness.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly.

According to what Cosmos God said, the attacking Void Warriors of the Void Universe were from a single sect. It was not difficult to deduce that the power of the opposite universe far exceeded their imagination.

After all, they had gathered all the top forces in the universe to defend against the Void Universe’s attack.

In other words, this universe could only compete with one sect in the void universe?

Seeing the change in everyone’s expressions, Cosmos God continued, “That’s not all. The main thing is that the crack is getting bigger and bigger. I’m afraid it won’t be long before the crack opens completely and forms a passage. At that time, I’m afraid that the Void Universe on the other side will attack us with all its troops. If we fail in this defence, the entire universe will fall into a catastrophe!”

Hiss!

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

One of the Supreme martial artists asked, “Lord Cosmos God, could it be that even you are unable to exterminate these Void Warriors?”

Cosmos God glanced at him and said in a deep voice, “Three thousand years ago, a huge black arm bound by chains stretched out from the crack in the void. I exchanged a blow with the black arm. Although I forced it back, I could sense that the owner of the black arm was not much weaker than me. In fact, they might even be on par with me.”

As soon as these words were spoken, it was undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire in everyone’s hearts.

Even Jian Wushuang’s face was extremely solemn.

Looking at everyone’s nervous expressions, Cosmos God could not help but chuckle. “Of course, things are not beyond salvation. All we need to do now is to resist the attack of the Void Universe, and I’ll look for the Heaven-Suppressing Divine Flag, one of the Seven Supreme Great Ancestral Weapons. Once I find the Heaven-Suppressing Divine Flag, there’s a high chance that I’ll be able to seal the crack in the void completely.”

“Alright, you all know the situation in the Offworld Battleground. Remember, don’t spread what I just said. Otherwise, the universe will get shocked and people will panic. Before the people of the Void Universe even attacks, our universe will collapse on its own.”

After Cosmos God finished speaking, he turned to Lan Su and instructed, “Lan Su, now you will separate them and put them into the nine teams. They will be under the command of the nine teams.”

“Yes, this disciple will do as you command.”

Lan Su quickly cupped her hands and nodded. She led Jian Wushuang and the other 11 Supreme experts to join the nine teams in the camp.

In the Offworld Battlefield, Cosmos God was in charge of the overall situation. He was in charge of the base camp, and there were a total of nine teams under him.

Each team was led by an Invincible Supreme, and there were two Vice-Captains under the captain.

...

The two Vice-Captains were usually Half Invincible Supreme experts or Top Supreme experts.

Lan Su led the group and broke them up, joining the nine teams.

Jian Wushuang was assigned to Team 7.
