Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Mister Zhao Han!”

Looking at the person in the crimson robe walk out from the scarlet spaceship, the dozen experts that were waiting on the island bowed politely, except for one.

The cold-looking young man in the crimson robe overlooked everyone on the island. Then, he shook and suddenly appeared before the Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven that never bowed.

“Pang Bo, long time no see. You’re here too?” The young man, Zhao Han, said with a smile.

The person who was called Pang Bo was a brawny, middle-aged man who was more than two meters tall. The brawny, middle-aged man carried a green saber on his back and his figure looked bold and strong, with a tinge of imposing manner. Hearing what Zhao Han said, Pang Bo replied coldly, “There’s some trouble. Otherwise, there would be no need for you to be here.”

“What kind of trouble? Even you, an expert who is extremely close to the standard of Universe God ranking list, can’t deal with it?” Zhao Han smiled.

“The enemy is suspected to have fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list,” Pang Bo replied.

“Oh?” Zhao Han squinted his eyes.

Being extremely close to the standard of Universe God ranking list and suspected to have fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list, obviously something unusual was happening.

“Tell me, what’s going on?” Zhao Han asked.

“As you are invited by the Chu Sect, you naturally know the aim of the mission and the person that we are going to kill. Although he isn’t strong, he hired some experts to escort him. Among the experts, Hong Ri Mercenary Group is just a mercenary group after all. You can ignore them. However, when they were in Floating City, he called for extra help. The help’s name is Jian Ke,” Pang Bo said.

“Jian Ke? Who can’t tell that that’s an alias?” Zhao Han smirked, “It’s this Jian Ke who is suspected to have fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list?”

“Yes,” Pang Bo nodded, “Not long ago, Jian Ke and the rest of them encountered the bandits from Hei Longshan in the boundless void.”

“Hei Longshan?” Zhao Han looked surprised, “I happen to have been training in the boundless void for a while now and I’ve heard about Hei Longshan. It is said that Hei Longshan has hundreds of thousands of bandits. Among them were quite a few Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, there are even a few Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. They also have the ten Kings, which is quite well known.”

“That’s right. Whichever troops want to go through the boundless void, as long as they meet with Hei Longshan,will definitely experience a nightmare. There is almost no one who could escape under the watch of Hei Longshan. Jian Ke and the troop met Hei Longshan in the boundless void, supposedly, and things seemed bad. In the end…” Pang Bo creased his eyebrows.

“Why? Unless they escaped through Hei Longshan’s hands?” Zhao Yu joked casually.

“They didn’t escape but they defeated Hei Longshan wantonly with thunderous measures,” Pang Bo said.

“What?” Zhao Han’s face suddenly grew grave.

He had been training in the boundless void for quite some time. Initially, he intended to make trouble for Hei Longshan as he had heard of Hei Longshan’s power.

He knew clearly how great one’s power must be to be able to defeat Hei Longshan wantonly.

“Would it be that the one they encountered wasn’t the main force of Hei Longshen, but just a partial section of the experts?” Zhao Han couldn’t help but ask.

“No, they met the main force led by Hei Longshan’s leader. On top of that, Hei Longshan launched their full force. There was a total of tens of thousands of Universe Gods and inclusive of the ten Kings were involved in the action. But in the end, they were killed and defeated. The leader of Hei Longshan and the ten Kings all died. The person who causes that to happen is Jian Ke!” Pong Bo said solemnly.

“You meant that Jian Ke alone killed the ten Kings from Hei Longshan and their leaders in front of the Universe Gods from Hei Longshan?” Zhao Han asked.

“Yes, the ten Kings from Hei Longshan already gave their all and they even made a formation. But, in the end, Jian Ke defeated them directly,” Pang Bo said.

Then, even Zhao Han had a glimpse of shock in his eyes.

“The ten Kings from Hei Longshan, the moment they united and formed their formation, it is said that only one who possesses power like one on Universe God ranking list could be evenly matched. But Jian Ke could defeat the formation directly. His power shouldn’t be weak. However, it doesn’t mean that he possesses fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list,” Zhao Han smiled.

“Doesn’t it?” Pang Bo was stunned.

“Fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list isn’t something easily achievable. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be only a hundred of them,” Zhao Han smiled, “In the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, how many are like you, extremely close to the standard of one on Universe God ranking list and how many are suspected to have fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list? There is a countless number of them, but among these people, how many could really be evenly matched with experts on Universe God ranking list?”

“For example, fifty thousand years ago, a genius disciple from East Royal Sanctuary, Ye Han, was naturally gifted and he defeated many experts who were close to the standard of one on Universe God ranking list. He was recognized as being suspected of having fighting power like one on theUniverse God ranking list. But in the end, when he really came across an expert on Universe God ranking list and the expert was only on the ninety-third place, considered the bottom of the list, what happen then?”

“With just three moves, Ye Han was defeated, heavily defeated, without a chance to struggle.”

‘Hence, whoever has yet to fight against an expert on Universe God ranking list will not be qualified to be recognized as suspected to have fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list.”

“Just like the ten Kings from Hei Longshan. They said that no one without the fighting power of one on the Universe God ranking list could fight evenly with them once they were in their formation. But, in actual fact, have they fought with an expert on Universe God ranking list before? Do they know how strong an expert on the Universe God ranking list is?”

Zhao Han looked like he didn’t care.

Well, that’s true. In the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, there were many that were said to be suspected to have fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list but they were actually far from the real experts on the Universe God ranking list. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Jian Ke and the troop are still in the boundless void?” Zhao Han asked again.

“Yes. Our people are among their troop. We know of their location,” Pang Bo replied.

“If so, let’s get into action. Let’s meet with this person that you said to be suspected to have fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list, Jian Ke,” Zhao Han scoffed.

“With you involving yourself personally, there shouldn’t be any unexpected events,” Pang Bo smiled faintly.

The Universe Gods at the side were absolutely confident in Mister Zhao Han.

Forget about the fact that Jian Ke might possess fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list. Even if he did, they believed that Mister Zhao Han could easily seize control of him.

After all, Mister Zhao Han became an expert of the Universe God ranking list in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries long ago, and he wasn’t too low on the list!

Without much preparation, Zhao Han and Pang Bo led a dozen Universe Gods onto the delicate scarlet spaceship. Then, they plunged towards where Jian Wushuang and the troop were.
