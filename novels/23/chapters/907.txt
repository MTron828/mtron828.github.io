Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat alone observing the changes in his body.

In the Heaven-defying Four Steps of the Heavenly Creation Skill, each step forward could bring a qualitative change. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The first step was the Heaven-treading Realm. It had given Jian Wushuang an incredible degree of perception and talent.

The second step was the Deification Realm. It had given him extraordinary limitless battle strength. This was the reason he could fight with a Dao Master when he was only a Divine Realm expert.

The step he had entered now was the third step, the Everlasting Realm.

The Everlasting Realm was similar to the Eternal Realm for ordinary warriors.

At this step, the Heavenly Creation Skill gave Jian Wushuang an unprecedented life-saving ability!

“In the Everlasting Realm, I become immortal??” Jian Wushuang showed an expression of ecstasy.

He already felt the change in his body. When he reached this step, his body had become completely different.

He could clearly feel that every part of his body, his flesh, blood, even every single cell, seemed to be an independent life with exuberant vitality. Even if these parts separated from his body, they would still survive for a long time, and the body could live through them.

In this step, unless his body was ruined completely with nothing left, Jian Wushuang would not die.

If Jian Wushuang was more knowledgeable, he could hide a part of his body in a safe place. In this way, he could use it to recover even he was killed in a dangerous situation in the future.

The Everlasting Realm!

A real immortal body.

“Inverse Cultivation is truly amazing. One can be immortal when they’ve only reached the Eternal Realm,” the Gu King said. Like a parasite in Jian Wushuang’s body, the Gu King could feel the change in his body and knew his new ability.

Even the Gu King couldn’t help but be shocked.

“Immortal!”

Jian Wushuang was delighted but shook his head immediately. “Unfortunately, this ability only exists in this step. If I become a Dao Master in the future, this ability will be impaired. It will be impossible to ever be immortal again.”

After figuring out this step, Jian Wushuang started to explore his strength carefully.

Stepping from the Deification Realm into the Everlasting Realm was just like a normal cultivator stepping from the Divine Realm into the Eternal Realm. Naturally, his strength would be greatly improved. As an Inverse Cultivator, Jian Wushuang’s improvement was even greater.

“There has been great improvement in all aspects of my strength and body.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and felt the power gather. He was at least a dozen times stronger than he had been when he was in the Divine Realm.

His strength was now far beyond the limit of the Eternal Realm.

Moreover, by breaking through the Realm, he was able to improve several of his Secret Skills.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes again to cultivate the Star-river Secret Skill of the Ancient God Clan.

There were 34 levels of the Star-river Secret Skill. Jian Wushuang had reached the 15th level when he was in the Divine Realm. This was far beyond what normal Divine Realm experts could do.

His Secret Skill level would naturally be higher now.

Jian Wushuang reached the 16th level of the Star-river Secret Skill very easily, then the 17th, the 18th, and the 19th levels…

Three days passed quickly.

After three days, Jian Wushuang finally reached his limit in how far he could cultivate the Star-river Secret Skill. He had attained the 24th level of the Star-river Secret Skill!

After cultivating nine Secret Skill levels in one go, his power had increased 27 times. Adding in the 45 from before, Jian Wushuang’s power was now 72 times that of a normal expert.

Jian Wushuang was sure that it was absolutely comparable to or even stronger than the power of a normal Dao Master.

“With my strength, I no longer need to fear a Dao Master,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“It is common for people to treat the Inverse Cultivation of an Eternal Realm expert as a Dao Master. The strength of the two levels is comparable, ” the Gu king said, his voice sounding in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

He knew that before he’d broken through, he had been able to fight with ordinary Dao Masters. Now, after breaking through the Realm, his strength had skyrocketed. Naturally his battle strength was stronger.

Jian Wushuang began to cultivate the Immortality Secret Skill.

When he was in the Ancient World, he had gotten the Immortality Secret Skill, a Secret Skill for the body. His body was already very strong. With this breakthrough, he quickly advanced to the Fourth level of the Secret Skill, Divine Body Technique.

His body became more tenacious and strong.

Jian Wushuang finally came out of the secret chamber.

As soon as he came out, Wang Yuan called him

In a meeting hall.

“Third Brother, you have finally finished your cultivation. Your Senior Brother has been waiting for you for half a month,” Wang Yuan said.

“Senior Brother?” Jian Wushuang was confused. Then he noticed a young man sitting on a chair in the meeting hall. He had long, blood-red hair, it looked like he had bathed in a sea of blood.

…

The young man was his Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian.

“Junior Brother, how’s everything going?” Xue Lingtian asked with a smile.

“Senior Brother, how did you know I was here?” Jian Wushuang asked, walking toward Xue Lingtian.

“Someone brought me. Look,” Xue Lingtian said, pointing to the opposite side.

Only then did Jian Wushuang notice that there was another man sitting in the meeting hall. He was quite mysterious, enveloped in a black robe so that Jian Wushuang could not see his face clearly.

The man raised his head slightly. At the same time, laughter came slowly out from under his black robe.

“Long time no see, Jian Wushuang.”

“Long time no see?” Jian Wushuang wrinkled his eyebrows and looked at the man.

When he saw the man’s thin, old face, Jian Wushuang trembled in shock.

“Senior Di Jing, is that you?”
