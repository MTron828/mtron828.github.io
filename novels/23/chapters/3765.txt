Chapter 3766: Ruler Level

“No, no, master, you’ve misunderstood. A Ruler who has fused five principles is only a second-level Chaos Ruler. He is far from the ultimate level,” Devil Flame said.

“Far from it?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “Devil Flame, explain clearly.”

“Master, it’s like this. In the vast universe, the level of Chaos Ruler is mostly determined by the number of rules fused. The most ordinary Ruler is a Ruler who has fused four rules. In the universe, such Rulers are called the first-level Rulers!”

“Rulers at this level are the most mediocre and ordinary Rulers in the vast universe. Any third-grade astral world can produce many Rulers like them, but from the second-grade onwards, it is not that simple.”

The Devil Flame Soul Body began to explain.

“Master, you should also be clear that although the laws of heaven and earth are far from the principles of the universe, under the premise that the laws of the universe and the Chaos Rulers are unable to touch upon the principles of the universe, the degree of comprehension and mastery of the principles of heaven and earth is still very important. Furthermore, although it is relatively easy to comprehend the principles of Heaven and earth, it is not difficult to completely comprehend a single principle.”

“Especially after breaking through to the Ruler level, one’s sense of the principles of the world will become even stronger, and the speed of comprehension will be much easier than when one is at the Ruler level. However, the fusion between the principles is still extremely difficult.”

“After all, the principleshave their own characteristics. Just fusing two laws together is very difficult, but fusing three, four, or even more laws together is ten times and ten times more difficult. Many people struggle to fuse four laws together and break through to become Rulers, but this is already their limit. They will never be able to fuse a fifth principle in their entire lives. Thus, they will always be Rulers of the first level.”

“In the vast universe, there are the most first-level Rulers. 99 of the 100 Rulers are only first-level Rulers.”

“The second-level Rulers have fused five principles, so there are fewer of them.”

“Of course, even the second-level Rulers are still far inferior to the final-level Rulers because many of the Rulers who can be called final-level Rulers have fused nine principles.” The Devil Flame Soul Body paused.

...

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was a little confused.

“Devil Flame, did you just say that an Ultimate Ruler has fused nine rules?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

It was indeed very difficult to fuse principles. He knew this very well.

After all, he had only fused four principles. He was still far from fusing the fourth principle and reaching the threshold of becoming a Ruler. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

But fusing nine principles was too far away for him.

What shocked Jian Wushuang was that the principles could fuse nine principles?

“Nine is in the heaven and earth realm. No matter who it is, the limit is to fuse nine principles. That’s why it’s called the ultimate. As for those who fuse more than six principles...for example, Rulers who fuse six principles are called third-level Rulers in the universe.”

“Those who fuse seven principles are the Rulers of the fourth level.”

“Those who fuse eight principles are the Rulers of the fifth level.”

“In the vast universe, the Rulers of the fifth level are already considered top-tier experts. They can easily occupy a second-level astral world or even a smaller Star Field. As for the Ultimate Rulers, as long as they don’t go to the deepest part of the universe, the most prosperous place with the most experts, they can easily become an overlord.”

“For example, I used to be an overlord in a certain region of the universe for a period of time. I ruled five Star Fields under my command. Later on, because I was too bored, I went to the deepest part of the universe, which was the most prosperous place, to explore. I accidentally provoked a strong enemy, and his divine body was destroyed by the enemy. Only my soul was lucky enough to escape. In the end, by chance, I entered the gourd and fell into a deep sleep.”

Jian Wushuang could not help smacking his lips.

He had heard that Devil Flame said he was an Ultimate Ruler, but he did not think much of it. After all, he had come into contact with an autarch before.

However, he did not expect that an Ultimate Ruler would be so powerful. He could easily rule several Star Fields and become an overlord.

“Devil Flame, you said that you have provoked a strong enemy. That strong enemy should be an autarch, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No, not a Supreme Being.” Devil Flame shook his head. “What kind of person is a Supreme Being? Even in the deepest part of the universe, he is still a top-tier existence. I don’t have the courage to provoke a super-expert of that level. Moreover, if I really provoked a Supreme Being, how could my soul have a chance to escape?”

“Not a Supreme Being? Could it be that the one who destroyed your divine body was also a Ruler of the ultimate realm?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Devil Flame nodded. “But he was also an Ultimate Ruler, but he was much stronger than me. In fact, he was on a completely different level.”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

They were both Ultimate Rulers, so why did Devil Flame say that they were on a different level?

.

“Not only did he integrate the nine principles, but more importantly, he also comprehended a trace of the universe principles!”

Devil Flame’s voice was a little cold, “The universe principles is something that only supreme experts are qualified to be involved in. However, that guy has actually comprehended a trace of it. Even though it’s just a trace, his strength has reached a whole new level. He can be said to be a half-step supreme expert.”

“When I fought with him, I was completely crushed by him. I didn’t even have a chance to fight back. If I didn’t react fast enough, my soul might not have been able to escape from his hands.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

He knew how terrifying the universe principles were.

And just as he had expected, even a Ruler had the opportunity to comprehend the universe principles. It was just a matter of whether he had the talent and comprehension ability.

“Devil Flame, let me ask you again. What is this Blood-Red Gourd?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This gourd is actually not a treasure, but its material is very special. It can shield the soul of an ordinary Ruler from detection. At that time, my divine body was destroyed, and even my soul was severely damaged. I was at a loss when I saw this gourd, so I immediately ran into it and used it to hide my soul aura. Not long after that, I fell into a deep sleep.”

“As for what happened after that, I don’t know. I also don’t know how I came to this Star Field,” said Devil Flame.
