Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I have reached the Nine-cloud Realm, so my strength has improved to an unbelievable level. However, it’s hard to determine the exact level my power has reached.”?As Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, he could tell that his strength was much greater than before.

However, he was not?clear about how much more powerful he was.

Hence, what he needed most was to find a strong opponent to battle with so that he could judge how strong he was now.

Ordinary Human Temple Masters or Monster Kings were not strong enough for this.

However, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, who was currently standing in front of Jian Wushuang, was strong enough to test his strength, so he would not waste this chance.

“Sword Emperor.” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor said, “You just said you would give me the compass if I can defeat you?”

“Right.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Haha!!!”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor laughed wilfully. Then, with fire burning in his eyes, he said, “Hum! You humans are getting more and more arrogant. How dare you fight with me with strength that is only in the Cloud Realm! Since you are determined though, I’ll do as you wish!”

“Sword Emperor. Go ahead! I’m right here. I’ll even give you three moves so that you can’t say I’m bullying you.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor stood in the air with his hands behind his back, looking down at Jian Wushuang from above. In his mind, Jian Wushuang’s level of strength was not worth mentioning.

That was true.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was quite famous, and he was capable of looking down on the human Temple Masters, even the experts at the level of Iceberg Temple Master Iceberg, let alone someone like Jian Wushuang who had only reached the Cloud Realm.

“You’ll give me three moves?” Jian Wushuang asked with a strange expression on his face.

“Very well then, be careful.”

Jian Wushuang reminded his opponent out of goodwill as the Heart-killing Sword appeared in his hand.

As a mighty power surged forth, the Heart-killing Sword started to tremble slightly with excitement.

Because of how powerful the Heart-killing Sword was, he was incapable of displaying it’s full power before he broke through to the Nine-cloud Realm, but now things were different. Now, he could finally use the full power of the sword.

While holding the Sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and began to exude an aura of slaughter.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, you are one of three emperors from the monster population.”

“I will use you to test my own strength.”

Jian Wushuang muttered before slowly waving his longsword.

At this point, a 110-meter-tall Golden Sword Soul Phantom suddenly appeared behind him.

The Golden Sword Soul Phantom radiated a Supreme Sword Essence as it imitated Jian Wushuang and waved its golden longsword as well.

At this point, the Sword thrust forward.

It was a casual attack that didn’t even seem to possess any sword skill.

But, afterwards, swoosh! The space between them was split and a huge sword shadow appeared.

The huge sword shadow seemed as if it had the power to destroy anything and It drew the attention of everyone in the area as soon as it appeared.

Most of the surrounding human experts and the countless Demonic Beast all cast their eyes towards this move.

They could feel an incredible power from this move. The warriors in the Cloud Realm were unable to display this level of strength, and even ordinary Temple Masters wouldn’t possess this much power.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, who was standing in front of Jian Wushuang, had thought poorly of him in the beginning, but he knitted his eyebrows when he felt the power that was being released from this humongous sword shadow.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor quickly thrust his right palm out like a shot before the sword shadow managed to strike him.

Bang!

In that instant, the whole area trembled.

The two terrifying powers slammed into each other.

“What?” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was completely surprised because he was forced to retreat in a disorderly manner.

He retreated backwards for over 300 meters, almost falling into the horde of Demonic Beasts, while being chased by the huge sword shadow that Jian Wushuang released.

An instant later, the power that still remained exploded.

A torrent of sword shadows filled the sky and swept out in all directions, forming many dazzling sword lights. Those sword lights carried such a terrifying amount of power, that the surrounding Demonic Beasts couldn’t help being overwhelmed and stricken with a sense of fear.

Swoosh!

The terrifying sword lights skimmed through the Demonic Beasts, cutting off their heads and other parts of their bodies as easily as cutting wheat.

Even the Rank Seven or Rank Eight Monsters were easily killed by the sword lights without any sign of a struggle. Some of the Rank Nine Monsters withstood the explosion of sword lights, but most of them had been heavily mauled.

After a short period of time had passed, the power emitted by the sword lights finally vanished, but the result had been catastrophic for the Demonic Beasts.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor still had a magnificent aura. Even though he had been forced backwards by Jian Wushuang, he was still uninjured. However, At this moment, he glanced around him with a gloomy look on his face.

The field was littered with corpses. There had to be hundreds of Demonic Beasts lying there.

Among them were Rank Seven and Rank Eight Monsters who had died in the aftermath of the ruthless sword shadows explosion.

It happened in an instant, but the aftermath killed hundreds of Demonic Beasts who were at least Rank Four and had reached the Cloud Realm.

What a terrifying attack!

This move had come from Jian Wushuang, who Crystal-armored Monster Emperor had been looking down on. However, it had only been a casual and random attack, without using any sword skill. It was obvious that he had not used his full strength.

Silence!

The whole area had become silent at this moment.

Even most of the human experts who had witnessed what happened just now were completely stupefied.

“This...”

“Jian Wushuang did this?”

“It was only a casual wave of his sword, yet the aftermath swept out and directly extinguished hundreds of Demonic Beasts. What is his true level of strength?”

“Did you see? Even Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was forced to step back hundreds of meters when he confronted this move.”

“What a terrible move! Just by looking at the level of power, that move has surpassed most of the Temple Masters in our Monster-exterminating League, let alone the fact that it was only a casual attack by Jian Wushuang.”

Everyone was filled with shock and bewilderment!

Everyone was frightened by the strength he had just displayed.

In the beginning, they thought Jian Wushuang was crazy when he said he would fight with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, but now...

Just a random move from Jian Wushuang had almost caused them to surrender.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor! You just said you would give me three moves?”

“Are you sure you want to do that?”
