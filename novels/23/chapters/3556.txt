Chapter 3558: Target: Red Eye!

“So powerful!”

“Shi Yan Master is definitely an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm. Even if I try my best to use the heaven-cleaving skill, I might not be his match. Besides, he has the help of Red Eye Master. Her illusion is also very difficult to deal with.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

It was normal for him to be no match for Shi Yan Master.

As for the Red Eye Master...if she was only good at soul attacks, Jian Wushuang would not take her seriously no matter how powerful her soul attacks were, however, the key was that the Red Eye Master was not only good at soul attacks, but also at all kinds of illusions.

The illusions were so real that they allowed him to enter them silently. It would take him some time to crack them. During this time, Shi Yan Master could attack him at will.

With the two of them together, Jian Wushuang had no intention of fighting them at all.

“Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate at all. After rising up from the pit, he immediately burst out of the void to the side.

“Do you think you can escape?” Shi Yan Master smiled coldly. In an instant, a wave of space-time power swept out. At the same time, the raging flames on his body turned into a sea of fire and spread to the surroundings.

“This is...” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He had already felt the space-time power binding him and the crazy suppression of the sea of fire.

“As expected of an expert from the North Sea Palace. His family background is really extravagant. Not only does he have a space-time type universe supreme treasure, but he also has a domain type universe supreme treasure. When the two are combined, the suppression and restriction on me are too great.” Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked, he immediately took out the golden sky-painting flag and used his time-space domain.

Although his time-space domain had instantly canceled out the restriction of the time-space type true treasure, he could not affect the suppression of the domain type true treasure. He was still greatly suppressed by the domain, his speed was still greatly restricted.

However, the speed of the two masters was not affected at all. They had already caught up with him, especially the Shi Yan Master. As an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm, his speed was already faster than Jian Wushuang’s. Now that he had caught up…it would not take long for him to catch up with Jian Wushuang.

“Shi Yan Master, I don’t have any enmity with you two. Why do you need to keep chasing me?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, I’ve already said that as long as you hand over the space-time treasure, I’ll let you go. But if you don’t want to, then it’s not my fault.” Shi Yan Master sneered.

“It seems that there’s no point in talking about it. In that case...let’s fight.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a sharp light. He had been frantically running forward, but at this moment, he suddenly turned around, he was charging straight at Shi Yan Master.

“Haha, how dare you!”

Shi Yan Master laughed loudly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were as cold as ice. He did not appear directly in front of Shi Yan Master. Instead, he appeared at the side of Shi Yan Master. At the same time, he slashed out with his ultimate shadow sword.

He still had not used his heaven-cleaving skill. He had only activated his life divine power, which was comparable to that of an elementary Principles Master of the sixth realm.

“You overestimate yourself.”

Shi Yan Master looked down on him. His body was covered in flames, and the axe in his hand was like a shooting star as it smashed directly onto the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword.

Clang!

With a loud sound, the strength of the axe exploded, and Jian Wushuang was immediately sent flying into the void to the side.

Unfortunately, he was sent flying in the direction where the Red Eye Master was coming from.

In other words, Jian Wushuang was able to close the distance between him and the Red Eye Master.

As a result, the moment he regained his balance, he went straight for the Red Eye Master, his eyes suddenly burst with killing intent.

“Eh?” The Red Eye Master frowned, and a look of surprise flashed through her eyes. However, she was not afraid at all. Although she was not good at fighting head-on, she had to deal with an elementary level six realm Principles Master head-on, it’s pretty easy.

Moreover, although Jian Wushuang closed the distance between them and attacked her in an instant, she still had time to react. The moment Jian Wushuang attacked her, her soul power burst out.

“Soul, blast!”

The Red Eye Master growled, showing no mercy.

The majestic soul power formed an invisible awl in an instant and crashed directly into Jian Wushuang. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang could not dodge this silent soul attack, but he had never thought of dodging it. He just let the terrifying soul attack hit him directly.

It was known that the Red Eye Master was famous for her soul skills. Even experts at the pinnacle of the six realm would not dare to underestimate her soul attack. The soul attack was also one of her trump cards, under normal circumstances, she could kill an expert of the sixth realm directly.

However, when the soul blast hit Jian Wushuang, he only shook his body, but he did not stop at all. He continued to attack her.

“What?”

Red Eye Master was shocked.

She never expected that Blood Sword Master would be able to withstand her soul blast with all her strength without even stopping.

“I will not rest until I die!”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent soared. The heaven-cleaving skill, which he had not used until now, completely exploded at this moment.

An overwhelming destructive will rose up, carrying a sense of hatred that would not rest until death. In an instant, it turned into a brilliant purple sword light and slashed toward Red Eye Master.

“Oh no!”

The Red Eye Master’s expression changed. A cyan long spear immediately appeared in her hand and she faced the sword light.

She had thought that although she was not good at fighting head-on, it would be relatively easy for her to deal with an ordinary Principles Master of the initial stage of the sixth realm. However, at the moment when his long spear collided with the sword light, she was completely stunned.

“How, how can it be so powerful?”

Red Eye Master was shocked. The sword light that Jian Wushuang displayed brought her a terrifying pressure that suffocated her.

The power of the sword light was too strong.

Almost in an instant, it shook away her long spear. Then, the sword light continued to slash at her divine body.

Bang!

Red Eye Master had the armor of an advanced universe true treasure, so the surface of her divine body was not damaged. However, a lot of the power still passed into her body and severely injured her, more than 30 percent of her godly power was annihilated at once.

However, this was not the end.
