Chapter 3612: Netherfire Blood Crystal

“There was no later.” Axe One Master shook her head. “The female Ruler and her disciple only appeared once and did not attack. After that, no one has seen them or anyone has seen them, but our Star Palace did not find them.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

In his opinion, the female Ruler and her disciple who appeared in the depths of Crimson Rock Mountain were likely to be Star Luo Master and Leng Ruxue, but unfortunately, Star Palace’s intelligence could only find them this time, and it was more than 80,000 years ago.

“Axe One Master, please continue to investigate this matter,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Axe One Master nodded.

“There’s nothing else. Everyone, go on with your work.”

After saying this, Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

After that, Jian Wushuang made a trip to the supreme treasure house and left a moment later.

Before leaving, he took the Supreme Universe Supreme Treasure Divine Sword mentioned by Daoist Xuan God, as well as many treasures that were helpful in integrating the destruction principles, the space-time principles, and the reincarnation principles. In addition…Jian Wushuang also took a flying and domain supreme treasure.

As the Young Palace Master of Star Palace, he could freely use the many resources of Star Palace, including the many supreme treasures and treasures in the Supreme Treasure Vault. As long as he felt that they were useful, he could take them without paying any price.

However, although Jian Wushuang took these things, he still left some of the treasures that he had collected over the years in the Supreme Treasure Vault.

For example, the top-tier universe supreme treasure divine weapon left by the Star Thunder Ruler, the Shadow Devil Thunder Stick!

There was also the axe, which was a top-tier universe supreme treasure, and the spear, which was a top-tier universe supreme treasure, which he had obtained when he first entered the special space-time.

These treasures were all extremely valuable.

After leaving the Supreme Treasure Vault, Jian Wushuang returned to his residence and began to cultivate in seclusion.

He had met with three master-level experts, namely Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, and Heaven Ancestor. After knowing the reason, he felt even more stressed and could not afford to slack off, after all, he did not know when Devil Cloud Star Master would personally come. Once he arrived, the final battle would begin immediately.

Before that, all he had to do was try his best to increase his strength.

Right now, the fastest way to increase his strength was to fuse the three principles and break through to become a Principles Master!

Once he broke through, his strength would definitely reach a whole new level, and he could even completely rival a Ruler!

Nine years passed in the blink of an eye.

In this territory, on an Earth Star that was quite far away from the Star Palace.

Rumble...

Three terrifying auras descended at the same time, pressing down on this Earth Star. There were quite a few Principles Masters on this Earth Star, and when they felt these three auras, they instantly began to tremble, and their hearts trembled.

In the void at the center of this Earth Star, a cold middle-aged man who was over three meters tall stood there, looking around at the source of the three auras. He frowned deeply. He was the master of this planet. He was also the most famous person in this territory, Ruler Guyou.

“Star Palace Master, Temporal Temple Master, and the Empyrean Patriarch, the three of you came from the incomparably distant primordial starworld. If you were to travel here by foot, it would probably take thousands of years. Even if you were able to rely on a cosmic tunnel, the price you would have to pay for such a long-distance teleportation is incredibly high. Even though you know this, the three of you still came,” Ruler Guyou said in a low voice.

“Guyou, let’s cut to the chase. You should know why the three of us are here. Hand over the Netherfire Blood Crystal, and the three of us will leave immediately. Otherwise...” Daoist Xuan God’s eyes turned cold.

In another void, the Temporal Temple Master’s face flickered. Instantly, boundless spacetime energy swept out, completely sealing off the surrounding spacetime.

Ruler Guyou’s face sank as he glanced at the Temporal Temple Master. “It’s rumored that this Temporal Temple Master’s understanding and usage of the spacetime laws have already reached the peak. Now that I look at it, it seems that this is indeed the case. With him around, I don’t even have the chance to escape. If these three Rulers join forces and attack me at the same time, I’m definitely no match for them.”

Taking a deep breath, Ruler Guyou raised his head again. “Is it worth the trouble of the three of you for a Netherfire Blood Crystal?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Of course it is,” Heaven Ancestor growled. “Guyou, hand over the Netherfire Blood Crystal honestly. The conditions I promised you will not change. However, if you continue to be stubborn, be careful that this Ruler of yours will really die here.”

“It’s just a single Netherfire Blood Crystal. Although it is of some use to me, it isn’t enough for me to risk my life for it. The reason I rejected you earlier was because I wanted you to pay an even greater price. Now that you have gone through so much trouble, you can just take the Netherfire Blood Crystal.” Ruler Guyou waved his hand, instantly, a streak of blood-colored light shot toward the Empyrean Lord.

The Heaven Ancestor stretched out his hand to receive it. After giving it a sweeping glance, he nodded toward Daoist Xuan God and the Temporal Temple Master.

Now that they had acquired the Netherfire Blood Crystal, the three of them naturally had no plans to attack.

“Ruler Guyou, we’ve offended you in many ways today, but the Netherfire Blood Crystal is of great importance to us. We can only come up with this plan. I’m sorry. This is what I promised you previously.” The Heaven Ancestor waved his hand, tossing an interspatial ring to Ruler Guyou, then, the three of them left.

Seeing the three of them leave, the cultivators on this Earth Star let out a heavy sigh.

As for Guyou Ruler, after he received the Heaven Ancestor’s interspatial ring, he glanced at it and his expression became strange.

“Although the Netherfire Blood Crystal is rare, it shouldn’t be too important to a Ruler. However, these three people actually paid such a high price to rush here from the Divine Beginning Realm just for a Netherfire Blood Crystal. They actually came to kill me?

“What is the use of the Netherfire Blood Crystal to them?” The Guyou Ruler frowned, but he did not think too much about it.

As for what happened today, it was a bit aggrieved for him. However, facing three Rulers at the same time, and one of them was a Ruler who had reached the peak of space-time, he had no choice but to bow his head, after that, the other party had apologized to him personally and left him some face. Therefore, he did not hold a grudge. At most, he felt a little unhappy.

After the Daoist Xuan God trio obtained the Netherfire Blood Crystal from the Guyou Ruler, they immediately returned to Star Palace as fast as they could. They handed over the Netherfire Blood Crystal and the other treasures on the list that Jian Wushuang had given them, all of them were given to Jian Wushuang.
