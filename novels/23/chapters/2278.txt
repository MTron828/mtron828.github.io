2279 Master of the Holy Land

Boom!

Two terrifying bolts of lightning turned the spacetime into dust with a loud bang. The incredible sword light was also reduced to nothing.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body swayed before he dashed backwards.

The tall, beautiful lady remained there.

“Even I am affected this much by the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth?” the beautiful lady muttered. A wave of destructive aura erupted from her and swept out in all directions. Instantly, it travelled trillions of feet. Within this area, Heaven and Earth trembled as the formation that covered the entire Eternal Chaotic World was also affected by this wave of aura.

“The Master of the Holy Land is really powerful. She can affect Restrictions of Heaven and Earth with her own power.” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

Even though the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth were very powerful in this world, it was not invincible.

For example, the Blood Emperor had managed to affect the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth with the formation he had come up with over the long time he was here. Then, he had sacrificed the lives of all the experts in the Three Emperors World to cast the formation which affected the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth and enabled him to use the power of a Divine Demon.

Blood Emperor required the help of the formation and the blood essence of countless experts to affect the restrictions.

However, experts at the level of Emperor Thirteen did not need to pay any price or help. They could affect the formation with their own power to enable them to use the power of a Half Step Divine Demon.

Even though a beautiful lady was only a consciousness embodiment, she could do the same.

Furthermore, the fighting power this beautiful lady was displaying was incredible.

“Even though she is weaker than me in power level, she can suppress me with a casual strike. This is a Master of the Holy Land!” Jian Wushuang looked dark.

“Under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, I need to put in more effort to kill you. However, I can still do it,” the beautiful lady said as she raised her fingers once again and pointed at Jian Wushuang.

A wave of destructive power that made Jian Wushuang breathless erupted from her fingers.

A humongous finger made up of entirely grey divine power was formed in the air. The grey divine power gave Jian Wushuang goosebumps.

“Poison. That is deadly poison. It is the same type of poison that Leng Ruxue has, but it’s much more lethal!” Jian Wushuang turned pale.

He finally understood why this Master of the Holy Land would take Leng Ruxue as a lineal disciple and pay so much attention to her.

It was because this Master of the Holy Land had the same unique constitution as Leng Ruxue!

Both of them had Heaven’s Mandate Unique Constitution and could control Heaven’s Mandate Poison!

“The poison Leng Ruxue can control can kill any ordinary Divine Demon. I can use my Perfect Chaotic Holy Body to counter it. However, the poison that the Master of the Holy Land controls...” The poison that the Master of the Holy Land controlled was ten times, or even a hundred times more lethal, even though she was under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

Jian Wushuang was sure that his Perfect Chaotic Holy Body could not take this poison as it was too lethal.

When this finger made up of grey poison appeared in front of Jian Wushuang...

Slash!

A sword light appeared out of nowhere.

This sword light had appeared far too suddenly. It sliced the humongous finger into two and the grey divine power started to seep out in all directions. It too was met with sword lights as they were extinguished instantly.

“Huh?”

The beautiful lady was caught off guard. She immediately looked towards a space to one side.

A figure stood there silently.

“It is you!” The beautiful lady’s eyes turned extremely cold.

“Lord Emperor Thirteen.” Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

That is right, the man who had sliced the poisonous finger into two was Emperor Thirteen!!!

The leader of Seven Stars, the man who could go even against Masters of the Holy Land.

“Emperor Thirteen, you dare to show up in front of me!?” The beautiful lady roared in anger.

When she saw Emperor Thirteen, the beautiful lady erupted in anger as killing intent saturated her eyes.

“Why wouldn’t I? Looks like your injuries have completely recovered, Seria.”

Hearing this, the beautiful lady became even angrier.

Her name was Seria. However, not many people knew what she was really called due to her status as a Master of the Holy Land. Even if there were people who knew, no one dared to call her by her name.

However, Emperor Thirteen did not care at all. He called her by her name in front of everyone.

As for the injury Emperor Thirteen was talking about... It was the greatest disgrace she had ever experienced since becoming a Master of the Holy Land.

Many years ago, she had fought Emperor Thirteen. Even though she had had the absolute advantage in that battle, Emperor Thirteen had still managed to injure her with his crazy sword skills and leave a deep scar on her arm.

She felt embarrassed as she had been injured by someone who was not at the level of the Master of the Holy Land yet.

This was why she had always wanted to kill Emperor Thirteen badly.

The main reason why she had helped out back in the Great Battle of the Ancient Past was because she had wanted to kill Emperor Thirteen. However, it was almost impossible to kill someone at the power level of Emperor Thirteen.

“Emperor Thirteen. Thank you for appearing. I can finally wash away the shame from that sword wound,” the beautiful woman said coldly.

“You also said that back in the great battle. What happened in the end?” Emperor Thirteen replied in disdain. He then looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “I will help you handle this woman right here. The rest is up to you.”

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

Immediately after, Emperor Thirteen and the beautiful lady started their battle.

The two most powerful people back in the Absolute Beginner Divine World, one who was in the realm of Master of the Holy Land, and the other who had the fighting power at the level of the Master Of the Holy Land even though his realm was lower.

These two experts fought head-on under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, at the power level of Half-Step Divine Demon Realm.

Even though both were under very powerful restrictions, their battle was still extremely destructive.

Feeling the destructive power coming from these two experts, Jian Wushuang was shocked. However, he gaze became sharper than ever.

He fixed his sharp gaze on Leng Ruxue.

Jian Wushuang whipped out a scroll out of thin air. The scroll fused into the space around him and disappeared with a wave.
