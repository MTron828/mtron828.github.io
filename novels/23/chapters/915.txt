Dressed in white and surrounded by the others, she walked forward slowly.

Abruptly, silence descended as everyone looked at her in captivation.

Her skin was lighter than snow and her eyes were like a clear spring. She stunned everyone present with her elegance and grace.

Her beauty and breath-taking elegance were evident.

No words could adequately describe her beauty.

Above all, her aloofness was her most attractive trait.

It was something that no one else in the entire world could come close to matching.

This was Leng Rushuang, the widely-acknowledaged No. 1 beauty in the Eternal World, the princess of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, and the heroine of this Selection Ceremony.

All the male cultivators were enchanted when they laid eyes on her.

Apart from Jian Wushuang, all the other geniuses cast her appreciative looks from their location in the center of the Drill Ground.

Even Xia Mang’s eyes were eager and his hands were clenched. “Only a lady of such attributes would deserve to be my wife,” he thought.

As Leng Rushuang sat down at the Void’s viewing point, everyone relaxed visibly.

Soon, Emperor Leng arrived.

He sat on the towering throne in the middle of the viewing point and waved his hand.

“Let’s get started.”

.

Following his announcement, the sound of an ancient bell reverberated through the Drill Ground. It seemed to convey a special authority. Everyone became serious and respectful.

Emperor Leng looked down with a cold expression on his face. His grave voice echoed through the Drill Ground. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I hold the Selection Ceremony today to find a suitable husband for Shuang’er. I won’t marry her to a nobody. In order to marry her, show your sincerity and good faith; secondly, show your talent and capability.”

“The outcome of this ceremony depends on two criteria. First, the wedding gifts you have brought. Second, your strength.”

“I will select the most outstanding man to be Shuang’er’s husband based on these two criteria.”

His announcement was met with equanimity.

Everyone present was aware of the two criteria.

“There are 17 participants for the Selection Ceremony. Now please come up one at a time to show me your wedding gifts,” Emperor Leng was blunt.

The 17 geniuses in the Drill Ground, including Jian Wushuang, were visibly excited.

All of them were well-prepared for the Selection Ceremony. They had chosen their wedding gifts very carefully too.

Dongyan Chong from the Dongyan Clan went up first. He bowed to Emperor Leng and other experts on the stand.

“Emperor Leng, I am Dongyan Chong from the Dongyan Clan. I’ve brought 5 wedding gifts. I would like to marry the princess.” Dongyan Chong wore a humble expression on his face as he produced an Interspatial Ring.

The Interspatial Ring did not belong to anyone, so everyone could clearly see what was inside with their consciousness.

Dongyan Chong continued, “The five wedding gifts I have prepared are Ancient Heart Elixir, Jiuqu Formation, part of the Xue Luo Realm map, a Treasure Mountain refined by various priceless treasures and ten advanced-level Emperor Weapons.”

Without his explanation, the experts on the stand had already recognized these treasures when he produced the Interspatial Ring.

“Haha, so generous.”

“Although the Ancient Heart Elixir, Jiuqu Formation and the Xue Luo Realm map piece are not that precious, they are rare and have special effects. Did Dongyan Clan collect these three treasures at the same time?”

“I’ve look closely at the Treasure Mountain. The treasures it refined were priceless. Its worth can be compared to billions of Divine Gems. In addition, look at the ten advanced-level Emperor Weapons. Such valuable wedding gifts!”

Many experts on the stand looked amazed.

The Master of Dongyan Clan looked proud.

Nobody knew how much the Dongyan Clan had paid to obtain such treasures.

While the gifts were valuable, it was clear that Emperor Leng remained unmoved.

It was obvious that Emperor Leng did not appreciate the five wedding gifts.

“Next.”

His voice held no emotion. Emperor Leng did not comment on Dongyan Chong’s gifts.

Dongyan Chong frowned but could do nothing except stand back.

Thereafter, the other geniuses approached the stand to show their wedding gifts.

All the geniuses had outstanding backgrounds so their wedding gifts were impressive too. Some of them had amazed the people in the Drill Ground, and even the top experts on the stand. However, Emperor Leng showed little interest in them.

After 15 minutes, 15 of the 17 geniuses had presented their wedding gifts.

Among the 15 geniuses, Ku Yi, the personal disciple of Elder Deadwood, had presented a very rare Nine-colored Cloud Fruit. Many experts on the stand had been surprised by the gift and some were even envious.

Even Emperor Leng had been surprised. That had been the only gift which had evoked a response from him.

The 15 geniuses had stepped back, leaving two who stood at the stand quietly.

The two geniues left were Xia Mang from the Xia Clan, and… Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s just you and me now.” Xia Mang looked at Jian Wushuang. “With your background, I’m curious what wedding gifts you will present.”

Xia Mang was well aware that Ancient Sect, to which Jian Wushuang belonged,?was just a sect of a normal realm. It was considered a powerful sect of that realm but was insignificant in the context of the Eternal World.

In addition, as far as he knew, Jian Wushuang’s Master was just in Eternal Realm. The only thing he could show off was his Senior Brother, Master Blood Saber.

Among the 17 geniuses, Jian Wushuang’s background wasn’t the least impressive, but it was far from outstanding.
