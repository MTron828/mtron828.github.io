Chapter 2512: Xiao Tiexin

The Eighteen Prefectures were definitely the overlords of Dark Thunder Territory. They were deeply rooted in the territory, very powerful, and way above any of the other criminal enterprises.

The Celestial Beast Alliance for example were definitely not weak in terms of their strength with four Ultimate God experts. However, they had never dreamed of comparing themselves with the Eighteen Prefectures.

The reason did not purely lie in strength as it also had to do with the methods they had taken and the nature of their businesses.

However strong the Celestial Beast Alliance was, they were just thieves after all.

Although the Eighteen Prefectures were also thieves, they could be equated to 18 powerful regional political powers to the others.

Anyone of the Eighteen Prefectures was equipped with the means to control a region.

Each of the Eighteen Prefectures had its own very well-organized intelligence department.

One of the Eighteen Prefectures, Demonic Moon Prefecture.

Inside a black garret.

“Third Leader, we just received news of the Celestial Beast Alliance pouring all their manpower to rob an escort team but lost big time.” A black-robed man knelt down.

“Celestial Beast Alliance?”

At the foremost part of the garret, a slim old man in grey stood up with his face full of surprise. “Celestial Beast Alliance is not weak. They have four Ultimate Gods among them. Even if they were robbing a crimson-class escort team, they should be returning victoriously. How come they lost?”

“According to our informants in Celestial Beast Alliance, they were really robbing a regular crimson-class escort team which only has three Ultimate Gods and around twenty Peak Divine Demons. However, their captain—Xiao Tiexin is very skillful. She’s an Ultimate God, but so are the two Celestial Beast Alliance leaders which she crushed by herself. The Celestial Beast Alliance had to retreat from desperation,” said the black-robed man.

The grey-robed old man was shocked. “She fought against two Ultimate Gods at the same time and was still able to defeat them. Doesn’t that mean she’s very close to possessing the battle prowess of a High-Level Ultimate God? Perhaps, she’s even one? Xiao Tiexin? I feel like I’ve heard of her name.”

While he spoke, the grey-robed old man began to shuffle through jade slips on the table before him.

After a while...

“Here it is!”

The grey-robed old man held up a jade slip with his eyes flickering with excitement. “Xiao Tiexin, the eldest daughter of the Xiao clan and its last survivor. Haha, so it’s her!”

“Xiao clan?” The black-robed man also immediately recalled an ancient clan that used to exist.

“Hmph, this Xiao Tiexin has the guts to appear in Dark Thunder Territory and even became captain of a crimson-class escort team. She is also very skillful. Looks like she’s in the midst of training and gaining experiences to improve her abilities. Once ready she’ll return and seek vengeance from that person!” The grey-robed old man exclaimed.

“That person?” The black-robed man shuddered and immediately recalled a person.

That man was someone who the Eighteen Prefectures would not even dare cross even if they joined forces.

That man was basically a God in the Northern Darkstar Territory!

“Third Leader, Xiao Tiexin wants to seek revenge from that person, why don’t we catch her and send it to the Lord? Would that make him happy?” suggested the black-robed man.

The grey-robed old man waved his hand. “No. Xiao Tiexin is nothing to the Lord. Otherwise, she would have been dead for a long time. How did you think she survived till now? Even if we presented her to the Lord, the Lord may not even care and perhaps wouldn’t even care to see us. However, Xiao Tiexin is the eldest daughter of the Xiao clan and their last survivor after all. She probably possesses some of Xiao clan’s wealth.”

“Xiao clan’s wealth? Didn’t all of it gets taken by the Lord?” said the black-robed man in surprise.

“That’s true, but Xiao clan is such a large ancient clan and Xiao Tiexin is their eldest daughter after all. We won’t know if she had taken some of it when she escaped.” The grey-robed old man squinted and soon decided. “You wait here, let me find Elder Brother.”

...

Dark Thunder Territory was shrouded in freezing darkness during the night.

In the forest, Xueya Escort Team and their clients were resting and regrouping.

Jian Wushuang remained seated cross-legged on the back of the double-horned Thunderous Star Beast while silently studying and cultivating by himself.

The others were also sitting down and going about their own businesses. Some were recuperating their abilities, some were cultivating, and some were discussing the battle with the Celestial Beast Alliance that occurred earlier.

In one corner, two Peak Divine Demons of the Xueya Escort Team were sitting together and chatting casually.

“Our captain is really something. She could oppress two Ultimate Gods all by herself!” One of them, a young man in a white robe exclaimed.

“That’s true. Otherwise, how can she become our captain? You’re a newbie on the team. Naturally, you haven’t seen many such occurrences yet. When you’ve seen more, you’ll know how powerful she truly is,” said the other bald man proudly.

“Are you saying she hasn’t unleashed her full strength in today’s battle yet?” The white-robed youngster was shocked.

The bald man smiled awkwardly and said, “Well, I won’t know. Our captain is not only skillful. Her background is also pretty incredible.”

“Background?” The white-robed youngster was intrigued.

The bald man looked around and quietly said after realizing nobody was paying attention to him, “Ever heard of the Xiao clan?”

“Xiao clan? Are you talking about one of the top clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent? The captain is one of them?” The white-robed youngster exclaimed.

“Hehe, now you know.” The bald man smiled mysteriously before sighing a little and said, “The captain is the Xiao clan’s eldest daughter and has lived in a very sophisticated environment since young. It’s a shame the Xiao clan fell into turmoil not long ago with their whole clan being annihilated. She’s the only one from the Xiao clan who escaped.”

“The Xiao clan is such a powerful family and yet they had been destroyed. Who in the Northern Darkstar Territory would have such capabilities to annihilate them? Don’t tell me it’s...” The white-robed youngster thought of someone.

“Yes, that’s the one. The most superior one in the Northern Darkstar Territory, the Territorial Lord!” said the bald man.

“Why did he destroy the Xiao clan though?” asked the white-robed youngster.

“Well, I did hear our two deputy captains mention it before that the Xiao clan had obtained an extremely rare treasure by chance not long ago. Word got out by accident and the Territorial Lord caught wind about it. After that, destruction befalls the Xiao clan,” said the bald man.

“Treasure? It’s just one treasure. Why would it garner the Territorial Lord’s personal efforts in destroying such a large ancient clan? What’s that treasure?” The white-robed youngster only got more curious.

“I hear it’s a painted scroll, I think its name is ‘The Stately Painting’!” answered the bald man.

“The Stately Painting?” The white-robed youngster had a blanket look on his face as he had obviously never heard of it.

“What are you two chatting about?!” someone suddenly scolded. It was one of the Ultimate Gods deputy captains who walked toward them.

The two were startled and immediately shut their mouths without speaking another word.

The deputy captain harrumphed coldly and left.

However, nobody noticed over the course of discussion between the bald man and white-robed youngster, Jian Wushuang had already opened his eyes while sitting on top of his double-horned Thunderous Star Beast.

Furthermore, an unprecedented sharp glint was shining through his eyes!

His body slightly trembled with excitement.

“The Stately Painting!!!”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
