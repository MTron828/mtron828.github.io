Chapter 1094: I’ll Take Full Responsibility!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang? I’ve heard of the name somewhere… Oh, are you Nan’s son?” Celestial Master Chen asked solemnly.

“Nan’s son?”

The Celestial Masters began to look at Jian Wushuang differently.

They lived in the Green Fire Palace all year round. They rarely visited the Green Fire World and thus, most of them did not know Jian Wushuang despite his fame. However, they knew him as Nan’s son.

“Are you Nan’s son?”

“Nan? That bastard!”

“It’s said that he took Ji Wumeng away from the Ancient Monster Clan! That bastard…”

They began cursing up a storm.

Jian Wushuang frowned and clenched his hands but restrained his rage.

He could understand why they would have such an attitude and why they would curse his father like this.

“Kid, I heard you and your father were the ones who attacked the Ancient Monster Clan and went up the Heaven Ceasing Peak to take Ji Wumeng away.” Chen glared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly before adding in a low voice, “Ji Wumeng is my mother!”

“Yes, she’s your mother. But she’s also the glimmer of hope in which Green Fire Palace earned after sparing no effort. She’s supposed to shoulder the responsibility of the entire Green Fire Palace and Green Fire World. Now that your father has taken her away, that means all the efforts of Green Fire Palace are in vain. One of my sworn brothers, Celestial Master Peng, died because of your mother!”

“If your mother could fulfill her duties, it would’ve made all our efforts and my sworn brother’s death worthwhile. But now…”

“He won’t be able to rest in peace!”

Chen snarled when he said the last sentence.

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands even tighter, so much so that he was stabbing his flesh with his nails.

Taking a deep breath, he replied solemnly, “I’ll complete the tasks that my mother didn’t fulfill. I’ll take over the duties that she shouldered all by myself!”

“You? Are you capable of that?” Chen scolded.

“That’s enough,” Celestial Master Yu Ding said with a frown, finally intercepting their conversation. “Celestial Master Chen, all of you, I understand your frustrations. But the Five Palace Masters have made their decision on this matter. If you’re unhappy with the decision, you can take it up with them!”

“Besides, Ji Wumeng is Jian Wushuang’s mother and Celestial Master Nan’s wife. Humans are selfish. If you stand in their shoes, you’ll find that they haven’t done anything wrong.”

Chen’s expression changed. He stared at Jian Wushuang for a long time before finally flicking his sleeve. “Since the Five Palace Masters have made their decision, what else can I say? I hope the kid will be able to do something for Green Fire Palace. I don’t expect him to be as competent as his mother. It’d begood enough if he even fulfills half of his mother’s duties.”

He then turned around and left.

Other Celestial Masters looked at Jian Wushuang with complex expressions but nevertheless, also took their leave.

Soon, Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding were left alone in Tai Qing Palace.

Jian Wushuang was still clenching his hands. There was a tint of fortitude in his eyes that had never appeared before.

“Jian Wushuang.” Yu Ding looked at him. “Their attitude is extreme but they have their reasons. Please understand them.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He did not actually blame Celestial Master Chen and the others.

“Mother…”

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth. He had learned about her mother from Jian Nantian. The day Yu Ding brought him to Green Fire Palace, he also questioned him and was told the truth.

Since then, he could understand why Celestial Master Chen and the others were so furious, as well as why they blamed and cursed him and his father.

The Celestial Masters had paid too great a price for this.

His mother was a member of the Ancient Monster Clan who carried a pure Ancient Monster bloodline.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the Green Fire Palace experts found the complete corpse of a Heavenly Monster with a pure bloodline on the battlefield. There was an intact Heavenly Monster’s Inheritance in the body, which presented them with a golden opportunity.

The inheritance, containing a superb Secret Skill, was very powerful. The Green Fire Palace experts then requested the Ancient Monster Clan to send ten of their clansmen with the purest bloodline to inherit the skill.

There were tests for those who wished to get the Inheritance, of which one out of the ten clansmen passed. That was his mother, Ji Wumeng.

Ji Wumeng was instilled with enormous potential after gaining the Heavenly Monster’s Inheritance and Secret Skill. The Palace Masters who researched the Secret Skill bluntly said that she would be able to become the leader of Green Fire Palace if she makes great strides in cultivating the Secret Skill.

The leader!

She could become the leader!

The Five Palace Masters who took charge of Green Fire Palace all had enormous authority but at the end of the day, they were still not the leader.

The so-called leader was the supreme existence that would lead Green Fire Palace to destroy the Jin Kingdom.

Such a leader was supposed to be powerful enough to earn the respect of all Green Fire Palace experts.

His mother possessed such potential.

However, the Secret Skill was so unique that she had to pay a high price to achieve it. One of the principles was to be heartless!

That meant she would have to abandon all emotions, including love, kinship, and relationship. The only emotion that she could keep was nostalgia for her hometown.

In order to make her abandon all her emotions, Green Fire Palace made great efforts to make her experience nine rounds of Samsara to experience nine births and deaths under the guidance of the Secret Skill.

The Jin Kingdom somehow caught wind of this and dispatched a great number of experts to kill her. The Green Fire Palace experts had risked their lives to protect her.

It was a ferocious battle, second only to the war five million years ago.

Green Fire Palace had suffered great losses in the battle. Over 20 Celestial Masters were killed. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

They had sacrificed so much all so that Ji Wumeng could learn the Secret Skill as soon as possible and then lead the entire Green Fire Palace.

After she entered the Samsara, she practiced through her nine reincarnations under the palace’s surveillance.

The first eight reincarnations went smoothly for Ji Wumeng had successfully eliminated her emotions during this time.

However, unexpected events occurred during her ninth reincarnation in the Nanyang Continent of the Ancient World…
