Chapter 2260 Family

Jian Wushuang felt much more confident, with the help of Emperor Thirteen and One-Star Man.What he did not know was, after ending transmission with the One-Star Man, somewhere in the Eternal Chaotic World, he was giving off a devious laugh. “I was thinking about how to make him make his move at Heaven’s Horizon, but he approached me instead. Perfect.”

...

Within Wushuang City.

Jian Wushuang was prepping himself for the task two hundred years from then.

There was not much he could improve in two hundred years.

What he needed to do was straighten things out.

Heaven’s Horizon would be different two hundred years from now!

Previous experiences had shown him that experts all had their limits.

But he would face Ancient Era experts.

To them, he was no more than a Chaotic Realm rascal. It would prove difficult to block Leng Ruxue.

The dangers that lurked were far beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination.

He had a feeling that he might not make it out.

Therefore, he needed to settle and prepare everything, in case he never got a chance to after Heaven’s Horizon.

Luckily, Green Fire World and Lineage of Stars had both improved immensely and were way more powerful than before.

Especially Green Fire World, from which countless experts emerged.

Even without Jian Wushuang guarding Green Fire World and Lineage of Stars, no one would dare mess with them.

Jian Wushuang simply needed to give the command.

Wushuang City, still within the big manor.

Three figures sat around the stone table.

They were Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, and Su Rou.

They were drinking.

“Haha, what a blast!”

“Old Three, it’s been some time since we had such a gathering,” Wang Yuan laughed as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“If Old Three’s not training, he’s fighting for Green Fire World and Eternal Chaotic World, unlike you,” Su Rou glanced Wang Yuan.

“Haha, true, true,” Wang Yuan nodded.

Jian Wushuang joined them and drank with the two brothers he had met in the Ancient Worlds.

They were all elated.

“It’s a pity that Old Two’s not here...” Wang Yuan sighed.

Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

Old Two Yang Zaixuan had died at the hands of the Devil Church along with Tang Emperor and Emperor Xiao.

It was like a thorn in their hearts.

“I heard that at the Ancient Era experts hometown Absolute Beginning Divine World, there are super beings that could reverse time, and revive the dead. Maybe they could bring back Old Two,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Easily said, but where do we find them?” Wang Yuan shrugged his shoulders.

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded too.

Indeed, he had inquired after Jian Er if there indeed existed someone that could reverse time and bring back the dead.

Jian Er said he had heard legends about it, but he did not know who had done it or how he had obtained those powers.

But to Jian Er, it had to be at least a Master of Holy Land.

Even those are few and far between at the Absolute Beginning Divine World, much less the Eternal Chaotic World.

The strongest person he knew was Emperor Thirteen.

But at Emperor Thirteen’s pinnacle, he could only wrestle Master of Holy Land-experts.

“It’s impossible for now. Maybe when the chance comes,” Jian Wushuang said.

Wang Yuan and Su Rou nodded. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Like that, they drank for three days and three nights before leaving.

After they had left, a man and a woman appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Father, mother,” Jian Wushuang stood up and smiled.

They were his parents, Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng.

“Shuanger, I heard you’re making preparations for Heaven’s Horizon?” Jian Nantian glanced at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Nantian, as an Emperor God and the leader of the Green Fire World, naturally knew about the secrets of the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Indeed,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“For Leng Rushuang?” Jian Nantian.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Father, you should understand.”

“I do,” Jian Nantian looked at him solemnly.

Of course, he knew Jian Wushuang’s objective and his determination.

He knew him.

Some time ago, for Ji Wumeng, he had given up too much.

Through luck, he had been reunited with Ji Wumeng.

Now, it was his son’s turn.

“I do not know much about the Ancient Era experts, but I trust you,” Jian Nantian said. “Do it, remember, you are a man.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded and looked at Ji Wumeng.

The latter looked at him with concern and without saying much, but that look alone was enough to warm Jian Wushuang up.

“Father, Mother, there is still some time between now and the opening of the link passage. Let’s spend some family time together,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Sure,” Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng did not refuse.

The three of them made their way around Green Fire World.

Green Fire World was huge and impossible to fully cover in two hundred years, even with their skills.

Jian Wushuang could only head to familiar places.

Like Tang of the East!

Jian Wushuang had fought against Leng Di, Dao Yuanzi’s Crimson God Clone and Xia Clan.

He had wed Leng Rushuang there as well.

The place contained many memories, but since Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao and Yang Zaixuan had died, and Tang of the East had been eradicated, there was nothing left.
