Chapter 68: Battle for Points

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The second way is to complete a task.

“Dragon Palace provides various tasks for experience. Some of them are difficult, some are relatively simple. You will obtain points according to the complexity of the task.

“The third way is to battle for points.”

On hearing this, both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were puzzled.

They could easily understand the first two ways, but could not figure out what the battle for points was.

“The battle for points is actually dueling.” Wang Yuan spoke with a smile. “There’re more than 200 disciples of Dragon Palace with varying strength. As exceptional geniuses, they can be somewhat arrogant. As a result, they often fight with each other in Dragon Palace. Since there are fights, there are duels and bets. As for the bets, it’s up to the two duelers.”

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan immediately understood.

“Speaking of the battles for points, Third Younger Brother, you should be careful.” Wang Yuan suddenly spoke.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang looked at him in surprise.

Wang Yuan said, “I just mentioned there are three ways to get points. First, going through the Dragon Gate. Many disciples will wait a long time to challenge, and they may not be successful. What’s more, they can only gain a few points there.

“Second, complete tasks for experience. But, only difficult tasks offer a lot of points. Disciples of Dragon Palace will face death trials while performing these tasks, so it’s very dangerous.

“Only the third way, battle for points, is simple. You only need to challenge someone weaker than you and settle the bets. Disciples who have stayed in Dragon Palace for a period of time, know the other disciples very well, so they won’t easily accept challenges. However, you and Second Younger Brother are different because you’re newcomers.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

“You mean the other disciples of Dragon Palace will want to challenge me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Right.” Wang Yuan nodded. “They are inclined to bully those weaker than them. You have just entered Dragon Palace, so they will treat you as a weakling. They will try their best to challenge you to a duel before you have time to use treasures of Dragon Palace to improve your strength.

“Of course, Second Younger Brother is also a newcomer, but he made it through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. He’s so powerful that no one will dare to challenge him.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“We’ll reach the Martial Arts Practice Field soon, where many disciples of Dragon Palace gather. Battle for points is usually held there. Third Younger Brother, you must remember my words. If someone challenges you, you can refuse directly or just ignore them. They cannot do anything to you.” Wang Yuan reminded Jian Wushuang.

“Refuse, why should I refuse?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Don’t be rash, Third Younger Brother. It is not easy for you to earn points. Do not lose them by acting on impulse.” Wang Yuan continued to persuade him.

“Don’t worry. I know what to do,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

The four of them had finally arrived at the huge Martial Arts Practice Field.

The Martial Arts Practice Field covered an extremely large area. There were quite a few disciples of Dragon Palace around the center of it. At the moment, all of them looked at the four people who just stepped inside.

“Ha, newcomers!”

“I hear there are two new disciples. Those two must be the newcomers.”

“The man with a cold expression is called Yang Zaixuan. It’s inconceivable that he has already gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. He must be a monster on the same level as Bai Cheng.”

“Yang Zaixuan, an exceptional genius. We’re not comparable to him. The other person was called Swordsman. I hear he only made it through the fourth level?”

“The fourth level means that his strength is at the bottom of Dragon Palace.”

“Going through the fourth level is worth 1000 points. And since he’s a newcomer, he also received 1000 points for free. In other words, he has 2000 points now.”

Yang Zaixuan should have attracted more attention, because of his brilliant results. Nevertheless, none of the disciples of Dragon Palace looked at him. All eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Their eyes were full of expectation.

“It looks like I’m popular.” Jian Wushuang noticed that their eyes sparkled with eagerness, the corner of his mouth lifted up.

“Haha, you are Swordsman, right?” A laughter could be heard along with the question. Then a red-haired young man with a saber on his back appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. The aura of Spiritual Power in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm spread out. He said, with an expectant look, “I’m Zhang Tao. I hear you have gone through the fourth level of the Dragon Gate. So have I. Do you have the guts to have a fair fight with me?”

Looking at Zhang Tao, Jian Wushuang was delighted in his heart.

The other disciples of Dragon Palace were furious.

“Damn it. He got there first.”

“Zhang Tao is really fast.”

“I hope the newcomer does not accept his challenge.”

“Zhang Tao.” Wang Yuan frowned and shouted in a low voice. “It’s been a year since you went through the fourth level. Now your strength has improved greatly to the point that you can challenge the fifth level. Aren’t you embarrassed to talk about having a fair fight with my brother?”

“Third Younger Brother, leave him alone,” said Wang Yuan, winking at Jian Wushuang.

“What? Are you afraid of fighting with me? If you became a disciple of Dragon Palace, you must be a genius. Don’t you have the guts?” Zhang Tao spoke directly, then laughed out.

“Zhang Tao, right?” Jian Wushuang raised his head and stared at Zhang Tao with a faint smile. “You don’t need to provoke me. I accept your challenge. Tell me how many points you want to bet.”

“Cool.” Zhang Tao was glad that Jian Wushuang accepted his challenge. “I know you should have 2000 points. I will not bet for all of them, just 1500 points. That will leave you with 500 points to choose a manual from the General Hall in Secret Pavilion. What do you think?”

“1500 points? Zhang Tao, you have a huge appetite.” Wang Yuan spoke angrily.

“It’s true. He has a total of 2000 points. Only, you want 1500 points. Isn’t that too much?” A disciple of Dragon Palace spoke up from the side. He also coveted Jian Wushuang’s 2000 points. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“1500 points. It’s too much indeed. Well, I can bet 1000 points,” Jian Wushuang said.

“OK, 1000 points.” Zhang Tao agreed without hesitation, secretly delighted.

Zhang Tao thought that Jian Wushuang was not his match. Jian Wushuang had just become a disciple of Dragon Palace and had only made it through the fourth level of the Dragon Gate.

Zhang Tao went through the fourth level a year ago. Since then, his strength had improved greatly with the help of the resources from Dragon Palace. Therefore, he thought he would win this fight no matter what would happen.

He was over the moon when thinking about the 1000 points.

It was not a small amount for him, as it was hard to gain points in Dragon Palace.

“Haha, watch out.” Zhang Tao spoke.

He directly rushed forward. With a single stride, he appeared before Jian Wushuang and drew the saber on his back.
