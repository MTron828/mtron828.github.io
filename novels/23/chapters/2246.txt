They feared Emperor Bai due to the presence of the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth which stopped them from using their true powers.

Without the restrictions, they wouldn’t have even been bothered by an expert in the Chaotic Realm like Emperor Bai.

And now Emperor Bai was threatening them?

What a joke!

“Emperor Bai. I don’t think we can talk this through. Let’s settle this with our fists,” Jian Wushuang looked over at Emperor Bai and said.

“Yes,” Emperor Bai nodded his head and replied.

Hence, the battle was unavoidable.

“Just like we planned, you will take the strongest two men,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I will have no problems. You are the important one in this battle. Watch out for them,” Emperor Bai said.

“Don’t worry,” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said.

Emperor Bai stopped wasting time as he radiated a terrifying aura. Boom~~~

A nine hundred and ninety thousand foot tall golden figure appeared behind him as a sea of golden divine power ocean swept out in all directions.

“You are Old Monster Jiao? If you want to take revenge for your ride, come at me,” Emperor Bai’s voice thundered.

“Die! Chen Qi, help me kill him. As for the rest of you, continue to break that formation. After we destroy the formation, kill everyone on Thunderbolt Island!!”

Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi then flew towards Emperor Bai.

Both of them were experts above the Divine Demon Realm. Even with the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, the fighting power they had was that of an expert in the Half-Step Divine Demon Realm.

They worked together and were not afraid of Emperor Bai.

Before long, their fight began.

Terrifying waves of aura and power could be felt from the battle.

The experts from the Ancient Past in the Divine Demon Realm were amazed when they felt the power of the battle.

“Emperor Bai is really powerful!”

“Under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, we in the Divine Demon Realm can barely use the power of Peak Chaotic Realm. Experts like Lord Jiao and Lord Chen Qi are both experts above the Divine Demon Realm, yet they can only use power up to Half-Step Divine Demon Realm. However, Emperor Bai has the fighting power of an ordinary expert in the Divine Demon Realm.”

“None of us can beat him alone. However, he cannot do anything while Lord Jiao and Lord Chen Qi keep him busy. We have sufficient time to destroy Sanctuary Alliance.”

These experts in the Divine Demon Realm chatted casually.

The other experts in the Divine Demon Realm would follow Chu He’s orders as he was the subordinate of Old Monster Jiao. He commanded, “Xian Meng, continue to look for a way to destroy the formation. As for the rest of you, prepare for battle. Oh yes, there is one more man.”

Chu He looked over at the space in front of him.

A lone figure stood there.

That man was Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang held a long sword and he walked slowly towards these experts in the Divine Demon Realm.

He walked slowly with a cold expression. He was not radiating any aura or sword essence at all.

The twenty experts from the ancient past were confused.

“This brat is the Sword Emperor?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“That should be the case. Apparently, he is known as the most talented man in this era. He cultivated for tens of thousands of years and was already one of the most powerful men in this era.”

“Tens of thousands of years? Just to reach where he is? This is also considered talent? Bullshit.”

“He has not been to our home town, Absolute Beginning Divine World. He is not even a tier-three genius back there.”

These experts in the Divine Demon Realm chatted casually.

None of them took Jian Wushuang seriously.

In this era, they only took Emperor Bai from the Sanctuary Alliance seriously. Even though Jian Wushuang was very popular within the Eternal Chaotic World, they could not be bothered with him.

“From the looks of it, this brat wants to fight us?”

“Hehe. He has courage. He is not retreating even though he is facing twenty experts in the Divine Demon Realm alone.”

“Who will kill him? I don’t like him.”

Jian Wushuang continued walking towards them, yet the experts in the Divine Demon Realm were not vigilant at all.

“Sword Emperor... Even though the Sword Emperor is not very powerful, he has incredible techniques. Most importantly, he is close to Emperor Thirteen. Hence, we cannot kill him. All we need to do is to keep him occupied,” Chu He knitted his eyebrows and said.

“Zi Xi, you’re up.”

Chu Hu looked at a devilish teenager standing beside him and said.

“What, why me?” The devilish teenager started complaining, displeased.

His fighting power was average amongst the experts in the Divine Demon Realm present. Even though his current fighting power under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth was not that of a peak stage-three great emperor, it was still more powerful than an ordinary stage-three great emperor. He could even kill the Sword Emperor.

It was a pity that the Sword Emperor had a special identity and the devilish teenager could not kill him. All he could do was to keep him occupied.

This meant that the devilish teenager had to hold back. Of course he was unwilling to go and deal with Jian Wushuang.

No one there was willing to fight Jian Wushuang.

“Stop complaining. Go. Remember, keep him occupied and don’t let him disturb us,” Chu He said sternly.

Even though the devilish teenager was unhappy, he could not say no as he went up and stopped Jian Wushuang in his tracks.

“Brat, even though I am not allowed to kill you, I can still teach you a lesson. Hence, just keep still where you are. You will experience less pain this way,” the devilish teenager folded his arms and looked at Jian Wushuang with disdain.

Jian Wushuang finally looked up.

“What, you aren’t going to fight me?” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

“Humph, I can’t be bothered with someone like you,” the devilish teenager grunted coldly.

“Is that the case? If you are not going to attack, I will,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows before smiling creepily and saying.

He attacked once he finished his sentence.

He was already in close proximity with the devilish teenager. He appeared in front of the teenager in just one step.

He swung his Blood Mountain Sword lazily.

This swing looked like it had no power at all, as though it had been a child who had swung it.

The sword sliced through the air peacefully and slowly.
