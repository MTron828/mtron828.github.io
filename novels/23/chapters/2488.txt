Chapter 2489: Three Palm Strikes!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Withstand three palm strikes from you?”

Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had speculated earlier a tyrannical sect like the Great Compassion Sect would not bow down to him easily. However, the Lord of Great Compassion Sect was more cunning when dealing with issues. He asked Jian Wushuang to withstand three palm strikes from him as a means to test Jian Wushuang’s strength. If Jian Wushuang was not strong enough, he would die under the three palm strikes and the problem would be resolved.

However, if those three palm strikes had neither killed nor injured Jian Wushuang, Yun Zhen planned on making an excuse to retreat so as to avoid getting humiliated.

One could not help but to admit that, as the Lord of Great Compassion Sect who made the sect flourish for many years, Yun Zhen was good at dealing with matters.

“Very well, I’ll take on your three palm strikes,” said Jian Wushuang while nodding.

“Right here?” Yun Zhen asked.

“Sure. Let’s do it high up in the sky to avoid disturbing the city below,” said Jian Wushuang.

Yun Zhen nodded. “Very well, here comes the first strike.”

Immediately after his voice faded, a majestic breath of divine powers began to gather within his palm.

Everyone around was stunned at that divine power breath was a few times more powerful than a regular Ultimate Gods’.

As divine powers gathered to a certain point, Yun Zhen’s right hand turned into a warm jade before striking forward at the void.

The strike seemed so nonchalant, but instantly stirred up a world of its own.

Boom~~~ A heaven shaking energy began forming.

A tall crystalized palm that covered half of Blazing Moon City formed out of thin air.

The crystallized palm crushed the void and everything it came across before striking directly at Jian Wushuang.

When the palm appeared, countless cultivators in Blazing Moon City raised their heads in shock and desperation.

If that palm was to strike down on Blazing Moon City, the entire city would turn into ashes.

Jian Wushuang was calmly watching that palm striking heading toward him. He shifted his body and swung out with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

A blurry almost dreamy sword-shadow swept outward.

The sword-light swept toward the crystalized palm and sliced it apart right in the middle with a shattering noise. A complete trace of sword slash appeared and the palm was sliced into two halves.

Large amounts of shattered crystalized divine power began to fan outwards, causing the void to suddenly become very colorful.

However, both divine power and sword essence were confined in the skies, therefore not affecting Blazing Moon City at all.

“It’s proven that you have good battle strength since you’re able to shatter the charged palm strike containing 70% of my strength so easily, but watch out for the next one... I’ll be using all of my powers. It’s an ultimate secret technique that I created myself,” said Yun Zhen.

“Just come toward me.” Jian Wushuang smiled with excitement shining in his eyes.

Yun Zhen squinted as surges of divine power began to gather in his palm again, but this time it was more expanded and powerful than before.

A thin layer of red light appeared on the surface of his body as his palm gradually became blood-red.

With the power charged to its maximum, the blood-red palm was suddenly sent outwards.

“Giant Devil Ape!” Yun Zhen yelled out sharply.

Boom~~~ The Heavens and Earth shook. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The ever-expanding red light lashed out together with the palm and began to crystalize. It formed a huge object in the blink of an eye.

It was a several hundred meters tall fierce-looking Giant Devil Ape.

The Devil Ape had blood-red eyes while swinging its pair of thick strong arms. Its upward roar caused ripples between Heaven and Earth before its body burst straight towards Jian Wushuang. There were terrifying energies pressing against Jian Wushuang. Perhaps even Early-Stage Ultimate Gods such as Lei Chong and Fan Jianxian would have failed to block such an attack.

‘The Lord of Great Compassion Sect is truly a High-Level Ultimate God. His abilities are truly remarkable.’

Jian Wushuang was exclaiming in his mind as he watched the Giant Devil Ape charging at him.

However, in the next moment, the Stellar Strength within his body began to violently rise.

Using the Stellar Strength within, Jian Wushuang’s energy had surged a great deal so did his strength which had also increased immensely.

He held tightly on Blood Mountain Sword which was making waves of neighing sounds before taking a leap.

Jian Wushuang nonchalantly swung the sword sideways...

Just a nonchalant swing without sword-light or sword-shadows bursting out. There were no ripples either.

The void in front of him was calm as well.

However, under the calmness...

Ring!

A gigantic sword-light appeared out of nowhere.

The sword-light—as if connecting Heaven and Earth—was extremely bright and captivating. The moment it appeared, it became the core of Heaven and Earth, the focal point of it. It had even turned eternal.

Throughout the oceans and wilderness, Heaven and Earth aligned!

The sword-light appeared before the Giant Devil Ape following a string of whipping noises.

The Giant Devil Ape roared maniacally and lashed out violently with its two arms.

Boom!!!

A terrifying rumble suddenly filled the air.

The entire void was trembling as shapeless airwaves swirled up and swept in from multiple directions.

Finally, the Giant Devil Ape was completely dissolved and the sword-light which Jian Wushuang unleashed had disappeared as well.

Jian Wushuang’s body shook as he took a small step backward.

As for Yun Zhen, he did not retreat even a bit since Jian Wushuang was slightly below his skill level.

“To be able to take my palm strike just now proves you’re already above the three Supreme Elders of Great Compassion Sect. However, what I’m going to unleash next is my most powerful creation and also my deadliest strike. It’s called ‘Crimson Elephants’!”

Yun Zhen’s voice was cold as his hands had not even stopped for a while as he issued his third palm strike right after Jian Wushuang took his second.

Boom!

Heaven and Earth shook again as blood mist exploded into the air immediately after that. The entire Void above Blazing Moon City had turned crimson as though it was inside an ocean of blood.

Powerful energies were gathered at the center of the blood ocean. A total of three gigantic creatures were formed within a moment.

This time it was not Giant Devil Apes that were formed, but three larger Crimson Elephants. The Crimson Elephants were over a hundred meters tall, incomparably huge, and were projecting deadly energy from their bodies. After they were formed, the three Crimson Elephants trumpeted loudly before charging fiercely toward Jian Wushuang.

Judging from the Crimson Elephants’ momentum, even a mountain would be shattered into pieces, let alone a mere person.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned stern, but the excitement in his eyes was burning even brighter.

Behind him, a great deal of golden-colored divine power was swirling. A thousand meters tall Golden God Shadow was formed.
