Chapter 531: A Cornered Beast Will Always Bite

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Rebel?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “You certainly know how to twist things!”

“Rebel?” The black-clothed elder also looked at Jian Wushuang.

“General, I arrived at the East Camp two months ago and was appointed as the leader of the tenth squad. I was immediately sent to guard the Sky Solitude Mountains and have stayed there since then.” Jian Wushuang reported, “The East Camp’s rule is that all squads will guard the Sky Solitude Mountains in turns. Every month a new squad will take over.”

“Last month, Fang Han sent a message that other squads were understaffed because they had fought with Demonic Beasts and we had to keep guarding there. However, this month he didn’t even give us any notice. That’s why I came here to ask for an explanation.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Asking for an explanation? That’s how you ask?” Fang Han stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Shut up,” The black-clothed elder snapped. He looked at Fang Han and said, “It’s no wonder that he came here to challenge you. They can rarely meet any Demonic Beasts in the Sky Solitude Mountains, so they have little chance of obtaining Monster Cores, but they can’t just leave.”

“That’s why East Camp set the rule of one-month shifts for every squad. But, you not only forced them to guard it for two months, had Jian Wushuang not come here to challenge you, you would?have left them there to continue guarding the area, wouldn’t you?”

“Well...” Fang Han’s expression changed slightly, but he dared not refute?him.

“Hum, don’t think that I don’t understand what’s going on in your head. As a commander who is this unfair to your subordinates. Why would he respect you? Not to mention that he’s stronger than you.” The black-clothed elder said coldly, “Well, this is the end of the matter. Arrange another squad to go to the Sky Solitude Mountains immediately. As for your injuries, take them as the punishment for violating the rules in East Camp.”

After saying that, the black-clothed elder immediately left.

“How can this be?” Fang Han stood there with eyes full of astonishment.

The general scolded him without making any mention of Jian Wushuang’s fault. Jian Wushuang had fought with his superior but was not punished at all.

The elder obviously favored Jian Wushuang.

The other sergeants in the surrounding area had also realized it.

Jian Wushuang was also quite surprised.

Though confused, Jian Wushuang did not spend much time thinking about it. He took a quick glance at Fang Han and considered his next step.

Under the gaze of the other sergeants, Jian Wushuang, while still holding his sword, stepped in front of Fang Han.

“What are you going to do?” Fang Han stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked down at Fang Han who was lying on the ground and said, indifferently, “Commander Fang Han, it seems that you lost out this time.”

Fang Han’s expression changed slightly.

Jian Wushuang bent down and whispered in Fang Han’s ear, “Fang Han, I know that you were told to do this to spite me. He has a special identity, so you did not dare to displease him. That’s normal.”

“However, before you made things difficult for me, you should have weighted your own strength. I respected you as a commander, so I didn’t disgrace you in front of others. But you shouldn’t go too far!”

“A corned beast will bite. Especially if that beast is stronger than you!”

Fang Han half lay on the ground with a gloomy expression on his face. He felt ashamed and resentful when he heard Jian Wushuang’s words. However, he dared not refute them.

This world was ruled by the strong. Jian Wushuang was obviously stronger than he was!

So he was unable to refute what Jian Wushuang said.

While gritting his teeth, Fang Han said in a low voice, “I’ll immediately arrange for another squad to take over guarding the Sky Solitude Mountains!?”

“Hmph, it’s good you know what you should do.”

Jian Wushuang stood up and directly returned to the Sky Solitude Mountains.

He did not know that the thin black-clothed elder was standing above them at the edge of the campsite, watching as he left.

Another man stood next to him. This handsome man with long-hair was none other than Emperor Fengxiao.

“You asked me to go down there while you stayed up here. Fengxiao, what’s your relationship with that boy?” the black-clothed elder asked.

He was actually asked by Emperor Fengxiao to come here and help Jian Wushuang.

“I’ve only seen him once previously, but he has great potential. When he had just arrived here from his tribe, he was already equal to a peak Second-grade Divine General and had an extremely strong body. What’s even more important though, is his extraordinary comprehension in Sword Principle.” Emperor Fengxiao explained casually, “After being enlightened by his swordsmanship, I easily and quickly mastered a new sword move.”

“What?” The black-clothed elder was shocked.

Emperor Fengxiao had an extremely deep comprehension in regards to Sword Principle. In truth, very few people on the Monster Continent could compare with him in Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was capable of enlightening Emperor Fengxiao?

“From the looks of it, he has greatly improved since his participation in the Divine General assessment. I’ll naturally favor a young man who has such great potential. What’s more, it’s Fang Han’s fault,” Emperor Fengxiao said.

The black-clothed elder raised his eyebrows but didn’t say anything.

“Well, no need to continue talking about them. Let’s go meet Temple Master Pure Moon. The wedding of the two Monster Kings is by no means a good thing for us humans,” Emperor Fengxiao said seriously.

“All right,” the black-clothed elder nodded solemnly. They immediately left to meet Temple Master Pure Moon, who was the head of the East Camp.

In the campsite of the Seventh Army, Fang Han was busy dealing with his wounds in a hasty manner before he returned to his tent.

He immediately ordered, “Command the third squad to take over the Sky Solitude Mountains. Tell Jin Ling, the leader of the ninth squad, to come see me quickly.”

“Yes, sir.” A sergeant immediately left to deliver his order.

Before long, Jin Ling followed a sergeant and came to meet Fang Han.

“Commander Fang Han, I heard that Jian Wushuang came to see you today.”

Jin Ling had been on a mission outside before this, so he did not know what happened. He only heard that Jian Wushuang came to meet Fang Han. He thought that Fang Han must have sent Jian Wushuang away, so he was quite pleased.

“Jian Wushuang, you didn’t make me happy, so you won’t be happy in the future,”Jin Ling thought with pride.

However, He frowned the moment he saw Fang Han in the tent.

“Commander Fang Han, what happened...” He noticed that Fang Han was dreadfully pale.

Obviously, Fang Han was injured, and seriously injured at that.

“Hum, it’s all thanks to you.”

Fang Han replied coldly. His attitude toward Jin Ling had completely changed.
