Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In fact, Jian Wushuang did have some confidence in tomorrow’s Sect Competition.

“The Heavenly Creation Skill is amazingly helpful. I have been able to cultivate ten times faster than before since I reached the Heaven-treading Realm. This has been the most efficient period of my life so far. At my current level, I can roll through Feng and the other disciples.”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

With Xuan Yi as his master, possessing treasures like the Nine-world Picture, Slaughter Book, and a Dao Origin Fruit, all of this contributed to his making achievements that were beyond belief at the time. Not to mention that he also had two Original Bodies cultivating separately at Enlightenment Mountain.

He was confident that he could defeat Feng and the other disciples in the competition.

“It all depends on tomorrow.”?A light of firmness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as he clenched his hands.

The next day, the ten-year Sect Competition began.

The whole sect was bustling with people.

This competition was the only way that outer disciples could become inner disciples, so they valued this chance very much. They were dying for the opportunity to cultivate at Enlightenment Mountain like the inner disciples because it meant they could cultivate three times faster than in other places.

The rules for the competition were quite simple. The top 10 outer disciples and the 10 weakest from among the inner disciples would fight each other for the 10 empty positions to be inner disciples.

At first light, the fight among the outer disciples began and the list of the top 10 was released at noon.

As for their opponents, the masters directly appointed 10 inner disciples to fight against them, including Jian Wushuang, Feng, and Huo Ying. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At one of the Sects large Martial Arts Practice Fields, which was used to hold competitions, the 10 outer disciples and 10 inner disciples stood at the center of the field, surrounded by many other disciples who desired to watch the battles.

“10 outer disciples and 10 inner disciples.”?Jian Wushuang looked around and saw many new faces.

He had spent the last two years cultivating alone, so he had little contacts with others.

Nevertheless, he had heard some things about them from his talks with Feng and Huo Ying.

Overall, the outer disciples were powerful, and some of them had comprehended up to the third Occult. Jian Wushuang believed the top 10 must have at least reached that level.

While looking around, he noticed a bronze-skinned burly man with a fierce aura. The man was called Luo Yong and he was recognized as the number one among all the outer disciples. Rumors had it that he had comprehended the fouth Occult.

Besides that man, there was a white-clothed woman who also caught many eyes.

She was named Dong’er. Even though she was regarded as being the weakest among the inner disciples, she was, in fact, very powerful and had comprehended the fouth Occult.

There seemed to be a very good chance that those two would win a place as inner disciples.

The same was true for Feng.

Apart from them, there were several other geniuses who might succeed in the competition as well.

As for the rest of them, it remained to be seen.

Jian Wushuang was among the rest.

This was because he had been immersed in cultivating and had not battled against the others over the years or adventured in the Dao Tower. No one knew how strong he really was.

“The competition is about to start, but how will it start?”

The onlookers discussed in confusion.

Generally, the Sect Competition would be decided by many rounds of fighting, but it wasn’t the same every year.

Right then, a stunning figure appeared on the field. It was no?other than the Vice Master of Sword Palace, Ling Yu, Jian Wushuang’s acquaintance.

She was the hostess of the competition.

As soon as she landed on the field, she crushed a token and a huge wormhole immediately appeared before everyone’s eyes. Her voice then echoed.

“This time, the Sect Competition will be held inside the Ninth Heaven Road.”

The words caused an uproar among the audience.

“Ninth Heaven Road!”

“This is beyond my expectation.”

“Haha, those competitors have a lot suffering ahead of them as they walk through those 31 floors.”

“Ninth Heaven Road is a separate space, so we won’t be able to see their performance, only their final results. What a pity!”

The onlookers sighed.

Jian Wushuang had heard of the Ninth Heaven Road before.

It had 31 floors in total, with an obstacle on each floor. The more powerful one was, the higher he could reach.

The Ninth Heaven Road had been used several times before during the Sect Competition and it had been proven that it could test the disciple’s power by having all 20 disciples climb the floors together.

“Jian Wushuang, you must have progressed a lot, right?” Feng suddenly looked toward Jian Wushuang and asked.

Jian Wushuang seemed surprised by this question. “Just a bit.”

“well, let’s see who can go further in this competition,” Feng added.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.
