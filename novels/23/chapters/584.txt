Chapter 585: Emperor Xiao!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As they watched Temple Master Iceberg fail to block three moves from Jian Wushuang, every Temple Master felt that their heart skipped a beat.

Temple Master Iceberg was regarded as being extremely strong among the Temple Masters. At the very least, he was much stronger than the ordinary Temple Masters. Nevertheless, even he failed to block those three sword moves. If Jian Wushuang wanted to kill them, it was likely that he only needed one move.

It was so incredible for a Cloud Realm expert to be so strong!

After killing Temple Master Iceberg, Jian Wushuang bowed to Temple Master Black Spirit and remounted the huge Bone Dragon.

“Let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Yang Zaixuan faintly nodded his head.

High up in the air, ten more huge Bone Dragons turned around and flew toward the depths of the Monster Territory.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor also led his Monster Army away.

This riot had finally come to an end.

Countless human experts sighed with immense relief.

After the battle, everyone remembered a name, Jian Wushuang, Sword Emperor!

Sword Emperor never appeared again, but the way he defeated Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and killed Temple Master Iceberg would definitely become a legend on the Monster Continent that would be passed on for generations.

In the depths of the Monster Territory, the Bone Dragons were flying forward rapidly.

“Second brother, how did you get to the Monster Continent? Who is your Master?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He had never imagined he would see Yang Zaixuan here, so he naturally had many doubts.

“Calm down. After you meet my Master, let’s go meet Brother Wang Yuan,” said Yang Zaixuan.

“Brother Wang Yuan is also here?” Jian Wushuang was surprised and pleased to hear that.

“He is indeed, but his days are not as good as ours,” Yang Zaixuan said with a mysterious smile.

These Bone Dragons quickly arrived at a peaceful valley.

“Here we are,” Yang Zaixuan said.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked down into the valley and saw a huge black castle.

“A Castle?”?Jian Wushuang thought. He jumped down from the Bone Dragon with Yang Zaixuan and went toward the black castle.

It was very quiet. While following Yang Zaixuan, Jian Wushuang eventually arrived in a garden with two men at a stone table.

One of the men was sitting on a stone chair. He was a grey-robed, middle-aged man who had a handsome face and delicate short dark hair. In his dark eyes, which were as vast as the galaxy, lighting was faintly flickering.

He was reading a thread-bound book.

Once Jian Wushuang arrived in this garden, he was immediately attracted by the grey-robed man unconsciously. It seemed that he had a special magic power which drew all of Jian Wushuang’s attention and made him neglect anything else.

Focus. The grey-robed man seemed ordinary, but he was the focus of surrounding energy at all times.

Jian Wushuang stood there and stared at the grey-robed man absent-mindedly. It wasn’t until a while later that he recovered to himself.

“What’s this technique?”?Jian Wushuang thought with unprecedented shock.

After he recovered himself, he finally noticed the other man.

He was surprised again as he asked, “Elder Di Jing?”

Yes, this man was Di Jing, the man who saved his life in the Divine Land and revealed his great strength.

But he was standing next to the grey-robed man with great respect, like a servant waiting on his master. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang gasped in astonishment once he figured out the identity of the grey-robed man.

In this world, only one man was qualified to be treated with such deference by Di Jing.

Leng Rushuang’s father, the mysterious Monarch from the Tang of the East!

“Second brother’s Master turned out to be him!”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

It was not the first time that he heard of this mysterious Tang Monarch.

When he was on the Nanyang Continent, he had heard some stories about the mysteriousTang Monarch. Then he was told by Di Jing that he was the seventh War God under the command of Emperor Xiao from the Tang of the East!

Apparently, Emperor Xiao was the Monarch of the Tang of the East on the Nanyang Continent.

“Master, I’ve brought brother Wushuang here,” Yang Zaixuan stood in front of the grey-robed man and said respectfully.

“Ah.” The grey-robed man stopped reading and looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately felt that all of his secrets had been exposed by his gaze.

The grey-robed man smiled and then said, “You two leave first. I have some things to discuss with this little boy.”

“Yes,” Yang Zaixuan replied and left with Di Jing.

While passing by Jian Wushuang, Di Jing even winked at him.

At this moment, only Jian Wushuang and the grey-robed man remained in the garden.

The grey-robed middle-aged man looked at Jian Wushuang with great interest. As he slowly waved his hand, a chair condensed by special energy suddenly appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

“Have a seat,” he said.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath to suppress his shock and sat down on the chair.

“Let me introduce myself. I’m Xiao Huan, but most people call me Emperor Xiao,” the grey-robed man said slowly.

“Greetings, Emperor Xiao,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

Anyone facing a stronger expert should be respectful.

Jian Wushuang had been at the top of the Ancient World in terms of his strength. Nevertheless, he?understood that he was no different from a bug in front of Emperor Xiao. He could be killed countless times by Emperor Xiao as easily as blushing off some dust.

In the face of such a super expert, Jian Wushuang had to be extremely respectful.

“Boy, don’t be nervous.” Emperor Xiao smiled and said in a gentle voice, “By the way, I need to thank you.”

“Thank me?” Jian Wushuang was in a daze.

“You removed part of the Icy Heart Poison in my daughter’s body, which relieved her pain a lot. Of course, I need to thank you,” Emperor Xiao laughed.

“It’s no bother. She has also helped me several times,” Jian Wushuang replied with dignity.

Emperor Xiao raised his eyebrows and laughed. He asked, “I guess you don’t know why I invited you here.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He was indeed full of doubts.

“Rest assured. You’ll understand when you see this,” Emperor Xiao said and took out something.
