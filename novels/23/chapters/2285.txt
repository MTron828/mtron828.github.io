“Cast Spacetime Reversal to revive that little one?”The beautiful lady stared at Xuan Yi and said, “It looks like your consciousness incarnation cannot completely revive him. You can only revive his soul. I am curious: what are you trying to achieve?”

The three Masters of Holy Land could not guess the purpose behind Xuan Yi’s actions.

“Wait, in your current condition, it is not easy to cast Spacetime Reversal. After you cast it, your consciousness incarnation will disappear immediately. Even so, you still chose to revive this little one. Before this, you also opened a reincarnation passage. Are you trying to send this little one’s soul into Samsara?” The bald man turned pale.

“Send him into Samsara?” The beautiful lady and the woman in crimson clothes were stunned.

“Indeed, you are the smartest among the few Masters of the Holy Land.” Xuan Yi smiled coldly before he fell silent. He continued after a few moments, “I have to thank all three of you. If the three of you had not paid a hefty price to open the passageway, it would not have been possible for this reincarnation passage to appear as well.”

Xuan Yi spoke the truth.

The reason why the reincarnation passage was able t appear was all thanks to the three Masters of the Holy Land.

“You planned all of this from the start. You even planned for us to open the passageway so that you could open the reincarnation passage? Why are you doing this?” the beautiful lady said as she shook her head. She clenched her teeth tightly as she was utterly surprised.

“Even though that little one is talented, what exactly is it about him that would make you be willing to pay such a hefty price and plan over all these aeons just to send him into Samsara?”

The beautiful lady and the other two Masters of the Holy Land were confused.

What was the point of sending an expert in the Chaotic Realm into Samsara?

Was he hoping that this little one could become one of the strongest men in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, or even save this Heaven and Earth?

Was that possible?

“Haha. You guys will never guess.” Xuan Yi smiled and did not elaborate at all.

“Humph. We do not need to guess what you are planning. However, I know that no matter what you want to do, the three of us will give our all to stop you. You want to send him into Samsara? We will stop him outside of the Reincarnation Passage and destroy his soul once again. I want to see if you can still cast Spacetime Reversal again in that condition!” the beautiful lady said coldly.

“Do you think the three of you can stop me?” Xuan Yi said coldly in a condescending tone.

“We shall see,” the bald man spoke.

The three Masters of the Holy Land were prepared to stop Xuan Yi.

Even though they were mere consciousness embodiments, Xuan Yi had it worse. He was only a consciousness incarnation. He should not have had any fighting power at all. Only Emperor Thirteen was near the same power level as them. It was almost impossible for him to send Jian Wushuang’s soul into the incarnation passage.

When Xuan Yi saw this, he fell silent. He then shook his head, “it is useless. You underestimated me. I have been planning for this date for aeons. How can I not have a perfect plan thought out?”

The three Masters of the Holy Land turned pale.

All of a sudden, Xuan Yi looked up and said with a majestic voice, “People of the Seven Star Black Sect, awaken!”

This majestic voice was not very loud. However, it fused into the restrictive formation within this Heaven and Earth.

His voice could be heard across the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

It was strange as the ordinary people and countless cultivators who were considerably weak could not hear this voice at all.

Even the extremely powerful people like great emperors or almighties who were close to the realm of great emperors could barely hear it.

His voice was transmitted to every single corner of the Eternal Chaotic World, including Ancient Mystery Land and the respective ancient battlefields.

Instantly, the ancient battlefields started to shake.

The most important battles of the Great Battle of the Ancient Past had taken place around the ancient battlefield around the Green Fire World.

Ever since this ancient battlefield had been found, many almighties began to go there and explore all year round.

After all these years, countless opportunities and treasures had been found.

However, no one had found the true secrets hiding beneath this ancient battlefield.

At the centre of the battlefield was a unique place. It was a gigantic volcano.

This volcano stretched across numerous mountains. At the centre of the battlefield, there was a sea of fire.

The flames within this sea of fire were extremely terrifying. Many almighties ventured there and wanted to go deeper into the sea of fire to explore.

However, they could only step foot into the outermost area of his sea of fire before they would be forced out.

They had no way in. The outermost flame could easily burn any expert in the chaotic realm into ash. Even great emperors could not take the heat.

After all these years, no one knew what was inside the sea of fire.

No one dared or had the ability to explore.

Just then...

“People of the Seven Star Black Sect, awaken!”

The majestic voice was heard there through the restrictive formation.

Instantly, the sea of fire that lit up the mountains started to weaken at an incredible speed.

The sea of fire started to weaken and disappear. All that was left was the earth, glowing amber.

At the centre of this place, the centre of the sea of fire, stood a figure three meters tall.

He was wearing crimson armour. His helmet, boots, and even his skin were crimson red.

He radiated no aura at all. It was as though this three-meter-tall figure was like a battle puppet.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes. The moment his eyes opened, a blazing flame was lit and started to burn within his eyes. It was as though he could burn everything with a single thought.

This crimson red figure raised his head and looked into the sky above.

There, Heaven and Earth stirred as a huge Space Tunnel was formed.

The crimson red figure took a step and disappeared instantly inside the tunnel.
