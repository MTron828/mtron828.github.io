Chapter 1368: Reset Palace

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Rank three unique skill!”

“It’s only the first floor but this person performed a rank three unique skill and it’s an advanced rank three unique skill!”

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

Only the first floor and he was defeated.

If he wanted to pass through the third level and cultivate the second secret skill in Scripture Depository, it’d be a joke.

“That’s not right. Even though in Lineage of Star is filled with top geniuses, the test of the Star Tower didn’t have to be that difficult, right?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

He, a Universe God in the First Heaven went to the first floor of Star Tower but the opponent on the first floor performed a rank three unique skill straightway. What kind of sorcery was that?

“Unless…” Jian Wushuang suddenly thought of a possibility, “Unless the Star Tower didn’t treat me as a Universe God in the First Heaven, but… the Second Heaven!”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew strange the moment he thought of the possibility.

“I finally understood why Lei Chao said that I, a Universe God in the First Heaven, pretending to be a Universe God in the Second Heaven would be at a disadvantage. I guess that’s why.”

The training field in the Lineage of Star was set according to the cultivator’s level.

The starting point for a Universe God in the First Heaven and a Universe God in the Second Heaven was definitely different.

Take the Star Tower, for instance, if it were to be other disciples who were Universe Gods in the First Heaven who would go to the first floor of Star Tower, the opponent on the first floor would only perform an advanced rank two unique skill at most.

If Star Tower only treated Jian Wushuang as a Universe God in the First Heaven, he naturally could pass through the test easily.

However, the crucial part was that Star Tower took him as a Universe God in the Second Heaven!

“I only created a Peak rank two unique skill then. However, the opponent from the first floor in Star Tower only could perform advanced rank three unique skill. It is a few levels different. In other words, I am far from passing through the first floor of Star Tower,” Jian Wushuang sighed. However, he didn’t think it was unfair for him.

He was an inverse cultivator after all!

Comparing an inverse cultivator to an ordinary cultivator, the starting point itself should be a level higher.

A Universe God in the First Heaven that did inverse cultivation was really treated like a Universe God in the Second Heaven in the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Senior.”

Qu Yang walked over and looked at Jian Wushuang in suspicion. He found it strange and asked, “Senior, which floor in Star Tower were you in?”

“This…” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly, “To be frank, I didn’t even pass the first floor and I am far from passing.”

“You can’t even pass the first floor?” Qu Yang creased his eyebrows.

A disciples of Star Palace, couldn’t even pass through the first floor in Star Palace and he was far from passing?

What was going on?

One must know, in Lineage of Star, even with those ordinary disciples, more than ninety percent of them could pass through the first floor and some could even pass through the second floor!

“Would it be because he was careless and he didn’t put his full ability to play at the very first moment, that’s why he was defeated?” Qu Yang thought to himself. It seemed to be the only explanation he could find.

Otherwise, a disciple of the Star Palace who didn’t even pass through the first floor of Star Tower was definitely a joke.

“Senior, why don’t I bring you to the Reset Palace and take a look?” Qu Yang said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Qu Yang then brought Jian Wushuang to Reset Palace.

In Lineage of Star, only disciples of the Star Palace were qualified to enter the Reset Palace.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate but stepped foot into Reset Palace straightaway.

The moment Jian Wushuang entered the palace, he could feel a shapeless force greet him.

“This is… an Assault of consciousness?”

“No, not only consciousness, it also contained magic and even a mind devil!”

“This…”

Jian Wushuang suddenly beamed.

He had cultivated for ten years in Tian Yuan Mystery Land back in Snow Kingdom.

In those ten years, he had gained a huge reward, but Tian Yuan Mystery Land was mainly about the assault of consciousness. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, the Reset Palace not only had assault of consciousness, it also contained magic and mind devils. Jian Wushuang could also manipulate the strength of magic and mind devils. It was obviously much more outstanding compared to Tian Yuan Mystery Land’s sole assault of consciousness.

“I heard long ago that there was a place in the Lineage of Star that trains and nourishes consciousness. I finally get to see it. It’s really extraordinary,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“The higher ups in Lineage of Star really know how to nurture their disciples. They started to think about how to improve their disciples’ strength of consciousness when they were just Universe Gods. They even created Reset Palace for this purpose and also the test in Illusionary Mind Sea. They are paving a way for their disciples!”

King of Venomous Worms complimented.

Jian Wushuang could hear what King of Venomous Worms said.

He heard from King of Venomous Worms that, to become the top expert in the Eternal Chaotic World, which was to become an Almighty, one had to pass a barrier.

The barrier was to light up his Soul Fire!

How difficult it was to light up Soul Fire?

Just like Jian Wushuang, who was an inverse cultivator, he lit up his Soul Fire when he was a Universe Master. However, an ordinary cultivator put in all their effort and paid a huge price, and it’d still be rather difficult to light up their Soul Fire.

The inability to light up their Soul Fire meant the inability for them to take the leap towards the rest of their lives.

To light up their Soul Fire, consciousness was the crucial element. The consciousness was required to be trained step by step since it was weak. It was required to improve bit by bit, especially during their time as Universe God. The training and improvement of consciousness was extremely important!

Due to this, Lineage of Star intentionally created Reset Palace especially to improve and nourish their disciples’ consciousness. Their intention was to lay a great foundation and pave a way that leads them to take the greatest leap.

Even though the chance was slim, they could at least try.

“The Reset Palace was useful for me to improve my Soul Power. If I were to cultivate here, my Soul Power would definitely improve tremendously. I reckon it wouldn’t be long until I reach the level of a Universe God in the Third Heaven.”

“Plus, there’s help from the Meta beasts!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining brightly.

When Lei Chao talked about Reset Palace back then, he said that he could try to catch a few Meta beasts and use the meta strength them to nourish consciousness. Then, he would improve even more greatly.

“Go and catch Meta beasts!”

Jian Wushuang immediately headed outside of Reset Palace.

When Jian Wushuang met Qu Yang outside of Reset Palace, he clarified his intention with Qu Yang.

“Qu Yang, I shall capture Meta beasts on my own. It will not be necessary for you to lead the way,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If so, I shall excuse myself,” Qu Yang said.

“Sorry for the trouble,” Jian Wushuang thanked him again.
