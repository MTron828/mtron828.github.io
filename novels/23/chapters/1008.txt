Chapter 1009: God Hong

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In mere moments, the numerous warriors of the Black Python Clan who were formerly seething with bloodthirsty rage were all routed.

Jian Wushuang’s angry roar had struck so great a fear into their hearts that their blood froze. None of them dared to stay and endure his wrath.

“Master Wushuang.” Qing Bin went to Jian Wushuang immediately. The rest of the Rock Demon Clan gazed at Jian Wushuang with gratitude and awe.

“Thank you for rescuing us, Master Wushuang.” Qing Bin said.

If it were not for Jian Wushuang’s help, he and his kin would have been slaughtered by the Black Python Clan.

“Why the hostilities by the Black Python Clan?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It is as thus.”

Qing Bin explained, “There are nearly a hundred races and clans in this region. Among these populations, the Rock Demon Clan and the Black Python Clan reigned the strongest; both are the stronger populations around here. Hence, conflicts and battles ensue tirelessly as both clans fought to maintain their influence and interests. Animosity between both clans have persisted for many years now.”

“I see…” Jian Wushuang remarked, his eyebrows raising with faint surprise.?“The Rock Demon Clan one of the stronger populations?”

Prior to arriving here, he had presumed that the Rock Demon Clan was a common or lesser population. Never did he knew that the Clan was a stronger population that commanded a minor degree of authority.

Even across the entire Samsara Continent, the stronger populations numbered few and scarce. They were clans or race that possessed considerably potent overall strength.

“Take me to God Hong, Qing Bin.” Jian Wushuang said promptly.

“Yes.”

Qing Bin immediately led the way. Before long, they reached the stronghold of the Rock Demon Clan.

The stronghold of the Rock Demon Clan was surrounded by a ring of mountains. Within the bastion of the clan were numerous buildings and structures that housed millions of their kin.

Even among the stronger populations, it was rare for a race to have a population of millions of kinsmen. The Rock Demon Clan, was beyond any doubt, one of the stronger populations that commanded respectable overall strength over the lesser races and clans. Still, it was among the weakest of stronger populations across the Continent. They have ten Dao Masters in their midst, the least possible number of Dao Masters for stronger populations.

The greatest warrior of the clan, was none other than God Hong, a Dao Master of Rank Three. Still, he wielded only the elementary proficiency of Rank Three. It was the awakened Rock Demon bloodline that flowed through his veins which had endowed him with an extremely sturdy physique, allowing him a slight edge even in fights against Rank Three Dao Masters with advanced proficiency.

Following closely behind Qing Bin, Jian Wushuang was led directly into the bastion of the Rock Demon Clan, where he was arranged for an audience with God Hong in a grand hall.

Clad in armor of cyan hue, God Hong was a bald man who towered at an intimidating height of more than five meters. There he stood, they saw, at the forefront of the hall like a huge mountain.

“Is he God Hong?” Jian Wushuang asked himself, staring at God Hong with astonishment and disbelief.

The mere shred of consciousness of God Hong during their encounter in the Ancient World had left a vivid and lasting impression that had never ceased to awe him. Jian Wushuang could hardly forget the amazement and awe that he reserved especially for the consciousness that was shaped by the residual powers left in a mere severed finger of God Hong.

Yet, now, meeting God Hong for the first time in person, Jian Wushuang could hardly feel neither admiration nor adoration for the person he once respected.

“Brother Hong, it is I, Qing Bin, who has returned!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qing Bin rushed over to God Hong and fell to his knees before the hulking man with great excitement, bowing his head down on the ground with utmost reverence as his voice echoed through the alcoves of the hall.

“It is good that you have returned. On your feet now.” Relieved and comforted, God Hong dismissed with a simple wave of his hand as he watched his long-lost kin immediately got to his feet.

“This is Master Jian Wushuang, Brother Hong. He is the reason that I am able to return alive. More so, it was he who had earlier saved our kinsmen from the Black Python Clan and had routed their warriors.”

“Oh?” God Hong turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“My name is Jian Wushuang, Senior. My deepest respects to you.” Jian Wushuang greeted him.

“Jian Wushuang?” God Hong asked strangely. There was a faint glimpse of recognition in his eyes.

“You might remember, Senior, that many years before, a severed finger of yours had fallen into a domain called the Ancient World. The finger contained a sliver of your consciousness. The consciousness from the severed finger had encountered a young fellow and had taught him the Immortality Secret Skill. The young fellow was also imparted with the technique of Enhanced Magic: Thunderbolt.” Jian Wushuang said, smiling.

God Hong’s gaze instantly transfixed upon Jian Wushuang with a surprised stare as he realized who Jian Wushuang was. He said, “You were the young man from the Ancient World?”

“I am.” Jian Wushuang said.

“How is this possible?” God Hong looked at Jian Wushuang with amazement. He said, “You were but a fresh sapling then, still young and untrained in combat and martial skills when the shred of my consciousness met you. It has hardly been two thousand years… and yet, in such a short time, you have managed to achieve such power and strength.”

God Hong was filled with astonishment.

He had merely intended to show some kindness to a helpless weakling when they first met. Despite once encouraging Jian Wushuang to reach for greater heights and proposing that the young man visit him in the future, he did not expect that Jian Wushuang would indeed thrive and progress so swiftly.

But now… Jian Wushuang had indeed come to him in less than two thousand years?

“You had saved Qing Bin, and had repelled our enemies from the Black Python Clan. I simply don’t know how to express my gratitude to you.” God Hong said with a smile.

“You are being too polite, Senior. I would not be here if it were not for the kindness that you have shown me so many years ago.” Jian Wushuang said.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang spoke true. His encounter with God Hong had given him the means which enabled the breakthrough of his strength and granted him the Immortality Secret Skill.

The very same Immortality Secret Skill had been key to his continued success.

It was hardly an exaggeration that it was God Hong who had paved the way for Jian Wushuang’s climb to power.

“Hahaha… I had helped you then because I had perceived you as a pleasant and likable young man. Yet, never would I be able to foretell that you would be able to blossom and thrive to such greatness.” God Hong burst into laughter as all semblances of his intimidating and stern self immediately diminished.

Just then…

“Eh?” God Hong muttered with surprise. His expression took a drastic change.

“What is wrong, Brother Hong?” Qing Bin asked, looking at God Hong.

“It’s a beacon calling for help. I must look into it right away.” God Hong said grimly.

“Could it be the Black Python Clan again?” Qing Bin asked, his face darkened with gloom.

“I am afraid it is true. There have been many changes within the Black Python Clan while you were away. They have revolutionized their inner workings that they have now landed us, the Rock Demon Clan in a very dire and disadvantaged position.” God Hong lamented with a sigh before he turned to glance at Jian Wushuang.

“I am afraid I have business to attend to, young friend. Our conversation will have to continue some other time. Please stay with us and enjoy our hospitality while you’re here. Qing Bin will show you around our clan. There is an area which might interest you; it is a place where it might be useful to students in the skills of swordsmanship like you. Qing Bin will lead you there as well.”

With that, God Hong took his leave and left.

“Please come with me, Master Wushuang.” Qing Bin said with a smile.

“Very well.” Jian Wushuang replied curiously as he nodded.

“God Hong had mentioned of a site which will help greatly the students of the mastery of swordsmanship. What manner of place could that be?”
