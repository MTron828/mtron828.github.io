Chapter 2798: So That Was The End?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There were three strongest seals in the nine-region seal, namely the divine emperor seal, the true emperor seal, and the supreme seal.

All three seals needed to combine the three handprints of the nine-region seal.

Jian wushuang had known about the existence of these three seals when he first obtained the mountain and river map. After studying them carefully, he had combined the first three moves of the nine-region seal and mastered the divine emperor seal.

Over the years, as his strength continued to increase, his study of the nine-region seal naturally deepened.

Not long ago, he had already combined the three moves of the nine-region seal and mastered the true emperor seal.

Now, he had fully displayed the true emperor seal.

In terms of power, the true emperor seal was much stronger than the divine emperor seal he had just displayed!

Rumble ~ ~

The huge hand seal descended once again.

That earth-shattering power suppressed everything below.

Palace Master Nan Wu stood at the bottom of the hand seal, but his expression was extremely ugly.

“There’s still more?”

Palace master Nan Wu’s heart trembled.

Although he had used all his strength to block that hand seal, it had still injured him quite a bit.

However, the power of this hand seal was clearly much stronger than the previous one. Even he felt an immense pressure under this hand seal.

“Humph! !”

With a cold snort, the Black Lightning seal between Palace Master Nan Wu’s brows once again flashed explosively. Vast and mighty black lightning strength once again spread out wildly.

As the surging black lightning strength surged out, the Black Lightning seal between palace master Nan Wu’s brows gradually dimmed. Finally, it completely disappeared. His eyes were bloodshot and his face was filled with madness.

“Come on!”

With a roar, the huge kylin beast rose up again from the surface of palace master Nan Wu’s body. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In terms of size, this kylin beast was even larger and more powerful than the previous one.

Judging from Palace Master Nan Wu’s flushed face, he had used all his means and trump cards in this move.

This was also his strongest move.

“Die!”

Jian wushuang’s killing intent was like a rainbow. The huge palm in the void came crushing down again, and in the blink of an eye, it collided with the Kirin Beast again.

Boom!

This time, the terrifying boom had completely turned into a sonic boom, which resounded in the ears of all the experts on both sides.

The many great divine masters who were fighting on the battlefield were affected by the impact and could not help but stop what they were doing.

Numerous gazes filled with shock and astonishment looked towards the center of the battlefield.

“Isn’t this a little too strong?”The Dongfang clan head couldn’t help but mutter.

She was a genuine peak great divine venerate, but at this moment, the power that instantly erupted from the center of the battlefield caused his heart to tremble, causing her to tremble from the bottom of her heart, she even felt that if she was in the center of this power, she would probably be crushed into pieces by the violent power.

In other words, the power in the center of the battlefield could easily kill ordinary peak great divine masters.

“Such a terrifying collision... who will win and who will lose between these two?”

Many great divine masters muttered in their hearts.

Before the start of the battle, they would have thought that palace master Nan Wu would win.

After all, Palace Master Nan Wu was so famous that her strength had been recognized for many years.

Jian Wushuang’s rise was too short. Even if he had the battle strength of a peak great divine master, no one would really think that he could challenge palace master Nan Wu.

But now that Jian Wushuang was fighting with Palace Master Nan Wu, no one dared to think that way anymore.

The skills that Jian wushuang displayed in this battle shocked everyone.

In particular, the killing moves that he was using now were too terrifying!

Boom! Boom! The sound of the explosions gradually faded, and the divine power that filled the sky gradually dissipated.

Finally, the scene at the center of the battlefield appeared before everyone’s eyes.

In the center of the battlefield, in the air, Palace Head Nan Wu was still standing there. However, at this moment, the clothes on his body were in tatters, and there were even some cracks on the armor on his body. His armor and clothes were covered in blood.

His face was deathly pale, and blood flowed out from both sides of his mouth. His hair was also extremely messy.

Especially his aura, which was obviously much weaker than when he was at his peak.

“Seriously injured! Palace Master Nan Wu is seriously injured!”

Many great divine masters from both sides were shocked to see this scene.

Before the battle, they had never expected that palace master Nan Wu, who had always been known as invincible in the Pill Sun Sacred World, would be seriously injured by Jian Wushuang in a head-on fight!

“Haha! ! ! !”

A deranged laughter suddenly sounded.

It was the heavily injured palace master Nan Wu who was laughing.

Although he was seriously injured, his eyes were shining brightly and his face was full of madness.

“How many years has it been? How long has it been since I became invincible in the Pillsun Sacred World?”

“Sword One! Sword one!”

“You’re the first person to force me to such an extent ever since I became invincible in the Sacred Pill Sun World. I, Nan Wu, have to admire you! The technique you used just now was indeed extremely powerful!”

“Unfortunately, it ends here!”

Palace Master Nan Wu’s voice reverberated through the vast world.

The great divine masters from both sides also sighed inwardly.

They had to admit that palace master Nan Wu was the strongest person in the Pillsun sacred world since the death of Sage Redstone. He had been invincible in the Pillsun sacred world for many years and had experienced many battles along the way, however, very few people were able to injure him. There were even fewer who were able to seriously injure him and force him to such an extent.

Jian Wushuang was the first! !

In the eyes of the surrounding experts, Jian wushuang deserved to be proud even if he died.

“Is this the end?”

Jian wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly. There was a trace of unwillingness in his heart, but his gaze became a little misty.

In the sword tomb below, divine swords were emitting unique and extremely powerful sword essence, which filled every corner of the sword principle world.

Jian wushuang’s expression was cold, but his consciousness and soul power had already completely covered the entire sword principle world.

At this moment, his body and mind had become one with the entire sword principle world, and even with every divine sword and sword essence in the sword principle world.

Jian wushuang immediately entered an extremely wonderful state.

“Sword one, surrender your life!”

Palace Master Nan Wu’s killing intent soared, and the Black Thunderbolts on his body also soared. However, he once again crazily attacked Jian wushuang.
