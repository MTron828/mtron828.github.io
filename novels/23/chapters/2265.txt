Chapter 2266 The Extreme Blade Doctrine

Jian Wushuang stood and looked at the overwhelming blade lights sweeping towards him. It was as though he was drowning in an ocean of blade lights.It was as thought he had to force himself to keep still, or else the blade lights would tear him apart.

“This blade principle is really overpowering,” Jian Wushuang commented. He was not afraid to meet this challenge.

No matter how incredible Bing Shan’s blade skills were, they would not be too powerful in this Heaven and Earth.

Here, only the inverse cultivators were unbeatable as they were the only ones not affected by the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

Jian Wushuang drew his sword.

The moment he raised his sword, an incredible sword essence swept forth. Hum, hum~~~

As he slashed the space with his right hand, an eerie curve was seen as sword lights appeared. The sword lights were like spiderwebs as they infested the space around Jian Wushuang.

Instantly, a giant web made out of sword lights was formed.

The sword web seemed endless and it was as though it could cocoon and destroy everything.

The ocean of blade lights collided into the ocean of blade lights head on.

Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!

There were no deafening explosions or collisions. All that could be heard were divine powers neutralising each other.

Even though the ocean of blade lights looked extremely bright and shiny, it could not tear the web of sword lights apart.

Within moments, all of the blade lights disappeared.

Whoosh!

The figure that appeared out of the ocean of blade lights belonged to Jian Wushuang.

“No matter how powerful your blade skills are or how deep your understanding of the blade doctrine is, your power is limited to peak chaotic realm. Even though my sword skills are far weaker yours, the power I have is that of the Divine Demon Realm. I can overpower you. I want to see how you are going to go against me.”

Jian Wushuang said coldly. When his figure appeared, a terrifying wave of divine power crashed forth.

The divine power was like a vast ocean.

Under his guidance, sword essence ran rampant within the space.

Winds were blowing at such great speeds that they could tear any great emperor apart easily. This wind then blew towards Bing Shan, trying to suppress him.

Jian Wushuang swung his sword.

The sword went for its target immediately.

A storm had surrounded Bing Shan completely.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo... Blast Rainstorm!!

Bing Shan stood tall at the centre of the storm. The battle-axe he was holding radiated gloom. He had an indifferent expression.

An unprecedentedly violent and ruthless aura radiated from Bing Shan.

It was as though Bing Shan was a demon from hell, not a human cultivator.

It was as though he lost his sense of reasoning.

“Chop! Chop! Chop!”

“My battle blade does not back off from anyone!”

“My battle balde is unstoppable!”

“My battle blade will destroy all that stands in my way!”

Even though Bing Shan was in the middle of a storm, he ignored all defence as he continued his attack with his battle blade.

Waves of blade lights were emitted from his hands.

Every single blade light looked as though it was headed for infinity and beyond. It seemed powerful enough to slice through everything.

He went purely on the offence. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Crash~~~

The seemingly endless storm was torn apart mercilessly by the blade light as the storm dissipated.

The blade light that was headed for infinity and beyond continued for Jian Wushuang fiercely.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned pale.

“This man’s blade skills...”

Jian Wushuang had known that Bing Shan’s blade skills were far more powerful than his sword skills from his initial attack.

Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine was nothing compared to Bing Shan’s understanding of the Blade Doctrine.

However, he was not afraid as Bing Shan was under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, which limited him to the power of his blade skills.

However, Jian Wushuang had underestimated Bing Shan.

Back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, Bing Shan had been one step away from being a Master of Holy Land. His understanding of the Blade Doctrine was already at the peak.

He had already formed his own unique blade doctrine.

His blade doctrine was to destroy everything that stood in his way, no matter how powerful it was. He would never back down.

His sword doctrine was a purely offensive one. His blade would only attack, never defend.

In other words, his defence was to destroy everything in front of him with brute force.

“The best defence is offence. This guy... His blade doctrine is extremely offensive, which has made his attacks unbelievably powerful,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

This was still the case even when Bing Shan could not use the full power of his blade doctrine as he was under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

How powerful was he when he’d used such extreme blade skills back in his prime? Jian Wushuang could not picture it.

“Die! Die! Die!”

Bing Shan yelled madly.

It was as though Bing Shan had been taken over by a demon. His blade skills were headed for infinity and beyond.

Waves of terrifying blade skills, which were simple yet overpowering, headed for Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was stressed.

Even though his sword skills were no match for Bing Shan’s blade skills, Jian Wushuang thought he could stop the blades with the Mixed Elements Spirit style from Sword Principle Xuan Luo as his divine power was far stronger than that of Bing Shan.

He soon realised that Bing Shan’s blade skills were not only overpowering, but also endless.

The blade lights hit continuously without giving him a chance to take a break.

When Jian Wushuang chose to use Mixed Elements Spirit to fend off the attacks, he knew he would be on the passive end as there was no way he could counterattack.

Bing Shan would not give him a chance to do so.

“This man’s blade skill is too terrifying.” Jian Wushuang was completely shocked.

The experts from the ancient past took a sharp breath when they saw this scene.

“Too powerful. Lord Bing Shan’s blade skills are far too powerful!”

“What kind of person is Lord Bing Shan? Even under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, there is no way we can compare ourselves to him.”

“His blade skills are really extreme. It goes purely for power and aims for infinity. Even though it is extreme, it is incredibly powerful. Unless you are in a higher realm than Lord Bing Shan, once you are suppressed, you will be suppressed until you are defeated!”

“It seemed straightfoward and dumb. However, once you reach Lord Bing Shan’s level, you need not fear anyone anymore.”

The experts from the ancient past were all well educated. They knew clearly how overbearing Bing Shan’s blade skills were.

This type of blade skill or Blade Doctrine was so rare that it could be classified in a category of its own.

However, these types of alternative blade skills were still fatal and powerful in a battle.

Just like in the battle against Jian Wushuang. Even though Jian Wushuang had incredible power and a decent understanding of the Sword Doctrine, once he decided to withstand Bing Shan’s blade skills, he had to do it all the way till the end.
