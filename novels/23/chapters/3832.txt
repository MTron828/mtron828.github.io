Jian Wushuang carefully looked at the rule supreme treasures, and at the same time, he could get some basic information from them.

“Yin poison ring, a low-grade domain type rule supreme treasure. When activated, the ring can form the yin poison domain and suppress the opponent.”

“The Yin poison domain has five different levels of power.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The first level of power is filled with the yin poison power. Once a cultivator is trapped in the domain, he or she will die if he or she is not a superior master of the first level. Even a superior master of the first level can suppress 90% of his or her strength, a master of the second level can suppress 40% of his or her strength, and a master of the third level will have his or her speed affected.”

“The second level of power, a master below the second level will die if he or she is trapped in the domain, and a master of the third level…”

“The third level of power…”

Jian Wushuang could not help but take a deep breath when he read the message from the sinister ring.

“It’s so terrifying!”

It was indeed terrifying.

Once the realm was formed, the sinister power filled every part of the realm. Any cultivator within the scope of the realm would be eroded by the sinister power. The first level of power alone was enough to wipe out all the cultivators below the peak master level.

In other words, if he obtained the Yin poison ring and displayed the first level of power of the Yin Poison Ring realm, he would be able to easily kill more than half of the 100,000 monsters that had surrounded and killed him in the Dark Magic Region, if he combined it with the Mystic Light Realm and the Nine Dragon Heaven Killing Formation and used it with greater power, even an elementary master of the second level would not be able to survive in the Yin poison realm.

And that was only the first level of power.

“It’s indeed a rule supreme treasure, although it’s only a low-grade one.” Jian Wushuang sighed and then looked at the other rule supreme treasures.

“Mad Demon Armor, a middle-grade rule supreme treasure armor, is divided into four levels of power.”

“The first level of power can stimulate the power of a thousand times that of a basic Ruler!”

“The second level of power can stimulate the power of a 10,000 times that of a basic Ruler.”

“The third level of power…”

Jian Wushuang was dazzled by the information sent by the law true treasures. At the same time, he was secretly shocked.

The principles true treasures were indeed far from being comparable to ordinary universe true treasures.

Even the most powerful universe true treasures, even the top-grade ones, needed dozens of them to exchange for a principles true treasure of the lowest level.

The reason for this was that the power of these supreme treasures was far inferior.

Each of the dozens of principles supreme treasures in front of him had earth-shaking power.

However, when Jian Wushuang looked at the principles supreme treasures one by one, he frowned.

“Although these principles supreme treasures are extremely powerful and valuable, the key is that I’m too weak, and I’ve only just comprehended a trace of universe principle. With my current strength, I’m afraid that most of the principles supreme treasures can only unleash the first level of power. Some of them have a lower threshold and can barely unleash the second level of power, but the first and second levels of power are not of much help to me,” Jian Wushuang thought.

It was a very simple reason.

The supreme true treasures in his hands now, after he had grasped a trace of the universe principles, were mostly able to unleash the power of these true treasures. For example, he could already unleash the third level of power of the Dark Gold Devil Dragon Armor, with 60 percent of the power of Devil Dragon in his hands, it could be considered quite a huge increase in his power.

If he were to use the mad demon armor, which was a medium-grade law-type true treasure, he would only be able to exert the first level of power, which was 1,000 times the power of a basic Ruler.

Although it was 1,000 times the power of a basic Ruler, it was only 1,000 times the power of a second-level Advanced Ruler. Although it was a great improvement for him, however, this improvement did not really surprise Jian Wushuang.

Most of the other rule supreme treasures were the same.

Only the Wu Qi Divine Sword, as an offensive magic weapon, could greatly increase Jian Wushuang’s offensive power, which was of great use to him.

“I only have one last chance. The treasures I have to choose will be of great use to me. They can either help me increase my strength or help me fight against Devil Cloud Star in the Divine Beginning Realm. As for the other rule supreme treasures, they may be of greater use to me when I go to the universe battlefield in the future, but they are of limited use to me at this stage.” Jian Wushuang frowned, he continued to look at the other rule supreme treasures.

One rule supreme treasure after another floated in front of Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Jian Wushuang was not very satisfied.

But at this moment, a mini tower that emitted black, white, and purple colors suddenly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked at the three-colored tower and immediately got the information of this tower.

“Three-layered Dao Realm, a low-grade law supreme treasure.”

It was a simple information.

There was only the name and level of the supreme treasure, but nothing else. It did not even say what type of principles Supreme Treasure it was.

This made Jian Wushuang feel strange.

“Lord Wu, what is this three-colored tower?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Tricolor tower?” Lord Wu glanced at the tricolor tower and then smiled. “It’s a Three-layered Dao Realm. It’s a special rule Supreme Treasure.”

“Special? How special?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“A Three-layered Dao Realm is a domain-type rule supreme treasure. After all, it contains three realms and is quite powerful. It’s much stronger than the Triple Magic Light mirror you took with you when you left. However, it’s far inferior to other domain-type rule supreme treasures,” Lord Wu said with a smile.

“It’s much weaker than other domain-type law treasures?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Although it’s not as powerful as other domain-type law treasures, the real function of the Three-layered Dao Realm is not the domain, but the three-layered world contained in the Three-layered Dao Realm. The three-layered world is a cultivation world,” Lord Wu said.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang was interested.

“The three-layered cultivation world, as its name implies, is used to help cultivators cultivate,” Lord Wu began to explain.

“The first-layered cultivation world, which is the black world emitted by the tower, contains all kinds of natural principles, including some unique cultivation environments. It is mainly targeted at cultivators at the Saint Realm. Some cultivators at the top of the Saint Realm can enter the First-layered Dao Realm and use those special cultivation environments to gradually comprehend a natural principles, so as to meet the requirements of breaking through the Principles Master.”
