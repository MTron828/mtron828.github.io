Chapter 983: The Secret of Inverse Cultivators

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Do not follow in Empress Qing’s footsteps?”

After Jian Wushuang heard these words, his expression turned quite strange and he immediately asked, “Grandmaster, Uncle Xiao, how on earth did senior Empress Qing die?”

Jian Wushuang always wanted to ask this question, which at the same time, was also a mystery of the Green Fire World.

Why did Empress Qing die?

Empress Qing’s strength was on par with that of the Tang Emperor and she was invincible in the Green Fire World. No one was able to kill her excluding the experts from outside the Green Fire World.

However, the fact was that she died.

Among the four emperors in the Tang of the East, Empress Qing died first.

Just because of that, the Tang of the East would then collapse at its heyday and a series of changes would take place.

“Senior Sister was not killed by someone else. There are other reasons for her death,” Emperor Xiao said solemnly.

“Was it due to her Cultivation Method?” Jian Wushuang asked with a furrowed brow.

“Sort of.” Emperor Xiao nodded.

The Tang Emperor then chimed in. “I acquired that Cultivation Method by chance. In the beginning, I figured out that it was unique and fabulous, and I wanted to cultivate it myself. But soon after, I discovered that its power could only be displayed step by step.

“Therefore, this Cultivation Method can only be cultivated by younger people who have just come in contact with Spiritual Power and don’t belong to the Eternal World.

“After all, the Eternal World has a very favorable cultivation environment with abundant Spiritual Power. As long as a man is willing to cultivate with concentrated attention, he can reach the Skyscraping Realm easily, and even reach the Divine Realm within a few decades. In this way, it is impossible for this Cultivation Method to achieve the effect of the first few steps in forging a flawless foundation.”

Jian Wushuang agreed secretly.

The Heavenly Creation Skill consisted of six steps, namely; reaching the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path, expanding the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, building the Supreme Gold Core Realm, Yin-Yang Breaking, becoming a Venerable Master, and flying to the Ninth Heaven.

There were six steps in total.

Every step was essential and was the key to forging a flawless foundation.

If one who had great talent cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill in the Eternal World, it would only take him a few years to get to the next level. And thus, there was no way for the Cultivation Method to achieve the effect of those six steps and to forge a flawless foundation.

“So, I went to so many Ancient Worlds to pick geniuses who were suitable for cultivating this Cultivation Method. I selected some younger ones and made them my personal disciples.

“After they became my disciples, I imparted onto them that Cultivation Method. But unfortunately, if one wants to cultivate that Cultivation Method, not just talent alone, but many other factors are required. Thus, only Little Qing was qualified to cultivate it. As for the other three, they could not make any progress after reaching the Level of Spiritual Sea or the Gold Core Level. Helplessly, I let them cultivate other Cultivation Methods so that they could become powerful over time,” the Tang Emperor said slowly.

An idea crossed Jian Wushuang’s mind as he heard these words.

He had not felt any other restraints and encountered any obstacles while cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill. His cultivation process was quite smooth. Therefore, he did not know that there were many other conditions required for cultivating this Cultivation Method.

“Jian Wushuang, I have also heard about the Cultivation Method cultivated especially by Inverse Cultivators.”?Gu King’s voice resounded in Jian Wushuang’s heart. ”?If one wants to be an Inverse Cultivator, a heaven-defying cultivation method is a must. Moreover, the requirements for the person who cultivates the Cultivation Method are very demanding. As far as I know, in the Eternal World, rarely are people qualified to become Inverse Cultivators. And you, obviously, are one of the few people in the Green Fire World who is entitled to do so.”

“Really?”?Jian Wushuang was shocked speechless.

Only a few people were entitled to become Inverse Cultivators in the Green Fire World?

The odds were so slim.

“Before my Senior Sister died, she divided the technique of that Cultivation Method into two parts. They are the two gray stone beads that you know.” Emperor Xiao said, “She entrusted one gray stone bead to me; and the other, with the little consciousness she had left, entered the Ancient World through the Portal to find the one who was qualified to become an Inverse Cultivator. After looking for tens of thousands of years, she finally found you!

“I believe you must be very curious about why the gray stone bead would appear in your body instead of that of others. That is because you are one of the few people in that world who is qualified to be an Inverse Cultivator. Moreover, you happened to have not touched any Spiritual Power yet.”

“I see, I finally see.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He now knew the origin of the gray stone bead that had changed his life and why Empress Qing had chosen him to be her successor.

It was because he met the conditions for becoming an Inverse Cultivator!

“Kid,” the Tang Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “the Cultivation Method you have been cultivating is extraordinary. Even in the entire Eternal Chaotic World, Inverse Cultivators are very unique beings. Furthermore, Inverse Cultivators do everything in defiance of the natural order and will not be tolerated by the world. So, your road ahead will not be smooth. As for what will happen, you will gradually understand after you break through to become a Dao Master.”

“I see, thanks for your advice, grandmaster.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly and began to pay attention to this matter.

Even Empress Qing died on the road of Inverse Cultivation, and he did not consider himself stronger than Empress Qing.

Hence, he needed to be more cautious!

“By the way, I just heard from my disciple that you have an extraordinary teacher,” said the Tang Emperor suddenly.

Jian Wushuang froze.

Just now, Emperor Xiao talked to the Tang Emperor about what had happened over the past few years. Of course, he also mentioned the Selection Ceremony and the earth-shattering wedding gifts that Jian Wushuang had taken out from the ceremony.

13,800 Emperor Weapons. With so many treasures, the Tang Emperor surely could figure out how unusual Jian Wushuang’s teacher was.

“Yeah, I have a teacher,” Jian Wushuang replied with a nod.

“I’m quite curious about your teacher, who is not only able to teach you and the Master Blood Saber, but also can offer so many fabulous wedding gifts. Since you are going to marry my martial granddaughter, could you ask him to be your wedding officiant?” the Tang Emperor asked with a smile.

“Wedding?” Jian Wushuang was dazed by this and subconsciously shifted his gaze to Leng Rushuang, who was sitting beside him.

Leng Rushuang also looked at him, and a faint blush could be seen on her cold and arrogant face.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
