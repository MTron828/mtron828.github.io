Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At the Drill Ground, many geniuses stared at Gong Chao as he exited the battlefield. They all had serious looks on their faces.

“Gong Chao? Great! He’s qualified to be my opponent, but I’m definitely stronger than him!”?Qianqiu Wuhen clutched his hands as battle intent raged in his eyes.

“Gong Chao?” A slovenly girl in green from among the crowd glanced at Gong Chao, a sliver of light flashed in her eyes.

”?He’s quite strong.?” Feng stared at Gong Chao and pondered?, “I’ll have to go all out if I battle him.”

“He only needed three strikes to defeat Jin Yue. His strength is quite good.” As Jian Wushuang peered at Gong Chao, his eyes sparkled with eagerness.

The Arena Battle continued. Several geniuses competed against each other. One fierce fight after another...

“Chu Yang!”

“Jian Wushuang!”

The middle-aged man shouted these two names.

Immediately, the geniuses cast their eyes towards Jian Wushuang and Chu Yang.

“It’s my turn?”Jian Wushuang slowly raised his head.

“Jian Wushuang! Fight!” Bing Shan and Xuan Ying said.

These two had just failed to defeat their opponents in the Arena Battle.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, then stepped towards the battleground.

Chu Yang also walked towards the battleground while many geniuses from the Eternal World looked at him enviously.

“Chu Yang is so lucky. He gets to fight with Jian Wushuang from the Ancient World.”

“Among the geniuses in Round Three, Jian Wushuang is definitely at the lower end. Whoever fights with Jian Wushuang is guaranteed to win.”

“Chu Yang is so lucky.”

“There is no suspense in this fight.”

Those geniuses from the Eternal World all sighed with emotion.

In the Skyward Pavilion, those sect experts were obviously not very interested in this fight.

Since Jian Wushuang had a terrible performance in Round Two, no one believed he could hold a candle against Chu Yang. Therefore, they all thought there would be no suspense in this fight.

Only Xuan Yi from the Ancient Sect had a glimmer of hope while waiting for the fight.

“That boy has hidden his strength for so long. Is it time for him to show his strength?”

“Let me see a good show.”

On the battleground, Jian Wushuang and Chu Yang stood facing each other, hundreds of feet apart.

“Boy, remember what I told you?” Chu Yang sneered and a bronze sledgehammer appeared in his hand as he continued saying, “I told you that I would not give you the chance to surrender.”

“Well, I’ll be waiting,” Jian Wushuang said while slightly smiling.

“This boy is pretty calm?”

“He must be pretending. I bet he will be defeated by Chu Yang in ten breaths or less!”

“Ten breaths? Isn’t that too short? After all, Jian Wushuang fought with the Puppet Fighter for 15 minutes when he passed Round Two.”

The geniuses from the Eternal World on the battleground were talking and laughing.

At that time, Chu Yang grasped the bronze sledgehammer started to attack.

Boom!

With a harsh wind-breaking sound, Chu Yang turned into a phantom and instantly appeared near Jian Wushuang. As he swung the sledgehammer, a majestic Earth Dao emerged. The sledgehammer immediately rocketed forward at a staggering speed.

In the blink of an eye, the sledgehammer seemed transformed into a towering bronze mountain with immense power as it crashed down towards Jian Wushuang.

Seeing the bronze mountain, everyone on the battleground shouted out in surprise.

“He’s lifting that much weight so easily? How did Chu Yang achieve such a high level in comprehension of the Earth Dao?”

“His understanding of the Earth Dao was not this high a month ago. It seems like he made great progress during the month he spent at Enlightenment Mountain.”

“Jian Wushuang is unfortunate!”

Many geniuses sighed.

Chu Yang, who was holding the bronze sledgehammer, had a treacherous smile on his face.

“Now do you see? Do you understand how much progress I made this month?” Chu Yang said with pride.

He really made a lot of progress last month, so he could not wait to show off his progress in hopes of attracting the attention of Sect experts as soon as he had entered the Arena Battle. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As for Jian Wushuang, Chu Yang only thought of him as a gauge he could use to show his strength.

But, at this exact moment, Jian Wushuang slashed out with his sword.

Buzzing!

The moment he swung the sword, the surrounding area became dark.

Only his sword shone brightly in the darkness.

“Superior Rank One Secret Skill, Cataclysm Skill!”

This skill seemed similar to a month ago, but it shined more brightly now.

Its power increased several times over!

The two attacks collided.

Bang!

After a thud, the stronger person was victorious.

“Puff!”

While coughing up a full mouth of blood, Chu Yang’s expression froze and his pride instantly vanished.

He stared at Jian Wushuang with a hint of shock. He was forced backwards several hundred meters by the tremendous impact.

Outside the battleground, all the bantering Eternal World geniuses were standing there motionless.

They all had stunned expressions on their faces.

They were completely astonished.

They had thought that there would be no suspense in this fight.

Yet, Chu Yang had been forced to cough up blood after only one exchange?

He had been completely overpowered.

They had assumed that Chu Yang would overpower Jian Wushuang, but the result was the exact opposite.

“How could it be possible?”

These words echoed in everyone’s mind.

In the Skyward Pavilion, those Sects experts all looked at Jian Wushuang at the same time.

They had seen the collision very clearly.

“Does he thoroughly understand the first level of the Slaughter Dao?”

“It seems so. If not, his power would not be that strong.”

“But, how could this be? A month ago, his understanding of the Slaughter Dao was just average. He still had a long way to go before he reached the first level. How could he grasp it in just a month? Not only that, he has made progress towards the second level.”

“He improved so much in only a month?”

Those Sect experts were shocked.

During the one month at Enlightenment Mountain, those geniuses had all made some progress, but Jian Wushuang improved at such a fast speed?”

From almost comprehending the first occult to complete comprehension of it and even beginning to comprehend the second occult, it would take a normal genius at least a year or more.

But Jian Wushuang only spent a month?
