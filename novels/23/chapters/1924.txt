1925 Take A Stroke Of My Sword

“Saint Master.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Palace Master Wu Luo and other experts from Abysmal Palace came next to Abysmal Saint Master.

Abysmal Saint Master’s face was pale. The aura from his body wasn’t even comparable to an ordinary Sir God’s.

He looked at the arrogant man in the white robe with hatred but didn’t dare to rage.

He knew clearly that that man had the power to kill him easily.

He was in great disbelief.

Over the years, he had been on the third place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Even Red Dragon King, who was on the second place, didn’t care about Red Dragon King much, even though he was on a higher ranking than he was.

He thought that only Emperor Bai could really be above him in the world.

He had always thought so.

But then, when he saw the arrogant man in the white robe that day, the pride in him had instantly vanished.

It was obvious that he belittled the world.

“Let’s go!”

Abysmal Saint Master commanded with great difficulty. Then, he and everyone from Abysmal Palace left in a fix.

The experts on the scene sighed emotionally at the sight.

One should know that Abysmal Saint Master was behaving barbarically just a while ago. His terrifying power made everyone feel hopeless.

In the blink of an eye, he had been severely injured and he couldn’t even utter a single word before he left.

The one who had led to the current situation was the arrogant man in the white robe who was the centre of attention.

Everyone was questioning from the bottom of their hearts with great curiosity, “Who the hell is this person?”

Everyone was curious about the identity of the arrogant man in the white robe.

“Senior!”

Jian Wushuang instantly spoke with the intention to ask.

However, the arrogant man in the white robe didn’t turn to look at Jian Wushuang but his gaze was fixed in another direction.

Everyone looked in the direction where the arrogant man was looking. It was a vast void. However, at the end of the vast void, there was a faint black dot.

Before everyone’s gaze, the black dot continuously magnified. In the end, it appeared in front of everyone.

The black dot was a human figure.

He was in a grey robe and had white hair and white eyes. His skin was also terrifyingly fair.

He was actually a man, but he had an enchanting appearance that put all women in Eternal Chaotic World to shame. Such an enchanting appearance with such fair skin, he looked rather different.

The enchanting man with white hair and white eyes appeared in the void and the experts then held their breaths in silence again.

Purple Moon Emperor’s eyes dilated in shock again.

“Bai, Emperor Bai!!!”

The moment someone called his name, it instantly stirred a hubbub!

“Emperor Bai! He is Emperor Bai?”

“The supreme existence in Eternal Chaotic World, Emperor Bai, who is widely acknowledged as the strongest, has come here personally?”

“My goodness, what is going on today?”

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Great Emperor, the experts on the top of the pyramid in Eternal Chaotic World.

Every one of them were truly high and above, overlords of the sanctuaries.

Such an existence was hard to be seen normally but then…

Abysmal Saint Master and Purple Moon Emperor had made an appearance one after another.

Then, there was a mysterious, arrogant man in a white robe that dispersed boundless darkness with one glance and injured Abysmal Saint Master with one stroke.

By then, even Emperor Bai had come to the scene personally!!!

He was the legendary Emperor Bai!!

The true strongest one in Eternal Chaotic World.

Legend!!!

“That is Emperor Bai?” Jian Wushuang looked at the newcomer with surprise as well.

He had never expected the high and mighty Emperor Bai to rush to this side of the void at such a crucial moment.

Plus, the moment Emperor Bai appeared, his white eyes, that seemed to be able to see through everything in the universe, were fixed upon the arrogant man in the white robe.

As the strongest one, Emperor Bei was clear about just how powerful the man in the white robe was.

“You are the strongest one in the world now?” The arrogant man in the white robe remained towering in the void as he looked at Emperor Bai coldly.

“I dare not accept the honor. I wonder what your name is?” Emperor Bai flashed a gentle smile and behaved politely.

“If you can withstand my sword stroke, you’ll get to know my name,” the arrogant man in the white robe replied.

“Withstand your stroke? I’d like to try,” Emperor Bai smiled faintly.

A simple conversation and everyone’s eyes dilated in shock.

The arrogant man in the white robe, who had injured Abysmal Saint Master with one stroke, was going to fight with Emperor Bai now?

“Retreat!”

“Hurry up and fall back!”

The experts at the scene quickly retreated far away without hesitation.

Even experts like Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Tian Ling, Jian Yi quickly fall back at times like that.

Even Purple Moon Emperor retreated without hesitation.

They knew clearly that, no matter if it was Emperor Bai or the mysterious arrogant man in the white robe, they both had an extremely unrivaled power.

Regarding the battle between the two, no Great Emperor dare to get involved. It was no different from courting death.

In the vast void, the two human figures looked at one another a million miles apart.

In the expanse of the surrounding one billion miles, there was no one else.

The experts from Lineage of Star and the remaining experts from the other two alliances had retreated far away. They were staring at the middle of the void with boundless excitement and anticipation with their eyes wide open.

Even Purple Moon Emperor was extremely looking forward to the battle.

Finally, the arrogant man in the white robe, who was at the core of the void, lifted his hand while leaving the other behind his back.

Then, he extended one finger and glided it at the void before him.

The movement was like he was scribbling. It was casual but smooth.

There was no sword intention or divine power that spread out.

However, at the very moment he moved his fingers....

Hong!!!

Heaven and earth shook. From the middle of the void, the sky and earth started splitting apart.

A huge crack appeared from nowhere. As everyone looked on in terror, the crack magnified at a terrifying speed.

Hundred miles! Thousand miles! Ten Thousand miles!

Million miles!

In the end, it covered an expanse of a hundred million miles.

The one hundred million miles crack appeared and crossed the entire universe. The surrounding space, air, including spacetime, all elements in the universe became obsolete.

In the entire universe, there was no other substance.

There was a sword light that slowly lit.

Very dim, an unnoticeable sword light.

If it was on a normal day. the sword light would never attract anyone’s attention. But then, the sword light was the only existing substance in the vast universe.

It became the one and only. It became eternal.

“This stroke…”

Jian Wushuang, who was far away from the battlefield, saw the sword light that became the one and only, and his eyes lost focus.
