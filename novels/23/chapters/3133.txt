Chapter 3134: Breakthrough

——

“I have made great progress in sword principle and swordsmanship, and my comprehension of the principles has improved a lot. If I go all out now, it will not be difficult for me to fight against a rank six True Saint. I can even suppress an ordinary rank six True Saint, but this strength alone is not enough.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

There were several experts from the Purple Cloud Pavilion waiting for him outside, all of whom were at least rank six True Saints. Elder Xin Wu was a genuine rank seven True Saint. With his current strength, he could not deal with them alone.

“Although I’m not strong enough, I’ve improved my strength to the extreme in the past 90 years. If I want to improve my strength again, I have to make a breakthrough in my realm.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

A breakthrough in realm…

He had made a breakthrough from a rank one True Saint to a rank three True Saint in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. In the past 90 years, he had consumed a lot of divine power fruits and accumulated his divine power very quickly, now, he had reached the limit of a rank three True Saint and was only one step away from a rank four True Saint.

However, it was not a step that could be crossed easily.

“I have reached the limit of my divine power. Under normal circumstances, I need to travel outside and find a way to break through it. But now, I don’t have such conditions. I have no choice but to place my hopes on the elixir.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was solemn, he flipped his hand and a scarlet-gold elixir appeared in his hand.

This elixir was the emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir that Jian Wushuang had spent two billion holy elixirs to exchange for!

The emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir, as its name implied, was used to help True Saint experts break through their realm by force. Its value was extremely high, and it was very rare.

Jian Wushuang was able to exchange for this elixir in the Treasure Pavilion because he was a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“According to Sir Tiansuo, the emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir can play a certain role even for cultivators above rank five or rank six. Under normal circumstances, those who have reached the limit of rank five or rank six have a 10% chance of breaking through their bottleneck after consuming the emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir!”

“I just want to break through from a rank three True Saint to a rank four True Saint. In addition, my comprehension of the principles and the Dao have long surpassed that of a rank three True Saint. My foundation is absolutely perfect…”

“In my current state, if I take this emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir, the chances of successfully breaking through the bottleneck and reaching rank four True Saint are at least 30% or even 40%!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

The 30% or even 40% chance was already very high.

Because of this, Jian Wushuang had previously exchanged two billion holy elixirs for this emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir.

“I’ll take my chances.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. He glanced at the emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir in his hand and swallowed it without hesitation.

As soon as the emperor-grade saint-breaking elixir entered his body, it instantly turned into hot energy and began to surge in his body.

Jian Wushuang suddenly felt his whole body become hot and scalding. The heat continued to rise, and his face became redder and redder.

Time passed. After an unknown amount of time, the hot energy in Jian Wushuang’s body finally reached its peak. At this moment, he felt as if he was being burned by endless flames, and his entire body turned red.

“It’s starting!”

Jian Wushuang endured the pain of the scorching energy devouring his body and began to stop the majestic divine power from attacking the bottleneck.

At the same time, the scorching energy completely merged with Jian Wushuang’s divine power.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The crazy attacks repeatedly caused the veins on Jian Wushuang’s forehead to bulge.

At the same time, a large amount of divine power and scorching energy were being consumed rapidly.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had attacked the bottleneck seven times. However, the bottleneck was only slightly shaken.

“This is my last chance. If I don’t succeed, I’ll die!” Jian Wushuang’s expression was solemn, and a hint of madness appeared in his eyes.

The remaining divine power in his body had completely merged with the scorching energy. In the next moment, he rushed toward the bottleneck like a torrent of steel.

Bang!

A low sound came from Jian Wushuang’s body. His body trembled, and he also felt a sharp pain in his body. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, under the pain, Jian Wushuang did not show any pain. On the contrary, he was ecstatic.

Because he had already sensed that the calm center had been broken by his last attack!

“I’ve made a breakthrough!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, and the surrounding power of heaven and earth immediately surged toward him like crazy.

Buzz, buzz, buzz!

Jian Wushuang’s divine power and divine body also began to transform.

From a rank three True Saint to a rank four True Saint, it seemed to be only a small breakthrough. However, it must be known that the gap between each realm was very wide.

Jian Wushuang’s overall strength had improved greatly after breaking through from a rank three True Saint to a rank four True Saint.

In just half a day, Jian Wushuang had completely completed his transformation.

Everything had calmed down in the secret chamber. Jian Wushuang was still sitting cross-legged with his eyes open. At this moment, he was carefully feeling the divine power in his body, which was more than ten times stronger than before.

When he had just entered the third rank True Saint Realm, the power of his divine power was comparable to that of an ordinary fifth rank True Saint.

After reaching the peak of the third rank, the power of his divine power should be comparable to that of a peak fifth rank True Saint.

Now that he had reached the fourth rank True Saint Realm…it was no surprise that his divine power alone was comparable to that of a sixth rank True Saint.

If combined with his several secret skills, his divine power might not be comparable to that of a sixth rank True Saint.

Moreover, he had just made a breakthrough.

Jian Wushuang suddenly waved his hand, and numerous high-level divine power fruits appeared in front of him.

Divine power fruits were used to store divine power. Jian Wushuang had exchanged some of them. In the past 90 years, he had accumulated his divine power to the peak of rank three True Saint. He had used up a lot of divine power fruits, but there were still some left.

Now, Jian Wushuang took out these divine power fruits and swallowed them all without hesitation.

Each of these divine power fruits provided Jian Wushuang with a lot of divine power, which made his divine power more and more abundant. In a few days, Jian Wushuang had devoured and refined all the divine power fruits, however, these divine power fruits only allowed Jian Wushuang to reach the level of an advanced rank four True Saint. There was still a gap between him and the peak of rank four.
