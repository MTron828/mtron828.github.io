Chapter 2436: You’ve Pissed Me Off

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Too... Too fast!”

“Junior Brother Wushuang’s apprehension of Space-time Law has probably already been infinitely close to the first stage. None of these genius disciples could keep up with him.”

Zhong Yi and the others were shocked.

They were worried that Jian Wushuang would not be able to face so many genius disciples single-handedly, but Jian Wushuang’s speed had thrown them off by surprise.

With such terrifying speeds and such high-level apprehension of the Space-time Law, no wonder Jian Wushuang was not afraid of these disciples’ siege.

“Keep on attacking!”

“Kill him!”

Although the hundred genius disciples saw Jian Wushuang’s terrifying speed, they were not about to give up. Their attacks came firing like swarms of bees.

Previously, Jian Wushuang could easily cope with their siege. It was an extravagant hope for those people to attack him when he had already broken through their siege.

“Not giving up yet? Alright, I’ll play along.”

Jian Wushuang smirked, his figure evolved once again.

Whiff! Whiff! Whiff! Whiff! Whiff! Whiff!

Six Space-time Shadows appeared at the same time and their speeds were fast.

“Where is he?”

“Find him quick.”

The genius disciples roared and relied on their soul powers to again locate Jian Wushuang’s real body. At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s body appeared in another void some distance away from them. He was already halfway sitting down in that void with his brows jumping like he was having fun.

“Damn, he’s too fast. We can’t keep up with him.”

“No, I can’t catch up to him at all. He’s just playing with us.”

“What do we do now?”

Those genius disciples finally understood what was going on.

Among them was a First-Class Divine Demon from one of the big sects. He was a strong man with a solid back and tapered waistline.

That man was holding a giant axe while keeping an eye on Jian Wushuang with raging anger.

Despite his anger, that man kept his sense.

“He’s too fast. We can’t do anything to him at all. We can only kill him if he fights us head-on instead of avoiding us.” The strong man snorted. He turned his gaze slowly towards Zhuo Bing and the others who were not far away.

“The Ice Queen is his eldest sister. If we can capture her, we can force Jian Wushuang to face us.”

The strong man wore a cold and hard expression and had secretly made a decision in his heart.

“Everyone, let’s capture the Ice Queen first. As long as the Ice Queen is in our hands, we don’t have to worry about Jian Wushuang not handing over the position tokens.” The strong man yelled as he dashed towards the direction of Zhuo Bing and the rest.

The many genius disciples around were startled when they heard the strong man bellowed and all of them immediately reacted thereafter.

“Yes, the Ice Queen is close with this brat. As long as we capture her, we can do as we wish.”

“Haha, we can’t do anything to Jian Wushuang, but we can target the Ice Queen!”

“Hurry up, don’t let the Ice Queen escape.”

Around a hundred genius disciples turned around and zoomed towards Zhuo Bing’s direction.

They knew they were unable to harm Jian Wushuang who had a terrifying speed, but the Ice Queen was not as fast.

“Damn it!”

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, and the rest saw what was coming as their facial expressions drastically changed.

“Shameless!” Zhuo Bing cursed.

“Junior Sister, run quickly!” Ling Dan repeatedly cried.

Zhuo Bing turned around and left without hesitation.

She did not want to fall into the hands of those mad genius disciples to be used as a bargaining chip against Jian Wushuang.

However, while Zhuo Bing turned and fled, Jian Wushuang—who had been sitting in the void—took everything in with his cold gaze. His body instantly came sweeping down.

Hum!

In just a split second, he passed those genius disciples and first appeared behind Zhuo Bing. He stood protectively over Zhuo Bing.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, so you have finally decided to fight?” The strong man laughed out loud.

They intended for Jian Wushuang to fight them head-on instead of avoiding them with his shadows so that they could kill Jian Wushuang together.

They had achieved their goal.

“Little Brother.” Zhuo Bing’s expression sank.

She had never expected herself to become Jian Wushuang’s burden.

If she had known any better, she would’ve listened to Jian Wushuang and went off as far as she could, away from the battlefield. Jian Wushuang had to fight head-on with those genius disciples because of their siblings’ relationship.

Just when those genius disciples were delighted by Jian Wushuang’s will to fight, Jian Wushuang raised his eyes and locked them on those disciples with a horrifying flash.

“Congratulations to guys because you have pissed me off.” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice echoed throughout the area.

His face resembled Shura 1as he was ready to kill! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He had not intended for a massacre.

After all, there were a hundred genius disciples from various sects in the Wusha Wilderness in front of him. Most of these sects were not powerful but there were several big sects. If he had killed any of them, it could have resulted in him declaring war on those sects.

Although they were all fighting for the position tokens, being subject to the fate of life and death, they tried not to make any unnecessary moves.

Therefore, if it was not necessary, Jian Wushuang would not want to kill.

When he faced the siege of a hundred genius disciples, he had only relied on his speed to break through the circle and simply played a trick on them. He was hoping that they would just admit defeat and give up on fighting.

Jian Wushuang thought that he was being kind and merciful.

Who would’ve thought that those disciples took his kindness for granted and went directly for Zhuo Bing to threaten him!

Zhuo Bing was his Big Sister!

Although they had only met for the first time in Saint’s Tomb, Zhuo Bing took care of him and even tried to stand up for him. She offered him her own safety token, which moved Jian Wushuang very much. That was the true affection of a family member.

Jian Wushuang would not tolerate those unscrupulous genius disciples who wanted to harm his family members. That was the last straw.

It had angered Jian Wushuang and awakened his desire to kill!

It was ridiculous that those genius disciples were blinded by their desire for the position token that they could not feel Jian Wushuang’s wrath.

They would not be bothered even, even if they felt it.

“Let’s fire together!”

The strong man shouted and once again, the hundred genius disciples attacked.
