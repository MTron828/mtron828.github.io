Chapter 1016: Fight with Di Yan Again

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Buzz!

Emotionlessly, the cold and ruthless sword lights directly appeared in front of Di Yan and flustered the latter.

It was only one swordsmanship, but in Di Yan’s eyes, it was such a strange swordsmanship that seemed to contain several different Essence.

“Humph.”

Di Yan snorted and suddenly clapped his wrinkled hands.

The power came overwhelmingly like a piece of dark cloud.

Woosh!

The strong sword lights swept and completely tore apart the dark cloud. The remaining sword lights still came at Di Yan.

“What?” Di Yan was startled. He immediately waved his sleeves to disperse these sword lights.

Buzz!

A sword shadow had quietly appeared beside Di Yan. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“So fast!”

Di Yan couldn’t help narrowing his eyes. A powerful consciousness attack directly came to him at the moment he saw the sword shadow.

It was the Perfect Combination of swordsmanship and consciousness attack. It was a move named Death Shadow.

The sudden consciousness attack directly swept over Di Yan without any sign. Although Di Yan was a Peak Rank Three Dao Master, at this moment he still felt a sharp pain in his consciousness and couldn’t help trembling. Nevertheless, he managed to take the consciousness attack.

In face of the consciousness attack, he instantly slapped on Jian Wushuang’s longsword lightening fast and fended off Jian Wushuang’s sword shadow. At the same time, he also retreated.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted. The power of Blood Mountain Sword in his hand increased greatly. And at the next moment, his swordsmanship was in full swing.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The sword shadows chopped, swept or stabbed. Each of them was lightning fast.

They were so fast!

Apparently, Jian Wushuang had used his Aurora Sword Principle to the utmost. Every sword shadow came out lightning fast one after another.

“The swordsmanship…” Di Yan said in great astonishment.

It should be noted that he had a fight with Jian Wushuang more than twenty years ago. Although Jian Wushuang showed great strength at that time, Jian Wushuang was much weaker than him. In terms of swordsmanship, he did not remember Jian Wushuang displayed any remarkable swordsmanship.

But now…

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was much better than before. Although his swordsmanship was almost ordinary and not very powerful, he was so fast and vigorous!

Jian Wushuang’s Power Amplifications of Three-star Ancient God Power and Star River Secret Skill were 90 times, and the power of Blood-killing Armor had increased by 10 times in Stage One. Thus, his power had soared. At that time, Jian Wushuang could display the battle strength close to Peak Rank Three level without help from any Sword Principle.

Now he had created two sword principles. With the help of the two sword principles, He had reached the Peak of Rank Three, which made him even a bit more powerful than Di Yan.

With the fast speed, great strength, and incredible swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang completely overwhelmed Di Yan at the moment. Di Yan totally failed to fight back.

“How is it possible!”

“How is it possible!”

Di Yan roared wildly in his heart, “It has been less than 30 years since then. How is it possible that he has promoted his strength so much?”

“It’s impossible!”

Di Yan was drastically astonished.

Di Yan did not know that Jian Wushuang had just spent two thousand years on cultivation since he was born. What was more, he had spent over one thousand and two hundred years rebuilding his body. As an Inverse Cultivator, he possessed the flawless foundation and the strongest Sword Heart beyond Di Yan’s imagination. Besides, he had the help from plenty of treasures and opportunities…

Thirty years was long enough for Jian Wushuang to promote his strength greatly.

Di Yan was overwhelmed. Meanwhile, the battle intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew more and more intense, and his swordsmanship was increasingly faster.

“Retreat, retreat right away!”

Di Yan calmed down. He watched Jian Wushuang in panic, and then retreated immediately when he spotted an opportunity.

He fell to the bat category of the Sky-devouring Clan and was talented at speed. Not even Jian Wushuang could capture him if he managed to run.

Thus, the fierce battle between them stopped.

Up in the Void, Jian Wushuang still stood there with tremendous battle intent. He stared at Di Yan coldly and said, “What a pity. I can barely suppress him in our fight. However, it’s not very practical for me to kill him.”

Jian Wushuang was also reluctant. After all, Di Yan was a real Peak Rank Three Dao Master gifted at speed. It was indeed pretty difficult to kill him.

Jian Wushuang felt reluctant; people watching their fight were dumbstruck.

“Jian Wushuang, he, he defeated a Peak Rank Three Dao Master?” God Hong and numerous experts of the Rock Demon Clan looked extremely shocked.

God Hong was especially awestruck.

He used to fight with Di Yan. Even with his extremely strong body, he got seriously injured by Di Yan in less than two rounds and withdrew in panic. Di Yan’s great strength made him a top dog in the entire Samsara Continent.

But now Di Yan was defeated by Jian Wushuang?

Defeated by a young man who was an Eternal Realm expert from the Ancient World and was favored by him two thousand years ago?

“How did that happen?” The insidious man, leader of the Black Python Clan, watched all this in surprise and asked. In the meantime, Di Yan appeared beside him, looking rather miserable.

“Did you see that?” Di Yan said with a trace of anger on his face, while his eyes were also filled with rage, “I’ve gone all out, but…”

“Mo Lin, let’s retreat. With the brat helping the Rock Demon Clan, your Black Python Clan is unable to exterminate them.” Di Yan said in a deep voice.

Mo Lin was the name of the insidious man, leader of the Black Python Clan.

The insidious man Mo Lin’s face was sullen. He looked over at Jian Wushuang and fixed his eyes on him with endless hatred and reluctance.

Reluctant, he was very reluctant indeed!

This time their Black Python Clan prepared everything well and even called in Di Yan for help at a high cost. They ambushed four Dao Masters of the Rock Demon Clan, seriously injured God Hong, and even had intruded the residence of the Rock Demon Clan.

Everything went as planned.

However, no one had expected that at the brink of exterminating the Rock Demon Clan, there came such an incredible Eternal Realm expert from the Rock Demon Clan.

The Eternal Realm expert killed eight Dao Masters under his command and even defeated Di Yan.

With this Eternal Realm expert helping the Rock Demon Clan, Mo Lin clearly knew that it was impossible for their Black Python Clan to exterminate the Rock Demon Clan today. If they continued their desperate attempts, their Black Python Clan might be the one that was exterminated.

“Let’s retreat!”

Mo Lin said, while his heart was bleeding.
