Chapter 1661: Friendly

“What great power.”

Jian Wushuang was looking at the Flame Prison with admiration and he could feel the great amount of power that it contained.

At that moment, Real God Peng Huo and the slightly stronger Three-Horned Green Star Demon were both within the Flame Prison.

As for Jian Wushuang, he only needed to keep the Star Demon in front of him busy.

Swish!

A green shadow attacked with lightning speed.

The void was ripped open and generated ear-piercing explosive sounds.

Jian Wushuang also swung the Blood Mountain Sword, which was emitting sword essence, at once.

Clang!

With a loud sound, the unreasonable power created an impact and Jian Wushuang could not help but retreat a few steps back.

“What great power.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in admiration.

Three-Horned Green Star Demons could compete against top Chaotic Real Gods and that was Jian Wushuang’s current level of ability. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“If I were to come across you alone, I really would want to have a good fight with you. However, it’s a pity that I have been invited by someone else to help this time round. Also, my duty is not to kill you. Instead, it is to keep you busy,” Jian Wushuang chuckled. His body then turned vague and many shadows appeared again. With that, his shadows started to move around the Three-Horned Green Star Demon.

Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion was strange and he had been using both his martial art motion and speed to keep the Three-Horned Green Star Demon busy.

He did not hope to kill the Three-Horned Green Star Demon in front of him. Instead, he wanted to keep it busy so that it could not do anything else.

The Three-Horned Green Star Demon became furious. Although it unleashed some peculiar moves with the intention to kill Jian Wushuang, all its moves were stopped by Jian Wushuang.

As it was neither able to kill Jian Wushuang nor shake him off, it could only be kept busy by Jian Wushuang.

This intense battle continued, with both sides refusing to budge.

As Jian Wushuang kept the Three-Horned Green Star Demon busy, he also took note of the time.

Previously, he had only promised to keep the Three-Horned Green Star Demon busy for fifteen minutes. If Real God Peng Huo had yet to defeat his opponent when the time was up, Jian Wushuang would leave.

“It’s about to be fifteen minutes soon,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

However, as he mentioned the timing, boom! A muffled sound could be heard from the Flame Prison.

At that moment, the whole universe shook slightly.

After that, the Flame Prison dissipated slowly and revealed the void inside it. Within the dark void, the slightly stronger Three-Horned Star Demon, which had had red skin on a part of its body, had disappeared and only Real God Peng Huo remained standing inside. At the same time, his hands were holding a Demon Core.

The Demon Core was a mix of both green and red colors. Of course, the green color took up more space of the Demon Core than the red color.

“It is just as Real God Peng Huo has said. He did not even take fifteen minutes,” Jian Wushuang gasped.

At that moment, Real God Peng Huo, who was within the void, had already changed into a lump of flames and headed for the battlefield that Jian Wushuang was in.

“Little friend, please retreat to one side,” Real God Peng Huo’s voice could be heard in the piece of universe.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. By moving his body, he retreated to a void nearby.

After that, he saw that Real God Peng Huo had started fighting.

With a wave of his big hands, a huge amount of flames appeared and dyed the heavens red.

At the center of the universe, a shocking giant flame beast appeared. The flame beast was more than ten thousand feet tall and it was formed from a tremendous amount of Divine Power. At the moment it was formed, it opened its huge mouth and swallowed the living Three-Horned Green Star Demon, as well as everything else in that piece of void.

Rumble~~ Sounds of power exploding could be heard faintly.

In a split second, the gigantic flame beast dissipated. As for the Three-Horned Green Star Demon, it had disappeared completely.

“It’s dead. It was killed in just an instant!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing with an unusual light.

Although the Three-Horned Green Star Demon which he had fought with was incomparable to the one that Real God Peng Huo had killed in the Flame Prison previously, it still possessed the genuine fighting capabilities of a top Chaotic Real God.

However, in the end, when it fought with Real God Peng Huo, it was killed straight away without even having a chance to struggle.

“There has been doubts about Real God Peng Huo possessing fighting capabilities that can be compared to the experts in the Real God ranking list. However, from what I can see, such doubts can be dispelled as he indeed possesses fighting capabilities that can get him into the Ranking God ranking list,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Real God Peng Huo, who was standing in the void, waved his hands and a Green Core floated over slowly from the flames.

“Green Core,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted slightly.

The Grade Three Demon Cores were split into three different colors. Among the Grade Three Demon Cores that Jian Wushuang had obtained, all of them were the normal Black Cores.

As for Green Cores, they were worth many times more than Black Cores.

A Grade Three Green Demon Core could be compared to about six or seven normal Grade Three Black Demon Cores. As such, Real God Peng Huo was very generous and he rewarded Jian Wushuang with two Grade Three Black Demon Cores.

“Haha~~”

Real God Peng Huo laughed heartily and walked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Little kid, thank you for helping me this time round. This is the remaining Grade Three Demon Core.” Real God Peng Huo gave Jian Wushuang a Demon Core.

After receiving the Demon Core, Jian Wushuang laughed, “Actually, I did not really help much.”

What he had said was true. The two Grade Three Green Star Demons were killed due to Real God Peng Huo’s absolute abilities. As for Jian Wushuang, his task was extremely easy.

“Little friend, you are too modest. If you were not there, I would have been unable to kill the two Star Demons.” Real God Peng Huo was still laughing, “In short, thank you very much for helping me in this matter. This is my transmission token. If you come across any trouble in the future, you can contact me. If I am able to help, I will definitely do my best to help you.”

Jian Wushuang took the transmission token subconsciously.

“I shall take my leave now.”

Real God Peng Huo laughed and left after that.

Only Jian Wushuang remained standing at his position and he had an extremely puzzled expression.

However, after a short while, he became relaxed.

“When Real God Peng Huo invited me to help him, it was indeed for the two Grade Three Green Star Demons initially. However, for such an easy job, it was more than enough for him to give me a Grade Three Black Demon Core. However, he gave me two of them and even gave me his transmission token. On top of that, he also said that I could find him if I were to come across any trouble in the future… he is being friendly toward me,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Jian Wushuang had lived for tens of thousands of years. Hence, he knew the ways of the world.

For example, Real God Peng Huo’s actions were obviously him being friendly to Jian Wushuang as he wanted to make friends with Jian Wushuang.

After all, anyone would be willing to make friends with a genius like Jian Wushuang who had great potential. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was also a person who valued friendships highly.

Back then in the Burning Demon Region, Jian Wushuang had clashed with the Four Symbol Mansion head-on for his good friend Duan Lingfeng. Since he was such a person, it was worth it to make friends with him.
