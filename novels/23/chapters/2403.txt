Chapter 2404: Battle Trooper

Na Shiyu was obviously slightly moved, but he was still a bit hesitant.

At that moment, Tang Xiao spoke again, “Na Shiyu, we’ve known each other for a while. I’ll give you my word. Help me and I’ll always remember this favor, also after we managed to force the Purple Amulets out of those Narcissus Island disciples’ hands, Black Thunder Pavilion won’t take any. The Cold Blood Palace disciples can have it all.”

Na Shiyu’s hesitation was lifted after hearing that.

“Alright then, I shall lend you a hand. Where are you now? I’ll come right away.”

“I’m... at this location.”

The disciples of Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace had started their secret alliance, going directly against Narcissus Island.

However, the ten disciples of Narcissus Island did not notice the slightest sign of it.

On the fifth opening day of Saint’s Tomb, everyone was still at the outer area, carefully searching for Purple Amulets.

However, there were only that many Purple Amulets which most of them had been discovered after a few days of searching, and not many were left. The chances of more being found were naturally much slimmer.

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Heng were skimming side by side, fully releasing their soul power.

“Our first three days were considered quite fruitful. We had discovered six Purple Amulets, but the efficiency had dropped significantly these two days as we only found two. That means we have a total of eight, four for each of us. The chances of discovering more Purple Amulets in the coming few days would be lower and lower. Looks like after ten days, we would each have a total of five or six Purple Amulets,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Five or six? That’s actually not bad.” Xiao Heng nodded slightly.

That was true, it was considered quite decent if each person could get five or six Purple Amulets after searching for ten days. Those who did not have such good luck might only find one or two.

Just then, Xiao Heng’s expression suddenly changed.

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang noticed immediately.

“It’s a message from Wei Qing, his team has run into a big trouble,” said Xiao Heng.

“Big trouble?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The core disciples of Narcissus Island had all formed teams of two, Wei Qing was in a duo of Second-Class Divine Demons. Jian Wushuang knew about him.

Among the ten Narcissus Island disciples sent to Saint’s Tomb, his ability was right after Zhong Yi and Su Tong. Although he was only a Second-Class Divine Demon, if he fought with a regular First-Class Divine Demon, he could certainly persist for a while. There were three safety tokens from Narcissus Island, and the last piece was given to him.

Partnering up with another Second-Class Divine Demon with his level meant they could resolve most crises they ran into. Now that they had run into a ‘big trouble’, it had got to be something severe.

“If I remember correctly, Senior Brother Wei Qing’s team is located not far away from us, right? With our speed, if we rush over at full velocity, we should be able to get there in under an hour. Come, let’s not waste time.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate either and immediately left with Xiao Heng.

They broke into their fastest speed possible and rushed towards Wei Qing’s location.

Within an hour’s time, Jian Wushuang and Xiao Heng arrived at the void where Wei Qing’s team was.

As soon as they arrived, they witnessed a terrifying sight.

A gigantic two-meter tall figure that looked as if it was constructed by purple marble was continuously swinging a huge mace in a frenzy.

The mace that it swung was heavy and forceful with impressive momentum. Most importantly, it was incredibly fast.

As one strike just went down, another strike arrived immediately.

Absolutely barbarous!

Right before this huge figure was Wei Qing and another core disciple from Narcissus Island.

They were already giving the best of their abilities, especially Wei Qing—his body had grown a lot bigger, blood and energy were rushing through his body as he swung his heavy sword to ward off the mace’s attacks. However, it was obvious that he was at an absolute disadvantage every time he warded off an attack. With every blow of the mace, he got pushed back further and further. The horrifying recoils had made him bleed and his injury looked serious.

“Damn, it’s a Battle Trooper and a Purple Battle Trooper on top of that. Its ability was the equivalent of a First-Class Divine Demon. No wonder even Wei Qing has trouble fighting it off.” Xiao Heng could immediately recognize the gigantic figure as he arrived. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“A Battle Trooper?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes froze.

He had heard of the existence of Battle Troopers from Elder Wujian’s detailed information.

There existed some dangers in Saint’s Tomb and the Battle Troopers were one of them!

One could say that Battle Troopers were the guardians of Saint’s Tomb, created by the Crimson Stone Saint to stop and destroy practitioners who forced their way into the tomb.

There were three types of Battle Troopers—Silver Battle Troopers, Purple Battle Troopers, and Crimson Battle Troopers!

Among them, Silver Battle Troopers were equivalent to Second-Class Divine Demons; Purple Battle Troopers, First-Class Demons; the most terrifying of all were Crimson Battle Troopers, they were comparable to Peak Stage Divine Demon.

However, the number of those Battle Troopers were not large and they were scattered in different corners of Saint’s Tomb. It was usually rare to encounter them, especially the scariest Crimson Battle Troopers.

There were probably a total of two or three Crimson Battle Troopers scattered in the tomb and rarely made contact with practitioners. Even if they did, the practitioners would escape right away, almost never giving the Crimson Battle Troopers a chance to start their mayhem.

With the numerous times Saint’s Tomb was opened, there were rarely genius disciples who died in the hands of Crimson Battle Troopers.

On the contrary, the Purple Battle Troopers were much more feared!

Purple Battle Troopers were not only comparable to First-Class Divine Demon, their incredible speed was their most crucial quality. After Wei Qing and the other core disciple had been fighting with the Purple Battle Trooper for such a long time, the desire to escape this situation did cross their minds. Unfortunately, it caught up with them.

That was the reason Wei Qing’s team had immediately called for help from the other core disciples.

“Fortunately it’s Wei Qing’s team who ran into the Purple Battle Troopers. If they were two regular Second-Class Divine Demons, they wouldn’t be able to survive this long!” exclaimed Xiao Heng.

“Senior Brother Xiao Heng, don’t just stand there. Go to help them!” Jian Wushuang pushed.

“I help them? How about you?” Xiao Heng stared at Jian Wushuang.

“I’m merely at the Chaotic Realm, I can’t even take one strike from the Purple Battle Trooper, so I’d better stay here like a good boy.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Xiao Heng rolled his eyes upon hearing it but did not say more. His figure blurred and charged directly at the Purple Battle Trooper.

“Wei Qing, I’m here to help!”

Xiao Heng attacked immediately, fighting the Purple Battle Trooper together with Wei Qing.

Wei Qing and the other core disciple had in fact noticed their arrival earlier on. However, they were not surprised at all when they saw Jian Wushuang standing there without making a move. In their opinion, Jian Wushuang was truly not suitable to participate in this battle based on his abilities.
