Chapter 3102: Three Palace Masters

_________

“The Principles Master?” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

Only the Principles Master was qualified to have a face-to-face conversation with the Supreme Emotion Valley.

However, Leng Rushuang was the second person whom the Supreme Emotion Valley had spent a long time and effort to find who could cultivate the supreme divine skill. She was too important to the valley.

The valley would not let Jian Wushuang take such an important person away, even if he was a Principles Master.

After all, a Principles Master could only talk to the valley face-to-face, but he could not make the valley fear him.

If he wanted to take Leng Rushuang away, he had to at least have the strength to make the valley fear him.

Jian Wushuang conservatively estimated that he had to at least reach the strength of the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

“I’m only a rank three True Saint now. I’m still far from that level!” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold, but he was not discouraged at all.

“Thank you for telling me, Elder Mo Shan,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“You’re welcome.” Mo Shan waved his hand and then looked at the Peak True Saint next to him. “Take this little guy away.”

“Yes.” The Peak True Saint immediately went forward to take Jian Wushuang away.

Mo Shan watched Jian Wushuang leave and sighed, “Send this little guy away, and I can report back.”

…

In an extremely magnificent palace, there were tall steps on top of the palace. At the top of the steps, three thrones stood side by side. There was a blurry figure on each of the thrones. It was the three Palace Masters.

Below the palace, Mo Shan stood respectfully and said, “Palace Master, the little guy has left the Heaven-cleaving Star.”

“Has he left?”

A low voice came from the throne in the center. “How long has he stayed in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm? What opportunities did he get?”

Mo Shan immediately told the truth about Jian Wushuang’s opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

It included the breakthrough in Jian Wushuang’s strength and the fact that he had comprehended a complete secret skill under the Black Divine Pillar.

After hearing Mo Shan’s words, the three Palace Masters’ expressions remained unchanged.

“Alright, you may leave,” the Palace Master in the center said.

“Yes.” Mo Shan nodded and disappeared from the palace with a slight shake of his body.

After Mo Shan left, the three Palace Masters began to chat casually.

“You actually obtained the inheritance of a complete secret technique under the Black Divine Pillar. Shui Yun, this little fellow is even more powerful than you, right?” The Palace Master sitting in the middle teased.

“I obtained the secret technique monarch water under the Black Divine Pillar back then, and I’ve benefited immensely from it ever since. Even now, this secret technique is still my strongest technique. Unfortunately, I’ve only comprehended 70% of this secret technique back then. If I could obtain the complete secret technique, my strength would be able to rise to another level. At that time, I wouldn’t be afraid even if I were to fight a Saint Realm Master directly,” the Palace Master on the left said, only Palace Master Shuiyun sighed.

“This secret technique of yours is indeed very terrifying. It might not be comparable to the divine technique of that old woman from the Supreme Emotion Valley, but it is not too far off either. The secret technique that this little fellow named Heavenly Sword Marquis obtained from the Black Divine Pillar’s golden characters should not be inferior to your secret technique, ‘Monarch Water’,” said the Palace Master on the right.

“That’s for sure.” Palace Master Shuiyun nodded slightly. “This little fellow obtained a complete secret technique from the Black Divine Pillar. Furthermore, the talent and strength he displayed now are much stronger than mine. In terms of talent and potential, he is much more outstanding than me. If he doesn’t die midway, he might be able to step into the peak and be on par with the three of us.”

“It’s still too early to talk about this. After all, the birth of a true expert requires many conditions. Talent and potential are just one of them. There are so many geniuses and monsters in our Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, but how many of them can actually reach the peak?

“Not to mention the peak, even those who can become Principles Masters are pitifully few.” The Palace Master in the center shook his head and said.

The other two Palace Masters also nodded. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

There were too many people on the road to the peak. However, how many people could stay on the road without falling down?

The three of them were very old. They had been the Palace Masters of the three palaces for many years and had seen countless geniuses. They had long become numb to some geniuses, even an incredible genius like Jian Wushuang only caught their attention a little, and they did not take it to heart.

“The path to the peak can not be taken just like that. However, this little fellow named Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed special. Not only is his talent incredible, but he actually won the favor of that person,” the Palace Master in the center suddenly said.

At the mention of ‘that person’, the other two Palace Masters’ expressions also became strange.

The three of them were not very interested in Jian Wushuang before. Even if Jian Wushuang’s talent was incredible, they would not care too much about it, nor would they directly give him a spot to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

The reason was because of ‘that guy’.

“I don’t know what kind of luck this little guy has to make ‘that guy’ care so much about him. He even asked us to give him a spot to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. We gave him a spot by force under the condition that many people were dissatisfied with him. Is it because of his talent that ‘that guy’ paid special attention to him?

“It can’t be that serious, right?” Palace Master Shuiyun said in a strange tone.

Even the three of them did not care much about geniuses, let alone ‘that person’?

“Who knows? In any case, since ‘that person’ has already given the order, then the three of us just have to do as he says.” The Palace Master at the center said helplessly.

“Alright, let’s not talk about this. Let’s talk about another matter. Not long ago, I received news that the number one genius of the Dao Palace, Xiong Tao, was assassinated, and the person who made the move was the Grandmaster of the Sorcerer God’s Sect, the Long Xing!” The Palace Master on the right suddenly said.

“Sorcerer God Sect? Hmph, looks like this Sorcerer God Sect has completely become the lackey of the three great holy regions. I wonder what that old Sorcerer God is thinking.” Palace Master Shuiyun’s voice was ice-cold, and there was a trace of killing intent in his eyes.

“I don’t know what that old Sorcerer God is thinking, but the three great holy regions, the three Great Saint Realm Masters…took advantage of the Temporal Temple Master and the Heavenly Ancestor to go to the cosmic battlefield. Now, they are acting more and more unscrupulously. Aren’t they just relying on the existence of the Heavenly Dao will behind them? What the heck?” The Palace Master in the middle cursed in a low voice.

“Will of the Heavenly Dao? Hmph, sooner or later, my Heaven-cleaving Alliance will go against the Heavenly Dao and kill this Heavenly Dao!”
