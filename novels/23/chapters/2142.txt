Chapter 2143 Meeting Ba Su Again

It was an arrogant young man with a hooked nose.

His aura could be sensed from afar. The aura was not only way more terrifying than other Great Emperors’, but it also had a strong Bloodline aura as well.

Jian Wushuang was familiar with this Bloodline aura. It was the Sky-devouring Clan Bloodline!

It was the Sky Swallowing Clan’s clan leader, Ba Su!

The Sky Swallowing Clan had intended to exterminate the Black Dragon Clan before their plans were discovered by Jian Wushuang. They themselves had been exterminated by Jian Wushuang’s alliance with the other three Top clans.

But they had only destroyed the Sky Swallowing Clan’s base, unable to locate and take down most of the experts who had escaped.

The Sky Swallowing Clan experts vanished soon after and were not to be seen within special tribe domains.

But now, Jian Wushuang faced Ba Su once again.

“Jian Wushuang!” !! An uncontainable rage could be felt from Ba Su’s voice. Ba Su’s eagle eyes were dead on Jian Wushuang.

There was still a certain gap between the two of them, but Ba Su’s murderous intent had already formed into a deadly storm, heading straight for Jian Wushuang.

There was so much resentment against Jian Wushuang.

The demise of the Sky Swallowing Clan and its experts was all Jian Wushuang’s doing.

“Jian Wushuang, you must die!” A powerful roar resonated across the heavens.

As he approached Jian Wushuang, Ba Su started to leave residual shadows across the Void.

The residual shadows looked identical to the real person, with no way of telling which one was fake.

Xiu!

With a strange beam of light, Ba Su had already appeared beside Jian Wushuang. Golden Claws landed on him like lightning.

“This speed…” Jian Wushuang could not help but be surprised.

Jian Wushuang was already at Third Stage Great Emperor fighting powers and showed no fear against sixteen Great Emperors fighting against him at the same time.

But the speed Ba Su demonstrated shocked even him, which said much about Ba Su’s improvement.

Although shocked, Jian Wushuang showed no delay in his reaction. As the golden streak of light could be seen, he broke it with one sword move.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Turn Monstrous At One Thought!

It was a fast sword move as well.

Dang!

As the sword light clashed directly with the golden flowing light, a metallic sound was heard. A terrifying power emerged as well.

Jian Wushuang was taken aback uncontrollably by the power.

Ba Su retreated as well.

As both of them retreated, the battle took a short respite. The remaining thirteen Great Emperors surrounding Jian Wushuang stopped their movements as well.

Xiu!

Jian Wushuang quickly stopped and looked towards Ba Su.

His gaze turned solemn.

“Third Stage?”Jian Wushuang was sure of how powerful he was.

But Ba Su’s claws went head-on with him and matched him in terms of power. Undoubtedly, Ba Su was already at Third Stage. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Haha, bet you didn’t see this coming, Jian Wushuang?”

Ba Su, now positioned at a Void far away, started grinning hideously. He looked towards Jian Wushuang with a sense of achievement. “You’re not the only one blessed with opportunities, I was able to as well!”

“Thanks to you, my clan’s lair was left destroyed and my experts homeless. Without a choice, we had to escape the special tribes’ domain. Exactly because of this, I found motivation for me to improve. I paid a high price to enter the Three Emperors World’s site of opportunity. Luckily for me, I managed to understand a bit of the Rules of Order!”

“Now, I am a true Third Stage Great Emperor!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.

He knew that with Ba Su’s abilities, it would not be possible for him to master Rules of Order in such a short period of time.

But if he had treasures and opportunities to assist him, it would be different.

After all, the most useful things for Cultivators were opportunities.

Ba Su obviously had hit the jackpot with that one.

In the surrounding Void, the thirteen Great Emperors were all gleaming in delight upon hearing Ba Su’s words, their leader Ling Zong included.

They did not know who Ba Su was or where he had come from, but now they knew.

Ba Su was obviously on their side, with third stage powers. That was enough to go against their three leaders.

“Sir, we’ll leave Jian Wushuang to you,” Ling Zong said.

“No problem,” Ba Su nodded.

Ling Zong glanced upon the other Great Emperors.

“Let’s go!” With that, the thirteen Great Emperors left.

They had no intention to continue their fight against Jian Wushuang, as they all knew that even if they were to strike Jian Wushuang, they could never kill him.

Furthermore, they had more important work to do.

They needed to think of a way to block the frenzied seven Great Emperors. If not, all the Cultivators within the Imperial City would be massacred.

Seeing the thirteen Great Emperors escaping, Jian Wushuang did not stop them.

Soon, in the large Void, only Jian Wushuang and Ba Su remained.

Both of their auras were extremely frightening.

“Jian Wushuang, do you know the price I paid to enter Three Emperors World’s land of opportunity?” Ba Su’s bloodshot eyes glared at Jian Wushuang.

“What?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“My freedom!”

“Not for ten thousand years, not a hundred thousand years, but forever. I have to listen to the Three Emperors World’s leaders for the rest of my life, showing no form of disobedience. I will only be free when I die!” Ba Su sounded mad.

Jian Wushuang flinched.

The price of listening to the Three Emperors World forever was a heavy price indeed.

“Haha!”

“For billions of years, I will be someone else’s pawn, but I’m willing to do so for this opportunity, do you know why?” Ba Su started laughing.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang looked towards Ba Su.

“My objective is to kill you!” Ba Su started grinning deviously.
