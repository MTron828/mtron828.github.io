2229 Seven Star Divine Realm

Though Jian Wushuang was overwhelmed by this new information, he did not display his surprise.

Actually he had guessed it some time ago – the land was not the endpoint.

The Ancient Era was not as simple as he had thought. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had confirmed that after the final battle between the Three Emperors World.

The Blood Emperor of the Three Emperors World at that time had no intention of dominating or ruling the land.

He had intended to destroy the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

The Blood Emperor wanted to destroy all life within the Eternal Chaotic World to start his Cruor Formation.

But what was his purpose?

If the Eternal Chaotic World was really the endpoint, then what was the point of killing all life to reach a higher level?

He would be alone then.

If the Blood Emperor’s motive was limited to the land, he would not have done that.

The only explanation would be that there existed another wider land beyond the current one.

Jian Er’s words confirmed it.

“Jian Er, you mean the land I am on now is one with your homeland? What does that mean?” Jian Wushuang inquired.

“Master, the land you are on, now the Eternal Chaotic World, was a part of my homeland Absolute Beginning Divine World, under the Seven Star Divine Realm ruled by the Seven Star Black Sect, the powerhouse of the Ancient Era!” Jian Er.

“Powerhouse?”

“Stronger than Divine Dream Heaven Sect I assume!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course, Divine Dream Heaven Sect was strong, but nothing compared to the Seven Star Black Sect. Even the Eight Big Holy Sects, Four Big Holy Tribes could not compare!”

“The Seven Star Black Sect was the best in the Ancient Era, no one could say no!”

“All the other factions had to step to one side,” Jian Er said.

Jian Wushuang could not help but shudder.

He knew the Seven Star Black Sect was strong, but not that strong!

Absolute Beginning Divine World should be the beginning of everything.

And the end.

But Seven Star Black Sect was the top force within the Absolute Beginning Divine World?

How strong were they?

“But even they were exterminated,” Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh.

“Yes, they were strong, no one could take them on individually. But then, all the sects, Three Big Holy Lands, Four Big Holy Tribes, Eight Big Holy Sects, and countless Divine Demons fought their way into the Seven Star Divine Realm – about half of Absolute Beginning Divine World’s experts,” Jian Er said, still in awe of what had happened.

He had fought in that battle, he knew how terrifying that battle had been.

But only with such a terrifying power could they enter the Seven Star Divine Realm.

“Jian Er do you know why they attacked the Seven Star Divine Realm?”

“Was it because they were too strong, pressuring the rest?” Jian Wushuang said.

“I do not know,” Jian Er shook his head. “Master, there were too many experts then, countless Divine Demons and many even higher than that. My four brothers and I were inconsequential in that battle, like dust.”

“Like dust?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Chaotic Divine Demons in the Ancient Era were nothing more than “dust”?

“It was too scary, we simply followed our sects orders to kill all Seven Star Black Sect experts. As for why the battle started, only my clan leader and top elder knew. The other elders were not even qualified to know, much less us.”

“But it should not be because the Seven Star Black Sect was too strong. They were strong, but they did not have many enemies. Without any specific reason, the other forces would never have agreed to work together,” Jian Er said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

The Seven Star Black Sect must have known how to handle relations to become the Absolute Beginning Divine World’s powerhouse.

There had to be another reason for them to force the other sects to exterminate the Seven Star Black Sect.

Jian Wushuang could not guess the reason for it either.

“Jian Er, continue. What happened after?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“After that, with the Three Big Holy Land leaders leading the charge, they broke into the Seven Star Divine Realm. The Seven Star Black Sect resisted and fought back. The entire Seven Star Divine Realm collapsed, turning into battlefield after battlefield. Countless experts died, fallen, missing. Even experts beyond Chaotic Divine Demon levels fell. But ultimately, the Seven Star Black Sect was defeated!”

“They lost badly!”

“All Seven Star Black Sect disciples were killed, only a few higher-ups were left struggling.”

“But as the other experts were about to wipe out every Seven Star Black Sect experts, one elite expert managed to activate a formation that opened the heavens.”

“With that formation activated, Seven Star Divine Realm’s countless Divine Demons and experts’ Divine Power and blood essence were sucked away in a moment. Many experts felt it and managed to escape in time, but some did not. That formation became a huge blockade between the Seven Star Divine Realm and Absolute Beginning Divine World!”

“As for the rest, I guess you already know, master.”
