Chapter 2398: Four Opportunities

Although Elder Wujian did not say much, a sense of gratitude rose in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Elder Wujian was indeed very good to him.

“Elder Wujian, although I’ve heard of the Saint’s Tomb, I don’t know much about it. I don’t know what are the opportunities that lie within the tomb. Can you tell me about it?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“The Saint’s Tomb was specially left behind by the Crimson Stone Saint before his death. There are countless treasures and opportunities and they are roughly divided into four kinds.” Elder Wujian began to narrate.

“Firstly, there are many Nature Treasures collected by the Crimson Stone Saint in his lifetime. There are various elixir pills, cultivation manuals, and secret skills that are scattered in every corner of the tomb. Although many of these treasures are extremely precious and rare, the Saint’s Tomb has been opened many times since it was discovered. Many of those treasures have been collected and there are only very few left in the tomb. It all depends on your luck to get whatever you could.”

“Like the kinds of crafting materials that you wanted me to look out for you, there might be one or two of them in the Saint’s Tomb, but they are well hidden and might be difficult to find.”

Jian Wushuang raised his brows.

He understood that those treasures were scattered in random corners of the tomb, and since the tomb had been opened so many times, those easily found treasures would have been taken away. The remaining treasures that had not been found were hard to find.

“The second opportunity was the Divine Power Ocean!” Elder Wujian continued.

“There is an incomparably huge ocean in the Saint’s Tomb and the Divine Power Ocean contains incomparably pure ancient god’s divine powers. A cultivator could get into the ocean and take up the divine powers within to level up his divine powers. As for his power improvement speed, it depends on the cultivator’s divine power absorption speed. In short, being able to cultivate in the Divine Power Ocean is better than slowly accumulating divine powers by yourself or to swallow some elixir pills. The effect is faster by many folds.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang looked interested.

‘Ancient God’s divine powers?’

He recalled that in his past life, he went to the Ancient God Divine Pond to accumulate divine powers. The Ancient God Divine Pond was transformed from a drop of an ancient god’s divine power with the help of the formation skill. The pond was a great help to him.

The Ancient God Divine Pond that was merely transformed from a drop of an ancient god’s divine power was already extremely helpful. It was not hard to imagine what the Divine Power Ocean that was transformed from an ancient god’s divine power in the Saint’s Tomb could bring for him.

“I need to level up my divine power to restore my strength to its peak, the Divine Power Ocean...” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes as his strong desire was written all over his face.

Elder Wujian continued. “In the Saint’s Tomb, there is a condition if you want to enter the Divine Power Ocean. The condition is the Purple Amulet. The Purple Amulet is something unique in the tomb and most of them are scattered among the outer area of the Saint’s Tomb. There are quite a number of them in the outer area of the tomb, about hundreds of them at each time. One Purple Amulet could earn you a month in the Divine Power Ocean.”

Therefore, any cultivator who entered the tomb would stay in the tomb’s outer area for a period to accumulate as many Purple Amulets as possible. How many a person could collect depends on his luck. Usually, one could get about a dozen Purple Amulets which allows the person to stay in the Divine Power Ocean for a year. Even if one has extremely bad luck, it was still possible to get one or two Purple Amulets. The divine power accumulated from the ocean in the two months’ time would be far better than cultivating it for years through blood and sweat.”

Jian Wushuang got all the information he needed.

He was at the Peak Stage Chaotic Realm and was only one step away from the Divine Demon Realm.

He lacked the accumulation of divine power. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Even with the aid of many elixir pills, it was estimated to take a year or two, maybe even longer had he cultivated on his own using his usual way. If he could get to the Divine Power Ocean, he could save a lot of time.

“The third opportunity in the Saint’s Tomb is the inner area’s Nine Major Tests,” continued Elder Wujian.

“The Nine Major Tests were specially designed by the Crimson Stone Saint. Each test is challenging, and not many could pass it through. However, if one could pass it, one would get the many opportunities that come along with those tough tests. The opportunities are some precious things such as weapons, secret skills, insights, and even inheritance!”

“Inheritance?” Jian Wushuang was surprised to hear that.

“You heard me right, inheritance. It’s the Crimson Stone Saint’s inheritance. He left his inheritance in one of the tests. As long as one passes the test, one would be able to gain several powerful secret skills that he cultivated during his lifetime, including the combat skills which he invented, some important treasures, and more. This is the biggest opportunity one could gain in the tomb.”

“It’s a pity that the Saint’s Tomb has been opened so many times. I don’t know how many geniuses have tried to overcome those tests, but they all failed miserably. The inheritance was still intact, but the other tests... Initially, there were sixteen tests in the tomb. However, as the tomb has been opened, again and again, some people have managed to pass seven of the tests and collected the opportunities within. There are only nine tests left,” said Elder Wujian.

Jian Wushuang secretly let out a sigh.

After all, the Crimson Stone Saint was a super expert at the level of an Undying Saint.

How could an ordinary person get his inheritance?

The conditions of those tests must be extremely harsh. In recent years, there were not many geniuses produced in the Wusha Wilderness. That was probably why none had successfully attained the inheritance.

“Elder Wujian, you said that there are four opportunities in the Saint’s Tomb, but you have only told me three of them. What is the last one?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“The last opportunity...” Elder Wujian paused before saying, “It’s Fengtian Scroll!”

Jian Wushuang frowned. “Fengtian Scroll? What’s that?”

Elder Wujian said, “I don’t exactly know what it is, but it must be very valuable as the scroll is hidden in the deepest part of the inner area. It will only appear at the last moment. It contains everything about cosmic mysteries and could bring a lot of benefits to cultivators. Every time the Saint’s Tomb is opened, there will be six seats up for grabs to have a look at the Fengtian Scroll. The six seats will appear one after another in the inner area. The genius disciples of all the sects in the Wusha Wilderness will frantically fight for the six seats.”

“Fight? Do all genius disciples of the sects desire a seat?” asked Jian Wushuang solemnly.

“Yes, the Fengtian Scroll is extremely useful for cultivators, but I’m not sure how. After all, I’ve never personally gone to have a look. The only certainty was whoever gets a seat to look at the scroll will greatly improve in their perception of the laws, understanding of the rules, and so on,” explained Elder Wujian seriously.
