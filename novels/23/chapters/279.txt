Chapter 280: Bloody Blade Team

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After Wu Jiu left, the tall man said brightly, “Swordsman, I’m Tai Shan. From now on, we are allies, fighting by one another’s side.”

“I’m Gu Chui!”

“I’m Mo Ying.”

“I’m Tao!”

The other members of Bloody Blade Team began to introduce themselves.

“Let’s go.” Tai Shan spoke. Then they returned to the courtyard, and sat around the stone table. The ninth squad was comprised of 10 people and all of them were here.

“Swordsman, you’ve just joined Heartless Sect. You probably know little about our sect or our Bloody Blade Team, right?” Tai Shan asked.

“Right.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and replied.

“Let me tell you something about the internal situation of the Tang Dynasty. It’s full of slaughter. For their own sake, a great number of powerful factions continue to fight one another for their own interests. It is certainly far crazier than the outside world.”

Fighting for benefits existed everywhere, but it certainly was crazier in the Tang Dynasty than most other places.

There were many varied forces in the Tang Dynasty. Weaker groups would hand over a certain amount of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid to the stronger factions. It was called “monthly supply”, and as one might expect, the stronger forces received more “monthly supply”.

Moreover, there was an abundance of natural resources in the Tang Dynasty, such as lode and numerous Natural Treasures... These, of course, were possessed by the large forces and factions.

In order to gain benefits, every organization had little alternative to fighting for control.

Tai Shan added, “Our Heartless Sect is one of the four factions in Skywave Prefecture. It’s also one of the most powerful forces in the Tang Dynasty. Our Master is a mighty expert who has reached the Half-saint Level and ranks one hundred and eighteenth on the Bloodmoon List.

“Furthermore, there are the eight Protectors who are also top experts on the Bloodmoon List. We also have experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.”

“Do we have many experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, of course.” Tai Shan nodded heavily. “Many experts are glad to join our sect, one of the four factions in Skywave Prefecture, so we have many experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. Although I’m not quite clear about the number of them, I think we have at least 200 experts at such level.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang suppressed his shock.

There were more than 200 experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm?

Even the old sects, the Wilderness Sword Sect and the Daluo Heaven Sect, would never have so many experts at the level.

However, a large force in the Tang Dynasty could own 200 experts. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

What could that mean?

However, after some careful consideration, Jian Wushuang felt at ease.

The Tang Dynasty was known as the Slaughterous Dynasty and was also one of the best places to practice for many people, so it was not strange for a large number of top experts to come to the Tang Dynasty.

It could even be said that in the entire Nanyang Continent, at least 30 percent of experts at the Half-saint level or at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm gathered in the Tang Dynasty, so the Tang Dynasty had many experts at such levels.

Though the experts could roam around the Tang Dynasty, they did not belong to the Tang Dynasty, so the amount of force the Tang Dynasty could control was only a fragment of a much greater whole.

But even with just a small part of the force, it was still far more than enough to make places like the Alchemy School and the Holy Emperor Palace experience a great sense of awe.

“200 experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. I just made a conservative estimate.” Tai Shan smiled. “Our Bloody Blade Team is the most elite force for the Heartless Sect and comprised of 100 people. The minimum requirement of joining our team is battle strength at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.”

A hint of shock flashed past Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Everyone in the Bloody Blade Team had reached Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

The team consisted of 100 experts. If this were in the Nanyang Continent, three valleys and four temples might not be able to build such a team. However, a single sect within the Tang Dynasty could easily make such a force.

“The Bloody Blade Team has 10 squads. Each squad has 10 experts. Now you’re in the ninth squad and I’m the leader. They’re your teammates,” Tai Shan said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and asked, “Protector Wu Jiu just said he set some rules. What rules?”

“Rules?” Tai Shan sneered. “Well, Wu Jiu controls our Bloody Blade Team, so all of us must follow his orders. The rules he set up are quite simple, that is, don’t question what he said and don’t hesitate to obey his orders. Otherwise, your life would, and will, become miserable.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked toward him.

“I’ve been in the Bloody Blade Team for more than one year. I’ve seen a leader was killed by Wu Jiu because he hesitated for a while after receiving an order,” Tai Shan added.

“I heard that Wu Jiu has ordered Bloody Blade Team to kill enemies. A powerful Protector was opposed to Wu Jiu, but ended up slain. After that, many people speculated it was Wu Jiu who led two squads and killed the Protector in secret. But they haven’t gotten any evidence, so this case has remained unsettled.”

Jian Wushuang was somewhat shocked. “Wu Jiu really is quite overbearing.”

“Mmm, those are the rules he set. Truth is, he has such power because he’s strong. If you’re stronger than him, you can do whatever you want, and even disobeying his orders is entirely possible,” Tai Shan said.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

That was the truth. There were no rules for powerful experts in other places, let alone for somewhere such as the Tang Dynasty.

“Well, Swordsman, you’re so young, but you are still able to join our team. You must be strong, right?” Tai Shan suddenly asked.

The other eight teammates looked toward him with great interest.

Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh. He had already understood what they meant.

After a while, Jian Wushuang started sparing with his teammates.
