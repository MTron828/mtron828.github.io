4766 Di Qing

There were 99 Grand Yan Immortals who had transcended the Yan Immortal stage under Zhen Wuyang’s throne.

This was what Jian Wushuang had learned after attending the feast in the Heavenly Court.

He knew very little about the Grand Yan Immortal stage. He only knew that it was almost impossible for ordinary Yan Immortals to achieve it.

Even Cheng Qing did not know how long he had been stuck at that step.

When Jian Wushuang was transporting the black mountain crystal during the early stage, he met Wild Fox Koan, the Whirling Patriarch. That guy was probably the closest to the Grand Yan Immortal. When he was about to advance, Jian Wushuang destroyed his Immortal Source with the power of an Emperor.

Right now, this Nine-Tailed True Crow that had the power to cut across the great momentum had the power of the Grand Yan Immortal!

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile bitterly.

The level of Grand Yan Immortal was not something he could contend with at all. Just the aura that it exuded was a great threat.

However, Jian Wushuang did not want to retreat. He did not want everything he had done to be in vain.

They would only retreat when the situation turned bad.

When he saw the Golden Crow’s outstretched body, Prince Mo seemed to have grabbed onto his last life-saving straw and charged straight at it.

However, the next moment, a change occurred!

Two boundless sky-tearing auras smashed toward Prince Mo like two graceful birds, clearly aiming to kill him!

However, the expected situation did not happen.

The two great forces did not even land on Prince Mo’s body. The moment they swept over, they were shattered by the Golden Crow’s wings.

The aftermath spread in all directions. Although Prince Mo had escaped death, he could not even withstand the aftermath. He opened his mouth and spat out a large mouthful of divine blood.

At the same time, two figures quietly appeared.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank slightly. The two figures were the two Grand Yan Immortals who had fought in the heavenly hall just now!

He slowly retreated, already prepared to escape at any time.

In a battle at the level of a Grand Yan Immortal, the control of Yan power was not on the same level as that of a Yan Immortal.

The difference between the two was even greater than the difference between a mortal and a Yan Immortal.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang was not thinking about how to deal with the Grand Yan Immortal, but thinking about an escape route.

The Golden Crow glanced at the two Grand Yan Immortals with its scarlet-golden ring of light, then turned to look at the still frightened Prince Mo.

“Di Qing, hurry up and kill them all. Don’t leave a single one alive!” Prince Mo gasped for breath. The big hole on his face that had been pierced by the True Sword had already recovered, and his face was strangely pale.

The Golden Crow’s eyes flashed with a human-like look of disgust. “I’ve said it before, if you dare to call me by my name again, I’ll burn you to ashes.”

Prince Mo shivered, as if he did not doubt the authenticity of its words at all. “I-I understand. Master Di, do me another favor. Wipe out all these people who want to kill me.”

The Golden Crow, whose name was Di Qing, glanced at the two Grand Yan Immortals again, then looked at him with a faint smile and said, “To attract such a powerful being to intercept you, Prince Mo, your abilities have improved a lot.”

Hearing this, Prince Mo’s expression changed slightly. “In any case, you have to solve this problem as soon as possible. I want none of them to live!”

A ferocious smile flashed across Di Qing’s eyes, and he suddenly flapped his wings.

“Whether they can live or not depends on my mood, not your decision.”

The giant wings that covered the sky spread out for thousands of miles, and a screeching sound resounded in the sky.

Jian Wushuang felt that his eardrums were about to be torn apart.

He no longer hesitated and was ready to escape. The Yan power force displayed by the Golden Crow had already exceeded his imagination, not to mention that there were two Grand Yan Immortals.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to leave, a long sword with a chilling intent was pressed against his back.

“If you don’t want to die, don’t leave.” A cold voice sounded.

Jian Wushuang turned around and saw that it was the young guard who had competed with him in the heavenly hall.

At the same time, four more figures pulled Cheng Qing and Chun Qiu over.

“Brother Jian, I’m ashamed.” Chen Qing, whose face was bruised, let out a long sigh. It was obvious that he had been beaten up a lot before this.

Jian Wushuang looked at the young guard behind him and said in a deep voice, “This is between you guys. We will leave now and not participate in the fight.”

“Cut the crap. Do you think you can still escape unscathed?” the young guard said coldly.

Seeing that there was no hope of leaving, Jian Wushuang was ready to fight when the fiercest battle broke out in the clouds.

The two great forces soared through the clouds and collided with Di Qing, causing the fiercest explosion.

Even the Fusang Tree was shaking. Prince Mo, who was hiding in the crown of the Fusang Tree, was like a bird that was startled by the mere twang of a bow.

As soon as the battle broke out, Di Qing broke away from his Golden Crow form and turned into a divine realm expert.

As the illusionary wings with golden patterns flapped, the two Grand Yan Immortals were unable to move an inch.

Di Qing’s handsome face had a bit of unrestraint and evil as he looked at the two of them proudly.

“If you retreat now, I won’t pursue the matter. If you still insist, I’ll kill you.”

Upon hearing this, the two tall and thin Grand Yan Immortals with black light wheels on their backs showed no expression, as if they did not care at all.

Their goal was very clear, so it was impossible for them to turn back just because of Di Qing’s words.

Immediately after, the two Grand Yan Immortals joined forces again. A huge palm that distorted the clouds and descended smashed at Di Qing.

Di Qing was not afraid. With a ferocious smile in his eyes, he raised his palm and met the attack.

In the next moment, Di Qing’s seemingly light palm actually stopped the descending giant palm.

A red light curled around his palm and instantly covered the entire sky-covering palm with the power of a Prairie Fire.

In just a short moment, the combined attack of the two Grand Yan Immortals was completely burned by the red light, not even leaving a trace of breath.

“Suppress!”

With two loud roars, the mighty Yan power quietly condensed into a huge black cauldron and smashed at Di Qing again. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The illusionary crimson-golden wings on his back flapped, and each wisp of crimson light transformed into a light Golden Crow.

Tens of thousands of Golden Crows formed a formation and charged forward!

Boom boom boom!!!

The collision of the two forces continued to consume energy. The pure black Yan power and the pure gold Yan power wreaked havoc in the clouds, and finally, the clouds could not bear it and began to shatter.

As the huge black cauldron dimmed, Di Qing’s sneer grew more ferocious.

At the same time, nine long scarlet-purple feathers grew from the tip of his hair.

He held one of the long feathers in his hand and pointed the tip at one of the great evolution Immortals. He said casually, “Since you insist on not leaving, then all of you will stay here. I will let you know that even a Grand Yan Immortal can’t fight me.”
