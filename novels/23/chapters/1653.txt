1654 Three-Horned Star Demon

With just the Demon Cores that he had obtained so far, Jian Wushuang felt that he could at most be able to form the second Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet. If he wanted to form the third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet, he would need more Demon Cores.

“I have to continue my massacre and think of a way to get more Demon Cores,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing with a shrill light.

At that moment…

“That is?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed abruptly and his eyes could not help but look in a direction. At the end of that direction, there was a Star Demon moving forward slowly within the detection range of Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power.

Compared to the other Star Demons, that Star Demon was slightly bigger and its body was more robust.

However, what really attracted Jian Wushuang’s attention were the three horns on that Star Demon’s forehead.

A Star Demon with three horns would possess fighting capabilities equivalent to that of a Chaotic Real God.

Moreover, a portion of the body of the Three-Horned Star Demon ahead of him was green in color. Although it was only one portion of its body, it still caused Jian Wushuang’s eyes to turn grave.

“Luckily, this Three-Horned Star Demon has yet to turn green completely. If not, with my current abilities, it would be very difficult to deal with it,” Jian Wushuang said.

He knew that there were three kinds of Three-Horned Star Demons. The first kind was a Three-Horned Star Demon with its body completely black in color. Such a Three-Horned Star Demon would possess fighting capabilities equivalent to that of a normal Chaotic Real God.

The next kind was a Three-Horned Star Demon which was green in color and it possessed fighting capabilities equivalent to that of a top Chaotic Real God.

The last kind was a Three-Horned Star Demon which was crimson in color and it possessed fighting capabilities equivalent to that of an expert in the Real God ranking list.

As for the Three-Horned Star Demon in front of him, its body had a mix of both black and green colors. Thus, it was obvious that its fighting capabilities had not achieved the level of a top Chaotic Real God yet. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Three-Horned Star Demons are a lot stronger than Two-Horned and One-Horned Star Demons. As such, the Demon Core in its body definitely possesses a greater amount of pure power. Also, one Grade Three Demon Core is probably comparable to tens of Grade One Demon Cores,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing brilliantly. His body moved at once and he headed toward the Three-Horned Star Demon.

Atop the dark land, the Three-Horned Star Demon, which was emitting a destructive aura, was moving forward slowly.

However, all of a sudden, the Three-Horned Star Demon which had been moving forward became alarmed. With that, it turned its body fiercely and its scarlet eyes on its head locked on instantly to Jian Wushuang, who was approaching quietly.

“A human cultivator?”

“Die!”

A sharp cry could be heard from the Three-Horned Star Demon. After that, its body turned into a black lightning instantly and moved straight away.

The higher the level of a Star Demon, the more intelligent it was.

For example, immature Star Demons only knew how to eat. However, when they became a Three-Horned Star Demon, they would possess a certain level of intelligence.

“I have been discovered?” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

He had concealed his aura intentionally and approached the Three-Horned Star Demon quietly. However, he did not expect the Three-Horned Star Demon to be so vigilant.

“Since I cannot launch a surprise attack, I shall clash with it head-on,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with murderous intent and his Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared on his hands. In addition, he had also stopped concealing his aura and unleashed it completely.

Rumble~~~ A great amount of aura spread toward the Three-Horned Star Demon.

By holding his sword with one hand, Jian Wushuang became like a big bow and the Blood Mountain Sword on his hand became an arrow. With that, he shot his sword like an arrow straight away.

Swish!

The sword light whistled and ripped open the void in front of him immediately.

“Die!”

The Three-Horned Star Demon’s eyes were scarlet in color. When black light appeared from its body, a great amount of destructive power gathered in its right hand. It then swung its claws with lightning speed.

Bam!

With a loud sound, Jian Wushuang was sent flying at once.

“What a strong power. It feels like it is considerably stronger than a normal Chaotic Real God,” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

However, at that moment, the Three-Horned Star Demon changed into a black shadow, did two simple leaps on the void and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again.

Its sharp claws then attacked fiercely again.

“It is also very fast!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave. His Blood Mountain Sword on his hands then gave a cry and attacked immediately.

Boom!

Their attacks clashed and after that, they began to fight a close-quarters battle.

While Jian Wushuang was fighting an intense battle with the Three-Horned Star Demon, there were two figures moving forward at a void that was not too far away.

Among the two of them, one of them was a plump, bald-headed young man, while the other one was a black-robed old man who looked quite arrogant.

The two of them had also released their consciousness to search for traces of Star Demons.

They had already searched for three consecutive months. However, they had only managed to find a small number of Star Demons. As such, when they split the Demon Spirits and Demon Cores that they had obtained, there were so few of them that it was pathetic.

“In the end, there are too few Star Demons in the inner layer,” the black-robed, arrogant old man said.

“There are many Star Demons in the core region. If you are strong enough, you can be like Real God Zi Ye and go over there,” the plump bald-headed young man laughed.

“Hmph, Real God Zi Ye is a top Chaotic Real God and he is not too far away from the Real God ranking list. Hence, how can I be compared to him?” the black-robed, arrogant old man curled his lips and said.

“Then stop saying unnecessary things and continue to search. Since we have not been in the inner layer for long, we will naturally not have too many Demon Cores. However, as time passes by and we continue to accumulate them slowly, we will definitely make some gains in the end,” the bald-headed young man said.

“You’re right,” the black-robed, arrogant old man nodded his head.

However, at that moment… Boom! Boom!

Soft booming sounds could be heard from a void that was far away. Even though the sounds were very soft as they came from very far away, the black-robed, arrogant old man and the bald-headed young man were Chaotic Real Gods. Hence, they were naturally able to hear it.

“Someone is fighting an intense battle ahead of us?” the black-robed, arrogant old man’s expression changed.

“Let’s go and take a look,” the bald-headed young man said.

The two of them then headed for the source of the sound straight away.

…

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Soft clashing sounds could be heard and two figures were fighting against each other madly at the black void.

Both of them had shocking speed. As they clashed, the impact generated from their clash caused the surrounding void to be torn into pieces. In addition, the ground below them was also in such a tragic state that it was horrible to look at.

Whoosh!

The sharp claws from the Three-Horned Star Demon’s right hand ripped open the void and came in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang then retreated and avoided the attack easily.

“This Three-Horned Star Demon is very impressive in both its attacks and speed. Thus, it is slightly stronger than normal Chaotic Real Gods. Even though its attack moves are simple, they are still frightening. At least, if a normal Chaotic Real God were to fight it, he would probably end up in a tragic state,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

However, at that moment, the Three-Horned Star Demon in front of him opened its fierce-looking mouth.

Its fierce-looking mouth was already extremely huge to begin with. However, at that moment, its mouth expanded abruptly and it looked as though a giant rift had appeared from the black space.

The rift then headed toward Jian Wushuang’s body.

“It actually wants to swallow me in one gulp?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.
