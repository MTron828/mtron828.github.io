Chapter 133: Jian Wushuang?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Silence!

The entire restaurant was so silent that you could hear a pin drop.

“Well, this...” Everyone from Sword Marquis Mansion and the Fierce Beast Gang who were still alive were all stunned.

Were the well-known Three Xu brothers of Tianyan Province dead?

The third oldest Xu Bao was the first one to take action, defeating Meng You and Zhu Yu while seriously wounding them with two consecutive punches. However, he was also the first one to die, being killed in just one move.

Next, the Boss, Xu Long, attacked by himself. As he was ranked on the Earthly Dragon List, the instantaneous release of his aura frightened everyone present. However, he was also killed in a single move.

As for the second oldest, Xu Hu, he hadn’t even taken action before was killed in one move.

The Three Xu brothers were defeated in only three moves.

One for each of them.

There was no room for struggling.

What kind of strength was it?

Horrifying!

Terrifying!

Everyone looked at the black-robed swordsman in alarm.

It was this black-robed swordsman that killed the Three Xu brothers within a moment.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

The black-robed swordsman walked towards the direction where people from the Sword Marquis Mansion were gathered.

At that moment, everyone from Sword Marquis Mansion held their breath. Both Meng You and Zhu Yu cleared their throats and trembled slightly.

Everyone understood that the black-robed swordsman, who was able to kill the Three Xu brothers easily, was also able to kill anyone here easily.

The black-robed swordsman walked slowly, but he didn’t intend to attack anyone. He walked towards the stairs and just happened to pass by Jian Meng’er.

There was also a hint of fear in her heart. When the black-robed swordsman passed by and didn’t continue to attack, she felt relieved. But then, she noticed the Long Sword he carried.

“Ah, what’s that?” Jian Meng’er’s pupil suddenly shrank.

She had practiced with that Long Sword for two months, so she was quite familiar with it.

“The Triple-kill Sword, it’s the Triple-kill Sword.”?Jian Meng’er recognized it immediately, then she shouted, “Jian Wushuang, you are Jian Wushuang!”

The black-robed swordsman who was going downstairs stopped abruptly, but it was only for an instant, then he continued to walk downstairs.

“Jian Wushuang...” Jian Meng’er shouted with her hands clenching.

“Meng’er, what the hell are you talking about?” Jian Xinhong shouted abruptly, “Jian Wushuang died three years ago, how could he be here?”

“Mansion Master?” Jian Meng’er looked at Jian Xinhong astonishedly.

However, Jian Xinhong winked at her.

Jian Meng’er frowned and then recovered herself, saying immediately, “Maybe.”

“You must be wrong,” Jian Xinhong shouted in a low voice.

“Clean up the corpses of the Three Xu brothers. As long as they are dead, we don’t need to worry about the Fierce Beast Gang. As for you...” Jian Xinhong coldly looked towards the warriors of the Fierce Beast Gang who were still alive.

“Mansion Master, please have mercy!”

“We will disband the Fierce Beast Gang immediately!”

“Mansion Master, we beg of you, please have mercy.”

These warriors who just reached the Initial Gold Core Realm immediately begged for mercy.

“It’s ridiculous to beg me for mercy,” said Jian Xinhong, then he sneered and followed with a direct attack.

After a few moments, all of the warriors were immediately killed.

Afterward, the people from Sword Marquis Mansion began to clean up the corpses. At that time Jian Xinhong pulled Jian Meng’er aside and asked her in a low voice, “Meng’er, are you sure that the black-robed swordsman you saw just now was Jian Wushuang?”

“His face was hidden under the bamboo hat, so I wasn’t able to see it clearly.” Jian Meng’er shook her head and continued speaking,”But I recognized the sword he carried. It was the same Triple-kill Sword that I practiced with for two months. What’s more, I could feel a hint of familiarity from the figure of the black-robed swordsman. Thus, I’m quite sure that he is Jian Wushuang!”

“He is definitely Jian Wushuang. The Triple-kill Sword and his figure are the evidence. Jian Wushuang always has the Triple-kill Sword. And you felt his figure was familiar. Besides, he also helped us end this disaster by killing the Three Xu brothers. ” Jian Xinhong smiled and said, “This guy who disappeared for three years has finally come back. But, how was he able to acquire such great strength?”

Jian Meng’er looked a bit unnatural.

How could he be so strong?

An expert like Xu Long, who was ranked on the Earthly Dragon List, was also killed by Jian Wushuang with only?one move. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Only one move. How could his strength be so incredible?

Even her Senior Brother, Ling Feng, whom she considered as her Mr. Right was unlikely to kill Xu Long in a single move.

She came back with confidence, prepared to compete with Jian Wushuang and erase the humiliation she suffered three years ago. However... the gap between them became wider and wider, which made her almost desperate.

It now appeared that was a joke.

“That bastard, how did he make such great progress?”

It was hard for Jian Meng’er to accept the facts. But, her only choice was to believe it.

...

Jian Wushuang left Celestial Immortal Residence and walked out into the street. But he couldn’t help glancing backward at the Celestial Immortal Residence, shaking his head secretly.?“Although I deliberately hid my face and even changed the voice, Jian Meng’er was still able to recognize me.”

“It was because of the Triple-kill Sword that she was able to recognize me.”

Jian Wushuang could do nothing about this. However, even though he was recognized, he didn’t intend to stay behind and chat with them.

If he went back to Sword Marquis Mansion with his true identity, it would be a disaster for Sword Marquis Mansion. Just like what happened three years ago, or even worse.

“Anyway, Sword Marquis Mansion is in good condition and the Sword Pavilion is still there. So it’s fine.”?Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. Just now, he noticed that there were some experts following Jian Xinhong from Sword Marquis Mansion. Because they had the marks of Sword Pavilion on their clothes, it proved that the Sword Pavilion still existed in Sword Marquis Mansion.

Jian Wushuang stayed there for another day. He didn’t feel relieved until after the Three Xu brothers were dead and the whole Fierce Beast Gang was completely torn apart by Sword Marquis Mansion.

After that, he went to the Gladiator Arena to visit Bai Chong.

Jian Wushuang was thankful to Bai Chong. Not only did Bai Chong help him when he was young, Bai Chong also helped hold back the assassins, with a group of experts from the Gladiator Arena, when he was being chased by Blood Feather Tower three years ago. Anyway, Jian Wushuang owed him a lot.

However, it was a pity, Jian Wushuang was unable to meet Bai Chong at the Gladiator Arena. It was said that Bai Chong left Bashui Commandery three years ago, and no one knew where he was.

Jian Wushuang could also do nothing about this. He also left at that night.

After resting assured about Sword Marquis Mansion, he was going to get his revenge on Blood Feather Tower!

“The day I return is the day all you demons die!”

Now, he was back...
