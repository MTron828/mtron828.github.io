Chapter 1795: Ruthless Massacre

“Eh?”

When the Devil Blood, who originally did not spare a glance for the Green Fire Palace, saw Jian Wushuang walking toward him slowly, his eyes shrank.

“Who are you?” the Devil Blood questioned and he was surprised.

It should be known that he was a Real God. Moreover, he was a top Eternal Real God. In the end, he could not see through the other party’s aura?

“My name is Jian Wushuang. You might have heard of me before,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

“Jian Wushuang?” the Devil Blood was stunned. After that, he laughed loudly, “I thought that you were someone else. So it’s the top genius who has killed the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom fifty thousand years ago with his power alone. Even though you have left the Green Fire World to travel in the Eternal Chaotic World, you are still able to return alive. You are indeed somewhat capable.”

After knowing Jian Wushuang’s identity, the Devil Blood did not have any more concerns.

It should be known that Jian Wushuang had only just had the fighting capabilities of a Universe God fifty thousand years ago. How powerful could he be after fifty thousand years?

At best, wouldn’t he just be a normal Real God?

“Jian Wushuang, you should not have returned. The Green Fire World is no longer the Green Fire World that you were once in,” the Devil Blood laughed.

“To me, it’s the same,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Is that so?” the Devil Blood grinned. “Forget it, I shall stop talking to you unnecessarily. Instead, I shall get rid of you straight away so that you will understand that the Green Fire World changed a long time ago.”

“Go to hell.”

As soon as his words left his mouth, the Devil Blood moved fiercely. The enormous amount of aura from an Eternal Real God was then unleashed and it exerted pressure on Jian Wushuang.

The Devil Blood swung his palm with lightning speed. A crimson sharp claw then ripped open the universe and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The moment the Devil Blood attacked, the large number of experts in the war fortress of the Green Fire World became dumbfounded at once.

The abilities that the Blood Devil unleashed caused them to give up all hope.

However, just then, as the crimson sharp claw of the Devil Blood was about to come into contact with Jian Wushuang’s head, Jian Wushuang raised his head.

“Die!”

An icy-cold voice was blurted out. Jian Wushuang did not make any movements at all and he only said one word. However, that word alone contained the frightening god power of an Emperor God!

The god power was very impressive and it exerted pressure as though a giant constellation had fallen.

Bam!

The Devil Blood’s body burst open straight away and turned into a huge amount of blood mist.

The Devil Blood did not experience any pain. In addition, his consciousness had not even reacted as well and he burst open instantly.

When the large number of experts in the war fortress saw the great amount of blood mist falling to the bottom, all of them were extremely dumbfounded.

“He’s dead. The invincible Devil Blood has been killed?”

“He… he didn’t do anything?”

“Indeed, he did not do anything. Instead, he merely relied on the pressure in his aura to burst open a Devil Blood?”

Countless sounds of gasping could be heard. At the next moment, they burst into an uproar as well as cheers.

Quite a number of experts still doubted Jian Wushuang’s abilities. However, At that moment, all their doubts were gone!

“Old Three, Old Three!!!” Wang Yuan and Su Rou were over the moon.

“This is the son of me, Jian Nantian,” Jian Nantian clenched both his fists tightly and looked at Ji Wumeng who was beside him. Both of them were extremely emotional.

“This junior of mine…” Xue Lingtian gasped in admiration.

Everyone was filled with an excitement that could not be concealed.

Only He Xiu and Qiu Yue were extremely calm. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“This piece of trash is merely an Eternal Real God. Yet, he still dared to attack Master,” He Xiu laughed disdainfully.

Just then, Jian Wushuang, who had killed the Devil Blood, returned to the war fortress.

“Boss Wang Yuan, has the information on the Devil Church been prepared?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“It has been prepared and it is here,” Wang Yuan handed a token over to Jian Wushuang.

After receiving it, Jian Wushuang glanced through it. He then nodded his head and said: “Let’s go to the Green Fire World.”

“Why are we going there?” Wang Yuan asked subconsciously.

“To kill people!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was calm and low.

…

The two continents, the Samsara Continent and the Void Continent still existed in the Green Fire World.

The two former overlords, the Void Temple and the Samsara Temple were still present as well. However, their power and positions were no longer like the past.

At that moment, the Devil Church had the most authority in the Green Fire World.

In a garden in an extremely huge castle, a crimson-haired stalwart man was lying on the grass lazily. He wore a gentle smile and looked very understanding toward others. However, the tens of surrounding maids serving him knew very well how frightening and evil an existence the stalwart man was.

In the Devil Church, there were thirteen Devil Bloods. With respect to his abilities, although this crimson-haired stalwart man was ranked eleventh, he was the most evil Devil Blood.

All of a sudden, a gust of cold wind blew by. The body of the maid, who was originally massaging the legs of the crimson-haired stalwart man, shook and she exerted some extra force in her hands…

The crimson-haired stalwart man looked at the maid abruptly and the gentle smile that he wore on his face was charming. However, he raised his finger slightly.

Upon seeing that, the maid’s expression turned ghastly pale at once.

Swish!

A saber light swept past the arm of the maid right away and cut off her whole arm. After that, the crimson-haired stalwart man grabbed the maid’s arm and started to eat it by biting it. After some time, he had eaten the arm completely, to the point that his whole mouth was filled with blood.

“Haha, the taste is not too bad,” after the crimson-haired stalwart man finished eating, he laughed loudly. After that, he moved his finger again and cut off the other arm of the maid.

He then started to eat it.

The surrounding maids who served him trembled with fear and they did not dare to say anything. As for the maid whose arms had been cut off, her face was filled with hopelessness.

Just then…

Buzz!

An astonishing power came.

All of a sudden, the crimson-haired stalwart man’s smile froze and his eyes became filled with fear. After that, his consciousness dissipated right away.

A crimson-robed figure appeared behind the crimson-haired stalwart man abruptly and he extended his big hands to grab the crimson-haired stalwart man’s head. After twisting his head off, he disappeared again.

The maids around him were completely stunned.

As they looked at the headless body in front of them, they became shocked. However, they were delighted!

“Dead. This devil is finally dead.”

The maid whose two arms had been cut off laughed loudly at once.

…

In the void, Jian Wushuang’s body appeared again and his hands were holding a head.

Upon seeing the head, the thousands of experts from the Green Fire Palace who had hurried over became extremely astonished.

“This is the second one.”

Jian Wushuang had an ice-cold expression. After putting the head in his hands into his Qian Kun Ring, he set off again.

The massacre was still ongoing!

The Devil Church had a total of thirteen Devil Bloods. In particular, a portion of them had always stayed in the base of the church. However, some of them stayed in different places and became the tyrants of that place.

As for who Jian Wushuang was currently looking for, he was looking for those ‘tyrants.’

With Jian Wushuang’s absolute abilities, the Devil Bloods who had dispersed everywhere were killed mercilessly
