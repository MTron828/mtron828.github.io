Chapter 1624: The Second One In History

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Star Moon Tower, the fourth floor.

A ten-meter-high golden-armored Ancient God stood in front of Jian Wushuang and held a spear in his hand. His breath was very powerful.

“Jian Wushuang, your opponent on the fourth layer is equivalent to the six-star Ancient God who entered the second stage, which is equivalent to the primary level or medium level of an Eternal Real God.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“The Eternal Real God at the bottom?” Jian Wushuang felt confident.

Jian Wushuang leaped for hundreds of miles in an instant toward the golden-armored Ancient God.

Hey!

Jian Wushuang combined his sturdy power of the sword and his Ancient God Power, as well as his insight on the Reincarnation Doctrine.

This ten-meter-tall golden-armored Ancient God pointed his spear with a horribly great force that instantly smashed the void around Jian Wushuang,

Bang!

However, the golden-armored Ancient God was hit back by Jian Wushuang’s force and had to step back three steps.

“I am a second-stage six-star Ancient God but I am weaker than a five-star ancient god?” the golden-armored Ancient God was shocked.

Suddenly Jian Wushuang waved his sword again.

Incredibly fast.

“How could it be so fast?” The golden-armored ancient god was shocked.

There consecutive attacks from Jian Wushuang.

The first confrontation, the ancient god was forced to step back.

The second confrontation, the spear in his hand flew away.

The third confrontation, Jian Wushuang stabbed the armor of the Ancient God.

The fourth layer had been passed!

“Hey, you were right, it was easy for me to pass the first four layers,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Good job!” King of Venomous Worms said.

For ancient gods, it was difficult for a five-star ancient god to challenge the six-star ancient god, let alone the one in the second stage, which was comparable to the human Eternal Real God level.

Because of the great difficulties, the Star Moon Tower was a nightmare for the ancient gods.

In a long period of time, only one Ancient God had passed the first four layers.

However, for Jian Wushuang, it was a piece of cake.

After all, he could already beat an Eternal Real God at this level when he was passing the Burning Demon Region in the third round of the Inverse Cultivation Test.

Later, after hundreds of years of cultivation, he had relied on his own skills to kill a powerful Real God Shi Jue.

It was enough for him to pass the fourth layer back then.

What’s more, he later went to Thunderbolt Island in the Sanctuary Alliance for more than 1,500 years.

In that 1,500 years, his strength had advanced by leaps and bounds, and he had already reached a new level. Now, it was too easy for him to kill an Eternal Real god of the bottom level, so just passing the fourth layer meant nothing to him.

…

Outside the tower, above the altar.

“This guy passed the fourth layer so easily?”

“How could it be…”

All the Ancient Gods on the altar, including Gu Yi King and Gu Mei, were also shocked.

Countless Ancient Gods were all staring at the Star Moon Tower.

At the beginning, everyone had just come to laugh at Jian Wushuang without expecting him to pass.

But later, they had witnessed Jian Wushuang pass one layer and another very quickly.

Finally, Jian Wushuang had passed the fourth layer!

During that time, the whole audience was quiet.

Silence!

Everyone was speechless.

Soon, they started to discuss excitedly again. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Has this guy really passed the fourth layer?”

“How long has it been since we last saw an ancient god survive the fourth layer?”

“I am not sure but I am sure that he is the second one in history that has passed the fourth layer.”

Many Ancient Gods were all excited.

In the midst of shock and excitement, some people found that Jian Wushuang didn’t immediately come out of the Star Moon Tower as soon as he had passed the test.

He was still in the tower

“Why doesn’t he come out? Is he going to go up to the fifth floor?”

“The fifth floor?”

“Impossible.”

Everyone was holding their breath.

On the fifth layer of the tower also stood a golden-armored Ancient God, but it was as tall as twenty meters.

“Jian Wushuang, the guy in the fifth layer is as strong as an Eternal Real God of the peak level.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Isn’t that the same as the Real God Shi Jue in his heyday?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well, almost,” King of Venomous Worms nodded.

Jian Wushuang smiled.

Real God Shi Jue was close to a peak Eternal True God. Jian Wushuang had once killed Real God Shi Jue, but at that time he had to rely on the Secret Skills of Star Palace. The second reason was that the Real God Shi Jue was seriously injured and only showed 70% of his power.

However, after 1,500 years of cultivation in the Thunderbolt Island, Jian Wushuang was definitely capable of killing Real God Shi Jue with his own power.

On the fifth layer, the golden Real God was like golden lightning, and his voice echoed in this space, “You have already passed the fourth floor and have been recognized by Ancient Gods. You should be content and should not come here! You will die.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang smiled.
