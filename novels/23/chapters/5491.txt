Chapter 5490 ¬†He Had Seen That Scene Before

Recovering to that level in the Four Great Secret Realms ws incredibly difficult.

It's also possible that Fuego hasn't recovered, and among the Inheritors of the Qishen Temple, a super existence has emerged.

At least for now, Shang's future looked promising, with the best chance of breaking through to become the Universe Master in a short period.

But everything was uncertain.

Zhen Ling preferred a more cautious approach, considering the safety of the Qishen Temple.

This time, he made Jian Wushuang walk the precarious path, but it was not just a punishment; there was also a tilt in resources.

Now that the Grave God Mountain has opened many treasure troves, resources kept on being spent.

The purpose was to quickly cultivate these Inheritors to stabilize the Four Great Secret Realms.

It was also a preparation for dealing with Shen Ling's plans and Fuego in the future.

If things came down to it, one could only personally go down and engage in a fight.

Zhen Ling inherited the will of Qishen, and he was not weak. Although he could only take action within the Qishen Temple, it was sufficient.

This time, he would produce a Universe Origin Source. If Jian Wushuang really walks across this precarious bridge, everything will be resolved.

All the previous challenges would be effortlessly overcome.

With a Universe Origin in hand, what else could possibly stand in the way?

Reaching the realm of the black hole was inevitable, and then breaking through to the Ultimate Sword Dao could also be achieved smoothly.

However, Zhen Ling did not know that Jian Wushuang was facing more than just these issues.

Breaking through in Heart Power was a significant obstacle.

He could not break through in his Heart Power cultivation like this.

...

The merging of Thought power, Devour power, and the power of All Things was no less challenging than the Dao Merge.

These concerns were unknown to Zhen Ling.

Only Jian Wushuang knew the difficulty of the path ahead.

It was much harder than the precarious bridge he currently traversed.

Upon stepping onto the narrow bridge, Jian Wushuang's consciousness was immediately detached.

That sensation constantly affected his mental state.

Resulting in his mental state shattering time and time again, only to solidify afterward.

"Being able to influence my mental state, this bridge is even more impactful than the mundane mortal world from the previous time," Jian Wushuang exclaimed, beads of sweat forming on his forehead as he treaded carefully with each step.

Mind you, the mundane mortal world was beneath the bridge.

This was on the bridge itself.

If it tormented people like this on the bridge, then what if one were to fall off...

Jian Wushuang dared not even imagine.

Fall off, and one would be lost.

However, there was a silver lining; he was somewhat pleased. This bridge served as a refinement for his mental state.

If he could break through, along with it, his Heart power would also break through. That would be a double stroke of luck.

He could now touch the threshold of the sixth level of Heart power.

However, this narrow bridge was even more difficult to traverse than he had imagined. At this moment, he relied entirely on his willpower to move forward.

"I must obtain the complete Origin Source of the Universe!" Jian Wushuang's determination was unwavering. At this moment, no one could shake his conviction.

Such was the charm of mental states.

It was also the deficiency that many deceased Emperors had. In ancient times, emperors would fall, their mental consciousness collapsing, self-destructing in the absence of a strong mental state.

In the pursuit of true freedom in the world, Jian Wushuang learned that one must refrain from coveting the beauty of this world.

No matter what, everything is relative.

By letting go of everything, one gains everything‚Äîthis is the fulfillment of the heart's state.

Though he understood the principles, how could Jian Wushuang bring himself to let go?

If he were to abandon the Universe Origin Source and relinquish his life now, he would have likely fallen long ago.

Hence, it was said that the state of one's heart is the most tormenting.

Step by step, countless steps!

What frustrated Jian Wushuang the most was that he didn't know where the end was.

He could only continue walking blindly.

He couldn't sense an end.

Or perhaps it was the end of time.

Maybe it was just a moment, but he felt as if he had experienced an entire era.

Jian Wushuang had felt this way before, back in the starry sky. Although he couldn't perceive the constraints of time, he witnessed the prosperity of a planet.

Whew!

After an unknown amount of time passed, Jian Wushuang began to experience hallucinations.

He saw Dongshen and Wanyan waving excitedly ahead, gesturing for him to persevere.

Even the indifferent and silent Divine General Moyin nodded at him.

In a trance, the beautiful scene flashed by again.

The scene ahead transformed into Dongshen's falling figure.

Wanyan trembled, barely holding on, and Dongshen plunged into the bottomless abyss.

Divine General Moyin also leaped down.

It was a scene of great tragedy.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, suddenly awakening!

"No, it's all fake!" he roared in anger, trying to rouse himself.

At this moment, a voice interrupted him.

"Master, have you entered the illusion again?" an old voice rang out.

The scene began to solidify and change.

It was on that star in the night sky.

The old man was his disciple.

"What is this?" Jian Wushuang was stunned.

How did he end up back here?

Could everything be an illusion?

Jian Wushuang dared not believe it, and directly attacked, fearing the person before him.

In the old man's eyes, there was doubt, there was fear, and then there was understanding.

"It's all fake!"

Jian Wushuang's Thought power moved, but he found that his Thought power had weakened, and his strength had also diminished.

He was clearly about to reach the completion-stage level of Dao Lord, so why did he become a Yan Immortal again?

Everything before him became even more real.

Breaking out of the wooden house, he saw the human race!

He saw that burly man carrying a stone axe, like a wild man.

He was leading the expansion of the human territory, and the strong who died under his axe were endless.

Then the scene changed again.

Jian Wushuang sneered, "Indeed, it's all fake!"

But this time, what he saw was the Qishen Temple.

Or rather, the Qishen Temple that had not been built.

A majestic figure sat on the throne, preaching to all living beings, behind him were a group of Emperors transporting some domains, investing them into the Four Great Secret Realms.

Jian Wushuang looked down upon the majestic figure, desperately trying to see, but still couldn't see clearly, only able to see the jade tablet on the person's prominent thumb.

"Qishen?" Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

His voice made some listening Emperors or Universe Masters dissatisfied, and they turned their heads to glare at him.

Jian Wushuang swallowed hard, frightened into immobility.

Then the scene changed again.

It was still the Qishen Temple.

But this time, the Qishen Temple gave him a very desolate feeling. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

The lonely figure sat on the throne, and there was no one in the Dao Arena.

The scene expanded, Jian Wushuang not only saw Qishen, but also saw the entire Moro Temporal Space filled with an evil aura, the power of Devour.

These evil auras enveloped the Qishen Temple. Apart from the Qishen Temple, the entire Moro Temporal Space was occupied by these evil auras.

Qishen raised his head as if he had discovered Jian Wushuang, weakly saying, "Back then, why did you..."

Before he could finish his sentence, time stopped, and it backtracked.

As if there was a force preventing something, Jian Wushuang could never clearly see Qishen's face.

But Jian Wushuang didn't think much about it himself. He felt that everything was fake, and didn't care at all. Who knew if Qishen was speaking to someone else?

Now, all he wanted was to break through the illusion in front of him!

Otherwise, he would sink deeper and deeper.
