Chapter 2235 Reappearance

“This is... Third Stage Great Emperor?” Abysmal Saint Master, Red Dragon King, and Underworld God were shocked by the aura exuded by Jian Er.A Third Stage Great Emperor, before him there had only been two of such Great Emperors – Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang.

But now, Jian Wushuang’s new Sword Servant was a Third Stage Great Emperor?

“His name is Jian Er, fought me before I Soul Controlled him. He’s injured because of me, so his fighting powers are only at 70%. It’s still at the Third Stage. With Jian Yi and the three of you, it’s more than enough to handle the Black Water Dragon, but be wary of the Ancient Era expert behind it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood,” Abysmal Saint Master and the rest nodded.

Jian Wushuang transmitted for Jian Yi to rush for the Red Dragon Sanctuary. Once everyone was there, they split up.

They divided themselves into three, watching three parts of the Red Dragon Sanctuary.

Red Dragon Sanctuary was a large Sanctuary after all, with vast lands. Three teams made it easier to take care off.

Coupled with various wormholes all over the Red Dragon Sanctuary, the three teams simply guarded the three largest wormholes. Red Dragon Sanctuary transmitted messages to all Almighties and some Real Gods as well, especially those experts that had guarded cities for years. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They were to report to him directly if they were to encounter anything wrong within the city, or if the Black Water Dragon appeared, or if they felt a wave of coldness approaching them. From there, the team guarding that region would rush there immediately. That wouldn’t guarantee they would catch the Black Water Dragon, but it would certainly increase their chances of doing so.

Jian Wushuang and the rest waited quietly.

They did not wait for too long. Three years later, the Black Water Dragon appeared again, attacking a city. That city fell within Jian Wushuang’s guarding domain and he rushed over as soon as he could.

But he was still too slow, the Black Water Dragon had just left.

As he looked over the silent city now frosted in ice, Jian Wushuang could only shake his head and sigh.

Two years later, the Black Water Dragon appeared again in Jian Wushuang’s territory, but Jian Wushuang did not reach it in time.

Just another year later, the Black Water Dragon appeared in Jian Yi and Jian Er’s territory, but it ended up the same.

Since Jian Wushuang and the rest had split up, the Black Water Dragon had attacked thrice. Three different cities, but they could never catch up in time.

“Three times, we’ve failed thrice,” Red Dragon King sighed.

“We don’t have a choice, the Sanctuary is simply too wide. We may be able to split ourselves into teams, then move around via wormholes, but those wormholes don’t reach there directly, we still need to change along the way. That takes a lot of time,” Abysmal Saint Master sighed.

“No rush, we may have missed three times, but luck simply was not on our side, for the Black Water Dragon was simply too far from us. I don’t believe its luck will last long,” Emperor Bai said.

Red Dragon King and the rest nodded.

Indeed, like how Red Dragon King had managed to encounter the Black Water Dragon previously.

Though their chances of catching the Black Water Dragon had increased as they had split into teams, they still needed some luck.

“Right, have you realised the Black Water Dragon’s appetite is growing?” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“Of course, it used to appear once every few decades or so, then every five years, then three, now it appears every year. Seems like it fancies how our cultivators taste,” Red Dragon King said.

“Hngh, the bigger its appetite, the sooner it’ll die, wait till I use its bones for soup!” Emperor Bai snorted.

The few elites of the Sanctuary Alliance, along with Jian Wushuang’s two Sword Servants, continued to wait along the Red Dragon Sanctuary.

...

A vast plain.

An endless plain.

On the plain, an eerie man in black armour was walking forward slowly.

His pace was slow, holding a tree branch to act as his walking stick. He had trouble walking.

On the shoulders of this eerie man was a small black snake.

Upon closer look, the black snake was covered in dark scales and had a little horn on its head.

Suddenly, the snake hissed coldly.

The eerie man stopped in his tracks and looked towards the small black snake.

“You’re hungry again?” the eerie man laughed casually.

The black snake on his shoulders had an eerie gaze in its eyes.

“Okay, I know you’ve been holding up previously. I’ll let you eat till you’re contented now. There should be a cultivators’ city in front. Come back early,” the eerie man instructed.

The snake hissed excitedly and slid off the eerie man’s shoulder. The small snake morphed into a bolt of lightning and headed for the city nearby.

The eerie man smiled, and he sat down with his eyes shut as if he was waiting.

After a while, the black snake appeared in front of the giant city.

The city was one of the largest ones within the Red Dragon Sanctuary, with countless cultivators, and an Almighty.

The little black snake could not contain its excitement.

Suddenly...

Wong!

The small black snake’s body was expanding at an alarming rate.

Instantly, it became an enormous Ancient flood dragon, dark scales covered all over it. It exuded an eerie aura and revealed its two sharp and cold fangs.

Immediately, a terrifying coldness rolled over the city.

The entire city shook.

Jian Wushuang and the others who had been waiting within the Red Dragon Sanctuary had received the news.

The Black Water Dragon was back.
