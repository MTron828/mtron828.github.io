Chapter 2598: Auction

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although it was merely a small cultivation realm breakthrough from the High-level Ultimate God to Peak Ultimate God with Jian Wushuang gaining little improvement in divine power and divine body, his strength had improved tremendously.

“After ten years of meditation and enlightenment, my understanding of Sword Principle has allowed me to achieve merit-level in Sword World. I have also improved a fair bit in Space-time Law and Transmigration Law. I am now considered quite a capable Earth Ultimate God. Now that my divine power has made a breakthrough... I might have become quite a formidable Earth Ultimate God. I should be able to counter a weak Heaven Ultimate God’s attacks in a duel if I ever encountered one by displaying my many secret techniques .”

Jian Wushuang smiled from being pleased with his progress.

He had merely lived for less than 40 years in this current life yet had reached the Peak Ultimate God realm. Anyone would be terrified if they knew. He was able to achieve such impressive progress because of his astounding divine power absorption and refinement speed.

It should not be forgotten that he had also put in a great effort in improving his Sword Principle and understanding of laws.

“I’ve used only two of the three Divine Elixir Pills. There is still one more.”

Jian Wushuang stretched out his hand and grabbed the last pill but did not swallow it. Even if he swallowed it, he could only slightly increase his divine power which had little effect on his combat prowess. A single Divine Elixir Pill was worth five million Primordial Stones which would prove to be quite a handsome sum for the Star Picking Pavilion’s auction.

“After I made a breakthrough to the Peak Ultimate God realm, my needs for purer divine power have become greater. Divine powers from Primordial Stones are no longer useful to me from now on. If I want to improve my cultivation using my body’s terrifying divine power refinement speed, I’ll need to find ways of getting a lot of Divine Elixir Pills.”

“I’m afraid I need about twenty Divine Elixir Pills to progress from a Peak Ultimate God to a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God,” murmured Jian Wushuang. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

20 Divine Elixir Pills would be equivalent to 100,000,000 Primordial Stones.

It was an astronomical figure even to ordinary Heaven Ultimate Gods. Perhaps those who were extremely powerful or originated from an impressive background could produce such a huge amount of wealth but it would not be easy.

Jian Wushuang was lucky to have met Su Qin who was willing to give away three Divine Elixir Pills in exchange for the Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect’s token.

Otherwise, it would be very difficult for him to get hold of even a single Divine Elixir Pill.

“It’s impossible to get that many Divine Elixir Pills now. I shall slowly figure something out,” muttered Jian Wushuang before leaving the underground palace.

Jian Wushuang summoned Xiao Tiexin and Cang Heng the moment he arrived at the hall.

“The Narcissus Territory auction will start in a few months. I have a few items to be auctioned so I’ll need to head there in advance. Both of you will be in charge of Northern Darkstar Territory’s matters while I’m away,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Cang Heng nodded.

“Master, do you want me to go with you?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“No, I can go alone.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He left on that day itself.

The Narcissus Territory was quite far away from the Northern Darkstar Territory and would take a long time for him to arrive at the destination. The auction might be over when he finally arrived. Nonetheless, there were wormholes around the Northern Darkstar Territory.

Through the wormholes, Jian Wushuang soon appeared in the Narcissus Territory.

Stellar regions differed in size. The Narcissus Territory was much larger than the Northern Darkstar Territory. A larger territory would produce more experts, resulting in more complicated forces controlling a territory. It was arduous for the Narcissus Territorial Lord to stabilize the situation within his stellar region.

Therefore, the Narcissus Territorial Lord was much more powerful than the Territorial Lord from other stellar regions with news stating the Narcissus Territorial Lord was a Heaven Ultimate God!

Due to the Narcissus Territory being one of the larger stellar regions in Danyang Holy Domain, the Star Picking Pavilion had chosen to hold the auction event there.

In a magnificent and huge stone fort constructed entirely of red quicksand, the quicksand was flowing slowly like a river and breathing life into the stone fort.

The Star Picking Pavilion was located exactly in that stone fort.

Although it was only one of Star Picking Pavilion’s sub-pavilions in Danyang Holy Domain, its outlook was still magnificent and breathtaking.

In front of the stone fort’s gate, four tall and burly figures stood there motionless like sculptures with their eyes occasionally scanning the passers-by or people walking out of the stone fort. Those four people were excusing the divine power breath of an Ultimate God.

The Star Picking Pavillion was indeed impressive that even their guards were Ultimate Gods!

Draped in a golden robe, Jian Wushuang with a longsword on his back arrived at the magnificent red stone fort and did not deliberately constraint his divine power breath. He was exuding the divine power breath of a High-level Earth Ultimate God under the black stone’s disguise.

“Is this the Star Picking Pavilion?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and glanced at the towering red stone fort in front of him before walking into the fort without any hesitation.

The four Ultimate Gods experts who were guarding the stone castle immediately locked their eyes on Jian Wushuang but did not stop him from entering the stone fort.

Jian Wushuang saw a huge hall as soon as he entered the stone fort. There were a large number of various cultivators in the hall with many of them being Ultimate Gods.

As soon as Jian Wushuang entered, his High-level Earth Ultimate God divine power breath became conspicuous.

Instantly, a black chief from Star Picking Pavilion greeted Jian Wushuang in person.

The Black Chief was also a genuine Primary-level Earth Ultimate God.

“Master, a pleasure to have met you. You look unfamiliar. This must be the first time you’re here in the Star Picking Pavilion’s sub-pavilion of Narcissus Territory. Are you an expert traveling alone or a Territorial Lord of any stellar region?” The Black Chief casually asked.

Jian Wushuang did not reply and brought out a token instead.

The token represented the identity of a Territorial Lord with the names ‘Northern Darkstar’ and ‘Jian Yi’ on it.

“Oh, you’re Jian Yi. The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.” The Black Chief smiled. “Master, please come inside.”

Under the guidance of the Black Chief, Jian Wushuang arrived at a separate room. The room was under the protection of a restrictive shield while the Black Chief stood humbly in front of Jian Wushuang.

The Black Chief asked, “Master, how can the Star Picking Pavilion help you?”

“I heard there will be a large-scale auction here soon. I want the Star Picking Pavilion to help me put a few things up for auction. Is it possible?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Black Chief and calmly said.

“Of course, but we do charge a small fee. What treasures are you putting up for auction?” asked the Black Chief.
