Chapter 865: The Encounter

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Eternal Realm cultivators, known as eternal existences, had endless lives, and the cores inside their bodies were Life Cores.

As long as their Life Cores weren’t broken, they weren’t dead.

This burly man did not have a life core, so naturally, he could not have been an Eternal Realm human warrior.

Besides, the burly man had nothing with him except a broad thick broadsword, not even an Interspatial Ring.

It seemed that he was very similar to the Puppet Fighters in the Eternal World, but they were merely similar and were quite different in some respects.

“I don’t know what kind of monster he is, but his strength is really terrifying. I have lived for a long time. I have seen countless Eternal Realm experts, including experts at peak Eternal Realm who are stronger than me. But none of them could do anything but escape if they met this guy.” Jiu Zui marveled.

“Eternal Realm cultivators with such terrifying offensive power, speed, defense, and Saber Techniques, are absolute nightmares to deal with.” Shui Jin nodded. “Thanks to Blood Mountain’s Killing Move, we could just about kill him.”

As Jian Wushuang spoke, Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin all looked at him with weird expressions.

They had fought to the best of their abilities, and they couldn’t harm the burly man in the slightest. But Jian Wushuang killed him easily with a Killing Move.

“The Blood Shadow just now...” They could not help but recall the Killing Move Jian Wushuang had just displayed.

The Blood Shadow was so fast that it was a blur to them.

Its power was extremely formidable.

Jiu Zui’s strongest shot merely had extremely strong power, but Jian Wushuang’s Killing Move was a combination of speed and power.

Additionally, its strongest point was its speed.

It was because its speed was so fast that the burly man could not parry it in time, and Jian Wushuang could kill him at one fell swoop.

“Blood Mountain, I really didn’t expect that you, a Divine Realm expert, could actually possess such a terrifying Killing Move.” Jiu Zui stared at Jian Wushuang.

Just now, he had still had absolute confidence in his strongest shot. Although he knew Jian Wushuang had a Killing Move, he thought his Killing Move must not have been as terrifying as his strongest shot.

But it was proven, Jian Wushuang’s Killing Move was definitely several times more formidable than his strongest shot.

Take the burly man just now for an example: Jiu Zui had displayed his strongest move, but he could not gain the upper hand. But Jian Wushuang’s Killing Move killed the burly man in seconds.

“No wonder you dared to say that few Eternal Realm experts could block your Killing Move. It’s indeed very formidable, as it could even kill such an appalling human-shaped monster. I wonder who among the Eternal Realm cultivators in the Eternal World could survive your Killing Move?”

“If there really is someone who can, perhaps it’s the first so-called Master Mubai of the Xia Clan of the Eternal Realm in the Eternal World.” Shui Jin marveled.

“Okay, let’s forget about him for a moment,” Jian Wushuang said, changing the subject. “We had barely entered this Stellar Fog Sea when we met that human-shaped monster. I really have no idea what will happen next. We had better be as careful as we can.”

“Yes, you’re right. We met such a horrifying humanoid monster at the beginning, maybe we’ll encounter even greater trouble.” Jiu Zui nodded solemnly.

“Go, let’s keep going.”

The group did not linger for too long, but continued straight ahead.

...

There was a vast lake in the depths of the Stellar Fog Sea.

The lake was also filled with vast gray fog, and there were all kinds of lotus leaves in the lake. Unlike in the outside world, the lotus leaves here were very huge, and each of them was like a ship, big enough for dozens of people to stand on.

There was an enchanting woman in red sitting cross-legged in the middle of one of the lotus leaves.

The enchanting woman had been sitting on the lotus leaf for a long time, but she suddenly opened her eyes when Jian Wushuang deployed the first sword formation of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation and killed the burly man.

Her eyes were beautiful and bright like jewels.

At that moment, a small, strange smile slowly crept across her mouth.

“He actually killed a Blood Demon?”

“Because of the special restriction, cultivators above Dao Master can’t enter this Stellar Fog Sea. Only those young men in the Eternal Realm can enter it. The Blood Demon is the nightmare of Eternal Realm cultivators, and even if many top Eternal Realm cultivators teamed up, logically speaking, only he could kill them. But now, he has actually been destroyed?”

“Interesting, it seems that before long there will be another interesting young man on Star Island,” the enchanting woman in red muttered.

She then closed her eyes again.

After killing the Blood Demon, a humanoid monster, the group forged ahead, and they grew significantly more cautious.

They also slowed down.

Three days later, the four met their second creature in the Stellar Fog Sea. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Unlike the humanoid monster before, the second creature they met was actually a one-eyed giant with a height of about one hundred meters.

The one-eyed giant held a mace with tremendous murderous intent. When he saw the group, he did not speak as the human-shaped monster did, he immediately rushed toward them.

The four of them were very vigilant at first, and they fought with the giant very cautiously, but soon they found the One-eyed Giant was clearly weaker than the human-shaped monster Jian Wushuang had killed.

All four of them were strong enough to fight head-on with the One-eyed Giant and could outclass him.

As a result, they worked together and easily killed the One-eyed Giant.

They continued on their adventure and met many living beings.

From the humanoid monster and the One-eyed Giant at the beginning to the various strange forms of Exotic Beasts, the group had never seen these before in the Eternal World. They were unique to this Stellar Fog Sea. They were extremely strong, and many of them had the strength of peak Step Six of the Eternal Realm. However, they were far weaker than the human-shaped monster they had met at the beginning.

These Exotic Beasts immediately attacked the group when they saw them, so the group had to constantly find new ways to deal with them.

The Stellar Fog Sea was boundless, and the fog was spread throughout. The four people could not clearly make out which way to go, so they had to continually walk forward and explore.
