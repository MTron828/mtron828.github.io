“Is Jian Wushuang finally going to die?”

Leng Ruxue was pale and her aura was extremely weak. She watched what was happening extremely coldly.

“An expert in the Chaotic Realm who has the Body of Undying is indeed unique. However, having the Body of Undying does not mean one cannot be killed. Back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, there were many Undying Saints who had the Body of Undying who died. During the battle against Seven Star Black Sect alone, many Undying Saints passed on.” The bald man smiled lightly.

Indeed, just like this bald man had said, having the Body of Undying did not mean that one would never die.

Within the Absolute Beginning Divine World, there were many ways to kill an Undying Saint. Out of the many, there were three very popular ways.

The first way: when there is a great difference in power level and divine power, one could destroy the other’s divine body and cover it up using their own divine power to annihilate them.

The second way: trap the person you want to kill and destroy his divine body and force him to reform his divine body over and over again. When he runs out of divine power, he’ll be dead.

As for the third and most simple way: use a soul attack.

Body of Undying only meant the divine body could be reformed. It did not mean that their soul power could be. If one’s soul died, the Body of Undying could not help them.

The method the woman in crimson clothes used to try and kill Jian Wushuang was the first method.

She was a Master of the Holy Land. The power she could use within this area covered in black mist was the peak of Divine Demons. On the other hand, the power that Jian Wushuang could use was that of the weakest Divine Demon. The gap in divine power was extremely big.

Furthermore, given the amount of methods she had as a Master of the Holy Land had, she could annihilate Jian Wushuang easily.

No matter if it was the woman in crimson clothes, the bald man or Leng Ruxue, they thought that Jian Wushuang was definitely dead in this situation.

In reality, that was true. Even Jian Wushuang thought that he was dead meat.

Just then, an abnormality occurred!

The ocean of red divine power annihilated everything there was, including Jian Wushuang’s divine body and divine power. Even the treasure that Jian Wushuang had on him was annihilated. Only the Five Gem Armor and the Blood Mountain Sword survived the annihilation.

Jian Wushuang’s Qian Kun Ring could not withstand the power and broke apart.

Boom! His Qian Kun Ring broke apart as all of the treasures within his ring spilled out into the open. These were treasures obtained from all of the experts that Jian Wushuang killed.

There were numerous treasures. If they had appeared in the Eternal Chaotic World, countless experts would have died to have them. However, to a Master of the Holy Land, these were trash. The woman in crimson clothes could not be bothered by it and allowed the ocean of red divine power to annihilate these treasures as well.

Countless treasures turned into dust.

What she did not know was that there was a unique treasure within his Qian Kun Ring.

This treasure was the Reincarnation Pearl, given to him by One Star Man three-thousand nine-hundred years ago!

Reincarnation Pearl contained a miniature reincarnation within it. It was extremely beneficial for Jian Wushuang to meditate to understand Reincarnation Rules of Order.

Jian Wushuang used this pearl to greatly deepen his understanding of reincarnation. He had even created an extremely powerful sword skill called Samsara.

Jian Wushuang never doubted the purpose of this pearl.

He thought it could only be used to help him understand Reincarnation Rules of Order.

Under the destructive power of the woman’s ocean of red divine power, the Reincarnation Pearl broke.

Hum~~~

A unique energy swept forth.

This energy was purely Reincarnation Rules of Order. A miniature reincarnation had originally been contained within the Reincarnation Pearl. Now, it had appeared in this Heaven and Earth.

Once it appeared, it stirred the surrounding Power of Heaven and Earth as the miniature reincarnation soon enlarged into a complete reincarnation passage!

Yes, a complete Reincarnation Passage had been formed.

It was completely different from the passageway that the Masters of the Holy Land had opened.

The passageway they opened led to Absolute Beginning Divine World. This Reincarnation Passage led to Samsara.

“Reincarnation Passage?”

“What... Why would a Reincarnation Passage appear here?”

The faces of the woman in crimson clothes and the bald man turned dark.

This was completely beyond their expectations.

When the Reincarnation Passage was finally complete...

“Is it finally time?”

A deep and magical voice was heard.

When this voice echoed out, everyone stopped and looked. No matter if it was the woman in crimson clothes, the bald man, Leng Ruxue, Leng Ruxue’s master, Emperor Thirteen, One Star Man, Bing Shan, Emperor Bai, Elder She Hua and Saint Soul, all of them stopped what they were doing and looked over.

They were searching for the source of the voice.

Even in the space far away, the great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World looked over.

There, right below the beautiful picture scroll world, a blurry figure appeared.

It was a well built man in white clothes. He looked gentle and smiled lightly. His smile made people feel at peace.

He stood there and radiated no aura at all. It was as though he was of air.

However, once these experts looked at him, they could not take their vision off him anymore.

“It is him!”

The great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World managed to recognize this man immediately.

During the final battle against the Three Emperors World, it had been this man who had appeared at the final, critical moment and helped Jian Wushuang kill Blood Emperor.

They all knew that this mysterious man was Jian Wushuang’s master!!

“He is here. It is finally starting!”

When Emperor Thirteen and One Star Man saw who it was, they were overjoyed.

Even Emperor Thirteen, who was usually cold and quiet, got extremely emotional. It was as though his eyes were shooting rays of excitement.
