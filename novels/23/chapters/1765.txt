“Humph!”

A cold humph and a boundless divine power instantly exploded from Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s divine body magnified at a terrifying speed. Ten zhang! Hundred zhang! Thousand zhang! Ten thousand zhang!

A huge dark gold Ancient Gold body grew tremendously in size. In addition to the ravages of divine power, he forced the wrapped green lotus flower to break and a hole appeared.

Jian Wushuang held a sword in one hand and slashed at the hole. Then, the green lotus flower broke apart.

“What?”

The four Sir Gods in the formation looked shocked.

The move that they had performed using the formation, even an ordinary Emperor God would find hard to shake it off. However, Jian Wushuang had resolved it so easily.

“Don’t waste time with him. Let’s use the strongest move!” Sir God Qing Fu bellowed.

“Alright,” the other three Sir Gods nodded heavily.

In the eyes of the four Sir Gods, there was a cyan shimmer while boundless divine power flowed into the formation.

“Life Force, Continuous Reincarnation… Last Forever!”

Hong!

The withering became full of vigor again and the vines were gathering at an insane speed. Then, they formed an ancient green tree. The ancient green tree looked as though it had existed since ancient times. It constantly grew and extended to the sky.

Just as the ancient green tree formed its shape, the extremely thick branch… Wow!

A green branch swept at Jian Wushuang. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone on the scene looked surprised at the green branch.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock subconsciously. From his viewpoint, it equaled a Sir God’s full hit.

“This is your final reliance?”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. His huge Ancient God body had shrunk to only ten zhang tall but he gripped Blood Mountain Sword tightly in his hand.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes let out a faint light and boundless reincarnation power swept out.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, the second move!”

There was a flash of murderous intention and Blood Mountain Sword was suddenly swung out along with boundless reincarnation power.

Reincarnation Sword Principle… Jian Wushuang had created it via his understanding of the palm One-star Man had left in his head during the few thousand years when Jian Wushuang had been recovering in seclusion.

Jian Wushuang had created a total of two moves for the sword principle.

He had performed the first move earlier and it broke Soaring Heaven Mansions’ protective array.

Then, he was performing the second move.

Bang!

The sword light with boundless reincarnation power hit the green branch and a terrifying power exploded.

In an instant, it was dark all around!

A boundless divine power suddenly swept out in all directions and everyone gulped in shock.

Suddenly…

Kacha!

It was only a soft crack but Sir God Qing Fu and the other three Sir Gods’s eyes dilated in shock. Then, before their dumbstruck gazes, the green branch that they were driving with the formation cracked from the middle. Then, a sword light pierced the green wood and it broke into two.

The sword light quivered and continued to move in the direction of the four of them.

Sir God Qing Fu harrumphed coldly and the life force instantly gathered in front of them and formed layers of defense. With difficulty, they managed to block the sword light. However, just then, two resplendent golden lights suddenly lit up and they appeared behind the four of them.

“Sh*t!”

The four of their faces grew grave.

Of course they knew about the golden lights. They were the two Hong Jun Golden Swords that Jian Wushuang controlled.They had just withstood the sword light that Jian Wushuang had struck and the two Hong Jun Golden Sword had suddenly attacked them from behind. The four of them didn’t respond in time.

Psst! Psst!

The resplendent golden light instantly pierced two heads. As for the remaining two, they fled in panic.

The Formation of Everlasting Green that covered the entire Soaring Heaven Mansion collapsed.

“Hehe, I thought the four of you teaming up would bring me joy. From the looks of it, you’re only so-so,” Jian Wushuang smiled and the two golden lights twinkled next to him.

In the void far away, Sir God Qing Fu and the beast-like man stared at Jian Wushuang.

They had never expected that they would be defeated by Jian Wushuang when the four of them teamed up to form the Formation of Everlasting Green. On top of that, Jian Wushuang had killed two of them.

One should know that they were confident to even fight with an ordinary Emperor God with the formation.

But Jian Wushuang was only a Real God.

Since the Formation of Everlasting Green collapsed and the four Sir Gods were heavily defeated. Then…

“I told Real God Xue Kong to bring you a message earlier for you to clean your neck. Now…” There was a flash of murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Swoosh!

He suddenly moved and appeared among the surrounding crowd. The crowd were experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace. Many of them were Real Gods of Soaring Heaven King Palace and there were many Universe Gods as well.

However, Jian Wushuang showed no mercy.

“Die!”

He swept the sword across and a sword light was swung out brutally. A total of thirteen Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace, along with three top Universe Gods, couldn’t even react before the sword light swept past them. They were instantly killed. As the same time, two resplendent golden light suddenly swept out and shuttled through the crowd.

The power of Hong Jun Golden Sword wasn’t something Real God or Universe God could withstand. Plus, its speed was so fast and there were two swords.

Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst!

There were continuous noises and the void instantly turned into a living hell.

“No!!!”

“Hurry up and run!”

“Spare me. Don’t kill me!!!”

The experts in Soaring Heaven King Palace gave out a blood-curdling scream simultaneously.

Sir God Qing Fu and the beast-like brawny man in the void faraway were furious at the sight.

“B*stard!”

The brawny man let out an angry roar and charged at Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t act on impulse!” Sir God Qing Fu wanted to stop him but the brawny man was in complete madness and his eyes were bloodshot.

Jian Wushuang was terrified but thrilled at the brawny man’s arrival.

“No matter how many Real Gods I killed, how could it be more satisfying than killing an Almighty?” Jian Wushuang smiled and murderous intention filled his eyes. As the brawny man arrived, the two golden lights shuttling to and from the crowd suddenly changed their directions and aimed at the brawny man.

“Die!”

The brawny man wielded a saber and hit the two golden lights.

Dang!

A loud thud and the power of the first Hong Jun Golden Sword made the brawny man retreat and spit a mouthful of blood. Then, the second Hong Jun Golden Sword immediately pounded and pierced the brawny man’s head.

Then, the four Sir Gods in Soaring Heaven Mansion, Jian Wushuang had already killed three of them!
