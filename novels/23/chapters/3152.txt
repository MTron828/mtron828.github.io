Chapter 3153: Requests to See the Palace Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

In an extremely special space-time in the Divine Beginning Realm, there was a huge island.

The island was beautiful and incomparably quiet.

In the center of the island, there was a courtyard that looked like an ordinary person’s house. Beside the lake in the middle of the courtyard, a woman in red was sitting upright, quietly fishing.

Suddenly, the space-time around them fluctuated, and a human figure appeared next to them.

It was a middle-aged man who was over five meters tall and looked like a mountain.

“Ba Cang, why are you here?” The woman in red did not even glance at the middle-aged man. She just asked casually.

“I’m here to seek an audience with the hall master.” The mountain-like middle-aged man, Ba Cang, said.

“Seek an audience with the Hall Master?” The red-robed woman turned her head. “It’s not that you don’t know where the Hall Master is right now. Furthermore, when the hall master left, he instructed us not to bother him unless it’s an urgent matter. As far as I know, nothing major has happened in the hall during this period of time.”

“It’s true that nothing major has happened, but what happened today...” Ba Cang frowned. Following this, he took out a token. “You should understand after looking at this mirror image.”

The jade token was activated and a mirror image immediately appeared in the air.

The red-robed lady also looked at the mirror image. At first, she was very calm and there was not the slightest ripple. However, after a short moment, her pupils suddenly shrank and a trace of shock flashed in the depths of her eyes!

Very quickly, the image disappeared.

“Now you know why I want to see the Hall Master, right?” Ba Cang asked.

“I know.” The red-dressed woman nodded slightly. Soon after, she stood up. “Wait a moment. I will first send a message to the Hall Master to see if it is convenient for him.”

Ba Cang waited there.

A moment later...

“Alright.” The red-dressed woman said. After which, she took out an ancient bronze mirror. Following a few special hand seals, the surface of the bronze mirror began to ripple like a lake, gradually, a human face was formed.

This human face had the appearance of an old man that was covered in wrinkles. The old man had silver-white hair and looked extremely ancient.

When they saw this human face, the red-dressed woman and Ba Cang immediately bowed. “Lord Palace Master!”

“Speak, what do you want from me?” The silver-white-haired old man’s voice was very casual. He did not have any airs, nor did he have any high and mighty appearance. He even called himself ‘I’ and looked very amiable.

“Temple Master, there is a mirror image here. Please take a look.” Ba Cang took out the mirror image again.

The mirror image was the fierce battle between Jian Wushuang and Bai Yuan. From the beginning to the end, it was very complete.

“A rank four True Saint versus a rank seven True Saint?” The silver-haired elder raised his eyebrows. When he saw that Jian Wushuang could fight with Bai Yuan in the mirror image, the silver-haired elder could not help nodding in admiration. “It’s amazing that a rank four True Saint can have such battle strength.”

“Temple Master, keep watching,” Ba Cang said.

In the image, it was Bai Yuan’s strongest move, but he still did not hurt Jian Wushuang.

At this point, the silver-haired elder still looked calm.

But at this time, Jian Wushuang finally used his full strength. He directly used his killer move, Blood Asura!

It was this move that made the silver-haired old man squint his eyes.

“This swordsmanship...is a bit interesting.” The silver-haired old man revealed a faint smile.

After Blood Asura was used, Jian Wushuang should have continued to use the six paths of reincarnation secret skill to kill Bai Yuan. But after Blood Asura used his sword, Ba Cang directly took back the mirror token.

“Temple Master, this little guy is called Heavenly Sword Marquis. He is alone and hasn’t joined any sects. He is only an ordinary heaven-level member in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” Ba Cang said.

“Well, this little guy is good. Send someone to bring him back immediately,” the silver-haired elder said.

“Yes.” Ba Cang nodded respectfully.

And in the copper mirror, the silver-haired elder’s face had already disappeared.

Outside the Divine Beginning Realm...the cosmic battlefield where danger and countless opportunities converged!

This place was filled with blood and death.

In the northern part of the cosmic battlefield, there was a planet that was already barren. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Although this planet was already barren and on the verge of collapse, its size was inconceivable.

On this planet, on a desolate land, a silver-haired old man dressed in simple clothes slowly stood up.

The old man’s gaze was deep, but his gaze was incomparably gentle. There was a hint of evil between his brows, and his aura was also incomparably unique. This was an extremely strange and unusual person.

“He actually fused the spacetime divine art I created with my own sword art, creating a sword art that can cause spacetime to stop. This has never happened before.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis...what an interesting little fellow. Even I can’t help but want to meet this little fellow.”

The silver-haired old man sighed softly. He began to ponder in his heart.

After a long while, he made up his mind. “Forget it. I’ve been adventuring in this universe battlefield for so long. It’s time for me to go back and take a look. On the way, I’ll be able to meet this little fellow who surprises me and surprises me.”

The silver-haired elder smiled and then took two steps forward.

These two steps were very casual. It seemed like a casual step, but one step was enough to take him out of the star, and another step would take him to the void hundreds of millions of miles away from the star.

...

In the First Heaven of the Divine Beginning Realm, in the void of the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

Jian Wushuang flew while summarizing the battle.

This battle was not only to kill Bai Yuan but also to take revenge on the Purple Cloud Pavilion. The most important thing was that he wanted to temper himself and determine his true strength.

After the battle, he had a clear understanding of his strength.

“Now, my battle strength should be comparable to that of an ordinary initial rank seven True Saint in a head-on fight. Once I use my trump card and the six paths of reincarnation secret skill, an ordinary initial rank seven True Saint would find it difficult to resist and would have to be killed. If It’s an advanced rank seven or peak rank seven, I’m afraid that I can’t kill them with just the extremely hot hell and the extremely cold hell of the Hell Dao!”

“In other words, I can only fight with a rank seven advanced True Saint. If I meet someone at the peak of rank seven or above, I can only run for my life,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

At this moment...

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and he took out a token.

This token was Mo Shan’s communication token.

“Elder Mo Shan, you’re looking for me?” Jian Wushuang immediately replied.
