“Yes.” Prince Qing nodded, but she did not dare to show any arrogance.

She was very clear that if her identity as a princess was in the Zhen Wu Country, it would naturally be incomparably lofty. However, if it was in the first sky, it would not be a big deal.

After all, the first sky was vast and boundless. There were countless countries. Not many people would care about a mere princess from an ordinary country.

At the very least, a sect like the Holy Feather Sect could not care about the entire Zhen Wu Country, let alone a princess from a country.

“I have already confirmed with Elder Qi Chen that he indeed has the intention to take you as his disciple. However, whether you can really become his disciple will depend on your own ability,” said the thin and weak elder.

Prince Qing’s expression changed, but his gaze became firm.

Under the guidance of the thin and frail elder, it did not take long for the three of them to arrive at a huge training ground of the Holy Feather Sect.

There were quite a few people on the training ground at this moment, and in the middle of the training ground, there was a special array formation.

“Has the sky puppet array formation been set up?” The weathered elder called a person over to ask.

“Elder Xin, it’s already set up, but I wonder who is going to break through the Sky Puppet Array Formation?” The deacon replied.

“Her.” The thin elder pointed at Qing, he said, “Mu Qing, Elder Qichen has already ordered you to challenge the Sky Puppet Formation. If you can last ten breaths in the Sky Puppet Formation, you can become his in-name disciple. If you can last twenty breaths, you can become his personal disciple. But if you can’t even last ten breaths, then he will be wrong. You can go back to where you came from.”

“Trying to break through this formation?” Prince Qing’s expression was solemn as he immediately looked toward the formation at the center of the arena.

The formation was extremely unique, and at the center of the formation were many incomparably tall and sturdy figures.

These tall and sturdy figures were all-powerful sky puppets.

Every single one of them possessed true saint level battle prowess, and there were six sky puppets within the formation.

“Remember, you only have one chance. Go.” The old man waved his hand.

Princess Qing was a bit nervous. She took a deep breath, but her eyes quickly became resolute.

Under the gazes of many Holy Feather Sect disciples, Princess Qing entered the center of the array.

“Let’s begin.”

As the old man ordered, the deacon immediately activated the sky puppet array.

In an instant, the six heavenly puppets in the center of the formation woke up and attacked Prince Qing.

Prince Qing also took out a jade-green spear and fought with the heavenly puppets.

As for Jian Wushuang and Yuan Chong, they watched from outside the formation.

“Prince Qing, go for it!”

Yuan Chong clenched his hands, his eyes full of expectation.

“The six sky puppets seem to be quite strong. Each one of them has the battle strength of a first rank true saint. The six of them working together put a lot of pressure on Prince Qing.” Jian Wushuang also watched everything in the formation, suddenly, his pupils constricted again.

“No, the Sky Puppet Magic Formation is not that simple. The six heaven puppets have been increasing their strength during the fight with Prince Qing. Moreover, their speed of improvement is very fast. If they continue at this speed, their strength should reach the peak of rank one or even close to a rank two True Saint in 20 breaths. It will be very difficult for them to resist the six sky puppets at the same time.”

Jian Wushuang could tell that the sky puppet formation was extraordinary.

Inside the formation, Emperor Qing was fighting with the six sky puppets. At first, he was calm, but as time went by, it became more and more difficult.

After five breaths, Emperor Qing was under a certain amount of pressure.

After ten breaths, Emperor Qing was completely suppressed by the six sky puppets.

“Ten breaths!” Yuan Chong’s heart skipped a beat.

According to what the old man had said, as long as she could hold on for ten breaths in the heavenly puppet formation, Princess Qing would be able to become the in-name disciple of Elder Qi Chen.

Although the in-name disciple was far inferior to the personal disciple, it was still not bad. At the very least, they would not have come all this way for nothing.

“Twelve breaths, Princess Qing, hold on, you must hold on!” Yuan Chong roared in his heart.

Very soon, her Highness Qing had walked through fourteen breaths of time within the sky puppet array. At this moment, she had already been completely suppressed and forced into a sorry state by the six sky puppets, but she was still doing her best to hold on.

And when her Highness Qing was trapped within the sky puppet array...

In the void not far away, several figures were slowly drifting forward.

“Sect Master Moon Reflection, your Holy Feather Sect is really magnanimous.” A calm laughter rang out. This laughter was said very casually, and it was unknown if it was really praising the Holy Feather Sect, and the one who spoke was a black-haired demonic youth. The aura emitted from this black-haired demonic youth was not very strong and was only at the first level True Saint Realm.

“Haha, my Holy Feather Sect is only slightly bigger, but it doesn’t have too many extraordinary things. Compared to many ancient sects in the first sky, it’s too far away. For example, the Young Divine Sect directly established its sect in a Mystic Realm of heaven and earth. How amazing is that?

“Also, take the Heaven-cleaving Alliance where the two young friends are from. Legend has it that one of the two great headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Heaven-cleaving Star, was moved back from the universe battlefield. It contains all sorts of mystical things. That’s what makes it amazing,” said a beautiful purple-clothed woman leisurely.

“After all, the Young Divine Sect has given birth to a Principles Master. It’s normal for it to have a Mystic Realm of heaven and earth. As for the Heaven-cleaving Star of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance... That’s incomparable,” the black-haired demonic youth said.

“Of course.” The purple-robed beautiful woman smiled.

“Oh?” The black-haired demonic youth’s expression suddenly moved, but his gaze landed on the martial practice field in front of him. “That martial practice field seems to be very lively. What is it doing?”

“This...” The purple-robed beautiful woman also glanced at the training ground, and her expression could not help but change. “It looks like someone is barging into the sky puppet formation.”

“Sky puppet formation? Let’s go and take a look.” The black-haired demonic youth immediately rushed over, and beside him was a white-robed woman. Although she did not say anything, she still followed him.

The purple-robed beautiful woman and a few experts from the Holy Feather Sect behind her naturally followed.

In the blink of an eye, these people had already arrived at the void around the training field.

“Is that your Holy Feather Sect’s sky puppet formation? It looks very ordinary.” The black-robed devilish youth stared at the scene inside the sky puppet formation, but the corners of his mouth revealed a trace of disdain.

“Hehe, although the strength of the six sky puppets in the sky puppet formation can continuously become stronger, no matter how strong they are, they can only reach the second level true saint level. It’s more than enough to test the strength of ordinary disciples, but it’s useless to some top geniuses like you two young friends..” The purple-robed beautiful woman said.
