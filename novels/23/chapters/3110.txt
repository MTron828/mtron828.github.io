Chapter 3111: Holy Feather Sect

___________

“He actually survived?”

Yuan Chong exclaimed in his heart.

After all, there were nearly 30 experts above the rank three True Saint Realm, and there was also Shen Si, a genuine rank five True Saint. Facing so many experts alone…under normal circumstances, even a peak rank four True Saint could not survive.

But now, Jian Wushuang could use the messaging token to send a message to him. Obviously, he was alive and well.

“Little brother Heavenly Sword Marquis said that he has already lost Four God and asked where we are now. He will come and meet us,” Yuan Chong said.

“Tell him the location,” Prince Qing said.

Yuan Chong nodded and immediately sent a message back.

Then, Prince Qing and Yuan Chong quietly waited here.

Not long after they waited, a figure came from afar and soon appeared in front of them.

This figure was Jian Wushuang.

“Prince Qing, Mr. Yuan Chong,” Jian Wushuang greeted them.

“Yes.” Prince Qing nodded slightly in response.

“Little brother Heavenly Sword Marquis, you really survived from Shen Si and the others?” Yuan Chong looked at Jian Wushuang in amazement.

“I’m good at speed, and my life-saving skills are not bad. In addition, I was lucky enough to escape from them,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“But how did you stall them before?” Yuan Chong could not help asking.

Being good at speed and having strong life-saving skills, it was quite acceptable to be able to survive from Shen Si and the others.

However, Jian Wushuang did not simply run for his life before. He first stopped Shen Si and the others by himself before running for his life.

It was impossible for an ordinary person to stop nearly 30 experts for a period of time and then escape unscathed.

“I was able to stop them because I have a special treasure that can seal time and space for a short period of time. Naturally, I can also trap Shen Si and the others for a period of time,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Is that so?” Yuan Chong raised his eyebrows. He looked at Jian Wushuang, but he could not tell whether Jian Wushuang was lying or not.

“Let’s not talk about this. Your Highness Qing, the Third Prince has sent people to kill you, but I wonder if you plan to go to the Holy Feather Sect next?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, of course.” His Highness Qing nodded without hesitation. “Sixth Brother has been at a disadvantage in the fight with Third Brother. Recently, his situation has been getting worse and worse. Especially just now, when I learned of Third Brother’s secret methods, I became even more determined to go to the Holy Feather Sect. Because only with the support of the Holy Feather Sect can Sixth Brother have hope of defeating Third Brother.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep look at His Highness Qing and nodded slightly. “In that case, let’s not delay. Let’s continue.”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you on the way.” Yuan Chong had become very polite to Jian Wushuang.

The three of them immediately went back to the Holy Feather Sect.

…

In the Magnificent Palace, a cold-looking man in a luxurious golden robe, the Third Prince, was sitting on the throne.

“Four God and the others have all gone missing?” The Third Prince’s expression was obviously not good.

“Yes. Apart from Four God, I have also sent messages to ask about the experts he brought with him. But until now, there has been no reply. I think that they are either in a special space-time and have completely blocked the communication with the outside world, or they are all dead,” A purple-robed middle-aged man said respectfully.

“The information we received before was very accurate. Ah Qing did indeed only bring Yuan Chong and the ten rank three True Saints as personal guards, and Sixth Brother’s people have been under our surveillance the whole time. They didn’t make any movements before. When they knew Ah Qing was attacked, Sixth Brother’s people immediately moved… This can eliminate the possibility that Sixth Brother deliberately set this trap.”

“In that case, what happened to Four God and the others?” The Third Prince tapped his fingers on the armchair and pondered.

After a long while, he raised his head again and said, “Go, send someone to the place where Four God and the others ambushed. We must find out what happened no matter what.”

“Yes.” The purple-robed middle-aged man nodded respectfully and quickly left.

…

Jian Wushuang, Prince Qing, and Yuan Chong continued on their way to the Holy Feather Sect. They did not encounter any trouble along the way.

A few days later, the three of them arrived in front of the Holy Feather Sect.

“Your Highness, that’s the Holy Feather Sect.” Yuan Chong pointed to an ancient sect in front of them.

“Yes.” Prince Qing nodded with a hint of joy in his eyes.

Although the Holy Feather Sect was not one of the three pavilions, nine courtyards, or the twelve divine sects, it was still a famous sect in the First Heaven. It also had a certain level of heritage.

The sect in front of him was rather magnanimous at a glance.

“Let’s go down.”

Prince Qing immediately rushed down the mountain gate. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as he landed in front of the mountain gate, the dozen or so Holy Feather Sect disciples guarding it immediately surrounded him.

“Who are you?” One of the white-robed disciples asked.

“My name is Mu Qing. I am from the Zhen Wu Kingdom. I am here to pay my respects to Elder Qi Chen of your sect,” said Prince Qing.

“Pay my respects to Elder Qi Chen? Do you have Elder Qi Chen’s token?” Asked the white-robed disciple.

“Yes.” Prince Qing immediately took out a token. “Elder Qi Chen gave this to me. He also told me to take this token to the Holy Feather Sect to look for him.”

The white-robed disciple took the token and looked at it briefly. Then he nodded slightly and said, “It is indeed Elder Qi Chen’s token. Wait here. I’ll inform Elder Xin to take you in.”

“Thank you.” Princess Qing thanked him.

Not long after, a thin elder with white hair walked out of the Holy Feather Sect and came to Jian Wushuang and the other two.

“Who has Elder Qi Chen’s token?” The thin elder glanced at Jian Wushuang and the other two.

“It’s me,” Prince Qing said.

“Come in with me,” The thin elder said coldly.

“My lord, these two are my guards. Can they come in with me?” Prince Qing asked.

“Yes, but remember, don’t run around in the sect. Otherwise, if anything happens in the sect, it won’t be good,” the thin elder said in a low voice.

“Of course, we’ll pay attention to it.” Princess Qing nodded quickly.

Immediately, the three followed the thin elder into the Holy Feather Sect.

An extremely grand sect also contained a lot of experts’ auras.

Of course, whether in terms of quantity or quality, the experts in the Holy Feather Sect definitely could not compare to the experts in the Young Divine Sect that Jian Wushuang had stayed in before.

However, many experts in the Young Divine Sect were hidden in the dark, but Jian Wushuang could not sense them.

“Your name is Mu Qing? Is she the princess of the Zhen Wu Kingdom?” The skinny elder who had been leading the way suddenly turned his head and asked.
