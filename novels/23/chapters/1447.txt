Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After Jian Wushuang had parted ways with Su Hong, he found a bar and sat down. At the same time, he sent a message to Hall Master Yuan to inform him that he had already completed the second part of the task.

“Jian Wushuang, I heard that you met an expert on Universe God ranking list, Zhao Han, in your second part of the task? How do you feel?” Hall Master Yuan asked casually.

“The expert on Universe God ranking list was really strong,” Jian Wushuang solemnly said, “According to my power now, I could barely match Zhao Han evenly. If I intend to defeat him, I have to have a breakthrough on my Sword Principle again and create a unique skill of Real God level.”

On Sword Principle unique skill, he had already created the rank three strongest unique skill, Enduring Samsara. Hence, to be stronger, he naturally had to create a Real God unique skill.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, the King of Venomous Worms couldn’t help but mutter, “If it wasn’t because you had to protect Su Hong, you could totally try to keep Zhao Han behind and replace him easily on Universe God ranking list.”

“Er…” Jian Wushuang smiled in reply.

Previously, when Jian Wushuang was fighting against Zhao Han, Myriad Beast Idols counter-charged Zhao Han’s body too vigorously and he wasn’t able to withstand for long. If they were to continue to fight, Jian Wushuang could definitely defeat him or even kill him. However, the victory would depend on his divine power and King of Venomous Worms’ recovery power. As for his real power, he was really slightly weaker than Zhao Han.

“Regardless, you performed well to be able to fight against Zhao Han like that. Considering your ability now, I can be less worried about the third part of the task,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The way Hall Master Yuan spoke made the third part of the task seemed unusual.

“Jian Wushuang, I shall assign you the third part of your task, also the last part. Listen carefully,” Hall Master said.

Jian Wushuang listened with full attention.

“The ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, which are outside of the boundless void, in-between Holy Kingdom of Green Thunder and Holy Kingdom of Illusionary Sea. There is a huge piece of land. This land is where the Sky Sword Mountain is located!”

“Sky Sword Mountain is an extremely strong force in Eternal Chaotic World. Although they aren’t within the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, the overall power they contain isn’t ordinary. Even compared to us Lineage of Star, they aren’t that far off.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked when he heard that.

A force that wasn’t much weaker the Lineage of Star was definitely at the top in Eternal Chaotic World.

“Back when I followed King Luo Zhen to wander around in the Eternal Chaotic World, I’ve heard of Sky Sword Mountain. The owner of Sky Sword Mountain is extremely hard to deal with,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard.

Hall Master Yuan continued, “Sky Sword Mountain has many experts and also many Real Gods. Besides, Sky Sword Mountain has a total of one hundred and eight white deacons. These white deacons are all Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. Among them, there is Universe God Mo Yan. He once joined forces with a bunch of Universe God in Purple Moon Sanctuary to kill one of the disciples of Lineage of Star. Your task is to head over to Sky Sword Mountain and find an opportunity to kill Universe God Mo Yan.”

“Head to Sky Sword Mountain to kill Universe God Mo Yan. He’s the only target?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, just killing him will do,” Hall Master Yuan replied.

“How strong is Universe God Mo Yan? Was he on the Universe God ranking list or close to having fighting power like one on Universe God ranking list?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“No, he isn’t strong. He’s just an ordinary Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows when he heard Hall Master Yuan’s reply.

Only to kill an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven, the task seemed quite easy.

But it was the final part of the task?

“Jian Wushuang, although Universe God Mo Yan wasn’t strong, he is from Sky Sword Mountain, after all. Plus, he is very cunning. He has been staying in Sky Sword Mountain all these years and he has never left. You have to kill him in Sky Sword Mountain if you were to kill him, under the watch of many experts in Sky Sword Mountain. If you make any careless mistakes, you’ll be chased after by the experts in Sky Sword Mountain, even if you kill him. In turn, you might lose your life!” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Is that right?” Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

He knew that killing Universe God Mo Yan was an easy task. The crucial part of the task was that he had to escape from Sky Sword Mountain after he had killed him or he wasn’t discovered by anyone after he killed Universe God Mo Yan. Hence, the difficulty of the task instantly became a few times higher. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“The reward for the third part of the task is for you to stay in Real God Hall for two months and, on top of that, you’ll be rewarded with a Chaos Unique Treasure of Real God level!” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang immediately beamed with joy.

It was unnecessary to talk about Real God Hall. For the second part of the task, he was only allowed to be in Real God Hall for a month’s time.

However, upon completion of the third part of the task, he could stay for two months.

“As for the Chaos Unique Treasure of Real God level…”

In Eternal Chaotic World, the treasures were segregated into Chaos Divine Weapon, Chaos Unique Treasure and Chaos Divine Treasure.

Among Chaos Unique Treasure, there was a difference between Universe God and Real God levels.

The name itself revealed that Chaos Unique Treasure of Universe God level was for Universe God while Chaos Unique Treasure of Real God level was for Real God.

For instance, among the treasures that Jian Wushuang had, Blaze Quicksand Gourd could only be considered a higher class Chaos Unique Treasure of Universe God level.

Blood Mountain Sword was just an embryo sword. By then it had already merged with the strongest unique skill in the third Heaven that Jian Wushuang created. The eruption of its power could be compared favorably with the top-notch Chaos Unique Treasure of Universe God level.

Blood-killing Plate Armor could also be considered as a top-notch Chaos Unique Treasure of Universe God level.

As for Real God level, Jian Wushuang really didn’t have any.

He possessed Mountain River Map which was a Chaos Divine Treasure. It was a pity that, due to its high level, Jian Wushuang couldn’t give full play to its power. He reckoned that he could only use the treasure after he became a Real God.

Hence, if he were to obtain Chaos Unique Treasure of Real God level at such a critical point, it would definitely be useful to Jian Wushuang.

“Although the third part of the task is very dangerous, the reward is generous,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Opportunity and danger co-existed.

“Jian Wushuang, let me remind you that the third part of the task is not ordinary. You might lose your life if you make any careless mistake. Hence, before you launch an attack to kill Universe God Mo Yan, be well prepared. Keep an escape route open. If you aren’t well prepared, don’t act hastily,” Hall Master Yuan exhorted.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“Besides, if you were to be in life-threatening situation, tell them your identity as a disciple of Star Palace directly. You might stand a chance,” Hall Master Yuan said again.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes contracted, and then he nodded.

“I sent you the location of Sky Sword Mountain. Go ahead.”

Hall Master Yuan cut off their communication.

Jian Wushuang departed shortly after.
