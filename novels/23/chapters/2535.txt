Chapter 2536: Selecting Blood Gladiator

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Ladies and gentlemen!”

The purple-clad middle-aged man’s voice resonated in the entire gladiatorial area with the help of his divine power and completely overpowered those noises from the crowd.

The arena quickly quieted down.

The purple-clad middle-aged man cleared his throat and said with a rather excited voice, “Dear guests, we have just been paid a visit by a certain Ultimate God called Sir Jian Yi. He placed a bet of five thousand Primordial Stones and wishes to challenge the arena’s craziest and most unique Blood Gladiator!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As soon as those words were spoken, the quiet arena was suddenly filled with waves of roars from the audience.

All the audiences in the arena stood up and shouted.

“Blood Gladiators, someone actually wants to challenge the Blood Gladiators!”

“This is so crazy! A supposedly respectable Ultimate God actually wants to challenge Blood Gladiators?”

The passion of more than a hundred thousand audiences in the arena had completely lit up.

“Is it starting soon?”

Xiao Tiexin casually sat in an audience’s seat with a faint smile.

“Ladies and gentlemen, let’s invite Mr. Jian Yi to enter the arena,” said the purple-clad middle-aged man passionately.

As soon as his voice faded, Jian Wushuang moved with a quick sway and swiftly appeared in the middle of the battlefield after being led to one side of the arena.

His appearance caused the audiences’ gazes locking on him. The more than a hundred thousand pairs of eyes stared right at him.

“He’s that Jian Yi?”

“He seems very young!”

“Tsk tsk, such a handsome young man. I like...”

“Hmph, don’t be deceived by his young look. He’s a true Ultimate God expert. God knows how many years he has been cultivating. He could be an old monster.’

“I hear he needs to win five consecutive games when challenging Blood Gladiators. Moreover, all of his opponents are selected by the arena making the chances of him succeeding very low unless he’s an extremely terrifying genius who could fight against higher realm opponents.”

“Indeed, I’ve been living in the Northern Darkstar Continent for so many years and heard quite a few Blood Gladiator Challenges. It’s already very impressive if there’s even a one-in-ten challenge that succeeded. Furthermore, the one who succeeded is only a Second-Class Divine Demon. It’s exactly because of his low cultivation level which made it easier for him to challenge those of a higher realm. That’s how he succeeded. However, this guy is an Ultimate God after all...”

“Hehe, five thousand Primordial Stones is the highest betting limit in this arena, that’s a huge amount. If he succeeded in the challenge, doesn’t that mean he’ll bring home a hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones? How could this arena and its benefactor, the Shi clan let him get away with it? Look at him, he’s definitely gonna die on the battlefield.”

There were all sorts of discussions among the audiences.

Most people were not confident in Jian Wushuang.

It was not only because Jian Wushuang was currently an Ultimate God which made winning all five battles to be extra difficult. The most important matter was his placed bet was too large. The Shi clan whose behind this Gladiatorial Arena would find every way to kill or make him stay. Otherwise... 160,000 Primordial Stones were not a financial burden the Shi clan was willing to bear.

Xiao Tiexin was sitting in a corridor and sneering at all the argy-bargy around her.

‘These people have no idea how terrifying Jian Yi’s abilities are. He’s someone who continuously topples three Dark Thunder Territory’s prefectures and slaying High-Level Ultimate Gods by himself. Even though the Shi clan is one of Northern Darkstar Continent’s top-tier clans, they would not be able to find another primary level Ultimate God who could withstand Mr. Jian Yi despite having controlling rights to everything!”

Xiao Tiexin was absolutely confident about Jian Wushuang.

That confidence came from her personally observing Jian Wushuang’s abilities.

In the battlefield’s center, the purple-clad middle-aged man spoke again, “Dear guests, let’s welcome Mr. Jian Yi’s first battle, His opponent is...Mr. Mo Xing!!!”

A muscular figure violently glided over and landed on the ground in the middle of the battlefield.

He was a two-meter-tall middle-aged burly man. The man’s face was covered in a beard as his vicious aura radiated through the heavens like a fierce living beast. As he appeared, the ground under his feet cracked from being unable to bear his weight.

The audience once again broke into an uproar upon seeing him.

“It’s Mo Xing, Sir Mo Xing!”

“Good god, this is only the first battle and they already sent Sir Mo Xing!”

“This Mo Xing has fought head-to-head with four Primary-Level Ultimate Gods in this arena previously and won all of them! He’s definitely incredibly strong among the Primary-Level Ultimate Gods.”

A lot of people began to pity Jian Wushuang.

His opponent was already so strong in the first round and they would only get stronger in the four forthcoming games.

“Let’s not waste any more time. The first battle of the Blood Gladiator challenge will now begin!” The purple-clad middle-aged man announced before going away, leaving Jian Wushuang and Mo Xing on the battlefield.

The audience began to get agitated.

Numerous audiences began screaming with some calling Mo Xing’s name while others called out Jian Yi.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and Mo Xing stared at each other from a distance.

Mo Xing sneered, “Kid, you got some guts challenging the Blood Gladiators.”

“Show me what you got.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was indifferent.

“Hmph!”

Mo Xing did not waste another word and swept out a horrifying vicious aura from his body. He already looked like a fierce beast and was even more beast-like when his figure turned into an exotic beast halfway through gliding toward Jian Wushuang and suddenly appeared right before and pounced at him.

His right hand turned into a claw equipped with sharp nails which reflected cold lights.

Slash!

The claw swung.

It produced a noise that made both of them shudder as though space was being slashed open.

The sharp claw went right through Jian Wushuang’s body like a light beam but did not make contact with anything substantial.

“What?” Mo Xing was stunned and felt a cold aura immediately come from his side.

Mo Xing suddenly understood what was going on and instantly waved his claws to protect himself.

Clank! Clank! Clank!

Three clashing sounds were heard.

Mo Xing was being thrown off his feet with the first two clashes while the last clash caused by Jian Wushuang’s sword hit against Mo Xing’s body armor.

Mo Xing’s face turned red with a trace of blood flowing out of his mouth as he was already standing on the battlefield’s edge.
