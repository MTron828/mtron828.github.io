Chapter 2368: The Special Outer Disciple

“The Space-Time Law insights are of immense help to me, I should study it in detail!”

“Other than that, since there are Space-Time Law insights at the Narcissus Mansion, there probably are also Transmigration Law insights. I ought to search thoroughly.”

Jian Wushuang immediately started a detailed search on the fourth floor.

After searching for a full hour, he only found what he was looking for.

“A document on Space-Time Law insights and another one for Transmigration Law. These two should be enough for me to study for some time, I’ll pick these.”

Jian Wushuang did not continue his search nor did he rush to the fifth floor either. On the contrary, he held the two jade slips and directly headed downstairs.

It did not take long for Jian Wushuang to go back to the lady in red.

“I choose these two insights.” Jian Wushuang passed her the pair of jade slips.

The lady in red took a glance at them, nodded slightly, and soon after passed him the copies.

“Thank you.”

Jian Wushuang thanked her and left.

Back at the Outer Court, he started studying both jade slips.

However, he did not realize that there was a major disturbance at the Outer Court because of him.

“Did you hear? That outer disciple from Outer Court actually holds an Elder’s Token!”

“An Elder’s Token? How is that possible? Isn’t it true that only a member of the Circle of Elders could possess an Elder’s Token? They’re usually very protective of it as well and never easily pass it to others. A lot of outstanding core disciples couldn’t even get one, how could an outer disciple possess it?”

“The news is true though. That Elder’s Token is given by Elder Wujian himself. Not only that, Elder Wujian even instructed the Elixir Court and the Supply Storage to give him a lot more resources than any core disciples.”

“How could an outer disciple get a lot more resources than a core disciple?”

“Isn’t... Isn’t this favoritism?”

“Who knows? There are rumors going around saying that it’s very possible this outer disciple has some special relationship with Elder Wujian. There were even a number of people saying he was the Elder’s illegitimate son.”

“Oh yeah, what’s his name?”

“I think it’s Jian Wushuang!!”

...

The entire Outer Court was boiling with controversy.

Nobody could hide the fact that Jian Wushuang held an Elder’s Token and received much more monthly elixirs and resources than most core disciples. Not only the Outer Court, even core disciples in the Inner Court had heard about it.

Of course, that had sparked displeasure among many people.

One must have realized the treatment Jian Wushuang had received was a lot more luxurious than most core disciples despite him being only an outer disciple.

That was also the reason Jian Wushuang’s identity as an outer disciple on Narcissus Island had become somewhat curious and extremely special.

In the courtyard.

Jian Wushuang was holding the Space-Time Law insights jade slip, browsing, and studying it at will.

“Junior Brother Wushuang.”

A voice spoke as a stern-looking man with a battle blade on his back slowly walked over.

That man was none other than Yin Long, who lived close to Jian Wushuang’s courtyard.

“Senior Brother Yin Long.” Jian Wushuang smiled and stood up.

“The rumors are running wild out there, but you’re still quite relaxed here.” Yin Long smiled.

Jian Wushuang had also heard of various rumors in the Outer Court and smiled helplessly. “It’s their mouths, I can’t stop what they want to say.”

Yin Long glanced over. “True enough, but you probably should take action so that they would shut up. The Selection will begin three months later, you can take part in it. That would be your chance to show your true abilities to the naysayers.”

“The Selection at the Outer Court?” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly as he had heard Yin Long mention it before.

The status and treatment difference between outer disciples and core disciples were too big.

As such it initiated the desires of outer disciples wanting to become core disciples and the opportunity to do so was the Selection at the Outer Court.

Therefore, the Selection was of utmost importance to a lot of outer disciples.

One good example was Yin Long, who was standing before him.

“Forget it, I’m still far from that level. Even if I took part in the Selection, I would only be the butt of everyone’s joke,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Junior Brother, you have no plans to take part at all?” Yin Long was surprised.

What he did not know was that if Jian Wushuang had wanted to become a core disciple, he would have become one much earlier without needing to go through the trouble of partaking in the Selection. Hence naturally, he did not feel like attending.

“I’m truly not so interested in the Selection. On the other hand, looks like you’ve set your mind to be selected this time, Senior Brother?” Jian Wushuang looked intriguingly at Yin Long.

Yin Long did not deny. “Correct. Three years ago, I had wanted very much to be selected as a core disciple. However, my ability wasn’t up to par. In the past three years, I gave everything to raise my skills and finally reached the current level. Therefore, I must become the winner in the upcoming Selection!”

Yin Long clenched his hands tightly together and his eyes were burning with hope.

For a short while, Jian Wushuang could see that Yin Long really had strong yearnings to become a core disciple of Narcissus Island.

“In the past few days since I arrived at the Outer Court, I’ve already heard that you’re the strongest among all the outer disciples. Looks like you will be chosen this time around, just as you wish.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Nothing is absolute, but I am a lot more confident this time compared with last time.”

Yin Long’s face was filled with confidence.

“Junior Brother, do carry on with your practice. I shouldn’t disturb you further. As long as you do what your heart tells you, you shouldn’t worry about the rumors in the Outer Court.” Yin Long encouraged him before leaving.

Jian Wushuang had a smile on his face while watching Yin Long leaving.

He could not deny that he had a rather good impression towards Yin Long. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

First of all, Yin Long had never acted pretentiously towards any fellow Outer Court Disciples—he was a very mild-mannered person.

Secondly, he was very hardworking!

He possessed mediocre talent but worked extra hard to stand out among all the outer disciples. His blade technique was the result of countless tests and constant training.

Jian Wushuang really appreciated a person like that.

“The Selection in three months?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head then continued his studies on the content in the jade slips.
