Chapter 1276: Kill on the Spot!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Weng!”

A stunning sword light flashed through the void and pierced through Zhuge Qiu’s head without meeting any resistance.

A horrified look remained on Zhuge Qiu face, but his aura began to die away.

There was a dead silence on Leopard-print Island.

Everyone’s expressions were different at the moment.

“What happened just now?”

“Although Jian Wushuang’s move was very fast, a Universe God at the Peak of the First Heaven should have been able to block it.”

“Mr. Zhuge was killed so simply?”

Everyone was amazed.

Zhuge Qiu died very suddenly and simply.

Jian Wushuang, who was drawing his sword back, was the only one who was not surprised by it.

“There is no doubt that the Chant of Disturbance is my strongest Killing Move so far. Though it’s not as powerful as Nirvana, it’s so fast that few can dodge it,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a smile. .

He created the Chant of Disturbance in the secret chamber on the island that was left by Yan Jiu.

The Soul Attack behind the move was what really did the killing.

As he had lit up his Soul Fire and his Soul Power was extremely superior, the Soul Attack he launched was much more powerful than his consciousness attack. Moreover, he also gained the second part of the Univeral Dao Scripture from his master, which helped him improve his Soul Power.

He had been enhancing this power during all those years of cultivating.

Before he entered that secret chamber, his Soul Power had been extremely pure and powerful. What he needed at that time was a skill to apply that power.

Although he could try to apply that power to the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, which he had learned from the Ancient God Clan, and the Spell of Disturbance, which he had created himself, neither skills could fully exert that power. Therefore, the Chant of Disturbance was created at the right moment.

This skill was a perfect Soul Attack!

As a result, Jian Wushuang could kill the powerful Zhuge Qiu in a single strike.

Zhuge Qiu had failed to ward off the Soul Attack behind that move and, therefore, was caught by a transient confusion. That was when Jian Wushuang had managed to kill him.

“Soul Power is far superior to consciousness attack. Few advanced Universe Gods in the First Heaven can ward off the Chant of Disturbance you created—even those at the peak of the First Heaven might accidentally get killed by that move.” Gu King’s voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang replied with a smile, “Among all my skills, only by relying on this move could I kill Zhuge Qiu. Without it, even though I have the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, I still couldn’t defeat him.” .

After this battle, he gained a clear understanding of his own strength.

He was an Inverse Cultivator, as well as a four-star Ancient God. If he exerted all his power, he could battle an elementary Universe God of the First Heaven. If the power of the second level of the Blood-killing Plate Armor was added to that, he could battle an advanced Universe God in that realm.

The unique skills he created were at advanced Level One. Adding all of that together, he was as powerful as an advanced Universe God of the First Heaven.

However, with the Blaze Quicksand, he had made it a close battle with Zhuge Qiu, and by relying on the Chant of Disturbance, he had managed to kill him.

“In view of my current power, I have no need to fear the Universe Gods beneath the peak of the First Heaven, but if I encounter an expert at the peak of the First Heaven, such as Universe God Chen, I’ll have to run or display the Star-river Secret Skill to battle him,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself. .

His killing of Zhuge Qiu with one strike turned the tide of the battle on the island.

The hearts of Universe God Wu and Universe God Lei Ming beat wildly as they watched Zhuge Qiu get killed.

“Even Mr. Zhuge was killed by Jian Wushuang. It will be so easy for him to kill us.” Universe God Wu looked horrified.

“Let’s leave here right now!”

The two Universe Gods of the Xiu State started running desperately. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing that their leaders began escaping, the remaining experts of the Xiu State followed the two without thinking.

With so many experts retreating from the battlefield, the Xiu State kept losing its ground. For that, the experts of Scarlet Island did not even bother chasing after them.

Jian Wushuang stood watching the two Universe Gods of the Xiu State run away.

Universe God Qian Luan came over to him.

“Jian Wushuang.”

She looked at him, and her eyes betrayed her complicated feelings.

There were surpriseand horror, but even more disbelief in them.

She had been an expert in the Dayu Region for so long that she had heard of and met many great geniuses.

However, she had never heard of any Universe Master who could kill a Universe God at the peak of the First Heaven, who was even more powerful than her.

“Universe God Qian Luan, let’s go down to check the casualties on our side.” Jian Wushuang looked at Universe God Qian Luan with a smile while speaking.

“Umm… okay.” Universe God Qian Luan nodded slightly.

The battle between Scarlet Island and the Xiu State did not last long, therefore, not many from either side had died in the battle.

In merely a moment, Universe God Qian Luan had settled everything down.

After that, she found Jian Wushuang again, and this time, she looked calmer.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll report everything that has happened today to the commander, including the grudge between you and the Holy Prefecture, as well as that you’ve killed Zhuge Qiu,” she said. .

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. Since he had chosen to go all out to fight, he naturally did not want to hide his power anymore.

“Don’t worry about the grudge between you and the Holy Prefecture. You’re the seventh Divine General of our Scarlet Island, so we will try our best to protect you. I promise you.” Universe God Qian Luan spoke again.

“Thanks.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Both Scarlet Island and the Holy Prefecture were the overlords of the Dayu Region and did not fear each other. The former was not worried about offending the later.

If Scarlet Island handed Jian Wushuang over to the Holy Prefecture, it would disappoint many of Scarlet Island’s experts.

No one would do such a stupid thing.

Universe God Qian Luan said, “Let’s wait for the results.” .
