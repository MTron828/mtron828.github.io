Chapter 977: Fighting Master Ku

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This Master Ku is fast AND powerful,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a frown after exchanging a blow with Master Ku.

Master Ku looked coldly at Jian Wushuang and launched the second round of attack with all his strength.

“Wait, this is really the worst situation!”?Jian Wushuang cringed, as he suddenly thought of something.

“Xue Lingtian told me that Master Ku’s forte is close combat. Even my Senior Brother finds it hard to resist his offensive ability during a close combat. However, now he’s very close to me.”

“Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!”

Master Ku cast many rays of intense Blade Light toward Jian Wushuang.

Seeing an overwhelming amount of Blade Light flew toward him at an amazing speed, Jian Wushuang nearly got lost in astonishment,?“What, What should I do?”

He hurriedly brandished his Blood Mountain Sword to fend off the Blade Light.

“This guy’s offensive ability is shockingly strong!”?Jian Wushuang thought, as he groaned because of physical exhaustion.

After passing the Heaven Level Test, which was a test of the Ancient God Clan, Jian Wushuang’s offensive ability was significantly improved. Besides, he was also very good at close combat.

Nevertheless, Master Ku still outshone him in this aspect.

With the help of his Blood-killing Plate Armor, Jian Wushuang now had an offensive power that was nearly as strong as that of Master Ku. Unfortunately, Master Ku had already gotten close to him and suppressed him, giving him no breathing space.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang grunted suddenly, a murderous look flickered within his eyes. The next moment, 72 rays of light, which were light purple in color, flew out of his Interspatial Ring.

They quickly formed a purple lightsaber in the void beside Jian Wushuang.

“Nine-heaven Sword Formation: Second Formation!

“Go!” shouted Jian Wushuang.

He managed to summon his sword formation while barely resisting Master Ku’s attacks. His purple lightsaber swiftly pierced through the Void and dashed toward Master Ku.

“Nine-heaven Sword Formation?” said Master Ku.

He recognized the Formation instantly, but he just laughed it off. He moved in an incredible way to avoid the lightsaber effortlessly.

“You avoided it? Nice move,” Jian Wushuang said with 36 rays of light around him now.

“Nine-heaven Sword Formation: First Formation!”

Although the first formation was not as fast and powerful as the second one, Jian Wushuang still decided to use it to launch the second round of attacks. Compared to the second formation which he has just mastered and was unable to control very well, he was more familiar with this first formation.

Given this, it would be much easier for him to fight with this formation.

The sword formation moved swiftly through the void under the guidance of Jian Wushuang, and in the blink of an eye, it approached Master Ku.

“Hmm. That’s interesting,” said Master Ku.

He fixed his eyes upon the sword formation and then slashed it with just one of his sabers.

The next moment, the sword formation shattered.

In the meantime, Master Ku swung the other saber toward Jian Wushuang.

“Mind-controlling Secret Skill!” said Jian Wushuang, his eyes suddenly brightened.

A magical force came at Master Ku.

Master Ku paused for a moment, and then continued to swing his saber toward Jian Wushuang. Obviously, this Mind-controlling Secret Skill had little effect on him.

“Ancient God Finger, Barrier-breaking!” Jian Wushuang said through gritted teeth.

Realizing that he could never defeat Master Ku in close combat, he intended to force him to retreat. He channelled all his Ancient God Power into his index finger and launched attack.

As heaven and earth shook, a giant golden finger pressed toward Master Ku.

Master Ku channelled his power into the saber in his right hand and lifted it up. When it was ready, he swung it toward the finger.

The Blade Light cut the giant golden finger in half, and the Ancient God Power contained in the finger abruptly spread out, causing an impact which successfully compelled Master Ku to retreat.

Now there were several steps away from each other.

Jian Wushuang looked at Master Ku, not fully recovered from the shock. The sword formation consisting of 36 one-meter swords was floating beside him.

“Senior Brother is right, Master Ku is indeed good at close combat,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Master Ku stared back at Jian nonchalantly and said, “You’re still at the Eternal Realm but you fought pretty well. You’re really something. No wonder they say you’re one of the Exceptional Geniuses of this world. Now I see why you were able to kill Gu Ji.”

“Thanks. Now I’ve seen with my own eyes what an expert you are at close combat.

“Humph, the Blood Saber told you that. Am I right?” Master Ku asked.

Jian Wushuang nodded without saying a word. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Blood Saber and I never fought each other, but it’s not surprising that he knows some of my moves.” Ku continued, “After all, both of us are Void Temple Masters. But, there’s one thing he doesn’t know about me.”

“Yeah?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“You’ve seen my close combat ability, but you haven’t seen my trump card.”

“Your trump card?”

“Get ready for it! If you survive I’ll give up revenge, but if you get killed you’ll have only yourself to blame,” Master Ku howled.

All the experts of the Three Big Countries and the people in the imperial palace heard what he said and turned their head toward him.

“What was his trump card?”?everyone wondered.

Master Ku looked aloof. He had two sabers but now he was putting one of them inside his Interspatial Ring, his eyes getting colder as he did so.

“Boom...” An earth-shaking Knife Essence arose from Master Ku’s body.

The next moment, he began to move.

“Swosh!” He popped out in front of Jian Wushuang all of a sudden.

It was like teleportation.

In the meantime, a gorgeous Blade Light appeared and fascinated all the people.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were also drawn to the beautiful Light.

Beyong his expectation, he was suddenly engulfed by some kind of strange power.
