_______________

This place was inside the Blood Wave Realm.

At the end of the boundless darkness, the consciousness of blood wave stood there. He could only watch as the boundless darkness around him started to end, and the dark space started to crack, at the same time, the entire Blood Wave Realm also started to collapse crazily.

Even the blood wave palace... The Land of opportunity that countless undying Saints longed for, the complete Heavenly Dao that had formed a stable cycle earlier had lost its past glory. A large number of law energies began to become chaotic, it became violent. Gradually, the complete Heavenly Dao cycle shattered. This also meant that the final opportunity within the Blood Wave Realm had vanished.

The entire Blood Wave Realm was about to be completely destroyed.

“The Blood Wave Realm that has existed for so many years is finally about to disappear.” Blood Wave’s consciousness watched everything quietly. His heart was extremely calm, and there was not the slightest ripple. “To be able to find and help a perfect-grade life form, the destruction of the Blood Wave Realm is worth it.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, this power of yours is forcefully bestowed upon you by the Blood Wave Realm. Furthermore, this power is ultimately not yours. Therefore, while you are controlling this power, this power is also continuously draining. Before long, it will be completely exhausted. Therefore, you have to seize this opportunity. I have already done my best to help you. As for whether you can escape this crisis, it is up to you!”

“Kid, remember this. You’re already a member of the Life Palace. If you’re strong enough, you must go to the deepest part of the universe. You must go to the Life Palace. There’s a special life form like you that must complete the mission!”

“Remember this!”

While Blood Wave was talking, his body was fading away. After he finished speaking, his body completely disappeared.

At this moment, the Blood Wave Realm was completely destroyed. From then on, there would no longer be an opportunity like the Blood Wave Realm in the Divine Beginning Realm.

...

“Thank you, Elder Blood Wave!”

Jian Wushuang was still standing on the battlefield. He had received Blood Wave’s final message and was filled with gratitude. Then, he raised his head and looked around the battlefield. Because of the explosion of his sword just now...everyone was shocked. The experts from both sides, who had been standing together again, were now separated again.

Everyone’s eyes were on him. The experts from the three Saint Realms, the Sorceror God Sect, and the Nine-tailed Clan all wanted to kill him, but no one dared to attack him again because Jian Wushuang’s sword just now...had shocked everyone.

No one knew whether Jian Wushuang could use that attack again.

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed, and he looked at the battlefield next to him.

It was the battle between Elder Dark Bone and Flame Saint Master.

Flame Saint Master was a real master of the Saint Realm. Although Elder Dark Bone was very old, powerful, and had many skills, he was still far from a real master of the Saint Realm, he only relied on his special skills to barely tangle with Flame Saint Master.

But now, he was in a very dangerous situation. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang rushed into the battlefield in a flash and appeared beside Elder Dark Bone.

“Elder Dark Bone, you go down and recover. Leave Flame Saint Master to me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Leave him to you?” Elder Dark Bone frowned and looked at Jian Wushuang.

He had noticed that Jian Wushuang had killed four divine flame guards and Sky Nether Master with one sword strike while he was fighting with the Flame Saint Master. Moreover, he was standing beside Jian Wushuang now, he could feel the shocking aura from Jian Wushuang and nodded immediately. “Okay, be careful!”

With that, Elder Dark Bone retreated to the side.

In the void, Jian Wushuang and Flame Saint Master were separated by a distance. Yaoyao was holding her sword.

Jian Wushuang held his sword with one hand. The aura from his body was far superior to that of a Principles Master.

As for Flame Saint Master, he was completely immersed in the sea of flames. He was the absolute flame dominator. His pupils contracted and released an astonishing killing intent

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, how did you get this power?” The Flame Saint Master stared at Jian Wushuang. He did not believe that this power belonged to Jian Wushuang, even though he was a perfect-grade life-form, he was someone who even feared the power of the will of heaven and had to be killed. However, no matter how heaven-defying he was, he could not possess such tyrannical power at the level of a saint.

“Can you guess?” Jian Wushuang gave a strange smile.

“Humph, in the Divine Beginning Realm, there are no more than five people who can possess such power. However, even if they have such power, they can’t pour it into your body and let you control it. The people who can do this must be beyond the scope of the Divine Beginning Realm!”

“You just came out of the Blood Wave Realm, and you got a great opportunity in the Blood Wave Realm. Your strength has improved greatly, and you can fight against an expert of the third realm of the void with the Immortal Saint Realm. Therefore, you must have had other opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm. Your power must be related to the Blood Wave Realm!”

“Yes!” Flame Saint Master said in a deep voice.

Flame Saint Master was indeed very prepared. He directly guessed that Jian Wushuang’s power was related to the Blood Wave Realm.

Upon hearing Flame Saint Master’s words, the surrounding experts who were watching the battle were all stunned.

“Blood Wave Realm?”

“Did Heavenly Sword Marquis encounter other opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm?”

“It’s very possible. Otherwise, how could he become so powerful after coming out of the Blood Wave Realm? He is clearly an Immortal Saint, but he can actually fight against a Principles Master of the three void realms. Even if he had great ability beyond his realm, it’s impossible for him to be so powerful.”

“Tsk, tsk. This Heavenly Sword Marquis is really blessed. I wonder what he has gained in the Blood Wave Realm.”

Voices of discussion spread throughout the void.

Jian Wushuang, however, smiled faintly, “Flame Saint Master, you’re indeed very smart, but it’s useless. I Won’t waste any more words with you. I’ve long known that you three masters of the Saint Realm are extremely powerful. Today, I’d like to experience it.”

“Just you?” Flame Saint Master looked down at Jian Wushuang.

“Just me.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but his eyes became cold.

“Senior Blood Wave is right. Although I have extremely powerful strength now, it’s too much for my divine body. It’s also constantly flowing. Just when I used that sword move, I felt the divine power in my body surging, as if it was going to explode completely. I can’t hold on for long in my current state. Before the power in my body disappears, I must at least find out how big the gap is between me and the three masters of the Saint Realm!”
