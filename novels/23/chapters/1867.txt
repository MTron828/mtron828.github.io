Chapter 1868: Calm

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, they recorded super experts on the peak of the universe in Eternal Chaotic World.

For the experts on the list, any increase of ranking would require convincing battle achievement. It was extremely difficult.

But then, Jian Wushuang had risen from the thirtieth place to the twenty-second place directly. He increased a total of eight rankings in an instant.

Most interestingly, the original twenty-second place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list had been Emperor God Tian Ling from Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Jian Wushuang shared great resentment with Soaring Heaven King Palace but he had never fought with Emperor God Tian Ling. Then, Jian Wushuang had raised his ranking directly while Emperor God Tian Ling had fallen to the twenty-third place.

Of course, regarding Jian Wushuang’s current ranking, the experts in Sanctuary Alliance were doubtful.

Some thought that Jian Wushuang had relied on his four Hong Jun Golden Sword to suppress Palace Master Wu Luo in the twenty-fifth place miserably and his power should be above Emperor God Tian Ling’s.

But there were some who thought although Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Sword was strong, Emperor God Tian Ling could withstand it directly. Once the four Hong Jun Golden Swords failed to create great advantage for Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Tian Ling could totally defeat him.

Both parties had their reasoning but no one could clearly determine who was stronger.

Time flew past. In the blink of an eye, two hundred and eighty years had passed.

In the two hundred and eighty years, Eternal Chaotic World was calm.

The forces and experts who were preparing to pound at Lineage of Star had reined themselves in and no one dared to act hastily.

The victory of Lineage of Star in the fight with Abysmal Palace had served as a deterrent.

Even Abysmal Palace who was in the top three major forces in Sanctuary Alliance were defeated by Lineage of Star and suffered great losses. Which other major forces in Sanctuary Alliance had the power and confidence to fight Lineage of Star alone?

As for teaming up… The forces and experts considered it before. However, the biggest problem still lay there, which was if the Master of Star Palace had really died!

As long as the answer was uncertain, the forces and experts wouldn’t dare to join forces.

Because once they united to attack Lineage of Star, it would be a decisive battle. By then, if the Master of Star Palace wasn’t dead and they started to massacre in madness, the forces and experts would be doomed.

During the calm times, Lineage of Star had received an extremely precious chance to gasp for air.

In the hall, Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun gathered together. As for Emperor God Jiu Yin… Emperor God Jiu Yin was a guest elder after all. Lineage of Star wouldn’t restrict him too much and it was temporarily unsuitable for Emperor God Jiu Yin to know the secret in Lineage of Star.

“Hall Master Yuan, how did the recruitment go?” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Yuan.

“Not bad. Currently, there are four Almighties that made a decision and they are willing to be guest elders in Lineage of Star. Once Lineage of Star is in danger, they will lend a helping hand. Among the four Almighties, there are three Sir Gods and one Emperor God, Emperor God Xuan Wu!” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Emperor God Xuan Wu?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew of Emperor God Xuan Wu. Among Emperor God experts in Eternal Chaotic World, his power could be considered at the bottom. In terms of attack power, he was slightly stronger than an ordinary Sir God. However, he was best at defense power. Not only was his defense power strong, he also knew many kinds of defense skills, secret skills and powers.

“Although Emperor God Xuan Wu’s power is ordinary, he is truly an Emperor God expert after all. To Lineage of Star, he is also a helping hand,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Not bad,” Hall Master Yuan nodded and he smiled. “Actually, Emperor God Xuan Wu is actually not weak, especially his defense power and body protection power. He is only not too good in strength and close combat skill.”

“He knew that too. Hence, when he was wandering in the Second Lair and the Third Lair, and also when he was wandering in Ancient Mystery Land, he took the risk to wander in dangerous places. His goal was to get a Chaotic Divine Treasure level divine weapon that suited him. However, he wasn’t very lucky and he didn’t get anything.”

“Then, Lineage of Star offered to give him a suitable Chaotic Divine Treasure level attack divine weapon and that made him really happy. He even said on the spot that the divine weapon itself was worth his life.”

“Then, Emperor God Xuan Wu already came out from Ancient Mystery Land. I reckon he will arrive at Lineage of Star in no time.”

“Mm, Emperor God Xuan Wu and the other three Sir Gods who agreed to become guest elders, take good care of them. You can pass them the agreed Chaotic divine weapon first but they have to guarantee that they will lend a helping hand when Lineage of Star is in danger. Otherwise… If take advantage of Lineage of Star but run away during crucial times, that’s not something we want,” Jian Wushuang exhorted.

“Don’t worry. These experts that I have invited, their reputation are not bad. As they agreed, they shouldn’t go back on their words. Plus, when I give them their Chaotic Divine Treasure, I will, of course, set some restrictions,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“That’d be best.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then he looked around, “In recent years, the forces and experts in Sanctuary Alliance were quite calm. It seems that the fight with Abysmal Palace took great effect. Now, unless Ancient Mystery Land closes and they confirm that the Master of Star Palace has passed away, no one will dare to take action against Lineage of Star. Hence, I will prepare to head to Emperor Sword Sect now.”

“Before I go, I will leave all Dao soldiers behind as well. Besides, Jian Yi will stay back in Lineage of Star. If, during the time when I cultivate in Emperor Sword Palace, Lineage of Star has any problem, you should be able to deal with it with Jian Yi and the Dao soldiers.

Jian Wushuang knew that one hundred bronze-armored Dao soldiers was an extremely fierce fighting power.

On top of that, Jian Yi’s current power was slightly stronger than himself. With him attending garrison duty personally, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be worried when he cultivated in Emperor Sword Palace.

After delegating tasks, Jian Wushuang headed to Emperor Sword Sect alone. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Emperor Sword Sect wasn’t within Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries but in the vast void near the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

Jian Wushuang departed from Lineage of Star via space wormhole. It only took ten years to reach the void where Emperor Sword Sect was.

“That’s where Emperor Sword Sect is?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void as he looked at the piece of floating land while he revealed a creepy smile.
