Chapter 3419 Naturally Terminated Meridians

“Miss Xiao’er has an inexplicable relationship with the Nine-tailed Clan, one of the four divine clans. If I’m not mistaken, Miss Xiao’er and my relatives in this life should be in the Demon Realm, but…” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

He had the communication token of Miss Xiao’er. He could have sent a message to Miss Xiao’er and asked her to tell him the exact location of his relatives, and then he would go there to meet her. However, Jian Wushuang…did not intend to do so.

It was not because he did not want to see his relatives in this life, but because he still had a lot of doubts about Miss Xiao’er.

Up until now, he still did not know Miss Xiao’er’s specific identity and background did not know what relationship she had with the Nine-tailed Clan, and did not know what her motive was. Even if he were to go over and see Miss Xiao’er…he would probably only be able to learn a little from Miss Xiao’er’s own mouth.

But who could guarantee that what Miss Xiao’er said was true?

Who could guarantee that Miss Xiao’er did not have any intention of scheming against him?

At the very least, Jian Wushuang could not completely trust Miss Xiao’er at the moment. He had always been on guard.

Since he had come to the Third Heaven, he naturally wanted to clear up all these doubts. However, these doubts could not be solely based on Miss Xiao’er’s words. Jian Wushuang had to find a way to clear them up himself.

“Although I know about the power of the will of Heaven, I’m afraid that only the three masters of the Saint Realm will know about my arrival in the Third Heaven. However, no one else should know about it, including Miss Xiao’er. In that case…” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, following that, the muscles on his face began to squirm. In the blink of an eye, his appearance had undergone an earth-shaking change.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what are you doing?” Demon Master Chenhuo could not help asking when he saw the change in Jian Wushuang.

“I don’t intend to expose my identity easily in the Third Heaven,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He was very famous in the Divine Beginning Realm. Moreover, almost all the high-level experts in the Divine Beginning Realm had seen his fierce battle on the Saha Island, so they naturally remembered his appearance. As long as he showed up, he would be easily recognized, of course, he had to disguise himself.

After changing his appearance, Jian Wushuang immediately set off.

He did not dare to use teleportation to go to the Demon Realm. Instead, he slowly moved forward.

Half a day later…

“According to the instructions in the star field, there is a large city not far ahead. The prosperity of this city is among the top five in the entire Bone Flood Domain. Chenhuo, when we pass by the city later, we won’t be in a hurry to continue our journey. Let’s Find a tavern in the city and have a drink first,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Yes,” Demon Master Chenhuo answered, but he suddenly stopped in the void.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang immediately stopped and looked at Demon Master Chenhuo. He found that Demon Master Chenhuo was looking down at his feet with surprise in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang also followed Demon Master Chenhuo’s gaze and immediately saw a naked upper body on a mountain at the bottom, a young man with tanned skin was carrying a huge rock that weighed at least tens of thousands of pounds. He was running rapidly on the mountain.

The young man looked to be only 15 or 16 years old, but his facial features were very firm. His forehead and body were soaked in sweat, and he looked very tired, however, his eyes were unusually sharp and firm. The huge rock weighed tens of thousands of pounds on his body, but he was still running desperately.

Originally, it should have been easy for a cultivator in the Divine Beginning Realm to carry a huge rock weighing tens of thousands of pounds, or even effortless. However, this was also because the cultivator had the divine power backing him up, however, at this moment, there was no divine power fluctuation on the body of the young man who was running wildly with the huge rock on his shoulder.

Yes, there was no divine power fluctuation at all.

Even Jian Wushuang and the perception ability of the Demon Master Chenhuo could not sense any divine power from the body of the young man. This meant that the young man indeed did not have any divine power, he was purely relying on his physical body and his brute strength to run wildly against the giant rock.

It was obvious that he was crazily refining his body!

“That’s not right. He was born in the Divine Beginning Realm and in the Third Heaven, which is a perfect cultivation environment. Logically speaking, no matter how stupid he is, he should be able to easily condense divine power in his body and become a cultivator. But this little guy… how come he doesn’t have any divine power at this age?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“It’s a naturally terminated meridians,” Demon Master Chenhuo suddenly said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Naturally terminated meridians?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked over.

“This is a unique constitution born from heaven and earth. Once this Constitution is formed, all his meridians will be completely blocked. There won’t be any heaven and earth spiritual Qi entering his body. If he can’t even absorb the heaven and earth spiritual Qi, he naturally won’t be able to condense divine power and become a cultivator!” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

“Born from heaven and earth? Isn’t he a born trash?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

“Yes, he is a born trash. However, the reason why his meridians are blocked is not because he is not talented. On the contrary, it is because his talent is too high and he is restricted by heaven and earth. That’s why his meridians are formed,” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

“Another restriction from heaven and earth?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. He had thought that the restrictions of the Heavenly Dao should only be applied to special life forms. He did not expect that there would be some inherent restrictions on some extremely talented people.

“Of course, although the Heavenly Dao has some restrictions on those with high aptitude, the restrictions are still far from being comparable to those of special life forms. Take the naturally terminated meridians as an example. Although they are unable to condense divine power or become cultivators, no matter how hard they try, they are unable to do so.”

“But if one day, by chance, he meets a powerful rule master who is willing to pay a great price to reconstruct your meridians, then his terminated meridians will be completely opened, and he will soar to the sky and become an insufferably proud son of heaven. Moreover, his talent and potential are so great that not many people in the Divine Beginning Realm can compare to him,” said Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Chenhuo, you seem to know a lot about the naturally terminated meridians.” Jian Wushuang looked at Demon Master Chenhuo in surprise.

“Of course I do, because…I used to have naturally terminated meridians too!” Demon Master Chenhuo said seriously.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was surprised to hear this.

Demon Master Chenhuo used to have naturally terminated meridians too?
