: A Month Later

“The perception of the laws, understanding of rules, and so on will be greatly improved?”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang was a little excited.

Most opportunities in the Saint’s Tomb were merely an accumulation of divine power, which was just a matter of time to him. He did not care too much about them.

The nine-step test of the inner area accompanied by the nine great opportunities might sound appealing. However, it came with harsh conditions and there might not be things that Jian Wushuang wanted, so he was not very keen either. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

On the other hand, the Fentian Scroll was a different ball game.

Perception of laws and the understanding of rules were completely different from the accumulation of divine power. They were skills that needed oneself to slowly cultivate. It was heavily dependent on one’s ability and might take up a lot of time.

This Fengtian Scroll could significantly improve the perception of laws and understanding of rules which was an excellent opportunity for any cultivator.

Jian Wushuang was no exception.

“It’s such a great help. No wonder geniuses from various sects try their best to fight for a seat. Unfortunately, only six seats are available every time the tomb is opened. There are so many sects in the Wusha Wilderness and the total number of genius disciples entering the tomb is probably a lot. With so many people competing for six seats, the competition will be extremely tough,” said Jian Wushuang.

Elder Wujian nodded in agreement. “Indeed, it’s tough. Every time the tomb is opened, genius disciples of various sects can gain a lot from it. At the same time, there are a lot of risks hence many genius disciples will also die in the tomb. Their deaths were not only from the crisis they faced in the tomb but also from the six seats’ competition. It was a bloody fight every single time!”

Hence, the Safety Token is particularly important.”

The Safety Token which came from within the Saint’s Tomb could only be used in the tomb itself. Once the cultivator crushes the Safety Token, that person who crushes it will be immediately teleported out from the tomb regardless of the situation. It’s a life-saving tool when facing a life or death situation. Unfortunately, there are only three such Safety Tokens in Narcissus Island. Although I tried my best to get you a place to enter the Saint’s Tomb, I can’t get you a Safety Token.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “I’m grateful that Elder Wujian was able to get me a place. How can I expect more from you? Besides, the Safety Token is of no use to me.”

He was telling the truth. It also came from the confidence of him being a Perfect Chaotic Creature which was not so easy to kill. At the same time, he had cultivated two secret skills—Primordial Void Celestial Body and Exquisite Pagoda. He also had a robust life-saving ability that was not to be taken lightly in addition to his recent breakthrough of Peak Stage Chaotic Realm and cultivated the second stage of Primordial Void Celestial Body, hence very few First-Class Divine Demons were his match.

Under such circumstances, all he had to watch out for in the Saint’s Tomb were the possible dangers and risks within.

The genius disciples from various sects who could enter the Saint’s Tomb were First-Class Divine Demons. Even the most outstanding disciples—Twelve Minor Kings were not his match, hence Jian Wushuang had nothing to worry about.

He probably would not have any use for the Safety Token.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve already told you what I knew. Here’s the detailed information about the Saint’s Tomb. You can read more to find out the remaining bits and pieces.” Elder Wujian handed a jade slip to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it, glanced at it, and nodded slightly.

“Alright, take your time to study it yourself. I’ll make a move.” Elder Wujian left right away.

Jian Wushuang began to browse the detailed information of the Saint’s Tomb given to him.

There was still a month before the Saint’s Tomb opened.

Within the month, not only Narcissus Island but the other sects in the Wusha Wilderness had also begun preparing for conquering the Saint’s Tomb.

A large number of genius disciples were looking forward to entering the tomb.

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Narcissus Island. There were rows of figures standing on a piece of land.

Those people were core disciples nominated to enter the Saint’s Tomb from Narcissus Island. Zhong Yi and Su Tong were the leaders.

Zhong Yi, a young man with a black robe, black hair, and a somewhat evil complexion carried a sword on his back while standing there proudly. The other core disciples around him looked at him in awe.

In terms of strength and power, Zhong Yi was the best among the many disciples of Narcissus Island in this era!

Although he was not listed as one of the Twelve Minor Kings, he was infinitely close to the Twelve Minor Kings in terms of strength and power.

Standing beside Zhong Yi was a fair-skinned girl in a white robe who looked a little weak. The girl had long hair hanging down to her waist and very delicate facial features. She could be called a rare beauty.

Su Tong, the only genius in Narcissus Island that was comparable with Zhong Yi in the era, might be slightly weaker than Zhong Yi in terms of strength and power. However, she had tremendous potential in terms of talent!

“Junior Sister Tong, among the many disciples who are going into the Saint’s Tomb from Narcissus Island this time, you and I are leaders. When we get to the tomb, we have to work together,” said Zhong Yi.

“That’s for sure. I don’t have much experience and I’m not mature in dealing with matters, so it’s best for you to make the decisions when we are in the tomb,” said Su Tong bluntly.

She was aware of her abilities and knew that the tomb was filled with dangers. Her safety was guaranteed with the Safety Token. However, most of the other disciples who went along with them were not given a Safety Token.

“Junior Sister, don’t worry. Although the Saint’s Tomb is dangerous, we should be fine if we are careful.” Zhong Yi smiled.

The other core disciples were also casually chatting with each other.

“Our people are all here, right? Who else is not here?”

“The nine core disciples have arrived. The one that has not arrived in the outer disciple called Jian Wushuang.”

“Outer disciple?”

“Indeed, he is only an outer disciple and merely at the Chaotic Realm. I heard that Elder Wujian used his special quota as an elder to fight for his opportunity to enter the Saint’s Tomb. Many disciples in Narcissus Island were saying that Jian Wushuang has an extraordinary relationship with Elder Wujian.”

“Is that so?”

“Will we be burdened to enter the Saint’s Tomb with someone at the Chaotic Realm?”

“Perhaps, but we have to go along with it. Elder Wujian used his special quota on him and he didn’t violate the rules of Narcissus Island. Even the Lord couldn’t oppose it.”
