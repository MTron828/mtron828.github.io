Chapter 611: Comprehension of World Dao

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The World Prison was composed of World Energy. This power would usually be weak and could be dissolved easily by anyone from Skyscraping Realm.?However, the World Energy after it was formed into this special World Prison using a unique law of combination was too solid to destroy.

“Law? Combination?”

Jian Wushuang wrinkled his brows in deep concentration while swirls of World Energy surged around him. Soon, a palm entirely developed from World Energy stretched out abruptly from the stone wall of the World Prison. With its fingers spread, the giant palm was trying to take hold of Jian Wushuang at an ultra-high speed, as well as with formidable force.

Jian Wushuang was so astounded that he dodged aside hurriedly. As the attacking palm grabbed where he was previously located, a swoosh sounded right away.

“Such immense power!”

Before he could even feel stunned, Jian Wushuang realized that behind him there were three places where World Energy gathered. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Three giant palms soon stretched out in succession, jumping wildly out at him.

Jian Wushuang did not dare to pause, darting forth all over.

Whoosh!?Whoosh!?Whoosh!?Whoosh!

More palms formed entirely by World Energy flew over. Almost everywhere Jian Wushuang went, there was an attacking palm, providing no respite for him.

“This is the compulsion of the World Prison that Emperor Xiao said, isn’t it? This is terrifying as it is too persistent and difficult to elude. How would I have time to painstakingly meditate on the World Dao?” Jian Wushuang frowned, but soon he discovered something.

“The World Energy contained in these giant palms are so powerful and peculiar.

Jian Wushuang dodged through those attacking giant palms while observing them quietly to find out how they were formed. It was a profound application of World Energy.

“World Energy can be used in this way!”

Jian Wushuang immediately was lost in his thoughts.

Outside the World Prison, Emperor Xiao sat on a stone bench in the garden, waiting quietly. In the blink of an eye, two days passed.

“Uhm?”

Emperor Xiao who sat on the stone bench raised his head, glancing up at the World Prison. With a smile appearing on his face, he said, “Have you got?comprehension of it?”

Nodding in appreciation, Emperor Xiao said and his sonorous voice directly reached to the World Prison.

“Kid, come out!”

His voice contained some unique magic, as if it could invade one’s mind and soul. In the World Prison, Jian Wushuang, who had understood World Dao, was still in a state of ecstasy. Suddenly a crack was found by him on the stone wall. He began walking out of the World Prison along the crack, and again came before Emperor Xiao.

“Respected Emperor Xiao,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

“You’ve received a comprehension of World Dao, haven’t you?” Emperor Xiao smiled and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“You took only two days to comprehend World Dao. Although your enlightenment may have something to do with the World Prison, I’d attribute it more to your own perception. You’re such a talent that has proved yourself to be the successor of an old friend of mine. His Heavenly Creation Skill not only created in you a perfect foundation but also helped you improve your comprehension,” Emperor Xiao continued.

“As you’ve comprehended World Dao, you still have more to improve. Since the World Prison is still useful for you, you’d better stay there to meditate for the rest of your time. By the time the Firmament Territory Feast begins, I believe you’ll completely break the World Prison.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said and seriously nodded.

Within just two days, he had already seen many strange things in the World Prison. The World Prison did play a great role in his comprehension of World Dao, much more useful than Six-story Pagoda to Slaughter Dao. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“In addition, the comprehension of Dao is only one aspect of strength, and the Secret Skill is also crucial to the improvement of strength,” said Emperor Xiao.

Jian Wushuang listened to him carefully.

“The Secret Skill is a technique that is developed based on the application of Weapon Dao after one’s comprehension of Dao Reaches a certain level. It has various kinds, most of which are used as offensive power.”

“Secret Skills have distinctions between strong and weak. In the Eternal World, Secret Skills are divided into plenty of levels according to its power, among which the most common and the weakest one are Rank One Secret Skill which is also what you are now qualified to cultivate.”

“Rank One Secret Skill?” Jian Wushuang felt a bit enticed.

“Rank One Secret Skill is just the most common skill, but for Warriors at the level of Skyscraping Realm it’s totally different when he creates the Secret Skill. His battle strength would even rise to a new level even if he only creates the most common Rank One Secret Skill,” Emperor Xiao continued.

“For example in the Ancient World, the Dark Emperor, who is known as the one with No.1 offensive power, has created his Secret Skill. After the last matchup with him, you must know how strong his Secret Skill power is, right?”

“Well,” Jian Wushuang nodded seriously. “The Secret Skill of Dark Emperor is horribly powerful.”

“Horrible powerful?” scorned Emperor Xiao. “That move created by Dark Emperor is somewhat considered as a Secret Skill, or it may just reach the threshold of Rank One Secret Skill. According to the there levels of Rank One Secret Skill i.e. elementary, advanced and superior, the move created by Dark Emperor narrowly belongs to the elementary level.”

“The elementary? Narrowly reach its requirements?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He had thought that the move of Dark Emperor was incredibly powerful, but he now found it had just reached the elementary level.

So how strong was a real elementary Rank One Secret Skill, advanced or even superior level?

What about the Secret Skill beyond Rank One?

“After all, the time you cultivated until now is too short and there are only three years left. You know nothing about Secret Skill. If you want to create it entirely by yourself, even if you have a high level of talent, I’m afraid it will take a very long time, so...”

Then Emperor took out an Interspatial Ring and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

“Within this Interspatial Ring, there are a few Secret Skills, all of which are Secret Skills of Sword Principle created by Warriors of Sword Principle in the Eternal World.”

“You can take these Secret Skills to research, investigate and use as references. In this way, you would greatly shorten the time you spend on cultivation.”

“After all, you are not that powerful now. Even though I gave you the Secret Skill created by experts of Sword Principle above Eternal Realm, you can’t understand it. So the Secret Skill of Sword Principle within the Interspatial Ring is mostly created by experts of Sword Principle at the level of Divine Realm.”
