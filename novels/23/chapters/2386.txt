Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I have cleaned up the people from Mu Clan, but I can’t do anything about the few left.”

Jian Wushuang clearly sounded a little helpless.

As for Xiao Heng and the core disciples, they were simply lost.

They had no idea what Jian Wushuang and Miss Xiao were talking about.

Jian Wushuang asked Miss Xiao if she was satisfied?

Why ask such a question?

And what about the ‘few left’ that Jian Wushuang mentioned?

Who else was there at that moment other than them?

Just as Xiao Heng and his group were puzzled... Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three figures suddenly appeared next to them without any premonition.

They were two men and a woman, the leader was a handsome young man with black hair.

“This is...” Xiao Heng and his group looked over.

Their faces changed as soon as they saw them.

Although there were only three of them, the divine power they emitted was so strong and overpowering.

Apparently, they were the Three Big First-Class Divine Demons!

The black-haired young man who was leading them stood there like a big mountain, his overpowering energy made Xiao Heng and the core disciples struggle to breathe.

“This is...” Xiao Heng stared at the black-haired young man and a name came to mind.

“Bai Tao! This is Bai Tao of Nine Stars Palace!!”

Even Xiao Heng’s voice slightly trembled.

“Bai Tao of Nine Stars Palace?” The four core disciples paused for a second and then their faces changed. “Twelve Minor Kings! He is one of the Twelve Minor Kings, Bai Tao!”

The Wusha Wilderness was not quite comparable to the Ancient God Domain, but there were quite a number of prodigies.

The widely renowned top prodigies in Wusha Wilderness were none other than the Twelve Minor Kings!

The Twelve Minor Kings were all incredibly talented. Some were from powerful sects, some from certain clans, and there were two lone wolves.

Bai Tao was one of them. Although he was in the lower ranks of the twelve—merely placed eleventh—he was still an extraordinary prodigy.

Xiao Heng knew that he was quite talented himself, but if he were to be compared to Bai Tai, he was nothing.

“What’s happening? Why is Bai Tao of the Twelve Minor Kings showing up here? And it seems like Jian Wushuang had already known of their presence before this?” Xiao Heng and the four core disciples were filled with questions. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Following the appearance of the three First-Class Divine Demons, the atmosphere had changed into a delicate one.

The black-haired young man, Bai Tao, had a pair of dark eyes like black diamonds and was full of energy.

At that moment, he was staring straight at Jian Wushuang.

“A mere Middle Stage Chaotic Realm could match his battle strength with First-Class Divine Demon? In addition, his senses were so sharp that though we hid extremely well, he could still detect us.”

The three of them had noticed Miss Xiao long ago.

Since Xiao Heng and his company brought Miss Xiao out of Qingxiao City, they were just following them from behind and never showed themselves. What just happened there was clearly witnessed by them.

They definitely saw Jian Wushuang defeating the Mu Clan experts like tearing down rotten trees with his Middle Stage Chaotic Realm abilities.

The abilities that Jian Wushuang had shown which does not correspond with the realm he was in, even surprised prodigies such as Bai Tao.

When Bai Tao himself was in the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, the most he could do was to defeat a Peak Stage Chaotic Realm.

However, Jian Wushuang was apparently way stronger than him.

“What kind of monster is this? Why haven’t I heard of him?” Bai Tao mumbled to himself.

Seeing the three’s appearance, Jian Wushuang gave a mild smile and stepped to the side.

He was only helping Miss Xiao clean up the Mu Clan experts. As for Bai Tao and his companions, he had no obligations to deal with them.

“Miss Xiao, it’s up to you now.”

Jian Wushuang intriguingly looked at Miss Xiao.

Miss Xiao came off as incredibly dangerous and enigmatic to him. Now that the Three Big First-class Divine Demons were there, he could take this opportunity to see what her real capabilities were.

Miss Xiao took a glance at Jian Wushuang without saying a word then leisurely gazed over at Bai Tao and his companions.

“Sir, may I ask, what is the reason for you to be here?” Miss Xiao maintained a very attractive look.

Her every move was unforgettable.

Xiao Heng and his companions fluttered inside, their eyes still betrayed their craze.

“You lowly maid, don’t use your tricks on me. I’m only here today to ask you a question.” Bai Tao started at Miss Xiao as her seductive qualities had no effect on him.

Miss Xiao maintained her expression, but there was a trace of frostiness deep in her eyes. “I wonder what would the question be, sir?”

“Half a year ago, there were a few Nine Stars Palace disciples who came to Luogu Territory for some adventures and came to Qingxiao City. However, not long after their arrival in Qingxiao City, all six of them, including Junior Brother Luo Zhen disappeared without a trace. Do you know anything about this?” asked Bai Tao coldly.

Hearing the story, Xiao Heng and the core disciples felt slightly surprised.

Luo Zhen... It was not an unfamiliar name to them.

Although he was not one of the Twelve Minor Kings and his reputation was not as prestigious as Bai Tao, Luo Zhen was absolutely one of the most outstanding disciples from Nine Stars Palace. Furthermore, just like Bai Tao, Luo Zhen was also the Palace Master’s personal disciple.

How did a prodigal disciple like that disappear in Qingxiao City?

Seeing that Miss Xiao did not react to the question, Bai Tao continued to speak, “After realizing that Junior Brother Luo Zhen and his group disappeared, we did everything we could to investigate this matter. After investigating half a year, we finally found out that the Hundred Flowers Tower was the last place they visited and the last person they met was you!”

“Would you deny that the disappearance of Junior Brother Luo Zhen and his group had nothing to do with you?”

Bai Tao and the two First-Class Divine Demons next to him stared straight at Miss Xiao.

The fact that they dared to confront her personally meant that what they said had fairly solid grounds. Even though they could not prove that Luo Zhen and the rest died in Miss Xiao’s hands, they could at least be certain that their disappearance was deeply related to Miss Xiao.

Miss Xiao laughed hearing Bai Tao’s words. “Looks like the Nine Stars Sect has pretty good intelligence sources, huh? You could actually trace this far.”

“So it is YOU!”

Bai Tao’s expression turned grim, and his massive god power began its oppression against Miss Xiao.

The god power of a First-Class Divine Demon could even make Third-Class and Second-Class Divine Demons shudder. However, Miss Xiao did not budge at all.

“You lowly maid, where are Junior Brother Luo Zhen and his group right now?” growled Bai Tao.

“Oh, them? Let me think...” Miss Xiao pretended to think deeply and after a long while and acted as if she just recalled. “Oh, I remember. They are all dead.”
