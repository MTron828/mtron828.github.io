Chapter 1321: The Sacred Lights Came!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“He is here!” King of Venomous Worms went wild with joy.

Although King of Venomous Worms hadn’t recovered his power to one hundred percent, his power to recover and detect was still incomparable.

Even Universe Gods in the third heaven didn’t have the power to detect as well as him.

Therefore, when everyone else believed that Jian Wushuang had died, King of Venomous Worms could detect his breath.

Jian Wushuang was still breathing. No matter how weak the breath was, he was still alive!

“Aha, you are still alive.”

King of Venomous Worms was extremely happy but he didn’t rush to help Jian Wushuang recover.

Because he knew that Jian Wushuang was able to recover himself.

King of Venomous Worms looked at the sky, “I guess the Sacred Light is coming.”

However, the huge, dark cloud was still staying in the heavens, showing no signs of dissipating.

“Why is that?”

“Why don’t the clouds dissipate?

Cultivators outside the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle felt something unexpected.

Under normal circumstances, the thunderclouds would dissipate after the cultivators died in the God Test.

Just like the situation where Dong Men Universe God died in the God Test.

But now the clouds were still there, while others could feel the breath of Jian Wushuang.

“Maybe…Jian Wushuang was still alive?”

A Universe God guessed, surprising others around him.

Didn’t he die?

But if he didn’t die, why can’t others feel his breath?

Boom!

At the moment, a huge thundercloud split.

“What?”

Everyone looked up to the heavens, seeing and sensing a golden light from the splitting thunderclouds.

A golden light as bright as the Sun, providing everyone comfortable warmth.

“The…Sacred Light?” Everyone’s eyes were wide open.

The Sacred Light would come and shine on the cultivators who passed the God Test, helping them recover and transform their power.

Everyone was familiar with that light.

And now, it had arrived!

“Jian Wushuang is still alive!” Master of the Scarlet Island exclaimed.

Many other Universe Gods also raised their heads.

“How can it be possible?” Universe God Jiu Hai felt nervous.

Even Master of the Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang also felt surprised by the light.

They had just thought that Jian Wushuang had died. But now, the light was coming. And he was still alive!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The heaven roared nine times as the golden light in the splitting thunderclouds got denser and brighter, and then was divided into nine flashes.

Each one of the nine flashes, huge and colorful, gushed right into the bottom of the huge hole in the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle.

Nine Sacred Lights coming at the same time!

“Nine Sacred Lights!”

Everyone became breathless.

The Sacred Light, containing tremendous power, helped cultivators recover and transform their power.

Generally speaking, cultivators who pass the God Test of the First Heaven only receive one Sacred Light. The Second Heaven, two. And the lights were usually narrow.

But now nine Sacred Lights came at the same time!

The size of each was a tenth as large as normal ones.

What did this mean?

Master of the Dayu Palace said, “The more difficult the God Test is, the more benefits after that. I remember I received three Sacred Lights a meter wide after the Fire Test, which already brought me huge benefits. And now, after such a horrible Inverse Cultivation Test, Jian Wushuang will certainly get far more benefits than we could imagine.

“I wonder how powerful he could become after receiving nine Sacred Lights.” Lord Wu Cang was excited.

Others cultivators were amazed and also admired Jian Wushuang.

They were all waiting to see Jian Wushuang receive the Sacred Lights.

Half of the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle was destroying, leaving a huge, dark and lifeless hole.

Right at the bottom of the hole, Jian Wushuang was lying there, injured and weak.

Despite the protection of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, the powerful Sacred Thunder struck Jian Wushuang, nearly tearing him apart and burning his skin.

Thanks to his Inverse Cultivation and the experience of immortality, Jian Wushuang became extremely resilient, which explained why he survived such a devastating attack.

Others, including Universe Gods in the Third Heaven like Master of Dayu Palace, couldn’t have been as lucky as Jian Wushuang under the same attack.

“How lucky am I!”

Jian Wushuang lay there extremely weak, but he smiled happily at this moment.

He was delighted for his achievement.

Although he had almost died, he now survived and got away with death.

He had passed the first part of the Inverse Cultivation Test!

Hum!

Now he was blessed by the nine Sacred Lights.

The power of warmth went into the body of Jian Wushuang, relieving his great pain and making him comfortable.

He was embracing the Sacred Lights, safe and sound.

The nine Sacred Lights cradled him just as a kind mother would for her child.

Thanks to the lights, Jian Wushuang recovered himself just within a moment, several times faster than King of Venomous Worms.

And soon, Jian Wushuang started to transform himself!
