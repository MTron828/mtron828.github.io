Chapter 2208 Heaven Suppressing Monument!

Jian Wushuang looked closely at whatever he was shown.The Heavens cracked and countless Divine Demon experts died.Suddenly... Hum!

Everything flickered and turned dark.

Jian Wushuang returned to the floating province with ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine steps.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang turned pale.

He just came out from the Ancient Display.

However, he did not finish watching the second scroll of the Ancient Display. He only saw the bold man’s divine body explode after casting certain techniques. This caused heaven and earth to crack and shatter. Jian Wushuang had no idea what happened next.

“What happened after this? After this bold man died, what happened to those who attacked him? And about the Heaven’s Will...” Jian Wushuang’s heart twitched when he thought about this.

That was the first time he felt the real Heaven’s Will.

He could sense there were Rules of Order within the Eternal Chaotic World, but the Heaven’s Will was of even higher level.

Who could be at the level to understand and use Heaven’s Will?

Only the superpowers back in the ancient past who became so powerful that even heaven and earth disapproved of his existence then would the Heaven’s Will come and suppress that expert personally.

Who was that bold man in the Ancient Display who could force Heaven’s Will to dissipate with one look? How powerful must he be?

Jian Wushuang took a cold breath when he thought of this.

“You should have seen those things.” Emperor Thirteen looked over and said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang said. Right when he was about to ask more questions, Emperor Thirteen continued.

“I know that you have a lot of questions right now. I cannot and will not answer any of them. When the time is right, you will know everything.”

Jian Wushuang was caught by surprise but he did not proceed with raising his doubts.

Emperor Thirteen looked up at the bold man and waved his hand. A unique energy radiated out towards that man.

Hum~~~

The energy fused with the dark space. Then, a streak of brilliant light was seen in the dark space.

This streak of light began to enlarge before revealing its true colours.

It was a gigantic, grey monument.

It was ten thousand feets high and was made up of grey crystals that was not ever seen before by Jian Wushuang.

The grey monument floated in the dark space and soon moved in front of Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang studied the monument but could not see anything.

It was a blank monument as it had no inscriptions at all.

It was an ordinary monument.

However, Jian Wushuang knew that this monument was definitely extraordinary as it was hidden so well in the depth of the head.

“This is the Heaven Suppressing Monument. There are nine of them in this world. One of such monuments is an extremely high grade treasure. If you managed to gather all nine... You can suppress the Heavens and Earth!” Emperor Thirteen said with a flash of excitement in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He just saw the Ancient Display and knew for sure that Heaven’s Will was something that is real and present in this world.

If Emperor Thirteen said that one could suppress the Heavens and Earth, did he mean it could suppress Heaven’s Will?

Jian Wushuang took a cold breath when he thought of this.

“The Heaven Suppressing Monument is very special and contains many extremely profound and complicated hidden secrets. It is extremely useful for you. I will activate the hidden secrets within the monument. You should stand here and try to understand them.” Emperor Thirteen said.

“Understand them?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Given how powerful the Heaven Suppressing Monument was, how amazing were the secrets it contained?

Emperor Thirteen activating the hidden secrets within the monument was like giving him an opportunity for him to become even stronger.

Jian Wushuang had many burning questions, but he ignored them all and started to prepare to understand the hidden secrets.

“Remember. You only have one chance. How much you can understand depends on you.” Emperor Thirteen said as he started to form seals with his hands and placing them onto the monument.

Instantly, the monument which was ten thousand feet tall radiated a special aura.

At the same time, a grey air current appeared.

The grey air current seemed extremely mysterious. Anyone who recognized it would be in disbelief.

This air current was rare even in the ancient past. It was the Air of Chaos!

Air of Chaos was one of the things that the experts from the ancient past sought after crazily.

The air that gushed out of the monument was the Air of Chaos!

Hum~ Hum~ Hum~

The Air of Chaos started to drift towards Jian Wushuang as it completely surrounded him like a cocoon.

“This is.....”

Jian Wushuang widened his eyes in surprise as he stared at the air that was surrounding him.

Even though he could not recognize the air, he could feel how pure and concentrated the energy which was contained in the air was. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Never had he seen any energy so pure.

Without hesitation, he started channeling the Heavenly Creation Skill. As this skill continued to be channeled, all the Air of Chaos was absorbed through his pores and was converted into his own divine power.

“My divine power is improving at such a fast rate!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist in excitement.

He could feel that he was getting stronger at an extremely fast rate.

This speed was not achievable with just self meditation or any random treasure.

The rate of improvement was not so great back when Jian Wushuang was meditating beside the Supreme Emperor Stone.

However, this grey airflow was not the truly valuable opportunity.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked up and stared at the ten thousand feet tall Heaven Suppressing Monument.

Originally, this monument had no inscriptions at all.

Slowly, ancient inscriptions started to appear at the top of the monument.

It was gold in colour, in a language Jian Wushuang had never seen before.

This was completely different from any language there was in the Eternal Chaotic World.

These words were not a unique language from the Ancient Past.

There were many ancient past battlefields left behind in the Eternal Chaotic World, many of which contained certain ancient languages.

These ancient languages had some resemblance to the modern languages the people of the Eternal Chaotic World use. Jian Wushuang would recognize them if he saw it.

However, Jian Wushuang could not recognize these words at all.
