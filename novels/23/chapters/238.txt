Chapter 239: Hundred Beasts Essence Realm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

The air suddenly trembled. An invisible wave rippled outwards, but Ku Ya had disappeared from where he had been before.

“Where are they?”

Numerous warriors, including those who were hidden, all focused their gaze. They just barely noticed a ray of light slicing through the air.

Shua!

The space in front of Jian Wushuang suddenly erupted as a yellow shriveled palm, which changed to resemble an eagle claw, grasped at Jian Wushuang’s throat.

“So fast!”

A trace of surprise flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. While observing the shattered space in front of him, his body retreated. At the same time, he grasped his longsword and sliced through the air with a horizontal sword light that headed directly towards Ku Ya.

Although Ku Ya’s initial claw attack failed, the power collected at his fingertips caused the area to tremble until it was on the verge of collapse. Then he changed forms from the claw, back to an opened palm, then thrust towards Jian Wushuang again, with a gust of terrifying spiritual power concentrated in his palm.

“Three-beasts-killing Fist, Ape-killing Fist!”

Ku Ya let out a low howl as a towering shadow suddenly rose from his back.

It was the shadow of a giant ape that seemed to have come here from ancient times. When the giant ape formed, a gust of ancient yet chilling air radiated out. At the same time, the giant ape ferociously pounded its own chest before morphing into a fist an instant later.

This fist was as big as a mountain, and it directly exploded outwards.

Rumble~~~ Whoosh.

This monstrous fist rushed through the air and immediately shattered the ray of sword light that was flying towards it before continuing to fly towards Jian Wushuang, who was quickly retreating.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted mildly and sparkled with light.

“Break!”

With a low growl, Slaughter Origin exploded and a shocking gust of killing intent filled the area. Then, Jian Wushuang’s ferocious Long Sword surged with Slaughter Origin as it charged out like a falling meteor towards the giant ape fist.

“Peng!”

As the two forces met, a loud bang was heard, and a hole appeared in the giant ape’s fist. The whole gradually increased until it caused the fist to shatter. A magnificent spiritual power flowed out in every direction and dispersed.

“You can actually fight back against this move head-on?” Ku Ya stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold expression on his face, then he suddenly leapt forward.

The moment when he leapt?forward, the shadow of the giant ape behind him also immediately changed.

What was originally an ancient giant ape had become a fierce tiger that was in the prowling position and ready to attack.

This fierce tiger was also massive beyond comparison.

“Three-beasts-killing Fist, Tiger-killing Fist!”

Ku Ya summoned his strength and struck out with his palm once again.

“Roar!”

Along with a roar, the prowling tiger shadow behind him instantly exploded with power. Its huge body leapt and lunged directly towards Jian Wushuang. As it lunged forward, Jian Wushuang felt a heavy pressure weigh down on his heart that he did not dare to take lightly.

As the Long Sword was thrust forward, Slaughter Origin was harnessed to its extreme!

Boom!

A collision occurred once again, but this time Jian Wushuang was forced to retreat in a shameful manner.

“Not bad. You are indeed Tianzong Dynasty’s most talented genius. The first two moves of my Three-beasts-killing Fist could not stop you. But let’s see how you fare against the third move,” Ku Ya said in low and emotionless voice.

As his voice fell, he suddenly moved, causing a gust of spiritual power to begin swirling.

As he bent his body, the shadow tiger began to transform once more into a long meandering dragon.

Even stationary, this dragon was already more than thirty feet in height. This enormous dragon scanned the surroundings below with its eyes and everyone felt a chilling aura from the body of this enormous dragon.

“Three-beasts-killing Fist, Dragon-killing Fist!”

Ku Ya suddenly let out an explosive roar as the dragon straightened its meandering body. Its body looked like an arrow that had locked onto its target and was ready to be released. Then the enormous dragon shadow behind Ku Ya instantly shot forward.

Immediately the world became grey. The massive dragon flew through the air, leaving the sound of thunder wherever it passed.

It only took a moment for the dragon to appear in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted slightly as he did everything he could to resist the attack.

But when Jian Wushuang truly collided with the massive dragon, the dragon exploded.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang’s body shot backwards like a cannonball, crashing down towards the rooftop of the Raindrop Pavilion.

Even though the house could be considered big, It was immediately shattered by the massive force. As for Jian Wushuang, he continued falling toward the ground, creating a gigantic hole where he landed. After falling and creating the gigantic hole, Jian Wushuang was silent for a moment.

“Is he dead?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ku Ya floated in the air while looking at the giant pit with slightly squinted eyes.

“To die under the Dragon-killing Fist of my Three-beasts-killing Fist can be considered an honor,” Ku Ya said proudly to himself.

But just as he finished speaking, a rumble was heard. In the giant pit, rocks started to float toward the sky and morphing into rays of Flowing Light, which flew towards Ku Ya at a visible speed.

Ku Ya’s expression sank. With a wave of his hand, the floating rocks were smashed.

But Jian Wushuang climbed out of the pit and reappeared once again. He quickly leapt into the sky and stopped in front of Ku Ya.

“You didn’t die?” Ku Ya looked at Jian Wushuang and asked. His expression changed slightly and said, “Not only did you live, you didn’t even get injured?”

Ku Ya naturally felt a bit uneasy.

Ku Ya knew that he had already used his full strength, even using the most powerful move of the Three-beasts-killing Fist. But in the end, he didn’t harm Jian Wushuang at all?

Jian Wushuang looked at Ku Ya with a strange expression and thought,?“This old guy’s essence realm really is quite special.”

After a few confrontations, Jian Wushuang understood Ku Ya’s strength. The Exceptional Yang Void Realm was indeed impressive, and Ku Ya’s essence realm was also very unique.

Jian Wushuang could tell that Ku Ya had comprehended two essences. One was Thunderbolt, but the one with greater mastery was the Hundred Beasts Essence.

The Hundred Beasts Essence. If he persisted in comprehending it, there was a chance he would comprehend the Origin of All Beasts.

There were many Origins in the universe, and the Origin of All Beasts was one of the extremely powerful Origins.

“What a pity. Although Ku Ya understood these two unique realms, he had not merged them. If he had, then he would have been able to kill this Slaughter Doppelganger (Yin-Yang doppelganger) of mine.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head secretly.

That’s right. Ku Ya had displayed his awesome power, and the Exceptional Yang Void Realm was indeed very impressive.

But it was still not good enough to be praised by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stood in the air. With a flip of his hand, an explosive Long Sword beyond comparison flew out from his palm. As for the original Long Sword, he kept it in his Interspatial Ring. Looking at the Triple-kill Sword in his hand, he spoke with a tone of expectancy.

“Kid, this is your first fight after your awakening. Don’t let me down.”
