Chapter 86: Jian Wushuang’s Strength

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How could that be?” The indigo-robed man eyes almost fell out their sockets.

“This is impossible!” The other purple-haired middle-aged man was also completely shocked.

“Is… Is this the real strength of the disciples of Dragon Palace?” Ye Mei also had unprecedented shock in her eyes.

It was an unstoppable force versus an immovable object when a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea confronted the Herculean Demonic Monkey with Profound Gold Core Realm. As a result, would the Herculean Demonic Monkey decide to escape?

“Quick, kill the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns.”

After a brief shock, the indigo-robed man reacted first and shouted loudly.

Ye Mei was startled and the harsh light in her eyes flashed. Wow! The sword light roared out instantly with astonishing power. Her strength at the moment erupted to the extreme.

She did not know how long Jian Wushuang could delay the Herculean Demonic Monkey, so she had to battle quickly to force an outcome.

“Go to hell!” The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man also shot out at full force at the moment.

As their power was unleashed, the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns who had already been pushed to the limit, immediately lost its struggle and was killed directly.

When the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns died, the two golden horns on its foreheads immediately became the target.

“Golden Horns.” Ye Mei rolled her eyes and went towards the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns.

“Grab them quickly.” The indigo-robed man suddenly burst out shouting, followed by a sound of humming and a towering Axe Shadow chopped towards Ye Mei suddenly.

“What?” Ye Mei was shocked and quickly wielded her sword to resist. As the Axe Shadow heavily hit on her long sword, Ye Mei backed sharply.

“Ha ha!”

When the laughter sounded and Ye Mei was retreating, the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man rushed to the dead body of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns immediately. Then they removed the two golden horns of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns with giant axes. After four blows in succession, they finally detached the two golden horns.

Two golden horns immediately fell into the hands of the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man.

“You two.” Ye Mei armed with a longsword, glared at the two men in front of her with fury in her eyes.

“All is fair in war, little girl. Thank you for killing the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, but these two golden horns belong to us.” The indigo-robed man smiled.

“Bastard.” Ye Mei was becoming more furious. There was a towering aura surrounding her with signs that it would erupt.

“What? Do you want to fight?” The indigo-robed man grinned, and next to him, the purple-haired middle-aged man also stared at Ye Mei icily.

If it was one-for-one, he knew that neither of them was an opponent of Ye Mei, but by teaming up, they would have no fear.

“Ho-ho, two strong men attacking a little girl. Don’t you feel ashamed?” A light voice suddenly sounded.

The facial expression of the indigo-robed man and purple-haired middle-aged man both changed, and they quickly looked towards the source of the voice.

At the side, Jian Wushuang, armed with his Triple-kill Sword, was surrounded by overwhelming sword essences. As for the Mighty Demonic Monkey, which frightened them when they heard of it, it was lying at the feet of Jian Wushuang unmoving. A bloody hole was in its chest with streams of blood flowing out.

This scene made both the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man inhale sharply.

“The Herculean Demonic Monkey, is dead!” Ye Mei was also astonished.

After watching Jian Wushuang fighting with the Herculean Demonic Monkey and hacking it to death with one sword stroke, they had already been shocked, but now…

It was dead!

The Herculean Demonic Monkey could not be dead.

Since Jian Wushuang began his fight with the Mighty Demonic Monkey, it had only been a few minutes. It was during those few minutes that the Mighty Demonic Monkey had been killed.

What was happening?

Were they dreaming?

The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man were a little confused. Even Ye Mei, who knew Jian Wushuang’s real identity, was still extremely shocked.

At the same time, she finally understood why her father asked Jian Wushuang to take care of her.

She had looked down on Jian Wushuang before, thinking that disciples of Dragon Palace were useless.

But now she knew how foolish she was.

They were shocked, but Jian Wushuang was very calm without any exultation. After all, he was a disciple of Dragon Palace.

Disciples of Dragon Palace were all super talents. They were all weirdos. But he was the weirdest among them because he could defeat Nangong Jie after he had joined the Dragon Palace for only three months. Besides, he cultivated such a defiant cultivation tactic as the Heavenly Creation Skill…

“Although the Herculean Demonic Monkey’s power is extremely high, it only had brute force. The power I used through the Heavenly Creation Skill is only at the Level of the ordinary Initial Gold Core Realm, but my swordsmanship and sword essence are very high. Depending on the power of the Formless Sword Wave and the swordsmanship power to fight with it directly, I had an absolute advantage. In other respects, I have a significant edge. It was an easy kill.” Jian Wushuang did not take it too seriously.

Catching a glimpse of the remains of the Herculean Demonic Monkey, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and put the remains of the Mighty Demonic Monkey into the Interspatial Ring, and then Jian Wushuang looked at the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man again.

“During the killing of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, Ye Mei and I contribute the most. But the two most important gold horns belong to you two whose contributions are the least. That’s not fair, is it?” Jian Wushuang said with a light smile.

“What do you want?” The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man were staring at Jian Wushuang fearfully.

They thought Jian Wushuang would be entangled with the Herculean Demonic Monkey for a long time and had no time to think about him, so they grabbed the two gold horns quickly. They had never dreamed that Jian Wushuang would kill the Herculean Demonic Monkey in only a few minutes.

“Take out the two golden horns, and I can ignore what happened just now.” Jian Wushuang said.

The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man were displeased and looked at each other. Then the indigo-robed man nodded and said, “OK, we will take them out.”

Hearing this, Ye Mei breathed with a relief.

However, suddenly…

“Run.” The indigo-robed man shouted lowly and the purple-haired middle-aged man leaped up immediately.

Both of them were very clear that the condition for the completion of this mission was exactly the two gold horns. As long as they could escape and flee to the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace, even without the witness of their team leader Ba Yan, they could complete this Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard mission with these two gold horns.

But once they moved and acted, an icy sword light immediately whistled out.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The sword light whistled slightly, skimming directly onto these two men’s faces.

The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man stopped their paces at once. They were shocked, feeling their faces turn cold. They subconsciously touching their faces and felt a stream of scalding blood.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of them suddenly, and the icy voice passed slowly into their ears.

“The stroke just now only left a sword mark on your faces, but the next one, will cut your throats.”
