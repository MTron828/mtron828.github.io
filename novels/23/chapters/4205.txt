4206 Rogue Cultivator Alliance

If fifth and fourth stage Rulers could be seen occasionally in the Tarot Ruins, then there were no cultivators below the Ultimate Ruler level on the ancient path of stars!

Even these Ultimate Rulers were powerful and imposing. They were all experts who had reached the top of the Ultimate Rulers!

Jian Wushuang could not help but look forward to what it would be like on the ancient path of stars.

“This ancient path of stars truly lives up to its name. There are no weaklings at the outermost area.”

!!

Jian Wushuang complimented and then walked down from universe boat. He put universe boat away and walked toward the gate of the ancient road of stars. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Halt!”

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to step into the ancient path of stars, two Ultimate Rulers crossed their halberds and blocked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could not help but frown and said indifferently, “What do you mean?”

“If you wish to enter, you can. However, you have to pay a million Universe Origin Stones.” The two Ultimate Rulers glanced at Jian Wushuang indifferently and said expressionlessly.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. One million Universe Origin Stones was just a small number to him. However, it did not mean that he would be a fool and allow others to scam him.

He had never heard of anyone saying that one had to pay Universe Origin Stones to enter the ancient path of stars.

“Why don’t they need to hand over the Universe Origin Stones?” Jian Wushuang glanced at him and said indifferently.

Next to him was a peak Ultimate Ruler who walked in without any obstacles.

“They are Ultimate Rulers, so they naturally don’t need to pay Universe Origin Stones. You, on the other hand, are merely a fifth-stage great Ruler. Can you be compared to them?” The two guards sized up Jian Wushuang and sneered.

“I’ll be honest with you. We are the subordinates of the first city’s city lord, Ruler Bone Armor. If you wish to enter the ancient starry sky path, you must obediently follow the rules and pay a million Universe Origin Stones!”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“So what if I don’t hand it over?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

“You won’t hand it over…”

The two guards grinned hideously as they raised their halberds and stabbed at Jian Wushuang!

“Then get out!!!”

Bang!

A violent divine power suddenly followed the halberd and stabbed at Jian Wushuang’s chest!

“You’re looking for death!”

Jian Wushuang’s face flashed with a touch of anger. He raised his hand and slapped at the two guards!

The guards of the two gates were both experts among the Ultimate Rulers. Seeing that Jian Wushuang did not escape but instead turned his hand to slap them, the two guards could not help but look at each other and laugh.

“Is this person an idiot? A mere fifth-stage great Ruler dares to overestimate his abilities and attack us?”

“Chi Mu, we’ve been guarding this place for so long, but this is the first time we’ve met such an interesting person. Don’t be in a hurry to kill him, just let him play with us.”

The two of them laughed and talked, not taking Jian Wushuang’s palm seriously at all. Their eyes were full of teasing.

Jian Wushuang was expressionless. He had seen so many idiots like them, so he was naturally not angry.

Bang!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s palm hit the two halberds hard!

The vast and vigorous divine power directly smashed the two halberds into dust in an instant!

“He brought it upon himself…what?”

In an instant, the contemptuous sneers on the two guards’ faces froze, and they could not help but cry out in shock.

How can a Ruler have such terrifying divine power?!

Before they could finish their words, Jian Wushuang’s palm had turned them into meat paste, starting from their heads.

The two of them had been destroyed!

“Idiot.”

Jian Wushuang withdrew his hand expressionlessly. He did not even bother to use the Wuqi Divine Sword to deal with an ordinary Ultimate Ruler. He just used the most primitive divine power to crush and destroy him.

Some of the surrounding Ultimate Rulers were not too surprised when they saw this. After a slight pause, they went back to their own business.

The ancient path of stars gathered all the geniuses of the universe, and many of them were able to kill enemies of a higher level. They were already used to it.

“I just don’t know which Divine Son or Holy Son this new guy is from.”

They shook their heads and strode away.

At the entrance, Jian Wushuang took a step forward and his body suddenly flew up. He then shot toward the entrance of the ancient path of stars.

The ancient path of stars seemed to be an extremely long dark passage. Jian Wushuang flew at full speed for a long time before he gradually saw a glimmer of light.

Slowly, the light grew brighter and brighter. In the next moment, Jian Wushuang’s vision was suddenly filled with light.

A huge and lofty city appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The city was unimaginably huge. Just the city walls alone were a hundred thousand feet tall. A huge plaque hung above the city walls with the words ‘first city’ carved on it!

“I heard from the Ninth Kalpa King that there are a total of 18 cities on the ancient path of stars. These 18 cities are the 18 checkpoints. It seems that the first city is the first checkpoint.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and continued to look down.

At the entrance of the city, a huge stone stele was erected. On the stele, one thousand names were carved in a golden light. The first name on the stele was the bone-armored Ruler that the two guards had mentioned at the entrance of the ancient path of stars. He was the city Lord of the first city!

“No wonder those two guards dared to be so arrogant. They must be relying on this Ruler Bone Armor.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and muttered to himself.

He continued to look around.

Countless Ultimate Rulers were sitting cross-legged below the city walls. No one disturbed anyone, and they were all cultivating in seclusion.

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry to break into the city. Instead, he sat down cross-legged and planned to understand the rules of the ancient path of stars first.

“Sir, you must have just arrived on the ancient path of stars, right?” At that moment, a voice suddenly came from behind Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang turned around and saw a chubby young man looking at him with a smile.

“May I know what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang frowned, stepped back a little, and asked.

The chubby youth replied with a smile, “Don’t be nervous, Sir. Let me introduce myself first. My name is Ruler Wu Hai. You can call me Wu Hai. May I know your name?”

“Blood Sword.” Jian Wushuang replied indifferently.

“Sir Blood Sword, I have a piece of advice for you. Are you willing to listen?” Ruler Wu Hai cupped his hands and said.

“Just say it.” Jian Wushuang replied indifferently.

“Alright,” he said. Ruler Wu Hai paused for a while. The honest and kind expression on his face gradually turned solemn.
