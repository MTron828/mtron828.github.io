Chapter 1788: Disciple, Maidservant

“Master? Mister?”

The Universe Gods in Dayu World were confused. They wondered who were they greeting.

Just as they looked in the direction they bowed at, they saw Jian Wushuang who stood there proudly. They were astonished by the sight.

“The two of them were bowing at… Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s impossible!”

Everyone found it unbelievable.

Until Jian Wushuang waved, “Get up.”

The two of them immediately got up and stood behind Jian Wushuang politely.

Looking at the sight, no matter how stupid a person was, they should be able to tell that the person that the two of them bowed to humbly was Jian Wushuang.

“Wushuang, my friend, what’s going on?” The Master of Dayu Palace asked with his eyes wide. He even changed the way he called Jian Wushuang immediately.

He had called Jian Wushuang by his name earlier and he had talked to Jian Wushuang on equal terms. However, in his voice then, there was reverence and respect.

Everyone else looked at Jian Wushuang simultaneously.

They were all confused and hoped that Jian Wushuang would clarify.

“Let me introduce to you,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He first pointed at the cold-looking young man carrying a sword.

It was the cold-looking young man who had killed many Universe Gods in the Third Heaven from Tian Jue City alone. He also killed the leader of Tian Jue City, a Real God expert.

“He is He Xiu, he’s my disciple,” Jian Wushuang said casually.

He Xiu smiled and nodded at everyone in respect.

He could tell that his Master was friends with the surrounding people. His Master who was a superb existence who spoke modestly when he talked to the Universe Gods. He naturally didn’t dare to act haughtily.

“He’s your disciple?” The Master of Dayu Palace gulped.

“Wushuang, my friend, you are so lucky. You found such a monstrous lineal disciple,” Wu Cang complimented with envy.

He Xiu immediately corrected when he heard that, “You misunderstood. I am only Master’s registered disciple. As for lineal disciple, I’m afraid I do not qualify with my current ability.”

The Universe Gods from Dayu World gawked at his correction.

Such an unbelievable genius, even in the core of the ten sanctuaries in Eternal Chaotic World, they reckoned he would be a super genius as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. But he was only Jian Wushuang’s registered disciple? He didn’t even qualify to be his lineal disciple?

Is this a joke?

“Wushuang, my friend, this is…?” The Master of Dayu Palace looked at Qiu Yue by the side.

“She is Qiu Yue, she’s my maidservant,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Maidservant?” The Universe Gods felt their throats grow dry .

He Xiu, a Universe God who had killed a Real God and was definitely a super genius in their eyes, was only Jian Wushuang’s registered disciple.

The Real God expert who looked slightly stronger than the master of Tian Jue City, was only Jian Wushuang’s maidservant?

Then, Jian Wushuang who was He Xiu’s master and Qiu Yue’s mister, just how strong was he?

Everyone couldn’t help but look at Jian Wushuang. Their gazes were different from before.

Just then, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were suddenly five figures that sped over from afar. Among the five figures, there were four Universe Gods in the Third Heaven and the one leading was a woman in red, a Real God.

The five figures stopped in the void in front of Jian Wushuang and they bowed simultaneously, “I am Fen Yue under the Monarch of Snow Kingdom, greetings.”

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the woman in red.

He could get down from his high horse before the Master of Dayu Palace, Wu Cang, the Master of Scarlet Kingdom because of their relationship before. However, to Fen Yue, who he didn’t share any relationship with, he behaved differently.

The woman in red, Fen Yue, took a deep breath and replied politely, “Mister, we came under the order of the Monarch. We rushed over from the nearby territory at our fastest speed possible. The Monarch knows that Dayu World shared a close relationship with you and he heard of the Tian Jue City’s plan to come to attack. He was worried that you couldn’t make it in time to Dayu World, so he sent us to dismiss Tian Jue City. But he never expected Mister to arrive before us.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

He could tell that the Monarch of Snow Kingdom cared about his matter a lot.

“Mister, although Tian Jue City’s troop has retreated, they offended you and they shall not be forgiven. The Monarch has already sent three Real Gods with the tenth and eleventh troops to destroy Tian Jue City entirely within ten days. They will exterminate all higher-ups,” Fen Yue reported.

“You can take care of that,” Jian Wushuang waved.

“Yes,” Fen Yue nodded politely.

The Universe Gods in Dayu World saw the sight and they were dumbfounded.

“Real God Fen Yue? The second Military Commander of Snow Kingdom?” Wu Cang looked at Fen Yue and he looked surprised.

Snow Kingdom was a huge Holy Kingdom and they ruled countless worlds. The Monarch of Snow Kingdom mainly controlled over the Holy Kingdom and he naturally required a huge troop. It was said that Snow Kingdom had twenty military troops in total and every troop had ten thousand soldiers. All the soldiers were made of Universe Gods.

The twenty military troops were under the command of four commanders.

In terms of position, even Master of Silence Gloriette from Snow Dojo was slightly below them.

Real God Fen Yue was one of the four commanders.

She was truly a big figure and such a big figure was behaving so politely before Jian Wushuang.

Then, Real God Fen Yue looked at Wu Cang and she flashed a gentle smile, “You must be Mister Wu Cang, right?”

“Wu Cang, mister?” Wu Cang was shocked.

He was only a Universe God in the Third Heaven. Even when he was a Golden Deacon in Snow Dojo, he definitely wasn’t in the eyes of Real God Fen Yue.

But then, not only had Real God Fen Yue called him by his name, she had referred him as mister?

Mister? It was an extremely respectful title.

Normally, they would only refer to someone stronger than themselves as mister, or at least someone who was on equal level.

But then…

“I am,” Wu Cang nodded.

“According to the Monarch’s order, from today on, Mister Wu Cang will be Snow Kingdom’s guest. Your position is equal to Master of Silence Gloriette from Snow Dojo. Not only ago, there was a lineal disciple of his who offended Mister Wu Cang. The lineal disciple was captured and imprisoned in the prison of Snow Sacred Land. As for his punishment, whether to keep him alive or dead will be decided by Mister Wu Cang,” Fen Yue said with a smile.

Wu Cang was dumbfounded by her comment.

He had been kicked out from Snow Sacred Land because he had offended the lineal disciple and he was told to not step foot there anymore.

But then, the change was too drastic.

Of course, he knew clearly that, with him alone, or even ten of him combined, he wouldn’t have such power. There was only one person possibly with such power at the scene.

Wu Cang couldn’t help but look at the person.

This person was, of course, Jian Wushuang!
