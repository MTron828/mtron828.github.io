Chapter 356: Heart-killing

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Opportunities?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued by these words.

Each trial in Ancestor’s Land was accompanied by gifts.

Like what he had got after passing the first trial.

Surely he would get more after passing the second trial.

“It is the same as the first trial, you will be given three opportunities.” Jin Ling said, “Follow me.”

Led by Jin Ling, Jian Wushuang went to the altar of the Ancestor’s Land again. There was a chain bridge leading to the core of the Ancestor’s Land, and Jian Wushuang walked along it, towards the center.

He found himself in a vast wasteland with a towering sword mountain.

On the mountainside, there were several ancient characters.?Jian Wushuang couldn’t read them, but he felt they were mysterious.

“You’re a Core Disciple of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline now, so you are admitted to accessing to the strongest Sword Skill Sword Ancestor created, ‘Heart Killing’!” Jin Ling looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Heart-killing Sword Technique? The most powerful Sword Skill Sword Ancestor created?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“At the height of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline, only the Sword Ancestor’s personal disciples were permitted to study it. However, things are different now. A genius like you is rare among the descendants of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline. Therefore, you are qualified to study it,” Jin Ling said.

“There are nine sword movements in total, and each character on the mountainside contains one movement!”

“You only have one chance to see them. Keep in mind, what you need to do is to try your best to memorize as much as possible. It’s up to you to remember them.”

Jian Wushuang nodded seriously.

Nine characters in total, each one containing one sword movement.

“Go ahead.” After saying that, Jin Ling and Mu Shan stepped back.

Jian Wushuang stood alone at the foot of the mountain, looking up at the characters. Suddenly, the first character began to shine. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A picture appeared in front of Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

It was a black-clothed elder, practicing a sword movement.

He watched carefully and kept all the details in his mind.

But it only lasted for a moment.

As the first character’s light disappeared, the second character began to shine.

“So fast.”?Jian Wushuang frowned secretly.

As soon as the first one finished, the second one started. Jian Wushuang noticed that there was a connection between them, so if he couldn’t memorize the first character, it would be difficult to understand the second one.

As Jin Ling had said, there was only one chance, and he needed to memorize as much as possible.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and completely immersed himself in the image.

One by one, they flashed through his mind, each one only being displayed once.

Jian Wushuang only had one chance.

Not far behind Jian Wushuang, Jin Ling and Mu Shan stood, staring at him.

“It’s the sixth movement. It seems he has memorized the first five movements. To memorize the sixth should be easy for him, and the seventh is possible, but the eighth will be difficult,” Jin Ling murmured.

“With the Heart-killing Sword Technique, the further he goes, the more subtle the technique becomes. Therefore, it’s hard to memorize all nine movements in one attempt. During their heyday, even the Sword Ancestor’s personal disciples could only memorize seven at most with one glance,” Mu Shan said, then sighed with feeling.

The Nine sword movements of the Heart-killing Sword Technique.

The sword movements alone, were simple. But, understanding the abstruseness, that was difficult.

Too complicated, too abstruse!

If you didn’t understand it at a glance, how could you memorize it?

Because of that, it was fortunate if someone could memorize the first seven movements?in a single attempt.

Jian Wushuang’s father, Jian Nantian, watched them once and memorized the first seven, but he failed on the eighth.

“Jian Wushuang has awaked Double First-grade Sword Souls, so he is more talented than his father. It’s possible for him to memorize the eighth.”?Jin Ling thought.

On the side of the sword mountain, the seventh character began to shine.

Though the seventh was more abstruse than the previous six, Jian Wushuang still firmly kept it in mind.

Then the eighth character.

Both Jin Ling and Mu Shan stared at Jian Wushuang, watching him memorize the eighth.

Then the last one.

The ninth, which was the last one, began to shine.

“The ninth movement.” Jin Ling and Mu Shan were full of expectations.

“The most powerful movement!”

“Even at the height of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline, only one person managed to memorize all?of them.”

“However, he was a traitor!”

Buzz~~~A green light flashed on the mountainside, then everything calmed down.

Jian Wushuang was still standing there, with his eyes closed, recalling all the images and memorizing them.

Then he opened his eyes and sighed, with a light flashing in his eyes.

“The Heart-killing Sword Technique really is the most powerful Sword Skill Sword Ancestor created.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He scanned them all once again, and only one word could describe how he was feeling right now.

Awesome!

Jian Wushuang was good at sword principle, so he understood the power of this Sword Skill.

In comparison, the Blood Emptying Technique and Selfless Sword Technique, as powerful as they were, were much weaker than Heart-killing Sword Technique.

The Heart-killing Sword Technique had high requirements.

The first movement required a Saint Realm expert whose comprehension in Slaughter Origin had reached the Pinnacle.

This was the first movement. The other eight movements were even more powerful and had even higher requirements.

“I have memorized all nine movements of the Heart-killing Sword Technique. However, I’m unable to even study the first movement,” Jian Wushuang said with a bitter smile.
