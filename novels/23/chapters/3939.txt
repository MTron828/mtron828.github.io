Chapter 3941: Concerns

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After coming out of the Nine Emperor Pavilion, Jian Wushuang and Demon Dragon Lord flew side by side in the universe void.

“Master, you could have asked the Nine Emperor Pavilion to hire a fourth-or fifth-level Ruler to help you at the cost of a principle true treasure. After all, most fourth-level Rulers, including many fifth-level Rulers, don’t have any principle true treasures. I’m afraid that many fourth-or fifth-level Rulers would be willing to come at the cost of a principle true treasure,” Demon Dragon Lord said.

“You may be right.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“We can invite experts if we ask the Nine Emperor Pavilion to help us. However, our territory is at the edge of the universe. It’s difficult to find a fourth-level Ruler in the nearby Star Fields, let alone a fifth-level Ruler. Therefore, even if the Nine Emperor Pavilion helps us, the experts we invite must be far away from our Star Field. Even if we use the universe passage to teleport, we may not be able to reach this Star Field in a short time.”

“Moreover, even if there are experts who can reach this territory within 1,000 years, I still have many concerns,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

“Concerns?” Demon Dragon Lord was puzzled.

“Demon Dragon, you should know that I haven’t cultivated for long, only 200,000 years. However, in such a short period of time, I have grown step by step. Although I am only a Principles Master, my battle strength is comparable to that of a third-level Ruler. Moreover, I have comprehended a trace of universe principle and can even take out a principle supreme treasure. Tell me, is this something that an ordinary person can do?” Jian Wushuang looked at Demon Dragon Lord.

“It’s true that ordinary people can’t do it. Master’s talent is incredible…” Demon Dragon Lord didn’t finish his words.

“Incredible talent can only be one of the factors,” Jian Wushuang interrupted. “No matter how great your talent is, if you didn’t get such a great opportunity in this Star Field, you wouldn’t be able to reach this level in such a short time. At least, others must think so.”

Demon Dragon Lord was stunned, then he nodded slowly.

Indeed, even he thought that Jian Wushuang was too heaven-defying and too abnormal.

Moreover, such heaven-defying talent could not be achieved purely by relying on his own talent. He must have gotten some great opportunities and fortunes.

“You think so too. Then the problem is, if I really use a principle treasure to invite a fourth or even fifth level Ruler, this Ruler is completely out of my control. Although I invited him, who can guarantee his character?

“Maybe he will think that I have a big secret and directly attack me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes, it’s very possible.” Demon Dragon Lord nodded heavily.

In fact, Demon Dragon Lord himself did not need to be mentioned. If he was not under Jian Wushuang’s control and it was his first time in this Star Field and he knew that Jian Wushuang was an extremely monstrous genius, he would definitely have his eyes on Jian Wushuang, even if he was invited by Jian Wushuang, he would definitely have his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

It was not unreasonable for Jian Wushuang to have such concerns.

“Just the Devil Cloud Star Master alone has put the Divine Beginning Realm in great danger. It’s still on the brink of death. Who knows what will happen if another stronger person comes?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

He did not dare to gamble or place his hopes on an unfamiliar expert he did not know.

Instead of relying on an external expert, he might as well rely on himself.

“Demon Dragon, follow me to Devil Smoke Valley first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Demon Dragon Lord nodded.

The two immediately sped up and soon arrived at Devil Smoke Valley, one of the three Universe Battlefields. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Demon Dragon, wait for me outside Devil Smoke Valley,” Jian Wushuang ordered.

“Yes,” Demon Dragon Lord answered.

Jian Wushuang entered Devil Smoke Valley alone and soon arrived at the deepest part of Devil Smoke Valley.

“Life and Death Realm?”

Jian Wushuang passed the Life and Death Realm, but then he shook his head. “When I left the special space, although I came out of the Life and Death Realm, the entrance to the special space might not be in the Life and Death Realm. Moreover, there is a great danger in the Life and Death Realm. I’d better not take the risk.”

Jian Wushuang did not choose to enter the Temporal where the experts of the Lingyun branch were sleeping through the Life and Death Realm. Instead, he followed the path he had taken to enter the Temporal and went to the unknown area in the Magic Smoke Valley, then, he entered the special Temporal.

The gray void was vast and boundless. There was no light or sky or earth.

There was only a void.

This special Temporal was completely different from the outside world.

Fortunately, it was not Jian Wushuang’s first time in this special Temporal. He was not too surprised by the environment of this Temporal. He directly flew toward the dark void in front of him.

Jian Wushuang flew through the dark void for a long time before he saw the huge floating platform in front of him.

Jian Wushuang was very familiar with that platform.

When he first came to this special Temporal, he was trapped by the 18-terminal formation on the platform for 97,000 years.

In the end, he finally passed the 18-terminal formation with great difficulty and passed the test set up by the Lingyun Star Master. He became an inner star disciple of the Lingyun Star lineage and cultivated the supreme eternal secret skill.

At that time, Jian Wushuang had met Wind Devil, a top expert from the Lingyun Star lineage, in this special space.

Wind Devil was an extremely powerful supreme expert. However, he had been seriously injured in the battle and had been sleeping in this special space.

When Jian Wushuang had left this special space, Wind Devil had said that if he encountered any trouble in the future, he could come to this special space to seek help.

Jian Wushuang came here to ask for help.

“Eh?”

As soon as Jian Wushuang approached the huge platform, he was immediately attracted by the scene on the platform.

On the platform, a young man wearing armor and with an evil face was waving a golden long spear while fighting with six human-shaped statues.

The aura of this young man was obviously that of a Principles Master, and he had reached the sixth realm of the Void Realm. His spear skills were not bad, but it was a pity that his spear skills were not a match for the six human-shaped statues, in the battle, he was completely overwhelmed by the six human-shaped statues.

Soon, the young man was defeated and retreated to the center of the high platform.

At this time, he noticed Jian Wushuang, who had appeared in the void near the high platform.
