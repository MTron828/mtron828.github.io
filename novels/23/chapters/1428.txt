Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation, the starting price is twenty million Chaos Gems. No increment should be lesser than one million. The auction starts now!” The lady in the red robe announced straightaway.

The entire auction was suddenly bustling.

“The starting price is twenty million Chaos Gems?” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

One must know that his Royal Ancient God’s blood essence was only twenty-three million Chaos Gems.

“Twenty-five million Chaos Gems!”

“Thirty million Chaos Gems!”

Merely two bids had kicked the price of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation to thirty million Chaos Gems.

Jian Wushuang’s face instantly grew grave.

“The Chaos Gem I had earlier is allocated to purchase the first-rate bloodline clans’ blood essence. Now, I only have the twenty-three million Chaos Gems that I made from auctioning the drop of Royal Ancient God’s blood essence. It is obviously not enough,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, “I still have another two drops of Royal Ancient God’s blood essence. Even if I sold them to Star Pavilion, it’d only be worth thirty million Chaos Gems. Add it to the twenty-three million Chao Gem earlier… I have a total of fifty-three million!”

Jian Wushuang was determined and he immediately shouted.

“Fifty-three million Chaos Gem!”

Jian Wushuang shouted the amount that he could pay straightaway.

From the original thirty million Chaos Gems, it suddenly got bumped up to fifty-three million. He was obviously determined to win!

Soon after the price was shouted…

“Fifty-five million Chaos Gems!”

There was another deep voice opposite Jian Wushuang’s independent room.

In that independent room, a cold-looking man who was more than two meters tall and brawny in size was seated. His eyes were twinkling with a gem-like brightness, “I have reached the bottleneck of comprehension in Reincarnation Doctrine. The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation might be sufficient for me to break through the bottleneck. I don’t care about just fifty over million Chaos Gems!”

The cold-looking man also seemed to be determined to win.

When the price was overtaken, Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted and he felt helpless.

If he were to shout another price, he could pay it, but he would have to trade in his precious treasures in exchange, such as Blood-killing Plate Armor, Blood Mountain Sword and so on.

These treasures were important to Jian Wushuang. He couldn’t just give them up in exchange for other treasure.

Just as Jian Wushuang was becoming deeply distressed, the elderly in the purple robe next to him, Tian Shi spoke, “Mister Jian Wushuang, you look like you really want to get the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang didn’t hide it, “The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation is very useful to me. It’s a pity that I can’t fork our more Chaos Gems, otherwise…”

“As long as you want it, we of Star Pavilion can figure it out for you,” Tian Shi said.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked towards Tian Shi.

“Mister, don’t forget that Star Pavilion is under the control of Lineage of Star and you are a disciple of Star Palace. Star Pavilion, naturally, has to provide you the greatest service,” Tian Shi smiled faintly, “Mister, please hold on. Let me talk to Elderly Song about this.”

Elderly Song, the deacon elderly from Lineage of Star. Star Pavilions around Snake Soul City were all under the jurisdiction of Elderly Song.

In just an instant…

“Mister, Elderly Song mentioned that you can transfer a million Chaos Gem from Star Pavilion. Then, pay it back slowly. If it were to be more than a million, you’ll have to apply directly to Hall Master Yuan and receive approval from Hall Master Yuan,” Tian Shi said.

“A million Chaos Gems? That’s enough!” Jian Wushuang was overjoyed and he quickly shouted, “Sixty million Chaos Gem!”

In the room opposite, the brawny cold-looking man creased his eyebrows and followed, “Sixty-five million!”

“Seventy million!”

Just as the cold-looking man called, Jian Wushuang shouted another price again.

The moment he shouted the price, the auction gasped.

Seventy million was definitely an astronomical figure to a Universe God. Even to a Real God… Any ordinary Real God would find it difficult to pay this amount of Chaos Gem.

“Seventy million?”

The brawny cold-looking man grew distressed, “Although the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation it precious, seventy million Chaos Gem isn’t a small figure.”

The cold-looking man suddenly spoke after a moment of silence, “I wonder which Real God is opposite, I wonder if you could spare consideration to me, An Yuan.”

“An Yuan?”

It suddenly stirred a commotion at the auction.

“Real God An Yuan, it’s him?” Tian Shi was shocked too.

“Real God An Yuan is very famous?” Jian Wushuang looked at Tian Shi.

“Quite famous,” Tian Shi nodded, “He is from a great influence in Star land, the second elderly of the great influence. Not only does he possess great influence, but his power is also impressive. It is beyond any ordinary Real God’s.”

“He spoke now for you to reconsider. If you were an ordinary Real God, you might stop fighting over the painting with him. However, you are a disciple of Star Palace. Although Real God An Yuan has a strong background, he’s nothing to you. You can totally ignore him.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

In Star land, Lineage of Star was the definite overlord. As a disciple of Star Palace, which was the core of Lineage of Star, he wasn’t someone any ordinary Real God could offend.

“Although Real God An Yuan wouldn’t dare to do anything to me, there’s no need for me to offend him,” Jian Wushuang smiled. Then, he spoke, “Real God An Yuan, I am Jian Wushuang from Star Palace. The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation is very useful to me. So, excuse me.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated at the auction and many gasped in surprise.

“Star Palace?”

“Disciple of Star Palace!”

“Disciple from the core of Lineage of Star, the genius of the geniuses, such a favored man has joined this auction too?”

Everyone was astonished. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Even Real God An Yuan was surprised.

“He’s a disciple of Star Palace?

Real God An Yuan muttered to himself as he shook his head, “Disciple of Star Palace, although his power might not be at my level now, once he grows, he is destined to be stronger than I am. I can’t offend such a figure. Forget it, it isn’t definite that the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation could help me break through the bottleneck. As the disciple of Star Palace wants it, I shall let him have it.”

“Jian Wushuang, I give up the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.”

Real God An Yuan said.

“Thank you.”

Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

Real God An Yuan didn’t continue to fight with Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang got the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation with seventy million Chaos Gems.
