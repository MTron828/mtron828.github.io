Chapter 353: Master Jiu Xiu

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Inside the Holy Emperor Palace.

The Palace Master and many Elders of Holy Emperor Palace were waiting quietly in a fine loft.

Waiting for Second Holy Master’s triumphant return.

“Second Holy Master is handling it personally, so Jian Wushuang will die even if he had three heads and six arms.”

They were all confident in Second Holy Master.

Second Holy Master reached the “Pinnacle” hundreds of years ago. He was strong enough to be ranked in the top 5 on the Nanyang Continent. To kill someone at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm is as easy as winking. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even if it was Wine Master, he couldn’t survive Second Holy Master’s attack.

“It’s been quite a while now, so Second Holy Master should be back soon.” The Holy Emperor Palace’s Master said, casually.

At this moment, they noticed a Flowing Light rushing toward them.

“He’s back!”

“It’s Second Holy Master.”

Their faces broke into smiles. However, once the Flowing Light approached and they clearly saw his current state, their smiles froze.

Second Holy Master looked pale. His clothing was torn, like an old rag, and he was covered in blood. But the most notable issue was, his legs were cut off.

“What happened?” They were all astonished.

They thought no one but the mysterious Monarch of Tang Dynasty on the Nanyang Continent could injure him so heavily.

“Did he fall into a trap? Could he have been surrounded by the Alchemy School or some other experts?” They thought, walking towards him.

“Second Holy Master, what...” Palace Master was about to ask.

“Shut up.”

Second Holy Master shouted and glanced at them with cold eyes. He was too impatient and didn’t want to waste any more words. Instead, he went directly to the Giant Mountain where the other three Holy Masters were.

The Palace Master and the Elders of Holy Emperor Palace looked at each other in confusion. None of them understood what just happened.

Soon, in an abode of the Giant Mountain, Second Holy Master met with the other three Holy Masters.

They were shocked when they saw Second Holy Master.

“Second brother, what happened?” A silver-haired elder asked in a deep voice.

He was the strongest elder in Holy Emperor Palace, First Holy Master, who was also the key stand in Holy Emperor Palace!

Second Holy Master was strong enough to be ranked in the top 5 on the Nanyang Continent, but First Holy Master was recognized as the strongest, excluding the Monarch of Tang Dynasty. Besides that, he was much stronger than the Alchemy School’s expert, who was ranked 3rd.

He was also very old.

“We, we are in trouble.” Second Holy Master was in a surly mood as he explained what he had experienced.

After hearing the story, they all frowned.

“Jian Wushuang made a breakthrough, again?” First Holy Master asked.

“Yes.” Second Holy Master nodded, “Not only has his strength improved a lot, he split my magic weapon and cutting off my legs with only one sword move. On top of that, his body became so hard that my Scarlet Thunderbolt only left a scratch on him. It’s incredible.”

“Big brother, I was much more overwhelmed while facing him than you. If it was a one-to-one fight, I’m afraid you wouldn’t be his opponent either.”

Hearing that, First Holy Master’s face fell.

They had cultivated together for years, so they clearly understood each other’s strength. He knew, though he was stronger than Second Holy Master, it was impossible for him to split his magic weapon and cut off his legs with only one sword move.

But Jian Wushuang did it.

Even more terrifying than that though, was the strength of his body.

He believed what Second Holy Master had said. Jian Wushuang was stronger than him.

“The worst part is his age.” Second Holy Master gnashed his teeth and said, “He is only 22 years old. If he is given more time, I can’t imagine what will happen.”

His words silenced all three of them.

It was true!

The biggest threat was his age, he was young but he improved so quickly.

“Jian Wushuang.” First Holy Master narrowed his eyes and said, “I never expected he would be harder to deal with than his father!”

“Let’s go to see Master Jiu Xiu!”

Second Holy Master and the other two were surprised, then they nodded heavily.

They quickly arrived at the top of Giant Mountain.

Then, they stopped at an exquisite loft where the door was closed.

“Master Jiu Xiu!”

They saluted at the door.

“What’s wrong?”

A cold voice sounded. Judging from the voice, it was a young man.

“There is a problem.” First Holy Master immediately explained everything to him.

“Jian Wushuang? A son from the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor.” The young man was in high spirits as he continued, “He killed Seven Saint Realm experts easily even before his breakthrough, then defeated a Pinnacle Saint Realm expert after his breakthrough. Hehe, good.”

“Tell me all the details of the fight.”

“Yes.” Second Holy Master nodded, then he recounted everything to him with respect.

He told him every detail, from Jian Wushuang’s five Killing Moves, to his near-death, then his breakthrough and his explosive strength.

However, he was interrupted in the middle...

“You said, two spectral images appeared behind him when he brandished his sword, didn’t you?” The young man in the loft interrupted him.

“Yes.” Second Holy Master nodded.

“Ha ha!”

He laughed, “Sword Soul Phantom, he had two Sword Soul Phantoms, Double Sword Souls!”

“This son of the Sword Ancestor Bloodline is really great. Jian Wushuang, the son of Jian Nantian. He gathered Sword Souls too, but it seems he is even more talented than his father!”

“I really want his two Sword Souls!”

“Where is Jian Wushuang now?”

“I don’t know.” Second Holy Master shook his head.

It was true. Previously, he was able to track Jian Wushuang because of the Blood Soul Mark. However, the Blood Soul Mark disappeared after he made his breakthrough. With that, he couldn’t track Jian Wushuang anymore.

“You don’t know?” His voice was sullen. But then his voice changed, “Never mind, even if we don’t look for him, he will come looking for us soon enough.”

“Okay, I understand. You may leave now.”

“Yes. Your Highness.” The Four Holy Masters left.

In the loft, the young man murmured to himself, “Jian Wushuang, Double Sword Souls, interesting!”
