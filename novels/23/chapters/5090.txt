Chapter 5091 Strike While the Opponent Was Vulnerable

In the face of the overwhelming dark purple brilliance that blotted out the sky, Nan Xuan leaped into action, soaring towards Jian Wushuang.

His Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens, though already somewhat tattered, still emitted a brilliant azure light, untarnished and immaculate.

At the back of his robe, a fist-sized crack had formed, perfectly matching the sword scar on his chest.

"Little Friend, let me help you." Nan Xuan leaped over with a smile on his face.

Jian Wushuang was taken aback; he hadn't expected Nan Xuan to arrive. "Why have you come? Didn't I ask you all to leave quickly?"

Nan Xuan smiled, "Leaving would be too boring. I also want to see what kind of entity this fellow truly is!"

Jian Wushuang knew Nan Xuan's unyielding character; he couldn't be dissuaded. He could only remain silent.

After enduring a brutal battle of unparalleled proportions, the entire southwestern region of the Great Mi Heaven had been completely annihilated.

As far as the eye could see, everything had turned into eternal nothingness.

The aura emanating from the shattered foundation of Changfu's Immortal Source had not yet dissipated, but the black-robed figure had already revived.

He was a true nightmare, remaining unscathed through his appearance, the battles with the Yan Immortals, and even the life-and-death struggle with the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals. It exceeded all imagination.

Perhaps, this black-robed figure was an Emperor-to-be?!

This thought was quickly dismissed by Jian Wushuang. In the Boundless Sea, he had encountered two Emperors-to-be.

One was Emperor-to-be Hei Yun who had devoured the Grand Yan Immortal's fate energy.

The other was Yu Yao, who sacrificed thousands of Grand Yan Immortals to ultimately become an Emperor-to-be.

They were terrifying beings who could not be underestimated, capable of overwhelming everything with a wave of their hands. In a certain sense, Emperor-to-be were on par with Emperors.

Jian Wushuang had experienced the terror of the Emperor-to-be in the Endless Sea, where their overwhelming aura was beyond imagination.

Although the current black-robed figure was nearly Immortal, impervious even to the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, Jian Wushuang could still sense a gap between him and an Emperor-to-be.

This gap was crystal clear.

For a moment, he thought of the Peak Grand Yan Immortals.

Surpassing the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, they represented the ultimate realm of the Grand Yan Immortal realm.

Only Peak Grand Yan Immortals could explain why Changfu had sacrificed himself and still could not harm the black-robed figure.

However, even a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal was far from an opponent Jian Wushuang could contend with, let alone a Peak Grand Yan Immortal.

So, at this moment, he stood here, essentially offering himself up for death.

Even if he had Three Daos and his Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body, which had become more refined, he couldn't withstand a Peak Grand Yan Immortal.

As a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, Nan Xuan was also offering himself up for death, incapable of inflicting any significant damage on the black-robed figure.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang was puzzled. Why did the Heaven-Patterned Bone Armor contain such a terrifying entity within it?

Could it be that the black-robed figure was guarding or imprisoning the hidden content within?

This puzzled him and made the Heaven-Patterned Bone Armor even more enigmatic.

Facing these two figures, the black-robed figure slowed down, and the face beneath the large hood seemed to be contemplating something.

Jian Wushuang quickly took out two Emperor-grade pills and handed them to Nan Xuan. Jian Wushuang also immediately consumed several Emperor-grade pills.

This was to unleash the most terrifying power within a short period.

He did not hope to defeat the figure in black robes; he only wanted to buy time for the Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo and his disciples to escape.

"Damn old man, I'll settle the score for the previous sword today!"

Nan Xuan said with a deep voice, and behind him, another giant sun that covered the heavens and the earth was formed!

The golden radiance was dazzling and unbearable to look at.

The aura of a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal surged at this moment.

Nan Xuan held a sword hilt that had just taken shape, which he had casually pulled out from Sword Mountain earlier.

Endless crimson-golden brilliance shone behind him, the giant sun radiant, containing nine crimson-golden rays, like a genuine golden wheel, flowing slowly behind him.

This was Nan Xuan's most powerful strike, filled with an unstoppable determination.

At this moment, the golden wheel sun burst with a dazzling golden radiance, illuminating the boundless void.

A total of nine crimson-golden rays, using the sword hilt as a medium, erupted violently, transforming into nine hundred thousand-foot True Sword Shadows, slashing towards the black-robed figure!

Jian Wushuang also made his move, wielding the Invisible Sword with brilliant divine patterns, easily severing the newly formed heavenly order and pressing down.

The black-robed figure stood still in place and did not attempt to dodge as before, instead choosing to face it head-on.

Endless annihilation and void tremors, the violent sound waves shattered once again.

Because the power was too swift and fierce, the sword hilt in Nan Xuan's hand couldn't withstand it and shattered into nothingness.

But his ultimate strike still landed on the black-robed figure's body.

Boom!

A wave of golden radiance erupted, and at that moment, it actually cleanly severed his left shoulder!

Following closely, Jian Wushuang also almost effortlessly severed the figure's right arm.

Dark purple misty threads spewed from the black robe.

This scene shocked Nan Xuan; he never thought he could sever one of the black robe's arms!

You should know that the black-robed figure was a terrifying existence that could erase a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal with a wave of his hand.

Jian Wushuang was also stunned; he could feel that he had indeed severed both arms.

The originally nearly indestructible figure, at this moment, had its arms cut off and did not immediately regenerate but released dark purple misty threads.

Jian Wushuang quickly realized the situation, gave Nan Xuan a quick glance, and then released his Sword Dao.

Wushaung Sword Dao, the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent, second move.

River.

Jian Wushuang thrust the Invisible Sword stabbed into the figure's chest with all his might. The majestic celestial river, with Jian Wushuang as the origin and the Invisible Sword as the medium, swept toward the figure.

This strike was delivered with full force, with every ounce of his strength poured into it.

At the same time, Nan Xuan unleashed his supreme Yan power, slamming it into the face of the cloaked figure.

Both of them understood the principle of seizing the opportunity to strike while the opponent was vulnerable, so they exerted every ounce of their strength.

Boom!

In an immeasurable explosion, the already fragmented body of the black-robed figure was completely reduced to powder, shattering the void itself!

An unparalleled detonation spread across trillions of miles, causing the Sancun Mountain Heaven continent, which were already as fragile as a leaf in a boat, to teeter on the brink of collapse at any moment.

Standing at the edge of the shattered continent, Prince Jiu slowly lowered his arm that had been raised in front of him. His face was pale, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

Because he saw that figure, that mere Yan Immortal, accomplish something that was fundamentally impossible.

An existence that couldn't be destroyed even by Changfu was now reduced to dust by Jian Wushuang's blade.

Indescribable emotions swirled in his eyes.VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience
