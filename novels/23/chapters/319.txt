Chapter 320: Destroy! Kill! Eliminate!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?”

“Wedding?”

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were both startled.

“This is the invitation card that Ye Chen sent to all the sects. You can have a look,” Wang Yuan took out an invitation card.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan gave it a quick browse.

Sure enough, it was an invitation for the experts of all the clans to attend the wedding ceremony in ten days.

“Little sister is marrying Ye Chen? Is she doing this willingly?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I suppose she is.” Wang Yuan nodded. “You guys may not know yet, but little sister is an orphan. Her clan was massacred when she was very little, and she was taken by the enemy. The Ye Chen happened to pass by and rescued her, and even avenged her by eliminating the people that killed her family.”

“Ever since then, little sister has been with Ye Chen. Before she met us, she considered Ye Chen as her only family, and no one could take his place from little sister.”

“So if Ye Chen said that he wanted to marry her, she would probably not reject him.”

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan both frowned.

Since little sister was willing to perform the wedding without being threatened, they could not do anything other than send their blessings.

“If that’s all, I wouldn’t say anything, as long as he treats little sister well with all his heart. However, I found out something strange not long ago,” Wang Yuan said solemnly.

“Something strange? What is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I performed some investigations and found out that the force that destroyed little sister’s whole clan had been in contact with Ice Nether Valley previously,” Wang Yuan said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan looked at Wang Yuan immediately.

“I looked into it and found out that Blissful Island, the power that eliminated little sister’s clan, had been in close contact with Ice Nether Valley, and both little sister’s clan and Blissful Island were in a middle-sized empire. Why would a person with such a prominent status like Ye Chen go there for no reason and happen to rescue little sister?” Wang Yuan narrated.

“I felt that this was strange at that time, and so I asked my people to investigate it. I finally received some information a few days ago.”

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“The result is...Blissful Island was an affiliated power with Ice Nether Valley. It was Ice Nether Valley that ordered Blissful Island to eliminate little sister’s clan, and the one who gave the order was probably Master Ye Chen!” Wang Yuan said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were both astonished.

“Is this true?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold immediately.

“I confirmed it over and over, and it was really an order given by?Ice Nether Valley,” Wang Yuan said.

“As far as I know, our little sister has a very special body attribute and can achieve great things. Ye Chen may be interested in this, so he asked Blissful Island to slaughter little sister’s family and saved little sister?himself. He also performed revenge for her to make her deeply grateful to him so that she would obey anything he said. What a good strategy!”

“And what it cost him was not much——just Blissful Island, a little force.”

Jian Wushuang’s and Yang Zaixuan’s eyes turned cold in an instant.

“Brother Yuan, do you have any evidence of this?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course I have the evidence,” Wang Yuan smiled coldly, and then he waved his hand to reveal a stack of information reports gathered by Alchemy School.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan looked through these reports, and Jian Wushuang’s face became sullen instantly.

There was indeed actual evidence. It was confirmed that Ice Nether Valley gave the order to eliminate little sister’s clan, and that Ye Chen was definitely involved with it.

“Finding out this matter is the reason why I called and informed you,” Wang Yuan said.

“Little sister doesn’t know this, does she?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“Of course she doesn’t. How could she want to marry Ye Chen if she knew this?” Wang Yuan said.

“Third brother, what are you going to do?” Wang Yuan looked over to Jian Wushuang.

“What am I going to do? It’s simple, I will stop the wedding and kill Ye Chen, if Ice Nether Valley stands in my way, I will eliminate it too!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was frozen with a frightening coldness in his eyes.

Besides his father Jian Nantian, Jian Wushuang cared for his brothers and sister most in this world.

Jian Wushuang regarded his little sister Su Rou as his biological sister, so how could him let her be bullied like this?

“I’m also going to follow you,” Yang Zaixuan nodded, also with great coldness in his eyes.

“He-he, we think the same. We brothers must cause chaos on the wedding ten days later for little sister,” Wang Yuan smiled, and stretched out his fist.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan looked at each other, and then also put forward their fists. The three fists bumped together.

...

In an attic in Ditian Prefecture.

“You are planning to destroy the wedding in Ice Nether Valley in ten days? And you want my help?” Wine Master raised his eyebrows, and looked over at Jian Wushuang and his brothers.

“Yes, we really hope you can give us a hand, Master!” Yang Zaixuan said solemnly.

Wang Yuan and Jian Wushuang also looked at Wine Master with expectation.

After all, Ice Nether Valley was one of the three valleys in Nanyang Continent, which was even more powerful than Wilderness Sword Sect and Daluo Heaven Sect. Only Alchemy School and Holy Emperor Palace could possibly defeat it in the whole Nanyang Continent. So it was impossible to cause trouble at the Sect with merely Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.

And Wang Yuan... Although Wang Yuan was the young master of the Alchemy School, there were too many restrictions in Alchemy School, so he couldn’t bring many experts.

Therefore, they could only use their own influence to invite some experts, and the first person they invited was Wine Master.

Holding a pot of wine and swirling it slowly, the Wine Master murmured,” Ice Nether Valley——one of the three valleys, and the strongest of them, is not easy to be messed. But it will really be interesting if we can stop the wedding and humiliate them.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“So you agree to help us?” Wang Yuan quickly asked.

Wine Master smiled slightly, but looked over to Yang Zaixuan, “My disciple has never asked anything from?me since he called me Master, so how can I say no? However, Ice Nether Valley has great strength, so only counting on us to create chaos at the wedding is not enough. We have to find other people for help.”

No sooner had Wine Master finished his words...Whoosh! Whoosh! Two figures suddenly appeared in the attic.

One of the two figures was a strong and handsome middle-aged man, and the other was a woman with a natural and graceful appearance.

“Wind and Rain Immortals? ”

Looking at the two people who appeared in the attic, a slight smile emerged on Wine Master’s face.

“Wine Master,” the middle-aged man and the graceful woman said.
