——

In the vast void of the Blood Wave Realm.

Jian Wushuang and the other three slowly moved forward. Along the way, except for the first collision with the Saint Realm of destruction, they encountered many experts, but they did not fight each other.

“According to our speed, we will arrive at the center of the Blood Wave Realm in half a day. There are many experts there, and all the top Immortal Saints who enter the Blood Wave Realm will gather there. Before the Blood Wave Token is born, there will be a period of peace. During this period, many Immortal Saints will spar with each other and challenge each other, especially the experts on the True Saint List. Many people will fight to challenge them!”

“Di Hao, when you fought with Thunder God previously, you clearly had the upper hand. In terms of strength, you should be able to rank in the top five of the True Saint Ranking. When you reach the Central Region, don’t you want to challenge those who are ranked in the top five of the True Saint Ranking?” Qian Hongzi looked at Di Hao with interest.

The central region of the Blood Wave Realm had too many experts gathered. Naturally, all kinds of challenges became very frequent.

“There’s no rush. If there’s a chance, I’ll take action.” Di Hao said coldly.

These words caused Qian Hongzi’s brows to furrow.

It was very clear that Di Hao also wanted to fight for a spot on the True Saint Rankings. Moreover, he indeed had the strength to do so.

“Qian Hongzi, you’re an unrivaled True Saint after all. Moreover, your strength isn’t ordinary. Don’t you want to get a spot on the True Saint Rankings? Even if you’re ranked last, you can still be famous throughout the world, right?” Yue Yu teased.

“Everyone on the True Saint List is a monster. I don’t have the ability to challenge them.” Qian Hongzi shook his head.

The six people were talking casually as they flew. The atmosphere was good.

At this moment…

“Well, is there someone?” Qian Hongzi suddenly raised his head.

Jian Wushuang had also seen five figures standing in the void in front of him.

“Five people. The leader…is Su Xie of the Illusory Moon Sect!” Qian Hongzi’s eyes focused.

“Su Xie?” Jian Wushuang immediately recalled the information he had read about Su Xie.

Su Xie was ranked 24th on the True Saint List. He used a long whip as a weapon and had a strange whip technique. He had once easily defeated two Invincible Saints by himself.

“Although he is ranked 24th and is considered to be at the bottom of the True Saint List, as long as he is ranked on the True Saint List, he will be extremely powerful,” Jian Wushuang thought.

“They are coming,” Qian Hongzi said.

Jian Wushuang immediately saw that Su Xie and the other three were already rushing toward him.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang and the other three immediately stopped, but they did not retreat.

After all, the Temporal Temple did not have any conflict with the Illusory Moon Sect. Moreover, the five members of the Illusory Moon Sect were obviously much weaker than the Temporal Temple.

Naturally, the Temporal Temple did not fear them. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Su Xie, what are you doing?” Di Hao’s voice was cold as he looked at Su Xie and the others.

“Hehe, nothing. I just came to say hello to everyone from the Temporal Temple.” Su Xie gave a strange smile. As she spoke, her eyes moved slightly, she looked at Jian Wushuang and the others.

After a while, her eyes were completely focused on Jian Wushuang.

“If I’m not mistaken, that’s Heavenly Sword Marquis, who was famous in the Divine Beginning World 300 years ago, right?” Su Xie asked.

“It’s me.” Jian Wushuang nodded and did not deny his identity.

“Tsk, tsk. 300 years ago, you were able to kill a rank seven True Saint with a rank four True Saint Realm. Now that you’ve reached the rank six True Saint Realm, you actually dare to wander in the Blood Wave Realm. You really have guts,” Su Xie praised.

“Su Xie, if you have anything to say, just say it. If you have nothing to say, then don’t block our way.” Qian Hongzi said in a low voice.

“Of course, of course. We’ll leave immediately.” As Su Xie said this, her body also seemed to be about to retreat. However, as she retreated, a fierce light flashed in her eyes. “Attack!”

With the word ‘attack’, Daoist Master Bing, who had long since prepared behind Su Xie, immediately took out a round plate.

Buzz, buzz, a majestic energy wave burst out from the disk. In an instant, a huge cyan magic array swept out in all directions, covering the entire space and time.

In the blink of an eye, the space and time where Jian Wushuang and the others were were sealed.

“Space and time sealed?”

“Magic formation?”

“No!”

Jian Wushuang and the others’ expressions changed.

“Su Xie, are you courting death?” Di Hao’s voice was cold.

“Courting death? Hehe, I’m afraid we won’t be the ones to die.” Su Xie sneered, as his laughter fell, several figures rushed over from both sides of the void and appeared beside Su Xie in an instant.

Seeing these figures, Di Hao, Qian Hongzi, Jian Wushuang, and the others all had ugly expressions on their faces.

“Thunder God!”

“Saint Destruction Realm!”

They were the people from the Saint Destruction Realm led by Thunder God and Wan Xuan.

Together with Su Xie and the other five experts from the Illusionary Moon Sect, a total of 14 experts appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the others.

“Everyone from the Temporal Temple, we meet again.” Thunder God’s body was covered with dark purple thunderbolts, and an endless violent aura spread out. His cold eyes also swept over Jian Wushuang and the others.

“That person is Heavenly Sword Marquis, right?” Wan Xuan stared at Jian Wushuang with a sinister smile. “I’m quite curious about him to be able to make Heavenly Sword Marquis master give such an order.”

“He’s going to be a dead man soon. What’s there to be curious about?” Thunder God smiled.

The two of them talked to each other without paying any attention to the six people from the Temporal Temple.

The six people from the Temporal Temple were looking at each other with serious expressions.

“There are 14 Immortal Saints in total, including six Invincible Saints and eight Peak Saints. Thunder God, Wan Xuan, and Su Xie are experts on the True Saint List. We’re in big trouble!”

“I knew that the Destruction Saint Realm wouldn’t let this go so easily. It seems like it’s true!”

“The gap in strength is so big. What should we do?”

“What can we do? The space-time has been completely sealed, and the array used to seal the space-time is extremely powerful. I’m afraid that even Di Hao might not be able to break the space-time seal with his full strength. We have no choice but to fight. With the strength of the six of us, even if the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusionary Moon Sky Sect join hands, it won’t be so easy to take us down.”

“Yes.”

The six of them looked at each other and reached an agreement.

“Everyone.”

At this moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly spoke.

Di Hao, Qian Hongzi, and the others immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold as he said, “Kill Mo Xin First!”

Di Hao and the others were stunned, but they immediately understood.
