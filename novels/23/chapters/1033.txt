Chapter 1034: Making a Move

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As blood moon level killers, both Army Saber and Rakshasa possessed Peak Rank Three Dao Master’s battle strength. They were also considered as one of the most powerful among their peers.

It was said that both of them had killed other Peak Rank Three Dao Masters, and even though it was a joint operation, it clearly showed their ability.

Perhaps it was due to the fact that the Blood Saber Organization knew that its sole responsibility would be to tie up the two Rank Three Dao Masters protecting Dao Master Nine Sword that it sent them to their client; they were known to be experts at tying up their opponents.

“Both of you should know about your task by know, right?” Jian Wushuang asked as he looked at the two killers.

“Yes,” replied Army Saber and Rakshasa, both of them slightly nodding.

“That’s good. I hope that when executing the mission, both of you will do as I say entirely,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“Of course,” Army Saber said. “You’re our client. Of course, we would listen to your orders, but only within the limits of our operation. If it falls outside of our mission, we can’t help you.”

“Alright,” said Jian Wushuang as he nodded.

After the three had reached a consensus, the skinny elder spoke up. “I’ve already sent people out to keep an eye on Dao Master Nine Sword. They’ll report to me once he has any movement.”

“Then we shall wait,” replied Jian Wushuang. “The Emperor Heart City is full of people and experts. We should strike after he leaves the city.”

“Right,” agreed the two killers, nodding.

Jian Wushuang spent the next three days waiting patiently in the secret chamber.

“Dao Master Nine Sword is leaving,” news came from the skinny elder.

“Finally?” replied Jian Wushuang as his lips cracked into a smile. It was even chillier than the edge of a sharp knife.

The very next moment, he set off along with the two killers.

Indeed, Dao Master Nine Sword had left the Emperor Heart City and traveled in a straight direction. After half a day’s journey, they arrived before an area known to be a place where an advanced population resided.

This population was known as the Bone Clan.

“500 years ago, the Bone Clan used trickery which led our Ancient Monster Clan to suffer heavy losses. It was said that they covered up the matter extremely well, but our clan members still managed to uncover their plot. When I traveled out, the Third Holy Master had instructed me to exterminate them on my way back,” said Dao Master Nine Sword in his customary refined manner. His gaze, though, which was fixed on the quarters of the Bone Clan, was chilly.

“Let’s go.”

Jiu Xiu smiled briefly before he led the other two Rank Three Dao Masters to dash straight into the inner sanctum of the Bone Clan.

Their auras were incredibly great, and they did not bother to conceal them. Many experts of the Bone Clan immediately sensed their presence once all three of them appeared in the Void above the quarters of the Bone Clan.

“Who’s there?”

“Halt immediately!”

Shouts rang out one after another, and only after a short while, dozens of figures rose into the Void. All of them were Dao Masters, and their leader was a burly middle-aged man with purple hair.

He was the Clan Leader, but at this moment, he was staring at the three people in front of him with a straight face.

“You are…” the burly man began to question them.

“Nine Sword from the Ancient Monster Clan,” replied Dao Master Nine Sword nonchalantly.

“The Ancient Monster Clan?” replied the purple-haired man. His expression, along with many experts of the Bone Clan, immediately changed, but they quickly composed themselves.

“So it’s the famous Dao Master Nine Sword of the Ancient Monster Clan. May I ask what brings you here today?” asked the Clan Leader.

“Nothing much. It’s just that I find your Bone Clan a nuisance and wish to destroy it.” Dao Master Nine Sword’s tone was extremely calm, but it sounded like thunder to the people of this clan.

“Make your move!”

Dao Master Nine Sword did not waste his time with unnecessary words. With a wave of his hand, the two experts behind him, who had been waiting for their chance to strike, leapt out in an instant.

Their terrible auras seeped out and engulfed the entire Bone Clan, immediately causing a disturbance amongst its people.

“That’s not good!”

“Peak Rank Three Dao Masters, and two of them to boot?”

The expression of the burly man immediately changed. “Quick, stop them, stop both of them!” he kept bellowing.

Many of Dao Masters from the Bone Clan began making their move. The purple-haired Clan Leader had also immediately rushed forth to confront his opponents.

In an instant, all of the top-tier experts in the Bone Clan were engaged in combat with the two Peak Rank Three Dao Masters. Even so, it was a one-sided contest.

The Bone Clan was just an ordinary advanced population. Even though it was stronger than the Rock Demon and Black Python Clan, it was not by much. There were only dozens of Dao Masters in the clan, and their two strongest experts were just at the advanced level and entry level of Rank Three respectively.

Even though dozens of Dao Masters were now joining forces against the two Peak Rank Three Dao Masters, they did not have many openings to strike.

The Bone Clan was entirely engulfed with chaos once the battle began.

As all of this happened, three figures were floating in the Void not far from where the Bone Clan resided. They stood there gazing from afar, taking in all of the disturbance happening in the Bone Clan.

“Previously, I was curious as to what Dao Master Nine Sword was doing in the Bone Clan. It turns out that he wants to exterminate this clan. Hehe, seems like we’re in luck,” said the lovely-looking Rakshasa with a slight smile.

“Given the ability of the three from the Ancient Monster Clan, they’ll make short work of the Bone Clan. That said, there are a few experts in the Bone Clan, and they’re bound to make some last-ditch effort. Even though it will not cost those three very much, it’ll be enough to drain a considerable amount of Spiritual Power from them. We’ll strike after they’ve wiped out the Bone Clan; it’ll help us greatly,” said Army Saber solemnly.

“It’s not necessary to wait until then. We act now,” said Jian Wushuang unexpectedly in a low tone. He was standing in the middle of the two killers.

“What?” they exclaimed, looking at Jian Wushuang in amazement.

Waiting for Dao Master Nine Sword and his men to wipe out the Bone Clan before making their move was definitely the best option, but Jian Wushuang…

“You’re indeed quite merciful, Sir,” said Rakshasa with a slight smile.

“Let’s move,” replied Jian Wushuang, his tone extremely cold.

The two killers exchanged one look with each other and nodded slightly.

Jian Wushuang was their client, and naturally, they had to follow his instructions.

“Our task is to hold the two Peak Rank Three Dao Masters up. As for Dao Master Nine Sword, well, you’ve to handle him by yourself,” said Army Saber. In the next instant, the two killers had drifted waif-like away and they arrived at the battlefield very quickly.

The space in the Void above the Bone Clan’s residential area had already burst open, and the sight was terrible to bear.

Dozens of Dao Masters from the Bone Clan were joining forces and trying their best to stop the two Peak Rank Three Dao Masters from the Ancient Monster Clan. As for Dao Master Nine Sword, he had not even made a single move.

Even so, the Bone Clan was hanging on to their survival by a thin thread. Within a short period, four of their Dao Masters had already been slain.

At this very moment, two waif-like figures dashed straight into the battlefield.
