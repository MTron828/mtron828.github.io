Chapter 3573: Universe Origin of Sword Principle

In a flash, Jian Wushuang had lost contact with the outside world for a full 80,000 years.

He had also been trapped on the high platform for a full 80,000 years.

30,000 years ago, Jian Wushuang collapsed the sword world on his own and began to re-establish his sword principle with the universe as the core. Because he had many understandings and understandings of sword principle before, he was naturally familiar with the way to re-establish his sword principle now.

During the past 30,000 years, his sword principle had been improving rapidly and had never stopped.

Until now...

On the high platform, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and slowly stood up. However, the moment he stood up, an invisible sword essence stretched out and instantly triggered the surrounding universe, endless sword principle origin surged toward him.

He was standing there, but he felt that he had become the core of the sword principle origin. With a thought, the sword principle origin of the universe could be used by him. With a simple action, he could immediately absorb a large amount of the sword principle origin contained in the universe.

“This feeling...is the real sword principle.” Jian Wushuang sighed with surprise and joy in his eyes.

He had renewed his sword principle and activated the universe sword principle origin. Now that he had finally used the universe sword principle origin, his sword principle had reached a new level.

“If I’m not wrong, Di Shisan’s sword principle level should also be at this step,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Di Shisan was an amazing genius in sword principle.

His sword principle was the strongest in the Divine Beginning Realm since ancient times.

Even though he was only a Principles Master, his level of sword principle was beyond the reach of many Rulers.

Although Jian Wushuang could not really compare with Di Shisan, he felt that his current grasp of sword principle should not be much weaker than Di Shisan’s.

“I’m very curious about how much my swordsmanship will improve after reaching this step.” Jian Wushuang slowly extended his right hand with a hint of expectation.

He did not use a sword nor did he display swordsmanship. He just casually slashed with his right index finger.

This slash instantly activated the origin of sword principle in the universe. For a moment, the space was almost cut open.

“Wow, when I activated the sword principle origin of the universe, the power of my sword suddenly increased by dozens of times. It’s so terrifying!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

Previously, when he had reached the third level of sword principle and evolved everything, the power of his swordsmanship could also be increased with the support of sword principle. However, the increase in power was very limited. It was already incredible to be able to increase the power by one or two times.

But now, with a casual move of his sword, the power of the origin of sword principle in the universe was instantly increased by dozens of times. This increase was too great!

“Now I understand why Di Shisan was able to cut off the arm of a Ruler,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

With the comprehension of sword principle at this stage, the power of each move was extremely powerful. For example, now, even with a casual move of his sword, the power of this move would still be no weaker than a level six absolute art, once he displayed his sword skill and activated the sword principle origin of the universe, the power of his sword skill would be even more terrifying.

Moreover, his understanding of sword principle was so high that it had already surpassed most of the Master Realm experts. At this stage, he could completely create a level seven absolute art, which was an absolute art at the Master Realm.

Once he created a level seven absolute art and activated the sword principle origin of the universe, the power would be too terrifying.

“I was absolutely confident that I had some talent in sword principle, but I wasn’t confident that I could compete with Di Shisan. I didn’t expect that I could really catch up with Di Shisan in the blink of an eye.” Jian Wushuang’s face was full of surprise and joy.

However, he also understood that the reason why he was able to achieve this step was because of his extraordinary perception and comprehension. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Another point was the human-shaped statue array in front of him. The combination of the human-shaped statues in the array and their swordsmanship made Jian Wushuang realize the shortcomings of his sword principle and allowed him to find a flaw, he also saw a brand-new sword principle.

Of course, the most important point was Jian Wushuang’s decisiveness and boldness!

After all, he had destroyed his sword world on his own and then re-cultivated his sword principle.

This process was not something that an ordinary person could do.

After all, it was not easy to cultivate a sword principle to this point. Who would be willing to destroy it on their own? Who would be willing to re-cultivate it?

Even if they knew that they had made a mistake, after all, they had put in so much effort. No one would be willing to reject everything and re-cultivate it, let alone Jian Wushuang, who only relied on his own comprehension, with some conjectures, he decisively broke down the sword world and then relearned his sword principle.

Such decisiveness and boldness were not something that ordinary people could have.

Jian Wushuang had done it, and he had made the right bet!

After relearning his sword principle for 30,000 years, his sword principle had reached a new level, which was far above the sword principle he had comprehended before.

“Although I have taken this step, I don’t know what level it is.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “However, in the Divine Beginning Realm, sword principle was divided into three levels. Although the Sword Principle I have mastered now is not the same as the three levels, it is still considered the fourth level of sword principle.”

The fourth level of sword principle was beyond the realm of Principles Masters. Jian Wushuang had reached the level of sword principle that even many Master Realm experts could not reach.

And then...

“I’ve reached the fourth level of sword principle. I wonder what will happen if I try to break through this human-shaped sculpture array again.” Jian Wushuang licked his lips, looked at the human-shaped sculptures in front of him, and took out his shadow-killing sword, then he walked forward step by step.

Soon, Jian Wushuang fought with the human-shaped sculptures again.

This time, because he had reached the fourth level of sword principle, his swordsmanship was completely different.

While Jian Wushuang was fighting with the human-shaped sculptures, the consciousness in the deepest part of this special space-time awakened again.

This time, when he woke up and sensed what was happening on the high platform, the consciousness was completely shocked.

“Sword…Universe Origin of Sword Principle?”

“This kid has activated the Universe Origin of Sword Principle? He has reached, he has reached the first step of the Universe Origin of Sword Principle!”

“How is this possible?”

The consciousness was completely shocked.

After all, 80,000 years ago, when Jian Wushuang first came to this special space-time and was trapped on the high platform, the sword principle that he displayed was extremely laughable to him, but now...
