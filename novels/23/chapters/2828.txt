——

“Everyone, Kill for the Pill Sun Sacred World!”

Yin Su’er said in a cold but determined voice.

The eyes of the experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World’s camp turned scarlet.

“Kill!”

As a series of heaven-toppling battle cries sounded, the experts from the Pill Sun Sacred World’s camp moved at the same time.

The Pill Sun Sacred World had far more light wheel experts than the Heavenly Void Realm. After all, the Pill Sun Sacred World had many Heavenly Divine Masters. These Heavenly Divine Masters did not fight on their own. Instead, they formed battle formations and strategies.

A battle formed by dozens of Heavenly Divine Masters could also have the battle strength of Great Divine Masters..

With so many Divine Masters joining forces, it was also an extraordinary battle strength.

The Pill Sun Sacred World knew very well that in terms of battle strength, there was too much of a gap between them and the other side, so they could only rely on these Divine Masters to form battle formations to make up for it.

But even so, there was still a huge gap in battle strength between the two sides.

In the blink of an eye, countless experts from both sides clashed head-on.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of violent explosions reverberated in the sky and earth, and violent divine power exploded wantonly.

The entire battlefield immediately became fiery hot.

In the void at the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and the Marquis of Three Yin were still engaged in a fierce battle.

Although the Marquis of Three Yin had suffered a loss at the hands of Jian Wushuang, it was not a big deal. He could still fight evenly with Jian Wushuang.

“Humph, Sword One, I didn’t expect that your strength had improved so much in just a year. Unfortunately, it’s useless. You can’t control this battle alone. You’ve been fighting in the inner sanctum for many years, and your strength has been weakened to the extreme. The experts gathered here can’t compete with the Army of our Heaven Void Palace. The difference is too great. Today’s battle will be your defeat for sure!”

“Ha Ha!”

“Ha Ha!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The Marquis of Three Yin laughed wildly, and his laughter echoed in the surroundings.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. Although he had been fighting fiercely with the Marquis of Three Yin, he still saw the surrounding scene clearly.

Indeed, as the Marquis of Three Yin had said, the overall combat strength of the two camps was too far apart.

Even if the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World tried their best to kill the enemy, the difference in combat strength could not be made up for.

Especially at the level of the great deity, the Heavenly Void Temple had close to 160 people, more than 90 more than the Pill Sun Sacred World.

Moreover, the Heavenly Void Army was well-trained, and their combat strength was far from what the temporary Heavenly Divine Army could compare with.

This resulted in the Pill Sun Sacred World being completely suppressed from the very beginning of this great battle. It could even be said to be completely suppressed.

“Kill! Kill!”

The soldiers of the Heavenly Void Army all had solemn expressions. They were like machines. Under the leadership of their respective generals, they attacked in an orderly manner, splitting into two rounds of attacks. Their coordination was incomparably perfect, and their combat strength was unleashed to the extreme.

Under the reckless attack of the Heavenly Void Army, the battle formations formed by the Divine Masters of the Dan Yang Sacred World camp were easily shattered like paper.

On the level of Great Divine Masters of both sides, even if Yin Su’er, Yun Shan, Elder Tong, and the other Peak Great Divine Masters tried their best, the opponent had more Peak Great Divine Masters. There were 15 of them, and they were also overwhelming.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang sighed secretly.

He knew that he had to make a move.

“The Marquis of Three Yin, get out of my way!”

Jian Wushuang shouted. The black divine sword condensed from 18 netherblood divine swords stabbed wildly at the Marquis of Three Yin’s head, forcing him to defend himself. However, Jian Wushuang suddenly retreated.

He stood firm in the void and looked at the surrounding battlefield. Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and then waved his hand.

“Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!”

Streams of flowing light flew out of Jian Wushuang’s interspatial ring.

These flowing lights were of different colors. Most of them were copper, followed by silver, and fewer were golden.

These flowing lights condensed in the void around Jian Wushuang. In just a moment, more than 100 flowing lights, or more than 100 figures, appeared.

As soon as these figures appeared, the tyrannical aura on their bodies burst out instantly.

More than 100 tyrannical auras burst out at the same time!

On the battlefield, the experts from both sides, who had been fighting fiercely and passionately, could not help but stop when they sensed the more than 100 tyrannical auras.

Then, one by one, they looked in Jian Wushuang’s direction with shock and astonishment.

“What... what are those?”

“Are they experts? No, they are lifeless. They should be corpse puppets.”

“Corpse puppets? So many corpse puppets?”

Exclamations sounded in the center of the battlefield.

The experts from the Holy Sundan World Camp and the Heavenly Void Army camp were all stunned when they saw hundreds of lifeless figures suddenly appear around Jian Wushuang.

Corpse puppets!

Yes, the figures that suddenly appeared were all corpse puppets.

But the point was that there were too many of them.

There were hundreds of them!

The most important thing was the powerful aura emitted by these corpse puppets. Even the weakest one was comparable to an ordinary senior great divine master, and the slightly stronger one was at the peak of the Senior Great Divine Master level! There were also eleven corpse puppets whose bodies were suffused with a faint golden light. Their divine power aura had even reached the Peak Great Divine Master level!

An army!

This was an incomparably powerful corpse puppet army formed by over a hundred corpse puppets!

“This, this...”

Everyone’s eyes were wide open. They did not understand where this corpse puppet army came from.

Only a small portion of them noticed the young figure in the middle who was surrounded by many corpse puppets.

“Sword One, it’s Sword One!”

“These corpse puppets were all taken out by Sword One!”

“How could he have so many corpse puppets?”

One voice after another sounded with fear.

These terrified voices were naturally from experts from the Heaven Void World camp. As for the people from the Pill Sun Sacred World, they were all ecstatic!

Especially Yin Su’er, Yun Shan, Palace Master Si Zhen, and the others.

They had seen Jian Wushuang’s confident look and had asked him about it. Jian Wushuang’s answer was that he did have some tricks that he would use at the critical moment.

At that time, they had half-believed it and thought that Jian Wushuang’s words might be just to boost the confidence of their camp.

Even if Jian Wushuang had prepared a method, they did not think that his method was very powerful.

But now...
