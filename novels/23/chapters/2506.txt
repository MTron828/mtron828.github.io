Chapter 2507: Thunderous Star Beast

“Thank you, Senior.” Jian Wushuang accepted the black stone and refined it on the spot.

After that, he began driving his divine powers. As expected, his divine power aura had reached the level of Peak Divine Demon.

“With help from the black stone, even if I defeat an Ultimate God in public, it wouldn’t seem so unbelievable anymore.” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Oh yes, since you have been staying in Wusha Wilderness, you probably knew about Miss Xiao who annihilated the Mu Clan?”

“Miss Xiao? That little lass?” Daoist Xuan Shen smiled slightly and said, “You don’t have to worry about that lass. She’s a friend, not an enemy.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

“Alright, I’ve given you the necessary advice plus the black stone. I’ll make a move now.” Daoist Xuan Shen stood up and once again held the fortune-telling canvas banner in his hand. “Kid, keep up with your cultivation and keep on living. If you’ve made it to the Pinnacle, you and I will then have an opportunity to meet again. Otherwise...there’s no point in meeting again.”

Upon finishing his words, Daoist Xuan Shen immediately floated outward.

“Farewell, Sir.” Jian Wushuang appeared to be incredibly humble.

Daoist Xuan Shen vanished in the blink of an eye.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin returned to the main hall.

“Shuang’er[1], what did Daoist Xuan Shen tell you?” Zhuo Yunfeng asked.

“Nothing, he’s just giving me some advice about things I should watch out for on my cultivation path from now on.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Zhuo Yunfeng did not ask further.

“Father, Mother, I’ve decided to leave Wusha Wilderness in a few days,” said Jian Wushuang directly.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin looked at each other and smiled wryly.

They had predicted Jian Wushuang would decide to do that. In fact, they were not the only ones who predicted so, all the sects in Wusha Wilderness did so as well.

Jian Wushuang—the only super freak in Ancient God Domain—would absolutely not stay in a tiny pond like Wusha Wilderness.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were both prepared for this.

Five days later, Jian Wushuang had made necessary arrangements for his affairs in Wusha Wilderness.

The Great Compassion Sect had already sent experts over to secretly protect his parents.

Jian Wushuang left immediately after that.

His departure did not cause any stir, as there were not many who knew him. Other than his parents, his Big Sister, and Brother, he only informed Yun Zhen and Wujian through a message.

In his message to Yun Zhen, he reminded the Great Compassion Sect to keep their promises of keeping his parents safe.

As for the message to Wujian, it was purely words of friendship.

...

A month later, Jian Wushuang had left Wusha Wilderness and arrived at another wilderness.

In a wide void where the weather was sunny, Jian Wushuang was clad in a golden robe with his long sword on his back and slowly walking.

Suddenly, whoosh!

In the void not too far ahead, lightning tore through the sky and vanished from Jian Wushuang’s sight in the blink of an eye.

“That’s truly fast, it’s close to the speed of an Ultimate God unleashing his full power. Perhaps that flash of lightning was probably a flying wild beast,” said Jian Wushuang to himself.

In Ancient God Domain, other than human cultivators, there existed many kinds of wild beasts, spectacular beasts, mystic beasts, and ferocious beasts.

Among them, wild beasts were the most mild-mannered ones.

There were also many wild beasts that could move incredibly fast, hence certain powerful parties domesticated wild beasts to sell them to cultivators from all over.

The cultivators would ride on wild beasts for their travels.

Ancient God Domain was not located in the dark void like the Eternal Chaotic World after all. People could make flying ships that were unaffected by Space-time obstructions and move without fear in the Eternal Chaotic World.

However, the Ancient God Domain was covered with vast lands making flying ships practically useless to move across lands.

“It’s quite far for me to go to the Continent of Northern Darkstar from Wusha Wilderness. Going on foot will only be a waste of time not to mention energy. I should probably think about purchasing a flying wild beast to ease my journey,” said Jian Wushuang to himself.

Northern Darkstar Continent was the center of Northern Darkstar Territory.

It was the most bustling place in Northern Darkstar Territory and also the highest concentration of experts in the whole territory.

The Lord of Northern Darkstar Territory also permanently stayed in the Northern Darkstar Continent.

Jian Wushuang had departed from Wusha Wilderness and made the Northern Darkstar Continent his first destination.

“I should go explore the surrounding cities, seek out places which sell wild beasts, and purchase one.” Jian Wushuang decided.

Two days later, Jian Wushuang found a shop that specialized in selling wild beasts in one of the surrounding cities.

Inside the shop...

“Looks like you need a flying wild beast for your journey?” The shopkeeper stood next to Jian Wushuang and smiled.

“Yes, what’s your recommendation?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“We have every kind of wild beast, but if you’re looking for a flying type purely for your journey... The best choice would naturally be Thunderous Star Beast. It’s very fast and possesses very strong legs. It can fly non-stop for a month or two without rest. The only issue is it’s more on the expensive side,” said the shopkeeper.

“Don’t worry about the price, tell me more about the Thunderous Star Beast’s speed,” said Jian Wushuang.

“There are three kinds of Thunderous Star Beasts—Single-horn, Double-horn, and Triple-horn. A Single-horn Thunderous Star Beast’s fastest speed is comparable to an Ultimate God expert’s ultimate speed or perhaps even slightly faster. The price is one thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power!”

“Double-horn Thunderous Star Beast moves at ten times the speed of an Ultimate God with its price being ten thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power.”

“The highest rank was the Triple-horn Thunderous Star Beast which can move a hundred times faster than an Ultimate God, and it’s even more expensive of course and starts from a hundred thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“We have all three types of Thunderous Star Beast, which one would you like?” The shopkeeper’s introduction was very detailed.

“If my guess is right, the Thunderous Star Beast’s speed is not that consistent. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Why of course, if the Thunderous Star Beast could unleash that speed in any environment, then its price would be much higher. Thunderous Star Beast and most of the other wild beasts only have one shortcoming, they are very cowardly. It wouldn’t be a problem during normal circumstances. However, if you want to rely on the Thunderous Star Beast to escape during a battle, that would be absolutely impossible as when the aura of a slightly stronger Divine Demon pushes in, it was enough to make a Thunderous Star Beast freeze,” said the shopkeeper.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang understood and soon made a decision, “Give me a Double-horn Thunderous Star Beast then.”

A Double-horn Thunderous Star Beast’s speed was ten times faster than an Ultimate God, making it already extremely fast. Jian Wushuang did not need anything faster than that.

“Aye, please give me a few moments.” The shopkeeper got excited and went to prepare.
