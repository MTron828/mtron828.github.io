Chapter 3891: Surrender or Death

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch was feeling bitter. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He did not know Jian Wushuang’s real identity and that he was a disciple of the Red Cloud Lineage. If he had known earlier, he would not have dared to lay his hands on Jian Wushuang’s principle-type supreme treasure, the Divine Sword?

Even if he had invited Demon Dragon Lord and Demon Dragon Lord, he would have been courting death in front of Blood Sword Master, let alone him.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang had already arrived in front of the three Rulers.

The three Rulers were suppressed by the power of the formation and could not move. They could only raise their heads to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, Blood Rain Demon Monarch, and Thousand Kills Emperor Lord.” Jian Wushuang looked down at the three Rulers with a faint smile. “Do you still want to kill me?”

Hearing this, the three Rulers were extremely angry.

Blood Rain Demon Monarch said, “Blood Sword Master, we didn’t expect you to be a disciple of the Red Cloud Lineage. No wonder you were so fearless from the beginning. I see.”

“The Red Cloud Lineage has not been to the Eternal Dark Prison for hundreds of chaos cycles. No new prisoners have been imprisoned in the Eternal Dark Prison for hundreds of chaos cycles. There have been rumors in the Eternal Dark Prison that the Red Cloud Lineage has been completely destroyed and the Eternal Dark Prison has been abandoned. But now it seems that this is not the case,” Thousand Kills Emperor Lord said in a deep voice.

“The rumors are true. The Red Cloud Lineage has been destroyed. As for me, I was lucky enough to enter the Red Cloud World and pass the test. That’s how I became a disciple of the Red Cloud Lineage,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Is that so?” The three Rulers understood one after another.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, I actually hoped that you could invite some other experts and let Blood Rain Demon Monarch continue to trap me with the formation. Not only can I continue to study and improve my swordsmanship, but the more experts you invite, the more I’ll be able to suppress.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch looked miserable and did not speak.

“Alright, now it’s your turn to choose. Surrender or die!” Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold.

The three Rulers’ expressions changed.

When Jian Wushuang used the power of the formation but did not kill the three of them immediately, they had guessed that Blood Sword Master did not want to kill them directly, now it seemed that he did.

“Blood Sword Master, what do we have to pay if we choose to submit?” Blood Rain Demon Monarch asked.

“It’s simple. You just have to give up the soul defense and let me leave a mark in your soul origin. Of course, as a condition, I will take you out of the Eternal Dark Prison and return to the universe. In addition, I can swear to the universe principles now. As long as you submit to me, I will remove the soul mark and set you free in 100,000 years,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“100,000 years?”

“Vow to the universe principles?”

The eyes of Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand-edge Demon Monarch lit up.

100,000 years was too short for prisoners who had been trapped in the Eternal Dark Prison for hundreds of chaos cycles and could not see the light of day for the rest of their lives.

They did not care about such a short period of time.

What they cared about was the soul brand.

Once they gave up resisting and let Jian Wushuang leave a brand in their soul origin, their lives would be in the other party’s hands. This feeling of being controlled by the other party’s life and death would be unacceptable, however, it was only 100,000 years, but it was worth considering.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang also added one more point, which was to swear an oath to the universe principle.

It must be known that the universe principle was supreme, and that was the universe principle in the universe.

Jian Wushuang himself had comprehended a trace of the universe principle. If it was an ordinary oath, it would be fine if he did not follow it.

But if he swore an oath to the universe principle, once he made it, it would resonate with the universe principle. If he failed to keep the oath, the universe principle would not punish him, but when he comprehended the universe principle in the future, he would be more or less affected, and his comprehension speed would be slowed down or he would be blocked by various obstacles.

For a super genius like Jian Wushuang who could comprehend a bit of the universe principle at the level of a Principles Master, it was impossible for him to accept such a thing.

Therefore, they were not worried that Jian Wushuang would not keep his promise.

“Gentlemen, I’ll only give you one breath’s time to think about it,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“There’s no need to think about it. I’m willing to submit,” Blood Rain Demon Monarch said directly.

“I’m also willing,” Thousand Kills Emperor Lord said.

Then, both of them looked at Thousand-edge Demon Monarch at the same time.

At this moment, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s face was terrifyingly gloomy. He stared at Jian Wushuang, he sneered and said, “Blood Sword Master, I admit that you’re very capable, but you want me to submit to you and even surrender my soul origin to be your dog? Dream on!”

“Thousand-blade, a wise man submits to circumstances. It’s only 100,000 years. It’s better than losing your life,” Thousand Kills Emperor advised.

“Yes, Blood Sword Master is a peerless genius. Not only has he comprehended a trace of universe principle at the level of a Principles Master, but he’s also a cultivator at the level of a perfect being. With such talent, he’ll definitely become a supreme being in the universe in the future. It won’t be difficult for him to become an autarch. It Won’t be shameful for us to submit to him,” Blood Rain Demon Monarch said.

“Haha…I, Thousand-edge, have been imprisoned in the Eternal Dark Prison for hundreds of chaos cycles. I have long forgotten about my own life. Unlike the two of you, I am not afraid of death. In order to survive, I am willing to submit to a Principles Master. Humph, my death is easy. If you want me to submit, don’t even think about it.” As soon as Thousand-edge Demon Monarch finished his words, his face immediately contorted, his eyes were filled with madness and determination.

“Is his soul burning again?” Jian Wushuang looked at him calmly.

Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand Kills Emperor Lord did not try to persuade him.

They both sensed Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s determination and could not stop his soul from burning.

In the end, under the watchful eyes of Jian Wushuang, Blood Rain Demon Monarch, and Thousand Kills Emperor Lord, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s aura gradually weakened and eventually died.

After his death, Jian Wushuang casually took away the armor and interspatial ring on his body.

Then Jian Wushuang looked at Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand Kills Emperor Lord and said, “You two, don’t resist.”

Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand Kills Emperor Lord obediently allowed Jian Wushuang’s soul power to enter their consciousness and soon left a mark in the soul origin of their consciousness.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang untied them.

“Get up,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand-edge Demon Monarch got up. They looked at each other and then bowed.

“Blood Rain greets master.”

“Thousand-edge greets master.”
