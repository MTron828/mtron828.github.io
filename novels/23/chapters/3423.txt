Chapter 3425 Came Knocking on the Door

A cold voice filled with killing intent resounded throughout the hall.

The figures of the Zhao family members in the hall trembled. Zhao Yong’s expression also changed greatly. Only now did he remember that the person in front of him was a Principles Master, and his exact strength was unknown. The Zhao family could not afford to offend the Illusionary Moon Sect, but they could not afford to offend the Principles Master. If the person in front of them really attacked now, it would be very easy to destroy the Zhao family.

“Zhao Mang, let’s go.”

Demon Master Chenhuo did not bother to say anything more. He left the Zhao family with Jian Wushuang and Zhao Mang and Zhao Ling.

After they left, the entire Zhao family was in an uproar. The news that Saint Qingyan had died in the Zhao family spread quickly and caused a huge wave in the Wu Xin City.

Two days later, they were still in a tavern in the Wu Xin City. Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo sat at a table while Zhao Mang and Zhao Ling stood respectfully by the side.

“Wu Xin city hasn’t been very quiet these two days,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. “It seems that your killing of Saint Qingyan has caused quite a stir.”

“Humph, it’s just killing an ant,” Demon Master Chenhuo said disdainfully.

“Master,” Zhao Mang said at this time, “After all, Saint Qingyan is a core disciple of the Illusionary Moon Sect. It’s said that his master, Blacklight Master, has great power in the sect. If master kills Saint Qingyan, Blacklight Master is likely to find us. Should we avoid him for now?”

Zhao Mang was worried for his master, Demon Master Chenhuo.

After all, he was born in Wu Xin City and was only sixteen years old. He did not have much experience. In his eyes, the Illusionary Moon Sect could be said to be an invincible existence.

Anyone would have to lower their heads in front of the Illusionary Moon Sect.

And although he could tell that his master was powerful, he did not want Chenhuo to clash with the Illusionary Moon Sect for his sake.

“Avoid? The Illusionary Moon Sect alone is not qualified to make me retreat,” Demon Master Chenhuo said indifferently. “Haha, little guy, you underestimate your master too much. Just wait and see. If the Illusionary Moon Sect doesn’t come, it’ll be fine. But if they come, it’ll be just as your master wants,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Zhao Mang frowned and was full of doubts. However, he saw that Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo did not care about it, so he did not say anything more.

Not long after, just as Zhao Mang said, the experts of the Illusory Moon Sect arrived. “My lords, they are right there!”

A low voice suddenly resounded in the sky. Then, several figures appeared in the void outside the tavern at a very fast speed.

Besides Zhao Yong, the master of the Zhao family, and several elders of the Zhao family, there were three other people who appeared. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There were two men and one woman. As soon as they appeared, three majestic auras swept out and covered the entire Wu Xin City in the blink of an eye.

“Principles Masters! And there are three of them!”

Countless cultivators in the Wu Xin City felt the three auras and were terrified from the bottom of their hearts.

The five families in the Wu Xin City were trembling in front of the three Principles Masters.

“It’s quite a big lineup. There are three Principles Masters, one at the peak of the third realm of the Void Realm, and two at the fourth realm of the Void Realm.” Jian Wushuang drank leisurely and said with a faint smile.

Hearing this, Zhao Mang looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

In their eyes, there were three Principles Masters, and they were all powerful Principles Masters. The three of them came together, but the young man beside his master, whose name he did not know at the moment, was so relaxed, he was actually so relaxed as if he did not take the other party seriously at all.

“What is this person’s identity? He doesn’t seem to be very strong, but he seems to be on equal footing with master?” Zhao Mang was curious in his heart.

In the void outside the tavern, the people of the Zhao family and the three Principles Masters stood side by side.

“My lords, after the death of Saint Qingyan, I have been keeping an eye on these people. They are now in this tavern,” Zhao Yong said.

“I already know,” A cold-looking middle-aged man dressed in a black robe said coldly. This cold-looking middle-aged man was the Master of Saint Qingyan, Blacklight Master.

As soon as he received the news of the Saint Qingyan’s death, he immediately invited two experts of the fourth level of the Void Realm from the Illusionary Moon Sect to rush over. Their purpose was naturally to avenge the Saint Qingyan. And from the looks of it, the murderer who killed Saint Qingyan…he was not in a hurry to leave, so he naturally had the chance to avenge his disciple.

“Those inside, get out!”

Blacklight Master’s voice was ice-cold, like thunder exploding in the sky. His voice carried a terrifying pressure that directly pressed down on the tavern.

The power of the Principles Master could shake heaven and earth when he was angry. If the pressure of Blacklight Master swept out and affected the ordinary cultivators in the tavern, none of them would be able to survive, fortunately, when the pressure of the Blacklight Master came, Demon Master Chenhuo had already attacked and blocked all the power, so that the pressure did not affect the other people in the tavern.

“Chenhuo, you killed him. I Won’t get involved in this matter.” Jian Wushuang still sat there and leisurely drank.

“Zhao Mang, you wait here,” Demon Master Chenhuo said and directly rushed out of the tavern.

“Master!” Zhao Mang was very nervous and worried.

But at this time, Jian Wushuang spoke again, “Little guy, don’t worry. The three people outside are nothing in front of your master.” “The three powerful Principles Masters are nothing?” Zhao Mang was stunned.

Outside the tavern, Demon Master Chenhuo had already appeared in front of Blacklight Master and the other two.

“It was you who killed my disciple?” Blacklight Master’s gaze was cold as he stared at Demon Master Chenhuo.

“I merely crushed an ant to death. As for whether he is your disciple, I don’t know.” Demon Master Chenhuo said coldly with his hands behind his back.

“Very good. Even though I don’t know who you are, since you have already agreed to kill my disciple, then pay with your life for my disciple.” Blacklight Master’s expression was gloomy. “The two of us, let’s attack together and kill him!”

“Alright.” The two void fourth level experts beside him nodded.

Although they could not see the actual strength of the Demon Master Chenhuo, it was clear that he was a Principles Master, and it was very likely that he was above the void third level to deal with such a Principles Master…they definitely could not kill him alone, but if the three of them worked together, there was a great chance.
