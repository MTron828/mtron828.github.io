Chapter 5448 ¬†Hundred Weeping Vine

It was a chess manual accompanied by a passage.

The words were undoubtedly left by the Grandmaster, but it seemed to have been left in ancient times, unknown to Jian Wushuang.

The content was straightforward‚Äîdo not disgrace the content on the chess manual, comprehend and decipher the endgame on the chessboard, and gain corresponding inheritances and treasures.

Jian Wushuang only glanced at it and didn't pay much attention.

However, an image appeared on it.

It was the scene of the Three Kings Court.

In the dim sky, a giant hand reached in.

It was Fuego!

It seemed to record the fall of the Three Kings.

Jian Wushuang shook his head; it was just a fleeting illusion with nothing worth reminiscing.

It was time to leave.

Since he couldn't return directly to the Grave God Mountain, he had to leave quickly, find a place to cultivate in seclusion, perfect the Extreme Dao and Sword Dao cultivation as soon as possible, and prepare for the Dao Merge.

However, the surroundings and the hall below were identical, making it a challenge to find a way out!

Did he have to wait for everyone to come out?

He didn't want to embarrass himself in front of Hu Qing and the others. Unable to go back, he had to find the Grave God Mountain on his own.

It was better to leave early.

It would be best to leave the Earth Realm and go to the Heavenly Realm, where it was more suitable for cultivation.

In the Earth Realm, he feared that Shen Ling would once again focus on him.

It was better to go to the Heavenly Realm, seek refuge in the Elder Palace, and Wu Zuo should give him face, allowing him to cultivate in the Elder Palace.

"Here?"

Seeing a vortex in the distance, which should be the passage to leave, Jian Wushuang didn't hesitate and directly entered the vortex.

After he entered the vortex, it began to close.

However, Jian Wushuang didn't notice when he left‚Äîthere was another person who had left ahead of him.

The scene in the vortex was similar to a black hole.

As if there were no endpoint.

But the barrier of this passage was fragile. Jian Wushuang directly tore a hole in it with a wave of his hand, and halfway through, he came out.

However, he didn't expect that after leaving the vortex, he didn't appear at the bottom of the Black Demon Sea but in a quiet stone room.

The layout here is very ancient, with rows of stone rooms.

The sky is dotted with stars, and it seems there's no way out.

Jian Wushuang strolled casually forward, following a faint aura. He swiftly approached the source.

To his surprise, he discovered a hot spring emitting white mist, and within the water, an intimate scene unfolded.

"It's her!" Jian Wushuang turned away, refusing to look at the person in the spring.

"Who is it?"¬†In the spring, Gong Miaoyi, draped in a red veil while cleansing her body, floated to a blue stone platform. She tiptoed and, through the white mist, caught a glimpse of Jian Wushuang's upright figure.

Looking closer, she recognized Jian Wushuang and sighed in relief.

Jian Wushuang turned around, calmly saying, "What a coincidence!"

"Is it?" Gong Miaoyi's expression changed slightly. She knew Jian Wushuang's secrets. Although he had restored his true appearance, the lingering aura within her remained unchanged.

Others refrained from mentioning it to maintain face for Jian Wushuang, while she kept silent out of fear that he might kill her.

Indeed, it was a coincidence. Randomly tearing through the void and ending up here, encountering Gong Miaoyi was unexpected.

Without the Observation Heaven Chessboard, he would not have let go of Gong Miaoyi's Origin Source. However, now that he possessed the chessboard, there was no need to scheme against her.

As he reached the consummate realm, the looming karmic calamity within him grew immense.

The slaughter needed to come to an end. DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

"What place is this?" Jian Wushuang inquired.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang harbored no ill intentions, Gong Miaoyi relaxed.

"This is an underwater tomb left by a deceased tier 5 Emperor." She then pointed to the steaming spring and said, "This spring contains a source's essence, quite rare in the Western Sea. How about we split it between the two of us?"

Initially, Jian Wushuang didn't think much of it. However, the last sentence nearly made him burst out laughing.

This spring was indeed a valuable treasure. It could be sold for around two hundred billion godstones.

For an ordinary tier 5 Emperor, it was a considerable gain, and for a tier 4 Emperor, it was unexpected fortune.

For an ordinary fifth-tier Emperor, it was a decent harvest; for a fourth-tier Emperor, it was an unexpected windfall. However, for Jian Wushuang, it was nothing more than a foul ditch‚Äîone he couldn't be bothered to approach.

As for sharing? Ridiculous. How could that be possible?

"Below, there is a spiritual root, a tear of the Hundred Weeping Vine. The spring water is the tear of the vine's tendrils!" Gong Miaoyi wanted to continue, but Jian Wushuang interrupted her.

With a serious expression, Jian Wushuang stated, "I want 70 percent. The excess 20 percent, I can compensate you with valuable treasures!"

Having said that, he plunged into the spring water.

Gong Miaoyi didn't argue; mainly because she wasn't a match for Jian Wushuang.

A single spiritual spring didn't matter much to Jian Wushuang, but the Hundred Weeping Vine beneath it was extraordinary.

Although the spring water was referred to as the vine's tears, it wasn't entirely accurate. There should have been a spring here originally, but the tears entering it caused a qualitative change.

The Hundred Weeping Vine was an ancient and unique plant, extremely rare and almost extinct. Back in Qiuhuang City, a drop of its tears cost 100,000 Treasure Points.

And the Hundred Weeping Vine produced tears approximately once every 10,000 years.

In the Four Great Secret Realms, its value was at least 500 million godstones, a price set too low for them in Qiuhuang City.

This was partly because the tears of the Hundred Weeping Vine, visible to the naked eye, provided clarity to a cultivator's mind, elevating their soul realm. Hence, the low pricing.

However, for Emperors, the tears were a crucial treasure for enhancing their divine bodies, especially when breaking through the 30,000-fold foundation of the divine body.

The Hundred Weeping Vine itself was the ultimate treasure for reaching 50,000-fopldfold.

Jian Wushuang couldn't possibly give up on this opportunity.

By nurturing this vine, he could rapidly reach a 50,000-fold divine body.

After that, he would grind away, devouring the Hundred Weeping Vine to break through 50,000-fold.

It's like having ripe meat delivered to one's mouth, already chewed for him.

What's even more crucial is that Jian Wushuang can use the power of all things to forcibly ripen the Hundred Weeping Vines, making them cry day and night.

He couldn't wait for ten thousand years.

One drop in 10,000 years, and he needs to reach a divine body of 50,000-fold, how many years does he have to wait?

With the Power of All Things, the growth rate of the Hundred Weeping Vines will be even faster when placed in the temporal river at the center of the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard.

This is an invaluable treasure.

Diving into the spring, Jian Wushuang indeed saw the mature vine of the Hundred Weeping Vines.

However, on this vine, there was a coiled monstrous red line.

The arrival of Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi made the monstrous creature open its eyes.

Peak-level tier 5!

At a glance, Jian Wushuang saw the opponent's strength.

Gong Miaoyi is also at the peak-level of tier 5, and his strength, when fully unleashed, is at this level, and even higher.

This giant python can't guard the vine of the Hundred Weeping Vines and is destined to die today.

The two looked at each other and made their move together.

One hour later.

Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi sat cross-legged on the cyan stone board, each holding a roasted giant python.

The true form of the giant python was condensed by Jian Wushuang and only turned into a bit more than one feet. After being roasted, it had a ceremonial feeling when they started to eat.
