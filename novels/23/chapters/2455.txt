Chapter 2456: Who Dared to Fight

The execution of the Divine God of Punishment spelled Jian Wushuang’s strength... As long as the golden prison’s form was rigid and strong, those First-Class Divine Demons could never break it unless they formed a coalition to strike an attack.

Although those First-Class Divine Demons were painstakingly bombarding the golden prison’s surface, their attacks were very scattered and not concentrated at one point. They only managed to cause vibrational waves on the golden prison which was far from collapsing the golden prison.

While they were firing attacks at the golden prison, Jian Wushuang went with his full strength and continued his wild massacre.

Under the Prison of Punishment’s influence, his strength skyrocketed while his speed was much faster than before.

His sword skills were even more terrifying.

Those First-Class Divine Demons whose strength had been greatly suppressed could hardly stop Jian Wushuang’s terrifying swords skill.

“Ugh!”

A token appeared in Huan Chen’s hand as he lightly sighed.

“Huan Chen, are you going...” Huo Yang looked over in surprise.

With a hint of helplessness in his heart, Huan Chen said, “You too, smash the Safety Token. Jian Wushuang’s abilities have completely exceeded our understanding. In the golden prison, he’s like a master. I’m afraid that only an Ultimate God can take initiative to forcefully annihilate this prison and kill him. If we continue staying in this prison, we’ll only be killed by him one after another.”

“Crushing the Safety Token may render us losing the opportunity to be enlightened by the Fengtian Scroll and visit the Divine Power Ocean, but it is better than losing our lives.”

After finishing his statement, Huan Chen ignored Huo Yang’s reaction and instantly crushed the Safety Token in his hand.

A burst of light flashed and Huan Chen’s figure immediately disappeared from the Saint’s Tomb.

Even Huan Chen had to crush the Safety Token to protect his life, let alone other First-Class Divine Demons.

Huo Yang hesitated momentarily before he too crushed his token.

Many First-Class Divine Demons who were trapped in the golden prison took out their Safety Tokens and crushed them.

There were also those who did not make the hasty decision and were obviously still hoping for the best, but the result was Jian Wushuang’s merciless killing.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Long Zishan’s complexion flushed as he stared down hard at Jian Wushuang.

Although he had a strong desire to kill Jian Wushuang, he was more shocked by the scenes laid before his eyes.

He was struck with stupor from Jian Wushuang’s powers and his trump cards. Jian Wushuang seemed to have endless potential.

The moment had arrived when even he had to retreat by taking out his Safety Token and crushing it into pieces.

...

In the vast expanse of Heaven and Earth, at the great battlefield...

A large number of geniuses from various sects stayed in the void around the battlefield.

They had their eyes fixed forward, but what appeared in their sight was a huge golden prison.

The golden prison covered the entire space, completely obstructing their eyes and even their soul power. The disciples of those sects had no idea what was happening in the golden prison.

At that instance, hum...

Finally, the huge golden prison began to melt into thin air.

The gust of golden divine powers faded and soon the battlefield reappeared in everyone’s sight. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone looked around, only to find that there was only one person left on the battlefield.

Yes, there was only one person still standing proudly in the void.

That person was Jian Wushuang!

As for the nearly 50 genius disciples who had previously besieged Jian Wushuang, some turned into corpses while others had completely disappeared.

Of course, those sect disciples knew fully well where they had gone.

It was just that they found the result to be unacceptable.

“There were so many First-Class Divine Demons including Huan Chen, Long Zishan, Yu Aoqing, and Huo Yang. Several Twelve Minor Kings join forces, yet Jian Wushuang single-handedly defeats them!”

“A lot of people have died. I am afraid no less than 20 First-Class Divine Demons have died in his hands and the remaining must have escaped using the Safety Token.”

“What happened in the golden prison just now? How could it turn out this way?”

Everyone’s eyes widened, they could not believe what was happening before them.

However, that was the reality.

Nearly 50 First-Class Divine Demons besieged Jian Wushuang, but they were trapped in the golden prison. When the golden prison disappeared, only Jian Wushuang was left!

He was the only one in the nine heavens and ten domains left standing on that battlefield!

No one knew exactly how Jian Wushuang did it. They only knew that nearly 50 First-Class Divine Demons disciples who were geniuses joined forces and were wiped out by Jian Wushuang alone!

“He... He...”

Hong Luo, a red-clothed girl squatting in the void was staring at Jian Wushuang with her eyes wide.

Hong Luo felt fortunate.

Fortunate that she trusted her intuition before and did not agree to Huan Chen and Huo Yang’s invitation to kill Jian Wushuang together. Otherwise, she would have to leave the tomb with her Safety Token.

Jian Wushuang, who had become the focus of the battlefield, slowly raised his head.

His gaze was motionless and stony with a sense of indifference and he slowly glanced at the genius disciples around him.

His uncompromising gaze swept around.

As far as his eyes could see, the genius disciples were either in panic or ashamed and hung their heads low.

They were panicking because of Jian Wushuang’s strength.

They were also ashamed because of Jian Wushuang’s strength.

They were genius disciples carefully cultivated by various sects, but their so-called ‘genius’ title was an utter joke in front of Jian Wushuang.

Silence!

The entire space had fallen silent.

All the disciples stood speechlessly, not daring to say a word.

Jian Wushuang did not speak either but merely waved the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Boom!

The ground under his feet cracked open instantly creating a huge sword mark, dividing the battlefield into two halves.

Jian Wushuang finally spoke.

“I am standing right here, who else wants to take my head?”

Who else!”

Jian Wushuang yelled with his voice resounding like thunder echoing in space. How domineering and unparalleled!

His fighting intent was boiling.

Heaven and Earth rumbled under his unrelenting voice.

Countless genius disciples around were startled by the roar with their hearts trembling in fear.

Jian Wushuang was alone, holding a sword in one hand, and standing on top of the world.

His sword intent swept across straight into the heavens like a king of the world.

He was like an invincible ruler of Heaven and Earth with the sword in his hand ridiculing all sentient beings in the world.

Who in the world dared to fight him!
