Chapter 2134 Old Monster Hong Chen

“These people…”

Jian Wushuang took a close look at every experts’ details on the list, but finally, his eyes fixated on one person.

This person was named Hong Chen, also known as Old Monster Hong Chen, Old Demon Hong Chen, and he had vanished over a million years ago without a trace.

The information indicated that due to Old Monster Hong Chen’s inward nature, he had made no friends. He was quite the willful devil as well. It was because of that that he found himself chased down by a family he had offended a million years ago but escaped from, badly hurt.

He was not heard of since.

“This Old Monster Hong Chen has disappeared for over a million years, he has most likely fallen. Maybe he’s still alive, but still too afraid to show his face against so many enemies he had made. No matter, his identity will be useful to me,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He chose Old Monster Hong Chen out of ten vanished experts for two reasons: he had no friends, making him unrecognisable, and his willful personality would make things easier for Jian Wushuang.

“Him it is.” With that settled, Jian Wushuang’s appearance started to change.

Once a cold youngster with a sword on his back, Jian Wushuang had now changed to a red-robed, red-haired fierce elder.

It was based off what the information had suggested regarding Old Monster Hong Chen’s appearance.

With abilities at such a high level, it was too easy for Jian Wushuang to transform.

Not only his appearance, but even Jian Wushuang’s aura transformed into an evil, eerie one.

The impression he gave others was undoubted of a devil.

“With how I look right now, if I call myself Old Monster Hong Chen, unless someone is extremely close with him, no one will doubt my disguise. Furthermore, this Old Monster Hong Chen had no friends. Who could identify me?”

“Of course, I still need to make some preparations before I enter the Imperial City.”

Jian Wushuang snorted and made his way towards the Imperial City.

….

Several days later, in a normal domain within the Three Emperors World, a remote mountain range could be spotted within a dense, eerie forest.

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!

Four figures appeared in the Void above the mountain range simultaneously.

“This is it guys,” a purple-robed woman looked downwards at the mountain range.

“Ling Xi, you’re sure a mountain-dwelling lies within this range?” a sturdy man asked while frowning.

“I’m sure,” the purple-robed woman replied. “The mountain-dwelling was discovered by accident three days ago. I did not notice it at first, but at that moment a boundless aura came from within the dwelling. The aura must have come from a treasure, which led me to the dwelling.”

“I wanted to search for it on my own, but I was stopped by a battle puppet. That puppet was strong, even though his methods were ordinary, I don’t know what he did, but… his strength and speed were at Early Stage Chaotic Realm levels. I was not his opponent, that’s why I found you all.”

A treasure’s aura, with a strong puppet to guard it. Undoubtedly, the mountain-dwelling had something.

“Let’s approach it quietly. Ling Xi, you lead the way.”

The four went on their way.

Soon they had entered the mountain-dwelling and found the puppet which the purple-robed woman had mentioned.

The four of them had already reached pinnacle Chaotic Real God. Collaborating and using all their might, they finally surpassed the puppet and continued making their way towards the mountain-dwelling.

They did not know that a red-robed, red-haired elder was waiting for them.

“They have arrived,” Jian Wushuang smiled and continued pretending to be in meditation.

Before long, the four Real Gods reached the deepest part of the mountain-dwelling.

When they reached, they did not find any treasure. Instead, they found the red-haired elder.

Before they could react, the red-haired elder opened his eyes. A terrifying aura was instantly let out from within the mountain-dwelling.

“The gall of you all to barge into my place of seclusion. Die!”

The red-haired elder made his move.

“Crap!”

“Make a run for it!” The four Real Gods were flustered.

It was then that they realised the mountain-dwelling was no expert’s remnant, but a Chaotic Realm expert’s place of meditation and seclusion.

They had offended the other party, and now he wanted them all dead.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

The red-haired elder made several moves and instantly killed three people, only the purple-robed woman managed to escape.

Of course, Jian Wushuang had intentionally let her go.

After the purple-robed female had left, the word spread as expected.

Old Monster Hong Chen, a name last heard a million years ago, had reappeared.

This was what Jian Wushuang had wanted. He had intentionally lured the four people in and let the woman escape, all for Old Monster Hong Chen’s name to be mentioned all over Three Emperors World once again.

But this was not enough.

Soon after Old Monster Hong Chen’s name started going around, Jian Wushuang arrived at a huge family.

This family was the famous Dan Clan within the Three Emperors World.

The Dan Clan had many experts, with reported seven Chaotic Realm experts and one Middle Stage Chaotic Realm elder.

This Dan Clan had also chased down Old Monster Hong Chen over a million years ago, forcing him into seclusion.

Looking at the huge family, Jian Wushuang laughed.

A loud roar resonated through the heavens.

“You Dan rats, you chased me down a million years ago, forcing me out. Today, I have come for my revenge!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
