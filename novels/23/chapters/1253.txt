Chapter 1254: One King and Three Hegemons!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Upon hearing what the Gu King had said, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He had just left the Green Fire World, and in his eyes, a domain consisting of countless places as large as Eternal World was indeed very vast.

However, a kingdom was a thousand times bigger than a domain.

Moreover, there were many Kingdoms in the Eternal Chaotic World.

“It’s… It’s so vast!

“The Eternal Chaotic World is vast beyond my imagination,” Jian Wushuang said in amazement.

Suddenly, he recalled something and asked, “The kingdoms are just of Level Three. What about the places of Level Four?”

How vast could a place at Level 4 be?

“Level Four is the core of the Eternal Chaotic World, and also the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries with the most experts,” Gu King answered.

“Cultivation Sanctuary? Ten! ! ! ” Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened.

“There are ten Cultivation Sanctuaries in the Eternal Chaotic World, each of them covering a small area and no larger than a Kingdom. However, they are the core places of the Eternal Chaotic World. Cultivating there will be more efficient than in other places, so they attract the most experts.

“Many geniuses from the kingdoms, domains, and even the Eternal World all have gone there to cultivate.

Jian Wushuang, you are the core member of the Star Bloodline. It is in one of the Cultivation Sanctuaries as well,” Gu King answered.

“Star Bloodline is in one of the Cultivation Sanctuaries as well?”?Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Besides that, the Star Bloodline is the main force in that Cultivation Sanctuary and is famous in the whole Eternal Chaotic World.” Gu King answered. “You have just come out of the Green Fire World, and the best choice for you is to go to where the Star Bloodline is now. There, you can rely on their resources and become stronger, but we’re so far away from that place.”

“How far?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

“I have no idea.”

Gu King shook his head. “When I adventured in the Eternal Chaotic World with King Luo Zhen, I had visited many kingdoms, but I never heard of the Snow Kingdom, so I’m sure this kingdom is not near the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and might be somewhere in the corner. Therefore, if we set off from such a place to the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, it will take us a rather long time.

“Not only that, there are a lot of dangerous places in the void outside the kingdoms, and there are even countless bandits. With your current strength, it is not realistic for you to go to the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries now!

So, I think you should stay in the Dayu Region to improve your power at first, and when you’ve passed the first Inverse Cultivation Test and become a Universe God in the First Heaven, you can set off.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He also knew that he should not hurry now.

With his current strength, it was indeed impossible for him to make it to the Cultivation Sanctuaries all by himself.

He had better set off after he had made some breakthrough in his power.

Jian Wushuang continued reading the information on the Dayu Region.

Though the region was only a normal domain of the Snow Kingdom, it was still vast with many experts there, and most of those experts were gathered on the land that Jian Wushuang was standing on.

Among all the sects in the region, there were four dominating forces.

They were the Dayu Palace, the Scarlet Island, the Golden-sun Sect, and the Holy Prefecture. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Those four forces were addressed as One King and Three Hegemons.

One King referred to the Dayu Palace, the local tyrant of the region.

As the name suggested, the Dayu Palace was the ruler of the Dayu Region. The master of that palace was recognized by the Snow Kingdom, and at the same time, he was also the number one expert in the region and one of the three Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

The Three Hegemons referred to the Scarlet Island, the Golden-sun Sect, and the Holy Prefecture. They were powerful, and their forces were deep-rooted in that region.

Jiu Xi, who Jian Wushuang had killed in the Green Fire World, was a Core Disciple of the Holy Prefecture, and her grievance had been on Jian Wushuang since then. If Jian Wushuang met another Core Disciple of the Holy Prefecture, that person would know that Jian Wushuang had killed one of his companions.

“The Holy Prefecture is really powerful.”

Jian Wushuang praised inwardly while reading the information on the Holy Prefecture.

There were four Mansion Masters in the Holy Prefecture, and they were all the Universe Gods in the Second Heaven. Jiu Xi’s master was among them.

There were also more than 20 Universe Gods of the First Heaven in the prefecture, and one of them had even caught Jian Wushuang’s attention.

That person was Universe God Qing Yang.

He was the number one genius of the prefecture, and he was said to have cultivated for less than ten thousand years before he passed the God Test to become a Universe God in the First Heaven. He was also rumored to have almost reached the peak of that realm.

“Before her death, that woman had said that her master was a Mansion Master of the Holy Prefecture and her Senior Brother was the number one genius—Universe God Qing Yang. I didn’t pay much attention to her words at that time, but now it seems that I’m in big trouble.”?Jian Wushuang sighed.

Although he was as powerful as the Universe God in the First Heaven, there were three kinds of Universe Gods: elementary, advanced, and Peak.

At best, he could battle an advanced Universe God. By displaying a Secret Skill, he could make himself as powerful as a Universe God in the Peak of the First Heaven. Therefore, there were some people in the Holy Prefecture who were still able to kill him.

As for that Universe God Qing Yang, Jian Wushuang was no match for him.

“It seems that I have to be careful from this moment on. If I’m targeted by Holy Prefecture, I’ll be killed.”?Jian Wushuang murmured.

He then continued reading the information on the Golden-sun Sect.

“The Golden-sun Sect is even more powerful than the Holy Prefecture.”?Jian Wushuang gasped inwardly in admiration.

There were more than 30 Universe Gods in the Golden-sun Sect, and the master of the sect was said to be a Universe God at the peak of the Second Heaven.

There were also countless experts in the sect.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed when he glanced at the information on an expert of the Golden-sun Sect.

The information read: “The monarch of the Jin Kingdom—Jin Feng!”

He had killed this person in the Green Fire World, and he never thought that this person would be the monarch of the Jin Kingdom as well as an expert of the Golden-sun Sect. According to the information, Jian Wushang also learned that the monarch had a good relationship with the Sect Master and was said to be the master’s brother.
