Jian Wushuang thought for a while and followed King of Venomous Worms’s advice.

After all, it was good to learn more.

Then he set out to the selection contest of the fairies meeting.

The preliminary selection contest was held in each town of the Blood Jade Land. Universe gods or above could attend, but only those who passed the preliminary selection contest could enter into the final contest of the fairies meeting.

When Jian Wushuang arrived, he was shocked.

The boundless battlefield was full of tens of thousands of people.

However, only one percent of them, or one hundred thousand of them, had come here for the selection contest.

They were Universe Gods from three different heavens.

Jian Wushuang soon understood how the selection contest worked.

Two parts: exploring the Nine Boundaries Tower and the Inadvertent Dreamland.

The former one was a test of skills, while the latter was of consciousness.

Anyone who passed these two tests had access to the fairies meeting.

“The Nine Boundaries Tower is quite famous in the East Royal Sanctuary. It is a good opportunity to know how much you have improved your swordsmanship. You could have a try.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“But I don’t intend to attend the contest…” Jian Wushuang said.

“But you can still go to the preliminary test without attending the fairies meeting.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Can I?”

“Of course!”

So Jian Wushuang signed up for the preliminary test.

The he waited with the others on the battlefield.

As he waited, half of a month passed.

“How low the efficiency is…” Jian Wushuang complained.

“It is because more than one hundred thousand Universe gods are attending the selection, which is also why the selection contest is held ten years ahead of the fairies contest.” King of Venomous Worms explained.

“Don’t worry. The one who will take you to the Lineage of Star hasn’t come. You can wait patiently.”

So Jian Wushuang continued waiting.

Almost one day passed.

“Next, Cheng Wushuang!”

The announcement of the host sparked a heated discussion in the battlefield.

“Cheng Wushuang!”

“The top genius of the Lion Heart Town!”

“He is also joining the preliminary selection contest? But I have heard that he is already the disciple of a tribe?”

“Passing the selection contest is a piece of cake to him.”

The discussion continued.

All eyes were on one person.

He wore a white robe and held a folding fan. He looked refined, with a charming smile.

He was the well-known top genius in the Lion Heart Town.

Cheng Wushuang walked to the Nine Boundaries Tower slowly.

Jian Wushuang was also watching.

“His name is quite similar to yours, huh?” King of Venomous Worms said amusedly.

But Jian Wushuang didn’t care.

After all, it was common for people to share the same name as others in the vast Eternal Chaotic World.

“How many levels could he achieve?” Jian Wushuang wondered.

After a while the result was announced.

“Cheng Wushuang. The eleventh level of the Nine Boundaries Tower. The fourth levels of the Inadvertent Dreamland.”

The spectators were excited.

“He passed!”

“The criteria is eleventh level of the Nine Boundaries Tower and the fourth levels of the Inadvertent Dreamland. And he passed more than that!”

“He is the first one in the Lion Heart Town to pass the preliminary contest!”

Everyone showed their admiration.

From the past month, he was the first one to have passed the contest.

With all eyes on him, the refined Cheng Weshuang walked down from the tower.

“Next, Jian Wushuang.”

After the announcement, the battlefield turned silent.

Even Cheng Wushuang paused mid-step.

“Jian Wushuang?” Cheng Wushuang was interested.

Another discussion was sparked.

“Interesting. Jian Wushuang after Cheng Wushuang.”

“Two Wushuangs in the Lion Heart Town?”

“And they go the contest one after the other? What a coincidence!”

Everyone was interested.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate to move forward.

All were looking at him.

As Jian Wushuang was entering into the Lion Heart Town, Cheng Wushuang asked him indifferently, “You are…Jian Wushuang?”

Jian Wushuang paused, looked at Cheng Wushuang and nodded.

“You’d better change your name. Not everyone deserves this unique name.”

Jian Wushuang sneered, “My name was given to me by my parents and I cannot change it. By the way, how would you know whether or not I deserve it?”

Then, Jian Wushuang continued to move forward and went into the Nine Boundaries Tower.

Cheng Wushuang didn’t leave. He waited on the battlefield.
