Chapter 936: Primordial Great Sin

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The fierce battle between the remaining Dao Masters of the two camps continued. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The battlefield was divided into three sections: Emperor Leng against Emperor Xiao; Lord of Cercis Island against Xia Tao; and Xue Lingtian against Xia Yu. Emperor Leng was a little weaker than Emperor Xiao, but she was still persevering.

Lord of Cercis Island was evenly-matched with Xia Tao.

The only confrontation where one opponent was clearly superior was the one between Xue Lingtian and Xia Yu.

“How could this be? How could Master Blood Saber be so powerful?”

Both shocked and horrified, Xia Yu could barely keep fighting on. He appeared to be in a very pathetic state.

Xue Lingtian’s strength was far beyond his expectations.

He became a Rank Three expert after opening three Dao and his Dao was fairly strong. Even so, Xue Lingtian completely crushed him to the point where he could barely put up a fight.

Xue Lingtian was also a Rank Three expert but his Dao was even stronger. Moreover, he possessed an extraordinary saber which was much more powerful than Xia Yu’s Emperor Weapon.

Fortunately, Xia Yu had a Dao which was especially used for defense. Otherwise, he would be utterly defeated.

“I’ve fought him before but he wasn’t this strong then,”?Xia Yu thought.

Just then…

“Buzz!”

Out of nowhere, an unimaginably cold aura erupted.

The aura seemed to have frozen the entire battlefield, even time and space.

The Dao Masters in the imperial palace halted their movements the moment they detected the aura.

“T-That’s…”

They turned to look at the source of the icy-cold aura in surprise.

They were startled to see who it was.

Emperor Xiao and Emperor Leng, who had been fighting fiercely in the center of the battlefield, also stopped after detecting the aura. Then, they realized it came from their daughter.

“No!”?Emperor Xiao’s expression changed drastically.

“Mad! She’s gone mad!” Emperor Leng cried, appearing terrified. “She released the Seal? Does she want to die?”

Only both of them knew just what the Seal was for.

That was why both of them were so shocked.

Leng Rushuang looked up, her beautiful eyes filled with endless killing intent.

“Swoosh!”

In a flash, she appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

She faced Elder He with her back against Jian Wushuang.

“You’re the one who hurt him?”

Her voice was as cold as the Nine Serenities.

Elder He frowned, not knowing the reason for Leng Rushuang’s sudden change. However, her cold aura frightened him.

Nevertheless, he nodded without hesitation in response to her question. He wouldn’t show fear as a Rank Two Dao Master.

He was ready to follow up with a verbal answer.

But before he could open his mouth, Leng Rushuang was already taking action.

She appeared in front of Elder He, moving as swiftly and unpredictably as a ghost.

She was so fast that it felt as if she was really a specter.

Before Elder He could react, she patted his forehead with her beautiful and fair palm.

It was a simple, gentle pat.

The moment her palm came into contact with his forehead, a terrible chill took over his entire body. The coldness was the result of Leng Rushuang’s Icy Heart Poison.

Elder He was stupefied as his body started to turn white, first from the forehead, then to the face, then to the torso, and finally the whole body. In the end, he was turned into an ice sculpture.

Then, as a random gale of energy swept the area, the ice sculpture shattered into countless pieces before eventually vanishing in the Void.

In a split of a second, a Rank Two Dao Master had disappeared in a puff of smoke!

Those who witnessed this became horrified, including the Dao Masters on the battlefield.

They had watched a Rank Two Dao Master turned into an ice sculpture while alive and then broken into pieces.

What kind of skill was Leng Rushuang using?

“T-This…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of amazement.

He had seen this skill before.

He had seen Leng Rushuang kill with the same skill in the Ancient World. But they were now in the Eternal World, and the Dao Masters here were far more powerful.

Elder He was a Rank Two Dao Master whom Jian Wushuang couldn’t win against even after using his full strength, yet Leng Rushuang was able to kill him with a gentle pat.

“Great Sin!”

“Primordial Great Sinner!”

“Oh my God!”

King Gu called out in horror, his voice reverberating in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Primordial Great Sinner? What’s that?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

“There’s no time to explain the details but basically, your little girlfriend’s life is a tragedy. She’s destined to suffer endless torture and the reason should be related to her parents,” Gu King said solemnly.

“She’s destined to suffer?” Jian Wushuang was startled.

Leng Rushuang was expressionless after killing Elder He and merely looked around coldly.

“Who else wants to hurt him?”

There was an unfathomable killing intent in her voice.

Her cold voice and the surging icy aura around her made every Dao Master on the battlefield ill at ease.

Xia Mang had already run far away in fear.

“This is madness!” Emperor Leng bellowed, staring straight at her daughter.

“Shuang’er, are you crazy? How can you break the Seal in your body just for Jian Wushuang? Don’t you know what you’ll face after doing this?”

“There’ll be endless pain and torture! It’ll be a life worse than death!”

“Is such a life worth it just for the sake of a man?”
