Chapter 3595: News

“Has the Heavenly Sword Marquis made a breakthrough?” Star Saint Master suddenly asked.

“A breakthrough?” The surrounding people were shocked.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang was only at the Immortal Saint Realm. The reason why others thought he was a Principles Master was because he had refined a treasure that could hide his divine power aura. With the strength of a Principles Master, he could not see through it.

Before Jian Wushuang disappeared, his battle strength had already reached the sixth realm. If he made a breakthrough and became a Principles Master during these years, his battle strength would reach the strongest level among Principles Masters, it was understandable.

However...

“No, I saw the mirror image of the battle between the Heavenly Sword Marquis and the five Blood Spirit Kings. The aura of the Heavenly Sword Marquis in the image is still very ordinary. He should still be using the treasure to hide his aura. If he made a breakthrough, there is no need for him to hide it. In other words, he is indeed still an Immortal Saint,” Axe One Master said seriously.

“The Immortal Saint can easily kill someone at the pinnacle of the six realm?” When the Seven Emotions Master thought of this, he felt as if the world was spinning.

“Although I don’t know what’s going on, my little friend Heavenly Sword Marquis already has the strongest strength among the Principles Masters. This is definitely a joyous occasion for us.” Marquis Duan Yu said with some excitement.

“That’s right. I was a little puzzled earlier. I don’t know why the Palace Master thinks so highly of this Heavenly Sword Marquis. However, I finally understand now. The potential of this Heavenly Sword Marquis is simply too terrifying and unbelievable. His improvement speed is even more shocking. The Immortal Saint is already considered invincible among the Principles Masters. With such strength...I really don’t know what will happen when he breaks through to become a Principles Master in the future.” Axe One Master said while clenching his hands.

“From the looks of it, if he breaks through to become a Principles Master, his battle prowess will be able to contend against a Ruler,” Star Saint Master said.

Everyone was extremely excited when they heard this.

However, the four of them quickly calmed down.

“Previously, I was worried that the Heavenly Sword Marquis would be in danger after being targeted by so many people. However, from the looks of it, I was worried for nothing. With the strength that he has displayed now, there will definitely be no ignorant people among the Principles Masters who will find trouble with him. The only ones who pose a threat to him are probably experts at the Ruler Realm. However, there aren’t many experts at the Ruler Realm in this territory to begin with. Who would be so bored as to lower their status and attack an Immortal Saint?” Axe One Master said with a smile.

“Yes, but we have to be careful. Palace Master’s good friend is about to arrive at the Wuxin Lake. As long as he picks up the Heavenly Sword Marquis and brings him back to the Star Palace, he will be safe,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“When we return to the Star Palace, I want to ask him what he has been through all these years and why his strength has improved so much,” Seven Emotions Master snorted.

Hearing this, the others also laughed.

They were also curious about Jian Wushuang’s strength and progress. Therefore, when Jian Wushuang returned safely, they would definitely ask him.

…

One of the three battlefields, Bloodstone Mountain!

Bloodstone Mountain was absolutely no less dangerous than Devil Smoke Valley, especially in the depths of Bloodstone Mountain. It was even more dangerous than the depths of Devil Smoke Valley. Therefore, those who dared to wander in the depths of Bloodstone Mountain…usually, the lowest level was an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm.

On the bloody ground, there were pieces of bloody stones. These bloody stones were extremely hard, and their materials were much harder than many treasures used to forge weapons. And these bloody stones…were also the only things in the Bloodstone Mountain that could be trampled on. As for the bloody ground around the bloody stones, it was indeed full of dangers. It was like a swamp. No matter who it was, as long as their body touched the bloody ground…they would immediately be sucked into the land.

If it was a Ruler Realm expert who was swallowed by the blood-colored land, they could still rely on their own tyrannical strength to escape. However, if anyone below the Ruler Realm fell into the blood-colored land, they would die without a doubt. There was no chance of survival.

At this moment, on one of the blood-colored stones in the center of the blood-colored land, a young man with blood-red hair and blood-red robes was sitting cross-legged with a blood-red demonic saber on his back. His gaze was misty, as if he was reminiscing about something.

At that moment, a figure charged over from the void not too far away.

“Blood Butcher, you’re here.”

The person who came was dressed in a loose long robe and looked very young. When he saw the blood-red-robed young man on the blood rock, he immediately revealed a smile.

“Heavenly Scar, why are you here?” The blood-red-robed young man glanced at the person who came, and his expression was extremely cold.

“You are still so cold. No wonder you don’t have a single good friend after so many years. Even I can barely be considered half a good friend of yours.” The person landed on the blood stone where the blood-haired youth was, letting out a light breath, the Heavenly Scar Divine Master said, “Blood Butcher, I came here specially to tell you a piece of news.”

“Speak.” The blood-haired blood-robed youth was still as cold as ever.

“Not too long ago, a major incident occurred in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley. This incident caused a huge commotion among the various powers in this territory. Of course, you have nothing to worry about. You are no longer under any of the powers, and you only have half a good friend like me. If I didn’t tell you, you wouldn’t have known.” The Heavenly Scar Divine Master smiled faintly.

The blood-haired, blood-robed youth remained silent, as if he had admitted it.

Indeed, this blood-haired, blood-robed youth had no attachments, and he didn’t have any good friends. He only knew how to go adventuring by himself, to increase his strength. If one were to ask who was the most uninformed expert who roamed this territory…it would definitely be this blood-haired, blood-robed man, Blood Slaughter Emperor.

“I have a mirror image here. Take a look for yourself.” The Heavenly Scar Divine Master took out a token and handed it to the Blood Slaughter Emperor.

The Blood Slaughter Emperor took it and began to browse through it.

When he saw the mirror image of five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm attacking Jian Wushuang at the same time, the Blood Slaughter Emperor was still indifferent at first, and his expression did not change at all, however, when he saw Jian Wushuang attacking...his expression changed immediately.

“An absolute art at the Ruler Realm?”

He narrowed his eyes and focused on the scene. When he finished watching the scene, his expression became extremely excited and his eyes were filled with excitement.

“He created an absolute art at the Ruler Realm, and there’s more than one. Amazing!” He could not help but exclaim in admiration.

“Tsk tsk, this is the first Principles Master that your Blood Slaughter Emperor personally said is amazing, right?” The Heavenly Scar Divine Master beside him said in a strange manner.
