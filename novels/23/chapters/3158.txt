“Heavenly Sword Marquis? Which Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“Could it be Heavenly Sword Marquis, who killed a rank seven True Saint in the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion? That big monster?”

“It’s him. It must be him. Only such a monster would provoke the three Principles Masters to come here personally!”

“He’s Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

The crowd immediately became noisy, and countless people looked at Jian Wushuang with shock and admiration.

The white-haired elder and the others, who had previously called Jian Wushuang Brother Han, were even more stunned.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Mountain Thunder Fort Master stared at Jian Wushuang in astonishment. “He’s Heavenly Sword Marquis? How could he come to our Mountain Thunder Fort?”

Mountain Thunder Fort Master was a genuine Invincible Saint with a high level of knowledge. When he saw the mirror image of Jian Wushuang fighting with Bai Yuan, he was amazed that Jian Wushuang was an incredible genius, no one in the entire divine beginning world could compare to him.

But now, this super genius had sneaked into his Mountain Thunder Fort?

The Lord of Mountain Thunder Fort was also shocked.

“You should be from the three Saint Realms, right?” Jian Wushuang stared at the three rule masters with a gloomy face and said, “I want to know how you found us.”

“Haha, boy, you have underestimated this world. You have underestimated the skills of the cultivators in this world. Yes, after you left the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion, you were very careful and did not attack again. You even deliberately disguised your appearance. It is difficult for ordinary people to find you, but we have a special way to find you so that you can’t escape.” The red-haired handsome man chuckled.

“Besides, the three of us don’t have much to do with the three Saint Realms. As for our origins, you’ll know after a while. As for now, you’d better come with us.”

“Come with you? I’m sorry, I have no interest in going with you.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold! As soon as he finished speaking, a majestic power swept up from his body. It came from the ruler seal!

The ruler seal ruled over space and time.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was using the ruler seal with all his strength in an attempt to regain control of the surrounding area.

However, the power of the ruler seal had been fully exerted by Jian Wushuang. The formation of the ruler seal had also swept up, but it could not affect the surrounding space and time at all.

“I can’t even move it at all?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Since he had obtained the ruler seal from Xue Bei, he had used it many times.

The power of the ruler seal had never disappointed him. Today, facing the three rule masters, he knew that his strength could not contend with them, so he wanted to use the ruler seal to regain control of the surrounding space-time and then escape.

However, he did not expect that the power of the ruler seal could not affect the space-time he was in.

“Haha, he is indeed capable.” The wicked and charming elder, Void Master, who was one of the three Principles Masters, let out a cold laugh, “The treasure he just used should also be a space-time treasure, and it is not ordinary. Although it has not reached the level of a holy treasure, it should be a top-tier holy treasure.”

“Boy, you have a lot of good treasures. Unfortunately, they are useless.” The red-haired handsome man sneered, but his eyes were full of disdain as he looked at Jian Wushuang. “You only used the top-tier holy treasure, but the one that can completely seal the space and time around you is the Void Master next to me. He used a genuine supreme treasure that can seal the space and time!”

“You are a rank four True Saint. How can you use a top-tier holy treasure as compared to a supreme treasure driven by a Principles Master?”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

No wonder he could not move at all. It turned out that the wicked old man was using a holy treasure.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, no matter what, you’re Only a rank four True Saint. Although you can compete with a rank seven True Saint, you’re no different from an ant in front of the three of us. If you follow us obediently, you’ll suffer less. Otherwise…” the brown-haired young man’s eyes turned cold.

Jian Wushuang merely snorted and did not say anything. However, the Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hand. He had used all his secret skills, allowing his strength to reach his peak.

However, even in his peak condition, Jian Wushuang was not confident that he could face the three Principles Masters in front of him.

“You are so stubborn. Xin Sect, I’ll leave it to you. Remember not to kill him. Don’t kill him by accident. Just seriously injure him or put him into a deep sleep so that we can bring him back,” the red-haired handsome man said.

Xin Zong was the brown-haired young man. Hearing the red-haired handsome man’s words, he nodded and then looked directly at Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, a terrifying power was silently coming toward Jian Wushuang.

This power was soul power.

Facing a Principles Master, Jian Wushuang had no ability to resist at all. In an instant, the powerful soul power entered his sea of consciousness and instantly shattered the exquisite pagoda that had been protecting his real soul, then, it heavily hit Jian Wushuang’s real soul.

Jian Wushuang’s real soul was severely injured and 90% of it was destroyed in an instant. Less than 10% of his soul power remained.

Logically speaking, if a cultivator’s real soul suffered such a serious injury, even if he did not die, his soul would fall into a deep sleep and it would take a long time for him to wake up again.

Xin Zong’s goal was to make Jian Wushuang’s soul fall into a deep sleep. He could have destroyed Jian Wushuang’s soul directly, but he held back at the last moment.

“That’s enough.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xin Zong spoke.

He was very satisfied with his result, and he also thought that Jian Wushuang would fall into a deep sleep immediately.

However, Jian Wushuang, who was standing in front of him, suddenly opened his eyes and shot toward Xin Zong with a fierce light in his eyes.

“What?” Xin Zong was stunned.

“What’s going on?” The red-haired handsome man and the Demonic Elder did not understand either.

“I don’t know. I just used a soul attack and destroyed more than 90% of his soul. If I’m not mistaken, his soul must have fallen into a deep sleep. But now…I can’t see any damage to his soul, let alone a deep sleep.” Xin Zong frowned. “Did he just swallow a treasure or elixir that can restore his soul power in the shortest amount of time?”
