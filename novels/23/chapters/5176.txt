Chapter 5181 - 5181: Once and for All

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He was the true Prince of an Emperor, the only one at that. The Emperor’s bloodline, after successfully merging with the Dao, was incredibly potent, making it almost impossible for him to have more offspring. This sole heir was doted upon extravagantly. The Emperor even allocated a third of the world’s territories to be managed by MO Long, indulging his imperial desires.

In terms of innate talent, God-Emperor MO Long was rather ordinary. It was only due to his father’s formidable bloodline that he comprehended the immensely powerful Great Dao of the source. Additionally, he possessed numerous mystical treasures, which granted him peak strength.

However, these were all external factors. Every Grand Yan Immortal sought the same ultimate goal: merging with the Dao. Only by successfully merging could one become an Emperor and truly transcend the universe, becoming a supreme being.

This was the Dao pursued by Luo Hao.

At this moment, he couldn’t afford to fail. Even if it meant death, he was determined to perish in the process of merging with the Dao.

“Excuse me, may we talk?” Luo Hao transmitted his voice.

Although Hu Qings power was not as strong as his, he still possessed the strength of an ordinary top-tier Grand Yan Immortal. Along with Jian

Wushuang and the others burning their innate Yan power, there was hope to contend against God-Emperor MO Long. If they persisted for a few more hours, the First Prince of their Daluo Realm would arrive.

At that time, despair would befall God-Emperor MO Long.

Hu Qing hesitated for a moment and then cautiously inquired, “What do you want to discuss?”

“Cooperation.”

On the surface, they clashed fiercely, but in the shadows, they plotted against the external God-Emperor MO Long.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in a mountain cave, oblivious to the conflicts of the outside world.

Channeling his Yan power from the source, he continuously repaired his damaged divine body. From an external perspective, the speed of his bodys restoration was visible to the naked eye, a pace unheard of in the entire universe.

“Just a bit more. I wonder if Hu Qing can hold on!” Jian Wushuang felt a sense of urgency.

His gaze flickered over the floating identity token.

Trial Participant: Jian Wushuang

Achievements: 400,000 Ranking: 4,768

Trial Time: 3 years

Trial Duration: 30 years

There were still over 20 years left. Although he wasn’t in a hurry, opportunities like today were rare. If he could defeat the top 100 participants, both he and Hu Qing could enter the top 1,000 rankings, a position they could maintain until the end of the trial.

This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one he couldn’t afford to let slip away.

He glanced at the rankings of God-Emperor MO Long and Luo Hao—one in the five-hundreds, the other in the nine-hundreds.

According to Luo Hao, these powerful beings were mostly not near the mountain ranges; they mostly fought on the main continents. Even though 30 percent of the original planet’s Grand Yan Immortals had fallen, leaving roughly a million, realistically speaking, only tens of thousands dared to battle.

The rest of the Grand Yan Immortals who knew they had no chance mostly hid within various mountain ranges.

70 percent of the original planet’s territory consisted of mountains, 20 percent were deep pits left by lakes, and the remaining 10 percent constituted the continents.

In this realm, which was exceedingly small for Grand Yan Immortal, one could easily encounter numerous Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals with just a casual stroll.

Various factions banded together, sweeping the four corners and hunting down solitary wanderers.

In such a perilous environment, breaking into the top thousand required numerous battles. His strength could at most match that of top-grade Grand Yan Immortals, with perhaps a slight advantage in speed.

On this continent, his speed would no longer be an advantage because there were far too many formidable individuals. Surrounded and pursued, he couldn’t effectively utilize his speed advantage.

Now, the only opportunity lay right before his eyes, and he had to seize it firmly.

“Whew!” Exhaling sharply, Jian Wushuang slowly got up.

“Faster recovery than the last time!” His narrow escape this time had further strengthened his source and his Thought power had grown significantly stronger than before.

A deep hum echoed through the air as a pitch-black, elongated spear burst out from the cave. With an unstoppable momentum, it pierced through the entire mountain peak and headed straight for the God-Emperor MO Long, who stood proudly in the sky.

Nio Long turned slightly, catching the spear that streaked past him in front of his eyes.

“He isn’t injured at all. Could that aura have been a disguise?” God-Emperor MO Long was somewhat surprised.

He knew that Hu Qing had intercepted Luo Hao below. Ever since Luo Hao had gone down, he hadn’t felt that sense of impending danger. This had puzzled him. Now, Jian Wushuang had suddenly emerged again, and it seemed like he hadn’t been harmed at all.

“Perhaps I’ve been too cautious,” murmured God-Emperor MO Long to himself, his figure suddenly descending deep into the ravine.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang emerged from the cave.

“MO Long, your fate is sealed today!” Jian Wushuangs eyes glinted with cold determination.

After much planning, the two of them had finally walked into their trap.

“Hu Qing, activate the grand formation!”

Hu Qing, who had been fighting with Luo Hao, revealed a slight smile. He directly addressed Luo Hao, “I take my leave for now.”

“What?” Luo Hao was stunned. What did this mean? Weren’t they just having a peaceful conversation moments ago?

How could this seemingly honest monk just flee like this?

Before he could react, the entire canyon was filled with flying sand and rolling stones, the world spinning around him.

The grand formation shifted, relocating Luo Hao from an open space to a hillside. The sky that was once above his head now appeared beneath his feet, and the mighty divine mountain stood above him. A tremendous pressure engulfed him instantly.

“Huh?” God-Emperor MO Longs face also paled. “How can there be such a grand formation here?”

He had been keeping an eye on Luo Hao and the monk. They couldn’t possibly have set up the formation in such a short time, could they?

Whoosh!

In an instant, MO Long was also transported to another location.

“Luo Hao!” MO Longs face darkened.

“MO Long!” Luo Hao’s expression was equally grim.

They exchanged a glance and instantly understood – they had been tricked by Jian Wushuang!

The threat they felt was escalating, sinking MO Longs heart.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang wielded an ordinary long sword that appeared before them instantly, accompanied by Huiqing.

“Brother Luo Hao, we’ve come to assist you!” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

Hu Qing nodded in agreement.

Upon hearing this, God-Emperor MO Long hurriedly retreated, putting some distance between himself and Luo Hao.

The grand formation had weakened his power by 30 percent. At this moment, he was just an ordinary peak Grand Yan Immortal. Once Luo Hao activated his source, he would be on par with MO Long. Although he had some treasures and tricks up his sleeve, facing a one-on-three situation, he dared not be careless.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“God-Emperor MO Long!” Luo Hao opened his mouth, glancing at Jian Wushuang and Hu Qing. Eventually, he took a deep breath and shouted, “Your time has come!”

Although it was just a breath, he had already calculated countless times in his mind. Instead of being a dog to MO Long and risking being killed in the end, he decided it was better to cooperate with Jian Wushuang. Together, they could confront MO Long.

In his view, Jian Wushuang and the others were relatively strong. Even with the grand formation, the three of them could at most contend with MO Long.

It they could delay a little longer, the First Prince of the Daluo Realm would arrive. By then, the initiative would be in his hands.

Moreover, this was also an opportunity to weaken MO Longs strength. When the other Princes from his clan arrived, he could reap the benefits without doing much, making it the best course of action..
