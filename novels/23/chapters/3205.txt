Chapter 3206: Heading to the Blood Wave Realm

——

“What? Even if I really want to fight with the Heavenly Sword Marquis, what does it have to do with you guys?” Yue Yu glanced at Qian Hongzi and the other two unhappily.

“It doesn’t have anything to do with you guys, but Yue Yu, don’t blame me for not reminding you. Although you can fight Duan Lang to a draw, the Heavenly Sword Marquis’ methods are quite special. He has mastered the shadowless escape technique, and when he uses it, it can be used without a trace. Duan Lang is qualified to fight him because he has the Black Demon Domain that can sense his position. As for you…” Qian Hongzi smiled strangely.

“If you fight with the Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’m afraid you won’t even be able to touch the corner of his clothes. You’ll only be a living target for him.”

“Shadowless escape art?” Yue Yu frowned slightly. He had cultivated in the True Martial Mystic Realm for a very long time. Naturally, he had seen the iceberg left by the Master of the Bloodshed God. Naturally, he had some understanding of the shadowless escape art.

“I’m just saying. How could I really fight with him?” Yue Yu said.

“Haha, if you really want to fight with Heavenly Sword Marquis, we won’t stop you.” Qian Hongzi laughed.

Duan Lang and Feixue also had gloating smiles on their faces.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” Qian Hongzi pulled Jian Wushuang to the side and said, “You already know Yue Yu. He’s silly. You Don’t have to pay attention to him. Let me introduce him to you, Di Hao!”

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the cold man in a blood-red robe standing next to him.

The cold man had a cold face and long scarlet hair. His long and narrow eyes were extremely cold, and the two-meter-long axe on his back was quite conspicuous.

Di Hao was widely recognized as the strongest expert in the Temporal Temple among the Immortal Saints!

Qian Hongzi was also an Invincible Saint, but he knew that he was no match for Di Hao.

“Giant axe?” Jian Wushuang looked at the giant axe on Di Hao’s back and frowned slightly.

It must be known that the cultivators in the Temporal Temple all comprehended the principles of time and space.

The principles of time and space focused on speed and power, so they were not very good at it. Therefore, the cultivators who comprehended the principles of time and space usually chose more nimble weapons.

For example, Jian Wushuang was good at swordsmanship.

Duan Lang used a spear.

Qian Hongzi used a saber as a weapon. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

They were both more agile and could perfectly cooperate with space-time principles.

However, Di Hao used a giant axe as a weapon. The giant axe was powerful and heavy, so it was not suitable to use space-time principles.

As if seeing Jian Wushuang’s surprise, Qian Hongzi said softly, “Brother Heavenly Marquis, you probably don’t know that Di Hao comprehended both the space-time principles and the destruction principles at the same time. His attainments in the destruction principles are higher than the space-time principles. The giant axe on his back has been refined by an expert. Not only can he control it with the destruction principles, but he can also control it with the space-time principles.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang suddenly understood.

Di Hao glanced at Jian Wushuang and nodded slightly.

Jian Wushuang naturally smiled and nodded in response.

“It seems like what you said before, Di Hao is more withdrawn.” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

“Yes, but don’t take it to heart. Although he is more withdrawn, he is still easy to get along with.” Qian Hongzi said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Alright.” The grand voice came out of the mouth of the Chaos Master. Immediately, Jian Wushuang and the others shut their mouths and looked at the Chaos Master.

“The Blood wave Realm is about to open, and every time it opens, the battles inside will be unusually fierce and even crazy. Although your strength is at the top level among the Immortal Saints and six of you are working together, you still have to be careful in the Blood Wave Realm.”

“After all, those who can enter the Blood Wave Realm are all very powerful. Even the weakest should be a Peak True Saint of the seventh rank, and most of them are Peak Saints. There are also many who are Invincible Saints. If you are not careful enough, you will also be in danger of dying. You have to know that in the history of our Temporal Temple, there have been precedents of people dying in the Blood Wave Realm.”

“300,000 years ago, two people died in the Blood Wave Realm. 2.8 million years ago, only two people survived. 30 million years ago, it was the worst time for the Temporal Temple. All five people who entered the Temporal Temple died. Not a single one survived.”

Hunyuan Master’s deep voice rang in Jian Wushuang and the others’ ears.

Jian Wushuang and the others looked solemn.

They did not dare to underestimate the fierce competition and slaughter in the Blood Wave Realm.

Just as Hunyuan Master had said, the Temporal Temple had suffered heavy losses in the Blood Wave Realm. During the fierce competition and slaughter, many Peak Saints who yearned for the opportunities in the Blood Wave Temple would be killed, they did not care whether they were from the Temporal Temple or not. As long as they were in their way, they would be killed.

“Because the battle in the Blood Wave Realm is crazy, the Temporal Temple will give each of you a drop of divine power as a support,” Hunyuan Master said as he flipped his hand, immediately, drops of divine power floated toward Jian Wushuang and the others.

Jian Wushuang and the others each received a drop of divine power.

Divine power was very useful at critical moments.

However, in fact, not only Jian Wushuang, but Qian Hongzi, Duan Lang, and the others had already made some preparations. No one had prepared a few drops of divine power, which was enough for them to use in the Blood Wave Realm.

“It’s about time, let’s go.”

Without saying anything else, the Hunyuan Master led Jian Wushuang and the others away from the time-space island.

After leaving the special time-space where the time-space island was located, they teleported and hurried on their way.

In less than half a day, they arrived at a huge sea area.

In the middle of the sea area, there was a cliff.

“We’re here.”

The Hunyuan Master landed on the cliff.

At this moment, there were many cultivators on the cliff. At a glance, there seemed to be more than a hundred people.

“Is this the entrance to the Blood Wave Realm?” Jian Wushuang looked at the crowd gathered in front of him.

“The Blood Wave Realm is very special in the Divine Beginning Realm. No one knows its exact location. People in the Divine Beginning Realm can only enter through the spatial passage that opens once every 100,000 years. There are a total of ten spatial passages into the Blood Wave Realm, three of which are in the First Heaven, Second Heaven, and Third Heaven. The last one is on the broken moon cliff in the boundless sea beyond the Third Heaven, which is where we are now,” Hunyuan Master explained..
