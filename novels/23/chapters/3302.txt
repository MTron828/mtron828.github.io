Whoosh!

The Heaven-cleaving skill was used again!

The Heaven-cleaving skill, in the name of Heaven-cleaving, eliminated the Heavenly Dao. This was the purpose of this divine power.

Countless years ago, Jian Wushuang’s master Xuan Yi had galloped through heaven and earth, vowing to kill this heaven. The Heaven-cleaving skill he had created was not only to use the innate advantage of his perfect life as much as possible! At the same time, this divine power was specifically aimed at the first level of the power of the will of heaven!

If the Heaven-cleaving skill was used to fight against a cultivator, it was enough to give Jian Wushuang an additional portion of the power of the will.

However, if Jian Wushuang was fighting against the heaven, the Heaven-cleaving skill would improve his strength far more than a portion of the power of the will could compare to!

Boom!

The sword light directly cut into the giant electric snake with a diameter of 100 meters. A large amount of electric light frantically spread out in all directions, but the electric snake was directly cut by the sword light from the center, this by the will of the will of the heavenly power of the terrifying electric snake, a moment will collapse.

But the sword shadow is not reduced, directly cut to the top of the endless void.

There, the will of the Heavenly Dao condensed power, but with the sword light cut, weng! World turbulence, a huge devour all of the vortex appeared out of thin air.

The vortex swallowed up all the power, only slowly dissipated after a long time, and that piece of void has completely calmed down, the supreme will of the heavenly power has disappeared.

“Disappeared? Disappeared?”

“The power of the will of the Heavenly Dao was defeated by a frontal attack?”

“The power of the will of the Heavenly Dao was defeated by a frontal attack? Only an expert of the fifth level of the void could do that, right?”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis has the battle strength of the fifth level of the Void? How is that possible?”

Countless people cried out in surprise. They did not dare to believe the scene in front of them.

The power of the will of the Heavenly Dao did not pose much of a threat to some powerful Principles Masters. After all, the will of the Heavenly Dao itself had too many restrictions. However, the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao represented the punishment of the heavens...to defeat the power of the will of heaven head-on, it indeed required the strength of the fifth void realm.

However, what everyone present did not know was that although Jian Wushuang did not have the battle strength of the fifth void realm, his Heaven-cleaving skill specifically targeted the power of the will of heaven. With Jian Wushuang’s current strength...although he still could not fully unleash the power of the Heaven-cleaving skill, even if he only used a part of it, with his current battle strength that was no less than the third void realm, it was enough to disperse the power of the will of heaven.

“Fortunately, my strength has greatly increased in the Blood Wave Temple, and my divine power has also increased a lot. Previously, every time I used the Heaven-cleaving skill, it was a huge burden for me and I could not use it again in a short period of time. But now, it is much easier for me to use the Heaven-cleaving skill. After a big battle, I can barely use it a few times,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

After the power of the will of heaven was dispersed, Jian Wushuang looked at the surrounding battlefield again.

“Kill!”

With a low roar, Jian Wushuang directly used the shadowless escape art and moved freely in the battlefield.

The shadowless escape art was shadowless and traceless, which was extremely strange.

Although everyone present was powerful and could sense his presence, his position changed surprisingly quickly. In addition to this big battle, it was a large-scale chaotic battle, with experts from both sides fighting fiercely, in such a situation, it was absolutely terrifying to have an assassin among them.

“Be careful!”

“Be careful of Heavenly Sword Marquis!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Bastard, think of a way to kill him!”

Many experts from the three Saint Realms were shocked and furious.

They originally had the advantage in numbers, but because of Jian Wushuang’s spacetime world, the gap between the two sides was completely closed. At this time, Jian Wushuang relied on his own assassination ability to wantonly assassinate on the battlefield, it made the experts of the three Saint Realms feel threatened.

Their original goal was to kill Jian Wushuang, but now, it was difficult for them to find an opportunity to kill Jian Wushuang. If one or two people attacked alone, they could not do anything to Jian Wushuang.

It could be said that because of Jian Wushuang’s attack, the situation of the battle began to favor the Temporal Temple’s side.

However, the situation only lasted for a short while before Jian Wushuang was faced with a crisis.

“Little guy, you have entered the battlefield unscrupulously. Don’t you think too little of the three Saint Realms?” A gentle voice rang out, and a black-robed figure had unknowingly arrived beside Jian Wushuang.

Upon hearing this voice, Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted. “The Sky Nether Master?”

That was right, it was Sky Nether Master.

Sky Nether Master, Star River Master, and eight treasures master led the experts to kill Jian Wushuang. Star River Master and Temple Master Bai Xing fought fiercely, while eight treasures master fought with Ba Cang. Only he...was not a suitable opponent.

After all, among the experts from the Temporal Temple, only Ba Cang, an expert of the fifth void realm, was here. The other strongest Master Hunyuan was only at the peak of the fourth void realm. As the battle began...Sky Nether Master first fought with Master Hunyuan. With the help of the spacetime world, Master Hunyuan was able to hold on for a while. However, this was because Sky Nether Master had not used his full strength.

Not long after Jian Wushuang rushed into the battlefield, Sky Nether Master immediately broke away from Master Hunyuan and approached Jian Wushuang.

Seeing the Sky Nether Master coming to Jian Wushuang’s side, the experts of the three Saint Realms were naturally overjoyed. On the other hand, the people of the Temporal Temple changed their expressions.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, retreat!” Ba Cang immediately shouted.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, come to me!” Chaos Master also shouted. In the current battlefield, only he could spare his hands to barely block the Sky Nether Master. Jian Wushuang’s best choice was to approach him.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang dashed toward Master Hunyuan.

Seeing this, Sky Nether Master smiled evilly. “Do you want to retreat now? Is it too late?”

Whoosh!

A black shadow whistled through the void. Like a ghost, Sky Nether Master appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. At the same time, his shriveled right hand slowly stretched out and turned into a sharp claw, it was continuously magnified in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Jian Wushuang instantly sensed the difference in strength between the two. He could not resist the claw at all.

Seeing that the Sky Nether Master’s sharp claw was about to grab his head, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. A crystal pearl had appeared in his hand out of nowhere. The surface of the pearl contained a layer of special power.

Jian Wushuang exerted force with his wrist and directly crushed the pearl. In an instant, a surge of power burst out from the exploded pearl!
