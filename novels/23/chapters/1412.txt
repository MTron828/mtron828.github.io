Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Dark Phoenix Pavilion was well-known in the Star Land. The majority of disciples there were female and only a tiny fraction were male.

Jian Wushuang and Lei Chao spent only a few days going through the wormhole before they arrived at the gate of the Dark Phoenix Pavilion.

Although Dark Phoenix Pavilion couldn’t rival the incomparable majesty of the Lineage of Star, it was also boundless and occupied a huge mountain range.

“Go and tell your master that we’ve arrived.” Lei Chao said coldly to a guard here.

“Please wait a moment, my lord.” The guard disciple immediately went to inform his master.

After just a moment, a graceful woman in purple surrounded by a large number of figures came from the Dark Phoenix Pavilion.

“Lei Chao, long time no see.” The woman stopped in front of Lei Chao and looked straight at him.

“Hello, Su Rou.” Lei Chao also responded. Obviously, they had known each other for a long time.

“A few days ago, I received a message from Hall Master Yuan. I knew that there would be a Real God in the stars and a disciple coming to visit my Pavilion. But I didn’t expect you to come. So, you seem to value this little guy a lot, huh?” The woman looked at Jian Wushuang with great interest.

“Now you know where I’m coming from. Just take us to the Mind Cliff.” Lei Chao said indifferently. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Don’t hurry.” Su Rou raised his eyebrows and at the same time turned around, saying, “Come with me.”

Lei Chao followed Su Rou and others to the Mind Cliff immediately.

On the way to the Mind Cliff.

“Lei Chao, is Su Rou your friend or something?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Um.” Lei Chao nodded slightly. “She is the master of Dark Phoenix Pavilion and also a Real God. We’ve made several acquaintances.”

“OK…” Jian Wushuang said.

And then Su Rou, who was leading the way ahead, suddenly turned around and asked Jian Wushuang, “What’s your name?”

“Jian Wushuang.” He answered politely.

“Disciples of the Star Palace?” Asked Su Rou.

“Yes.”

“Oh, good. I’ve long heard that all the disciples in Star Palace are extremely gifted. In my Dark Phoenix Pavilion there are also many disciples, but they are too proud and always at odds with each other. It brings me a lot of pressure. Now that you are a disciple from the Star Palace, you can help me deal with them and give them a lesson.” She smiled softly.

“Su Rou, we have no time to help you.” Lei Chao said.

“It won’t take too long. If he helps me, I can provide me a place in the Mind Cliff for free in return. How about that?” Su Rou smiled.

Jian Wushuang didn’t know how to respond.

Before he replied, Su Rou tried to persuade him. “Come with me, my disciples can’t wait to see you.”

She sped up.

Jian Wushuang looked at Lei Chao for help. Lei Chao frowned and whispered, “Jian Wushuang, I owed her a favor, and this is Dark Phoenix Pavilion, I can’t refuse her. Just follow her. It won’t take long.

“Fine.” Jian Wushuang followed Su Rou.

Soon, they arrived at a battlefield.

This was the place where the Dark Phoenix Pavilion held battles on weekdays. Now the battlefield was crowded with disciples from the Dark Phoenix Pavilion.

A few days ago when Su Rou had received a message from Hall Master Yuan, she had informed all her disciples of the coming of Jian Wushuang.

Many disciples seemed very excited.

For disciples from the Dark Phoenix Pavilion, the Lineage of Star was the absolute hegemony in the Star Land, with numerous admirable talents. Top geniuses of the Dark Phoenix Pavilion would only be normal disciples in the Lineage of Star.

And the best disciples of the Star Palace were the top of the top.

So many disciples in the Dark Phoenix Pavilion were curious about those from the Star Land and even envied them.

Those envying disciples thought that they were actually not inferior to disciples from the Star Land.

So, hearing Jian Wushuang coming, everyone was eager to have a look.

When Su Rou and Jian Wushuang arrived, disciples waiting in the battlefield got excited.

“Here comes the disciple of the Star Palace!”

“He looks just mediocre!”

“It’s difficult to distinguish one’s power simply by his breath or appearance. As a disciple from the Star Land, he must be excellent.”

Many disciples were having a heated discussion about Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could feel many beady eyes looking at him.

“Strong aggressiveness…” Jian Wushuang thought.

“All right, be quiet.” Su Rou started to speak.

Her voice was very plain and soft, but it sounded like thunder in the ears of every disciple in the battlefield.

Everyone in the battlefield immediately went quiet.

“I would like to introduce to you this disciple of the Star Palace, Jian Wushuang. It is a very rare opportunity to meet him in our Dark Phoenix Pavilion. You should cherish the chance.” Su Rou smiled softly.

As soon as she spoke, many of the disciples immediately got excited and aggressive.

“Su Rou is encouraging her disciples to challenge me?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Lei Chao decided to say something, “It’s unfair to us. We are just guests who want to go to the Mind Cliff.”

“Unfair?” Su Rou questioned “Was it fair that you left me alone? What I am doing to your disciple is nothing compared with what you did to me. ”

Lei Chao looked embarrassed.

Su Rou sneered: “I have always been in awe of the stars in Dark Phoenix Pavilion and absolutely daren’t cause difficulties for disciples the Lineage of Star. But this time is different. It’s you that brought him there.”

“I just want to challenge you, Lei Chao.” Su Rou said.
