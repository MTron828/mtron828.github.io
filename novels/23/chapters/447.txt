Chapter 448: Help Me, Swordsman!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After traveling along the path to the entrance, Jian Wushuang went inside the cave mansion at the bottom of the rift.

He looked around and noticed that there were five channels in front of him.

The cave mansion was a huge maze, and each channel led to a different place.

“The middle one leads to the inner layer.” Jian Wushuang squinted and gazed at it. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Spirit Lord had warned him to be careful in the outer layer, but Jian Wushuang’s chosen destination wasn’t the outer layer.

There were many opportunities in the outer layer, but they were insignificant opportunities that were only attractive to those Stage Three experts.

The Lords’ battlefield was in the inner layer!

The opportunities and treasures in the inner layer were much rarer.

The outer layer was not challenging for Jian Wushuang, so he was eager to go to the inner layer.

“Let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang chose the middle channel without any hesitation.

The map he received from Spirit Lord, though incomplete, clearly showed how to travel from the outer layer to the inner layer. Jian Wushuang just needed to follow the map.

Entering the channel, Jian Wushuang found that there were some secret chambers on both sides.

There were many secret chambers in the cave mansion. Most of which were empty, but a few of them hid some opportunities and treasures.

This was the goal of the experts from two camps who were exploring the outer layer.

Passing by all these secret chambers, Jian Wushuang continued walking directly towards the inner layer.

Right as he walked past the entrance to one of the channels.

Boom! Boom!

The sound of loud explosions reverberated through the cave mansion.

Bang!

A figure crashed into one of the stone walls of the cave mansion heavily enough cause a disturbance, but not enough to break the wall.

“Xue Yang, are you okay?” A blue-clothed lady arrived next to him.

“It’s nothing serious.” Xue Yang, a cold youth with sword-shaped eyebrows, raised his head.

“Xue Yang, Meng You.”

Three figures approached them. They were Long Xiang, Heaven Stone Castle Lord, and Fire Demon.

“Give me the Interspatial Ring you got in the secret chamber, or both of you will die!” A stream of killing intent surged from Long Xiang’s eyes.

Just now, he saw Xue Yang and Meng You get an Interspatial Ring from a secret chamber!

An Interspatial Ring!

Over these last few days, they had been searching for treasures in the secret chambers, but each secret chamber had only possessed one treasure.

Only one item to split.

None of them had found an Interspatial Ring.

No one except Xue Yang and Meng You.

So it was naturally quite valuable.

“Don’t even think about it,” Xue Yang said and snorted.

“Very well, it seems you’d rather choose death.” Long Xiang shouted, “Kill them!”

Long Xiang, Heaven Stone Castle Lord, and Fire Demon instantly attacked them at the same time.

“Run!”

Without hesitation, both Xue Yang and Meng You ran towards a different channel.

“You think you can run?” Long Xiang released a strong killing intent. As an expert at the Heaven-defying Level, he was much faster than Xue Yang and Meng You.

“Damn it!”

As he watched Long Xiang slowly catching up, Xue Yang’s face turned deathly pale. “He is faster than us, and once he catches us he will easily kill us.”

“Master Water Mirror is on the way,”?Meng You said.

“I’m afraid we’ll be dead before he can get here,” Xue Yang said through gritted teeth.

Water Mirror, one of the Heaven-defying Level experts from the Marquis Piaoxue Camp, was exploring the cave mansion as well.

At the very beginning, when they met Long Xiang and were attacked, Xue Yang had sent Water Mirror a message using the Messaging Slip.

But he was exploring another channel, so it would take some time for him to arrive.

“What should we do?”

“What can we do?”

Xue Yang was anxious, “Do I have to give up on this Interspatial Ring?”

He shook his head immediately.

They had gone through a lot of trouble to get it, they were naturally very unwilling to give it up.

Most importantly, they believed that even if they gave him the Interspatial Ring, Long Xiang would still kill them.

As Long Xiang approached, both Xue Yang and Meng You felt desperate.

Suddenly, ahead of them, in the front channel, a figure appeared.

It was a young man with a longsword on his back, it was Jian Wushuang!

“Oh? A man?”

Even though Jian Wushuang was walking towards the inner layer, he had yet to meet an expert from either camp. Up to this point, he had only met one of the cave mansion guards.

That guard was a Puppet Fighter, whose strength was at the Peak of Stage Three. As expected, Jian Wushuang had easily dealt with it.

When Jian Wushuang saw Xue Yang and Meng You his expression became somewhat strange.

“Xue Yang?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

At this moment, Xue Yang also saw Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman?” Xue Yang was stunned, but he was also happy.

How lucky was he to have come across Jian Wushuang while he was being chased by Long Xiang.

“Swordsman, please, help me,” Xue Yang called out urgently.

Jian Wushuang realized that Xue Yang was running for his life from three people, and they were three people he recognized.

“Heaven Stone Castle Lord, Fire Demon, and an expert of the Heaven-defying Level, Long Xiang?”?Jian Wushuang smiled while thinking to himself,?“That’s why Xue Yang and Meng You decided to flee.”

He moved towards them without hesitation.

Long Xiang, who was chasing Xue Yang, instantly changed his expression the moment he recognized Jian Wushuang.?“He...is Swordsman!”

“Swordsman?”

Both Heaven Stone Castle Lord and Fire Demon were astonished.

The reputation of a person is like the shadow of a tree.

It had been more than two years ago that Jian Wushuang had killed Deng Huo, but it was still something of a hot topic.

After all, he was the only person on the Flaming Battlefield to have killed a Heaven-defying Level expert while at a lower level.

Even now, the results of that battle had a great impact on Jian Wushuang’s reputation.
