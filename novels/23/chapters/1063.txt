Chapter 1064: Since He Wants You Dead, You Should Die!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What’s going on here?”

The indigo-robed man smiled faintly at them, his voice drifting far and wide.

“My Lord, Jian Wushuang and Celestial Manner Lei Yi from the Ancient Demon Clan fought earlier,” Ding Mo replied deferentially.

“It’s Jian Wushuang who attacked me first, leaving me no choice but to defend myself. I never thought of offending you, my Lord,” Lei Yi immediately explained.

“I see.” The indigo-robed man remained expressionless. He then turned to Jian Wushuang and asked, “Is he telling the truth?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. The strong Killing Intent that he carried skyrocketed as he continued speaking in a gloomy voice. “I want him dead!”

“Oh?” The Supervisor raised an eyebrow. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The experts gathered on the drill ground wore complicated expressions after hearing Jian Wushuang’s words.

They never expected him to remain so stubborn and blurt out his thoughts in the Supervisor’s presence.

“Humph! How dare you be so audacious in front of our Supervisor? You want me dead? Let’s see who will die first!”?Lei Yi sneered.

In his opinion, Jian Wushuang’s stubbornness would only bring him closer to his grave.

If Jian Wushuang was a little more courteous, admit his mistakes, and apologize, the Supervisor might consider letting him off. But now, this seemed highly unlikely.

“He’s really digging his own grave!”?Lei Yi’s eyes turned exceptionally cold and sharp.

“Celestial Manner Lei Yi,” the Supervisor said, shifting his gaze to once again look at Lei Yi. “Did you hear what Jian Wushuang said?”

“Yes.” Lei Yi nodded gravely and answered in a cold voice, “My Lord, Jian Wushuang acted recklessly and stirred up trouble at your inauguration ceremony. Even in your presence, he remains egotistical and shows no respect for you. He has committed an unpardonable crime. I hope that you’ll inflict a strict punishment on him!”

He was eager to kill Jian Wushuang now.

Since he dared not to ask the Supervisor for an execution, he pleaded with the Supervisor to inflict a severe punishment on Jian Wushuang instead.

“Inflict a strict punishment?” The Supervisor smiled, looking as if he was ruminating.

Jian Wushuang remained apathetic as if he was confident and secure in his innocence. In fact, the gaze he cast on Lei Yi appeared to carry a hint ofpity.

“Poor man!”?Jian Wushuang sneered deep inside.

“Celestial Manner Lei Yi,” the indigo-robed man called his name again, “Let’s put aside the matter of inflicting a strict punishment on Jian Wushuang for the time being. I just want to know whether you heard his words.”

Lei Yi was stunned. He began to doubt himself.

“Didn’t Jian Wushuang say that he wanted me dead?”

“Of course I heard him loud and clear! The Supervisor ought to have heard it as well, so why is he asking me?”

Confused as he was, he nodded in agreement. “I heard his words.”

“Good! That way you at least know why you’re killed,” the indigo-robed man responded with a little smile.

“What?” Celestial Manner Lei Yi was startled.

The experts were similarly taken aback.

“Since he wants you dead, then… you should die,” the indigo-robed man answered flatly.

The moment he finished his sentence, a flash of sword light appeared.

The sword light was so dazzling that it attracted the attention of all the experts present.

They noticed that the indigo-robed man seemed to have turned into another person.

Earlier, he looked composed and gave off no special aura. Yet, his aura now was so strong and sharp that it seemed it could sabotage everything. He seemed like an invincible magic sword with an insurmountable power.

In this world, no one was his equal.

That brilliant sword light was eye-catching.

However, it moved extremely slowly despite how brilliant and dazzling it was.

Yes, it was slow.

On the surface, this attack appeared slow and weak.

Even an Eternal Realm expert could easily dodge this attack, never mind a Celestial or Dao Master.

However…

The target of the sword light, Celestial Master Lei Yi, was frozen in place. He was desperate to evade the sword light but he realized he moved too slowly to do so.

He was slow, excruciatingly so.

He moved even slower than the sword light.

“What the hell?”

His expression mirrored the amazement and confusion he felt deep inside. He felt an unprecedented panic and terror overpowering his emotions.

He stood there, wide-eyed as he watched the slow sword light come near. He saw it hit him before he could brandish his spear to block it.

“Clang!”

A muffled sound of collision resounded in the air, accompanying the raining of blood.

Lei Yi remaining standing in place but his life was slipping away at an amazing speed and his cultivation disappeared instantly. Soon, he leaned backward and fell to the ground.

Before he died, he was still in the dark as to why the new Supervisor killed him instead of penalizing Jian Wushuang who had offended him.

Moreover, he had been unable to see clearly the execution of the Supervisor’s swordsmanship.

It was to the point that he didn’t even know why or how the swordsmanship even killed him.

The sword strike shattered his organs and flesh as well as his Life Core. It was impossible for him to live after such an attack.

Silence fell over the drill ground.

The experts stared at the dead Lei Yi, looking appalled.

The sword light astounded them.

“T-That’s impressive!”

It was unknown who made the startled exclamation. Before long, commotion broke out on the drill ground.

“That blow!”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory looked at the indigo-robed man in shock.

“That strike was formidable indeed!”

“Even I don’t have enough confidence in warding off that blow.”

“Celestial Manner Lei Yi had the honor to die at the Supervisor’s hands,” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory muttered, shaking his head.

That blow also left a deep impression on Jian Wushuang. His eyes were filled with shock and excitement.

“Illusion!”

“Yes, it’s an illusion.”

Jian Wushuang wrung his hands.

“The sword appeared pitifully slow but it was actually unimaginably swift. It was even faster than when I unleashed a sword strike using the Aurora Sword Principle at full strength.”

“It was so fast that it formed an illusion and that Celestial Master Lei Yi couldn’t react in time, much less block or evade it. Thus, he was immediately killed.”

“How terrifying!”

Jian Wushuang was also left in awe and shock after the episode.
