Chapter 822: The Retaliation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Xia Yan paused for a while before continuing in an undertone, “Elder He discussed some important issues with his Excellency for those days. We shouldn’t bother him. Moreover, Jian Wushuang is in the Divine Realm, thus, with you two helping me, his death is assured!”

The two guards nodded in approval. Obviously, they were confident in their power.

After all, they were in the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm.

In no time, Xia Yan departed with the two guards.

They followed Jian Wushuang in secret.

In the void tens of thousands of kilometers away from Cercis Island, the black-robed Jian Wushuang walked forward alone, long sword strapped across his back.

After he crossed the vast land below him, he arrived in the Tang of the East.

Right then…

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three figures approached him from behind at an amazing speed. Two of them moved especially fast that the next moment Jian Wushuang saw them, they stood in front of him.

“Finally, you’ve come.”

Jian Wushuang crossed his arms not surprised at the sudden arrival of the two men one bit.

“Swordsman.”

An icy voice of malice echoed behind Jian Wushuang. The slower of the three figures arrived as well.

Jian Wushuang turned back only to see Xia Yan stand nearby with a grim smile on his face.

Seeing him, Jian Wushuang smirked.

He expected Xia Yan, who had always been a vengeful man, would not concede seeking revenge.

He also knew that it was because he had been on Cercis Island during the last half a month that Xia Yan took no action. Now, since he left the island, Xia Yan no longer need wait.

“For what reason do you stand in my way, Sir?” Jian Wushuang asked while looking at Xia Yan with a twitching, faint smile.

“What do think it might be?” Xia Yan’s voice chilled the air. “Half a month ago, you humiliated me in front of so many people, and do you really believe I’ll let you go after doing such a heinous act?”

“Heh! Who would have thought the second master of the Xia Clan would be such a narrow-minded man?” Jian Wushuang said, then continued smiling. He looked towards the two men in silver and asked, “Are these two gentlemen your guards?”

“Exactly. My father has them follow me. And guess what? They are both in the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm!” Xia Yan answered. He not only confirmed the two men’s identities but also revealed their power.

“The Six Steps of the Eternal Realm?” Jian Wushuang eyes narrowed slightly.

With each step in the Eternal Realm more powerful than the prior one, the Six Steps made a huge difference when compared to the Five Steps.

Now, Jian Wushuang faced two experts at such an absurd level.

“Luckily, I’ve restrained my power when I fought Xia Yan on the Blood Battle Arena, which made him think I was in the Five Steps; otherwise, he would have brought more than two guards here to kill me.”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

Among all the experts in the Xia Clan, he feared Elder He the most.

If he were to battle this elder at that moment, he would definitely lose.

Regarding Xia Yan not asking the elder, but instead the two guards for help, Jian Wushuang believed he could handle them on his own.

Jian Wushuang did not inform them with his true intentions, but said, “Brought two experts in the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm here to kill me? Xia Yan, you really think too highly of me.” Jian Wushuang sneered and a glint of malice flashed in his eyes. “It seems as though I must die here today.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Of course.”

Xia Yan said in a deep voice, “Nowadays, everyone in the Eternal World speaks of you as the number one Divine Realm expert, but, a dead man does not deserve that honor. I will claim this title after I kill you.”

“Finally, I knew what means you kept your title as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World.” Jian Wushuang sneered in disdain.

Seeing that, Xia Yan echoed coldly, “What can you do even knowing this? Don’t tell me you intend on surviving today.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows at those words. With no more talk exchanged, he pulled out the Message Token he received from Lin Wan.

They were not far from Cercis Island, so, if he relayed a message to Lin Wan asking for assistance, there would be someone on their way soon.

However, when Jian Wushuang tried to do so, he found his message could not exit the void where it resided.

“What goes on?” He asked in confusion.

“Ha, ha…”

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s reaction, Xia Yan bellowed. “Swordsman, you honestly believe I came here to kill you without added precautions?

“I knew that, the bitch Lin Wan cared for you and gave you her Message Token before leaving, therefore, just in case, I set up a Restriction covering this area while I conversed with you. This Restriction is a Dao Master’s work and severs the connections between its inside and outside.

“That’s to say, at this moment in this void, your Message Token doesn’t work. No one will come to save you.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brow. He put the token back in his Interspatial Ring and smiled again and said, “Xia Yan, it seems I’ve underestimated you. You are more cunning than I’ve believed.”

“Kill him!”

Xia Yan’s frosty voice spurred his guards to arms. He ran out of patience and desired no more idle chat.

Taking his order, the guards’ eyes flickered as they charged Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stood still, looking at the guards coldly.

“If what Xia Yan said is true, he can’t send out a message either.

“In order to help Lin Wan, I stepped onto the Blood Battle Arena to fight him, but, I didn’t mean to humiliate him at that time; I thought it a temptation to him and the Xia Clan.

“But now, since he courts death, I’m not the one at fault.”

Jian Wushuang roared in an inaudible manner. An overwhelming killing intent lurched up high behind him like a tidal wave of hatred.

At the same time, with a buzz of his Bloodline Power, his body grew at a tremendous speed, and the next second he transformed into a 15-meter Gold-armored Ancient God.

In one of his hand, he gripped an extended red sword about 12 meters in length.

The Blood Mountain Sword!

Since he faced two experts in Six Steps of the Eternal Realm, he decided to go all out.
