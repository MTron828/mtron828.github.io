Chapter 1825: Target, Emperor God!

Massacre!

Jian Wushuang had gone on a crazy massacre.

For the sixteen Almighties on the name list, from the closest to the furthest and from the earliest Sir God Xing Xiang to Sir God Ling Gu, Jian Wushuang had gone to find all of them personally. In less than a hundred years’ time, Jian Wushuang had already found and killed five of those Almighties!

In no time, the Sanctuary Alliance was in an uproar.

“It’s too frightening. This Jian Wushuang is really a lunatic!”

“In less than a hundred years’ time, he has killed a total of seven Sir Gods. If he were to continue his massacre at such a speed, all the Sir Gods in the Eternal Chaotic World would be killed by him in a split second.”

“Hmph, among those seven Sir Gods, five of them had huge grudges against the Lineage of Star and they were his targets. As for the other two people, they were killed by him as they obstructed him during his massacre. It is also very normal for him to kill his own enemies since he is so powerful. However, I am only curious as to what the Lineage of Star is trying to do. According to what I know, it’s not just Jian Wushuang alone. The other two Almighties of the Lineage of Star have also taken action and their targets are Real Gods who have huge grudges against the Lineage of Star.”

“The Lineage of Star has made enemies out of many people and it is not considered a big matter for them to get rid of some of them. However, their movements this time around are too big. In particular, Jian Wushuang has made it clear that he wanted to kill all the experts in the Eternal Chaotic World who have a huge grudge against the Lineage of Star.”

The experts in all the powerhouses were all having a discussion and they were trying to figure out the intentions of the Lineage of Star.

Their guesses were that the Lineage of Star had done such things to either instill fear in everyone or to raise the reputation of Jian Wushuang. However, no one would direct their thinking toward the Star Palace Master.

At the same time that the Sanctuary Alliance was in an uproar, an ancient, huge silver spaceship descended upon a Holy Kingdom.

“That Emperor God Jin Ming stays in this Holy Kingdom?”

As Jian Wushuang stood on the spaceship and looked at the Holy Kingdom in front of him, he laughed indifferently.

Out of the sixteen Almighties in the name list, fourteen of them were Sir Gods while the remaining two were Emperor Gods.

For Jian Wushuang’s massacre for the Lineage of Star, all the targets that he had looked for so far were not determined by their abilities. Instead, all of them were determined by the distance between him and them. Previously, he had already killed five Sir Gods in the name list. At that time, it was the sixth person and this person was an Emperor God. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Emperor God Jin Ming is ranked eighty-third in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list and he can be said to be at the bottom of the Emperor Gods. However, even though he is at the bottom, he is still a genuine Emperor God expert in the end,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Master, do you need me to do it?” Jian Yi, who was at the side, said with respect.

“No need,” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “You are a great trump card of mine and you must not expose yourself unless it is really necessary. Moreover, it’s just Emperor God Jin Ming and I am not worried at all.”

With absolute confidence, Jian Wushuang activated the spaceship and entered the Holy Kingdom right away.

In no time, Jian Wushuang came to a vast land that was floating in the air.

“Emperor God Jin Ming!”

The powerful god power that his ice-cold voice contained burst forth instantly.

The vast land was the place where the capital of a Holy Kingdom was and there were countless experts which was inclusive of Real Gods in it. However, at that time, under the pressure of Jian Wushuang’s god power, these experts started to shiver in succession as they were terrified and filled with grief.

“Hmph!”

All of a sudden, a cold snort which contained a tremendous amount of god power as well could be heard and it was comparable to Jian Wushuang’s god power.

After that, a golden-robed stalwart man rose high into the air slowly and he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in a jiffy.

“As expected. Jian Wushuang, you have really come,” Emperor God Jin Ming’s eyes were glowing brilliantly with golden light and he was staring at Jian Wushuang.

“Why? Emperor God Jin Ming seems to know that I will be coming?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“For your journey of massacre from the Lineage of Star to here, you have killed a total of seven Sir Gods. Among the seven Sir Gods, five of them had huge grudges with your Lineage of Star. As for the remaining two of them, they were killed by you since they obstructed you. Hence, it is obvious that your target is to kill some enemies of the Lineage of Star. Moreover, the grudge between me and your Lineage of Star will not end without death. Thus, how is it possible for you to let me off?” Emperor God Jin Ming’s voice was ice-cold.

“It’s good that you know,” Jian Wushuang had an ice-cold expression. “Emperor God Jin Ming, do you want to kill yourself, or do you want me to kill you personally?”

“Kill myself? You are not worthy for me to do that,” Emperor God Jin Ming sneered. “Jian Wushuang, six thousand years ago, you were ranked sixty-first on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Now, after another six thousand years, your abilities have risen greatly again and you probably have the fighting capabilities of the top fifty in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Therefore, you are definitely very close to the peak of an Emperor God. For a one-to-one battle, I would naturally not be your opponent. However, since I know that you will come to my doorstep, how could I not make any preparations at all?”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank.

As soon as Emperor God Jin Ming’s voice left his mouth, swoosh! A flittering light appeared from the void behind and it appeared beside Emperor God Jin Ming instantly. It then stood side by side with Emperor God Jin Ming and it was not weaker than Emperor God Jin Ming in the slightest bit. Moreover, it also emitted an aura that was slightly stronger than Emperor God Jin Ming.

Upon seeing the person who had come, Jian Wushuang frowned, “You are Emperor God Fan Yuan who is ranked sixty-first on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list?”

Emperor God Fan Yuan was an extremely powerful expert who travelled alone.

More than six thousand years ago, he had been ranked sixty-first on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. However, after Jian Wushuang had become famous from his battle, he had been pushed downward to the sixty-second rank.

“Sword Emperor, this is our first time meeting one another and it’s nice to meet you,” Emperor God Fan Yuan laughed.

“Why? Could it be you also want to take advantage of this battle for your own personal gain?” Jian Wushuang’s expression did not change in the slightest.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, you might not know that Fan Yuan and I have always been extremely good friends. This time around, since I know that you will come to my doorstep, I naturally got him to lend me a hand. Although your abilities are strong, with Fan Yuan and I, two Emperor Gods, teaming up, you probably wouldn’t be able to overpower us? Moreover, you will not be able to do anything to Fan Yuan alone,” Emperor God Jin Ming laughed coldly.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“Sword Emperor, for your battle with Emperor God Tian Xiao more than six thousand years ago, your abilities are indeed not too bad and it is not surprising for the Sanctuary Alliance to place you in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Moreover, it is too much for them to give you the sixty-first ranking, which is before me. You should know that I, Fan Yuan, have not fought in front of many people for many years. Thus, my real abilities will not be as simple as what the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list has described,” Emperor God Fan Yuan shouted with a low voice.

Everyone had an air of arrogance.

Similarly, Emperor God Fan Yuan had one as well. Moreover, after reaching a level like his, one would pay more attention to their prestige.

Jian Wushuang was merely a Real God who had trained for a short number of years. However, his ranking in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list was actually higher than his?

How could he contend with that?
