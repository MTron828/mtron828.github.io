Chapter 639: Erupt, World Dao

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

All the spectators who had witnessed Ouyang Xuan display the third movement of the 13 Sword Moves of Liu Yun thought that Jian Wushuang was doomed to lose the fight. However, things went against their expectations.

Jian Wushuang was not injured under that attack. He brandished his longsword, which startled all the spectators.

“That is...”

“World Dao, it’s the World Dao. And he has a high understanding of it!”

They saw the strike, which seemed to contain a huge world, charging toward Ouyang Xuan.

This was a Superior Rank One Secret Skill, named Stars.

It was much mightier than the Cataclysm Skill, as Jian Wushuang had a better comprehension of the World Dao than the Slaughter Dao.

“Humph!” Ouyang Xuan snorted, without a hint of fear in his eyes.

He wielded his huge, heavy sword and attacked again.

He displayed the same move.

Bang!

The two strikes violently crashed together, causing a terrifying boom!

“World Prison!” Jian Wushuang growled as he waved his hands.

A mighty World Energy gushed out from his palms, forming a colossal World Prison around his opponent.

This World Prison was equivalent to the one that Emperor Xiao had used to train him, but it was weaker.

After the World Prison covered Ouyang Xuan, Jian Wushuang immediately launched continuous attacks.

“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

The sword shadows had completely shown the power of the World Dao and Slaughter Dao that he had comprehended.

Numerous giant hands appeared in the World Prison and began hitting Ouyang Xuan crazily.

“What?”

Ouyang Xuan turned pale. He was locked in the World Prison while being attacked by the World Dao and Slaughter Dao. The only thing he could do was to try his best to resist.

The spectators in the Skyward Pavillion were rocked.

“He must have comprehended the first Occult of the World Dao and has almost mastered the second Occult, otherwise he would not have been able to control such a huge World Prison.”

“He is amazing. He didn’t reveal that he had mastered the World Dao during the previous genius battles. We all thought he had a high comprehension of the Slaughter Dao, but didn’t expect that his perception of the World Dao was so wonderful!”

“He’s already qualified to rank in the top 20 just by using his Slaughter Dao in this feast. Now seeing that his comprehension of the World Dao is superior to that of his Slaughter Dao, this strength...”

“Top 10!”

“He definitely has top 10 battle strength. Or even top 5!”

“He has an excellent understanding of the Slaughter Dao and World Dao, and he is adept at the Sword Principle. Having such strength, he’s certainly able to enter the top 5.”

“Most importantly, this boy actually comes from the Ancient World!”

Upon hearing this, many experts quieted down.

The Firmament Territory Feast was held every 3,000 years. In its history, those who ranked in the top 20 were almost always the local geniuses from the Eternal World.

As for the geniuses from the Ancient World, it was rare for them to enter the top 20, let alone rank in the top 10.

Among previous feasts, only one genius from the Ancient World had reached the top 10.

However, they now thought that Jian Wushuang was qualified to be ranked fifth or higher.

The geniuses in this year’s feast were much more powerful than before, so those who were capable of entering the top 5 would have been ranked in the top three, or even first, in the previous feasts!

“World Dao?”

Seeing what was happening, Xuan Yi slightly furrowed his eyebrows.?“This boy is still holding back some tactics.”

The experts from the other sects believed that Jian Wushuang was using his full strength, which was contrary to Xuan Yi’s thoughts.

“His Sword Principle attracts the attention of my Sword Heart. It’s extraordinary, but he hasn’t fully displayed it,”?Xuan Yi thought.

He had expected Jian Wushuang to display all his skills.

He originally thought it was time for Jian Wushuang to perform the Sword Principle during the fight with Ouyang Xuan. But actually, Jian Wushuang only used the World Dao.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang was fiercely fighting with Ouyang Xuan in the World Prison.

“It’s impossible!

“How is this possible?”

Ouyang Xuan was shocked and exhausted. He had tried his best to resist, but he remained at a disadvantage and had no chance to fight back.

“He has a high comprehension of the World Dao? How is this possible?”?Ouyang Xuan wondered.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had comprehended the first Occult of the World Dao, or that he had made great progress in the Slaughter Dao as well as his World Dao during his one-month cultivation on Enlightenment Mountain. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

His perception of the World Dao had reached a new level. Now he had an in-depth study of the second Occult, so his strength improved greatly.

How could Ouyang Xuan withstand his attack if he exerted his full strength of the World Dao and Slaughter Dao?

After a while, Ouyang Xuan was finally beaten down by Jian Wushuang.

When Jian Wushuang slowly walked off of the battlefield, he found all the spectators’ eyes fixed on him.

They looked grim and a bit frightened.

Now, all of them were in awe of Jian Wushuang because of his mighty strength.
