Chapter 1988? Losers Are Always In The Wrong

“How are our guest elders in Lineage of Star doing?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“Guest elders?”

Hall Master Yuan and the other hall masters exchanged a look. Then, Hall Master Yuan answered, “The guest elders in Lineage of Star aren’t restrained. When they found out about the news regarding the ancient battlefield, many guest elders couldn’t hold back. Even though he gave out the command personally to prohibit them from stepping foot in the ancient battlefield, they agreed on the surface. However, many guest elders went over in secret. Only Emperor God Jiu Yin, Emperor God Xuan Wu and two Sir Gods followed your command.”

“Hehe, this is within my expectations,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

When he gave a command to the guest elders, it was because he knew he might need them.

But in actual fact, the danger in Green Fire World didn’t need Lineage of Star to get involved at all.

“Those guest elders who followed my command can enter the ancient battlefield and Green Fire World as they wish. As for those who didn’t obey my command, ignore them. The danger in Lineage of Star has been removed long ago. Those guest elders that didn’t act according to my instructions will only become our burden if they continue to stay in Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I understand. I thought the same too,” Hall Master Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Palace Master, I have an idea. I wonder if I should say this…”

“Tell me,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“Green Fire World is Palace Master’s hometown, and they follow your lead. Similarly, Lineage of Star views Palace Master as our leader as well. Palace Master, do you think you could get more resources from Green Fire World on behalf of Lineage of Star. Such as… moving the old lair of Lineage of Star, Universe Galaxy, to Green Fire World?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yue looked at Jian Wushuang with anticipation.

Three thousand years had passed and the unique characteristics of Green Fire World were revealed.

Everyone knew that Green fire World was a true cultivation sanctuary, the cradle of geniuses.

Countless experts were dying to cultivate there. However, the territory was only that big and there was a limit to the number of people who could enter to cultivate.

Because of Jian Wushuang, many core disciples, including experts from Lineage of Star could enter Green Fire World directly. However, the freedom to enter and exit wouldn’t be as great as moving the old lair of Lineage of Star over directly.

Hearing what Hall Master Yuan said, Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Actually, after Jian Wushuang had found out how powerful Universe Galaxy was, he had the same idea. However, it was unrealistic back then. Hence, he didn’t consider it again.

But then… Needless for him to say, the three hall masters suggested it instead. Jian Wushuang naturally could make it happen.

“I will immediately make some arrangement for Green Fire World to empty parts of the territory as the old lair of Lineage of Star. However, Universe Galaxy is so huge, it wouldn’t be easy if we wanted to move it here, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Palace Master, you don’t know that although Universe Galaxy looks huge, it is just a unique treasure after all. Palace Master, you could refine Universe Galaxy and bring it to Green Fire World. Then, expand it gradually,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

He was Universe Galaxy’s weapon spirit. He naturally knew Universe Galaxy the best.

“That’s great. Hall Master Yuan, you go ahead and make preparations then. When everything is ready, I will return to Star Land to move Universe Galaxy over,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded heavily.

Then, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun left too.

As for Hall Master Yuan… His original body had stayed in Universe Galaxy as he couldn’t leave. The one that appeared in Green Fire World was merely an incarnation that had formed temporarily.

When the discussion ended, Hall Master Yuan’s incarnation dispersed.

…

In the void outside Green Fire World, a cold-looking middle-aged man, Emperor God Shi Yu, stood and waited in silence.

Then, there was an elder in Taoist robe that walked out from Green Fire World.

The elder in the Taoist robe was Jian Yi.

“Shi Yu under Colored Glaze Great Emperor greets Mister Jian Yi,” Emperor God Shi Yu bowed politely.

Although Jian Yi was only Jian Wushuang’s sword servant, his power was on display. He was a true Great Emperor. Hence, Emperor God Shi Yu, of course, had to treat him with respect.

“This is what my master told me to deliver,” Emperor God Shi Yu said as he offered an ancient black tower.

The black tower looked ordinary but it was actually a powerful suppressing treasure.

There was a person in the black tower. The person was naturally Sir God Xue Dao!

Sir God Xue Dao spread the news in Eternal Chaotic World back then. He was the culprit who had pushed Green Fire World to breaking point.

When they had been discussing terms and conditions back then, Jian Wushuang had said that he wanted Sanctuary Alliance to find the person who spread the news and send him over. Sanctuary Alliance naturally did it.

Sir God Xue was very cunning and he was well hidden. In front of Sanctuary Alliance, he had nowhere to hide. He was found very quickly and suppressed.

Then, Emperor Shi Yu sent him over personally after they had found out that Jian Wushuang had exited seclusion.

“You can leave him here. Then, you can leave,” Jian Yi glanced at Emperor God Shi Yu.

Emperor God Shi Yu nodded and let Sir God Xue Dao out. After that, he bowed to Jian Yi and in the direction of Green Fire World. Then, he left.

In the vast void in Green Fire World.

Sir God Xue Dao with crimson hair and a crimson robe was tied up. Even his divine power was restrained. He couldn’t even use any strength.

He looked hopeless then.

Vroom!!!

There was a figure that slowly appeared before Sir God Xue Dao.

“You are Emperor God Xie Xin’s junior, Sir God Xue Dao?” Jian Wushuang looked cold as he looked down at Sir God Xue Dao.

Of course, Jian Wushuang didn’t hate Sir God Xue Dao as much as before.

Although Sir God Xue Dao framed him and schemed against Green Fire World, he was actually taking revenge for his senior after all.

“Jian Wushuang!!!” Sir God Xue Dao stared at Jian Wushuang. There was hatred in his eyes but there was even more helplessness and unwillingness.

He was only a Sir God. It was absolutely impossible for him to kill Jian Wushuang. He could only rely on the scheme. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He had put in his greatest effort to scheme against Jian Wushuang. He had even led various forces in Eternal Chaotic World to Green Fire World. However, he had never expected that Jian Wushuang would survive even when he fought against the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

“You and I share no resentment, you were only taking revenge for your senior!”

“You have your reasons to scheme against Green Fire World and I, but I have my reasons to kill your senior, Emperor God Xie Xin as well. Hence… There is no right or wrong between us, but losers are always in the wrong.”
