Chapter 3393: Do Not Provoke

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Flame Saint Realm, at the peak of a vast sea of fire, there was a Flame Saint Palace. This Flame Saint Palace was where Flame Saint Master lived.

“You are saying that there are still people from the Amethyst Demon Sect that I personally destroyed, and they have already reached the pinnacle of the six stages of the Void?” Flame Saint Master’s entire body was covered in flames, controlling the endless sea of fire around him, there seemed to be flames

burning in his eyes as well.

Right below Flame Saint Master, a purple-robed elder was kneeling respectfully. When he heard Flame Saint Master’s words...he immediately replied respectfully, “Saint Master, this news was personally transmitted by the Samsara Sect’s Sect Master. It shouldn’t be fake. And the Demon Master Chenhuo

that he mentioned was a genius elder of the Amethyst Demon Sect back then. His talent was extremely high, and our Flame Saint Master did not kill him when we destroyed the Amethyst Demon Sect.”

“In addition, not long ago, there was news from the Xiaoyao Mansion that they met an expert left behind by the Amethyst Demon Sect in the Amethyst Fog Sea. Even Marquis Xiaoyao was easily defeated by him. If I’m not mistaken, it should be this Demon Master Chenhuo.”

“Who would have thought that after such a long time, there would still be survivors from the Amethyst Demon Sect?” Flame Saint Master’s expression was cold, and his eyes were filled with shocking killing intent.

“Saint Master, this Demon Master Chenhuo himself is a super genius with incredible talent. According to the news from Xiaoyao Mansion, he has been staying in a heaven and earth secret realm within the Amethyst Fog Sea all these years. He hasn’t had any contact with the outside world, hasn’t

experienced anything, and hasn’t obtained any opportunities. He has purely relied on himself to blindly cultivate, yet he has still raised his strength to the peak of the sixth level of the void. With such ability, our Flame Saint Realm has no choice but to guard against him.” The violet-robed old man said.

“He could reach the peak of the sixth level of the Void realm just by blindly cultivating. His talent is indeed extraordinary. Now that he has come out of the heaven and earth secret realm, with his talent, he might have a chance to break through to the ruler level. Once he reaches that level, he would pose a

great threat to the Flame Saint Realm.” Flame Saint Realm nodded slightly.

“However, with his current strength alone, I’m afraid that no one within my Flame Saint Realm has the ability to kill him unless I personally take action.”

“That’s right. That’s why I’ve come to ask Saint Master to personally take action.” The purple-robed elder said respectfully, “In addition, after this Demon Master Chenhuo left the Amethyst Fog Sea, he established a relationship with the Temporal Temple. Now, he’s been following Heavenly Sword Marquis

like a guard.”

“What did you say?” Flame Saint Master was finally moved. “This Demon Master Chenhuo is following Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“Yes.” The purple-robed elder nodded.

Flame Saint Realm fell silent.

This silence lasted for a long while before he spoke, “Have people keep an eye on Heavenly Sword Marquis and Demon Master Chenhuo. Remember, just keep an eye on them. There is no need for any other actions. Our Flame Saint Realm will not provoke them for now.”

“Not provoke them?” The purple-robed elder was stunned. He asked subconsciously, “Is it because of Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“Yes.” Flame Saint Realm did not hide it. “During the battle on the Saha Island, Heavenly Sword Marquis displayed an extremely powerful technique. Although his strength does not belong to him and he will not have such strength in the future, after that battle, the Temporal Temple Master will definitely

give him other life-saving methods. With the strength of the three Saint Realms, we have no chance to kill him.”

“Since I can’t kill him, I won’t provoke him for now. When I have absolute confidence in the future, it won’t be too late to attack him!”

“As for the Demon Master Chenhuo... Even though he is extremely talented, he has wasted so many years in the process. I’m afraid that he has wasted a lot of his talent. Even if he is extremely lucky in the future and can break through to the ruler-level, it won’t be a big deal.”

“A mere ruler-level has no influence on the situation of the Divine Beginning Realm. Although he can pose a threat to the Flame Saint Realm, it’s impossible for him to threaten the position of the Flame Saint Realm!”

“To put it bluntly, what the Flame Saint Realm should really pay attention to is the Heavenly Sword Marquis. He is the enemy that can seriously threaten the position of the Flame Saint Realm and the three great Saint Realms. As for the Demon Master Chenhuo, he is far from the Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“Understood, your subordinate will take his leave!” The purple-robed old man immediately bowed and left.

After the purple-robed old man left, the Flame Saint Master was the only one left in the huge Flame Divine Hall.

At this moment, a large amount of raging flames surged around the Flame Saint Master’s body, and his gaze was extremely scorching.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis...the three great Saint Realms can’t do anything to you now, but just you wait. Before long, your doomsday will come, just like your Master Xuan Yi from countless years ago!”

“If he dies, you will die too! As for the Temporal Temple and the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, anyone who dares to stand on your side will die!”

“Hahaha!”

Wild laughter echoed throughout the entire Flame Temple. The laughter stirred up the surrounding sea of fire, making it even more vigorous.

In the Samsara Heaven Realm of the Samsara Sect! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jian Wushuang had already entered the Samsara Heaven Realm. When he actually appeared in the Samsara Heaven Realm, Jian Wushuang could sense how vast and rich the power of the Samsara principles was!

“The power of the Samsara principles on such a scale is probably hundreds of times richer than in the outside world. If I meditate on the Samsara principles here, my speed will be dozens of times faster than in the outside world,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

While sensing the strong power of the law of reincarnation around him, Jian Wushuang also took in the Samsara Heaven Realm in front of him.

From the outside, the Samsara Heaven Realm looked like a vast territory. However, after entering, Jian Wushuang saw nothing but darkness and desolation.

There was no life in the void in his eyes. It was filled with a dead aura that almost filled the entire sky.

“The aura of death is so dense?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. “The aura of death is ethereal, but why does it give me an unfathomable feeling, as if it’s an extremely special power that even I haven’t touched yet?”

“Yes, it’s power.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled, and then a smile appeared on his lips, “It’s said that the Samsara Heaven Realm is an excellent place to meditate on the Samsara principles, but what I’m seeing right now clearly doesn’t meet this requirement. However, the aura of death I’m sensing is extraordinary. I’d like

to see where the source of this aura of death is.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately sent his consciousness toward the surrounding aura of death.
