“Kid, stop the nonsense. I won’t make a move unless you show some sincerity,” sneered the Turtle Spirit Island Lord, attempting to provoke him. But it seemed the young one was too naive.

Having lived countless epochs, he wouldn’t be easily manipulated by a mere youngster.

Jian Wushuang was unwilling, saying, “I can’t promise you with this physical body alone. As long as you help me get through this difficulty, we can form an alliance!”

“Don’t bother with empty words,” Gui Ling impatiently shook his head. But Jian Wushuang truly couldn’t come up with the sincerity they sought.

He couldn’t just kill Gong Miaoyi now!

Even if he did, the Bloodfall Crystal would fall into the hands of the other party, making things even more advantageous for them.

Jian Wushuang was growing anxious.

Qing Mang and the others couldn’t hold on for too long; they were already injured.

Being able to quickly break through Qing Mang and the others surprised even Gui Ling’s group.

However, if they intervened, they wouldn’t gain anything and might even offend the Inheritors.

Even if they didn’t offend now, when it came to competing for treasures later, clashes were inevitable.

Just as Jian Wushuang had suggested, forming an alliance would be better.

Yet, he was unwilling.

The Turtle Spirit Island Lord was also conflicted, taking the initiative to propose, “Kid, as long as you can guarantee that half of that body belongs to us, I’ll make a move with my people!”

“Island Lord, I can only guarantee that one-tenth is yours; I have no control over the rest,” Jian Wushuang coldly smiled, and the other party fell for it.

If his words could be trusted, he wouldn’t have provoked so many enemies.

Gui Ling frowned at first, but upon hearing that only one-tenth belonged to him, meaning he alone could get a share, he became intrigued.

Turning to look at the people beside him, he couldn’t help but furrow his brows.

What to do with this group of people?

F*ck it!

Qing Mang and the others were on the verge of falling; if he didn’t make a move now, even that one-tenth would be gone.

If the Inheritors got hold of it, they wouldn’t have any chance at all.

“Everyone, it’s time to make a move. These individuals have fallen, and the next to fall might be us. How about forming an alliance with them? We can obtain the Universe Master’s physical body, and everyone can gain insights. This is what I’ve fought for you. Give it some thought!” said Gui Ling with a sudden sense of righteousness.

Tianchan was somewhat incredulous; this old turtle Island Lord unexpectedly had such awareness.

Early on, he also felt the need to take action, understanding the principle that when one dies, others mourn.

The strengths of Qing Mang and the others were not weak. If these people were to fall, disputes would inevitably arise later, and they would be the ones to die. “Take action, delay them!” Seeing no one objecting, Gui Ling took the lead.

In his heart, he sneered at these people’s foolishness.

This was also why Jian Wushuang didn’t seek out others. As long as a tiny benefit was offered, it could prompt them all to take action.

As for the one percent of the physical body, it didn’t matter.

After Bai Junwang merged, he could cut off a piece and give it to the other party. By then, Bai Junwang’s strength would soar, and he could do without it.

But these people still had their uses, so giving it to them wouldn’t hurt.

“You rotten shrimps and fish, how dare you obstruct me!” Chishui transformed his body into seven colors and punched open the true form of Tianchan.

The majestic toad swelled up, then let out a thunderous roar.

Ribbit!

Spurt!

The magnificent avatar of Zhen Wuyang punched out, dimming the heavens and earth.

Just a moment ago, with the help of Shang and Situ Nan, it was relatively easy to defeat Qing Mang and others.

However, after the involvement of Gui Ling, it became much more challenging.

Especially now, with countless skeletons surrounding them, every attack required careful calculation to avoid hitting those bones.

If it weren’t for the intimidating presence of the Universe Master’s physical body, the skeletal army would have already overwhelmed them.

Zhen Wuyang watched as these people cursed in anger, “You fools, what has

the other side offered you?”

“Tsk tsk, even if there were no benefits, I wouldn’t let you Inheritors take everything. This is a legacy belonging to the powerful beings of our realm. Why should it all be given to you?” The words stung the hearts of the Elder Palace people.

For a moment, everything came to a halt.

Tongtian Buddha grew impatient and turned to Situ Nan, saying, “Situ, what are you doing?”

Hum!

The Universe Master’s physical body burst forth with a powerful Origin Source aura, the very same Origin Source that Jian Wushuang had refined. This indicated the success of Bai Junwang.

“Haha!”

Maniacal laughter echoed, forcing everyone back.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Bai Junwang’s eyes were icy, and he slowly stood up.

“You guys…”

However, Jian Wushuang felt an ominous sensation and slowly began to retreat.

The Origin Source was crafted by him, and he understood Bai Junwang better than anyone else. The laughter just now didn’t sound like Bai Junwang.

“Damn it!” Bai Junwang spoke again, uttering the last few words before launching into an indiscriminate assault, directly killing Qing Mang and Lan

Zhi Shan, severely injured, stayed at the back to assist, narrowly escaping death.

Shang also sensed a hint of danger and shouted, “Quick, retreat!”

Immediately, his figure appeared in front of Zhen Wuyang and the others.

“Destruction! ”

A black lotus blossomed, emanating a terrifying aura that swept across the entire battlefield.

Shang turned to look at the others, urging, “Hurry, leave this place. I’ll hold them back with my avatar.”

Then, with concern, he added, “Situ Nan, don’t forget your duty, protect them and lead them away.”

“Don’t worry!” Situ Nan directly grabbed Zhen Wuyang and others, bypassing Bai Junwang.

Gui Ling was momentarily stunned, wanting to ask Jian Wushuang what was happening—why kill their own people?

However, when he turned around, there was no trace of Jian Wushuang; he had already fled.

While fleeing, he didn’t forget to pull along several cloaked Emperors and Elder Zhi Shan.

Jian Wushuang possessed the Power of All Things, capable of restoring their combat strength. Alone, he had no chance of surviving in this place.

Facing the black lotus, Bai Junwang was somewhat surprised and exclaimed, “Cosmic secret technique, whether inherited or self-created, it’s quite interesting!”

Crash!

The black lotus bloomed, and Shang stood atop it, his aura rising to the supreme-peak level.

“I seek guidance!” Shang remained calm, aware that he was not a match. Still, he was just an avatar, and his demise wouldn’t be a big deal.

This encounter was not in vain. Unexpectedly, he encountered a Universe Master.

At this moment, Bai Junwang was no longer in control.

Jian Wushuang realized he was tricked.

Both he and Bai Junwang were manipulated by Shen Ling.

Refining the Origin Source, searching for the physical body—everything was a diversion, all for the resurrection of the Universe Master before them.

Jian Wushuang fell into a trap and was now desperately fleeing.

Bai Junwang, on the other hand, met his end, a thorough demise this time.

“Remember the name ‘Fuego.’ You have the privilege of knowing who killed you!” Fuego activated a strand of Origin Source, reveling in the experience.

This Origin Source, like Frolasa told him, was powerful but not as formidable as before.

Nevertheless, it was sufficient; he could revive himself, and that was enough..
