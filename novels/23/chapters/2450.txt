Chapter 2451: The Siege

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The Great Compassion Sect’s Long Zishan, Yu Aoqing, and four First-Class Divine Demon disciples who formed the Four Elephant Formation were defeated while working together?”

“Not only that, it was a devastating defeat. Long Zishan is badly injured, the four First-Class Divine Demon disciples didn’t even get the chance to break their Safety Tokens before they got cut down.”

“The duration was too fast. Long Zishan and his group definitely had the upper hand a while ago, but the tables completely turned in only an instant. This Jian Wushuang is really scary!”

In the void surrounding the battlefield, there was already an emotional stir.

The various sects’ genius disciples were all stunned beyond words.

“Huo Yang, let’s do it!” Huan Chen gave a soft cry.

“Now?” Huo Yang frowned. Their initial plan was to let Long Zishan and his group push Jian Wushuang to a corner and take advantage of the situation after that. However...

“Jian Wushuang’s ability is beyond our imagination. We can’t only rely on the Great Compassion Sect disciples. We shouldn’t wait anymore and must immediately take action. Only by working with Long Zishan and this lot could we have some hope to kill Jian Wushuang. Don’t think too much, let’s do it!” Huan Chen’s voice was frosty.

“Alright.” Huo Yang stopped hesitating.

The two Twelves Minor King experts immediately moved.

Many genius disciples from different sects besides them had similar plans like Huan Chen and Huo Yang. However, the abilities Jian Wushuang unleashed were completely out of their expectations. They had no choice but to take action earlier than planned.

“Charge!”

“We’ll do it together, only then can we possibly kill Jian Wushuang.”

“Let’s first kill Jian Wushuang. As for his head and the position token on him, that would depend on our individual skills.”

At that instant, dozens of individuals moved almost at the same time.

All of those taking action were top geniuses from various sects and every one of them was a First-class Divine Demon without a doubt.

That was to be expected as ever since the intense battle started, all of them could see Jian Wushuang’s abilities. Against such a terrifying opponent, it would mean instant death if those Second-Class Divine Demon participated.

Only First-Class Divine Demons were qualified to make a move on Jian Wushuang and posed some threats toward him.

Therefore, those who took action at that moment were 50 First-Class Divine Demons.

It was safe to say that more than half of the First-Class Divine Demons who entered Saint’s Tomb partake in the attack.

Their target was Jian Wushuang.

In addition, even though they came from different sects, they had a tacit understanding to first kill Jian Wushuang together before fighting for the position token in his possession as well as his head to be exchanged for those rewards.

The tacit understanding came out of necessity since the abilities Jian Wushuang had shown were truly terrifying.

Jian Wushuang continuously projected his soul power as he stood in the middle of the battlefield and immediately noticed when those 50 experts moved at the same time.

Jian Wushuang raised his head, his eyes filled with a coldness like never before. “Finally can’t hold back? All of you want my head in exchange for the rewards?”

If that’s the case, bring it on.”

I’ll have a hearty fight with each of you today until the heavens change its color!”

His cold voice was like the deep growl of death which lingered for a very long time as it resonated across the entire battlefield, Saint’s Tomb, and space between Heaven and Earth.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power surged like a great wave as his voice died down.

The divine power swiftly concentrated and very soon formed a gigantic golden divine god hologram.

One of the five most powerful secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sect—Divine God of Punishment!

With Jian Wushuang’s cultivation level upgrade and radically strengthened divine powers, the formed divine god hologram was no longer just 300 meters like before, but reached 1,600 meters!

The 1,600 meters divine god hologram was definitely much stronger than the previous 300 meters, despite it still being within the Divine God of Punishment first stage.

Jian Wushuang immediately gave out a furious growl as the 1,600-meter tall golden divine god hologram appeared.

Sweeping out like rolling waves was a stern growl.

In the void surrounding him, the grey mist and black energy flow domains were still suppressing Jian Wushuang. However, after that growl, the grey mist completely retreated while the dark energy flow utterly vanished. Both domain layers that previously were oppressing Jian Wushuang disappeared into nothingness.

Jian Wushuang’s abilities had already reached the highest peak possible at that time!

“There’s still more to this guy?”

Yu Aoqing was utterly shocked and terrified upon seeing both her imposed domains had perished.

As for those geniuses who were frenziedly charging towards Jian Wushuang, they could not care any less, despite seeing the golden divine god hologram and noticing the transformation of his abilities.

At the end of the day, there were 50 First-Class Divine Demons attacking at the same time. Each of them was geniuses with extremely solid battle strength. They even had a few Twelve Minor Kings among them and many other individuals whose abilities were close to the Twelve Minor Kings.

Nobody could withstand the power of that many people who joined the siege unless a real god appeared.

Hence, Jian Wushuang should not be able to do so either.

“Kill!”

“Kill him!”

Cold voices shouted one by one as those geniuses’ killing intent was surging like a tall wave.

“Kill!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang’s eyes also had a trace of redness with his killing intent also sweeping out of his body, like a Shura who emerged from Hell.

His figure was violently moving fast towards those geniuses around him.

He wanted to accept their attacks head-on!

“Die!”

Huan Chen and Huo Yang were charging on the forefront becoming one of the earliest who crossed hands with Jian Wushuang.

Huan Chen held a crimson-colored sickle in his hand as his bewitching eyes gazed at Jian Wushuang with a strange light.

Ring~~~ The formless soul attack had penetrated Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang was a Perfect Chaotic Creature and a reincarnated soul. Although his soul cultivation level was slightly lower, he was still an incredibly strong individual. In addition to his soul was protected by the Exquisite Pagoda, Huan Chen’s soul attack had no effect whatsoever on Jian Wushuang.

Huan Chen was left with no choice but to lash out his crimson sickle. A red flash appeared and disappeared within a split second.

As for Huo Yang, he brought with him a wave of fire. His punch exploded outwards with powers similar to the sudden eruption of a volcano that has been dormant for hundreds of millions of years.

The entire place was covered in a burning heat.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were still frosty. The Blood Mountain Sword in his grip was trembling violently at that moment as if resonating with the surging killing intent in his mind.

With a swing, the Blood Mountain Sword slashed without any flashy movement.

That stroke was accompanied by an extremely horrifying power and surging sword essence.

It was as if the world could be chopped into two halves with that stroke.

The sword-light swept sideways with an uprooting force along the way.

The crimson-colored light which was charging forward immediately flew backward with every trace of its volcanic energy was gone, as if being thrown into the ocean.

The joint attack of Huan Chen and Huo Yang had been reduced into a totally embarrassing state with only one slash from Jian Wushuang.
