Chapter 1383: Guest!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Soul Master He was the most famous soul master in White Sun Town, having a lot of experience.

When he battled with Jian Wushuang, he felt that Jian Wushuang was not familiar with consciousness control.

And Jian Wushuang also admitted, “I have always stayed in the mountains to cultivate by myself and seldom battled with others. So I am not quite proficient.”

Master He smiled, “Now I get it. You have already reached a level-three Soul Master in terms of your consciousness strength, but to be honest, there is still a way to go to pass the test.”

“Is it about the controlling technique of consciousness?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Master nodded, “As far as I know, a qualified level-three Soul Master not only needs powerful-enough consciousness strength, but also proficient techniques to use. I think you can try not until you further improved them.

Jian Wushuang understood.

Others in the hall felt sorry for Jian Wushuang.

“He just lost his chance because of his lack of proficiency.”

“What a shame!”

“Proficiency is only about practicing. But he does have the potential.”

People were discussing.

Master He looked at Jian Wushuang, “Now I have a suggestion.”

“Tell me about it.”

“Controlling consciousness proficiently needs practicing. In our Soul Master Temple, there are many excellent level-two Soul Masters.”

“So, if you like, you can stay here as our guest and communicate or battle with soul masters. After you improve your skills by practicing, I will ask judges from the headquarters to give you a test, OK?” Master He said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

Actually, he didn’t care about the title, but the opportunity to practice. Though the soul master were not of level three, they were good enough for Jian Wushuang to practice with.

“OK, so from now on you are our guest, with the same status with me.”

Jian Wushuang accepted delightedly.

“By the way, I have brought a gifted girl with me. Could you please arrange someone to guide her?” Jian Wushuang pointed at Xue Tong.

Xue Tong’s eyes were full of appreciation.

Master He looked at Xue Tong and accepted the request, “If she is talented enough, we will give her enough chances to unleash her potential.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Xue Tong appreciated him a lot.

Then Jian Wushuang stayed in the Soul Master Temple in the White Sun Town. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Though masters there had even weaker soul strength than Jian Wushuang, they definitely outperformed him in terms of controlling consciousness.

“They are indeed excellent in understanding and controlling consciousness!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed, “On the contrary, Divine Generals here are just mediocre.”

Actually, Tian Ling Mystery Land was quite different from the Eternal Chaotic World.

As was the cultivation mechanism.

The most important difference was that there were no God Tests in Tian Ling Mystery Land.

So Divine Generals here solely made a breakthrough by cultivating and by accumulating experience.

Without the challenge of the God Test, the Divine Generals here were far weaker than their equivalent in the Eternal Chaotic World.

“I have the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack than few soul masters have here. What I need is the practice to unleash the potential power of the Manipulation Knack.”

“That means I need to have battles with others.”

“So soul masters here are good resources for me!”

So Jian Wushuang started to invite soul masters there with a challenge battle.

In this way, he continued to improve the control skills of the Manipulation Knack.

Thirty years passed soon.

In the Soul Master Temple, two soul masters were talking.

“Have you heard that Jian Wushuang defeated Soul Master Luo Xian yesterday?”

“Of course, they both used the soul power strength of a normal level-two soul master, but Jian Wushuang obviously did a better job in using the skills.”

“But thirty years ago, how to control consciousness was new to Jian Wushuang. He has made such a great breakthrough in a short span of time.”

“Actually, Luo Xian is still more proficient in controlling consciousness. But Jian Wushuang uses the skills in a more clever way, better than Luo Xian’s Spirit Driven Skill.”

“Indeed.”

Everyone was talking about Jian Wushuang’s battle with Luo Xian.

In an independent secret room of the Soul Master Temple, Jian Wushuang was generating his soul power. He drove the power with his consciousness, transforming the soul power into a bird, a rabbit and then a ferocious beast.

Everything transformed was as if real.

“Transforming soul into animals. Now I know how to use the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack!”
