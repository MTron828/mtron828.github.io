Chapter 2294 The Reason behind Everything Part I

Jian Wushuang was placed on the bed beside a dignified woman. She was Luo Xinqin.“Mother, look, brother’s nose and mouth look exactly like yours,” Zhuo Peng said by the bed.

Luo Xinqin smiled and looked at Jian Wushuang with love.

Jian Wushuang was completely stunned.

“Is this... reincarnation?” Jian Wushuang thought.

But soon, a message entered Jian Wushuang’s mind.

The message was from his master Xuan Yi.

He finally knew what had happened to him.

“So I see, I was dead. Master did a Spacetime Reversal to revive my soul, and sent me down the reincarnation passage,” Jian Wushuang thought. He did not know that his wife had been sent down the reincarnation passage as well.

Xuan Yi left him more than that message.

Jian Wushuang started reading about everything that was happening.

“Disciple, you should have reincarnated at the Absolute Beginning Divine World by now. You will continue to grow there, and you should know why.”

“As your master, you should have guessed it, but I’m the guy with the huge forehead back at Green Fire World, the man you saw in your head, in that Ancient Display.”

He had already guessed Xuan Yi’s identity.

When he saw that Ancient Display, he had guessed that that man that fought against the heavens was likely his master.

In the Absolute Beginning Divine World, the man had been forced into a corner during an Ancient battle, and then did something to crumble the earth. That should have been the restriction formation at Eternal Chaotic World, sealing it away from the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

When Eternal Chaotic World fought against the Three Emperors World, Xuan Yi could control it with a flick of his hand.

Xuan Yi was naturally the owner of that formation.

Jian Wushuang read on.

“I was born in the Absolute Beginning Divine World as a unique, perfect Chaotic lifeform, taking a purpose with me since day one.”

“I had to fulfil my purpose no matter how tough it was. I was a sworn brother of the two founders of the Seven Star Black Sect, and I was so close to fulfilling that purpose with the help of the Seven Star Black Sect.”

“But at the final moment, a mutiny happened, Three Big Holy Land, Four Big Holy Tribes, Eight Big Holy Sects, and countless Absolute Beginning Divine World experts, interest-driven, slaughtered their way into the Seven Star Divine Realm. I was powerful, but there were too many of them. We had to retreat.”

“The Seven Star Black Sect faced elimination because of me, I had to seal the Seven Star Divine Realm out of desperation to protect the Seven Star Black Sect from a total wipeout.”

Jian Wushuang understood everything so far.

He had only known how the Ancient battle had been fought and ended previously.

Now he knew why. It was because of Xuan Yi.

His master as a unique perfect Chaotic lifeform had been born with a mission. The Seven Star Black Sect had simply helped him fulfil it.

But at the final moment, Absolute Beginning Divine World opposing forces had stopped it.

He could understand why that mysterious Seven Star Black Sect expert at the Eighth Lair was so angry with his master.

The battle had started because of his master Xuan Yi, leading to the end of the Seven Star Black Sect. It was normal to have hatred for him.

But what was a perfect Chaotic lifeform?

As a perfect Chaotic lifeform, what purpose did he have?

Jian Wushuang kept on reading.

“After that battle, before I died, although I sealed up the Seven Star Divine Realm, it took too much blood essence and Divine Power from so many experts. It drew 99% of the Seven Star Divine Realm’s spiritual influence of heaven and earth as well, leading it to becoming a basically barren land.”

“As the restriction formation continued to operate, the demand for the spiritual influence of heaven and earth increased, leading to worse cultivating environments for the First Era and Second Era experts. That was how the restriction on the earth was created.”

“Under those circumstances, the remaining Seven Star Black Sect experts had to sleep. I may have lost my body, but not my willpower, and that was active the entire time, thinking about how to solve that sticky situation.”

“The Seven Star Black Sect and I may have lost then, but many experts were always indignant about it. We all wanted to fight our way back into the Absolute Beginning Divine World!”

“But, how tough was that?”

Jian Wushuang paused and sighed.

Indeed, the Seven Star Black Sect had lost badly in that war.

The Seven Star Divine Realm had only been preserved due to that restriction formation.

Without that, Seven Star Divine Realm and the Seven Star Black Sect would have become history. Xuan Yi’s formation had given them a slim fighting chance.

But it was too slim.

It had protected the Seven Star Divine Realm, but it had turned it into barren land, incapable of breeding experts.

The Seven Star Black Sect experts could only sleep to retain their powers.

Under those circumstances, how could they fight their way back into the Absolute Beginning Divine World?
