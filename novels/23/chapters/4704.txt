4705 Eight-Armed Buddha Image

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate any longer. He raised his palm and the great supreme Yan power was unleashed.

The terrifying power that could even destroy a Yan Immortal turned into a pillar of light that shot up into the sky and struck the black-gold palm.

However, an unbelievable scene appeared.

The two collided, and the thousands of streams of light from the explosion scattered. However, the giant black-golden palm only trembled. Not only was it not damaged in the slightest, but it also became more solid.

“Retreat!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed and he quickly retreated. Chun Qiu and the others also moved in an instant to escape the range of the black-golden palm.

Five of the weaker cultivators were hit and died on the spot. Their vast Yan power was completely absorbed.

The ground sank thousands of feet, and a chasm was torn open.

The bald Arhat standing on the lotus platform laughed. As his figure moved, the eight-armed Buddha image with angry eyes behind him also moved the clouds and came over. It was inexplicably eerie and strange as it loomed in the dense clouds.

The black and white heads then shot down four beams of light from their eye sockets.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand to cast an enchantment to cover everyone. Then, he held an Invisible Sword and flew up. He stepped on the light pillar and went straight to the Lotus platform in the sky.

The bald Arhat’s gaze focused and he waved his palm to bring down layers of Eight Trigrams. The eight-armed Buddha behind him also opened its huge mouths at the same time and sucked in all the energy that was escaping. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Even Jian Wushuang felt that the Yan power that was spreading around his body was being devoured.

“Foul-mouthed Junior, obediently accept your fate.” The bald Arhat laughed weirdly. His arms danced wildly, blasting out countless Eight Trigrams.

Jian Wushuang stepped on the light pillar and guided the invisible sword forward with one hand.

It was another Extinctive Sword Strike!

100,000 swords combined into one. There was no gaudy radiance overflowing, but no one dared to look at it directly.

The sky was torn apart by this attack.

The sword of Extinctive Sword Strike seemed to have entered a no man’s land, instantly breaking through the layers of Eight Trigrams, and then stabbed towards the bald Arhat without losing any momentum.

Everything happened too quickly, so fast that the bald Arhat did not even have time to react before the Extinctive Sword Strike hit the left side of his face.

Divine blood gushed out, and a complete left ear fell on the lotus platform.

This was a huge humiliation!

The bald Arhat came back to his senses from his disbelief. The humiliation he had suffered again and again had driven him crazy.

A total of eight boundless forces that blotted out the sky covered the entire Whirling Heaven.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were solemn. From the several confrontations, the bald Arhat who called himself Whirling Patriarch was still at the peak of the Yan Immortal realm, but the Yan power he displayed showed signs of a breakthrough, especially the eight-armed monster behind him, which made him surpass it in one fell swoop and reach an unknown realm.

The terrifying power descended with an earth-shattering force. Chun Qiu and the others had already activated the Yan power barrier to deal with this disaster.

As for Jian Wushuang, he wanted to open the Boyang Bottle to let the three Emperors participate in the battle, but there were more than 20 Young Emperor’s spies around him. If he rashly released the three Emperors, he was afraid that he would not be able to explain himself.

After quickly dispelling this thought, Jian Wushuang used Extreme Darkness Heavenly Gate.

The giant palm formed by the essence of thousands of divine weapons surged like the sun and collided with the eight black-gold palms.

Layers of explosion ripples swept up from the center, instantly sweeping away the clouds that shrouded the entire Whirling Heaven. At the same time, huge waves were stirred up on the surface of the giant sea.

Even Yan Immortal could not escape unscathed from this unimaginable explosion. Even Chun Qiu and the others, who were far away from the battle, felt their hearts palpitate.

Jian Wushuang took half a step back and the Extreme Darkness Heavenly Gate finally dissipated. However, although the eight black-gold palms were extremely dim, they still existed and continued to attack him with great power!

At the critical moment, an ethereal but extremely tough Yan power turned into layers of enchantment and blocked Jian Wushuang’s head, preventing the eight black-gold palms from advancing any further.

At the same time, a thin purple-robed figure appeared behind him and said, “Go.”

Jian Wushuang understood tacitly. He immediately jumped up and turned into the sharpest arrow, shooting at the bald Arhat.

Thousands of rays of brilliance gathered in Jian Wushuang’s palm. Almost as soon as the bald Arhat reacted, they covered the sky and surrounded him.

A hint of panic flashed across the bald Arhat’s face. He hurriedly waved his hands and abandoned the lotus platform, sitting on the palm of the eight-armed Buddha image form behind him.

Jian Wushuang rushed over and crushed the lotus platform with one foot. He looked at the bald Arhat with a calm gaze.

The ear that had been cut off by the sword had already grown back, but he was still filled with hatred after being humiliated so many times.

Even though the bald Arhat now understood that he had kicked a hard obstacle, he could no longer turn back under the command of his mind!

As long as he could completely devour it, he would definitely be able to take that step and ascent to the next cultivation realm!

At the thought of this, the bald Arhat’s eyes gleamed. He looked at Jian Wushuang with a cold smile and said, “Foul-mouthed Junior, if you’re willing to kneel down and kowtow to me three times today, I’ll let bygones be bygones and let you leave the Whirling Heaven safely. How about it?”

Jian Wushuang was extremely calm and sneered. “You think you are worthy of making me kneel down with your mediocre cultivation method? If you kowtow to me three hundred times, I can consider leaving your corpse intact.”

“Arrogant fool, I’ll sit here today and see what you can do to me,” the bald Arhat stood up on the palm of the eight-armed Buddha image and shouted loudly.

Without a doubt, Jian Wushuang swept forward with his sword, and the vast Sword Intent slashed forward. However, the bald Arhat did not dodge, but took it with his body.

The Sword Intent swept out and directly cut off one of the bald Arhat’s arms.

Then, he hugged his arms and cried out in pain. His figure subconsciously retreated, obviously trying to escape!

Jian Wushuang did not want to miss such a good opportunity. He stepped into the air and grabbed him, ready to kill him directly.

With the skinny purple-robed man, Zheng Ying, and the others dealing with the eight-armed Buddha image form, Jian Wushuang could pursue the bald Arhat with all his might.

He, who had lost an arm, seemed to be scared out of his wits. He moved forward in a panic, and his speed was a little slow.

In just a few breaths, Jian Wushuang had already arrived behind him and directly slashed down with his sword.

Suddenly, an arm grew out of the bald Arhat’s back and grabbed the sword.

“Hehehe…”

There was a strange sound. On the back of the bald Arhat’s head, which only had a few strands of hair left, an ugly face appeared. Its huge, pancake-like lips moved toward Jian Wushuang without saying anything.

Jian Wushuang felt a chill in his heart. He immediately raised his sword and stabbed it into the mouth of the strange face.
