Chapter 1105: Getting the Axe

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Level Three?” asked Jian Wushuang. He could not help but feel tempted.

He had managed to cultivate the Divine Yin Thunder Secret Skill to Level Two on Star Island with a great deal of labor. This Secret Skill had never been improved since then. However, if it broke through into Level Three, that definitely would give his strength a big boost.

“Looks like I definitely have to get my hands on the Chaos Divine Thunder,”?Jian Wushuang thought as he licked his lips.

Firstly, he had to get the giant axe.

“I shall act directly then.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and dashed toward the magic weapon.

The purple beast immediately picked up his movements the moment he drew near.

“Roar!”

An ear-splitting roar reverberated across the entire chasm as the huge body of the Exotic Beast dashed out from its resting place with alarming speed, covered with lightning. In an instant, it appeared before Jian Wushuang, and it clawed at the intruder with its sharp talons.

Jian Wushuang’s expression remained calm as the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand. He then casually struck at the claws of his opponent with it.

“Clang!”

The sound of metal clashing against metal rang out, and Jian Wushuang’s figure retreated quickly away.

“Damned human,” the beast hissed.

Its gaze was extremely murderous; it had recognized Jian Wushuang.?It then continued attacking in a fit of rage.

This time, the beast had no plans to allow the accursed human to escape again.

Soon, two figures, one chasing and the other fleeing, could be seen bursting out from underground as they dashed toward the surrounding Void.

Just as the beast was lured out of hiding by Jian Wushuang, Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long, who had remained in hiding all this while, acted immediately. They snuck into the chasm and located the giant axe before absorbing it into an Interspatial Ring. The hunchbacked Celestial Master Yi then sent a message to Jian Wushuang to keep him updated.

“Have they already got the axe?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

A smile appeared on his lips as he received the message. He did not want to waste any more time with the beast and shook it off easily with his Dragon Blood Secret Skill.

He then gathered with the Celestial Masters in a spot within the Void.

“Celestial Master Yi, take out the giant axe quickly for us to see,” said Celestial Master Meng Long happily.

“Sure,” replied his companion readily. He then drew out the weapon with a wave of his hand.

“Its power is extremely great—much more than normal Chaos Magic Weapons, to be exact. It should already be classified as the Chaos Magic Treasure, right?” asked Celestial Master Meng Long as he stared at the axe.

“It’s definitely a Chaos Magic Treasure, but it’s a pity that it has been damaged and not as powerful as it used to be,” replied Celestial Master Yi regretfully.

“Even if it’s not as powerful as it used to be, it’s still much more powerful than the magic weapon you’re using,” retorted Celestial Master Meng Long as he rolled his eyes.

“Haha, you’re right,” laughed Celestial Master Yi, seeming extremely happy.

His expression grew solemn after the usual show of humility. “Jian Wushuang, Celestial Master Meng Long, I managed to get this giant axe because of help from the both of you, especially Jian Wushuang. It’s extremely valuable and should fetch close to 20,000 Fire Points. I wish to give the two of you my 15,000 Fire Points that I’ve accumulated painstakingly over the years; it’ll up to both of you to divide them amongst yourselves,” he suggested.

He sounded extremely sincere.

The giant axe was extremely suitable for him and obviously not for Jian Wushuang or Celestial Master Meng Long. As such, logically the weapon should go to him, but he had to offer a suitable amount of Fire Points to both of them in return.

The giant axe’s value was somewhere near what he said—20,000 Fire Points. As such, his offer of 15,000 Fire Points to be split amongst his two accomplices was extremely generous; after all, he had also put in a considerable amount of effort into obtaining the weapon.

If he had not felt its presence earlier on, none of them would have discovered the weapon in the first place.

“It’s all due to your sharp senses, Celestial Master Yi, and your act of luring the purple beast away, Jian Wushuang, that we managed to obtain the giant axe. I didn’t contribute at all and I can’t possibly accept the offer of Fire Points,” said Celestial Master Meng Long with a laugh.

Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang also shook his head. “The giant axe was discovered by you first, Celestial Master Yi, and naturally it should go to you. As for drawing the beast away, it was nothing. I don’t want the Fire Points. If you really wish to thank me, I have a request to make,” he said.

“A request?” asked Celestial Master Yi as he looked toward Jian Wushuang. “Speak your mind, my young friend,” he said readily.

The Celestial Master considered Jian Wushuang to have saved the lives of both his companion and himself earlier on, and Jian Wushuang had even distracted the Exotic Beast so that they could obtain the giant axe. As such, he was truly grateful to Jian Wushuang, and he would have agreed to any request, as long as it was within his means.

“When I saw the giant axe, I noticed that there’s an extremely strong piece of Chaos Divine Thunder contained with it. I don’t suppose you could give it to me?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Chaos Divine Thunder?” asked the Celestial Master with a frown. In truth, he knew what was hidden in the weapon after becoming its master.

“There’s indeed Chaos Divine Thunder in this axe; it should have been left behind by its previous owner. It is of not much use to me, and you can take it if you wish to, young friend,” he agreed.

“Then I shall thank you for your kindness,” said Jian Wushuang, feeling pleased.

Celestial Master Yi drew the Chaos Divine Thunder in the axe out, allowing Jian Wushuang to transfer it into his body carefully.

It was a rather successful operation.

Even though the Chaos Divine Thunder was in Jian Wushuang’s body now, it was still not under his control. He would have to refine it completely before he could slowly absorb its power and cultivate his own Divine Yin Thunder Secret Skill to greater levels.

“Now that I’ve obtained the Chaos Divine Thunder, I have to go somewhere to do the closed-door training for a while. You two do not have to wait for me, please continue to seek for opportunities,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Since that’s the case, we’ll take our leave,” the Celestial Masters said.

They then set off quickly.

After they left, Jian Wushuang found a quiet spot and built a temporary cave mansion for himself. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He sat cross-legged in the cave mansion, feeling the powers of two thunderbolts beating within himself.

They were the Divine Yin Thunder, which he had cultivated from his Secret Skill, and the Chaos Divine Thunder within the giant axe from the purple beast’s lair.

He wanted to refine the Chaos Divine Thunder and absorb it slowly into his Divine Yin Thunder.

“Let’s begin!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He let out a stream of air lightly and immediately began the refining process.
