Chapter 881: Scheduling Battles

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bang!

There was a deafening clap.

The scarlet longsword was busted up while Tian Quan’s body was shaken so strongly that he took a few steps backward.

But the scarlet longsword didn’t calm down at all and continued shooting up as if it was completely controlled by Jian Wushuang’s consciousness.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Under Jian Wushuang’s manipulation, the scarlet longsword began madly attacking Tian Quan. Although Tian Quan could withstand the attacks, he felt under great pressure.

“Stop! Blood Mountain!” Tian Quan suddenly shouted as his voice trailed off.

“Why? You want to give in?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew cold while the scarlet longsword combined by 36 Blood-sky Swords was quietly hanging behind him, radiating an amazingly foul air.

“Give in? Haha, you don’t deserve it!”

Tian Quan sneered at him and continued, “Today I’ve got other things to do, so I don’t want to waste my time battling with you. Let’s fix a date to have a final showdown, shall we?”

“Fix a date to have a final showdown?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows as he sneered in his heart.

Star Island was like a huge prison, where people was so dull that they seldom had other things to do. How could it possible for Tian Quan to have other things to do on this dull island. He probably felt afraid of being defeated, so he planned to battle with Jian Wushuang next time.

After all, he must have enough time to prepare this battle. For Jian Wushuang, it seemed that Tian Quan probably had some unique ways to improve his strength.

Jian Wushuang had seen through Tian Quan, but he didn’t lay bare the fact.

“You want to battle with me next time, don’t you?” Jian Wushuang looked at Tian Quan with a sneer.

“Yes,” Tian Quan looked back to him while his voice was pretty cold. “Of course, since it was battle, let’s have it with a bet. I don’t know whether you dare accept it?”

“A bet?” Jian Wushuang’s smile grew wider. “What would you like to bet with me?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s simple. The bet is the woman behind you and all the treasure on you.” Tian Quan’s eyes were shone with a strange light.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang frowned and he couldn’t help casting an eye on Ling Long.

He didn’t any panic on Ling Long’s splendid face. She looked rather calm. When Jian Wushuang looked to her, he nodded softly to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately knew her with assurance.

Everything was determined by strength on Star Island.

If Jian Wushuang couldn’t defeat Tian Quan, Ling Long fall into Tian Quan’s hands whether there was a battle.

“When?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“In three days,” Tian Quan replied.

“Okay, deal,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “If you lose, you likewise have to give me all your treasure. Also, you must leave Star Island and wander about in fog sea. And you’re not allowed to go back for 100 thousand years.”

“What?” People around were all startled.

Even Tian Quan’s face suddenly changed.

Giving all his treasure was one thing, but leaving Star Island to wander in fog sea for 100 thousand years was quite another.

As was known to all, it was quite dangerous in fog sea that even Dao Master could hardly ignore those dangers.

Jian Wushuang had just wandered in fog sea for several years. And he was so lucky at that time that he passed through all the dangers alone.

But 100 thousand years was so long that no one knew what would happen.

Tian Quan was powerful indeed, but if he gave all his treasure, it would be a dead end for him to wander in fog sea for 100 thousand years.

“On what basis should I wander out of Star Island? That’s not fair.” Tian Quan glared at Jian Wushuang.

“Because my treasure is worth more than one billion Divine Gems,” Jian Wushuang’s voice grew muffled. “If your treasure is as valuable as mine, you don’t have to leave here.”

“One billion Divine Gems?” People around became dizzy after hearing this.

Tian Quan was also startled by this.

One billion Divine Gems was almsot equivalent to all the assets of a Dao Master.

How could it possible that Jian Wushuang’s treasure was so valuable.

Tian Quan had been stuck on Star Island for more than millions of years, and the only chance that he could get Divine Gem was to rob others and he often failed. So he had little treasure.

He may have less than 100 million Divine Gems altogether, far less than one-tenth of Jian Wushuang’s.

In terms of such a huge disparity, it was reasonable that Jian Wushuang put forward such a request in the case of fairness.

“Okay, I agree.” Tian Quan nodded solemnly as his voice demonstrated some kind of craze.

With a bet worthing one billion Divine Gems, the risk was worth taking for him.

Besides, he was confident to his own strength. More importantly, the battle was fixed in three days.

“Three days? Hump, three days is too much. I can achieve at a higher level with my Secret Skill in two days. My strength will improve significantly at that time. Except the monster who has passed through Level Two, who is my rival among the kings on Star Island?”

“As for Blood Mountain… Hump! He has just come to Star Island for two years. How dare of him to battel with me!”

Tian Quan sneered while he stretched out his hand to make a bow with hands folded in front and said respectfully, “Lord Spirit Sound, I have bet with Blood Mountain. Hope you can bear witness for us.”

After that, a seductive, red figure appeared. That was Lord Spirit Sound.

Lord Spirit Sound mastered the whole Star Island and she knew everything happened on Star Island.

“No problem,” Lord Spirit Sound nodded. “In three days, you will duel based on the rules.”

After that, her figure disappeared again.

An insidious smile grew on Tian Quan’s face and he glanced at Jian Wushuang with a ferocious smile, turning away.

It seemed that Tian Quan didn’t know there was also an imperceptible smile on Jian Wushuang’s face when Lord Spirit Sound agreed to witness their duel.

After Tian Quan left, all people spread about.

Jian Wushuang took Ling Long and headed inside of Star Island.

“Blood Mountain, thanks a lot just now.” Ling Long said gratefully.

“You’re welcome,” Jian Wushuang smiled, shaking his head. “By the way, you’re safe for the time being. If I fail in three days, I can’t protect you anymore.”

“You won’t.” Ling Long looked deeply to Jian Wushuang. It was not too long that she got to know about Jian Wushuang, but she was clearer about how unbelievable he was.

Jian Wushuang was the one who could go so far with Divine Realm. It was very incredible!

Watching Ling Long’s eyes, Jian Wushuang gave a shrug and said, “How did you manage over the past few years in fog sea? Have you met Jiu Zui?”
