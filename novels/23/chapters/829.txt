Chapter 830: A Wild Battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The crowd began to clamor once they heard the lady’s words.

“Battle all by ourselves? I never thought that the second round would be a wild battle.”?Jian Wushuang eyes narrowed.

Thirty thousand people must fight with any means within the Restriction until one thousand of them remain?

The battle had to be intense.

However, secure in the knowledge that they would not really be killed, the participants all felt better.

“Get ready.”

The lady scanned the crowd and lifted her hand before shouting, “Let the battle commence!”

Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

The moment the words escaped the lady’s lips, a fierce battle broke out among the crowd.

With so many people fighting in such a small space, it promised to be a brutal battle.

“Kill! Kill!”

“Go to hell!”

“Get out of my way!”

Each of the participants from the thirty-six prefectures attacked those closest to them.

At that point, regardless of who you were or where you were from, everyone around you was your enemy.

Boom! Boom! Clang! Clang!

A series of heavy crashes resounded throughout the campsite. The fights had barely started when people began to get thrown out the Restriction one after another.

Those people were “killed” by others and transported by the Restriction. Soon, over five thousand people had been eliminated, and the number was still rising.

Before long, about one-third of the participants were transported out by the Restriction.

Outside the Restriction, the sergeants of the Royal Guard and the commanders of the prefectures all watched the fight with great interest.

They thought that, though there was a large number of participants, as long as long as they fought wildly, the battle would end soon.

“The participants are all excellent, and I’ve spotted over a hundred top Divine Realm experts among them.” One commander commented with a smile.

“Yeah, I agree.” Someone nodded with approval.

Normally, there would be only one or two top Divine Realm experts of a generation in a territory; however, the Tang of the East was so immense that even if just a small amount of such experts in each of its prefectures participated in the selection, the total number would be quite large.

Therefore, over a hundred Divine Realm experts stood out among the fighters in the Restriction.

Nevertheless, even those top experts had to be very careful in such a wild battle. After all, some top experts had been thrown out the battlefield as they had been besieged by many or encountered someone stronger than themselves.

Inside the Restriction, the battle carried on violently.

Weng! A huge axe swung ferociously across the void.

It cut the void open like splitting a mountain, a terrifying force came sweeping from it.

The dozen superior Divine Realm experts in front of the axe were sent out of the Restriction the moment the axe slashed through them, even though they were superior Divine Realm experts powerful enough to make it this far. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Oh?”

The spectator’s eyes were lit up by the strike.

“This strike is really powerful. The power behind it must be of Step Four of the Eternal Realm.”

“Which prefecture does this guy come from?”

“Ha ha, he is Asura, from our Inconstancy Prefecture.”

“Asura?”

“Asura should be his alias. It’s impressive indeed for him to gain such power as a Divine Realm expert. Few in the Eternal World can achieve this.”

The commanders all praised the man.

Many of the Royal Guard sergeants also looked toward Asura in amazement.

For the Royal Guard, a top Divine Realm expert was nothing special, as any one of them could battle such an expert.

In fact, the top Divine Realm experts could be divided into three separate groups: ordinary experts, exceptional genius, and extremely exceptional genius.

Among them, the ordinary top experts were in the One Step Eternal Realm, while the exceptional geniuses were in the Two Steps or Three Steps Eternal Realm.

The extremely exceptional geniuses, such as Asura, were in Step Four of the Eternal Realm or even above.

Naturally, experts such as this drew most of the attention.

“Asura may be the most powerful one among all the participants. One on one, none of them could be his match or take so much as a single move from him.” One commander uttered his opinion.

“You’re right. Apart from him, the next most powerful participant is barely in the Step Three and absolutely could not withstand his strike.”

The others all nodded their approval.

“Look, Asura is invincible in the Restriction now.”

Obviously, Asura had become the topic of the commanders’ chatting. In a red robe and with a straight face, he launched a series of attacks with his double-edged giant axe and where he passed, destruction reigned.

No one could stand in his way, nor could anyone take a blow from him.

At that time, he looked just like the real Asura.

Unbeatable!

“Asura is coming at us. Run! Hurry!”

“Stay away from him!”

Having learned of Asura’s power, all the participants ran from him when they spotted him approaching. No one dared to challenge him.

“A group of trash!”

Asura sneered and looked around, a faint killing intent radiated from him. Suddenly, he sped up and moved toward a black figure.

It seemed the figure did not expect this and struggled to dodge him.

“Humph!”

Asura snorted and swung his axe at the black figure casually.

Though the strike seemed normal, it had the power of Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

Even the best Divine Realm experts on that battlefield could not take the blow without being harmed, let alone the mediocre black figure who Asura had attacked. Everybody thought that the figure would be eliminated by Asura’s strike like many before him.

However, when the axe was about to hit the figure, a bright sword light suddenly flashed in the air.

It came to meet the axe like lightning.
