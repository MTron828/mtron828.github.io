Chapter 2146 Poised to Attack

Thunderbolt Island, Eternal Chaotic World. While the battle broke out at the Imperial City.Countless experts had gathered.

Not only the human Sanctuary Alliance but the Special Tribes Alliance as well. There were countless experts.

At a glance, there was no fewer than four thousand people.

Four thousand may not sound like a lot, but if the four thousand people were all Almighties, the power would be enough to shock the world!

The birth of an Almighty was not easy at all. Any one of them could be regarded as an overlord, every single one of them could easily open regions and dominate kingdoms. There were at most a dozen Almighties in the Sanctuary Alliance.

Four thousand was a terrifying number.

Only when the two major alliances joined forces and gathered almost all the elites in the Eternal Chaotic World could such a number be produced.

It was Eternal Chaotic World’s maximum strength.

Every single Almighty around was eager.

They knew why Emperor Bai had gathered them.

No doubt, it had to be for the final battle!!!

Within the Presbytery Pavilion, the Great Emperors from both alliances had gathered.

Even putting Jian Wushuang’s team of eight Great Emperors aside, both alliances could produce over twenty Great Emperors when they joined forces.

Many of those twenty Great Emperors came from the human domain. Many did not belong to the Sanctuary Alliance beforehand. Joining the Alliance was an inevitable choice for the upcoming battle, like Master Wu and Great Emperor Dong Gu.

The Great Emperors were excited as well.

“King Luo Yu, there are no problems over at the special tribes’ side, right?” Emperor Bai looked towards King Luo Yu and An Quan.

“Rest assured, Emperor Bai. The Ancient Emperor instructed all special tribe experts to heed your commands before he left. With your orders, all experts of the special tribes alliance have rushed toward Thunderbolt Island. No one has kept any tactics from us. The many Dao soldiers and Ancient God blood essences that the Ancient God Clan collected were all distributed. We are ready,” King Luo Yu said solemnly.

With Jian Wushuang, King Chen Xing, and Black Dragon Emperor headed for Three Emperors World, many issues of the Special Tribes Alliance were left to King Luo Yu and An Quan.

“Good,” Emperor Bai smiled and nodded, turning to the other person by his side. “Tian Chen, how are our Sanctuary Alliance soldiers?”

“They have all gathered,” Ancestor Tian Chen said. “As you ordered, all experts who decided to join the battle were given the Secret Skills of Star Palace. Most of them can use the Secret Skills of Star Palace’s first scroll.”

“The Sanctuary Alliance and other forces have collated their hard-collected resources and redistributed them. Most of them now hold a Mixed Elements Pill that can restore their divine power in a short period of time, and a Heavenly Life Pill that can restore their divine body’s injuries. Even without those two pills, they will at least have replacement elixirs and treasures.”

“Many experts of the Sanctuary Alliance will be able to set up certain battle formations. Lastly, the trump cards we have, like the Heaven Piercing Arrow, Dragon Imprisoning Formation, Blood Thunder Pill, Star God Puppet, and the Emperor Token, have all been prepared.”

Emperor Bai nodded in satisfaction.

“Everything is ready, we just need to wait for Jian Wushuang to use the Void Token,” Emperor Bai clenched his fists.

Many of the Great Emperors were anxious.

They were all waiting for the battle.

…

In the Imperial City, the battle continued.

The battle had split into two battlefields.

The first battlefield was filled with many Great Emperors fighting fiercely.

There were seven Great Emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World, and nineteen from the Three Emperors World.

The quantity was not in proportion, but the seven Great Emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World were of high quality.

The weakest of the seven, Emperor God Tian Ling and Lei Yuan, were at pinnacle First Stage. The rest were all Second Stage Great Emperors.

Especially Jian Yi!

As Jian Wushuang’s Sword Servant, and an Ancient Era expert whose abilities had been fully restored, Jian Yi’s powers were at pinnacle Second Stage levels. With the many skills he had, he had an advantage over Ling Zong and Wei An, the two middle-aged Second Stage Great Emperors.

The remaining six Great Emperors were all using their full combat powers. With Jian Wushuang’s additional Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror, releasing the five Godly Spirits into the battlefield, their total strength was not inferior to the nineteen emperors of the Three Emperors Worlds.

The battle between both sides was extremely fierce, but it was difficult to determine victory and defeat in such a short time.

The second battlefield was where Jian Wushuang was located.

Jian Wushuang was in his enormous Ancient Clan form, with his nine heads and eighteen arms. He had no fear of going against the two Third Stage Great Emperors Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su at the same time.

He could not take down the two Third Stage Great Emperors in front of him, but neither could Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su, who had joined forces.

Both battlefields were in a stalemate.

But not for long.

From the Imperial Cabinet, another huge Space Tunnel appeared.

A series of figures emerged from the Space Tunnel. At a glance, there were hundreds of people.

Most of them were Sir Gods and Emperor Gods, but the eight at the forefront standing side by side, with their magnificent auras, were true Great Emperors.

“From… the Holocaust Sect?”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils narrowed.

A blood-tainted robe and that eerie aura emanating from them confirmed the identity of the people.

But what made Jian Wushuang surprised was that amongst these Holocaust Sect experts, Leng Ruxue was nowhere to be seen. Instead, there was a red-haired elder.

That elder stood there and his aura felt like a raging flame that had burned for endless years.

Jian Wushuang felt tremendous pressure from him.

It was much stronger than when he had faced Ba Su and Demon King Chen Yu.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
