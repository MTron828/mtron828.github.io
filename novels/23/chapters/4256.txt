4257 Three Swords Out, Seal Gu

“The second strike.”

“Split open the sky.”

As soon as Jian Wushuang finished speaking, the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand trembled thousands of times. A sword light gradually condensed and then, like a rolling river, it crushed toward Cang Feng with a muffled Boom!

In the beginning, the sword was only as thick as a strand of hair. As the sword Qi condensed, it gradually became as thick as an arm. When the sword really crossed the sky, it was as if the sky river was hanging upside down, and the sun and moon were connected. It was extremely amazing!

The brilliant might of the heavens, guided by the sword!

At this moment, everyone raised their heads to look at the sword, their expressions horrified!

“Godly swordsmanship!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This is a true sword cultivator!!

“Who is this person? Why wasn’t he famous before?”

This sword instantly caught everyone’s attention. Even Hong Ye and Commander Mountain Shaker had a flash of surprise in their eyes.

This…this is the aura of fourth level sword principle!

Cang Feng’s breathing quickened as he stared at the heaven-opening sword ray. His eyes were filled with horror as if he had seen a ghost.

Only those who were also sword cultivators could understand the horror of this sword!

He could clearly feel that Jian Wushuang’s heaven-opening sword light had far surpassed his comprehension of sword principle!

It was the aura of a fourth level sword principle!

Even a Supreme martial artist might not be able to deduce his own Dao to the fourth level!

“I’m not his match, I have to run!”

Cang Feng’s mind whirred as he made up his mind. he took a step forward and was about to escape!

However, before he could rise from the pit…

Bang!

The heaven-opening sword ray descended!

“Get lost!”

Cang Feng roared as he raised the blue divine sword above his head to block the heaven splitting sword radiance!

Chi chi chi!

Countless sparks flew as Cang Feng’s clothes were torn apart, revealing his muscular body.

All the divine power in his body surged and poured into the blue divine sword in an attempt to block the sky-opening sword radiance.

However, no matter if it was the strength of Jian Wushuang’s divine power, his comprehension of the sword principle, or the grade of the Wuqi Divine Sword, Jian Wushuang was far superior to him. How could he block it?

In the face of absolute strength, all resistance would not be able to withstand a single blow!

Kacha! Kacha!

Cracks began to appear on the blue divine sword.

The crack began to spread rapidly!

Break!!!

Cang Feng gritted his teeth and roared!

Cha cha cha!

More and more cracks appeared!

In the next moment, the blue divine sword was completely shattered into countless pieces.

The heaven-opening sword ray landed on Cang Feng’s shoulder!

Bang!

Cang Feng was forced back into the crater by the heaven-opening sword radiance. It was as if there was a huge force that wanted to press him under the five finger mountain!

Ka ka ka!

His legs could not withstand the huge force from the sky-opening sword ray, and his knees gradually bent.

Bang!

Following a loud explosion, Cang Feng knelt on the ground, his knees creating two craters in the ground!

The sky-opening sword ray was still on his shoulder, pressing down!

The sharp sword essence kept exploding in his body!

After a while, the heaven-opening sword light finally dissipated.

Cang Feng kneeled on the ground, his aura was extremely weak, his divine power was like a lamp without oil, he was clearly on the verge of death.

With one sword, the blue shattered and Cang Feng knelt!

When countless people saw this scene, they felt a chill run down their spines to their heads, as if they had fallen into an ice cellar.

They turned their heads stiffly and looked at Jian Wushuang in shock. The disbelief in their eyes turned into shock.

Even Commander Mountain Shaker’s mouth was wide open, and his eyes were wide open.

Ruler Grotto Profound stood there in a daze, even forgetting that he had been heavily injured.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang was like the sun in the sky, and everyone looked up to him.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm and emotionless. It was as if he had just done something insignificant to him.

He looked at Cang Feng and said indifferently, “The third strike.”

With that, Cang Feng’s eyes flashed with a look of fear as he looked at Hong Ye for help. He raised his head with great difficulty and said weakly, “Hong…Hong Ye, save me…”

Hong Ye’s eyes flickered as she stepped in front of Cang Feng and extended her hand, “Stop! We admit defeat in this battle, and you can take this God Sealing Tablet!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a touch of joy flashed in the eyes of Mountain Shaker and the others. They quickly turned to look at Jian Wushuang and said, “Blood Sword, it’s done.”

However, Jian Wushuang seemed to ignore it and said indifferently, “I said three swords, and I mean three swords. no one can block it.”

The third sword, Sundering Stars!

“Whoosh!”

In an instant, time seemed to have stopped. The surging wind, floating clouds, and floating dust in the void all turned into the purest energy, shooting from all directions like a hundred rivers flowing back. Finally, they all gathered in Jian Wushuang’s hand and turned into a silver sword rainbow that was a thousand feet long!

Jian Wushuang spread his fingers and held the sword rainbow. There seemed to be an invisible force between heaven and earth that lifted him up.

At this moment, he no longer concealed his aura. A sharp sword essence shot up into the sky as if it was going to shatter the chaos and split the world!

Jian Wushuang was like the sword God Ling Chen!

“Slash!”

Jian Wushuang said coldly.

In an instant, the thousand-foot sword rainbow slashed down!

This sword was vast and mighty, directly splitting the sky nearly 10000 feet apart!

“This?”

Hong Ye’s expression changed drastically. Even he felt a sense of powerlessness in the face of this sword.

A sense of threat that was like a piercing light enveloped him!

For the first time, apart from facing a powerful being, Hong Ye felt like he was about to die!

“This person…I can’t block it.”

Hong Ye took a deep breath, and a serious look appeared in his eyes.

He then turned to Cang Feng and shook his head, “Cang Feng, you’re on your own.”

After saying that, Hong Ye actually took a step and fled.

“No!”

Seeing this, Cang Feng let out a howl of despair.

Bang!

The Sundering Stars sword finally slashed down!

Under this sword, it was as if the heavens were angry and doomsday disasters were coming. The earth began to crack and split, and bottomless chasms appeared!

The violent sword Qi swept in all directions, setting off a storm that razed everything to the ground!

Everyone’s expression changed drastically, and they retreated thousands of feet!

The might of a single sword is so terrifying!!

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air and thought of the same thing.

In the middle of the storm, Jian Wushuang had put away the Wuqi Divine Sword in his Interspatial Ring.

The storm gradually dissipated, only to see that the thousand-foot area where the seal was hidden was in ruins.

There was no trace of Cang Feng’s life there. Under this sword, Cang Feng’s body and soul were completely destroyed. He could not be more dead!
