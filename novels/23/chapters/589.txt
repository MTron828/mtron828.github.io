“Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Where... are you?”

“Where the hell are you?”

The forlorn and shrill voice reverberated through the area.

Jian Meng’er had cried Jian Wushuang three times until her voice became hoarse.

She had hated him to the core, but now, she wished that he would appear to save them as he had done many times before in the Nanyang Continent.

Besides Jian Meng’er, many clansmen here were also fervently crying a name in their hearts.

This name was none other than Jian Wushuang!

He was their pride and joy and regarded as a legend even in the entire Nanyang Continent.

Everyone hoped that this legend would show up to protect them.

However, nothing happened even after Jian Meng’er’s voice had faded.

Jian Wushuang had not appeared.

Despair!

All the clansmen fell into despair.

On the platform, the scarlet-robed man sneered as he heard Jian Meng’er’s cries. He started to laugh after the cries had stopped.

“Haha... Jian Wushuang? You’re thinking of a loser who was forced to escape from the Divine Land?

“Haha! Ridiculous, very ridiculous!”

His manic laughter mocked Jian Meng’er.

The scarlet-robed man was scornful of Jian Wushuang.

He was Fire Ghost, one of the 72 Marquises in the Divine Land.

He was famous for his evil, so he had the nickname, Evil Marquis. Of course, he was very powerful.

He was known as the number one marquis among the 72 Marquises. His battle strength was comparable to the Nine Sovereigns.

A marquis of his status would not care about an escapee who was hunted by numerous Skyscraping Realm experts.

“Idiots.”

Fire Ghost sneered as his laughter continued to reverberate.

There were many experts outside the Sword Marquis Mansion. Some of them came from the Alchemy School; some were from the Imperial House of the Tianzong Dynasty.

Their faces fell when they heard his laughter.

“I’ve heard of Evil Marquis. He is a supreme expert in the vast Divine Land. Now that he’s taken Sword Marquis Mansion as his target, it’s impossible for them to survive,” a white-haired elder said.

Upon hearing this, Wang Yan, Di Xi, and Hong Xuzi frowned.

Jian Wushuang had requested them to help him take care of Sword Marquis Mansion, and they had fulfilled their promises. However, even the white-haired elder who was at the Cloud Realm could do nothing against the Evil Marquis Fire Ghost. So what were they able to do?”

“As for Jian Wushuang, I’ve never heard of him in the Divine Land. I’m afraid that he is not very famous and might not be very powerful. Even if he returns, it would be impossible for him to fight the Evil Marquis.”

“In that case, there is nothing we can do?” Sect Master of the Alchemy School sighed as he shook his head.

Silence descended on the Drill Ground in Sword Marquis Mansion.

All the clansmen were in complete despair.

A tragic smile appeared on Jian Meng’er’s face.

She slowly took off her clothes, revealing her pink underwear.

“Go on!” Fire Ghost’s stared at the girl with evil eyes.

Jian Meng’er’s hands shivered slightly as she slowly stretched her fingers to the silk ribbon on her underwear. Just as she was about to take off her last piece of clothing, a figure suddenly appeared in front of her.

Jian Meng’er stopped.

She had been in a daze. Now, she felt a surge of hope.

“You finally came?” Jian Meng’er murmured.

Her clansmen who had felt hopeless brightened up when they saw the figure appear.

The grim Drill Ground was suddenly infused with vitality and hope.

Fire Ghost perceived the great change.

He was surprised that they were staring at something behind him, so he turned to have a look.

“What?”

Fire Ghost was shocked when he saw the figure in front of him.

He had not been aware that the man had stood behind him for a while.

“You, you...”

Fire Ghost stared at this man.

The man was dressed in a black robe and had a longsword on his back. His beautiful face shone with a flicker of coldness.

Overwhelming killing intent radiated from him.

Although it had not erupted, his killing intent was strong enough to shake Fire Ghost.

“If I’m right, you’re the Evil Marquis, the number one marquis in the Divine Land?” Jian Wushuang said in an icy voice.

He had hurriedly returned after being informed by Emperor Xiao that Sword Marquis Mansion was in trouble. Having witnessed the scene in front of him, he was absolutely furious.

He had rarely been as furious as this.

Sword Marquis Mansion was his root!

It was the place where he had been born and raised. His clansmen were his family.

Fire Ghost was trampling on his family!

His anger blazed.

“You are Jian Wushuang.” Fire Ghost recognized him. “You dare to come back?”

Jian Wushuang did not respond but glared at Fire Ghost. The next moment, his killing intent peaked and surged towards Fire Ghost with the force of a tsunami.

The terrifying killing intent which contained Slaughter Dao instantly oppressed Fire Ghost.

The force behind the attack felt like it came from a Skyscraping Realm expert.

Peng!

A huge pit suddenly appeared on the ground. Fire Ghost lay in the pit as the sound of breaking bones rang out in succession.
