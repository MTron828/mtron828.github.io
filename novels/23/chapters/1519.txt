“Under my Meteor Heavenly Hammer, he wasn’t injured at all?”

Universe God Liu Ying floated in the void as he looked at Jian Wushuang. He noticed that Jian Wushuang’s, who was crowned among the crimson sea of fire at that very moment, aura had grown even stronger than before.

“Kill!”

Among the crimson sea of fire, a ghostly figure soared up and eighteen shadows were cast simultaneously.

“Ten Thousand Shadows!”

Jian Wushuang wielded his sword at lightning speed. The sword lights crossed wantonly and flooded in to engulf Universe God Liu Ying.

“Haha, come on!”

Universe God Liu Ying let out a burst of hearty laughter and his aura started churning. The pair of huge silver hammers burst out silver light. Suddenly, it continuously bombarded him with attacks.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

As they fought in madness, there were countless shadows left in the void.

“Jian Wushuang’s speed and strength are much better than before?” Universe God Liu Ying’s pupils contracted.

Previously, when he was fighting against Jian Wushuang head on, they had been evenly matched. However, when Jian Wushuang had performed Scarlet Kingdom, he had felt the increase in pressure.

Especially in terms of martial art motion, Jian Wushuang was really one notch faster.

“Liu Ying, step aside!” There was suddenly a deep voice. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Universe God Liu Ying didn’t hesitate but retreated immediately from the silver flowing light.

Jian Wushaung quickly lifted his head and he instantly noticed Xin Zhu who had burst out a terrifying aura from afar.

“Jian Wushuang, try to take this!”

Xin Zhou’s face was distorted in agony. Before him, it was overcast with black fog. The entire heaven and earth were covered in boundless darkness.

The black fog was like widely-opened mouths that were going to swallow Jian Wushuang.

The coverage of the black fog was too huge and Jian Wushuang had no way to shake it off.

“Die!”

“Nine Weight Destruction!”

Rumble. A terrifying consciousness charged towards Jian Wushuang.

The consciousness attack was like a huge millstone that was crushing Jian Wushuang without any pattern.

Plus, there wasn’t only one millstone but there was a total of nine millstones and one was stronger than the others.

It was Xin Zhu’s strongest move, Nine Weight Destruction.

Jian Wushuang looked stony-faced and the huge dark tortoise had already surfaced. Then, one millstone after another hit his body.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The former eight attacks, Jian Wushuang had forcefully withstood them with his strong yet tenacious Soul Power.

In the ninth strike, which was the last strike, the most terrifying strike of consciousness crushed over.

“Ah!!!”

Jian Wushuang let out a shrill scream at the hit. He felt an unprecedented sharp pain in his Soul and it was as though his head was going to explode.

However, the sharp pain only continued for a short while before it subsided.

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the void but his face was red and his body was covered in sweat.

He lifted his head again after a good while. He then smirked coldly, “Xin Zhu, your consciousness attack is really scary but it’s a pity that it can’t kill me!”

Xin Zhu remained silent and his face grew grave, “I performed Nine Weight Destruction with my all. Even one with ordinary Real God’s consciousness strength would find it hard to withstand but Jian Wushuang withstood it forcefully. His consciousness is this strong?!”

But he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang’s consciousness couldn’t be actually considered as strong. It was merely capped at the limit of a Universe God. He had yet to reach Real God’s level.

However, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness had already transformed into Soul long ago and his Soul Power was at a much higher level and much more tenacious by a few folds compared to consciousness. His Soul Power was especially greater in terms of its tenacity.

Xin Zhu’s technique could kill an ordinary Real God’s consciousness but it couldn’t kill Jian Wushuang’s Soul which was only at the level of the limit of a Universe God.

“Xin Zhu, Universe God Liu Ying, what other techniques do you have? Use them all,” Jian Wushuang’s imposing manner had recovered to its peak again. His gaze was cold as he glanced.

Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying were standing side by side as their eyebrows tightly knitted.

“Liu Ying, I’ve performed my strongest unique skill but I still can’t kill him. How about you? Do you have any other techniques?” Xin Zhu asked.

“I do have it, but even if I perform it, it won’t kill him,” Universe God Liu Ying shook his head and replied.

“We’re in trouble.”

Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying went silent.

Just then…

Hong!

A terrifying roar suddenly burst into the void not too far away. At the same time, there were two bolts of earth-shattering power that spread.

The two bolts of power struck fear into both Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying.

Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying immediately looked towards the other side of the battlefield. Their pupils contracted the moment they saw the scene.

On the battlefield, Duan Lingfeng and Zi Dongwang had already separated. However, Zi Dongwang at that moment, his hair was messy, he looked pale and there was even blood at the corners of his lips. He was obviously in a fix. Duan Lingfeng, on the other hand…

His status was still at his peak and his aura was soaring into high sky. He was obviously in a better position than Zi Dongwang.

“Zi Dongwang, you who are on the second place on Universe God ranking list, your power is only at such level?” A cold voice was heard from Duan Lingfeng and it reverberated through the universe.

“Bastard!” Zi Dongwang clenched his teeth but he could do nothing about it.

Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying was at a loss for words.

The scene before them was obvious. In the earlier battle, the one at a disadvantage was Zi Dongwang!

But he was on the second place on Universe God ranking list.

“Xin Zhu, Liu Ying, they two of you joined forces but couldn’t kill Jian Wushuang?” Zi Dongwang noticed the outcome on the other side too and immediately reprimanded.

Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying exchanged a look. Both of them felt bitter in their hearts.

“Damn it!”

Zi Dongwang cursed and glared at Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng, “Let’s go!”

Zi Dongwang left directly while Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying didn’t stay either but left immediately.

Although the three of them had joined forces, they obviously couldn’t do anything about the teaming up of Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng. Hence, they could only leave.

As the three of them walked away, the shocking battle that had involved five Universe Gods in the top ten on Universe God ranking list finally ended.

“Jian Wushuang, are you okay?” Duan Lingfeng kept his saber and appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“I’m okay,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and said, “Duan Lingfeng, congratulations. You defeated Zi Dongwang. From the looks of it, on the latest Universe God ranking list that Vientiane tower just released, you could be in the second place.”

“I merely have the upper hand by a slight bit. If I really want to defeat him, I’m still a bit short,” Duan Lingfeng shook his head.

He was really stronger than Zi Dongwang but not by much.

“Regardless, thank you once again. I owe you one,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.
