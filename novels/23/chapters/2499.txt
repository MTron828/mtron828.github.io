Chapter 2500: Cultivate Life Armor

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Master Kun, when would you be able to help me cultivate the Life Armor?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Master Kun tried calming down and raised his head to meet Jian Wushuang’s eyes again. He inferred. “If I’m not wrong, your name isn’t Jian Yi, but Jian Wushuang, right?”

“Master Kun knows me?” Jian Wushuang kept a straight face.

“You’re indeed Master Jian Wushuang.”

Master Kun was startled and his tone became respectful. “Master Jian went to Saint’s Tomb and vanquished many genius disciples from various sects. Finally, you even single-handedly defeated the three Supreme Elders of the Great Compassion Sect. This news has spread across Wusha Wilderness. As for how I know it was Master Jian, the conditions and things Master Jian requested from the Great Compassion Sect were made known to the public. The things you have asked for were materials needed to cultivate the Life Armor.”

Now that Master Jian has come to me with these materials, it will naturally reveal Master Jian’s identity.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang thought it was logical.

“Master Jian, there will be no problem to cultivate a Life Armor since we now have enough instrument cultivation materials. I’ll start making preparations and begin three days later,” said Master Kun.

“I shall wait for three days then.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Master Kun soon left to make preparations.

Three days later, Jian Wushuang came to a huge underground chamber under the guidance of Master Kun.

The chamber was located at the bottom of a fire pit which was surrounded by frighteningly high temperature raging flames.

In the center of the chamber was a huge furnace.

The aura from the furnace was quite extraordinary. It was obviously a rare treasure.

“Master Jian, the cultivation process of the Life Armor is cumbersome. I’m afraid it’ll take more than ten days. As it’s my first time cultivating a Life Armor so the failure rate may be very high and I’ll need a longer time. A lot of materials would be damaged during the process,” explained Master Kun.

“I don’t care how long it’ll take and how many materials will be damaged. The materials I gave you should be sufficient for a few tries. It’s good enough as long as you can guarantee success in cultivating even just one Life Armor,” said Jian Wushuang.

Master Kun smiled. “Absolutely, there may be leftover materials too. By the way, I wonder if Master Jian has prepared the blood essences?”

There were three main conditions in cultivating a Life Armor—cultivation materials, a craftmaster, and blood essences from an expert that met the requirements.

“Didn’t you say that the blood essences of the expert must be absolutely strong? Mine should meet the requirements,” said Jian Wushuang.

Master Kun frowned. “Well...Master Jian might not know this, but the cultivator’s own blood essences are naturally the best choice, but its power may be influenced by the cultivator’s life rating. A cultivator’s life rating is usually inferior to the blood essences of powerful beasts or some special race experts. It would be better if Master Jian can prepare blood essences from powerful beasts or special race experts.”

“Of course, it doesn’t matter if Master Jian doesn’t have any of them. I have some with me and I can use it.”

Jian Wushuang smiled upon hearing that. “Master Kun, I don’t need the blood essences of a beast or a special race. Mine is good enough.”

Jian Wushuang was confident.

‘Life rating?’

‘What kind of beasts or special race experts can have a better life rating than myself?’

What a joke!

Who was Jian Wushuang? He was the second Perfect Chaotic Creature in the entire world.

His life rating was the best in the world and no one can be compared with his.

The Four Great Tribes who stood at the top of Ancient God Domain had excellent life ratings, but they were nothing compared to Jian Wushuang.

He was a Perfect Chaotic Creature. Why would he want to use blood essences of a beast or special race?

“If this is the case, then let’s go with it. However, if Master Jian’s blood essences do not meet the necessary requirements, Master Jian’s Life Armor will be of low level...” Master Kun was a little nervous.

“Don’t worry, there will be no problem with my blood essences,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Master Kun opened up the furnace and began the cultivation process.

Jian Wushuang was standing in the chamber and did nothing else other than closely watching Master Kun’s cultivation skills.

Instrument Cultivation skills were a profound knowledge. Jian Wushuang had not done much research into it, but he did not want to miss the scene where a Fourth-Grade Craftmaster cultivated a Life Armor.

Jian Wushuang watched Master Kun open the furnace before using a special method to draw extremely high-temperature liquid lava into the furnace and filling it up.

The liquid lava was no ordinary volcanic liquid lava. It was one that had existed for at least millions of years and with the highest temperature from its core.

It was collected by Master Kun at a great cost and especially used for instrument cultivation.

Next, Master Kun began throwing some materials into the furnace.

At first, Master Kun put in some Celestial Iron Ore and Spectacular Beast’s Scales into the furnace. Later on, he added one part of Red Sun Secret Essence and a stalk of Red Blood Fruit into the furnace. The Purple Shimmer was the only thing he did not put into the furnace.

Time passed very quickly and more than ten days had passed.

Over the past ten days, Jian Wushuang was closely watching the entire cultivation process.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang frowned. “Failure!”

An explosive sound came out of the furnace as those materials that had dissolved, integrated, and formed into the shape of a battle armor shot out of the furnace.

Those materials were no longer usable.

“Sigh!”

Master Kun sighed. He was not surprised as he had not expected to be successful on his first attempt.

He spent half a day restoring his divine power and physical state before Master Kun attempted it for the second time.

The second time was a lot more proficient than the first and the whole process was much faster.

Nonetheless, those materials were crushed into powder on the ninth day and the second attempt had also failed.

After his second failure, Master Kun was not discouraged at all. Instead, there was a gleam of determination in his eyes.

“So, this is how it is?”

Master Kun must have figured out a lot of things in his first two attempts. He was enthusiastic on the third try.

“Master Kun, are you confident with the next try?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Don’t worry, Master Jian. I’ve already figured out all the cultivation steps. I’m more than seventy percent sure on the third attempt.” Master Kun was very confident.
