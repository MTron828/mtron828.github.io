Chapter 1752: Removal

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In terms of Ultimate Divine Power, after Jian Wushuang had consumed nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas, the Ultimate Divine Power in him was already extremely close to completion.

There was only a very small part of divine power left. From Jian Wushuang’s viewpoint, he only needed to absorb all the demon cores that he got from Soaring Heaven King Palace and it should be sufficient.

By then, when his divine power had reached completion, he would be able to achieve the third stage of Ultimate Real God and his power would increase tremendously.

Then, he needed to rest in seclusion to recover from his injury. Besides, he needed to precipitate the six Ancient God stars again which would definitely require an extremely long time. During the process, he could absorb the demon cores to increase his divine power.

“Let’s begin,” Jian Wushuang let out a breath and started to meditate.

Just as Jian Wushuang was resting in seclusion…

In an extremely far away territory, on a large dark land, a cold, dark palace towered.

In the palace, a man in a black robe knelt politely. There were many statue-like soldiers in black armor that gave out cold auras around themselves.

“Jian Wushuang has already returned to Lineage of Star?” An ancient yet hoarse voice suddenly rang in the palace and the voice sounded like it was coming from all directions.

“Yes, someone saw that he entered Lineage of Star with the Master of Star Palace with the Master of Star Palace escorting him personally,” the man in a black robe said politely.

“Humph!” A cold humph suddenly spread.

“Roar!””Roar!””Roar!”

The soldiers in black armor in the palace let out angry roars simultaneously and their voices shook the earth.

“Such a meticulous plan that was said to be well-conceived didn’t kill Jian Wushuang? What do I need all of you for?”

The hoarse voice spread with boundless pressure. The man in a black robe who knelt down couldn’t help but shiver.

“How about Xue Gu? Mo Ying? Where are the few of them?” A hoarse voice asked.

“Master, besides when Jian Wushuang first fell into the trap and Emperor God Xue Gu sent a message, there was no other news from them. I continuously tried to get into contact with them but there was no reply until now,” the man in black robe replied.

The lofty palace was suddenly in silence.

Although Buddhist Demon Sea was dangerous, time and space wasn’t sealed off. Hence, they could still communicate with one another.

But then, Jian Wushuang had already returned to Lineage of Star and the people from Acheron Palace didn’t reply.

There was only one possibility….

“Dead!”

“Xue Gu, Mo Ying and the men that we’ve sent out have all died.”

The hoarse voice continued to speak but there wasn’t anger like before.

“Who is it? Who could kill them? Jian Wushuang?”

“Impossible. No matter how ridiculously strong Jian Wushuang is, he is only a Real God. His power is at most comparable to Real God Wu Bei’s. The five Sir Gods from Acheron Palace and even Emperor God Xue Gu himself, Jian Wushuang didn’t even stand much hope to stay alive, let alone killing Xue Gu, Mo Ying, and the others!”

“He definitely does not have the capability.”

“If it wasn’t him, who would it be? The Master of Star Palace?”

The owner of the hoarse voice reckoned that only the Master of Star Palace in Lineage of Star had the power to kill Emperor God Xue Gu and the five other Sir Gods.

“Master, according to our information, the Master of Star Palace had been meditating in seclusion. Before Jian Wushuang was assassinated, he never left to the Sixth Lair. It was impossible that he could reach it in time to save Jian Wushuang,” the man in a black robe who knelt down replied politely.

“If it wasn’t the Master of Star Palace, who would it be? Would it be any experts of Sanctuary Alliance who happened to be wandering in Buddhist Demon Sea? No way, I roughly know the locations of the top experts of Sanctuary Alliance. There wasn’t anyone in the Sixth Lair. If it wasn’t the experts of Sanctuary Alliance, the thing that caused their deaths would only be the natural danger in Buddhist Demon Sea or maybe… Some ancient existence in the depth of Buddhist Demon Sea got involved!”

“But why would the ancient existence suddenly be awakened?”

The owner of the hoarse voice muttered. Then, he let out a sigh after a long while. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Forget it. As the mission has failed, it is useless to look into it. Send down my command. Remove Jian Wushuang from the must-kill name list.”

“Remove Jian Wushuang from the must-kill name list?” The man in a black robe who knelt was stunned. “Master, will we not assassinate him in the future?”

“Five Sir Gods teamed up and set up the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts, plus an Emperor God who was extremely close to the top who performed and carried out a meticulously planned assassination. In the end, they hadn’t killed him but the whole army was wiped out. Regardless of the reason, it proved Jian Wushuang’s power. If we were to want to kill him again, we will have to at least send out the top of the top who is comparable to the Master of Star Palace, or even an Emperor God stronger than him.”

“And even so, it will not be definite. After all, there was an assassination. Jian Wushuang will definitely be more cautious. To be able to kill him, there is only one way, which is for the Great Emperor himself to kill him personally!”

“However, there are only two experts who are Great Emperor level in Acheron Palace and their identities are extremely unique. They definitely won’t take action to assassinate a genius of Sanctuary Alliance. In other words, we, Acheron Palace, have already missed the best timing to kill Jian Wushuang.”

“In the future, unless there is to be a fight against Sanctuary Alliance or a good opportunity, we shouldn’t try to assassinate him!”

The hoarse voice reverberated in the lofty palace. It didn’t go away for a very long time.

“Leave!”

“Yes.”

The man in the black robe immediately left.

In the lofty palace, the remaining cold soldiers in black armor continued to stand there like statues.

But suddenly, there was a creepy shadow that appeared on the uppermost throne from nowhere.

The person was in a white robe and his face was blurry.

“Jian Wushuang…” A faint voice was heard from the blurry shadow in a white robe. “You are extremely talented, far more talented than Real God Wu Bei. You could totally become an Almighty in the future and stand shoulder to shoulder with a Great Emperor. You might even stand a chance to reach the level of the strongest person in Sanctuary Alliance. If it was like before, we of Acheron Palace would definitely kill a top genius like you, regardless of the price we would have to pay.”

“But now, we can’t.”

“You should be glad that you were born in a great period. We of Acheron Palace have something more important to be done at this period. We have no time, nor money, nor energy to spare to take care of you. However, the period will pass. In no time, the period will pass.”

“In one hundred thousand years, at most!”

“Jian Wushuang, you have a hundred thousand years to grow. One hundred thousand years later, we of Acheron Palace will go all out. By then, even if you become Great Emperor, you’ll die, without a doubt!!!”

“Hahaha…”

The blurry shadow in a white robe let out a burst of strange laughter. It didn’t go away for a very long time in the lofty palace.
