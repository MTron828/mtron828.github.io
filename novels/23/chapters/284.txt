Chapter 285: Challenging the Protector

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?”

All the members of the ninth squad were furious.

“He did not even mention us?”

“Haha, he killed Shen Tianyu? That’s ridiculous. He did it by himself?”

“Bastard, how dare he claim the honor!”

“Shame on him!”

Tai Shan and the other teammates were indignant. Then they looked toward Jian Wushuang.

They did not really mind if Wu Jiu claimed the honor, because Shen Tianyu was not killed by them, but by Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman.” Gu Yan lowered his voice.

Jian Wushuang spoke with a faint smile. “I don’t care about how he claimed the honor and reward, but he didn’t mention my contribution. Does he really treat me as a fool?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression became cold.

He could not tolerate such bullying.

Obviously, Wu Jiu made a fool of them.

“Bloody Blade Team, gather!” A resonant voice sounded.

Jian Wushuang and the other teammates suddenly raised their heads.

“It’s Wu Jiu’s voice,” Tai Shan said.

“Come, let’s have a look.” Jian Wushuang moved forward.

In the vast Martial Arts Practice Field, Wu Jiu sat up straight in a chair, several jars of wine placed by his side.

The experts of the Bloody Blade Team stood in front of Wu Jiu.

Wu Jiu spoke with a flicker of joy in his eyes. “Today, we attacked Wing Gang and swept to victory. Everyone made a contribution. I decided to reward you with jars of Skyheart wine. You can have a drink.”

“Skyheart wine?”

“The legendary Skyheart wine?”

“It’s said that a small pot of Skyheart wine is worth more than 1,000 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. Such a huge jar equals 10 pots of it, that is to say, it should be worth 10,000 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.

Looking at the jars of nectar, the other experts began to swallow their saliva, except that the ninth squad sniffed at it.

“He claimed the honor. Our Sect Master must have given him a large reward. Now he wants to comfort us with several jars of wine.” Tai Shan sneered.

“How shrewd he is!” several teammates said in private.

Jian Wushuang shot Wu Jiu a glance and lifted up the corner of his mouth. Then he strode forward.

“Protector Wu Jiu.” Jian Wushuang spoke while standing opposite Wu Jiu.

“Hum, what’s the matter?” Wu Jiu still sat there and glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“I heard Protector is good at spear techniques and has killed 11 experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm within 15 minutes. Because of it, you entered the Bloodmoon List. I wonder whether you dare to have a fight with me?”

Jian Wushuang spoke so loud that all the experts heard it.

The word “dare” was full of deliberate provocation.

If Wu Jiu disagreed, the other experts would laugh at him in private and would say a Protector, the top expert on the Bloodmoon List, did not even dare to accept the challenge from an ordinary member of Bloody Blade Team.

“How smart Swordsman is!” Tai Shan and other teammates said with a smile.

The other experts of Bloody Blade Team looked at those two with a strange look.

“Protector Wu Jiu, dare he accept it?”

Wu Jiu’s face turned red with anger. He knew Jian Wushuang did this because he claimed the honor which belonged to their squad.

He snorted, “You want to fight with me? An overconfident idiot. OK, I’ll accept. But I need to remind you that I never show any mercy in a fight, which means I might kill you.”

“Haha, as long as I can fight with the top expert like you, I won’t care about my life,” Jian Wushuang said while laughing.

“Well.”

Wu Jiu slowly stood up, a strong aura soaring around his body.

“Accepted, accepted!”

“Protector Wu Jiu accepted his challenge.”

“It’s hard for Wu Jiu to refuse him. I don’t know what the boy is thinking. He dares to challenge Wu Jiu. He is looking for death.”

“Protector Wu Jiu has entered the Bloodmoon List for a long time and ranks high. Today he destroyed the Wing Gang and killed Shen Tianyu by himself. How powerful the Protector is! He must be comparable to a Half-saint expert.”

“Who is the boy? Doesn’t he overestimate himself?”

“I’ve never seen him before. He should have just joined our team.”

“I know him. He’s called Swordsman, who was brought by Bei Mu and Leng Yang. I hear both of them wanted to recommend him as Protector. It seems that he can’t be a Protector because his Cultivation is too low.”

Many experts began to talk about it.

They did not know of Jian Wushuang and looked at him with disdain.

However, the members of the ninth squad had seen Jian Wushuang’s real strength, so they felt confident about this fight.

“Hum, those people don’t know it is not Wu Jiu but Swordsman who killed Shen Tianyu.” Tai Shan sneered.

“Wu Jiu dared to accept. Just wait and see, he will regret this.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Swordsman, beat him.”

The other experts of the ninth squad roared in their hearts.

Jian Wushuang stood dozens of meters away from Wu Jiu, who held a long black spear.

“Swordsman, you’ve just arrived at the Tang Dynasty and just met a few experts. I’m afraid you’ve had fights with lesser experts, so you don’t know the experts on the Bloodmoon List well. Today, I’ll show you,” Wu Jiu said, with a contemptuous look.

“I am looking forward to it,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile. His Triple-kill Sword was already unsheathed.

“What a pity! Our Bloody Blade Team will lose an expert.”

After finishing his words, Wu Jiu suddenly pushed off with his right leg and dashed out like an arrow. In the blink of an eye, he jumped over a dozen meters and unleashed his long spear toward his opponent’s chest, with a harsh sound of piercing the air. It seemed as if a poisonous snake had stuck out its tongue.

“How fast!”

“Too fast!”

“That’s the strength of experts on the Bloodmoon List. We’re all at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, but none of us can hold a candle to Wu Jiu.”

The other experts of Bloody Blade Team could not help but sigh.

Faced with the stroke, Jian Wushuang just gave a faint smile.
