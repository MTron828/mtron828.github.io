Chapter 1398: Challenging Illusionary Mind Sea

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Illusionary Mind Sea was a training ground that could be tied with Star Tower in Lineage of Star. The difference was that Star Tower focused on unique skill and killing techniques while Illusionary Mind Sea focused on consciousness.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the Lineage of Star for so many years, he had been to Star Tower many times but it was his first visit to the Illusionary Mind Sea.

There was a total of thirty floors in Illusionary Mind Sea!

On the first floor, Jian Wushuang saw a boundless crimson ocean.

In the crimson ocean, there was an enormous amount of scarlet sea water raging with anger. There was a unique force flowing over from all directions simultaneously.

“When I was in Long Gang Mystery Land, I let my Soul Power remain at its most relaxed state so that I could be at ease entirely. Illusionary Mind Sea could let my Soul Power tense up again. The looseness and the tension is the only chance for me to break through the bottleneck!”

“Thirty floors of Illusionary Mind Sea, let’s see how far I can go!”

There were shocking lights surging in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. His figure sped off like lightning and ignored the phantasmagoria on the first floor but came before the second crimson ocean, which was the second floor of Illusionary Mind Sea.

The phantasmagoria swept towards him from all directions.

“Phantasmagoria of such a level won’t affect me at all.”

Jian Wushuang’s footsteps didn’t slow down at all but he continuously passed through the first floor, the second floor, the third floor… He didn’t even slow down when he got to the tenth floor. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At the thirteenth floor, Jian Wushuang finally slowed down slightly. However, he was still rather fast.

He also passed through the thirteenth and fourteenth floor easily.

On the fifteenth floor, he paused for a while but continued to pass through.

On the sixteenth floor, it was extremely pressuring for him. He put in all his effort and bellowed madly. He then finally shook off the phantasmagoria.

The seventeenth floor…

“This is…?” Jian Wushuang looked at his surrounding.

Rumble. The terrifying rumble reverberated in the entire battlefield. The extremely huge fortress shattered entirely and there were dead bodies all over. A large number of experts were on a rampage.

“Haha, kill, kill everyone in this realm!”

“Merely a Green Fire World, how dare you dream of occupying such a treasure! You’re asking for it!”

“Don’t let anyone go.”

A large number of Universe Gods, Real Gods, even Almighty were rampaging across the battlefield. They were killing all the cultivators of Green Fire World.

The entire Green Fire World shattered.

“Sh*t, my Green Fire World is doomed!”

“No!”

Pathetic groans and wails were heard from every corner.

Jian Wushuang was in the middle of the battlefield.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Emperor Tang ran before Jian Wushuang with his hair in disarray. He shouted with rage, “You brought a bunch of experts to Green Fire World? You betrayer!”

“Jian Wushuang, it’s your fault. You attracted all these experts here. Our Green Fire World was destroyed because of you!”

“Jian Wushuang, you’re the one to blame for what happened to Green Fire World!”

Countless roars reverberated in the universe.

Jian Wushuang clenched tightly!

“Phantasmagoria!”

“This is fake!”

“No matter how realistic the scene is, fake will always be fake!”

“It’s merely phantasmagoria. Don’t think of affecting me. Break!”

Jian Wushuang flushed and his face was distorted in agony. He looked terrifyingly ferocious and his eyes were twinkling with unprecedented madness.

In his sea of consciousness, his lit Soul Power started vibrated crazily.

Under such madness, the Soul Power in his sea of consciousness also vibrated vigorously. The surrounding images started quivering vigorously and trembling in the balance too.

“Just a little bit more, just slightly more!”

“Break!” Break!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed. His fingertips dug deep into his flesh and he started bleeding.

Suddenly… Rumble!

His sea of consciousness quivered and Jian Wushuang suddenly trembled. The surrounding images collapsed entirely.

On the seventeenth floor of Illusionary Mind Sea, on the billowing crimson ocean, Jian Wushuang stood. His body was covered with sweat and he was panting with his head hung low. He looked like he was having a fit.

However, even so, there was happiness in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“I broke through!”

“I really broke through!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and his entire body shivered in excitement.

Ninety years ago, he had seen that the strength of his Soul Power remained on the level of an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven and couldn’t breakthrough, and he had been thinking of a way.

For ninety years in Long Gang Mystery Land, he had intentionally let his Soul Power remain at its most relaxed state and he had never once triggered his Soul Power.

Nine years of relaxation and he had came to Illusionary Mind Sea right before the battle to be a disciple of Star Palace, then utilized the phantasmagoria in Illusionary Mind Sea to stimulate his Soul Power that was relaxing all this while so that his Soul Power would suddenly tense up.

Such strong stimulation after relaxation, there was a possibility that his Soul Power would breakthrough!

Jian Wushuang was merely making an attempt. Who knew it would really work!

The strength of his Soul Power had already broken through and he had reached the level of Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven.

His ability was enhanced tremendously with the breakthrough!

“Jian Wushuang, you have guts. Although your Soul Power might breakthrough under such strong stimulation, it could also severely damage your soul, or even affect your Soul Fire. Fortunately, you’re lucky and you broke through. Otherwise…” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang was glad.

King of Venomous Worms knew what he thought and he told him about the risks.

He was really lucky.

“Regardless, it’s the best to be able to break through the bottleneck of Soul Power before the battle to be a disciple of Star Palace.” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and he was overjoyed.

Then, Jian Wushuang naturally continued to the eighteenth floor of the Illusionary Mind Sea.

As he had just broken through on the seventeenth floor, his endurance for phantasmagoria was naturally stronger. The eighteenth floor couldn’t threaten him.

He passed through the eighteenth floor. As for the nineteenth floor, he passed through it.

But on the twentieth floor, Jian Wushuang reckoned the strength of phantasmagoria would affect any ordinary Real God too. He naturally couldn’t resist it. In the end, he stopped at the twentieth floor.

In the depth of Illusionary Sea Mind, on the hillock at the border of the thirtieth sea region, there was an elegant elderly with crimson long hair seated. The elegant elderly was a deacon elderly who was in charge of taking care of the Illusionary Mind Sea.

“Huh?”

The elegant elderly who was originally drinking alone suddenly raised his head and looked into the distance with his lightning-like eyes.
