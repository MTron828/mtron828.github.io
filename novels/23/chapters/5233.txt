“Phew! ”

Jian Wushuang was about to give up. There were too many people around, and he didn’t dare to make too much noise.

Just as he was about to retract his Thought power, that strand of Sword Intent unexpectedly drilled out on its own. Jian Wushuang was ecstatic; he quickly enveloped it with his Thought power, enduring the erosion of that Sword

Intent.

Luckily, he cultivated the Ultimate Sword Dao. Although there was still resistance, he could withstand it. However, Jian Wushuang didn’t underestimate this strand of Sword Intent; despite its small size, it was more than enough to cut him into pieces.

With careful wrapping, he slowly retreated from the ravine. After his illusory arm emerged from the ravine, he clearly felt the weakening of that strand of Sword Intent. Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and directly devoured it.

His illusory arm opened its fingers, devouring that strand of Sword Intent. All of this happened within the confines of the barrier, so people outside couldn’t notice a thing.

Feeling the enhancement in his Ultimate Sword Dao, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes. The origin source Sword Dao within the Sword Intent, he instantly grasped, after all, it had already merged within him.

“Cage!” Jian Wushuangs Yan power trembled slightly, evaporating the sweat on his body.

He had grasped this from a strand of Sword Intent.

Unfortunately, it was too little. If there was a bit more, his Ultimate Sword Dao might have broken through.

Taking a deep breath, he tried to get up, only to find Hu Qing and Ji Chaoyang beside him.

“Wushuang, have you discovered something?” Ji Chaoyang asked curiously.

Like everyone else, they could only comprehend some ravines that suited them. However, the insights gained were very few, considered a rare cultivation sanctuary, much stronger than the outside world but they couldn’t stay here for long. They could only scan the area briefly, look through all the ravines, and their gains depended on their abilities. It wasn’t the time for secluded cultivation here.

“Just some minor gains. There’s a ravine here left by a powerful swordsman that’s quite helpful to me!” Jian Wushuang nodded, although he didn’t reveal the full truth, what he said wasn’t entirely wrong.

Indeed, this was a sword mark left behind by a powerful swordsman. His gains were quite good, at least it helped him find a breakthrough direction.

Ji Chaoyang felt somewhat disappointed, thinking Jian Wushuang had discovered something special, but now it seemed no different from others.

On the second day of their arrival, the Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing also descended outside Qiuhuang City.

Like them, the Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing first glanced at the archway on the city gate, then walked around and found a place to sit down, cross-legged, contemplating the traces on the city wall.

When he sat down, he glanced at Jian Wushuangs direction.

Jian Wushuang was meticulously studying the Sword Dao and paid no attention. Ji Chaoyang, on the other hand, shrank his neck and hid behind Hu Qing.

“Virtuous!” The fighting spirit of Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing, Hu Qing understood in his heart that they couldn’t avoid it forever.

Fortunately, the other party also knew that it wasn’t the time to start a war yet.

Everything outside couldn’t disturb Jian Wushuang’s obsession with the Sword Dao. In his origin, his avatar sat cross-legged in the ocean of origin source, practicing diligently.

“No, this path won’t work!”

The figure resembling Jian Wushuang shook his head. He had already deduced tens of thousands of sword techniques, yet he couldn’t find a path to break through.

The origin source Great Dao underwent a qualitative change every three levels. Crossing into the seventh level was exponentially more difficult than the previous breakthroughs. The first two breakthroughs happened naturally through his Heart power. Now, attempting to break through without relying on his Heart power seemed impossible—a task akin to reaching the heavens. He was utterly clueless.

Countless thoughts surged through his mind. A glimmer of realization flashed across Jian Wushuangs eyes. His eyes opened wide, and the thoughts in his mind instantly dissipated.

He had been pondering the Sword Intent within the sword marks. There were so many marks on the city wall; there might be other sword marks. If the

Sword Intent was present in one set of marks, it should exist in the others too.

Smack!

Jian Wushuang slapped his thigh and stood up abruptly. He moved incredibly fast and flew toward other areas.

Indeed, there were more sword marks in other places. He had been too excited earlier and had forgotten about this aspect.

Just like the last time, he transformed his Thought power into an illusory arm, entered the barrier, touched the sword marks, and delved deep inside to search for Sword Intent.

In his Sword Dao origin source, there was a trace of Sword Intent origin

source. wnen tne residual sword Intent encountered tne Illusory arm formed by Jian Wushuangs Thought power, they thought it was one of their kind and willingly approached him.

This delighted Jian Wushuang. He effortlessly gained a thread of Sword Intent origin source. Instead of rushing to comprehend it, he cautiously explored each ravine, collecting strands of Sword Intent origin sources one after another.

Qiuhuang City, stretching millions of miles in length and width, had city walls extending for millions of miles. The countless grooves on the walls amounted to tens of millions. Fortunately, the more Sword Intent origin source he devoured, the easier it became to collect. So he started methodically searching for Sword Intent origin source, step by step, around Qiuhuang City.

His actions were soon noticed by other strong individuals. After all, Jian Wushuang was now a prominent figure, a Dao Lord-level expert. Every move he made drew attention from others.

They began by quietly following Jian Wushuang, carefully observing the places where he stopped and pondered. They discovered traces of Sword Intent, but it was of no use to them. Even Grand Yan Immortals who cultivated the Sword Dao origin source did not sense anything amiss in those places.

Soon, the group dispersed, leaving Jian Wushuang alone to sweep away the sword marks.

One day passed, then two, until a month later when Jian Wushuang finally swept all the sword marks.

“I’ve hit the jackpot this time!” Jian Wushuang licked his lips, his eyes gleaming.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Millions of Sword Intents, condensed to be no less than a complete Dao.

Jian Wushuang found an empty space, sat cross-legged, and the million Sword Intents surged in his origin source sea. The tiny figure he transformed into stood within, roaring, “Merge!’

Countless swallowed sword dao origin sources began to fuse.

The powerful Sword Intent made Jian Wushuang ecstatic.

“It’s a sword!”

In the end, the Sword Intent condensed into an illusionary long sword. Jian Wushuangs mind stirred, and he perceived a figure in the sword, clad in white like snow.

An ancient aura emanated from his body, making Jian Wushuangs eyes narrow.

The figure held a sword, standing outside a great city. According to Jian Wushuangs speculation, it should be Qiuhuang City.

Swish!

The white-clad Sword God struck with a sword, yet there was no sharpness in the Sword Intent, no overwhelming means to break everything. However, when it fell within Qiuhuang City, it turned into a prison. The sword light transformed into a spherical cage enveloped by Sword Intent.

Jian Wushuang observed carefully and realized the move was not as simple as it seemed. With one sword strike, the entire Qiuhuang City was enveloped. Although it appeared gentle, it erupted with billions of sword lights internally, instantly destroying Qiuhuang City. The white-clad figure didn’t even spare a glance at the city; his figure turned into a stream of light and disappeared in an instant..
