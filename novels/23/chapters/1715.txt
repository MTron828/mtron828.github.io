Chapter 1716: Team Up?

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Sword Emperor?” Di Lei was surprised.

Not only was he famous in Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, but he also wandered in the surrounding sixteen Holy Kingdoms. Hence, he was familiar with the experts in the sixteen Holy Kingdoms, but he had never heard of Sword Emperor.

“Maybe he is an expert from outside of sixteen Holy Kingdoms,” Di Lei thought to himself. Then, he asked with a smile, “May I take a seat?”

“Go ahead,” Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse.

Di Lei sat down opposite Jian Wushuang, “You should be here for the nine Taiqing Ancient Panacea in He Xiu’s hands, right?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang didn’t deny it.

It was useless to deny it. As he was already in You Ming Mountain, he definitely came for Taiqing Ancient Panacea.

“It’s a pity that although Taiqing Ancient Panacea is impressive, it is useless for us Real Gods. Plus, no matter who gets the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas in the end, they have to give it to Mister Liu Yin. What we could get at most are rewards from Mister Liu Yin,” Di Lei said.

“Why is that?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“You didn’t know?” Di Lei looked at Jian Wushuang curiously and said, “No matter if it’s Holy Kingdom of Zhen Wu that we are in now, or the surrounding sixteen Holy Kingdoms, they are under the control of Mister Liu Yin. Treasures like Taiqing Ancient Panacea aren’t something we Real Gods can have. Mister Liu Yin spread words long ago. Whoever passes him the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas will receive a great reward from him.”

“That’s a reward from an Almighty.”

There was passion in Di Lei’s eyes.

Taiqing Ancient Panacea contained divine power which was too enormous an amount. To Sir God or Emperor God, it was extremely useful, but it would be a waste for a Real God to consume a Taiqing Ancient Panacea.

Regardless of if it was expert in Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu or experts attracted from the surrounding sixteen Holy Kingdoms, even if they retrieved Taiqing Ancient Panacea, they would only offer it to Sir God Liu Yin in exchange for treasure.

Even so, it was enough to make countless experts go crazy.

“Sir God Liu Yin doesn’t look for He Xiu himself but used the experts from the sixteen Holy Kingdoms under his control to look for him. He only spread a message and there would be people sending him the Taiqing Ancient Panacea. He is a very wise man,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Do you know how many experts came to You Ming Mountain to fight for Taiqing Ancient Panacea?” Di Lei asked again.

“No idea,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Many. So many that it is beyond your imagination. Not only the experts in Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu and the surrounding sixteen Holy Kingdoms, but also many experts from the sixteen Holy Kingdoms rushed over. If all of them are added up, the number of Real God is unknown. Even the number of Chaotic Real God is… many,” Di Lei said and there was astonishment in his eyes.

“There are so many experts. When He Xiu is found, there would definitely be a fierce fight. I reckon there should be a number of passing rate, even if they are Chaotic Real Gods.

“Maybe,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but he couldn’t be bothered.

Real God… so what if there are many of them?

Then, Di Lei seemed to find that it was an opportunity and he finally explained his purpose in coming, “Although you are extremely strong and you couldn’t even be bothered with Ling Family, you are all alone after all. If they were to start a fight, you would not have enough manpower. The Taiqing Ancient Panacea wouldn’t fall into your hands. Why not you team up with us?”

“You?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Di Lei, “Besides you, who else?”

“There are the other four experts from the sixteen Holy Kingdoms. One of them is a Chaotic Real God, the other two are peak Eternal Real Gods. With you, our team would be even stronger. By then, even if we were to come across the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, we wouldn’t have to be afraid,” Di Lei smiled.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang smiled but then he shook his head, “I’m sorry. I prefer to be solo. I’m not used to teaming up.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Di Lei’s face grew dim, “You should reconsider this carefully. Although you are powerful and you could even fight against a Chaotic Real God alone, there are many that could kill you during the fight later on.”

“I don’t know if there’s anyone who could kill me but I don’t like to team up with others,” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold.

Di Lei didn’t bother to convince him. “Well, good luck.”

Watching Di Lei leave, Jian Wushuang continued to drink by himself as he smiled faintly.

Di Lei might be sincerely asking for him to team up and what he had said was reasonable. If Jian Wushuang was only an ordinary Chaotic Real God, he would only stand a higher chance to get Taiqing Ancient Panacea if he were to team up with Di Lei.

However, Di Lei didn’t know Jian Wushuang’s true power.

In the fight for Taiqing Ancient Panacea, Jian Wushuang was only concerned about Sir God Liu Yun. As for the other Real Gods, he couldn’t be bothered.

With his power, did he need to team up with anyone?

After he talked to Di Lei, Jian Wushuang thought highly of Sir God Liu Yin’s method of doing things.

If he was not mistaken, he reckoned that all the You Ming Pubs in You Ming Mountain should be operating under the command of Sir God Liu Yin. The information provided to the cultivators in You Ming Mountain by the pub for the cultivators to look for He Xiu’s whereabouts.

While Sir God Liu Yin himself sat on the fishing terrace, he controlled everything in his hands.

Regardless of who got the Taiqing Ancient Panacea in the end, they would send it to him.

The only thing that he needed to do was pay some rewards.

If the fight for Taiqing Ancient Panacea was really just among a bunch of ordinary Real God, even the top Chaotic Real God couldn’t run from Sir God Liu Yin’s control.

It was a pity that Sir God Liu Yin definitely didn’t think that Jian Wushuang would come by.

The rest of the time, Jian Wushuang continued to stay in the pub as he waited in silence.

He wasn’t interested in looking for He Xiu’s whereabouts over hill and dale like the other cultivators. He knew that there were so many people who couldn’t find He Xiu over ten years. He didn’t think he would be so lucky to find He Xiu all by himself.

Plus, once He Xiu was found, unless the person was killed, there would be a slight bit of news leaked, and You Ming Pub would announce it to the public. Then, Jian Wushuang could also instantly know his location and head over to find him, which would be much easier.

As for Ling Family… when they find out Jian Wushuang had killed Ling Yan, the higher-ups in Ling Family were pissed off but they also knew that Jian Wushuang was an expert who likely could be compared favorably with a Chaotic Real God. Plus, their main focus was to look for He Xiu. They wouldn’t come to make trouble with Jian Wushuang in the near future.
