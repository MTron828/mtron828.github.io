“None of the nine Universe Gods in the First Heaven, including me, is good at conscious attacks, and Jian Wushuang, whether powerful or not, can help us a lot!” Long Hao said.

“Then, Jian Wushuang, you should make a full preparation in the next three months and join in the Ranked Battle with Long Hao. Don’t lose the battle!” Deacon Green said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Jian Wushuang, we can communicate frequently together to enhance mutual understanding so that you can cooperate well in the battle.” Long Hao said to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang also nodded.

Other talents went back when they knew who the last permission for the battle belonged to.

And Wu Chao left with Dong Ao disappointedly.

Jian Wushuang and Lord Wu Cang also went back.

“Jian Wushuang, you always keep a low profile about your power.” Lord Wu Cang said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I won’t stay in the Snow Dojo for too long and I just have to get what I want. It is unnecessary for me to display what I really have,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“That’s good, but please make full efforts in the battle. After all, Universe Gods in the Snow Dojo still lag behind those in the Universe God Palace. If you don’t give a hand, we will definitely lose,” Lord Wu Cang said embarrassedly.

“Yes, I know how to manage it.”

“Good.” And Lord Wu Cang didn’t continue.

In the next three months, Jian Wushuang attended the training with other battle participants and exchanged ideas with them.

When someone invited him to battle together, he seldom refused but he never showed his true power.

He had always kept a low profile in the Snow Dojo.

One of the reasons was that he didn’t want leaders in the Snow Dojo to know his power and keep him in the Dojo.

Three months soon passed and the Ranked Battle began.

The battle between the Snow Dojo and the Universe God Palace, the two well-known genius concentration camps, was certainly attractive.

The boundless battlefield was crowded with numerous talents.

Many privileged and powerful families and tribes had all come here to watch the battle.

There were two thrones at the grandstand of the battlefield, on which two gods sat.

One of them was an elderly god with a red robe and red hair. He was calm but awesome, as if he could burn everything in the heaven.

The other one was with short black hair and a cool face, with eyes gleaming with black light. Whoever sat beside him felt as if he was also in the middle of a black hole.

“So horrible!”

“So awesome they are!”

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked by their presence.

“Their aura is much stronger than the Universe Gods. So I guess…They have already surpassed the level of Universe Gods.” Jian Wushuang said quietly.

“Exactly,” King of Venomous Worms in Jian Wushuang’s body said, “They have already surpassed the level of Universe Gods and reached a brand new level, which belongs to the Eternal Chaotic World. They are the real experts in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, though they are still not the top ones and far less powerful than King Luo Zhen and the creator of the Lineage of Star.”

“But they are still powerful enough to kill me easily.” Jian Wushuang said with self-mockery.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Lord Wu Cang pointed at the elderly man with the strong aura like black holes and said, “He is Master of Silence Gloriette and only he knows the route to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

On the grandstand, Master of Silence Gloriette was chatting with the red-haired Elderly.

“I think it is no longer necessary to hold the Ranked Battle if you guys lose again this time. We have won five times consecutively and you guys are too weak to be opponents,” the red-haired Elderly said indifferently.

Master of Silence Gloriette snorted, “Nonsense! We will be the winners this time!”

“You seem confident,” the red-haired Elderly smiled.

“Of course.”

“But you were also confident last time, but your Snow Dojo won nothing in the last three rounds!” The taunt from the red-haired Elderly was obvious.

Master of Silence Gloriette got angry, “If we don’t win this time, I will kill all the Golden Deacons!” and he glanced at Deacon Green on his side, “Go and bring all the Golden Deacons here.”

“Yes, my Majesty.” Deacon Green followed his order.

“Jian Wushuang, Master of Silence Gloriette asks us to go there. So just follow Long Hao and make a good preparation.” Lord Wu Cang said.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The highly anticipated Ranked Battle was around the corner.

The first round of the battle was between the most powerful talents, Universe Gods of the Third Heaven.

Ten participants from each team all went to the center of the battle field.

There was a huge wormhole in the center.

“Begin!”

As Master of Silence Gloriette announced the battle starting, the Universe Gods of the Third Heaven from both the Snow Dojo and Universe God Palace all went into the wormhole.
