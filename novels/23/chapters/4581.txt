4583 The God Is Dead, the Devil Is Destroyed

Within the quiet passageway of the Land of Sorrows.

Thank you readers!

Dozens of Cosmic Boats were cruising forward quietly.

In this boundless absolute darkness, even the rumbling sound of the engine was swallowed up.

“Palace Master, the other disciples have not found anything unusual.”

The Xue Bo Supreme cupped his hands and replied.

Jian Wushuang nodded. Just as he was about to ask Xue Bo to pay more attention…

“Ah-!!!”

A shrill scream suddenly exploded from the space fleet behind them!

In this dark and silent tunnel, this scream was extremely abrupt.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed instantly. With a flash of his body, he plunged toward the Cosmic Boat behind him.

Supreme Xue Bo and the others exchanged a glance, and their expressions turned extremely ugly. They hurriedly followed after him.

A moment later, in the cabin of the ninth Cosmic Boat, Jian Wushuang saw the female disciple who had screamed.

The female disciple’s body was shaking, her shoulders were shaking, and her face was pale. She pointed at the glass window on the universe cabin and said in a frightened tone, “P-Palace Master, there are people outside!”

“Someone’s there?”

Jian Wushuang focused his gaze, but it was dark outside the glass.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

“Tell me about the situation just now.” Jian Wushuang said expressionlessly.

“Okay.” A look of reminiscence flashed across the female disciple’s face as she began to narrate.

The matter was simple.

Not long ago, this female disciple whose name was Su Yang was sitting cross-legged in the cabin cultivating.

When she was cultivating, she encountered a bottleneck, so she wanted to ask the disciples whose cultivation levels were higher than hers and give them some guidance.

In the end, she saw a scene that she would never forget for the rest of her life!

On the glass window, a livid face was stuck to the window, and its eyes, which were like rotten grapes, were staring straight at her!

Because his face was too close, his entire facial features were distorted and terrifying!

It was also this face that suddenly appeared that made her so scared that she fell on her butt and screamed.

After the female disciple finished speaking, her face still had an expression of shock.

“I got it.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was not good.

Ghosts playing pranks?

They were not ordinary mortals. They were Supreme realm experts who stood at the peak of this universe!

In their eyes, demons and ghosts were simply insignificant ants.

“Palace Master Wushuang, please come over for a moment. I have something to tell you.”

At this moment, Lan Lan, who had been silent the entire time, suddenly spoke.

“What?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and followed Lan Lan out of the cabin.

The two of them walked to the deck. Jian Wushuang stood with his hands behind his back and said, “Miss Lan Lan, if you have anything to say, just say it.”

Lan Lan nodded and did not continue speaking. Instead, she looked into the distance as if she was reminiscing about something. After a long while, her expression gradually became serious. “Jian Wushuang, do you know what our universe was like before it was created?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was stunned. He really did not know anything about the things that happened before the universe was created.

“I’ve heard the details.”

Jian Wushuang extended his hand and made a gesture of invitation.

“My Master once guessed that our universe is just a reincarnation cycle.”

“Reincarnation?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“That’s right.” Lan Lan let out a deep breath and said, “It’s reincarnation. According to my Master’s conjecture, before our civilization was born, there might have been other civilizations in this universe.”

“However, for some unknown reason, this civilization was completely destroyed, and the universe returned to chaos.”

“After another long time, the universe would restart, giving birth to new life and a new civilization.”

“This is our current civilization.”

Jian Wushuang frowned. What Lan Lan said was not impossible.

He believed that the conjectures of Cosmos God were not baseless.

“My Master used to come here to explore the two Forbidden Zones. Unfortunately, he didn’t tell us anything about this experience. He would only mention it sometimes.”

“According to my Master, there seems to be a body of a Supreme being buried in the Imperial Ancestor Ruins Forbidden Zone. Even he can’t see through it. This body is even older than our universe.”

“And this Land of Sorrows, according to what Master mentioned, seems to be the place where the last universe era fell.”

“Jian Wushuang, if the Land of Sorrowss is really the place where the last universe era fell as my Master said, then there must be countless figures from the last universe era who were buried here…”

Lan Lan had not finished her words.

Suddenly, a strange singing voice came from the quiet passage.

“The God is dead… the devil is destroyed… everything shall return to nothingness.”

“The heavens crumbled, weeping alone outside the world…”

This song sounded like the cries of countless gods and demons. It was faint and ethereal.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang looked up.

However, before Jian Wushuang could use his divine power to see what was going on, he suddenly felt a sense of sorrow. A sense of profound sadness surged in his heart.

It was the sorrow of the vicissitudes of life, the despair of all hope, the sorrow of being alone and helpless.

It was just a song, but under this sorrowful stubbornness, Jian Wushuang could not help but feel a lump in his throat.

Drip.

It was the sound of water dripping on the deck.

Jian Wushuang turned his head and saw Lan Lan looking up at the starry sky in a daze. He did not know when she had started crying.

“Miss Lan Lan?”

Jian Wushuang suppressed the sorrow that wanted to destroy him and tried to call Lan Lan.

However, Lan Lan seemed to be in a daze and did not notice at all.

Jian Wushuang felt that his face was wet. He reached out to wipe it and found that his face was also covered with tears.

He could feel that this sorrow seemed to have transformed into a pair of large hands that clutched his neck tightly, trying to drag him into a place of eternal damnation.

“Stop messing with me!”

Jian Wushuang bit the tip of his tongue tightly. In an instant, the slight pain from the tip of his tongue made him slightly more awake.

Enduring the discomfort, Jian Wushuang stepped into the cabin.

Everyone in the cabin, including Supreme Xue Bo, Supreme Jun Fu, Ninth Kalpa King, the ordinary disciples, and even Leng Rushuang, stood in the cabin in a daze.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists. Then, he could no longer resist the sadness. His vision turned black as if he had fallen into a boundless abyss.

The long and quiet passage in the Land of Sorrows returned to a dead silence. Only the singing that sounded like the weeping of gods and demons and the low chuckling of a voice could be heard. It sounded strange and eerie.
