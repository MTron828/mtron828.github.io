Chapter 5365 - 5365: Nine Levels of the Divine Body

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Upon hearing this offer, not only was Jian Wushuang dumbfounded, but many powerful figures in the hall also narrowed their eyes. It hadn’t been long since the bidding began, and the price had already skyrocketed to this extent. Would there be any chance for them to make a move later?

Many peak tier 4 Emperors, with only that much worth, couldn’t compare to those sects and clans.

“300 million?”

Jian Wushuang also felt that these people were insane; for a moment, he dared not make another bid.

However, at this moment, Bai Junwang spoke up, “Add another 100 million.

Those sects are even more stingy than independent cultivators!”

“400 million!”

“Who told you that?”

“In my time, I was the ancestor of the Bai family!”

Upon hearing this statement, Jian Wushuang had nothing more to say. Experience-wise, he couldn’t compete.

On second thought, what Bai Junwang said made sense.

Families and sects were not individuals; they were a collective. They wouldn’t recklessly raise the bid.

Sure enough, after he bid four billion, no one else increased the price.

What surprised Jian Wushuang, however, was that this Heavenly Demon Art was just a basic version.

No wonder the starting price was so low.

Apart from being useful for breaking through the 20,000-fold divine body, the Dragon Serpent Wine was also the primary enhancement material for after the 20,000-fold divine body.

The divine body was roughly divided into nine layers, similar to the origin source Dao.

Each layer consisted of 10,000-fold divine body.

Currently, he hadn’t even broken through the first layer.

The treasures needed for the first layer were the cheapest and simplest.

The total cost would not exceed 100 million.

But the second layer would increase 10-fold, and the third layer was considered the peak of the early stages, also the pinnacle for many cultivators in their lifetime.

Even so, the expenditure was on the level of tens of billions.

No wonder the divine body cultivation path, claiming to have no significant threshold, yet its most significant hurdle is the treasures themselves.

For the scions of major clans, there is the backing of their family.

But for lone cultivators, they have to rely entirely on themselves.

Many tier 3 Emperors, even after a lifetime of struggle, only achieve a divine body power of 7,000 or 8,000.

Just like Xia Mang Guanyu, with his privileged status, he reached a divine body power of 8,000-fold when he was still a Dao Lord.

His opportunities were not lacking, but even now, he just barely reached 10,000-fold.

After obtaining the Heavenly Demon Technique or Art, countless avatars emerged within him. Seated on the origin source pillar, he began his research.

With the assistance of the formidable divine body expert, Bai Junwang, progress was swift, and within at most a thousand years, he could ascend to the Mahayana stage.

Countless avatars comprehended, increasing the efficiency by a thousandfold. This means that within a year, he could reach the level of Daoist Liyang and unleash the Six-Arm Heavenly Demon Form.

It’s worth noting that Xia Mang Guanyu, with only a Four-Arm HeavenlyDemon Form, could only be considered to be in the minor attainment realm.

Even in the minor attainment realm, it allowed him to boost his divine body to a 1,000-fold, an additional 2,000-fold on the foundation.

Once his basic divine body broke through 1,000-fold, coupled with the extravagant use of treasures and the unleashing of the Six-Arm Heavenly

Demon Form, it’s likely his divine body could soar straight to 20,000-fold.

The next item up for auction is a supreme treasure, but Jian Wushuang shows no interest and simply observes the unfolding events.

Most of them are composite supreme treasures.

For instance, a necklace with 108 pillars, crafted from stars. Each pillar is a supreme treasure, and when united, their combined power surpasses even some Eternal Treasures designed for defense.

The treasures on display were exceptionally suitable for tier 4 Emperors, but the starting prices were outrageously high. With a base price of 80 million, many tier 4 Emperors were discouraged.

The remaining items attracted those with profound backgrounds. The final transaction price settled at a staggering 140 million.

Quite worthwhile!

“Alright, now let’s move on to the second phase. The average price for the treasures in this phase is around 100 million. Fellow Daoists, please be prepared!

“The first item, the feather of the Great Ming King. You should all remember the once-dominant Great Ming King in Tiannan. This feather was found in the Forest of Eternal Secrets at the site of his ascension. The starting bid is one hundred million godstones!”

“Great Ming King!” The crowd was shocked.

Even the several Sixth-tier Emperors sitting in the VIP room revealed eyes of disbelief.

The Forest of Eternal Secrets used to be a treasure trove but was not particularly famous. However, since a significant event occurred there, it became a restricted area in the realm. They knew little about what happened inside, but more than ten tier 6 Emperors had definitely fallen there, including the Peacock Great Ming King.

Now, someone was able to obtain treasures from that place, making them incredibly valuable.

Throughout the realm, countless powerhouses coveted the treasures of the Great Ming King.

The appearance of a feather now—did it imply that the experts from the Heavenly Court had obtained the corpse of the Great Ming King?

“l bid 500 million!” “800 million!” “20 billion!” Bidding quickly surpassed the limits of the tier 4 realm. Current bids were coming from tier 5 and even tier 6 Emperors.

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded. Wasn’t it just a feather?

Was it necessary to be like this?

He had seen a feather that rivaled the world; that was a true treasure.

Originally, he had thought of buying this peacock feather imbued with the five elements to enhance his Extreme Dao. Now it seemed he had no hope.

In the end, this feather was sent into a certain VIP room; presumably, a tier 5 Emperor succeeded in obtaining it.

“Never mind, the Forest of Eternal Secrets is not something we can fathom.

Even if I get that feather, 1 won’t be able to deduce anything!’

Even tier 6 Emperors could fall in groups; it was indeed not a place they dared to investigate.

The prices of the subsequent treasures were relatively stable, much more expensive than the previous round, but not as extravagant as the first item. People could still accept them.

Jian Wushuang also took the opportunity to bid on some items, spending billions of godstones.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Now he had already consumed nearly ten billion.

Auctioning on one side, cultivating on the other.

Finally, it came to treasures related to formations. The Luo Hou Formation he had set his eyes on was among them.

However, the starting price had changed.

“Based on the grand formation laid out by the ancient god Luo Hou, this formation has been modified by the Heavenly Court formation master Elder Yinyang and has now become a simplified version, requiring only a tier 4 Emperor to set it up!”

“Simplified version? It’s a bit regrettable!” Emperor Xia Mang Yunxing stood by the huge French window, looking at the formation in the hall, his eyes showing a glimmer that soon disappeared.

If it were the strongest Luo Hou Battle Formation set up by a tier 6 Emperor, the combat power could skyrocket several times.

Beside him was a stier 6 force; if they had the real Luo Hou Battle Formation, their chances of winning against the demon horde might be even greater.

If it were the strongest version of the Luo Hou Formation, it would probably require the payment of several tens of billions of godstones, but for the Great Xia Dynasty, these godstones were not considered much.

“Starting bid, 250 million!”

5 million cheaper than what Jian Wushuang had inquired.

“300 million!”

“450.5 million!”

Many slightly smaller forces began to bid.

Once this formation was set up, a tier 4 Emperor could contend against a tier 5 Emperor, especially suitable for these medium and small-sized families.

Not all families had tier 5 Emperors. Some small families only had two or three tier 4 Emperors. If they obtained this formation, it would cause their family’s strength to surge again..
