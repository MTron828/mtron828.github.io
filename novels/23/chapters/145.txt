Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The Formless Sword Art has nine sword skills, and each one is stronger than the previous one. What level of power will the last three sword skills reach?”?Jian Wushuang was looking forward to the results.

“Well, you should prepare for the selection battle being held in one month. Of course, before this battle, Dragon Palace will hold its own competition and choose ten people to participate in the selection battle. All the elders of Dragon Palace will return, so you will have a chance to meet them,” said Palace Master White.

“Elders?” Jian Wushuang asked, while smiling slightly.

He already knew the elders from Dragon Palace.

Although they did not stay in Dragon Palace during ordinary times, all of them were famous in Tianzong Dynasty. 15 of them (not including Su Lie) were on the Earthly Dragon List.

For Jian Wushuangto participate in the Easternmost Hunt, he had to go through three rounds or competition.

The first round was the selection within Dragon Palace. After all, Dragon Palace only had ten recommendations, but there were many old and new disciples that wanted to participate in this hunt, so it was inevitable that Jian Wushuang would take part in this competition.

The second round was the selection in Tianzong Dynasty! All the top talents in Tianzong Dynasty would take part in it.

The third and final round was the beginning of the real Easternmost Hunt. In that round, the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties would all compete against each other.

…

Inside the manor.

“Come on, let’s toast third brother’s resurrection.” Wang Yuan laughed happily and picked up a glass directly.

“How could you call it a resurrection? I was alive the whole time!” Jian Wushuang rolled his eyes, but he still drank the wine in his glass.

“Third brother, you never knew that after hearing the news of your death two years ago, I was in pain for a long time. So, you owe me another glass,” Wang Yuan said.

“Very well.” Jian Wushuang smiled and drank with Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou by his side.

Jian Wushuang was really happy to see these three siblings again after two years.

“By the way, you should be careful when dealing with that Blood Feather Tower who chased you, because there is something unusual about them,” Wang Yuan said with profound meaning.

“Something about them is weird.” Su Rou nodded her head deeply.

“Yes, I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. He never looked down upon Blood Feather Tower.

“Come on, let’s drink. Third brother, you should give a toast to second brother. In these two years when you were missing, in order to get revenge for you, second brother targeted Blood Feather Tower and used them to practice his swordsmanship. In those two-years of slaughter, numerous assassins of Blood Feather Tower died by his hands,” Wang Yuan said with a smile.

“I do need to give a toast to second brother. Come on, second brother.” Jian Wushuang immediately gave him a toast.

In these two years, Wang Yuan’s strength did not seem to have grown, but the strength of both Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou had greatly improved.

Previously, they had reached the Profound Gold Core Realm. But now, they had stepped into the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Especially Yang Zaixuan, his cultivation was definitely at the peak of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

Yang Zaixuan’s comprehension towards essence was rather high.

When he and Jian Wushuang entered the Dragon Palace, he had directly passed the eight level of the Dragon Gate. After such a long time, his comprehension must have reached a higher level. Combined with his cultivation, Yang Zaixuan’s overall strength should be very terrifying.

“Second brother is sitting in front of me. Although he deliberately restrained his breath, I feel that his strength is greater than Ouyang Haoyue’s.”?Jian Wushuang thought in his heart.

As for Su Rou, her cultivation had also improved, but Jian Wushuang had no idea how strong she was.

After all, Su Rou was mysterious.

Two years ago, at Quiet Moon Lake, Su Rou had released a terrifying aura and then pushed back a purple-masked assassin.

“Do you know about the event that is going to be held in three months?” Yang Zaixuan suddenly asked.

“You mean the Easternmost Hunt? Ha-ha, of course I know,” Wang Yuan said and laughed.

“I’ve just heard about it from Palace Master White,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile on his face.

Su Rou was still as shy as before and said nothing.

“Third brother, you will participate in this event, won’t you?” Yang Zaixuan asked him.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “And you?”

“I will definitely participate. I will join both the selection battle in one month and the Easternmost Hunt in three months,” Yang Zaixuan said coldly.

“Oh, pretty confident!” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, and then looked at Su Rou and said, “How about you?”

“I…” Su Rou muttered for a while, and then nodded her head and said, “I will do my best.”

“Ha-ha, all I can do is to wish for you three to succeed in the hunt. It’s a pity that my strength is not strong enough, or the four of us could join the Easternmost Hunt and show our power to the experts of large empires. Just thinking about that makes me excited,” Wang Yuan said with emotion.

“It’s still too early to say that. It will be difficult to get one of the ten recommendations from Dragon Palace, let alone one of the 15 places in the selection battle one month later. As far as I know, the elders of Dragon Palace will come back to help win more spots in this hunt. Their strength is extraordinary, and fifteen of them are on the Earthly Dragon List,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Of those elders, only Baili Chen, who is ranked second, and Qing Cang, who is ranked sixth on the Earthly Dragon List, are worth worrying about. There is nothing to fear from the others,” Yang Zaixuan said in a cold voice.

“That’s really crazy!” Jian Wushuang said and chuckled, but a real smile emerged from his heart.

The four siblings gathered together and talked for a long time, not dispersing until the evening.

“Third brother, I have prepared a gift for you. Can I show it to you?” Wang Yuan held Jian Wushuang’s shoulders and said with a mysterious smile on his face. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Gift?” Jian Wushuang wiped his nose and said, “Of course, let me see the gift. Lead the way.”

“OK,” Wang Yuan answered. Then he led Jian Wushuang to leave the Dragon Palace and go to the imperial palace.

...

Wang Yuan and Jian Wushuang came to a seemingly ordinary shop in the imperial palace. Under the guidance of an attendant, they entered the cellar and then stepped into a secret chamber.

Two purple-robed guards were standing in front of the secret chamber’s door.

Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed when he saw these two guards.

“Yin-Yang Void Realm?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of astonishment.

He could obviously detect that the two guards in front of him were experts at the peak of the Yin-Yang Void Realm!

Experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm, guarding the door to a secret chamber?

What was going on here?

“Brother Yuan, this is…” Jian Wushuang involuntarily asked.

“Ha-ha, don’t ask so much. Later you will know everything. Come with me.” Wang Yuan waved his hand, and then the two guards immediately opened the door. Wang Yuan and Jian Wushuang walked into the secret chamber, one after the other.

This secret chamber was actually a totally enclosed dungeon.

There was only a tiny amount of candlelight, so this dungeon was very dark. As soon as Jian Wushuang stepped into the dungeon, he saw a body in the center of the room, tied to a burning iron prop by a black iron chain.

The body was covered in scars. Some of them were caused by a knife, while some were worm bites. The scars were terrifying to look at.
