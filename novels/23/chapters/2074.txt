2075 Ancient Emperor“s Grave

“King Luo Yu, do you know of this grave?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes,” King Luo Yu said as he nodded his head. “It was left behind by Ancient God Emperor. The conscience of Ancient God Emperor resides within the grave. It is our sanctuary. However, this grave opens once every million years. The last time the grave opened was around three hundred thousand years ago. If you want to enter, you will have to wait another seven hundred thousand years.”

“Seven hundred thousand years?” Jian Wushuang looked at King Xing Chen coldly as his face turned black. “Are you trying to make a fool out of me?”

“I have no intentions of making a fool out of you. It is true that it takes another seven hundred thousand years for the Ancient Emperor’s Grave to open by itself. However, this grave is controlled by my father’s conscience. If you are worthy, my father will open the grave and allow you to enter immediately.” King Chen Xing grunted.

Jian Wushuang hesitated before nodding his head. “Okay. I will try to enter the Ancient Emperor’s Grave.”

“Sword Emperor. King Chen Xing is trying to make your life difficult. You can afford to ignore him as ninety-nine percent of the Ancient Gods will support you in becoming the next Ancient God Emperor due to your superior bloodline power,” King Luo Yu said anxiously.

“No worries,” Jian Wushuang said as he waved King Luo Yu off. He already knew what he had to do.

Jian Wushuang did not think of killing or exiling King Chen Xing.

King Chen Xing was a stage two Great Emperor and would prove to be crucial in the final battle against Three-Emperor World. Furthermore, he could not help but respect the ability of King Chen Xing as he had single-handedly molded the Ancient God Clan into one of the strongest clans in the era.

If he could get King Chen Xing to listen to him wholeheartedly, he could rest assured and leave the Ancient God Clan to King Cheng Xing when he left Ancient God Sanctuary.

He would fight for this possibility.

Another important reason was the Ancient Emperor’s Grave…

The first Ancient God Emperor was one of the strongest men back in the first era. His power and ability was much stronger than that of any Great Emperors.

Jian Wushuang was extremely interested in the things these kind of super experts would leave behind.

Now he had received the news that such a grave exists. Even if King Chen Xing did not raise entering the grave as one of his conditions, Jian Wushuang would still venture into the grave. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“King Chen Xing, take me to the Ancient Emperor’s Grave,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes,” King Chen Xing said as he led the way without hesitation.

Jian Wushuang, King Luo Yu and the other top-tier Ancient God followed suit.

Ancient Emperor’s Grave was located in the middle of the Ancient God Sanctuary. It was the holiest place in the hearts of most Ancient Gods.

This place would be flooded with people every million years when it would open its doors. On a normal day like this, no one would be around.

However, every Ancient God who was at least seven stars had gathered here.

The leaders of them were the three Nine-star Ancient Gods: King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu and King Zhan Cang.

These three leaders stood cautiously beside a young man.

“Is this the Ancient Emperor’s Grave?”

Jian Wushuang said with his hands behind his back. He was looking at a cave within a formation.

The cave was gigantic and the formation was extremely powerful.

“This is the entrance. Every time the grave opens, people of this clan will enter that way. Even if the grave is not open today, that is the only way you can take to enter forcibly,” King Chen Xing said as he pointed towards a certain part of the formation.

Jian Wushuang nodded lightly.

“Sword Emperor, this grave was left behind by the first Ancient God Emperor using unimaginable means. Even after so long, no one had ever managed to enter forcibly. All those who tried, including King Chen Xing, were at least Eight-star Ancient Gods. All those who tried failed and died inside, except for King Chen Xing. Please reconsider carefully,” King Luo Yu said as his eyebrows were knitted closely together.

“After hearing all this, are you afraid? If you are, leave this place immediately. You can get all the support from the other Ancient Gods. Just don’t come looking for me,” King Chen Xing said coldly.

“Afraid? Since you, King Chen Xing, can walk out of the grave alive, why should I be afraid? I hope you remember your promise,” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

Jian Wushuang took off towards the Ancient Emperor’s grave slowly, ignoring the people who stood behind him.

Even though he walked slowly, it only took him a few steps to reach the entrance of the grave.

The first thing he saw at the entrance was a large flight of stairs. There were hundreds of steps and each radiated a special aura.

King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu and the other Ancient Gods stood far away and observed quietly.

“Lord Chen Xing, do you think that Jian Wushuang could gain recognition from the Emperor himself?” King Zhan Cang asked curiously.

“Humph! Recognition? Dream on. My father was one of the strongest overlords in the first era. His standards are extremely high. It will be extremely difficult to meet those standards,” King Chen Xing smiled coldly.

“I bet he can’t even make it past the door inside the grave, much less gain recognition. The measures my father placed around the grave are profound and unpredictable. These measures cannot not differentiate ally from foe. In the past, I tried to enter forcibly as there was an extremely urgent matter. I almost died from those measures!”

“Even though Jian Wushuang is stronger than me, it is also impossible for him to make it past the different defensive measures my father put in place.”

King Zhan Cang was stunned.

King Luo Yu, King Gu You and the other Ancient Gods became worried upon hearing this.

“Look, he is going to enter,” a voice shouted out loud.

Everyone turned their heads and looked toward the grave.

Jian Wushuang stood at the base of the staircase in front of the entrance. He lifted his right leg and stepped onto the first step.

The moment his right foot hit the first step, he felt an aura suppressing him, trying to stop him from advancing further.

This aura targeted the bloodline power, and had no effect on one’s power level.

Jian Wushuang smiled when he felt this aura. Immediately, another aura of an extremely powerful Ancient God bloodline burst forth.
