Chapter 2445: The Reign of Terror (2)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was outrageous.

Jian Wushuang’s horrifying killing spree.

In less than half a day, more than 150 disciples were killed.

Among those disciples, the weakest were not ordinary Second-Class Divine Demons but genius disciples from various sects.

All of them were treated as treasures in their sects. Every single loss was painful for those sects, but Jian Wushuang killed them like lambs.

“He’s crazy!”

“Jian Wushuang is simply a killing machine!”

“I heard he’s only in his twenties this year and already has strong murderous intent at such a young age. What would he become if he’s allowed to live?”

“Kill him. He must be killed. I must kill this demon to avenge my disciples who died!”

Many sects’ experts were enraged.

If Jian Wushuang had offended more than ten or even twenty sects in merely one of his massacres, he had offended more than half of the sects in Wusha Wilderness after his half a day killing spree.

Those sects could not wait to kill Jian Wushuang.

In a corner of the plains, the three elders of Narcissus Island were put under more pressure as Jian Wushuang killed even more.

“Matters are getting out of hand and completely beyond our control,” said Elder Linghe coldly.

“I think Jian Wushuang did nothing wrong. Those people were after his head, so he didn’t need to show them any mercy,” commented Elder Wujian.

“That’s true, but we have too many sects involved now. Jian Wushuang had offended most of the sects in Wusha Wilderness. Even if Jian Wushuang could get out of the tomb in one piece, I’m afraid he will have to endure the assassination of various sects. I’m afraid that neither we nor Narcissus Island can protect him,” said the Seventh Elder.

The killings were so crazy with many genius disciples killed. Such matters had not occurred for a long time in Wusha Wilderness.

There was without a doubt that Jian Wushuang’s crazy massacre had aroused public outrage.

Under all of the sect’s extreme anger and pressure, Narcissus Island was unable to defend Jian Wushuang.

“Now, that young man can only look out for himself.” Elder Wujian sighed.

He had never expected such a situation.

Initially, he thought as long as Jian Wushuang could make it out alive from the tomb, Narcissus Island would protect him under its wings. It did not seem to be the case anymore.

Jian Wushuang was sauntering inside the Saint’s Tomb.

He had no idea where he was heading, so he just kept walking and killing wherever he went.

His expression remained calm and unwavering.

In his previous life, Jian Wushuang had seen scenes that were countless times crazier than this. He had killed innumerable people to the point he was numb. Killing merely more than a hundred genius disciples did not affect him at all.

“The disciples are getting smarter now.”

Jian Wushuang scanned the area with his soul power. He could sense that many disciples gathered in the void near him, but no one acted rashly. They were just tailing him and making sure he did not disappear from their sights.

Anyway, nothing could be done.

Initially, those sects’ genius disciples wanted to rely on their own abilities to kill Jian Wushuang and monopolized the reward, but they had finally come to their senses after half a day.

It was impossible to kill Jian Wushuang with merely one or two sects joined forces.

They had to join forces with more powerful experts if they were going to take Jian Wushuang out.

At least ten sects had to join forces, and perhaps about a hundred or even hundreds of disciples would have to besiege Jian Wushuang in an effort to kill him.

Therefore, they could only wait to round up more people.

Jian Wushuang was aware of their plans but could not be bothered.

As long as those disciples did not take the initiative to attack him, he would not want to start a fight. However, he would be merciless once his opponent struck the first attack. He would kill all of them if he could, regardless of which sect they belonged to or what kind of background they had.

After all, he had already upset many sects.

In his opinion, killing was still killing regardless of whether it was only one person or 10,000 people.

Similarly, offending one sect or a few sects was anyhow still offending.

If all the sects in Saint’s Tomb tried to kill him in exchange for the reward, he would not hesitate to wipe all of them out!

As time went by, more and more genius disciples gathered around Jian Wushuang.

“I’m afraid it won’t be long before people from the Great Compassionate Sect arrive?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

During the half-day massacre, he killed too fast and had not come across people of the Great Compassion Sect, however as many sects had gathered around him, news about his location would have traveled fast. The Great Compassion Sect would definitely be on their way as soon as possible.

“Mmm?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed as he lifted his head to look forward.

There were five figures standing in his way in front of him.

There was only one First-Class Divine Demon while the other four were only Second-Class Divine Demon. They were probably from an ordinary sect.

What took Jian Wushuang by surprise was that they neither stepped aside nor attempted to kill him like the other ordinary sect disciples when they saw him. They merely stood in front of him and had no intention to move aside and give way to him.

Jian Wushuang faintly smiled and moved forward to greet the group.

“Senior Brother, Jian Wushuang is here.” A Second-Class Divine Demon among the five figures nervously quipped.

“I know.” The First-Class Divine Demon among those five nodded heavily with a hint of terror in his eyes when he looked at Jian Wushuang.

Who would dare to stand in Jian Wushuang’s way?

“Don’t worry, we aren’t his opponents.” This First-Class Divine Demon strived to maintain his composure. He immediately bowed and saluted when Jian Wushuang appeared before him. “Su Nan from Ice Fire God Palace has met Senior Brother Wushuang.”

“Ice Fire God Palace?” Jian Wushuang’s heart moved, and he finally understood why the five people in front did not avoid him.

“So, you are from the Ice Fire God Palace? How’s my Second Brother doing in your place?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Ice Fire God Palace was a small sect in the Wusha Wilderness. Jian Wushuang knew them because his second brother, Zhuo Peng was a disciple of Ice Fire God Palace.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
