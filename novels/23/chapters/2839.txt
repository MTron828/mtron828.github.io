Chapter 2840: Shock

——

“As for the treasure that my master can refine, it’s also very rare in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. The last time it appeared, it was the treasure that Lord Bone Emperor asked my master to refine. The treasure that you asked my master to refine shouldn’t be of a higher level than the treasure that Lord Bone Emperor refined, right?” Bi Yan teased.

Hearing Bi Yan’s words, Jian Wushuang’s expression became a little strange.

However, he could understand that Lord Mo was the number one blacksmith in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. With such a high level of craftsmanship and great strength, he naturally would not take ordinary items seriously.

Although the Blood Wilderness Emperor Essence was rare and precious, there were still many in the fire cloud castle. As for the sacred elixir, the Fire Cloud Castle did not lack it. It was too difficult to impress Lord Mo with just a piece of the Blood Wilderness Emperor Essence.

“If I can’t impress him with the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, I might have to rely on that thing...” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly, but he had already made up his mind.

“Mr. Bi Yan, in addition to the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, I have a special item that Lord Mo might be interested in,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Oh, do you have a treasure that is more valuable and rarer than the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal?” Bi Yan looked over in surprise.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. He slowly reached out his hand and a jade bottle appeared in his hand.

There was a drop of boiling hot, bright red liquid in the jade bottle.

“Is this... Essence Blood?”

Bi Yan sensed the liquid in the jade bottle and was stunned. “Show me the Essence Blood.”

Jian Wushuang handed the jade bottle to Bi Yan without hesitation.

Bi Yan took the jade bottle and began to examine the drop of blood essence.

“It’s so pure, so pure!”

“Although the strength of the blood essence is not very strong and its owner is not a high-level divine master, his bloodline is terrifyingly high. The blood essence is so pure that it is at least 1,000 times higher than that of a normal human cultivator!”

“Such pure blood essence, those top-tier beasts, fierce beasts, and even some of the top-tier bloodlines in the absolute beginning divine realm can’t have it. Only one kind of existence can have this kind of blood essence, and that is the special life forms born in the vast absolute beginning divine realm. Those innately powerful and unique special life forms!”

Bi Yan’s eyes were shining with excitement, and his body was shaking violently.

After a long while, he looked at Jian Wushuang again.

“Mr. Sword One, how did you get this Essence Blood?” Bi Yan asked.

“I found it by chance, but I wonder if this Essence Blood can interest your master Mo?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“Yes, absolutely.” Bi Yan nodded solemnly, “This is the Essence Blood of a special life form. The number of special life forms in the absolute beginning divine realm is pitifully few. I’ve never heard of any special life form in the Golden Crow Nine Realms or in the surrounding great realms. It’s like ascending to heaven to get a drop of the Essence Blood of a special life form in the territory near the Golden Crow Nine Realms. Master has always longed for a drop, but he only had extravagant hopes. He didn’t expect that today...”

At this point, Bi Yan could no longer hold back his excitement.

He took a deep breath, in a deep voice, he said, “Mr. Sword One, can I bring this drop of Essence Blood to meet master personally? I can guarantee that master will meet you personally and refine a magic weapon for you.”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

“Please wait here for a moment.”

Bi Yan said and then rushed to the deepest part of the castle.

Jian Wushuang continued to wait in the side hall.

“It’s really troublesome to report to master Mo one by one.” Jian Wushuang sat there, feeling helpless, but there was also a strange smile on his face.

“Such a drop of Essence Blood has shocked Bi Yan so much. If I take out the complete Essence Blood, wouldn’t he go crazy?”

Jian Wushuang felt it was funny.

He had prepared the drop of essence blood for Bi Yan in advance.

The Essence Blood naturally did not come from some so-called special life form, but from him, a perfect chaotic creature. Of course, it was not his most complete Essence Blood, but his own Essence Blood, which he diluted and decomposed, it was only obtained after decomposing a full 100 parts.

In other words, he had decomposed his complete Essence Blood into a full 100 drops, and he had just given one drop to Bi Yan.

After decomposing 100 parts, the purity of this drop of Essence Blood was actually only one percent of his perfect chaotic creature’s complete Essence Blood, or even less than one percent.

Even so, it still made the jade flame so shocked.

But Jian Wushuang’s most complete Essence Blood was really amazing.

...

The deepest part of the Fire Cloud Castle was at the bottom of a volcano.

The crimson space was extremely hot, and the ground was so hot that it was scarlet red.

A naked silver-haired elder held a farm ax in his hand and directly chopped it.

A piece of firewood in front of him was split in half.

The silver-haired old man threw the split firewood into the sea of fire in front of him. Then, he picked up the second piece of firewood and struck out with his ax again...

The silver-haired old man was rather thin and weak. His skin was dark and he did not look like he had much strength. However, as he struck out with his ax, the firewood made of mystical wood was easily split in half.

The silver-haired old man continued chopping firewood, one after another.

At this moment, the purple-robed middle-aged man, Bi Yan, hurriedly appeared in the crimson-red space.

When he saw the silver-haired old man chopping firewood, Bi Yan would normally obediently stand by the side and wait. He would only speak when the silver-haired old man stopped to rest. However, he immediately spoke... “Master, this disciple has an urgent matter.”

The silver-haired old man who was chopping with the ax paused for a moment before continuing to chop down.

Kacha!

Another piece of firewood was chopped off. Following that, the silver-haired old man leaned on the ax and turned around to look at Biyan.

“Speak.” He spoke softly. His voice was cold and emotionless, but it was extremely majestic.

“Master, I have brought something. Please take a look.”

Bi Yan did not waste any words and directly took out the jade bottle.

When the silver-haired old man, who originally had a cold expression, saw the jade bottle, or more accurately, the drop of Blood Essence in it, his pupils suddenly shrank!
