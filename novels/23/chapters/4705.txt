4706 Help From the Emperors

The surging Sword Intent did not achieve the desired effect. After it all smashed into his mouth, it was like a clay ox entering the sea, without the slightest ripple.

At the same time, a terrifying suction force rose and enveloped Jian Wushuang.

He felt Yan power flowing out of his body uncontrollably. At the same time, his skin was aging quickly.

The Arhat was devouring Jian Wushuang’s power!

However, it was too late. Jian Wushuang could not escape.

The bald Arhat laughed madly. His stomach was as big as a bucket, and he directly swallowed the whole whale into his stomach.

When the last wisp of light completely disappeared, the whole process only took a few dozen breaths. He could not suppress the excitement on his face.

As long as he devoured them, even Yan Immortals would not be able to escape.

The bald Arhat was already in ecstasy. He could already imagine the scene when he took that step and Ascend.

At the thought of this, the bald Arhat did not stay any longer and directly flew towards the eight-armed Budda image form.

He sat back on top of the eight-armed Buddha image form and glanced coldly at the few people who were struggling to resist on the ground. Then, he closed his eyes and began to digest.

His top priority now was to take that step!

At that moment, Jian Wushuang, who was dressed in a black robe, entered a strange space.

As far as the eye could see, it was all chaotic haze, and the ground under his feet was slightly wet.

If he did not guess wrong, the space he was in right now was the stomach of the bald Arhat.

In the chaotic and strange haze, the Yan power in his body was slowly being stripped away. However, Jian Wushuang did not look worried at all.

Even earlier, when the bald Arhat had the thought of devouring, Jian Wushuang had already understood it and played along with it.

If the three emperors were not around, Jian Wushuang would not have dared to be involved. But now, things were different.

Before the three emperors left, they would be his greatest trump card.

Breaking through from the inside would be a pretty good method to directly destroy this rather sinister Whirling Patriarch to the greatest extent.

Taking the Boyang Bottle from his waist, Jian Wushuang directly pulled out the stopper.

Immediately after, three figures scrambled out of the Boyang Bottle.

“It’s all your fault, you old man. You can just sleep if you have nothing to do. Why did you blindly pour in Yan power? you almost caused my beard to fall!”

Jian Wushuang felt a headache when he saw the three Emperor Lords cursing at each other. It seemed to have become a fixed way for the three of them to appear.

“All of you shut up, don’t lose your demeanor in front of this Little Friend.” The dual-pupiled old man coughed, then took a step forward and said with a smile, “Little Friend, you called the three of us out. Have you met with any trouble?”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He cupped his hands and told the three Emperors everything that had happened.

After saying this, the three Emperors turned around and looked around.

“In other words, we’re now in that guy’s stomach?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“This fellow’s cultivation level is not bad. He’s about to reach the perfect level,” the dual-pupiled old man said as he stroked his beard.

The majestic old man snorted disdainfully. “He’s using crooked ways, something that can’t be shown in public. With such a state of mind, even if he continues to cultivate, it’s impossible for him to become an Emperor.”

“Nonsense, how many people can be as outstanding as us, able to obtain the great destiny, Ascend to the throne, create the Heavenly Court, and recruit talents?” the tall and thin old man said arrogantly.

Surprisingly, this time, the other two Emperors did not refute him. They both agreed.

“…”

“Three Seniors, do you have any way to deal a heavy blow to this guy?” Jian Wushuang cupped his hands and said.

When the three Emperor heard this, they straightened his faces and looked around again. Then, the tall and thin old man smiled smugly. “What’s so difficult about it? This old man’s strength has already reached the peak, but he has not taken that step. This means that there is a crack in his mind. As long as we find it, everything will be solved without any attack.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then walked forward.

Three old men in tattered Emperor’s clothing were all lying on his body, acting as guides.

As he walked in the darkness, with the three Emperor Lords’ fate energy on his body, the Yan power in his body did not dissipate, and it began to show signs of recovery.

After pushing away the layers of mist, countless unconscious cultivator True Souls floated in this strange space.

“What a foul-smelling person. I’m sure that this old man’s evil cultivation technique is definitely from Zhen Wuyang.” The tall and thin old man waved his hand in disgust. At the same time, he wrapped Jian Wushuang with a ray of Emperor light. “Don’t be affected by the karma.”

The other two Emperors nodded affirmatively and waved their hands to disperse the True Souls that were approaching.

After dispersing all the True Souls, Jian Wushuang counted more than 90,000 steps in his heart and arrived at the place where the wind was howling.

There was a violent squall wreaking havoc, but it was not a big deal to him.

The Emperors jumped down from Jian Wushuang’s back and stood at the front.

“This should be the old man’s weakest point. Su He, you’ll have to help this time,” the tall and thin old man said without looking sideways.

“You’re making it seem as if I’ve never done anything.” The dual-pupiled old man curled his lips. As he spoke, he swept his palm forward.

An extremely complex palm pattern, carrying the Emperor’s light, smashed toward the weakest point.

This strange world suddenly trembled, and a shrill roar came from nowhere and resounded in all directions.

Golden cracks began to appear.

The tall and thin old man and the awe-inspiring old man also moved at the same time. They raised their palms and waved. Two grand and full of Emperor’s light patterns pressed forward.

With the combined power of the three Emperors, the mighty Emperor’s light surged and easily broke through this strange world.

Although he had expected it, Jian Wushuang was still surprised by how easily the three Emperor Lords waved their Emperor marks. The unrivaled aura had appeared the moment the three Emperor Lords waved their Emperor marks.

At the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief. If he had killed one of the Emperor’s True Shadows at the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes, he would not have been able to leave the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes alive.

That kind of unrivaled dominance, even if it was only the True Shadow of an Emperor, was enough to make people tremble.

At the same time, the bald Arhat who was sitting on the eight-armed image form’s shoulder suddenly opened his eyes and looked at his belly.

With his belly button as the center, golden lines began to spread out, almost instantly covering his entire stomach.

The next moment, it exploded!

A radiance that carried billions of wisps of light gushed out, illuminating the entire Whirling Heaven.

“No!” the bald Arhat said with difficulty. He wanted to escape at all costs, but his entire divine body had been shattered. Only his ugly head was left.
