Chapter 513: Saint Castle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Inside Heaven Wing City.

Jian Wushuang walked with Qing Huo on the wide street while looking around at the huge buildings. They were ancient and splendid, as delicate as sculptures.

The streets were crowded with people.

“What a busy city,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Even though humans only occupy less than 10 percent of the territory on the Monster Continent, it’s still very vast and the number of tribes and warriors is quite astonishing. All the tribes come to the Eight Cities to exchange goods. As one of those cities, Heaven Wing City is naturally lively,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement. Before long, he noticed an ancient purple castle, which was about 100 meters tall, at the end of the street. It was so humongous that it was extremely eye-catching among buildings in Heaven Wing City.

“That’s Saint Castle, also known as Monster-exterminating Castle. If you want to be a Divine General, you have to accept the assessment there,” Qing Huo said.

“Let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said.

He headed towards Saint Castle with Qing Huo and they quickly arrived at the entrance.

After climbing the stairs, they stepped into the hall.

“So quiet,” Jian Wushuang whispered.

The hall was very empty. The dozens of people in this empty hall made it more sparse. It was completely the opposite of the busy streets.

“People here are either Divine Generals or applicants trying to become a Divine General. Of course, it wouldn’t be crowded here,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and noticed the application counter.

A blue-haired beauty sat behind the counter, in front of a shelf that was filled with bottles of wine.

“Shadow, give me a bottle of Lion Liver Wine,” Qing Huo came to the counter and said directly.

She raised her head and then gave him a bottle of wine, then she said, “10 thousand Raw Gems.”

“We’re old friends. Why do you still charge me so much?” Qing Huo muttered but still took out the Raw Gems.

“Qing Huo, who is he?” the blue-haired beauty looked toward Jian Wushuang and asked.

“He’s a little brother from my tribe. He came here to participate in the Divine General assessment,” Qing Huo said. “Shadow, please help him register.”

“The Divine General assessment?” The blue-haired beauty nodded and asked, “What’s your name? Which tribe are you from?”

“Jian Wushuang from the Wu Yan Tribe,” Jian Wushuang answered.

The blue-haired beauty recorded his name on a list and said, “You’re lucky. There is a Divine General assessment about to take place right now. Wait a moment, I’ll make the arrangement for you immediately.”

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You’re fortunate. The Divine General assessment is held every ten days. You came at the right time,” Qing Huo said and laughed.

The blue-haired beauty immediately left to make the arrangements. A moment later, she returned with a white-haired elder.

The white-haired elder looked at Jian Wushuang without saying anything, but a strange light flashed in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang had seen this strange light before. He knew that it was the Monster Discriminator’s special method.

“Wushuang, all the applicants for Divine General assessment are tested. It’s to prevent monster spies from sneaking into the team. Don’t worry,” Qing Huo explained.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded.

The strange light in the white-haired elder’s eyes lasted for a while. As Jian Wushuang had no reaction at all, it gradually dissipated.

“Come with me,” said the white-haired elder, then he went straight to the inner layer of the castle.

“Go. I’ll wait for you outside,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang followed the white-haired elder without hesitation.

It didn’t take long for him to arrive at an open space in the inner layer, where lots of people were waiting.

These men and women were all warriors, and they all possessed a powerful aura. When Jian Wushuang arrived, they only cast a casual glance at him and then looked away.

“They all came here to accept the assessment,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

There were over 30 warriors. Among them, several warriors had an extremely strong aura.

In particular, a red-haired young man that was standing on the edge of the open space attracted his attention. This young man carried a saber on his back and stood there with his devilish eyes slightly closed. The arrogant expression on his face showed that he was not paying attention to anyone present.

“He should be at the Eight-cloud Realm?”?Jian Wushuang thought in surprise.

A Seven-cloud Realm Human Warrior with a strong body was enough to be a Divine General. An Eight-cloud Realm warrior would be regarded as excellent among the Divine Generals. Therefore, it was common for the Seven-cloud Realm warriors to participate in the assessment, but it was rare for Eight-cloud Realm warriors.

Just then, a purple-robed middle-aged man, flanked by a couple of people, walked toward them.

He held a list in his hand which recorded these applicants’ information. After standing in front of them, he looked around.

“Listen well. The assessment is very simple.”

“Walk along this tunnel until you reach the huge Gladiator Arena in the innermost part of the castle. Once you step into it, your opponent will naturally appear in front of you. What you need to do is to use your full strength against him.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Whether you pass the assessment or not depends on your performance in the Gladiator Arena.”

“That is to say, the better you perform in the Gladiator Arena, the more likely you are to become a Divine General.”

The purple-robed man stopped and watched their reactions.

His words caused a stir among the applicants, but they quickly quieted down and accepted it calmly.

“By the way, Emperor Fengxiao, one of the 108 Divine Emperors in the Monster-exterminating League, happens to be in the castle. He’ll be watching your battles at the Gladiator Arena. It’s a good opportunity for you,” the purple-robed man said.

“Emperor Fengxiao?”

“The famous Emperor Fengxiao from the Monster-exterminating League? He’s in the castle and will watch our assessment?”

“Oh, if Emperor Fengxiao appreciates my performance and chooses me as a disciple, then I would be very lucky.”

Everyone became excited.

Even the arrogant red-haired young man on the edge of the open space changed his expression.
