Chapter 3378: Fierce Battle

Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A majestic aura surged out of Master Gorsch’s body and directly pressed down on Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo.

‘When they felt this aura, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo instantly understood the level of Master Gorsch.

“She really is in the sixth realm of the Void.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

“Tt seems that this old woman has not wasted her time.” Demon Master Chenhuo was still very relaxed.

Many Principles Masters of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley looked proud.

Master Gorsch was the strongest person in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley besides the old master. He was also a great reliance!

In the second heaven, other overlord sects, like Xiaoyao Palace, the strongest Marquis Xiaoyao was only at the peak of the void fourth realm. However, the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley’s foundation was obviously much deeper. As long as Master Gorsch took it out…is enough to bring shame to

almost all the sects in the duplex.

She held a spear in her hand, the spear is extremely sharp, lightning-like thrust, three rules of the integration of the power, at this moment also completely revealed.

And at the moment when Master Gorsch made his move, the Demon Master Chenhuo also moved.

Demon Master Chenhuo’s figure flickered and appeared in front of Master Gorsch as though she had teleported. After that, a similarly shocking aura rose up. The Demon Master Chenhuo stretched out her palm and clenched it into a fist. After that, she directly punched out.

“Courting death!”

The eyes of Master Gorsch turned cold as she shouted out.

She was a great being of the sixth level of the Void Space Realm, and she did not hold back. As soon as she made her move, she tried her best. Even a great being of the sixth level of the Void Space Realm had to be fully focused to receive this spear, but this Demon Master Chenhuo…she did not dodge or

evade. Instead, she threw a punch.

The key point was that this fist did not even have a pair of fists or gloves or weapons. It was purely an empty-handed collision with her true treasure spear. If this was not courting death, then what was? In the blink of an eye, this sharp spear collided with Demon Master Chenhuo’s seemingly ordinary

fist.

Peng!

Aloud sound rang out. In an instant, space cracks that spread over 100 meters spread out crazily.

Heaven and earth seemed to split apart directly from the middle.

After this collision sound rang out, an extremely pathetic figure immediately retreated explosively from the battlefield.

This pathetic figure was still emitting a white light, but it was much dimmer than before.

“Uncle-Master Que!”

The scene in front of them shocked Longyu and the Principles Masters of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

They had been proud of the strength that Master Que had displayed, but in the blink of an eye, Master Que had been forced back by the opponent. Furthermore, the opponent had forced her back with his bare hands. He had not even used his weapon.

“How can this be?”

Master Que had a look of disbelief on her face. She raised her head and looked at the Demon Master Chenhuo in front of her.

At this moment, the Demon Master Chenhuo was still as calm as ever. However, there was a suffocating aura spreading from his body.

This aura was something that even Master Que could not help but be moved.

“Six realms of the Void, you are also at the six realms of the Void!” Master Que was extremely shocked, and a huge wave rose in her heart.

Although she had noticed Demon Master Chenhuo before, and at the same time, she knew about his talent in the past, but in her mind, he had been silent for so many years, and his reputation in the Divine Beginning Realm had not spread out at all, obviously, he had gone into seclusion.

Only by staying in seclusion could he escape the pursuit of the Flame Saint Realm. and since he was in seclusion, he was naturally completely cut off from the outside world, unable to obtain any opportunities and experiences. Even if nearly 200 million years had passed…his strength should not have

increased much.

But now, it was clear that she had guessed wrong!

“With his bare hands, he didn’t even use his gloves, yet he was able to force me back with a single punch. This strength…is definitely not just the ordinary six realms of the void. I’m afraid he has already reached the peak of the six realms of the Void!”

Thinking of this, Master Que sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Que, you and I had crossed paths before 200 million years ago. At that time, I had just stepped into the fourth realm of the Void not long ago. I didn’t gain any advantage from your hands and instead suffered a small loss. But today, I’m afraid the situation will have to be completely reversed.” Demon

Master Chenhuo sneered.

Master Que’s expression sank, but he shouted in a low voice, “Leave this Demon Master Chenhuo to me. You guys go deal with Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

Whoosh!

Master Gorsch’s figure flashed, and in the blink of an eye, he was engaged in a fierce battle with Demon Master Chenhuo.

Meanwhile, Longyu and the other elders of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley swarmed toward Jian Wushuang. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, release Master Han Xin and Master Zhu Xin, and we’ll spare your life!” Longyu shouted.

“Ridiculous.” Jian Wushuang smiled disdainfully with a sneer on his face. Although he did not use his power to kill Master Zhu Xin and Han Xin in the scarlet tower at the first moment, he immediately made his move.

His body flashed and he disappeared in front of the Principles Masters of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

“Is this…shadowless escape art?”

“Be careful, this is the shadowless escape art created by Blood Blade Master. It’s very strange!”

The Principles Masters of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley immediately became alert.

In the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, besides Master Gorsch, she was the most powerful expert and also at the peak of the Void realm. She could see through Jian Wushuang’s escape art.

“He’s there, sixth elder, behind you!” Longyu immediately shouted.

“What?” The sixth elder of the Supreme Emotion Valley, a purple-clothed girl with a long whip, turned around immediately. Sure enough, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared behind her, and as soon as he appeared, a blood-red flash had already attacked.

It was the second move of the bloody blade swordsmanship, the first move of heart penetration!

“It’s too fast!”

The purple-clothed girl was shocked. She immediately waved the long whip in her hand. The long whip was like a flood dragon, instantly wrapping around the blood-red flash, trying to block it, however, the terrifying piercing power of the blood-red flash was completely beyond her imagination.

Whoosh! Almost in an instant, the purple-clothed girl’s long whip was shaken to the side. Fortunately, the long whip was a supreme treasure. If it was an ordinary top-tier holy treasure, under the terrifying piercing power, the long whip would probably be shattered instantly.

The long whip was easily shaken away, and the blood-red shock wave did not decrease in power, but it continued to pierce through the purple-clothed girl’s divine body.

The purple-clothed girl immediately activated the surface defense of her body.

But in the end…
