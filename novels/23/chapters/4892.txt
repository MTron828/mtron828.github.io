4893 The Moonless and Windy Night

After returning to the hall from the southernmost area of Little Lonely Heaven, Jian Wushuang finally relaxed.

After the battle with Chang Duoling, he had been in a deep sleep for nearly ten years, and had no time to sort out his own situation. So what he needed to do now was to sort out the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent and the Immortal Styles.

After returning to the hall, Jian Wushuang did not rush to sit down. Instead, he sat on the roof of the hall and looked down at the reconstructed Little Lonely Heaven.

Di Qing, who was following behind him, seemed to have something to say. He looked at Jian Wushuang from time to time.

“Do you have something to tell me?”

“Yes, I do.” Di Qing was a little surprised, but he still asked, “Did you go somewhere before the last war?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded, “I gained some Enlightenment in the Lower Three Heavens.

“The Yan Immortal who gave you Enlightenment is not simple, ” Di Qing said slowly, his voice was a little serious. “I can feel his aura, and I can also feel his power.”

Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised. He knew Di Qing’s pride. For him to say such a thing, it meant that the strength of Sir Yuan was probably above his.

Above the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, there was probably only the peak Grand Yan Immortal.

the hostility in his body is also too strong. This is the first time I’ve seen a Yan Immortal with such strong hostility. Di Qing looked at him, “The reason why I’m telling you this is that I hope you can stay away from him.”

Jian Wushuang said, “He cultivates the Slaughter Dao, so it’s normal for him to have a huge amount of hostility.”

Di Qing turned his eyes to the void, “In addition to the hostility, I also felt some inexplicable aura from him.”

He nodded. “I’ll be more aware and alert.”

Di Qing wanted to say something, but in the end, he said nothing.

The two of them stood on the roof for a while more before returning to the hall.

Sitting on the jade seat at the head of the table, Jian Wushuang was still thinking about Di Qing’s words, and he felt that what he said made more sense.

Due to the difference in the flow of time, he had stayed in Sir Yuan’s Domain for nearly 2,000 years and fought with him for more than 1,000 years.

During this time, he did not sense any thoughts from Sir Yuan, which was extremely mysterious.

The reason why Jian Wushuang felt that Di Qing’s words made sense was that he had also noticed the inexplicable strange aura of Sir Yuan during the time he had spent with him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The strange aura was very sudden and mysterious. Even though Jian Wushuang had paid close attention, he could not guess what it was.

“Don’t tell me that he has other plans?”

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought with his eyes closed.

Di Qing thought he had fallen asleep, so he waved his hand and used the supreme rules of the Great Dao to extinguish all the light in Little Lonely Heaven.

Little Lonely Heaven entered the deep night, and it was silent.

Time passed by, and just as Di Qing was about to have a good sleep, he was alerted by an unstable aura.

In the next moment, his figure disappeared and appeared outside the hall. Then, he looked at the side of the hall, where the fluctuation of aura came from.

It was a moonless and windy night, and they were sneaking around.

In the hazy night, a naked figure with a strange luster on its buttocks was climbing up the wall.

“What’s wrong? You have nowhere to vent your energy, so you’re going to run around naked?”

A light inquiry was heard.

The burly man who was climbing the wall did not even turn his head. He subconsciously said, “What business do you have…”

Then, he seemed to have realized something. His body shook and he turned his head stiffly.

Di Qing smiled coldly, raised his fist and punched directly.

…

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and heard the sounds of fighting outside the hall. Then Di Qing appeared in the hall with a mountain-like figure.

After a loud boom, he saw an eye-piercing scene.

In the middle of the hall, a naked burly man was lying on his back. His face was swollen and he had obviously been beaten up.

The corner of Jian Wushuang’s eyes twitched. Although the man’s face was swollen, he could tell at a glance that he was the bald man who had fought with him in the sword discussion dojo not long ago.

“Didn’t I throw this guy out Little Lonely Heaven?”

Di Qing curled his lips. “Who knows? He’s sneakily lying outside the hall. I don’t know what he’s thinking.”

The bald man who had been beaten up by Di Qing shook his head hard, then looked around in a daze.

As soon as he saw Jian Wushuang sitting at the head of the table, his eyes suddenly narrowed. Then, he stood up at a very fast speed and knelt down on one knee. He cupped his hands and shouted, “Feng Shan greets Your Excellency!”

The corner of Jian Wushuang’s eyes twitched again, “You, didn’t I throw you out of Little Lonely Heaven? why are you back? Could it be that you’re not willing to accept your loss?”

When the bald man heard this, he hurriedly waved his hand. “No, no, My Lord, you’ve misunderstood. Feng Shan lost wholeheartedly. The reason why I came back is that I’ve thought it through. From today on, I’ll follow My Lord.”

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows slightly, “You plan to follow me? Why?”

He touched his head and smiled naively. “Since I became a Yan Immortal, you are the only one in the same realm who can beat me so hard that I can’t fight back. So, it’s not embarrassing for Feng Shan to follow you!”

Jian Wushuang laughed. He was obviously amused by this silly guy’s straightforward words. Then, he reached out and took out a casual outfit from his storage ring and threw it to him. “Put on some clothes first.”

The bald man took the clothes and smiled awkwardly, “When I was thrown out, I fainted. When I woke up, I was like this.”

After he put on his clothes, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “Hurry up and go back. I’m a solo ranger. You won’t be able to achieve anything by following me. You’ll only be a burden.”

When he heard this, he hurriedly said, “My Lord, I’m not afraid. As long as I can be by your side, it’s fine. I have sat for many years to achieve my current achievements. Even if I don’t achieve anything great in the future, I’ll be able to travel the world with you!”

Seeing his determined face, Jian Wushuang did not know how to refuse. He could only say, “Why don’t you stay with me for the time being? I won’t stop you if you want to leave in the future.”

Before the bald man could be overjoyed, Di Qing, who was standing beside him, kicked him out of the hall and closed the door.

Jian Wushuang was stunned, “Di Qing, what are you…”

“Why should we bother with such an inflexible fool?” Di Qing clapped his hands. “Once we beat him up twice, I’m sure he’ll stop bothering us.”
