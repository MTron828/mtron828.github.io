The place was in complete isolation from the outside world. It was a boundless crimson land called Sky Sword Prison.

Crimson sky and dark boundless ground, there was a pungent blood smell in the air.

Vroom. A part of the void suddenly distorted and was then followed by a flowing light that erupted from the distorted void. Its speed was extremely swift and it slammed down at the bare mountain.

Bang!

A loud thud, then the mountain exploded entirely as shattered debris dispersed.

Underneath the broken stones, a figure struggled and stood up slowly.

“The owner of Sky Sword Mountain is quite brutal. Luckily, my divine body is extremely strong and I can withstand such strong impact. Otherwise… If I were to be any ordinary Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, from the slam on the mountain, I’d already have lost my skin,” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows as he felt the churning blood in his body.

Very soon, he recovered his body status.

“This is…”

Jian Wushuang looked around as he swept out his Soul Power. He realized that his Soul Power was hindered and the range he covered was barely one fifth of what he could in the outside world.

“This space is extremely strange,” Jian Wushuang muttered and immediately took out a token. He tried to send a message to Hall Master Yuan but the message couldn’t be sent.

He was surprised by that.

He understood that he was in Sky Sword Prison that the owner of Sky Sword Mountain mentioned earlier. As it was a prison, it naturally wouldn’t be an ordinary one. If one could communicate with people in the outside world, it wouldn’t be called a prison.

“I’m in big trouble,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

He never thought that the owner of Sky Sword Mountain would notice during the process of him completing his task and that he would imprison him in Sky Sword Prison.

He had once heard that Sky Sword Prison was an extremely terrifying place during his seventy years in Sky Sword Mountain.

It seemed that most of the people who broke the rules on Sky Sword Mountain would be imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison.

However, the people in the outside world only knew of the existence of the prison. No one knew where the prison was or what would one encounter in the prison.

“Although it’s a troublesome situation, it’s much better than losing my life straightaway. Plus, I already revealed my identity when I was thrown into this prison. Hall Master Yuan should find out that I’m detained from the owner of Sky Sword Mountain very soon and he should be figuring out a way to save me. However, before that, I’ll need to figure a way to stay alive in here,” Jian Wushuang looked around with a solemn look.

He could clearly feel the bloody scent in the air.

Such a pungent bloody scent showed that Sky Sword Prison must be going through a mad massacre all the time.

After he had thought for a while, Jian Wushuang plunged towards a direction.

He was very slow in speed. He didn’t know much about Sky Sword Prison, after all. He naturally didn’t dare to barge in.

Three days later.

“Huh?”

A vague shadow in a luxuriantly grown bush suddenly lifted its head. Through the gaps among the tree leaves, he could see that there was a young man in red robe carrying a sword behind his back appeared in the void above and flew past the top of his head.

“Red robe? Sword?”

“This look, I’ve never seen it.”

“Could he be a newcomer?”

“Jie Jie, here comes the opportunity.”

The vague shadow was overjoyed. He stared at the young man in red robe’s eyes above and he was beaming with excitement too.

The aura all over his body was hidden to its limit and it could be said that it was flawless. Right at that moment, the young man in the red robe flew past the top of his head.

Swoosh!

The vague shadow suddenly plunged like a cheetah.

The speed was too swift. He swept up from the bush below but instantly appeared in the sky a thousand miles above and appeared behind the young man in red robe.

Then, psst!

An extremely sharp claw that could tear the sky suddenly descended and a terrifying murderous intention exploded.

“At such a close distance, this boy will be doomed!” The vague shadow saw that the young man in the red robe couldn’t find him at the first instance and he relaxed.

Just as he slashed the sharp claws at the young man in the red robe, the young man who had been facing him suddenly turned around.

At the moment he turned around, his eyes flashed out a crimson light.

The crimson light was like a crimson sun, extremely harsh to the eye, yet eye-catching.

It was Jian Wushuang’s Eighteen Asura Hell!

One must know that Jian Wushuang had already lit up his Soul Fire and his Soul Power was spread around him all the time. Although the vague shadow had hidden among the bush without any sign, it was almost impossible to hide from the probe of Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power.

Jian Wushuang had noticed the existence of the vague shadow long ago, he hadn’t exposed him.

When the vague shadow launched an attack, he suddenly performed his technique.

The vague shadow saw the crimson sun immediately and suddenly drowned in a phantasmagoria.

“Humph!”

The vague shadow quickly shook off from the dreamland and harumped. He swept out his sharp claws and then continued to explode with action after pausing for just a short while.

“You resisted my Eighteen Asura Hell so easily?” Jian Wushuang was shocked but immediately wielded his sword.

A terrifying sword intention suddenly erupted.

Dang! Dang! Dang!

Jian Wushuang exchanged blows with the vague shadow at lightning speed. In an instant, they had already slashed thrice.

The impact from the three collisions made Jian Wushuang take two steps back but the vague shadow grew imposing and its body turned into a two-meter-tall, golden, exotic beast. The exotic beast used its claws and slashed.

Kacha kacha!

Jian Wushuang could faintly hear that there was an explosive sound in the air. Its terrifying power made Jian Wushuang grow distressed.

“Go away!”

Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword immediately erupted with a terrifying scarlet light. The slight bit of Power of Reincarnation that he had comprehended suddenly flowed into his Sword Principle and increased the power tremendously.

Rumble!

The sword light and the claw collided directly and the two bolts of terrifying power exploded. The golden exotic beast that the vague shadow had turned into flew off from the attack directly.

“Third level?”

Just as the golden exotic beast retreated, it exclaimed in surprise. After he steadied himself, he didn’t hesitate but turned around to run away.

“Want to escape?” Jian Wushuang’s face grew cold and he took out a gold calabash.

Rumble. A large amount of blazing quicksand flowed out and instantly flooded the vast void. The golden exotic beast was engulfed within and the quicksand region immediately took effect.
