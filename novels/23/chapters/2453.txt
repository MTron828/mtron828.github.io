Chapter 2454: Huge Freak

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Yu Aoqing’s deadly perfect strike clearly penetrated Jian Wushuang’s divine body’s surface defenses and went into his flesh. Normally, that should have guaranteed his death.

However, the ultimate death strike was blocked flat out by Jian Wushuang’s rib bone in the end!

How hard was his bone?

“How’s that even possible?” Yu Aoqing’s mind was filled with disbelief.

What she did not know was that the world was filled with wonders.

It may be unbelievable to some people, but for Jian Wushuang...the Primordial Void Celestial Body that he practiced was a top-tier body cultivating secret technique in Ancient God Domain. The secret technique not only upgraded the surface area of his divine body but also included the entire body structure, muscles, divine powers, down to every cell in his body—each of them would have had a huge improvement.

He had succeeded in learning the second volume of the Primordial Void Celestial Body. Adding to the fact that he was a Perfect Chaotic Creature where every part of his body was perfect, therefore his bones were incomparable to a regular cultivator’s.

The bones in his body were definitely not weaker than those under a layer of strong body defense.

As long as his bones were not shattered, it would not bring him any fatal harm.

Yu Aoqing’s perfect ultimate Deathstroke did indeed pose some threat towards Jian Wushuang, but she was still far from being able to kill him.

“I just don’t believe it!”

Yu Aoqing gritted her teeth. Her arrogant self could not accept what just happened before her at all. With her divine powers gushing out of the black dagger and leading it, she immediately swept outwards.

The other side of Jian Wushuang’s chest had exploded into a bloody cave. It was only a bloody cave.

Right at that moment, Jian Wushuang slightly turned his head around.

Boom~~~ Infinite killing intent swept upon Jian Wushuang like a collapsing mountain and tsunami.

Yu Aoqing’s figure was trembling for a while and her mind had a bang.

“Junior Sister, retreat now!”

Long Zishan shouted explosively not far away.

He saw that Jian Wushuang had already unsheathed his sword.

Sword-lights were swept by as a gigantic sword net completely covered Yu Aoqing.

Yu Aoqing suddenly sensed a critical danger like never before filling her mind. She did not dare to hesitate, took out her Safety Token at the first possible moment, and pinched it into pieces.

Ring!

Some lights flashed and Yu Aoqing’s figure vanished right before Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Jian Wushuang had formed the sword net in vain.

“She escaped pretty fast,” spoke Jian Wushuang with his incredibly cold eyes. The bloody cave on the other side of his chest was rejuvenating at a speed noticeable by the bare eyes. Only within the blink of an eye, the blood cave had completely disappeared without leaving a mark.

Jian Wushuang’s aura had also not weakened at all.

Many First-Class Divine Demon disciples besieging him were almost completely dumbfounded.

“Such a perfect, powerful, and terrifying strike had already gone into his body, and yet it did not kill him? His body’s defensive capabilities are so strong?”

“Let’s not even talk about killing him. His aura did not even weaken a bit, it obviously didn’t affect him in any way.”

“That rejuvenating capability... Was that a joke?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“H-huge freak! He is a huge freak!”

One could not blame how stunned they were.

When a normal cultivator—even a Peak Divine Demon—was faced with the perfect ultimate Deathstroke such as that, he would probably die.

Even if he did not die, he would at least be severely injured, and his abilities would have drastically decreased.

However, even though Yu Aoqing had injured Jian Wushuang, he was immediately rejuvenated completely.

He cured his wound in a short moment without the assistance of elixirs, but only relying on his own recuperative abilities.

The terrifying body defensive abilities and rejuvenating abilities made the geniuses on the scene feel like they were living in a dream.

All their hearts were shaken after that occurrence and they even began to wonder if they could ever kill Jian Wushuang.

Their doubts grew bigger by the minute as the intense battles continued.

Especially after another round of continuous fighting, they sensed that Jian Wushuang still remained in his top form. This caused those geniuses to completely lose their confidence.

“Huan Chen, did you notice? Up till now, Jian Wushuang’s divine powers are still at the same level.” Huo Yang came next to Huan Chen.

Huan Chen nodded solemnly. “I saw it. After fighting for such a long period of time, we who attacked him had used up quite a bit of our divine powers, but his divine powers felt infinite while his battle strength did not decrease at all. How can a mere Chaotic Realm cultivator have such limitless divine powers?”

His speed is amazingly fast. His understanding of Space-time Law is incredibly high. He can form up to six different Space-time shadows at once, and the powers of his sword techniques are frighteningly strong. One stroke from him takes at least seven or eight First-Class Divine Demon to collectively resist. Otherwise, it’s impossible to do so. His body’s defensive abilities are even scarier. A perfect strike like that from Yu Aoqing could not kill him. Moreover, his injuries were cured in the blink of an eye with his incomparable rejuvenating abilities. His soul defensive abilities are also pretty strong, such that my soul attack couldn’t pose any threat to him.”

And now, his divine powers also seem infinite...”

Huan Chen and Huo Yang both looked at each other and were unable to hide the shock in their hearts.

They were exclaiming in their minds. What kind of monster exactly were they fighting against?

That monster was grotesquely strong in every aspect that one could not find a weak point at all.

For them, he was impeccable.

If he were to be described in a single word, ‘perfect’ would be it!

Yes, it was ‘perfect’.

A monster. A huge freak, who was perfect and flawless in every way!

“How did such a freak come about?” Huan Chen mumbled.

They did not know that Jian Wushuang was the second Perfect Chaotic Creature within the mortal world.

A Perfect Chaotic Creature was an existence with no weakness, to begin with, and was extremely perfect in every aspect.

Due to the fact that Jian Wushuang was only in the Chaotic Realm, he still could not reach true perfection. However, as long as he broke through to Divine Demon Realm in the future, he would be truly perfect by definition—the only one within Heaven and Earth.

What they had just seen was actually nothing in comparison.

“We had exhausted every existing method. We had used whatever could be used, but we still couldn’t kill him. There’s just no way,” said Huan Chen hopelessly.

Huo Yang who was next to him also nodded.

Those First-class Divine Demons that were attacking Jian Wushuang also looked over.

Whether or not they wanted to admit, the truth was that a total of 50 First-Class Divine Demon who joined hands still could not kill him.

Setting aside killing him with a real strike, they could not even exhaust Jian Wushuang to his death with either their combined divine power or time.

“There’s nothing else to do but to stop.”

“There’s no other way. This Jian Wushuang is really too much of a freak.”

“Let’s forget it. It’s only a waste of time to continue fighting.”

The First-Class Divine Demons exclaimed lightly and one by one stopped their movements, obviously ready to give up.
