Chapter 5075 The Reappearance of Changfu

In the entire Great Si Region, where the Grand Yan Immortals were on the brink of extinction, why did they always appear by Jian Wushuang's side?

Prince Jiu, in his anger, actually calmed himself down. Facing Nan Xuan, who was a Grand Yan Immortal, he no longer clashed head-on but took a step back.

The magnificent meaning of crimson gold slowly dissipated, and the shattered void returned to silence.

Jian Wushuang stood still with his sword in his hand. In front of him, the 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals had disappeared without a trace, not even leaving behind a speck of dust.

In just a moment, 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals were directly erased.

This situation even exceeded his expectations.

But Jian Wushuang quickly realized that this was almost an inevitable outcome.

With the combined attack of Nan Xuan and himself, there was no possibility of survival for the 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals.

Looking at the devastated Heavenly Region planes and void, Jian Wushuang knew that he and Prince Jiu would fight to the death.

Ignoring the prince, Nan Xuan quickly arrived in front of him and said, "Hurry, let's go."

But Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, "You go first; I'll handle things here."

Nan Xuan urged anxiously, "Why are you staying here? It's not wise at this time!"

However, Jian Wushuang remained resolute in signaling him to leave first.

"Then don't blame me," Nan Xuan said, preparing to take action.

"Why bother?" Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly and stopped him. "If we don't leave now, we won't be able to escape."

Nan Xuan raised his voice, "Even if we can't escape, who can harm me?"

The next moment, a more ancient and profound aura awakened without any warning.

That aura transcended the constraints of the current heavenly laws, and the grand celestial laws of the universe began to collapse and shatter.

It was an aura from the Ancient Era!

Sensing the arrival of this aura, Nan Xuan swallowed the rest of his words.

His eyebrows twitched, and he muttered, "Young friend, how much trouble have you truly stirred up..."

Jian Wushuang remained silent, bitterness flashing in his eyes.

Only those terrifying beings from the Ancient Era could crush the Heavenly Dao solely with their aura.

And from that era, the terrifying presence would certainly not be less than Nine Revolutions.

The Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal was an absolute pinnacle existence. Even though Jian Wushuang could slay a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal and even contend against a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, he was utterly powerless when facing a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

Not to mention, those who possessed such an ancient aura were all big shots!

A cruel smile appeared on Prince Jiu's face. A slender figure had appeared behind him. Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Seeing the appearance of that figure, Jian Wushuang's eyes momentarily widened, his gaze filled with incredulity.

That figure left a deep impression on him, and even now, he had not forgotten.

From the Great Mi Heaven, the terrifying presence that destroyed one of Di Qing's True Life single-handedly, Changfu!

That was the presence that had ultimately perished.

But now, the reappearance of Changfu made Jian Wushuang feel as though he had plunged into an icy cave.

Prince Jiu slowly retreated.

Long Fu, dressed in mountain and water robe, nodded slightly and then walked forward at a leisurely pace.

Nan Xuan cleared his throat, his expression somewhat unnatural. As a Grand Yan Immortal, he naturally sensed the formidable aura emanating from Changfu.

He finally understood what Jian Wushuang meant. Even if he wanted to leave now, he couldn't.

They looked at each other from afar. Jian Wushuang did not take a step back when facing Changfu.

"Long time no see." Changfu nodded slightly, giving a friendly gesture.

Although he was a little surprised, he still returned the greeting.

"Di Qing... Is he well?" Changfu asked again.

Jian Wushuang nodded, "Not bad. His injuries have recovered well."

And so, the two of them began to discuss matters with each other.

This left Nan Xuan somewhat dumbfounded, and even Prince Jiu found it hard to keep a straight face.

He said in a deep voice, "Elder Changfu, please eliminate all enemies!"

As the command descended, silence returned to the void.

Jian Wushuang knew that he could not avoid it forever.

An Invisible Sword surrounded by divine glyphs appeared in his hand, the tip of the sword pointing straight at Changfu.

Nan Xuan was shocked. He even felt that this scene was extremely unreal.

A puny little Yan Immortal was actually pointing his sword at a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal?

"It's my duty. Please don't blame me," Changfu said calmly. He raised his finger and then pointed downwards.

In an instant, the void shattered and the Heavenly Dao collapsed.

With just a finger, he broke through all the obstacles and landed on Jian Wushuang.

Splat!

Divine blood splattered, and his chest was completely shattered. He did not even make any effective resistance.

Nan Xuan turned pale with fright and hurriedly tried to help Jian Wushuang up. However, Changfu's attack landed on him again.

Pain, intense pain instantly spread throughout his limbs and bones. Nan Xuan felt his entire back completely shatter, and his Immortal Source was rapidly dissipating.

"Damn it‚Ä¶" Before he could finish his sentence, he fainted.

In just a brief moment, Jian Wushuang became a bloodied figure, utterly devoid of any resistance.

He clung to his unconscious, severely wounded body, struggling to breathe.

Upon witnessing this scene, though Prince?Jiu found it hard to believe, his ecstasy quickly dispelled his doubts.

With the long sword in hand, Prince Jiu decided to kill Jian Wushuang himself!

However, before he could move, Changfu opened his palm again.

Ancient and deathly aura emanated from his palm, causing the vast void to crumble and shatter.

Violent and surging astral winds erupted from the cracks, shredding everything in their path.

Finally, Jian Wushuang's figure was engulfed and consumed by the astral winds of the void, disappearing without a trace.

Prince Jiu exclaimed in shock, "Where's Jian Wushuang?!"

Changfu nodded and said, "He has been torn apart within the chaotic void turbulence."

"No, it can't be! Is he really dead?" Prince Jiu couldn't believe it.

Had this Yan Immortal who he considered his greatest enemy really died so abruptly?

Prince Jiu sought reassurance, "Elder Changfu, is he truly dead, with no possibility of resurrection?"

Changfu nodded, "Your Highness, there is absolutely no possibility. No Yan Immortal can escape my grasp."

Satisfied with the confirmation, Gongzi Jiu nodded and regained his composure, seemingly unaffected by feelings of joy.

"Very well, let's return for now and make further plans later."

After a brief pause at the scene, the forms of Prince Jiu and Changfu eventually vanished into the void.

Once again, all was silent.

In this battle, more than ten of the Heavenly Region Planes were shattered, and the void was riddled with holes.

As far as the eye could see, it was all filled with raging astral winds of chaos.

Yet within this tumultuous and chaotic astral wind, a pair of eyes with a faint golden glint quietly opened.

"Back then, Di Qing spared my life, and that's why I survived. Now, it's time to repay that favor."
