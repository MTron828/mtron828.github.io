Chapter 1501: The Owner Of The Sky Sword Mountain’s Message

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The island that Wu Bei’s cave was situated in was filled with experts.

Atop the island at the highest point of the sky, there was a floating lofty golden hall that was concealed by the Power of Spacetime.

The big hall was filled with many strong auras and every aura was strong enough to earn the respect of Real Gods.

At the highest part of the big hall, there were a total of twenty long, narrow tables. Behind the table sat a figure. For these twenty figures, every single one of them was a super existence who could cause a Sanctuary to shiver with fear with a stamp of their feet. These twenty figures were all Almighties!

Close to twenty Almighties were present in the big hall.

Apart from the Almighties, the remaining people were experts who represented the big forces of every area. This included Lei Chao who represented the Lineage of Star. However, all the experts belonged to the lower part of the big hall.

Many experts were drinking wine and having a conversation at the same time.

At that moment, among the Almighties, the expression of a red-haired old man with one horn on his forehead changed and he laughed: “I have just gotten news that the fifth White Blaze Fruit has appeared and it was obtained by Jian Wushuang of the Lineage of Star.”

Ever since the news of Wu Bei’s cave got out, many Universe Gods started to search for the White Blaze Fruit in the cave. To date, four White Blaze Fruits have been found, and adding the White Blaze Fruit that Jian Wushuang found, there were only a total of five fruits.

The people in the big hall started a discussion immediately.

“Jian Wushuang? From the Lineage of Star?”

“I know about this Jian Wushuang. Previously, he had no reputation. However, four hundred years ago, he defeated Ling Dan who ranked thirty-ninth on the Universe God ranking list with one stroke. After that, he defeated the Seven Planet Palace Master of the Seven Planet Palace. With this, he became famous. Indeed, he has the ability of a top-twenty member of the Universe God ranking list.”

“This little kid has only entered Wu Bei’s cave for a few days. However, he actually obtained a White Blaze Fruit. His luck is not too bad.”

“Lei Chao, Jian Wushuang is part of the Lineage of Star. Since you are currently representing the Lineage of Star, do you have anything to say?”

A good number of experts in the big hall looked toward Lei Chao.

However, Lei Chao said indifferently: “There’s nothing for me to say. If one wishes to get a White Blaze Fruit in Wu Bei’s cave, it is highly dependent on their luck.”

On the surface, Lei Chao said that Jian Wushuang had obtained the White Blaze Fruit due to luck. However, in actual fact, he knew very well that the fact that Jian Wushuang was able to obtain a White Blaze Fruit was not merely due to luck. After all, he knew Jian Wushuang’s real identity where Jian Wushuang was an Inverse Cultivator.

For an Inverse Cultivator, it was much easier for him to search for Iron Wing Beasts in Wu Bei’s cave as compared to the other Universe Gods. Hence his chances of getting White Blaze Fruits would naturally be higher.

“I heard that when Jian Wushuang obtained the White Blaze Fruit, he was seen by a few Universe Gods. Those Universe Gods overestimated themselves and wanted to snatch the White Blaze Fruit away from Jian Wushuang. In the end, they were killed by Jian Wushuang,” the red-haired old man and a few Almighties who were in the highest part of the hall talked and laughed.

“That Jian Wushuang has some connections to me. He has stayed in my Sky Sword Prison for a period of time,” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain who sat with the Almighties spoke.

“Oh?” a few Almighties around the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain looked toward him with interest.

“It was Hall Master Yuan of the Lineage of Star who requested me to imprison him in the Sky Sword Prison. The Lineage of Star even paid a price for this. However, that little kid is indeed quite talented. When he was first imprisoned in the Sky Sword Prison, his abilities were normal within the Sky Sword Prison. Despite that, in just four thousand years, he relied on his own abilities to kill ten Real Gods and came out from the Sky Sword Prison. He is indeed a genius,” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain said.

“In a mere four thousand years?”

“His improvement speed is so fast?”

The Almighties also knew about the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain’s Sky Sword Prison. Hence, they knew very well how frightening Jian Wushuang’s improvement speed was.

However, they were only slightly surprised and not too concerned.

To them who stood at the top, Jian Wushuang was just a little kid at the level of Universe God. No matter how talented he was, he would be unable to draw their attention unless it was someone under them.

They only mentioned Jian Wushuang at that moment because they were having a random conversation to pass time.

“Lei Chao,” the eyes of the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain looked down.

“Your Lord,” Lei Chao greeted him with a bow immediately.

“Previously, Jian Wushuang requested me to release an expert who was imprisoned in the Sky Sword Prison but I declined. However, now, tell him that he can release whoever he wants as long as he brings me two White Blaze Fruits,” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain said.

Lei Chao’s expression changed.

The Almighties around the area looked toward the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain in succession.

“Sky Sword, isn’t that too much?”

“That’s right. Could it be that you imprisoned a Real God of the second stage in the Sky Sword prison? Even if that were the case, a Real God of the second stage is not worth two White Blaze Fruits. At best, one White Blaze Fruit should be enough.”

“Sky Sword, you are a bit too greedy.”

A few Almighties spoke in succession.

“Everyone,” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain looked at everyone around him and said with a laugh, “Everyone should be able to tell that the fight for the White Blaze Fruit this time round is not as simple as we think. It has only just begun and five White Blaze Fruits have appeared already. If I’m not wrong, when the fight ends, at least fifty or even more White Blaze Fruits will appear!”

“For so many White Blaze Fruits to appear in such a short period of time, the price of the White Blaze Fruit will naturally not be as shocking as it was in the past.”

“That makes sense,” The Almighties around the area agreed in succession.

Items were only expensive as they were rare. Previously, it was extremely rare to come across a White Blaze Fruit even after many years. Hence, the White Blaze Fruit would naturally be extremely precious.

However, if tens of White Blaze Fruits were to appear in a short period of time, the White Blaze Fruits would naturally be not worth as much.

Even though the White Blaze Fruits were not worth as much, they were still very valuable and it was enough for Almighties like them to have their eyes on it. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Lei Chao, send a message to that little kid as per what I have said. Of course, in the end, it will depend on how many White Blaze Fruits that little kid obtains. In short, no matter how many White Blaze Fruits he obtains in Wu Bei’s cave, I only need two of them,” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain said with a laugh.

“That’s more like it,” all the Almighties beside him agreed in succession.

Lei Chao nodded his head and started to transmit a message to Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang.”

“Lord Lei Chao,” Jian Wushuang, who was in Wu Bei’s cave, replied immediately.

“I heard that you already obtained your first White Blaze Fruit?” Lei Chao questioned.

“Yes, I have obtained it. Lord Lei Chao, you managed to get this piece of news so quickly?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Haha. At the moment, the experts of many big forces of the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries are all gathered together, including many of the Almighties. As soon as a new White Blaze Fruit appears, we will get the news immediately,” Lei Chao said with a laugh.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Jian Wushuang, the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain is among the Almighties who have come and he requested that I pass you a message.”
