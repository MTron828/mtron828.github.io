Chapter 2072 King Chen Xing

“He only needed one move to defeat Zhan Cang?” King Luo Yu widened his eyes.

The surrounding Ancient Gods looked over at King Gu You in disbelief.

Zhan Cang was a legit Nine-star Ancient God.

Even King Luo Yu could not defeat him in one move.

“Even though Sword Emperor is an Eight-star Ancient God, his true power is much greater than that of most Nine-star Ancient Gods. There is a reason why he decided to meet King Chen Xing alone. Everyone, don’t worry for his safety,” King Gu You said.

“So this is why Jian Wushuang dared to go alone,” King Luo Yu heaved a sigh of relief. “However, King Chen Xing is already a stage two ancient god. He is not easy to deal with. If anything unexpected happens, we will help him immediately.”

“Yes,” the ancient gods around nodded their heads.

Jian Wushuang appeared at the foot of estate.

“Who is that!?”

A stern voice shouted.

Jian Wushuang did not halt. He smiled and continued walking.

Right when he was about to enter the estate, an aura of bloodline power many times purer than that of a royal ancient god burst forth from Jian Wushuang. It felt like a dragon was awakening as the aura filled the entire atmosphere. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Many of the ancient gods, including those from the various clans and the different masters of the various cities, felt pressured to submit and bow down to their new emperor. All of them were caught by surprise.

“That is the aura of an emperor!!”

“What King Luo Yu said was true! Someone with the bloodline of emperors was born!!”

“A new emperor…”

Everyone within the estate were boiling with curiosity as many ancient gods flew out. The entire place was densely packed within moments.

Everyone was looking at the young man who was walking towards the centre of the estate.

Jian Wushuang placed his hands behind his back as he looked around and said with dignity, “Who dares to stop me?”

This simple sentence forced many ancient gods to lower their heads.

Those who tried to stop Jian Wushuang stepped aside without hesitation.

Within the Ancient God Clan, bloodline is supreme. This concept was definitely true in this clan.

They had only heard from King Luo Yu that there had been a human born with the bloodline of emperor and they should support him in becoming the new emperor.

They chose to support King Chen Xing because the new emperor was human. Furthermore, they could not confirm the claim as they had not met Jian Wushuang before.

Once these Ancient Gods felt the aura of bloodline of emperors themselves, their doubts disappeared.

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang in an excited and passionate manner.

The one who possessed the bloodline of emperors was their emperor.

Even though the blood of a human flowed through his veins, this couldn’t change the fact that he too possessed the bloodline of emperors.

Every Ancient God moved out of the way and no one dared to stop Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang walked successfully to the center of the estate and stopped in front of the most majestic palace.

Within the palace, a three meter tall man in silver body armor stood up slowly.

Behind the silver armor man was another man whose body was as big as a gorilla’s. This man was King Zhan Cang. He had been defeated in a battle against Jian Wushuang.

“Are you, King Chen Xing?” Jian Wushuang stared at the man in silver body armor and asked coldly.

“Sword Emperor, you are a courageous man. You dare to venture here alone. Do you really think that your bloodline power will save you?” King Chen Xing said as he stared back coldly.

Before Jian Wushaung could reply, an Eight-star Ancient God, who also happened to be a master of a king city, spoke. “King Chen Xing, according to the law of the Ancient Clan, we should support Jian Wushuang in becoming the new emperor as he possesses the bloodline of emperors. I hope you can…”

Before the Eight-star Ancient God finished his sentence…

“Keep quiet!”

King Chen Xing bellowed fiercely and stared at the Eight-star Ancient God as the Ancient God was forced into silence.

“Within the Ancient God Clan, there will only be one emperor, and that will be my father. He is of paramount importance within the clan. On the other hand, so what if Jian Wushuang possess the bloodline power of emperor? At the end of the day, he is still a human. Who gave him the right to be the emperor of the Ancient God Clan?” King Chen Xing questioned coldly as his voice reverberated through the air.

The ancient gods around kept quiet after hearing this.

“King Chen Xing, I’m going to ask you one last time. Are you going to submit?” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Submit? Haha. Me? Submitting to a mere human like you?” King Chen Xing started laughing as though he had just heard the funniest joke in the world.

“Are you not going to? If that’s the case then do not blame me for what’s going to happen.” Jian Wushuang focused his vision on King Chen Xing and leaped forth.

Boom!

The void beneath Jian Wushuang’s feet exploded into pieces.

Surging waves of divine power and bloodline power radiated from Jian Wushaung.

At that moment, Jian Wushaung pointed his finger.

Heaven and earth trembled as a mirage of an Ancient God tens of thousands feet tall appeared behind Jian Wushaung, copying his stance. At the tip its finger, a ball of diving power started to concentrate, glowing dark green.

“It’s this move again.”

King Zhan Cang, who was standing behind King Chen Xing, widened his eyes and hints of fear could be seen in them.

King Zhan Cang had been defeated easily using this move back when he had ‘invited’ Jian Wushaung using force.

Now Jian Wushaung had used the same move and attacked King Chen Xing.

“Humph!”

King Chen Xing grunted as he started to boil with divine power. His aura grew to a peak instantly.

He was different from King Zhan Cang.

King Zhan Cang had only reached the level of a Nine-star Ancient God recently.

However, King Chen Xing had been at the peak of a Nine-star Ancient God for a very long time. His fighting power was that of a stage two great emperor back in the first era. He was much stronger than King Zhan Cang.

“Jian Wushuang, you are asking for it,” King Chen Xing said coldly. Upon finishing his sentence, he too channeled his divine power and attacked.

He too used the Ancient God’s Ninth Finger, the Ultimate Finger. The power was at least ten times stronger than when King Zhan Cang had performed the same move.

The two fingers collided head on.

Heaven and earth rumbled fiercely. The void shattered as the limitless amount of divine power gushed violently in all directions.

In the end, both fingers disintegrated into nothingness after the intense collision.
