4538 The End of the Catastrophe Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the vast universe.

Jian Wushuang stepped on an escape light and quickly rushed toward the Offworld Battlefield.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived at the base camp with his full strength.

Jian Wushuang had only left the base camp for a few months, but the entire base camp was filled with a bleak aura and everyone had a heavy look on their faces.

!!

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could not help frowning. Could it be that something had happened during the few months that he had been away?

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang strode into Cosmos God’s hall.

The current Jian Wushuang was the only person who could freely enter and exit Cosmos God’s hall apart from the two great disciples of Cosmos God.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re back.” Cosmos God nodded at Jian Wushuang.

He still looked the same as when Jian Wushuang first met him, gentle and kind, with a smile on his face. However, Jian Wushuang could see deep fatigue on his face.

“Jian Wushuang, what’s the situation? Did the Fengtian Patriarch lend you the Fengtian Flag?”

Cosmos God asked after gathering his spirit.

“I didn’t fail you.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He flipped his right hand and a little black flag appeared in his hand.

“Alright!”

Upon seeing this, the eyes of Cosmos God lit up and he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

With the Fengtian Flag, he had some confidence in the battle of the catastrophe.

After a moment of silence, Cosmos God said, “Jian Wushuang, I have bad news for you.”

Without beating around the bush, Cosmos God continued, “In the past two months, many Void Warriors from the Void Universe have come out of the cracks in the void. In the short span of a month, nearly ten battles have broken out. The friction between us and the cracks in the void is getting bigger and bigger. I guess that the battle of Great Catastrophe may break out at any time!”

“What? So fast?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Even though he had already made preparations to deal with the battle of Great Catastrophe, when the battle really came, he still felt a little dazed.

“Therefore, Jian Wushuang, please hurry back to the Void Universe and wait for my orders!”

“Once the Great Catastrophe War begins and the core power of the Void Universe attacks our universe, I’ll send you an order. At that time, you can use the Fengtian Flag to set up a sealing formation in their Void Forbidden Land and cut off their escape!”

Cosmos God said with a solemn expression.

“Yes!” Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded his head and his face also became serious.

The magnetic fields and nomological laws of the two universes were not connected, which meant that after the people of the Void Universe attacked the Divine Power Universe, they would consume void power and would not be replenished.

In the past, the reason why the Void Warriors of the Void Universe were so difficult to deal with during the Great Catastrophe War was that they would return to the Void Universe to replenish their energy once they were no match for the enemy or were exhausted. Then, they would attack again.

Once Jian Wushuang set up the Fengtian Flag in the void crack of the forbidden void land and blocked the 87th void crack, he would be able to cut off their escape route and divide the Void Warriors of the Void Universe.

At that time, under the leadership of Cosmos Gods, they would be able to obliterate them even if they had to spend a lot of time and effort.

The Void Universe was a level higher than the Divine Power Universe, both individually and as a whole.

In this case, the Divine Power Universe needed to reverse the outcome and turn the defeat into victory, which was the best countermeasure!

And Jian Wushuang played the most important role!

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang walked out of the hall with large strides.

When they arrived at the entrance of Cosmos God’s hall.

Jian Wushuang seemed to have thought of something. He tore off a corner of his clothes with his right hand and wrote a few lines of words with his hand as a pen.

“Lord Cosmos God, if I do not return alive this time, please help me pass this piece of cloth to my wife, Leng Rushuang.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and flicked his finger. The piece of cloth immediately fell into the hands of Cosmos God.

Upon hearing this, Cosmos God could not help but be stunned.

He wanted to say something to comfort him, but in the end, he only sighed and nodded.

If Jian Wushuang wanted to cut off the Void Universe’s escape route, he had to go deep into the Void Forbidden Land. The hope of survival was very small.

Jian Wushuang and Cosmos Gods understood this point.

After leaving the base camp, Jian Wushuang set off again to the crack in the void.

This time, Supreme Gongyang did not go back to the Void Universe. Instead, he stayed in the Divine Power Universe and waited for the war to break out to help.

Jian Wushuang would be alone in the Void Universe and start a different kind of battle.

…

He arrived at the Offworld Battlefield.

Right now, the ones in charge of guarding the battlefield were Teams 6 and 7.

The two team leaders seemed to have received the news from Cosmos Gods a long time ago. They did not ask much about Jian Wushuang’s intention to go to the Void Universe and only told Jian Wushuang to be careful.

At that moment, there was a war going on in the Offworld Battlefield. Therefore, Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry to step into the crack in the void. Instead, he waited for the battle to end.

Human-faced spiders the size of small mountains crawled out of the cracks in the void. They were so dense that they filled the entire sky.

Fortunately, although these human-faced spiders were large in number, they were not individually strong. The strongest among them was only at the Ultimate Ruler realm.

As a result, the members of Team 6 and Team 7 had an easy time.

According to what Supreme Blacksource had said, these human-faced spiders were not intelligent entities. They had most likely been created by some major power in the Void Universe in order to observe and test the power of the Divine Power Universe.

A moment later, the one-sided slaughter came to an end.

Human-faced spiders the size of small mountains fell from the sky like rain. The universe was filled with the broken limbs, flesh, and blood of the human-faced spiders.

The battle was over and it was time for Jian Wushuang to leave.

...

Supreme Blacksource looked at Jian Wushuang with a complicated expression.

The Junior who had just entered the Supreme realm was now shouldering the heavy responsibility of the life and death of the universe.

“Jian Wushuang, I will wait for your safe return,” Supreme Blacksource said in a low voice.

Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile and replied with two words.

“For sure!”

Then, Jian Wushuang stepped into the void crack without hesitation.

Jian Wushuang’s black-robed figure was gradually swallowed by the black-hole-like crack.

No one had discovered it.

A strange red light flashed in the eyes of a human-faced spider corpse that had been dead for a long time, leaving only its head.

The image of Jian Wushuang stepping into the crack in the void was formed in his compound eyes.

At the same time.

...

In the Void Universe, in the Void Forbidden Land, in a cave in the 87th crack.

A statue-like ancient figure covered in mud, sitting cross-legged in the depths of the cave, slowly opened his eyes.

“Eh? Someone has entered the Void Universe?”
