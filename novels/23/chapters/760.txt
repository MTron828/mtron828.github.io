Chapter 761: Assembly Sites

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Among those who were still adventuring in the Tianqi Mountains, only two of them held Ancient God Tokens.

Those two were Jian Wushuang and Gu Heng.

By using the token, they could quickly gather together the nearby clansmen. It was normally only used in an emergency.

And at this time, Jian Wushuang used it.

Immediately, many clansmen raced toward Jian Wushuang at maximum speed.

In less than half a day, about 150 people were gathered in front of him, ready to receive his orders.

Even Gu Heng arrived there, having left as soon as he got the signal sent out by the token.

Gu Heng went up to Jian Wushuang and said, “Jian Wushuang, I thought you were in danger when I received your signal. I really got a shock.”

On hearing these words, Jian Wushuang gave him a smile.

“Tell me, what’s going on here?” Gu Heng asked.

He thought that there had to be a reason for this.

“I’ve killed some outsiders during the last several days and got a map from their Interspatial Rings. I think some of the places marked on it should be their temporary assembly sites.” Jian Wushuang explained it to them.

? ?“Oh? Their assembly sites?”

Gu Heng’s eyes lit up when hearing this news, and he hurriedly continued, “I knew that they have some assembly sites on this mountain, but I failed to discover them.

“One reason is that the mountain is so vast that there are many places that can be where their sites are located.

“The other reason is that those outsiders are so cunning that they will frequently change their assembly sites. That brought us a lot of trouble.

“Because most of the outsiders memorize the locations of the sites in their mind, I think this map must belong to those who have never been here before and are unfamiliar with the topography. Therefore, they are usually more careful than other outsiders, so it will not be easy to kill them.

“Besides, most of our clansmen don’t know what to do with the map, only we commanders know its value.

“Throughout the many long years that we’ve been fighting the outsiders, only one time did we get a map from them.

“At that time, we found their assembly sites according to the map, set an ambush, and struck them hard.

“Therefore, Jian Wushuang, if we can find their assembly sites this time, we can set another ambush and strike them like before.”

After saying those words, Gu Heng looked at Jian Wushuang with sparkling eyes.

“Great. That’s what I’m considering now and it’s the reason why I’ve gathered all of you here,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile. Then, with a flick of his hand, he took out the map, which had been combined from two maps into one. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the combined map, there were 13 places marked in total.

Seven of them were the assembly sites of Cloud Sea Asgard, the rest of them were the assembly sites of the Boundless Demon Sect.

“There are so many places marked on it,” Gu Heng cried out excitedly while scanning the map. “If those marks really represent their assembly sites, we…”

“Certainly, they do.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Based on his knowledge of Cloud Sea Asgard and the Boundless Demon Sect, he could tell that the assembly sites were really there.

“Normally, there will be two or three outsiders gathered at each assembly site. So, to prevent them from fleeing from us, we will go to those locations in groups that consist of one Silver-armored Ancient God as the leader along with 10 clansmen.

“And when we get there, we must hide our aura until the outsiders are all there. Then, we will kill them directly.”

“Good idea. But, I think 12 groups are enough, so we can have more members in each group. As for their last assembly site, I’ll deal with it by myself,” Gu Heng said with a grin.

“By yourself?” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised, but he stilled nodded his approval.

He knew that Gu Heng was powerful enough to destroy a group of Eternal Realm experts.

At that moment, he even mourned for the people in the assembly site that Gu Heng was going to visit.

Having arrived at a plan, Jian Wushuang started to implement it.

Among the 150 clansmen in front of him, some of them were as powerful as Eternal Realm experts at the first level, some of them were as powerful as experts at the second level, and some of them, such as Gu Yang, were even close to the experts at the third level.

Jian Wushuang divided those people into 12 teams, with 12 people in each team, and had them head for the 12 assembly sites out of the 13.

Gu Heng would go to last assembly site alone.

Watching the clansmen march away, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Cloud Sea Asgard and Boundless Demon Sect, wait for my gift for you!

“As for Immortal Dynasty, I won’t destroy you, but I won’t let you go easily either.”?

…

The Tianqi Mountains was a dangerous place for the experts from the Firmament Territory, and when they encountered a stronger group of clansmen from the Ancient God Clan, they would choose to flee separately.

In such cases, they would have to go back to their assembly sites to find their companions later, as they had no other way to connect with each other in the mountains.

As a result, those assembly sites meant a lot to them.

Five days had passed since the Eternal Zone had opened.

In the middle of a hill, two experts from the Boundless Demon Sect were hiding inside a cave.

Before long, another expert of the sect arrived in the cave.

Since the three of them had found each other, they decided to leave the hill to adventure in other places.

And right then, a disaster took place!
