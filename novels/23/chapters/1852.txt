Chapter 1853: Testing Out

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After hearing Hall Master Yuan’s question, Emperor God Zhu Long became stunned and he laughed: “To tell you the truth, I have come this time around to look for the Star Palace Master.”

“Look for the Star Palace Master?” the hearts of the three Hall Masters moved.

Since Emperor God Zhu Long had come at such a time to pay a visit to them, it would definitely be not without any reason.

Looking at it then, Emperor God Zhu Long had come just to test out the situation. He had wanted to get a feel of the situation in the Lineage of Star and also to find out if the Star Palace Master had really died.

Although they were certain about this in their hearts, Hall Master Yuan was expressionless on the surface and he said: “Emperor God Zhu Long, you should know that the Ancient Mystery Land opened not long ago. As such, our Palace Master has been staying there over the past few years and to date, he has still not returned yet.”

“It’s alright that he has not returned yet. It will be fine as long as he fulfills the matter that he promised me back then,” Emperor God Zhu Long said.

“The matter that he promised you? When and what did our Palace Master promise you?” Hall Master Yuan was still indifferent.

“Not long ago, before he entered the Ancient Mystery Land, he had once asked some experts and I to help him deploy a formation. As a condition, he promised to let us into the Scripture Depository of the Lineage of Star to cultivate the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Do you know of this matter?” Emperor God Zhu Long asked with a stern expression.

“What?” Hall Master Yuan’s expression changed.

At the same time, he knew immediately that Emperor God Zhu Long was definitely lying.

To the Star Palace Master, the Secret Skill of Star Palace was extremely important and he would absolutely not promise Emperor God Zhu Long that he could cultivate it.

The reason why Emperor God Zhu Long dared to say this then was because it was nothing but a form of test.

Since no one was able to contact the Star Palace Master then, no matter what he said, it could not be confirmed.

“Emperor God Zhu Long, I am unable to contact our Palace Master now. Hence, I do not know if there is really such a matter. Hence, are you able to wait for another period of time for our Palace Master to come out from the Ancient Mystery Land? By then, it will still not be too late for you to come again,” Hall Master Yuan laughed.

“Wait for another period of time? I do not have the time and energy to continue waiting,” Emperor God Zhu Long’s expression turned grave. “The Star Palace Master promised me that a long time ago. No matter what, I want to cultivate that Secret Skill of Star Palace today.”

“I’m sorry, before the Palace Master returns, it is impossible for me to let you go to the Scripture Depository,” Hall Master Yuan said right away.

“Hmph, this is the way your Lineage of Star treats a guest?” Emperor God Zhu Long gave a cold snort, slammed the table and jumped up in anger. His voice was filled with fury and the most important thing was that with his Divine Power, his voice spread across the whole Lineage of Star and a large number of expert disciples in the Lineage of Star heard the cold snort.

In no time, the Lineage of Star burst into an uproar.

“What’s going on?”

“This voice is the same as the expert called Zhu Long from before and it should be from the expert who came to pay a visit to the Lineage of Star. However, looking at it, his discussion with the Hall Masters is not going well.”

Quite a number of Deacon Elders and disciples headed toward the constellation.

Such a scene had caused the expressions of Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun to turn ugly.

Just then…

“Emperor God Zhu Long, right? You really have a short temper.”

All of a sudden, an ice-cold voice could be heard and it reverberated across the universe. After that, a young man who carried a sword on his back walked over slowly.

“It’s Hall Master Wushuang!”

“Hall Master Wushuang has come.”

When the Deacon Elders and the disciples of the Lineage of Star saw Jian Wushuang, they revealed scorching-hot expressions in succession.

Those Deacon Elders and disciples still did not know of the news that the Star Palace Master had died. As such, they naturally did not know that Jian Wushuang had already become the new Palace Master. Thus, they still addressed Jian Wushuang as Hall Master Wushuang.

Upon seeing the person who had come, all the anger that Emperor God Zhu Long possessed originally dissipated at once.

“Sword Emperor,” Emperor God Zhu Long wore a smile.

After all, Hall Master Yuan and the other two Hall Masters were Sir Gods and he did not need to care about them. However, Jian Wushuang was ranked thirtieth in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Hence, he did not dare to be furious in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang shot a glance toward Emperor God Zhu Long. After that, his body turned vague and he appeared at the highest point of the hall. His ice-cold eyes then looked at Emperor God Zhu Long, “No matter what our Palace Master promised you before, you will still need to wait for our Palace Master to return to the Lineage of Star first. Moreover, after it has been confirmed, you will be able to get your reward. Before that, you had better wait quietly.”

“I was too impatient,” Emperor God Zhu Long laughed with embarrassment, “However, after another hundreds of years, I will need to make a trip to the Second Lair, which is quite dangerous. Before that, I hoped to obtain the Secret Skill of Star Palace to help myself stay alive. If I were to wait for the Star Palace Master to come back from the Ancient Mystery Land, it would obviously be too late. Hence…”

“How about this: Sword Emperor, is it possible for you to tell me the current location of the Star Palace Master? I will go to the Ancient Mystery Land personally to look for him and then get him to send a message back. Is that alright?”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang laughed with ridicule, “What a joke. Our Palace Master has just obtained a great opportunity and he is at the most critical stage. At this point of time, why would I tell you his current location? Emperor God Zhu Long, you really know how to imagine the wildest things.”

“Even if he is in a critical stage, transmitting a message is as easy as blinking an eye and it will absolutely not affect him. Sword Emperor, since you are unwilling to tell me his current location, could it be that the Vientiane Tower’s guess is right and that the Star Palace Master… has already died?” Emperor God Zhu Long’s eyes had a strange expression and he was staring at Jian Wushuang.

Similarly, his words were spread intentionally using his Divine Power and they reverberated across the whole Lineage of Star. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

In particular, the last few words resounded repeatedly and they did not dissipate even after a long time.

When the Deacon Elders and the large number of disciples in the Lineage of Star heard that, all of them were stunned.

“Palace Master has died?”

“Is this real or fake?”

Many Deacon Elders and disciples became dumbfounded.

As for Jian Wushuang, his expression turned cold abruptly and his eyes were filled with murderous intent.

“You’re courting death!”

With a cry, three brilliant rays of golden light appeared at the same time.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

The moment the three rays of golden light appeared, they changed into a golden rainbow, pierced the void and appeared in front of Emperor God Zhu Long.

“Not good,” Emperor God Zhu Long’s expression changed greatly.

His motive this time around for coming was to get a feel of the situation in the Lineage of Star. He had never thought of fighting head-on with Jian Wushuang, who had a mighty name.

Moreover, he recognized the three rays of golden light. They were the three Hong Jun Golden Swords, the treasures that the Sword Emperor was famous for.

Rumble~~~ Powerful Divine Power burst forth. In a dangerous situation, Emperor God Zhu Long unleashed his full power. His big hands were covered with a great amount of flames and he unleashed three palm attacks in succession instantly.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Three booming sounds could be heard in succession and every booming sound was accompanied by the appearance with a giant black hole.

After the booming sound…”Puff!” Emperor God Zhu Long spit out a mouthful of blood wildly.
