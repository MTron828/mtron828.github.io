The Eighth Lair was extremely dangerous.

Jian Wushuang could only enter the last eighth lair to wander.

“Let’s go in,”

After a deep breath, Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and took a huge stride into the black hole in the front.

Passing through the obstacles, Jian Wushuang continued to move forward. He spent about half a month’s time to reach the other end of the black hole.

It was a world of darkness.

There wasn’t any sunlight, nor any light in the world. The dark earth and dark mountain to the river of the world were all black.

In the void, black mist filled the air. The black mist brought about a pungent smell than made one sick.

“This black mist, I heard it is poisonous. If an ordinary Void Real God stays in this world for a few years, I reckon he will be poisoned to death while an Eternal Real God could stay for a long while, a thousand years at most. Only a Chaotic Real God could survive in this world,” Jian Wushuang said.

Of course, his ultimate divine body was also at Chaotic Real God level. Hence, he would be able to survive there.

Jian Wushuang took huge strides and plunged forward slowly.

His soul power was released entirely and he saw everything in his surroundings.

“Just as Hall Master Yuan had said. The Eighth Lair is a total den of monsters. Any ordinary flowers and plants won’t exist in here. Only in black land and black mountain,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He plunged for more than a hundred miles. Every place he passed was in total darkness and barren.

Just then…

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised and he quickly flew downwards to the ground.

On the black land, Jian Wushuang immediately noticed a strange strength spread from his feet. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Even the ground contained the power of corrosion?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked at the magical creature before him.

The magical creature had a human-sized body. It also had a pair of hands and legs and a head. The only difference from a human was that their bodies were extremely black. There were even places with faint black scales. On their heads, there was no nose but only an eye and a huge mouth. Their mouths revealed crimson, sharp teeth too.

“This is the Star Demon Clan in Eight Lair?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

Star Demon Clan was the property of the eighth lairs.

In other words, the Eight Lairs were the eight lairs of Star Demon Clan.

There was only one type of living thing in the Eight Lairs. Besides the human experts who came to wander, there was only one other living thing, which was Star Demon Clan.

It was a special tribe that embodied terror and destruction in one.

It wasn’t human, nor was it an exotic beast. It belonged to magical creatures!

The main purpose of the human experts who came to wander in the Eight Lair, was to exterminate these magical creatures!

“On the Star Demon’s head, there isn’t any horn. It should have yet to turn into an adult,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Before he departed, he asked Hall Master Yuan for information about Star Demon.

He knew that Star Demon grew up at a shocking speed while an adult Star Demon was extremely powerful. One could tell they were adults from their body structure.

As long as they were adult Star Demons, there would be horns on their heads and the number of horns varied while their power varied too.

Just when Jian Wushuang appeared on the black land, the Star Demon noticed Jian Wushuang. There was immediately crimson in its eyes.

“Cultivator… eat, eat!”

Simple and immature words fell from its mouth. Then, there was black flowing light that burst out instantly.

The speed was much faster than an ordinary Void Real God.

Of course, the speed was nothing before Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang harrumped coldly but never drew out his sword. He merely glanced at the Star Demon once.

“Eat, eat!”

The Star Demon continued to mutter but its eyes closed slowly as his body fell on the ground. Then, it wasn’t breathing anymore.

Star Demon was also a living thing. Although they weren’t intelligent, they had consciousness. As they had consciousness, Jian Wushuang’s soul attack could be put to use.

“Star Demons who have yet to turn into an adult, their power is really weak,” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

He could tell that the Star Demon before him, although it exploded at a speed faster than an ordinary Void Real God, its power was only equal to a peak Universe God at most.

Only when Star Demon turned into an adult and grew horns on its head, its fighting power would only then be compared favorably with a human Void Real God.

Jian Wushuang took a stride forward and came before the dead body of the Star Demon. He stole a glance at the dead body. Jian Wushuang quivered his hand and the Star Demon immediately turned into crimson fog while the crimson fog displayed a creepy black that gave people the chill down one’s spine.

“No demon spirit?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows slightly.

Star Demon was a kind of magical creature. In Eternal Chaotic World, it was known as the biggest alternative.

As a magical creature, its body contained an extremely unique substance, which was the demon spirit.

The Demon spirit was an extremely unique power. To human cultivators, it was extremely useful. The stronger the Star Demon’s power, the more and the purer the demon spirit it contained. Especially those who were adults Star Demon with horns, the demon spirits in their bodies already formed a demon core. The demon core was precious. In Eternal Chaotic World, a low-grade demon core would be valued at two to three Doctrine Gems.

Then, the Star Demon that Jian Wushuang had killed was obviously a Star Demon who was nurtured not long ago. There wasn’t any demon spirit in its body.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t do anything about it either.

Then, he continued his journey again and plunged forward.

The Eighth Lair was really huge. Even when it was compared to human’s cultivation sanctuaries, the size was vastly different.

In a huge lair, there were Star Demons all over the place.

There were Star Demons everywhere. Some appeared alone and some appeared in a group. The Star Demons shared the same character. They liked to eat. Even between Star Demons themselves, they often ate one another. After a Star Demon ate another Star Demon, it received the other’s demon core or demon spirit. In turn, its power would increase.

Of course, their favorite food was human cultivators!

Hence, in the Eighth Lair, as soon as the Star Demons saw human cultivators, they would swarm over but didn’t care how strong the human was. Even when they saw the human cultivator kill all of its own kind surrounding it, it wouldn’t retreat or escape.
