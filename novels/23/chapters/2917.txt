“Leave Shuang Er behind, or all of you will die!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes had turned scarlet as if he was a demon from hell. He stared at the nine people from the Supreme Emotion Valley, and his voice also came from the nine serenities hell.

“What kind of monster is this guy? His soul has been destroyed, but he is still alive?” The cold and arrogant woman was also shocked.

“I don’t believe it.” The blue-clothed woman shouted, and then she attacked again.

The same majestic soul power directly burst out, and this power once again covered Jian Wushuang.

Previously, Jian Wushuang’s soul was protected by the exquisite pagoda, but now the exquisite pagoda had collapsed and could not be repaired in a short period. In the face of the soul attack of the blue-clothed woman, there was no room for struggle at all.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang’s real soul was once again killed and destroyed.

This time, everyone was focused on staring at Jian Wushuang.

They could feel that Jian Wushuang’s soul power had indeed wholly disappeared.

However, in just a moment, buzz!

Jian Wushuang’s soul power rose at a terrifying speed and quickly recovered to its peak.

At this moment, everyone understood.

Monster!

Jian Wushuang was indeed a monster.

A monster that had exceeded entirely common sense and could even recover from soul destruction in an instant!

How could Immortal Saints like them kill such a monster?

“I’ll say it one last time. Leave Shuang Er behind!”

“Don’t force me!”

Jian Wushuang shouted sternly.

“Don’t force you?” The cold-arrogant woman said in a deep voice, “Kid, I admit that you’re very strange. But, of course, we can’t kill you, but don’t think that we can’t do anything to you? We can’t kill you, but we can suppress you!”

As the cold and arrogant woman spoke, she flipped her hand, and an ancient black tower appeared in her hand.

This black tower gave off a unique aura, but this black tower should be a sacred treasure from the power it gave off!

“Sacred treasure, and it’s scarce a suppression-type sacred treasure!”

“Suppression-type sacred treasure? Isn’t this even rarer than a domain-type sacred treasure?”

The experts from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were all shocked. Yet, at the same time, they could not help but exclaim in admiration. As expected of the Supreme Emotion Valley, their methods were truly impressive.

Although the nine people who came this time were only at the Immortal Saint-level, these Immortal Saints were not just terrifyingly strong individually. They had all sorts of methods.

Material attacks, soul attacks, and now this cold and arrogant woman had taken out a suppression-type sacred treasure.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion could not compare to her ability.

“Boy, I’ll suppress you first. Then I’ll take you back to my Supreme Emotion Valley and let my Valley Master and Elders deal with you. There are many experts in our Supreme Emotion Valley, so we’ll naturally have ways to deal with you and your background. We also have ways to figure out your background. Now, you’d better go in.”

The cold-arrogant woman sneered. She waved her hand, and the pitch-black tower in her hand instantly rushed out and appeared in the void above Jian Wushuang.

Then, the black tower suddenly enlarged and turned into a tall black tower. There were a lot of secret patterns at the bottom of the tower. At this moment, these secret patterns had been activated, and in the blink of an eye, a huge black hole appeared there. Countless black air currents were crazily binding Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stood there and looked up at the black tower, but his body was slightly trembling.

“I don’t want to be enemies with your Supreme Emotion Valley, but today, you forced me to!”

Jian Wushuang let out a roar, which was hysterical and echoed in the world.

The moment the roar fell, boom!

Without any warning, a unique but supreme pressure suddenly burst out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

This pressure was not the pressure of divine power, aura, or mighty divine power, but the pressure of life and supreme beings.

This pressure rose from Jian Wushuang’s body and swept across the nine heavens and ten lands instantly, sweeping across all directions.

The heaven and earth shook in an instant, and the vast space around them began to tremble crazily.

A fierce wind also rose, bringing all things in the world to worship Jian Wushuang at this moment.

Heaven and earth completely fell silent.

The cold and arrogant woman of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, Zi Yi, the blue-clothed woman, the nine Immortal Saints, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s Saint Hong, Long Xingzi, Chu Yong, and many other experts, as well as countless disciples, all stared at Jian Wushuang with wide eyes.

Their eyes were filled with unconcealable fear and trepidation, but more than that, they were shocked.

Their bodies were even trembling.

They were purely frightened and oppressed.

And then… plop! Plop!

One by one, they all knelt.

The first to kneel was the weaker disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Most of them were divine masters, including Earth Divine Masters and Divine Masters. The maximum pressure that originated from the life level was not something they could withstand. After kneeling, how long did it take for them to fall into a coma?

In the blink of an eye, all the strong disciples inside and outside the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, excluding those Immortal Saints, had already knelt. But, unfortunately, more than half of them had already fallen into a coma.

But this was not the end.

Suddenly, with a plop, another figure could not help but kneel.

And this time, it was the weaker Immortal Saint from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion!

Yes, it was the Immortal Saint. This Immortal Saint’s eyes were filled with unprecedented fear. He could not control his legs at all, and he could not help but kneel.

It was not just him. Plop! Plop! Plop!

Another two figures knelt. The other three Immortal Saints from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, including the current Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Long Xingzi!

Even Long Xingzi could not resist the pressure of the supreme life level.

As for those who did not kneel and could barely stand, only experts at the True Saint-level like Saint Hong could.

It was worth mentioning that none of the nine Immortal Saints from the Supreme Emotion Valley knelt directly.

Although they did not kneel, their bodies trembled violently, their minds were in a daze, and their breathing seemed completely frozen.

They were also suppressed and could not move at all.

Yes, except for Jian Wushuang, there were countless experts on the field who could not move at this moment!

His supreme life-level pressure had already suppressed the entire field!
