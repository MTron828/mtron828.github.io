Chapter 323: Ice Nether Valley

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Upon hearing this, Chi Mei blushed. He eventually calmed down and reacted with a wry smile.

Whoosh!

Chi Mei flew out of the huge hole. After landing on the ground, he looked up towards Jian Wushuang and slowly bowed to him. “You’re powerful. I am not your match. If I offended you, I hope you can forgive me. As for this trip to Ice Nether Valley, I’ll do my best and follow your orders.”

Jian Wushuang grinned and the Blood River started to dissipate.

Lady Black, the Wind and Rain Immortals, and Old Weirdo Yunyang were all astonished.

They did not expect that Jian Wushuang, an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, could completely defeat Chi Mei with such overwhelming power.

They were surprised at the power of the Blood River.

“The Blood River. How could it be so powerful?” Lady Black asked and frowned.

“It should be a high-level skill.” Wine Master smiled and continued, “If my guess is right, it should be a combination of three different techniques.”

The Wine Master added, “The first one is Slaughter Domain.”

“The second is the Realm of Sword Essence. I’ve heard about it from the Daluo Heaven Sect, and I’ve seen an expert of the Daluo Heaven Sect perform it before. It’s a special type of Sword Skill.

“As for the last one, it’s the most powerful, but I have no idea what it was.”

Although Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei had only fought for a short while, the onlookers had noticed something unusual.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang was able to defeat Chi Mei because of the Blood River.

The Blood River destroyed Chi Mei’s Domain and suppressed 70 percent of his strength.

They had never seen such a terrifying skill. Except for Wine Master, they thought that if they were stuck in that Blood River, they would have the same ending as Chi Mei.

“Wine Master, you already knew about his strength, right?” Lady Black looked toward the Wine Master and asked.

“I didn’t know his real strength, but I know about his battle results. Have you heard of Tan Feng?” Wine Master asked with a smile.

“Tan Feng? I know of him.” Old Weirdo Yunyang spoke first. “He ranked ninth on the Bloodmoon List and had reached the Second-stage Domain. He was powerful. I fought with him previously, but I barely had the upper hand. I heard that he was killed by an expert called ‘Nan’.”

“That boy is Nan!” Wine Master said with a smile.

Old Weirdo Yunyang was shocked. The Wind and Rain Immortals and Lady Black looked at each other. They immediately understood why the Wine Master was so confident about this fight.

Jian Wushuang killed Tan Feng, who was stronger than Chi Mei, so it would be easy for him to defeat Chi Mei.

Yang Zaixuan, who had been silent, looked serious.

He had fought with Jian Wushuang several times in Ditian Prefecture, but he had not seen his real strength, because Jian Wushuang restricted his own strength.

“Third Brother’s strength has reached such a high level?”

“Right now, I’m a bit weaker than him, but... in the future...”

At that moment, Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei came over.

“Nan, you’re so powerful. It’s a real eye-opener,” Old Weirdo Yunyang looked toward Jian Wushuang and said with a smile.

“Nan?” Chi Mei was surprised and immediately recalled the name that was spreading across the Tang Dynasty. He immediately understood and looked toward Jian Wushuang with a hint of respect.

It was normal. The powerful would be respected.

He thought Jian Wushuang was a boy of the Yang Void Realm, so he was unwilling to obey his orders. However, now he knew Jian Wushuang’s identity and his real strength, so he did not dare to disrespect him.

Moreover, He was being offered a reward, so he had no reason to disobey the young man.

“You can call me Swordsman,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Swordsman?” Old Weirdo Yunyang nodded slightly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“This trip to Ice Nether Valley is very important. If we go there together, we will attract too much attention, so we’d better go there separately,” Jian Wushuang continued.

“That’s what I thought too,” the Wine Master said and nodded.

Jian Wushuang asked Chi Mei to go with him, and the other six could set off by themselves.

Jian Wushuang was worried that the irritable Chi Mei would cause some trouble on the way, so he wanted to keep an eye on this expert.

If he was accompanied by Jian Wushuang, Chi Mei would behave himself.

With that, they left for Ice Nether Valley.

Ice Nether Valley was located at the peak of the mountains. Surrounded by the many giant mountains, it looked as if the moon was being embraced by a myriad of stars.

At the peak of the giant mountain, a black-robed girl sat alone, looking at the vast sky with a hint of puzzlement in her eyes. It seemed that she wanted to find her answer somewhere in the sky.

“Little Rou.”

A gentle voice came from behind her. A handsome young man in beautiful clothes walked over. He was followed by a black-clothed elder, who looked like a servant.

“Master.” Su Rou stood up and spoke.

“Still calling me Master?” Ye Chen wore a faint smile and said in a loving tone.

Su Rou lowered her head. She looked shy.

“A few days later, we will be married. You should have a good rest. Don’t think too much,” Ye Chen said.

“OK,” Su Rou responded unenthusiastically.

“It’s cold here. You’d better go back now,” Ye Chen added.

Su Rou bowed slightly and then left.

Only Ye Chen and the white-haired elder were left. Ye Chen’s expression changed and he began to look somewhat maniacal.

“Eight days!

“Eight more days, then her Extreme Yin Body will be mine!

“I have waited for this day for a long time,” Ye Chen roared hysterically. It was true. He had waited for more than 10 years.

A dozen years ago, he met Su Rou for the first time and recognized Su Rou’s unusual constitution. It was similar to the Extreme Yin Body that he read about in an ancient book. After several tests, he eventually confirmed that Su Rou had an Extreme Yin Body.

It was a legendary and miraculous constitution.
