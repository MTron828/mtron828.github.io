Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The battle continued.

Jian Wushang’s arrogant words of “all are welcome” indeed annoyed the disciples of the Dragon Palace. Many disciples who had broken through the fifth level itched to have a try, which was as he expected.

Based on the comprehension of realm, these disciples were almost all at the level of Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, while Jian Wushuang barely reached the fifth level, so many of the disciples who broke through the fifth floor are stronger than him. Nevertheless, his greatest strength was in his cultivation method which had superior overall power.

Relying on his absolute strength, he won the fifth confrontation.

Followed by the sixth and seventh challenges…until the eleventh!

Jian Wushuang won all 11 matches!

Those disciples of Dragon Palace at the Martial Arts Practice Field were speechless in astonishment.

It was nothing for Jian Wushuang to win one or two battles consecutively, but now he had won 11 battles successively. In addition to the first three disciples who were at the fourth level, the other eight disciples were all at the fifth level. However, they were all defeated by Jian Wushuang.

“It is his power that makes this happen. His power is even stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.”

“It’s strange that he has so much power as he is only at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm.”

“He has completed 11 battles in a row, but his spiritual power has not diminished. Why? Did he not need to consume his spiritual power when confronting others?”

Everyone was astonished.

They thought Jian Wushuang’s strength and vast spiritual power were amazing.

Needless to say, his strength was much stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. But it was also his vast spiritual power shocked others so much.

Several battles among these 11 battles were bitter fights, so how much spiritual power would these successive battles consume?

Usually warriors needed to stop and have a rest to recover their spiritual power after at most three battles, but what about Jian Wushuang?

Keep fighting!

After 11 battles without any pause, Jian Wushuang won all of them without any reduction in spiritual power. How could this happen?

And he was actually still at his peak level.

What kind of monster is he?

All those watching thought that this was incredible.

“Who else wants to battle me for points?” Jian Wushuang said confidently and looked around.

The disciples of Dragon Palace looked at each other in speechless despair and nobody stood out.

Winning 11 battles in a row, Jian Wushuang proved to all that he was strong enough, and those people who wanted to challenge him would surely lose face and worse, one thousand points.

For them, a thousand points was a big deal.

“No one else?” Seeing everyone’s hesitation, Jian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction. However, as he was about to turn around and leave, an ethereal voice was suddenly heard. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s very crowded here, isn’t it?”

The soft voice was followed by the arrival of a handsome man dressed in a luxurious robe who slowly appeared.

“Nangong Jie!”

“Isn’t he isolating himself? Why is he here?”

“Haha, it must be the commotion.”

A burst of noise swirled all around, which made it clear that these disciples of Dragon Palace knew this handsome man.

Jian Wushuang also looked at the man and found his appearance was almost perfect with slender physique, handsome face and a free and ethereal temperament.

“Soon after I finished my self-isolation, I heard that there was a newcomer in Dragon Palace and he said that anyone who had broken through the fifth level can challenge him. What arrogance!” Nan Gong Jie smiled lightly, but his eyes were instantly locked on Jian Wushuang.

“Nangong Jie, my brother has said this, but these words are only for the disciples of Dragon Palace at the level of Spiritual Sea. So you, who has broken through six months ago, shouldn’t be here!” Wang Yuan couldn’t help but shout.

Most disciples of the Dragon Palace were at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm, but a small part of them were at the level of Gold Core, and Nangong Jie was one of them.

“Oh, I do not know that your brother has made a distinction between Spiritual Sea Realm and Gold Core. I am also the disciple of Dragon Palace who has broken through the fifth level, so it’s ok for me to join this battle.”

“Moreover, your brother just has a normal perception of the Realm of Heaven and Earth, but he successively defeated so many disciples of Dragon Palace who are at the fifth level. It is precisely that his strength is much stronger than the others.”

“I think his strength will not be weaker than a disciple at the level of Primordial Gold Core if he goes all out. So it’s quite fair for me to challenge him.” Nangong Jie said.

“Exactly! this swordsman defeated so many disciples because that his strength is stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. Now Nangong Jie’s strength is also stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, these two should have a battle.” Immediately some disciples kicked up a fuss.

“You…” Wang Yuan wanted to refute them.

“Wang Yuan, stop!” Jian Wushuang waved one of his hands to interrupt him and continued, “Since I said that, I won’t break my promise.”

“Nangong Jie, it’s ok to gamble with you, but the stakes are still only a thousand points.”

“One thousand points?” Nangong Jie raised his eyebow and said, “no problem.”

“I’ll start.” Nangong Jie smiled thinly, and his figure begun to slowly dissipate at this moment.

Whoosh!

A sword light appeared in front of Jian Wushuang suddenly.

“So fast.”

Jian Wushuang was greatly frightened. He knew Sword Principle of Gale, and was also good at speed, but the speed of Nangong Jie was so fast that he even did not know when his sword was drawn.

The Sword Essence of Earth was so strong that Jian Wushuang did not hesitate to defend with it.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Nangong Jie slashed his sword ten times consecutively with increasing speed and power.

Jian Wushuang went for broke to going all out with Sword Essence of Earth to defend against Nangong Jie. However, he felt that he could not sustain this because the sword shadow was like thousands of poisonous snakes.

Suddenly…pop!

Nangong Jie’s Sword Edge crossed Jian Wushuang’s right hand wrist with a very clear sword scar. The pain in Jian Wushuang’s wrist made him loosen his grip of the Triple-kill Sword.

“Bro junior, are you okay?” Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou immediately rushed over.

“I’m fine.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and picked up Triple-kill Sword again.

“Nangong Jie, the battle is just for learning from each other. You shouldn’t hurt him so much.” Wang Yuan shouted in a low voice.

“Oh, sorry, it’s just an accident.”

Nangong Jie replied immediately. But his joking smile made it clear to everyone that he did it on purpose.
