Chapter 2552: Forming Alliances

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang needed Primordial Stones to accumulate divine powers for his cultivation.

The cultivation resources and certain treasures were of great value. However, those were not useful to him at all.

“Did you just say you have resources and treasures worth more than two hundred thousand Primordial Stones?”

The Head of Situ Clan pondered for a moment before speaking, “Mr. Jian Yi, I don’t think there are any stores in the Northern Darkstar Continent who can afford to trade these treasures with you. Even if we distribute them into batches between many stores, I don’t think it’ll be of much help. The stores have their own supply channels and it’d be impossible for them to acquire such a large volume of resources from you in one go.

“However, if Mr. Jian Yi finds the Situ Clan trustworthy, you can handover these resources and treasures to me. I’ll find a way to turn them into Primordial Stones as soon as possible,” suggested Situ Yuan.

“How long do you think it’ll take for you to do that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Situ Yuan put out one finger, “One year. The Situ Clan can definitely sell more than half of these resources and treasures within a year. Once that’s done there definitely won’t be much left so the Situ Clan should be able to exchange the rest into Primordial Stones from our own treasury.”

“A year?” Jian Wushuang nodded. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He had lived for nearly 100,000 years in his previous life and due to different world constraints and environments, he spent around several tens to hundreds of years traveling.

Although he had only been around for more than twenty years in his current life, he did not mind spending one year collecting Primordial Stones.

“If that’s the case, I’ll give my thanks to the Situ Clan in advance.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out an Interspatial Ring.

It contained many resources and treasures he obtained from the Dark Thunder Territory’s three prefectures together with the other clans’ gifts he recently received.

Situ Yuan briefly glanced into it and nodded after taking the ring.

Situ Yuan then took out a Message Token and gave it to Jian Wushuang. “Mr. Jian Yi, this is my Message Token. If you need any help in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me. I’ll also keep you informed about the progress of selling these resources and treasures.”

Jian Wushuang took the Message Token and gave it to Xiao Tiexin who was next to him.

Situ Yuan frowned and asked, “Mr. Jian Yi, could you introduce me to your companion?”

“Clan Leader, Xin’er is my younger sister. You can look for her if you need to keep in touch as I might be in seclusion and won’t be reachable at times,” explained Jian Wushuang.

“I see.” Situ Yuan nodded. “I’ll make a move then.”

“Sure. Xin’er, can you send the Clan Leader off?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sure.” Xiao Tiexin seemed to have accepted her identity as Jian Wushuang’s younger sister—Xin’er. She nodded and escorted Situ Yuan to the door.

Jian Wushuang let out a long sigh after Situ Yuan left.

“What perfect timing for Situ Yuan to come.” Jian Wushuang was pleased.

His hands were tied after those clans took the initiative in sending him gifts and could no longer go after them with his lame excuses for Primordial Stones.

He was worried about how he would get more Primordial Stones until Situ Yuan extended an olive branch.

Jian Wushuang was given 100,000 Primordial Stones on top of obtaining a clan’s help to oversee the sale of resources and treasures he had on hand.

“I have three hundred ninety thousand Primordial Stones now and might have at least six hundred thousand Primordial Stones when the Situ Clan manages to liquidate all my resources and treasures. That’ll be more than enough for my breakthrough to the Ultimate God Realm!” Jian Wushuang excitedly rubbed his hands.

“One year! It’s for only one year!”

“I’ll keep a low-profile during this year and stop going after these clans. Otherwise, my good reputation will be tarnished.” Jian Wushuang rubbed his nose.

It was despicable for him to chase after those clans and he had to stop before being shunned by them.

He was relieved the moment he found a way to achieve his goals.

“Tiexin,” called Jian Wushuang.

“Didn’t Mr. Jian Yi previously called me Xin’er? Why are you calling me Tiexin now?” Xiao Tiexin teased.

“Well, I couldn’t have addressed you as Tiexin before the Clan Leader. What if he figured out your actual identity?” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s a cause for concern.” Xiao Tiexin agreed.

“Tiexin, you’re from the Xiao Clan so you probably know best about the situation back then. Are the Clan Leader’s words true?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s true.” Xiao Tiexin nodded. “Among the four top-tier clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent, the Xiao Clan and Situ Clan have always been in bad shape. We use various methods to forge alliances with many experts. However, the Situ Clan is obviously doing a better job at it. In addition, the Situ Clan didn’t have The Stately Painting. It was that Heavenly Treasure that tempted the Territorial Lord to wipe us out.

“Although the Situ Clan is still around, they’re walking on thin ice just to preserve themselves. They wouldn’t be at such risk if the Situ Clan is just a mid-tier clan.”

Jian Wushuang understood what she meant.

“Situ Yuan is indeed sincere if that’s the case. I’ll be indebted to the Situ Clan if they help me obtain plenty of Primordial Stones through proper sales management of my resources and treasures. I’ll surely take good care of them when I replace the Territorial Lord in the future.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I’m afraid he’d be over the moon if the Clan Leader is aware of your true capabilities and plans. It’s a big win for the Situ Clan if he managed to build such a great relationship with you based on only one hundred thousand Primordial Stones and favor from their clan,” Xiao Tiexin murmured and sighed, “had the Xiao Clan been as bold and persistent previously and made great efforts to forge alliances with powerful experts, perhaps we might’ve been spared from the attack.”

Jian Wushuang glanced at Xiao Tiexin and shook his head.

Jian Wushuang announced sometime later, “I’m planning to head toward my secret chamber for my closed-door cultivation. Don’t disturb me if there isn’t anything urgent.”
