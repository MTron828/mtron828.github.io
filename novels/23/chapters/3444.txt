Chapter 3446 Marriage Proposal

“Yun ‘er, go and call your uncle over,” Zhuo Bing ordered.

“Yes.” Qiu Yun nodded and immediately went out of the courtyard.

Before long, Qiu Yun and Zhuo Peng came back together.

”Third brother!”

When Zhuo Peng saw Jian Wushuang, he immediately revealed an ecstatic expression and rushed over to give Jian Wushuang a hug.

“Second brother, long time no see.” Jian Wushuang also smiled.

“You also said that you haven’t heard anything for so many years. We were worried about you,” Zhuo Peng said.

“Aren’t you back safely?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “By the way, I heard from father that you encountered some trouble.”

“Father told you?” Zhuo Peng glanced at Jian Wushuang and then sighed, “Although Ying ‘er and I agreed to marry her, the gap between our statuses is too big…”

“Let’s ignore the gap between our statuses for now. Second brother, let me ask you, do you want to marry her?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, of course, I want to marry her. Even in my dreams, I want to marry her, but she is a member of the Blood Marten Clan and the daughter of the clan leader of the Blood Marten Clan,” Zhuo Peng said. “I told you to ignore your statuses for now. Since you want to marry her, it’s easy,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile. “Third brother, do you have a way?” Zhuo Peng looked at Jian Wushuang expectantly.

“Of course, and it’s very simple. You just need to go with me to the Blood Marten Clan to propose marriage. Then I will help you bring your sweetheart back.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Really?” Zhuo Peng’s eyes lit up. “Of course it’s true. Second brother, I’m afraid you don’t know that third brother is now standing at a height that we can’t imagine. Today, he killed Chi Hu, the young grandmaster of the Scarlet Gold Clan, on the spot, in Piahuo City. But the city protection army of Piahuo City didn’t dare to do anything to him!”

“With third brother’s current strength and status, if he goes to the Blood Marten Clan to propose marriage, I’m afraid the Blood Marten Clan won’t dare to disrespect him,” Zhuo Bing said.

“He killed the young grandmaster of the Scarlet Gold Clan in Piahuo City, and he’s still fine?” Zhuo Peng immediately became fanatical. “Third brother…”

“Second brother, why don’t you make some preparations? We’ll go to the Blood Marten Clan now, how about it?’” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay, of course, I’ll make some preparations right away!” Zhuo Peng became excited and immediately began to make preparations. Zhuo Yunfeng looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Shuang ‘er, isn’t it too rushed to go to the Blood Marten Clan to propose marriage right now? Besides, since we’re going to propose marriage, we must prepare the betrothal gifts, but we haven’t prepared the betrothal gifts yet.” “Don’t worry, I have the betrothal gifts. I promise I won’t let my future sister-in-law suffer,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile. He had killed so many experts, including several Principles Masters, and even the Nether Master, as a top Principles Master, the flame divine guard naturally had a lot of treasures and resources.

As long as he took out some of them as betrothal gifts, the Blood Marten Clan would be tempted.

“Third brother, can you take me with you to propose marriage this time?” Zhuo Bing suddenly asked.

“I want to go too,” Qiu Yun also said.

Jian Wushuang could not help smiling. “If you want to go, of course. Father, mother, why don’t you go together?”

“Well…” Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin looked at each other, and then Zhuo Yunfeng said with a smile, “Then let’s go together. Let’s go and pick up the daughter-in-law of our Zhuo family.”

“Yun ‘er, go and call your father,” Zhuo Bing said.

“Okay.” Qiu Yun immediately went.

Not long after, Jian Wushuang left the drifting fire city with his family and went to the clan land of the Blood Marten Clan.

The clan land of the Blood Marten Clan was not far from Piahuo City, but it took Jian Wushuang more than half a day to get there with Zhuo Yunfeng and the others.

“Is this the territory of the Blood Marten Clan?” Jian Wushuang looked at the vast territory covered by the restriction.

The range of the restriction was so wide that it covered almost a whole and huge mountain range. Because of the restriction, even Jian Wushuang could not see the scene below.

“This restriction seems to be quite strong,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“I’ve heard of the Blood Marten Clan. A long time ago, the Blood Marten Clan was only a medium-sized clan in the demon region. But later, because of this Blood Marten Clan, a very powerful expert appeared. It’s said that his strength has reached the peak of the six void realms, and is even infinitely close to the peak of the six void realms. It was under his leadership that the Blood Marten Clan became the top clan. At that time, they even dared to challenge the four great divine clans.”

“However, after the strongest expert of the Blood Marten Clan left the Divine Beginning Realm and ventured into the depths of the universe battlefield, the strength of the Blood Marten Clan gradually declined. Until now, they have only managed to maintain their position as a top clan. Now, the restriction covering the entire ancestral land should be created by the strongest expert of the Blood Marten Clan,” said Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Infinitely close to the pinnacle of the six void realms? Isn’t that the same as you?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Demon Master Chenhuo.

Demon Master Chenhuo only raised his eyebrows and did not say anything.

“Second brother, you go. With me here to support you, you don’t need to be afraid or worried. Just tell me why you’re here,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.” Zhuo Peng took a deep breath and rushed toward the entrance of the Blood Marten Clan.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the void above and watched everything below.

Zhuo Peng went directly to the entrance. Before he got close, someone stopped him. “Who is it?”

Several saint-level members of the Blood Marten Clan were guarding the entrance. They stared at Zhuo Peng with cold faces.

“I am Zhuo Peng. I am from Piahuo City. This time, I am here to propose marriage,” Zhuo Peng said solemnly.

“Propose marriage?” The few members of the Blood Marten Clan were stunned at first, but then they burst into laughter, “kid, did you go to the wrong place? You are an Immortal Saint of the human race, yet you came to my Blood Marten Clan to propose marriage? Who in my Blood Marten Clan would fancy you?”

“The one I want to propose marriage is your Blood Marten Clan’s Princess Ying. You can just call her out,” Zhuo Peng said.

“What a joke. What status does my princess have? Why would she like a human kid like you? You’re clearly scheming against us. Hurry up and scram!” One of the Blood Marten Clansmen immediately berated.

But at this moment…

“What’s going on?” A low voice sounded. At the entrance, an evil-looking man in a black robe walked out with his hands behind his back.
