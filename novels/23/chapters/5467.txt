Chapter 5466 Silver-Armored Guard

For tens of thousands of years, surpassing the accumulation of countless epochs was an ordeal for them all.

The crucial point was the tremendous impact from Shang.

Initially, Shang was just an Ultimate emperor, slightly stronger than them. But now, he had ascended to the realm of a supreme-peak level powerhouse, a figure invincible even in the river of time.

It hadn't been that long since Shang's breakthrough, considering him as their junior. This fact made their discomfort even more profound, emphasizing the gap between paths.

Upon arriving at the Qishen Temple, they intensified their cultivation efforts, determined not to fall too far behind.

However, they encountered a setback on the Demon Sound Mount.

After Dongsheng presented the token, six silver-armored soldiers emerged from the Demon Sound Hall. Each wielded a long spear, dressed uniformly in silver helmets and capes. Their eyes glowed a dark red, concealing their features.

In front of the Demon Sound Hall, a miniature world formed rapidly.

The six silver-armored soldiers raised their spears, blocking Dongsheng's path.

Zhutian, standing aside, spoke, "To enter, you must defeat these six silver-armored guards. No one has managed to overcome them so far!"

As Zhutian's gaze swept over, Jian Wushuang noticed the peculiar strength of these guards. They didn't seem like cultivators but rather a unique type of puppet.

Their actual strength remained elusive.

However, he would soon find out.

Dongsheng had transformed into his true form, the head of the Azure Dragon, with a human body and a divine body spanning billions of miles.

"A 50,000-fold divine body!" Jian Wushuang exclaimed.¬†The most uptodate nove/s are published on nove ln ext .c om

He hadn't expected that these tier 5 Emperors would have such high value, actually cultivating their divine bodies to 50,000-fold.

Zhutian, nonchalantly, remarked, "Hehe, don't be too surprised. We old folks aren't as simple as you might think. Dongsheng once obtained an ancient inheritance in the river of time, and in terms of treasures, we're not fewer than you. Our divine bodies reached 50,000-fold long ago. If it were in the Original Universe, even if we scoured all the universe's secret realms, we probably couldn't gather this many treasures."¬†

Indeed!

Back when Wanderer Chishui revealed his strength, his divine body probably hadn't even reached 30,000-fold, yet he claimed to be the strongest Special Life Form in the Original Universe.

This was the downside of not venturing out-the gap in treasures was too vast.

When Zhutian left behind the Eternal Tower, he handed control of the entire East Universe to Demon Lord Fengyu.

That Eternal Treasure was the only one in the entire Original Universe, left behind by Emperor Zhutian.

Not even Shang had one!

It was easy to imagine that Zhutian had gained a substantial amount of treasures back then, allowing him to generously leave behind such an Eternal Treasure.

Commerce chose not to venture out to avoid wasting cultivation time.

However, these tier 5 Emperors had ventured out countless times, and their accumulated treasures were quite substantial.

For the first time, Jian Wushuang encountered a super powerhouse with a 50,000-fold divine body.

He had obtained so many heaven-defying treasures that his divine body had just reached 49,000-fold. To break through, Jian Wushuang would have to devour the entire vine of the Hundred Weeping Vine.

Jian Wushuang felt a bit reluctant and didn't rush to break through.

After all, the Hundred Weeping Vines had reached maturity, constantly evolving in the river of time within the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard, giving birth to countless

Tears of Weeping Vines, breaking through 50,000-fold was only a matter of time.

If he really wanted to cut them down, he would have to buy them in the future.

Jian Wushuang was afraid of being poor.

In the auction, if he hadn't deceived people everywhere, he wouldn't have been able to buy anything. He wasn't like those people from the Elder Palace who could plunder treasures.

"Take a good look, the power of these guards is very special!" Zhutian's eyes were somewhat excited as he said to Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang followed the direction of the intense aura. The six guards erupted with a world-destroying aura, each possessing the strength of a tier 6 Emperor.Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Six tier 6 Emperors joining forces against a tier 5 peak-level Emperor, it's no wonder that none of them could enter.

This was too outrageous.

The combat power of these puppets was not comparable to those tier 6 Emperors who were pulling the lower ranks in the Four Great Secret Realms. The combined strength of the six already equaled that of a top-tier tier 6 Emperor.

This was the normal standard of power.

In other words, Emperor Dongsheng would have to unleash the top-level tier 6 to contend, and defeating them would be even more difficult.

Without the combat power of a peak-level tier 6, it was challenging to enter.

To be at the peak-level of tier 5 and compete with the peak-level tier, perhaps only a few Emperors on the Grave God Mountain could achieve that.

He had originally thought of giving it a try, but now it seemed unlikely.

Emperor Dongsheng had indeed erupted with the top-level tier 6, comparable to the six guards, but it would be difficult to defeat them.

The prediction of Jian Wushuang was quite accurate. Since Dongsheng dared to try, he probably had some confidence, but ultimately, it was just a glimmer of hope.

Between cultivators of the same level, defeating the opponent either required depleting their power or overwhelming them with superior force.

However, the puppet power of the guardians was eternal and couldn't be exhausted. Only by using formidable strength could one crush through.

"No hope!" Zhutian shook his head because Dongsheng's aura was already declining.

He couldn't hold on.

It was too difficult.

Zhutian was considering leaving the mountain. It was better not to stay here; it was time to try luck elsewhere.

"No, he's going to win!" Jian Wushuang's gaze remained fixed. As Dongsheng's aura decreased, the sun and moon on Emperor Dongsheng's hands evolved into a black hole. The realm of a black hole!

This time, not only would Emperor Dongsheng successfully enter the Demon Demon Hall, but he might also break through to tier 6.

Zhutian's eyes constricted into a point, shocked to the core!

There was also envy.

Among them, most were at the peak-level of tier 5, having accumulated countless epochs. Breaking through was incredibly challenging, even in the Four Great Secret Realms.

Yet now, Dongsheng became the first among them to break through.

"Annihilate!" Dongsheng roared, and the sound of a dragon's roar echoed in the ears. The six guardians were all shattered and scattered on the ground.

Bang!

Dongsheng gasped for breath, put away the divine power in his hands, extremely excited, almost shouting out.

Inside the Demon Sound Hall, a deep voice echoed, "Come in!"

Dongsheng glanced back, and many tier 5 Emperors, who had been indifferent earlier, now looked at him with envy.

"Hmph, I'll be waiting inside for you!" Although this statement was arrogant, no one paid it any mind.

Dongsheng's success provided them with great motivation.

It had only been 10,000 years; Dongsheng had entered, and they were not inferior. At most, there were some differences in time.

Afterward, each one immersed themselves in cultivation. After Emperor Dongsheng entered the Demon Sound Hall, the silver fragments scattered on the ground turned into silver liquid, then transformed once again into silver armor guardians, standing in front of the door of the Demon Sound Hall. They once again guarded the entrance, preventing other from entering again.
