Chapter 1002: Marked

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“A Rank Eight Reincarnator?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed with doubt.

The Samsara Temple was a hierarchical organization.

Rank Seven Reincarnators could only procure information about Reincarnators with ranks below theirs, but not of the same rank.

However, information about Rank Seven Reincarnators was available to Rank Eight Reincarnators.

News about his father might be able to be found by a Rank Eight Reincarnator if he had indeed made it to Rank Seven.

“And what will be the price of enlisting the help of a Rank Eight Reincarnator?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Hardly unreasonable. Ten Chaos Gems.” Jin Yu replied, grinning widely.

“What?” The Dragon Wing Governor gasped with disbelief, his expression changing immediately.

“Hehehe… To think that this insolent pup has the impertinence to dare demand ten Chaos Gems from you. As a mere Rank Seven Reincarnator, he would at most be a Rank Three Dao Master. Under no circumstances, a wretch like him would worth ten Chaos Gems.”?The Gu King snorted.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with simmering displeasure, for he, too, could see that Jin Yu was trying to be demanding.

The price of ten Chaos Gems was so great that not even a Dao Master at the pinnacle of Rank Three could safely agree to such demand.

With the treasures left to him by Dao Yuanzi, Jian Wushuang could still manage the outrageous demand of Jin Yu. But he was hardly a naive fool that would tolerate himself being fleeced for nothing.

“Mr Jin Yu. Will you be able to fully ensure that the Rank Eight Reincarnator will accede to helping me with my errand if the price of the ten gems is promised?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well, this…” Jin Yu’s brows furrowed uneasily. “If you agree to my terms, I will speak to the Rank Eight Reincarnator. We share a friendship. There’s a plausible likelihood that he will agree.”

“By your words, there is also the likelihood that he will refuse, no?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course. He is, after all, a Rank Eight Reincarnator who holds greater authority over me. I simply cannot command him to do as I wish. Only he himself will decide.” Jin Yu replied.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang remarked, feigning a troubled look as he sneered quietly at Jin Yu.?“He may be truthful about speaking to the Rank Eight Reincarnator about my plight if I agree to his terms. Then again, he could be lying. He could easily dismiss the matter simply by lying about the Reincarnator’s refusal to help and none would be the wiser about his malicious deceit.”

“I see… This Jin Yu does intend to defraud me of my Chaos Gems.”

“Has he mistaken me for a complete fool?”

With a cold smile to himself, Jian Wushuang put on an earnest expression and nicely declined. “Mr Jin Yu. It was by an extraordinary fortuitous encounter that I had chanced upon two Chaos Gems. Regardless, I am afraid that is the extent of all I am able to afford. I am afraid I will have to solve my conundrum myself from another direction. Thank you for all your help thus far, Mr Jin Yu, and have a good day.”

“Really?” Jin Yu stared at Jian Wushuang strangely. He muttered to himself?, “Is he telling the truth or not?”

Despite his suspicions, Jin Yu could only wave his hand scornfully. “I see. I see no merit in pressing the issue then. See off our guests, Ye!”

“This way, please.” The grey-robed elder immediately walked up to them.

Jian Wushuang and the Dragon Wing Governor shared a thoughtful glance. In muted silence, they readily followed behind the grey-robed elder who led them out of the castle gates.

Watching them leave, Jin Yu left the chamber and walked down into the dungeons of this castle where another great hall, magnificent but yet dark with gloom, was raised underground beneath the foundations of the castle above.

At a great distance from ground level, the great hall was far from prying eyes and ears, being guarded by many Restrictions and enchantments.

Jin Yu crept into the dark and sinister hall.

“Master Di Yan, the two have just left my castle. They will not be far. You can set off now.” Jin Yu spoke into a wall that was embellished with mysterious cracks before him.

“Are you certain that one of them possesses the bloodline of the Winged Dragons, Jin Yu?” An evil and insidious voice croaked from the other side of the wall.

“Of that, I am certain, Sir.” Jin Yu nodded with a smile.

“Hahaha… the Winged Dragon Clan… For years I have been seeking for the still-living remnants of this clan ever since its purge so many years ago. I hazard that their number will hardly be more than a handful now… His blood must be very tasty, indeed,” said the evil voice.

“Master Di Yan. The Dragon Wing Governor is a very influential person across the societies of the Samsara Continent. There will surely be repercussions once his death is discovered. I am afraid that I might be beset with troubles and inconveniences then. I would like to request for an additional one-tenth increment to my agreed reward.” Jin Yu beseeched.

“Fine.” The evil voice agreed hastily.

“One other thing. There is a young man; a young warrior of the Eternal Realm who was here with the Dragon Wing Governor. Please leave the young man to me, Master Di Yan.” Jin Yu added.

“The Eternal Realm? Hmph. So be it.” The evil voice promised.

“Let us commence then.”

It was not long after Jian Wushuang and Dragon Wing Governor had left the castle, that two figures fleeted out of the gargantuan structure of the castle with one close behind the other.

Jian Wushuang was speeding through the air with the Dragon Wing Governor just beside him, tearing across the vast expanse of the sky.

“Jian Wushuang, you have been marked.”?The Gu King’s voice rose suddenly in his mind. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“What?”?Jian Wushuang was taken aback by the sudden and startling warning.

“Someone has secretly branded strange magical marks on you and the Dragon Wing Governor,”?said the Gu King.

“Magical marks?”?Jian Wushuang’s expression turned heavy.

He knew full well how dangerous could magical marks could be, having experienced it first hand more than once.

Once marked, one could easily be hunted down by foes who have placed upon him the magical spell. There was no way to hide one’s scent save by undoing the magic of the mark.

“It must be Jin Yu then?”?asked Jian Wushuang.

“Indeed.”?The Gu King nodded, confirming his suspicion.?“But his methods are most unusual. Neither you nor the Dragon Wing Governor had noticed when he had placed the spell upon you both. Still, his schemes did not escape my keen observation.”

“Is there any way I can erase the Mark?”?asked Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, but it will take at least a day for the magic to be undone.”?The Gu King replied gravely.

At this, Jian Wushuang stopped moving instantly.

“What happened, Jian Wushuang?” The Dragon Wing Governor pulled himself to a stop as he noticed Jian Wushuang stopping strangely.

“I’m afraid, trouble has befallen us, Governor,” Jian Wushuang admitted.

“Trouble?” The Dragon Wing Governor’s eyes turned wide as his pupils immediately shrank at the shock of the sudden revelation.

Just then, a shrill howl that could send even winds quivering rang menacingly behind them.

The two companions turned around instantly, witnessing a black and ominous mass of cloud sweeping toward them at an amazing speed. In a flash, it loomed precariously over them.
