Chapter 3004: Interception

——

Swish!

Jian Wushuang’s speed directly burst out.

Previously, he had been able to restrain his speed and did not use his full strength.

The reason for this was to give the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom a chance.

Now that the opportunity was almost given, many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had gathered around him. Only then did his speed completely burst out.

His burst of speed was more than 10 times faster than his previous speed!

After all, his speed was already so fast that even a rank two True Saint could barely keep up with him. But now, his speed had increased by 10 times. What did that mean?

“Oh no!”

“Oh my God!”

“His speed!”

Sect Master Jin Shan and the others behind Jian Wushuang were shocked when they saw Jian Wushuang’s burst of speed.

Then they immediately sent a message to Lord Wu.

“Lord Wu, for some reason, the man from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance suddenly increased his speed tenfold. We can’t keep up with him.” Sect master Jin Shan sent the message personally.

Although he was a rank three True Saint, he was not good at speed, so he could not keep up with Jian Wushuang’s speed either.

If he was like this, there was no need to mention the others.

“Damn it!”

Lord Wu’s expression turned extremely ugly when he received the news. He immediately changed his plan and said, “I have no choice but to act immediately. where is the man now? Who is in front of him?”

“Lord, both Sky Mound King and Stone Saint are in front of him,” the True Saint beside him said.

“Sky Mound King and Stone Saint?” Lord Wu’s eyes suddenly lit up. “These two are true second rank True Saints, and Sky Mound King is good at fighting with others, while Stone Saint’s protective abilities are extremely strong. If the two of them work together, unless that person is a third rank True Saint, they can definitely stop them!”

“That’s how it should be.” The True Saint beside him nodded.

“Quick, send a message to Sky Mound King and Stone Saint. Tell them to work together and intercept that person. There’s no need for them to kill that person from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. They only need to stall him and not give him a chance to escape. Wait for the Golden Mountain Sect Master and True Lord Hun to arrive before killing him!” Lord Wu said.

“Yes.” That True Saint immediately went to send the message.

…

Two figures stood side by side in the vast void.

One of these two people wore a gray robe and had a cold expression. He held a pitch-black long whip in his hand. The long whip was covered with all kinds of pitch-black scales, just like a cold venomous snake.

The other person was a tall man who was nearly three meters tall. His body was as strong as a mountain. This tall man had his arms crossed and carried a two-meter-long giant axe on his back.

“Keke, Stone Saint, I never expected that I would be able to join forces with you one day.” The gray-robed elder, who held a black whip and had a cold expression, said with a strange laugh.

“I never expected it either.” The tall man, who was nearly three meters tall as a mountain, was Stone Saint. His expression was cold, and his voice was very calm. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Although the two of them were experts under the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, they had once crossed swords with each other.

This was not a huge matter, and it was not to the point of them fighting to the death. However, the two of them would not have any interactions. However, due to Lord Wu’s orders, the two of them had no choice but to join forces.

“According to the location Lord Wu sent us, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance member should be arriving soon. With our strength, can we really stop him?” Sky Mound King said.

“Why? Are you afraid?” The Stone Saint glanced at the Sky Mound King.

“How can I not be afraid? He killed Holy Master Huocang directly. In terms of strength, Holy Master Huocang is slightly stronger than both of us. Furthermore, I am not as strong as you in terms of body protection. If we really fight later, that person might kill me directly if he is slightly careless. After all, he has the ‘God Burning’ poison in his hands,” the Sky Mound King said, there was indeed a trace of worry in his eyes.

“If you are afraid, you can just hide behind me later. There is no need for you to fight him head-on. All you need to do is wave your whip and stop him,” said the Stone Saint.

“That won’t be a problem.” A smile appeared on the Sky Mound King’s face.

At this moment…

The sound of rushing wind suddenly came from the distant void.

“They’re coming.”

The eyes of Sky Mound King and stone saint narrowed, and their faces turned solemn.

Jian Wushuang was the one who was rushing over.

His speed was so fast that he almost left the experts behind him far behind. However, at this moment, he saw the Sky Mound King and Stone Saint standing side by side in front of him.

“Two rank two True Saints?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “Do you want to use these two to stop or stall me, then wait for the other experts to arrive and kill me?”

Jian Wushuang chuckled, but his eyes turned cold.

“I don’t have time to play with you two, so…die!”

Jian Wushuang’s body shook as he performed the three secret skills at the same time.

At the same time, buzz!

A shocking and supreme sword essence suddenly burst out.

The supreme sword essence hidden in the Blood Mountain Sword had been guided out by Jian Wushuang.

As Jian Wushuang improved his sword principle greatly, he naturally guided more sword essence, which also improved his battle strength greatly.

The supreme sword essence swept down on him, making him like a master of sword principle!

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s figure flashed, and the silver light suddenly burst out.

His figure was ghostly, and streaks of silver light burst out instantly, shuttling through the void. In an instant, he appeared in front of the Sky Mound King and the Stone Saint.

“What terrifying speed!” Sky Mound King was shocked.

“Sky Mound King, you retreat first.” The Stone Saint let out a low shout. A large amount of earth rule power gathered around his divine body, and in the blink of an eye, it had turned into a heavy mountain blocking Jian Wushuang.

As for Sky Mound King, he followed the Stone Saint’s instructions and retreated immediately. He wanted to retreat further and use his long whip to trap Jian Wushuang.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang pointed with one hand.

Immediately, a surge of space-time principle power burst out.

Space-time divine skill, one point divine skill!

This move was determined by Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of space-time principle.

120 years ago, he could only affect ordinary rank one True Saints.

However, in these 120 years, he had made great progress in the space-time principle. Now, he had reached the limit of the stage, which was comparable to many rank three True Saints. If he used this move under such circumstances…

Buzz! Buzz!

Without any warning, the figures of the Sky Mound King and the Stone Saint froze there.

Then, Jian Wushuang struck.
