Chapter 1740: Devil Nine Cuts

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The killing formation was filled with an imposing, austere manner. The entire universe was frozen. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, then…

“Die!”

There was a bellow and Jian Wushuang kept his look of five heads and ten arms. Every single one of his arms was holding on to a long sword. He took a huge stride forward with terrifying power. Suddenly, he appeared in front of the Devil Nine Cuts.

“Roar!”

Devil Nine Cuts let out an earth-shattering roar.

Merely the impact of the soundwave in his roar was enough to exterminate an expert on Real God ranking list.

Suddenly, Devil Nine Cuts wriggled its body and there were muscular arms that extended. Just like Jian Wusahung, he had ten arms as well.

The ten arms held a variety of divine weapons substantiated with divine power. Under the coverage of soaring rage, Devil Nine Cuts charged forward ferociously.

The two lofty statues that were taller than a hundred zhang in height collided in the middle of the formation.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Deafening roars resonated across the universe.

Every roar brought about powerful explosions that could destroy the universe.

Jian Wushuang wielded the ten long swords in his hands and swung them continuously under the utilization of special attack.

Although Devil Nine Cuts was like Jian Wushuang with ten arms, close combat didn’t rely on the number of arms. Jian Wushuang had collaborated it with his special attack skill while Devil Nine Cuts hadn’t.

In terms of close-body combat, the Devil Nine Cuts that was controlled by the five Sir Gods was far behind.

However, Devil Nine Cuts possessed the power of an Emperor God. In that aspect, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be able to compare favorably even after he broke three Ancient God Stars.

Hence, he definitely had the upper hand in terms of close body combat. However, when they really fought, Jian Wushuang was slightly at a disadvantage.

Just then…

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two rays of golden lights that suddenly glowed. The two rays of golden lights were on the left and on the right each. Regardless of speed or power, both were enhanced tremendously and the lights slashed at Devil Nine Cuts’ head.

Devil Nine Cuts’ two arms swung in madness and forced the two Hong Jun Golden Swords back. However, Jian Wushuang seized the chance to swing out two sword lights that chopped off both the arms.

Jian Wushuang chopped Devil Nine Cuts’ two arms in collaboration with Hong Jun Golden Swords. He had yet to celebrate when he saw Devil Nine Cuts let out an angry roar. There were boundless clouds churning and a large amount of blood fog flooded in. Its power suddenly rose.

At the same time, the two arms that Jian Wushuang had chopped off recovered quickly.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s useless. Devil Nine Cuts is unrivaled within the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts. No matter how severe the damage you cause, forget that you just cut off its two arms, even if you chop off its head or slash it in half from the middle, it will recover immediately,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“If you want to stay alive, there’s only one way, which is to figure out a way to dissolve the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts. Otherwise, no matter how much effort you put in, you’ll only die in the end.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold.

As he fought, he glanced at the five Sir Gods outside the formation. The five Sir Gods were fully focused on controlling Devil Nine Cuts.

“I broke three Ancient God stars in one go and my power did increase tremendously. However, the power of Ancient God stars couldn’t be maintained long enough. I have to seize the chance,” Jian Wushuang made a decision in his head.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

The ten swords in Jian Wushuang’s hands continued to swing out ferociously. Every stroke was like a mountain. In addition to that, Hong Jung Golden Sword forcibly blocked Devil Nine Cuts’ attack.

But suddenly… Jian Wushuang quickly retreated. He retreated all of a sudden and it was outside of Devil Nine Cuts’, as well as the five Sir Gods’, expectations.

As he retreated, Jian Wushuang poured out the divine power in him.

“Secret skill of Ancient God…Thunder Attracting Skill!”

Hong!

Above the space storm that was trembling in balance was the vast sky.

At that moment, there was a huge crack that appeared in the sky.

In the crack, terrifying thunderous power filled the air. Suddenly, there were countless Life Destroying Sacred Thunders that suddenly descended.

Every single strike of Life Destroying Sacred Thunder required a Sir God to treat it with extreme care. But then, there were about a hundred strikes of them descending at the same time.

Plus, after the hundreds of Life Destroying Sacred Thunder had descended but were yet to strike the body of Devil Nine Cuts, they merged together at a terrifying speed.

Suddenly, a huge thunder dragon that was over ten zhang thick roared as it pounded at Devil Nine Cuts.

Thunder Attracting Skill, one of the three Ancient God secret skills.

As Jian Wushahung broke three Ancient God stars and his power increased tremendously, the Life Destroying Sacred Thunder he stirred was even more powerful.

The thunder dragon instantly entangled the huge body of Devil Nine Cuts.

The terrifying thunderous power suddenly exploded. Devil Nine Cut wasn’t afraid but it waved his arms, intending to break the thunder dragon.

Just as the huge thunder dragon entangled Devil Nine Cuts, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were fixed on a person outside the killing formation.

That person was the ugly lady who was good at assassination tricks… Mo Ying!

“Out of the five Sir Gods, she is the one good at assassination and she is also the weakest in defense. Hence, she will be easiest to kill,” there was a murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The next moment, Ancient God power swept out again.

“Secret skill of Ancient God, Moon Picking Skill!”

The void instantly shook.

One hand to flip the sky and the other hand to pick the moon.

The strongest secret skill for Ancient God tribe to perform.

Hualala. The void outside the killing formation where Mo Ying was suddenly shattered and collapsed like a piece of paper.

An extremely terrifying yet unique strength ignored the hindrance of the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts and caused an effect on Mo Ying.

“What?” Mo Ying’s face changed.

She could feel the surrounding universe, space and time pressuring her from all directions. The pressure was too strong.

One should know that Jian Wushuang had performed Moon Picking Skill back in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning when he wasn’t giving his all but he aimed at four Sir Gods and caused all of them to be injured. Among them, His Highness Mu Hong was severely injured.

But then, Jian Wushuang broke three Ancient God stars directly and he was giving his all. The Moon Picking Skill that he had performed was only aiming at one person and the person was a Sir God that was good at assassinations in the dark.

This kind of Sir God wouldn’t be strong in defense.

Immediately…

“No!!!”

Mo Ying let out a shrill cry. Her body exploded into pieces under the pressure of space and time.

In an instant, she vanished into thin air.

Sir God Mo Ying, who had set up the killing formation, died and the killing formation instantly collapsed.
