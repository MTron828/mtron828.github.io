Chapter 3622: Trouble

“He really didn’t use his full strength.” Daoist Xuan God and Temporal Temple Master nodded to themselves.

They had clearly seen the battle just now.

Apart from some of his trump cards and life-saving methods, the Heaven Ancestor had indeed used all of his strength.

But what about Jian Wushuang?

From the beginning to the end, he had been very casual and relaxed. No matter what kind of attack the Heaven Ancestor used, he could easily resolve it. Even if he used his swordsmanship casually, it would still be extremely terrifying.

It was so relaxed and comfortable that it was obvious that he had not used all of his strength. Even so, the battle in the last hour had been one-sided. The Heaven Ancestor had been completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

“It seems that your strength is much stronger than we thought after you broke through to Principles Master,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“That’s normal. During the years I was trapped, my cultivation of sword principle had improved greatly. I have created advanced level seven absolute arts. As for elementary level seven absolute arts, I have created many of them. Now that I have made a breakthrough, my strength is no weaker than that of an ordinary Ruler. With the advantage of the absolute arts, I can indeed gain the upper hand when fighting with an ordinary elementary Ruler. Of course, the Heaven Ancestor must have held back a little,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Don’t hold back for me. I know very well whether you have held back or not.” The Heaven Ancestor curled his lips.

Jian Wushuang could only smile.

“Not bad. To have such strength right after breaking through is already much stronger than we expected. If you can get a suitable supreme treasure divine weapon, your strength should be even stronger,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“Xuan God, is there any result for the Supreme Treasure Divine Sword?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked at Daoist Xuan God.

Before he went into seclusion, Daoist Xuan God had told him that he would find a way to get a supreme treasure divine sword for him. Now that 3,000 years had passed, there should be a result.

“That divine sword is a bit troublesome.” Daoist Xuan God frowned.

“Troublesome?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“My young friend, I told you before that the most powerful supreme treasure, the Divine Sword, is in the hands of an extremely powerful Ruler, who is also the leader of a major force.” Daoist Xuan God said seriously, “Originally, I had prepared sufficient resources. Not to say that I could completely impress him, but using these things I prepared to exchange for the most powerful supreme treasure, which he doesn’t need at all, he should have definitely made a profit. The possibility of him agreeing should be very high, but the result was completely beyond my expectations.”

“Did he refuse?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It would be easy if he refused on the spot. Since he refused so decisively, it means that the supreme true treasure divine sword is not useless to him. On the contrary, he may value it more. For example, if an expert who specializes in sword principle breaks through to become a Ruler, he can leave the divine sword to him. But the key point is that he did not refuse directly at the beginning.”

He paused for a moment, Daoist Xuan God continued, “He didn’t reject me directly. Instead, he asked me who I wanted to give the supreme treasure sword to. Since the Ruler had nothing to do with the Sacred Island and had no grudge with my Star Palace, I didn’t think too much about it and said that it was for you. Unexpectedly, the Ruler immediately changed his mind and said that he would never give you the supreme treasure sword.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

At first, he did not refuse, but when he heard that Daoist Xuan God would give him the divine sword, he immediately changed his face?

It was obvious that the Ruler had a lot of opinions about him.

“What’s going on, my young friend, apart from Sacred Island, have you offended other Rulers in this territory?” Temporal Temple Master looked at him.

“Well...I don’t know. Although I’ve been in the three battlefields for a while, I haven’t really offended many experts. As for the Rulers, I’ve been in the three battlefields for a long time, but I’ve never met any other Rulers except those from Sacred Island,” Jian Wushuang said.

He was puzzled.

When he was in the three battlefields, he had been very careful and did not offend any experts, let alone the Rulers.

Why did any of the Rulers have such a strong opinion of him?

“Xuan God, what’s going on?” Temporal Temple Master looked at Xuan God.

“I asked and the Ruler told me the reason. It does have something to do with the Heavenly Sword Marquis.” Xuan God took a deep breath, he asked, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, when you were in Devil Smoke Valley, did you have any dealings with the people of the North Sea Palace?”

“The North Sea Palace?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

Among all the forces in this territory, the North Sea Palace, which was ranked in the top three, could be said to be an Ruler in this territory. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jian Wushuang really had dealings with the North Sea Palace.

“Could it be them?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened, he said, “When I was wandering in Devil Smoke Valley, I met with the Shi Yan Master and the Red Eye Master. The Shi Yan Master and the Red Eye Master worked together to search for prey in the Nine Twists Demon Cave in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley and forcibly seized the treasures in each other’s hands. At that time, they found me.”

“What happened in the end?” Daoist Xuan God asked.

“They were strong, but they were not as skilled as me. I was fine during the encounter, but they suffered a great loss,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Not just a great loss. I heard from the Ruler that you almost killed the Red Eye Master during the encounter,” Daoist Xuan God said strangely.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “If they wanted to kill me, I would fight back with all my strength. If I had the chance to kill one of them, I wouldn’t show any mercy. Red Eye Master underestimated me and was severely taught a lesson. If it weren’t for one of the masters, she would have been dead.”

“That’s it.” Daoist Xuan God shrugged. “The Ruler who has the Supreme Treasure Divine Sword is one of the leaders of the North Sea Palace, Master Sky Roc. He is also the strongest expert in the North Sea Palace. The Red Eye Master who almost died in your hands is one of his direct descendants.”

“Direct descendants?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“My young friend, you might not know this, but the Sky Roc Ruler is an extremely ancient Ruler. He rose to power very early. When he rose to power, his family soared to the sky because of him and became a great Ruler of his Fang Xingjie. He has stood tall and firm for a long time. After so many years, there are many members in his family, and naturally, some of them are extremely talented!”
