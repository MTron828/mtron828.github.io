“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are a rank four True Saint, but you have the battle strength of a rank seven True Saint. Such talent is simply unbelievable. Logically, you should have a bright future, but unfortunately, you are too arrogant and treat my Purple Cloud Pavilion as your opponent. Today, I will leave you, a top genius, here!”

“Die!”

“Die!”

Bai Yuan’s eyes turned cold, but he opened his mouth and spat out a pitch-black bead.

After he spat it out, the bead exploded with a bang and turned into black energy that filled the sky, fusing into the green longsword in Bai Yuan’s hand.

“Wind God!”

Bai Yuan’s killing intent flashed, and he immediately drew his sword.

He took a step forward, and the longsword in his hand suddenly stabbed towards the empty space in front of him.

As he thrust, ripples immediately spread out in the void.

Bai Yuan was using a longsword, but the move he was using felt like a spear thrust.

The moment he thrust, a green lightning bolt pierced through the void and shot toward Jian Wushuang.

Fast, too fast.

Even Jian Wushuang, who was good at space-time principles and was very fast, could not help being shocked when he saw the green lightning bolt.

“This sword move...is even faster than my life-and-death moment?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Among the seven sword moves in the Wushuang Sword Manual, the fastest one was the life-and-death moment, which was a sure-kill sword move.

However, at this moment, the speed of the sword move that Bai Yuan displayed was obviously faster than his life-and-death moment.

Jian Wushuang had only thought of defending himself against such a terrifying speed, but the cyan sword light had already struck Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

Bang!

A low boom sounded. Jian Wushuang’s body shook violently, and he suffered a heavy blow.

The cyan lightning instantly made a hole in the golden armor on his body. Then, a bloody hole the size of a bowl appeared on Jian Wushuang’s divine body, the black energy formed by the black bead also entered Jian Wushuang’s body and began to erode wildly.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He closed his eyes and felt the erosion of the black energy in his body.

However, it only took a moment for Jian Wushuang to open his eyes again.

“As expected of a rank seven True Saint. Your move just now was quite good.” Jian Wushuang grinned and revealed a cold smile.

“He didn’t die?” Bai Yuan was extremely surprised.

His strongest move, which was combined with the black bead, was a sure-kill move. Logically speaking, even if a rank seven True Saint was hit, the chances of survival would not be high. However, this rank four True Saint...actually survived this move.

Not only did he survive, but it seemed that even his divine power had not been eroded by much.

“Bai Yuan, you’ve used your most powerful skill. Now, you should try one of my moves.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. The next moment, he slowly raised the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

The sword was placed in front of him.

However, this simple act of raising the sword instantly stirred up the surrounding space and time, and the surrounding void became completely blood-red.

Yes, it was blood-red!

The blood-red sky, the blood-red earth, and even the air were filled with a large amount of blood fog.

Bai Yuan and the surrounding experts who were watching the battle even seemed to see the bones under Jian Wushuang’s feet forming a blood sea. The sky-shaking killing intent soared to the sky, causing everyone to feel a trace of fear.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was no longer a human cultivator, but an asura who had transformed into hell!

This was a blood-colored Asura!

The blood-colored Asura raised the sword in its hand and slowly slashed out.

It was a simple slash as if it did not contain any power.

However, the moment the Blood Mountain Sword was slashed out, a huge sense of fear instantly surged into Bai Yuan’s heart.

Whoosh!

The sword light finally fell.

The seventh move of the Peerless Sword Manual, the strongest move, Blood Asura!

The sword light slashed out with earth-shaking power.

Bai Yuan was about to block the sword when a wave of space-time power suddenly came.

The space-time around Bai Yuan instantly became stagnant.

This stagnant state only lasted for a short time and was almost negligible.

However, in a fight between experts, especially those who had reached the level of a rank seven True Saint, many things could be done in a split second.

At least, the sword light that Jian Wushuang had displayed appeared in front of Bai Yuan. When Bai Yuan came back to his senses, he could no longer block the sword light. He could not even raise his longsword with much difficulty.

Bang!

The sword light was not hindered at all. It directly cut into Bai Yuan’s divine body. Bai Yuan immediately let out a muffled groan and his body suddenly retreated. However, his divine body was not directly destroyed.

Seeing this scene, Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh.

“Bai Yuan’s body-protection ability is indeed strong. Not only did my blood Asura merge with the heaven-designated skill, but the power of his swordsmanship is also extremely terrifying. However, even such a sword attack, without any hindrance, could not cause his divine body to directly collapse,” Jian Wushuang muttered, however, he was not disappointed at all.

“More than half of the 30 breaths’ time has been used up. In a little while, the experts of Purple Cloud Pavilion will arrive. I can’t waste any more time with him. I’ll use that move directly. It would be best if I could kill him, but if I can’t, I’ll have to leave directly.” Jian Wushuang’s face became extremely solemn.

Blood Asura was the strongest and most terrifying sword move he had ever created.

However, this sword move was not his strongest trump card.

He had many trump cards, such as the Mountain River Map, which he had never used.

But now, Jian Wushuang had no intention of using the Mountain River Map. He had another trump card.

He had just mastered this trump card and had never really fought in front of others.

“You’re lucky to be the first target of my secret skill, Bai Yuan.” Jian Wushuang smiled. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Cut the crap. Show me what you’ve got.” Bai Yuan was not afraid at all. He did not believe that Jian Wushuang could kill him because of his strong protective ability, of course, he did not want to kill Jian Wushuang himself. He just wanted to keep fighting with Jian Wushuang and stall for time until the three True Saints at the peak of rank seven arrived. Then he could easily surround and kill Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, as you wish.”

Jian Wushuang did not waste any more words. With a faint smile, the vast divine power on his body instantly surged.

Splash! A large amount of divine power surged, instantly forming a huge divine power sea. However, the divine power in this divine power sea was being consumed at a crazy rate.

“Six paths of reincarnation, hell path, extremely hot hell!”
