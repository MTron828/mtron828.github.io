Chapter 793: Master’s Gifts (Section B)

“Suppression?” Jian Wushuang said with a curious expression.

He had never heard that a magic weapon could, in addition to releasing overbearing offensive power, turn into a mountain to suppress the opponent.

He had also never witnessed anyone try to refine a huge mountain into a magic weapon.

The only explanation was the unusual means that his Master had used.

“Take this magic weapon now. You can refine it and become its official owner.” Xuan Yi’s mind stirred, causing the gigantic mountain to shrink and return to his palm. He handed the miniature Sword Mountain to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it. Stifling his astonishment, he started to refine the weapon to take ownership of it.

This process went quite smoothly. After a moment, Jian Wushuang successfully mastered the magic weapon.

Now, he could fully control the magic weapon. He could direct the magic weapon to turn into a two-meter-long scarlet longsword or transform into a real mountain.

He had also learnt another Secret Skill about Suppression. This Secret Skill, together with the Sword Mountain, would easily suppress the opponent.

Once suppressed, his opponent’s life would be under Jian Wushuang’s control even if he was a Dao Master.

“This really is an incredible magic weapon.” Jian Wushuang said in admiration. “Master, does this magic weapon have a name?”

“I just refined it so I haven’t named it yet. Why don’t you do it?” Xuan Yi beamed.

“Name it?” Jian Wushuang squinted. He flipped his hand and the magic weapon turned into a two-meter scarlet longsword. Its aura was overwhelming.

“Since this sword was refined from the Sword Mountain and it is as scarlet as blood, I shall call it the Blood Mountain Sword.” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“Blood Mountain Sword?” Xuan Yi shrugged indifferently. “This magic weapon is extraordinarily powerful and valuable. You need to be prudent when using it. You’d better not use it except in dire circumstances.”

“When I refined this magic weapon, I used my skills to conceal its aura and some of its wonders. Most won’t be able to see its special qualities. Anyone perceptive enough to detect its extraordinary features would certainly kill you for it, even if he is already a Dao Master.”

“Even a Dao Master would want to have it?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback. Then, he nodded gravely.

He knew that the Blood Mountain Sword was quite unusual. He would never resort to using it unless he was desperate.

“I’ve presented you with the first treasure. Next, I’ll show you the second one.” Xuan Yi took out another token.

“A token?” Jian Wushuang looked at it.

“This token is devised to save your life.” Xuan Yi smiled blandly. “When you fought against Tian Yunzi’s doppelganger, you crumbled a wilted leaf and nearly killed it. You must have obtained that wilted leaf in the Eternal Zone, right?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“The token I’ll give you is of the same nature as that wilted leaf, but it’s more useful.” Xuan Yi said. “This token contains three streaks of Sword Essences. Once you’ve refined it, you can guide the three streaks of Sword Essence to battle with your enemies or to break up a formation. Anyway, only use it at crucial moments.”

“The first streak of Sword Essence is the weakest and the third is the strongest. Although the first streak of Sword Essence is the most vulnerable one, it is comparable to, and may even exceed the power of the wilted leaf you used.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The first streak among the three streaks of Sword Essence was the weakest, but it was still more powerful than the one Elder Yi had stored in the wilted leaf?

Elder Yi was a Three-star Ancient God. He released Dao Master’s Power even if he just pointed at a random spot. When Jian Wushuang had crushed that wilted leaf, the power released had been staggering. Even the Original Body of Tian Yunzi was hurt when he strode forward to block the power.

But the three streaks of Sword Essence were more powerful?

“Master, how did you come by such a powerful token?” Jian Wushuang asked skeptically.

“Haha, I actually got this token by luck.” Xuan Yi explained. “Back then, when I was traveling around, I met a Sword Principle expert whose strength was terrifying. His name was Sword Eleven. In the Eternal World, he was known as the Sunrise Sword Emperor!”

“Sword Emperor?”Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Given that Sword Eleven was referred to as Sword Emperor, his Sword Principle cultivation must be extraordinary.

“Sword Eleven’s cultivation in swordsmanship reached great heights a long time ago. When I first met him, he happened to be in need of my help. So, I did him a favor. He gave me this token as a reward.” Xuan Yi recounted his story with a smile.

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang scowled suspiciously.

Could this be the real story?

A Sword Emperor of the Eternal World had asked his Master for a favor?

Jian Wushuang shook his head and took the token without a second thought.

“Now I’ve given you two treasures. As for the third treasure…it’s the same as your First Senior Brother’s gift.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Xuan Yi beamed at Jian Wushuang and said, “The third treasure is quite special. Even I find it extremely hard to refine. At present, I’m still preparing it and cannot give it to you yet. Later, I’ll find a suitable time to deliver it to you.”

“Yeah, thank you, Master.” Jian Wushuang nodded in anticipation.

Xue Lingtian was a man of prominent status and dreadful strength. If even he needed to expend some effort to prepare it, Jian Wushuang knew that the gift had to be extremely valuable!

Now, his Master, who could refine a natural mountain into a peerless magic weapon with brilliant skills, was preparing the third treasure for him. Since his Master found it difficult to refine, it must be even more impressive.

Although Jian Wushuang could not get his hands on the two treasures yet, he was already quite contented.

“Master, there is one more thing I wanted to ask.” Jian Wushuang said abruptly.

“Go ahead.” Xuan Yi said, still beaming.

“I spent a hundred years in the Eternal Zone. During those years, the Ancient God Clan in the Eternal Zone treated me as their own clansman.?That’s why I didn’t die but instead became stronger.” Jian Wushuang said. He stared at Xuan Yi, anxious at how he would react.

Xuan Yi merely sniffed but his expression was unchanged. He remained mild-mannered and did not appear pleased or angry.

“Do you know why they treated me like that, Master?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“How would I know that?” Xuan Yi shook his head repeatedly.

“Does the whole thing really have nothing to do with the Univeral Dao Scripture that you gave me?” Jian Wushuang’s brows furrowed.

He had speculated at length about why he had the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan. The most likely explanation was the Univeral Dao Scripture.
