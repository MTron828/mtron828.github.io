Chapter 295: Sister?

Mansion Master?

Although there were many forces in the Tang Dynasty, all of them would intentionally avoid naming themselves with “Mansion.”

The Tang Dynasty was divided into 21 large prefectures, and in each prefecture there was one real top expert acting as the Mansion Master. Normally, it was an expert of the Saint Realm.

In Skywave Prefecture, the only one that could be referred to as Mansion Master was, of course, the Lord of Skywave Prefecture.

“They are from the Skywave Prefecture?”?Looking at the elder, Jian Wushuang pulled a long face.

The Heartless Sect was recognized as the top force in the Skywave Prefecture, but the Prefecture itself was not included in the ranking.

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture was a Half-saint, like the black-clothed elder. But, in truth, his strength surpassed ordinary Half-saints’.

On the Bloodmoon List, the Lord of Skywave Prefecture ranked 21st, even though he was just a Half-saint.

All the experts who ranked 22th to 27th on the Bloodmoon List were in the Saint Realm, but even they ranked lower than the Lord of Skywave Prefecture. Which meant the man was stronger than ordinary experts of the Saint Realm. That was why he could become a master of a prefecture and the overlord of the region. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jian Wushuang never thought that this little girl was from the Skywave Prefecture, and he would have had nothing to do with this if the girl had not made up a story saying that she handed over something to him. Worst of all, those Skywave Prefecture’s guys believed her story.

“Boy, now that you know we are from the Skywave Prefecture, you should give that thing to me immediately. Otherwise, our Mansion Master will burn you and the Heartless Sect into ash with his anger,” said the elder in a cold voice.

Jian Wushuang shot a glance at the elder and said, “Are all the people in the Skywave Prefecture as stupid as you? I told you several times already that she didn’t give me anything. Believe whatever the hell you like, but if you want to solve this with violence, I don’t mind playing it to the bone.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was extremely cold.

Skywave Prefecture? So what?

He didn’t want to expose himself to them, but it didn’t mean that he feared their Lord.

The elder looked sullen, and his killing intent soared. “Whatever, in no way will I let you just walk away. Take the girl, and kill them all!”

Following the order, the experts led by the elder went straight toward Jian Wushuang and the others to kill them.

“You two, be careful when fighting with them,” Jian Wushuang said toward Tai Shan and Mo Ying.

The two looked solemn, ready to fight. However, the girl hid behind Jian Wushuang, and spoke in a low voice, “Just a moment. Please hold them off. My sister is coming here, and when she arrives, they’ll have no hold on you.”

“Humph, you’re so cunning, I’m sure your sister will be too.” Jian Wushuang gave the girl a dark look.

This whole thing should have nothing to do with him, but now he was involved for such a ridiculous reason.

This girl really had caused him some unexpected trouble, so he was not going to give her a kind look.

The elder and his men started attacking.

“Get the hell out of my way,” Jian Wushuang thundered.

He drew out his sword, and when he held it up, an overwhelming power burst out. As he swung the sword at his opponents, the surroundings seemed to be stirred by his sword.

This blow was overwhelming and swept over everything.

Seeing this blow, the elder could not help being frightened. He immediately shouted, “Quick, work together and stop him.”

The experts from the Skywave Prefecture all tried their best to block Jian Wushuang’s attack, and they made it, but only just barely. The blow cast all of them away.

“No way!”

“So powerful?”

“Jesus!”

The elder and the experts from the Skywave Prefecture were stunned.

As far as they could see, Jian Wushuang was much stronger than an ordinary Half-saint.

“I didn’t use my full strength in that blow,” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice resounded throughout the area.

It was true. He just used the power of the Origin and the fifth move of the Selfless Sword Technique in that blow. Since he didn’t display the Sword Realm, it was indeed an attack with reservations.

Hearing this, the black-clothed elder stood there while hesitating.

But right at that moment...

The whole world suddenly came to a standstill.

The wind lulled and the raindrops froze in the air.

Jian Wushuang, the black-clothed elder, and the others in the area felt like they couldn’t breathe. They were barely able to keep a clear mind, yet unable to move even a bit.

Time seemed to stand still.

“What’s... what’s going on here?”?Jian Wushuang was panic-stricken.

Tai Shan and Mo Ying, who were behind him, as well as the black-clothed elder, and the others in front of him, stared in horror with their eyes wide open.

Terrible horror!

Horror to such an extent that they had never experienced before.

Even Jian Wushuang felt some fear rise in his heart.

Except for the little girl. She smiled happily when seeing the sudden change and said, “My sister arrived.”

The girl moved away and leaped into the air. The frozen space seemed to have no affect on her at all.

Though Jian Wushuang and the black-clothed elder could not move, they managed to look in the direction which the girl moved to.

In their sight, a frosty woman in white, beautiful beyond description, was walking toward them.

Whiter than snow, eyes like a clear spring, she was so elegant and graceful that everyone would be stunned and feel a sense of inferiority while looking at her. But, in spite of her cold appearance, there was something about her that caused everyone to be unable to resist being lost in reverie.

“Is... is she a goddess?” An expert from Skywave Prefecture murmured.

Goddess, she was indeed a goddess.

Even Jian Wushuang was stunned by the women’s beauty and aura.

She was like nothing in the world.

She was so beautiful that the many experts here, even the black-clothed elder with a hundred years of experience, had never seen such a beauty.

Most of all, she had a terrifying power that caused everyone to tremble.
