Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“They are the Wind and Rain Immortals.”

Wang Yuan introduced the two newcomers to Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan, “They two have ascended to transcendence for a long time and mastered Domain. Their skills are so strong that they can rank in the top 10 of the Bloodmoon List in the Tang Dynasty.”

”?Oh??”Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Experts of the Saint Realm who have mastered Domain can be at the peak of the whole Nanyang Continent.”?He thought.

“The Wind and Rain Immortals owe our Alchemy School a favor, so I let my father invite them here after some difficulties,” Wang Yuan said helplessly, “the relationship between our Alchemy School and the Holy Emperor Palace is like fire and water. Thus the Holy Emperor Palace would not offend Ice Nether Valley just for me, the young master of the Alchemy School. I had my father invite these two to help in the current situation, which is a good result for now.”

Jian Wushuang nodded gently to show his understanding.

“The Wind and Rain two Immortals, me, together with you two young guys, are still inadequate in scale,” the Wine Master said quietly, “I have a good friend. She is an unrestrained solitary expert. I’ll try to send messages to her and see whether she will join us.”

“Thank you, Master.” Yang Zaixuan expressed thanks immediately.

“We’re very grateful for your help.” Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan also expressed their gratitude.

“But even if I invite that good friend of mine here, we are still a little weak,” the Wine Master said pensively.

“This is the Tang Dynasty. There are numerous outstanding experts fond of killing. As long as you can afford the price to invite one or two experts, there would be no big difficulty with this plan,” the Wind Immortal said in a solemn way.

“Speaking of treasures, I have one here.” Jian Wushuang opened his hands, and a long pitch-black spear appeared in his hands immediately.

The long pitch-dark spear was held in the hand of Jian Wushuang, vaguely releasing formidable energy.

“Superior third-grade magic weapon?”

Seeing the long pitch-dark spear, the people around showed surprise in their eyes.

A superior third-grade magic weapon would capture the hearts of many experts of the Saint Realm.

“Nice.” The Wine Master nodded slightly. “I know a powerful person who is good at spear techniques. He has been looking for a suitable magic weapon. If we invite him at the cost of this superior third-grade magic weapon, I think he would agree to come help.

“In addition, you have Wrath of Gale and Thunder...

“On the Bloodmoon List of the Tang Dynasty, the sixth-ranked Old Weirdo Yunyuang has lived for many years. He has aspired to obtain the most powerful skill manual which would help him perform formidable skills. What he most yearned for is Wrath of Gale and Thunder in the Holy Emperor Palace. As long as you gave him this manual, I can assure you that he would absolutely try his best to assist you.”

A joyful expression appeared on the face of Jian Wushuang.

The Wrath of Gale and Thunder is a superior second-grade manual, so the Holy Emperor Palace valued it highly. When the Holy Emperor Palace handed it to Tan Feng, they had made an agreement that Tan Feng could not impart this manual to anyone else.

But now Tan Feng was killed by Jian Wushuang, and this manual fell into his hands. He could do whatever he wanted, without caring about the Holy Emperor Palace.

“I have no problem giving him the Wrath of Gale and Thunder,” Jian Wushuang said without any hesitation.

“With the help of those two, our force is strong enough. Although we cannot wipe out the entire Ice Nether Valley, it should be enough for us to create a mess there,” the Wine Master said with a smile.

“In that case, we will rely on you to invite them, Senior,” Jian Wushuang said.

The Wine Master nodded gently, and then he left immediately to send the invitations.

...

Three days later, the Six Experts of the Saint Realm gathered together in the Ditian Prefecture!

The Six Experts of the Saint Realm sat on the chairs of the lobby respectively, and at the top sat the Wine Master impressively.

The Wine Master was well-known in the Nanyang Continent for hundreds of years. He even ranked third on the Bloodmoon List of the Tang Dynasty. It was said that he had attained the “Pinnacle” in his comprehension of Origin many years ago. He was strong enough to be considered one of the top experts in the Nanyang Continent.

Beside the Wine Master sat a black-clothed woman. She looked old with wrinkles on her face, but her eyes were clear and bright. With a faint smile on lips, she sat there at ease, and looked quite affable.

This black-clothed woman was actually the good friend of the Wine Master, known as “Lady Black” in the Nanyang Continent.

Lady Black was renowned for a long time. Although she was slightly less mighty than the Wine Master, the gap between them was quite small. She had already mastered the third stage of the Domain, just a step’s distance from the Pinnacle.

Below the Wine Master and Lady Black sat the Wind and Rain Immortals.

They were qualified enough to rank the top 10 on the Bloodmoon List, and they were not weaker than Tan Feng who was killed by Jian Wushuang.

As for the last two experts of the Saint Realm...

One was an old fellow. His messy hair and sackcloth made him look quite haggard. This elder was actually Old Weirdo Yunyang. He was a real old monster, for he had lived longer than all the people there.

However, the skills of this old monster were unfathomable. Although he just mastered Second-stage Domain, it was said an expert who had mastered Third-stage Domain could not defeat him.

Now, on the Bloodmoon List of the Tang Dynasty, the Old Weirdo Yunyang ranked the sixth.

The other one was a red-haired old man, who looked cold. The most eye-catching characteristic was his red eyebrows.

Chi Mei was not very famous on the Nanyang Continent, but he was renowned in the Tang Dynasty and ranked 13th on the Bloodmoon List. Although his rank was a little lower, he was still an expert who had mastered the Domain.

The Six Experts of Saints, together with Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan, made up the battle formation for the plan.

This battle formation could be said to be very formidable.

“Distinguished guests, I think you know the plan.” Jian Wushuang mainly set his eyes on the Old Weirdo Yunyang and Chi Mei when he said these words.

In the heart of Jian Wushuang, four of the Six experts of Immortals could be seen as teammates on his own side. But, the other two were different, for they were only here for the superior third-grade magic weapon and Wrath of Gale and Thunder, thus the relationship between them and him was just like an employer and employee.

“I know.” Old Weirdo Yunyang nodded his head carelessly.

“Aha, Ice Nether Valley, one of the Three Valleys, I thought you were mad when I heard you were going to attack?Ice Nether Valley. But now it seems a little interesting,” Chi Mei said with a somber laugh. Meanwhile, his eyes glanced at the experts one by one. “Wine Master, Lady Black, the Wind and Rain Immortals, and even Old Weirdo Monster are here. What a magnificent scene!”

“Without a strong team, how would we dare to challenge Ice Nether Valley?” Jian Wushuang said in a piercingly cold voice.

They three brothers were the leaders in the plan. Due to the special identity of Wang Yuan, it was inconvenient for him to appear personally. Yang Zaixuan was cold in temperament and not fond of talking. Naturally, all the things in this plan would be decided by Jian Wushuang himself.

“Little guy, who are you? So many experts are here, so who gave you, a little guy of the Yang Void Realm, permission to speak?” Chi Mei glanced at Jian Wushuang while emanating an overwhelming aura.

Facing the suppression of the aura, Jian Wushuang showed an indifferent expression, as if the aura were a cool breeze.
