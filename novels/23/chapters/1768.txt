Chapter 1769: Scheme

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Boom!

The universe shook and the Life Destroying Thunder Dragon which stretched across a distance of tens of thousands of miles charged into the sea of thunder and moved around violently, causing the sea of thunder to be in disarray.

However, after a short amount of time, the infinite amount of green sacred thunder in the sea of thunder tore apart the Life Destroying Thunder Dragon.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Although the Thunder Attracting Skill was one of the Three Secret Skills of the Ancient God Clan and its power would be out of the ordinary if it were unleashed with Jian Wushuang’s current Divine Power, in the end, this Secret Skill would only be more powerful if it were unleashed with Ancient God Power. Moreover, Jian Wushuang had not fully mastered this Secret Skill yet. Hence, it was normal for him to not be able to match the sea of thunder which Emperor God Tian Xiao had unleashed.

When the thunder dragon was destroyed, the sea of thunder continued to head toward Jian Wushuang. At the same time, Emperor God Tian Xiao himself was heading over.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword left its scabbard. The sword light was sharp and it was swung out while imbued with Reincarnation Power.

The sea of thunder which was already in disarray after the attack of the Life Destroying Thunder Dragon was split open by force and it started to spread in all directions immediately.

However, Emperor God Tian Xiao’s body came out of the crack of the sea of thunder fiercely. Along the way, three boundless thunder lights emerged and they formed three figures beside him.

The three figures were exactly the same as Emperor God Tian Xiao. All of them were holding a big hammer each and they had a huge amount of aura.

“Forming three clones at the same time. Moreover, their abilities are all so strong?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The Secret Skill that Emperor God Tian Xiao had just unleashed was indeed exceptional.

The three thunderbolt clones that he had created should have fifty percent of his real body’s fighting capabilities. If they were to team up, they would certainly pose a threat.

“Jian Wushuang, die!” Emperor God Tian God with filled with an immeasurable amount of murderous intent.

“Haha, who is afraid of whom!?”

Jian Wushuang laughed heartily. When Emperor God Tian Xiao and his three thunderbolt clones attacked, Jian Wushuang’s body shook violently. After that, heads and arms started to appear from his stalwart Ancient God body.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang changed into a state where he had five heads and ten arms.

His ten arms were each holding a sword.

After that, he attacked right away and clashed with Emperor God Tian Xiao head-on.

Shocking booming sounds could be heard repeatedly and the sounds were extremely loud.

Jian Wushuang’s swift and huge sword light as well as Emperor God Tian Xiao’s fierce big hammer which contained an infinite amount of thunderbolt clashed in the void head-on. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Every time they clashed, the power generated from the clash would shake the universe and this caused many of the cultivators present to shiver with fear.

In the surrounding void, countless cultivators’ throats felt restless and they were observing the shocking battle between the two experts in front of them with their eyes opened wide.

The battle had caused the place to plunge into chaos and caused it to be filled with darkness.

The surrounding people had already been overwhelmed by it since a long time ago.

It was unknown how much time had passed…

“Piss off!”

Jian Wushuang gave a furious roar and his Blood Mountain Sword expanded into a towering sword immediately. It was then swung fiercely.

“What a joke,” Emperor God Tian Xiao laughed coldly and his big hammer was swung out mightily to intercept the towering sword.

Boom!

With a loud sound, the bodies of Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Tian Xiao were both sent flying.

After they regained their posture, Emperor God Tian Xiao still had a huge amount of aura like before. As for the three thunderbolt clones beside him, they were uninjured.

As for Jian Wushuang, he originally had five heads and ten arms. However, at that moment, two heads had already burst and there were some marks of thunderbolts sweeping past his body. It was obvious that he looked a bit miserable.

Emperor God Tian Xiao was indeed an Emperor God-level super expert. By unleashing a Secret Skill to create three thunderbolt clones to team up with him, even though Jian Wushuang possessed five heads and ten arms and had combined that with his attack skills, he was still at a disadvantage.

“Jian Wushuang, I admit that your abilities are already enough for you to stand on equal footing with a normal Emperor God. However, you are still very far away from being able to compete with me,” Emperor God Tian Xiao said in an icy tone.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang gave a weird laughter, “Emperor God Tian Xiao, as one of the founders of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, you must have collected information about me before taking action against me. Hence, you should know this. When I fought with an Almighty for the first time, which is when I fought with Sir God Qian Lan of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, what did I use to suppress him?”

Upon hearing that, Emperor God Tian Xiao’s expression changed abruptly. At the same time, he could hear two sounds of intense wind coming from behind him.

The two sounds of wind were two brilliant rays of golden light and they were dragging their long golden tails along with them. They then swept past the void and headed for his head with lightning speed.

For the two Hong Jun Golden Swords, Jian Wushuang had been hiding them intentionally. Ever since he had started to fight with Emperor God Tian Xiao, he had not used them. Even when he was at a disadvantage in close-quarters combat, he still did not use them. It was not until then that the two Hong Jun Golden Swords appeared behind Emperor God Tian Xiao quietly…

This was a killing move that Jian Wushuang had concealed and prepared carefully to the best of his abilities.

Two rays of golden light moved quickly and they contained an enormous amount of power.

It was too fast and too sudden.

When Emperor God Tian Xiao realized it, there was no time for him to dodge or block it. However, at that critical moment, Emperor God Tian Xiao gave a cold snort and the golden robe that he wore changed into golden armor instantly. The golden armor started to spread quickly and it covered his whole body in a split second. Naturally, his head was covered.

Clang! Clang!

The two Hong Jun Golden Swords struck Emperor God Tian Xiao’s head in succession. Moreover, they struck the same position.

As there was a great amount of attack power, Emperor God Tian Xiao’s body was sent flying and it was only after a long time that he regained his posture. After that, Emperor God Tian Xiao turned his head and revealed a face that was slightly pale. At the same time, there was some blood at the corners of his mouth and his eyes were filled with flames of fury.

“Jian Wushuang, from the very start, you have hidden these two golden swords intentionally. You are really scheming and it is a great move. If not for me possessing defensive armor, I would have fallen to your scheme,” Emperor God Tian Xiao said furiously.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank.

“Is that golden armor Emperor God Tian Xiao’s second Chaos Divine Treasure?” Jian Wushuang murmured. There was nothing that he could do.

Emperor God experts were extremely powerful and it was not easy to kill them.

Jian Wushuang had known that since a long time ago. Hence, he had hidden his Hong Jun Golden Swords at the start. After that, he would have found the perfect opportunity to launch a surprise attack and attempt to deal a heavy blow to Emperor God Tian Xiao.

However, it was a pity that Emperor God Tian Xiao possessed a Chaos Divine Treasure-level defensive armor. With his armor bearing the impact of his Hong Jun Golden Swords’ attack, he got off with light injuries.

“As expected of one of the founders of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. With that defensive armor, even if top Emperor Gods were to attack you personally, they would probably be unable to kill you as well,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Hmph, while you are unable to kill me, I am able to kill you,” Emperor God Tian Xiao’s eyes turned ice-cold. The moment his words left his mouth, he flipped his palm abruptly and a pitch-black, long arrow appeared on his hand. The surface of the pitch-black, long arrow was covered with a layer of dim light and the dim light looked unusually strange.

The moment Emperor God Tian Xiao took out the long arrow, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank fiercely.
