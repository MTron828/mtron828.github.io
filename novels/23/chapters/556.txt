Jian Wushuang stood in the meeting hall while the rest of the figures were sitting on chairs.

These figures were all Temple Masters, and there were nine of them in total.

The only person here that Jian Wushuang knew was Temple Master Pure Moon. He had never met the other eight Temple Masters, who, at this very moment, were staring at him as if he was a monster.

“He comprehended the Slaughter Dao while still in the Saint Realm and had the battle strength of a superior emperor, which was simply incredible. It’s a pity that such a peerless genius is an outsider and not?originally from our Monster Continent.”

The Temple Masters whispered.

“Jian Wushuang,”

Temple Master Pure Moon suddenly spoke, “You killed Emperor Golden Snake during the Life-death Duel, so your strength is already equal to a superior emperor. Hence, you can become a Divine Emperor of our Monster-exterminating League in place of Golden Snake. Are you willing to take the position?”

If Jian Wushuang had been from the Monster Continent, he would definitely agree to become a Divine Emperor without any hesitation.

But he was an outsider, so he had to personally agree before they could appoint him as a Divine Emperor.

“Divine Emperor?” Jian Wushuang thought for a moment before nodding. “Yes.”

His strength had a lot of room for improvement and he was not in a hurry to leave the Monster Continent. Furthermore, he wanted to make use of some resources from the Monster-exterminating League to enhance his strength. Therefore, he definitely had to become a Divine Emperor.

“Being a Divine Emperor comes?with some obligations that I hope you can meet. After all, the resources of the Monster-exterminating League can’t be used for free,” said Temple Master Pure Moon.

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

It was natural that he would have to perform certain duties if he wanted to receive rewards.

“Since you’re a Divine Emperor now, you can give yourself a title,” said Temple Master Pure Moon.

All of the Divine Emperors and Temple Masters of the Monster-exterminating League used their own titles, so few people knew their real names.

“Title...” Jian Wushuang thought for a while before he said with a smile, “In my hometown, experts at the Divine Emperor level are called sovereigns. Plus, my surname, Jian, means sword and I’m good at Sword Principle. So, from today on, I’ll be known as Sword Emperor.”

“Sword Emperor?” Temple Master Pure Moon nodded slightly. “I’ll quickly spread the news that you have been appointed as a Divine Emperor. After that, it won’t take long for the information to spread to the human population and the Demonic Beasts. Everyone on the Monster Continent will hear about your title, Sword Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang gave a faint smile, but he didn’t really care.

“Sword Emperor.” Just then, a bearded middle-aged man, who was sitting on one of the seats, opened his mouth.

After hearing this middle-aged man’s voice, Temple Master Pure Moon and the other Temple Masters had strange expressions on their faces.

The middle-aged man was none other than Temple Master Iceberg!

If it had not been for him, the Life-death Duel between Jian Wushuang and Emperor Golden Snake wouldn’t have even happened.

“Do you have anything to say, Temple Master Iceberg?” Temple Master Pure Moon asked with great interest.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly as he immediately looked at Temple Master Iceberg.

“Ha ha.” Temple Master Iceberg smiled with a soft face as he looked at Jian Wushuang in a very friendly manner. “I just want to apologize to you, Sword Emperor.”

“Apologize?” The other Temple Masters’ expressions changed a bit.

Jian Wushuang’s expression also changed slightly.

“Alas!” Temple Master Iceberg let out a light sigh and said, “I watched Golden Snake grow up, step by step, and he had always been extremely respectful to me. When he came to me, begging, I promised to give him a hand for the sake of the respect he had shown me all these years.”

“I was wrong, but I hope you don’t take it amiss, Sword Emperor. If you’re discontented with me, say it out. I can offer some treasures or Monster Cores as compensation.”

Temple Master Iceberg’s words were very sincere as if he was really apologizing to Jian Wushuang.

His behavior greatly surprised Temple Master Pure Moon and the others.

After all, Temple Master Iceberg ranked third among the Temple Masters in the Monster-exterminating League. Besides, he had always been quite domineering. Few of the other Temple Masters dared to provoke him.

For that reason, when he came forward on behalf of Emperor Golden Snake, few Temple Masters dared to not give him face.

But now, Temple Master Iceberg, who was usually so domineering, actually made amends to a Divine Emperor of his own accord?

Did the sun rise in the east?

Even Jian Wushuang felt a bit overwhelmed at the moment.

“What’s going on with Temple Master Iceberg?”?He frowned secretly.

Temple Master Iceberg stood up for Emperor Golden Snake and had indeed provoked Jian Wushuang this time, but Jian Wushuang knew himself very well. Although he had the battle strength of a superior emperor, it was very likely that his strength was nothing in the eyes Temple Master Iceberg, so he didn’t need to make amends at all.

However, Temple Master Iceberg did apologize. Additionally, he didn’t put on airs and even apologized to him in the presence of all the other Temple Masters.

Although Jian Wushuang didn’t understand and didn’t want to let it go that simply, he didn’t want to fall out with Temple Master Iceberg on the surface. “Temple Master Iceberg, it doesn’t matter. It was mainly Emperor Golden Snake’s fault and you had little to do with it. I don’t blame you.”

“Thank you, Sword Emperor.” Temple Master Iceberg had a kind expression on his face.

“Temple Masters, if there’s nothing else, then I’ll take my leave.” After that, Jian Wushuang saluted towards the Temple Masters and turned to walk away.

He had barely managed to exit when Temple Master Iceberg proceeded to follow him out as well.

This left Temple Master Pure Moon and the others even more confused.

“Is there something wrong with Temple Master Iceberg today?”

“Tsk, Temple Master Iceberg, who is known for being extremely overbearing, actually apologized to a Divine Emperor of his own accord. This is not his usual style.”

“I feel there must be something fishy going on here.”

All these Temple Masters talked and laughed casually. They were not fools, so they all understood that Temple Master Iceberg must have acted that way because he had some hidden intentions.

But they didn’t know what these hidden intentions were exactly.

Temple Master Iceberg kept up with Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor.” Temple Master Iceberg came to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stopped and asked in amazement. “What can I do for you, Temple Master Iceberg?”

“I do need your help with a small matter.” Temple Master Iceberg was all smiles and gently said, “Well, let’s talk as we walk.”

Jian Wushuang was vigilant in the heart, but he continued to walk with Temple Master Iceberg.

After all, this was the Holy Palace. Temple Master Iceberg was a Temple Master and was a powerful force in the Monster-exterminating League, so he wouldn’t attack Jian Wushuang overtly here.

“I’d like to figure out exactly what this Temple Master Iceberg is up to.”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.
