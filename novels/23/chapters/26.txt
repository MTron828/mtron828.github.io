Chapter 27: Summit Battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Meng’er, get the f*ck up here!”

A chilly shrill cry echoed, resounding through the Drill Ground for a long time.

A beautiful girl in a long, snow-white robe raised her head, promptly leaping onto the stage with one step.

Standing on the stage, less than ten meters away from each other, two figures were on a warpath. There was an intense feeling of confrontation that you do not sense any other time.

The Long Sword on Jian Wushuang’s back was removed from the sheath and a vibration of sword essence like the rolling tide radiated from it. As the cold Sword Edge directly pointed at Jian Meng’er, without the slightest trace of emotion, Jian Wushuang coldly said, “As I said two months ago, I have come to find you today! The fight between us is inevitable. It had to come to an end.”

Jian Meng’er’s face was stone cold as she stood there with her snow-white robe blowing. The power of her peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm was completely released.

“Jian Wushuang, I don’t know how you increased your strength in just two months. Anyway, I still believe that the winner takes all. Since you are so desperate to fight with me, then bring it on!”

The brief talk led the atmosphere to an elevated level immediately.

“Oh, I see.”

There was an uproar of excitement and expectation rising in the area around the Drill Ground. It seemed that the disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion were on the brink of madness, waiting to witness how things would unfold.

This would be an eye-catching duel! What an exciting turn of events!

“It was universally acknowledged that a 16-year-old teenager, considered to be a super genius, top of the list, had reached the peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. The other one who was buried in oblivion, amazed people with their Spiritual Power, on par with the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, which was acquired within two months. The battle between them…” Even those famous experts among the audience were looking forward to watching the fight between them.

It was the Summit Battle between two talents!

In fact, the people who lived in Sword Marquis Mansion thought Jian Wushuang’s challenge to Jian Meng’er was a joke and brought disgrace on his own head. Now, after two rounds of battle, no one dared to say it was wishful thinking.

According to the Sword Principle, someone who cultivated the Wave Superposition Sword Art to the Eleventh Move was definitely a genius.

According to the Cultivation of Spiritual Power, he lit up the ninth level of the Spiritual Power Gem, also equivalent to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. So they were neck and neck in this battle.

He had the qualification to challenge Jian Meng’er. In addition, it was hard to say who would be the victor.

“Ladies and gentlemen, you see these two. Who’s better than the other?” Bai Chong asked with a smile.

“It is hard to say.” Situ Qingyue spoke first. In Cultivation of Spiritual Power, Jian Meng’er had reached the peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, which was slightly better than Jian Wushuang. In regards to swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang gained the upper hand. They were well-matched, making it hard to judge their true strength.

“I agree.” Ye Xiu nodded his head, “Although Cultivation of Spiritual Power is a fundamental step in the process of practicing martial arts, the strength of Martial Arts Technique is an important factor that could also determine the outcome, considering the small disparity in their Cultivation. By virtue of their swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang and Jian Meng’er could totally brawl with each other, and the outcome will be unpredictable.

“Shui Hanxin, what do you think?” Bai Chong suddenly looked at her, beside him.

“I bet Meng’er will win.” Shui Hanxin said following.

“Oh, you are confident you are in your disciple?” Bai Chong said with the corner of his lip raised.

“Bai Chong, did you just notice?” Shui Hanxin glanced at Bai Chong, laughing as she said, “That little guy called Jian Wushuang, although he lit up the Spiritual Power Gem during the detection of Spiritual Power, I could see that he barely reached it. So I am sure that he hasn’t reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. I think his Cultivation is between the peak of the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm and the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm.”

“Indeed.” Bai Chong just noticed this, nodding.

“Moreover, we all know that this little guy had not gathered spiritual power two months ago. Now, two months have passed, his spiritual cultivation has unexpectedly increased so much, so I think there are bound to be many external factors.” Shui Hanxin said plainly.

“For example, regardless of the consequences, he swallowed pills or treasures to enhance his Cultivation by force. But the enhancement would lead him to collapse radically. Not only is his chance of becoming an expert in the future very slim, he also won’t be able to utilize 100% of his strength. His performance will be at a mere 20% or 30% at best.

People in the spectators stand frowned upon hearing these words.

Indeed, they also thought of this possibility. After all, it was inconceivable that his Cultivation of Spiritual Power increased so quickly. It made no sense to say that he did not use some pills or Natural Treasures.

However, they did not know that Jian Wushuang was a Deviant Cultivator. Therefore, his training could not be judged by common sense.

“Of course, apart from these two things, the most important part is that I have absolute confidence in my disciple. I know my disciple better than anyone else. It is impossible to find a talent of the same age who can beat my disciple in Sword Marquis Mansion, “Shui Hanxin said nonchalantly with a look of absolute confidence.

“It is really subjective, but I rather think the little guy called Jian Wushuang could win.” Bai Chong said and laughed.

“Since Mr. Bai Chong thinks so, let’s wait and see.” Shui Xinhan said with an indifferent smile.

“Look, these two little guys are fighting with each other.” Ye Xiu said abruptly from the spectators stand. Everyone instantaneously turned their eyes to the stage.

Jian Meng’er was the first to attack.

As a trace of Killing Intent burst out from Triple-kill Sword as Jian Meng’er took a huge step and swung the Long Sword with an irresistible force.

“Sword Tide!”

When the Long Sword suddenly slashed out, it was like the rolling tide sweeping over the area. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sword Tide was the most terrifying move of the Ceaseless Waterflow Sword Art, and its sweeping wave was the essence of this trick. Under normal circumstances, this move, if mastered to the Profound level, could produce six layers. But at this moment, Jian Meng’er’s wave swept out with eight layers.

“It’s ridiculous.”

Jian Wushuang chuckled and caught the waves with his sword, a very common sword, dissolving the eight layers of sword essence without any effort when he touched them by taking advantage of their force. Then he made a huge stride toward his opponent.

Whoosh!

A tide like Sword light was released, creating waves in the area.

Jian Wushuang also performed the move “Sword Tide.” But when the Sword art was performed, the rolling waves of sword essence burst out with12 layers in an instant.
