Chapter 2954: The True Sage Has Arrived

——

“It will take another month to ripen?” The Starry Sea Saint was immediately overjoyed. “Haha, since the boss of the three Shadow Saints said it before he died, it’s most likely not a lie. Moreover, since he said that the Earth God Fruit will take another month to ripen, then it can’t be a lie. In other words, this news is 100% true!”

“Yes!”

“Yes, I made the same judgment. That’s why I immediately came to report to you, Saint Lord,” the graceful woman said, “In addition, I have also investigated everything clearly. There were two people who killed the three Shadow Saints, and they were all from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. One of them was Xue Dong King, who had just broken through to the Saint-level not long ago. The reason why they acted was that they accepted a three-star mission from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and that three-star mission was to kill the three Shadow Saints.”

“Then where are these two now? Are they still staying in the Dark Shout Realm?” The Star Sea Saint said.

“Yes, as expected, these two have also discovered the existence of the Earth God Fruit, so they have been waiting there. They want to wait for the Earth God Fruit to ripen and pluck it before leaving,” said the graceful woman.

“Haha, these two have a good plan, but unfortunately, since I know about this matter, the Earth God Fruit is mine. No one can take it away.” The Star Sea Saint’s eyes shone with a strong light.

“You did a good job. I’ll go to the Dark Shout Realm first and reward you after I get the Earth God Fruit,” Star Sea Saint said.

“Thank you, Saint Lord!” The graceful woman was overjoyed.

The Star Sea Saint did not stay for long and went straight to the Dark Shout Realm as fast as he could.

…

In the temple of the swamp in the Dark Shout Realm.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King were drinking and chatting casually. They were waiting for the earthy yellow fruit to ripen.

And now, the fruit was very close to ripen.

But at this moment…

Buzz!

An extremely powerful aura, which was obviously above that of an ordinary Immortal Saint, came pressing down.

The aura was vast and majestic, covering the entire swamp.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King, who were in the hall, were immediately alarmed by this aura.

“This aura, it’s a True Saint!” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Damn it, a True Saint expert actually came,” Xue Dong King cursed.

Without any hesitation, they immediately rose up and appeared in the void above.

When they arrived in the void, they saw the cold and arrogant middle-aged man with bare feet.

The cold and arrogant middle-aged man with bare feet sized up Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King with his profound eyes.

“He is indeed the Star Sea Saint.” Xue Dong King’s body trembled as he whispered, “It is said that the Star Sea Saint is an expert who has comprehended the rules of the Earth. He must have learned of the existence of the Earth Yellow Fruit and rushed here.”

“I think so.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “But he is the only one who has arrived. I wonder if there will be other experts of the True Saint realm.”

“No, he is the only True Saint in this territory. The other True Saints are far away in other realms. It will take a while to get the news. It will take a longer time to get here from their territory. But the Star Sea Saint alone is not to be trifled with.” Xue Dong King sighed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

True Saints and False Saints, although they were both Immortal Saints, and there was only a one-word difference, the difference between them was abnormally huge.

Although Xue Dong King was a Peak False Saint, and was very close to a True Saint, no matter how close he was, as long as he grasped the immortal body and did not truly possess True Saint battle strength, he was already on two completely different levels.

The Xue Dong King was not afraid of any of the Immortal Saints around this realm when facing the three Shadow Saints.

However, he was indeed a little afraid when facing the Star Sea Saint.

“Xue Dong King greets the Star Sea Saint Lord.” Xue Dong King bowed slightly.

“You are Xue Dong King?” The Starry Sea Saint spoke. His voice was cold and emotionless, “I already know that you killed the three Shadow Saints, and I also know that the third Shadow Saint Realm has been hiding the Earth God Fruit. This Earth God fruit is very useful for comprehending the rules of the earth and is also very useful to me. That’s why I came here.”

“Earth God Fruit?” Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King were surprised.

They did not know the Earth God Fruit before, but now they knew from the Star Sea Saint that it was called the Earth God Fruit.

With the name of the earth, one could imagine how helpful the Earth God Fruit was to the rules of the earth.

“Star Sea Saint Master, there is indeed an Earth God Fruit in the Dark Shout Realm, which is at the bottom of the palace below,” Xue Dong King admitted directly.

There was nothing he could do. As soon as Sea Star Saint arrived, he immediately released his soul power and saw everything around him. Naturally, he also saw the existence of the Earth God Fruit.

It was useless for him to deny it.

“But the Earth God fruit was discovered by the two of us first, after all,” Xue Dong King said with a frown.

“No, the Earth God Fruit was discovered by the three Shadow Saints first. And if nothing goes wrong, they should have been waiting in the Dark Shout Realm for a long time. Unfortunately, the Earth God Fruit was about to mature, but the three of them died at the hands of the two of you. The two of you also took advantage of the Earth God Fruit, but fortunately, the Earth God Fruit is still some time away from maturity.” Sea Star Saint smiled coldly.

“How about this? Since all of you have been waiting for this Earth God Fruit for a few days, I promise to give each of you one million sacred elixirs. How about it?”

“One million sacred elixirs?” Xue Dong King’s heart skipped a beat as he frowned slightly.

One million sacred elixirs was indeed not a low price.

One had to know that many Immortal Saints with average strength only had around 500,000 to 600,000 sacred elixirs. Only the wealthier ones were able to take out more than a million sacred elixirs.

After all, Xue Dong King had just broken through to the Immortal Saint realm and possessed the battle strength of a Peak False Saint. He did not have much time to accumulate wealth. Therefore, 1,000,000 saint elixirs was not a small amount to him.

Although 1,000,000 saint elixirs was not a small amount, it was still insignificant compared to the true value of the Earth God Fruit.

Although Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King did not know how much the Earth God Fruit was worth, according to their estimates, it was at least 30,000,000 saint elixirs.

It was too much to expect Star Sea Saint to take two million saint elixirs for such a precious thing.

“Star Sea Saint Lord, right? I don’t lack one million saint elixirs. Compared to one million saint elixirs, I’m more likely to get the Earth God Fruit, so…” Jian Wushuang did not finish his words.

“Shut up!” Star Sea Saint was stunned. “I’m talking to Xue Dong King. Since when did you, a Divine Master, dare to interrupt me?”

As soon as he finished his sentence, Star Sea Saint rolled up his sleeves. Immediately, endless rules of the earth gathered in front of him, forming a huge earthy yellow hand that directly fanned toward Jian Wushuang.
