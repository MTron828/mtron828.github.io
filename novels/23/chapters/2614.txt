Chapter 2615: Finally Got It

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master took out the Stately Painting—an old picture scroll that was originally yellowish with faded prints and instantly shot a ray dazzling light. There was no need for the black-robed man to do anything as the picture scroll instantly turned into a light stream and flew toward the black-robed man.

The Stately Painting zoomed toward the black-robed man before excitedly going round and round the black-robed man. It looked like a child who had just been reunited with its parents after being separated for two or three days.

The many experts present on and around the battlefield were no longer doubtful.

The Stately Painting belonged to the mysterious black-robed man for sure. Otherwise, it would not have zoomed toward the black-robed man and excitedly went around him.

The black-robed man gently beckoned the Stately Painting as it turned into a ray of light before fusing into his divine body and disappeared.

The black-robed man raised his head slightly and glanced around the battlefield after that.

“I’m only here to retrieve my lost treasure. You may carry on. I won’t be participating.”

He spoke in his low and slightly hoarse voice before turning around in front of countless experts and slowly strode toward the distant void.

The black-robed man slowly walked off one step at a time and was moving around very casually, but even so, the countless experts in the void remained in kneeling position with none dared to breathe out loud.

In the void.

The Star Picking Pavilion Purple-robed Supervisor reminded, “He’s leaving Senior Meng.”

“Mmm.” Senior Meng nodded slightly and thought of catching up with the black-robed expert to befriend him.

However, he quickly dismissed that thought.

Firstly, Senior Meng reckoned the mysterious black-robed expert was extremely strong. The expert was much stronger than Senior Meng’s original assumptions as such a super expert could easily destroy the entire Star Picking Pavilion with just a flip of his hand. Although Senior Meng was an Undying Saint himself, he knew he was merely a firefly when compared to the mysterious black-robed expert who was bright like the moon.

Senior Meng had some self-awareness. If he knew that the other party was an Undying Saint, Senior Meng would not mind going forth to make friends with him even if he was somewhat an invincible Undying Saint like the Sword Lord Tong Xin. However, he could not simply make a move toward someone above the Undying Saint realm.

In other words, he was not qualified to be associated with such powerful beings as an Undying Saint.

Secondly, even if Senior Meng wanted to force himself on the other party without minding his identity and be acquainted with him, he had to be able to move his body first.

Although the black-robed expert was slowly leaving the void, the supreme life rating pressure on Senior Meng did not get any lesser. Senior Meng was standing still under the pressure, he did not kneel like the others around him.

He was trembling and stood in place just like the others.

What could he do when he was unable to even move?

After a while, the mysterious black-robed expert finally disappeared from everyone’s sight.

The life-rating pressure that flooded heaven and earth finally dissipated.

Once the pressure disappeared, the many experts present felt a sense of relief. All of them let out a long sigh and slowly stood up.

However, their limbs were still trembling despite being able to move freely and stand up again. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

That was scary!

The Earth Ultimate Gods, Heaven Ultimate Gods, and those five Grand Ultimate Gods present had never encountered such a terrifying expert in their cultivation journey thus far. They had never experienced such great fears just from the pressures exerted by the other party.

It was their first time!

“Who’s that person just now?”

“I don’t know, but he’s a bewildering super expert. He’s probably a top-tier super expert in the Infinite Territory or maybe even in the legendary Third Heaven.”

“He’s too terrifying, I felt my soul about to completely shatter just moments ago!”

“I’ve lived for a few hundred thousand years and that’s the first time I’m so horrified.”

All the experts started a discussion.

In the middle of the battlefield, the experts from Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dong Fang Clan looked miserable.

However, soon their expressions eased and had gradually recovered.

“The Master is a powerful expert that came only for his treasure. He left after retrieving his treasure and was not interested in the Huangji Golden Pill at all. The Huangji Golden Pill is still with Nanwu Palace,” said the elder from Life and Death Tower coldly whose voice echoed on the battlefield.

The two Grand Ultimate Gods from Divine Demon Sect and Dong Fang Clan peeked over.

The experts from those three powerful sects exchanged looks before...

“Kill!!”

The war broke out again.

Although the appearance of the mysterious black-robed expert gave them a shock, he left after retrieving the Stately Painting. The Huangji Golden Pill was not taken away so the battle over the pill was unaffected.

The three top sects joined forces and once again fought madly against the people from Nanwu palace. The battlefield became fiery hot again.

“Let’s go.”

Senior Meng turned around and headed toward the Star Picking Pavilion.

“Senior Meng, this battle...” The Purple-robed Supervisor was surprised.

“I’m here only to see the Stately Painting’s owner. There’s no need for me to be around since I’ve seen him. You may stay and watch the battle for the Huangji Golden Pill if you like.” Senior Meng smiled and left.

...

There was a dense forest quite far away in a void from the battlefield.

The man who wore a black ferocious-looking mask on his face and assumed by many to be a super expert superior to an Undying Saint appeared in the void and went straight into the dense forest.

The mysterious black-robed expert stayed low for a long time deep in the dense forest. After he made sure there was no one following him, he took off the mask and revealed an extremely young face.

He was none other than Jian Wushuang!

“I’ve taken a huge risk and won the bet! I was right!”

Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly. He was trembling slightly from excitement as his eyes gleamed with a look of surprise.

The old and yellowish picture scroll appeared in his hands with just a thought.

“Stately Painting old mate, I’ve finally found you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Although he was smiling happily, his back was soaking wet with sweat.
