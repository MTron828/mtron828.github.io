Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation¬†¬† Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

‚ÄúKid, this time we‚Äôre heading to the Shangqing Palace. It‚Äôs well-documented in this book. This ancient sect is famous in all four major mysteries. Since its establishment, it has produced two tier 6 Emperors. Among them, Daoist Shangqing is a peak-level tier 6 existence, the current sect master, and a formidable figure despite not surpassing the sect‚Äôs founder in strength.

However, there‚Äôs still a lot of potential for growth in the Northern Region.‚Äù

Listening to the old man with goat horns, Jian Wushuang flipped open the book to read about the Shangqing Palace.

Daoist Shangqing, starting from obscurity, founded the Shangqing Palace, and practiced the sword throughout. He‚Äôs the supreme in Sword Dao!

Later, he descended to the God‚Äôs Tomb, sentenced to a hundred epochs in the Third Prison, and upon release, after preaching in the Human Realm‚Äôs secret realm for billions of years, returned to the Shangqing Palace and has not left since.

Venerable Yu Ching!

The current sect master, a Sword Dao Venerable, is the sixth generation leader of the Shangqing Palace, rising to prominence 100,000 epochs ago.

The records about the Shangqing Palace‚Äôs deeds were less than half a page. But the common thread of sword practice piqued his interest.

According to the records, the Shangqing Palace would open its doors every epoch, inviting Grand Yan Immortals from the Northern Region and even the entire heavenly realm to witness the Sword Tide.

Each Sword Tide would attract many strong individuals, and even some tier 5 Emperors would attend.

This time, Jian Wushuang was lucky enough to encounter the Sword Tide of this epoch. He wanted to see how formidable it could be.

On his path of the Ultimate Dao, he had been pursuing Sword Dao, and there were very few who were stronger than him in the Great Si Region. On the Original Planet, he hadn‚Äôt encountered a formidable sword practitioner.

This time, he could finally observe the strength of ancient Sword Dao.

Buzz!

The ancient ship accelerated with full force, taking only a quarter of an hour to reach the Shangqing Palace.

The teleportation array established in the Sharuo City was also due to the influence of the Shangqing Palace.

During the journey, Jian Wushuang and his companions encountered many fellow travelers, all heading to the Shangqing Palace.

Niost were tier 3 Emperors leading a group of juniors. Encounters with tier 4 Emperors were rare, and there were no encounters with tier 5 Emperors.

The speed of the ancient ship left everyone in the dust. After all, it was an

Eternal Treasure, and even though they were in one of the Four Major Secret

Realms, Eternal Treasures were still rare here. Below the level of tier 5

Emperors, there were very few people who possessed an Eternal Treasure.

Others, upon seeing the ancient ship ridden by Jian Wushuang, cleared the way. Anyone able to ride an Eternal Treasure was undoubtedly a significant figure.

In the renowned Northern Region, a figure known throughout the entire expanse made his presence felt.

Swoosh!

The scenery before Jian Wushuang underwent a sudden transformation. He rose slowly and walked to the forefront of the ancient boat, standing shoulder to shoulder with the puppet fisherman.

The silhouette of Shangqing Palace was becoming discernible. A majestic mountain range stretched for billions of miles, its end indiscernible. On the main peak, a colossal waterfall was clearly visible even from a distance.

Approaching closer, the features of Shangqing Palace became clearer.

Hum!

The ancient boat suddenly came to a halt, and a barrier appeared ahead.

Outside the barrier, numerous figures were suspended, disciples and elders of Shangqing Palace receiving powerful individuals from other sects.

Seeing the ancient boat, a senior elder of Shangqing Palace‚Äôs complexion changed. Immediately, he transmitted a message.

Before long, a middle-aged man in a pale yellow robe was teleported through the barrier.

‚ÄòQuick, it‚Äôs the Elder Jiu Jian of Shangqing Palace!‚Äù Following the sound, many people looked over.

Jiu Jian of Shangqing, one of the nine great elders.

Each of them was a tier 5 Emperor, the formidable individuals of the Shangqing Palace, not solely relying on tier 6 Emperors. The most renowned figures in the Shangqing Palace were the Nine Swords among the Emperors and the Thirteen Tai‚Äôa Swords among the Dao Lords.

All of them were practically invincible among their peers.

Especially the Thirteen Tai‚Äôa Swords among the Dao Lords, each comparable to Emperor-level powerhouses, and practicing the origin source of swordsmanship. Their combat strength was extremely formidable, with few rivals among their peers.

The reason why so many Dao Lords were attracted was to challenge the sword prodigies of the Thirteen Tai!a Swords during the Sword Observation Event.

The figure of the Ninth Sword Elder flickered, arriving in front of the ancient boat, bowing respectfully and saying, ‚ÄúIs it Senior Yang who has graced us with his presence?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! You recognize me?‚Äù

The old man with goat-like horns was somewhat surprised. Although he had heard of Shangqing Palace, he didn‚Äôt recognize them!

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Senior Lie Huo who sent a message to our Palace Master. I‚Äôve come to welcome you!‚Äù said the Elder Jiu Jian with utmost respect.

Elder Jiu Jian showed utmost respect.

After all, the person in front of them had a significant connection with Senior Lie Huo.

In all of Liuzhou, it was hard to assess who the strongest individual was, but Venerable Lie Huo definitely ranked in the top two. The other was Shangqing Patriarch.

As someone comparable to the Patriarch, they couldn‚Äôt afford to be negligent. Even though it was just a message, they still treated the situation with the highest level of formality.

Leading Jian Wushuang, the old man with goat-like horns disembarked from the ancient boat and nodded approvingly.

This was quite different from Senior Lie Huffs temperament; the old Lie Huo wasn‚Äôt so meticulous before. It seemed that many people had changed over the years.

Blaming it all on the White Tiger Temple, Yang Sanmu couldn‚Äôt help but feel that the White Tiger Temple was responsible for these changes.

In terms of actual strength, the White Tiger Temple didn‚Äôt even have many tier 6 Emperors, and those they had were all puppets. It was just the prestige of the Qishen Temple that attracted so many strong individuals.

‚ÄúElder, this way,‚Äù said Elder Jiu Jian, leading the two through the barrier.

The scene before them became more vivid, and the mountain range seemed like the world Jian Wushuang had dreamt of.

The air was filled with the songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers, resembling a fairyland.

This was entirely different from what was recorded in the books. According to the writings, the Northern Region was mostly barbaric, but now it seemed quite the opposite!

If this was considered barren, what about the Original Universe outside?

On the journey alone, Jian Wushuang encountered many realms that were better than Yuanyang Lake. The only difference was that the cultivation conditions were not as good as those in Yuanyang Lake.

‚ÄúSenior Yang, Daoist Wushuang, ahead is the Tidal Pavilion. The seats are already arranged, please take your places!‚Äù Elder Jiu Jian said.

Jian Wushuang looked ahead. The entire Tidal Pavilion was vast, and many people had already taken their seats.

‚ÄúThank you very much!‚Äù Yang Sanmu, carrying his status, was not as proud as Jian Wushuang. He quickly expressed his gratitude.

The seats were in the front row, right next to the position of the Shangqing Palace‚Äôs Master.

Sitting beside him were all tier 5 Emperors. The Dao Lords didn‚Äôt even have the qualification to sit in the front row. Even the young masters were in the second row.

Jian Wushuangs seat was next to Yang Sanmu, the only Grand Yan Immortal in the front row.

After taking their seats, many people looked over.

‚ÄúWho is this person?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe actually received personal reception from Elder Jiu Jian. A Dao Lord is actually sitting in the front row.‚Äù

Many tier 4 Emperor Immortals were in the second row, and those in the front row were either tier 5 Emperor Immortals or some prestigious ones.

The weakest were the tier 4 Emperor Immortals, and now they were sitting side by side with a Dao Lord.

Moreover, the seat where the Dao Lord was sitting was so close to the master of the Shangqing Palace.

For a while, it caused quite a stir.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

Although there were doubts, no one dared to confront them directly. After all, it was arranged by the Shangqing Palace, and they were just guests..
