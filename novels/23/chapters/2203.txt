Chapter 2204 The Secret to Inverse Cultivation

“It’s true!” Jian Wushuang was right.That mysterious man was his master, Xuan Yi.

He had never thought that the inverse cultivating skill Emperor Bai had had been given to him by Xuan Yi.

“There were no inverse cultivators back in the ancient past. Emperor Bai is the first ever inverse cultivator in this world. That technique was given by my master. If that is the case, my master is the one who created the inverse cultivating skill?” Jian Wushuang was in disbelief.

Inverse cultivation!

It was a brand new and unbelievable cultivating technique.

Jian Wushuang was where he was due to this technique.

As he got stronger, he slowly understood how powerful and terrifying this technique was.

He had always wondered who had created such a powerful and magical cultivating technique.

He knew that no matter who it was, it had to be someone incredible.

Now, all the clues pointed to his master, Xuan Yi...

“I have no idea whether this inverse cultivating technique was indeed created by your master. It might have been created by someone else and given to us through him. It does not matter. Your master is one of the most mysterious men I have ever met since the first era,” Emperor Bai continued.

“People like Emperor Thirteen are incredibly powerful. He can partially ignore the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth with his own power to reach the Half-step Divine Demon Realm. However, he is far less mysterious than your master, Xuan Yi.”

“Back in the first era, when I reached the seventh step of inverse cultivation, your master came to look for me. I asked him if he gave me the inverse cultivation technique, or if he wanted me to do anything for him....”

“It was a pity that he did not give me a clear answer. He said that I did not meet his requirements and he did not have any special requests. All he asked of me was to pass any future inverse cultivators the technique for the seventh step if I ever were to meet one.”

“That’s all?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Emperor Bai was the first inverse cultivator to reach the seventh step.

However, he never knew what Xuan Yi had wanted to do, or what he was really after.

What were the requirements Xuan Yi was talking about?

“After that, I have not seen your master at all. The first era collapsed and the second era started to prosper. Inverse cultivation started to gain popularity within the Eternal Chaotic World. However, only the first five steps were available to the general masses. Hence, these inverse cultivators could only reach the realm of universe god.”

“Furthermore, there is the terrifying Inverse Cultivation Test which every inverse cultivator had to go through. Many of them died, and the only one who passed was Wu Bei.”

“Even though he passed the Inverse Cultivation Test and got the cultivation technique for the sixth step, he reached the peak of real god. That was where he was stuck,” Emperor Bai said coldly.

Jian Wushuang nodded his head to show he understood what Emperor Bai had just said.

Emperor Bai had just said that Xuan Yi had told him to pass the seventh step of inverse cultivation to anyone who had great talent.

Real God Wu Bei... Jian Wushuang knew him.

He had passed the Inverse Cultivation Test and managed to enter the sixth step. However, he was not very talented.

Emperor Bai would not pass the seventh step to such an ordinary cultivator.

The next inverse cultivator who had managed to rise up was Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had passed the Inverse Cultivator Test and proven himself to be one of the most talented cultivators in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Here, Emperor Bai was not stingy and gave him the technique for the seventh step inverse cultivation.

Jian Wushuang recalled the first time he had met Emperor Bai.

Emperor Bai had been very intimate and peaceful. He did not act all high and mighty.

Back then, Jian Wushuang had suspected this was because of Emperor Thirteen. Now he thought about it, it might have been because of Emperor Thirteen, but he was not the main reason.

The real reason was because both of them were inverse cultivators.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed to himself. Many of the doubts he had had were answered.

However, he still had two burning questions.

The first: whether inverse cultivation was created by his master Xuan Yi and what was his purpose of doing so if he did so.

The second: Xuan Yi’s true identity. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang knew from past experience that Xuan Yi came from the Ancient Past and had been a very influential and powerful man back then. He might be the reason why Seven Star Black Sect was in danger and the reason why many experts from the ancient past had fallen into deep slumber.

What kind of identity and power did he have to create all this?

Furthermore, Emperor Thirteen was from the Seven Star Black Sect and was the leader of the Seven Stars. If Xuan Yi was the reason why the Seven Star Black Sect had been annihilated, why was Emperor Thirteen helping him?

“To be honest, I envy you, Jian Wushuang,” Emperor Bai said.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor Bai, astonished.

“Mr Xuan Yi only passed me the inverse cultivating technique. He does not interact with me much... He took you in as a Lineal Disciple and gave you numerous treasures. He treats you no differently to the way you treat him,” Emperor Bai muttered, envious.

Emperor Bai thought that Jian Wushuang was someone who met the requirements and was the one who Xuan Yi really needed.

On the other hand, he did not meet the requirements, and hence did not qualify for such treasures.

Jian Wushuang smiled. He had to admit that Xuan Yi really did treat him very well, just how a master should.

“Emperor Bai, thank you for all this info,” Jian Wushuang thanked him gratefully.

After Emperor Bai said all those things, many of the doubts that Jian Wushuang had had disappeared. Now, he knew more about his master.

“Haha. You’re welcome. I am looking forward to seeing what Xuan Yi has in mind. Oh yes, this transmission token is for you,” Emperor Bai laughed.

Emperor Bai whipped out a token.

“This is...?” Jian Wushuang looked at the transmission token, confused.

“Emperor Thirteen asked me to pass this to you. He wants you to message him once you awaken,” Emperor Bai said.

“Is that the case?” Jian Wushuang said as he fell into deep thought.
