Chapter 3074: The Emperor’s Life Avatar

——

“The three Palace Masters are all trying to make friends with him?” Iceberg was stunned, but he immediately shook his head. “This is impossible!”

“The three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces are all standing at the top of the Principles Masters. Not only are they extremely powerful, but they also have a lot of power in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Even when facing the three Saint Realm Masters of the Third Heaven, these three Palace Masters are only slightly inferior. With such existences, who else in this world can make the three Palace Masters take the initiative to make friends with them?”

“Moreover, we have already confirmed the background of this Heavenly Sword Marquis. He has just arrived at the first sky from the endless territories. What kind of background does such a person have?”

“You are right, I think so too.” Bai Jue nodded slightly. “Since the second possibility is not realistic, then there is only the first possibility. It is that this Heavenly Sword Marquis is a peerless super genius. He is even more monstrous and dazzling than the geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces and Primal Chaos Palace. It is just that this Heavenly Sword Marquis’ talent has not been truly revealed in front of us. We just do not know.”

“When he fought with me previously, did he always hold back?” Iceberg frowned.

“Definitely. Also, he definitely hid more than just a tiny bit. What we saw is most likely just the tip of the iceberg he revealed.” Bai Jue smiled faintly, “It’s because of this that I said that I would stay with you in the Young Divine Sect for a period of time. Also, I also told him that if he encounters any problems in his cultivation or Sword Dao, he can come and look for us at any time.”

“If this Heavenly Sword Marquis is truly a genius, then he will definitely seize every opportunity in his cultivation. Now that I, the true Principles Master, and you, an Invincible Immortal Saint who specializes in Sword Dao, are here, he will definitely not miss this opportunity. He will definitely come and look for us. and during the process of seeking guidance, we will naturally be able to see his actual strength.”

“Is that so?” Iceberg understood.

“Iceberg, you have to work hard during this period. If the little guy comes to you, you must do your best to guide him,” Bai Jue instructed.

“Yes.” Iceberg nodded solemnly.

…

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.

In a secret room in Jian Wushuang’s residence.

“Success!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with surprise as he looked at the figure standing calmly in front of him.

This figure was the body of the rule master that he had brought out from the mystic realm. However, after being specifically refined, this Principles Master looked exactly like him, moreover, his body was exuding an extremely strange aura.

Jian Wushuang sat upright and could clearly sense the current situation of the figure in front of him.

“Emperor’s life avatar, this is my first emperor’s life avatar.” Jian Wushuang was very happy.

Although the Emperor’s life avatar did not improve his strength and could not fight for him in a fight, it was used to protect his life.

The divine power contained in the body of the Emperor’s life avatar was on the same level as Jian Wushuang’s own divine power, and it was equally vast.

One must know that Jian Wushuang’s divine power was extremely vast, and it could be said to be a divine power sea. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Other rank one True Saints would need a lot of divine power to regenerate their divine bodies if their divine bodies collapsed. Under normal circumstances, a rank one True Saint’s divine power could only regenerate his divine body three or four times at most, however, Jian Wushuang’s divine power was vast and boundless, and it could regenerate his divine body again and again.

Jian Wushuang conservatively estimated that the divine power in his body could allow him to recombine his divine body at least a hundred times!

Such vast divine power was already ridiculous, but now Jian Wushuang had an Emperor’s Life Avatar, which could bear all of his divine power. This meant that his divine power had doubled again!

He could only replenish his divine body hundreds of times, but now he could regenerate it 200 times?

What kind of concept was this?

For example, if an ordinary rank one True Saint was corroded by the Cthulhu’s venom, he would die without even using half a drop.

However, if the Cthulhu’s venom was corroded into Jian Wushuang’s body, it would take at least 100 drops of Cthulhu’s venom to completely corrode his divine power, and that was only if Jian Wushuang was an ordinary first rank True Saint.

In fact, Jian Wushuang’s divine power was extremely pure. In terms of pure purity, it was higher than many third rank True Saints or even peak third rank True Saints. Most importantly, he was a perfect chaotic creature unique to the Divine Beginning World, he was born with an indestructible and poison-proof physique!

The Cthulhu venom and the Devil Star Venom were absolutely the nemesis of the Immortal Saint.

But these venoms had no effect on Jian Wushuang!

His physique was completely immune to these venoms.

With the venom immune and Jian Wushuang’s abundant divine power, it was too difficult to kill him.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang moved his mind, and the Emperor’s Life Avatar in front of him immediately began to shrink. Like an ordinary treasure, it directly merged into his body.

“The Emperor’s Life Avatar has been created, and now…”

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out the second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual.

The second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual contained the complete anatomy of the third stage of the Space-time Principles, which was very helpful to Jian Wushuang.

“In 80 years, I will go to the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. According to Elder Mo Shan, the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is a great opportunity, or even a land of fortune. It’s a rare opportunity, and I can’t miss it. Before I enter, I have to find a way to make my strength stronger and reach my current limit!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He wanted to improve himself as soon as possible. When he reached the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, he did not need to spend time on these areas where he could meditate or improve.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang immediately closed his eyes and began to meditate.

Of course, he would not blindly meditate. After all, there was a Principles Master in the Divine Firmament Sect and an Immortal Saint who had reached the invincible level in sword principle, with such two experts in front of him, it was impossible for Jian Wushuang not to seize the opportunity.

Therefore, if he encountered any problems in cultivation or meditation, he would solve them himself. If he could not solve them, he would go to Bai Jue and Iceberg for guidance, with their guidance, he would improve faster!
