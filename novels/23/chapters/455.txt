Chapter 456: Jian Wushuang Displays His Moves Again

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Jian Wushuang had remained at one side of the battlefield and not gotten involved all this time while the countless lords and experts from the two large camps were maniacally tearing at each other’s throats.

The battling lords had noticed his presence as well, but nobody bothered about him after seeing that he was only a Saint Realm expert. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s certainly rare to see so many lords battling against each other and displaying all sorts of skills.” Jian Wushuang laughed mildly.

Some of the skills being used by these lords were extremely odd and unorthodox, causing Jian Wushuang to be astounded.

This was especially so for the recently-arrived Myriad Islands Lord. As soon as he came, he casually waved his hand to set up two Formations which immediately turned the situation on the battlefield around. This skill was truly impressive.

It was apparent at present that Drifting-blood Marquis’ camp had fallen into an absolute disadvantage on the battlefield. In the centermost of the battlefield, particularly, Loftiness Lord had gradually become unable to cope with the frenzied offensive of Demon Soul Lord. If he was killed, the Dao Weapon would fall into the hands of Pale Moon Marquis’ camp at once.

“For good or bad, I’m a member of Drifting-blood Marquis’ camp. It’s not my style to watch on from the sidelines.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself, laughing. When he saw a figure on the battlefield, a faint and strange smile emerged at the corner of his mouth, following which his figure drifted forth toward the battlefield as well.

On the battlefield.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

A pitch-black spear shadow pierced forth like a flood dragon bursting out of the sea.

The gray-robed weathered elder, Blackhill Lord’s, expression was frosty as his eyes fixed upon his opponent, a novice lord from Drifting-blood Marquis’ camp.

“There are too many lords and too many people who are stronger than me on the battlefield. I have to be careful and make sure that nobody else is targeting me.”

While in the midst of battle, Blackhill Lord kept a vigilant eye on his surroundings.

There were many intermediate and advanced lords among the more than 50 battling lords. Novice lords like him were the weakest participants on the battlefield, and naturally, their chances of defeat were very high. That was why he did not dare to loosen up one bit.

Right at this moment, hum... a soft wind-breaking sound was suddenly heard from behind Blackhill Lord’s back, and it was accompanied by an icy gush of killing intent.

The killing intent caused Blackhill Lord to instinctively turn his body over forcefully, only to see Jian Wushuang brandishing a longsword and thrusting it at his chest. The thrust was extremely fast and its angle of approach was tricky like none other. Had he reacted just a little slower, it would have easily perforated his chest.

“It’s you!”

Blackhill Lord glared at Jian Wushuang and recognized him.

He had previously encountered Jian Wushuang right in this inner layer channel, and they even exchanged blows. The battle strength which the latter exerted back then had shocked him. Had a Gold-armored Puppet not appeared in time, it would have been uncertain whether he could escape alive.

He twisted his body as soon as he saw Jian Wushuang’s strike coming at him, causing the sword light to brush past his shoulders.

“Your response is pretty fast, eh?” Jian Wushuang grinned.

“What a close shave!”

Blackhill Lord heaved in silence, but suddenly, an inexplicable sense of danger rose from the bottom of his heart once again. Although Jian Wushuang’s strike had missed, a beam of dazzling light was now gradually emerging from between his eyebrows.

Jian Wushuang’s glabella seemed to split apart at this moment. An absolutely terrifying Sword Essence surged forth like a streak of thunderbolt.

It was the first-grade sword technique, Mind’s Eye!

It was performed by consolidating Sword Essence in one’s heart before releasing at the crucial moment. The longer the time that the Sword Essence was consolidated, the more powerful it would be.

The last time Jian Wushuang displayed the Mind’s Eye Sword Technique was while he was in Nanyang Continent, and that was nearly four years ago. Since then, his glabella had been continuously storing different types of Sword Essence, of which the one he was currently displaying was merely the weakest variation.

Despite it being the weakest, Blackhill Lord was completely not in time to react when it shot forth. His throat was thus perforated by the sword shadow, and his body collapsed sapless to the ground.

Blackhill Lord, dead!

Although the fighting on the battlefield was exceptionally intense, there were not many lords who had fallen, and therefore every slain lord would garner a lot of attention. Blackhill Lord’s death, too, attracted many eyeballs.

“Another one is dead!”

“Is that Blackhill Lord?”

“Hmph, he’s just a novice lord, little wonder he’s dead. The person who killed him... huh?”

When it was discovered that the person who killed Blackhill Lord was Jian Wushuang, everyone on the entire battlefield was astonished, and they began to look perplexedly at the swordsman.

“It was him?”

“This fella?”

“He was the one who killed Blackhill Lord?”

The facial expressions of the lords present turned odd involuntarily.

Though they had noticed Jian Wushuang’s presence earlier on, who would care about a Saint Realm expert when most of everyone else were lords? That was, until he killed a lord from Pale Moon Marquis’ camp.

“Swordsman?” Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord were shocked too.

They never imagined that Jian Wushuang would be capable of killing a lord. Though he had accomplished it via sneak attacks, it was nevertheless very impressive already.

“Hmph!”

When Myriad Islands Lord of Pale Moon Marquis’ camp saw what happened, he immediately grunted, “Kill that little one!”

A shrill wind-breaking sound was heard. Jian Wushuang saw a burly man appear beside him holding a saber and striking it at his brain. He judged from the man’s aura that the latter was an intermediate lord.

“Swordsman, fall back!” Iron Saber Lord shouted urgently.

With a move of his body, Jian Wushuang left a residual shadow where he was standing while his real body shifted backward. He seemed very calm as he did so.

“Everyone from Drifting-blood Marquis’ camp, get ready...” Jian Wushuang lingered in the middle of a Void while his powerful voice diffused throughout the battlefield.

“Get ready?”

“For what?”

The experts from Drifting-blood Marquis’ camp were puzzled.

But right at this moment, it was time for Jian Wushuang to display his true skill.

An immense gush of killing intent soared like a tide from his body and immediately transformed into a winding blood river which extended outward.

At the same time, immaterial Sword Realms burst forth rapidly from his body.

After activating the Blood Fire Ring, the Blood Fire Domain began to spread out as well.

Road to the Underworld, Hundredfold Realm, and Blood Fire Domain.

The combination of these three realms caused the entire battlefield to be shrouded within a blood river in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang stood in the absolute middle of the blood river. His gaze, which was ice-cold and carried not a shred of emotion, swept across the crowd of experts.

“Realms, suppress!”

A chilly cry was forcefully uttered from Jian Wushuang’s mouth.
