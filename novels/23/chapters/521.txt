Chapter 522: The Fourth Level

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Humans and Demonic Beasts are sworn enemies. The reason why we have the Monster-exterminating League is so that we can contend against them. Whoever wants to cultivate on the Second Level of the Earth Core Palace needs to make contributions. Killing Demonic Beasts and obtaining Monster Cores are an essential contribution!”

“Any person who wants to stay on the Second Level of the Earth Core Palace for one day needs to obtain one Monster Core of a Rank Six Demonic Beast,” Qing Huo answered.

Jian Wushuang’s pupil slightly shrank.

He could understand the requirements for entering Earth Core Palace based on killing the Demonic Beasts and obtaining Monster Cores.

However, requiring a Monster Core of a Rank Six Demonic Beast to enter and stay on the Second Level for only one day sounded a bit too exaggerated.

A Rank Six Demonic Beast was on par with a Six-cloud Realm expert (superior lord). This meant that for a Divine General in the Monster-exterminating League to stay on the Second Level for one day, he needed to kill one Demonic Beast which possessed a Six-cloud Realm’s battle strength.

“Actually, the Earth Core Palace is not the only place that requires Monster Cores. Several places in the Holy Place, including the Monster-exterminating Pagoda, also have the same requirement. There are hundreds of treasure in the Monster-exterminating Pagoda that we can’t buy with Raw Gems but only with Monster Cores from Demonic Beasts!” Qing Huo continued.

“Although?the requirement to enter into the Second Level of the Earth Core Palace is a bit too strict, Divine Generals in the Monster-exterminating League would still like to cultivate there for a while. As for the Third Level... its Origin Energy is much more powerful, so it requires more.”

“Usually, only Divine Emperors are able to cultivate on the Third Level, but they also can’t stay there for a long time. As for the Fourth Level, it requires even more than the previous Levels.”

“There are 108 Divine Emperors in the Monster-exterminating League. Every few years, these Divine Emperors usually cultivate at the Fourth Level for a couple days. If any of them wants to stay there for ten days, it will take them a few years or even about ten years to kill enough Demonic Beasts.”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang felt a bit overwhelmed.

Even Divine Emperors can only cultivate on the Fourth Level for a couple of days every few years?

Then what about the golden Jade Slip in his hand?

“My friend Wushuang, the token that the Emperor Fengxiao gave to you is permission to enter the Fourth Level of the Earth Core Palace. It allows you to stay there for ten days, ten days...” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang with an envious sigh, “What I can say is you are too lucky.”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help laughing.

Although he knew that the Jade Slip was very precious, he didn’t know how valuable it was.

But now, he finally understood.

“Emperor Fengxiao indeed gave me a good gift,”?Jian Wushuang thought with delight.

Soon Qing Huo and Jian Wushuang arrived at the entry to the Second Level.

“My friend Wushang, I will be waiting for you here. Ten days are not that long, you need to take full advantage of it,” Qing Huo said.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile and then entered into the entryway.

The guards who were guarding there stopped him at the beginning, but when Jian Wushuang showed the Jade Slip to them, the guards looked surprised and allowed him to enter. Obviously, they were all surprised that Jian Wushuang had this Jade Slip.

Followed the path, Jian Wushuang continuously advanced to the bottom of the Earth Core Palace and soon he arrived at the Fourth Level.

As soon as he stepped onto the Fourth Level, he immediately sensed the powerful Origin Energy around him.

Jian Wushuang had been cultivating till now, but he hadn’t sensed such powerful Origin Energy.

“So powerful!”

“The Origin Energy here is at least hundred times stronger than outside, maybe even more than that!”

Jian Wushuang was deeply shocked.

It was a real Cultivation Sanctuary which was full of powerful Origin Energy.

The Fourth Level was not as big as the First Level, but there were still numerous secret chambers. Jian Wushuang randomly picked one and entered.

Hunkering down in the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and started to meditate.

It was much faster and easier for him to comprehend Origin inside the chamber than outside.

He had been meditating on 999 Slaughter techniques of the First Level Restriction of Six-story Pagoda, but until now he only could only comprehend about 600, and there were still another 300 Slaughter techniques that he couldn’t understand.

But now, while he was meditating, he soon found out that he was able to overcome the difficulties which had bothered him before.

It seemed he could work them out easily and simply.

“This feeling is really amazing!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, they sparkled with surprise and joy.

In only a couple minutes, he already comprehended ten techniques of the First Level Restriction. It would take him a few days or at least ten days to achieve this if he was outside.

“I only have ten days but it is really a precious chance, so I can’t waste a second.”

He took a deep breath and moved his mind, soon the Slaughter Doppelganger popped up beside him.

The original Body and the Slaughter Doppelganger were both inside the secret chamber to help him meditate.

As time flew by, Jian Wushuang sped up comprehending World Origin and Slaughter Origin.

In a flash, ten days passed.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang’s Original Body and his Slaughter Doppelganger were still sitting with legs crossed.

At this moment, there was a new Origin Mark slowly condensing on his Original Body’s arm. With the addition of the previous Origin Marks, there were already eight World Origin Marks on it.

Right, eight marks!

Lately, Jian Wushuang just had condensed the sixth World Origin Mark in the Wu Yan Tribe. However, when he got to the Fourth Level of the Earth Core Palace, he only spent ten days condensing the seventh and eighth World Origin Mark.

Moreover, this was only the improvement of the World Origin.

It was really incredible.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Doppelganger was also sitting and eight Slaughter Origin Marks showed on his arm.

The Slaughter Origin condensed the eighth Origin Mark as well!

“World Origin, Slaughter Origin, both got eight Marks,”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with delight. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Origin Mark represented the comprehension of the Origin. Since he still didn’t break through the Cloud Realm, the brows of his Origin Mark metamorphosized the Cloud and the power was still limited. But for Jian Wushuang, the usage of these two Origins would be improved dramatically.

His overall strength already had experienced a huge improvement.

“In the Saint Realm, condensing the eighth Origin Mark is already incredible. Not sure if I will still have the chance to get the ninth Mark?”?Jian Wushuang thought.
