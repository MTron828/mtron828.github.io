Chapter 693: Mission Complete

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang killed Hu Hu on his own…”

The evil scarlet-haired youth had been hiding near the castle for so long that he had witnessed everything happened in it. If he had not seen that with his own eyes, he would never believe that a Skyscraping Realm expert could kill a superior Divine Realm expert.

“Though Hu Hu has suffered a sneak attack from Jian Wushuang before, he recovered by taking elixir, therefore, it’s amazing that Jian Wushuang could kill him.

“No wonder the disciples and Palace Masters said that Jian Wushuang was a monster. He is indeed mighty. There is no need for Xuan Yi to have me here.” The youth shook his head while thinking.

“The Ancient Sect is capable of obtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially in the area under its jurisdiction.

“Hu Hu had his dirty businesses hidden quite well, but, the Ancient Sect still found them. Therefore, the sect must have also learned of his power before releasing the mission.?

“And that’s why the words reporting that Hu Hu is likely a superior Divine Realm expert was included in his portrait. However, Xuan Yi removed those words from the file after he received it, on purpose.”

The youth analyzed in secret, and then he decided to send a message to Xuan Yi. “Palace Master Xuan Yi, Jian Wushuang has killed Hu Hu on his own.”

Immediately, he got a reply from him. “Ok, I got it. Come back now.”

The youth shrugged.?“Xuan Yi intentionally gave Jian Wushuang an opponent who was a superior Divine Realm expert but also asked me to protect this disciple in secret. How careful he is!”

The youth complained as he headed back.

After killing Hu Hu, Jian Wushuang found a quiet place to regain his Spiritual Power. He glanced over the treasures in Hu Hu’s Interspatial Ring.

“I have to say that these treasures are really out of the ordinary. Having been a local tyrant for so long, Hu Hu is wealthier than most superior Divine Realm experts.

“Though those treasures are worth 340,000 pieces of Divine Gems, a few may be useful to me.”

After a brief appraisal of the treasures, Jian Wushuang returned to the Ancient Sect.

Three days later, he arrived at the sect, and the first thing he did after he returned was to see his master.

“Master, I’m back,” He stood before Xuan Yi and said respectfully.

“You’ve completed your mission?” Xuan Yi looked at him with a faint smile.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and waved his hand. A pile of corpses immediately appeared lying on the ground. “All the 11 targets, including six Medium Divine Realm experts and five superior ones, have been killed and these are their bodies.”

Xuan Yi looked at the bodies with a cold eye.

“Did things go on well?” He asked casually.

“Yes, except that it took me a lot of effort to kill Hu Hu.” Jian Wushuang answered honestly.

“Oh?” Xuan Yi glanced at him with a slight nod. “Anyway, you’ve completed the mission successfully and this is proof of your power. I’ll make an application to help you enter the Eternal Zone.”

“Thank you, Master,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

“Then go.” Xuan Yi waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang immediately turned away.

Xuan Yi watched his back with a meaningful smile.?“He managed to kill a superior Divine Realm expert and yet, he mentioned no word about that to me. Should it be that he didn’t take Hu Hu seriously at all or is he trying to hide his power from others?”?

After returning to Enlightenment Mountain, Jian Wushuang continued cultivating. As time went by, the opening date of the Eternal Zone drew near.

Finally, three days before the opening, the Ancient Sect released a name list of those who could enter the Eternal Zone.

Every time the zone was opened, the three magnates and nine top sects would have their young disciples, who should also have reached the Divine Realm, adventure in it. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Besides, there was a certain rule about how many people each sect could dispatch to the zone. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

For example, the three magnates could send 10.

As for the nine top sects, it was six.

Though the Ancient Sect was even greater than the three magnates in some ways, rules were rules, so, the sect could only send six disciples there, and they were Liu Chong, Situ Yi, Luo Yong, Dong’er, Feng, and Jian Wushuang.

There was no need to say how powerful Feng was. After all, he was the personal disciple of the Palace Master Destruction and had improved his power by much in these years, with likelihood of becoming an advanced Divine Realm expert and reaching the Eternal Realm.

No one was surprised at his being able to enter.

Luo Yong and Dong’er were the most outstanding disciples among their peers before Jian Wushuang and Feng joined the sect. Having reached the Divine Realm and mastering some powerful Secret Skills, their future was as promising as Feng’s. Therefore, it was reasonable that they were on the list.

As for Liu Chong and Situ Yi, they had entered the sect for more than a hundred years and could not be called youngsters, but, they were both talented and had missed the chance to get into the zone last time. In view of this, their names were put on the list as well.

Among the two, Situ Yi was in the advanced Divine Realm, but he had reached the highest level and was more powerful than Feng, Luo Yong, and Dong’er.

Liu Chong, who was also on the list, was a real superior Divine Realm expert in fact.

Those five people were mighty and had a lot potential, and their qualification was beyond all doubt.

However, Jian Wushuang was different to them.

He was just in the Skyscraping Realm, and there had never been anyone in the Skyscraping Realm adventuring in the Eternal Zone before.

His name on the list confused many others.
