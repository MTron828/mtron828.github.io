Chapter 2693: A Treacherous Dinner

“It doesn’t matter if the Sword Alliance has a strong second-rated or first-rated clan supporting them. We cannot easily offend them,” said Gu Mo.

The long-robed middle-aged man and the lady from the Purple Dress House looked sheepishly at each other as they heard this before nodding to themselves.

It was true that the Sword Alliance had lots of resources and it looked like there was a powerful clan secretly supporting them.

If a clan secretly supported them, the Sword Alliance was not what several small third-rated clans could offend.

“That is why we cannot make any rash moves. Let’s invite the Sword Alliance Master over and have a discussion with him. We need to understand if any powerful clans support the Sword Alliance and inquire about his true purpose. We shall act based on the situation later on,” said Gu Mo.

“Act based on the situation?” The long-robed middle-aged man and the green-clothed lady dress looked at each other. Both of them naturally understood the meaning behind Gu Mo’s words.

“Both of us will make our move first if that’s the case. Palace Master Gu Mo, please send a message to the Sword Alliance as soon as possible,” said the long-robed middle-aged man.

“Don’t worry, Brother Sheng Long. I’ll immediately send the message to Sword Alliance but I have no idea if the Sword Alliance Master will attend the dinner or not,” said Gu Mo.

The long-robed middle-aged man and the green-clothed lady did not stay any longer. They soon turned and left. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, Gu Mo’s eyes turned cold after they left, and even had a weird smile on his face.

“Big Brother, have you heard everything?” Gu Mo started mumbling to himself.

However, an old man who looked cold and did not have any breath of life in him slowly appeared as he finished speaking.

This old man was the other Corpse Palace Master, Shi Mo.

“The Divine Dragon Pavilion and the Purple Dress House came to our Corpse Palace proactively after the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang were continuously wiped out by the Sword Alliance. Haha... Even the gods are helping me.” Gu Mo laughed arbitrarily.

Shi Mo coldly said, “Our Corpse Palace was originally worried about not having a way to centralize the leaders of these forces. However, the Sword Alliance has helped us in a big way. We’ve waited for so long to finally get this chance. Star Fort has been prepared since long ago and I only need to send a message to get them here. As for the Sword Alliance, I’m leaving it to you to send the message. Make sure the Alliance Master comes over no matter what.”

“Don’t worry, Big Brother. Our Corpse Palace has never had any conflict with the Sword Alliance and I even sent an expensive gift when the Sword Alliance was first founded. I did that to make the Alliance Master have a good impression on me. Now that I’m lowering my attitude to personally invite him, I don’t think the Alliance Master will refuse me,” said Gu Mo with a smile.

“That’s good.” Shi Mo slightly nodded.

The people of the Corpse Palace soon sent a token to the Sword Alliance which was placed in front of Jian Wushuang at that moment.

Jian Wushuang looked at the message on the token as he sat on the throne. His facial expressions changed. “Both Corpse Palace Masters personally invited me to attend a dinner at the Corpse Palace. They’re lowering their positions by so much?”

“Dinner?”

“What does the Corpse Palace plan to do?” Xiao Tiexin, Dong Xue, Long Shan, and several others stood in front of Jian Wushuang with weird expressions on their faces.

“Our Sword Alliance has just wiped out the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang. I’m sure the Corpse Palace has something else in mind when they invite you to the dinner at this moment,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“If I assumed correctly, people from Divine Dragon Pavilion and Purple Dress House will be attending that dinner too,” said Dong Xue.

“Perhaps.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He could also notice that this dinner might be one with planned treachery hidden behind that was aimed at him.

“Alliance Master, it matters not if you don’t attend the dinner since it’s so dangerous,” said Hei Yan.

“That’s right. We don’t need to be afraid of the Corpse Palace based on our Sword Alliance’s strength right now. We can ignore this dinner.” Zi Shan also agreed.

“With that said, I don’t plan to completely turn against the Corpse Palace now. The Corpse Palace previously gave me an expensive gift and are even lowering their stance right now. It’s hard to explain my absence when they’ve honored me to this extent.

“Apart from that, I keep having the feeling that this dinner is not going to be so simple,” said Jian Wushuang.

“It’s not that simple?” Xiao Tiexin and the others wondered.

“The Corpse Palace acts so weirdly. The Corpse Palace is the strongest among the third-rated forces surrounding us and even has the support of the Star Fort behind them. Why didn’t the Corpse Palace contend for hegemony when they have such a huge advantage? They even treat the remaining third-rated forces around them politely and humbly. It’s really abnormal.

“The Corpse Palace even sent gifts to express good intentions when our Sword Alliance was first founded. As the saying goes, one who’s unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions. I have this constant feeling that the Corpse Palace is planning something. We should be able to see Corpse Palace’s true intentions in this dinner,” mumbled Jian Wushuang who was deep in his thoughts as he tapped his fingers on the armchair.

He finally made up his mind after some time.

“I’m going to this dinner.”

“Alliance Master...” Xiao Tiexin and the others were surprised.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand as he smiled. “Don’t worry. Although the dinner might be dangerous, it’s impossible to make me stay with only the Corpse Palace’s strength. Not only the Corpse Palace, but even the Star Fort behind them also aren’t capable of doing it.”

He was confident about his strength and means. Although there were people in this Ancient God Domain who could kill him, they did not exist in this Danyang Continent. Let alone just a third-rated force in the Danyang Continent.

Xiao Tiexin and the others glanced at each other but stopped persuading him when they heard that.

However, Long Shan still said, “Alliance Master. Why don’t I lead the Divine Sword Army and wait outside the Corpse Palace for safety precautions? If anything happens during the dinner, you only need to send a message and the Divine Sword Army can attack them.”

“That sounds great.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Long Shan immediately commanded the Divine Sword Army to make preparations after a decision was made.

Three days later, Jian Wushuang left for the Corpse Palace.

The Corpse Palace was extremely strong among the third-rated forces and had control over a large territory—three townships.

Corpse City was where the old den of the Corpse Palace was located at.

The Divine Sword Army was left outside of the Corpse City as Jian Wushuang entered the city alone.

Gu Mo—who had been waiting there for him—immediately walked forward to welcome Jian Wushuang once he entered the city.

“Haha... I’ve long heard about Alliance Master Su Han’s reputation but we were never fated to meet previously. Finally, I’ve gotten to meet you in person today.” Gu Mo looked extremely welcoming.

“I’ve also admired Palace Master Gu Mo’s since a long time ago. It’s a pleasure to meet you today. I wonder if Palace Master Shi Mo is also here?” Jian Wushuang politely asked.

“Big Brother is also here but he’s in retreat all year long and will not be able to welcome you. I hope Alliance Master Su Han won’t be unhappy because of that,” said Gu Mo with a smile.
