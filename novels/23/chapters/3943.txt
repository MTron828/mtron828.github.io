The Temporal Tower could change the flow of time. Even for the simplest level, it had only been a year in the outside world. It was very magical.

When Jian Wushuang first saw the Temporal Tower, he was very shocked by it. At that time, the Temporal Temple Master said that he had personally refined the Temporal Tower.

However, when he came to the Universe Battlefield and gradually understood the secrets of this Star Field and the vast universe, Jian Wushuang knew that the temple master was lying to him.

Yes, the Temporal Tower had indeed been refined by the temple master, but the temple master had just repaired it under the premise that the Temporal Tower already existed.

This Temporal Tower was a special treasure that the Temporal Temple Master had obtained from the Universe Battlefield, and it was still in a damaged stage.

The Temporal Temple Master had an extremely brilliant way of using Temporal. Under the premise that the Temporal Tower already existed, he had managed to restore a portion of the Temporal Tower’s power, that was how the three-story Temporal Tower that stood in the Temporal Temple was created.

“The Temporal Tower can change the flow of time. Although one can hardly sense the principles of heaven and earth in the Temporal Tower, the universe principles, and even the Sword Dao can not be cultivated and comprehended, it is possible to study something in the Temporal Tower that has nothing to do with the outside world and only requires a large amount of time.”

“For example, formations and some secret skills…”

“In the outside world, it takes a long time to study a powerful formation, but if you study it in the Temporal Tower, the time will be greatly reduced.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes slowly lit up.

“Xuan God, please invite Temporal here,” Jian Wushuang said.

…

A few days later, in the secret realm where the Temporal Temple was located in the Divine Beginning Realm.

An exquisite black tower was floating there quietly. The black tower was not tall, but it was divided into three levels.

“Temporal Tower.”

Looking at the black tower in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes revealed a trace of surprise.

When he was the Immortal Saint, he knew that the Temporal Tower was very magical, but he had not really cultivated in it.

After all, although time flowed slowly in the Temporal Tower, it was isolated from heaven and earth. It could only be used to study some special methods, but it could not be used to cultivate and comprehend the principles of Heaven and earth.

“The Temporal Tower is indeed extraordinary. When I first got it, I thought it was an extremely special supreme treasure, or even a principle supreme treasure. However, I found out later that it was not. It was just a special treasure in Temporal. Most importantly, it was too damaged. Its internal structure and countless formations were damaged by 99%. After I got it, it took me a long time to restore it to its current state based on my understanding of Temporal,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Temporal, there shouldn’t be any restrictions for us to enter the Temporal Tower to study arrays or battle formations, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“There are some restrictions,” Temporal Temple Master said solemnly, “first of all, to keep the flow of time in the Temporal Tower running, we need to pay a huge price. If it’s only for the Temporal temple, the price is a bit heavy, but for the Star Palace and the entire Divine Beginning Realm, it’s nothing.

“In addition, the formation of the third level of the Temporal Tower hasn’t been completely completed yet, so we can’t let more than one person enter at a time. As for the second and third levels, there are no restrictions.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and said, “Then please do your best to maintain the operation of the Temporal Tower for these years.”

“No problem.” Temporal Temple Master nodded.

“Demon Dragon.” Jian Wushuang looked behind him at the 36 people, including Demon Dragon Lord.

He had selected these 36 people from his 41 slaves, including Demon Dragon Lord and Devil Scorpion Lord, the two most powerful experts.

“From today on, you 36 people will enter the second floor of the Temporal Tower and concentrate on studying the Immortal Dipper Battle Formation given to you by Stone Fire Star Master. I’ll give you 800 years at most. In the outside world, 800 years is equivalent to 80,000 years in the space of the second floor of the Temporal Tower. You should be able to master the battle formation. After 800 years, you can practice it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” The Demon Dragon Lord and the other 36 slaves accepted the order at the same time.

“Stone Fire, go in with them and help them control the battle formation,” Jian Wushuang instructed.

“Yes, Master.” The Ruler Star Fire nodded.

Immediately, the Ruler Star Fire, Demon Dragon Lord, and the other 36 slaves entered the second level of the Temporal Tower.

After they entered the Temporal Tower, Jian Wushuang also walked toward the tower.

He was going to the third level!

The third level of the Temporal Tower was a simple open space. Jian Wushuang stood on the open space, but he could clearly feel that the time flow in this open space was completely different from the outside world.

“The time flow in the second level of the Temporal Tower is 100 times slower than the outside world, and the time flow in the third level is 1,000 times slower!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

1,000 times the flow of time.

In other words, he had been cultivating here for 1,000 years, and only one year had passed in the outside world.

Of course, the flaw was that this space was completely isolated from the outside world, so it was impossible to comprehend the principles, the universe principles, and even the sword principle.

However, it was possible to study the absolute arts and perfect the sword formation.

“I created three sword skills, including the wave light sword skill and the Earth Protection Sword Formation, which have been improved into the wave light sword formation and the Earth Protection Sword Formation. These two sword formations have been greatly improved under the guidance of the Ruler Spark, but they haven’t reached the limit!” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

His two sword formations did have a lot of room for improvement.

Not only the two sword formations, but also the most powerful attack swordsmanship, the obscure swordsmanship. In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, it was also possible to evolve into the obscure swordsmanship.

Once the obscure swordsmanship was transformed into a sword formation, his attack power would greatly increase. By then, his three sword formations, one to kill, one to trap, and one to defend, would have no flaws, then his strength would naturally be different.

Whether it was evolving or continuing to perfect his sword formation, he needed a lot of time. Staying in the eternal tower, the flow of time was 1,000 times slower, this gave him enough time to study his three sword formations.

“Let’s begin.”

In the space on the third floor of the Temporal Tower, Jian Wushuang had already begun to immerse himself in the evolution and perfection of his sword formation.
