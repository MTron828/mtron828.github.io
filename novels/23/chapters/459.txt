Chapter 460: Palace

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

The lords from both camps traced the aura to its source, which was not a far distance away. It turned out to be a lofty and massive palace.

“A palace?”

“There’s actually such a huge palace within this cave mansion?”

“The aura originated from this palace?”

The lords arrived in front of the palace and raised their heads to examine the palace’s exterior.

The palace was completely covered in black and was incomparably massive. Within it was contained the unique and widespread aura.

“While this cave mansion is divided into an inner and outer layer, its real core is this palace, perhaps.” Jian Wushuang mused.

He was not the only person who thought so. The lords from both camps could tell that this palace was special and that there was a high chance it was the real core of the cave mansion.

More importantly, if a Dao Weapon could even be found in the inner layer, what could there be in the palace, as the absolute core of the cave mansion?

Everyone became expectant.

“Enter!”

Black Yuan Lord waved his hand and was the first to head toward the gate of the palace. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Without hesitation, the lords from both camps entered the gate and stepped into the palace one after another.

The palace, decorated in gold and jade, was extremely spacious within. The most noticeable object was the towering stone pillars, which each required a dozen or so people to encircle, and on which were carved numerous patterns.

There was also a large number of extravagant ornaments in the palace.

“Look there, quick!”

In compliance with the voice, everyone’s eyes turned toward the direct front of the palace.

A lofty throne was placed there, and on it sat an apparently middle-aged man who was draped in a blood-red cloak and had blood-red hair. His hands were clasped as he quietly sat upright on the throne with his eyes closed. He did not emit a trace of aura.

In front of this middle-aged man with red hair stood four people who looked like sculptures.

They were suited in purple-golden armor and their hands firmly gripped huge sabers. However, their eyes were also closed.

“Puppet Fighters!”

When the experts from both camps saw the man and the four sculptures in purple-golden armor, they immediately knew that these were Puppet Fighters.

By all probability, these were extremely powerful Puppet Fighters to boot.

At the very least, they would be more powerful than the Gold-armored Puppets the lords had encountered in the inner layer!

And it must be noted that the Gold-armored Puppets were already able to rival advanced lords.

“Look at what’s on their hands,” a lord suddenly exclaimed.

Everyone immediately looked at the palms of the Puppet Fighters. What they saw caused their pupils to constrict at once.

A ring was worn on the left index finger of each of the four armored Puppet Fighters. Emitting a special energy wave, they were clearly Interspatial Rings.

Yes, every one of the four Puppet Fighters was wearing an Interspatial Ring.

Similarly, the middle-aged man with red hair wore an Interspatial Ring on his left index finger.

“Interspatial Rings!”

The eyes of the lords from both camps began to scorch.

Although the entire palace was extravagantly decorated, there were no treasures or opportunities within it except for these Interspatial Rings being worn by the Puppet Fighters. It was thus conceivable that the real treasure within the palace lied in those rings.

As soon as this idea came to mind, the lords from both camps hurriedly moved nearer to the Puppet Fighters.

However, before the lords could reach them, the eyes of the four Puppet Fighters simultaneously opened.

Frosty and completely emotionless, they looked over at the lords.

“Intruders!”

“Kill!”

The four Puppet Fighters simultaneously began to move after one of them uttered these words in a chilly voice.

Four beams of purple-golden Flowing Light pierced through the Void, while at the same time, four powerful auras began to spread.

These four auras were each no weaker than that of a superior lord.

“As expected!”

The experts from both camps felt a sense of marvel but did not feel surprised when they saw the auras emitting from the Puppet Fighters.

After all, the Gold-armored Puppets which they encountered in the inner layer were already comparable to advanced lords. It was obvious to them that these four Golden Purple Puppets would be even stronger than that, being situated in the palace which was clearly the core of the cave mansion no less.

These four Puppet Fighters were on a par with superior lords.

However, none of the lords imagined that the four Puppet Fighters would wave their hands as they moved.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Beams of golden flowing light shot out from their Interspatial Rings. Soon, Gold-armored Puppets filled the palace.

“Gold-armored Puppets?”

The countenances of the lords changed.

Reasonably speaking, the threat of Gold-armored Puppets was not as great as that of Golden Purple Puppets. However, an endless stream of Gold-armored Puppets emerged from the Interspatial Rings, such that in the blink of an eye, more than 50 of them appeared.

“This...”

Including the two most powerful lords, Black Yuan Lord and Demon Soul Lord, the faces of every lord from both camps sank.

To these two camps, there was nothing frightening about facing four Golden Purple Puppets, much as they had the battle strength of four superior lords.

But now, with the addition of more than 50 Gold-armored Puppets, the lords would have to face the equivalent of more than 50 advanced lords...

A lineup of four superior lords and more than 50 advanced lords was comfortably superior to the combined strength of the two camps.

“So many?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted as well. He was increasingly feeling the terror of the cave mansion’s owner.

Next, he conceived a thought which caused a vast Blood River to sweep forth immediately.

A combination of his three Realms suppressed forth.

Under the suppression of the Realms, the speed of the Gold-armored Puppets was obviously reduced by a notch, while the four Golden Purple Puppets were similarly affected.

“These Realms are not bad indeed.” Black Yuan Lord glanced at Jian Wushuang and at the same time ordered, “Loftiness Lord and Iron Saber Lord, make sure you protect this fella.”

“Yes.”

Loftiness Lord and Iron Saber Lord nodded and immediately appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

The two of them understood the importance of Jian Wushuang to Marquis Piaoxue’s camp.

“Everyone else, follow me to kill. Our camp must obtain at least three of the four Interspatial Rings.”

Black Yuan Lord’s expression was frigid.

“Let’s get moving!”
