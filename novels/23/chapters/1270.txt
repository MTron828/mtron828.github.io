Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Universe God Qian Luan!” Jian Wushuang came up to her.

“Jian Wushuang, you finally came out. Have you gained anything in the secret chamber?” asked Universe God Qian Luan.

“Yes, quite a lot.” Jian Wushuang gave a slight nod.

“Great. As you can see, we’re in big trouble now.” Universe God Qian Luan’s beautiful eyebrows were furrowed with worry.

“I knew that Xiu kingdom would not give up trying to seize this island. “Among the two Universe Gods present from Xiu State, one is Universe God Lei Ming, in the elementary First Heaven. The other one is Universe God Wu, in the advanced First Heaven. The latter’s power is on par with mine. I’ll handle him and Universe God Lei Ming will be left to you.”

“Universe God Lei Ming?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the tall man standing in the distance and nodded, saying, “Okay, leave him to me.”

Universe God Qian Luan cast an expectant look at Jian Wushuang before she stepped out to face the experts of Xiu State.

“Universe God Qian Luan,how have you been since we last met?” The young man, Universe God Wu, looked at Universe God Qian Luan coldly. He did not bother to acknowledge Jian Wushuang, who was just a Universe Master, standing beside her.

“Universe God Wu, Universe God Lei Ming, why are you here today?” Universe God Qian Luan asked.

“Why are we here today? You know there is no need to ask this question, right? “We are here to take back Leopard-print Gem Mine which rightfully belongs to us!” Universe God Wu answered in a cold voice, “Universe God Qian Luan, if you are not a fool, lead your people out the island immediately and we can still maintain a good relationship, otherwise…”

“Otherwise what? “You will invade this island?” Universe God Qian Luan’s eyes hardened and in a loud voice, she continued, “Universe God Wu, think again. Everyone who has tried to occupy our territory has paid their price. Red Water Alliance, which was destroyed by us, is the best example.

Now, do you want to make the same mistake?”

On hearing this, Universe God Wu smiled coldly before replying, “Universe God Qian Luan, stop trying to frighten us. We are not as stupid as Red Water Alliance to let you destroy our headquarters. Our headquarters is in the Holy Prefecture. If you dare, come over and fight with us,”

Universe God Wu’s words were spoken recklessly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With the Holy Prefecture’s support, Xiu State had no fears that Scarlet Island would wipe them out, as what they had done to Red Water Alliance.

Universe God Qian Luan’s face hardened. “If so, there is nothing more to say. Let’s fight. I’d love to see how you will take over this island with only yourself and Lei Ming.”

“Haha, I can do that by myself.” Universe God Wu sneered and waved his hand at the people standing behind him. “Men, kill them all!”

As his voice fell…

Boom! ! !

Powerful auras rose everywhere, accompanied by bursts of loud shouts.

Led by Universe God Wu and Universe God Lei Ming, the Holy Masters and Universe Masters of Xiu State swarmed into?Leopard-print Island.

Although there was a Formation protecting the island, Jian Wushuang’s side could not rely on it to block off the invaders.

The experts from the two sides engaged in a fierce battle in no time.

“Jian Wushuang, as we agreed before, you will handle Universe God Lei Ming. Remember, try your best to hold him off and when you can’t hold on anymore, just flee. Don’t get yourself killed.” After saying this, Universe God Qian Luan charged at her opponent.

“Try my best to hold him off? “Don’t get myself killed?”

Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face after hearing her words. After casting a cold eye at Universe God Lei Ming, who had a ferocious aura about him, he charged at him.

“Haha, go to hell!”

With bloodshot eyes and a contorted face, Universe God Lei Ming’s laughter resounded round the whole place. He had a huge axe in each hand and there was enormous power behind every move when he struck out. No one from Scarlet Island could survive a single strike from him.

He was like a tiger in a flock, slaughtering at will.

When Jian Wushuang reached him, he just shot a glance at him, not taking him seriously at all.

He could sense that Jian Wushuang was only a Universe Master.

Even if Jian Wushuang was an Invincible Universe Master, in Universe God Lei Ming’s eyes, he was nothing more than an ant.

“Go to hell!”

Universe God Lei Ming snorted and he struck at Jian Wushuang with the axe in his left hand.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes at the strike. The Blood Mountain Sword quivered excitedly in his hands. He then struck out as well.

As he swung the sword, Jian Wushuang exerted all his power behind the move.

Clang!

The sword shadow pierced through the void and clashed with the axe. There was a sound of metal on metal.

When the sound stopped, a horrible power was released immediately.

Universe God Lei Ming did not take Jian Wushuang seriously at all until this moment, when he felt Jian Wushuang’s power through his axe.

“He is a Universe God?”

Universe God Lei Ming’s eyes narrowed and he immediately looked at Jian Wushuang. The collision had numbed his arm and his axe almost slipped out of his hand. He thought this type of power should have come from a Universe God.

However, Jian Wushuang was only a Universe Master, which was a surprise to him.

“Kid, who are you?” Universe God Lei Ming gazed at Jian Wushuang and shouted.

“You don’t need to know my name. What you need to know is that as long as I’m here, you can no longer kill anyone on Scarlet Island,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“I can no longer kill anyone on Scarlet Island?” “Ridiculous!” Universe God Lei Ming’s eyes sparkled. “I’ll kill you, a weak Universe Master, first.”

As he spoke, a terrifying Killing Intent immediately swept out from him. His big body seemed to grow even stronger when he displayed a Secret Skill. His bloodshot eyes became even more vivid.

“God-killing Shift!”

“The Seven Axe Moves of… Jiu You!”

The roar thundered throughout the place and the power behind it was earth-shattering.

Watched by horrified eyes, Universe God Lei Ming rushed forward with his two axes, striking out quickly.

For a time, there was dead silence.

On the other side, Universe God Qian Luan was busy fighting with Universe God Wu, but almost at the same time, both of them felt a horrible power rising forth.
