Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, where are you now?” Lei Chao sent a message abruptly and it was obvious that his voice was filled with anxiousness.

“I am at this place, is there something wrong?” Jian Wushuang informed Lei Chao of his location immediately.

“Quick, head toward your northwest. Long Ya is in that direction and he is currently being pursued by someone. Please go over to save him at once,” Lei Chao said continuously.

“Long Ya is being pursued?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

In the fight for the White Blaze Fruit this time round, all three disciples of the Lineage of Star who had made it into the Universe God ranking list had come.

However, in Wu Bei’s cave, the three of them were separated. Jian Wushuang had been acting alone and it seemed that Long Ya, as well as Xuan Yi, had been doing the same.

“Could it be that Long Ya has obtained a White Blaze Fruit?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“That’s right. In a stroke of luck, he managed to get one White Blaze Fruit. However, he was targeted by quite a number of experts and he is currently using the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood to escape with all his might. However, the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood uses up Divine Power at a very fast rate and it will not last long. Xuan Yi has also made his way over. However, you are the closest to Long Ya. I will inform Long Yu to escape in your direction and he might still make it,” Lei Chao said.

“Alright, I will head there straight away.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and he unleashed his speed. Even he himself unleashed the first stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood and plunged toward the direction of Long Ya.

In a vast void. Swish!

A glittering light was escaping with an amazing speed. However, a short distance behind him, there was a black, dim light giving chase and its speed was quite fast as well.

“Jerk!”

There were many bloodstains on Long Ya and he looked very miserable. After he shot a glance at the black, dim light behind him, his expression turned extremely ugly.

Previously, his luck was good and he had managed to get a White Blaze Fruit during a fight that many Universe Gods had participated in.

After getting the White Blaze Fruit, he used the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood to escape straight away. Initially, he had thought that by relying on the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood, he would be able to lose all the Universe Gods. However, he totally did not expect to come across a fearsome guy while escaping. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

At that moment, Long Ya’s Divine Power was being used up rapidly.

By relying on the second stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood, his speed had already risen by more than a hundred times. Yet, he was still unable to lose the black dim light behind him.

He was not like Jian Wushuang who had the King of Venomous Worms attached to him to help him replenish his Divine Power. Since Long Ya’s Divine Power was being depleted at a very fast rate, he would not be able to maintain his speed for much longer.

“I have exhausted seventy percent of my Divine Power and I only have thirty percent left. At best, I can only last for one eighth of an hour more,” Long Ya clenched both his fists tightly.

For a normal, intense battle, one eighth of an hour was considered long. However, to Long Ya, who was escaping, it was too short.

“Eh?”

Long Ya’s expression changed abruptly. He had already received Lei Chao’s message and got the information that Jian Wushuang was rushing over. At the same time, he also got to know Jian Wushuang’s location.

“Great!”

Long Ya was delighted. He did not hesitate and immediately escaped in the direction of Jian Wushuang. As for that black, dim light, it followed him persistently like before.

As time passed, his Divine Power decreased rapidly.

Previously, he had already used up seventy-percent. Eventually, it became eighty percent, and then ninety.

When he had depleted ninety percent of his Divine Power, Long Ya finally started to panic.

“He’s not here yet. Jian Wushuang is not here yet?” Long Ya’s body was shivering. He felt that he had exhausted all the Divine Power in the body.

“I cannot last any longer.”

Long Ya felt helpless. He then turned his head and shouted: “Universe God Xiong Fu, I will give you the White Blaze Fruit, please stop chasing me.”

“Haha” A loud and earth-shaking laugh could be heard from the black, dim light, “If you had given me that White Blaze Fruit from the start, I would not have made things difficult for you. However, you are about to run out of steam. Lowering your head now is too late. By killing you, that White Blaze Fruit will still be mine. Moreover, I can also get all the treasures you possess. Why wouldn’t I do it? Afterall, I won’t need to use too much effort.”

“Bastard, I am a disciple of the Star Palace,” Long Ya bellowed.

“Don’t use Star Palace disciple to frighten me. My Heaven Axe Divine Palace is not afraid of your Lineage of Star,” Universe God Xiong Fu, who was within the black light, sneered.

Long Ya’s expression turned even paler.

He had already reached the state where the Divine Power in his body was completely used up. Without sufficient Divine Power to last, Long Ya’s speed decreased greatly.

“Haha, Long Ya, die!”

Cruel laughter resounded across the horizon and the black light appeared behind Long Ya.

Long Ya’s gaze turned serious. With a flip of his palm, the White Blaze Fruit appeared in his hands. What followed after that was him tossing the White Blaze Fruit in a random direction without hesitation.

“The White Blaze Fruit?”

The expression of Universe God Xiong Fu, who had reached the back of Long Ya, changed slightly. After that, he immediately changed his direction and plunged toward the White Blaze Fruit.

In no time, Universe God Xiong Fu caught up with the White Blaze Fruit and he grabbed it with his hands.

“Hmph, do you think you can escape from me just like that?”

After keeping the White Blaze Fruit into a Qian Kun Ring, Universe God Xiong Fu’s icy-cold eyes locked on to Long Ya, who was continuing his escape. With a flash of murderous intent, he gave chase again.

It was obvious that Universe God Xiong Fu would only let the matter drop when he had killed Long Ya.

However, at that moment, in the void in front of Long Ya, a black dot appeared out of thin air. Moreover, the black dot was getting bigger with a shocking speed.

“Jian Wushuang!!”

Long Ya was over the moon and he relied on his last bit of Divine Power to head toward Jian Wushuang.

The two of them finally met.

Rustle!

Jian Wushuang stood in front of Long Ya straight away. Long Ya had collapsed completely and his aura had become extremely weak.

Swoosh!

The black light which had followed behind Long Ya stopped as well. The dim light dissipated, revealing a cruel-looking man who wore black armor.

The cruel-looking man’s hands were carrying one big axe each. At that moment, he was looking toward Jian Wushuang with interest.

“Long Ya, are you all right?” Jian Wushuang shot a glance toward Long Ya, who was behind him.

“This is not enough to make me die. I have merely exhausted my Divine Power. Also, the White Blaze Fruit has fallen into the hands of Universe God Xiong Fu,” Long Ya said in a low voice and his eyes filled with flames of fury.

“I have some elixirs with me. Take them immediately to regain your Divine Power,” Jian Wushuang tossed a few elixirs over to Long Ya. The elixirs were obtained by Jian Wushuang from the Real Gods who he had killed back in the Sky Sword Prison. The effects of the elixirs were impressive as well.

“All right,” Long Ya nodded his head seriously. Without hesitation, he swallowed the elixirs with one gulp and started to recover his Divine Power at once.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned and he looked at the cruel-looking man who was wearing black armor.

“Universe God Xiong Fu!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted slightly.

Universe God Xiong Fu was ranked ninth on the Universe God ranking list!

The most outstanding genius disciple of the current generation in the Heaven Axe Divine Palace. He was also acknowledged as one of the Ten Monsters by the Eternal Chaotic World.

To date, this was the very first expert in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list that Jian Wushuang had come across!
