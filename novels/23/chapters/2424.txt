Chapter 2425: Why Do You Deserve It?

“He admitted it. He admitted!” exclaimed those people around suddenly.

Jian Wushuang admitted that he had passed the eighth trial bridge’s test before many genius disciples.

“It really is you!” Pang Tao’s face flushed red.

Jian Wushuang flipped his hands and took out two jade slips. “These two jade slips are the items I obtained after crossing the eighth trial bridge. The first jade slip is Purple Blood Saint’s insights on sword principle while the second jade slip is the Purple Blood Sword Skill which was self-invented by Purple Blood Saint. I have all of it here, but why should I give you these two jade slips? What makes you think you deserve it?”

‘What makes you think you deserve it?’

These simple seven words made everyone around him stagnate.

So what if Jian Wushuang had admitted to it?

He won the two jade slips through testifying his strength, so he was the rightful owner. Why should he give it away to Pang Tao for nothing?

“Hmph, these two jade slips belong to me. These two jade slips are the reason I came into Saint’s Tomb and I have absolute confidence that I can pass the test of the eighth trial bridge. You have the time advantage because I spent a little longer in the outer area of the tomb and came in late. Now, I want to get back what rightfully belongs to me,” said Pang Tao coldly.

He sounded extremely confident, but the disciples around were not fools. Contemptuous rose in their hearts when they heard of Pang Tao’s claim.

What a joke. Did he think it was easy to pass the eighth bridge’s test?

If it was so easy, it would not have remained till today.

Although Pang Tao was talented in sword skills and his master was Fan Jianxian, 99 percent of the people still did not think that he could easily pass the eighth trial bridge’s test.

They thought it was funny that Pang Tao flagrantly claimed the two jade slips were meant to be his.

As expected, before Jian Wushuang could say anything Zhong Yi from Narcissus Island rebuked, “Pang Tao, you are the core disciple of the Great Compassion Sect, and one of the Twelve Minor Kings. How can you carry yourself in such a manner? Opportunities have always resided with the one who is well prepared and competent. Let’s not mention that even if you were given the chance, you will never be able to pass the eighth trial bridge’s test. Now that the opportunity has fallen into Junior Brother Wushuang’s hands. It rightfully belongs to him, keeping to the order of arrival.”

“That’s right. Pang Tao, how insolent of you to say that.” Su Tong added.

“Did you just call me insolent? Haha...” Pang Tao smiled coldly as he threw frivolous looks at the surrounding disciples.

Their expressions changed as the genius disciples from various sects met Pang Tao’s gaze.

They came from many different sects and they were also arrogant to a certain extent, but they became timid in the face of Pang Tao.

The reverence was not only because of Pang Tao’s power but also due to the Great Compassion Sect where Pang Tao belonged.

As the top sect in the Wusha Wilderness, the Great Compassion Sect had a transcendent existence and was recognized as an overlord.

The sect had always acted somewhat overbearing and arrogant which the other sects had long gotten used to. Usually, the other sects would try to avoid the Great Compassion Sect and tolerated it. No one had the guts to challenge them head-on.

Although they witnessed the incident, they felt it had nothing to do with them. Even when they saw Pang Tao acting unscrupulously because of his terrifying background, no one dared to speak out for Narcissus Island.

Pang Tao took in all of their expressions and scoffed before speaking again, “Very well, since you call me insolent, I will not push you to dead ends. Jian Wushuang, I can allow you to make a copy of the contents in both jade slips, but you have to hand over the two jade slips to me. How about that?”

Pang Tao looked down at Jian Wushuang with a touch of loftiness in his words and actions.

When the people around heard him, their lips secretly pouted in disgust. However, in Pang Tao’s opinion, he was being very kind to allow Jian Wushuang in making a copy of the contents.

The corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth curled up with a strange arc when facing the cold stare from Pang Tao. With a flip of his palms, both jade slips returned into his interspatial ring before folding his hands and casually asked, ” What if I don’t agree?”

Pang Tao’s face turned dark. “You don’t agree? Then you’ll have to die here.”

“Really? Perhaps, I should try.” Jian Wushuang kept his smile.

“Jian Wushuang...” Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and the others were surprised by his response.

Although Pang Tao was being unreasonable, it was no joke if he were to duel with Pang Tao.

“Young boy, it seems that you really wanted to die.” Pang Tao’s voice was harsh and a faint murderous intent rose in his eyes.

Before he threw out any moves...

“Pang Tao, what do you want to do?” A stern voice emerged followed by several figures rushing in quickly, appearing in front of Jian Wushuang in a blink of an eye, blocking Jian Wushuang behind their bodies.

They were the disciples of the Ancient Star Temple headed by Zhuo Bing and Ling Dan.

“It’s the Ancient Star Temple’s Ice Queen and Ling Dan!”

“Ling Dan is one of the Twelve Minor Kings!”

Someone immediately pointed out the identities of Zhuo Bing and Ling Dan.

“Brother, are you okay?” Zhuo Bing turned and looked at Jian Wushuang. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Big Sister, I’m okay. Why are you here?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“We were already in the inner area and were just nearby. Senior Brother Ling Dan and I rushed over immediately when I heard that Pang Tao was finding fault with Narcissus Island. Don’t worry, Big Sister is here. I’ll not let anyone hurt you,” said Zhuo Bing in a deep voice.

Jian Wushuang raised his brows. His big sister really treated him well.

However, were those people from the Ancient Star Temple able to stop Pang Tao?

“Ling Dan, this matter has nothing to do with the Ancient Star Temple. You should leave!” Pang Tao stared at Ling Dan with cold eyes. As for Zhuo Bing, she was not a threat at all.

Among the younger disciples of Wusha Wilderness, the Twelve Minor Kings were the most outstanding group. Although some other young cultivators had powers that were close to the Twelve Minor Kings, there was still a gap between their strengths in a real battle.

There were many talented disciples standing in front of Pang Tao, but only Ling Dan—one of the Twelve Minor Kings—got his attention. He did not care much about the others.

“Sorry, Jian Wushuang is my Junior Sister Zhuo Bing’s brother. If you’re looking for trouble with him, I can’t pretend to not see it.” Ling Dan looked at Pang Tao solemnly.

Ling Dan ranked lower among the Twelve Minor Kings as neither his strength nor status were as good as Pang Tao. He would not fight against Pang Tao unless necessary.

However, he would never let Pang Tao hurt Jian Wushuang for the sake of Zhuo Bing.
