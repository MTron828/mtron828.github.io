Chapter 252: Displayed The Movements

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

The majestic sword essence kept rolling, and made Mo Lingtian and his comrades violently retreat one after another.

The Starlight Sword Array was immediately disintegrated.

No sooner had the dignified lady, who was part of the three, regained her balance than a figure appeared beside her like a ghost.

“What?” The dignified lady was stunned. She struggled to turn around and saw a cold sword light flash before her eyes. The light got closer and closer, and left the lady no time to resist it.

Chi!

The sword light ruthlessly passed over the dignified lady. She was killed by Jian Wushuang without having a second to emit a scream.

Jian Wushuang didn’t stop his advance. He bounded up again and appeared next to the black-haired middle-aged man.

Seeing this, the black-haired middle-aged man suddenly shrunk his eyes.

He saw how the dignified lady got killed by Jian Wushuang a while ago. The lady was no weaker in terms of strength.

Buzzing!

There came another beautiful and mournful sword light.

The black-haired middle-aged man widened his eyes, and his face was filled with a hint of frenzy. At this point, he slashed his sword out in panic, hoping he could stop the sword light, however, the result was not in his favor.

The sword light mercilessly streaked from the black-haired middle-aged man, and his Long Sword was directly sheared off in the middle. Without a pause, the sword light continued cutting across the man’s throat.

“How could it be possible?”

The black-haired middle-aged man felt it was unbelievable even at the last minute before he died.

How could his blade just be cut into two pieces by Jian Wushuang’s sword?

Having killed two Peak of the Yang Void Realm experts in succession, Jian Wushuang now focused his eyes upon Mo Lingtian.

By then, Mo Lingtian was already freaking out.

“Junior Brother Luo and Junior Sister Yu.”

Mo Lingtian looked extremely frightened.

“Only seven months have passed. How could have this fellow enhance his strength like this in such a short time?”

Mo Lingtian felt it was incredible. When he noticed Jian Wushuang’s eyes upon him, he instantly could feel that he skipped a beat.

“Run!”

At this point, Mo Lingtian just turned around and ran away without any hesitation. He was running to where Qi Luosheng was. While running, he shouted. “Tower Master Qi, help me, help me!”

The wicked figure Qi Luosheng had been sitting on the raised platform on the Drill Ground. He coldly gave Mo Lingtian a glance and said scornfully, “What trash the people in the Wilderness Sword Sect are. No wonder they are about to lose the position of one of the eight top Sects.”

He still stood up slowly.

As soon as he stood up, an intense sense of power was instantly engulfing the area.

Having felt the strong force, the experts who were fiercely fighting on the entire field of the Heartless Island couldn’t help but stop and look in awe.

Countless eyes were fixed upon Qi Luosheng.

“You finally decided to get up?” Jian Wushuang half closed his eyes, and stared at Qi Luosheng.

Qi Luosheng was the Tower Master of the Blood Feather Tower. His rank was that of a Divine Transcendence.

The fight had been going on for quite a long time. However, Qi Luosheng hadn’t displayed any sign of interest. That is until now.

“Divine Transcendence!”

“He was finally about to take action!”

“A top expert of Divine Transcendence, how powerful can he be?”

Outside the Heartless Island, a large number of experts from different Sects were excitedly staring at Qi Luosheng.

In the Tianzong Dynasty, the Divine Transcendence could be called a legend. Everybody knew that such an expert had accumulated incredible strength and skills. However, no one knew the extent of his power.

Most of the experts present, including the Yin-Yang Void Realm experts, had never seen a Divine Transcendence expert display a movement before. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

But finally, they would have the chance to see it.

“Divine Transcendence.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glistening. By no time, there was a monstrous battle intent rising up.

Feeling the battle intent, Qi Luosheng on the raised platform threw a sneer on his face. He then bounded up and appeared 10 meters away in front of Jian Wushuang. Qi Luosheng was just levitating on the Void and overlooking Jian Wushuang. “You don’t feel scared in front of me. Instead, your battle intent is so violent right now. You have a lot of guts.”

“I don’t. I just want to see how strong the Divine Transcendence top expert is.” Jian Wushuang stretched out his tongue and licked his lips as if signifying his desire to experience true power. The battle intent was enormous.

“Ha ha, do you think you are qualified to see my real strength?” Qi Luosheng sneered. Followed by the display of his three fingers, “Three finger points!”

“If you can survive from my three fingers, then you are qualified to see my real strength.”

There was a tinge of obvious condescension in Qi Luosheng’s words.

However, none of the experts present could ignore his arrogance, because he was Divine Transcendence.

Divine Transcendence and Yin-Yang Void Realm were completely two different concepts.

How strong the expert in such level would be?

“Three fingers?” Jian Wushuang sneered. “Then I will wait and see.”

“I won’t let you down.” Qi Luosheng lightly smiled. A second later, he lifted his fingers, “Watch it, this is the first finger.”

No sooner had Qi Luosheng uttered the words than he stretched out one of his right fingers.

It was a simple and casual pointing. However, as soon as he pointed his finger out, a horrible breath pervaded in the air at once.

The Void in front of Jian Wushuang was suddenly cut through, followed by the appearance of a giant finger. The huge finger was composed of the vast Spiritual Power. It sent forth an odd and violent breath, as if it extended from the ancient time.

The moment the giant finger appeared, the experts on the Heartless Island were all shocked, horrified and intrigued.

The giant finger contained horrible power, and everybody felt frightened and trembling.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but shrink his eyes. A second later, he fiercely slashed his Triple-kill Sword out without hesitation.

“The fifth move of the Selfless Sword Technique, Blood Rupturing Movement!”

World Origin was completely activated!

The majestic sword shadow that Jian Wushuang used to cut through Mo Lingtian’s sword formation before burst out again at once, and it instantly collided with the giant finger. By no time, the two violent forces were just extruding immense power together.

Rumble... The void was shuddering, and the horrible power was splattering.

However suddenly, with a bang sound, the majestic sword shadow directly collapsed.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. The giant finger continued pointing towards him, and he couldn’t do anything except lifting his Triple-kill Sword before his chest.

A mighty bang was heard, and then Jian Wushuang’s body was just destructively forced back. Jian Wushuang had been pushed back for a few hundred meters away, and he didn’t keep stand on his feet until he was in the Void over the edge of the Heartless Island. At this moment, his face was already pale.

“You warded off the first finger, good. But I just activated 30% of my strength on this finger!”

“For the second one, I will activate 60% of my strength!”
