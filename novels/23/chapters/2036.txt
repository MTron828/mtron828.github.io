2037 Hopeless Situation

“Sword Emperor, it’s your call!”

Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s shrill scream resounded in Jian Wushuang’s ears and his body quivered.

He never once looked back but the determination in his eyes grew more intense.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s speed reached a higher limit and he barged into the golden whirlpool at the first instant.

Ling Zong and the other few Great Emperors tried their best with him from behind. However, it was impossible to stop Jian Wushuang before he got close to the Emperor Supreme Rock.

In the end, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the Emperor Supreme Rock again.

Looking at the Emperor Supreme Rock in front of him, which was a hundred zhang tall, Jian Wushuang instantly clenched his hands.

He had wanted to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock previously but Ling Zong managed to stop him in time.

Then, he had no route of return and he could only fight all out.

“Break apart!”

Jian Wushuang sounded hysterical. His divine power burst out in collaboration with his power of ancient tribe bloodline. Then, they flowed into Blood Mountain Sword madly.

It was as though Blood Mountain Sword could feel Jian Wushuang’s madness. It started quivering vigorously and constantly whistled.

Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principle exploded entirely.

It was still Sword Principle Xuan Luo and it was the Blast Rainstorm that focused on power the most!

Moving like strong wind with the momentum of rainstorm.

There was a terrifying sword light that blotted out the sky and the sun which appeared in the golden whirlpool. It slashed at the huge Emperor Supreme Rock directly.

“Sh*t!”

Ling Zong and the others who rushed before the Emperor Supreme Rock saw the sword light and their faces grew grave.

However, they had just gotten there and Jian Wushuang had already stroked out his sword light. They couldn’t block it in time and could only watch the terrifying sword light hit the Emperor Supreme Rock.

Clang!

There was an ear-piercing clang and the entire golden whirlpool quivered.

However, it resumed tranquility after that.

The hundred zhang tall lofty Emperor Supreme Rock continued to float in the air quietly. There was no sign of the Emperor Supreme Rock’s surface as it was hit by Jian Wushuang’s sword light, let alone the fact that it wasn’t shattered.

“What?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

He fought with his all and performed a Blast Rainstorm in Sword Principle Xuan Luo that focused on power the most. In the end, he couldn’t even move the Emperor Supreme Rock.

The Emperor Supreme Rock is so sturdy?

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, do you really think the Holy Crystal will be easily destroyed? This is such a joke. Forget about yourself, even if the strongest Emperor Bai in Eternal Chaotic World came personally, he absolutely couldn’t destroy the Holy Crystal. No one could,” Ling Zong laughed hysterically and the other Great Emperors looked at him with disdain as well.

The Emperor Supreme Rock could endure such terrifyingly boundless pure energy, its sturdiness was naturally unbelievable.

It was already difficult to destroy a nail-sized Emperor Supreme Rock, let alone the Emperor Supreme Rock that was a hundred zhang tall. It was almost impossible for an expert in this era to do that.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave when he heard Ling Zong’s comment.

He performed Blast Rainstorm with his all but he hadn’t managed to leave any mark on the Emperor Supreme Rock. Even if he were to perform his strongest trump card, the secret skill of Star Palace, to increase his power by a hundred times, he might not have been able to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock.

Most importantly, he was able to slash the Emperor Supreme Rock as there was no one who had stopped him earlier. But then, Ling Zong and a few other Great Emperors rushed over and they wouldn’t give Jian Wushuang another chance to hit the Emperor Supreme Rock.

“Humph. Even if I can’t destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock, I will destroy the surrounding formation.

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold and the sword intention he carried soared up.

He wielded his sword and his sword light was aimed at the golden whirlpool surrounding them.

The golden whirlpool connected the Emperor Supreme Rock with the dark millstone. If he could destroy it completely, it would be enough to stop the dark millstone.

Jian Wushuang’s sword intention soared and the others naturally saw through his plan at the first instant.

“Stop him!!”

Ling Zong roared and transformed into a beast to leap at Jian Wushuang.

The other Great Emperors took action against Jian Wushuang as well.

At the same time, the Great Emperors who had been stopped by Great Emperor Zhi Luo outside the golden whirlpool earlier rushed over after Great Emperor Zhi Luo passed away. They met with Ling Zong and the others. In the end, the thirteen Great Emperors gathered together to besiege Jian Wushuang again.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were continuous bangs in the golden whirlpool. Every bang was followed by a large amount of power and hit the surrounding golden whirlpool.

Jian Wushuang was in the middle of the golden whirlpool after all. When they fought there, the impact that they caused would affect the stability of the golden whirlpool. On top of that, Jian Wushuang seized every chance he got to attack the surrounding void with his sword lights. The energy that moved around in the golden whirlpool vibrated within.

“Sh*t,” Ling Zong’s face grew grave.

By then, the Great Emperors under the lead of the tall and sturdy middle-aged man rushed to the battlefield and met with Ling Zong.

“Let’s take action together. Stop him from attacking the great formation in the golden whirlpool,” Ling Zong roared.

The thirteen Great Emperors took action simultaneously. Even though Jian Wushuang had shockingly powerful defense power that was enough to last the attack of thirteen Great Emperors, he was completely suppressed. He couldn’t damage the surrounding great formation or the spacetime.

There were many experts that had gathered in the void outside the golden whirlpool. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They were watching the shocking war in the middle of the golden whirlpool attentively.

Everyone could tell that Jian Wushuang was cornered in a hopeless situation. He was merely fighting back like a cornered beast.

“Humph. Although this person has terrifying defense power, his power isn’t invincible after all. He has to space to struggle against the thirteen leaders from Imperial Cabinet.”

“It seems that he was only stronger in terms of taking hits. No matter how great his defense power is, he will reach his limit under constant besiegement. At that time, he can only meet a dead end.”

“He’s dead!”

“He will let the thirteen leaders hem him in for so long. He should be proud even if he dies.”

The cultivators sighed. No one thought Jian Wushuang would survive at the current stage.

He was mostly fighting back like a cornered beast.

However, no one noticed that Jian Wushuang’s eyes were extremely cold, even though he behaved rather crazily.

At the situation that looked hopeless, Jian Wushuang was even calmer, his thoughts were even more organized, and he was even clearer in judgment.

“I’ll play a bet!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and there was determination in them.
