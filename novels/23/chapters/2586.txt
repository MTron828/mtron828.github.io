“Miss Xin’er, how long has the Territorial Lord been fishing there?” Cang Heng asked.

“It has been many days. Is there something urgent for Commander Cang Heng to come in such a hurry? Shall I wake Master up?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“No, although something came up, it’s nothing too urgent. Let’s just wait a little longer,” suggested Cang Heng.

Xiao Tiexin slightly nodded.

All of them could observe that though Jian Wushuang seemed to be fishing, he had closed his eyes in apparent meditation.

they would not dare to disturb Jian Wushuang unless it was something urgent since he was in a state of meditation for enlightenment.

Half an hour passed since they waited.

Finally, Jian Wushuang who was in the middle of the lake battered his eyelids. He suddenly lifted his right hand which was holding the fishing rod while tracing a special and weird drawing in the void. After that, a two-meter-long Snow Scomber fish dropped into the water. All of that was done in a smooth and slick movement.

The weirdest part was the complete lack of movement when such a big Snow Scomber fish was caught out of water. Not even a ripple.

The fish was caught and dropped into the fish basket which looked small but it was spacious inside. Jian Wushuang retracted the fishing rod and only then did the lake’s surface popped with water splashing everywhere and created big ripples.

“Is that...an illusion of space-time?”

Both Xiao Tiexin and Cang Heng who was waiting quietly on the empty ground not far away were shocked to see the scene.

They could see when the Snow Scomber fish was caught ashore, the lake’s movement should have happened at the same time, but Jian Wushuang delayed the movement and caused it to happen one after another. It was caused by the power of space-time.

“The Territorial Lord’s perception of the Space-time Law is getting better and better!” Cang Heng exclaimed.

“Indeed. It’s not only his perception of Space-time Law but also many other aspects. Master is getting stronger and better at an astonishing speed,” said Xiao Tiexin.

She had been around Jian Wushuang. Although Jian Wushuang had not taken action in recent years, she could still sense Jian Wushuang’s improving strength.

Jian Wushuang stood up while holding the fishing rod and fish basket with the Snow Scomber fish. He slowly stepped across the lake and walked towards the two.

Xiao Tiexin and Cang Heng both had their eyes on Jian Wushuang. From their point of view, Jian Wushuang seemed to be just an ordinary person and did not exude an aura nor gave any special impressions.

However, the two were more horrified by how ordinary he appeared.

A few years ago, they could vaguely see through Jian Wushuang’s power and were able to judge his strength. They were still able to read how much stronger Jian Wushuang was compared to them at that time.

However... They could no longer see absolutely anything.

Jian Wushuang was like an unfathomable ball of mist.

Finally, Jian Wushuang walked to the shore and faced the two of them.

“Territorial Lord.” Cang Heng respectfully saluted.

“Commander Cang Heng, are you here to see me for something?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Something has happened and it’s out of the Official Army’s control. That’s the reason I’m here to request the Master to come along,” said Cang Heng.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew of the Official Army’s combat powers. Ten Official Army battalions had a total of 10,000 soldiers. If they were well-organized, a single battalion was enough to even suppress a Primary-level Ultimate God. If two or three battalions worked together at the same time, even an ordinary High-level Earth Ultimate God would want to escape.

Their combat power was terrifying.

On normal occasions, the Official Army would be the one handling the crisis if there was any disorder or commotion in Northern Darkstar Territory.

However...

“What’s the matter that even the Official Army can’t handle it?” Jian Wushuang peeked around at them.

“This happened in Qinhuo Wilderness. Not long ago, a mysterious expert appeared in Qinhuo Wilderness, used extremely cruel methods to annihilate several cities, and killed a large number of cultivators. I heard those sects in Qinhuo Wilderness were frightened and immediately sent experts to kill that mysterious man. The sects formed a strong lineup of extremely powerful experts.

“However, those experts were defeated by him alone with more than ninety percent of them died in the end. There were four Primary-level Ultimate Gods among them! There’s no sign of him stopping after that.”

Cang Heng wore a solemn expression and said, “The powerful sects of Qinhuo Wilderness knew that their sects combined power is unable to kill the demon. Therefore, they sent a message to ask for the Official Army’s help. We believe that man is probably someone mighty at the Peak Ultimate God so we did not take it lightly and sent two battalions to kill him, but the two commanders just sent a message today...

“The two commanders said that the demon’s strength has reached the Earth Ultimate God realm for some reason and is extremely clever with his combat techniques. He avoids facing head-on with the Official Army, hence the Official Army can’t do anything to him nor can they stop his killing spree. That’s why the Official Army sent a message to request more help.

“I thought that it was strange after I received the news.”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly upon listening to Cang Heng. He said after some time, “It’s indeed weird not only about the part of him killing so many cultivators but also his cultivation realm was being a mystery. If I’m not mistaken, the sects initially notice he isn’t that powerful when they attack him. The Official Army probably also thought the same and probably thought that they had the capabilities to handle him.

“Before the Official Army started, they thought the opponent was just a Peak Ultimate God, but the opponent has reached the Earth Ultimate God level. Besides, he’s extremely clever with his attack...which made it abnormal. The strangest part is the fact that we know almost nothing about the demon including his origins.”

“That’s right, we don’t know how to deal with him so I’m to see Master,” Cang Heng solemnly agreed.

Jian Wushuang groaned for a moment before saying, “If that’s the case go with me to the Qinhuo Wilderness now.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Territorial Lord, you want to personally go?” Cang Heng was quite surprised.

“The Qinhuo Wilderness is within Northern Darkstar Territory’s control. I cannot sit and do nothing as the Territorial Lord when there’s such a big commotion. Besides, the demon’s strength is so terrifying that I’m afraid that even the Official Army is unable to handle him.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Xin’er, come with me too. We have been in this Territorial Lord Mansion for ten years. It’s time to go out for a walk.”

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin nodded.

Jian Wushuang, Xiao Tiexin, and Cang Heng thereafter headed toward the Qinhuo Wilderness.
