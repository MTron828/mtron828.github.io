Chapter 5140 - 5140: Leave the Rest to Me

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The clash of the axe and the long staff resounded through the air. After several flashes of mysterious runes on the brown staff, it couldn’t hold on any longer. It flew out of the hands of the young monk, devoid of the empowering runes. Without those runes, the staff was just a hard stick; only with the runes could it be considered a treasure.

The young monk, unarmed, didn’t retreat in the face of the giant axe. Astonishingly, he caught it with his bare hands.

Hiss…

The sound of the blood axe tearing through flesh echoed, and the young monk gritted his teeth, his face pale. His eyes radiated a fierce determination, and finally, blood trickled from between his clenched teeth. His body couldn’t bear it anymore.

“Kind Sir,” the young samanera struggled to utter these words through his clenched teeth. Then, he managed a faint smile and hoarsely continued, “l am going to follow my master’s footsteps. Kind Sir, take care!”

After saying this, the young monk, disregarding his injuries, surged with energy again. Countless cracks appeared on his body, and Xiang Binyun’s eyes trembled violently. He knew this young monk was about to self-destruct.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, drawing in a primordial Qi, and his eyes snapped open.

The moment his eyes opened, his aura began to rise. An ancient and powerful energy radiated from him, it was the power of the Extreme Dao,

Smack!

In a flash, Jian Wushuang was by the young monks side. He lightly patted his shoulder, then with a punch, he sent the blood axe and Xiang Binyun flying.

“Don’t worry, it’s not over yet. Leave the rest to me!” Jian Wushuang comforted softly, then infused his own Yan power into the young samanera’s crumbling divine body.

Golden rays of light bathed the young monk’s deteriorating form. Quickly, they repaired his broken divine body. However, he would need to recover the energy consumed within himself.

“Kind Sir, you can’t!” The young samanera wanted to resist, after all, there were still strong enemies around. How could he let Jian Wushuang help him recover his injuries?

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “It’s alright. You stabilize your realm and restore your strength here. I’ll handle him.”

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang swiftly moved, seizing the moment before Xiang Bingyun could steady himself. With a swift motion, the tattered divine sword on his back was drawn once again.

As the divine sword unsheathed, a dazzling light burst forth. Despite its cracked blade, it was infused with the Ultimate Dao, capable of cleaving the heavens with terrifying power, even a tree branch could become a weapon of devastating might under such influence.

Puff!

“How… how dare you!” Xiang Bingyun’s voice trembled as he muttered. Although his body hadn’t yet stabilized, seeing Jian Wushuangs strike, he quickly twisted his form. However, the power in that strike was overwhelming; it tore through his flesh, severing his arm, which now floated silently in the void.

This was not just a physical injury; the previous strike had also contained Heart power. Now, he coughed up brownish blood, his heart sinking. His previously calm state of mind shattered, causing his strength to diminish by a third.

Shaking, Xiang Bingyun coughed violently and wiped the blood from his mouth, his voice trembling. “How could you… How could you recover so quickly? Your divine body was on the verge of breaking, yet you’ve healed in less than an incense stick’s worth of time. Even a second-grade Great Dao wouldn’t allow such swift recovery.”

In his eyes, even if Jian Wushuang was an unparalleled genius from some world, having comprehended a second-grade Great Dao, he couldn’t possibly recover so rapidly.

As per the understanding of Dao from the Ancient Era, similar to Jian Wushuangs analysis, Dao was categorized into five levels. Xiang Bingyun’s mention of the ‘Great Dao’ referred to the second level.

He himself possessed a third-grade Great Dao, bestowed upon him by the former master of the Heavenly Court. Abandoning his initial common Dao, he inherited this third-grade Great Dao. Through his achievements during the

Ancient Era, he ascended to become a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, highly valued by the contemporary Heavenly Court. Although the probability of successfully merging dao was small, if he succeeded, he would possess the power of a second-tier Emperor. By controlling a world, he could advance further to become a third-tier Emperor.

This had always been his pursuit. Despite the third-grade Great Dao not being rare in the universe, during the Ancient Era, he was still considered a disciple of a certain sect and had been a stunning genius, admired by many. But now, compared to Jian Wushuang and the young monk, he was just an ordinary Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal with mediocre strength.

Jian Wushuang was a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, and the young monk was already almost a Nine Revolutions due to his understanding of zen. A Three Revolutions and a Six Revolutions were able to contend with a

Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal for several breaths.

Especially considering Jian Wushuangs current state as a Three Revolutions

Grand Yan Immortal, he was able to injure Xiang Bingyun with a single strike. Although Xiang Bingyun’s strength hadn’t reached its peak at the moment, achieving such remarkable results, not to mention in a certain high-level world, was something that even the Emperor’s sons in some of the superpowers in the universe would find difficult to achieve.

Xiang Bingyun’s state of mind was shattered, and he began to contemplate retreat.

He dared not continue the fight. If that little monks strength fully recovered, he alone might not be a match for these two.

Jian Wushuangs eyes turned ice-cold. His previous strike had completely depleted the Heart power he had just gained. Although Xiang Bingyun’s strength had decreased by a third, in a direct confrontation, he was still not a match.

“It’s my turn to fight you now!” Although he wasn’t a match, he desperately craved that sense of crisis. Only in such perilous situations could he become stronger.

For him, advancing from the Three Revolutions to the Six Revolutions posed no real obstacles. He could sense the Dao. As long as he kept fighting, it wouldn’t be long before he advanced to the Six Revolutions.

At that point, his Thought power and Heart power would also skyrocket.

Heart power was akin to the scabbard of the Ultimate Sword Dao. Nurtured by Heart power, his Ultimate Sword Dao advanced rapidly.

As long as he could become stronger, he would keep fighting!

Life extended infinitely because of battle.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void, his hair rising without wind. His aura kept climbing. At this moment, his mind was as calm as still water, focused only on his thoughts.

“You two are insane!” Xiang Bingyun’s eye twitched incessantly. Not only were these two powerful, but they were also crazily reckless. Was this what true geniuses were like?

It seemed that back in the day, Zhen Wuyang had similarly fought his way through the ancient era and stood out.

“Damn it, I was defeated by Zhen Wuyang back then, and now 1 can’t even kill one of his Princes.” A murderous intent engulfed Xiang Bingyun’s face. The damage to his state of mind had loosened his will, and endless resentment had nowhere to vent.

This was the importance of one’s state of mind. Although most cultivators couldn’t develop Heart power, if they usually maintained a stable state of heart, even without Heart power, they could fear no Heart power cultivator. In their future cultivation, they could calmly face various dangers. This was the benefit of a stable state of heart..
