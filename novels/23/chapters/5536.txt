Chapter 5535 ¬†Qingniao Hall

The ones with good aptitude had long entered those major sects.

They were the ones sifted out, possessing only mediocre aptitude.

In the eyes of the Emperor's strong, they were a bunch of fools. Who would teach a fool to speak?

Jian Wushuang, however, displayed a surprised expression and readily handed over 60 godstones.

"Well done, that's the way! Opportunities like this are rare!" The man in the brocade robe accepted Jian Wushuang's godstones, revealed a smile, and then tossed two jade slips to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took them and left the city with Gong Miaoyi.

According to the information from the jade slips, they needed to travel 300,000 miles out of the city, where the Qingniao Hall would be waiting.

Before leaving, Jian Wushuang didn't forget to ask about the departure time.

According to the other party, only about 90 percent of the people had gathered now.

However, due to the halt in the teleportation array, many powerful Dao Lords with strong backgrounds would also come to ride the flying treasures.

Of course, the term 'strong background' was relative to them.

Jian Wushuang had seen truly powerful geniuses, those with attendants like Emperor's servants, even if there was no teleportation array, they had their own flying treasures.

There was no need to squeeze with a group of people.

For Dao Lords, 300,000 miles were not far at all.

The two of them arrived outside the Qingniao Hall leisurely.

At this moment, there were hundreds of powerful individuals gathered here.

Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised.

A flying treasure capable of carrying at least a thousand people, and yet they were all waiting outside?

Upon inquiring closer, he learned that the Emperor powerhouse inside was resting, and they would only set out when he allowed the Dao Lords like them to enter.

Jian Wushuang was indifferent to this and found an open space to sit down and wait patiently.

However, some disciples from various sects were quite indignant.

"Hmph, just a tier 2 Emperor, what's with the pretense? My master, a tier 3 Emperor, doesn't make such a big deal!" A man exuding the peak aura of a Dao Lord couldn't help but scoff.

A tier 2 Emperor was the lowest level among Emperors in the Four Great Secret Realms. Despite this, they were unattainable figures in the eyes of these Dao Lords.

Especially for wandering cultivators with no background, offending an Emperor meant death regardless of the opponent's strength.

"Whatever, we won't have to wait long!"

Some sect disciples were indifferent to the situation.

This was the advantage of having a background; even if the opponent was an Emperor, they wouldn't dare to act recklessly.

In the following days, some wandering cultivators arrived one after another.

The number reached a thousand.

Normally, at this point, they would have left. However, due to the teleportation array being down, they had to wait a bit longer to gather more people.

Since it was a one-way trip, and many wanted to go to the Giant Gate City on the other side, it was like having two opportunities at once.

Roughly estimating, the round trip alone could earn at least 50,000 godstones.

This was a huge profit!

50,000 godstones were enough to buy a flying treasure.

Of course, this involved significant risks.

If the journey was intercepted halfway, the losses would be considerable.

People might even lose their lives.

Moreover, the round trip, including the waiting time, took about ten years.

Maintaining a high level of vigilance for a decade was no easy task.

A month later.

A group of dozens of people descended, and for them, the day to leave had finally arrived.

These individuals seemed not to be wandering cultivators but disciples of a sect.

They wore uniform attire, and their auras were quite similar.

"All attention, set out after one stick of incense!"

The one shouting was not the man in the brocade robe from earlier within the city.

In transactions like these, one person couldn't handle it alone.

There were many intricacies involved.

The man in the brocade robe was only responsible for promotion.

There were others handling navigation behind the scenes.

As the crowd entered the Qingniao Hall, they discovered that besides the main hall, there were also sealed chambers separated by space.

They were just not open yet.

The owner of the Qingniao Hall, upon seeing the crowd enter, revealed a slight smile and then said, "Fellow Daoists, due to the teleportation array, the number of participants this time is a bit high, but the chambers are limited and simply not enough!"

"Not enough?"

Someone furrowed their brows.

Without enough chambers, were they supposed to stand around waiting?

With so many people gathered together, how were they supposed to cultivate without chambers?

Cultivation was a highly private matter. Even if they trusted each other, there were others who might not.

"Brother Qingniao, are all these chambers already occupied?" someone asked.

Qingniao, wearing a light blue robe, stood above the main hall and laughed, saying, "Don't worry, there are indeed some chambers available. It's just that with so many people here, deciding who gets a chamber and who stays here is quite troublesome for me!"

"Troublesome?" A burly man walked out, clenching his fist and instantly releasing a powerful aura, shouting, "Then let strength speak!"

"No!" Qingniao stopped the man, and his own aura also burst forth, approaching the level of an Emperor.

Feeling the oppressive force, the burly man had no choice but to step back.

"If we really do that, and word gets out, how can I, Qingniao, face others?" Qingniao, hands behind his back, wore an expression of difficulty.

At this moment, someone suggested, "Brother Qingniao, why not raise the price? Those willing to pay more can go to the chambers, and those unwilling can stay here!"

As soon as the suggestion was made, many people agreed.

Originally averse to raising prices, those who had arrived first and entered a chamber for just 5 godstones couldn't even curse in secret before rushing over.

Jian Wushuang, in a corner, sneered, secretly admiring the other party's methods. This way, they would inexplicably earn a large number of godstones.

It could be said that he was insatiable.

He and Gong Miaoyi could go anywhere, and they didn't care about it.

Among a group of Dao Lords, there was nothing to fear. Could it be that the other party could discern his identity?

Perhaps these people didn't even know about the bounty on him.

After all, the disparity was too great.

Those who dared to capture him were the strong among the tier 6 Emperors; even tier 5 Emperors did not have the qualifications.

As the proposal was approved, the first to enter the secret room were the disciples of various sects. These people were not primarily concerned about money. If the teleportation array hadn't stopped, they wouldn't have been here.

It was a waste of time to rush on the road for several years.

With this time, they could explore some dangerous places and harvest treasures, not just dozens of godstones.

The weakest among these sect disciples were Half-Step Emperors, and there were even some who rivaled Emperors in strength.

They could be considered the pride of heaven. Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

As the sect disciples left, the number of people in the main hall quickly thinned out.

Some strong wanderers, who were not short of godstones, also entered the secret room.

The remaining majority had either insufficient strength or tight budgets.

Among them was an old man, thin as dry wood, tremblingly supported by a young person as they entered the secret room.

Just a glance, and Jian Wushuang and Gong Miaoyi chose to close their eyes and rest in a corner.
