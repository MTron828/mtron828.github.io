Chapter 1209: Do the best

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Silence!

The whole Battle Fortress fell into silence.

Everyone looked at what had happened in front of them with horrified expressions on their faces and they felt scared about the space storm which had spread over tens of thousands of miles far. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Too strong, they are too strong!”

Many cultivators felt their throats getting dry.

Except for Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, and a few high-level experts, even those Palace Masters who had newly become Universe Masters with the help of the Nirvana Elixirs felt frightened and panic.

Although they were Universe Masters just like the two combatants, either Jian Wushuang or Long Xu King was far more powerful than any of them.

“No, Jian Wushuang is at a disadvantage.” Samsara Temple Master said as his pupils contracted.

The other Palace Masters concentrated their attention on the battle as well.

As expected, when the two unique skills were unleashed in a head-to-head battle, Jian Wushuang was obviously the underdog. He rolled backward under the attack of the blood shadow.

“Haha, let’s continue!”

Long Xu King’s crazy laugh resound through this space. Although he was affected by the impact of the clash, he just stopped for a short while before launching another attack again.

However, Jian Wushuang was still retreating. Before he regained his balance again,Long Xu King had arrived in front of him.

“Blood Mountain Dao!”

Long Xu King screamed and his figure descended from the sky like an eagle. He brandished his blood-red saber again.

This strike was of great momentum. His saber turned into a huge blood-red mountain that came crushing down upon Jian Wushuang with great strength and horrible pressure.

Hum~~~Under the pressure of the saber shadow, Jian Wushuang felt that all of his bones were going to be crushed.

“Is it another unique skill?”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Long Xu King indeed had incredibly powerful strength given that he had defeated three Invincible Universe Masters before. Surprisingly, he was even able to create two unique skills by himself.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted. Since he had not stood firmly, he did not have enough time to use his Dawn Light to resist his opponent’s attack. The only thing he could do was to hold his Blood Mountain Sword up high.

Clang!

A muffled sound rang out as an overwhelming and mighty power came crushing down upon Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s body shook and he let out a muffled voice. Then, he fell to the ground like a falling stone.

Bomb!

There was a huge sinkhole with a 1,000-mile radius appeared on the ground where Jian Wushuang’s body landed. It was bottomless and was at least hundreds of feet deep.

The expressions of the Green Fire World experts in the Battle Fortress changed as they saw the scene.

Long Xu King was still quietly floating in the Void above the fortress, looking down the hole below.

“Trash!”

He shouted in a cold voice.

“My monarch said you’re a genius. Now, however, you’re nothing in my eyes!”

“You’ve barely risen into the Invincible Universe Master Level. As such, you’re much weaker than the three Invincible Universe Masters I’ve met before.”

“I was thinking that you should be a good opponent. Jian Wushuang, you totally fail me!”

Long Xu King’s ironic words echoed around this space. Upon hearing his words, the faces of the experts from the Green Fire World turned pale.

Right at this moment… Bang!

Suddenly, a horrible blast of Sword Essence burst out from the bottom of that sinkhole. A figure flew out directly and showed up in front of Long Xu King again.

With a blob of blood left on the corner of his mouth, Jian Wushuang was in a sorry fashion. However, his aura had not weakened.

“Long Xu King.” Jian Wushuang said while looking at him.

“Huh?” Long Xu King looked indifferent.

“It seems that I have thought too much of you. You have unleashed all your skills, haven’t you?” Jian Wushuang shook his head and sighed.

“What?” Long Xu King’s eyes looked cold.

Just now, he considered Jian Wushuang as a trash who had failed him. Now, however, Jian Wushuang satirized his strength on the contrary.

“Boy, can you only win by your words?” Long Xu King snorted.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang laughed and continued, “You’ll know that soon enough.”

When he was speaking, the power of the Blood Mountain Sword he held enhanced a little bit.

“Jian Wushuang, you finally intend to go to any length?” Gu King’s voice suddenly sounded.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled and answered, “I need to win this challenge, in a smooth and neat way. By this, the morale of the experts in our Green Fire World can skyrocket again.”

“But I didn’t know Long Xu King’s true strength before. Therefore, it was too difficult for me to defeat him decently.”

“Now, however, I have figured out what he is capable of. Thus, it’s time for me to show him my true strength.”

Jiang Wushuang was chatting with Gu King in his mind, but his eyes turned extremely cold.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and dashed outward.

“Ridiculous! I’ll see what you can do!” Long Xu King’s eyes turned grim and he moved forward swiftly as well.

Right at the moment when he was about to crash into Jian Wushuang, he brandished his blood-red saber again.

“Blood Fire Dao!”

The blade light landed as blood-red flames covered the whole sky. For a second, the Void with a 1,— miles radius turned into a sea of fire.

Long Xu King, however, was the dominator of the sea of fire.

“Is it still a unique skill?”?Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows.

Long Xu King had displayed two unique skills before, and now he unleashed the third one.

It was really awesome for a Universe Master to create three unique skills.

“No matter how many unique skills you have created, they are of the same power!” Jian Wushuang sneered and lifted the Blood Mountain Sword.

The whole area fell into darkness once again.

As expected, it was also the Dawn Light.

When he saw the scene, a touch of disdain flashed through Long Xu King’s eyes.

He had experienced this blow just now. Though it was an authentic unique skill, its power was really ordinary.

Each one of the three unique skills he had created could outclass Jian Wushuang’s in terms of power.

“The same person employs the same swordsmanship will lead the same result!”

Long Xu King shouted. The raging blood-red fire suddenly formed into a huge wave, rolling toward Jian Wushuang madly.

Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang’s mouth twisted in a contemptuous sneer.

When he activated the Dawn Light swordsmanship, the abundant Ancient God Power inside his body was totally unleashed.

Jian Wushuang activated the Four-star Ancient God Power with the aid of his Spiritual Power. The most important was that he aroused the power of Stage Two Blood-killing Plate Armor at the same time.

Of course, when fighting against Long Xu King previously, he had only triggered its Stage One power. But now, he did his best.

It seemed that there was only a slight difference between the Stage One power and the Stage Two’s, in fact, it enabled Jian Wushuang to exert a power that was ten times more powerful than his original one.

Therefore, when Jian Wushuang unleashed the Dawn Light swordsmanship with all his strength, its power became several times greater than the last time!
