Chapter 898: Plenilune Centipede

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Once he obtained the Ancient God Essence Blood of Jian Wushuang, the Witch King shot a curious look at Jian Wushuang with his enormous eyes. Then, myriads of mysterious cracks started to appear on the Witch King’s gigantic body.

Each of those cracks was unfathomable to Jian Wushuang.

The mysterious cracks covered the Witch King’s body. Then, the Witch King opened his mouth and swallowed down the drop of Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God Essence Blood.

“Kid, brace yourself.”

The Witch King shouted. As these words faded, his large body with a huge hideous head on the top dashed towards Jian Wushuang. Without giving Jian Wushuang any time to react, it crashed into Jian Wushuang.

However, to Jian Wushuang’s shock, when the Witch King’s body collided with his, he did not feel any impact. Instead, the Witch King’s body actually entered into his.

“This...this...”

Jian Wushuang felt his brain was jammed. He stared at the scene, totally at a loss.

There was nothing he could do but watch the Witch King’s huge body pour into his.

Soon, the Witch King’s island-sized body had completely vanished out of sight.

At the same time, a mysterious scarlet crack, one that looked quite complex, emerged on Jian Wushuang’s right arm.

“Blood Mountain.” A vigorous voice sounded from Jian Wushuang’s insides.

“Senior Witch King, what are you doing?” Jian Wushuang was utterly astonished.

“From this day on, you’re my new master. There’s no need to call me senior any longer, just Witch King.” The Witch King said, his tone appeared to be friendlier.

“New master? What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang still did not fully understand what was happening.

“As I told you before, I am Plenilune Centipede!”

“Plenilune is the name of my population.”

The Witch King began to explain the situation.

“The clan I belong to is called the Plenilune Clan. Human cultivators also address the Plenilune as Plenilune Worm Beast!”

“The Plenilune is born with an Ancient God and relies on the Ancient God’s blood to survive and grow. You can perceive the Plenilune as a kind of parasitic beast!”

“Anyway, the Plenilune Clan is destined to serve the Ancient God Clan since they were born. For the Ancient God Clan, the Plenilune Clan is their close ally.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was taken aback. It had occurred to him that when he was staying in the Ancient God Clan, he saw many Ancient Gods carrying worm beasts just like the Witch King, but they were much smaller. Those Ancient Gods all treated the worm beasts as their brothers.

“Since I was born, I’ve been around my master King Luo Zhen and lived on his blood. As master’s strength kept going up, I grew stronger and stronger. When master became the top Eight-star Ancient God, I also became the Plenilune Centipede in the prime of my life!”

“But later, master met his downfall. I escaped with his Essence Blood of Inheritance and tried to find a suitable successor for him. However, given that I lost the Ancient God that I relied on, I could not survive for long, so I came to the Stellar Fog Sea.”

“The Stellar Fog Sea was created by the founder of the Lineage of Stars. With the magic means he left here, I managed to scrape a living. But I can only exist in the form of an island and cannot move.”

“The slightest of moves will shorten my lifespan.”

“I have remained here and waited for a long time. Finally, you, a man with the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan came to me, but you’re merely a Divine Realm expert...”

“Merely a Divine Realm expert. I never thought you could refine master’s Essence Blood. Master’s Essence Blood was in my stomach. To give you an opportunity to refine it, I would have to make a significant move, which would dent my lifespan. Thus, I attempted to persuade you to give up.”

“But to my surprise, your consciousness is so powerful that you actually made it!”

Speaking of this, the Witch King also sounded a bit thrilled.

“Now, you’ve refined master’s Essence Blood of Inheritance, so you’re the successor of my master. And as I have accomplished all tasks left to me by my master. The next thing I have to do is find a new Ancient God to rely on and survive with his blood. You, the successor of my master, are naturally the perfect candidate.”

“Therefore, from now on, you’re my new master. I’ll live in your body, feed on your Ancient God blood.”

“That explains it.” Hearing the Witch King out, Jian Wushuang nodded and now had a general idea of the whole event.

“The Plenilune is a kind of parasitic beast that only feeds on the blood of an Ancient God.”

Over the past years, the Witch King failed to find any Ancient God to rely on, so he could only turn into an island and has since struggled to survive with the help of the unique features of this Stellar Fog Sea.

Now that he had become the successor of that King Luo Zhen, the Witch King finally completed his mission. Hence, the Witch King picked him as his new master and expected to live on his blood.

Realizing all the things that had occurred, Jian Wushuang gave an unbidden wry smile.

When the Witch King picked him as his new master, the Witch King did not ask for his approval.

At the thought of this large worm beast living in his body from now on, Jian Wushuang could not help but feel chills climbing up his spine.

Then, Jian Wushuang asked the Witch King a few more questions, such as how to communicate with him.

After learning everything he should know, Jian Wushuang reluctantly accepted that he had become the Witch King’s master.

At this point, Lord Spirit Sound, who had stood in the Void nearby and watched all this quietly the whole time, approached him.

“Blood Mountain, congratulations.”

Lord Spirit Sound stared at Jian Wushuang. She had witnessed everything that had taken place.

“The reason that I took you here was that I hoped you could have a try since you carry the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan. But who knew that you really obtained the supreme treasure that the king left behind. How blessed you are, tut, tut...”

Jian Wushuang smiled.

Although being recognized as the new master of the Witch King made Jian Wushuang a little overwhelmed, he had also successfully gained the Essence Blood of Inheritance that Eight-star Imperial God left behind, which was indeed a great fortune.

“Well, I have already given you three opportunities. Now, you may leave the Stellar Fog Sea.” Lord Spirit Sound said.

At this, Jian Wushuang’s brows furrowed slightly and he asked, “Lord Spirit Sound, I have a some friends on this Star Island. I wonder if I can...” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But before Jian Wushuang could finish his words, Lord Spirit Sound cut him off.

“I know what you’re going to say. I’m sorry. The rule is the rule. It was established by the founder of the Lineage of Stars. Even I have no right to change it. Thus, if anyone on the Star Island wants to leave, he has to pass the three tests in the Black Tower and become a disciple of the Lineage of Stars. If he can’t meet this requirement, he will be trapped on this Star Island forever.”

Lord Spirit Sound’s voice sounded quite callous.
