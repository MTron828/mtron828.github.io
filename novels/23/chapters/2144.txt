Chapter 2145 Not Enough!

Ba Su had morphed into a golden bat once again, his eyes filled with bloodlust.“The opportunity Three Emperors World has not only allowed me to master Rules of Order, it has increased my soul power tremendously as well. I even learned a strong Soul Attack secret skill and obtained a Soul Attack treasure from the Three Emperors World!”

“With my soul power, along with the Sky Swallowing Clan’s Soul Attack, the secret skill, and the treasure, is unparalleled against anyone below Third Stage Great Emperors!”

“This Jian Wushuang exposed his weakness to me both times that I fought against him: his soul!”

“His soul is not strong, with a Soul Attack strong enough it’ll ignore his self-defence mechanism and kill him instantly!”

“This move I’m about to make… will definitely kill him! Jian Wushuang, prepare to die!”

The frenzied Ba Su was absolutely confident in his Soul Attack skills.

He had heard of Jian Wushuang’s self-defence mechanism. Decades ago, when he just had Second Stage fighting powers, he was able to face Demon King Chen Yu head-on without dying.

His self-defence mechanism had become scarier.

It was impossible to kill Jian Wushuang by material attack alone.

In this world, under the premise of constrictions, no one could do it.

But Soul Attacks could ignore the self-defence mechanism and pierce the opponent’s soul.

Only Soul Attacks could truly kill Jian Wushuang.

Hong!

A terrifying Soul Attack was heading straight for Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted but he darted out instead of retreating.

During his movements, the Soul Attack pierced straight into Jian Wushuang.

“Hngh!” Jian Wushuang led out a weird moan, and his face turned pale.

But his body was not damaged by the attack at all.

The Blood Mountain Sword was already raised high, prepared to strike Ba Su. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“How could this be?”

Ba Su, still in the form of a golden bat, was surprised.

He dared not believe it.

Jian Wushuang had survived his strongest Soul Attack.

Not only did he survive, he also did not seem to have suffered many injuries.

When had Jian Wushuang’s soul defense power become so powerful?

“Idiot, the decisive battle between the Eternal Chaotic World and the Three Emperors World is about to begin. Knowing my soul was my weakness, you thought I would not take precautions?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“What kind of Soul Defense treasure do you possess?” Ba Su could not help but ask.

Jian Wushuang could not be bothered explaining it to him. The Blood Mountain Sword had already fallen.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Blast Rainstorm! !!

This was also the first time that Jian Wushuang went on the offensive against Ba Su.

With the help of Immemorial Celestial Body’s second scroll, Bloodline Power of the Ancient Clan doubled with Sword Principle Xuan Luo’s most powerful move.

This sword move’s power was enough to make any Great Emperor below the Third Stage fall into despair.

“Damn it!”

Ba Su could feel the power of the sword. Immediately, he exerted his means to resist.

Peng!

A loud bang went off. Ba Su’s body was split apart, and a blast of flowing light was released.

The gap in strength and power could be seen immediately.

“Ba Su, you’ve run out of moves. Now, it’s my turn!” Jian Wushuang’s desire to kill was at its peak.

His huge Ancient Clan body started to make its attack.

As he was about to make his move, a huge Space Tunnel appeared from far, at a Void above the Imperial Cabinet.

Several figures stepped out of the Space Tunnel.

There were seven people, all of their strong auras indicative of their Great Emperor levels.

And headed by them, was Demon King Chen Yu!

Demon King Chen Yu had rushed into the Imperial City with six other Great Emperors.

Three of the Great Emperors belonged to the Acheron Palace, the other three were Three Emperors World experts.

As the battle within the Imperial City began, many experts of the Three Emperors World arrived at the battlefield through various channels at Kaiser Blood’s command.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s eyes were fuming with rage, like he was a furious lion.

He looked around the battlefield and saw an ugly sight.

Every corner of the Imperial City had turned into a bloodbath. Countless experts had fallen into the hands of Abysmal Saint Master and the other Great Emperors.

Although the seven Great Emperors have now been stopped by Ling Zong and other Three Emperors World Great Emperors, the slaughter from before was enough to traumatise anyone.

“Jian Wushuang, the eight of you all will die with our fallen!”

Demon King Chen Yu let out a huge scream and headed towards Jian Wushuang.

The six Great Emperors behind him rushed into the battlefield and joined forces with Ling Zong and the other thirteen Great Emperors, fighting fiercely against Abysmal Saint Master, Jian Yi, and the others.

The battle had been elevated to a whole new level.

Jian Wushuang did not have the slightest fear when he saw Demon King Chen Yu coming for him.

“Let’s go!”

“Bring it on!”

Jian Wushuang’s war-fighting spirit had long been ignited, his abilities were at an all-time high.

“Die!”

Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su made their moves at the same time.

Two Third Stage Great Emperors were joining forces against Jian Wushuang!

Even against two enemies, with that almost indestructible unique constitution of his, Jian Wushuang had no fear.

He looked as if he was already in a frenzy fighting against Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su, but deep inside, he had never been calmer.

Deep in his eyes was a light.

“Demon King Chen Yu, Ba Su, two Third Stage Great Emperors!”

“Along with the Great Emperors Abysmal Saint Master and Jian Yi are fighting against, that makes nineteen Great Emperors!”

“There are still a few more Sir Gods and Emperor God experts left in the Imperial City as well.”

“This power…”

Jian Wushuang squinted.

The forces that had gathered in the Imperial City were terrifying.

But it was not enough for Jian Wushuang.

“Not enough! There are not enough experts here!”

“Far from enough! The number of experts here is not enough to devastate the Three Emperors World!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

In his Qian Kun Ring, was the Void Token. He could use the token anytime he wanted.

“Wait! Wait!”

Jian Wushuang could not use it yet.
