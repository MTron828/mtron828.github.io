Chapter 1177: Progress

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Many Warriors on Star Island looked at Jian Wushuang.

For them, 300 years was a short period, so they did not think Jian Wushuang could pass the ultimate test.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “I’m not absolutely certain that I can pass it. It’s only because that I’ve made some breakthroughs over the past 300 years that I come here to give it a shot. I did not expect Lord Spirit Sound to tell you about this.”

“That explains the matter.”

Dao Master Thousand Water said, “You’ve made the right choice. At least you can know how close you are to pass the ultimate test.”

“Well, everybody, I shall take my leave.” Jian Wushuang smiled and once again stepped into the black tower in the eyes of all people here.

They were all waiting outside the black tower and discussing this matter with each other.

“Blood Mountain came out very quickly the last time he entered the black tower. Obviously, there is still a long way for him to go if he wants to pass the test. Even if he has made some breakthroughs over the past 300 years, he probably won’t be able to make it.”

“Yes, it’s unrealistic for him to do that. But he should be able to stay a little longer in the black tower this time!!”

“Yeah, that will be great progress. The longer he stays there, the closer he is to pass the test.”

Time passed slowly in the midst of their discussions.

10 breaths, 20 breaths, 30 breaths… A half quarter of an hour passed.

However, Jian Wushuang still did not walk out of the black tower. This excited all the people present.

Jian Wushuang came out of the black tower after two breaths last time.

“The longer he stays there, the more likely he will pass the test!” Dao Master Thousand Water clenched his hands and his eyes were burning with excitement.

Another half quarter of an hour passed.

Till now, a quarter of an hour had passed.

At this point, Jian Wushuang walked out of the black tower slowly.

“Blood Mountain!”

“Blood Mountain!”

The people waiting outside the black tower immediately rushed forward with an expectant look.

“Sorry, I let you down again.” Jian Wushuang forced out a bitter smile.

“Failed again?” Everyone present felt sorry for that, but they were not so upset as they were last time.

After all, they witnessed Jian Wushuang’s progress.

A significant progress.

“Blood Mountain, you came out after two breaths last time you entered the black tower, but this time you stayed in the tower for so long. Did you nearly pass the test?” Dao Master Thousand Water asked.

Everyone else looked at Jian Wushuang with burning eyes.

“I’ll tell you the truth, guys.” Jian Wushuang looked around. “The ultimate test demands me to defeat a formidable Puppet Fighter. I couldn’t withstand his two blows last time I fought with him. This time, my strength skyrocketed and I was able to compete with him head-on, but I was still at a disadvantage.”

“What matters is that I need to defeat him instead of fighting him. Therefore, there is still a certain gap that lies before me.”

Jian Wushuang was telling the truth.

He had fought hand to hand with the Puppet Fighter who used a Giant Axe in the black tower. Since his strength skyrocketed, the Giant Axe could no longer exert any pressure on him. Armed with his swordsmanships, he was able to fight that Puppet Fighter head-on, but he was the underdog.

After a fierce battle, he knew he could not pass the test, so he came out of the black tower.

After the people present heard his words, their eyes sparkled.

“He was unable to resist two blows last time? But he was just at a disadvantage when he fought the Puppet Fighter head-on this time?”

“How could he achieve such progress over the past 300 years?”

“Haha, if he were given another 300 years, probably it’s the Puppet Fighter who will be the underdog.”

“If he makes progress at this rate, he definitely can pass the ultimate test!”

The Warriors on Star Island were thrilled about that.

If they had only seen a gleam of hope on Jian Wushuang, then, he now represented their best hope.

He made the impossible possible.

“Well, everybody, let’s go.” Dao Master Thousand Water waved his hand and said, “Blood Mountain, just keep cultivating. It’s okay if you can pass the test. Don’t be eager for quick success and instant benefits. We can wait for you even if you need more time.”

After finishing speaking, Dao Master Thousand Water and other people departed.

Jian Wushuang stood outside the black tower and had a strange expression on his face.

“As I expected, my overall strength is equal to that of a Universe Master at the Peak Level after I created the second most powerful Sword Principle and my Ancient God Power reached the Four-star Level. However, the Puppet Fighter in the ultimate test possesses the genuine battle strength of a Universe Master at the Peak Level and is more powerful than me. I was at a disadvantage in the fierce battle, let alone defeat him.”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He had tried his best to improve his strength over the past 300 years, but there was still a huge gap before he could pass the test.

And then… If he wanted to advance his strength by leaps and bounds, it would be extremely difficult. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I cannot find any way to improve the Yin-Yang Sword Principle currently. I have carefully studied the 16 swordsmanships in the Star Jade Wall but did not find any swordsmanship that is similar to it. I don’t know how long I have to wait before I can upgrade it.”

“As for Secret Skills, I cannot promote them either!”

“If there is anything that still has the room for improvement in the short term, that must be… Swordsmanships!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes radiated a sliver of light.

Swordsmanships!

His current swordsmanships were brilliant and powerful, for example, the Heaven’s Bane, the Bladed Surge, and the Death Shadow.

However, with the improvement of his Sword Principles, he was qualified to create a more powerful swordsmanship.

Moreover, although the three sword movements he had created were unique, they only had a single function—attack.

If he could create a mightier, more unique sword movement and perfect his swordsmanships, then his overall strength would be improved drastically.

“Sword Principles and swordsmanships are closely connected to each other. Since my Sword Principles have made a breakthrough, I have to find a way to design a more powerful swordsmanship!”?Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and a plan came into his mind.

He immediately went to find Lord Spirit Sound.

“Lord Spirit Sound, there’s something that I need your help!”
