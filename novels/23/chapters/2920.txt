Chapter 2921: The Heavenly Dao Has Descended!

——

Hearing the cold and arrogant woman’s words, even though she was a shadowy figure, she could not help but feel shocked.

A Divine Master could not even kill a material attack or a soul attack?

A Divine Master could kill eight True Saint-level disciples of her Supreme Emotion Valley with just one sword?

A Divine Master was ten times more powerful than the most influential person she had ever met?

“This man…” The shadowy figure stared at Jian Wushuang with a strange light in her eyes.

“I have no intention of making an enemy of the Supreme Emotion Valley. So let me take Shuang Er with me. From now on, we will not interfere with each other!” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

“You killed eight True Saints of the Supreme Emotion Valley, and you still dare to talk to me like this? What a joke!” The shadowy figure’s voice turned cold. “Die with that disciple of the Supreme Emotion Valley.”

As soon as the shadowy figure finished her words, she attacked.

She pointed with one hand, and the void in front of her penetrated directly. Immediately, a vast, giant finger with a layer of snow-white directly attacked Jian Wushuang.

The moment the giant finger stretched out, it was as if a great snowfall fell from heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank.

He had already sensed the power of this finger.

This finger had already exceeded the scope of the Immortal Saint.

“I have already displayed the pressure of a perfect life-level, and I have also performed the heaven-cleaving skill. The will of heaven should have sensed my existence. If I use it again… the will of heaven will probably lock onto me in an instant!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, but his eyes were fixed on Leng Rushuang, who was quietly floating in the void in front of him. A touch of scarlet suddenly burst out from the depths of his eyes.

“I’ll risk it all for Shuang Er!”

Jian Wushuang let out a fierce shout, but he raised the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand again.

The moment he raised it, the endless pressure from the life-level crazily gathered in the Blood Mountain Sword again.

Heaven-cleaving skill!

Jian Wushuang used it again! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This time, because of his previous experience, its power was even stronger than the sword he used to kill the eight Immortal Saints of the Supreme Emotion Valley.

“Kill!”

The Blood Mountain Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand fell with the pressure from the endless life level.

It was also a vast and majestic sword sea, but it instantly combined and turned into a real heaven-cleaving sword after it swept out.

In front of this sword, even heaven had to retreat.

In the blink of an eye, the heaven-cleaving sword collided with the vast giant finger.

Bang!

This collision was like two realms and two large worlds colliding crazily. The whole world roared and trembled under this collision.

After the collision, the three-meter-tall hazy figure in the void trembled slightly and then took three steps back.

Jian Wushuang also took a few steps back, and the sword light had completely dissipated.

“She forced me to retreat?” The figure was full of disbelief.

She was a rule master!

Even if it was not the original body but a consciousness clone that could only use 10% of its strength, its battle strength was enough to sweep away the saint realm.

But now, she was fighting a Divine Master head-on, and they were evenly matched?

She found it hard to believe, and Jian Wushuang was also very surprised.

“My sword strike gave me the feeling that it was mighty, but this person only came with a consciousness clone, and he blocked my sword strike head-on. The master of rules is so powerful?” Jian Wushuang was also praising it in his heart.

Both of them were shocked.

However, just as they were shocked…

“Look, look at the sky!” An expert from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion exclaimed.

Everyone present, including the kneeling experts, raised their heads with difficulty and looked up at the sky. When they saw it, they were stunned.

They saw that the sky above had long changed color. Previously, there were only a large number of dark clouds sweeping over from all directions, but now, the dark clouds were filled with rolling thunderbolts. These thunderbolts flickered crazily, and in the blink of an eye, they had already formed a vast lightning sea.

This lightning sea was not formed by the divine power or special power of the cultivator himself.

It was purely formed by nature. This was a vast lightning sea of heaven and earth.

In the middle of the lightning sea, numerous dark purple thunderbolts as thick as buckets were dancing wildly. Each of these dark purple thunderbolts caused the numerous experts below, including the Immortal Saints, to feel fear and trepidation in their hearts.

Without any warning, two of the dark purple thunderbolts collided with each other. This collision did not create too much movement, but there were threads of electric arcs that scattered out. These threads of dark purple electric arcs… they suddenly descended from the void above. The first thing they did was to descend onto the sect protecting great formation around the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s sect protecting formation was one of the greatest things that the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had relied on over the long years.

No one had been able to blast open this great formation for so many years forcefully.

But now, as this dark purple lightning bolt descended, boom!

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s sect protecting formation let out a violent rumble. After that, the entire great formation collapsed, completely disintegrating. The divine power that filled the sky also spread out wildly in all directions

The sect-protecting formation, which the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had relied on for so many years, actually collapsed?

“The sect-protecting formation collapsed?”

“How, how is this possible?”

“Even the Immortal Saint, whose strength is incomparably terrifying, wouldn’t be able to shake this formation even if he used all his strength. But now, just a wisp of lightning from the sea of lightning could directly destroy the sect-protecting formation. Just how terrifying is the power contained within that sea of lightning?”

Inside and outside the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, countless experts were highly shocked, their faces filled with terror.

In the sky above, rumbles sounded out one after another. This was the roar of the heavens and earth, the roar of the heavens!

A terrifying might madly crushed down, wanting to annihilate everything.

“This is the will of the Heavenly Dao!”

The hazy figure was the most knowledgeable. When he saw the sea of thunder, he immediately reacted.

“It’s the will of the Heavenly Dao, and it’s very obvious that it’s coming for him!” The hazy figure looked at Jian Wushuang, but his heart was filled with great waves.

“This kid is just a Divine Master, but the will of the Heavenly Dao suppressed him?”

“He, he defied the Heavenly Dao?”

The hazy figure roared in his heart.

The will of the Heavenly Dao controlled the Heavenly Dao, and it was the most supreme power in this world!

The absolute beginning divine realm was boundless, and there were countless experts. Who dared to defy the Heavenly Dao?

The masters of laws did not dare, and the masters of the sage realm did not dare either.

But now, a mere Divine Master actually defied the Heavenly Dao?
