“Elder Water, please,” Wu Yuan said modestly.

Elder Water nodded slightly and looked over at Jian Wushuang. A strange light flashed in his eyes.

This light contained special magic which would cause a monster spy to show its true form.

All the clansmen watched nervously. Once they confirmed that Jian Wushuang was a Demonic Beast, they would kill him without hesitation.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang was not a Demonic Beast.

He did not change even a bit before the strange light dissipated.

Elder Water let out a sigh and turned to look at Wu Yuan and Qing Huo. “This boy is a real Human Warrior, not a monster spy.”

Qing Hu and Wu Yu felt relieved.

“Father, I said Big Brother Wushuang is not a monster spy,” Qing Hu spoke.

“That’s right,” Wu Yu added.

Wu Yuan looked over at Jian Wushuang and said apologetically, “Little Brother Wushuang, I’m sorry for wronging you.”

Qing Huo furrowed his eyebrows. It was out of his expectations, but after realizing he was wrong, he immediately apologized to the young man.

“Wushuang, my friend, I was too rash. Sorry,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Qing Huo in surprise. He did not intend to blame this hero because his suspicion was reasonable.

Actually, he had a good impression of this Divine General.

It was only with great virtue that someone would be able to correct themselves after doing something wrong.

It was rare that a Divine General could deign to apologize to a Saint Realm expert.

“Since it’s only a misunderstanding, there’s no need to apologize,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Wu Yuan and Qing Huo smiled at each other and the tense atmosphere eased.

“Little Brother Wushuang, why did you start practicing Body Reshaping Technique just now?” Wu Yuan wondered.

“This is...” Jian Wushuang was deep in thought and did not know how to respond.

He could not tell Wu Yuan that he came from another plane world.

Wu Yuan noticed the young man’s embarrassment and said with a smile, “Everyone has their own special circumstances and secrets. You don’t have to tell us if you’re reluctant.”

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders with resignation.

“Wushuang, our leader said you had a powerful body and had forced a Cloud Realm spy to retreat even before you practiced the Bone Fusion Technique,” Qing Huo said in a kind voice.

“Now that you’ve reached Level Four of the Bone Fusion Technique, you must be even more powerful, right? I’m curious to see how strong your body is. If you don’t mind, would you like to spar with me?”

“Spar?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

He had just arrived at the Monster Continent. Though he knew that Human Warriors here were more powerful than Warriors at the same level from the Divine Land, he was not clear on how powerful they were and what to expect if he had not had a fight with them, and it just so happened that he needed an opponent to test his own strength.

As a Seven-cloud Realm expert and a Divine General, Qing Huo was an appropriate opponent for him.

“Since Master Qing Huo is willing to teach me some moves, I’d like to,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, good. Now, let’s fight just using our bodies strength,” Qing Huo responded with a smile.

After all, he had reached the Seven-cloud Realm. He did not want to fight Jian Wushuang by using his Cultivation of Spiritual Power, because he thought it would be bullying if he did.

Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo reappeared up in the air, standing hundreds of feet apart.

“Master Qing Huo, Be careful.” Jian Wushuang reminded him.

“Make your move,” Qing Huo said confidently, with his hands still behind his back.

He had reached Level Five of the Bone Fusion Technique, so he thought that he was stronger than Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang changed into a streak of Flowing Light and charged forward.

Jian Wushuang quickly appeared in front of the Divine General, then he clenched his hands and a mighty power gathered in his fist. He only used his body strength to launch this punch at his opponent.

Rumble... The strike pierced through the air, humming violently.

Qing Huo also threw a pure punch which contained an overwhelming power, but he only exerted 70 percent of strength because he was worried he might hurt the young man.

The two punches collided with each other as if two huge meteors had smashed into each other.

Peng!

Their terrifying power pressed against each other and let out an explosive sound.

Woosh! Qing Huo shot back like a cannonball.

He only regained his balance after retreating a thousand feet.

“How is this possible?” Qing Huo looked over at the young man who had not been affected by his attack.

He did not expect to be forced to retreat in that confrontation.

“I lost ground?” Qing Huo felt it was unbelievable.

Normally, a Saint Realm expert like this young man would be unable to deflect his attack even though he had only used 70 percent of his strength.

However, Jian Wushuang not only parried it, he also forced his opponent to retreat.

“Wushuang, you’re stronger than I expected. It seems that I’m not your match if I only used 70 percent of my strength. This time I’ll use my full strength,” Qing Huo said solemnly.

“You only used 70 percent of your strength? It’s the same for me,” Jian Wushuang said and grinned.

“What?” Qing Huo was shocked.

It was the truth.

Jian Wushuang only exerted 70 percent of his strength with that initial attack.

As for the result, he was not surprised.
