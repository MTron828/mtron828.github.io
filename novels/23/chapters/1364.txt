Chapter 1365: Disciple from the Star Palace

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang felt surprised about the reminder of the creator of the Lineage of Star.

That is to say, he had to pretend to be a Universe God in the Second Heaven.

At the same time, he was supposed to cultivate and improve his power, just like a Universe God in the Second Heaven.

After he passed the Inverse Cultivation Test and became a real Universe God in the Second Heaven, he would have to pretend to be a Universe God in the Third Heaven.

“Yuan, please take care of him. You should especially remember that during his Inverse Cultivation Test, no one can be present except you and Lei Chao.”

“Yes, your Majesty.” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

“Now you can leave.”

As the conversation ended, everything in the heaven fell into silence and the palace disappeared from Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“You are quite lucky to get a treasure cultivator from our master in person.” Hall Master Yuan smiled to Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang held the black bead in his hands and started to absorb the power within it.

When he finished, Jian Wushuang could feel clearly that his breath and power had changed.

“Now, even I can’t imagine that you are just a Universe God in the First Heaven.” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

Jian Wushuang was relieved.

“As the master said, I should keep my identity as an Inverse Cultivator hidden. And with this black bead, I’ll definitely be able to disguise myself as a Universe God in the Second Heaven, in terms of both my Divine Power and overall strength.” Jian Wushuang was satisfied.

Then he returned to the palace of the Hall Master Yuan. Lei Chao was still waiting there.

“What??!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lei Chao was shocked when he saw Jian Wushuang again.

“Why has he become a Universe God in the Second Heaven?”

Hall Master Yuan then explained what happened to Lei Chao.

“Now I know why.” But Lei Chao frowned and said, “It is a good idea. But it will be difficult for you when you pretend to be one in the Second Heaven.”

Jian Wushuang was confused by Lei Chao’s words.

Hall Master Yuan told Lei Chao, “Please take care of him and help him in his Second Inverse Cultivation Test.”

Lei Chao nodded and didn’t refuse.

After leaving Hall Master Yuan’s place, Lei Chao took Jian Wushuang around the numerous buildings in the Lineage of Stars.

Along the way, Jian Wushuang met many disciples from the Lineage of Star.

They felt surprised when they saw Jian Wushuang.

“Who is that Universe God in the Second Heaven?”

“I have no idea. But he is the disciple of the Star Palace!”

“Wow, a new one?”

Every disciple from the Lineage of Star had their own token that showed their identity as an ordinary disciple or as one from Star Palace. Those ordinary ones could tell that the token of Jian Wushuang came from the Star Palace.

That was why they knew Jian Wushuang’s identity even though they didn’t know him.

Jian Wushuang could feel that disciples were looking at him with envy and admiration.

“Why do they envy me? Is there a great difference between an ordinary identity and one from the Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang was curious.

Lei Chao didn’t answer his question. Instead, he said, “As you are going to spend a long time here, it is necessary that you know about the cultivation resources in the Lineage of Star.”

Jian Wushuang listened to Lei Chao attentively.

He was eager to know what valuable resources the Lineage of Star had as the top leader of the Purple Moon Sanctuary in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

Lei Chao started introducing them to Jian Wushuang, “Our Lineage of Star has a long and brilliant history and so we have accumulated numerous resources. For disciples of Universe God level, the most valuable ones are Real God Hall, Scripture Depository and Reset Palace!”

“Among these three, Real God Hal is the top but only Universe Gods in the Third Heaven are allowed to use it. Though you are in Inverse Cultivation, you are still not eligible to enter until you pass the second round of the Inverse Cultivation Test and become a real Universe God in the Second Heaven.”

“Scripture Depository is home to the Four Great Secret Skills in the Lineage of Star, which are the foundation of our lineage. Among these four skills, Secret Skills of Star Palace are well known even in the Eternal Chaotic World.”

“Reset Palace is where we cultivate our consciousnesses. Since you are good at Soul Attacks, you can go there for cultivation, before which you’d better catch several Meta Beasts to absorb power when necessary.”

“Those three places are very important, so only disciples from the Star Palace are entitled to use them.

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Only disciples from the Star Palace were entitled to use those three great resources?

He now understood why ordinary disciples envied him.

There was indeed a great difference between ordinary ones and ones from the Star Palace.

“Apart from those three, we also have Four Mystery Lands and Nine Shrines that are open to ordinary disciples. Though they are not as valuable as the Three Great Treasures, they will also help a lot with one’s cultivation and many geniuses are eager for them.”

After a brief pause, Lei Chao continued, “Besides, we have Three Cultivation Places, namely Star Tower, Illusionary Mind Sea and Supreme Tower for disciples to cultivate and test their power. Star Tower and Illusionary Mind Sea are similar to Nine Boundaries Tower and Inadvertent Dreamland, but of a higher level.”
