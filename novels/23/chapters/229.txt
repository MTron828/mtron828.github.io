Chapter 230: Scary Improvement, Peak of the Yin Void Realm!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Ancestor’s Land, Jin Ling and Mu Shan stood together.

“Two months have passed. Let’s go and look at how that fella is doing,” said Jin Ling.

“I bet that he has already reached the Profound Yin Void Realm.” Mu Shan laughed.

“Maybe, but maybe not.” Jin Ling smiled.

The duo walked side by side towards Purple Crystal Lake and arrived not long after.

But when they truly saw what was going on in the lake, both of them were beyond shock.

“What... what’s this?” Jin Ling widened her eyes, staring into the lake.

The endless lake before their eyes was as vast as before. But Jin Ling could tell with a glance that the waters had clearly sunk more than a meter.

Back in the days when Jian Nantian cultivated here for two months, there were no significant changes to the lake.

But now...

One meter?

Just how much Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid had been lost for such a vast lake to fall by a meter?

“It has only been a mere two months, how was it possible for him to absorb so much of the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid?” Jin Ling was shocked.

“This, this is impossible, how is this big difference possible?” Mu Shan was also taken aback.

Even if 10 Yin Void experts tried to absorb the same amount in the same duration, it would still be an impossible feat.

“This fella’s strength...” Jin Ling quickly turned towards Jian Wushuang, who was in the middle of the lake.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had stopped absorbing the liquid. His eyes were both opened and emitted a sparkling light. There was a suffocating aura coming out from his body.

Rumble... This aura turned into raging wild waves that swept across the Purple Crystal Lake.

Upon sensing his aura from the release of Spiritual Power, both Jin Ling and Mu Shan seemed to have blanked out.

“Peak of the Yin Void Realm?”

“He has actually reached the Peak of the Yin Void Realm!”

“In just a mere two months, he went from achieving the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, to breaking through four Realms, and now actually reaching the Peak of the Yin Void Realm?”

“How is this possible? ”

The duo may have seen and heard many great things, but they were stunned.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang’s mad accession in power was puzzling.

It would not be possible for any normal person to do the same, even if they were to cultivate in the lake itself.

However, the duo was unaware that the cultivation of Jian Wushuang is a Heavenly Creation Skill.

It is a cultivation method against the natural order like no other.

Poof!

Jian Wushuang resurfaced above the waters and appeared in front of the duo.

He shrugged his shoulders, which upon usage of force, caused all bones of his body to snap one after another. He then held both of his hands together tightly, allowing an explosive force to gather in his hands.

“Peak of the Yin Void Realm.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes emitted a strong ray of light. “That’s a pity, if you gave me half a month more, I would be confident of harnessing enough Spiritual Power to forcefully break through and reach the Yang Void Realm.”

He may have said the words himself, but he did not feel that it was a pity at all.

After all, his power has risen like crazy the past two months. If he were to reach the Yang Void Realm, that would be quite awesome.

“Right now, I am already at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm. In fact, the tip. My Spiritual Power has clearly improved so much more compared to during the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. I should count my blessings.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Moreover, his cultivation is a Heavenly Creation Skill.

Each step was against the natural order, but yet unique on its own.

A normal warrior would reach the Yin-Yang Void Realm, while a Heavenly Creation Skill would cause the Yin and Yang to break. Naturally, it was bound to be different.

However, this difference could not be further delved into in the Ancestor’s Land. He can only do it after leaving.

“Fella, I am very curious. What is your secret? If it is not a huge secret, it would not be possible for you to absorb that much Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid in such a short time. Neither would your Spiritual Power improve tremendously.” Jin Ling stared into the eyes of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze did not waver.

There was indeed a huge secret of his, which was the Heavenly Creation Skill.

But this secret would remain a secret under all circumstances.

“Forget it, everyone has their own secrets. I’m too lazy to dig deeper into this,” Jin Ling said casually and added, “the third opportunity has already been given to you. Now, you can leave the Ancestor’s Land.”

“Leave right now?” Jian Wushuang touched his nose and asked, “Can’t I accept the second test after all this?”

“Second test?” Jin Ling smirked. “Fella, I am not looking down on you. Although your Spiritual Power might have improved tremendously these two months, you are still not qualified for the test!

“The second test of the Ancestor’s land is targeted at experts of Divine Transcendence. Furthermore, the first and second tests are largely different. The first is much more relaxed. Hence, even though you only reached the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, you would have equal chances of passing it as long as you can go against the natural order.

“But there is no way you will pass the test without Divine Transcendence.”

“Is it really like this?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He initially thought that he could be considered qualified to accept the second test, especially after his improvement. But it seemed like he had underestimated the difficulty of the test by this Ancestor’s Land.

“If the second test requires experts of Divine Transcendence, then what about the third one?” Jian Wushuang asked out of curiosity. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Fella, you should prepare to leave. But before that, hand me the Triple-kill Sword,” Jin Ling said.

“Triple-kill Sword?” Jian Wushuang retrieved the sword from this back and held it in his hand. After a moment of hesitation, he handed it to Jin Ling.

Jin Ling received it and touched it gently. She shook her head and laughed. “Indeed, you had a Peerless Killing Sword in your possession, but you did not know how to incur its power.”

“Peerless Killing Sword?” Jian Wushuang could not help but look at Jin Ling.

This Triple-kill Sword was the first Sword of Killing from the Mansion of Sword Marquis. It was also the only pledge of entry into the Ancestor’s Land.

Jian Wushuang had had the sword for ages but never had any queries about it.

At most, the sword edge was sharper and the aura was stiffer.

Regarding its power, he had no idea that the Triple-kill Sword had other uses.

“Fella, wait for me here for a while. I will return it to you later,” Jin Ling said.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Jin Ling left with the sword in her hand and Jian Wushuang stood there, waiting in silence. Not long after, Jin Ling returned and threw the sword at him.

When he held onto it, Jian Wushuang felt a burst within his heart.

He found out that the Triple-Kill Sword now contained much more hostility than before!
