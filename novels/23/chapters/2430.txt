Chapter 2431: The Seize

There were as many as a hundred genius disciples from various sects surrounding the white token in that area, but no one dared to take it.

Even Pang Tao, who was considered the strongest among all...

Pang Tao gathered with a few disciples from the Great Compassion Sect.

“Senior Brother Pang Tao, aren’t we taking it?” asked a First-Class Divine Demon disciple.

“If we do it now, we’ll immediately become everyone’s target. Be patient and give it some time.” Pang Tao waved his hand.

Meanwhile, Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong also stood together.

“What now?” Su Tong frowned hard.

“We’re obviously at a deadlock right now. No one has the guts to step up because doing so means he’ll be attacked by everyone. Even Pang Tao doesn’t dare to make a move,” Zhong Yi gazed at Pang Tao once and said coldly.

“This can’t go on forever, somebody has to break the deadlock.” Ling Dan’s expression turned gloomy and looked at Zhuo Bing next to him. “Junior Sister...”

Zhuo Bing could understand Ling Dan’s mind through that look. She nodded slightly but still reminded him, “Be careful.”

“Don’t worry, worse comes to worst, I’ll just use the safety token.”

Ling Dan plainly smiled and suddenly dashed out.

Whoosh!

Ling Dan rushed towards the white token at breakneck speeds.

In that situation, everyone was keenly watching the white token and being very cautious of each other.

As soon as Ling Dan took action, he attracted everyone’s attention.

“Kill him!”

“Die!”

A large number of the surrounding disciples, including tens of Second-Class Divine Demon and a few First-Class Divine Demons, came rushing towards Ling Dan.

At that juncture, no one cared who he was or what was his background.

So what, if he was one of the Twelve Minor Kings?

He would receive no mercy since he dared to touch the position token.

Ling Dan’s expression turned gloomy upon noticing the wave of attacks rolling towards him, but he did not stop.

Just when all the attacks were about to fall on him, there was a loud ring and a thick layer of golden light rose from his body.

The golden light suddenly formed into a golden turtle, wrapping Ling Dan completely within it. All the attacks fell on the golden turtle and made continuous clashing noises. After a wave of clashing noises, the golden turtle broke apart and Ling Dan’s body suffered some injuries with blood streaming down a corner of his mouth.

Even so, he had withstood the strong waves of attacks.

Zhuo Bing had also taken actions when everyone frenziedly attacked Ling Dan.

She was incredibly fast and arrived next to the white token in the blink of an eye. She swiftly waved her hand, and the white token that had been floating in the void had finally been kept in her Interspatial Ring.

That sight simply made all the genius disciples roll their eyes wide with jealousy.

“No!”

“Let go, let go of the token!”

“Drop dead!”

Ling Dan appeared next to Zhuo Bing in the first moment. The golden turtle rose from his body once again, but it was a lot dimmer this time.

Zhuo Bing had a solemn look on her face, and her body was also glowing with a layer of golden light.

They joined hands to fend off those disciples’ attacks while propelling themselves towards the direction of Narcissus Island disciples.

“Friends, please give us a hand,” said Ling Dan with a low tone.

“No problem.” Zhong Yi and Su Tong did not hesitate.

Before the fight started, they had agreed to join hands.

After joining hands, regardless of who seized the token, the other three would do their best to give a helping hand to that person.

Zhong Yi and Su Tong would naturally do everything they could to help since Zhuo Bing and Ling Dan had obtained the white token.

Zhong Yi and Su Tong immediately made their moves.

That triggered the anger of everyone surrounding them.

“I’ll be damned, Narcissus Island is joining hands with Ancient Star Temple?”

“Narcissus Island and Ancient Star Temple each have two First-Class Divine Demon. That’s a total of four and among them is Ling Dan, a Twelve Minor King expert!”

“Hmph, so what? They dared to take the token, so they deserve to die all the same!”

“Kill, kill! Don’t let them get away.”

The rest of the genius disciples from various sects agreed and surrounded the four of them.

Zhuo Bing and company made up a coalition of four First-Class Divine Demon with the Second-Class Divine Demon disciples from Narcissus Island and Ancient Star Temple were also trying their best to assist from the sideline.

In such a situation, they could more or less withstand the attacks from the rest.

Their next step was to break out from the crowd. As long as they broke out of it, the various sects’ genius disciples would find it difficult to do anything to them. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Careful!”

“Quickly, this way!”

When the four First-Class Divine Demons joined hands and continuously withstood the crowd’s attacks, Zhuo Bing also tried getting close to the edge of the crowd.

“Here’s a chance!”

Zhuo Bing felt a little excited.

From the look of this situation, the four Divine Demons coalition could very possibly break out of the crowd.

However, all of sudden...

“Junior Sister, watch out!” shouted someone.

Zhuo Bing immediately looked ahead and saw a piercing light sweeping towards her.

That was a sword-light!

An extremely blinding sword-light.

Tracing back the source of the sword-light was Pang Tao who was projecting a strong energy tide. Together with him were another two Great Compassion Sect’s First-Class Divine Demons.

Zhuo Bing’s face changed, and the long red staff in her hand suddenly turned into a long snake, furiously charging outwards.

However, when the red staff and blinding sword-light collided, that staff which supposedly carried a heaven-shattering fury had been deflected, and Zhuo Bing had to take several steps backward. The few retreating steps caused her to fall back into the crowd.

“Kill! Kill!”

Everyone around her took the opportunity and charged towards her.

“Damn it!” Zhuo Bing could not hide her frustration.

“Pang Tao finally can’t stay still anymore.” Ling Dan’s eyes were incredibly gloomy.

Supposedly, with four First-Class Divine Demons joining hands meant that they could take over the area and had a very big chance of seizing the token, but with Pang Tao’s appearance...

The abilities that Pang Tao displayed could completely crush all four of them.

“Ice Queen, give me the token or you will die!” Pang Tao stared at Zhuo Bing coldly.

“Hmph, are you trying to scare me? Do you think I would be shaken?” Zhuo Bing humphed frostily.

She had a safety token with her. If she really came across a crisis, she could always escape directly with the safety token.

Want to kill her?

Pang Tao did not have the skills to do so.

“You’re looking for death!”

Pang Tao was furious and immediately dashed out.

Terrifying energy and power suddenly pressed against Zhuo Bing.

Although she was an extremely capable First-Class Divine Demon, when facing Pang Tao who was one of the Twelve Minor Kings, her mind still felt immense pressure.
