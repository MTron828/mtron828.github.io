Chapter 3059: One Against Three!

____________

“He’s dead!”

Seeing that the tip of the evil master’s purple spear was less than a meter away from Jian Wushuang and that Jian Wushuang had no reaction at all, Mountain King and Mirage Water sighed in their hearts.

Even a rank three True Saint could not dodge the evil master’s spear at such a close distance. They did not think that Jian Wushuang could dodge it at all.

Chi!

The long spear tore through the air and directly pierced through Jian Wushuang’s throat.

“No!” Mountain King’s pupils suddenly shrank.

“An afterimage?” The evil young evil master was also suddenly shocked.

His long spear had clearly pierced through Jian Wushuang’s throat, but he did not feel any material existence from the tip of the spear.

Obviously, the ‘Jian Wushuang’ in front of him was only an afterimage.

“Your speed is just so-so.”

A cold voice suddenly came from the void next to the evil master. Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared out of nowhere, and a blood-red long sword appeared in his hand. He had already raised the long sword.

“Oh no!” The evil master’s expression changed greatly.

“Humph!”

Mountain King snorted coldly and took a step forward. He also burst out with terrifying speed and stood in front of the evil master. Before Jian Wushuang’s sword fell, Mountain King had already waved his right arm, carrying the earth-shaking divine power, he ferociously attacked Jian Wushuang like a meteorite.

In the previous battle, Mountain King had punched a rank three True Saint so hard that he vomited blood.

However, seeing this punch, Jian Wushuang just smiled casually, and the star power in his body suddenly burst out.

However, the longsword in his hand did not stop at all.

Whoosh!

The sword was slashed out in anger.

Roar!

A deep and angry roar suddenly came from the heaven and earth, and the sword light from the longsword turned into a complete and huge ancient exotic beast.

This ancient exotic beast was extremely ferocious, and its evil energy soared to the sky. It rushed out with a shocking power.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

Bang!

The Blood Mountain Sword directly hacked at Mountain King’s fist, and the terrifying power contained in the sword suddenly burst out.

Crack! The sound of bones breaking suddenly rang out. Mountain King’s eyes were wide open as he stared at Jian Wushuang in shock. In the next moment, his body was directly chopped down.

“What?”

Seeing this scene, Mirage Water and the evil master also looked incredulous.

Among the three of them, Mountain King was the best at killing power. Mountain King’s fist was extremely powerful, and few rank three True Saints could match him.

But now, he was facing a mysterious expert who was also a rank one True Saint. How could he break Mountain King’s bones with a single strike? How could he fall to the ground?

“Star-sea realm!”

The white-robed woman, Mirage Water, suddenly let out a low shout. Her eyes were shining with a strong green light. The green light was like a demonic light, shooting toward Jian Wushuang and making eye contact with him.

Buzz, buzz, buzz.

The world around Jian Wushuang immediately began to change.

He was originally in a vast void, but in the blink of an eye, he had arrived in a pitch-black boundless sea of stars. Jiu Luo and the others around him had also disappeared.

“Illusion?”

“A mere illusion can’t affect me.”

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently, and then his eyes turned cold. “Break!”

Boom!

The shout was like a heavenly punishment, and the Starry Sea World shook violently and then collapsed.

“It’s broken. How could it break my most powerful move so easily?” Mirage Water was shocked.

“I don’t believe it!”

Jian Wushuang looked to the side and saw that the evil young evil master’s aura suddenly increased, and his speed increased by another level. The purple spear in his hand also became more demonic.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The purple spear was like a purple lightning snake, stabbing toward Jian Wushuang at an extremely tricky angle.

It was so fast that an ordinary rank three True Saint could only defend in a sorry state. They could not even defend for long.

In the previous battle, it was this evil master who had used his extremely fast spear technique to kill a rank three True Saint first.

But now, he met Jian Wushuang.

“Is it a competition of speed?”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand became illusory.

He still stood in the void, but without any warning, he brandished the long sword in his hand.

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

Jian Wushuang brandished the sword nine times in a row, and also displayed a total of nine sword moves.

However, even though he had executed nine sword moves in one go, it felt as if he had only executed one sword move!

It was the Ninth Heaven of Illusionary Sword in the Peerless Sword Manual!

The nine sword shadows were all extremely hazy. When they overlapped and gathered together, the moment they were brandished, the evil master’s body trembled violently.

“This sword move…” the evil master stared at the nine sword lights that overlapped and seemed to be executed at the same time.

It was too fast!

These nine sword lights were simply too fast.

It was even faster than the spear technique that he had unleashed with all his might, and much faster!

Boom!

In his shock, the evil master also unleashed his full power, using the fastest speed that he had ever used in his life to execute his spear technique, but in the end… .

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The evil master only had time to block six strikes, but the seventh strike had brushed past the body of his long spear, slashing directly onto his divine body. He was similarly unable to block the eighth and ninth strikes.

Chi!

The evil master’s entire head was cut off, and his divine body directly collapsed.

Crash!

A large amount of divine power began to gather crazily, and in just a moment, the evil master’s divine body reassembled again.

However, after the divine body reassembled, the evil master looked at Jian Wushuang with a trace of fear and did not attack again.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Mountain King and Mirage Water also appeared behind the evil master, looking at Jian Wushuang with a trace of fear in their eyes.

At this time, Jian Wushuang slowly reached out his hand, and a jade bottle appeared in his hand. As Jian Wushuang opened the jade bottle, a foul smell spread out.

There was some dark brown liquid in the jade bottle. Jian Wushuang sprinkled the dark brown liquid on the Blood Mountain Sword, and it was quickly absorbed by the Blood Mountain Sword.

This scene made Mountain King, the evil master, and Mirage Water tremble in fear.

“It’s the poison of the evil god. In the Treasure Pavilion of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, only two million sacred elixirs can be exchanged for one drop. Although it’s not as good as the poison of the Devil Star, one drop is enough to kill an ordinary rank three True Saint!” As the evil master said this, his body and mind went cold.

After all, his divine body had just been destroyed by Jian Wushuang.

However, if Jian Wushuang had just smeared the Evil God Venom on his longsword, he would have died instantly as a rank one True Saint with his divine power could not resist the corrosion of the Evil God Venom!
