Chapter 2906: It Was Too Late

——

“Who are you?” Leng Rushuang asked.

It was a simple sentence, but it made Jian Wushuang’s heart feel like a knife was cutting it.

“Shuang Er, you don’t remember me at all?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Leng Rushuang shook her head and said, “You call me Shuang Er, and this name is very, very familiar to me, but my name is Leng Er.”

After a moment of silence, Leng Rushuang said again, “Can you tell me about what happened between you and Shuang Er?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned. He walked up and sat down on the stone bench next to Leng Rushuang. Then he began to talk about it. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“That was a long time ago…”

Jian Wushuang told Leng Rushuang about what happened between him and Leng Rushuang.

It was the first time they had met in the east…

They chatted in the natural residence for a month and played the zither for a month…

In the same natural residence, he used his unique cultivation method to help Leng Rushuang transform the icy heart poison in her body…

In these three encounters, they had already developed feelings for each other.

In the Green Fire World, they were furious at the top of the dynasty!

Finally, they became husband and wife.

However, not long after they became husband and wife, bad news came. Leng Rushuang’s soul was in a deep sleep, while Leng Ruxue went far away into the vast eternal chaotic world.

After a long 100,000 years of pursuit, they searched for 100,000 years.

When they finally found it, both of them only had souls, and then they went to the reincarnation passage together…

Jian Wushuang told everything in detail to Leng Er.

Leng Er was fascinated.

After half a day, Jian Wushuang finally finished.

“In my previous life, I pursued you for 100,000 years. My heart was broken, and I missed you. Now, I understand what you mean.” Leng Er murmured and stared at Jian Wushuang. “Is this Shuang Er me?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Leng Er was silent for a moment, but in the end, she still shook her head. “I’m sorry, your person, your name, and the things you said, I feel very familiar, but I can’t remember them at all.”

“It doesn’t matter. If you can’t remember them, then slowly think about them. Before you completely remember them, I will stay in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and talk to you every day.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“No, it’s too late.” Leng Er shook her head.

“Too late?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“I don’t have so much time to think about it, because I’m going to leave soon.” Leng Er’s expression became cold again.

“Leave? Where?” Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

“A very, very far place. From now on, I won’t come back to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion or even the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Naturally, I won’t see you again,” Leng Rushuang said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed.

Leng Rushuang was about to leave the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and go to a very, very far place?

“Where are you going?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

Leng Rushuang did not answer. She just shook her head slightly and waved her hand, indicating for Elder Qin, who was waiting in the void, to come over.

“Master, take him away,” Leng Rushuang said coldly.

Elder Qin nodded and looked at Jian Wushuang. “Mr. Jian Yi, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang’s heart was trembling.

He looked at Leng Rushuang deeply and found that her expression was getting colder and colder.

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and left, while Leng Rushuang went straight back to her attic.

After coming out of the manor, Jian Wushuang’s heart was extremely heavy.

“Mr. Jian Yi, did you have a good conversation with Young Phoenix?” Chu Yong walked up to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and ignored Chu Yong. Instead, he looked at Elder Qin, “Elder Qin, I just heard from Young Phoenix that she will leave the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, and go to a very far place. She will never come back. Is this true?”

“Leng ‘er told you about it?” Elder Qin looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

Only a few Immortal Saints in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion knew that Leng Rushuang was going to leave the Pavilion.

No one else knew about it, and they had never publicized it. But now, Leng Rushuang told Jian Wushuang about it?

“Is that true?”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and said, “Elder Qin, let me tell you where Young Phoenix is going and why she is going.”

“Mr. Jian Yi, what you are asking is related to some secrets in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. I’m sorry, but I can’t answer you.” Elder Qin shook his head and said.

“But what if I have to know?” Jian Wushuang stared at Elder Qin coldly.

“Mr. Jian Yi, this is the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. You are a guest, so we are willing to entertain you to the best of our ability. At the same time, we hope you can behave like a guest,” Elder Qin said in a low voice.

Jian Wushuang was very famous in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

Many experts in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow feared him.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion did not want to provoke a top expert like Jian Wushuang.

But just because they did not want to provoke him, it did not mean that they were afraid of him.

Moreover, they were in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s lair, so Elder Qin had absolute confidence.

“Mr. Jian Yi, I hope you can pay attention to your words and identity. Otherwise, I can only forgive the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion for not treating you well.” Chu Yong looked over.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. “I’m sorry. Although I don’t have any enmity with the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and I have to pay attention to my identity as a guest this time, I have to know something because of my relationship with Xiaofeng. Since you don’t want to talk about it, I have to resort to some means.”

“Jian Yi, what do you want to do?” Chu Yong and Elder Qin’s eyes turned cold.

“Elder Qin, you are Xiaofeng’s master. No one should know more about her than you do. For her sake, I have to apologize.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light.

Boom!

A terrifying divine power suddenly erupted from Jian Wushuang’s body.

This divine power was so huge that it far exceeded the scope of an ordinary Divine Master. The moment his divine power erupted, he instantly activated the seven-star secret skill, the divine punishment skill, and the nine luminaries star armor.

The boundless golden divine power was vast and majestic. It formed a 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom behind Jian Wushuang. The Golden Emperor’s eyes were like lightning as he looked down at everything. Then, a surge of astonishing sword essence rose and swept in all directions.

Not long after Leng Rushuang lived outside the manor, Jian Wushuang, a guest of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, was directly attacked!
