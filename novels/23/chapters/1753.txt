Hong!

Then, the void before Jian Wushuang shattered like a piece of paper.

He felt the power contained in his palm and Jian Wushuang revealed a smile.

“I reckon that my palm could only give play to one-hundredth of a One-Star Man, or maybe even one-ten-thousandth of his power. Even so, it is extremely powerful!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The degree of the scariness of the palm that the One-star Man had left in his head was far beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination.

Even if it was only one-hundredth or one-ten-thousandth of the power, it was still considered an extremely powerful unique skill.

“My palm is also driven by the power of reincarnation, its name will be Reincarnation Palm then,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Just then, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“This feeling…”

There was excitement in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Haha, in these two thousand years, although I only absorbed some demon cores occasionally, the accumulated divine power is extremely vast. Now, I can finally precipitate the hundredth drop of Ultimate Divine Power Droplet?”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and he could feel the changes in his body.

In the ocean of divine power, there were originally ninety-nine drops of Ultimate Divine Power Droplet floated there. But then, an enormous amount of divine power billowed and it started to precipitate the one hundredth drop of Ultimate Divine Power Droplet.

The speed of precipitation was shocking. Jian Wushuang didn’t need to do anything, everything happened naturally.

In a short while, the one hundredth Ultimate Divine Power Droplet was finally completed.

“It succeeded!” Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement.

The one hundredth Ultimate Divine Power Droplet marked the completion of divine power.

Jian Wushuang had reached the limit of Real God stage.

The moment it was precipitated, Jian Wushuang immediately felt his divine power and divine body start to transform at a shocking speed.

Such a transformation was much bigger compared to the transformation when he had leveled up to the second stage from the first stage of Ultimate Real God.

His divine power was increasing madly in strength and quality.

For instance, if Jian Wushuang’s divine power strength before could merely shatter a ten thousand jin rock, he could easily break a tens of thousands of jin rock as his divine power grew stronger. A tens of thousands of jin rock! And his power continued to grow at a shocking speed.

The same applied to his divine body.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and fully focused on the transformation of his divine power and divine body.

The time flew past and half a day passed.

Jian Wushuang’s transformation finally slowed down.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shot open and there was a burst of light.

“I’m finally at the third stage of Ultimate Real God.

Jian Wushuang clenched his hand and there was suddenly an explosive strength that burst out.

In Jian Wushuang’s perception, the terrifying explosion of divine power was at least a hundred times stronger.

One should know that his previous divine power explosion was already at Sir God level.

“This breakthrough brings about a drastic change in me,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

At the second stage of Ultimate Real God, divine power and divine body could be compared to an ordinary Sir God’s.

Once he reached the third stage of Ultimate Real God, his divine power and divine body was at the level of Emperor God.

Sir God and Emperor God, both were Almighties. It looked like it was just a different realm but in actual fact, the difference was vast.

When he was in Buddhist Demon Sea, Jian Wushuang had dealt with five Sir Gods and they had even set up the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts. But he had relied on his trump cards to break the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts and killed one of them.

After he met Emperor God Xue Gu…

However, Emperor God Xue Gu alone had made Jian Wushuang go all out. He stopped at nothing. He had even performed the secret skill of Star Palace but he couldn’t match him evenly.

That was the difference between Emperor God and Sir God.

The difference was first displayed in divine power and divine body.

The divine power and divine body of an Emperor God was a hundred times stronger than an ordinary Sir God’s.

Secondly, an Emperor God’s comprehension towards Power of Heaven Way definitely already reached the standard of the eighth level of Doctrine Palace.

Sir God was merely on the seventh.

The difference in the aspect was shockingly huge too.

It led to the power of Emperor God that could suppress a Sir God like breaking a piece of dead wood.

As for the difference between an Emperor God and a Great Emperor, it was even more ridiculous.

Then, Jian Wushuang had reached the third stage of Ultimate Real God.?At least in terms of divine power and divine body, he was already even-handed with an Emperor God. Merely relying on such ferocious divine power, he could wipe out all Sir Gods theoretically.

“Back then, Real God Wu Bei was considered extremely strong among Sir God because he had reached the third stage of Ultimate Real God. It’s a pity that his comprehension towards Heaven Way was too low,” Jian Wushuang said.

Real God Wu Bei knew that his comprehension towards Heaven Way wasn’t high.

He had only comprehended one Power of Heaven Way and he had barely reached the standard of the sixth level in Doctrine Palace. He was very far away from the peak of the sixth level. Many Real Gods on Real God ranking list had a higher level of comprehension towards Power of Heaven Way than him.

Hence, even though he had fierce divine power and a divine body, Real God Wu Bei could only suppress an ordinary Sir God. If he were to run into any top Sir Gods, he might not be the Sir God’s match.

However, Jian Wushuang was totally different.

His comprehension of Heaven Way was far higher than Real God Wu Bei’s. His comprehension of Reincarnation Doctrine itself already reached the seventh level in Doctrine Palace, which was on par with an Almighty.

Besides, he had many tricks and secret skills that Real God Wu Bei couldn’t compare to favorably.

Forget about the others, merely the fact that he possessed the four Ancient God unique skill and three Ancient God secret skill was already sufficient for him to let out his fighting power flawlessly. With that, he was confident to wipe out any Sir Gods. In addition to that there was the Hong Jun Golden Sword, Mountain River Map, secret skill of Star Palace and other trump cards. Jian Wushuang was confident to fight a battle with an ordinary Emperor God.

Even if he were to run into experts like Emperor God Xue Gu, he could match evenly even if he didn’t go all out.

“My power has increased too greatly,” Jian Wushuang smiled but he quickly calmed down.

“I reached the third stage of Ultimate Real God, which is the peak of Ultimate Real God. Next, it will be the seventh step of inverse cultivation and to become an Almighty. However, I haven’t gotten the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill yet.”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

Inverse cultivation skills were very rarely seen.

The first five steps were easy but from the sixth steps onwards, it wasn’t easily obtainable by any ordinary people.

Jian Wushuang was lucky that he had run into the birth of Real God Wu Bei’s cave dwelling and he had obtained the sixth step of inverse cultivation skill from him. As a result, he had reached the third stage of Ultimate Real God. However, the seventh step after the sixth…

The seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, even Real God Wu Bei didn’t get it back then.

If Jian Wushuang wanted to become an Almighty, he had to first obtain the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill.
