Chapter 917: Xia Clan’s Wedding Gift

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Don’t concern yourself with my wedding gift. Worry about yourself. If you don’t have a decent gift, don’t blame me for defeating you,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Defeat me?”

“By you?”

Xia Mang sneered. “Jian Wushuang, you have no idea what you are talking about. Do you really think you can defeat me? You are merely from the Ancient Sect and all you have is your Senior Brother Master Blood Saber. You are daydreaming!”

“Open your eyes and see.”

Xia Mang’s voice was cold but he quickly stepped forward.

Everyone in the Drill Ground and many experts on the stand looked at him.

They watched in anticipation.

The wedding gifts from the previous 15 geniuses had already given them much surprise. Now, Xia Mang from the Xia Clan would present his gift.

The Xia Clan was considered the overlord clan of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land and held significant power.

Nobody knew how strong the Xia Clan’s foundations were.

However, everybody was aware that even during the prime age with the four Emperors reigning, the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land had held the Xia Clan in esteem.

Many opinions held that the Selection Ceremony was meant to lead to an intermarriage between the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land and the Xia Clan. The wedding gift prepared by the Xia Clan would likely be extraordinary and surpass those presented by the previous 15 geniuses.

“Distinguished Emperor Leng, I am inferior Xia Mang. To marry the princess, I have prepared three gifts.” Xia Mang looked humble and spoke calmly.

“Three?”

“Only three?”

“So what. It’s not the quantity that matters, it’s the quality. Perhaps just one of his gifts will outclass all the gifts from other geniuses.”

Everyone broke into noisy chatter.

Hearing the discussion, Xia Mang smiled and produced a jade bottle. “Please have a look. It’s Youth-retaining Elixir, my first gift.”

Everyone in the Drill Ground noticed the ivory elixir with special fragrance in the jade bottle.

Many people were shocked on hearing about the Youth-retaining Elixir, especially some female cultivators.

“Youth-retaining Elixir. It’s Youth-retaining Elixir.”

“It is said that the Youth-retaining Elixir can maintain one’s youth forever. An old lady who takes it will immediately become young and pretty.”

“It’s not useful for Warriors but it’s the dream elixir for many female cultivators.”

The Drill Ground turned tumultuous.

“Distinguished Emperor Leng,” Xia Mang said brightly, “the materials to refine the Youth-retaining Elixir had become extinct in the Eternal World. Therefore, no one can make it for a long time. However, our Xia Clan still has some foundations. We have two of them and we brought them as our first gift. One for you, and one for the princess.”

“You are quite thoughtful.” Emperor Leng nodded. His coldness had melted down a little bit.

Xia Mang smiled and waved his hand. Two strokes of flowing light appeared in the empty ground nearby.

The flowing light turned into two tall men with scarlet eyes and scarlet armor. They stood quietly but emitted strong Killing Intent. This created an uproar in the Drill Ground.

“They are…”

The experts on the stand looked at the two figures.

“Emitting such fearful Killing Intent. It must be Blood Emperor Puppet. Yes that’s right. There are two of them!”

“They are Blood Emperor Puppets. Unbelievable! These are extremely rare in the entire Eternal World.”

“Hmm, just one Blood Emperor Puppet would be comparable to a general Dao Master. Xia Mang brought two. The Xia Clan has deep foundations!”

The experts appreciated the value of the gifts.

They knew the two tall figures were very precious.

Xia Mang said, “The second wedding gift I’ve prepared is these two Blood Emperor Puppets. I believe every knows that one Blood Emperor Puppet is comparable to a normal Dao Master. That’s to say, having two Blood Emperor Puppets would be similar to having two Dao Masters.”

The whole Drill Ground burst into an uproar.

Even though the Youth-retaining Elixir was rare, it was not that useful and had not surprised them.

But the Blood Emperor Puppet was different.

Two puppets were equal to two Dao Masters. What a precious gift!

The five gifts Dong Yan had presented were insignificant compared with the two Blood Emperor Puppets.

After all, all the other gifts that had been presented thus far could be bought with Divine Gems. Two Puppet Fighters with Dao Master strength were much better!

“I’ve heard that there are several Blood Emperor Puppets in the Xia Clan, but I didn’t expect you to bring two today. Pretty good.” Emperor Leng nodded again. It was obvious that he was quite satisfied.

Xia Mang’s smile widened after hearing that.

Everyone waited in expectation for the third gift.

The second gift of the two rare and precious Blood Emperor Puppets had already been extraordinary. The third gift would be much more precious.

What would that be?

Xia Mang didn’t keep them guessing. He took out four tokens.

Everyone was confused because the tokens looked ordinary.

“Distinguished Emperor Leng, Elders, you are very knowledgeable Eternal World experts. Have you ever heard of Magic Cloud Valley?” Xia Mang said loudly.

“Magic Cloud Valley?” The general warriors around the Drill Ground were still confused.

However, the top experts on the stand looked surprised.

“Magic Cloud Valley? The overlord of the Eternal World hundreds of millions years ago?”

“That’s it. That was a very strong power. IThe Magic Cloud Valley in the peak era would be comparable to the Xia Clan.”

“Unfortunately, the Magic Cloud Valley was totally destroyed hundreds of millions years ago.”

Those experts had lived for quite a long time. They were familiar with the history of the Eternal World. Naturally, they would have heard of the Magic Cloud Valley.

“Dear elders, as you all know, the reason for the doom of the Magic Cloud Valley was an unprecedented internal war. The war had tragic consequences. Many experts died. The space where the Magic Cloud Valley was located collapsed completely.”

Xia Mang said slowly.
