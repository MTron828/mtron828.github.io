Chapter 1905: True Power

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

At the border of Universe Galaxy, Sir God Yin Yue found the weak point.

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance gathered.

“Here, everyone, let’s do this,” Sir God Yin Yue said.

“Use attack superposition formation,” Palace Master Wu Luo ordered.

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance immediately took action. The experts, including Emperor Gods, joined forces to perform attack superposition formation.

The six attack superposition formations gathered the power and fused them together flawlessly.

“Attack!”

Everyone launched attacks simultaneously. Boundless billowing power surged and the six attack superposition formations quickly formed six terrifying attacks.

The six terrifying attacks formed and hit the weak point of the galaxy formation directly.

Hong!

There was an earth-shattering thud.

Terrifying divine power spread in all directions.

There were almost seventy Almighties that teamed up and formed six attack superposition formations. The attack power was strong and even a Great Emperor couldn’t belittle it.

Under the fierce attack, the galaxy formation, that was firm and sturdy, including Universe Galaxy, shook vigorously. The entire formation trembled in the balance.

“There’s hope!”

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance were thrilled.

Even after the attack, the galaxy formation didn’t collapse at the first instant but it shook.

“Continue!” Palace Master Wu Luo’s voice was low.

The experts continued to attack with attack superposition formations.

Hong!

As the second attack hit, the entire Universe Galaxy started to break, as though it couldn’t endure the hit.

When the third attack hit…

The galaxy formation that had blocked Star Extermination Alliance for two hundred and fifty years finally had a huge hole.

Although the formation didn’t collapse straightaway, the hole became an opening of the formation.

“Haha, finally opened!” Palace Master Wu Luo was thrilled and his laughter reverberated, “Everyone, follow me in!”

“Kill, destroy Lineage of Star!”

“Kill all of them!”

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance were excited. Under the lead of Palace Master Wu Luo and other Peak Emperor Gods, they plunged into Universe Galaxy.

All of them were soaring with murderous intention.

From their point of view, the galaxy formation was Lineage of Star’s biggest reliance. Then, as the galaxy formation broke, Lineage of Star was only left to be mercilessly massacred.

However, just as Star Extermination Alliance passed through the hole and barged into Universe Galaxy, in the void above the depth of Universe Galaxy.

The experts in Lineage of Star continued to stand erect. They could see everything afar through the galaxy. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Sh*t, we’re doomed!”

“Even the formation broke. There’s no turning point for Lineage of Star.”

“The final reliance, it’s gone, just like that.”

The guest elders that were invited looked distressed.

They didn’t know Lineage of Star’s true power and trump cards. Just like Star Extermination Alliance, they thought Lineage of Star was coming to an end when they saw the galaxy formation break.

However, they didn’t notice that Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun, who were standing at the far front, showed no fear nor anxiety at the sight. On the contrary, the four of them wore a faint smile.

“It seems that Star Extermination Alliance isn’t suspicious as all,” Jian Wushuang commented.

“I intentionally led Sir God Yin Yun to find the flaw. Sir God Yin Yue was good at formations. She didn’t suspect anything. Naturally, the experts from Star Extermination Alliance couldn’t tell. They really thought they had broken Lineage of Star’s final reliance,” Hall Master Yuan sneered.

“Everything goes according to plan. Now that Star Extermination Alliance has already fallen into Lineage of Star’s trap and they have yet to realize, Palace Master, shouldn’t we haul our fishing net?” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

Hall Master Nie Yun looked enthusiastic.

They had been hiding for so long. They had been bottling up for so long. They couldn’t hold back any longer.

They were only waiting for Jian Wushuang’s command.

“Calm down and be prepared.”

Jian Wushuang chuckled then he turned to look at the guest elders, “Everyone, get ready. Later, we might need you to go all-out. Seize the time before the other two alliances respond. Let’s take care of Star Extermination Alliance first.”

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s command, the guest elders were confused.

Star Extermination Alliance broke Lineage of Star’s final reliance and came inside. Lineage of Star was going to be doomed.

However, whatever Jian Wushuang said meant otherwise.

Looking at everyone’s strange expressions, Hall Master Yuan smiled, “Palace Master, it’s time. Shouldn’t we show our guest elders Lineage of Star’s true power?”

“True power? The guest elders were surprised.

“Mm, we should,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, before all guest elders’ suspicious gazes, he waved.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There was a large number of figures that appeared in the surrounding void. They were densely dotted, more than a hundred of them.

The figures were in bronze armors. All of them were brawny and strong like mountains.

“This, this is?”

“Dao soldiers, they are Dao soldiers!”

“So many Dao soldiers? There are almost a hundred and twenty of them. Oh God!”

“How is it possible?”

The guest elders were shocked.

They knew about Dao soldiers and they had even fought alongside Dao soldiers before.

However, compared to the Dao soldiers that Jian Wushuang had taken out before, there were only thirty-four of them. After the fight with Star Extermination Alliance, there were some that were damaged.

However, what were the one hundred and twenty Dao soldiers in front of them?

The guest elders had yet to respond and there were suddenly two figures that appeared next to Jian Wushuang.

One of the two was a hunchbacked elder.

The other one was a Taoist-robed elder who stood next to Jian Wushuang like a servant.

When the two people appeared, the guest elders were taken by surprise again.

“Peak Emperor Gods!”

“Two Peak Emperor Gods!”

“Oh my God!”

The guest elders couldn’t help but gulp. They finally understood why the higher-ups of Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang and the other three Hall Masters, were so confident when Star Extermination Alliance had barged in.

It turned out that Lineage of Star’s true power was then revealed.

Almost a hundred and twenty Dao soldiers and two Peak Emperor Gods, three including Jian Wushuang.

In addition to the guest elders, in terms of team formation, Lineage of Star wasn’t any weaker than Star Extermination Alliance but faintly stronger.
