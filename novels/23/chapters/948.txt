Chapter 949: The Outbreak of Thirty Percent of the Blood Essence!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang’s roar reached all corners of the battlefield and enveloped the entire imperial palace. Everyone who heard him felt a similar jolt down their spirits and their expressions were one of terror.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Gu King immediately turned to look at Jian Wushuang. He felt the Bloodline Power within Jian Wushuang’s body once again reaching for the drop of Blood Essence from King Luo Zhen after Jian Wushuang absorbed ten percent of it.

In a split second, Jian Wushuang had already absorbed twenty percent of the Blood Essence.

In addition to the first ten percent earlier, Jian Wushuang had taken in a whopping thirty percent of the power of the Blood Essence.

“Damn it!”

Gu King felt despair.

Jian Wushuang was wasting whatever he absorbed from the Blood Essence that King Luo Zhen left behind.

He already found it to be such a great waste when Jian Wushuang engulfed ten percent of the Blood Essence, but now the latter had engulfed thirty percent?

“Buzz!” The Bloodline Power burst wildly out of Jian Wushuang’s body. His red and icy-cold eyes made him a nightmare to look at. Under the cover of the Bloodline Power, his Ancient God Power began growing at a frantic speed.

The fourth star was swiftly forming on his midbrows, joining the other three quadrangular stars there.

Now fully formed, the fourth star began to emanate an exceptionally bright dark golden light. It even seemed like a fifth star would be forming but the light eventually stagnated.

Top Four-star Imperial Ancient God!

High up in the Void, Jian Wushuang’s human body had enlarged to become a dark golden Ancient God body that was ten feet tall. Lightning bolts flashed madly in his similarly-colored pupils, reflecting his intense anger. A killing aura so strong that it was enough to strike fear in the gods of the Ninth Heavens rose from within him.

“I want all of your Xia clansmen to die alongside Leng Rushuang!”

Jian Wushuang’s roar left his mouth like a fearsome storm and just as promptly, he also made his move in the massive Ancient God body.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

Jian Wushuang used his massive feet to tread on earth, his every step causing explosions in the ground.

He then stopped and stood still in the Void, accompanied by endless anger and murderous aura. He covered the grey-haired old man with indifferent eyes entirely in his shadow.

Everyone who detected this murderous aura, including Xia Yong the Holy Master, all experienced a change in their expressions.

“Three Fingers of the Ancient God, one pointer to destroy the world!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed, his roar appearing to have emerged from the Nine Serenities. Simultaneously, he felt the expanding Ancient God Power from his body flowing toward his right hand at a startling speed.

The majestic Ancient God Power condensed in his palm. He then made a pointing motion.

“Boom!”

A massive spiraling tunnel appeared inside the boundless Void out of the blue. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was as if Doomsday had descended on them when the thousand-feet-wide tunnel appeared in the Void. Inside this spiraling tunnel was a massive golden finger that emanated a force that stifled all living things in the world.

This finger appeared to have been extended from ancient times. Boundless and imposing, it carried a force that was capable of destroying the world. The moment it appeared, the vast heaven and earth seemed to have come to deathly stillness.

This was the Three Fingers of the Ancient God!

Back when Jian Wushuang awakened the Ancient God blood within him, he also awakened a part of the Ancient God’s memories and thus, inherited the latter’s unique skill.

Even though this unique skill was capable of unleashing an earth-shattering power, Jian Wushuang’s body had always been too weak to make full use of the skill.

However, Jian Wushuang was able to temporarily enhance the Ancient God Power in him to the Peak of Four-star Level thanks to the drop of Blood Essence in him. It allowed him to finally unleash the full might of the unique skill.

He pointed with his finger, producing the earth-shattering power that forced even Xia Yong to move.

In the next moment, a terrifying power exploded in the space next to him.

One of the dual powers was hot and violent as if it could scorch the world.

The other one was majestic and boundless.

Even though they were evidently two different kinds of powers, they melded perfectly on Xia Yong’s hands.

“Secret skill! Heterodox True Form!”

Light flared inside Xia Yong’s pupils and in the next moment, he retaliated by sending a palm flying toward the Void in front of him. The two different kinds of powers exploded, forming a particularly malevolent exotic beast that was a hundred feet tall.

The beast emanated an unimaginably frightening aura as it lifted its head and roared. Then, it ran straight into the golden finger.

This collision felt like the collision of two worlds.

It caused a massive uproar!

The terrifying aftermath swiftly spread, forcing the Dao Masters on the battlefield backward.

A hint of madness peeked from Jian Wushuang’s red eyes as he stood in the center of the collision. He bellowed and his might, already so terrifyingly strong, once again heightened.

“Kaboom!” The terrifying might caused the exotic beast to collapse to the ground. Even Xia Yong was thrown backward by a hundred miles.

“Something’s wrong with this youngster!”

Once Xia Yong regained firm footing, he stared at Jian Wushuang with a pair of steely eyes.

He was certain that Jian Wushuang was hiding a secret in his body. Otherwise, there was no way an Eternal Realm dweller could produce such explosive power.

Suddenly, he turned his hand over and a green ancient sledgehammer appeared on his palm out of thin air. There was a layer of dark radiance that enveloped the surface of the sledgehammer, enough to frighten those who look at it.

“It’s been many years since I last fought. I didn’t expect that I’d be forced to use all of my strength when I fight again and that my opponent would a nobody in the Eternal Realm!” Xia Yong muttered to himself, gripping the sledgehammer in his hand. A force so strong that it could easily crush the Void was rapidly gathering in the sledgehammer.

Jian Wushuang, who stood opposite to Xia Yong, once again stepped forward.

This time, his momentum and murderous aura reached new heights.

“The Second Finger of the Ancient God: Star-extinguishing!”

His earth-shattering roar reverberated in the Void. Inside the majestic storm formed out of stars, blood was dripping from the corner of his mouth. He appeared crazed as an endless stream of Ancient God Power frantically flowed into the finger on his right hand.

He had demonstrated the second part of the top unique skill of the Ancient God Clan!

Three Fingers of the Ancient God—the first finger had the power to break barriers.

The second finger had the power to extinguish stars!

Yet another empty space appeared in the Void above the imperial palace. The empty space began to frantically spread, mercilessly engulfing the gravel and dust that were flying in the air above the imperial palace. Then, a huge monster appeared out of nowhere in the center of the empty space.

This was a towering illusory figure of an Ancient God.

The illusory figure was ten thousand feet tall!

The impressively tall figure was a whopping ten times larger than Gu King Tong who was locked in a fierce battle with the National Master.

The illusory figure seemed to have stepped out of ancient times and what was visible now was merely a part of his body. Even so, his appearance was already shocking enough.

Power gathered in the finger of the massive and tall illusory figure of an Ancient God. It then made a pointing motion.

The Second Finger of the Ancient God was about to be unleashed!
