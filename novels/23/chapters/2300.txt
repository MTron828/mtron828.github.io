Chapter 2301 Disappointmen

Hum~~~When Jian Wushuang started to cast his sword skills, a soft hum could be heard.Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Yi’s eyes lit up as they were pleasantly surprised.

Jian Wushuang then practiced the Sword Principle Bei Ming that Lin Yi had just taught him one style at a time.

When they saw the first style, Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Yi had normal expressions.

When they saw the second and third style, they started to frown.

When he reached the fourth, fifth and other subsequent styles, their frowns got deeper.

When all nine styles of the Sword Principle Bei Ming had been cast by Jian Wushuang, Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Yi no longer had anticipatory looks. Their faces were dark.

“Father, Uncle Lin Yi, I have finished the drill.” Jian Wushuang walked up to Zhuo Yufeng and returned the sword to Lin Yi.

Zhuo Yunfeng looked sharply at Jian Wushuang before he said with a low voice, “Wushuang, I thought you said you understood the sword skills that Uncle Lin Yi just showed you?”

“Yes, I did,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and replied.

“Buillshit!! You only showed the form of this sword skill. There was no essence or complexity at all. And you say you understood? As long as the person is not an idiot, anyone could show the form in these nine styles. This is the talent you have for the Sword Doctrine?” Zhuo Yunfeng stared at Jian Wushuang with anger burning within his eyes.

Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows.

Lin Yi, who was standing to one side, spoke, “Brother Yunfeng, please don’t blame your son. It might be my fault as I should not have used Sword Principle Bei Ming to test this little one.”

“Brother Lin Yi, this has nothing to do with you. You did what you could. Sword Principle Bei Ming is a good way to test his talent in the Sword Doctrine. It’s just that this little one is too disappointing,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

Lin Yi heard this and nodded his head.

Indeed, he had been trying his best to get Jian Wushuang to learn about Sword Doctrine. Sword Principle Bei Ming was the most suitable sword principle to test Jian Wushuang’s talent. The results... Jian Wushuang was disappointing.

When he saw how confident Jian Wushuang was and thought of how famous Jian Wushuang was, he thought Jian Wushuang would have been able to understand and showcase twenty, thirty, or even forty percent of the essence.

The results: it contained no essence when Jian Wushuang did the drill.

It had the form but no substance.

At this level, it did not match the expectations he had had for Jian Wushuang given how famous he was.

“Unrivaled in the sword doctrine... I heard that Taoist Priest Xuan Shen was the one who gave him the name. A divine sword even fell from the sky on the day he was born. It seemed like the things people said about him were false and the Taoist Priest Xuan Shen that everyone talked about was probably fake. His talent in the Sword Doctrine is not extraordinary. On the contrary, it is extremely ordinary.” Lin Yi too was disappointed.

He knew why Zhuo Yunfeng had invited him over. He was also looking forward to teaching a genius of the Sword Doctrine to start his journey. In the end... It was not going happen.

“Brat, go and practice the sword skills again. If there still isn’t any essence in your drill, I will break your legs!” Zhuo Yunfeng yelled.

“I have already shown you the sword skills that I understood. Even if I do it again, it will be the same,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“Bastard!” Zhuo Yunfeng was enraged.

Lin Yi could not take it anymore and said, “Brother Yunfeng, your son might not have seen what the true sword skills really meant and cannot understand the true essence of the sword doctrine. There is no point forcing him to do this. How about this: we can just leave things as they are. We can find him some cultivators whose expertise is in sword doctrine to teach him the basics. I will come and visit again after a period of time.”

“Thank you very much, Brother Lin Yi,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“No problem. With this, I shall take my leave.”

Lin Yi turned and left.

“I will send you off, Brother Lin Yi,” Zhuo Yufeng stood up and said.

Jian Wushuang remained in the middle of the training field. He looked at Lin Yi’s back view and shook his head.

“Looks like I overestimated him. As a peak Chaotic Realm expert from the Absolute Beginning Divine World and one of top thirty in his understanding of the Sword Doctrine in the Anjiu Prefecture, I thought that he would at least be a beginner in the Sword Doctrine Realm. He should have seen the true essence of the nine styles I just practiced. The results...”

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly.

In reality, it was not that there was no essence in the drill that Jian Wushuang had just done. On the contrary, he had made the extremely complicated, complex nine styles into simple, ordinary sword swings.

However, these ordinary nine styles were very powerful.

It was a pity that Zhuo Yufeng and Lin Yi could not see it.

Even though Zhuo Yufeng was a Half-Step Divine Demon, his expertise was in using his fists to beat foes. His expertise was not in the Sword Doctrine, hence it was normal that he could not see through the nine moves Jian Wushuang had just done.

Lin Yi also could not fully understand his drills.

Jian Wushuang now knew that Lin Yi had yet to step foot into the true Sword Doctrine Realm.

If he had been in the Sword Doctrine Realm, he could definitely have seen from Jian Wushuang’s drill how extraordinary the nine styles were.

“Someone who has yet to step foot into the Sword Doctrine Realm wants to instruct me, who has already reached Initial Success and is close to the Profound Realm, in Sword Doctrine?” Jian Wushuang felt odd.

Zhuo Yunfeng returned to the training field soon after. “You brat, you really dragged my reputation today.”

Zhou Yunfeng roared in anger before coming into view.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders. He was not afraid at all.

Zhuo Yunfeng appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

“Brat. Starting today, for the next three days, you will stay within your room and will not leave. Stay inside and reflect upon your actions.” Zhuo Yunfeng stared at Jian Wushuang. Even though he was scolding him with anger in his eyes, he was not delivering a harsh punishment.

Zhuo Yunfeng was a person who would speak harshly to you but still love you more than ever.

He looked like he was about to scold and hit Jian Wushuang. In reality, in the eight years since Jian Wushuang had been born, he had never punished him before. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even though Zuo Yufeng felt embarrassed and disappointed in Jian Wushuang, he knew that talent in sword doctrine was something one was born with.

Hence, he merely told Jian Wushuang to go and reflect in his room.

Jian Wushuang would spend most of his time in his room on exploring and studying different types of books written on jade bamboo strips. To him, this was no punishment.

“Yes.”

Jian Wushuang answered before going back to his room obediently.
