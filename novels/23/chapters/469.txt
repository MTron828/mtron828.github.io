Chapter 470: Disaster

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Numerous lords from both sides had gathered in the palace.

Now, they fled in terror.

“Run! Run!”

A forlorn voice reverberated through the palace. The lords escaped in a panic, in all directions. A red-haired middle-aged man who radiated a mighty aura was in the midst of a frenzied slaughter.

He was the Puppet Fighter, who had sat on a throne at the front of the palace.

He had kept to the sidelines until the Gold-armored Puppets and four Golden Purple Puppets had lost the ground.

Now, he erupted into action with overwhelming strength and killed many lords from the two camps.

Even superior lords, such as Black Yuan Lord, were frightened of him.

The red-haired middle-aged man was a terrifying Marquis Puppet.

“Let’s go! Hurry up!” Black Yuan Lord growled with a cold look.

Behind him, many lords from Marquis Piaoxue Camp were escaping swiftly. Thoughts of the Marquis Puppet’s Interspatial Ring were banished from their minds.

At this moment, buzz... An immaterial wave suddenly appeared in the surrounding area. A huge wormhole materialized and a figure slowly stepped out of it.

“Swordsman?” Black Yuan Lord recognized him.

“Black Yuan Lord, what happened?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

Jian Wushuang took in the situation. A red-haired middle-aged man stood in front of an advanced lord from the hostile camp. He casually slapped the lord, and the latter’s head shattered.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was terrified. “How terrifying the Puppet Fighter is! He is much stronger than my Blood Puppet.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

With 10 Blood Gems, Blood Puppet could unleash its full strength, which was comparable to the battle strength of marquis level. However, as a Marquis Puppet, Blood Puppet was weaker than the red-haired middle-aged man.

Blood Puppet’s power could not hold a candle to the Puppet Fighter.

“Puppet Master placed such a powerful Puppet Fighter in this palace?”?Jian Wushuang sighed to himself.

“Swordsman, run! Be quick!” Iron Saber Lord shouted.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He ran out of the palace with Black Yuan Lord and his other comrades. They continued to move toward the outer layer.

Eventually, they arrived at the outer layer.

They were able to take a brief respite and calm themselves.

“The Puppet Fighter is terrifying. He’s so powerful that even a marquis can’t fight him.” Iron Saber Lord sighed.

“What happened to this Puppet Fighter? When we were fighting the four Golden Purple Puppets, he did not move. But when we defeated them, he began to attack us,” Loftiness Lord said with a frown.

“Who knows? I guess the master of the cave mansion planned this.” Silver Wing Lord curled his lips.

“Shut up.” Black Yuan Lord shouted frostily as he looked at the other lords.

Originally, Marquis Piaoxue Camp had more than 50 lords in the palace. When the Puppet Fighter attacked, those lords had scattered and only a dozen lords had escaped.

No one knew what had happened to the other lords.

Jian Wushuang and his other comrades waited in the outer layer for half a day. Other lords trickled out of the inner layer in succession. More than 30 lords from their camp had survived.

“I’ve asked Spirit Lord to tell these lords to leave immediately. Half a day is long enough to escape, so those who haven’t emerged must have died in there,” Black Yuan Lord said, eyes narrowed.

The other lords were filled with grief.

It was a disaster for both camps to be attacked by the Puppet Fighter. Numerous lords had died in his hands.

“What a tragedy!” Iron Saber Lord sighed as he shook his head.

Lords were rare and now they had lost dozens.

“Our camp has suffered a great loss, but Marquis Cangyue Camp did not fare better.”

Black Yuan Lord looked toward the lords from Marquis Cangyue Camp, who had gathered next to them.

Less than 30 lords from Marquis Cangyue Camp had gathered in the outer layer. It was clear that they had suffered heavy losses.

“Compared to their camp, we were lucky. After all, we gained much in the inner layer. We received a Dao Weapon and grabbed four Interspatial Rings from the Golden Purple Puppets. Each ring must hold numerous treasures.” Black Yuan Lord smiled.

“Of course, it’s all thanks to you, Swordsman. If you had not killed Demon Soul Lord and Myriad Islands Lord, we would not have obtained the four Interspatial Rings.”

Black Yuan Lord looked at Jian Wushuang.

Demon Soul Lord and Myriad Islands Lord had led the lords from Marquis Cangyue Camp in battle, but they had been killed by Jian Wushuang. Without leaders, those lords had been ineffective in their fight against Marquis Piaoxue Camp.

“Right, Swordsman, you were taken away by someone, but then you returned suddenly. What on earth happened?” Black Yuan Lord asked.

The other lords from Marquis Piaoxue Camp looked at Jian Wushuang in curiosity.

They wondered where he had gone and what he had encountered after he had been unceremoniously grabbed by the giant hand.

Jian Wushuang was prepared for this question. He raised his eyebrows and answered, “I don’t know what happened. I just know that an expert grabbed me and asked me for a drop of venom that I used to kill Myriad Islands Lord. Then he let me go.”
