Chapter 2773: Join Hands

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I don’t know what Blood Thunder King you are referring to as a great opportunity?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“Join hands with me.” Blood Thunder King suggested, “With the current situation in Sword Alliance, if you are willing to join hands with me, the two of us would rise to be stronger than Yin Su’er or Yunshan. By then, I will be the ruler of Crimson Stone Fort and I will try my best to help Sword Alliance to sweep down the top forces like Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower, Divine Demon Sect and Dongfang Clan. From then on, this huge Danyang Holy Domain will be the both of us. What do you think?”

“You want me to join hands with you?” Jian Wushuang laughed mockingly, “There can’t be two tigers in a mountain. After you have complete control of Crimson Stone Fort, will you be willing to share Danyang Holy Domain with Sword Alliance?”

“Of course I am willing. At that time, if the Undying Saint behind you agrees, I can even bring Crimson Stone Fort and surrender to the Undying Saint,” said Blood Thunder King.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.

‘Not only that he’s willing to jointly manage Danyang Holy Domain, but he’s also willing to surrender Crimson Stone Fort?’

‘Blood Thunder King...’

“Blood Thunder King, why should I trust you? If you betray me afterward, what should I do?” Jian Wushuang looked at Blood Thunder King.

“It’s very simple. No matter how I’m just a High-level Grand Ultimate God myself. Even if I dare to betray you, I don’t have the courage to betray the Undying Saint behind you. I don’t think I’ll be able to live much longer if I were to get on his wrong side,” said Blood Thunder King.

Blood Thunder King believed that Jian Wushuang came from the Outer Realm and he also believed that Jian Wushuang had a powerful force backing him up and the leader of the force was an Undying Saint.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sank slightly after hearing Blood Thunder King. “Well, I can’t call the shots for such an important matter, so let me pass on the message to my leader and he will make the decision personally. Blood Thunder King, please hang on a minute.”

“Okay.” Blood Thunder King was very patient and he was just waiting by the side.

Jian Wushuang pretended to take out a token and then feigned a look like he was communicating with someone else.

Blood Thunder King could not see what Jian Wushuang was doing, he thought Jian Wushuang was talking to his leader.

After a while, Jian Wushuang withdrew the token.

“Blood Thunder King, my leader had agreed to join hands with you and agreed that Sword Alliance will help you to gain control over Crimson Stone Fort, but under one condition,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What is it?” Blood Thunder King peered at Jian Wushuang.

“What my leader values ​​is the many resources possessed by Danyang Holy Domain. Therefore, after the end of the battle, Crimson Stone Fort that will be under your control must completely surrender to him and he shall enjoy 80 percent of the various resources in Danyang Holy Domain when you get the remaining 20 percent,” said Jian Wushuang.

“He wants 80 percent?” Blood Thunder King’s pupils shrank, he gritted his teeth and nodded. “Alright.”

“In addition, my leader warns that you’d better not fool him. If you dare to have any other thoughts, he will personally come to Danyang Holy Domain and your fate will be miserable,” warned Jian Wushuang.

“That’s for sure.” Blood Thunder King smiled awkwardly.

“In that case, Blood Thunder King, I wish us happy working together.” Jian Wushuang raised the wine glass on the table and smiled slightly.

“Okay.” Blood Thunder King drank a large glass of wine with Jian Wushuang.

Then, Blood Thunder King got up and prepared to go.

“Alliance Master Su Han, this is my Message Token. The great change in Crimson Stone Fort should happen anytime soon and I will use this Message Token to send you a message at that time.” Blood Thunder King handed his Message Token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded after he received the Message Token and Blood Thunder King quickly left.

“Unexpectedly, Blood Thunder King came to me and offered to join hands with me. This is really interesting.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the Message Token in his hand, his expression was rather weird.

“Alliance Master Su Han, do you think that Blood Thunder King really wants to join hands with you?” Strange Old Tong who was next to Jian Wushuang looked around.

“I don’t know.” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “However, whether he is sincere or not, it has nothing to do with me. After all, I never thought of joining hands with him.”

Strange Old Tong raised his eyebrows and he knew what was on Jiang Wushaung’s mind immediately.

In a void in the distance outside Sword Alliance’s lair, Blood Thunder King, who was once again shrouded in the blood-colored robe looked extremely mysterious. He pulled to a stop abruptly.

“Come out.” Blood Thunder King cried softly.

Buzz!

A ray of light condensed in the void in front of him and soon a figure in a black robe emerged.

The old man in a black robe looked like he was intractable. He had very big eyes.

As soon as he appeared, he immediately looked at Blood Thunder King, “What is the result? Did Su Han agree?”

Yes.” Blood Thunder King nodded, “Not only did he agree, but he also admitted that he came from the Outer Realm and there is indeed an Undying Saint backing him up.”

“That’s for sure. Otherwise, Sword Alliance cannot rise so fast. The question now is that I don’t know which Outer Realm he is from... Did Su Han tell you just now?” the black robe old man asked.

“No.” Blood Thunder King shook his head, “However, Nine Realms of Golden Crow probably has Dragon Phoenix Pavilion and Star Picking Pavilion and very few large forces with Undying Saints. For those who are near Danyang Holy Domain and are willing to get involved with what’s going on in Danyang Holy Domain, you should know more about who they are apart from you Heavenly Modest Palace.”

Blood Thunder King looked at the old man in a black robe.

He was very clear about the identity of the old man in a black robe. The old man came from the Outer Realm, from a force called the Heavenly Modest Palace.

Heavenly Modest Palace had a great reputation in Nine Realms of Golden Crow and they had a powerful Undying Saint sitting behind it.

The old man in a black robe came to Danyang Holy Domain a long time ago and after working hard for a long period of time, he reached an agreement with Blood Thunder King.

Therefore, Blood Thunder King, just like what Jian Wushuang believed, was there to gain Jian Wushuang’s trust.

Blood Thunder King had never thought of joining forces with Sword Alliance, he just wanted to use Sword Alliance.

As for the Undying Saint backing Jian Wushuang up, he was not afraid at all. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After all, Blood Thunder King also has an Undying Saint behind him.

“I don’t care who is supporting Sword Alliance. In short, Heavenly Modest Palace has been working hard in Danyang Holy Domain for so long. I would never allow someone else to reap what I have sowed. We’ll first form allies with Sword Alliance and use him to destroy the two Yin Su’er and Yun Shan factions. Thereafter, we will try a way to destroy Sword Alliance!” said the old man in a black robe coldly.
