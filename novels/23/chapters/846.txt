Chapter 847: Hell Level!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Hell Level!”

“It’s actually a Hell Level task?”

“No wonder the commander urgently called us back.”

The palace was in turmoil.

Blood Eagle Guard’s tasks were divided into five levels: General Level, Difficulty Level, Death Level, Catastrophe Level, and Hell Level.

In normal cases, a Catastrophe Level task was performed by a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard. A more difficult Catastrophe Level task required several Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards to deal with it.

The Hell Level tasks were harder than Catastrophe Level tasks, and were considered the ultimate mission!

In the Blood Eagle Guard, the Hell Level task was almost legendary.

It was rare to encounter a Hell Level mission.

Sometimes, there was not even one for thousands of years.

The Hell-level tasks were hard, beyond the ability of Eternal Realm experts. Even if top Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards accepted such a task, they would face a deathly crisis, and sometimes death was even certain.

They were horrific tasks.

The Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards would even go pale with terror when they learned of their tasks.

“Hell-level mission, I haven’t received it, but I’ve heard of it. Since the Blood Eagle Guard was set up in Tang of the East, there have been four Hell Level tasks,” a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard clenched his hands and said with a solemn look.

“Five Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards took the first Hell Level task, they all got killed and the mission failed!”

“Only two Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards accepted the second Hell Level mission. In the end, one died and the other survived because of Doppelganger Secret Skill, but was seriously injured. They failed.”

“As for the third Hell Level mission, as many as 11 Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards set out, but only two of them survived by the skin of their teeth. Luckily, they finished the task.”

“Eight Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards carried out the fourth Hell Level mission, but the moment they arrived at the destination, they were exposed and all killed by a Dao Master.”

“Hell Level tasks usually involve Dao Masters.”

“Of the four Hell Level missions in our history, only one was barely completed, while the other three ended in failure. Each time they went to perform the Hell Level task, most of them died.”

“Now, we are facing the fifth Hell Level mission of the Blood Eagle Guard!”

The Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards looked up at the scarlet scroll with a grim look.

Jian Wushuang had just joined the Blood Eagle Guard, so he was not familiar with this Hell Level mission, but he was still shaken after hearing what the Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard said.

Of the four Hell Levels in Blood Eagle Guard history, only one was completed.

And the Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard who completed them ended up in a miserable state.

There was no doubt that the Hell Level tasks were extremely terrifying.

“Gentlemen, you are all aware of how dangerous Hell Level tasks are. But since there is a task to be done, someone has to take the risk. Go and fight, and seek wealth in the danger. Although this mission will be dangerous, you will certainly gain a lot if it’s done.”

“Just for completing this mission, you will be rewarded with 300,000 points!”

“And there will be many extra rewards from Empress Leng.”

Commander Hong’s voice echoed through the palace.

Upon hearing this, some Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards’ eyes lit up.

300,000 points was a huge sum of money. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Generally, a difficult Catastrophe Level task in the Eagle Hall was valued at 10,000 to 20,000 points at most.

300,000 points were comparable to gains from a dozen Catastrophe Level tasks.

In addition to this, Empress Leng would offer extra rewards.

Who was Empress Leng?

She was the real ruler of the Tang of the East.

As one of the four emperors in the heyday of the Tang of the East, she was the absolute supreme expert.

Her extra reward? Even if it was just a casual reward, it was precious enough to make them go crazy.

“Commander, what does this Hell Level task involve?” a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard asked, unable to hold back his excitement.

“As for what it involves…”

Commander Hong shrugged. “Although I have the Hell Level task scroll in my hand, I’m not clear about it. I only know that Empress Leng, the ruler of the Tang of the East, personally released it, and that it’s related to Her Majesty the Princess.”

Upon hearing this, two of the Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards raised their heads at the same time.

One was a young man who looked somewhat pale. When he heard “Her Majesty the Princess”, his eyes sparkled with eagerness.

The other person, naturally, was Jian Wushuang.

“Her Majesty the Princess?” Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

There was only one Princess of the Tang of the East, and that was Leng Rushuang!

“This Hell Level task is related to Leng Rushuang?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. He was unable to keep calm at the thought of it.

If he were faced with other dangerous Hell Level missions, Jian Wushuang would consider it for a while. However, if this task had something to do with Leng Rushuang, he would take it without hesitation.

“As for the specifics, I will take you to meet Empress Leng who will give you an answer. But for now, make your choice. Those willing to accept this task, step forward,” Commander Hong said.

The Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards started to consider it.

This Hell Level mission was more dangerous than any missions they had received. It was near certain death.

Nevertheless, dangers were accompanied by opportunities. The guards would gain amazing rewards if they completed the task.

Because of this, these Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards were somewhat hesitant.

But soon, someone stepped forward.

The first person was the young man with a pale face.

Commander Hong smiled. Obviously, he was not surprised.

“Jiu Zui, I knew that you would come out as long as this matter is related to Her Majesty the Princess,” Hong Tong said with a faint smile.

The young man called Jiu Zui shrugged his shoulders. He looked relaxed but there was an undisguised fever of excitement in his eyes.

Then four other guards came forward in succession, including Jian Wushuang.
