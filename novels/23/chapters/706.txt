“Big Brother Gu Qiong, do you have any method to contact the clansmen in the forest?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course.” Gu Qiong nodded. “Our Seventh Tribe has 15 squads here and each squad has its own contact spot. If there’s an emergency, we can leave messages in those spots.”

The Message Token did not work in the Eternal Zone, so Demon Gods could only use the contact spots to send messages.

“That’s fine, then we…” Jian Wushuang started to explain his plan to Gu Qiong and Gu Jing.

After a while, the three of them came to an agreement.

“In that case, Gu Jing and I will go to the contact spot. Little Brother Wushuang, you’ll have to deal with the outsider by yourself. Be careful,” Gu Qiong said.

“Don’t worry.” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

Gu Qiong and Gu Jing headed for their own squad’s contact spot, leaving Jian Wushuang standing alone on the cratered ground.

Jian Wushuang sat down with his legs crossed.

“Cloud Sea Asgard? I’m waiting for you!”

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes as he began to meditate on his Slaughter Dao.

He had comprehended the Fifth Occult of the World Dao, but his Slaughter Dao was relatively weak. When he had fought Xue Guzi, Jian Wushuang sensed that he was about to make a breakthrough in the Slaughter Dao.

He might be able to comprehend the Fifth Occult of the World Dao before the experts from Cloud Sea Asgard found him.

By that time, his strength would have improved greatly.

Jian Wushuang waited quietly for his enemies. Meanwhile, in the deep forest in the outer layer of the Eternal Zone…

Whoosh!

A young man with a saber on his back glided and came to a sudden halt.

He had an arrogant look and an icy gaze.

He was Wu Dao, one of the three superior Divine Realm experts, as well as the strongest one.

Xue Guzi was also a superior Divine Realm expert, but he was far inferior to Wu Dao.

Wu Dao stood on the treetop as he looked at this right palm where a Blood Mark had formed. This mark felt hot and was able to lead him to his destination.

“This blood mark is finally activated. I wonder which junior brother encountered Jian Wushuang.” Wu Dao sneered.

Aided by the blood mark, he would be able to find Jian Wushuang’s whereabouts with ease.

Wu Dao turned and headed for his destination.

Not long after Wu Dao left, a black-robed figure appeared where Wu Dao had stood moments ago. A strange smile appeared on his face as he stared at Wu Dao’s retreating figure.

“It looks like he’s learnt where Jian Wushuang is.

“Good, I hope he won’t disappoint me.”

The black-robed figure transformed into a black fog and moved forward.

He had been tailing Wu Dao for several days, but the superior Divine Realm expert had not discovered it.

Wu Dao glided through the dense forest and eventually reached his destination after half a day.

“I’m almost there?”

Watching the boiling Blood Mark, Wu Dao accelerated. He had a fierce expression on his face. Soon, he spotted Jian Wushuang, who was sitting on the ground.

Whoosh!

Wu Dao appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and fixed him with a frosty stare.

“Boy, you’re not escaping? You’re bold.”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and stared at Wu Dao. Then he stretched his right arm to show his Blood Mark.

“It’s impossible to escape with this thing. Why waste my time?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“It’s good that you know,” Wu Dao replied with an icy stare. “Fine. No more nonsense. I’ll give you a lift. Go to Hell!”

“Go to hell?” Jian Wushuang sneered as he rose. “We’ll see who dies.”

“Let’s have a try.” Wu Dao responded as he stretched his hand to his saber.

As the saber was unsheathed, the purple saber radiated a fierce aura.

Wu Dao snorted and swung at his opponent with the saber.

Shua… the strike cleaved the air. A mighty, brilliant saber river appeared in the sky.

As it stretched towards Jian Wushuang, it gave the illusion that he was being split in half.

“This guy is indeed powerful.” Jian Wushuang thought grimly.

Jian Wushuang realized that Wu Dao was far superior to Hu Hu and Xue Guzi.

Therefore, he had to take him seriously. He activated the full power of Sword Heart and launched an attack with his Emperor Sword.

Shua! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The continuous saber river shattered in the blink of an eye.

“Hum?” Wu Dao was astonished.

He glanced at Jian Wushuang. ”?He resisted my attack. It looks like he hid most of his strength when he fought my junior brother Gong Chao.?”

“But the result will be the same. It’ll just take more effort.”

Wu Dao shook as his aura soared. His body changed dramatically.

His entire body began to swell up.

His figure grew larger until he was two meters tall.?His aura reached a new level.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Wu Dao wore a cold smile. He dashed out and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.
