4613 Humiliation

Smoke rose from the incense burner in the center of the hall. A drunk Six Scar Void Master kicked the table away and began to dance in the hall with his ugly and strange body.

Long Bai sat in his original position, a trace of disgust flashing through his eyes, which was quickly concealed by a smile. He clapped from time to time, as if he was watching a beautiful dance.

The giant man sitting at the head of the table laughed out loud again. He directly picked up the maidservant sitting on his left leg, stretched out his arms, and twisted her head off.

Blood splattered as the huge man twisted off the head of another maidservant. The two heads fell into the huge man’s hands like walnuts and were coiled up.

“Long Bai!” A low and gloomy voice came from the huge man’s mouth, “The 200 maidservants you sent are really good. I enjoyed most of them. Look.”

Upon hearing this, Long Bai smiled and cupped his hands. “Lord High Void Emissary, as you said, I will offer you another 300 Holy Maidens for you to enjoy.”

The giant man called High Void Emissary nodded in satisfaction. “That’s good. When Void God returns, I’ll speak to him and ask him to leave the Dragon clan behind while we continue to control the area.”

Long Bai’s eyes flashed with joy, and he quickly cupped his hands. “Thank you, Lord High Void Emissary. The Dragon clan is willing to do our best to help Void God expand his territory.”

High Void Emissary smiled sinisterly and said with a strange voice, “I heard that your Dragon clan is prosperous. The women in your clan are all exceptionally beautiful and have strong bodies. How about you bring ten women from your clan next time?”

A trace of fury burst out in Long Bai’s eyes. He almost wanted to kill the High Void Emissary in an instant, but he forcibly suppressed it.

“I, don’t understand what High Void Emissary means,” Long Bai said through gritted teeth.

The High Void Emissary smiled sinisterly. “As long as you bring the ten Dragon clan women to me, the Dragon clan’s original territory will remain unchanged, and you can choose any seven territories for your own use. How about it?”

The Dragon clan’s innate pride and dignity were completely humiliated. Long Bai’s palm, hidden under the sleeves of his robe, slowly loosened.

After that, he cupped his hands and said without changing his expression. “This is a serious matter. Please allow me to go back and ask for the opinions of the Patriarchs.”

After saying this, Long Bai sat back down in a daze.

The overbearing leader of the Dragon clan who had led all the major forces to besiege the Divine Life Palace of life was now begging for peace like a dog!

He could vaguely sense that the opinions of the Patriarchs were completely wrong.

However, could everything still be salvaged?

The High Void Emissary, who was sitting at the head, was extremely happy. This race that was known for their arrogance was being humiliated by him at this moment. That feeling of conquest was far more satisfying than slaughtering the entire Star Field!

The High Void Emissary leaned back in his chair in satisfaction. Perhaps it was because he had drunk too much wine or because he had gathered too much Yin, but his head began to feel a little dizzy.

Everything began to spin, and overlapping shadows appeared. The High Void Emissary tried to shake his head and glanced at the center of the giant Hall. He did not know when, but three figures were standing there.

“Who are you? Quickly report what happened,” the High Void Emissary shouted.

However, he did not get an answer.

The group of Void Masters who were still toasting each other seemed to have been frozen, and they did not move.

The High Void Emissary finally regained some of his senses. To his horror, he realized that he could no longer move his body!

A blood phantom suddenly appeared in front of him. A domineering furious roar was the last sound the High Void Emissary heard.

“Bastard!”

Supreme Xue Bo extended his palm, and the divine power of a Half Ancestor easily shattered his head.

A mist of blood spurted out, and the mountain-like figure collapsed.

Everything seemed to be playing in slow motion. Long Bai watched the entire scene, and his heart turned cold.

“You have disappointed me. Your Dragon clan has disappointed me too much.”

A pained voice rang out, and a figure appeared in front of Long Bai.

Long Bai slowly raised his head, and that face that he couldn’t be more familiar with was now imprinted in his eyes.

Jian… Jian Wushuang …

His eyes were filled with pain as he looked at that face. For some reason, the resentment in his heart had disappeared without a trace, replaced by shame and guilt.

“An ancient race that has existed since the chaos of the world, have all your pride been eaten by dogs?!”

Jian Wushuang glared at Long Bai and directly pulled him up by the collar.

Long Bai came back to his senses and felt humiliated. The divine power that belonged to an Invincible Supreme forced Jian Wushuang to take a few steps back.

“How dare you, Jian Wushuang. Do you think you can humiliate the Dragon clan?” Long Bai said angrily.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang sneered, “It’s not an outsider who’s causing the humiliation, but you!”

The shame of being looked down upon made Long Bai lose his mind instantly. He immediately summoned his Life Origin Phantom, a golden dragon with divine power, and collided with Jian Wushuang with extreme terror.

As long as he killed Jian Wushuang, no one would ever know about the most humiliating side of the Dragon clan!

Boom!

After the golden dragon phantom hit Jian Wushuang, it could not move an inch further!

Jian Wushuang responded with his palm and then twisted it suddenly. The phantom golden dragon was crushed into powder.

Long Bai himself, on the other hand, seemed to have been hit by a giant hammer. His figure retreated and was embedded into the wall with a loud bang.

Retracting his palm, Jian Wushuang walked to Long Bai step by step, his eyes as calm as still water.

After that, he slowly stretched out his palm and faced Long Bai, slapping his mouth with both hands!

Each sound was louder than the last, as if they could crack the sky, and they echoed in the giant hall.

After taking care of all the Void Masters in the hall, Supreme Xue Bo stood side by side with Old Master and watched Jian Wushuang whip and swing at Long Bai without blinking.

“His blood!” Supreme Xue Bo smacked his lips.

Old Master nodded in agreement.

After a long time, Jian Wushuang finally stopped. He swung his palm and shook off the Dragon blood.

Long Bai, whose head was as swollen as a basket and whose face looked like he had opened a dye shop, finally knelt on the ground. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Long Bai, who had almost been pulled out of his original form, had a dazed look in his eyes. He muttered, “I was wrong, I was wrong…”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang said, “This is not your fault alone. It’s the fault of your entire Dragon clan. I’m going to demand an explanation!”

Long Bai suddenly raised his head. “Let me go. I’ll definitely persuade the Patriarchs when I get back.”

“I can’t let you live. I can’t let you live just because you’ve gathered the Holy Lands and Holy Maidens of the Divine Power Universe and offered them to the Void Universe to torture and kill,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently, as if he had set the final judgment.

When Long Bai heard this, it was as if all his strength had been sucked out of him, and he slumped to the ground.

“If that’s the case, then help me pass a message to the Dragon clan’s Patriarchs and tell them not to continue making mistakes.”

When a person was about to die, his words were also kind.

When a bird is about to die, its cry is also sorrowful.
