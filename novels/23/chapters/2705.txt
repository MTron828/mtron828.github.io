Chapter 2706: Jian Wushuang Out from Seclusion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Fo Yi is much better than last time.”

“Old Snake isn’t his match at all if they go one on one.”

Old Snake’s eyes turned cold.

He knew the Sword Alliance’s enemy was Star Fort but was not bothered because the Fo Yi from Star Fort was previously not his opponent. He could easily dismiss Fo Yi.

As a result, Fo Yi’s strength was somewhat beyond his imagination.

“Alliance Master Su Han, I’ll leave right away if you don’t show up,” said Old Snake with his voice reverberating throughout the area.

His voice had not only echoed in the surrounding void but also spread to the black castle below into the secret chamber.

In that secret chamber, Jian Wushuang had been spending time in seclusion to improve his secret techniques.

He was improving on the Divine God of Punishment technique and had yet to reach the very limits that he was capable of achieving.

Old Snake’s voice came to Jian Wushuang’s way.

Jian Wushuang was alerted and opened his eyes.

He then immediately got out of seclusion.

Boom!

A powerful divine power breath was discharged from the black castle as Jian Wushuang slowly walked out.

All attention was on him as soon as he appeared.

“It’s the Alliance Master!”

“The Alliance Master is finally out.”

“Look, look at his divine power breath!”

Someone exclaimed and everyone soon noticed it too.

Jian Wushuang had achieved the Heaven Ultimate God realm, but his divine power breath was raised to a new level under the disguise of the black stone to the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm.

“Peak Heaven Ultimate God, Alliance Master has made a breakthrough again!”

The Sword Alliance experts were overjoyed.

Jian Wushuang stepped forward and walked toward Old Snake.

“Old Snake, are you alright?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’m fine, but Fo Yi’s strength is a little beyond what I imagined it to be. I can’t stop him alone,” said Old Snake.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Fo Yi and nodded.

Fo Yi’s divine power breath was indeed amazing. Although he was only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God, he was much more powerful than the average Primary-level Grand Ultimate God and was not far inferior to the King Scorpion whom Jian Wushuang had previously met.

King Scorpion was an outstanding Primary-level Grand Ultimate God and extremely strong among Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. He was able to compete against three other Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods at the same time with his extraordinary strength.

Fo Yi was very close to the level of King Scorpion, hence it came to no surprise that Old Snake was not his match.

“Alliance Master Su Han, I heard that you previously can wipe out any Peak Heaven Ultimate God without breaking a sweat when you were only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God. Your combat prowess must have improved since you have reached the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm. You should be able to fight against average Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. We might be able to handle Fo Yi if we join forces,” suggested Old Snake.

“Join forces?” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled. “Old Snake, you don’t have to intervene in this battle for the time being. Let me deal with Fo Yi for now.”

“Leave it to you single-handedly?” Old Snake narrowed his eyes suspiciously and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Old Snake had always thought Jian Wushuang was too arrogant.

Fo Yi was not what he used to be. His strength had reached the top amongst Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. Even though Old Snake thought they might have a chance to fight against Fo Yi if he joined forces with Jian Wushuang, the odds of winning were still not great.

Old Snake was perplexed that Jian Wushuang refused to join forces. ‘Does he think he could manage Fo Yi single-handedly?’

“Alliance Master Su Han, you have to think carefully. The strength of a Grand Ultimate God isn’t as simple as what you think,” said Old Snake coldly.

He was merely giving a reminder as the decision still lies in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

“Don’t worry, I’m quite confident. It won’t be too late for you to join in if I fail.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Old Snake accepted the arrangement.

He was just a helper invited by Jian Wushuang at a high price. There was no friendship between him and Jian Wushuang. It had nothing to do with him even if Jian Wushuang died and the Sword Alliance was destroyed. He could just leave.

Jian Wushuang looked at Fo Yi after making his decision.

“You are Su Han?”

Fo Yi was also looking at Jian Wushuang with surging killing intent in his eyes. “It’s you who killed my only brother, Fo Wu?”

“It’s me. If you want to avenge your brother, you can do it. However, I don’t know if you have the capabilities.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“It’s time for you to die!”

Fo Yi did not hesitate as he mustered his terrifying Grand Ultimate God powers and sent it toward Jian Wushuang. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He had also made another move with the golden spear in his hand as it gleamingly burst in bright golden lights.

Many Star Fort experts had gathered together behind Fo Yi and watched attentively.

Gu Mo was among them.

“Su Han doesn’t know what’s good for him. How dare he compete with the Star Fort Master alone?” Gu Mo sneered coldly.

“I have to admit that Su Han has good skills. He managed to kill Fo Wu when he was a High-level Heaven Ultimate God. Now he has broken through to the Peak Heaven Ultimate God Realm, his combat power should be stronger. However, how can he even think of handling a Grand Ultimate God no matter how powerful he has become? That’s really stupid. The gap between a Heaven Ultimate God and Grand Ultimate God is so huge. There’s no way he can close that gap.”

“Watch out, Su Han will be beheaded by the Fort Master soon and we’ll then immediately destroy the Sword Alliance. The Divine Sword Official Army will also become a part of Star Fort.”

The Star Fort experts had absolute confidence in Fo Yi.

Fo Yi with his significantly improved strength was able to suppress Old Snake.

How could a Peak Heaven Ultimate God Su Han be his opponent?

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered with a sharp light while Fo Yi was charging at him.

“Grand Ultimate God!”

Jian Wushuang was excited.

Although he had seen a powerful Grand Ultimate God in action before, it was the first time he fought against one.

“My strength was already extremely strong among Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods before the breakthrough, but my divine power has skyrocketed this time after making a breakthrough while my overall strength has increased by leaps and bounds. The most important matter is the improvement I’ve achieved on my secret techniques. I should be able to fight against an ordinary Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. Let’s find out whether I can beat Fo Yi or not.” Jian Wushuang stretched out his tongue and licked his lips.

At the same time, he discharged a surge of golden divine power from his body.
