Chapter 5136 - 5136: Leaping Through Cultivation Levels in OneStep

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation     Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Stop!” the young Monk roared. Behind him, a vast avenue materialized, the heavens and earth transforming ceaselessly. A Monk with a massive rosary hanging from his neck appeared behind the young Monk.

The figure behind him was not a Buddha or a large Image Form. Instead, it was an ordinary Monk, quite similar in appearance to the young Monk. He clasped his hands together in a wrathful gesture and held a brown staff in the other hand.

“Break!” The young Monk’s slender body merged completely with the heavens and earth, becoming one with the Monk who resembled him. Together, they wielded the brown staff.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A claw so powerful that even Jian Wushuang dared not confront it directly was shattered by the young Monk’s staff.

The staff techniques were formless, yet they could resist a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, surprising even Jian Wushuang.

He had just entered the Dao, and it seemed like the Ultimate Dao. Perhaps only the Ultimate Dao could be this formidable.

The blood claw dispersed, and Xiang Bingyun, who had already arrived, instantly retreated, putting millions of miles between them before coming to a halt.

“How is this possible? How can you withstand me?” Xiang Bingyun could hardly believe it. He had never regarded the young Monk seriously, considering him nothing more than a small fry who wasn’t even a Yan Immortal. If not for Jian Wushuang’s protection, he would have been crushed by his pressure long ago.

Now, this inconspicuous young Monk suddenly exploded in power, directly blocking his strongest attack. He had lived through countless chaos cycles and had never heard of anyone skipping several cultivation levels in one step, grasping the complete Dao directly.

Could he have been disguising his strength all along?

Xiang Bingyun’s mind was filled with more doubt than shock, but he quickly denied his speculation. “No, it’s not a disguise. If it were, he would have revealed himself earlier.’

“Kind Sir, your injuries!” The young Monk, in the form of a youth with shaved hair and Monk robes, turned to Jian Wushuang.

“I can hold on!” Jian Wushuang endured the dissolution of his body, sitting down directly and mending his injuries with the continuous repair of the Great Dao within him. In just the time it took to finish a cup of tea, he would be completely healed.

Now that the young Monk had suddenly surged in power and could temporarily withstand Xiang Bingyun, Jian Wushuang needed to seize this opportunity to recover his injuries.

In case another Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal emerged from those corpses, even if the young Monk was strong, both of them would perish here today.

“I never expected that after millions of years of accumulation, just as I began to recover, I would encounter you two freaks!” Xiang Bingyun moved his wrist slightly. He was astonished not by the young Monk’s sudden burst of power but by the fact that he hadn’t reached a level where it surprised him yet.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Although the young Monk managed to block his most powerful claw techniques, it did not mean they were equals. As his energy dissipated, it became evident that Hu Qing’s aura was steadily diminishing.

Even though the two before him posed no immediate threat, each of them possessed a power that could rival the Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, a level that, in the Ancient Era, would have marked them as potential Emperors within their sects.

However, fate had brought them face to face with him now. In the past, he might have spared such talent, but he had been suppressed by the formidable Zhen Wuyang for millions of years, transforming him into something neither human nor ghost. There was no room for the leisure and elegance of ancient times in his current existence.

“The genius of the Great Si Region, if I kill you, I’m afraid even Zhen Wuyang would feel a pang of regret!” sneered Xiang Binyun. He was willing to risk his life to make Zhen Wuyang uncomfortable.

His hatred for Zhen Wuyang had accumulated over millions of years, as if the events of the Ancient Era had happened only yesterday. He could not forget Zhen Wuyang’s disgusting face, nor the glorious era of the ancient times.

“Die!”

His boundless anger erupted in that moment. He wielded a battle axe stained with ancient blood, the very weapon he had used when commanding the heavenly court. The axe left marks in the air, lingering like scars in the sky. Explosions of energy danced and roamed in the vast emptiness.

The Monk’s form, transformed from the young samanera, soared into the sky, wielding a long staff, ready to confront Xiang Binyun head-on.

In an instant, they clashed. The Monk’s staff techniques were natural, as if they were an inherent part of him. Every move was precise, leaving no room for error. Against Xiang Binyun’s bloodied axe, the Monk managed to hold his ground.

With every swing of his brown staff, he left room for his own defense, attacking with seven parts of his strength and reserving three parts for defense. This balance between offense and defense left Xiang Binyun unable to find an opening, unable to exploit any weaknesses.

The Monk remained calm and composed, his mind filled with endless zen wisdom, his staff techniques flowing naturally.

This was the Ultimate Dao of Buddhism, the ‘Zen’.

After three million years of cultivation in the Buddhist tradition, he had finally comprehended his own profound Dao, taking a step that others couldn’t take in millions of years. He had ascended directly to the rank of a Great Vajra in the Buddhist Sect, a power equal to that of a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

Even the accomplished disciples in the heavens couldn’t match his brilliance. If he managed to return alive, he would undoubtedly be hailed as the foremost disciple on the Wuliang Mountain, a path so rare in the original universe.

In the realm of Emperors, there was only one with the Ultimate Dao, the

Ancestor of the Ancient God Clan.

As for the Yan Immortals with the Ultimate Dao, it was elusive, with only a few in each era achieving the Grand Yan Immortal cultivation level due to its extreme difficulty.

Jian Wushuang, thanks to his profound understanding of the Ultimate Dao, practiced for millions of years in the starry sky to break through to the Grand Yan Immortal level. Yet, his Ultimate Sword Dao remained at the fifth level, unable to make progress.

To have a chance at merging Daos, one had to reach at least the seventh level of the Ultimate Dao. Success was a one-in-a-billion chance, explaining why there was only one Ultimate Emperor in the entire original universe, the Ancestor of the Ancient God Clan.

However, the young samanera had seemingly leaped directly into the sixth level of the Ultimate Dao. With one more step, he could attempt merging paths to become an Ultimate Emperor.

An Emperor with the Ultimate Dao! Even without control over any Great World, he had the power of a fourth-tier Emperor.

The Ancestor of the Ancient God Clan, when at the seventh level, successfully merged Daos and later, through countless chaotic cycles, advanced to the fifth- tier Emperor.

This was the pinnacle of the universe, and there was hope for him to ascend further, reaching the ninth level of the Dao of Destruction, becoming truly invincible in the universe. At that point, he could effortlessly become the ruler of the cosmos. Yet, this step was incredibly challenging, requiring immense luck. Success was almost impossible.

Now, with the young samanera taking the first step, his strength had grown immensely. Who knew what he would become with the next step? He was the real genius. Once he ascended to the Emperor-level, even with fourth-tier strength, he would be far superior to most disciples nurtured by major forces. Many who became Emperor Gods in these forces remained ordinary, possessing only first-tier strength, struggling to control even a low-grade world.

Such weak Emperors were not worthy of the attention of these major forces. A true Emperor needed at least second-tier strength to be considered powerful. Third-tier Emperors were the leaders of factions, truly exceptional beings..
