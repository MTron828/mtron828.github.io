Chapter 2697: The Fight With Fo Wu

“A good future? You people are just a second-rated force, what sort of good future will there be?” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently. “You’re Fo Wu, right? I really want to see how capable you are that enables you to speak to me like that!”

Hum!!

The Infernal Crimson Divine Swords appeared in front of Jian Wushuang one by one with a total of nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords.

These nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords merged and a huge black divine sword came bursting through the Reincarnation Passage before traveling through the void and appeared in front of Fo Wu in the blink of an eye.

The black divine sword was incredibly strong such that an ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate God would not dare look down at it when they see it. However, Fo Wu smiled in disdain as a phantom sword figure formed with the wave of his hand and collided head-on with the black divine sword. As a result, the black divine sword was instantly sent flying outward. The entire sword was trembling crazily as though it was going to break apart.

“You’re really quite strong.” Jian Wushuang focused his sight.

His Reincarnation Sword Formation was very strong, valiant, and extremely powerful under his full force.

However, Fo Wu had yet to unveil his mystical weapon but already could almost break the Reincarnation Sword Formation with the phantom sword formed from his hand wave.

There really were not many people who could achieve such strength among Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Show me whatever tricks you have up your sleeves or you won’t have your chance anymore.” Fo Wu was still bathed under the sunshine and looked as though he was high above the rest in an extremely detached state.

Jian Wushuang’s body slightly trembled before activating the Seven Stars Secret Technique.

His divine power was raised to another level upon activating the Seven Stars Secret Technique.

At the same time, a layer of golden armor covered his body amidst surging golden lights that surrounded the entire sky.

He had activated all the secret techniques he owned—the Seven Stars Secret Technique, the Nine Sparkle Star Armor Golden Armor Chapter, and the Divine God of Punishment.

Jian Wushuang softly yelled, “Let’s try again.”

Hum!!

The black divine sword slightly trembled before bursting out once again.

The difference being the black divine sword was much stronger than how it previously was.

The Seven Stars Secret Technique had improved his strength by an entire realm!

The Nine Sparkle Star Armor’s Golden Armor Chapter had raised his combat power by three times!

The current Jian Wushuang was completely different from his previous self.

Fo Wu waved his hand again when he saw the black divine sword once again headed over.

A phantom sword swept over just like what had happened moments ago. However, it was slightly brighter than the previous.

Both parties collided once again and resulted in...

Bang!

The phantom sword directly dimmed down and exploded while the black divine sword continued traveling towards Fo Wu to carry out its attack.

Fo Wu slightly frowned and directly attacked using his palm as a sword replacement.

Clank~ The enormous phantom sword almost separated the void into two halves.

Clank!

A loud metal collision sound was heard before the black divine sword was sent retreating in a shiver. However, Fo Wu’s figure was also sent two steps backward.

Fo Wu stabilized himself after stepping back two steps before looking at his slightly tingling palm with an indifferent smile. “This is much more interesting.”

Fo Wu finally took his mystical weapon out.

It was a crimson red battle saber that looked as though it was burning in flames when they first laid eyes on it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Apart from that, Fo Wu’s sacred aura skyrocketed as a huge red sun appeared behind him. That crimson red sun was like the scorching sun rising in the morning that silently suspended behind Fo Wu.

A red light appeared in Fo Wu’s eyes as he raised his head.

Boom!!

The frightening saber essence suddenly rose.

The crimson red battle saber suddenly took action.

The blade directly fell downward.

Just like the morning sun rising from the east, the red light shone and lit up the entire sky.

Jian Wushuang had a serious look on his face.

His overwhelming divine power surged outward as the black divine sword’s strength rose once again before headed directly towards the sword with the speed of a meteor falling from the sky.

Bang!

The violent bang roared in the vast sky.

It was as though two stars had crazily knocked into each other.

The surrounding hall had already broken apart to the extent it had affected the huge buildings around it. Those buildings were also crushed into powder following the attack’s aftermath.

Many of Corpse Palace experts rose to the sky in fright and had already escaped to the distant void from the battlefield.

They looked at that scene with widened eyes.

Both Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master also retreated to the void nearby. Unfortunately, the two of them could not make any moves as Gu Mo and the other two Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods from Star Fort were standing beside them—giving them no escaping chances.

In the middle of the battlefield.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang looked slightly dire. He had just escaped from a blast before a figure under the red sun’s cover had come chasing after him.

Fo Wu was holding his battle saber in one hand whilst his facial expression turned cold. A murderous hint appeared in his eyes.

“Prepare to die!” Fo Wu yelled softly.

The original young sun that had risen from the east turned into a scorching hot one in the blink of an eye and was burning the entire land.

The saber-light that swung from Fo Wu’s hand had also completely spread out while carrying a raging fire.

All the surrounding void turned into a sea of fire upon the appearance of the saber-light.

As for Jian Wushuang, he suffered the scariest attack amidst the fire. Boom!

Endless power came surging from all sides and pushed against Jian Wushuang’s body.

Jian Wushuang was unable to withstand that degree of attack. He could only rely on his physical protective abilities and forcefully withstand the attack with his own body.

Finally, the sea of fire slowly dispersed as heaven and earth calmed down.

A humongous red sun was still behind Fo Wu as he stared at the void in front of him before a human figure slowly appeared.

Fo Wu was doubtful when he first saw that figure before being surprised by it. In the end, all his emotions turned into disbelief.

“He might not have died, but why isn’t he hurt at all?” Fo Wu had indeed seen clearly that Jian Wushuang’s divine body did not suffer any harm. He had double armors covering his body. The Golden Armor on the outer level had already crumbled but his Life Armor did not suffer any major damages.

His aura did not even suffer and weakened in the slight.

“Impossible! My attack just now had injured him. No matter how strong his physical protective abilities are, he can’t be unharmed.” Fo Wu stared at Jian Wushuang.

He had no idea that Jian Wushuang had the perfect immortal body as a Perfect Chaotic Creature.

He would immediately recover from any wounds as long as his divine power was abundant.

Jian Wushuang was wounded by the blow just moments ago. However, he recovered in an instant with divine power to the extent it looked as though nothing had happened to him.

“Fo Wu, I’ve to admit that you’re really strong.” Jian Wushuang stood in the void and had a cold look in his eyes as he looked toward Fo Wu.
