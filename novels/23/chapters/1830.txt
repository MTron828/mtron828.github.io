Chapter 1831: Jian Wushuang’s Reply

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Upon seeing Jian Wushuang, who had appeared before them, the expressions of Fortress Master Hong Tian and the twelve Almighties behind him changed slightly.

“The Star Palace Master is becoming more and more arrogant. I sent an invitation to him personally and in the end, he did not come,” Fortress Master Hong Tian said in a deep voice.

“Palace Master is busy with his own matters and he does not have the time to care about such a small matter,” Jian Wushuang said nonchalantly.

“Busy with his own matters? Isn’t is travelling in the Ancient Mystery Land? Hmph, that old bastard. I really hope that he will die in the Ancient Mystery Land one day,” Fortress Master Hong Tian snorted coldly and he did not care about Jian Wushuang who was present in the slightest bit.

Upon hearing Fortress Master Hong Tian’s words, a light that was hard to notice flashed past Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The Fortress Master Hong Tian was right. The Star Palace Master had indeed died in the Ancient Mystery Land.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian, let’s cut the crap. Why not tell me your motive this time around bluntly?” Jian Wushuang crossed his arms.

“My motive is simple. Behind me, there are twelve Almighties. All of them are now my friends and they are all currently guests in my Deluge Fortress. I hope that the Lineage of Star will not make things difficult for them, if they do…” Fortress Master Hong Tian had only managed to speak until this point.

“Then what?” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly, “Fortress Master Hong Tian, are you trying to threaten the Lineage of Star? Or do you plan to start a war with the Lineage of Star head-on?”

Fortress Master Hong Tian was stunned and after muttering to himself for a long time, he spoke again, “Jian Wushuang, for you to be able to reach your current stage today, you are definitely not an idiot. You’re right. Your Lineage of Star is powerful. However, with many Almighties teaming up now, our lineup is probably more powerful than your Lineage of Star. If a great battle were to really break out on both sides, the end result would definitely be mutual destruction, with both sides suffering losses. Is there really a need for this?”

“Why don’t both our sides take a step back? From today on, all these good friends of mine, including me, will make a detour right away if we come across experts of the Lineage of Star. As for you, you must not make trouble for us again. Deal?”

“Take a step back? What a great idea,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“In other words, you agree to this?” Fortress Master Hong Tian looked over.

“Agree? What a joke. Why must my Lineage of Star agree to all of you? Do you think that all of you have the right to get my Lineage of Star to retreat?” Jian Wushuang laughed with ridicule.

Upon hearing that, the twelve Almighties behind Fortress Master Hong Tian were all enraged.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t be too much!”

“That’s right. Even if we were to have a great battle, do you think that we would be afraid of you?”

“At most, there will be mutual destruction. Even if we were to die, your Lineage of Star would definitely suffer heavy losses like never before.”

Many shouting voices could be heard in the hall repeatedly.

The fury and god power that these shouting voices contained also caused many of the experts of the Sanctuary Alliance to shiver in fear.

“Jian Wushuang,” Fortress Master Hong Tian’s voice turned cold. “To your Lineage of Star, this matter is considered huge. I think you had better have a good discussion with the Star Palace Master, as well as the other Hall Masters of the Lineage of Star first, before making a decision.”

“Discuss with them? There’s no need for that,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and his eyes were extremely determined, like never before. “Since I have come alone, my decision can fully represent the Lineage of Star and I can give you my answer now!”

“You wish for the Lineage of Star to retreat, for us to be non-aggressive toward one another and for us to stop what we are doing now? Impossible!!!”

“Since my Lineage of Star has already made up our mind to take action, we will continue our massacre. Aren’t all of you gathered together and staying in the Deluge Fortress now? Since that’s the case, within ten years, my Lineage of Star will fight our way into the Deluge Fortress and kill the thirteen of you which is inclusive of you, Fortress Master Hong Tian!!”

“None of you will be able to escape!!”

Jian Wushaung was filled with murderous intent and he had already made up his mind a long time ago.

He could tell that Fortress Master Hong Tian had invited him there on that very day simply to show him the power of their lineup in order to frighten him as well as the Lineage of Star so that the Lineage of Star would stop their massacre.

In addition, their lineup was very powerful.

Thirteen Almighties, which was inclusive of two Emperor Gods. Moreover, there was Fortress Master Hong Tian, a Peak Emperor God expert would be present. Even if it were a big powerhouse like the Soaring Heaven King Palace, they would not dare to provoke him as well.

However, as their lineup was very powerful, it made Jian Wushuang want to kill them even more.

It should be known that the Lineage of Star was about to face an unprecedented danger. The moment the danger descended upon them completely, a great number of experts from the powerhouses would probably throw themselves at them, including the thirteen Almighties which was inclusive of Fortress Master Hong Tian who already had a huge grudge against the Lineage of Star to begin with. Moreover, at that time, these thirteen Almighties would definitely bring about great dangers to the Lineage of Star.

Hence, before the danger descended, these thirteen people had to die, no matter what!

Within the hall, countless experts of the Sanctuary Alliance were gathered together.

The thirteen people, which was inclusive of Fortress Master Hong Tian, continued standing at their positions and Jian Wushuang’s answer was still resounding in their ears.

Within ten years, the Lineage of Star would fight their way to the Deluge Fortress and kill the thirteen of them?

“How arrogant!!!”

“How impudent!!!”

“Jian Wushuang, you are too arrogant.”

The Almighties were all extremely furious and some people even roared with fury repeatedly. If not for them being in the Thunderbolt Island and the fact that fighting was forbidden, some of them would have taken action to kill Jian Wushuang on the spot as they could no longer take it.

After all, they were thirteen Almighties which was inclusive of Fortress Master Hong Tian as well. With such a powerful lineup and that they were willing to take a step back, Jian Wushuang still did not agree to their conditions in the end?

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had also threatened to fight his way into the Deluge Fortress?

This was him not caring about the thirteen of them at all.

“Jian Wushuang, do you know what you have just said?” Fortress Master Hong Tian’s expression turned grave and he stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course I do, and I will repeat it for all of you again. The thirteen of you had better sit back and prepare yourselves. Within ten years, my Lineage of Star will fight our way into the Deluge Fortress and get our hands on your necks,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was ice-cold.

“Good, very good!”

“Then I shall await respectfully in the Deluge Fortress for the arrival of the Lineage of Star!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian’s voice was extremely cold and his eyes were also burning with flames with fury.

Jian Wushuang curled his lips and he was too lazy to care about their response. As such, he turned his body and left.

“Let’s leave,” Fortress Master Hong Tian waved his hands and he left with his twelve Almighties.

After they left, the hall burst into an uproar.

“How daring he is. This Jian Wushuang is really very daring!”

“Fight their way into the Deluge Fortress? Where did his courage come from?”

“Could it be that the Lineage of Star has planned to come out in full force? Even if that’s the case, they would still be unable to do anything against a battle array of thirteen Almighties. In particular, a super existence like the Fortress Master Hong Tian is present as well.”

“Unless the Star Palace Master and Jian Wushuang unleash the Secret Skill of Star Palace at all costs. However, the Star Palace Master seems to be under some restrictions of the Sanctuary Alliance. Hence, won’t he be unable to unleash the Secret Skill of Star Palace at will and go on a killing spree?”
