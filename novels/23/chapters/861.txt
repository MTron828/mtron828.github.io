Chapter 862: In the Fog Sea

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Let me say first.” Jiu Zui was the first to speak.

“I am good at attacking and killing, and most of my spearmanship involves combining strength and then detonating it, so my explosive power is very strong. My offensive power alone should be far above the top level of Step Six. My strongest shot can even kill the cultivators at peak Step Six.”

Jiu Zui spoke with complete confidence.

Obviously, he must have once killed an expert at peak Step Six.

Because of this, he had been ranked first among so many Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards.

“Jiu Zui, Shui Jin and I have seen how awesome your strongest shot is, which is indeed able to kill the top experts at Step Six. Of all of us, your offensive power is definitely the strongest.”

Ling Long laughed. “What I am best at is fighting with people. Even if I meet someone stronger than me, I can entangle him for a long time. And this year I used up all the points I had obtained from the tasks I completed and spent them on improving my life-saving ability, so now my life-saving ability is extremely strong.”

“Shui Jin, it’s your turn.”

“As for me, I am pretty balanced in all aspects. The only thing that is particularly strong is my body, which should be much stronger than anybody else’s. And with the Xue Ying Leather Armor, I can withstand anybody’s attack for a long time, even if they are stronger than me.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“In addition, I have a Secret Skill that can generate two doppelgangers in a short time, but these two doppelgangers contain less than 30% of the strength of the Original Body,” Shui Jin said.

Before they entered the Stellar Fog Sea, they hid little of their own abilities, except for those secrets that were the most important to them.

“Blood Mountain, what about you?” Jiu Zui and the other two all looked at Jian Wushuang.

“As for me...” Jian Wushuang mused for a moment before he spoke. “I’m good at swordsmanship. My ability to fight closely is very strong and my body speed is not bad. Besides, I have the consciousness attack method. Even the experts at the peak Step Six will have a temporary confusion of consciousness if I use the method suddenly.”

“Besides, I learned a new Killing Move this year. This Killing Move is very powerful and I believe few Eternal Realm experts can parry it.”

“Oh?” Jiu Zui and the others could not help but be surprised.

They all knew Jian Wushuang was still at the Divine Realm.

They already felt it was incredible that a Divine Realm expert could be so powerful, but now Jian Wushuang actually had a formidable Killing Move?

What was more, few Eternal Realm experts could parry it?

“I wonder which one is stronger, your Killing Move or my strongest attack?” Jiu Zui laughed.

Jian Wushuang also laughed, saying nothing. Both of them were absolutely confident in their own Killing Moves, and neither thought their own was weaker.

However, they had not tested it out.

“OK, we all have a rough knowledge of our abilities. Now we should set off,” Jiu Zui said.

“Uh-huh.” Jian Wushuang, Ling Long and Shui Jin all nodded in agreement.

Then without hesitation, the four strode straight toward the boundless Stellar Fog Sea.

A moment later, they had entered the confines of the sea.

As soon as they entered it, a large gray fog enshrouded them, and it was all they could see.

“The fog of this Stellar Fog Sea is quite weird. It can actually obscure my view. I can only see for a few kilometers,” Jiu Zui said in a deep voice.

Jian Wushuang, Ling Long and Shui Jin also were aware of this.

It should be known that they were all experts at peak Step Six with awesome strength, so they had very good eyesight.

But they could only see things within one kilometer, which obviously meant they were being greatly restricted.

“This Stellar Fog Sea is incomparably mysterious. We don’t know what’s in it. Everyone must be very careful,” Ling Long said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded, his eyes fixed on his surroundings.

No one knew what was in the Stellar Fog Sea at all because no one had ever really come out from it.

Like the Dao Master experts, they could only ever go around the perimeter.

The same was true for some of those who had mastered the Doppelganger Secret Skill. They wanted to send their doppelgangers in to investigate the Stellar Fog Sea, but they could only circle the perimeter and could not enter the core, just like those Dao Master experts.

Jian Wushuang and the others walked slowly and cautiously in the Stellar Fog Sea, not daring to go too quickly.

They walked on for several days, and did not encounter any danger or any living creatures.

The entire Stellar Fog Sea was deathly silent.

It was so silent that it was terrifying.

After they walked on for a few days, they reached a place where the fog around them was significantly thicker than before.

It was at least several times thicker.

“We must have entered the interior of the Stellar Fog Sea by now, right?”

“Good lord, the fog here is actually much thicker. With my eyesight, before, I could see things clearly for more or less about one kilometer, but now I can see only for about a hundred meters.”

“Me too.”

Their hearts grew heavy.

One hundred meters?

It was too short.

With such little visibility, if there was any danger ahead, they would not know before it was too late.

If they encountered a sudden attack, they would probably be dead before they saw its shadow.

“Jiu Zui, you come to the rear and I’ll go to the front,” Jian Wushuang said suddenly.

“You?” Jiu Zui gave Jian Wushuang a surprised look, but did not refuse.

Jian Wushuang walked at the front of the four-person squad, but did not rush. He took a deep breath, and the next moment, the scarlet mark between his eyebrows abruptly split open, and a very weird, upside-down bloody eye suddenly opened.

One of the three Ancient God Secret Skills, the Scarlet Eye!

The Scarlet Eye Secret Skill was the most unique of the three Ancient God Secret Skills.

Its effect was to see reality and illusion clearly. It could also penetrate the fog.

Jian Wushuang activated his Secret Skill. Now the Scarlet Eye was opened, he could see clearly for more than a kilometer.

“Follow me,” Jian Wushuang said.

The group was astonished to see the weird blood-red eye between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows, but they didn’t ask about it. Following Jian Wushuang, they slowly marched on.

Only moments later, Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped.

“There’s someone here.”

Jian Wushuang spoke slowly and his gaze intensified.
