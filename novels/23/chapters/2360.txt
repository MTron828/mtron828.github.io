Chapter 2361: The Decision of the Zhuge Family

Within the Zhuge Family, many experts were gathered together.

“Family Head, I have news from the Lin Mansion.” An elder in purple clothes walked in.

“How is it?” Zhuge Yuanchong looked over.

“Is Jian Wushuang dead?” Zhuge Hong asked.

The elder in purple clothes took a deep breath and said seriously, “Just like we predicted, Xiang Yi from the Golden Cauldron Sect is back. He is a tier two Chaotic Divine Demon and he brought along five experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect, including one tier two and four other tier three Chaotic Divine Demon. They attacked Lin Mansion directly and Xiang Yi went straight for Jian Wushuang.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Haha. He is definitely dead as a tier two Chaotic Divine Demon is after him!” Zhuge Hong said.

“It seems like this threat is settled.” Zhuge Yuanchong said.

“No, it is not as simple. Xiang Yi is indeed a tier two Chaotic Divine Demon and he attacked Jian Wushuang with all of his power. However, he was completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang during the fight which forced the five other experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect to help Xiang Yi out as well.”

“Six Chaotic Divine Demons?” Elder Chen, from the Dongzuo Sect, was surprised.

Six Chaotic Divine Demons, with two of them in the second tier, was a terrifying lineup.

“All six Chaotic Divine Demons from the Golden Cauldron Sect all attacked Jian Wushuang. However, Jian Wushuang had many trump cards and managed to defeat all six Chaotic Divine Demons head-on. He killed three of them and forced the remaining three to escape in fear.” The elder in purple clothes said.

“What did you say?”

The experts from the Zhuge Family and Dongzuo Sect were shocked beyond words.

Six Chaotic Divine Demons attacked were fought off by Jian Wushuang alone?

“You must be joking. Jian Wushuang is only in the Chaotic Realm. How can he be that powerful? Furthermore, the fighting power he showed three months ago is also far weaker than this.” Zhuge Hong roared with a low voice.

He was also a genius, but he couldn’t bring himself to believe what the elder in purple clothes said.

“I don’t know about the details, but it is a fact that he defeated six Chaotic Divine Demons and killed three of them. After the experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect left, one tier one Chaotic Divine Demon and two top tier tier two Chaotic Divine Demons from the Water Fairy Island arrived.” The elder in purple clothes said.

“After they appeared, they tested Jian Wushuang’s fighting power and no longer cared about the incident when Jian Wushuang killed a disciple of the Water Fairy Island. They immediately started trying to recruit Jian Wushuang to the Water Fairy island...”

The elder in purple clothes told the entire story of what happened next.

The experts from the Zhuge Family present were in disbelief and fell silent.

“Even the Great Compassion Sect sent their invitation to Jian Wushuang to become the lineal disciple of the ancient elder Brahman Sword Fairy who is the most powerful sword cultivator in the Wusha Barren Region and Jian Wushuang rejected that offer?”

“How can he reject it!!!”

Zhuge Hong stood up, his eyes were bloodshot.

The Great Compassion Sect is the most powerful clan in the Wusha Barren Region. It was where all the talented geniuses gathered!

Countless geniuses from the Wusha Barren Region would die to enter the Great Compassion Sect. However, they did not have the chance to join it.

Before Zhuge Hong joined the Dongzuo Sect, he really desired to enter the Great Compassion Sect. Even though he was talented, he was not good enough to make the cut to enter that clan. Hence, the Commandery Governor did not introduce him to the Great Compassion Sect.

He ended up at the Dongzuo Sect.

Even though he became one of the core disciples and had great status within the Dongzuo Sect, it did not mean that he lost his desire to join the Great Compassion Sect.

But now......

He tried his best but he did not make it into the Great Compassion Sect, while Jian Wushuang rejected an offer from the Great Compassion Sect?

How could he be calm?

As for the experts from the Zhuge Family present, they had serious looks on their faces.

“Jian Wushuang rejected the Great Compassion and became an outer disciple in the Water Fairy Island. Even so, the Water Fairy Island will definitely put emphasis to nurture Jian Wushuang. He will definitely become one of the most powerful experts within the Wusha Barren Region. The Zhuge family cannot withstand his wrath at that point in time.” Zhuge Yuanchong said.

“Even now, we cannot provoke him anymore. Lord Wu Jian from the Water Fairy Island had already said to the experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect he will personally settle any troubles or problems that Jian Wushuang will encounter. This also means that Lord Wu Jian will come to the Zhuge Family and wipe us out if Jian Wushuang asked him to.” The elder in purple clothes said.

When the experts from the Zhuge Family heard this, their face turned dark.

“Family Head of the Zhuge Family. The Water Fairy Island is a tough opponent. Even when the Dongzuo Sect faces the Water Fairy Island, we can only avoid conflicts and not dare to provoke them. The Zhuge Family is nothing in their eyes. If Jian Wushuang really wanted to take revenge on you, all he needs to do is to ask. The Water Fairy Island will not complain at all.” Elder Chen looked over and asked.

“Hence... Family head of the Zhuge Family, you should consider what I have told you.”

“I understand.” Zhuge Yuanchong nodded his head. He took a deep breath and said solemnly, “Prepare to go to the Lin Mansion. We will go and apologize!”

“Apologize?”

The experts from the Zhuge Family turned pale, but they couldn’t do anything but to shake their heads helplessly.

The Zhuge Family pissed off someone who they couldn’t afford to. Their life and death could be decided with a single action of that man.

If they would not put down their pride to apologize, they would be asking for it.

Soon, the experts from the Zhuge Family set off.

...

Lin Mansion.

“Brother Wushuang. My father wants me to tell you that the experts from the Zhuge Family are here.” Lin Yan ran up to Jian Wushuang and said.

“Zhuge Family? Are they here to apologize?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You guessed it. The family head of the Zhuge Family said that he is here to apologize to you. This is why my father asked you to go over.” Lin Yan said.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He was not surprised at all.

He was sure that the family head of the Zhuge Family, Zhuge Yuanchong, knew the predicament that his family was in.

This was why he did not annihilate the Zhuge Family.

“I will not go. Tell Uncle Lin to settle it. He should know what to do.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ok.” Lin Yan nodded his head and left immediately.
