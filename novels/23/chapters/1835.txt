Chapter 1836: War Exploded

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

They assumed that Jian Wushuang definitely needed to prepare elaborately before he barged into Deluge Fortress. Plus, Lineage of Star would definitely turn out in full strength.

Hence, they had been keeping a tight watch at Lineage of Star. They would immediately raise their guards when there was any movement.

But they had never expected that Jian Wushuang would find two Emperor Gods as his assistants within a year and come directly. On top of that, he didn’t use any power from Lineage of Star.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s sudden attack had caught them totally off guard.

“Humph, why are you panicking?”

Fortress Master Hong Tian harrumphed and he looked around coldly. “Although the formation has been broken and the experts that we have invited have yet to arrive, Jian Wushuang’s team formation is only three Emperor Gods plus four war puppets. With our power, we could totally be evenly matched. As for victory and defeat, it is still unknown.”

The Almighties became confident when they heard him.

It was true that Jian Wushuang’s sudden attack was beyond their expectations, but the experts that had come with Jian Wushuang weren’t many.

Including Jian Wushuang himself, there was only the fighting power of three Emperor Gods and four war puppets. They were thirteen Almighties teamed up. There were two Emperor Gods too, Fortress Master Hong Tian and Emperor God Bing Can. They could totally be evenly matched.

Then, the Almighties calmed down and their gazes grew cold. There was war intention that suddenly soared from their bodies too.

“Emperor God Liu Guang, I shall pass Fortress Master Hong Tian to you. Keep him occupied,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’m doing this personally. He doesn’t stand a chance to run free. However, are you sure that you only need me to suppress Fortress Master Hong Tian alone?” Emperor God Liu Guang asked in shock.

In terms of power, Emperor God Liu Guang was much stronger than Fortress Master Hong Tian.

If she were to use her full force, not only could she suppress Fortress Master Hong Tian, she could even be involved with other battles.

“You can just focus on not letting Fortress Master Hong Tian run free. As for the others…” Jian Wushuang smirked coldly and said, “I’ll take care of Emperor God Bing Can. The rest of the eleven Sir Gods will be taken care of by Emperor God Jiu Ying and the four Dao soldiers. No problem, right?”

“Eleven Sir Gods?” Emperor God Jiu Yin creased his eyebrows, “With four Dao soldiers, I should be able to match them evenly but I reckon I can’t sustain it for too long.”

“You don’t have to endure for long. A short while will do,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“If so, let’s do it,” Emperor God Liu Guang’s gaze grew cold.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and the murderous intention flooded out from his body like a rising tide.

His figure burst out in an instant.

“Kill them all!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian let out an angry roar and the thirteen Almighties’ aura spread vigorously as they took action at the same time.

The war exploded all of a sudden.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian, your opponent is me.”

Her cold voice reverberated in the universe. Emperor God Liu Guang was like a flowing light and her speed was terrifyingly fast, far beyond Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Jiu Ying’s. She appeared in front of Fortress Master Hong Tian at the first instant. At the same time, a resplendent, flowing light burst out and aimed at Fortress Master Hong Tian’s throat.

Fortress Master Hong Tian’s eyes dilated. He could belittle Emperor God Jiu Yin and also Jian Wushuang, but he definitely didn’t have the guts to belittle Emperor God Liu Guang.

“Humph!”

There was a cold humph and there were huge axes that appeared in Fortress Master Hong Tian’s both hands. The two huge axes were filled with terrifying rage. They were a pair originally. Judging from their auras, the pair of huge axes were obviously Chaotic Divine Treasures.

As one of the huge axes swung out, the flowing light that burst out instantly shattered.

“Go!” Emperor God Liu Guang pointed and the glaring light lit up the universe.

A white phoenix that showered under divine light substantiated. The white phoenix brought about threatening power that pierced the void and appeared in front of Fortress Master Hong Tian.

Fortress Master Hong Tian’s face grew in distress. Then, there was an ancient beast shadow that soared up behind him and his divine body grew tremendously to three meters tall. His imposing aura had suddenly increased to a new level as well.

He swung out two of his huge swords as though it could level mountain and blast cliff.

At the instant when the power exploded, Fortress Master Hong Tian roared, “Emperor God Liu Guang, we bear no grudges against each other. What did Jian Wushuang offer you?”

“Why would I tell you what he offered me?” Emperor God Liu Guang’s voice was cold.

“Regardless of what he offered, I’m willing to pay double the price for you to leave. What do you think?” Fortress Master Hong Tian said again.

“Double the price? Hehe, you can’t afford,” Emperor God Liu Guang didn’t want to waste any time with Fortress Master Hong Tian. In her hands, there was a pair of crystal-clear white gloves.

The aura given out by the white gloves was shocking. It was obviously a Chaotic Divine Treasure as well.

“D*mn it!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian’s face instantly changed.

When Emperor God Liu Guang and Fortress Master Hong Tian had fought, Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Jiu Yin and the four silver-armored Dao soldiers had been fighting with the other twelve Almighties too.

“Emperor God Bing Can!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and he locked his eyes on one person.

“Jian Wushuang!” Emperor God Bing Can’s gaze were unusually cold.

“Die,” Jian Wushuang’s murderous intention flashed. Although there was a good distance in between them, there were suddenly two resplendent golden lights next to him.

The two resplendent golden lights shook faintly and instantly pierced through the Spacetime. In the blink of an eye, they appeared before Emperor God Bing Can.

Emperor God Bing Can’s divine power churned and he didn’t dare to make any careless mistakes. There was a boundless chilliness that spread out of his body. The chilliness froze the surrounding void and the surrounding tens of thousands of miles turned into ice caves while the Emperor God Bing Can was the ruler of the ice cave.

“Slash!”

A saber filled with chilliness appeared in his hands. The direction where his blade light pointed at turned into frost.

The golden lights that burst out of the two Hong Jung Golden Sword collided with the blade light.

Dang! Dang!

There were two continuous clashes. Every clash contained a terrifying explosion of divine power that flowed out.

After the clash, Emperor God Bing Can’s body was the first that retreated and he retreated by almost ten thousand miles.

“Such a powerful force. The two golden lights contained the impact of an Emperor God each,” Emperor God Bing Can was shocked.

He was on the fifty-fourth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. There was some distance to Peak Emperor God.

However, he wasn’t too far from it. When he fought with a Peak Emperor God, he could withstand it for a bit.

Hence, when he had first fought with Jian Wushuang, he had had no scruples. However, when he fought with him then… Jian Wushuang’s power frightened him.

The two Hong Jung Golden Swords equaled an Emperor God’s power each. However, according to the information that he had obtained, speed was the scariest factor of Jian Wushuang’s two Hong Jun Golden Swords!!
