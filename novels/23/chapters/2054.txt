2055 Seventy Percent Winning Chance!

After the Great Emperors returned to Sanctuary Alliance, they immediately received the news about Jian Wushuang’s return. The Great Emperors were naturally surprised.

Although some of them had noticed something fishy, they didn’t say much.

Then, Emperor Bai hosted a victory banquet at the surrounding of the dark millstone.

The four-member experts’ troop that was sent into Three-Emperors World had destroyed the Emperor Supreme Rock and the dark millstone had stopped spinning. It could be described as destroying the sword above the head of countless cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World. With such a great contribution, they, of course, deserved a celebration.

The banquet was extremely grand, and some Emperor Gods participated too.

During the banquet, many experts, including those Great Emperors, toasted Jian Wushuang. Even Great Emperor Colored Glaze and Yan Zun, who had once held grudges against Jian Wushuang, were sincerely celebrating with him.

As for Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao, they contributed a lot too. They were well-respected.

After some drinking.

“Everyone,”

Emperor Bai suddenly stood up and looked at all the Great Emperors and Emperor Gods. “The biggest hero who stopped the dark millstone is Jian Wushuang. Secondly, it was Great Emperor Zhi Luo who passed away. Then, Abysmal and Jiu Qiao! Come, everyone! Let’s raise our glasses to the four of them!!”

Everyone at the scene raised their glasses.

Jian Wushuang stood up too. Then, he said in a deep voice, “To Great Emperor Zhi Luo, to Sanctuary Alliance, to Eternal Chaotic World!!!”

“To Great Emperor Zhi Luo!”

“To Sanctuary Alliance, to Eternal Chaotic World!”

All the experts repeated the words and drank the wine in their hands.

After they drank the last glass of wine, Emperor Bai said, “Although the dark millstone has stopped, Eternal Chaotic World’s danger has never been removed. Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace are still there, as well as the Three-Emperors World with countless experts. As they have already exposed themselves, they will definitely fight Eternal Chaotic World until the very end!”

“This war is inevitable!!”

“After today’s banquet, everyone please get ready soon. The final war between Eternal Chaotic World and Three-Emperors World will be here soon!!!”

“Go ahead!!”

Emperor Bai waved and everyone at the banquet was dismissed.

After the banquet ended, various sects and experts continued to prepare.

However, as the dark millstone had stopped, the preparation wasn’t as pressing as before.

On the other hand, Emperor Bai started investigating the matter about the double agent in Sanctuary Alliance.

The person that he focused on in his investigation was Great Emperor Zi Xu!

Of course, his investigation was done in secret. Besides the few of them, no one else had any idea.

…

Three-Emperors World, in the boundless dark void.

Leng Ruxue, Demon King Chen Yu, and the blurry blood man known as Kaiser Blood, the three of them gathered again.

“Years of hard work!!!”

“To prepare this dark millstone, all of us paid a great price and prepared for so many years. In the end, it was all destroyed in a day!!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Kaiser Blood’s voice was cold with boundless anger.

Demon King Chen Yu was naturally furious too

That was normal. The dark millstone was what they had intentionally prepared to wipe out all experts in Eternal Chaotic World. It was absolutely their killer move.

The moment they’d sent out their killer move, they could have made Eternal Chaotic World vanish without much effort.

For that, they had paid too great of a price and put in too great of an effort.

They’d taken years to prepare, just for that one day.

In the end, because of Jian Wushuang, their preparation had been in vain.

Of course, they could only blame themselves for belittling their enemy.

At first, they’d thought that the Emperor Supreme Rock was guarded by many Great Emperors in Imperial Peak and it would be perfectly safe. In addition, the Emperor Supreme Rock was sturdy itself. Without a certain level of power, it couldn’t be cracked. Hence, they hadn’t cared much about the four-members experts’ troop to begin with.

But they’d never expected that Jian Wushuang’s power as an inverse cultivator could be so outrageous. After he’d performed the Secret Skill of Star Palace, he’d exploded a power that had exceeded the power of a Great Emperor and destroyed the Emperor Supreme Rock.

Hence, it had led to such an outcome.

“It’s already happened. It’s too late to regret it. I’d rather we first think about what we should do next,” Leng Ru Xue who had been sitting the whole time suddenly spoke.

“What to do? What can we do?”

Demon King Chen Yu roared and his eyes were simmering with anger, “Even without the dark millstone, with the forces of Acheron Palace, Holocaust Sect and Three-Emperors World combined, we can fight head-on with Eternal Chaotic World too. On top of that, Acheron Palace is already immersed in the forces in Eternal Chaotic World. Our chances of winning are at least over seventy percent!”

“If so, what are we afraid of? Let’s fight head-on!!”

Leng Ruxue creased her eyebrows then she looked to Kaiser Blood.

“Chen Yu is right. Without the dark millstone, with the three of our forces combined, our winning chance is still extremely high. My only concern is that there will be more accidents and we will have to bear greater losses,” Kaiser Blood said.

“Humph, as long as we can destroy Eternal Chaotic World, we will achieve our final goal. So what if we suffer greater losses?” Demon King Chen Yu humphed coldly.

“That’s true,” Kaiser Blood nodded, “If so, let’s get ready immediately. My Three-Emperors World has conserved strength and built energy for so many years and they are so loyal to the three emperors. As soon as I send a command, the experts will immediately gather. On the other hand, the experts in Acheron Palace and Holocaust Sect, are they ready?”

“Don’t worry. The experts from my Acheron Palace are well-prepared,” Demon King Chen Yu said.

“My Holocaust Sect is ready too,” Leng Ruxue said.

“If so, tell them to rush over at their fastest possible speeds in order to form into a huge military force with the expert in Three-Emperors World. Then, let’s fight Eternal Chaotic World,” Kaiser Blood said.

“Alright,” Demon King Chen Yu and Leng Ruxue nodded heavily.

“Oh yeah, Demon King Chen Yu,” Kaiser Blood suddenly turned to look at Demon King Chen Yu, “In Three-Emperors World earlier, you fought with Emperor Bai.”

The corner of Demon King Chen Yu’s lips twitched when he heard Emperor Bai’s name but he nodded.

“You look like Emperor Bai taught you a lesson, huh?” Kaiser Blood sneered.

“Humph, Emperor Bai lives up to his name as the strongest man in Eternal Chaotic World. He is much stronger than me. No wonder Lord Fen was defeated. That’s normal,” Demon King Chen Yu humphed. Then, he lifted his head and said, “Kaiser Blood, don’t be too happy. Judging from Emperor Bai’s power, I’m afraid he is stronger than you too. If you were to run into him, it might not end well.”

“Oh? I’ll wait and see.”

Kaiser Blood smiled maliciously and there was an eerie crimson light that surged in his empty eye sockets.

The void went completely silent.
