4747 I’ll Take You to a Good Place

Without Jian Wushuang’s help, he would not have been able to walk steadily.

“Brother Jian, my good brother, you’re the only one by my side,” the Young Emperor murmured. ” I, Prince Yan, have never been as happy as I am today.”

“If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to ruthlessly trample on those guys to vent the hatred in my heart.”

“It’s you who gave me some hope.” The Young Emperor smiled and punched Jian Wushuang’s chest.

“In addition, I’ve already said that with the Emperor as a guarantor, everything is in sight.”

Smelling the faint fishy smell, Jian Wushuang took half a step back and said, “Sleep for a while. We’ll talk about other things when you’re awake.”

“We can’t sleep. Since we’re in the Wind-Listening Platform, I’ll take you to a good place.” With a meaningful smile on his face, the Young Emperor pulled Jian Wushuang and rushed forward with a goal in mind.

“Where are you going?”

“You’ll know later… It’s definitely a good place for you to linger.”

“…”

The ethereal peach forest that stretched for thousands of miles was left behind, replaced by green bamboo.

The entire Wind-Listening Platform was like the back garden of the Heavenly Court. It was extremely beautiful, and all the Immortals and Goddesses were playing in it.

Jian Wushuang, who was being led by the Young Emperor, was confused. He had a feeling that something bad was going to happen.

The further they went into the Wind-Listening Platform, the faint smell of incense began to appear in the misty clouds.

“Where are we going?” Jian Wushuang asked again and again.

The Young Emperor’s eyes became more and more hazy. “It’s a good place. It’s definitely a place you’ll like. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. I’ll take you there today.”

Jian Wushuang stopped talking and followed him.

When the clouds receded, a beautiful peach garden with a myriad of flowers appeared in front of them.

The Young Emperor seemed to be a little impatient. The two of them stopped at the peak of a small mountain.

“Brother Jian, please follow me.”

They were only a few dozen steps away from the peak, but the Young Emperor rushed up to the peak in one big stride. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang followed closely behind. At the same time, he was suspicious of what could make him so excited.

Jian Wushuang strode to the peak and looked ahead.

With just one glance, his eyes were completely wide open, revealing disbelief.

After crossing the mountain peak, they saw that there were nearly a thousand Goddesses taking a bath in the clear river water that was like an Immortal Source…

It was a beautiful scene.

The sounds of frolicking like silver bells reverberated in the valley. They were teasing each other, like real Fairies coming out of the bath.

With just a glance, Jian Wushuang hurriedly squatted down and completely hid in the Immortal grass and divine flowers.

“Did you drink too much fake wine? Is this a place we can come to?” Jian Wushuang was furious that the Young Emperor had brought him to this place.

The Young Emperor’s hazy eyes were also filled with confusion. He rubbed his eyes hard and stared at it for a while before he mumbled, “This shouldn’t be. Why am I here…”

“Let’s hurry up and leave.” Obviously, Jian Wushuang did not want to stay here any longer. If he was discovered, it was a small matter for his reputation to be damaged, but it would be bad if he was caught and beaten up…

These seemingly delicate and beautiful Fairies were all real Yan Immortals.

The Young Emperor nodded in a daze, and the two got up and prepared to run.

“Aiya, who stepped on my hair?!”

The two of them froze on the spot and slowly turned around.

Behind him, in the midst of the colorful flowers, a little flower Immortal was rubbing her head and waking up.

…

Their eyes met, and a cry of surprise rang out throughout the entire valley.

“Sis, it’s them. They were peeking at you guys while you were bathing!”

At that moment, little flower Immortal pointed at Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor with her hands on her hips.

At the same time, nearly a thousand Fairies who had come ashore from the water had already leaped onto the peak of the mountain, blocking the two of them in the middle.

They all had unfriendly expressions and murderous gazes, as if they wanted to eat them alive.

“This is a huge misunderstanding. We accidentally entered this place. We’ll leave now.” Jian Wushuang looked embarrassed. It was obvious that he could not even convince himself with such an excuse.

Then, the Young Emperor closed his eyes and fell asleep.

“Sister, don’t believe their nonsense. I’ve already seen that Prince Yan is a pervert. Do you believe that they came here by accident? It was clearly planned for a long time!” a Fairy dressed in a thin purple robe raised her eyebrows and said angrily.

Another yellow-robed Fairy said in embarrassment, “I’ve long known that the Emperor’s Eldest Prince is not a good person. Cheng Qing, who is by his side, is not a good person either. Naturally, he is not a good person either!”

“Right, we can’t let them go!” All the Fairies agreed.

However, at the very front of these Goddesses, there was an older but energetic white-robed Fairy who did not say anything. Her nose twitched slightly as she had already detected the smell of alcohol on the Young Emperor.

“Did he drink?” the white-robed Fairy maiden asked.

Jian Wushuang nodded, “We had some drinks in the peach forest before, so we accidentally came here. I hope you can forgive us.”

The white-robed Fairy did not seem to want to make things difficult for the two of them. After looking at Jian Wushuang carefully, she said slowly, “You may be spared from death, but you can’t escape punishment. Whether it’s unintentional or sincere, you won’t be able to escape today’s beating!”

“Sisters, vent your anger and beat them to death!”

“…”

Jian Wushuang moved at once. He ran with all his strength!

The Young Emperor, who was pretending to be asleep, sobered up after hearing this. He fled from the sea of flowers at a speed not much slower than Jian Wushuang’s.

However, there were simply too many of them. In order to pursue the two of them, they even used all sorts of divine abilities.

Even a random punch from these Immortal cultivators could kill an old master, not to mention these embarrassed and angry ladies…

A beating was already set in stone.

…

“Don’t touch me, my face still hurts.”

In a pavilion on a mountain peak, two figures in black clothes were sitting side by side on the roof.

“Brother Jian, it’s indeed my fault. I apologize to you… I can’t drink in the first place, but the smell of alcohol got to me, so I didn’t know how I somehow brought you to the place where they took a bath…”

“But heaven and earth can be my witness. I have no intention of peeking. I have really gone to the wrong place.”

“Shut up, let the past be the past.”

“… Also, brother Jian, I’m really not a pervert.”

“…”

On the roof of the pavilion, two figures looked at each other speechlessly. If one looked closely, their originally handsome faces had long been swollen, and they had suffered some real external injuries.
