4318 Battle of the Gods (Part 2)

The entire universe seemed to have fallen into a boiling chaos.

Countless words could be used to describe the horror of this battle!

Countless holes appeared in the sky, and the ground was constantly being shattered!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

!!

Supreme Heavenly Dipper’s expression was cold and detached. Every arrow that was shot out blocked the escape routes of the seven great Rulers, leaving bloody holes in their bodies!

The battle between the Blood Wave Supreme, the South Sea Supreme, and the Blood Sky Palace’s Deputy Palace Master was even more terrifying!

At this moment, everyone finally realized how terrifying the Ruler Blood Wave was!

3,000 great daos emerged from the Blood Wave Supreme’s body and turned into a world of corpses and blood. The divine bodies of South Sea Supreme and the Deputy Palace Master of Blood Sky Palace were continuously destroyed as they cried out in pain.

South Sea Supreme and the Deputy Hall Master of Blood Sky Hall were both high-level and top-tier Supremes in the universe, but they were unable to retaliate against the Blood Wave Supreme. They were constantly defeated and were in imminent danger.

Although the Blood Wave Supreme was only a top-tier Supreme, he was much stronger than ordinary top-tier Supremes in terms of combat power!

Although he seemed to be in a difficult position when he faced the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple, he had an overwhelming advantage when he was facing a Supreme-being of the same realm!

The battle had entered a state of slaughter from the very beginning.

With Supreme Heavenly Dipper cutting off their escape route, the seven great Supremes were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered, constantly being slaughtered!

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath. At that moment, his divine power had finally recovered completely.

Immediately after, he turned his gaze to the master of Lotus Island, the acrid and mean old woman.

No one knew if it was intentional or not, but Supreme Blood Wave and the others had made the old woman stay.

“You, should die!”

Jian Wushuang looked at the old woman coldly.

When the old woman heard this, her expression changed and she shrieked, “Jian Wushuang, what are you doing?”

Jian Wushuang did not answer. Instead, he raised the Tarot Divine Sword and swept it toward the old woman.

When the old woman saw this, a cold light flashed in her eyes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She understood that the situation had already been decided. If there were no accidents, she would not be able to escape death.

The only chance of survival was Jian Wushuang.

If he wanted to live, there was only one way, and that was to abduct Jian Wushuang and threaten the five lead Supremes of the Divine Life Palace to let him leave.

Thinking of this, a cold sneer appeared on the old woman’s face. She muttered to herself, “Jian Wushuang, Oh Jian Wushuang, since you’re looking for death, don’t blame me.”

Bang!

As soon as she finished speaking, the old woman turned over her right hand and took out a lotus lamp from her interspatial ring.

There was no fire on the lotus lamp, but there was a flirtatious Red Lotus swaying slightly, emitting a faint red light, reflecting the old woman’s face, making it even uglier.

Slash!!!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and his black hair was flying in the air. He slashed the Tarot Divine Sword at the old woman!

A brilliant sword pressure descended, instantly snatching away all the brilliant light in the area. Like a river of stars, it pressed down on the old woman!

This sword cut across the sky and pierced through the sun and moon!

Looking at the dazzling Tarot Divine Sword, the old woman’s eyes were filled with surprise. Then, the surprise in her eyes was replaced by regret.

“Old friend, I’m counting on you this time.”

She looked down at the red lotus lamp in her hand and muttered to herself. With a push of her hands, the red lotus lamp immediately shot out and shone brightly in the air.

Countless rays of red light shot out, like the sunset glow at night, painting the starry sky a gorgeous red.

The lotus core of the red lotus lamp suddenly expanded in the wind and turned into a towering red lotus that connected heaven and earth.

The next moment!

Bang!

The Tarot Divine Sword ruthlessly slashed at the red lotus!

A strange scene appeared. After the Tarot sword struck the red lotus, the red lotus suddenly began to absorb the endless power of the Tarot sword like a balloon.

“What?”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.

Kacha! Kacha!

In the next moment, the lotus lamp started to crack.

It was like a bucket with a sealed mouth that was constantly filled with water. Finally, it could not take it anymore and exploded!

Bang!

With a wail, the towering lotus flower broke into pieces!

The power of the Tarot Divine Sword had also disappeared.

Seeing this, a touch of resentment flashed across the old woman’s face. She stared at Jian Wushuang and said coldly, “Jian Wushuang, you’ve caused my treasure to be destroyed. You deserve to die!”

After she finished speaking, the old woman laughed and countless Red Lotus fire surged around her and rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised, but he didn’t panic. This time, when he used the Tarot Divine Sword, he didn’t use all of his divine power. He still had some power left, which was enough to deal with the old woman.

Just as the old woman was about to catch Jian Wushuang and he was about to use the Daybreak sword to end her life.

Pfft!

...

The sound of an arrow breaking through the air rang out.

A spear-like scarlet arrow broke through the void and pierced through the divine body of the Lotus Island master. Along with the remaining force, it was sent flying!

“Ah!”

“Arghh!” The old woman screamed in pain. Divine power burst out from the Scarlet arrow and shattered her divine body.

The master of Lotus Island had fallen!

In the distance, Supreme Heavenly Dipper looked at Jian Wushuang and smiled. “Little fellow, that Red Lotus was born from the primordial chaos and is capable of withstanding a world-destroying blow. It can be considered a life substitution talisman. Be careful.”

Jian Wushuang nodded at him gratefully.

After the time for one incense stick to burn.

Supreme Giant Axe was the first to end the battle. He turned around and strode in the direction of the Blood Wave Supreme’s battle.

After the time for three incense sticks to burn.

At this point, other than the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple, the other six great Supremes had been completely massacred by the Joint Forces of Supreme Blood Wave and the others!

...

At this moment, the cold wind whimpered and the great Dao wailed. It was as if the heavens and earth were mourning for the six great Rulers.

The fall of six great masters, how shocking was this?

Once it was spread, the entire universe would be shaken!

After killing their respective opponents, Supreme Giant Axe, Supreme Blood Wave, and the other two stopped and looked into the distance with their hands behind their backs.

There were only two people there.

The Hall Master of Cosmos Temple and Supreme Master Gai Fu!

At this moment, the expression of the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple was extremely ugly. He was no longer as calm as before and was staring at Supreme Master Gai Fu with fear in his eyes.

“Gai Fu, you can’t even protect yourself now. Do you really want to waste your chance to attack for Jian Wushuang?!”

The Palace Master of Cosmos Temple growled.

Supreme Master Gai Fu’s expression was neither happy nor sad when he heard this. He did not reply and only extended a finger to point at the great Cosmos Temple master’s glabella.

Rumble!

In an instant, a destructive aura that seemed to come from the ancient times, which caused the universe to perish, the chaos to boil, and the great Dao to be annihilated, rose in the void and slowly condensed!
