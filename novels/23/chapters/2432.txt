Silence!

The huge battlefield fell into a deathly silence.

The various sects’ genius disciples on the battlefield instinctively stopped dead in their tracks with all their eyes fixed on the head that flew out with astonishment.

They were stunned exactly because all of them knew full well who the owner of that head belonged.

The fight had been going on with many sacrificed and it made no difference if another person died.

However, it was still shocking that Pang Tao, who ranked sixth among the Twelve Minor Kings was dead!

“Dead! Pang Tao is dead?”

“How is this possible?”

Everyone was in disbelief.

The scene sent everyone into a state of stupor.

Countless sets of eyes turned towards the young man who walked towards Pang Tao’s body.

The young man who held a sword in one hand was only exuding the divine powers of a Peak Chaotic Realm.

Nevertheless, everyone witnessed that Pang Tao was beheaded by this man in Peak Chaotic Realm.

Jian Wushuang soon arrived next to Pang Tao’s headless body.

He swept his eyes over the body and noticed a token which was held tightly in his palm, that token was Pang Tao’s Safety Token.

A moment ago, Pang Tao sensed danger while exchanging blows with Jian Wushuang. He reacted by taking out his Safety Token and was about to crush it.

Unfortunately, his actions were too slow.

He was just a small step away from saving himself by crushing the Safety Token in his hand.

However, he died.

Under Jian Wushuang’s sword, he did not even have the chance to crush his lifesaving Safety Token before dying.

“Even having a Safety Token can’t save his life.”

Jian Wushuang smirked and took away Pang Tao’s Safety Token and Interspatial Ring. He then waved his hand, and Pang Tao’s body fell downward.

The people around had yet to recover from their daze.

Especially Zhuo Bing and Zhong Yi who was even more shocked than ever.

The disciples of the Great Compassion Sect were the ones who reacted first.

“Jian Wushuang, you... You killed Senior Brother Pang Tao! Just wait! We from the Great Compassion Sect will never let you go!” A First-Class Divine Demon from Great Compassion Sect shrieked.

Jian Wushuang raised his brows and gave the First-Class Divine Demon a side-eye and scoffed, “Life and death are normal in battles for opportunities. Are you suggesting that only the Great Compassion Sect is allowed to wantonly kill someone from other sects, but disciples from other sects aren’t allowed to retaliate?”

“If you are so free to be up there talking nonsense, you might as well avenge Pang Tao now. Of course, it depends if you can do so.”

The First-Class Divine Demon was stunned by Jian Wushuang’s rebuttal and was at a loss for words.

He indeed had no guts to fight against Jian Wushuang.

He was not alone. The genius disciples from various sects around him were terrified of Jian Wushuang.

It was no joke since even Pang Tao died in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Pang Tao was killed almost instantly without a chance to crush his Safety Token and escape.

What kind of power was that?

Noticing the people’s expressions around him, Jian Wushuang faintly smiled and went over to Zhuo Bing. “Big Sister, you haven’t given away the position token, right?”

“No, I haven’t,” replied Zhuo Bing.

“That’s good. It’s yours since you got it. I’ll kill whoever that dares to snatch it.” Jian Wushuang was obviously saying that to the genius disciples around him.

Those genius disciples were greedy for the position token in Zhuo Bing’s hand.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s warning, all of them were hesitating if it was worth snatching.

They were fearful of Jian Wushuang.

“Why is Jian Wushuang so strong?”

“I heard that he was able to duel Second-Class Divine Demons at the early stages of the Chaotic Realm. Now that he has reached Peak Chaotic Realm, he’s definitely stronger than before. How come he is so strong? Even Pang Tao was killed with a single wave of his sword with no chance to crush his Safety Token. How terrifying is that?”

“I also think that Pang Tao’s combat powers are a bit too much for a Peak Chaotic Realm to handle, maybe Jian Wushuang was just lucky? Could it be that Pang Tao was careless?”

“Yes, it’s possible.”

Those genius disciples were whispering.

Jian Wushuang’s beheading of Pang Tao shook the world.

The sword movement was so fast that only a handful of people could see it. It was inevitable that many thought it was by mere luck that he killed Pang Tao.

Motivated by the opportunities that came along with a position token, none of those disciples wanted to give it up so easily.

After a round of discussion, many people looked at Jian Wushuang with their cold and menacing eyes.

They had to attempt...

Hum!

A dark light beam appeared behind Jian Wushuang without warning.

The dark light beam did not only strangely appear out of nowhere but was also extremely fast with overwhelming power.

That sneak attack was made by a reputable First-Class Divine Demon. He was overjoyed seeing that the dark light beam reached less than ten meters behind Jian Wushuang.

“It’s done!”

That First-Class Divine Demon let out a low laugh as the dark light beam penetrated Jian Wushuang’s figure.

However, there were no traces of blood after it went through the figure, and in the next moment, Jian Wushuang’s figure slowly dissipated.

“No good!”

The First-Class Divine Demon’s expression who did that sneak attack on Jian Wushuang turned ugly. He immediately took out his Safety Token and got ready to crush it.

Whizz!

A purple light flashed and disappeared quickly, no one knew when it appeared or where it came from.

Immediately after the purple light disappeared, another head flew out.

That First-Class Divine Demon was also too late in crushing his Safety Token.

Such a case was normal as having the Safety Token would only allow one to have a life-saving chance in the tomb but it did not guarantee that one would not die.

In the end, a few moments were needed to take out a Safety Token and crushed it. Oftentimes, crisis suddenly came so fast that one could not react in time and crush their Safety Token before being killed. In such cases, the Safety Token was left unused.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang’s sword was fast approaching.

The First-Class Divine Demon that followed Pang Tao was also killed by Jian Wushuang and both did not crush their Safety Token in time.

A First-Class Divine Demon was killed again with just a single movement of his sword. It dampened the spirit of those genius disciples around to snatch the position token.

All of them appeared to be frightened by Jian Wushuang.

If they thought Jian Wushuang was just lucky when he previously killed Pang Tao, everyone could now realize that it was not a mere coincidence with another First-Class Divine Demon killed.

Jian Wushuang had horrifying powers!
