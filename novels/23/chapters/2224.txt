Chapter 2225 It Begins

“My gosh!”“Luckily we retreated far away, if not...”

“Too terrifying... the huge city disappeared in a blink of an eye!”

The many cultivators that had retreated to the edges of the city were horrorified as they watched the sea of fire sweep over the city.

In the middle of that sea of fire, the burly man, now with a flaming axe, was the lord within the sea of fire.

To the side, the black-haired man took out a black spear, his entire being looking as though it had morphed into a black hole that devoured everything.

The auras of both of them reached their maximum.

“This aura feels like... pinnacle Third Stage, stronger than Lord Fen but not Kaiser Blood levels,” Jian Wushuang’s lips were raised.

He was referring to Kaiser Blood, Blood Emperor’s consciousness embodiment.

The consciousness embodiment Kaiser Blood was already at pinnacle Third Stage, yet Emperor Bai could easily suppress him.

These two people were not even at Kaiser Blood’s level.

“Sword Emperor, for the last time, will you let go of Xie Yu?” the black-haired man’s voice became cold.

“Nope,” Jian Wushuang gently shook his head.

“You wanna die?” The black-haired man’s face darkened.

“Kill him already!” The burly man was extremely bloodthirsty, and without hesitation, both experts made their moves.

The two great Ancient Era experts had not much intention to clash with experts of the current era.

Their intentions were much simpler.

They simply wanted to restore their strength peacefully, and once the time was up, head for Heaven’s Horizon.

But not wanting to clash with the current era’s experts did not mean that they feared them.

At least they did not fear Jian Wushuang.

From the information they had had received, the scariest expert around was Emperor Bai.

And Jian Wushuang... even though he had been critical in the fight between the Three Emperors World 20,000 years ago.

Jian Wushuang had been able to release such power due to his trump card, and it would be hard to use it again.

Jian Wushuang’s true power seemed to be at pinnacle Chaotic Realm in their opinion, nothing more than an ordinary Third Stage Great Emperor.

But their fighting power were both pinnacle Third Stage. If they teamed up, they could even fight Emperor Bai, what was a Sword Emperor going to do to stop them?

“I gave you a chance, don’t blame us,” the black-haired man shouted and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. A terrifying dark aura came bursting out as his black spear pierced forward.

Howl!

A dragon’s cry resonated.

A huge dark dragon appeared, circling around that spear, while that eerie spear was sparkling in front of the chest of Jian Wushuang.

The horrifying speed and explosive power of that spear seemed menacing.

Yet Jian Wushuang had no intention of dodging.

The next moment, the black spear went straight through his body, but no flesh or blood could be seen.

Jian Wushuang’s body gradually turned into nothing.

“What?” the black-haired man’s face darkened, immediately locking eyes with Jian Wushuang at the Void not far away.

“That was fast, that kid actually got a bit of Spacetime Rules, and he knows how to use it well,” the black-haired man was shocked.

What he did not know was that Jian Wushuang had practised in the tower for a thousand years. While practising with the experts, he had mastered both swordsmanship and Rules of Order.

Thousands of years of slaughter had improved his swordsmanship and his Rules of Order.

He had dodged the spear with Spacetime Rules of Order.

“Die!” The monstrous voice could be heard everywhere.

The burly man with the flaming axe struck down at Jian Wushuang’s side, but before the axe could come down, the rising heat could have been felt first. If it had been any ordinary expert or even a Great Emperor, the heat alone would have stopped breaths and made them lose all ability to resist.

But Jian Wushuang was not affected by it all, and threw a punch.

Peng!

The huge axe and fist crashed head-on.

Based on how sharp the axe was, it should have cut off Jian Wushuang’s entire hand.

But in fact, Jian Wushuang’s hand was not affected at all and the power of his hand even passed on towards the burly man.

The burly man could feel a sharp pain in his arm.

“That power...” Shocked, the burly man retreated, and soon the sea of fire started retreating, the man was now covered by the burning flames.

Like a flaming giant, he raised his axe again.

“Flaming axe!”

Hua!

Hua!

Hua!

Three axe strikes were made, every move coming with boundless flame.

“Hngh!” Jian Wushuang snorted without fear and threw out three punches with his right fist.

Peng!

Peng!

Peng!

Three explosions then followed the retreating body of the burly man.

After a while, he composed himself.

“Damn it, the restrictions on this earth are too strong, I threw thirteen axe blows at him, but only the weakest three came out. If I could throw my sixth axe out, I would definitely cut the dude in two,” the burly man growled. He was dejected.

As an Ancient Era expert, Chaotic Realm powers had been nothing to him in the past, but now he could only demonstrate Chaotic Realm powers himself.

It never felt good to be restricted so tightly.

Xiu!

The black-haired man appeared beside the burly man.

“Watch out, Sword Emperor is stronger than we thought,” black-haired man.

“I know,” the burly man nodded, and his face stiffened.

Jian Wushuang watched the two people regather, and a smile was on his face.

“Both of you are not bad, much better than Xie Yu, worthy for me to pull out my sword.” Under that devious smile, the Blood Mountain Sword showed in his hand once again.

The sword was out.

He was finally getting serious.
