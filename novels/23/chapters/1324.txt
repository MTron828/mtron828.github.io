Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Now his Divine Power is equal to a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven?”

“It is because of the Inverse Cultivation!”

“The legendary Inverse Cultivation!”

Master of the Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang were both amazed by Jian Wushuang.

Universe God Jiu Hai was only the primary-level Universe God in the Second Heaven. And Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power skyrocketed as he roared, causing severe injuries of the formal one.

“Universe God Jiu Hai.”

Jian Wushuang glanced at him, “I have given you the opportunity but it’s you who hasn’t seized it.”

Hearing the words, Universe God Jiu Hai was furious, but he could do nothing about it.

Nothing.

He also knew that today was the only opportunity for him.

And it was unrealistic for him to take revenge in the future.

Even if Jian Wushuang didn’t leave the Dayu Universe, his power would further develop to a level far beyond Universe God Jiu Hai.

Now Universe God Jiu Hai fell into silence.

And Jian Wushuang now shifted his attention to someone else.

“Golden-sun Sect Master!” Jian Wushuang said.

Golden-sun Sect Master, the thin elderly man with a golden robe looked toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang said to him immediately, “You once asked me whether your son was killed by me. Now, my answer is YES.”

Golden-sun Sect Master looked at Jian Wushuang with a murderous look.

“Want to kill me?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“You are doomed to die!” Golden-sun Sect Master got infuriated and jumped at him immediately.

Everyone felt surprised!

Soon after Jian Wushuang defeated Universe God Jiu Hai, he was now challenging Golden-sun Sect Master!

But Golden-sun Sect Master, as the Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven, was much more powerful than Universe God Jiu Hai.

“Why does Jian Wushuang keeping challenging those powerful Universe Gods?” Talents from the Scarlet Island felt confused, including the Scarlet Island Master.

It was clear why Jian Wushuang had challenged Universe God Jiu Hai. They had an old score to settle.

But why did he choose to fight with Golden-sun Sect Master?

Golden-sun Sect Master had been unsure about whether Jian Wushuang killed his son. And now, Jian Wushuang admitted it, giving Golden-sun Sect Master an excuse to killhim.

Scarlet Island Master didn’t think it was a wise choice.

But he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang did so in order to know what level he was now.

Only by battling with powerful Universe Gods could he know how far he had gone.

Jian Wushuang didn’t use much effort to defeat Universe God Jiu Hai.

That was why he had turned to Golden-sun Sect Master.

Jian Wushuang felt excited to battle with this Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven.

“I will kill you!” Golden-sun Sect Master took action without any hesitation, forming a horrible power immediately.

A strong pressure came to Jian Wushuang.

“A Peak Universe God is indeed superior to a primary one.” Jian Wushuang smiled, without any fear. “Come on!”

Boom!

His Divine Power was soaring.

Fully ready and aggressive, Jian Wushuang collided instantly with Golden-sun Sect Master.

The latter, wearing a pair of golden gloves, collected all his Divine Power and beat Jian Wushuang in the instant of collision.

Bang!

After that, with a resounding tiger roar, the shadow of a giant golden tiger appeared behind Golden-sun Sect Master and slapped Jian Wushuang with its palm.

In response, Jian Wushuang operated his power of the Ancient God and the four stars between his eyebrows were shining.

He clenched his hands and a horrible power broke out.

The power, which was strong enough to smash the heavens, collided directly with the flap from Golden-sun Sect Master.

Bang!

In the collision, a tremendous Divine Power spread all around them, forming numerous power waves.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were bursting with lightning.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

And he gave three punches, combing the Divine Power and the Ancient God Power perfectly. Every punch contained a deadly force.

Golden-sun Sect Master immediately responded, as fast as a thunder.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Golden-sun Sect Master was hit back by the three collisions, while Jian Wushuang stood still and resisted the great power.

Golden-sun Sect Master exclaimed after he finally stood stably, “How powerful it is!”

Actually Golden-sun Sect Master didn’t use any secret skills. instead, he confronted Jian Wushuang only with his Divine Power. And it turned out that Jian Wushuang had the advantage over him.

Jian Wushuang, only a Universe God in the First Heaven, unleashed a power stronger than a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven!

Jian Wushuang was delighted about his power.

“With the Inverse Cultivation, combining the three most powerful swordsmanships, I am one hundred times more powerful than the Peak Universe God in the First Heaven. With the help of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, my Divine power is now equal to the Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven. I am also a Five-star Royal Ancient God. When my power roars, I can easily defeat Golden-sun Sect Master!”

Jian Wushuang was ecstatic.

Jian Wushuang was only a Universe God in the First Heaven.

But he had unleashed a power stronger than a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven!

“Use all your power or you will be defeated!”

Jian Wushuang laughed resoundingly.
