Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Demon Master Chen Huo?”

After Jian Wushuang said the name of the sloppy old man, the sloppy old man fell into deep thought.

“Demon Master Chen Huo… It’s so familiar, so familiar. Yes, yes, that’s my name, I’m Demon Master Chen Huo!” The sloppy old man’s eyes flashed with a fierce light, after thinking of his name, a large amount of memories and thoughts flooded in.

After all, Demon Master Chen Huo was a powerful Principles Master. It was only because he had waited for so long in this secret realm of heaven and earth that he gradually forgot himself and began to forget everything, however, these things that he forgot would form memories that would remain in his

mind.

As long as he was reminded, these memories would be recalled one by one.

“Tam the Amethyst Demon Sect’s Demon Master Chen Huo. That is my root. When I was young, master had led me into the Demon Sect and taught me with great care. I did well. In less than 100,000 years, I broke through to become the Principles Master and became the number one genius of the

Amethyst Demon Sect. In the following 200,000 years, I made a name for myself in the Divine Beginning Realm, letting everyone in the Divine Beginning Realm know my name, Demon Master Chen Huo!”

“My master is also very pleased with my achievements. The elders in the sect, the Sect Master, are also full of expectations for me. As long as I improve my strength, the overall strength of the Amethyst Demon Sect will be able to completely surpass those great sects in Third Heaven.”

“Originally, everything was developing in a good direction. However, one day, a disaster arrived!”

“The Flame Saint Realm is the Flame Saint Realm!”

“They attacked our Amethyst Demon Sect and massacred our experts. My master, the sect master, and many top experts of our purple star demon sect were annihilated in that battle. Among the many elders, I was the only one who brought the final hope of the Amethyst Demon Sect’s rise to power. I lay

dormant in this secret realm of heaven and earth…”

“Flame Saint Realm! Damned Flame Saint Realm!”

“A bunch of trash, they all deserve to die!”

The sloppy old man, who was the Demon Master Chen Huo, had a look of delight on his face when he spoke at the beginning. However, as he spoke, his voice became more and more impassioned, and his face became redder and redder. In the end, his eyes turned scarlet, he became completely crazed!

“Kill, Kill!”

“People from the Flame Saint Realm deserve to die!”

Boom!

A world-shaking killing intent crazily burst out of Demon Master Chen Huo.

The aura emitted by Demon Master Chen Huo reached a new level at this moment. This level was enough to make experts like Marquis Xiaoyao and Jian Wushuang tremble in fear.

“Oh no!”

“This Demon Master is completely crazy!”

“He has been alone in the secret land of heaven and earth for nearly 200 million years. It’s fine if he forgot his memory before, but now that he remembered it with a towering hatred, it’s no wonder he’s crazy!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was unsightly. At this moment, he saw the crazy Demon Master suddenly let out a roar. The roar shook the sky and tore the void in an instant, forming a terrifying shock wave, it swept wildly in all directions.

“Just a roar, and it tore through space?” Jian Wushuang was shocked, but he immediately shouted, “Be careful, retreat quickly!”

In fact, without Jian Wushuang’s reminder, the experts from both the Temporal Temple and the Xiaoyao Mansion had already retreated far away when they saw Demon Master sunk into madness and recalled his terrifying strength.

They stood in the distance and watched in horror as the shock wave created by Demon Master Chen Huo’s roar shattered many palaces and pavilions in the secret realm of heaven and earth and razed the entire building complex to the ground.

“What’s wrong with Demon Master Chen Huo? It’s fine that he’s mad, but how could he be so powerful?” Marquis Xiaoyao was the most terrified among them. He had fled to the edge of the secret realm of heaven and earth, he looked at the Demon Master from afar.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was not far away from Marquis Xiaoyao, and his face was very solemn. “According to the information, when the Flame Saint Realm destroyed the Amethyst Demon Sect, Demon Master Chen Huo was only a rule master of the void four realms. At most, he was at the peak of the

void four realms. But now, the strength he displayed…” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had injured Marquis Xiaoyao in one move and almost killed him.

With a roar, he shattered the void.

Even experts at the peak of the five void realms or even the five void realms could not achieve such terrifying strength.

Obviously, the strength of this Demon Master was at least at the level of the six void realms. As for what level he was at among the six void realms, it was unknown. However, Jian Wushuang guessed that…the Demon Master must be very strong among the six realms of the void!

It was quite normal for him to advance from the peak of the fourth realm of the void to the sixth realm of the void in nearly 200 million years.

However, don’t forget the environment that Demon Master was in!

He had been staying in this secret realm of heaven and earth and was completely isolated from the outside world. There were no opportunities, no experiences, and he could not even interact with anyone. There was only boredom and loneliness.

In such an environment, ordinary people would have long gone mad, not to mention trying to find ways to improve their strength.

Moreover, even if he could stabilize his mind and cultivate, he could still improve his strength very slowly by immersing himself in cultivation and not having any contact with the outside world, once he encountered a bottleneck, he might be trapped there and could not improve at all.

For example, although Jian Wushuang occasionally went into closed-door cultivation, he would not stay in it for too long because he knew that blindly cultivating in closed-door cultivation was far from being comparable to his adventures outside.

And this Demon Master Chen Huo had stayed in such a crazy environment for nearly 200 million years, yet his strength could still increase so much. It was indeed impressive.

“A genius elder is indeed a genius!” Jian Wushuang secretly exclaimed.

In the era when the Amethyst Demon Sect was still in existence, the Demon Master Chen Huo’s talent could not be compared with his perfect life, but it was still very impressive. He became a Principles Master in less than 100,000 years, he reached the fourth void realm in less than 300,000 years.

Such a speed of improvement could make countless top geniuses in the Divine Beginning Realm look up to him.

“However, this genius elder is a bit tricky now.” Jian Wushuang frowned and looked at the crazy Demon Master in the void in front of him.

‘The eyes of the Demon Master were scarlet and filled with shocking killing intent. It seemed that he wanted to kill everyone here, and he really had such strength.

“Tt seems that I have to find a way to calm him down first.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.
