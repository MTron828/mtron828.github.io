2019 Suppress

In Three-Emperors World, Jian Wushuang and the three Great Emperors had rested for more than half a month. Jian Wushuang’s divine power had been completely recovered.

As for Emperor Jiu Qiao, he had a large amount of treasure, including some extremely precious elixirs. Hence, he had almost recovered completely as well.

Then, the four of them set out again.

According to the route that we found from Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, the four of them departed to Imperial Cabinet straightaway.

From Silver-Winged God Mansion to Imperial Cabinet, the journey was quite far. The four of them were very careful and they wouldn’t get into any trouble on the way. They didn’t make any stopover but they had used a year’s time to get to their destination.

“This is Imperial City?”

The four of them stood in the void as they looked down at a huge city in front of them that was engulfed in a great formation.

The city was located in the deepest end of the vast ocean. Its location was extremely remote. If there weren’t Silver-Winged God Mansion Master route instructions, it would be difficult for the four of them to find the place.

“According to Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, Imperial Cabinet is located within the Imperial City. However, the Imperial City is a place where all elites in Three-Emperors World gather. It is widely known as a cultivation sanctuary. Every cultivator from all over Three-Emperors World would figure a way to enter the Imperial City. On top of that, any experts who are above Chaotic Realm level are qualified to enter the Imperial City,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo continued.

“Speaking of which, besides Jian Wushuang, any one of us would catch the attention of any experts from Three-Emperors World as soon as we enter the Imperial City,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

The four of them became silent.

They had found out previously that Imperial City was completely engulfed in a great formation.

They could only enter the Imperial City via the ordinary entrance. However, the expert troop with three Great Emperors would definitely catch the attention of the higher-ups in Three-Emperors World if they were to enter directly. It was no different from walking right into a trap.

“Zhi Luo, can’t you think of any way to enter Imperial City?” Abysmal Saint Master asked.

“No,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo shook her head and replied, “If we were in Imperial City, which is within the formation, I might have been able to find a way to create a spacetime tunnel that ignored the great formation after given time to study. But it would be impossible for me to ignore the great formation to enter the Imperial City. On top of that, even if I could, would you dare to enter just like that?”

Abysmal Saint Master was stunned.

That was true. Imperial City was the supreme sanctuary in Three-Emperors World. There were countless experts within and there were definitely many Great Emperor-level experts.

Even if they entered the Imperial City in silence, the Great Emperors in the city would most likely notice them.

“Every way doesn’t work. What should we do? Unless the three of us stay outside and let Jian Wushuang enter Imperial City alone?” Emperor Jiu Qiao couldn’t help but say.

Then, Jian Wushuang suddenly spoke, “I have a solution but the thing is, the three of you will be put to great inconvenience. I wonder if the three of you are willing to.”

“Go ahead and share,” the three Great Emperors immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took out Blood Mountain Sword and put it before the three Great Emperors, “What do you think of my sword?”

The three of them looked at Blood Mountain Sword and Abysmal Saint Master answered, “The sword is powerful. It could be considered extremely strong among Chaotic Divine Treasures. I can feel that it has a great space for growth. However, what does this sword have to do with what we are talking about?”

Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao were confused too.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “It seems that even Abysmal Saint Master can’t tell. To be frank with you, my sword is not only an attack divine weapon, it also possesses suppress power.”

“Suppress? This sword is a suppressing treasure?” The three Great Emperors were shocked.

Suppressing treasure was extremely rare in Eternal Chaotic World, but it did exist.

However, suppressing treasure had a unique aura and it was easily determined. Some could even tell if a suppressing treasure had any expert suppressed within.

However, when Jian Wushuang took out his sword, none of them could tell or feel any suppressing power.

“Sword Emperor, do you mean you want us to stay in your sword until you bring us into Imperial City?” Great Emperor Zhi Luo asked.

“Yes. However, it will require the three of you to go through some inconvenience. Plus, there are factors that three of you should understand. Hence, please think through it,” Jian Wushuang said.

The three Great Emperors became quiet.

They, of course, understood what Jian Wushuang meant by ‘factors’. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was a suppressing treasure and the suppressing treasure was mastered by Jian Wushuang. If Jian Wushuang were to keep them in suppressing treasure, it meant that they would be being suppressed by Jian Wushuang. Once they were suppressed, no matter how powerful they were, their lives and deaths would be controlled by Jian Wushuang.

In other words, their lives would fall into the hands of Jian Wushuang temporarily.

If it were during normal times or under circumstances in which they had other solutions, the three Great Emperors would definitely not agree. but then…

“Yes, as soon as we can destroy the dark millstone, it is nothing to be inconvenienced temporarily,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said.

“I am willing,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded.

The two of them trusted Jian Wushuang.

Firstly, they were from the same team and they had come to Three-Emperors World to fight for life in Eternal Chaotic World.

Secondly, Jian Wushuang had blocked six Great Emperors alone to create an opportunity for them to flee. In other words, he had saved them earlier.

Their lives were saved by Jian Wushuang. It was nothing to hand their lives into Jian Wushuang’s hand temporarily.

The two Great Emperors agreed and they then looked towards Abysmal Saint Master.

Abysmal Saint Master was different from them after all.

The two of them didn’t share any resentment with Jian Wushuang and Jian Wushuang absolutely wouldn’t harm them.

But as for Abysmal Saint Master…

“I agreed,” Abysmal Saint Master lifted his head and there was determination in his eyes. At the same time, he looked Jian Wushuang in his eyes and said, “Jian Wushuang, I believe that you will consider the overall situation.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “Don’t worry. If we were in Eternal Chaotic World and there wasn’t any danger, I might have an idea in my head. But now, there’s no benefit to me if you die.”

“Mm,” Abysmal Saint Master nodded heavily. He understood it well too.

“As the three of you have decided, I shall start. Please do not resist,” Jian Wushuang said.

The three Great Emperors took a deep breath and stood there in silence. They saw Jian Wushuang’s sword transform into a lofty mountain and press at them.
