Chapter 2139 Sixteen Great Emperors

In the middle of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang stood coldly as he surveyed the battlefield.He was emotionless even when he saw Abysmal Saint Master, Jian Yi and the other great emperors kill a large number of experts from the Three Emperor World.

Many of these people were innocent cultivators. They might not have even known of the existence of the Eternal Chaotic World.

They were born in the Three Emperors World. They cultivated there to become stronger.

However, the leaders of the Three Emperors World had already decided to declare war on the Eternal Chaotic World.

Only one side would emerge victorious after the battle.

If the Three Emperors World lost the war, they would be exterminated.

That was the same case for the Eternal Chaotic World if it lost: all life would be lost.

Just like Jian Wushuang had said, he had no choice.

He had to cause the greatest damage to the Three Emperor World’s lineup to achieve victory in the upcoming war.

He had to find a way to do it unscrupulously.

Even if it cost him everything he had…

Not just him, but every single of the seven great emperors had the same mentality.

Jian Wushuang had control over Jian Yi’s brain. For the remaining emperors: Abysmal Saint Master, Underworld God, Emperor God Tian Ling, King Chen Xing, Black Dragon Emperor and Sir Lei Yuan, they were all well respected and powerful people, but they would never give it their all to kill so many experts in the Eternal Chaotic Realm.

This time, however, they had made up their minds.

They had no choice.

“Everything I am going to do is for the Eternal Chaotic World!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist as he made up his mind.

He looked up and looked at the distant space.

There, figures with powerful auras were rushing towards him.

They were the great emperors residing within the Imperial Cabinet.

There were at least ten of them. Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“Continue to kill them. I will handle those great emperors!”

Jian Wushuang yelled and flew towards the ten great emperors.

…

Many great emperors were rushing towards the three statues some distance away from the three statues,

There were a total of sixteen great emperors!!

This was about half the total fighting power of the Three Emperors World.

They saw the massacre of the large number of Chaotic Realm experts and turned pale.

The distance between the Imperial Cabinet and the three statues was not very great. They rushed over immediately after they noticed the battle. However, they still need some time to travel over even if they were great emperors.

This time they took was sufficient for the Abysmal Saint Master and the remaining six great emperors to start the massacre.

They could sense that at least three hundred experts in the Chaotic Realm were dead, and the slaughter was still ongoing.

“Bastard!!!”

One of the great emperors cursed.

“Jian Wushuang. It is this Jian Wushuang again.” The bald man who looked like a wild beast said. He was the leader of the sixteen great emperors.

This bald man was Ling Zong. There were two people flying alongside him. They were two stage two great emperors. One of them was in a golden cloak while the other was a white-haired elder woman.

As for the remaining thirteen, they were all stage one great emperors. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“The previous time, the Three Emperors World knew of his whereabouts and was well prepared for his arrival. We even set a trap for him. Not only did he destroy the Supreme Emperor Stone, he also escaped back into the Eternal Chaotic World. This time, the Three Emperors World took precautions and their security was tighter than ever before, yet they still managed to sneak in.” Ling Zong roared.

“What can we do? The Imperial Palace is a place for experts from the Three Emperors World to come to and gain more resources to become even stronger. Unless we completely seal it off from the rest of the world, someone will eventually sneak past our defenses.” One of the well built middle-aged men standing beside Ling Zong said.

“This time, Jian Wushuang disguised himself as Ancestor Hong Chen, who had disappeared for a million years. He disguised himself so well that the intel department of the Imperial Palace had no suspicion as to whether he was real. That’s why we allowed him to enter the Imperial Palace to begin with.”

After hearing this, the great emperors around shook their heads helplessly.

They had indeed put out preventive measures to stop Jian Wushuang and the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World from entering. In the end, it had been useless.

“If the Sacred Stone was not destroyed and is still here, many of the secret restrictions within the Three Emperors World can be used and Jian Wushuang would not be able to be unrestrained.” Ling Zong said.

“It is no use discussing all this. Let’s go and stop the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World now.” The white-haired elderly woman said.

When they were communicating, Boom!

A figure which radiated gloom flew towards them.

His body was covered in dark jade light and he was over ten feet tall. There were nine heads and eighteen arms on his giant body.

Each of the eighteen arms held a sword. Endless waves of sword essence radiated from him. It was as though he was an undefeatable god.

Every one of the sixteen great emperors was enraged when they saw this figure.

“Jian Wushuang!!” Zong Ling screeched.

Jian Wushuang continued to make his way towards the sixteen of them without any delay.

Within moments, he appeared in front of the sixteen great emperors as his overpowering aura enveloped all of them.

The aura was so strong that every great emperor trembled slightly when they felt it.

“Kill him!”

Zong Ling roared as the sixteen great emperors attacked simultaneously.

Zong Ling was the strongest of them. He was the first to take a step and raised his axe high up in the air.

Boom!~~~ A black axe expanded in size quietly. However, the aura was terrifying.

It crashed down towards Jian Wushuang.

The well-built middle-aged man waved his hand, a hand which looked like it was made of jade.

The hand too grew in size as it turned into a mountain made entirely out of jade crystals and crashed towards Jian Wushuang. This mountain felt like it could suppress everything in this world.

Lastly, the white-haired elder woman held a dark golden stick. She swung that stick at Jian Wushuang as numerous shadows of the dark golden stick were seen. These shadows fused together quickly as it attacked Jian Wushuang.
