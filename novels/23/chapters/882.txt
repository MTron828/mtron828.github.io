Chapter 883: Level Two

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“High Rank Blood Demon, Show me what you’ve got.” Jian Wushuang licked his lips with a firm gaze.

Even though he was being gazed at by Jian Wushuang, the High Rank Blood Demon did not hesitate. Striding forward a span of 300 meters, he suddenly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and chopped down at him with his large sword.

The attack was simple but domineering.

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry to display the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation from the beginning. Instead, he gripped the Blood Mountain Sword tightly. There was a stream of power inside the longsword.

Jian Wushuang quickly slashed out with the sword while releasing an overwhelming sword essence that was like a huge waterfall cascading downwards.

Boundless Heaven Sword Art, fifth move!

Even since he began cultivating on Star Island two years ago, his Slaughter Body had been working on comprehending the marvelous pattern on the Star Jade Wall. The swordsmanship contained in the pattern was completely unfathomable, but it left many impressions on him after his two-years of meditation.

Due to these impressions, Jian Wushuang had become more knowledgeable about Sword Principle. He also made great progress in the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

As of now, he could manage to display the fifth move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art with effort.

As for his incredible swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang could display it effortlessly and his Sword Heart had also reached a new level.

At the same time, a visible black thunderbolt surged out the instant the sword was swung, becoming part of the sword light.

This black thunderbolt was the Divine Yin Thunder that Jian Wushuang controlled.

“Bump!”

A roar of terror echoed inside Level Two of the black tower.

Jian Wushuang’s body shook and the ground under his feet split open. Although the process was a bit difficult, his eyes glittered with surprise.

“No wonder the Divine Yin Thunder is one of the strongest secret skills on Star Island. I only managed to gather one, but my overall strength has improved so much. Although my strength is not quite equal to a High Rank Blood Demon, I’m still able to battle him head-on.”

With a faint smile, Jian Wushuang moved and immediately attacked.

In Level Two, Jian Wushuang confronted the High Rank Blood Demon with his swordsmanship, the help of the Blood Mountain Sword, and the Divine Yin Thunder.

A fierce fight broke out. Jian Wushuang was often suppressed by the High Rank Blood Demon, but his opponent could only dream about defeating him in a short time.

Compared with two years ago, the situation was much better. Back then, he had been killed by the High Rank Blood Demon in only three blows.

“Bump!”

There was another loud explosion, forcing Jian Wushuang to retreat and causing his palms to feel slightly numb.

“I can barely face him with only my swordsmanship. If I want to defeat him, I will have to rely on the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.”?Jian Wushuang recited the spell in his heart and 36 Blood-sky Swords immediately appeared, combining to form a six-meter-long scarlet longsword.

A horrible aura condensed around his sword.

“Kill!”

A threatening light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as the Divine Yin Thunder directly poured into the scarlet longsword, becoming part of it and causing the sword’s horrifying aura to skyrocket. Then, this terrifying sword sliced through the air, accompanied by a surge of flowing light.

Buzz~~~ The scarlet flowing light went through the air and instantly arrived in front of the High Rank Blood Demon.

The High Rank Blood Demon whispered as it brought down its sword without mercy. A huge knife shadow ruthlessly decended.

These two terrifying powers confronted each other once again.

However, after this confrontation, it was the High Rank Blood Demon who was shaken and forced to step back.

“I have the upper hand!” Jian Wushuang looked very pleased.

For him, the most frightening feature of the High Rank Blood Demon was its outrageous power.

But, now that he was able to use the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation with all of his strength, along with help from the Divine Yin Thunder, his power exceeded the High Rank Blood Demon’s.

As a result, the threat to him was reduced dramatically.

“Go!”

“Kill!”

While looking coldly at his opponent, Jian Wushuang attacked continuously and crazily, displaying the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation with all his might. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

High Rank Blood Demon tried to fight back, but every one of the attacks was difficult to face.

He managed to fight back against the first few blows, but he could not resist against dozens of these horrifying attacks. He eventually failed to defend and Jian Wushuang took a chance to directly penetrated the body of the High Rank Blood Demon.

Finally, he passed the test on Level Two of the black tower!

“I made it.”

When he saw the body of the High Rank Blood Demon land heavily on the ground, Jian Wushuang felt relieved.

The condition for leaving Star Island was to pass the three levels of the black tower and he had already passed Level Two. He was only one step away from Level Three.

However, the Level Two test was much more difficult than the one of Level One, so the test on Level Three would probably be even more extraodinary.

“Let’s give it a try.” Jian Wushuang walked toward Level Three of the black tower.

After Jian Wushuang passed Level Two of the black tower, on the large campus of Star Island.

Tian Quan, as well as everyone who came to watch this battle, had been waiting here patiently.

“What happened? It has been so long. Where’s Blood Mountain?”

“We have been waiting for him patiently. Why hasn’t he turned up yet?”

“Maybe he knows he is not strong enough to be Tian Quan’s opponent, so he ran away from the battle?”

“Hey, this Blood Mountain has only been on Star Island for two years. How could he be as powerful as Tian Quan? In my opinion, he must have been too scared to come!”

“He can’t escape and No one on Star Island can die. On top of that, this duel was witnessed by Lord Spirit Sound in person, so even if he runs away, Lord Spirit Sound can declare it as his loss and give the one billion Divine Gems to Tian Quan. That means there’s no use in trying to escape.”

Everyone was talking about it and some people had obviously become impatient.

Tian Quan’s face was also a bit cold.

At this time…

Buzz~~~ An enchanting red figure suddenly appeared in the center of the drill grounds.

Everyone around showed their respect towards him.

“Tian Quan, Blood Mountain is currently being tested in the black tower and he still hasn’t come out. Please wait a little longer,” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“In the black tower?” Tian Quan felt puzzled.

“Also…” Lord Spirit Sound continued, “Just now, Blood Mountain passed Level Two of the black tower!”

His simple words instantly caused a loud uproar on the drill grounds.
