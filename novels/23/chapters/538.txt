Chapter 539: The Tragic Result

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Every inch of the Sky Fire Plains had become a battlefield.

Countless Demonic Beasts were fighting frantically with sergeants of the East Camp, resulting in a battle that was both miserable and tragic.

After over half a day, the short man, who was surrounded by many Demonic Beasts outside the front battlefield, finally ordered them to retreat.

The Demonic Beasts immediately responded. They stopped attacking and turned around, retreating towards the Demonic Beast territory.

This tragic war, which was considered a rare event, even in the entirety of the humans recorded history, finally came to an end.

The sergeants of the East Camp and the top experts all gathered at the front battlefield.

“They finally retreated.”

“East Camp has suffered a serious loss.”

“But we killed more Demonic Beasts!”

The generals were discussing everything that had happened. A fierce war had also broken out on the front battlefield and these generals, as well as the two Temple Masters, had participated in the fight and killed a large number of Demonic Beasts. However, traces of exhaustion could be seen on their foreheads.

Among the generals, there was a skinny middle-aged man whose eyes were as sharp as a snake. He wore a golden robe and had a rather forbidding and gloomy demeanor.

He was Emperor Golden Snake, one of the 108 Divine Emperors of the Monster-exterminating League.

“Hum, these Demonic Beasts were indeed crazy.” Emperor Golden Snake looked around. Countless Demonic Beasts had died on the battlefield and their blood had soaked into the ground.

“Oh, Ling’er’s message,” Emperor Golden Snake suddenly recalled something and took out a Messaging Slip.

He had received Jin Ling’s message earlier. However, he had been fighting, so he did not check the message until now.

He immediately heard a voice full of hysteria and endless resentment.

“Father, I’m going to die!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It’s Jian Wushuang’s fault!”

“He left me to die!”

“Get revenge me, get revenge for me!”

“Kill him, kill him for me!”

The voice echoed in Emperor Golden Snake’s ears for a long time after the Messaging Slip burst.

Emperor Golden Snake stood there for a while, his eyes empty and his head locked in a daze.

“Dead?”

“Ling’er is dead?”

He murmured, but his face gradually became distorted and horrifying.

“Jian Wushuang!”

He gnashed his teeth in anger while saying those words. An overwhelming killing intent rose from him as he rushed toward Zone No. 14, where Jian Wushuang was.

Some generals around noticed this scene.

“What happened to Golden Snake?”

“What a strong killing intent. But nothing happened to him just now.”

“Did someone important to him die?”

The generals were confused.

“Let me go check it out. This war has only just ended and East Camp suffered a heavy loss. I hope there are no more accidents,” a black-clothed elder said. He then followed Emperor Golden Snake and left.

He was the general who had shown up when Jian Wushuang fought Fang Han in the Seventh Army campsite.

At that time, Jian Wushuang, Fang Han, and the other sergeants had realized that he favored Jian Wushuang to some extent.

Zone No. 14.

The Demonic Beasts outside the Formation were retreating. Most of the ones in the Formation had been killed by the sergeants.

“Are they finally retreating?”

Seeing the Demonic Beasts leaving, Jian Wushuang sighed in relief. Under his feet, the Demonic Beasts bodies had piled up, forming a mountain.

These Demonic Beasts had tried to enter the battlefield through the breach, but they were killed by Jian Wushuang as soon as they stepped through the breach.

He had killed hundreds of Demonic Beasts at the breach during this period of time.

The sergeants began to clean up the battlefield.

This battlefield was like a huge treasure.

After all, during the fierce battle, the sergeants did not always have time to grab the Monster Cores before the Demonic Beasts’ bodies fell to the ground. Also, some?of the sergeants died, and their Interspatial Rings also fell to the ground with them.

The ground of this battlefield was priceless in a sense.

“Brother Wushuang,” Qing Huo walked over to Jian Wushuang. His face was a little pale, so it was obvious that he had also been heavily wounded during the battle.

“How was your harvest?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not bad. After we clean up the battlefield, the commander will distribute the Monster Cores according to everyone’s position and contribution. We’ll get more Monster Cores at that time, so it’s quite a big harvest,” Qing Huo said.

Qing Huo should have felt happy for the harvest. However, he, as well as the other sergeants, could not feel happy.

“Too miserable,” Qing Huo shook his head and replied.

“Xue Hou, Shi Shan, Gongsun Yang... They all died,” Qing Huo mentioned several names. They were sergeants in Jian Wushuang’s squad, including some team leaders. They had been killed by Demonic Beasts during the battle.

In the tenth squad, only about 40 of the 100 sergeants survived, but even they were seriously wounded.

That was not the worst part though. Some of the squads in the Seventh Army had been completely wiped out. Only about 10 percent of the sergeants in the Sixth Army had survived. It was utterly miserable!

“This is the war between humans and Demonic Beasts!”

“No wonder that humans on Monster Continent hate the Demonic Beasts so much,”Jian Wushuang thought.

The war was started by the Demonic Beasts. The humans could only hide in the Formation and resist them. Every time, a large number of sergeants would die in battle.

However, they had no ability to counterattack.

After all, they were too weak when compared to the Demonic Beasts!

While Jian Wushuang was in deep thought, suddenly...

Boom!

In the distance, a man with a mighty killing intent appeared, and he was rushing here at an alarming rate.

The overwhelming killing intent swept through the area before he even arrived.

“This is...”

All of the sergeants in Zone No. 14 raised their heads to look at that man.

Fang Han’s eyes narrowed because he had recognized that man.

“Emperor Golden Snake!”
