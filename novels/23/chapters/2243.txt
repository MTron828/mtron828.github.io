2244 Direct Attack

After going back and forth for some time, Old Monster Jiao finally made his decision.

“The main focus of this mission is just Sanctuary Alliance. We will kill the experts within Sanctuary Alliance other than the Sword Emperor. As for Emperor Bai, if we can kill him, we will. If not, let him have a taste of how it feels to lose a loved one or a good friend,” Old Monster Jiao said coldly.

“Yes,” The experts in the Divine Demon Realm who were present nodded their heads.

“Let’s go. We will head straight for Sanctuary Alliance’s headquarters.”

Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi led twenty over experts in the Divine Demon Realm towards the headquarters of Sanctuary Alliance.

...

Thunderbolt Island.

The place with the best cultivating environment within the Eternal Chaotic World was the Green Fire World, and Thunderbolt Island was now ranked lower than Green Fire World.

However, Green Fire World was located at a remote part of the Eternal Chaotic World and was self-managed, the headquarters of the Green Fire World was still located at Thunderbolt Island.

There was still a large number of experts cultivating on Thunderbolt Island all year round.

Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen were together within the Presbytery Pavillion.

“Emperor Bai. This is the projected image that was sent from the East Royal Sanctuary,” Ancestor Tian Chen said as a large projected image appeared at the space in front of them.

Within the projected image, an emperor god with an incredible aura stood in front of a teenage boy in a golden cloak.

The teenage boy in the golden cloak looked very friendly and calm. One could not sense his aura.

Soon, the emperor god attacked. All the moves he used were used with the intention of killing the opponent.

However, the teenage boy in the golden cloak simply pointed his fingers and the attack by the emperor god was neutralized. The emperor god was also turned to dust with a look of desperation.

Then, the projected image disappeared.

“A casual point could kill an emperor god. No ordinary great emperor can do this. His aura was also very unique, hence he shouldn’t be an expert from the first era. If I am not wrong, he is another expert from the ancient past who has awakened recently,” Emperor Bai said.

Emperor Bai was extremely sharp in his observation. He could tell the teenage boy in the golden cloak was special with one look.

“Another one?”Ancestor Tian Chen sighed.

Up till today, Sanctuary Alliance had already found three of such experts from the ancient past.

The first was the man from Coloured Glaze Sanctuary. Then, it was the Black Dragon which was from Red Dragon Sanctuary and his master.

The teenage boy in the golden cloak that was seen within the projected image was obviously an expert from the ancient past.

On the of this, the Sword Emperor had visited the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and met three experts from the ancient past.

This added up to a total of six.

“There should be more than these six experts from the ancient past, and they could be located anywhere within the Eternal Chaotic World,” Ancestor Tian Chen said solemnly.

“That is true. However, most of these experts are very law abiding, just like that teenage boy in the golden cloak. If I recalled correctly, Emperor God Gu San provoked him first, right?” Emperor Bai said.

Emperor God Gu San was the one who had been killed in the battle against the teenage boy in the golden cloak. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Indeed. From my intel, the teenage boy in the golden cloak stayed within one of the clans in the East Royal Sanctuary and has not massacred anyone before. He asked the clan to find certain treasures and resources for him, and he would in turn reward them,” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded his head and said.

“While the clan was searching for the resources, they managed to find a stalk of Blood Dragon Flower. The greedy Emperor God Gu San got news of this and wanted the flower for himself. This is why that scene happened.”

“No wonder,” Emperor Bai smiled, unsurprised.

He knew that there were definitely more experts from the ancient past who had awoken other than those that they already knew of.

However, most of these experts were law abiding.

Of course, this was because these experts were not dumb.

After they awakened, they went on to understand what the current situation was like in this heaven and earth. They got to know of Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang.

They might not have felt threatened by Jian Wushuang, but they were definitely afraid of Emperor Bai.

This was why they had been so law abiding thus far. All they did was stay within certain clans and ask the clan to search for some resources or treasures. The most they did was to cause a small ruckus in distant places. They dared not act up within the ten sanctuaries.

After all, the passage way would open at Heaven’s Horizon three thousand years later. They would leave this place and return to the Absolute Beginning Divine World. There would be no need for them to risk anything at all.

Only experts like Old Monster Jiao who look down on Emperor Bai would neglect all rules and do whatever they wanted to.

In the end, he had suffered great losses at the hands of Emperor Bai.

“If these experts were law abiding, or knew their limits, we would not interfere with their lives. However, I will not allow them to cross the line,” Emperor Bai said.

“Yes. Ancestor Tian Chen nodded his head and said.

Right then...

Boom!!!

A loud explosion was heard as the entire Thunderbolt Island shook.

Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen could feel that the Presbytery Pavillion was shaking uncontrollably.

“What is going on?” Ancestor Tian Chen and Emperor Bai turned pale as they appeared in the air above Thunderbolt Island.

Soon, they found the source of the tremor.

“Bastards. They are attacking the formation protecting Thunderbolt Island!” Emperor Bai’s face turned dark as he looked out of the formation.

There, more than twenty experts stood together as they attacked the formation with powerful attacks.

The power of the weakest attack was equivalent to an attack by a stage-three great emperor.

The strongest attack was equivalent to that of a peak stage three great emperor.

Emperor Bai also saw Old Monster Jiao standing among the experts.

“It’s him!!”

“Damn it!!!”

Emperor Bai turned pale.

He had killed the black dragon within the Red Dragon Sanctuary and Old Monster Jiao had escaped. Old Monster Jiao was filled with hatred, and he swore that he would take revenge when he left.

After seeing Old Monster Jiao and the other experts, Emperor Bai understood that this was revenge promised by Old Monster Jiao.

It came so quickly, and they came straight for Thunderbolt Island.

The loud explosions created when the powerful attacks hit the formation could be heard continuously. Luckily, the formation on Thunderbolt Island was made by the entire Sanctuary Alliance at a great cost. These experts could not break through within a short amount of time.

“Quick, inform the great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance to return to Thunderbolt Island immediately!” Emperor Bai ordered.
