“The seventh War God under the command of Emperor Xiao of Tang of the East?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He had heard of Tang of the East. It was a bloodthirsty kingdom on the Nanyang Continent, where Jian Wushuang had adventured for some time.

But he had never heard of Emperor Xiao of Tang of the East or the War Gods.

“Why, don’t you understand?” Di Jing looked at him with great interest.

“Respected elder, I know the Tang of the East. I’ve only heard that there is a mysterious Monarch, but I’ve never heard of Emperor Xiao or the War Gods,” Jian Wushuang frowned and said.

“The Tang of the East that you know is completely different from the one I mentioned,” Di Jing laughed. “The one you know was created by my master. As for the real one, you’ve never seen it. If you have an opportunity in the future, you’ll know the Prosperous Tang.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned speechless.

The Tang of the East on the Nanyang Continent was a Slaughterous Dynasty and Country of Death. But the Tang of the East mentioned by Di Jing was a prosperous world?

“Well, it’s useless to explain to you, boy,” Di Jing said with a wave of his hand.

Jian Wushuang stopped speaking as his attention turned to the other figure in the hall.

“Elder, who is he?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the old man with white hair and beard, who had obviously been dead for many years.

“He was the owner of this cave mansion,” Di Jing said.

“Owner of the cave mansion?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “I thought it was constructed by you.”

“Of course not.” Di Jing said, curling his lips, “I’m going to die. Why would I construct a cave mansion?”

“He is Puppet Master.?He seemed to have been famous in Divine Land. In the information he left, he claimed to be the first puppet maker in Divine Land.”

“First puppet maker in Divine Land?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

This was extraordinary.

“Unfortunately, no matter how strong his puppets had been, his own life was limited. When I fought those Cloud Realm experts in the Flaming Mountains, I discovered the cave mansion, so I chose this place to cultivate in seclusion,” said Di Jing.

“This hall is the real core of the cave mansion, where he left four opportunities for future experts. It shouldn’t have been discovered yet. You’re lucky that I brought you here.”

“Four opportunities?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up immediately.

“Boy, it’s too early for you to get excited. The four opportunities are accompanied by tests. Three tests are about making puppets, while you... I guess you’re not good at it?” Di Jing looked at him. As a powerful expert?who had stayed in the cave mansion for over a thousand years, Di Jing knew everything in the cave mansion.

Jian Wushuang smiled reluctantly.

Making puppets?

Not good at it? He knew nothing about it.

“That’s just it. Although there are four opportunities, you can get one at most. Even then, I wonder if you’re up to it,” Di Jing sneered.” Boy, come with me.”

“At least there’s still an opportunity. Half a loaf is better than no bread,” said Jian Wushuang, as he shrugged. He followed Di Jing into a secret chamber next to the hall.

“The test is in the secret chamber,” Di Jing said as he looked at Jian Wushuang. “If you can pass this test, you’ll get a good reward. Value the opportunity.”

Jian Wushuang forced a smile and stepped inside without a second thought.

He saw a vacant ground with a towering figure in the center.

“A Puppet Fighter?”

Jian Wushuang was not surprised to see it.

Puppet Master had claimed to be the first puppet maker in Divine Land and had constructed this cave mansion, filling it with Puppet Fighters. It was unsurprising that he would use a Puppet Fighter in his test.

The Puppet Fighter immediately opened his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“The Saint Realm?” The Puppet Fighter asked with a hint of surprise.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said, “A Puppet Fighter with intelligence?”

There were two types of Puppet Fighters, intelligent ones, and non-intelligent ones.

They were very different.

Puppet Fighters with intelligence were as smart as human beings, but they were usually not very strong.

Puppet Fighters without intelligence were much stronger. For example, Jian Wushuang’s Blood Puppet and other Puppet Fighters he had met in the inner and outer layer of the cave mansion belonged to this type.

Jian Wushuang had once met Puppet Fighters with intelligence, such as Jin Ling and Mu Shan in the Ancestor’s Land.

“Human Warrior, you’re just a Saint Realm expert, so I’ll restrain my battle strength to the Saint Realm level. As long as you defeat me, you can get the opportunity my master left in this secret chamber,”?the blonde Puppet Fighter in blue robes said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

“Are you ready?” the Blonde Puppet stared at Jian Wushuang. As soon as he finished his words, he paused a second and then rushed forward.

The Blonde Puppet bounced forward like a bomb. Simultaneously, a Giant Axe appeared in his hand. He swung it violently at Jian Wushuang as he made his approach.

The Giant Axe cut the air with immense power and left a bright edge in the Void.

“Nice axe skill,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He knew that Puppet Fighters with intelligence could use manual skills, unlike Puppets that could only use physical strength.

Jian Wushuang started to counterattack. He swept his sword up and blocked the Axe Shadow heading toward him.

Clang!

After the fierce collision, the Blonde Puppet continued to swing the Giant Axe in a flurry of attacks that oppressed Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang lifted his sword to resist as he thought in surprise,?“This Puppet Fighter’s power is indeed of the Saint Realm level. However, his axe skill is extremely delicate. He’s barely comparable to a novice lord.”

It was the test of Puppet Master.

It would be impossible for a Saint Realm expert to defeat a Puppet Fighter of novice lord level. However, it was not difficult for Jian Wushuang, as he could easily fight against two intermediate lords at the same time.

Jian Wushuang quickly started to attack.
