Chapter 727: Battling Techniques

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As Jian Wushuang walked out of the Restriction of Earth Level Test, Gu Changfeng immediately stepped forward to greet him.

“Jian Wushuang, have you really passed the third stage of the Earth Level Test?” Gu Changfeng stared at Jian Wushuang incredulously.

Although he had remained outside the Restriction the whole time, he had been watching Jian Wushuang fighting inside the Restriction with great concentration.

In the Earth Level Test, what Jian Wushuang faced was 10 Puppet Fighters, which could merely count as the medium level among the three kinds of tests. Once the test progressed to the second stage, no ordinary clansman could power through it. So far, even Gu Changfeng himself had been able to pass the second stage of the Earth Level Test.

But Jian Wushuang had now passed the third stage of the Earth Level Test.

When he battled with Jian Wushuang before, he could tell that Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was of a very high caliber, added to this his offensive ability was overwhelming. However, he only expected Jian Wushuang to pass the second stage of the Earth Level Test at most. But to his surprise…

“Perhaps this guy didn’t reveal his true strength when he dueled with me.” Gu Changfeng muttered to himself.

“Now, of the three types of tests there is, I’ve tried the Earth Level. Next, I’ll have a go at the Heaven Level Test and then the Human Level Test.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile. Then, he headed for the other two tests.

In the Human Level Test, he would face only one Puppet Fighter. Despite the intimidating power this Puppet Fighter had, the pressure it imposed upon Jian Wushuang was obviously less than the Earth Level Test. After breaking through the first three stages, Jian Wushuang finally failed during the fourth stage. But what was quite remarkable was that he managed to put up a good fight against the Puppet Fighter in the fourth stage.

The final test was the Heaven Level Test, which was also the most difficult one.

In the Heaven Level Test, his opponents were 100 Puppet Fighters, which coordinated with each and other advanced on him from all directions. This put Jian Wushuang at a major disadvantage.

Jian Wushuang passed the first and the second stage. But in the third stage, the Puppet Fighter launched ferocious attacks against Jian Wushuang, who exerted all his efforts to defend himself but was eventually defeated.

“Among the three kinds of tests, the Heaven Level Test is the hardest one to deal with. As to the other two, they’re just fine.” Jian Wushuang had now gained a clear understanding of all the tests.

After experiencing the three varied tests, he began to have high expectations of the Underground Palace.

Among the three kinds of tests the Underground Palace offered, the Human Level Test aimed to hone one’s individual battling skills.

While the Earth Level Test and the Heaven Level Test were aimed at testing how a man could handle sieges and converging attacks.

Each of these tests was further divided into nine stages according to their assorted level of difficulty. They provided a great opportunity for men continuously seeking to improve their battle techniques. For Jian Wushuang, this was a perfect place to gain more experience.

“I thought my battle techniques were already powerful. But who knows, I failed the third stage of the Heaven Level Test in the Underground Palace. Seems that there is still much room for improvement in terms of my battle techniques and swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang murmured, his hands clenched tightly.

Now that he had been trapped in the Ancient God Clan, it was impossible for him to get out. As he would be here for a long time, he would not just lie there and do nothing. Instead, he decided to try every means to improve his strength, including polishing his battle techniques. These kinds of techniques would certainly come in handy when he was in a fierce fight or tangled warfare.

For the remainder of his days there, Jian Wushuang spent most of his time inside the Underground Palace, constantly familiarizing himself with these three sorts of test.

He continually made progress by undergoing the pitched battles day and night. It could be said that he had been challenging himself.

And his offensive ability was also enhanced.

The Eighth Tribe was quiet and as uneventful as ever. However, many clansmen of the Eighth Tribe already heard that Jian Wushuang was honing his skills in the Underground Palace feverishly, and many of them could not help but be amazed by his gallantry.

Soon, a month went by.

Inside the stone house, Gu Yang was busy polishing his longbow.

Just then, Gu Lan ran towards him from outside.

“Father!” Gu Lan shouted, a little out of breath.

“What’s the matter?” Gu Yang stopped what he was doing and turned to look at Gu Lan.

“That Jian Wushuang, he…” Gu Yang stammered, still out of breath.

“Jian Wushuang?” Gu Yang’s expression changed.

Jian Wushuang was rescued and brought here by Gu Yang. Knowing that Jian Wushuang was a descendant of the Militant Warriors, not only Gu Yang, but the whole tribe had been paying close attention to his progress. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What’s the matter with Jian Wushuang?” Gu Yang urgently repeated.

“Father, Jian Wushuang has been practicing in the Underground Palace since he arrived here, right? And a month ago, he passed the third stage of the Earth Level Test in his first attempt but failed at the third stage of the Heaven Level Test.” Gu Lan said.

“I know that.” Gu Yang nodded.

Thanks to Gu Changfeng, the news that Jian Wushuang already passed the third stage of the Earth Level Test had long since spread. Loads of clansmen of the Eighth Tribe were aware of it.

“But today, just one month after that, Jian Wushuang successfully broke through the third stage of the Heaven Level Test and passed the fourth stage of the Human Level Test and the fourth stage of the Earth Level Test respectively!” Gu Lan said earnestly.

“What?”

Hearing this, even Gu Yang was astonished.

Among the three kinds of tests in the Underground Palace, the most difficult of them was the Heaven Level Test. In spite of there being nine stages in this test, if a man could pass just one stage, his offensive ability would already be in the top rank. If he proceeded to overcome the second stage, he would be even more amazing. As for passing the third stage, only a handful of members of their entire clan had achieved that.

Those who had managed to conquer the third stage of the Heaven Level Test in their tribe all reached the level of Two-star Ancient God, and Gu Yang was one of them.

But Jian Wushuang, someone who had neither awakened his bloodline nor become an Ancient God, already upgraded his offensive skills to that level?

“He is really the son of a Militant Warrior. Militant Warriors put their lives on the line every day. Through a large number of life-threatening battles, their offensive abilities have become way stronger than ours, we have become used to living a comfortable life within the tribe.” Gu Yang could not stifle his praise.

At present, the members of the Ancient God Clan all lived in tribes. Some of them would often participate in fight competitions within their tribes, but these were just competitions and therefore their lives would not be at stake.

Maybe the only chance they could put up a real fight was the arrival of outsiders, which usually occurred every 100 years.

This would give an opportunity to those clansmen with awakened bloodline and let them realize what a life and death struggle was really like.

Nevertheless, due to the lack of experience in life and death combat, when the clansmen of the Ancient God Clan got in a fight against outsiders, they were usually at a disadvantage.

Every time when the outsiders came here, the Ancient God Clan would suffer a great loss, while the casualty suffered by the outsiders would be minor.

“Jian Wushuang has an unbelievable talent for battle. He has made such a progress in just one month. In the next few years, his progress will certainly be more striking!”

Gu Yang was quite hopeful of seeing Jian Wushuang’s talent grow.
