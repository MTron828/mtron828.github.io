“Damn you!”

Chan Tuo, the ugly old man cursed under his breath while staring toward Jian Wushuang’s room with thick killing intent.

However, he finally withdrew his killing intent, sighed lightly, and no longer followed up with another bid.

The Earth Ultimate Gods in the individual rooms were disbelieved upon seeing Chan Tuo’s not reacting for a while.

“Looks like that old toad has given up.”

“Haha! Forty million Primordial Stones? Even an ordinary Heavenly Ultimate God will have to liquidate all of his possessions to come up with that sum. The old toad does have some skills, but I’m afraid he won’t be able to pay that much.”

“I wonder who’s the man in that room that even refuses to give Chan Tuo face. He’s probably someone important since he can come up with forty million Primordial Stones just like that.”

The Transmigration Sword Formation’s auction ended amid praises and exclamations.

Finally, the Transmigration Sword Formation’s first four stages were purchased by Jian Wushuang with a bid of forty million Primordial Stones.

Jian Wushuang sighed in relief upon the successful purchase.

40,000,000 Primordial Stones was the limit for him. If the bid went up further, he would perhaps have to give up.

It was not from him being unable to afford more Primordial Stones, but because there were other items that he wanted to purchase later in the auction.

Although the Transmigration Sword Formation was powerful, the value of even all 12 stages was not a 1,000th of The Stately Painting which Jian Wushuang wanted to truly obtain.

As for the Transmigration Sword Formation, it was only something he discovered by chance and thought would be useful, hence his bid and purchase.

“This Chan Tuo who wanted to compete with me over the Transmigration Sword Formation... Although I’ve never heard of him, for someone who so daringly reveals their identity and asks me to give them some face must be pretty famous and most probably powerful too. I’m afraid I’ve offended him by not giving him any face, but the individual rooms in the auction are all under the protection of restrictive shields so he won’t know who I am. Even if he wanted to take revenge, he won’t be able to find me.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

The next valuable item was very soon placed on the display stage.

Meanwhile, a bald man sat lazily in an individual room on the third floor.

The bald man was clad in a golden robe just like the Golden Chief downstairs hosting the auction on the display stage.

He was also a Golden Chief at the Star Picking Pavilion.

“Forty million Primordial Stones for the sword formation’s first four stages?”

The bald man looked downward at the room where Jian Wushuang was in and asked, “Not many Earthly Ultimate Gods will be able to afford forty million Primordial Stones. Who’s in that room?”

Four Black Chiefs were standing respectfully before the bald man. One of them immediately answered, “In reply to your question, Your Excellency. The man in the room is the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, Jian Yi.”

“Jian Yi?” The bald man raised his eyebrows. “He’s the one who killed San Shouwang and took over the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord position? Based on what I know, although San Shouwang was the Territorial Lord, the wealth he accumulated through the ages was completely spent on the Divine Destruction Beast. This man just became the Territorial Lord. Where did he find those Primordial Stones?”

“Your Excellency, this Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord has also brought a few treasures to be auctioned in the Star Picking Pavilion. Among them was a Heavenly Treasure defensive armor and the Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon which was also the first treasure that we sold in the auction,” said the Black Chief.

“What?” The bald man’s eyes were shining with a strange light from being surprised.

“He’s only an ordinary Territorial Lord at the Earthly Ultimate God realm, yet he could obtain an offensive divine soul weapon and a defensive armor at the Heavenly Treasure rank. Looks like...I really should request to meet him once. San Shouwang was someone who owed me a total of six million Primordial Stones after all and said he will find ways to annihilate one of the large clans in the Northern Darkstar Territory as soon as possible before returning the Primordial Stones to me—interest included. Who will have thought he’d die in Jian Yi’s hands!

“Even though he died, I can’t just let go of my six million Primordial Stones.”

The bald man mumbled.

Suddenly... The door opened as a Black Chief hurriedly came in.

“What’s with the hastiness?” The bald man frowned and scolded. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Your Excellency, the Manager needs you to rush over as soon as you can. That... That gentleman is here,” said the Black Chief fearfully.

“What gentleman? Who?” The bald man was puzzled.

“S-senior Meng,” said the Black Chief nervously.

The bald man stood in shock. In the next moment, he rushed out at full speed.

...

The auction continued.

Treasures after treasures were being displayed with the many experts in the auction also fiercely trying to outbid each other.

Half a day had passed in the blink of an eye. In that time, Jian Wushuang’s last treasure—the Heavenly Treasure defensive armor was also sold. The final bid was at 18,000,000 Primordial Stones, slightly less than Jian Wushuang’s initial prediction of 20,000,000 Primordial Stones.

The main reason was the too many very expensive treasures being sold in the auction.

There were already two Heavenly Treasure armors among defensive armors so far in the auction and Jian Wushuang’s armor was the third. Naturally, it was very difficult to sell it at a satisfactory price.

“Honorable guests, the next item we’re about to present to you is rather unique. Behold!”

The Golden Chief waved his hand as a baby fist-sized golden rock appeared on the display stage.

Everyone in the room immediately looked over and was puzzled as soon as they saw it.

They could not identify the golden rock. They were not even sure if the golden rock was some special kind of crystal or merely an ordinary rock.

The golden rock projected no special energy from its surface either.

It was too ordinary. It was almost no different than normal rocks.

The Golden Chief directly spoke, “Honorable guests, this golden rock is very unique. I’m assuming that nobody in the room could identify it but you aren’t the only one. Even we from the Star Picking Pavilion can’t find out what exactly the material is. We don’t know what’s so special about it and neither can we even be sure if it’s really a treasure.”

“Even the Star Picking Pavilion isn’t sure?” Everyone in the auction was shocked.

“Why will the Star Picking Pavilion put it up in the auction when they can’t even ascertain if it’s a valuable item?”

“Honorable guests, please let me explain. Indeed, the Star Picking Pavilion can’t identify it, but the golden rock itself has an extraordinary origin.” The Golden Chief began to narrate his story.
