Chapter 1449: Nine Sword Mountains

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

A huge piece of land was located in-between two Holy Kingdoms. The piece of land was where Sky Sword Mountain was.

Jian Wushuang spent another ten years traveling by spaceship and went through the boundless void once again. He then appeared on the land.

“This is Sky Sword Mountain?”

Jian Wushuang looked over the huge piece of land before his eyes and he could faintly see the nine lofty mountains at the end of his view.

Even though he was at a far distance, Jian Wushuang could feel the boundless aura of the nine mountains.

“It is said that there are nine sword mountains in Sky Sword Mountain and the nine sword mountains were made by the owner of Sky Sword Mountain himself. It is said to be impressive,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in his head.

“Let’s take a look.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. After he got off the spaceship, he relied on his own speed to travel to the nine loft sword mountains at the end of his sight.

After a short while, Jian Wushuang appeared in the huge, empty land.

In the empty land, there were many cultivators gathered together. Some were chatting casually, some were practicing swordsmanship, but a lot more of them were closing their eyes as they sat there. It seemed that they were comprehending something.

Jian Wushuang stood on the empty land and lifted his gaze to look at the nine mountains before him.

The nine mountains gave everyone an extremely magnificent feeling.

Just as Jian Wushuang looked at the first huge mountain… Vroom!

A terrifying sword intention spread over. The sword intention spread with great momentum that made people submit.

“This sword intention…”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes contracted suddenly, and his mind and soul immediately drowned in the sword intention.

It was quite some time until Jian Wushuang came back to reality.

“I… I am drowned by the sword intention?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

With his understanding of swordsmanship, he wouldn’t be bothered with ordinary sword intention. However, the sword intention spread by the lofty mountain made him drown uncontrollably. Just how strong was the sword intention?

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the second mountain.

Vroom!

Similarly, a terrifying sword intention spread over, but it was like all rivers running into the sea. It included everything in the universe.

Jian Wushuang was affected by the sword intention and drowned uncontrollably.

After a short while.

“So magical,” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and they beamed with excitement.

The nine lofty mountains, every one of them contained a terrifying sword intention. The strength of the sword intention was so enchanting and one would automatically submit.

Nine unique mountains. If he were to cultivate and comprehend there for a short while, his swordsmanship would definitely improve tremendously.

“My friend…” A gentle voice was heard.

Jian Wushuang turned around and looked. He saw an old man in a white robe walking towards him. The old man in a white robe looked at him in a friendly way.

“You are?” Jian Wushuang looked at the person approaching him.

“I am the white deacon of Sky Sword Mountain, Bing Cong,” the elderly in a white robe smiled.

“White deacon?” Jian Wushuang looked shocked.

One must know that the target of the task, Universe God Mo Yan, was also a white deacon of Sky Sword Mountain, who shared the same position as Bing Cong.

“Looking at your reaction, it should be your first time in Sky Sword Mountain, right?” Bing Cong smiled as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Well, of course. Only cultivators who are in Sky Sword Mountain for the first time would be so shocked when they see the nine sword mountains,” Bing Cong smiled and continued, “The nine sword mountains are the foundation of Sky Sword Mountain, also made by our owner. The nine sword mountains, every one of them contains terrifying sword intention. Also, its the best place for cultivators of swordsmanship to comprehend and cultivate.

“No wonder they are so many sword cultivators here,” Jian Wushuang looked around and saw the cultivators on the empty land were mostly sword cultivators. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“The purpose of your visit will be the same as the rest, right?” Bing Cong looked at Jian Wushuang. He had already noticed the sword that Jian Wushuang was carrying on his back.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang nodded and asked, “Mister Bing Cong, if I were to intend to comprehend and cultivate before the nine sword mountains, what would be the criteria?”

“Criteria? There are no criteria. Our owner exhorted us long ago that the nine sword mountains were open to all sword cultivators. Regardless of who they are, they can comprehend sword intentions before any sword mountain, and for however long they want,” Bing Cong said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked, “Nine such impressive sword mountains are open to the public? Just how generous is the owner of Sky Sword Mountain?”

One must know that there were many forces and sects in Eternal Chaotic World and they possessed some land of opportunities. But even their disciples had a certain limitation, let alone outsiders.

For instance, in Lineage of Star, only the disciples of Star Palace were permitted to enter Real God Hall, Scripture Depository and Reset Palace.

But Sky Sword Mountain… From Jian Wushuang point of view, although the nine sword mountains couldn’t be compared to Real God Hall favorably, it was a rare cultivation place. Especially for sword cultivators, it was definitely a chance that was hard to come by.

But the owner of Sky Sword Mountain had opened the nine sword mountains to public.

That was very generous of him.

“There were many places for comprehension and cultivation on the empty land. You can pick anywhere you like to cultivate on your own. You can cultivate for however long you wish but remember to not break Sky Sword Mountain’s rule.” Bing Cong said.

“Rule, what rule?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Very simple. Just don’t kill anyone in Sky Sword Mountain,” Bing Cong said.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes contracted.

The aim of his visit to Sky Sword Mountain was to kill someone. It seemed that he definitely had to break Sky Sword Mountain’s rule.

“What would happen if one accidentally broke Sky Sword Mountain’s rule?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“One who breaks the rule will be punished in Sky Sword Mountain, which means…” Bing Cong sighed with emotion.

“What will happen?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“I don’t know,” but Bing Cong shook his head and continued, “it is the higher up who is of Real God level in Sky Sword Mountain who is in charge of punishment ,after all. But I’ve heard that rulebreakers end very tragically.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Alright, friend. Take your time to comprehend and cultivate. If there’s any problem, you can look for me. We are the white deacon after all, and we are obliged to take care of trivial matters,” Bing Cong smiled and turned to leave.

Jian Wushuang stood there quietly as a strange light shimmered in his eyes.

“They are so many experts in Sky Sword Mountain. There are even so many Real Gods. To kill under the watch of so many experts, it definitely will not be easy.”

“But I’m not in a hurry either. I’ll stay under the nine sword mountains to comprehend slowly and get to know the environment better. Then, I’ll look for an opportunity to take action.”
