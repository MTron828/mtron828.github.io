Chapter 2261 Everything Changed

Jian Wushuang and his parents did not stay at Tang of the East for long.Next stop, they went to the Star Foggy Sea.

He had become a disciple of the Lineage of Stars there, learnt the Secret Skills of Star Palace, and met King of Venomous Worms. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Star Foggy Sea was still a dangerous place, managed by two people.

They were Lord Spirit Sound and King of Venomous Worms!

King of Venomous Worms had long stopped leeching off of Jian Wushuang and stayed at Star Foggy Sea. Occasionally, he would morph into a human and roam around Green Fire World. The few drops of Ancient Clan blood essence were enough for him to live on for a long period of time.

As for Lord Spirit Sound...

Lord Spirit Sound was from the Ancient Era, and Jian Wushuang was sure that she was not the insignificant character she claimed to be.

Lord Spirit Sound was under the Seven Star Black Sect camp – only the fittest survived that war.

Lord Spirit Sound should be no exception.

But if Lord Spirit Sound was not willing to divulge her identity and abilities, Jian Wushuang would not force the matter.

Lord Spirit Sound had stayed in the Star Foggy Sea ever since.

They spun around without bothering either of them and left.

Next, he was at the Firmament Territory!

Firmament Territory seemed like a humble frontier in the Green Fire World.

But it meant worlds to Jian Wushuang.

It was where the Ancient Sect was!

The Ancient Sect was the sect Jian Wushuang had truly joined besides the Lineage of Star, and he had always felt a sense of belonging there.

There, he had met his master Xuan Yi, and his life had changed since.

Even then, he was confused about why Xuan Yi appeared within the Ancient Sect, and why he had taken him as his disciple.

He had never understood it.

But he knew for sure that he would not be the man he was without his master.

Ancient Sect was in the middle of a large mountain range.

He stood on the void above the Ancient Sect, watching over everything.

Ever since Green Fire World’s cultivating environment had changed tremendously, every frontier had been affected, and Firmament Territory was no exception.

Thinking back, there had only been four Dao Masters at Ancient Sect and they were considered extremely strong.

Now, Dao Masters... they were nothing more than ants.

Green Fire World now had countless cultivators of Dao Master level and above.

They even had plentiful Heaven Masters, Sector Gods and Real Gods.

Ancient Sect has managed to remain standing after all those years not only due to Jian Wushuang, but because they had three Almighties.

One of them was his brother Xue Lingtian.

He had three clan brothers, but after the war between the Jin Kingdom, only Xue Lingtian had survived. He now held a high position within the Green Fire World.

Next was Jian Wushuang’s own Lineal Disciple Lin Lan!

Lin Lan had limited talents – his original limit had been at Real God.

But she had an incredible master, and Jian Wushuang doted on her a lot. Jian Wushuang had gone through several methods to help her break through and had finally helped her reach Sir God after consuming a high-level elixir found by Wang Yuan.

But Jian Wushuang would only help her up to the Sir God level. Jian Wushuang could make her an Emperor God with enough resources, but it was not necessary.

Being a Sir God was enough for her to roam the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Wushuang, you want to go down and take a look?” Jian Nantian asked.

Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng had been beside Jian Wushuang for some time but realised he had not moved an inch.

“It’s fine,” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

There was no need to interact with the Ancient Sect cultivators. He made frequent contact with Xue Lingtian and Lin Lan anyway.

“Next, let’s head to Ancient Worlds,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ancient Worlds? Nanyang Land?” Jian Nantian flinched.

Nanyang Land was where they had been born.

And the Sword Marquis Mansion, the Sword Pavilion!

Jian Wushuang remembered that when he was young, he had trained like mad to take over from his father as Master of Sword Pavilion.

The last time he had been there, he had known that the Sword Marquis Mansion in Nanyang Land had been eradicated, but its successors had remained.

Jian Wushuang and his parents made their way there and started searching.

Even after countless generations, they could sense them via bloodline.

Not long after, they found the descendants of the Sword Marquis Mansion.

Unexpectedly, they came to a large imperial city of a great dynasty.

His descendants, the Jian Clan, were the royal family. They were in their prime.

“Not bad, huh?” Jian Nantian looked at the imperial city from above with interest.

“I requested the Ancient Sect to take care of the descendants, to make sure the lineage does not end. They should have followed my request and nothing more. Really impressive that they could make a dynasty out of it,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

The last time he had been at the Ancient Worlds, only a few people of the Sword Marquis Mansion survived, and they were mediocre.

But after a few thousands of years, everything had changed.

Not only had the Sword Marquis Mansion lineage passed things down, but they also created a dynasty.

“It’s a shame they won’t recognise us ancestors,” Jian Nantian said.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Tens of thousands of years was not considered too long at Green Fire World or Eternal Chaotic World, but it was too long for the Ancient Worlds.

The Sword Marquis Mansion had seen countless generations across those years, of course, the descendants would not know about them.

They would not know about the Sword Marquis Mansion, or Jian Wushuang.

The person they worshipped now was the great man that started the dynasty a thousand years ago.

Despite Jian Wushuang being endlessly stronger than that clansman, they did not recognise him.

“Let’s go.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and they left.
