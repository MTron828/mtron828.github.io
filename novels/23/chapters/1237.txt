Chapter 1238: Leave Early!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Martial Arts cultivation was about accumulating.

A Dao Master only needed to develop a Dao that belonged to himself.

A Celestial Master, however, needed to combine three Daos to form an Immortal Dharma Body.

The Immortal Dharma Body transformed one’s body!

Since Jian Wushuang’s three strongest Sword Principles had been merged, his body naturally began to turn.

The transformation was fundamental.

Jian Wushuang kept his eyes closed, but at this moment he could clearly feel his body undergoing major changes.

His flesh and blood, his bones and countless cells throughout his body, were all strengthening in every second.

“This feeling…”

Jian Wushuang felt comfortable and happy.

He immersed himself in this transformation.

However, on the battlefield outside, the two camps were still fighting brutally.

It had almost a quarter since the beginning of the battle. During the time, countless Green Fire World experts madly fought against the Jin Kingdom soldiers. They had been desperately resisting the Jin Kingdom’s attack. Countless experts had deceased consequently.

There used to be a thousand Battle Formations formed by Dao Masters when they left the Battle Fortress. Now, after a quarter, less than three hundred of them remained!

In other words, seven hundred Battle Formations had already broken down.

As soon as a Battle Formation was torn apart, most of the Dao Masters were ruthlessly killed by the Jin Kingdom. Only less than 10% of the experts luckily escaped and returned to the Battle Fortress. After that, without a recovery, they would immediately form a new Battle Formation with other remaining Dao Masters!

When the new Battle Formation was formed, they would immediately set off again.

The previous 1,200 Celestial Masters had also decreased to less than 500 of them.

The remaining Celestial Masters, although heavily injured in body and strength, still fought on. As long as they survived, they would do their utmost to make the Jin Kingdom suffer.

As for the Palace Masters at the level of Universe Master, nearly half of them had died!

The remaining Universe Masters went on killing.

Kill!

Kill them all!

The whole world darkened because of the terrifying killing.

On the vast battlefield, there had been numerous bodies beyond recognition. The entire ground was covered in blood like a blood sea. It was appalling.

Boom!

A thunderous sound banged.

With the bang, a Blast Wave spread. A nearby Green Fire World Celestial Master and two Jin Kindom Celestial Masters did not dodge it. Within the range of the Blast Wave’s power, they were smashed into blood fog and floated downward.

“Humph!”

Fully covered in a black armor, Samsara Temple Master grunted like an ancient fierce beast. He tried hard to slow his pace in the Void.

His face was still red, and his face under the black armor had been distorted completely. At the same time, he was also quivering with rage, as if he could collapse at any time.

“Go on, don’t stop!”

Sneering in the Void, the Jin Kingdom monarch held his spear calmly, tongue–in–cheek.

Samsara Temple Master had been fighting against him. Now, Samsara Temple Master had obviously stretched to the limit. However, the Jin Kingdom monarch looked as calm as ever, and his aura was still great and aggressive.

Seeing this, Samsara Temple Master bit his lips, his eyes were filled with endless anger and unwillingness.

“Is this my best?”

Although unwilling to admit it, Samsara Temple Master knew very clearly about his current state.

The Blood Fire Elixir’s strength almost ran out, and his life was drawing to an end.

Now, he could only strike one more time!

“Ha ha…”

Samsara Temple Master suddenly raised his head and laughed heartily!

He laughed hysterically but looked more determined than ever.

On the battlefield, all Green Fire World experts turned their heads hearing Samsara Temple Master laugh.

“Void, Tang Emperor, Red Lotus, and everyone in the Green Fire World!”

“Samsara will leave early!”

When he finished, he aura surged. Once again, he rushed toward the Jin Kingdom monarch like a fierce beast.

“The last counterattack before you die?” The Jin Kingdom monarch made fun of him and was ready to kill Samsara Temple Master once and for all.

However, by the time Samsara Temple Master approached, before the Jin Kingdom monarch struck…

“Burst!”

A roar rang through the Void, followed by a thunderous bang.

One of the oldest Palace Masters in the Green Fire World, Samsara Temple Master, blew up himself!!

Seeing this, the Green Fire World experts were all crying in their hearts. Their hearts ached so much that they seemed to bleed with endless grief.

But soon, they turned this grief into bitter feelings of resentment. Then they did their utmost to make the Jin Kingdom experts suffer.

“Kill!”

“Kill this bunch of bastards!”

“Jin Kingdom, prepare to die!”

Roars resounded through heaven and earth. The already fierce battlefield became crazier!

“Samsara!”

Void Temple Master stood in the Void and watched Samsara Temple Master explode. He was shaking. Then, he took out his Blood Fire Elixir, without hesitation, he swallowed it.

As soon as he swallowed the Blood Fire Elixir, his aura also skyrocketed.

“Jin Kingdom!”

Resentfully, Void Temple Master directly rushed toward the Jin Kingdom monarch.

Having been affected by the explosion of Samsara Temple Master, the Jin Kingdom monarch stopped briefly to collect himself as Void Temple Master rushed toward him.

“Again? Humph!”

The Jin Kingdom monarch was finally provoked, he immediately struck out.

Although he was not as good as Samsara Temple Master, he did try his best to gain them more time with the help of the Blood Fire Elixir.

After a while… Bang!

Another violent explosion sounded.

“Brother Samsara… I’ll go with you!”

Following Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master exploded himself as well!

Both two overlords on the Green Fire World had fallen!

At the moment, in the Battle Fortress, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on the ground. Finally, he was in the final step of the transformation!
