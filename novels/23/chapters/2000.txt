Chapter 2001: White Hair Grey Eyes

“How many years? How many years has it been?”

“I finally recovered my power entirely!”

“Hahaha.”

The two meter tall savage man laughed hysterically. His voice reverberated in the pavilion and into the figure in black’s ears.

After quite some time, he stopped laughing. Then, the savage man’s beast-like cold gaze cast onto the person in front of him.

This person was different from the figures in black because he was in a white robe.

“How’s the preparation going?” The savage man asked.

“Everything is ready. We are only waiting for Demon King to return,” the man in the white robe replied politely.

“Very good,” the savage man smiled and continued to ask, “How about the other two places? How is their preparation going?”

“I’m not sure. They should be ready too,” the man in the white robe replied.

“Humph. If so, what are you waiting for? Send them a message right now. Tell them I want to see them,” the savage man commanded.

“Yes,” the man in the white robe nodded and quickly went to make arrangements.

After a few days, in the boundless dark void.

The boundless dark void seemed to be out of tune with Eternal Chaotic World. However, it was not related to ancient times nor the first era.

At the end of the dark void, there was a lofty throne towering.

It was the savage man seated on the throne while the man in the white robe standing next to him.

However, in the void there were another two thrones besides the one the savage man was seated on.

Vroom!!!

There was a strange power that started to concentrate. Then, on the throne right opposite the savage man, there was a lady dressed in white that had white gauze over her face.

Although the lady dressed in white had her face covered, her body and her temperament were still as enchanting.

If she were to remove her gauze, the lady dressed in white might even stir a carnage of war with a word or a smile.

“Leng Ruxue greets Mister Demon King,” the lady dressed in white appeared before the savage man and she bowed politely to show respect.

Looking at the incomer, the savage man creased his eyebrows and bellowed, “What happened? Where did Old Man Fen go? Why did he send a little girl who is still wet behind the ears over?”

“Lord Fen is at an important stage. He can’t be distracted so I came instead,” the lady dressed in white, Leng Ruxue replied coldly.

“Humph, you’re just a little girl. You can represent Old Man Fen? You can represent Holocaust Sect?” The savage man smirked in disdain.

“Mister Demon King,” the man in the white robe next to the savage man said softly, “Although Leng Ruxue wasn’t old, her skills are impressive. After Lord Fen went into seclusion, Holocaust Sect broke apart like scattered sand. However, not too long ago, Holocaust Sect was united by someone using thunderous measures. The person who united Holocaust Sect is Leng Ruxue. She is not the Master of Holocaust Sect.”

“Oh?” The savage man exclaimed but sneered, “Just little girl and she can unite Holocaust Sect? Is it because Old Man Fen gave his full support? The Old Man Fen has bad vision. He found a little girl to be his successor? Could it be that Old Man Fen live for too long and he has lustful desire churning in him, he was then charmed by this little girl?”

Although the savage man was joking, he obviously sounded scornful.

Just then, the lady dressed in white who was opposite him, Leng Ruxue, suddenly lifted her head. As she lifted her head, there was a special mark that appeared in between her eyebrows. Her eyes turned white without any hint of blood.

She had long, black hair but it instantly turned white as well. Her white hair was swaying along with the breeze.

There was an unprecedented extermination aura that spread.

The extermination aura was entirely different from the power of extermination performed by extermination doctrine.

The extermination aura didn’t derive from the power of heavenway but from Leng Ruxue herself. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“White hair, grey eyes, the body of divine providence. Everywhere she passes, there will be no sign of life!” The savage man creased his eyebrows and his face grew solemn.

He looked at Leng Ruxue again and there wasn’t any contempt in his eyes anymore.

“No wonder Old Man Fen picked you. It turned out that you are the person’s successor?” The savage man said in a deep voice.

When he brought up the person, there was a flash of strange expression in his eyes with a tinge of fear.

It was obvious that the person that he was referring to was very terrifying to him.

“I respect Mister Demon King, but I hope that when Mister Demon King speaks, you’ll take note of your identity. Otherwise…” Leng Ruxue, who had white hair and grey eyes, had a flash of unique light in her grey eyes. The light was blurry yet contained boundless demonic power.

“Amazing, she is already awakened until that state?” The savage man was terrified and his stone calmed down significantly, “It is merely a misunderstanding. Little girl, no, I mean, Lord Leng, don’t misunderstand!”

“Humph!”

Leng Ruxue let out a cold humph and the special mark in between her eyebrows slowly disappeared. Her white hair and grey eyes gradually resumed to its original color.

The extermination aura soaring from her body earlier gradually dispersed too.

“Mister Demon King, shall we get down to business then?” Leng Ruxue said coldly.

“Of course,” the savage man smiled. There was no scornful look when he looked at Leng Ruxue, but there was no fear in his eyes either.

After all, they weren’t in ancient times.

If in ancient times, he absolutely would be fearful when he saw Leng Ruxue.

But then, any one of them were restricted. He wasn’t even afraid of Emperor Thirteen, who was once in the top five during the ancient war back then. He naturally wouldn’t be fearful of Leng Ruxue as well.

Just then, there was a figure that slowly substantiated on the last throne.

The figure was covered in blood. It looked just like a bloody statue with an unclear appearance. It was obvious that it was just an incarnation.

“We are waiting for you,” the savage man smiled.

Leng Ruxue looked at the bloody statue too.

“Let’s be straightforward. We are ready and it is your call,” the bloody statue revealed an empty, bloody eye socket as he glanced at the savage man and Leng Ruxue.

“I have no issues,” the savage man replied.

“Holocaust Sect is ready. The only thing is that Lord Fen needs a little longer until he can wake up again,” Leng Ruxue said.

“As long as you are here, it doesn’t matter if Old Man Fen is here,” the savage man said.

Leng Ruxue looked cold and she didn’t reply to that comment.

“As we are all ready, let’s take action according to the agreed plan!”

“Alright,” the savage man nodded heavily.

They had been waiting for this day for a very, very long time.
