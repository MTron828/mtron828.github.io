Chapter 85: The Accident

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The four, including Jian Wushuang, hastily and quietly went ahead in the forest.

Boom!

A huge roar could be heard nearby with a bright sound of animals.

“They have launched their attack,” proclaimed Ye Mei.

“We need to find the two-horned beast quickly and begin our attack as well,” the indigo-robed man said.

“You don’t need to find it because it is running towards us,” Jian Wushuang said immediately.

The other three, including Ye Mei, had no time to figure out what was happening because the humongous two-horned Rhino appeared in front of them while knocking down rows of trees.

“The Blue-eyed Rhino with two horns.” They were shocked.

“Kill it!”

Without hesitation, all four of them began releasing their Spiritual Power, after which they launched their attacks.

Among the four warriors, the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man quickly displayed their strength. With one using an axe while the other used a long spear, they launch a powerful attack toward the incoming Blue-eyed Rhino.

Jian Wushuang also immediately launched an attack with his sword, releasing power equivalent to the Initial Gold Core Realm.

Among them, Ye Mei seemed to be the strongest.

Swish!

As she attacked, a streak of sword shadow using Waterdrop Sword Essence slashed towards the Blue-eyed Rhino. Before landing on its body, the sword shadow split into three dazzling streaks of sword light.

“impressive swordsmanship.” The indigo-robed man exclaimed.

Jian Wushuang frowned and shook his head, “Her swordsmanship is good, but she is too naive and hasty.”

Jian Wushuang understood clearly, killing the Blue-eyed Rhino was not a problem. The real issue was the fight over the two horns. However, since Ye Mei showed her strength already, the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man would be cautious around Ye Mei.

Jian Wushuang noticed that the indigo-robed man seemed to be shocked by Ye Mei. In fact, both of them had a weird look in their eyes. Jian Wushuang immediately knew that as soon as the Blue-eyed Rhino was dead both men would work together and launch a sneak attack on Ye Mei for the sake of acquiring the horns.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Although the attack landed on the Blue-eyed Rhino’s body, only three white marks were left behind on its hard shell.

“The shell is too hard. Aim for the stomach, it should be softer and it’s not protected by the shell.” Jian Wushuang shouted.

“I do not need your advice.” Ye Mei glanced at him before launching an attack towards the Blue-eyed Rhino’s belly.

“Howl!”

As the Blue-eyed Rhino roared, It stomped on the ground with its hooves, causing the ground to tremble. Then it lowered its head, pointing the two horns at Ye Mei, and attacked.

It charged straight towards Ye Mei with its golden horns.

But, it was so big and awkward, Ye Mei easily moved around it and let it pass.

“Kill it quickly.”

“It’s trying to run away.”

The indigo-robed man was attacking as he exclaimed happily.

Although the Blue-eyed Rhino had great defense, it was still just a beast. Jian Wushuang and the others worked together to attack it. In particular, Ye Mei aggressively attacked the beast’s belly. As a result, the Blue-eyed Rhino had already reached its limit.

“It is going to die.” Ye Mei had a delighted look on her face, but she still felt contempt towards Jian Wushuang.

She had played the biggest part in killing this Blue-eyed Rhino. Of course, the other three did work together and assist her. But Jian Wushuang only helped to prevent the beast from escaping, so it wasn’t odd that she felt contempt towards him.

“With this level of strength, you thought you could help me?” Ye Mei thought.

But at this moment…a violently rampaging Spiritual Power appeared as a two-meter tall figure jumped out of the forest.

“Not good!”

“Another beast?”

” It’s a… Herculean Demonic Monkey!”

“Profound Gold Core Realm!”

Ye Mei and the indigo-robed man were shocked when it appeared, causing their expressions to become slightly pale.

Even a normal Herculean Demonic Monkey is powerful, let alone this one, which is in the Profound Gold Core Realm.

The Herculean Demonic Monkey, in the Profound Gold Core Realm, was stronger than them since they were in the Initial Gold Core Realm.

“This is a catastrophe.” Ye Mei’s face turned pale.

“You three should finish killing the Blue-eyed Rhino. I will deal with the Herculean Demonic Monkey.” Jian Wushaung said in a deep voice.

“You?” When Ye Mei looked towards Jian Wushuang, he had already rushed towards the Herculean Demonic Monkey.

“A Herculean Demonic Monkey at the Profound Gold Core Realm.” Jian Wushuang smiled, releasing a strong Spiritual Power that surpassed the Spiritual Sea Realm. At the same time, a massive amount of Earth Sword-Essence began to fill the area.

“The seventh move of the Formless Sword Wave .”

As he shouted, his Triple-kill Sword moved to attack the beast.

Countless sword shadows gathered together to form an immensely heavy mountain, which began descending towards Herculean Demonic Monkey.

“Damn humans.”

The Herculean Demonic Monkey’s eyes turned red as it launched an attack that seemed to be able to shatter Heaven and Earth.

Ye Mei and the indigo-robed man were shocked when they saw this. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“That guy, does he want to die?”

“With his strength, he shouldn’t even be able to defend against a Herculean Demonic Monkey in the Profound Gold Core Realm. Yet, He dared to attack it head-on. He must want to die.”

“Stupid!” Ye Mei cursed him.

Herculean Demonic Monkeys were known for their strength. Even if a warrior in the same Realm was fighting with it, they would be careful and would avoid facing its strength head-on power. Let alone, Jian Wushuang, who was only in the Spiritual Sea Realm.

He must be crazy!

Ye Mei and the indigo-robed man thought Jian Wushuang had lost his mind.

What happened next surprised all three of them.

Boom!

When they saw what happened, they were shocked by Jian Wushuang. The beast, which reached the Profound Gold Core Realm, flew out like a bullet, smashing into a tree that was more than ten meters behind it.

Boom!

The tree, unable to withstand the impact from the Herculean Demonic Monkey, was smashed to pieces.
