Chapter 2475: The Battle Strength of an Ultimate God!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The glade immediately fell into chaos as the fighting began.

All those sects’ experts were mostly First-Class Divine Demons, but there were also many Peak Divine Demons totaling up to a terrifyingly huge number.

At that moment, all of them charged forward with only one purpose—to kill Jian Wushuang!

“Little Brother!” Zhuo Bing screamed as loud as she could from among the crowd, wanting to head up, but Ling Dan and Ancient Star Temple experts stopped her with all their might.

On the other hand, Elder Ling He and the Seventh Elder from Narcissus Island were both silent while Elder Wujian’s body was trembling from feeling extremely helpless. Those few Narcissus Island disciples behind them looked at each other and quietly shook their heads.

Nobody could help Jian Wushuang.

He was on his own.

However, Jian Wushuang wore a frosty smile when he looked at the experts from various sects charging at him from every direction. “Is this a siege? Boring.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. In Saint’s Tomb, he had spent most of his time surrounded and besieged by his attackers causing him to have grown bored of this tactic.

He had not expected that as soon as he exited Saint’s Tomb, he was once again besieged by those experts on the glade.

“Is besieging really effective?” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself, but the Blood Mountain Sword on his back was already in his hand.

Jian Wushuang’s figure started moving without any forewarning.

Ring!

In the void, a figure which looked exactly like Jian Wushuang appeared.

That figure was not a Space-time shadow, but a hologram instead!

Formation of holograms was a requirement in order to achieve the First Stage of Space-time Law after all.

Leaving a hologram in the original spot he was standing, Jian Wushuang’s figure quickly flashed off before returning once again with his real body overlapping with the hologram.

However, his Blood Mountain Sword has already been slowly returned to its sheath.

Chaos still persisted between Heaven and Earth as those various sects’ experts were still pouncing toward Jian Wushuang with strong waves of killing intent.

However, their figures could only charge halfway.

“Stop, stop quickly!” shouted a fearful voice causing all those experts to stop and looked over the void before them.

Seeing that caused all of them to open their eyes wide!

The Four Great Peak Divine Demons of the Great Compassion Sect appeared in that void spot closest to Jian Wushuang at that very moment. They naturally reached Jian Wushuang first as they were the closest to him and also took the very first attack initiative.

However, what really shocked everyone was the Four Great Peak Divine Demons, including Hanyun who was the strongest among them, had their heads severed from their bodies.

Their heads severed from their bodies!

Their four heads were flying across the void, yet to touch the ground.

“D—Dead?” a Peak Divine Demon said with a stutter.

“I think I saw a sword-light flashed by just now.”

“Yes, I saw it too, but it vanished too quickly. I thought I was hallucinating, but then...”

“It’s Jian Wushuang. It must be him. He has made a move!”

Voices of fear rose from everywhere.

Those experts who were charging toward Jian Wushuang looked at him once again before looking at those corpses belonging to the Great Compassion Sect’s Peak Divine Demons. They felt their skulls numbed as fear crept into their minds!

The Four Great Peak Divine Demons had attacked at the same time but were already killed before they could even see Jian Wushuang’s attacks.

It only took one strike to kill off the Four Great Peak Divine Demons. Even Hanyun, who was the strongest among them, did not even have the chance to scream before they were eliminated.

What kind of ability was that?

“An Ultimate God, the battle strength of an Ultimate God!”

“That’s right, it must be an Ultimate God. I’m not mistaken. Only an Ultimate God could kill the Four Great Peak Divine Demons in one sword stroke.”

“This Jian Wushuang actually has the battle strength of an Ultimate God?”

“Oh Heavens, did we just try to attack an expert who possesses the battle strength of an Ultimate God?”

All those experts who came to besiege and attack Jian Wushuang went completely nuts.

Other than that, there were many among them who had sensed the explosiveness of Jian Wushuang’s divine powers.

As a Perfect Chaotic Creature, Jian Wushuang was capable of completely suppressing his divine powers. In normal circumstances, nobody could determine what his true abilities were. However, he definitely needed to use his divine powers once he started fighting and would no longer be able to hide it at that time. As such, they could now sense Jian Wushuang’s divine powers had reached the stage of Second-Class Divine Demon.

One must know that when Jian Wushuang was in Peak Chaotic Realm, he could already defeat 50 First-Class Divine Demons.

Now that he had broken through two realms, shooting from Peak Chaotic Realm directly to Second-Class Divine Demon, his ability would have surely surged immensely as well. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This fact ascertained to them that Jian Wushuang had truly possessed an Ultimate God’s battle strength!

“Retreat. Retreat right now!”

“Back off right away. An Ultimate God’s battle strength isn’t something we can deal with.”

The various sects’ experts immediately backed off and gave up on attacking Jian Wushuang without hesitation.

They had no choice, as the Ultimate God and Divine Demon realm’s gap was just too big. Nobody could possibly cross-over that gap.

Even though there were many experts with tens of Peak Divine Demons among them, they would never dare besiege and attack another expert with an Ultimate God’s battle strength even with double that amount as it would be equivalent to seeking death.

If an Ultimate God unleashed his full abilities, killing Peak Divine Demons would be as easy as killing chickens and dogs.

Jian Wushuang sneered from seeing those experts retreating. “They were just being so gung-ho about killing me, but now they are shamefully running away at full speed.”

Those experts’ faces were boiling red upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s insult but could do nothing about it.

Jian Wushuang smiled again. “Never mind. I’m in a pretty good mood today. I’m too lazy to bring myself to your level. However, if you really want to kill me...I can give you a chance to do that, but you should at least get someone with real abilities. You lot are far from qualified.”

Jian Wushuang did not care about those experts’ reactions around him after speaking. Instead, he sat on the ground in the lotus position and closed his eyes.

It was obvious he was just going to sit there and wait for those sects to find some real experts.

That was true as well.

Jian Wushuang’s advancement in Saint’s Tomb was way too great, especially after he absorbed the entire Divine Power Ocean and made a breakthrough to the Second-Class Divine Demon in one go. His advancement was so huge that he did not know which level he even was in at that point.

He needed an opponent, a true expert to fight with.

However, the First-Class Divine Demons and Peak Divine Demons that were present could not fulfill his requirements.

He had to wait for the arrival of a higher-level expert!
