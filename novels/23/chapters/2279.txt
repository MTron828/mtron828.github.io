2280 The Area Filled With Black Mis

“Now, no one can disturb us anymore.” Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Ruxue coldly.

Leng Ruxue knitted her eyebrows before relaxing. She said indifferently, “Do you really think that you can suppress me alone?”

“Well, we won’t know if I don’t try,” Jian Wushuang muttered before falling silent.

In the air above, there had originally been a dark and vast space. Now, it had been replaced by an extremely vivid and beautiful Picture Scroll World.

There were mountains, there was water. There were nine extremely large and majestic provinces. Each of them looked extremely realistic.

“Nine Province Seal... The fifth seal!”

Jian Wushuang then formed various seals with his hands.

From the Picture Scroll World, a majestic continent appeared with an incredible pressure.

The fifth seal of the Nine Province Seal was the strongest seal that Jian Wushuang could cast given the amount of divine power he had.

He could cast the sixth seal, but he had to use certain trump cards.

Even though Jian Wushuang had only cast the fifth seal, he felt that it was sufficient as there was no way Leng Ruxue could take its power.

The terrifying but majestic province descended slowly.

This province was so large that it completely covered Leng Ruxue and the space around her.

No matter how unique her Martial art motion was, it would be impossible for her to use it under the pressure of the majestic province.

“I am afraid that you cannot suppress me with just this level of power,” Leng Ruxue said with coldness in her eyes.

“If this is not enough, how about now?” A ray of killing intent flashed across Jian Wushuang’s eyes. There were nine stars that hovered between Jian Wushuang’s eyes. The overbearing bloodline power of an ancient god flowed within him. The two ancient god stars at the very top crumbled instantly.

Ancient God Secret Skill, Star Destruction Skill!

Jian Wushuang destroyed two stars at once as his overall power level rose by a great amount.

The power of the majestic province that was descending skyrocketed.

Leng Ruxue finally turned pale.

“I am not an expert at exchanging blows using brute power. It will be difficult for me to withstand this attack. There is no other way, I have to use Golden Flame again.” Leng Ruxue made the decision immediately.

“Heaven’s Mandate, Golden Flame!”

Within Leng Ruxue’s grey irises, a spark of golden light appeared once again.

The light was still slightly grey and blurry initially. However, it burned like two golden fireballs within her eyes.

Hum~

A spark of a hot Golden Flame appeared in front of Leng Ruxue. It then exploded and covered the entire space.

When the majestic province came into contact with the Golden Flame, it started to burn at a crazy speed as the divine power that made up the province started to evaporate.

At the same time, the sea of flame made up by the Golden Flame also headed for Jian Wushuang.

“This move again?”

Jian Wushuang’s face turned dark. He knew how powerful this move was. He immediately channelled his divine power and left the area burning with the Golden Flames in the shortest time possible.

“Sure enough, I have used another twenty percent of my divine power.” Jian Wushuang frowned as he whipped out a Seven Treasure Divine Elixir and drank it.

With the help of the Seven Treasure Divine Elixir, Jian Wushuang’s divine power started to regenerate at an incredible speed. Before long, he had recovered half of his total divine power.

Jian Wushuang looked over at Leng Ruxue once again.

Leng Ruxue looked very miserable.

She had only gained control of the Golden Flame recently. It was already very difficult for her to cast it once. This was the second time she had cast it within a short period of time. This time, she had been severely injured by the powerful backlash of forcefully casting this skill.

“Pfft!”

She spat out a mouth of blood which immediately dyed her veil crimson red.

She did not fall to the ground. When Jian Wushuang dashed out of the sea of Golden Flame, she was already headed for the passageway using the martial art motion she mastered.

“You will not escape!”

A flash of killing intent was seen in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as he pointed towards the space Leng Ruxue was in.

“Ancient God Secret Skill, Moon Picking Skill!”

Boom~~~

Spacetime shook.

With his immense divine power and bloodline power, the spacetime was completely sealed off before it started to collapse on Leng Ruxue.

“What?” Leng Ruxue was shocked.

She had mastered an eerie martial arts motion, but it was difficult for her to move when the spacetime around her was sealed off by the secret skill.

At the same time, a soft palm appeared out of nowhere.

This palm felt as though it belonged to a mother as it headed for Leng Ruxue in a slow and gentle manner.

“Master!” Leng Ruxue screamed for help.

The beautiful lady was in the middle of an intense battle against Emperor Thirteen. Even though she had seen this and wanted to help, she could not as she was too busy fighting Emperor Thirteen, unable to pull away.

“Get to the area covered in black mist,” the beautiful lady said in a low voice.

Leng Ruxue focused her vision at the area covered in black mist. The passageway was where the Heaven’s Horizon was, and where this Heaven and Earth’s limit was. It was within the area where the black mist was.

Even though she was still a distance away from the passageway, she was relatively close to the area covered in black mist.

“I am going to risk it!”

A flash of madness was seen on Leng Ruxue’s face as the golden light lit up her eyes once again.

The Golden Flame appeared again.

This time, the area it covered was extremely small. It was barely large enough to cover the large hand. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The large hand dissipated as the Golden Flame burnt it away. At the same time, the seal of the spacetime around her was gone.

Even though Jian Wushuang was right on her tail, Leng Ruxue created a small gap for her to escape using the Golden Flame.

Whoosh!

Leng Ruxue turned into a shooting star as she escaped into the area filled with grey mist.

Her face was extremely pale.

“Third time. The third time is my limit. If I were to cast the Golden Flame a fourth time, I would definitely die!” Leng Ruxue’s body trembled.

However, she was still a distance away from the passageway.

Jian Wushuang did not stop as he followed her into this area covered in black mist.

Jian Wushuang realised something was different the moment he stepped foot into the area covered in black mist.

“This area is different from the outside world. The Restrictions of Heaven and Earth are not as powerful here.” Jian Wushuang’s face turned slightly pale.

With weaker Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, the experts from the ancient past, including the beautiful woman, could use a greater portion of their power. This was not good news for Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, he noticed two figures walking out of the passageway slowly.
