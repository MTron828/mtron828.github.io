Chapter 3025: Something Was Not Right

——

“So powerful!”

Jian Wushuang’s figure rose up again, but his heart was still full of shock.

From the collision just now, he could feel that the Magic Note King was indeed not as powerful as him in terms of strength and power, but the Magic Note King was much more powerful than him in terms of rule comprehension and the absolute arts he created.

For example, although the sword skill ‘Xi Xiang’ was an absolute art that focused on power, it was only at the second level.

The Magic Note King was a genuine rank four True Saint, and the absolute arts he had created were all at the fourth level.

There was a gap of two levels in absolute arts. Even though the Magic Note King’s divine power was inferior to his, he could still crush him in a real fight.

If Jian Wushuang was merely shocked by the strength of the Magic Note King, who was a rank four True Saint, then the Magic Note King was extremely shocked at this moment.

“I only used divine power and the power of the rule of darkness to attack him. It’s normal that I was unable to defeat his divine body. However, I used my own magic weapon and absolute art to attack him. Although I was able to defeat him, I was still unable to defeat his divine body?” The Magic Note King’s face darkened, “It seems like I’ll have to spend some effort to destroy his God body.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Magic Note King flipped his other hand, and a black hammer appeared.

Two black hammers were held in Magic Note King’s hands, each of them giving off a terrifying aura.

“Dark meteor fall!”

The Magic Note King’s eyes turned cold, and the endless power of the rule of darkness surged from his body. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Rumble! The world was completely dark as if it had fallen into darkness.

In the endless darkness, the two meteors slid down in an instant.

With an invincible momentum, they smashed toward Jian Wushuang.

Heaven and earth shook.

In terms of power, either of the two meteors was much more powerful than the sledgehammer that the Magic Note King had just swung.

This move was the strongest move that the Magic Note King had created over a long period of time!

If it was at the general level, this move was an advanced level rank four secret skill!

It was personally executed by the Magic Note King, so the power of this move could only be described as terrifying.

“This hammer…” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes. He could feel the shocking power of the two meteors. In an instant, a supreme sword essence burst out from his body.

This sword essence came from the supreme sword essence of the Blood Mountain Sword.

The sword essence soared into the sky and swept out.

Jian Wushuang himself transformed into the master of sword principle. With the support of this sword essence, his overall battle strength rose to another level.

“Xi Xiang!”

Without pausing for a moment, Jian Wushuang directly performed the first move of Xi Xiang.

The sword light swung out and collided directly with the two streams of light. However, when the two collided, Jian Wushuang already felt a huge force coming at him. This force suppressed his Blood Mountain Sword and made his arms bend, then the stream of light crushed the Blood Mountain Sword and continued to hit his divine body.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang groaned. He licked his throat and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

His divine body began to tremble crazily. His internal organs trembled, causing great damage. However, the damage was quickly repaired by his divine power.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang was sent flying again.

“Your divine body is really amazing. As expected, in addition to the high-level protective armor you’re wearing, you must have cultivated a very powerful body-refining secret skill. Otherwise, your divine body would not collapse under my attack.” The Magic Note King stood high in the sky, he looked down at Jian Wushuang.

“However, although your divine body did not collapse directly, you suffered a serious injury under my hammer. Although you’ve recovered now, it must have consumed a lot of divine power to repair such a serious injury. You might be able to withstand such a scene once or twice, but if you do it a few more times, I’m afraid you won’t be able to withstand it.”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom who were watching the battle nodded in agreement.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang had been severely injured, but he had fully recovered with his immortal body and divine power.

However, it would take a lot of divine power to recover from such a serious injury, and it would take a lot of divine power to recover after a few more rounds. When his divine power was exhausted, he would definitely die.

“Magic Note Kingdom, you talk too much nonsense.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, and his voice was extremely cold. “If you want to fight, then let’s fight.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang rushed out again.

Without any intention of retreating, he rushed toward Magic Note King. Even though he knew that he was no match for Magic Note King, he did not hesitate to wield his long sword and perform the ‘Xi Xiang’ move.

He wanted to fight head-on with the Magic Note King and determine the outcome of the battle.

“You’re courting death!”

The Magic Note King laughed disdainfully when he saw this scene. The two black sledgehammers in his hands smashed out again.

The same scene happened again. Jian Wushuang was still sent flying and his divine body was seriously injured again.

“Again!”

However, after he regained his balance, Jian Wushuang did not back down at all. Instead, he continued to charge forward ferociously.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The two collided repeatedly. Each time, Jian Wushuang was completely crushed and his divine body was heavily injured. However, he did not seem to care at all and continued to charge forward after repairing it with divine power.

Just like that, they collided again and again.

At first, the Magic Note King thought that Jian Wushuang was reckless. However, after the repeated collisions, the Magic Note King vaguely sensed that something was amiss.

“No, Jian Wushuang is so talented and can become an Immortal Saint. He is not a fool. He knows that he is not as strong as me, but he still insists on fighting me head-on. It’s too strange to compete with my strength!” Magic Note King frowned.

It was indeed strange.

He had long seen that Jian Wushuang was comprehending the space-time principles.

The space-time principles focused on speed, but it was not very good at strength and power. Jian Wushuang’s speed and movement skills were so amazing that he should have made full use of his advantage in speed and movement skills, but what was the result?

Jian Wushuang had only used his swordsmanship to fight against him blindly, and every time he collided with his divine body, he was seriously injured, but he did not stop at all. This was certainly suspicious.

“This kid must be planning something. There must be something that I haven’t noticed yet.” The Magic Note King narrowed his eyes.
