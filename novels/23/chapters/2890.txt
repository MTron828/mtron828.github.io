Chapter 2891: World Shock (2)

——

In the huge volcanic space in the deepest part of Fire Cloud Castle.

Bi Yan stood there respectfully. In front of him, Mo Tao was attentively looking at a mirror image.

This mirror image was the scene where Jian Wushuang fought with the three Immortal Saints.

It was clear from the beginning to the end.

“Haha, awesome, awesome!”

After Mo Tao finished watching the scene, he laughed out loud.

“A Divine Master killed two of the three Immortal Saints and scared one away. This Jian Yi is amazing.” Mo Tao’s eyes were shining.

He was also an Immortal Saint, but his battle strength was equal to Realm Lord Tian Qu.

However, Jian Wushuang had killed Realm Lord Tian Qu with one strike at the later stage of the mirror image. He was shocked by his strength.

If Jian Wushuang was so powerful, how could Bi Yan be so powerful?

Bi Yan also saw the mirror image and was terrified.

Now he finally understood why Jian Wushuang could address his master as Brother Mo.

“Jian Yi is very talented and has unfathomable strength and means. The magic sword is not lost in his hands.” Mo Tao smiled and immediately sent a message to Jian Wushuang to congratulate him on his Golden Crow Nine World fame.

Jian Wushuang also quickly replied.

…

Crimson Rock Castle, Pill Sun Sacred World.

Many Great Divine Masters of Crimson Rock Castle stood respectfully in front of a huge secret chamber.

At this moment, the door of the secret chamber slowly opened.

“Have you come out?” Yun Shan immediately looked up.

A beautiful figure slowly walked out of the secret chamber. As soon as this figure appeared, an aura that caused everyone present to be shocked and overwhelmed spread out.

This aura was the aura of an Immortal Saint!

And the person who emitted this aura was none other than the Fort Master of Crimson Rock Fort, Yin Su’er.

“Congratulations, Fort Master, for breaking through to the Immortal Saint realm!”

“Congratulations, Fort Master, for breaking through to the Immortal Saint realm!”

The voices were loud and clear, reverberating throughout the entire world.

One could see that these Great Divine Masters were all extremely excited.

This was also very normal. Ever since Crimson Rock Saint died hundreds of thousands of years ago, there had not been another Immortal Saint in the Pill Sun Sacred World. The reason why the Pill Sun Sacred World had been constantly in the civil war over the past few years was that their strength had been significantly weakened. It was because they lacked an absolute expert that could make all the forces submit to them.

And now, the Pill Sun Sacred World had once again listened to Crimson Rock Castle’s orders. At this juncture, Yin Su’er had broken through to become an Immortal Saint. It could be said that she was justified. In the future, the Pill Sun Sacred World would have an Immortal Saint personally presiding over it.

“Castle Lord!”

Yun Shan, Palace Master Si Zhen, and the others immediately rushed over to Yin Su’er.

After breaking through to become an Immortal Saint, Yin Su’er was obviously quite informed. “Uncle Yun Shan, during the time I was in seclusion, did anything happen in the Pill Sun Sacred World?”

“No.” Yun Shan shook his head. “During this period of time, the Pill Sun Sacred World has been peaceful, and the Heavenly Void World hasn’t made any movements. As for the Sword Alliance, because of Mr. Jian Yi’s restrictions, they have been quite quiet.”

“That’s good.” Yin Su’er nodded slowly.

“Oh right, Castle Lord. A few days ago, a major incident happened in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City.” Yun Shan suddenly spoke.

“What major incident?” Yin Su’er looked over.

“It’s like this…” Yun Shan immediately recounted the entire incident.

After hearing this, Yin Su’er was like a statue, completely stunned. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She was stunned for a long time before she slowly regained her senses.

“You mean Jian Yi, he faced the joint attack of three Immortal Saints, yet he managed to kill Realm Lord Tian Qu and Elder Su from the Star Point Pavilion, while he managed to escape unscathed?” Yin Su’er was clearly in disbelief.

“Yes, not only that, his current fame in the Golden Crow Nine Realms is shocking. There are even people who say that he is from the Golden Crow Nine Realms. But, other than the Supreme Lord Bone Emperor, the strongest person is also the most heaven-defying Divine Master in the history of the Golden Crow Nine Realms.” Yun Shan said.

“No wonder, no wonder he doesn’t care about the sacred elixirs at all…” A bitter smile appeared on Yin Su’er’s face. “I thought that after I broke through to the Immortal Saint realm, I could finally look down on him and talk to him as an equal. I didn’t expect that even though I broke through, the gap between him and me was still enormous.”

“Jian Yi, you are a monster!”

…

The Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, the Bone Emperor Realm, occupied nearly half of the territory.

This was a vast and desolate land. Yet, in the center of this land stood a towering castle.

This castle was incomparably huge, and its surface was surrounded by a large amount of green divine power.

Within the castle, corpses and bones were strewn all over the ground.

Many ghastly white bones, human skulls, and bones were scattered all over the ground. In the very center of the castle, there was an enormous high platform that was completely covered by skulls. On the high platform, there was a throne that was similarly made of white bones.

On the throne, a skinny older man with an incomparably short stature casually sat there.

This older man looked extremely weak, and when the wind blew, all the bones in his body seemed to fall apart. The aura on his body was also ordinary, and he was no different from an average person. However, it was precisely this weak older man… was the indisputable overlord of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

He was the Bone Emperor!

At this moment, in the void in front of the Bone Emperor, there was also a picture of a battle going on.

Looking at the scene in the picture, a wicked smile appeared on the Bone Emperor’s face.

Especially when Jian Wushuang killed Realm Lord Tian Qu with one sword strike, the Bone Emperor’s eyes slowly narrowed.

“In terms of power, this sword strike is not much weaker than mine. Of course, a mere Divine Master can have such battle strength, and he has an immortal body… Tsk, tsk, interesting, very interesting.” The Bone Emperor smiled sinisterly, but he was already interested in Jian Wushuang.

He was interested in Jian Wushuang.

“I have dominated the Nine Worlds of the Golden Crow for many years, but it has been a long time since I encountered such an interesting thing. This man named Jian Yi may not be as strong as me, but with his talent, he will break through to become an Immortal Saint in the future. Once he breaks through, his battle strength will only be stronger than mine. I want to meet such a person.”

“Go, find him, and invite him to my Bone Emperor realm. Tell him that I have something to discuss with him,” the Bone Emperor said.

There was not a single person in front of the Bone Emperor. His words seemed to be spoken to the air.

However, at the end of the castle, a figure had already set off.
