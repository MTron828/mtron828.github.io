Chapter 2627: Blood Gem

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“We can covertly investigate Yuan Lei’s death, but do keep it that way. Other than that, we can also keep an eye on the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. Although he doesn’t have the capabilities to kill Yuan Lei, he probably has something to do with his death after all,” said the Purple Supervisor.

“Aye.” The two Golden Chiefs behind immediately nodded.

They left very soon.

...

Northern Darkstar Territory.

Jian Wushuang exited through a wormhole with a flash.

“I’ve returned.”

He exhaled and began gliding towards his Territorial Lord Residence.

Jian Wushuang passed by the Official Army barracks along the way. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He suddenly paused as he glided above the barracks.

“How come there are only so few of them?”

Jian Wushuang frowned while overlooking the barracks below.

There were ten battalions in the Official Army with each battalion consisting of a thousand strong—there should have been a total of 10,000 men. However, as Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power expanded, he could sense there were only a thousand men in the barracks which constituted only one battalion. This was the Official Army barracks which would normally still have a large number of soldiers holding their positions in case something happens even when they received a big mission.

Furthermore, there should have been three or four battalions permanently in the barracks, but there was only a single battalion at that moment.

“Did something happen?” Jian Wushuang wondered before increasing his speed toward the Territorial Lord Residence.

Jian Wushuang had already descended in a manor and noticed that the residence did not change much.

Jian Wushuang called out, “Xin’er.”

“Master, you’re back?” Xiao Tiexin saw Jian Wushuang and smiled in surprise.

“I just returned and I realized there was only one battalion left when I passed by the Official Army barracks, What’s going on? Did something happen?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Xiao Tiexin nodded and said, “Something indeed happened. A Blood Gem mineral vein was discovered in the Star Fire Wilderness within our territory a year ago. Commander Cang Heng immediately brought two battalions over when he received the news, but who knew they’d find that someone has already taken over the mineral vein upon their arrival?”

“Taken over?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The Official Army had the strength to take over everything in Northern Darkstar Territory. Who had the nerves to rob them of the mineral vein?

“It’s our territory’s direct neighbor, Green Flame Star Territory. Moreover, Star Fire Wilderness is coincidentally located at the border between Northern Darkstar Territory and Green Flame Star Territory. Their Territorial Lord received the news faster than us and sent their Official Army ahead of us the very moment news about the Blood Gem mineral vein began spreading. The mineral vein had already been taken over by the Green Flame Star Territory’s Official Army by the time Commander Cang Heng arrived with his men.

Commander Cang Heng naturally was not ready to give up, so he argued with them and a fight consequently broke out. The two Official Armies were similar in battle strength, but the Green Flame Territorial Lord later took matters into his own hands. He’s the strongest Territorial Lord among those other territories around us—a Peak Earth Ultimate God. Commander Cang Heng of course fell into an absolute disadvantage with him joining the battle.

“Commander Cang Heng later mobilized nine battalions over out of necessity and we can finally fight against the Green Flame Territory as equals by relying on the numbers advantage. It seems that the Blood Gem mineral vein is currently being split fifty-fifty between Northern Darkstar Territory and Green Flame Star Territory with each mining their gems,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang looked grim.

He had heard of Blood Gem being a very high-leveled instrument cultivation material.

The Blood Gems were usually mined to cultivate Heavenly Treasures with only a very limited amount used for Peak Earthly Treasures cultivation.

In normal circumstances, only 10,000 pounds of Blood Gems was needed to cultivate a Heavenly Treasure. A complete Blood Gem mineral vein perhaps contained more than ten thousand pounds of Blood Gems.

Its value was naturally quite astonishing.

Jian Wushuang sneered, “The mineral vein is found within our territory, yet the Green Flame Territorial Lord has the nerves to lead his Official Army to our land and steal it. Hehe, how dare he look down upon the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.”

However, he knew that the Green Flame Territorial Lord was a Peak Earth Ultimate God and himself... Everyone knew about Jian Wushuang’s battle strength being at most only in the High-level Earth Ultimate God realm from killing San Shouwang before leaving Northern Darkstar Territory.

It was only normal that the Green Flame Star Territorial Lord did not take him seriously.

“Xin’er, you stay here while I make a trip to Star Fire Wilderness,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Master, be careful. The Green Flame Star Territorial Lord is a Peak Earth Ultimate God after all,” reminded Xiao Tiexin.

“Haha, I understand.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but had to disagree deep inside.

Why worry about a Peak Earth Ultimate God when he could even head-on kill a Heaven Ultimate God?

Star Fire Wilderness was just a regular wilderness located at the edge of Northern Darkstar Territory.

However, it was at that exact location an incredibly valuable Blood Gem mineral vein was discovered in the huge mountains. One that made the Green Flame Star Territorial Lord crossed boundaries to fight for.

The mountains were humongous and the entire mineral vein was similarly also incredibly huge.

The mineral vein began on both ends of the mountains which a camp had been respectively built. Several commanders from the Official Army were gathered together in one of the camps.

Cang Heng sat there and exclaimed, “It’s too huge. This Blood Gem mineral vein is truly too huge! The mineral vein that we managed to control is only 40% of the entire thing. According to early estimation, the Blood Gems extended underground that has been discovered is already more than a billion pounds and could even be a lot more!!

“Blood Gems are used for cultivating Heavenly Treasures. In the market, their value is also truly shocking. A pound of Blood Gems will cost ten Primordial Stones while a billion pounds of the Blood Gem will exceed 10 billion Primordial Stones!!”

“Wow!”

The commanders around him were in disbelief.

1,000,000 Primordial Stones were already considered an astronomical amount to those commanders who were only at Peak Ultimate God. What about 10,000,000,000? They could not even begin to fathom the concept of it.

“Our strength is unfortunately limited and forty percent is the most we’re able to keep in control. The remaining sixty percent falls under the Green Flame Star Territory Official Army’s control. Furthermore, the Green Flame Star Territorial Lord has already known the value of the mineral vein and will definitely mobilize even more personnel over from the Green Flame Star Territory. I’m afraid that we can’t even hold on to this 40% by then,” said Cang Heng coldly.
