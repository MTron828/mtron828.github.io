Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Squeak!

The cottage door was opened and the hunchback elder that Jian Wushuang had seen earlier walked in.

“Master,” the hunchbacked elder was polite.

“This is a servant of mine. I will let him follow you back to Lineage of Star. That’s the only thing I can do,” Purple Moon Emperor said.

“Thank you, Great Emperor,” Jian Wushuang thanked him immediately.

He knew that among Great Emperors of the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance, Purple Moon Emperor stood at his side.

However, Purple Moon Emperor’s power was only considered ordinary and there were many restrictions. Hence, he couldn’t protect Lineage of Star openly.

It was great enough that he could send the hunchbacked elder to help.

“Great Emperor, I have another matter that I would like your help with,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Tell me,” Purple Moon Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I’d like to ask you to send a message to Emperor Bai on my behalf,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Emperor Bai?” Purple Moon Emperor was surprised and he said, “Is it for inverse cultivation skill?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Purple Moon Emperor thought for a while and agreed, “Emperor Bai’s communication token, I don’t have it. But I can figure out a way to entrust someone else to send a message to Emperor Bai. However, Emperor Bai is untraceable. Even if we send him messages, it is normal that he might not reply for over a thousand or even tens of thousands of years. Hence, I can’t guarantee if he would reply.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and he anticipated.

Emperor Bai, an expert that was widely acknowledged in Sanctuary Alliance.

An inverse cultivator at Almighty level!

To Jian Wushuang, the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill in Emperor Bai was extremely important!

If he could get to the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill and breakthrough to become an Almighty, all danger could be taken care of and there would be no need for all those troubles.

“Go ahead,” Purple Moon Emperor waved his hands.

Jian Wushuang immediately left the cottage with the hunchbacked elder and walked out of the island.

In the void of the island, Jian Wushuang flew side by side with the hunchbacked elder.

“I wonder how do I address you?” Jian Wushuang looked at the hunchbacked elder.

“I am Qian Mingzi. I am merely a servant under the Master’s command. Sword Emperor could call me by my name or you can call me Elder Qian, the hunchbacked elder replied.

“Elder Qian, as Lineage of Star is in danger, if there were to be a war, I’d like to thank Elder Qian in advance,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sword Emperor, don’t worry. As Master commanded, I will definitely give my all. However, my power is limited. I believed it’d only be a meager contribution,” Qian Mingzi replied.

“As long as you did your best,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

But in actual fact, Jian Wushuang knew that Qian Mingzi was powerful. Jian Wushuang had a feeling that Qian Mingzi shouldn’t be any weaker than himself.

With such great fighting power, he was definitely helpful to Lineage of Star.

To be able to meet Purple Moon Emperor and receive assistance from Qian Mingzi, and Purple Moon Emperor promised to get in touch with Emperor Bai on his behalf. Jian Wushuang was already extremely surprised with that.

Then, he naturally returned to Lineage of Star with Qian Mingzi to prepare for war.

Then, in Eternal Chaotic World, there were rising winds and scudding clouds.

After the Master of Star Palace’s death was verified to be true, none of the forces could hold back anymore, especially those who harbored deep-seated resentment against Lineage of Star.

In the independent space that was engulfed in a huge formation, there were five thrones towering within.

On the five thrones, there were people seated. They represented the five top forces in Eternal Chaotic World.

“Everyone, as it has been discussed, Star Extermination Alliance has been formed today!”

“Star Extermination Alliance, specially to destroy Lineage of Star!”

The deep voices reverberated in the independent space.

After a few days of discussion, Star Extermination Alliance had been established.

Star Extermination Alliance was formed by five forces.

The five forces were Abysmal Palace, Soaring Heaven King Palace, Divine King Island, Real Martial Arts Divine Church and Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion!

They had reached a mutual goal.

“This is a chance that is hard to come by. No one should hide anymore,” Emperor God Tian Xiao from Soaring Heaven King Palace said.

“Don’t worry. In this fight, Divine King Island will go all out!” Divine King Island’s Number One Divine King said coldly.

“Same goes for Real Martial Arts Divine Church,” the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church said.

“We of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion will send thirteen out of fifteen of our Almighties!” The Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion said with a cold gaze.

Then, the four of them looked to the last person.

That person was Palace Master Wu Luo from Abysmal Palace.

“In this fight, Lineage of Star must be exterminated!” Palace Master Wu Luo’s voice was deep.

“Exterminate!”

“Exterminate!”

“Everyone, let’s get started. This time, we definitely won’t give Lineage of Star any chances!” Emperor God Tian Xiao said.

Very soon, all parties in Star Extermination Alliance had departed.

This time, the five top forces weren’t as high profile as back when Abysmal Palace had attacked Lineage of Star.

When the five top forces took action, the other forces in Eternal Chaotic World almost didn’t receive any news.

As they realized, the five forces had already arrived at Star Land.

In Star Land, there were wormholes connected to the surrounding land and sanctuaries.

The wormholes were gathered in three places, Cloud Island, Green Zone and Ice Mansion. The three places were controlled by Lineage of Star.

That day…

Swoosh!

A spaceship parked in Ice Mansion.

“This is Ice Mansion?”

A few figures stepped out from the spaceship and appeared in the void above Ice Mansion.

“What Palace Master meant is for us to wait until we conquer all space tunnels that connect Star Land to the outside world, then we wipe out the whole of Star Land. Lastly, we attack the lair of Lineage of Star!”

“This Ice Mansion is our first target!”

“Let’s begin!”

Immediately, a total of five Almighties took action personally and started a massacre.

In Ice Mansion, there were merely some Real Gods from Lineage of Star who was in commanding position. There wasn’t even one Almighty and they had no power to withstand. it

In a short while, the entire Ice Mansion, all experts from Lineage of Star were killed mercilessly and Ice Mansion was conquered by Star Extermination Alliance.

Almost simultaneously, a similar sight appeared in Cloud Island and Green Zone. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Star Extermination Alliance’s Almighties took action personally and the three transportation portals of Star Land were conquered by Star Extermination Alliance within half a day’s time.

Then, the experts in Star Extermination Alliance gathered and started a mad massacre on Star Land.

Whichever property under Lineage of Star and possessed a lot of resources were destroyed and attacked by Star Extermination Alliance.

A large number of cultivators in Lineage of Star were massacred by Star Extermination Alliance.

There were countless Real Gods and disciples that had died at the hands of Star Extermination Alliance.

In an instant, the entire Star Land had flipped upside down while Eternal Chaotic World was boiling because of that.
