Chapter 2807: One Mountain Can Not Accommodate Two Tigers

(The third time!)

——

After both sides reached an agreement, they returned to their respective homes.

In the grand hall of the Sword League, many high-level experts of the Sword League gathered together.

They had learned that the four top forces had submitted and made great concessions. They also knew about the agreement between Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er.

“Young master, you shouldn’t have promised Yin Su’er so much.” Xiao Tiexin stood beside Jian Wushuang, he frowned and said, “This time, the four top forces have indeed forced them to hand over a lot of sacred elixirs. The four top forces together have about 200,000 sacred elixirs. It looks like a huge amount of money, but in fact, 200,000 sacred elixirs are nothing compared to 70% of the territory property of the four top forces.”

“Because of you, the Sword Union has grown at an amazing speed. Each day is stronger than the last. If the Sword Union can accept enough territories and industries from the four top forces, we can become a colossus on the Pill Sun Continent. By then, we can compete with the Crimson Rock Castle and even replace it as the new...”

Before Xiao Tiexin could finish her words, she suddenly stopped.

This was because Xiao Tiexin had noticed Jian Wushuang’s cold expression.

She had been by Jian Wushuang’s side for a long time, so she could also sense his emotions. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang was a little angry.

Naturally, she did not dare to say anything more.

“Xiao, I can pretend that I didn’t hear what you just said, but don’t do it again,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin was shocked and immediately nodded obediently.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Xiao Tiexin and then looked at the experts of the Sword Union, frowning slightly.

He could see that most of the higher-ups of the Sword Union had the same idea as Xiao Tiexin.

They all thought that the Sword Union was very powerful now, and because of him, the most powerful expert of the realm, the Sword Union could take a step forward and replace Crimson Rock Castle as the new overlord.

In fact, it was true that people went higher and water flowed lower. Any cultivator who reached a certain level would naturally want to go one step further.

It was the same for a force. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, Jian Wushuang had a different idea from them.

To be exact, Jian Wushuang’s vision was much higher than theirs.

He did not care about the Pill Sun Sacred World at all. He did not even care about the Golden Crow Nine World.

The reason why he established the Sword League in the Sacred World of the Pill Sun was to help Yin Su’er resolve the situation in the Pill Sun Sacred World, and at the same time, make it easier for him to plunder cultivation resources.

But now, he had basically achieved his goal, and the role of the Sword League had been fully played in his eyes. He did not want the Sword League to advance further, so when Yin Su’er proposed the distribution... he agreed without even considering it.

However, he had high standards and did not take the Pill Sun Sacred World to heart. However, the experts under the Sword Union did not think so.

After all, the experts under the Sword Union would at most become great divine venerables in the future. To them, the Pill Sun Sacred World or the Golden Crow Nine Worlds was already an incomparably huge stage. They were limited to this. If there was a chance... they would naturally do their best to fight for it.

“Now that the four top forces in the Pill Sun Sacred World have submitted and handed over many resources and industries, there is no longer any need to worry. Next, the Pill Sun Sacred World will be ruled by the Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Union. Although the Sword Union and the Crimson Rock Castle have always been fighting together, it is only a cooperative relationship after all. There is no room for two tigers on the same mountain..

“Now that I’m here, neither the Sword Union nor the Crimson Rock Castle will dare to fall out with each other. However, if I leave the Pill Sun Sacred World in the future, it’s hard to say.”

“It seems that I have to think of a better way to solve this problem.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and muttered to himself.

After a long while, he raised his head again and looked down at the experts of the Sword Union.

“Listen up. I have made an agreement with Yin Su’er, the Lord of Crimson Rock Castle. The territories and industries vacated by the four top forces are all owned by Crimson Rock Castle. If anyone from the Sword Union dares to object or do anything, don’t blame me for turning hostile.” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice echoed throughout the hall.

Then, Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

After Jian Wushuang left, the high-level experts of the Sword Union looked at each other, not knowing what to do.

“Miss Xiao, what do you think...” Dong Xue looked at Xiao Tiexin.

“Since you have an order, we just need to follow it. Don’t ask about anything else,” Xiao Tiexin said coldly.

“Yes, yes!” The people of the Sword Union immediately nodded, not daring to have any objections.

Jian Wushuang’s position in the Sword Union was too high. Although he usually left many things to Xiao Tiexin and the others, he rarely paid attention to them.

But in the Sword Union, he still kept his word.

No one dared to disobey his words.

After all, Jian Wushuang was 99% the reason why the Sword Union had become what it was today!

The reason why the Sword Union could compete with Crimson Rock Castle was purely because of Jian Wushuang’s existence!

...

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

The four top forces also obediently gave up the promised sacred elixirs and the territorial properties. At the same time, the Great Divine Masters went to Crimson Rock Castle and listened to their orders.

According to the agreement, the sacred elixirs were also sent to Jian Wushuang.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with a qiankun loan in his hand. The Qiankun loan contained a large number of sacred elixirs.

Some of the sacred elixirs were sent by the four top forces, and some were the spoils of war that Jian Wushuang had won in the previous battle.

He had killed many experts in the previous battle. He had killed a total of three Peak Divine Masters, including Palace Master Nan Wu and the East God, who were in charge of the two major forces, especially Palace Master Nan Wu.

As the acknowledged number one expert in the Pill Sun Continent, Palace Master Nan Wu was extremely wealthy. Jian Wushuang had obtained 30,000 sacred elixirs and all kinds of precious treasures from him alone.

Jian Wushuang had not dealt with these treasures yet, but he had a lot of sacred elixirs.

“I consumed about 60,000 sacred elixirs when I broke through from an Advanced Divine Master to a Peak Divine Master. Now, I need more sacred elixirs to break through from a Peak Divine Master to an Elementary Divine Master. The sacred elixirs I have now are enough to improve my divine power, but I’m afraid I need more to break through,” Jian Wushuang thought.
