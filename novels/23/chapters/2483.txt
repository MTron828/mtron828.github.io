Chapter 2484: Destroyed (2)

“Star Thunderbolt Explode!”

Lei Chong’s eyes flashed with dangerous murderous intent as his two large hammers destroyed the world.

“Transmigration Sword Technique, Hateful Path Toward Heaven!” Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword swung around fiercely.

Boom!

The void was directly cut into half.

Hate! Hate! Hate!

His sword-light wantonly swept through the Heaven with unrelenting hatred, and wherever the sword intent went passed, it left a trail of Ascend Towards the Way of Heaven behind.

That was the move that severely wounded Fan Jianxian earlier.

The only difference was Jian Wushuang had superimposed that move with the Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment, increasing its power by multiple folds.

Two horrible blows of attacks collided.

Head on!

Bang!

The sword-light hit the large hammer’s surface and made a ringing sound, causing waves of invisible ripples to spread.

The black thunderbolts around Lei Chong instantly dimmed along with the surrounding Black Thunderbolt Prison which started falling apart.

His figure propelled like a cannonball, and finally slammed hard on the Golden Prison’s wall behind him.

His divine body trembled and caved in from the impact as he spat out blood.

“Senior Brother Lei Chong was defeated?” An Junzhu and Fan Jianxian were shocked.

Without warning, Jian Wushuang appeared next to An Junzhu.

An Junzhu was startled but not flustered. As her figure floated upward, dark air currents appeared in front of her and wrapped around Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang glanced at her coldly and he swept the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand around three times... Whaam! A huge sword net emerged and slashed the dark air currents into pieces.

Jian Wushuang took a step and sent out two apparitions at the same time to approach An Junzhu through the dark air currents.

Hum!

A vague sword-light swept out.

The sword-light was captivating like something that could only appear in a dreamland.

The moment it appeared, space-time seemed to be completely frozen.

Space-time Sword Technique, first form—Cutting Snow!

“No good!”

An Junzhu sensed danger.

She was the Queen of Darkness, a killer and expert in dealing with fatal blows at perfect timings. However, she was not good at fighting head-on. With Jian Wushuang being so close to her and his horrifying swordsmanship, she knew she could not escape.

At the juncture of life and death, An Junzhu tried her best to move aside.

Fortunately, she managed to avoid the deadly sword.

However, Jian Wushuang maneuvered the sword-light across with just a casual flick of his sword and cut through An Junzhu’s shoulder with the unique Samsara Strength.

Chug!

An Junzhu’s right arm flung out.

“Senior Sister!”

Not far away, a shocked Fan Jianxian immediately turned into a stream of light and attacked Jian Wushuang. The green long sword in his hand discharged a shocking power that completely covered Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang glared at Fan Jianxian before waving his sword in anger and freed himself. He did not use any skills. It was just a plain chopping motion but done with great strength.

Clang!

The sword intent around Fan Jianxian faded while his figure was also severely smashed against the Gold Prison’s wall. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the blink of an eye, three Supreme Elders and three Ultimate Gods of the Great Compassionate Sect were defeated!

They hardly had any room to struggle before they were destroyed.

“My hand!”

An Junzhu retreated a distance away. She was shrouded in the darkness again, stared at her right shoulder, and began using her divine power to regrow a new arm. However, she was surprised by the presence of a unique divine power around the wound. It was a unique power called Transformation of Transmigration Law which made her unable to regrow her arms.

Losing an arm had sharply decreased her combat powers.

Jian Wushuang acted and was targeting An Junzhu.

“Damn it.” An Junzhu wore an extremely ugly expression.

Just when Jian Wushuang decided to keep hunting An Junzhu, a black light appeared without the slightest sign next to him.

Jian Wushuang’s danger perceiving abilities allowed him to instantly notice the black light. It was a baby’s fist-sized black bead. Although the bead was not big in size, its destructive aura was strong and suffocating.

Jian Wushuang’s face sank and swerved to the side.

Nevertheless, before he could do anything, the black bead exploded!

Boom!

A terrifying power broke out from within.

The power was much stronger than a full-blown attack from Lei Chong. It could actually be as powerful as a blow from a High-Level Ultimate God.

Jian Wushuang was naturally hit by its mighty power since he was so near to the black bead, causing his body to be completely plunged into the violent force.

In the void not far away, Lei Chong rose to his feet again. He looked rather embarrassed with a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth, but his eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“I didn’t expect Jian Wushuang to be so powerful.”

He crushed me in a head-on battle. He’s much faster than Junior Sister An Junzhu. His sword skills seem to be a bit more advanced than Junior Brother Fan Jianxian. The most important thing is the secret techniques he possesses are terrifying, especially that domain which he is putting on display at this moment. I can’t properly utilize my strength under this domain’s limitation.”

In summary, even if his overall combat power is not comparable to an Ultimate God’s, it was infinitely close. This black bead is a life-saving weapon which I paid a huge price to refine. Its power may be equivalent to an Ultimate God’s attack, but it’s impossible to kill him with just one bead.”

Lei Chong’s face turned cold and immediately yelled out, “Junior Sister An Junzhu, Junior Brother Fan Jianxian, come here now!”

The single-armed An Junzhu and the severely wounded and pale Fan Jianxian rushed to Lei Chong’s side without hesitation. Lei Chong then flipped his hand and took out an identical black bead, but this time he did not aim at the void where Jian Wushuang was. Instead, he aimed it toward the Golden Prison’s wall.

The black bead instantly exploded when it hit the wall.

The terrifying power was concentrated at one tiny spot that even the stiff Golden Prison’s wall could not resist.

With a loud bang, a big hole was blasted on the Golden Prison’s wall.

“Go!”

Lei Chong screamed as he escaped from the Golden Prison with An Junzhu and Fan Jianxian.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang, who was at the Golden Prison’s center had also broken free from the Thunderbolt Bead’s explosion and he chased after the trio.
