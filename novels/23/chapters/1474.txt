Chapter 1475: Real God Huo Yuan

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Sigh, I should not have done anything to that royal disciple secretly for such a small benefit back then. Otherwise, I, Huo Yuan, would not have been locked up in this Sky Sword Prison. Moreover, this imprisonment is for eight million years,” Real God Huo Yuan sobbed as he lay down.

Back then, he was considered a well-respected overlord in a region of the Holy Kingdom.

However, due to a rash decision, he had been imprisoned in the Sky Sword Prison. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

For a total of eight million years!

Initially, Real God Huo Yuan had still had hope that he could accomplish the criterion of the Sky Sword Prison to kill a thousand Universe Gods and then leave the prison. However, he soon realized that meeting such criterion was merely a futile hope. Not to mention leaving after achieving the criterion, it was already very difficult for him to keep himself alive in the prison.

After all, to some of the Universe Gods who stood at the top in the Sky Sword Prison, it would be a lot easier to kill a Real God like him than to kill ten Universe Gods.

As such, it was natural that some Universe Gods had their eyes on him, such as the two demonic Universe Gods who were of the second level.

Under conditions where his Divine Power was restricted, he was not the two demonic Universe Gods’ opponent. Moreover, just keeping himself alive was difficult.

As such, he chose to be under the command of the Blood Emperor. Although he lived his life under poor circumstances for eight million years, at the very least, he would still be able to keep himself alive.

“I don’t even know when I, Huo Yuan, will be able to leave this shitty place!”

Real God Huo Yuan was swearing secretly.

However, at that moment…

Boom!

A wave of tyrannical Divine Power erupted abruptly and struck the swamp that he was in directly. In no time, the whole swamp was lifted up. Furthermore, the impressive Divine Power also spread mercilessly to the cave that he was in.

Whoosh! The cave that Real God Huo Yuan was in broke into pieces instantly and he plunged out immediately.

Real God Huo Yuan appeared at the higher end of the void. As he looked at the swamp that had been completely flattened, he became extremely furious.

“Jian Wushuang, is that you?” Real God Huo Yuan stared at the blood-robed youth who was standing in front of him.

“Real God Huo Yuan, I trust you have been well,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“How dare you! Even though you know that the Blood Emperor is looking everywhere to kill you, you still dare to come to the Darkness Mountain. Moreover, you also destroyed my cave. Do you really think that with the Fiery King as your supporter, no one in the Sky Sword Prison will do anything against you?” Real God Huo Yuan shouted angrily.

“Haha, the Fiery King is indeed giving me support. However, I have come to the Darkness Mountain alone this time around. Since the Blood Emperor wishes to kill me so much, by all means, bring it on,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Very good, I shall send a message to the Blood Emperor now.” Real God Huo Yuan took out a token immediately.

Jian Wushuang crossed his arms and stood at his position. He did not interfere and allowed Real God Huo Yuan to send the message.

After a short while.

“Have you finished sending your message?” JianWushuang’s laughter could be heard.

Real God Huo Yuan stored his token. However, his eyes had already squinted slightly, “This Jian Wushuang did not stop me even though he saw me sending a message to the Blood Emperor. Could it be that he isn’t scared due to his strong backing?”

“Real God Huo Yuan, since you have finished sending your message, isn’t it about time that you think about your own situation?” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

“Why? Could it be that you still wish to use us Real Gods as your whetstones, just like before?” Real God Huo Yuan’s voice sounded grave.

“Whetstone? No, my tough training is more or less over. Now I must think of a way to leave the Sky Sword Prison. You should know the criterion to leave as well. As I am a Universe God, I must either kill a hundred Universe Gods or ten Real Gods to leave. As for you, you are my first target,” Jian Wushuang grinned.

“Kill me? By yourself?” Real God Huo Yuan sneered, “What a joke. I am a Real God. In the Sky Sword Prison, apart from the four Kings, who could kill me?”

“Before this, when I first came to the Sky Sword Prison, I also met a person known as Universe God Long Xiu. He was more confident than you and claimed that in the whole Sky Sword Prison, apart from the Heartless King, no one could kill him. However, he died later on and he was killed by me,” Jian Wushuang said apathetically.

“You killed Universe God Long Xiu?” Real God Huo Yuan’s eyes narrowed.

Universe God Long Xiu’s name was famous in the Sky Sword Prison.

Although he was only a Universe God, his ability to keep himself alive was way greater than a Real God like himself (Real God Huo Yuan). However, he had died at the hands of Jian Wushuang?

“You shall join Universe God Long Xiu as well.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with murderous intent.

Buzz!

Majestic sword essence rose at once. When the foot of Jian Wushuang, who was standing quietly in the void, originally moved, nine shadows burst forth in a split second at the same time. The nine shadows pierced through the void easily and appeared in front of Real God Huo Yuan.

“This is Universe God Long Xiu’s secret skill of martial art movement?” Real God Huo Yuan was shocked. However, what followed after that was a roar, “Hmph, no matter what, you are merely a Universe God. Do you think that I will be afraid of you?”

Boom! Majestic Divine Power also burst forth from Real God Huo Yuan’s body. All the hair on his body turned scarlet. His eyes turned stringent and his body became bigger. It was as though he had become a real fire ape. Moreover, he was holding a completely red stone rod. The stone rod was three meters long and it was as thick as a person’s arm.

When Real God Huo Yuan swung the stone rod, he unleashed an earth-shaking power instantly.

“Go to hell!”

Real God Huo Yuan’s face distorted. Under the condition of his Divine Power being restricted, he had already unleashed all his power, unique skills and secret skills to their maximum.

All his power was converged into the stone rod alone.

As for Jian Wushuang, who was in front of him, with a flash of the nine shadows, figures appeared and wielded the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Crimson Light!”

Swish!

It was so fast that it was as if a crimson-colored lightning had appeared in mid-air.

It was so fast that it was ridiculous!

The crimson-colored sword light and the boundless void. In the places which the sword light passed, a great amount of blood-colored sword light was left behind and did not dissipate even after a long time.

In no time, the sword light collided head on with Real God Huo Yuan’s red stone rod.

Both Jian Wushuang and Real God Huo Yuan had unleashed the unique skills of Real Gods. Moreover, the Divine Power that both of them had released were about equal.

However, what was different was that the sword light that Jian Wushuang had executed contained the Power of Reincarnation. Moreover, it was different from three thousand years ago. At present, his comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine had already achieved the standards of the Doctrine Palace’s first level. Hence, when the Power of Reincarnation was used, its power was at least ten times stronger than before.

This was still in comparison to the past. As for Real God Huo Yuan, he had never possessed the slightest bit of the Power of Heaven Way.

This collision…

“Puff!”

Real God Huo Yuan coughed out a big mouthful of blood straight away. His blood covered his hair, causing his hair, which was already scarlet in color, to become even redder.

The aura on Real God Huo Yuan’s body also decreased by a huge amount immediately. He retreated in a pathetic state and it was only after quite a while that he managed to regain his posture.

“Die!”

As soon as Jian Wushuang’s body moved, nine shadows appeared. He did not give Real God Huo Yuan any time to catch his breath.
