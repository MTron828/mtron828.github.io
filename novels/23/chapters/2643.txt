Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Three Great Heaven Ultimate Gods... Fortunately, they are only Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods!”

Jian Wushuang’s face sank upon looking at the three Great Heaven Ultimate Gods in front of him but remained fearless.

He was just a Peak Ultimate God seven years ago, yet able to kill Yuan Lei—a powerful Heaven Ultimate God who was good at the Vitality Law.

His strength had improved by leaps and bounds compared to seven years ago.

He made a breakthrough from the Peak Ultimate God realm to the Primary-level Earth Ultimate God!

His understanding of Laws and Sword Principles had also improved a lot so did his divine power.

Three Great Heaven Ultimate Gods were not enough to frighten him.

Hum!

Jian Wushuang gave them a death stare as majestic golden divine power gathered behind him. A 5,000 feet high Golden God Shadow which exuded a world-shocking magnificent aura emerged in the blink of an eye!

Jian Wushuang also used the Divine God of Punishment when he fought Qing Ze five years ago. However, his Gold God Shadow was only 3,000 feet at that time. The additional 2,000 feet which increased his Golden God Shadow to 5,000 feet gave him an additional power boost.

The Seven Stars Strength in his body came pouring out.

The aura in his body also crazily shot up at a terrifying speed.

His initial Peak Earth Ultimate God’s divine power disguise under the black stone’s influence climbed rapidly and reached the very limits of Peak Earth Ultimate God in the blink of an eye. It had exceeded the Earth Ultimate God’s range!

Heaven Ultimate God!

Jian Wushuang’s divine power breath had been elevated to the Heaven Ultimate God level!

“This kid is weird!”

“How come? He must’ve performed some kind of secret technique that raised his cultivation realm.”

The three Great Heaven Ultimate Gods stood surprised side by side upon seeing Jian Wushuang’s divine power breath climbing up to the level of a Heaven Ultimate God.

“The three of us should take action together and whoever grabbed his Interspatial Ring first gets it,” suggested the three-yard-tall burly old man.

“Alright.”

“No problem.”

The other two nodded in agreement.

The three Great Heaven Ultimate Gods suddenly took a shot at the same time.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Three shots of terrifying divine power breath erupted from the trio.

The burly old man among the three who was originally only three yards tall soared to ten yards as his divine body rapidly grew while wielding a huge five to six yards long golden stone staff with the width of a huge bucket. The staff was continuously erupting majestic divine power while being held in the burly old man’s hands.

The second bald young man Heaven Ultimate God was was holding a purple sickle which seemed bewitching like his divine power breath.

The last Heaven Ultimate God was a handsome cold-looking man who had a sword mark on his brow and wielded a blood sword.

“Kill!”

The three Heaven Ultimate Gods concurrently attacked.

Three magnificent divine power breaths headed straight at Jian Wushuang. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“War!”

Jian Wushuang made a powerful cry of command and the nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords floating beside him instantly combined to form the perfect Transmigration Sword Formation.

A huge black divine sword pierced through the void and shot out.

“Haha, I’ll handle this sword formation.”

The bald young men laughed before slicing down the purple sickle in his hand like a purple moon colliding against the black divine sword coming through the void.

Clang!

The purple moon disappeared after the crisp sound.

The black divine sword shook slightly before being thrown backward but soon it stopped and continued moving forward.

“Interesting.”

There was a strange luster in the bald young man’s eyes as he went forth again to confront the Transmigration Sword Formation.

The handsome man with a sword mark on his eyebrows also took action at the same time.

Hum!

A large number of apparitions emerged at the same time.

The handsome man learned Space-time Law and seemed quite accomplished with the appearance of more than three hundred apparitions.

More than three hundred apparitions were densely packed together such that Jian Wushuang could not tell which was the handsome man’s real body.

A breath of cold aura shot passed.

“Right here.” Jian Wushuang immediately turned his head and discovered the handsome man had appeared beside him. The Blood Sword in his hand drove a bloody sword shadow that was coming down toward Jian Wushuang’s throat from a special angle in the void.

He aimed to cut off Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Humph.”

Jian Wushuang snorted and unsheathed his Blood Mountain Sword from its sheath.

Wow!

Jian Wushuang’s sword skill was much faster than the handsome man’s as a large number of sword shadows were sent out immediately like a sword river that completely drowned the handsome man after warding off his sword attack.

“Let’s see who has better sword skills.” A smile crept at the corner of the handsome man’s mouth. Endless blood-light completely turned the void around him into a sea of ​​blood in the next second. The handsome man’s appearance was similar to a Death God bathed in the sea of ​​blood.

A huge oppressive Profound Level Sword World suddenly shocked Jian Wushuang.

The handsome man then performed a strange cold and amazingly fast sword technique that manifested in the sea of ​​blood.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang seems fearless and displayed the full potential of his sword world. Although it was only at Merit level, his full-strength sword world performance had forced the handsome man’s sword world to recede while Jian Wushuang wielded his Blood Mountain Sword at the same time.

If the handsome man’s sword technique was strange and cold like a dark assassin, Jian Wushuang’s sword technique was swift and tyrannical like a domineering sword king.

The two were frantically firing attacks at each other—each with his advantages while unable to threaten either side.

Suddenly...

“Go away!”

Someone shouted fiercely before the burly old man who soared to a height of ten yards lifted his huge golden stone staff that was packed with terrifying power. The golden stone staff was like a huge golden sun as it fiercely slammed right down Jian Wushuang.

The handsome man was aware of it much earlier and managed to move aside. However, Jian Wushuang who was oppressed by the golden stone staff found himself immobilized.

Jian Wushuang scowled as his Blood Mountain Sword silently attacked—causing the world and space-time to seemingly completely overlap.

A weird and extremely powerful sword shadow imperceptibly fleeted past!

Space-time Sword Technique, Sixth Form—Overlapping Shadow!
