Chapter 528: The Harvest

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Sixth Level of Bone Fusion Technique, his incredible Physical Power and Spiritual Power were elevated. He had also obtained the eight Origin Marks supplement, so the power of this attack was enormous now.

This sword attack was as heavy as a mountain as it slashed towards the elder.

The elder’s hands were as red as the Raging Fire as he launched a punch and tried to stop Jian Wushuang’s attack.

However, when the two attacks collided head-on, the elder’s body smashed on to the ground like a meteorite.

Bang!

There was a pit in the ground several-foot deep.

“So powerful?”

The other nine monster spies stared at Jian Wushuang in terror.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of killing intent and a vast Blood River swept quickly through him.

The Blood River soon covered the Void. Hundreds of immaterial Sword Essence Waves were superimposed in the Blood River. Because Jian Wushuang had already comprehended the Thousandfold Realm, the power of the Sword Essence was extremely strong. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Thousandfold Realm’s power was much stronger than Hundredfold Realm’s.

The monster spies around him were trapped in the Blood River. As Jian Wushuang controlled the Realm to oppress them, the monster spies sensed a huge force that dramatically limited their movement.

Soon, Jian Wushuang’s power exploded.

Shua! Shua!

Two flashes of sword light erupted. Two monster spies in the Six-cloud Realm Level stared blankly as a tiny sword scar appeared on each of their throats, from which blood was pouring out slowly.

Once again, Jian Wushuang transformed and easily approached another three monster spies. They didn’t have a chance to react and were killed immediately.

“Run!”

“Run, run quickly!”

The rest of the monster spies were panicking and ran away without any hesitation.

However, as they were so close to Jian Wushuang and still trapped in his Realm, it was impossible for them to escape.

In only a couple minutes, Jian Wushuang killed the ten-person squad including the elder.

The squad of eight Six-cloud Realms and two Seven-cloud Realms did not stand a chance against Jian Wushuang.

“Based on my strength and the Realm, I can easily kill the experts in the Divine General Level.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Because of their strong physical power, Seven-cloud Realm Divine Generals in the Monster Continent were all close to the Eight-cloud Realm experts in the Divine Land.

Jian Wushuang had been in the Monster Continent for only a short time but had seen a huge improvement in his skills.

Now, he could easily kill Seven-cloud Realm Divine Generals and Demonic Beasts. In fact, based on his strength, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to kill Second-grade Divine Generals in the Eight-cloud Realm.

Not long after Jian Wushuang had killed all the spies, Qing Huo arrived at the scene with the 100-soldier squad and the Monster Discriminator.

“Brother Wushuang, how are you?” Qing Huo approached Jian Wushuang.

“I’m fine,” Jian Wushuang said as he shook his head. “Go check if they are monster spies.”

“Yes.” The Monster Discriminator quickly responded and then started to check.

Even though the elder and his team were dead, the Monster Discriminator would still be able to judge if they were Demonic Beasts.

Soon, he got the result.

“Captain, these ten people are all monster spies,” the Monster Discriminator reported.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang slightly smiled, but he was not surprised.

In contrast, the sergeants in the 100-soldier squad were shocked when they realized that these people were monster spies.

“So many monster spies, ten spies in total. The weakest one is the Six-cloud Realm and two are in the Divine General Level. So... so how many Monster Cores can be exchanged?” One sergeant cried.

A monster spy was more valuable than an ordinary Demonic Beast!

If ordinary Demonic Beasts were killed, only their Monster Cores could be taken away. However, it was a different story when it came to killing the monster spies.

It cost a lot to have monster spies. Monster spies had to be transformed to have the appearance of human beings and then sent to the Human Territory. Their value would far exceed that of ordinary Demonic Beasts.

Therefore, killing the monster spies would give more benefits than killing the ordinary Demonic Beasts.

At the same level, you could get a Rank Six Monster Core if you killed a Rank Six (Six-cloud Realm) Demonic Beast.

But if you killed a Rank Six monster spy, then you could exchange his body for a Rank Seven Monster Core in the East Camp.

Jian Wushuang had killed eight Rank Six monster spies and two Rank Seven monster spies, so he would be able to get eight Rank Seven Monster Cores and two Rank Eight Monster Cores from the East Camp. It was definitely a harvest for him.

“The Sky Solitude Mountains is a barren and vast landscape. Usually, we can’t meet any monster spies, not to mention a 10-monster spy squad. Brother Wushuang, I have to say you are so lucky,” Qing Huo said.

“Haha...” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help laughing. He waved his hands and said, “Tidy up these bodies. I will take them to the East Camp to exchange for the Monster Cores. I also need to talk to Fang Han. After that I will share them with you guys.”

“OK.” Wu Yuan nodded.

In the early morning on the following day, Jian Wushuang took the monster spies to the East Camp.

In the East Camp, Jian Wushuang first exchanged the monster spies for Monster Cores in the camp of the Seventh Army.

The sergeants there were shocked by Jian Wushuang’s haul.

Typically, it was very hard to catch one monster spy. However, Jian Wushuang had defeated ten. He really had good luck.

After obtaining the Monster Cores, Jian Wushuang went to Fang Han’s camp.

He needed an explanation from Fang Han! This was for himself and also for his 100-soldier squad.
