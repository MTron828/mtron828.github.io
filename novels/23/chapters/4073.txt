“The Thunder God Palace really values the first-class astral world. The array in the Purple Thunder Star World is much more powerful than the one in the Blood Thunder Cliff. I’m afraid that without the strength of an Ultimate Ruler, it’s impossible to break the array.”

Jian Wushuang looked down at the boundless land in front of him. This land was completely covered by the array. Through the array, he could see the densely packed buildings and a large number of cultivators.

This land was the foundation of the Thunder God Palace in the Purple Thunder Star World.

“Fortunately, this magic array is not difficult for me.”

Jian Wushuang smiled, but the Wuqi Divine Sword had already appeared in his hand.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang slashed down with his sword in anger.

Jian Wushuang instantly burst out his strongest power, along with the strength of his divine body. The swordsmanship he displayed was the most powerful heaven-opening move.

Boom!

The majestic sword light directly cut into the ancient magic formation. Instantly, the entire magic formation began to shake violently, as if a huge rock had fallen into the water.

In the magic formation, many of the cultivators under the command of the Thunder God Palace raised their heads.

“What’s going on?”

“Someone is attacking the magic formation!”

“This magic formation was personally set up by the Thunder God Palace. Without the strength of an Ultimate Ruler, it’s impossible to move it. But now, it’s shaking so much after just one attack, as if it can’t withstand it. Could it be that an Ultimate Ruler is attacking?”

The experts under the Thunder God Palace were all in an uproar.

Especially those who were at the peak of the Violet Thunder Star World.

“Quick, send a message to the palace. Tell them that an Ultimate Ruler is coming. Ask them to send reinforcements immediately!”

“Quick, ask the First Elder or the palace Ruler to come as soon as possible. Otherwise, it will be too late!”

The fifth-level Rulers from the Thunder God Palace had already gathered together in the array.

These fifth-level Rulers were all extremely powerful. There were even some who stood at the peak of the fifth-level. However, none of them could catch up to Emperor Rain Ruler.

At this moment, these fifth-level Rulers were all filled with panic.

The Thunder God Palace was one of the strongest forces in the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field. Almost no one dared to provoke them. Moreover, the Purple Thunder Star Field was one of the two first-level Star Fields under the Thunder God Palace. It could be said that the Thunder God Palace valued the resources the most.

It was precisely because the Thunder God Palace valued the purple thunder star area so much that almost no force or expert in the Nine Luminaries Great Star area dared to come to the Purple Thunder star area to cause trouble.

The Rulers who guarded the Purple Thunder star area had always been living an extremely comfortable life. However, who would have thought that someone would actually come to kill them today? Moreover, judging from the movements of the array formation, the person who came to kill them was most likely an Ultimate Ruler.

The fifth-level Rulers were naturally terrified.

Buzz, buzz, buzz!

The entire magic array was shaking crazily, and it was on the verge of collapsing.

However, in the end, the magic array still withstood Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“It didn’t collapse?” Jian Wushuang looked at the magic array in surprise, but then he smiled and slashed down with the Wuqi Divine Sword again.

If one sword was not enough, he would do it again. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Boom!

The sword light, which was also extremely powerful, mercilessly slashed at the magic formation again.

The magic formation, which had been on the verge of collapse because of the first sword light, could no longer withstand the same attack. It was mercilessly torn apart by the sword light on the spot.

The entire magic formation collapsed completely, turning into a vast amount of energy and dissipating in the void.

The cultivators of the Thunder God Palace who had been hiding under the formation were now completely exposed to Jian Wushuang.

The cultivators who were looking down at the Thunder God Palace were in a mess. Jian Wushuang did not draw his sword again. Instead, he waved his hand and three towering golden stone tablets rose up.

The three Heaven Suppression Tablets appeared at the same time and almost instantly covered the huge buildings below.

As the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation was activated, the boundless suppressive force instantly pressed down on the cultivators of Thunder God Palace.

The suppressive force was so strong that even a fifth-level Ruler would find it difficult to resist it. As for the fourth-level Rulers, the third-level Rulers, and even the weaker ones, under the suppressive force, they even lost their ability to resist.

Some people even knelt down on the spot.

“Haha, come in.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. There was a hidden independent space in the three Heaven Suppression Tablets. This independent space was actually a prison used to suppress people.

Now, Jian Wushuang directly attacked. Ancient Golden Palms extended out from the three Heaven Suppression Tablets. The speed of these golden palms was incredible, they dragged the cultivators of the Thunder God Palace into the independent space and suppressed them.

The cultivators of the Thunder God Palace could not resist the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation.

In just a moment, a large number of cultivators were suppressed by Jian Wushuang into the independent space in the Heaven Suppression Tablet.

The only ones who were not suppressed were the fifth-level Rulers.

“My divine power is only at the fifth-level. Even if I control the three Heaven Suppression Tablets and use the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation, I won’t be able to suppress the fifth-level Rulers directly. But it doesn’t matter. I just need to spend a little more effort,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, he had already rushed toward the crowd in front of him.

At this moment, more than a dozen fifth-level Rulers of the Thunder God Palace in the Purple Thunder Star World had gathered together, but their eyes were filled with fear.

It must be known that they had just watched as their subordinates had been suppressed by someone. None of them had been able to resist at all.

But now, everyone else had been suppressed, leaving only them behind.

“Eh?”

These fifth-level Rulers suddenly raised their heads. They all noticed a figure speeding toward them.

“Is that a third-level Ruler?”

“The one attacking us is not an Ultimate Ruler, but a third-level Ruler?”

“That’s impossible!”

The Rulers were stunned.

Jian Wushuang did not bother with them. As soon as he got close, he attacked.

Sword Shadows appeared in his hands. 5,000 years ago, he could easily kill an expert at the peak of the fifth level before he had reached the fourth level of the Supreme-level undying celestial body, although there were more than a dozen fifth-level Rulers here, only two or three of them had reached the peak. Although there were more of them, Jian Wushuang could still deal with them easily.

In just a short while, the dozen or so fifth-level Rulers were killed by Jian Wushuang until they were at their weakest. Then, they were suppressed by Jian Wushuang.
