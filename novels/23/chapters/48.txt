Chapter 49: Extermination

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

A severe explosive sound, like one would only hear during doomsday, burst and erupted from within the deep valley, around which a terrifying and horrible aura was simultaneously released. Afterwards, dozens of roars suddenly sounded from inside.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Severe crashes continuously burst out from the depths of the valley, seemly causing the heavens and earth to tremble.

No one knew what was happening there, including Jian Wushuang and others, who stood in astonishment outside the valley. All of them couldn’t help holding their breath through the dozens of earthshaking roars.

It was not long before the valley suddenly became tranquil.

Whoosh!

The middle-aged man with a powerful aura reappeared among them. After glancing at Mr. Huo, he said, “All fourteen masters of the Tianhuan sect, in the Gold Core Realm, are dead. You know what to do next.”

“Yes,” Mr. Huo nodded respectfully.

“Little guys, try your best.” The middle-aged man said as he smiled again at the group and then left in the direction of Qingdong City.

All the trainee’s lost focus as they stared at the middle-aged man. Only after he had completely disappeared did they begin to gradually regain control of their thoughts.

Suddenly, Mr. Huo announced, with a muffled voice, “Now I will tell you the task. Listen carefully!”

All the trainees in the area made sure to listen thoroughly.

“The core of the Tianhuan Sect, a second-rate sect in Tiannan Province, is located in the valley in front of you. There are fourteen masters, who are experts in the Gold Core Realm, and many disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm. However, the fourteen masters have already been killed by the Golden Dragon Ambassador,” said Mr. Huo.

Everyone was shocked into silence.

The fourteen experts in the Gold Core Realm? In such a short time? They were killed?

“Amazing!”

“All the expert in the Gold Core Realm were killed in such a short time?”

“So powerful, that is true strength!”

Everyone was so excited and they felt their blood begin to boil, even Jian Wushuang.

“Though the Masters are defeated, there are many disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm and the Spirit Path. The latter ones can be ignored, but you need to obtain the 10 Interspatial rings printed with the symbol of the Tianhuan Sect. They are worn by the disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm. To succeed, each one of you needs to seize one of those rings. Do you understand?” Mr. Huo asked while looking around.

All the trainees in the area understood.

“Only those who obtain one of the Interspatial Rings will be able to complete the mission, right?”

“This mission doesn’t seem so difficult,”

Someone in the area suddenly murmured.

“Only ten Interspatial Rings?” said Yin Min, frowning slightly.

“This mission is more dangerous than the previous ones.” Ling Tianhao couldn’t help scolding them.

“Absolutely dangerous.” Jian Wushuang wore a grim expression on his face as he spoke.

This mission… To start with, the numerous Warriors, in the Spiritual Sea Realm, in the Sect, would fight with all their power. But more importantly, there were only 10 Rings and over 30 trainees present. Yet, one ring could only be used by one trainee.

In other words, over two-thirds of the trainees were doomed to fail.

And… those who failed to obtain an Interspatial Ring, in order to complete the mission, would have to fight with the other trainees.

It could also be said that they should pay equal attention to both the Spiritual Sea Realm disciples in theTianhuan Sect as well as the other trainees from their side.

Mr. Huo said, “Now that you know the mission, it’s time to get started.”

“Let’s go!”

“Kill!”

The trainees that were already prepared immediately rushed towards the valley.

Jian Wushuang and his companions quickly rushed out as well.

Whoosh!

After leaping rapidly across the ground, three people quickly came into view of the great Sect gate in the middle of the valley.

The Tianhuan Sect fell into a panic and loud noises could be heard from every corner.

“Both of you stay close to me. If you move too far away, it’s quite possible that you will lose your lives,” said Yin Min, glancing at Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao.

“Okay,” said Jian Wushuang, with a nod.

“Understood.” Ling Tianhao also answered and nodded, with a grim expression.

“Hey, Yin Min, it’s rare for you to look so serious, right?” A voice was suddenly heard. Then, Dongfang Yu appeared with his five followers behind him.

Yin Min disdained him and said nothing.

Dongfang Yu didn’t lose his temper. Glancing at Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao, he laughed and then said, “Yin Min, look at your two companions. One is joining the One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard Mission for the third time and the other was defeated by me within less than three moves. You actually dared to team up with these two?”

“This has nothing to do with you. Piss off.” Yin Min directly scolded him.

Dongfang Yu’s expression became quite serious, but he quickly recovered. Ignoring Yin Min, he turned his eyes towards Jian Wushuang, laughing at him as he said “Hey, kid, watch out for your life during this dangerous mission. After all, trash like you can easily die inside the Tianhuan Sect.”

Then Dongfang Yu and his followers quickly rushed inside the Tianhuan Sect.

“What?” Jian Wushuang thought. He watched with a weird expression as Dongfang Yu left. “At the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace, I didn’t want to risk being noticed by people from Blood Feather Tower. Because of that, I pretended to lose. But I didn’t expect him to look down on me so much.”

Jian Wushuang touched his nose and shook his head with a smile. Then, he immediately raced towards the Tianhuan Sect together with Yin Min and Ling Tianhao.

The moment they stepped into the Tianhuan Sect, the warriors in the sect sensed their arrival.

“Damn, people from the Golden Dragon Palace came to exterminate my Tianhuan Sect. Keep dreaming!”

“I grew up in the Tianhuan Sect. My whole life is here. If you plan to destroy my Sect, you will have to step over my dead body first!”

“Kill them!”

“Kill them!”

“Kill all the invaders!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Stay with the Sect!”

Many loud roars could be heard in the Tianhuan Sect. They had cultivated many loyal Warriors. Though the fourteen experts of the Gold Core Realm were dead, the Warriors and disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm chose to stay with the Sect and fight for it, instead of escaping.

Therefore, numerous disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm, from the Tianhuan Sect, madly rushed towards the invaders.

A violent fight was about to erupt.
