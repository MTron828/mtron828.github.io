Chapter 2984: I Will Go There Personally

——

“Right now, this little guy is at the same level as Qian Chen when he’s at the Supreme God realm. He has the battle strength of a second-level True Saint, and he’s not weak among the second-level True Saints. He directly crossed three levels, and there’s also the great realm of the Supreme God realm and the Immortal Saint. With such a terrifying ability to cross levels, even the top monsters of the Primal Chaos Palace can’t compare to him,” the three-eyed man said in a deep voice.

The green-haired woman and the vicissitudes of life elder nodded slightly.

Indeed, the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces were full of geniuses and all kinds of monsters. For example, the Peak Geniuses of the Chaos Palace could only be described as terrifying. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

However, even the Peak Geniuses of the Chaos Palace could not cross three levels at once like Jian Wushuang, who could rival a second-level True Saint. No one in the Chaos Palace could do that.

“It’s precisely because he can’t do it that I have to wonder if he has really cultivated a special breath-holding technique and whether he has reached the realm of the Immortal Saint,” the three-eyed man said solemnly.

The green-haired woman and the vicissitudes of life elder looked at each other and smiled faintly.

What they saw now was only a mirror image sent by someone else, not Jian Wushuang. They had not really felt the aura from Jian Wushuang, so they could not be sure whether Jian Wushuang was a Divine Master or not.

“In fact, when this little guy completed the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment, the two disciples of the Heaven and Earth Palace who were present at the time had already sent an invitation to him, but he rejected it.”

“Although the talent he displayed at that time was extraordinary, at most, he could only join the Primitive Palace. According to the rules of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, since he had already been invited once unless the other party was really too dazzling, he wouldn’t invite him a second time. Therefore, we haven’t made any moves over the years, but now…”

“If this little guy had already broken through to the Immortal Saint realm, it would be fine. But if he really is just a Divine Master, then such a monster is rare in the entire history of the Beginning Divine Realm, not to mention in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. He is definitely qualified for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to send out a second or even a third invitation,” the three-eyed man said solemnly.

The green-haired woman and the weathered elder nodded in unison.

Indeed, if he really was just a Divine Master, then such a supreme monster was enough for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to spend a great price to rope him in and nurture him.

“How about this? Since no one can determine this little fellow’s true realm, then this old man will personally make a trip.” The weathered elder suddenly stood up.

“You will personally make a trip?” The three-eyed man and the green-haired woman looked over in astonishment.

“Hehe, this little fellow’s comprehension of the laws of space-time isn’t weak, and he is also skilled in the Dao of the sword. Unfortunately, the level of the absolute art he created is too weak. I can just give him some pointers. This way, if he really is a Super Genius, he will definitely feel grateful under this old man’s guidance. When that time comes, this old man will invite him again, and the chances of him agreeing to it will be much higher.” The old man laughed.

The three-eyed man and the green-haired woman nodded slightly.

“If that’s the case, then I’ll have to trouble you to make a trip,” the three-eyed man said.

“It’s no trouble. This old man hasn’t been to the endless territories for a long time. I’ll just take this trip as a way to relax.” The weathered elder smiled, and his figure flashed as he disappeared from the spot.

…

In one of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s nests.

The eight members of the Barbarian King Team were already handing over their tasks. After the handover, they got 220 million sacred elixirs as they wished.

“Haha, more than 200 million sacred elixirs. I’ve never seen so many sacred elixirs in my life,” the Immortal Saint named Ah Chao said in surprise.

“Shh, keep your voice down!” The Barbarian King shouted.

Ah Chao stuck out his tongue.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” The Barbarian King walked directly toward Jian Wushuang. “According to what I said before, of the 220 million sacred elixirs, 100 million are given to you directly after completing the second stage. As for the 20 million sacred elixirs in the first stage, it will be counted as 4 million sacred elixirs according to your previous contribution. What do you think?”

The Barbarian King was seeking Jian Wushuang’s opinion.

If Jian Wushuang asked for more sacred elixirs, he would agree directly.

“Forget about the 4 million sacred elixirs. I only want the 100 million,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“That’s good.” The Barbarian King naturally smiled.

Everyone immediately began to distribute. Jian Wushuang received 100 million sacred elixirs, and the remaining 120 million sacred elixirs were divided equally among the Barbarian King and the other seven people. In the end, each of them received a significant amount of sacred elixirs. Everyone was quite happy.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, this task has been completed, and next…” The Barbarian King looked at Jian Wushuang again.

“Next, I want to explore on my own,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Hearing this, the Barbarian King and the others looked at each other. Although they felt a little regretful, they could understand.

Jian Wushuang’s strength was obvious. He could easily complete a three-star earth-level task alone, so there was no need for him to stay with this team.

To put it bluntly, this team was nothing but a burden to Jian Wushuang.

“In that case, we’ll take our leave again,” the Barbarian King said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, let’s meet again in the future,” Xue Dong King said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and then separated from the Barbarian King Team.

When they separated, Jian Wushuang could still vaguely hear the Barbarian King Team members talking to Xue Dong King.

“Xue Dong King, it’s all thanks to you introducing such a powerful friend to our team. Otherwise, our team wouldn’t have been able to escape unscathed and get so much reward.”

“Yes, your good friend is really amazing.”

“It’s funny that we thought your friend was just a Divine Master and would become a burden to us. But now it seems that we are his burden.”

Hearing the voices behind him, Jian Wushuang could only smile helplessly.

And then…

“The earth-level three-star mission usually only faces some first rank True Saints. This mission is just special and the reward is so great that it is more difficult. But I can still complete it. In other words, with my strength, it shouldn’t be difficult to complete an ordinary earth-level three-star mission,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He had completed a special three-star earth-level task with the Barbarian King Team, so Jian Wushuang had a basic understanding of this level of task.

Next, he naturally had to take three three-star earth-level tasks alone. After completing three three-star earth-level tasks, he could become a heaven-level member, and his authority would be even greater.
