Chapter 2471: Engulfed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“There are many experts with extraordinary backgrounds and statuses in the Ancient God Realm after all. Their hands are tied due to their respectable identity as they had scruples doing certain matters. Therefore, being a member of Heaven Slashing Alliance allowed them to fight, loot, or even kill for their own benefit. The best part is that it will not have any impact on their existing statuses.”

This had led to many powerful Ultimate God or Undying Saints experts eager to join Heaven Slashing Alliance. Although the Heaven Slashing Alliance has always been hidden and has never gotten involved in any fights for hegemony, it still has an unmatched influence in Ancient God Realm. They’re indeed formidable,” said Crimson Stone Saint.

Jian Wushuang clicked his tongue when he slowly took in the information.

The alliance was indeed appealing to many experts as it allowed them to unscrupulously kill and loot without exposing their true identities. That alone would have been able to attract many experts.

“Crimson Stone Saint, since you have the Heaven Slashing Token and are powerful. Why didn’t you join the Heaven Slashing Alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’ve always wanted to join, but unfortunately wasn’t capable enough to do so.” The Crimson Stone Saint explained, “The Heaven Slashing Alliance only takes in elite and experts from every cultivation realm. I’ve gotten hold of this Heaven Slashing Token when I was just an Ultimate God. However, I had no confidence in passing the Heaven Slashing Alliance’s test. After I became an Undying Saint, I was even less certain about passing their test for Undying Saints. Due to that reason, I never went for the tests in the end.”

“I wonder if you go for it... You are simply incredible in manifesting powers exceeding your cultivation level. After you became a Peak Ultimate God, I’m sure the Heaven Slashing Alliance’s test is just peanuts for you.”

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment before slightly nodded. “Then, let me have this. What do you want in return?”

“It’s very simple. In the future, I hope you’ll find a way to help Su’er breakthrough to the Undying Saint Realm when you arrive at Crimson Stone Fort, apart from helping her to resolve her problems?” Crimson Stone Saint said solemnly.

“Breakthrough to the Undying Saint realm? Crimson Stone Saint, aren’t you thinking too highly of me?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

There was a huge gap between Ultimate Gods and Undying Saints. A breakthrough to the Undying Saint was like one giant leap.

Jian Wushuang was indeed talented and would be able to achieve the Undying Saint realm in the future, but he doubted his abilities to help others do the same.

Besides, even if Jian Wushuang was able to do it, a mere Heaven Slashing Token would not be sufficient for his efforts.

The Crimson Stone Saint smiled. “Don’t worry. My daughter is not weak. She was only one step away from achieving the Undying Saint Realm before I passed away and had a high chance of making a breakthrough. However, she had to shoulder the responsibility to handle Crimson Stone Fort all by herself with my passing. She was under too much pressure and never worked on her breakthrough thereafter. As long as you can resolve the crisis for her and allow her to relax, she should have no problem in making a breakthrough.”

“Furthermore, I’m not asking too much. I just hope you’ll try your best to help her breakthrough. Only when she reaches the level of an Undying Saint can I be relieved.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “Understood. Okay, I’ll promise you.”

Crimson Stone Saint smiled and tossed the blood-colored token over to Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang received it, he placed the blood-colored token in his hand and calmly examined it.

“Heaven Slashing Token? Heaven Slashing Alliance?” Jian Wushuang murmured. There was a sudden thought erupting in him.

‘Heaven Slashing Alliance was mysterious and powerful.’

His master Xuan Yi, the first Perfect Chaotic Creature in the world was also the inventor of the strongest secret sword technique—Heaven Slashing Technique!

‘Could there be any connections between them?’

“Perhaps, it’s just a coincidence.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and no longer further probed into the matter.

“Crimson Stone Saint, the agreement has been made between you and me. I want to stay in this Divine Power Ocean for a while to absorb more divine powers since I still have a lot of Purple Amulets at hand. There shouldn’t be any problems, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He noticed Crimson Stone Saint had expelled all the other genius disciples from Divine Power Ocean and other corners of Saint’s Tomb. He was the only one left. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Sure, it’s just some divine powers. You can absorb as much as possible, but you can’t stay for too long. After all, Saint’s Tomb is only open for at most a year each time. Some time has passed, so you are left with only a few months,” said Crimson Stone Saint.

“A few months? No, I won’t take that long.” Jian Wushuang smiled before sitting down cross-legged again in the Divine Power Ocean.

The Crimson Stone Saint remained standing on the surface of the Divine Power Ocean and watched calmly.

He did not mind Jian Wushuang absorbing more divine powers.

Although Jian Wushuang was absorbing divine powers much faster than any average cultivator by dozens or even hundreds of times, he was not bothered at all.

‘The Divine Power Ocean which I’ve created is vast and has magnificent divine powers. How much divine power could Jian Wushuang absorb in a few months’ time?’

That was what Crimson Stone Saint thought.

However, at the very next moment...

Rumbling... The Divine Power Ocean became choppy.

A terrifying suction power swept out from Jian Wushuang.

The power was much stronger than which Jian Wushuang manifested when he was still at Peak Chaotic Realm.

It was at least hundreds or even thousands of times stronger!

Earlier, Jian Wushuang stirred up a rapid movement around him when he was absorbing the divine powers in the ocean with all his might. Imagine that suction power had increased by thousands of times!

That scene was astonishing.

The Divine Power Ocean had pretty much gone crazy.

Limitless Ancient God Realm divine powers came from all corners of the Divine Power Ocean towards Jian Wushuang. It was instantly absorbed and refined by Jian Wushuang.

It was mind-blowing to see the huge and endless Divine Power Ocean’s sea level began dropping at a visible speed.

It seemed like the entire ocean was channeling its power into Jian Wushuang.

“How is this possible?” Crimson Stone Saint’s eyes widened and he was completely stunned.

If he was not bothered earlier previously, he was about to go crazy now with the event occurring before his eyes.

There was nothing he could do about it while Jian Wushuang absorbed divine powers at an incredible speed.

Not only was he absorbing the power fast, but was also much faster in refining that power. The huge gush of divine power that continuously went into his body was refined and almost immediately transformed into his own divine powers.

This was implausible.

“My... My Divine Power Ocean...”

Crimson Stone Saint had his eyes locked on the declining sea-level around him in astonishment, but he could not do anything about it.

He did not have the courage to stop Jian Wushuang, so he could only watch the divine power in the Divine Power Ocean disappear.
