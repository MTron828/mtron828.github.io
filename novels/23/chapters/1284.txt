“Jian Wushuang.”

Jian Wushuang answered.

Even if the two were much more powerful than him, Jian Wushuang was still neither humble nor arrogant.

“You are just a Universe Master. It’s impressive to see you have a treasure like the Golden Drift Sand Cucurbit.” The Master of Dayu Palace smiled, he was in good spirits.

At that time, the god in white said, “Your Highness, although Jian Wushuang is just a Universe Master,?he is super famous in Dayu world. He has killed an advanced Universe God of the First Heaven.”

“Really?” The Master of Dayu Palace was stunned.

“A Universe Master could kill an advanced Universe God of the First Heaven?” Wu Cang was also surprised as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, I never thought that Dayu World could have so many talents. There was a Qing Yang Universe God before, but now there is someone even stronger than him.” The Master of Dayu Palace laughed, then he looked at Wu Cang and asked, “Wu Cang, How many people in your Snow Dojo can rival this kid?”

“The Universe God is much more powerful than the Universe Master. It will be extremely hard to challenge the Universe God to a battle in order to move up the ranks, not to mention kill the weakest Universe God. In my Snow Dojo, there are countless geniuses. Among them, only three could kill an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven!” Wu Cang was serious; his expression was subtle.

“Only three? Then this kiddy could be the best of Snow Kingdom.” The Master of Dayu Palace laughed again.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He had killed the advanced Universe God in the First Heaven. To other people, this was a miracle. However, there were still three geniuses like him in the Snow Dojo. How could it be?

What exactly was the Snow Dojo?

“Jian Wushuang, you should not look down upon the talents in the Eternal Chaotic World. You are new here. In Dayu World, you are seen as someone gifted. However, it will be another situation when you go to other places. The Ten Cultivation Sanctuary is another situation entirely. Do you understand?” The voice of Gu King arose.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang agreed.

“Jian Wushuang.” The Master of Dayu Palace said, “This Golden Drift Sand Cucurbit is truly useful to me. If you are willing to lend this to me for a short period, then I will owe you one.”

“As long as it’s within my power, you are allowed to ask me for any favor. Furthermore, this favor can’t affect the balance of the Dayu World. For instance, you are not allowed to ask me to destroy one of the overlords of the Dayu World, such as Golden-sun Sect or Holy Prefecture. That would be impossible.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Apart from this, you can ask anything you want.”

The Master of Dayu Palace stood there with hands clasped behind his back cheerfully.

Jian Wushuang was thinking.

The god in white smiled. “Jian Wushuang, as far as I know,?the Holy Prefecture and the Golden-sun Sect both want you to die. You are in a bad situation. I’m afraid only Scarlet Island will be able to keep you safe. So why don’t you ask his Highness to help you solve this problem?”

“What’s the problem between you, the Holy Prefecture, and the Golden-sun Sect?” The Master of Dayu Palace also smiled, “Perhaps I can solve it for you. I promise that they won’t come after you.”

“Jian Wushuang.” The Master of Scarlet Island urged. He also thought that Jian Wushuang would ask the Master of Dayu Palace to end this.

Jian Wushuang shook his head slowly. “I will personally end this personal dispute between myself, the Holy Prefecture, and Golden-sun Sect. Your Highness shouldn’t be bothered by it.”

“Really?” The Master of Dayu Palace raised his eyebrows.

The Master of Scarlet Island and the god in white were both surprised.

Jian Wushuang signed. “During the road to the Dayu Palace, the Master of Scarlet Island mentioned that every once in a while your Highness will give lessons in the Dayu Palace. Those lessons are about cultivation, secret knowledge, and the Dao.”

“Unfortunately, every time you give lessons,?only the top geniuses in the Dayu Palace are qualified to attend. Moreover, everyone just has one chance to learn.”

“This time, I had the opportunity. I will use this chance to take one of your lessons.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were sparkling. He clenched his fists.

Before he had arrived, he had already thought about how he would use this chance.

If he used this to ask the Master of Dayu Palace to help him solve the dispute between himself, the Holy Prefecture, and the Golden-sun Sect, it would be a waste.

He needed to be the one to end this thing. He had caused it.

Jian Wushuang wanted the opportunity to learn more than he wanted the situation to be resolved.

For him, the lesson given by the Master of Dayu Palace was an incomparable exchange!

Especially if it were the one which could teach him how to pass the God Test!

According to what Gu King said, the Master of Dayu Palace was a Universe God in the Third Heaven. He had passed the God Test. Furthermore, he understood what the God Disaster essence was better than any other expert.

Now, the hardest difficulty for Jian Wushuang was not the threat from the Holy Prefecture and Golden-sun Sect but his own Inverse Cultivation Disaster!

The Inverse Cultivation Disaster was fatal.

“You want to listen to my lessons?” The Master of Dayu Palace must have thought Jian Wushuang was weird, “Are you sure?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

Hearing this, the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang glanced at each other. With that, the Master of Dayu Palace laughed. “In that case, I will meet your demand. In 80 years, I will give a lesson. You can attend then.”

“In addition, before I return the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, you can stay at the Dayu Palace. In my palace, there are numerous treasures and manuals. You are my Guest now, which means you can use any of them as you wish. Besides, you can exchange opinions with the geniuses and experts in my Dayu Palace if you have the leisure time.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised by all this!
