Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After a simple greeting between Demon Master Chenhuo and the people of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, the two sides went back to the main topic.

“valley Master Longyu, as well as the people of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, I, Heavenly Sword Marquis, can swear that I have no hostility toward the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley from the beginning to the end. As for the reason why I suppressed the experts and disciples of the

Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley this time, it was because I had no choice. I hope you can forgive me.” Jian Wushuang lowered his attitude.

“Do you really have to do this? Not only did you suppress the ordinary disciples, but you also suppressed two Principles Masters. Do you really have to do this?” Valley Master Longyu shouted coldly.

“I suppressed them because I wanted to lure you out. In fact, when I visited Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley not long ago, if you hadn’t rejected me, this wouldn’t have happened,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Humph, Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley has some private matters to deal with. I said that I would visit you in the Temporal Temple, but you forced me to meet you by suppressing the disciples of the experts of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. How can you visit people like this?” Valley Master

Longyu said.

“valley Master Longyu, I’m afraid only you know the reason why your Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley rejected me. But now that things have come to this, it’s useless to pursue this matter. Let’s get down to business.” Jian Wushuang looked at Valley Master Longyu. “Compared to Valley Master Longyu

and the other masters of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, you should already know why I’m here.”

The Principles Masters of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley looked at each other in dismay. Naturally, they understood, but they did not show any change in their expressions.

“How would I know why you’re here?” Valley Master Longyu asked.

“Then let me be clear. More than 1,000 years ago, in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion of the Golden Crow Nine Realms in the endless territories, the people of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley took my wife away in front of me. Among the people who took my wife was the consciousness clone of Master

Zhu Xin. Now, I’m here to visit Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley to take my wife away!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Your wife?” Valley Master Longyu and the Principles Masters frowned.

Wife?

Their young master and Heavenly Sword Marquis were husband and wife?

“No.” Valley Master Longyu immediately shook her head. “Young master is the most suitable person to cultivate the divine skill that our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley has spent so many years and energy to find. She shouldn’t have any secular aura at all. How could she have a husband?”

Thinking of this, Valley Master Longyu immediately believed that Jian Wushuang was lying.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, do you think that people from our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley are so stupid that they will be easily deceived by you?” Valley Master Longyu said angrily, “The rule of our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley has always been that we only accept virgins as disciples. Anyone

who enters our valley must be heartless and unfeeling, Therefore, before she comes to the valley, we will make sure that her love threads are completely cut off!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“You said that the person that Master Zhu Xin took away was your wife, but since she was your wife, how could she be qualified to enter our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley?”

“It’s true that the person that Master Zhu Xin took away was my wife, but her memory has not been completely restored. As long as you let me see her, I will naturally have a way to restore her memory,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Whether she’s your disciple or not, it’s meaningless now,” Valley Master Longyu said.

“Meaningless?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Yes, as long as she enters my great forget love valley, she will naturally sever all love. My Supreme Emotion- forgetting Valley will naturally not allow her to meet you. Moreover, even if my Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley allows it, you won’t be able to see her,” Valley Master Longyu said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“I’s simple. The person you mentioned is dead!” Valley Master Longyu said.

“What did you say?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed drastically, and a fierce light flashed in his eyes.

“Yes, she is dead. Not long after she came to our valley, she died during an experiential training,” Valley Master Longyu said seriously.

When the Principles Masters of the Supreme Emotion forgetting Valley heard Valley Master Longyu’s words, they were all stunned and could not help but sigh in their hearts.

They all knew that the person Jian Wushuang was talking about was their young master. The young master was still alive and well. However, in order to make Jian Wushuang completely give up, Valley Master Longyu directly said that their young master…was dead.

At this moment, when Jian Wushuang heard the news, he was a little stunned and did not react in time. What followed was endless killing intent and unprecedented fear, but he quickly calmed down.

He raised his head and looked carefully at Valley Master Longyu and the Principles Masters beside her. Although these Principles Masters were trying their best to hide it, Jian Wushuang still saw some clues.

“valley Master Longyu is fine, but some of the other Principles Masters have strange expressions. It seems that they were also shocked by the look in their eyes!” Jian Wushuang observed carefully.

“More than 400 years ago, when I met Han Xin in the Blood Ware Realm and asked about Shuang ‘er for the first time, Han Xin’s expression was obviously different. I’m sure that Shuang ‘er was alive and well at that time, and her position in Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley was extraordinary. But now,

when valley master jade said that Shuang ‘er was dead, it was as if she was talking about the death of an insignificant ordinary disciple!”

“Based on these two points, I am sure that Valley Master Longyu is lying!”

Jian Wushuang immediately understood and his eyes turned cold. “Valley Master Longyu, I am sure that she is still alive. Just tell me what conditions you want me to take her away.”

“Conditions? What conditions can you offer?” Valley Master Longyu glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“No matter what kind of harsh conditions you offer, as long as you bring them up, I can try to fulfill them. Even if you want me to destroy a top sect in the Third Heaven for you, or even destroy a Saint Realm and kill a Master of the Saint Realm, I can try!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes were

full of longing and expectation.

He and his wife had been separated for too long.

He could not wait to see his wife. He was too eager.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, both Valley Master Longyu and the Principles Masters of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley were stunned.
