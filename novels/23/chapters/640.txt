Chapter 641: Feng and Qianqiu Wuhen!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The list of names for the third round of the arena duels instantly caused a commotion on the Drill Ground.

Some geniuses gave sympathetic glances at Jian Wushuang and Feng, while others were gloating about it.

“We’ve had a bit of bad luck.” Jian Wushuang and Feng looked at each other and then sighed with complicated expressions.

Most of the geniuses had already used their full their strength in the Firmament Territory Feast by this point. Qianqiu Wuhen and Gong Chao were considered the most powerful.

Both of them were far superior to the other geniuses. If they had attended the previous Firmament Territory Feasts, either of them would have ranked number one.

When drawing lots just now, everyone had been praying that they would not encounter those two geniuses. And the results were...

Gong Chao versus Jian Wushuang!

Qianqiu Wuhen versus Feng! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang and Feng would have to fight against the two strongest geniuses.

They were the last survivors among the thousands of warriors from the Ancient World in this feast, but they would have to deal with the most powerful opponents in the third round of the arena duels.

It was not their day... If they had not drawn the lots themselves, they would have suspected that the middle-aged man had intended to set them up.

The experts in the Skyward Pavilion were in a heated discussion.

“Haha, bad luck for the two boys from the Ancient World. They already had the chance to hit the top 10 and win the prizes, but now they have to fight Gong Chao and Qianqiu Wuhen!”

“The two strongest geniuses from the Ancient World versus the most powerful ones from the Eternal World. How interesting.”

“The two boys look good, especially Jian Wushuang—he’s able to hit the top five. It’s a pity that he has to deal with Gong Chao, who seems to be as strong as Qianqiu Wuhen but has been hiding his strength. That is to say, Gong Chao is actually stronger than Qianqiu Wuhen, so Jian Wushuang will have no opportunity to win this time.”

“What a pity!”

All the experts sighed because Jian Wushuang and Feng would lose their fights.

The two boys were powerful indeed, but they were far inferior to Qianqiu Wuhen and Gong Chao in the experts’ eyes.

Even Xuan Yi held the same view.

“Qianqiu Wuhen and Gong Chao are talented. Although Feng has hidden some of his strength, he’s still weaker than the two geniuses.

“As for Jian Wushuang,”?Xuan Yi thought while shooting the young boy a meaningful glance?, “he has hidden many skills. If he fought against Qianqiu Wuhen, he would still have a glimmer of hope to win the fight, but he’s encountered Gong Chao.”

Xuan Yi shook his head. He had recognized Gong Chao’s real strength just as the other experts had.

Gong Chao was much more powerful than Qianqiu Wuhen.

“It’s impossible to defeat Gong Chao. Now we’ll see how far the boy can go,”?Xuan Yi thought with an indifferent expression on his face.

On the battlefield, the first fight had already started.

Zhong Huo was fighting Qiu Yue.

Because these geniuses had entered the top 20, the disparity between their strength was very slight.

Zhong Huo and Qiu Yue were evenly matched, so their fierce fight lasted a long time.

The other geniuses were waiting for their turn by the Drill Ground.

15 minutes passed. Qiu Yue finally won this fight with a little advantage.

“The second duel, Li Xiaoyue versus Huan Chong!”

The fierce fights continued. Not long after, it was time for Feng to fight against Qianqiu Wuhen.

“Good luck, Feng,” said Jian Wushuang, shooting a quick glance at him.

“OK.” Feng nodded, then slowly stepped forward.

Many geniuses on the Drill Ground and experts in the Skyward Pavilion fixed their eyes on this fight.

Naturally, Qianqiu Wuhen was in the spotlight.

The moment the middle-aged man gave the order, the two duelers instantly grappled with each other.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

As a deafening roar reverberated through the area, Feng did not hold back and his strength erupted.

The brilliant streaks of saber shadows swept out, which attracted everyone’s attention.

His Saber Technique was extremely mighty, as if it were able to destroy the entire world.

“What a terrifying Saber Technique!”

“He’s too strong!”

“He has a high comprehension of the Destruction Dao. He’s amazing!”

His strength shocked everyone.

They finally realized that Feng had been hiding his strength.

“Top 5... He has top 5 battle strength!”

“He is not weaker than Jian Wushuang!”

“Two geniuses from the Ancient World have top 5 battle strength?”

All the experts were quite shocked.

Feng’s strength was beyond their expectations, but he was still unable to match Qianqiu Wuhen.

At this point, Qianqiu Wuhen gave a casual slap, which moved toward his opponent like a huge fire mountain. He continued his attacks, unleashing more overwhelming “fire mountains”.

Feng tried his best to resist, splitting the “fire mountains” in half or repelling them, but the fire mountains surged at him without pause. Feng felt that it was becoming more and more strenuous for him to sustain, while Qianqiu Wuhen was still attacking with a calm expression.

“Go to hell!”

Qianqiu Wuhen finally found a chance to show his trump cards. Instantly, the entire surrounding area fell into an endless sea of fire with the arrival of several of his palms. Feng wielded his saber to parry them, but he only deflected three of them while two palms landed on his body.

Qianqiu Wuhen won!
