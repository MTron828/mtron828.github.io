Chapter 5402 ¬†Ultimate Supreme Technique

The dome of the great hall trembled, and a moment later, a transparent crystal ball descended from above, landing in front of Gong Miaoyi. On the crystal ball, the reflection of Gong Miaoyi's face was visible.

Jian Wushuang and Bai Junwang retreated to the corner of the hall, silently observing every move of Gong Miaoyi.

"The owner of this inheritance is not a tier 5 Emperor; it's likely someone who intruded and placed this inheritance in the cave," Bai Junwang, with his extensive knowledge, immediately recognized the uniqueness of the inheritance‚Äîa treasure not easily obtainable even by a tier 5 Emperor.

Though not as knowledgeable as Bai Junwang, Jian Wushuang, too, could sense the scattered aura within the inheritance. It felt familiar, akin to the aura within Gong Miaoyi.

All connected to the Ultimate Dao.

Previously, he had wondered, in the ancient era, although the ultimate path was rare, there should have been quite a few. With this ultimate inheritance, mastering the Dao shouldn't have been too difficult. Even if the probability was just one in ten, there should have been many Ultimate Emperors.

These Emperors' Ultimate techniques should have been passed down.

But now!

Not to mention the recently born universes like the original universe, even within the Qishen Temple, there should have been a collection of many Ultimate Techniques.

Yet, in this aspect, he hadn't heard a single mention.

Now, seeing this inheritance, it was his first encounter with an Ultimate Technique.

Bai Junwang noticed the exceptional nature of the inheritance but didn't see the connection to the Ultimate Dao.

"This inheritance should be created by the owner of this cave!" Jian Wushuang shook his head, rejecting Bai Junwang's view.

Bai Junwang was momentarily stunned. While he held Jian Wushuang in high regard, especially regarding the Origin Source, he couldn't agree on the matter of vision and insight. He questioned, "How can you be so sure?"

"The owner of this cave is indeed a tier 5 Emperor, but they are likely a tier 5 Ultimate Emperor!" Jian Wushuang's eyes flashed. Ultimate Emperor!

He had seen it before, not just once. Back in the Chishui Hall, he had sensed many auras similar to his own. Later, on the Original Planet in the Original Realm.

Whether it was Hu Qing or Ji Chaoyang, he had witnessed each other's actions, and that aura was all too familiar to him.

Although there was a great gap between Dao Emperors and Emperors, the aura wouldn't change.

The pursuit of the Ultimate Origin Source, the Ultimate Dao, was far different from ordinary Origin Sources.

Bai Junwang, upon hearing the term 'Ultimate', exclaimed, "Ultimate Emperor? Are you sure?"

Having lived for so long, he had only had close contact with Jian Wushuang, an Emperor who pursued the Ultimate Dao, and had experienced a lot through their close connection.

However, it was not his Origin Source, and he knew too little about its core.

Jian Wushuang just nodded without saying more, fully focused on watching Gong Miaoyi accept the inheritance.

Ultimate Technique!

If the Four Great Secret Realms possessed such inheritance, it would have been plundered by the Four Great Temples long ago. How could there still be leftovers? Keeping the ultimate mastery in the Four Great Secret Realms would be a waste.

Gong Miaoyi seemed to have many secrets, and when they got out, he would have to explore them thoroughly.

A native Emperor in one of the Four Great Secret Realms with mediocre strength, he couldn't see anything extraordinary about her. Just an ordinary peak-level tier 3, he could easily kill her with a casual move.

But Gong Miaoyi's body contained the Ultimate, and she could also accept the inheritance of the Ultimate Technique, which was quite incredible.

The robe on Gong Miaoyi's body fluttered as she sat quietly, accepting the inheritance.

This inheritance was left to her by her mother, and that jade slip recorded her origin and her father's secrets. She couldn't die like this; she had to accept the inheritance and continue the path her mother couldn't finish.

She was going to tread an impossible path.

Her mother had descended from the heavenly realm, pregnant with her, severely injured, and had lost her foundation; otherwise, she wouldn't have fallen like this.

All of this was because of her!

At this moment, how could she dare to betray her mother's teachings?

Cultivating the supreme technique, returning to the heavenly realm to avenge the blood feud, and finding her father.

This is the lifelong wish she vowed to accomplish as long as she stayed alive.

Streams of light converged into a single point, gathering at her chest, and a faint purple armor appeared beneath her black robe.

The inheritance reached a critical moment.

Her Origin Source continued to ascend, and the originally damaged Origin Source began to repair itself at this moment.

Divine power began to transform, condensing from simple strength into a unique force.

It was the power of the Sun God.

A true ancestor of the Beast God, a Beast God one level higher than the Candle Dragon!

The Golden Beast God, also known as the Sun God.

It is the source of space.

The Candle Dragon also contains the power of the Golden Space, but it is born from within the Golden Space, one level lower than the Sun God.

Jian Wushuang watched nearby with envy.

This kind of ultimate technique is too incredible; it truly deserves to be the Ultimate Technique.

He couldn't help but exclaim. The Ultimate Emperor from before must have been an extraordinary genius, otherwise, he wouldn't have created such a supreme technique.

The power containing the Sun God's force implies that space has reached its peak.

But why is that Emperor only at the tier 5?

Jian Wushuang frowned. In the future, when he goes to the Grave God Mountain, he must seize the opportunity to ask the Zhen Ling face to face. FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

Such a character is definitely not an unknown person.

Gong Miaoyi's power is ascending; her entire being has undergone a transformation, and even the brokenness of her breath has undergone a tremendous change.

That aura, when combined with her exquisite appearance, turns Gong Miaoyi from a pleasant person into someone with an imposing aura, like a queen.

The transformation of her strength now, at the very least, matches the peak power of a fourth-ranked expert. Jian Wushuang wasn't surprised. If Gong Miaoyi remained as useless as before, it would be truly unbelievable.

It must be said that Jian Wushuang has picked up a treasure this time.

Whew!

Gong Miaoyi slowly stood up, exhaling a long breath.

The inheritance has ended, with no difficulty whatsoever. This unique technique is related to her internal Origin Source, making it a perfect match, hence, there was no difficulty.

After the transformation of her strength, when she looked at Jian Wushuang again, she still couldn't see through him. This extinguished the thoughts that had just arisen in her.

Apart from Jian Wushuang, there is still a tier 5 peak Emperor beside him.

"Thank you, Young Master, for protecting the Dao!" Gong Miaoyi bowed and expressed her gratitude.

As the inheritance concluded, the crystal ball disappeared, returning to the dome.

This inheritance can only exist once, unless Gong Miaoyi falls, it cannot be passed on again.

This secret is known only to Gong Miaoyi. If it were to be revealed to outsiders, she might not survive.

Even though not everyone could cultivate the inheritance, at least one should give it a try!

Not to mention, those tier 6 old monsters would definitely come to snatch it.

A tier 3 Emperor could be easily killed with a casual move, without any hindrance. Obtaining a powerful inheritance was just a matter of course. Even if one couldn't cultivate it, taking a look would be beneficial. Perhaps it could help oneself in some way.

This secret had to be guarded, just like her mother did, revealing many things only when she fell.
