Chapter 735: The Metamorphosis!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After the first man had awakened his bloodline, others began to get out of the pools one after another.

In the blink of an eye, a whole day and night had passed.

Among the 13 people who had come to be baptized, 12 of them had finished and walked out of the pools, and two of them had even become Silver-armored Demon Gods. The only one left in the water was Jian Wushuang.

“It has been one day and night,” Elder Ying murmured and a sliver of light escaped her eyes.

“So far, except for Jian Wushuang still being in the water, the longest time any of them stayed in water was eight hours, and that man became a Silver-armored Demon God. Therefore, I think Jian Wushuang will awaken his bloodline as a Gold-armored Demon God.” A Two-star Ancient God gasped in admiration.

As time continued on, Jian Wushuang was still immersed in the water, absorbing energy from it.

The more he absorbed, the higher level his bloodline would be.

The clansmen waited for him to come out at the edge of the valley.

When it had been a whole day and night since Jian Wushuang went into the pool, those men felt quite surprised, and when it had been two days, they became thrilled.

“Two days and nights, and two-tenths of the energy of the Ancient God Gem has been consumed. And he is still in the pool!”

“In all the previous cases, all those who had stayed in the pool for two days and nights had become Gold-armored Ancient Gods.”

“It seems that he is not going to disappoint us.”

“Gold-armored Ancient God!”

Those onlookers were full of anticipation.

That was because, as time passed by, there were fewer and fewer Gold-armored Ancient Gods in their clan.

Presently, there was a total of less than a hundred Gold-armored Ancient Gods in the 10 clans combined.

In that big Baptismal Pool, Jian Wushuang was sitting with his legs crossed with the green energy flowing into his body continuously.

At the same time, he was experiencing a change.

Some time later, as the energy stopped flowing into him, he reached his limit.

His blood and bones felt thoroughly alive.

Excitement and jubilation filled his every cell.

“Aah!”

He suddenly let out a cry of pain, which seemed to come from deep inside him. His face twisted and his veins throbbed.

He opened his mouth in difficulty and tried to say something, but except for earsplitting roars, nothing else could be heard from him.

His voice resounded loudly throughout the place and alarmed all the creatures there.

The clansmen who were waiting for him at the edge of the valley had excited expressions on their faces upon hearing the roars.

“Seven days and six nights!”

“Finally, he is going to reach his limit.”

“He has consumed three-fourths of the energy of the Ancient God Gem.”

Those people looked toward Jian Wushuang with eyes full of astonishment and admiration.

The more energy one absorbed from the water, the higher the level his bloodline would be.

At the thought of Jian Wushuang absorbing energy in the pool for such a long time as seven days and six nights, those clansmen could not help wondering what kind of bloodline Jian Wushuang would awaken.

“I bet he is going to awaken his bloodline as a Gold-armored Ancient God. What’s more, it should be of the highest level.”

“Few in our clan can be his match in view of their bloodline levels.”

“Let’s just wait.”

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Then, with unbearable pain, Jian Wushuang’s body started to bulge, just as the other clansmen had experienced in the Baptismal Pools.

A moment later, his body grew visibly larger to 10 meters in height, and finally, to 15 meters.

Along with that, his skin gradually turned golden, and his arms and legs grew larger.

He looked exactly like a 15-meter-tall Gold-armored Ancient God.

“He is so strong and tall.”

“He became a Gold-armored Ancient God, 15 meters in height!”

“This…”

The onlookers were a bit dumbstruck. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

For a man in the Ancient God Clan, how tall he could grow was determined by his bloodline.

Normally, the Copper-armored Ancient Gods were about three meters tall, while the Silver-armored Ancient Gods were five to six meters in height.

As for the Gold-armored Ancient Gods, most of them were about 10 meters in height—few were taller than that.

Therefore, they were quite surprised by Jian Wushuang’s height after he transformed.

Suddenly, someone shouted, “Look, what’s that?”

The others immediately followed his eyes to look at Jian Wushuang’s chest, and they were again dumbfounded.

On Jian Wushuang’s chest, they saw a pattern of a Quadrangular Star.

The pattern represented Jian Wushuang’s level as a One-star Ancient God, and what surprised the clansmen so much was the area that the pattern covered.

The skin in that area was dark-golden, a little different from the other areas of his skin.

“Dark-golden!”

“Dark-golden?”

“How is that possible?”

The clansmen could not believe their eyes.

In their minds, each of the three kinds of Ancient Gods had skin that was just a single color.

The Gold-armored Ancient Gods were golden-skinned.

“Why is the skin on his chest different from the other parts of his body?”

“What the hell is this?”

As the pain inside Jian Wushuang diminished, a sliver of golden light escaped his eyes. With him suddenly looking up, there was a pressing force sweeping away from him.

Meanwhile, some images broke into his mind.

They were the Inherited Memories of the Ancient Gods.

The memories were about only one thing.

“The supreme skill of the Ancient God Clan—Three Fingers of the Ancient God!”
