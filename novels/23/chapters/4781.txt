His bare upper body was surging with unimaginably pure Yan power under his tough and withered skin.

A total of 14 Black and lustrous ring beads exuded a clear brilliance that blocked all resentment, evil thoughts, and monstrous Blood Qi.

Above Monk Konglun’s head, a pair of heaven-covering palms appeared from a mysterious light wheel. After blocking the wild sand colossus’s attack, they retreated.

At this moment, the originally earth-shaking battlefield fell into a brief silence.

Time seemed to have stopped.

Monk Konglun made his move, and his first move was against Lady Sha, who was controlling the wild sand giant.

Jian Qing and the others retreated and quickly arrived in front of him.

“Senior Brother, you’re finally willing to help,” Jian Qing panted heavily. Apparently, he had been severely injured by the attack just now.

Konglun retracted his hand and looked forward with his clear and emotionless eyes.

Sitting on the wild sand colossus, Lady Sha was also looking at him with a sneer on her lips.

The next moment, she raised her arm and pointed forward.

The sky suddenly cracked and collapsed, and the Blood Qi that was so solid that it seemed to have substance turned into a terrible vortex, spinning.

At the same time, an ugly face formed by countless vengeful souls and Blood Qi emerged from the vortex and gnawed at Konglun and the others.

A terrifying aura covered over a hundred miles.

All the top cultivators of the sects who were fighting with their swords were shocked when they saw this scene.

“Senior Brother.” Jian Qing and the others all looked at the empty wheel.

Konglun grunted in reply. The light on his body brightened as he plucked a bead from the string of beads on his neck and threw it into the air.

Instantly, the ring bead expanded ten thousand feet in the wind, and the bead burst out with thousands of rays of light. There were complex and obscure ciphertexts surging on the bead.

The two collided, and the ugly face that covered thousands of miles screamed and began to shatter.

Countless resentful souls were torn apart and fleeing in an attempt to escape from the Buddhist light. However, they were all being absorbed.

The Blood Qi was decreasing at a speed visible to the naked eye, and finally, it was all absorbed into the ring bead.

The battle between heaven and earth once again erupted.

“This woman is really something. I’m afraid her strength is not below mine.”

On the city wall, Cheng Qing nodded his head in confirmation, “If it wasn’t for the fact that I haven’t recovered my strength, I would have charged up and killed a few times.”

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. In their current situation, it would be extremely dangerous for them to enter the chaotic battle rashly.

Whether it was Lady Sha or the ten monks, they could easily deal them a heavy blow.

If it was not to investigate the situation, he would not even have taken the risk to stay. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

They could only wait and see.

Di Qing and the heroic-looking woman who was disguised as a young guard had also arrived on the city wall. They were watching the battle with their arms crossed.

At this moment, there were only five of them on the city wall. Although each of them looked extremely weak, they were not afraid of a battle between nearly 30,000 top cultivators. They even seemed to be watching.

However, each of these five people had enough strength to shake the heavens and earth, stirring up the winds and clouds of high heavens.

In fact, every superior not only broadened their own strength, but also their horizons, so they showed no fear.

During this time, Jian Wushuang had made up his mind. Regardless of the final outcome of the battle, he had to meet the monk who could fight on par with Lady Sha.

This was because he could see the mutual augmentation and restraint of each other.

…

After storing the vengeful spirits within a radius of over a thousand miles into the ring bead, Konglun raised his hand to recall them before connecting them back to its neck.

After sending several top cultivators flying with one strike, cui Jing rushed to the side of Lady Sha in an instant.

“Big Sister, do you want to kill this group of bald donkeys?!” Cui Jing said ruthlessly. He was covered in blood from the attack of the Supreme Treasure, but he did not care at all, like a demon god rushing out of a sea of blood.

With a wave of her flag, the giant sand statue beneath her crushed forward.

She said, “Expel them all. If they resist, capture them alive and imprison them in the Blood Sea.”

After saying this, her figure rushed out directly, bringing with it great momentum and countless blood rain.

In the Sand Demon Cave’s heaven and earth Domain, she was the supreme existence. Even though she was only at the peak of the Yan Immortal realm, it was enough to make all the sects in the entire Heavenly Region tremble.

The rain of blood that fell from her body caused the top cultivators of the sect to feel an unbearable burning pain. It was as if their souls were burning.

Naturally, their overflowing Yan power was also withering rapidly.

The evil cultivators in the sand demon cave were not affected at all. They formed groups of three to five and tore everything in front of them apart.

Looking at this scene, a look of pity appeared in Konglun’s eyes.

The nine monks around him, led by Jian Qing, began to chant the scriptures.

There was a clear aura that formed a rainbow shadow lotus bridge. It was set up from the heavens and earth and directly dispersed the blood rain.

The dense Blood Qi dispersed spontaneously when it faced the rainbow shadow lotus bridge formed by the scriptures, and the world became clear again.

The top cultivators of the sects who were struggling to resist felt that all the negative effects were expelled, and even the Yan power in their bodies was constantly recovering.

For a time, the battle started again.

Looking at the figure dashing towards him, Monk Konglun no longer stopped. His bare feet stepped onto the rainbow shadow lotus bridge, and the Zen robe tied around his waist fluttered in the wind.

“You shouldn’t have set foot here again. Have you forgotten what I said to you when I let you go?”

A pair of tall figures also stood on the rainbow shadow lotus bridge, and a dark red Blood Qi spread out, gradually dyeing the flowing scriptures blood red.

Monk Konglun stopped in his tracks and saluted with a single hand. “I have naturally not forgotten your warning back then, but I have still come. My goal this time is still to persuade you to turn back and not commit murder again.”

“Do you know the last warning that year?” Lady Sha frowned slightly and a blood blade had already formed in her palm.

“I’ve never forgotten,” Monk Konglun said, “if I set foot in the Sand Demon Cave again, my Buddha body will suffer 1,000 cramps and my Buddha heart will suffer the pain of being eaten by 10,000 insects.”

Her voice was cold. “Then why did you dare to come again?”

“That’s because I just want to try. Even if there’s only a tiny possibility, I won’t hesitate to do so.” The spatial wheel moved forward, and Scriptures began to flow between its brows.

“If I win, you only need to listen to my ten-day seat debate.”

“If I lose, I’ll forever fall into the extreme darkness and live on flesh and blood.”

“In addition, with the slanderous words, you will die when you see light, rot when you see wind, be injured when you see the ground, and suffer the pain of knives and axes when you see all living things.”

Konglun swore four bitter words to himself, swearing on the Great Dao of heaven and earth that he would never turn back.

“Is it possible to be a good man?” He lowered his head, his clear eyes filled with a warm smile.

Konglun’s bitter words were an oath to the Great Dao, and his voice resounded throughout the entire sky.
