Chapter 1586: Identity Exposed?

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Duan Lingfeng!!!”

Real God Chi Huo, who was cornered, had fire in his eyes as he stared at Duan Lingfeng and bellowed, “What happened today, we at Four Symbol Mansion, definitely won’t let it slip so easily. No matter where you go, we at Four Symbol Mansion will definitely hunt you down!”

“And you, Jian Wushuang!”

Real God Chi Huo looked at Jian Wushuang and the hatred in his eyes grew stronger, “You killed thirty Void Real Gods in Four Symbol Mansion. Even if you have Lineage of Star to back you up, don’t think they can shield you.”

“Humph!”

“Let’s go!”

Then, Real God Chi Huh turned to leave immediately.

Although the experts of Four Symbol Mansion refused to admit defeat, they had no alternative.

They knew clearly that, with their current formation, it was impossible to keep Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng. On the contrary, they might be massacred instead.

The other experts from Four Symbol Mansion would be rushing over but it definitely required time. During that time, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng definitely would have left. Who would be silly enough to stay back at the same spot?

As they couldn’t kill the two of them, they, of course, could only leave.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng stood there coldly as they watched the experts of Four Symbol Mansion leave. What Real God Chi Huo had said continued to reverberate in their ears but they didn’t worry.

The two of them were top geniuses and they rose abruptly in adverse circumstances. They experienced countless challenges and failures. They naturally wouldn’t be bothered by the threat that Four Symbol Mansion pulled.

“Jian Wushuang, thank you!” Duan Lingfeng looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Between you and I, it’s necessary,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and said, “Let’s make a move first. This is still within Four Symbol Land, in Four Symbol Mansion’s territory after all. Although the experts of Four Symbol Mansion left, it is hard to say if they would charge against us again. By then, experts like Chaotic Real God might attend to us personally.”

Regardless of Jian Wushuang of Duan Lingfeng, they knew their limitations.

They could only be evenly matched with an ordinary Eternal Real God at most. If they were to run into Eternal Real God who was slightly stronger or on the peak, they could only flee.

If they were to run into Chaotic Real God… whichever Chaotic Real God they sent could easily kill the two of them.

“Let’s go,” Duan Lingfeng nodded.

Very soon, the two of them left.

The experts of Four Symbol Mansion, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng left one after another. The remaining were the experts who came because of the ten billion Chaos Gem bounty.

Then, there was bedlam among the experts.

They had witnessed a shocking battle with their own eyes.

From their point of view, the battle was unbelievable!

…

In the void, outside Four Symbol Land.

“Phew, we’re finally out.”

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng let out a breath of relief.

In no time, a figure appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Mister Lei Chao,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly at the person.

Duan Lingfeng looked humble too.

“I originally thought I have to take action personally. But from what it seems, I belittled the two of you,” Lei Chao looked at Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng, and flashed a rare smile.

Jian Wushuang laughed in silence.

The message for Lei Chao to take action was a plan for the worst. It would definitely cause the relationship between Four Symbol Mansion and Lineage of Star to break entirely.

However, although Jian Wushuang had killed many Real Gods of Four Symbol Mansion, it was considered Jian Wushuang’s individual act. Four Symbol Mansion could at most reprimand Lineage of Star, but not to the point where they would instigate war against Lineage of Star.

“Let’s go. Let’s return first,” Lei Chao said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded and he sent a message to Hall Master Yuan to inform him of the ins and outs of the story.

“As long as you leave alive. As for Four Symbol Mansion… don’t worry so much. As long as you don’t go into Four Symbol Land, they can’t do anything to you,” Hall Master Yuan chuckled.

“Oh yeah, Hall Master Yuan, I have to tell you something,” Jian Wushuang’s voice became solemn.

“What is it?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“In Burning Demon Region, I did not conceal my power and aura. I am only a Universe God after all, but I revealed my fighting power to be far beyond what the scope of a Universe God could achieve. So… I’m afraid my identity of an inverse cultivator won’t be secret anymore,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Is that so?” Hall Master Yuan nodded faintly, “Actually when you were heading to Burning Demon Region earlier, I had already thought of that.”

“No choice. The treasure that Palace Master refined for you could only allow you to conceal your aura as a Universe God at most, but it won’t allow you to pretend to be a Real God. After all, Real Gods and Universe Gods are entirely different. Hence, unless you continued to hide your power and not fight, you will definitely expose your identity when you launch an attack.”

“Well, let it be then. You’ll expose yourself one day anyway. It doesn’t matter!”

“Plus, you have become more powerful. Even when you run into danger, you can deal with it. You will just have to be more cautious in the future.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded and let out a breath of relief in his heart. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He knew that once his identity as an inverse cultivator was revealed, he would definitely draw a lot of trouble.

However, the trouble would come anyway. He had mentally prepared long ago.

…

In Four Symbol Land, in Four Symbol Mansion.

In a lofty hall, the higher-ups of Four Symbol Mansion gathered. Real God Chi Huo and Real God Xue Wu were among them too, but the two of them looked slightly anxious.

On the high seat of the hall, there was a man with an imposing manner in a purple robe seated there.

At that very moment, the imposing man looked around and his cold voice reverberated in the hall.

“Two Eternal Real God and dozens of Void Real Gods launched attack simultaneously. In the end, you are heavily defeated by two Universe Gods. There were thirty Void Real Gods that died. We at Four Symbol Mansion are so embarrassed.”

Hearing what the imposing man said, everyone at the hall’s faces grew grave.

Four Symbol Mansion became a laughing stock.

“Chi Huo, Xue Wu, you are the two persons involved. Tell me what happened,” the imposing man overlooked the two of them.

Real God Chi Huo and Real God Xue Wu exchanged a look. Then, the former took a deep breath and said solemnly, “Mansion Master, what happened today is my and Xue Wu’s mistake. We cannot push away the blame. Regardless of how Mansion Master plans to punish us, we have no comment. But before that, I’d like to explain.”

The experts in the hall looked at Real God Chi Huo.

“Firstly, both Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang were both top geniuses. In terms of gifted talent among Universe Gods in Eternal Chaotic World, they are really at the peak. Even as Universe Gods, their powers shouldn’t be belittled. Secondly, when we found Duan Lingfeng, he had already broken through and become a Real God. In terms of power, he is definitely above me.”
