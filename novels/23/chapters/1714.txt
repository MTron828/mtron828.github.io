Chapter 1715: Ling Family

The You Ming Pub became quiet again. As for the bodies of the experts of the Ling family, some people from the pub came to remove them immediately.

However, after that, no one in the hub dared to make a racket. They even dared not to talk loudly as they were frightened that they might make Jian Wushuang dissatisfied.

Jian Wushuang was too lazy to care about it and he continued to look at the report.

However, all of a sudden, the green-clothed young lady behind the pub’s counter walked to Jian Wushuang.

“This Lord over here,” the green-clothed young lady was modest and she was not too fearful.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang did not even turn his head back. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Lord, do you know that the people who you just killed were experts from the Ling family, and that they are only inferior to the King? Throughout the ages, the people who had provoked the Ling family did not have a good life. Thus, I advise Lord to leave quickly before the experts of the Ling family come,” the green-clothed young lady said.

“Oh, thank you very much for telling me.” After talking, Jian Wushuang did not have any response.

The green-clothed young lady frowned and continued to talk: “From the looks of it, Lord seems to be an expert who came from another Holy Kingdom. Hence, you do not know how powerful the Ling family is. The Ling family itself has more than twenty Real Gods. Among them, there are a total of five Eternal Real Gods. Moreover, they even have a Chaotic Real God!”

“It’s a Chaotic Real God who can totally become a King if he were placed in some normal Holy Kingdoms. With such a great force, Lord…”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang only nodded his head like before.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang did not have any response, the green-clothed young lady shook her head and stopped advising him.

Although the people within the pub were afraid of Jian Wushuang’s abilities, they did not leave in a rush. Instead, they were waiting to watch the show that was about to occur.

After all, not just anyone could kill the people of the Ling family.

Moreover, the people who Jian Wushuang killed were a Real God with ten other top Universe Gods of the Third Heaven. Forgetting the Universe Gods, a Real God was like a tower of strength to the Ling family.

As expected, in no time, the experts of the Ling family who had gotten the news arrived.

This time around, twenty experts from the Ling family had come. Among them, there was a total of three Real Gods as well as one Eternal Real God.

After they arrived, they saw the piled up bodies of the experts of the Ling family which were unburied outside the pub and they became furious at once.

“Who is this person who dared to see my Ling family as nothing and kill my experts wantonly?”

A loud and furious shout which sounded like a lion roaring resounded throughout the whole pub.

The roaring voice then caused some cultivators with weak abilities among the many cultivators in the pub to have no choice but to cover their ears.

As the frightening pressure spread, a red, long-robed and stalwart old man with scarlet hair walked over slowly under the escort of his group of people.

The scarlet-haired old man was the Eternal Real God among the group of people and he was also Ling Yan, an expert from the Ling family who was known for his mighty reputation in the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.

Upon seeing the person who had come, many cultivators in the pub revealed a fearful expression and all of them lowered their heads. In addition, some of them even stood up immediately and retreated to the end of the edge. Only Jian Wushuang continued to sit down on his seat normally like before.

The scarlet-haired old man Ling Yan naturally noticed Jian Wushuang straight away.

“Eh?” Ling Yan’s expression turned grave.

Jian Wushuang had intentionally hidden his aura and normal cultivators were indeed unable to tell him apart. However, Ling Yan was an Eternal Teal God and Jian Wushuang’s Stage Two Ultimate Real God was equivalent to the level of an Eternal Real God. Since Jian Wushuang was of the level of Ling Yan, Ling Yan naturally managed to tell him apart.

“So it’s an Eternal Real God. No wonder he is able to kill Ling Tao and the rest of the people. However, the people of the Ling family are not people who can be killed by anyone. Even if you are an Eternal Real God, it’s still not allowed!” Ling Yan bellowed with rage.

“I have already killed them. If you wish to avenge them, go ahead and be my guest. There’s no need for any unnecessary words,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was ice-cold.

“Haha, what great courage. Seems like I, Iron Lion Ling Yan, have not fought for a very long time and the dynasty of Real Wushu is about to forget about me. Since that’s the case, I shall let everyone know my mighty name, Iron Lion, again!” Long Yan was extremely furious and also laughing at the same time. His laughter contained frightening soundwaves which spread across the area.

“Little kid, die!”

With a furious roar, air currents appeared as Ling Yan had already launched an attack.

“This sound is really noisy,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and extended that slender finger of his like before. With a finger, a similar shadow appeared.

Previously, this shadow had killed ‘Ling Tao’ and his group of people right away.

At that moment, when Jian Wushuang unleashed it again, he seemed to have pierced the body of Ling Yan instantly.

Ling Yan opened his eyes widely and they were filled with shock. However, his body had already started to fall.

An expert of the current generation, Iron Lion Ling Yan, who was famous in the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, was killed instantly.

Such a scene caused the people within the pub to be shocked again. As for the experts of the Ling family, they were extremely astonished as well.

“Go back and tell the head of the Ling family that I do not wish to cause trouble. However, if anyone dares to provoke me, I will not give them any mercy. I have already killed two waves of experts from the Ling family. If he has the guts to do so, he can continue to send the third wave over. However, I can guarantee that he will regret it,” Jian Wushuang’s voice spread slowly as he drank his wine.

The experts of the Ling family were shivering in fear and they did not dare to stay. They then took Ling Yan’s body along with them and headed back.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He had absolutely no intention of starting trouble and it was the people of the Ling family who took the initiative to look for him.

However, with his abilities, he could destroy countless powerhouses similar to the Ling family with just a flick of his finger. However, doing that would attract too much attention.

At that time, He Xiu had not been found and the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas had not appeared yet. As such, Jian Wushuang did not want to attract the attention of Sir God Liu Yin at such an early stage.

As for the Ling family, he did not plan to continue massacring them. However, if the Ling family was not tactful, then he was not to blame.

“Haha, your abilities are strong,” a hearty laugh could be heard abruptly.

Jian Wushuang continued drinking like before and everyone within the pub looked to the source of the voice.

A green-robed, middle-aged man who was carrying a green thunder saber on his back had already entered the pub. The green-robed, middle-aged man looked scholarly. However, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with a bit of arrogance.

“I am Di Lei. May I know who you are?” the green-robed, middle-aged man walked to the front of Jian Wushuang and questioned modestly.

When the surrounding people heard his name, they revealed shocked expressions.

“It’s Blood Thunder Saber Di Lei, the person whose abilities are only inferior to the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu!”

“A Chaotic Real God?”

“Gosh!”

Those people were so shocked that they were stunned.

However, Jian Wushuang was still normal like before and he was not too concerned.

“Di Lei? My name is… Sword Emperor,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was dull.
