Chapter 932: Emperor Xiao and Emperor Leng

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Emperor Xiao,” Jian Wushuang greeted, looking at Emperor Xiao.

“Well done, young man.” Emperor Xiao looked at him appreciatively.

“It’s unfortunate that Emperor Leng still chose Xia Mang. Otherwise…” Jian Wushuang felt dejected.

Emperor Xiao also turned sullen.

Having observed the Selection Ceremony he was well aware of what Emperor Leng had done.

“She’d sacrifice her reputation and even that of the entire country just for the marriage alliance with the Xia Clan. How could she be so disgraceful?”

“How dare you come here, Xiao!” Emperor Leng cried, casting her cold gaze on Emperor Xiao.

“Humph! Shuang’er is also my daughter. You can’t decide on her marriage alone.”Emperor Xiao replied, “You bitch, I’ve always known you to be a cruel person but I never thought you’d go so far as not show any concern for our daughter.”

“Since I’m here now, I won’t let you make the decision for Shuang’er.”

“Haha! With your strength alone?” Emperor Leng retorted sarcastically as she stared at Emperor Xiao. “You lost our battle and ran out of the Kingdom Tang with your followers. For many years you dared not show your face, yet you dare stop me today? How? With your 10 War Gods?”

“Of course not,” Emperor Xiao answered coldly. “I wouldn’t have come today if I’m not fully prepared.”

Just then, more than ten figures dashed out of the Void and arrived at the drill ground.

There were thirteen of them, each emanating strong, steadfast aura that instantly pegged them as Dao Masters. Their leader was a man dressed in purple that gave off a rather feral air.

Many people on the stand recognized him at once.

“Beiming Hao?”

“Isn’t that Beiming Hao of the Beiming Clan? There are also a few Dao Masters of that clan. The rest are also Dao Masters in the Eternal World. Did Emperor Xiao invite all of them here?”

Beiming Clan was also a top clan in the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land and was almost as good as the Xia Clan.

There were also quite a few solitary Dao Masters with fairly good strength.

“Beiming Clan?” Emperor Leng’s voice was icy-cold. “How audacious of you, Beiming Hao!”

Beiming Hao sneered but said nothing.

“It looks like you’re here to avenge yourself,” Emperor Leng said coldly while looking over at him. “But this battle formation of yours isn’t good enough to defeat me.”

“Of course, this isn’t all that I have to show.” Emperor Xiao nodded before looking over at where the audience was seated.

There, an elderly person with grey hair and a young-looking face stood up.

Everyone was stunned to see who it was. “Lord of Cercis Island?”

Emperor Leng was taken aback, too.

She did not care about the Beiming Clan.

They were a top clan with several Dao Masters under them but their Dao Masters were only at Rank One or Rank Two. Beiming Hao was the best of them but even he was only at the top level of Rank Two.

Lord of Cercis Island was another story.

Being the owner of Cercis Island, he was undoubtedly one of the overlords of the Eternal World.

There were six Dao Masters under his patronage and each of them was incredibly powerful. Lord of Cercis Island himself was a formidable opponent.

He had stayed in the level of Rank Three Dao Master for many years and his strength was unfathomable. He ought to be evenly-matched with Emperor Leng and Emperor Xiao themselves.

Emperor Leng had to be careful when dealing with a person with such strength.

She stared at him and asked coolly, “Lord of Cercis Island, are you going to intervene?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Emperor Leng, both you and Emperor Xiao are my friends and you were once a couple. I’m not supposed to intervene in this matter. However, what you’ve secretly done lately is against the will of Heaven, and therefore I must?intervene!” Lord of Cercis Island said.

His words surprised the people on the drill ground.

Had Emperor Leng done something that went against the will of Heaven?

What exactly did she do?

Lord of Cercis Island turned to look at the Alchemy Master in the audience and asked, “Alchemy Master, can you watch over my daughter for me?”

“No problem.” The Alchemy Master smiled.

“Thank you.” Lord of Cercis Island then turned to his daughter, Lin Wan. “Wan’er, you’ve been asking me to help Jian Wushuang. Now I’ll help him as you wish.”

“Father…” Lin Wan was a little surprised.

“Go now.” Lord of Cercis Island waved.

Lin Wan nodded and went to take a seat next to the Alchemy Master.

Finally, he jumped down from the stand and stood next to Emperor Xiao.

“Very well, Lord of Cercis Island!”

Emperor Leng laughed. She then looked around and addressed the crowd in a cold voice. “Who else? Who else is also here to help Xiao? Come out!”

“Me, too,” said a cold voice as another figure jumped off the stand.

This person had long bloody hair and wore a bloody robe. He was Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian.

“Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

Xue Lingtian grinned. “Junior Brother, I said I’d definitely help you in the event of mishaps.”

“Master Blood Saber.” Emperor Leng’s fury was apparent in her cold voice. “You’re the Master of the Void Temple; are you really going to intervene in this matter?”

“Haha! Emperor Leng, you misunderstood me,” said a gentle voice. It belonged to a white-haired elder who had been sitting next to Xue Lingtian the whole time. He was also one of the eighteen masters of the Void Temple.

The white-haired elder smiled. “Emperor Leng, Master Blood Saber will act in his individual capacity today. His actions today have nothing to do with the Void Temple.”

“In his individual capacity? That’s to say, the Void Temple won’t be mad at me even if I kill him today?” Emperor Leng retorted coldly.

“Correct.” The white-haired elder gave a small nod.

“Very well.”

Her voice was as cold as the snow in the coldest winter. “I thought this would be just an ordinary Selection Ceremony, but I didn’t think there’d be so many unforeseen events and so many people to help Emperor Xiao.”

“But that’s fine too. Since you’re all here, that saves me the time to go after you one by one.”

“Today, I’ll kill you!”

“Whoever’s in Emperor Xiao’s camp has to die!”

“Heavenly Guards!”

Emperor Leng’s scream rang through the entire imperial palace.

Figures dressed in golden robes rushed out of the imperial palace and went to her at an extraordinary speed.
