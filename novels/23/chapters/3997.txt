Chapter 3998: Galaxy

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The galaxy of the universe was incomparably bright and dazzling in the void space of the universe.

The most important thing was that the galaxy of the universe was vast and boundless, and it was connected to many star fields. Almost all the cultivators who traveled between these star fields had to pass through this galaxy, after all, even though cultivators could also rush to other star fields from the dark void space of the universe, the dark void space of the universe did not have a trace of light, and there were not any material symbols. Cultivators who traveled in the void space of the universe…it was easy to get lost, but it was different in the galaxy.

It could be said that the galaxy was an important link for the communication between the galaxies, which was why there were a lot of cultivators who came and went.

And because there were too many cultivators who came and went, there were some evil people who engaged in the business of plundering. These people were called space pirates.

In the galaxy, space pirates were rampant. In the Purple Micro Galaxy before them, there were countless space pirates hiding. There were even a large number of space pirate forces that specialized in plundering cultivators who came and went.

Around the vast Purple Micro Galaxy, there were a large number of cultivators. Most of these cultivators were only Principles Masters, but there were also a small number of Rulers.

They stood in groups of two or three outside the galaxy, forming a large gathering place for cultivators.

Buzz!

The universe boat, which gave off an ancient aura and looked extremely majestic, immediately attracted the attention of many cultivators around it when it appeared at the edge of the galaxy.

“There are so many people here?”

Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang sat side by side in the universe boat and looked at the large number of cultivators outside the universe boat.

“We’ve been wandering in the universe dark void for 3,000 years, but we haven’t seen a single cultivator. But now, there are so many people here. They must have drifted here from their hometowns, right?” Leng Rushuang sighed.

“I think so.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Under normal circumstances, as long as one became a Principles Master, he or she would have the capital to survive in the universe dark void.

Therefore, in the universe, there were many Principles Masters who would leave their hometowns after reaching a certain level of strength and go deeper into the universe. There were also some who would come to the universe to explore after becoming a Ruler.

There might not be many of these people from one or two star fields, but when countless star fields gathered at the edge of the universe, there would be more people.

Now, there were nearly 10,000 cultivators gathered around the galaxy.

Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang were talking when suddenly…many cultivators rushed toward the universe boat.

They did not dare to stand in front of the universe boat. They just came to the side of the universe boat.

Soon, voices were transmitted in.

“Sir in the universe boat, can you take me for a ride? I’m willing to pay the price.”

“And me. And me.”

“Sir, please give us a ride.”

The pleas entered Jian Wushuang’s ears, and he frowned.

“Master, if I’m not wrong, these people gathered at the edge of the galaxy. They must know that there are a lot of space pirates in the galaxy. They don’t dare to go in alone, so they stay here and wait for more people to come. Then they form teams to go in. Of course, if there are experts who want to enter the galaxy, they will try to curry favor with them. After all, if there are real experts leading them, it will be easier for them to pass through the Purple Micro Galaxy,” Devil Flame said.

“Do these people think we’re experts?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Of course. Master, you’re riding a universe boat. In the universe, owning a complete universe boat is enough to prove your identity. If you ride a universe boat into the galaxy, even if you encounter space pirates, they won’t dare to disturb you,” Devil Flame said.

Jian Wushuang understood.

He also understood that the universe boat was very precious. Those who could own a complete universe boat in the universe were not weak.

For example, this universe boat originally belonged to Devil Cloud star-master, who was a second-level star-world master. His strength had already reached the fourth-level Ruler level, and the fourth-level Ruler was at the edge of the universe, he was already a top expert. Under normal circumstances, he would not encounter any trouble if he wanted to cross the galaxy.

After all, the Star Island in the Purple Micro Star Field was probably only at the third-grade Ruler level. It was hard to say whether there would be a fourth-grade Ruler.

“Husband, should we bring these people?” Leng Rushuang asked.

“Madam, I advise you not to.” Before Jian Wushuang could speak, Devil Flame had already spoken.

“Why?” Leng Rushuang looked over.

“It’s simple. The universe is dangerous.” Devil Flame said in a low voice, “Madam, you and master must remember these words when you travel in the universe in the future so that you can live longer. There is no mercy in traveling in the universe. It’s better not to get into unnecessary trouble.”

“Devil Flame is right.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “Since these people have decided to leave their hometown and venture into the universe, they should have been mentally prepared. This is their own choice and has nothing to do with us.”

Jian Wushuang had obviously experienced a lot and had no sympathy for the cultivators who were begging outside the universe boat.

Perhaps if the Divine Beginning Realm did not have such a life-and-death crisis, he might have come to the universe when he was a Principles Master, and his experience would have been similar to those cultivators.

But so what?

It was their own choice, so what did it have to do with him?

“Let’s go, we’ll go straight into the galaxy.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and directly drove the universe boat toward the vast galaxy ahead.

The large number of cultivators surrounding the universe boat became anxious when they saw that the universe boat only paused for a moment before continuing forward.

“Sir, take us on a journey.”

“Sir, show mercy!”

The cultivators were shouting, hoping that Jian Wushuang would stop the universe boat and let them go up.

Unfortunately, the universe boat did not stop and quickly entered the galaxy. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Seeing this, these cultivators were also helpless.

“We entered the galaxy, but the people on the universe boat still couldn’t let us go up. What a pity.”

“It is indeed a pity. Such a complete universe boat, the person controlling it must be a top-tier great being. How could ordinary space pirates dare to provoke such a great being who was adventuring in the galaxy?”

“What kind of expert do you think the owner of this universe boat is?”

“I don’t know, but according to my estimation, he must be at least a third-level master, maybe a fourth-level master, or maybe even a fifth-level master.”

Many cultivators outside the galaxy were talking among themselves, but they did not blame Jian Wushuang for ignoring them and entering the galaxy directly.

After all, they knew the dangers of the universe, and it was the right choice for Jian Wushuang to do so.
