Chapter 261: I Just Need Five Years!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Besides his father Jian Nantian, Jian Wushuang cared for his brothers most in this world.

Jian Wushuang regarded Su Rou as his biological sister.

No matter who would harm Su Rou, he would defeat him first.

“I can see that the little girl you mentioned possesses a special constitution,” Jian Nantian also looked over and said indifferently, “generally, the more special a constitution, the greater possibility of being used.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s face sunk suddenly, looked to Wang Yuan and said, “Wang Yuan, you are the young master of the Alchemy School. Could you manage to protect the fourth sister in secret?”

“Although Ice Nether Valley cannot yet be compared with my Alchemy School, it also is a large sect in the area. Su Rou stays in the Ice Nether Valley, but the experts of our Alchemy School have no chance to enter, how could I protect her?” Wang Yuan shook his head. “But I will try my best to supervise Ye Chen. Once I find that he mistreats Su Rou, I will instantly take action. It’s no big deal to look for an opportunity to kill him.”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help shrugging.

As Su Rou was staying in the Ice Nether Valley now, he was unable to help her and had to depend on Wang Yuan.

“Dad, what are you going to do next?” Jian Wushuang looked at Jian Nantian again.

“I’m going to do one thing,” Jian Nantian said directly.

“What is it?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“This thing is related to your mother,” said Jian Nantian.

“Mom?” Jian Wushuang felt rather surprised, and merely said, “didn’t mom... die?”

His mother, Ji Wumeng, was killed by the experts of Blood Feather Tower many years ago.

“It’s Wuyue who told you that your mother died, right?” Jiang Nantian looked at Jian Wushuang and said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said and seriously nodded.

This thing news, including the genocidal killing of Ji Clan, was heard from his aunt, Ji Wuyue.

“It’s understandable.” Jian Nantian shook his head and smiled. “At that time, Ji Clan was implicated due to me and involved in genocidal killing. But Ji Wuyue was not there, so she didn’t witness the disaster, which made her think that all clansmen of Ji Clan, including your mother, were killed by the Blood Feather Tower. However, your mother didn’t die.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

His mother was still alive?

“Mom...” Jian Wushuang felt overwhelmed and murmured.

He had never seen his mother since he was young. Therefore, he always felt curious about his mother. At that time, when he heard the news from Ji Wuyue that his mother died, he was upset and indignant.

But now Jian Nantian told him that his mother, who he had never seen, was still alive?

“Wumeng is really alive.” Jian Nantian was narrating. “Originally, in the massacre, a lot of experts and clansmen of Ji Clan were killed. However, only your mother survived and was caught by a young man.”

“A young man?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“I will never forget that man.” Jian Nantian’s indifferent gaze suddenly became a little ruthless. A heavy killing intent appeared around him, which made the whole room become cold.

“The young man, with a golden robe, looked gentle and cultivated. There was a horrent and bloody red scar between his eyebrows, which might be a sword scar.”

“He is very strong.”

“The original Ji Clan was one of the eight top clans in the Tianzong Dynasty and ranked high. Even though the Blood Feather Tower took a long time and paid a high price to destroy Ji Clan. But it was this man who killed all the high-ranking members of Ji Clan without any effort, leaving only your mother who was taken away by him.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Killing many high-ranking members without any effort? Someone with such a strength might be an expert of the Saint Realm at least. Who is he?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know.” Jian Nantian shook his head. “His identity was very special. Even the Tower Master of Blood Feather Tower didn’t know his true identity. However, I met him again half a year ago.”

“Half a year ago?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued by this information.

Half a year ago, he stayed in the Ancestor’s Land and received the first test of the Ancestor’s Land.

“When I met him at that time, his exposed strength made him unfathomable. I don’t know how he took away my Sword Soul,” Jian Nantian said seriously.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Sword Soul? Dad, your Sword Soul was taken away by him?”

Jian Wushuang was really shocked.

He and his father both awakened Sword Soul. When in the Ancestor’s Land, he knew from Jin Ling that only the real genius of Sword Principle would be qualified to awaken the Sword Soul.

Jian Wushuang believed that someone would be able to destroy the Sword Soul, but it was much harder to take it away.

It was just like that the Cultivation of Spiritual Power a warrior gained with great efforts was completely stolen and transplanted into another man. Such a method was incredible.

“The means of that man was really extraordinary, and his strength was even more unfathomable,” Jian Nantian said seriously, “I’m afraid that I will fail when fighting him, but I must find out his identity and your mother’s whereabouts!”

“I don’t feel guilty about anything, except for your mother and Ji Clan. I will try my best to find your mother!”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang wore a serious look. “Dad, I will go with you.”

“You?” Jian Nantian looked at Jian Wushuang, shook his head and smiled. “You are too young and weak to help me.”

“But dad...” Jian Wushuang was anxious. When he opened his mouth, Jian Nantian interrupted him suddenly, and then said with a grin, “As long as you withstand three strikes from me, you can go with me.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Even Lin Xiaonan who reached Divine Transcendence and formed a saintly body could not withstand a strike from Jian Nantian. It was impossible for Jian Wushuang to survive three strikes.

Jian Nantian said with a smile, “Shuang’er, if you really want to help me, cultivate yourself and leave the Tianzong Dynasty to go to the vast expanse of the world. Only in this way could the nestling become an eagle, and you have a long way to go.

“The Holy Emperor Palace, I left it for you. That’s your first target.

“If you could destroy the Holy Emperor Palace within 10 years, you are really qualified to help me.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Destroying the Holy Emperor Palace within 10 years?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turn cold. “10 years is too long. I just need five years!”
