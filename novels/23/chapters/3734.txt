Chapter 3735: The Strongest Flight Type

The sudden burst of the True Treasure’s aura naturally attracted Jian Wushuang and the nearly 100 Principles Masters who were comprehending sword principle in front of the Sword Stone.

Immediately, the over 100 Principles Masters stood up.

Jian Wushuang also raised his head and looked at the source of the True Treasure’s aura.

It was very close to where he was. Very close!

As he released his soul power wantonly, it instantly covered an area of 100,000 miles. Less than 50,000 miles in front of him, the source of the True Treasure aura was there, Jian Wushuang saw a huge blood-colored vortex appearing in the center of the Earth. In the middle of the blood-colored vortex, a pair of pitch-black, cold wings slowly extended out.

“Wings? A Flight Type True Treasure?”

“And this aura...”

Even Jian Wushuang could not suppress the shock and joy in his heart when he felt the aura of the True Treasure emitted by the black wings and the great commotion around him.

Whoosh!

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang immediately rushed toward the location of the black wings at his fastest speed.

At the same time, the hundreds of Principles Masters who had been comprehending sword principle in front of the Sword Stone also rushed toward the black wings like wasps.

However, Jian Wushuang was much faster than the ordinary Principles Masters. Soon, he arrived at the void around the giant blood vortex.

He was also the first person to arrive here.

Standing in the void around the blood-red vortex, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were like lightning. He stared at the black wings that were slowly breaking out of the blood-red vortex, and his body trembled with excitement.

“It’s indeed the strongest Supreme Treasure!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

The strongest Universe Supreme Treasure, and it was a flight type Supreme Treasure such as wings?

Among all the universe True Treasures, due to the different functions of each type, the value of this True Treasure was naturally different.

Among them, the supreme universe True Treasure was, without a doubt, enough to cause the Rulers to go crazy for it.

And a supreme universe True Treasure armor was enough to drive the Rulers crazy and make them throw caution to the wind!

But now, the black wings that appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, which were breaking free from the blood-colored whirlpool, was clearly a Supreme Flight Type True Treasure!

Flight Type…in terms of value, it was even higher than the Supreme Treasure Armor. It was completely comparable to the most powerful Domain Type Supreme Treasure.

If such a Supreme Treasure was not born in the Red Cloud World, but in other parts of the Star Field, it would cause a stir in the entire Star Field!

“I am the first person to come to the vicinity of the black wing, but unfortunately, the wing has not been fully born yet.” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

In the Red Cloud World, it took a certain amount of time for a Supreme Treasure to be born. Jian Wushuang knew this very well.

As the most powerful flying Supreme Treasure, the black wings would be born even longer.

Although he was the first to arrive here, it would not take long for a large number of experts to arrive.

“No matter what, I must find a way to get the wings.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning, and he immediately took out his messaging token.

“Heaven-cleaving and Temporal, I have the strongest Flight Type Supreme Treasure. It’s around me. I’m the first to arrive at the scene,” Jian Wushuang sent a message.

“What?”

“The strongest Flight Type Supreme Treasure?”

Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master were immediately shocked.

After the shock, there was an unprecedented ecstasy.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, this strongest Flight Type Supreme Treasure is much more precious than the strongest Supreme Treasure Armor. If you can get it, then our trip in the Red Cloud World will be worthwhile. So, you must find a way to get it,” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said excitedly.

“Yes, a Supreme Flight Type True Treasure is too important. If you have one in the future, your life-saving ability will definitely be upgraded to a whole new level. Even if the original body of Devil Cloud Star Master arrives personally in the future, he might not be able to kill you.” Temporal Temple Master was also extremely excited.

“I know, but this Flight Type Supreme True Treasure is so precious. The competition for it will definitely be fierce. I don’t know if I can get my hands on it,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

It was not because he was not confident.

It was because the Supreme Flight Type True Treasure was so precious that even Rulers would lose their minds, let alone Principles Masters.

Moreover, the birth of the Supreme Flight Type True Treasure would take a long time, and it would attract more experts. Even Rulers on the Third Continent would be alarmed. In such an environment…it was not easy to get his hands on the most powerful flight-type True Treasure.

Besides, even if he was lucky enough to get his hands on the most powerful flight-type True Treasure, it would still be a problem for him to keep it.

“No matter what, you should think of a way to get your hands on the most powerful flight-type True Treasure first. I will rush to the Third Continent with Zhan Tian as fast as possible. Zhan Tian is far away from you, so it might take some time, but I can get there in half a day,” Temporal Temple Master said seriously.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

Jian Wushuang knew how Temporal Temple Master worked. If he was with him, it would be much easier for him to escape and save his life.

Of course, all of this was just empty talk. After all, the black wings had not been born yet, and he had not gotten his hands on them yet.

At that moment, attracted by the appearance of the black wings, more than 200 great beings had rushed to the surroundings of the blood-red whirlpool. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The main reason was that the place where the black wings had been born was too close to the Sword Stone. The appearance of the black wings had spread the news, and almost all of the 100 Principles Masters under the Sword Stone had arrived.

When they arrived, they naturally saw the level of the black wings.

“A Supreme True Treasure! This aura is definitely a Supreme True Treasure!”

“Black wings! This is a Supreme Flight Type True Treasure!”

“A Supreme True Treasure? And it’s an extremely rare Flight Type True Treasure! Oh my God!”

Around the blood-red whirlpool, the eyes of the more than 200 Principles Masters turned red.

Under those red eyes, they were filled with desire and madness.

At the same time, these Principles Masters immediately passed on this matter to the experts on the Third Continent who could arrive at the fastest speed.

For a time, the entire Third Continent, and even the entire Red Cloud World, were completely shaken.
