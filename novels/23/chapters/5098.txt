Chapter 5100 ¬†You Don‚Äôt Belong to This Era

Hidden within the mysterious celestial bone armor, which had concealed Xuan Yi's ultimate secret, why did such a terrifying existence exist?

Moreover, even Emperor Zhen Wuyang could not detect the realm of the black-robed figure.

In what form did he truly exist within the bone armor, and for how many ages had he existed?

Everything seemed to come to the surface, yet everything also entangled even more, like a tangled mess of threads that one couldn't even begin to unravel.

Jian Wushuang remained silent for a moment and then said, "He emerged from a piece of bone armor."

"Bone armor? What bone armor?" Zhen Wuyang's gaze turned serious.

"A piece of bone armor that contained hidden inscriptions, very mystical, but it has now been destroyed," he said, "and this black-robed person emerged from that bone armor."

To have a black-robed figure emerge from a piece of bone armor with strength comparable to a Peak Grand Yan Immortal was beyond belief.

You see, even a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, which was close to the Emperor's Dao, perceived the Emperor's fate energy. Not to mention the Peak Grand Yan Immortals.

Peak Grand Yan Immortals were already at the pinnacle of existence. They had found and immersed themselves in their Dao for countless ages, nearly equivalent to an Emperor-to-be's existence.

So, who could seal such a Peak Grand Yan Immortal within a small piece of bone armor?

Or perhaps, was it voluntary on his part to be sealed within it?

After hearing Jian Wushuang's account, Zhen Wuyang's expression changed several times, but he ultimately returned to calmness.

"In other words, you hold such a piece of bone armor and seek a Great Yan Immortal who can decipher the inscriptions on it within the Great Mi Heaven?"

Jian Wushuang nodded, "That's correct, but I didn't expect there would be such an entity within that bone armor."

Zhen Wuyang was furious, "Nonsense! If there is something even more terrifying within that bone armor, what will you do? Do you intend to destroy my Great Si Region?"

"..."

"I'll settle the score with you later!" Zhen Wuyang left these words behind and turned his gaze to the black robe.

Then, the chains formed by Emperor's fate energy directly restrained the black-robed figure's limbs, suspending him in the center of the SkySide Cloud Platform, hanging in the air.

The Emperor's fate energy was majestic, making all the Great Yan Immortals dare not look directly at it.

Zhen Wuyang slowly approached the black-robed figure, his eyes filled with supreme authority.

"Where did you come from, and why did you remain within a piece of bone armor?"

The clouds rolled and the wind picked up abruptly.

Within the silent hall, the figure remained silent.

Zhen Wuyang furrowed his brow and said, "If you won't speak, do you understand the consequences?"

The Emperor's power descended, completely enveloping the black-robed figure.

Under such power, a substantial amount of dark purple mist spilled out from under the black robe and quickly dissipated.

Seeing this energy, not Yan power of the Great Si Region but equally formidable, Zhen Wuyang reached out and plucked a strand of dark purple radiance. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

This tiny strand of dark purple radiance danced in his palm and persisted for a long time but seemed to repel Yan power, ultimately dissolving.

Zhen Wuyang tightly closed his Emperor Eyes, seemingly sensing the source of this radiance.

Within the SkySide Cloud Platform, there was an unparalleled silence, and no one dared to speak.

At this moment, Yu Chang smiled and looked at Jian Wushuang, saying in a voice only they could hear, "Young Jian, you've gotten into trouble this time."

Jian Wushuang bitterly smiled, "I never expected this outcome."

"It doesn't matter; the Emperor will surely have a way," Yu Chang said with a narrowed smile. "Did you have encounter anything strange on your journey?"

Jian Wushuang hesitated for a moment and then replied, "No, this journey to the Great Mi Heaven was nothing but heart-pounding. I didn't encounter anything else."

Yu Chang nodded at his response and did not say more.

Jian Wushuang secretly sighed in relief but also felt a hint of confusion. 'Could they have discovered it so quickly?'

However, he quickly suppressed this thought. After all, the Boyang Bottle was an item of Emperor Yang Jun himself, capable of concealing even the Heavenly Court. How could it fail to hide a Peak Grand Yan Immortal?

With this in mind, Jian Wushuang suddenly widened his eyes and became anxious. 'No, this is bad! Could they be fighting over it?!'

All along, the Boyang Bottle had served as his personal treasure chest, storing all the treasures he had acquired, including his trump cards.

The ink-blue crystal containing the black-robed elder was casually stuffed into the Boyang Bottle by him.

As Yu Chang's Sword Spirit, the black-robed elder had undoubtedly participated in one bloodbath after another.

In other words, it was highly likely that Yu Chang had been involved in the annihilation of the three Emperors of the Heavenly Court.

This was an irreconcilable blood feud, with no possibility of reconciliation.

If they were to fight inside the Boyang Bottle, the three Emperors, left with only their True Spirits, would undoubtedly be at a disadvantage and might even be defeated.

No matter what the situation, this was something Jian Wushuang did not want to see.

However, with two true Emperors watching him, Jian Wushuang could not open the Boyang Bottle to check what was happening inside. He could only fret silently.

At this moment, Zhen Wuyang opened his eyes, and a golden light shone in his gaze.

He seemed to have realized something, his brow furrowing and then relaxing.

After a moment, Zhen Wuyang said, "You don't belong to the Great Si Region, or even to this era. Who are you?"

This sentence was like a tsunami, even Yu Chang's expression turned solemn.

The weight of this sentence contained too much information.

Zhen Wuyang, who had emerged from the distant and desolate Ancinet Era and had swept through one Heavenly Court after another, must have known something profound.

The Ancient Era was already an unimaginable era, and now there was an even more era than that?

And this black-robed figure existed from that mysterious era?

Jian Wushuang realized that he had severely underestimated the age of the Heaven-Patterned Bone Armor and was filled with an indescribable emotion.

Could it be that the news from his master, Xuan Yi, had already become a secret in an era where even time and years had no meaning?

Who was he? What had he done to end up in this situation?

Jian Wushuang was shaken and looked at the black robe with a deep desire to learn some information from him.

But under the suppression of the Emperor's fate energy, the black-robed figure was once again on the brink of extinction.

"You don't belong to this era, who are you?" Zhen Wuyang repeated the question, somewhat annoyed.

The black robe, who had been silent, raised his head at this moment, and two dark purple cold lights shot out from under the wide hood.

It was his gaze, scrutinizing Zhen Wuyang.

Then, that old, hoarse voice spoke again, "One who gazes upon the Secret Text shall perish!"

"Is that the only thing you have to say?" Zhen Wuyang frowned. "If you're willing to tell me, I'll let you go once, free you from suffering, and allow you to leave."
