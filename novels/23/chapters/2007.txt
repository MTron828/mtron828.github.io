“This, this is the dark millstone?”

Everyone looked astonished.

Previously, they had only seen the dark millstone through the mirror image and the mirror image hadn’t shown the entire scene. Plus, ten years had passed. The size of the dark millstone had grown bigger significantly.

“The speed of growth of this dark millstone is shocking. Its power is constantly growing stronger too. We have to destroy it at our fastest possible speed,” Ancestor Tian Chen said in a deep voice.

“Don’t delay anymore. The four of you, are you ready?” Emperor Bai looked at the four of them.

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao exchanged a look and nodded solemnly.

Emperor Bai squinted his eyes and then took out a transparent pearl.

The transparent pearl contained a grayish mysterious power and there was faint lighting flashing within.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had seen this transparent pearl before.

XXX

It was used to break formation or prohibition.

A long time ago, when Jian Wushuang had yet to leave Green Fire World, they took out XXX when they fought with Jin Kingdom.

However, the power of the XXX that they had taken out back then and the one Emperor Bai was holding was vastly different.

“This is the top grade XXX from ancient times. XXX of this level can forcefully tear an opening in the great formation, no matter how powerful it is. However, the opening will only last for a split second. The four of you have to seize the chance to get inside.

“Yes,” the four of them nodded.

Emperor Bai took action.

He drove the pearl with his divine power and he threw it at the huge dark millstone that was spinning.

The moment the XXX appeared on the surface of the dark millstone, there was a dim light on the dark millstone. The dim light looked extremely mysterious but powerful!

As the XXX exploded, a terrifying power exploded too. It tore everything and the dim light tore a gap big enough for a person to pass through.

“Right now,” there was a flash of light in Emperor Bai’s eyes. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Let’s go!” Abysmal Saint Master roared.

Then, the four of them who were ready long ago plunged through the gap without hesitation and disappeared behind the gap.

The gap immediately vanished right after they plunged through.

“They’re in.”

Emperor Bai and the rest waited in the void outside the dark millstone and all of them looked solemn.

They didn’t know what was in the dark millstone, nor did they know what Jian Wushuang and the troop would encounter. However, because they didn’t know, someone had to step forth to find out.

“I hope that the four of them will return from the dark millstone alive,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“They not only have to walk out alive, more importantly, they also have to collaborate with us to destroy this dark millstone. Otherwise… If the dark millstone continues to spin, it will be only a matter of time until we all die,” Red Dragon King said in a deep voice.

The surrounding Great Emperors heard and nodded simultaneously in agreement.

They knew the responsibility that the four members carried.

It could be said that they were a crucial factor if Eternal Chaotic World could survive the crisis.

“The four of them carry a heavy responsibility. The other experts outside the dark millstones are equally important too. We can’t be careless,” Emperor Bai said.

“Yes,” the surrounding Great Emperors’ gazes were cold.

…

In the huge, dark millstones, Jian Wushuang and the others went through the gap and appeared within a huge formation.

“This great formation is complicated. Not only does it have the powerful defense power on its exterior, there are also many prohibitions internally,” Emperor Jiu Qiao’s face grew grave.

“Zhi Luo, you’re the best at the manipulation of spacetime power and you’re the best among the four of us in formation. Hurry up and lead us out of this prohibition,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“I’ll try,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo looked solemn.

She walked at the front while Abysmal Saint Master, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Jiu Qiao followed behind her.

“Jian Wushuang,” Abysmal Saint Master suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang as they traveled forward, “Although you and I had a conflict, this is no trivial matter. I hope you draw a clear distinction between private and public interests. I hope you will follow my instructions.”

“Don’t worry. As long as you do not scheme against me, or are obviously sending me to death, I naturally will follow your instructions,” Jian Wushuang replied coldly.

“Good,” Abysmal Saint Master glanced at Jian Wushuang again but didn’t say anything more.

Just as the four of them entered the dark millstone and traveled forward in the prohibition, in the depth of the dark millstone.

There were three lofty thrones towering in the boundless dark void.

Leng Ruxue, the savage man and the blurry, bloody man sat there.

In front of them, there was a man in a black robe who knelt down politely.

“Misters, I have already located the location of the few people who barged in via the great formation. However, they are extremely powerful and they have already broken through the strongest obstacle. Although there are some prohibitions in front of them, it will be impossible to kill or even block them,” the man in the black robe reported.

“If prohibitions won’t kill them, why not send a few experts to kill them?” The savage man spoke with a bright void.

“Sure, but judging by their travel speed, they would have definitely passed the prohibited range and appeared in our world by the time our experts arrive. In other words, we can’t kill them before they enter the world,” the man in the black robe said.

The savage man’s expression grew in distress.

If the few of them were to really enter the world, there would be many secrets about the world that would be exposed.

“Forget it. It is only a matter of time until they are exposed. Which territory will they appear in after they pass the prohibition?” The savage man asked.

“Looking at their current location, they should appear near Silver-Winged God Mansion,” the man in the black robe replied.

“Silver-Winged God Mansion?” The blurry, bloody man looked down, “As we can lock onto their location, send experts over immediately. Kill them at the fastest possible speed! It’d be best if it happens before they receive any information about this world or even share the information before they die.”

“Ling Zong is near Silver-Winged God Mansion, right? Tell him to rush over. With him there, these few people won’t even think about fleeing! Humph! Want to resolve this grand formation from within and destroy this world entirely, dream on!”

“Yes,” the man in black took the command and sent it down immediately.

Jian Wushuang and the others weren’t aware that they were being watched since the very moment they entered the dark millstone.
