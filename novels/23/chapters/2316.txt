2317 Targeted

With Heaven’s Will in control, the space of Absolute Beginning Divine World was a lot more stable than the Eternal Chaotic World.

When he was in Eternal Chaotic World, releasing all his powers without restraints would easily destroy an area and space of 100,000 to 1,000,000 miles.

In the Absolute Beginning Divine World, unless you were a supreme expert that stood above it all, it wouldn’t be that simple to destroy the world.

Obviously, with the space being so stable, it would be harder to open up a wormhole.

As such, many places in Absolute Beginning Divine World didn’t have a wormhole. For example, Anjiu Prefecture. Only a few ancient sects within the Wusha Barren Region might have some wormholes. Therefore, cultivators in Absolute Beginning Divine World would often have to travel on their own or rely on some flying-assisted treasures like flying ships.

From Lin Mansion to Incineration Moon City, it wasn’t too far. Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi were running throughout.

With their speed, it would probably take ten days for them to reach Incineration Moon City.

On the journey.

“Uncle Lin Yi, how long have you been out of closed door practice?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“It has been three months since my cultivation base stabilized,” answered Lin Yi with a smile.

Three years ago, Lin Yi was struck with inspiration after seeing Jian Wushuang demonstrating the Snow Cleave. Immediately after, he had gone into seclusion until three months ago.

He had made a breakthrough in Sword Principle and would be classified as reaching the minimum threshold.

“Congratulations. If I’m correct, you now probably have the fighting strength equivalent to a Half Step Divine Demon, right?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Not exactly. A Half Step Divine Demon isn’t just about one’s understanding of weapons. It also requires more concentrated divine power. More importantly, I will have to grasp some Rules of Order. It isn’t that easy to grasp some Rules of Order.” Lin Yi sighed emotionally.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t feel the same way.

With Heaven’s Will controlling the Absolute Beginning Divine World, the Rules of Heaven and Earth were extremely dense and couldn’t be compared with the Eternal Chaotic World.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, grasping some Rules or Order would be truly difficult.

It would still be relatively easy to do so in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Nonetheless, it wasn’t an easy task either.

“My little friend, Wushuang, I have you to thank for this breakthrough. If it wasn’t for your guidance previously, I wonder how much longer I would have taken to reach the minimum threshold of Sword Principle.” Lin Yi was sincerely grateful and behaved extremely humbly before Jian Wushuang. He was from the same generation as Jian Wushuang’s father and had an extremely good relationship with him. Interactions with Jian Wushuang’s father were like those of equals.

However, when he was before Jian Wushuang, he was more like a junior.

“The main reason why you are can reach the minimum threshold for Sword Principle is because of your hard work and ability to grasp concepts. However, don’t get too overjoyed just yet. The threshold of Sword Principle is only the beginning to the path of swords. The Sword Principle is deep and profound. The road ahead is still long!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I can understand. However, I don’t have that ambition. My only goal would be to be like you, reaching Great Achievement in Sword Principle. That would be sufficient for me. However, I wonder how long it will take with my talents to reach that level. Perhaps I might not reach it in this lifetime,” Lin Yi sighed.

He wasn’t a demon-like talent at Sword Principle like Jian Wushuang.

Reaching Great Achievement in Sword Principle would be an extremely high level for him.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had attained that level at just the age of sixteen.

“As long as you are willing to work hard, you will reach it,” answered Jian Wushuang.

Both of them were chatting along the journey.

Just when they were crossing a mountain range.

Weng!!

Jian Wushuang stopped abruptly and squinted his eyes.

“What’s the matter, pal?” Lin Yi looked over, feeling baffled.

“Uncle Lin Yi, it seems like it won’t be easy for us to reach Incineration Moon City safely,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What do you mean?” Lin Yi furrowed his brows.

“We are being targeted.”

Upon hearing this, Lin Yi was astounded. He upped his vigilance immediately and spread his soul power out without reserve.

Just as expected, at the deepest point of the mountain range, there were several extremely faint auras.

Noticing that they had been discovered, the owners of these auras didn’t attempt to hide further.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Five figures shot up into the sky and appeared before Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi.

Among the five, three were men while the rest were women. All of them had varying levels of aura.

Jian Wushuang was able to tell the strength of these five people by just extending his soul power through them.

Among the five, four were Chaotic Realm. Of which, two were Middle Stage Chaotic Realm and the other two were Early Stage Chaotic Realm. There weren’t any at the Chaotic Realm.

Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi weren’t concerned about these four at all.

However, the red-haired old lady with a dragon-head truncheon had an especially strong aura.

This aura was the level of a Half Step Divine Demon!

Because of her, Lin Yi looked extremely gloomy.

“Who are you guys? Why did you block us off?” Lin Yi asked loudly.

“Uncle Lin Yi, that’s not necessary. All five of them must be from the Zhuge Family,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Zhuge Family?” Lin Yi turned solemn.

“When I defeated Zhuge Hong yesterday, I expected the Zhuge Family to come looking for me. I just didn’t expect them to act so quickly,” Jian Wushuang mumbled.

“Hehe! Lad, you are pretty smart. However, you got something wrong. We aren’t from the Zhuge Family. We are just helping them,” the red-haired old lady answered.

This was the territory controlled by the Lin Family, after all. Although the Zhuge Family had lots of experts within their territories, it was still a little hard to mobilize experts that could definitely kill Lin Yi and Jian Wushuang. Therefore, the Zhuge Family had paid a price to hire the red-haired old lady.

“So that’s how it is. I know all Half Step Divine Demons of the Zhuge Family and yet didn’t recognize you, so you aren’t from the Zhuge Family,” Lin Yi said coldly. “You should know who we are. If you work for Zhuge Family today, you will offend Lin Family completely. Our Lin Family will definitely hunt you down and there won’t be a place for you in Anjiu Prefecture anymore. Why don’t you guys stop here and be friendly with our Lin Family?”

Lin Family knew the threat of the five people before him.

Therefore, while sending a message to Lin Mansion requesting reinforcements secretly, he was trying to convince the red-haired old lady to stop.

Even if he couldn’t convince her, he wanted to buy as much time as possible.

“Stop here? Wishful thinking. I have taken benefits from the Zhuge Family and am here at their request. It’s only natural that I keep my word. As for how your Lin Family will want to pursue us in the future, we aren’t from the Anjiu Prefecture to begin with. After this, we will leave Anjiu Prefecture for good. Your threats do not mean anything to us at all. Therefore, you two can just sit tight and wait for your deaths obediently!”
