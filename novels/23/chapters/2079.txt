Chapter 2080 Soul Memory, Confirmed!!

Hong~

That murderous aura covered Jian Wushuang.

The Ancient God Emperor may have had nothing left but his strand of consciousness, but that was more than enough to shake the heavens.

The awesome, murderous aura of the Ancient God Emperor would have brought others to heel by now, but not him. Jian Wushuang remained standing, emotionless. The aura was nothing more than a gentle wind to his face.

“Composed,” the Ancient God Emperor’s face broadened to a grin, that murderous aura of his now long gone. “What do you seek, kiddo?”

“I want to be a new emperor of the Ancient God Clan, and I need your approval,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Haha, the Ancient God Clan has always prioritised bloodline over everything. You possess the perfect bloodline, which is something I myself dare not claim. That along with your skillset, the entire clan should have embraced you by now, why seek my approval?” the Ancient God Emperor smiled.

“The other clansmen are naturally fine with it, but King Chen Xing insists,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Chen Xing? That kid…” The Ancient God Emperor’s expression changed.

He had three sons, of which Chen Xing was the youngest, and his dearest.

When the First Era collapsed, it had cost him an arm and a leg to keep Chen Xing alive, along with others.

“King Chen Xing’s abilities are decent, I’m hoping to win him over. With him by my side, I’ll be better equipped to take charge of the Ancient God Clan,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I see,” The Ancient God Emperor replied in realisation, and laughed. “Kiddo, I have high standards, you should know that by now. You want my approval, you’ll have to let me get a good look at you, don’t resist…”

As he spoke, a mysterious power rose from his body, and charged towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang frowned, but he could feel that the power was of no threat to him, so he did not resist. The power entered into his body, and blanketed his substantive soul.

“Hm?”

Jian Wushuang realised. “Checking my Soul Memory. Impressive move.”

Soul Memory refers to the memory one possesses the moment he gains his Soul Power, recording everything the person experiences.

Knowing the Ancient God Emperor’s intentions, Jian Wushuang did not hide much, except for some hidden memories about his past, which he locked instantly. Even the Ancient God Emperor could not access it, only viewing what Wushuang wanted him to see.

That did not frustrate the Ancient God Emperor as he started to view these memories.

From these memories, he saw two important things.

The first memory was when he kept the pillar intact with the Lineage of Stars, leading to the demise of the Star Palace Master. Jian Wushuang, with thunderlike strikes, had used the Lineage of Stars, and managed to survive against the punitive expeditions of other forces, allowing the Lineage of Stars to be recognised as the top powers by the Sanctuary Alliance.

The second memory was outside the Green Fire World.

Jian Wushuang was alone, against the experts in the Eternal Chaotic World. Against so many enemies from so many clans and tribes, he stood firm.

“This Green Fire World is my hometown. Whoever dares lay a finger on it will die!”

“Asking the cultivators to leave the Green Fire World? I’ll be the first to say never! So will the countless cultivators on this land, and our forefathers who came before us!”

“Even if it means burning to ashes, we will fight for this land, till the very last man is down, till the last drop of blood is shed, we will never give in!”

Every word Jian Wushuang said, including the aura of defiance, to look death calmly in the face, was all captured by the Ancient God Emperor.

Yet the Ancient God Emperor’s eyes showed nostalgia.

That had been a long time ago, when the First Era was about to collapse. Countless experts from the First Era, himself included, had all looked death straight in the eye during their battle.

That unyielding defiance was to protect what they had.

Exactly the same as Jian Wushuang with his Green Fire World!

Seeing this, the Ancient God Emperor could not help but display excitement.

“Haha, I kinda like you now kiddo!” the Emperor burst into laughter. “For someone to look death straight in the eye, for your friends and family… I like people like you.”

“Do I have your approval?” Jian Wushuang asked the Emperor. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I approve, of course I do. If an able leader like yourself is willing to carry this responsibility of leading the Ancient God Clan, I believe we will survive through all challenges!”

“Furthermore, not only will I make you the new Emperor for our Ancient God Clan, I’ll present you with the greatest gift you can find over here.”

The Ancient God Emperor’s laughter resonated, and with a flip of his hand, three drops of gilded blood essense appeared.

“This…” Jian Wushuang was mesmerised by it.

He could feel the billowing power within those three drops. The Ancient God Power, purer and stronger than any other blood essences he had seen.

The Ancient God Emperor said solemnly, “Great pains were made to form the blood essence, every drip containing immense Ancient God Power. I’ve only collected five in my life, of which one I transfered to Chen Xing in my era. The remaining four followed me to this grave.”

“Many years ago, a lad named Luo Yu came and passed my test, so I passed him one, leaving three.”

“These three drops, I had intended to slowly pass down to future generations. But now, I’ve decided to give you everything!”

“Cultivate and absorb it, I’ll help you too.”

As he finished talking, the three drops of blood were already floating towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was alerted, but did not reject it. The three drops immediately integrated themselves into his body, the Ancient God Power billowing from within. Jian Wushuang started to cultivate the blood essence to the best of his ability.

It goes without saying that three drops of blood were too much. One drop was beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination, and now three?
