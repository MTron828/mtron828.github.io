Chapter 3993: 36,000 Years

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Seven months later, Jian Wushuang’s daughter was born. Jian Wushuang named her Xuan ‘Er.

In terms of talent, Jian Xuan ‘Er was no less talented than Jian Qing, but she was much more obedient and sensible than Jian Qing.

Jian Qing was a more flamboyant and lawless character. In addition, his father, Jian Wushuang, was wandering around in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Of course, Jian Qing was very kind and did not bully the weak. Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang had taught him this since they were young.

Jian Xuan ‘Er, on the other hand, had been very obedient since she was young. She followed the rules and was completely different from Jian Qing.

!!

Jian Wushuang also taught them how to behave when they were young. As for how they would behave in the Divine Beginning Realm, he did not care. He and Leng Rushuang lived on the Eternal Island and occasionally went around, they went to every corner of the Divine Beginning Realm and lived a very carefree life.

However, while they lived a carefree life, Jian Wushuang’s cultivation did not lag behind.

It must be known that he was now in control of the will of the Heavenly Dao in the Divine Beginning Realm. He could use the will of the Heavenly Dao to meditate at all times and even stir up the universe.

In addition, he had just become a Ruler and his strength was in an explosive stage. With such a huge innate advantage, his improvement speed was also extraordinary.

However, no matter how great his improvement was or how strong his strength was, there was no room for him to display his strength in this star field.

Time was merciless, and time continued to pass.

In the blink of an eye, 36,000 years had passed since the end of the battle and the Divine Beginning Realm was completely settled.

On the Eternal Island, in the manor.

Jian Wushuang casually sat there. In front of him, there was a strong young man who was nearly two meters tall. He was brandishing a huge axe and practicing his axe skill.

Because he was on the island, the strong young man did not use divine power and only used the profound essence of the axe skill. However, the momentum of his axe skill was still very shocking.

After a while, the strong young man stopped what he was doing and stood there, looking at Jian Wushuang nervously.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and said, “It’s not bad for you to reach this stage in 30 years. However, your understanding of the axe principle is still too weak. You need to improve more.”

“Yes.” The burly young man nodded heavily.

“Father, the secret realm that Bei Yi was in was very special. It was too narrow and many cultivators did not have any research on the axe principle. Although Bei Yi is the strongest expert in the secret realm, he did not receive any guidance before. He just relied on his own ability to reach that level. He started very late in the axe principle. In addition, it has only been 30 years. I think he has made great progress.” Jian Xuan ‘Er, who was dressed in purple, said.

Jian Xuan ‘Er completely inherited her mother’s beauty and was born with the same beauty. The difference was that her mother, Leng Rushuang, was cold by nature. It was Jian Wushuang who opened her window, while Jian Xuan ‘Er was not in a cold mood.

“What? I just agreed to your matter, and you’re so eager to speak for him?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Jian Xuan ‘Er.

“Of course not.” Jian Xuan ‘Er blushed and lowered her head in shame.

The burly young man touched the back of his head and smiled.

Leng Rushuang shook her head and smiled when she saw this.

Jian Xuan ‘Er was the apple of their eyes. Jian Wushuang had always valued her. 36,000 years had passed, and Jian Xuan ‘Er and Jian Qing had already broken through to Principles Master.

Jian Qing had already married and had children a long time ago. Now, he even had a lot of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, Jian Xuan ‘Er had very high expectations and had never found a suitable husband.

Until 100 years ago, when Jian Wushuang and his wife took Jian Xuan ‘Er on a trip in a secret realm of heaven and earth, they saw Bei Yi.

At that time, the secret realm of heaven and earth happened to be in a life-and-death crisis. Its situation was almost comparable to that of the Divine Beginning Realm 36,000 years ago. In the Bald Man in crisis, it was Bei Yi, the acknowledged number one expert of the secret realm of Heaven and earth, he had risked his life to fight a powerful enemy alone.

In the end, he killed the enemy, but he was in a desperate situation and was almost certain to die.

Jian Wushuang looked at Bei Yi and thought of the crisis in the Divine Beginning Realm. He was also determined to die and wanted to fight with Patriarch Devil. He was moved and saved Bei Yi, then he brought Bei Yi back to the Eternal Island.

Since then, Bei Yi had temporarily lived on the Eternal Island. At first, it was nothing. Who would have thought that his daughter, Jian Xuan ‘Er, would witness Bei Yi risking his life to fight the enemy for his hometown, she became very interested in Bei Yi.

Jian Xuan ‘Er often came to see Bei Yi. After a while, the two actually developed feelings for each other.

Until 30 years ago, when the two of them completely confirmed their relationship, Jian Wushuang did not object and directly agreed.

There was nothing to object to. Jian Wushuang saved Bei Yi himself, so his character was absolutely fine. As for his strength, although it was a little weak, Jian Wushuang did not care at all as long as his daughter liked it.

From that day on, Jian Wushuang also taught Bei Yi to comprehend the axe principle.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed. He waved his hand and said, “Xuan ‘Er, Bei Yi, you two go to the side first. Your Uncle Xuan ‘Er is here.”

“Uncle Xuan ‘Er?” Jian Xuan ‘Er was delighted.

She was Jian Wushuang’s daughter, which was equivalent to the princess of the entire Divine Beginning Realm. The leaders of the Divine Beginning Realm, such as Daoist Xuan ‘Er and Temporal Temple Master, all doted on Jian Xuan ‘Er.

Soon, Daoist Xuan God appeared in the manor, accompanied by another person.

“Master Chenyun?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Greetings, Master Blood Sword.” Master Chenyun stood in front of Jian Wushuang, looking extremely humble.

During the battle 36,000 years ago, Master Chenyun had been watching from the surrounding void and had witnessed everything.

He saw Jian Wushuang break through to become a Ruler, attract the arrival of universal principles, and then kill Star Demon Ancestor with lightning speed.

Later, he found out that Jian Wushuang had taken over the Divine Beginning Realm.

After all, Jian Wushuang had comprehended a trace of universal principles at the level of Principles Master, and he was a special life form. Just these two points alone made him an incredible genius with immeasurable potential, the Nine Emperor Pavilion valued him very much.

But later, Jian Wushuang took over another star world? His potential was even greater and more terrifying.

Even the higher-ups of the Nine Emperor Pavilion personally ordered him to try his best to befriend Jian Wushuang. Clearly, the Nine Emperor Pavilion valued Jian Wushuang, the super genius, more than before.
