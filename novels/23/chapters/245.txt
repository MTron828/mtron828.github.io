Chapter 246: On the Heartless Island

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Triple-kill Sword had already been a superior third-grade magic weapon since its sword spirit awakened. Since then, he had killed five experts of Yin-Yang Void Realm from the Nine Emperors Sect, the Exceptional Yang Void Realm Ku Ya, as well his killed many in a several-day successive massacre directed towards Blood Feather Tower stronghold.

In the wake of the numerous massacres, the Triple-kill Sword had become more ruthless. One step further and it would become a magic weapon of the second grade. In the following days, he would continue the bloodbath in the strongholds of Blood Feather Tower.

One by one with each endless kill, the frantic bloodbath would strengthen the power of Triple-kill Sword.

On the eve before the 18th of the twelfth month of the lunar year, the Triple-kill Sword made a breakthrough, leveling itself up from a superior third grade to an inferior second grade and strengthening its power.

Thereafter, Jian Wushuang had prepared all that he could, including his personal strength.

For the entirety of that night, he quietly sat on a hill.

The next morning, the sun had not yet risen on the horizon, but heavy snow fell from the sky.

Soon, the heavy snow covered the ground in a white sheet.

After sitting on the hill for a whole night, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, filled with light.

“It’s snowing.” Jian Wushuang stretched out one hand and a snowflake fell onto his palm. Soon after, it turned into a drop of water.

“The snow is beautiful.” Jian Wushuang looked around with a smile. “The snow would be more charming if it was mixed with blood!”

“My dear, today, let us enjoy a bloodbath!”

It seemed the Triple-kill Sword understood what Jian Wushuang said, and it trembled fiercely on his back.

As though it was excited. As though it was surprised!

Jian Wushuang set off to Heartless Island.

On the 18th of the twelfth lunar month, it snowed heavily.

The whole Tianzong Dynasty was covered by white snow, causing the ground to become a vast and endless white sheet.

Heartless Island was located 100 miles away from the imperial palace of the Tianzong Dynasty. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Situated in the center of a vast lake and surrounded by hills, Heartless Island was famous in Tianzong Dynasty.

It was said that the place where the Heartless Island was located was once a rift. Years ago, two super experts had a fierce fight there and left a huge ravine in the ground, which water gathered into and formed a lake. This left the central piece of land to turn into an island.

Today, the atmosphere in the Heartless Island was different. Many figures stood at nearly every corner of the island, and they all wore black robes and masks. Not only that, but all of the masks were golden.

Above the void, some purple-masked killers from Blood Feather Tower welcomed the experts and also acted as guardians watching over all of them.

In other words, one could say that the entirety of Heartless Island was now heavily guarded.

At dawn, experts from different sects arrived on the island.

One month ago, Blood Feather Tower had sent its invitations. All of the sects who received the invitations did not dare refuse and all sent their experts.

The seven top clans in the Tianzong Dynasty, even Dragon Palace, and the Gladiator arena, all had their experts go forth.

Soon many experts gathered on the island and there was quite a clamor.

There was a big drill ground in the center of the island. Many chairs were arranged in rows on two sides of the Drill Ground. Experts from all of the sects of Tianzong Dynasty were sitting on their chairs quietly.

“Brother Ling Feng, how was it decided that we from the Tianyuan Sword Sect were to sit here?”

At a corner of the Drill Ground’s very edge, experts of Tianyuan Sword Sect were seated. Among the nearly 10 experts, there was one lady with a cold expression on her face. She was Jian Meng’er, and her current expression was strange.

“The Tianyuan Sword Sect is a big sect in Tianyan Province, but it is nothing special in the Tianzong Dynasty. It’s an honor to be invited by Blood Feather Tower, even if you’re seated at the corner.” Ling Feng explained.

“Is it?” Jian Meng’er still frowned.

“Ling Feng,” The Sect Master of Tianyuan Sword Sect, an elder with white hair and a baby-face, turned and said to Ling Feng, “it’s the highest-level meeting in the Tianzong Dynasty and all the experts of those strong sects have come. Later on, I’ll introduce you to them to expand your knowledge.”

“Thank you.” Ling Feng nodded respectfully.

In the most conspicuous area of the Drill Ground, 10 figures were seated. Among them, the lead one was a strong man over two meters high and as strong as an ox. He was the hall master of the Gladiator Arena.

“What I’m most looking forward to with this gathering is Jian Wushuang. When will he show up?” The strong man looked around and smiled. “I’m quite curious about the exceptional genius.”

“Bai Chong, I heard you knew him?” The strong man looked over at an armless middle-aged man.

Jian Wushuang would recognize him as soon as he saw the middle-aged man. He was Bai Chong, who once gave him a lucky opportunity when he was in the mansion of the Sword Marquis and saved him from the killers of Blood Feather Tower.

Hearing what the strong man said, Bai Chong couldn’t help but touch his left sleeve.

His left arm was cut off while stopping the killers of Blood Feather Tower for Jian Wushuang. However, he didn’t give up because of this, but rather fought against it and he unexpectedly broke through the bottleneck that had always trapped him, reaching Yin Void Realm.

“A little,” Bai Chong replied.

“Hehe, I really admire him. If he can survive this time, introduce him to me,” The strong man said with a smile.

“Okay.” Bai Chong nodded, but then he frowned.

He knew that the danger Jian Wushuang was facing this time was no small matter.

Blood Feather Tower had set a trap and had extensively prepared in order to kill Jian Wushuang.

On the Drill Ground, apart from the experts of the sects, there were also many solitary experts who had come without invitation simply for the enjoyment.

Among the solitary experts, there was one gentleman with a long sword on his back.

He was the master of the Mansion of the Sword Marquis, Jian Xinhong!

One month ago, he had heard that Blood Feather Tower was inviting experts of all sects to watch the sacrifice of Jian Nantian to the Heavens, and that Jian Wushuang had replied as well.

Therefore, as a solitary expert, he had rushed over today.

“Blood Feather Tower... they were the overlords of the Tianzong Dynasty. I also heard that their Tower Master had reached Divine Transcendence.” Jian Xinhong had a grave expression on his face, then he shook his head. “Eh, God bless him.”
