Chapter 3178: 290 Years

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

_________

Jian Wushuang stayed on the time-space island and cultivated with the help of the many resources on the island.

Time passed quickly, and in a flash, 290 years had passed.

Beside the lake.

“Temple Master Bai Xing.” A black-clothed elder stood beside Temple Master Bai Xing with a hint of respect between his brows. He said, “The 100,000-year deadline has passed. In another 10 years, the Blood Wave Realm will reopen.”

“Blood Wave Realm?” Palace Master Bai Xing pondered for a moment. “The opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm are equivalent to a shortcut to the Principles Master. Every time the Blood Wave Realm opens, there will be a large number of top-notch Invincible Saints heading over. Our Temporal Temple will have five spots to enter the Blood Wave Realm as usual. Have you chosen these five spots?”

“I’ve already chosen them.” The black-robed elder nodded, then handed a list to Temple Master Bai Xing.

After taking it, Temple Master Bai Xing began to browse through it carefully.

“Di Hao, he should be the strongest among the many Invincible Saints that our Temporal Temple had first. It’s only natural that he would enter the Blood Wave Realm.”

“Qian Hongzi is an Invincible Saint with extraordinary potential. If he obtains the opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm, his chances of becoming a Principles Master would definitely exceed 90% . It wouldn’t be a problem.”

…

Palace Master Bai Xing browsed through the names on the list one by one.

Palace Master Bai Xing agreed with the first four names on the list until the last name.

“Duan Lang?” Palace Master Bai Xing frowned slightly. “Although Duan Lang has some talent, his strength is still lacking, right?”

“Well…” The black-clothed old man said in a low voice, “Duan Lang’s strength is now infinitely close to that of an Invincible Saint. He is indeed weaker than the other four, but no one else seems to be more suitable than him to enter the Blood Wave Realm.”

There were indeed not many cultivators in the Temporal Temple, but there were actually some Invincible Saints in the Temporal Temple.

However, most of the Invincible Immortal Saints in the Temporal Temple had exhausted their potential. Even if they got the opportunity in the blood wave realm, the chance of becoming a Principles Master was very low, these Invincible Immortal Saints were naturally not suitable to enter the Blood Wave Realm.

Therefore, the black-clothed elder carefully selected Duan Lang and felt that he was more suitable.

“Among the Immortal Saints of the Temporal Temple, no one is more suitable to enter the Blood Wave Realm than Duan Lang, except for Di Hao and the other three? Haha, I don’t think so,” Temple Master Bai Xing said with a mysterious smile, “didn’t Ba Cang bring a little guy back to our Temporal Temple 290 years ago?”

“You mean Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The black-clothed elder was stunned.

The black-clothed elder was also a high-level official of the Temporal Temple. He was in charge of many things in the Temporal Temple, so he naturally knew about Jian Wushuang.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed very talented, but 290 years ago, when he first came to the Temporal Temple, he was only a rank four True Saint. His battle strength was only around rank seven True Saint. Now, only 290 years have passed. Even if he has made great progress with the help of the many opportunities on the temporal island, there is still a limit to how fast he can improve. In such a short time, his strength should not be comparable to Duan Lang, right?” The black-clothed elder said.

“I can’t say for sure.” Palace Master Bai Xing smiled. “I’ve been paying attention to Heavenly Sword Marquis ever since he entered my Temporal Temple. I’ve seen his progress in the past 290 years. When he first came to my temporal island 290 years ago, he challenged the heavenly bridge once, but he could only pass the 24th level.

“But after cultivating on our spacetime island for more than 200 years, which is three years ago, he already passed the 29th level!”

“What?” The black-robed elder was shocked. “From the 24th level to the 29th level? In less than 300 years, he actually passed the fifth level? How is this possible?”

“It’s a bit unbelievable, but it’s the truth,” Palace Master Bai Xing said, “he has passed the 29th level, which means his comprehension of the space-time principles has reached the fourth stage and he has mastered teleportation. This level has surpassed the level of a rank seven True Saint and is comparable to those Immortal Saints who are infinitely close to the invincible level!”

“As for his own realm, he has made great progress in the past 290 years. As far as I know, his current realm has broken through to the level of a rank six True Saint.”

“Rank six True Saint Realm?” The black-clothed elder’s pupils constricted.

290 years ago, when Jian Wushuang first came to the time-space Island, he was only a rank four Peak True Saint, but now he was already a rank six True Saint.

In other words, he had broken through two realms in less than 300 years.

“How can he improve so fast?” The black-clothed elder could not understand.

“It’s nothing strange. He is a super genius. As far as I know, he spent 50 years on the first floor of the Temporal Tower. The time flow there is 10 times slower. In other words, he stayed in the Temporal Tower for 500 years. With the help of some treasures, his understanding of the principles and Dao has long exceeded his realm. It’s normal for him to break through to rank six True Saint,” Temple Master Bai Xing said. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No wonder.” The black-clothed elder also understood.

In just 290 years, Jian Wushuang had made such great progress in the space-time principles and made such a great breakthrough in his realm. Of course, he would find it incredible.

However, if Jian Wushuang had stayed in the Temporal Tower for 500 years, he would have broken through two realms in 500 years.

“290 years ago, before Heavenly Sword Marquis came to my Temporal Tower, he was able to kill a rank seven True Saint with the strength of a rank four True Saint. Now, he has reached the level of a rank six True Saint and with the help of the divine power fruit, he has reached the limit of a rank six True Saint. His comprehension of the principles has allowed him to pass the 29th level of the Heavenly Bridge. How strong do you think he is now?” Temple Master Bai Xing asked with a smile.

“I’m afraid he won’t be weaker than Duan Lang,” the black-robed elder said in a low voice.

When he was a rank four True Saint, he could kill a rank seven True Saint directly.

Now that he had reached the limit of rank six and his comprehension of the principles had improved so much, his strength had definitely surpassed that of a rank seven True Saint. He might not be comparable to a True Invincible Saint, but he should be very close.

“That’s it.” Palace Master Bai Xing continued. “In terms of talent, Heavenly Sword Marquis is much stronger than Duan Lang. Now that Heavenly Sword Marquis’s strength can keep up, this last spot is naturally reserved for Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

“Palace Master Bai Xing is right.” The black-robed elder nodded. Clearly, he agreed.

Opportunities were always for those who were capable. The spot to enter the Blood Wave Realm was the same.
