Chapter 2474: First-Ranked Genius?

All those experts on the glade held their breath.

All eyes were on Tu Qiancheng.

Under the huge surge of vicious energy, the battle blade was completely unsheathed from Tu Qiancheng’s back.

Boom!

A strong bolt of blade essence rose in an instant.

Tu Qiancheng’s body moved.

Whoosh!

A flash of crimson light suddenly appeared in the void.

That crimson light seemed like a scarlet mist flowing in the air, but in fact, it was a flash of crimson-colored blade-light.

The blade-light destroyed everything in its way as it slashed open space, Heaven, and Earth.

All of those many experts around showed expressions of surprise and fear when they saw that crimson-colored blade-light.

“Is this the capabilities of Wusha Wilderness’s top genius?”

“Too strong, he’s way too strong. Nobody can withstand this strike of his.”

“Blade principle at full completion. Tu Qiancheng’s understanding of the blade principle has reached the level of full completion. His techniques are even scarier. This strike alone is enough to easily destroy any Peak Divine Demon.”

“He’s Tu Qiancheng in the end. After years of inactivity, the moment he makes a move is shocking, to say the least.”

Even many Peak Divine Demons from different sects exclaimed in awe when they saw the crimson-colored blade-light.

That stroke was truly terrifying.

It also truly possessed the powers to kill Peak Divine Demons.

There were many Peak Divine Demons from different sects, but only a handful of them who could probably withstand that attack.

“Senior Brother Qiancheng, THIS is Senior Brother Qiancheng’s true ability. Jian Wushuang is doomed. He’s done for, for sure!” Long Zishan started to growl quietly. He was incredibly excited and looked at Tu Qiancheng with full admiration.

However, Jian Wushuang’s facial expression remained the same while he watched the crimson-colored blade-light tearing through the air and sweeping towards him.

He was not in a hurry to strike back. Instead, he was allowing the blade-light to close in on him.

“He’s still not taking action, is this Jian Wushuang stupid or something?”

“That can’t be it. We’ve seen his battle strength in Saint’s Tomb. Even if he wasn’t good enough to withstand Tu Qiancheng, he could at least endure for a while instead of being unable to strike back at all.”

“What exactly is this kid planning to do?”

All the sects’ experts could not understand Jian Wushuang’s actions as it was extremely strange.

“Did he give up?” Tu Qiancheng’s eyes were like lightning as he pressed on with infinite viciousness against Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang began to strike right when Tu Qiancheng thought his attacks would sweep him and break his body apart.

His move was not fast nor furious as he merely extended his hand and casually grabbed at the front.

Twang!

A noise that sounded like colliding metal tore through the air.

The terrifying crimson-colored blade-light faded in the blink of an eye.

A crimson-colored battle blade appeared in the void. The most incredible part was the hand that had tightly grabbed the tip of the blade’s edge. An immense strength came from the hand which locked the crimson-colored battle blade in place just like a clam.

“What?” Tu Qiancheng was dumbfounded.

Everyone else around did too.

Long Zishan, who was shouting in frenzy with fanatical admiration towards Tu Qiancheng just a second ago was also dumbfounded.

The entire world seemed to have become quiet for a short moment.

Until the owner of the hand, Jian Wushuang, slowly raised his head and smiled at Tu Qiancheng. “Is this the ability which you’re so proud of and relied on to make me kill myself?”

There was a trace of ridicule in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He stood right where he was with one hand folded at his back and the other hand holding Tu Qiancheng’s battle blade tightly. No matter how hard Tu Qiancheng tried, he could not shake the blade off Jian Wushuang’s grip.

“How is that possible?” Tu Qiancheng was completely puzzled.

Just moments ago, he had sworn in front of everyone that he wanted to make Jian Wushuang kill himself.

He ultimately made the strike himself and gave all he had to display his most mesmerizing strike.

He had used that very same strike which killed off quite a few Peak Divine Demons.

However, Jian Wushuang simply stopped Tu Qiancheng attack single-handedly and the crux was he had grabbed onto that battle blade with only his bare hand!

But how?

Not only Tu Qiancheng but everyone who witnessed it could not believe what they saw.

However, Jian Wushuang only pursed his lips and said, “I thought the first-ranked genius in Wusha Wilderness was something special, but now that I’ve met him, he’s just so-so.”

Jian Wushuang attacked as soon as he finished speaking. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

His right hand was still holding onto Tu Qiancheng’s battle blade, which Tu Qiancheng could not shake off. His body dashed forward while the index finger of his other hand turned into a lightning bolt and shot outward.

His finger attack was so swift that nobody could possibly react to it.

“Qiancheng, fall back now!”

Hanyun from the Great Compassion Sect shouted sternly as he quickly warned Tu Qiancheng.

Tu Qiancheng also realized what was happening and let go of his battle blade before violently shooting his body backward, hoping to avoid the finger attack.

Suddenly, however...

Sheesh!

The finger attack speed suddenly sped up and shot through Tu Qiancheng’s skull in a flash.

Tu Qiancheng’s eyes were wide open with his face still in disbelief, but his life had already ended.

Woosh!

Tu Qiancheng’s lifeless body fell vertically towards the ground.

“Qiancheng!” Hanyun and the few Peak Divine Demon Elders of the Great Compassion Sect looked extremely horrified.

“Senior Brother Qiancheng.” Long Zishan and Yu Aoqing were also extremely terrified.

As for the experts from other sects, their shocked feelings were clearly shown on their faces.

Nobody would have ever expected that Tu Qiancheng, the formerly first-ranked genius of Wusha Wilderness, who had already broken through to Peak Divine Demon realm would die from a mere frontal attack by Jian Wushuang, despite taking action and displaying his strongest ability.

Jian Wushuang’s swift killer move had not given Tu Qiancheng any chance to struggle or escape.

“Die, boy!”

An angry voice filled the void, the few Peak Divine Demon elders from the Great Compassion Sect were so furious that their faces turned plum red. Their eyes were bloodshot as they released surging waves of killing intent.

Following Hanyun’s enraged roar, the Great Compassion Sect’s four Peak Divine Demon elders dashed towards Jian Wushuang at the same time.

Just when they were attacking...

“Let’s go as well!”

“That’s right, let’s do it together and destroy this dreadful creature!”

“Kill him!”

On the glade, experts from sects which lost many disciples to Jian Wushuang violently dashed forward.

All of the experts attack Jian Wushuang in unison without any hesitation.

Previously, they did not know Jian Wushuang had once again advanced his abilities. They thought that Tu Qiancheng alone could suppress or even kill him, hence they did not attack together.

However, Tu Qiancheng was instantly killed, and only now did they realize Jian Wushuang’s abilities were obviously beyond their imagination.

They had to attack together in order to kill Jian Wushuang.
