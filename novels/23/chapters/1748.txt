Chapter 1749: Endless Trouble In The Future

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two rays of brilliant golden light stopped beside Jian Wushuang and they were the two Hong Jun Golden Swords. The two Hong Jun Golden Swords were emitting an infinite amount of cold light and it looked as if they could attack any time.

“If you wish to fight with me, you had better be prepared to die,” Jian Wushuang was filled with a great amount of murderous intent.

Upon seeing the two Hong Jun Golden Swords, the corners of Sir God Qian Lan’s mouth became distorted.

Back then, in the Eighth Lair, Jian Wushuang had used one Hong Jun Golden Sword to suppress him. At present, there were two of them…

“This Jian Wushuang, could it be that he was not injured at all?” Sir God Qian Lan started to hesitate. However, his expression changed abruptly, “No, that’s wrong. If he was not injured, he would definitely not say any unnecessary things to me. Instead, he would control the two Hong Jun Swords to kill me right away!”

“Even though he did not do it straight away, he still took out the two golden swords. Hence, is he making an empty show of strength in order to intimidate me?”

After Sir God Qian Lan thought to himself and understood what was going on, an enormous amount of flames of fury appeared in his eyes.

He was almost intimidated by Jian Wushuang for real.

“Little kid, die!”

Sir God Qian Lan gave a furious roar and the crimson rod in his hands swept past the area abruptly.

Countless crimson waves appeared in the void at once. They then swept past the area and gathered to form a gigantic crimson rod shadow that was hundreds of feet wide instantly.

The crimson red shadow was extremely huge and it attacked Jian Wushuang immediately.

“Oh no!” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed at once.

Sir God Qian Lan’s guess was right. He was indeed making an empty show of strength and his objective was to get the people in front of him to retreat in the face of difficulty.

As for fighting for real… his injuries were really too serious and he probably could not even unleash ten percent of his abilities. Moreover, his Divine Power was almost completely depleted as well.

In such a state, even a Chaotic Real God could serve as a threat to him, let alone Sir God Qian Lan.

Seeing the crimson rod shadow was heading toward him, Jian Wushuang used his full power at once and controlled one Hong Jun Golden Sword to attack.

The Hong Jun Golden Sword unleashed an impressive amount of power and clashed with the rod shadow head-on with lightning speed.

Bam!

With a loud sound, the Hong Jun Golden Sword moved at an even faster speed. As for Jian Wushuang, his body shook vigorously and he spit out three mouthfuls of blood in succession. His aura, which was already extremely weak to begin with, fell to rock bottom at that moment.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, you are really making an empty show of strength!”

Upon seeing that, Sir God Qian Lan laughed loudly and his eyes became filled with a vast amount of murderous intent.

“Damn it!” Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth tightly.

In the Buddhist Demon Sea, he had experienced four waves of attacks from the Acheron Palace successively and he even fought a fight to the death with Emperor God Xue Gu. Later on, he was attacked by the ancient flood dragon. And finally, he had escaped by the skin of his teeth. However, he totally did not expect himself to actually encounter the experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace next!

Sir God Qian Lan was merely a normal Sir God. If Jian Wushuang were at his peak, he could kill him easily. However, at present… a man who had lost his position and influence was subjected to indignity!

“The assassination by the Acheron Palace as well as the flood dragon have been unable to kill me. Hence, how can I die in the hands of the Soaring Heaven King Palace?” Jian Wushuang roared within his heart and the remaining Divine Power in his body emerged again.

“Jian Wushuang, stop acting tough. Leave Sir God Qian Lan to me and run away quickly!” a deep voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind abruptly. At the same time, the skin on Jian Wushuang’s body also started to wriggle madly.

“King of Venomous Worms?” Jian Wushuang’s heart became disturbed, “Sir God Qian Lan is a Sir God expert. Can you take care of him by yourself?”

“With my current abilities, although I am not an opponent for Sir God Qian Lan, I can still keep him busy for a period of time. During this period of time, you must run as far away as possible. As for me, there’s no need for you to worry. The life force of a Full-foot Plenilune is so strong that it is beyond your expectations. Hence, a mere Sir God will be unable to kill me!”

As soon as his words left his mouth, countless tentacles came out of Jian Wushuang’s body. The King of Venomous Worms’ huge body also appeared in the void again.

Rustle!!!

The countless tentacles were like flittering lights and they headed toward Sir God Qian Lan with lightning speed, stopping him in his tracks as a result.

“What the hell is this?” Sir God Qian Lan revealed a stunned expression. However, even more anger emerged from him.

“Piss off!”

Boom!

With a loud sound, the huge crimson rod shadow destroyed hundreds of tentacles instantly. Some of its power also spread to the King of Venomous Worms’ body, causing the King of Venomous Worms to groan. However, at the next moment, even more tentacles attacked madly.

“King of Venomous Worms, I shall leave this to you!” Jian Wushuang looked at the King of Venomous Worms deeply and his eyes glowed with a shrill light.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace, I, Jian Wushuang, shall remember the debt today!”

“In the future, if I don’t eliminate the Soaring Heaven King Palace, my name, Jian Wushuang, will be written in reverse order!”

“Just wait and see!!!”

Jian Wushuang’s ice-cold voice resounded across the universe. He had already made use of his remaining Divine Power to escape quickly.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang was running away, Sir God Qian Lan as well as Real God Han Quan and Real God Ying Yun, who were both behind him, wanted to give chase. However, they were stopped by the King of Venomous Worms. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Damn it. Where did this worm beast come from? Since you wish to die, I shall grant you your wish!”

Murderous intent sprang up in Sir God Qian Lan. The power of his crimson rod then rose greatly and many rod shadows attacked the King of Venomous Worms crazily.

After undergoing a transformation, the King of Venomous Worms had awakened his close-quarters combat abilities. Moreover, it was a Full-foot Plenilune. Hence, it could just about serve as a threat to a normal Almighty. However, after the successive great battles in the Buddhist Demon Sea, the King of Venomous Worms did not get off with light injuries either. At present, his abilities had not recovered to their peak. Furthermore, he was fighting with Sir God Qian Lan alone. Therefore, he would definitely be in a huge disadvantage.

However, as his body was enormous and that his life force was exuberant, he only started to escape after fighting with Sir God Qian Lan for close to a quarter of an hour’s time.

Sir God Qian Lan had also given chase for a long time. However, he still allowed the King of Venomous Worms to get away in the end.

At a dark void in the Sixth Lair, Sir God Qian Lan, Real God Han Quan and Sir God Ying Yun were gathered together. In addition, they had ugly expressions.

“We have actually missed this golden opportunity!!” Sir God Qian Lan clenched both his fists tightly and he was filled with dissatisfaction.

“It’s all thanks to that worm beast from before. If not for it obstructing us, Jian Wushuang would definitely have died,” Real God Han Quan snorted coldly.

“The worm beast from before was very frightening,” Real God Ying Yun said with a low voice.

It was very frightening.

Moreover, it was not just frightening in terms of its close-quarters combat abilities. Most importantly, it had a frightening life force and ability to recover.

With such a suppression by Sir God Qian Lan where he injured the worm beast continuously, he still had not managed to kill the worm beast. Instead, he could only look on as it escaped in the end.

“That worm beast merely has a powerful life force. However, this is not important. The most important thing is… Jian Wushuang!!!” Sir God Qian Lan squinted his eyes.

“This time around, we attacked him when he was seriously injured. If we had managed to kill him, then there would be no problem. However, since he’s not dead, the Soaring Heaven King Palace will have endless trouble in the future!!”
