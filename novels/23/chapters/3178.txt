“Of course, what I just said is only my guess for the time being. Whether the true strength of the Heavenly Sword Marquis is equal to or stronger than Duan Lang is still uncertain. For the sake of the opportunity, countless top Immortal Saints in the Blood Wave Realm fought fiercely and killed crazily. If the Heavenly Sword Marquis’s strength doesn’t meet the requirements, he naturally doesn’t have the qualifications to enter.”

“So…before the final quota is determined, I have to test this little guy’s real strength.”

Temple Master Bai Xing smiled, his eyes flashing with a strange luster.

…

In the True Martial Mystic Realm on the time-space island.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged under an iceberg, his consciousness completely immersed in the image of the iceberg.

In the image, a white-clothed figure seemed to be transparent, flickering randomly in the void.

In the blink of an eye, his figure constantly appeared in every corner of the void.

It was obvious that the owner of the iceberg, the Principles Master, had left behind a movement technique.

This movement technique was very strange, and its use of the power of time and space was unfathomable. Every flicker of his was completely integrated with the surrounding space and time.

“The power of time and space is self-integrated with the space and time?”

“So that’s how it is?”

Jian Wushuang had been carefully watching the flashing white-clothed figure in the picture, but many insights had emerged in his heart. On the space-time rule, the difficult problem that had been troubling him for a long time was gradually solved. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In a flash, more than half a day had passed.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, and a fierce light suddenly flashed in them.

“The fourth stage of the space-time principles has been completed!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, and there was an uncontrollable ecstasy in his heart.

The fourth stage, yes, his comprehension of the space-time principles had only reached the fourth stage, which was also the last stage of the space-time principles. If he took another step, he would completely comprehend the space-time principles, he would become the master of the space-time principles.

When Temple Master Bai Xing knew that Jian Wushuang had passed the 29th level of the Heavenly Bridge, he had said that his comprehension of the space-time principles had reached the fourth stage immediately. But now, it seemed that he had not!

Temple Master Bai Xing did not know that Jian Wushuang had passed the 29th level because his comprehension of the space-time principles was very close to the fourth stage. The most important thing was his swordsmanship!

In the past 290 years, with the help of the many resources on the time-space island, especially the scenes in the True Martial Mystic Realm, his strength had improved by leaps and bounds, and his comprehension of the space-time principles had greatly increased. At the same time, his swordsmanship had also improved! It was his swordsmanship!

His swordsmanship had made great strides and even made a breakthrough.

Because of this, his swordsmanship combined with his comprehension of the space-time principles was able to pass the 29th level of the Heavenly Bridge.

“Now that I’ve entered the fourth stage of space-time principles, my strength has soared again. If I combine my swordsmanship, I might even pass the 30th level of the Heavenly Bridge.” Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised.

In addition, as soon as he reached the fourth stage, he naturally mastered teleportation. He could also comprehend the third move of the space-time divine skill, space-time teleportation, in the secret skill pavilion.

Buzz!

A figure suddenly appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang turned his head. When he saw the person, he immediately bowed respectfully and said, “Temple Master Bai Xing.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, judging from your pleasant surprise just now, you seem to have gained something big again?” Temple Master Bai Xing looked at Jian Wushuang.

“A little.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

“It’s indeed a good thing to have gained something, but do you still remember what I told you 290 years ago?”Temple Master Bai Xing said, “I told you to cultivate well and improve your strength as soon as possible. Maybe you can catch up with the event 300 years later.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. Of course, he remembered what Temple Master Bai Xing said.

However, he did not know what Temple Master Bai Xing was referring to at that time.

“300 years, and now 290 years have passed. Temple Master Bai Xing, is that why you came here today?” Jian Wushuang was looking forward to it.

“Yes.” Temple Master Bai Xing smiled. “The thing I’m talking about is the Blood Wave Realm!”

“Blood Wave Realm?” Jian Wushuang frowned. Obviously, he had never heard of it.

“The Blood Wave Realm is an extremely unique secret realm of heaven and earth in the Divine Beginning Realm. It was created by an extremely ancient super expert. There are opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm. These opportunities are only useful to the Immortal Saint, and they are enough to make any Immortal Saint go crazy,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Enough to drive any Immortal Saint crazy?

What kind of status and strength did Temple Master Bai Xing have?

Since he dared to say so, he must have his reasons. The opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm must be extraordinary.

“However, the Blood Wave Realm only opens once every 100,000 years. Every time it opens, only the Immortal Saint is qualified to enter. As for the Principles Master, he is completely excluded from the Blood Wave Realm. Every time the Blood Wave Realm opens, the sects of the Divine Beginning World will send their top Immortal Saints into it. There are also many independent Immortal Saints who can enter the Blood Wave Realm through some means.”

“As for the Temporal Temple, it’s one of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning Realm. Although there aren’t many cultivators, we still have five slots to enter the Blood Wave Realm. Ten years later, the Blood Wave Realm will open again. Now, the Temporal Temple is selecting five people to enter the Blood Wave Realm. We’ve already decided on four, but there’s still one more slot.” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Temple Master Bai Xing, do you mean I can fight for the last spot?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Temple Master Bai Xing nodded. “As expected, the last spot will be decided between you and Duan Lang, another genius expert of the spacetime temple. Duan Lang is not only extremely talented, but his battle strength is also infinitely close to that of an Invincible Saint. But you…you have terrifying talent and great potential, which is not a problem. However, no one knows how strong your battle strength is, so I came here personally.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, here is a scroll. Take a look.”

Temple Master Bai Xing said and threw a scroll to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the scroll, opened it and read it carefully.

When he finished reading the contents of the scroll, his expression became extremely strange.

“Experiential mission?”

“Kill 13 axes?”
