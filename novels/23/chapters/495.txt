Chapter 496: Crazy Messaging

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Haha, Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion!”

Su Ming crazily laughed without scruple.

Jian Wushuang was frightened.

In the Ancestor’s Land, he asked Jin Ling about the third test, but Jin Ling just said that she only knew it was related to a big secret!

Now he realized that the big secret was the cause of Sword Ancestor’s death.

“What does he want to do?” Jian Nantian appeared beside his son.

Jian Nantian remained deadlocked with Marquis Xuefeng, but?when he noticed something happening here, Jian Nantian came over.

“I don’t know, but it can’t be anything good,” Blind Emperor replied coldly.

Su Ming stopped laughing. His expression became ferocious with a gush of craziness in his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang, Blind Emperor, and Jian Nantian.”

Su Ming looked at them. “Have you experienced desperation?”

Jian Wushuang’s complexion changed slightly.

Jian Nantian was shocked.

Desperation?

“Hey hey, it’s all right if you haven’t because you will be experiencing it soon.

“Like Sword Ancestor, you will know what real desperation is. I will give you a taste of being targeted by the whole world,” Su Ming said with a grim smile as he flipped his hand over.

A dozen Messaging Slips appeared in his hands. After he tore one of them, a blurry image appeared.

“Haha, Holy Ancestor, you have been looking for the location of the Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion, right? I found it!”

The blurry figure showed a surprised expression and spoke in a sonorous voice. “I’ll come immediately.”

The blurry figure disappeared. Then Su Ming tore the second Messaging Slip.

“Spirit Ancestor, I have some information about the Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion. Whether you come is up to you.”

The message was sent. Then he turned to the third Messaging Slip.

“Stone Ancestor, I received news on the Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion.”

“Blood Bladesman, I know the whereabouts of that thing you want.”

“Bagu Cave Master, you’re still in closed-door cultivation? If you don’t exit, the thing you want will fall into someone else’s hands.”

“Dong Ming King...”

Su Ming tore the Messaging Slips and sent all the messages.

The first three messages were to the Three Ancestors in the Divine Land.

As for the other messages, such as Blood Bladesman, Bagu Cave Master, and Dong Ming King, many Sword Principle experts present, including Blind Emperor, had not heard of them.

“We’re in big trouble!”

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian both looked at each other with a horrible expression.

They knew that they would become the experts’ targets if Sword Ancestor’s death was really related to that thing.

“Not good, Jian Nantian, leave with your son right now. I’ll block Su Ming.” Blind Emperor spoke seriously.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang retreated with his father without hesitation.

“You want to leave?” Su Ming sneered as he moved to give chase.

Shua!

The space before Su Ming suddenly split. A cold sword shadow appeared and pointed at his throat, blocking his way.

“Hum, you think that if you block me they can escape? Zizhong.” Su Ming shouted.

Marquis Zizhong, who had retreated far off in the distance, nodded and started to chase Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian.

Marquis Xuefeng followed them.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang turned pale.

The two marquises were weaker than him. Though they were unable to catch up with their targets, Marquis Zizhong was smart as he did not plan to fight with them, only to keep following his targets.

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian could not shake them off. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“We’re in trouble.” Jian Nantian, who had been indifferent to everything, wore a solemn look.

Now they were at an extreme disadvantage.

The experts who received the messages responded one by one.

In an ancient forest, there were numerous palaces and pavilions. On top of a mountain, a beautiful pavilion with nine floors stood.

A white-robed elder sat on a chair on the top floor, flicking through a book.

He looked mild, yet he also looked as if he had experienced many of the vicissitudes of life.

After receiving Su Ming’s message, the white-robed elder stood up with a grim expression.

“Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion has finally been found?”

The white-robed elder suppressed his excitement as he tore a Space-travel Spell and stepped into the wormhole.

On a small island, which was situated in the center of lake, there was a simple thatched cottage.

A graceful purple-clothed woman sat by a stone table while playing Go by herself in the delicate thatched cottage.

Suddenly, Su Ming’s message arrived.

“Spirit Ancestor, I have some information about the Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion. Whether you come or not is up to you.”

The purple-clothed woman stopped her hand. The next moment, she stood up and looked up towards the sky.

“Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion, that old guy’s cave mansion...”

The purple-clothed woman wore a complicated look.

In an ordinary city, an old beggar lay in the corner of the street, as if he would die of starvation and coldness at any moment.

He looked inconspicuous.

Suddenly, Su Ming’s message arrived.

“Blood Bladesman, I know the whereabouts of that thing you want.”

The old bagger suddenly woke up.

His eyes looked as sharp as a blade, radiating a sliver of light.

“Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion!”

“For that thing, I, Blood Bladesman, have lived here for thousands of years. Finally, I’ll learn of its whereabouts!”
