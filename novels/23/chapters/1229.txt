Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Inside the Battle Fortress, many of the strongest people in the Green Fire World scattered in all corners, and the atmosphere was extremely dull and desperate. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this time, many Palace Masters, including Jian Wushuang, hurried out from a towering temple. These Palace Masters all looked a little excited.

Green Fire World Celestial Masters and Dao Masters saw them on the way.

“Where are they hurrying to?”

“Have you noticed that they all seem a little excited?”

“Yes, they do.”

“Have they come up with other methods of breaking the Formation, is there still hope for us?”

“Very likely, otherwise they wouldn’t have been so excited.”

The entire Battle Fortress quickly became noisy.

Many Celestial Masters and Dao Masters followed the Palace Masters and rushed to the center of the Battle Fortress.

In an open space, several figures stood there, including Jian Wushuang’s two Senior Brothers, Xue Lingtian and Bai Hu. At the center, a friendly-looking white-robed man stood. He looked elegant and easygoing.

“Is that Jian Wushuang’s master?”

Palace Masters all fixed their gazes on the white-robed man.

At the moment when they saw the white-robed men, they had a strange feeling.

His aura was only in Eternal Realm and seemingly ordinary, but for some reason, they felt something strange.

“Master!”

Jian Wushuang came to the white-robed man and respectfully bowed.

“Xuan Yi Master!”

Samsara Temple Master, along with many Palace Masters, bowed to the white-robed man with respect.

They also learned the name Xuan Yi from Jian Wushuang.

They saluted as well… Even if his strength was not that mighty, such a profound master deserved to be respected.

Moreover, Xuan Yi was the Green Fire World’s last hope.

“Get up.” Xuan Yi waved at Jian Wushuang, looked at Samsara Temple Master and others, then he laughed. “You can all get up, I don’t deserve it.”

“Master, you came today for the Enduring Samsara Formation, is that right?” Jian Wushuang asked directly.

“Yes.” Xuan Yi faintly nodded. “I told you the method of breaking the Formation, and I thought that you can crush the Enduring Samsara Formation with it. But you actually failed. So, I have to come by myself.”

“You mean, there are other ways to break it?” Jian Wushuang eyes flashed.

“Although the Enduring Samsara Formation is a World-shattering Formation, it’s terrifying because it can evolve for a long time, as for now, it is weak. And it’s just a balanced state of two extreme energies, nothing special. We can find ways to break it.” Xuan Yi smiled, looking confident.

Hearing this, the present Palace Masters’ faces all lit up.

Xuan Yi implied that he had other methods of breaking the Formation. Even if he did not, he was confident to find one.

“Let’s go see the Enduring Samsara Formation.” Xuan Yi smiled.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Xuan Yi Master, this way please!”

Samsara Temple Master led the way for Xuan Yi.

The nearby Green Fire World Celestial Masters and Dao Masters all gawked at the sight of this.

“Who is that person? He’s got some real deal!”

“He actually made so many Palace Masters bow to him, and has Samsara Temple Master lead the way for him? But he’s just in Eternal Realm!”

“So what? I heard that he is the master of Wushuang Palace Master. He’s got a disciple like Jian Wushuang, do you think he’s capable or not? He has great knowledge of Formation. He’s said to have more knowledge than Palace Master Yun. He came up with the previous method to break the Formation, but unfortunately, we underestimated the opponent and failed.”

“Wushuang Palace Master’s master? No wonder!”

“He probably came in person for the Enduring Samsara Formation.”

The entire Battle Fortress was discussing secretly.

Xuan Yi was only in the Eternal Realm. In the entire Battle Fortress, except Jian Wushuang’s brother Wang Yuan, everyone else was above the Dao Master level.

Normally, any one of them could kill Xuan Yi.

But now, the countless experts in the entire Battle Fortress all respected him.

He was Jian Wushuang’s master, naturally, no one dared to look down on him. Moreover, he had great knowledge of Formation.

On the way, Xuan Yi asked causally, “Well, what is your achievement in Sword Principle now?”

“I have now devised two of the strongest Sword Principles and a Creation Level Sword Principle, but unfortunately, I have not found a way to integrate them.” answered the disciple.

If it was possible, he had already combined them and broke through to be a Celestial Master who possessed a Dharma Body. In that way, he would have been able to challenge the Jin Kingdom monarch, and the Green Fire World would not have been so passive.

But he could not find a way to break through.

“Don’t worry, take your time, everything will be fine.” Xuan Yi smiled and asked again, “Which three Sword Principles have you developed?”

“One is the Swordplay of Coalescence, I’ve perfected it and devised the strongest Sword Principle!”

“One is the Spacetime Sword Principle, which is ultra-fast. It can affect the power of Spacetime. It’s also a strongest Sword Principle.”

“The last one is the Yin-Yang Sword Principle, it combines yin and yang energy, and it is only a Creation Level Sword Principle.” Jian Wushuang answered in detail.

“Oh? Yin-Yang Sword Principle?” Xuan Yi cocked one eyebrow and smiled mysteriously.

After a few moments, Xuan Yi came to the edge of the Battle Fortress following the Palace Masters. Through the Restrictions, they saw clearly the spiraling vortex 100,000 miles away.

“Master Xuan Yi, it’s the Enduring Samsara Formation there!” Samsara Temple Master pointed to the vortex.

“I see.” Xuan Yi looked at the black and white vortex in the distance and faintly smiled. “Fortunately, it has only expanded tens of millions of miles; it is still in its early stage.”

“Early stage?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“The larger it expands, the more stable it is. An expansion within one billion belongs to the early stage. If it exceeds one billion, it will be in the middle stage. By that time, we might fail to break it. But now, there is still a chance.” Xuan Yi explained.
