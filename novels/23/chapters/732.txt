Chapter 733: The Baptismal Pool

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The spear seemed to cut the void open, which caused a huge vortex in the air.

At the center of the vortex, there was a streak of terrifying red light, which turned out to be the spear itself.

“It’s so powerful!”

The onlookers were amazed by the scene.

Many of them could tell that Jiu You’s strike was a two-star level.

A Two-star Ancient God was equivalent to a Human Warrior in the Eternal Realm.

That was to say, that strike reached the level of the Eternal Realm.

Facing the attack, Jian Wushuang looked grave. His Sword Heart quivered violently in the sea of consciousness, and its power reached its peak in an instant. He held the Emperor Sword up and struck out.

“Crash!”

Countless sword lights flew outward.

The sky darkened.

The surroundings began shaking.

This move that Jian Wushuang just made was called “Netherworld”. He created it based on his meditation on Sword Principle during the last 80 years.

Also, it was his most powerful technique, which had reached Level Six of the Secret Skill.

In the next moment, the sword and the spear collided.

There was no booming sound, as others had expected, but a squeezing sound of power crushing power.

Suddenly, an overwhelming force swept over the surroundings from where the weapons met.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Jian Wushuang and Jiu You were thrown backward quickly.

The onlookers, who had been watching the fight from far away, were also affected by the force, but luckily, they had many experts among them to shield them from it.

After the two had regained their balance, they looked at each other closely, hundreds of feet apart.

“Jian Wushuang, how about we end this fight in a draw?” Jiu You suddenly asked him.

“That’s exactly what I was thinking.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

In fact, from the very beginning, he had intended to make it a friendly competition, as well as test how much he had progressed during those years.

Therefore, there was no need to battle it out.

Most importantly, he was not sure that he could defeat Jiu You.

“I’ve displayed most of my skills, including the most powerful one, but still I haven’t defeated him yet. Though I have some hidden cards to use, I believe that he does as well.”?Jian Wushuang became lost in thought.

“Being a Gold-armored Ancient God and a Militant Warrior, he must have much more than he’s shown. He clearly has yet to fully use his power.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang came to that conclusion because he knew very well that a Gold-armored Ancient God could be much more powerful than a Divine Realm expert, and in addition to that, Jiu You probably had mastered the Star-river Secret Skill to a high level.

“If he fights with all his power, he can be as powerful as an Eternal Realm expert.

“I know that, even though he is just a One-star Ancient God now.

“As for me, I’m only able to battle the weakest Eternal Realm experts.”

As those thoughts ran through Jian Wushuang’s mind, he suddenly heard Jiu You call his name. That man looked at him and spoke with a smile. “I really admire your power. You even haven’t awoken your bloodline, and yet, you impressed all of us. I believe that once you awaken it, your power will reach a new level.”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled.

It was a pity that he had not awoken his bloodline and was still in the Skyscraping Realm.

However, as long as he could get baptized to awaken his bloodline, he would be able to improve his power by several levels.

“In fact, I came back for the baptism. I want to awaken my bloodline.” Jian Wushuang finally spoke.

“In that case, then good luck to you. I hope that I can meet you someday in the future, and at that time, let’s have a showdown,” said Jiu You.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang smiled again, but he knew that he would not get the chance to meet this man again.

He would have to go back to the Firmament Territory soon.

Jiu You left the Eighth Tribe without staying any longer while Jian Wushuang remained there.

“Jian Wushuang, the baptism will take place in two months. Until then, you can stay here and wait for it,” Elder Ying said to Jian Wushuang.

“Ok, thanks.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He could afford to wait two more months.

Time quickly flew by. Finally, the annual baptism arrived.

Because the baptism was held every year, there were not many people left in each clan to be baptized. This time, Jian Wushuang only had a dozen companions with him.

They were led by Elder Ying to a huge valley.

In the center of the valley was a round pool, larger than 10 meters in diameter. The water in it smelled strange.

Beside the pool, some people were throwing a large number of leaves and plants into it.

“Blub, blub!” Taking a closer look, they saw that the water was boiling.

“This pool is where the people of our Ancient God Clan get baptized. We call it the Baptismal Pool.” Elder Ying’s voice was loud and clear.

“Everyone in our clan has a chance to be baptized in this pool. Most people can awaken their bloodlines and become Ancient Gods, while a few will fail to do so because their bloodlines are too thin.

“Please wait here for a moment.”

After saying all that, Elder Ying walked toward the pool.

“This is the Baptismal Pool.”?The dozen people who were going to be baptized all intently stared at the pool with looks of anticipation.

Jian Wushuang was among them.

“The Baptismal Pool, something that all the sects in the Firmament Territory want to obtain.”?His eyes sparkled.

The experts of the sects in the Firmament Territory all hoped that one day they could be baptized in the pool to awaken their bloodline as an Ancient God.

That was why every time the Eternal Zone was open, those Eternal Realm experts would crazily try to seize the Baptismal Pools from the Ancient God Clan.

Luckily, those pools were heavily guarded, so even if those experts joined hands to seize one, there was little prospect of them succeeding.

And besides that, even if they were lucky enough to succeed, few of them could become Ancient Gods all the same.
