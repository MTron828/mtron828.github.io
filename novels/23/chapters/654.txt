Chapter 655: The Ending

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Finally, Jian Wushuang still chose to join the Ancient Sect.

The experts were not surprised about his decision, but Shi Qianhan was humiliated and lost all face.

Perhaps the Cloud Sea Asgard was indeed very strong, but Shi Qianhan relied only on this to compete with Xuan Yi, which was pretty ridiculous.

In the fourth round, the cultivation ages were still being checked. Numerous geniuses received their results and some of the cultivation ages were also very short, but still Jian Wushuang was vastly superior to the others.

Soon, all the geniuses finished the examination and the last round of the genius battle was completely over.

The Firmament Territory Feast which was held every three-thousand years and attracted numerous Sects in the Firmament Territory was finally finished.

Next, most of the geniuses chose to join their own Sects.

Jian Wushuang, Feng, Huo Ying and the other geniuses who were from the Ancient World all became the disciples of the Ancient Sect.

“Jian Wushuang.” A figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Gong Chao.” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“You really have good talent, I am looking forward to fighting with you,” Gong Chao said.

“Me too.” Jian Wushuang slightly smiled.

In this Firmament Territory Feast, Gong Chao was at the top based on his strength, but Jian Wushuang was the best according to talent.

“No rush, you two definitely can compete one day.” A gentle man in a purple robe walked towards them.

“Xuan Yi Lord.” Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao both bowed to him.

Although Gong Chao didn’t join the Ancient Sect, he respected Xuan Yi who was the number one in the Firmament Territory of the Eternal Realm.

“Soon, there will be an exchange between the Ancient Sect and the Cloud Sea Asgard. You two can compete at that moment,” Xuan Yi answered with a smile.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao both raised their eyebrows.

“I’m waiting for you to challenge me,” Gong Chao said.

“Trust me, I won’t disappoint you.” Jian Wushuang slightly smiled.

After that, Gong Chao went to Cloud Sea Asgard with Shi Qianhan who had already recovered.

“You six, follow me to the Ancient Sect.” Xuan Yi waved.

Jian Wushuang, Feng and the other people quickly looked at each other and then followed.

On the way to the Ancient Sect, they all had a hint of anticipation. They wanted to know, as one of the top Sects, what unique features it had to surpass the other three powerhouses in the Firmament Territory.

Following Xuan Yi for two days, the six people finally arrived at the Ancient Sect.

The Firmament Territory was very vast.

The Ancient Sect, as one of the top Sects there, was located in a huge and ancient mountain range.

This mountain range with countless alpine jungles stretched for thousands of miles and the Ancient Sect was in its center.

Above the Void, Jian Wushuang, Feng, Huo Ying, Bing Shan, Xuan Ying and Wu Huang were floating patiently. They all respectfully stared at the giant and ancient Sect which was in front of them.

This old sect was under the protection of a huge Formation. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The Formation was mysterious and powerful.

Inside the Sect, there were many giant mountains, and in the valleys between the mountains, there were a large number of palaces and pavilions.

Magnificent and huge!

At the same time, its ancient aura was overflowing as well.

“The Spiritual Power here...”

Jian Wushuang looked around and realized the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy in this Void was much more powerful than the other places in the Eternal World.

Not only the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy, but also the Origin Energy was stronger than any other place.

“That’s the Ancient Sect. Not to mention others, its location is already superior to other places,” Jian Wushuang admired this deeply.

“Follow me,” Xuan Yi said and then he went straight to the interior of the Sect.

The experts within all expected and knew Xuan Yi, so they didn’t activate the huge Formation when they saw him.

When Jian Wushuang and the others followed Xuan Yi to enter the Ancient Sect, they kept looking around and could sense a tremendous aura nearby.

“You six just arrived here but you all will cultivate here, so I will tell you our rules and some news about the Ancient Sect,” Xuan Yi said.

Jian Wushuang and the others listened carefully.

“You must have already received some information about the unique features of our Ancient Sect.”

“Although we Ancient Sect is only one of the top Sects in the Firmament Territory, we are much better than the other three powerhouses, especially in training our disciples. Now, I can’t tell you why, but you will know about it when the time is right,” Xuan Yi said.

“Let me tell you some details about the internal situation of the Ancient Sect now.”

“In the Ancient Sect, we have plenty of cultivation resources which includes one mountain and three palaces!”

“One mountain and three palaces?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“These one mountain and three palaces are related to the foundation of the Ancient Sect. Let me show you the mountain first,” Xuan Yi said. Soon, they reached a huge giant mountain.

Inside the Ancient Sect, there were hundreds of similar giant mountains but this one in front of them was totally covered by a huge Formation. This gave one the feeling of extreme mystery.

“This giant mountain?” Jian Wushuang frowned and stared at it. He felt so familiar with it.

“This giant mountain is called Enlightenment Mountain,” Xuan Yi said.

“Enlightenment Mountain?” Jian Wushuang, Feng and the others were shocked.

Before, in the second round of the genius battle, the geniuses had already known about the Enlightenment Mountain and had stayed there for one full month. They also had spent one month there, so they were all familiar with the name.

“The characteristics of this Enlightenment Mountain are the same as the one that you stayed in the Firmament Territory Feast. After all, that one simulates ours,” Xuan Yi said with a smile.

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang, Feng and the others suddenly understood.

“You all stayed and cultivated Dao in the Enlightenment Mountain before, so you should know that the cultivation speed inside it is twice as fast compared to the outside. However, the speed here is at least three times faster,” Xuan Yi said.
