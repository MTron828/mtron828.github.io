4661 Wushuang

With thousands of invisible Great Dao’s on his body, Lu Ding stood high above at the peak of the Spring of Chaos, giving off a demonic aura.

The chaotic energy swept across the entire broken Star Field.

All the Supreme martial artists felt a slight shiver in their hearts.

Seeing that the seal on the Spring of Chaos had been broken, Feng Qi, who had originally planned to stop, suddenly realized that she could no longer control the divine power in her body.

Long Yan and Long Chi’s expressions changed drastically. They also felt that the Spring of Chaos was like an endless black abyss, trying to drag them all in.

Feng Qi suddenly looked at the broken sky and saw a strange figure standing behind Lu Ding. The figure’s facial features were extremely faint, as if they had not grown out yet.

All the Supreme experts’ hearts sank, and the divine power in their bodies poured out uncontrollably.

After absorbing the divine power of nearly 150,000 high-level Supreme realm experts, the strange body behind Lu Ding was growing facial features, hair, meridians, and internal organs rapidly.

The seemingly kind and benevolent Lu Ding had also revealed his ugly face at this moment, his dark and crazy eyes looking down on them.

“To be able to fuse with my clay idol is your greatest honor. Why do you need to resist?” Lu Ding said in an intoxicated manner.

“You f*cking piece of sh*t!” Feng Qi shouted angrily. “You killed more cultivators than the entire Void Universe! You should be hacked into pieces!”

Lu Ding gave a strange smile and slowly bent down. “I’ve said it before. It’s your honor and your destiny. Only by making some contributions to me will I show you mercy and show you a more profound realm.”

“When the time comes, you will realize how lamentable it is for you to be stuck in your own ways.”

Every Supreme martial artist’s body was rapidly declining, and their respective cultivation levels were also starting to decline.

Even Feng Qi, who was a Half Ancestor, could feel her cultivation level dropping.

She tried to get rid of that terrifying power, but she found that it was useless. She could not even mobilize her divine power.

Long Yan and Long Chi were the same, looking at the sky in despair.

As he absorbed the divine power, the strange body behind Lu Ding was filled with energy. His facial features gradually straightened, and his black hair reached his shoulders. Countless fine meridians began to wriggle under his skin.

At the same time, the Great Dao that symbolized the Ancestor realm began to fall on his body.

The vast divine power was like an abyss and a huge sea. Energy that made one’s heart palpitate surged out from the pores of his body.

All the Supreme martial artists had witnessed the birth of an Ancestor realm expert.

Everything was too unbelievable. At most, a universe only had enough fate energy to allow for one Ancestor realm cultivator. How could there be two?

In the next moment, the entire Cangwu Platform’s giant hall, along with the Star Field, could not withstand the descent of the two Ancestor realm experts and directly shattered.

That strange physical body, the moment it reached the Ancestor realm, it completely possessed intelligence.

The fate energy of the universe that he had plundered, as well as the boundless divine power, were all sucked into his mouth. His face, which was exactly the same as Lu Ding’s, was filled with greed.

Looking at the completed clay idol, Lu Ding nodded in satisfaction and said excitedly, “Now, let’s use your bodies as your last contribution.”

With that, countless wisps of extreme yang power emerged from his palm, covering the sky and pressing down heavily. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Feng Qi, who had already fallen to the Supreme realm, did not have the power to fight back and could only watch herself die.

However, in the next moment, an even more vast and mysterious divine power suddenly swept over. Like a biting cold wind, it directly crushed the net-like ultimate yang power.

Lu Ding suddenly turned his head and looked fiercely at the place where the attack had come from. With one look, his eyes narrowed.

In the completely shattered void, a total of more than 50,000 Supreme martial artists broke through the fog and arrived in an earth-shattering manner.

At the forefront of the majestic army, Supreme Xue Bo, Ninth Kalpa King, Supreme Jun Fu, and the other representatives of the Divine Life Palace were all dispatched.

At the same time, in front of them were two figures completely covered in loose black robes, giving Lu Ding an invisible pressure.

“Old man Lu Ding, you should know that even though you are an Ancestor realm being, you only have one life.”

The majestic voice carrying the divine punishment of the Nine Heavens resounded. The mysterious figure at the front slowly pulled down the hood on his head, revealing a determined and pure face. The brilliant golden patterns floating in his hair made him look like a majestic God that could not be looked at directly.

“Jian Wushuang! How could it be you?” Lu Ding cried out.

At this moment, all of the 100,000 Supreme realm cultivators, who had been trapped and fallen into great despair, were ecstatic.

Even though he had disappeared for nearly 300 years, Jian Wushuang’s appearance was like a calming pill for everyone.

“If it wasn’t for me, were you planning to wipe out the entire divine universe?”

Jian Wushuang took a step forward and his divine power, which was close to crushing, swept up like a Heavenly River.

Ancestor realm aura!

Feng Qi looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief with her eyes wide open.

He had only disappeared for 300 years. How could he become an Ancestor realm cultivator in such a short time?

Lu Ding’s face was extremely gloomy. He waved his sleeve to offset the influence of Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, he had already thought of retreating.

Jian Wushuang’s ferocity was clear to Lu Ding in the last battle. He was a terrifying existence who could kill Void God with the power of a Half Ancestor realm.

Now that he was Ancestor realm, his power had probably transcended the restrictions of the universe.

At the thought of this, Lu Ding immediately pushed the clay idol and tried to escape.

Whoosh…

A wave of Black Water ripples spread out between heaven and earth, and under the wide black robe, Old Master’s face appeared.

Lu Ding’s figure stopped in place for a moment.

Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted together as he slashed down with the Tarot Divine Sword.

The unparalleled sword radiance that seemed to be able to split the heavens and earth apart slashed at Lu Ding.

Lu Ding had no choice but to fight Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, if you leave now, I will let bygones be bygones. If you continue to be stubborn, you will die!” Lu Ding said ruthlessly as he struck out with his palm and used the infinite power of extreme yang to offset the sword radiance.

Jian Wushuang laughed coldly, “Destroy your own life source now, and I can spare your Qilin clan from extermination for the crimes you committed. Otherwise, I will not spare a single one of your entire clan!”

“Jian Wushuang, do you really think you can defeat me?” Lu Ding was furious. He swung his palm at Jian Wushuang and shouted, “Kill him!”

At the same time, the strange clay idol behind him also laughed eerily. Controlling its still stiff body, it also slapped down.

An aura as deep as the abyss was revealed.

With the Tarot Divine Sword in front of him, Jian Wushuang broke through the Ancestor realm power with one move. His Sword Dao, which had long reached the perfection of martial arts, suddenly rushed toward the clay idol, which was closer to him.
