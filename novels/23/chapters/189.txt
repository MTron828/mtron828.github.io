“Now that everybody is here, I will announce the requirement for passing the first stage,” the purple-robed elder said.

Jian Wushuang and his comrades were slightly stunned. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

15 people participated in the hunt, but only 13 of them were here now, yet the purple-robed elder said everybody was here.

Jian Wushuang and his comrades immediately realized that the missing two might have died during the hunt.

“I was not in danger during the hunt because my strength is greater than my comrades. In addition, I knew the strength of the bandits thanks to Tang Wuji’s detailed information. But they... ” Jian Wushuang sighed with helplessness.

Life and death were decreed by fate.

For most geniuses, the Easternmost Hunt was not only a great opportunity, but also a great peril.

Opportunity and danger always went hand-in-hand.

“Hand over your armlets,” the purple-robed elder said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang and other participators immediately took out the armlets they had gained during the five days of difficult hunting.

“We will use points to measure the result of the hunt this time,” the purple-robed elder narrated.

“The armlets are divided into four levels, they include Black Iron, Silver, Purple Gold, and Blood Jade. Each level has corresponding points.”

“A Black Iron Armlet equals 1 point.”

“A Silver Armlet equals 10 points.”

“A Purple Gold Armlet equals 100 points.”

“And A Blood Jade Armlet equals 1000 points.”

“100 points are needed to pass this stage.”

Hearing this, many of those 13 geniuses present looked embarrassed.

“Now, everybody step forward and pass me your armlets,” the purple-robed elder continued.

Shortly after saying that, a genius, with an agonizing look on his face, stepped forward and passed his armlets to the purple-robed elder.

“Hum,” the purple-robed elder put a cold smile on his face after he counted the armlet, “You have 20 armlets, but 18 of them are Black Iron Armlets and only 2 are Silver Armlets. 38 points in total. So you are not qualified to participate in the Point Battle.”

The grey-robed elder announced it openly, making this genius’ complexion turn pale.

Then another genius stepped forward.

“You got 84 points, much more than the last one. But unfortunately, you are not eligible to participate in the second stage either.”

“61 points, not qualified!”

“21 points, trash!”

...

There were several geniuses who stepped forward in succession, but none qualified for the Point Battle in the second stage.

At this moment, Feng Yutian, who was from the Gladiator Arena, stepped forward.

Feng Yutian was ranked 4th in the updated Earthly Dragon List in the Tianzong dynasty.

“124 points. Finally, there is someone who can participate in the second stage. But with so few points, you will be one of the weakest among the top geniuses in the second stage. You may easily lose your life,” the purple-robed elder said. Then he gave the armlets back to Feng Yutian.

What the purple-robed elder said made Feng Yutian look bad, but he was not angry. After taking the armlets, he quietly stood aside.

The remained geniuses stepped forward one by one, and the corresponding results came out.

Mu Yingying got 136 points.

Baili Chen got 349 points.

Yang Zaixuan got 275 points.

Su Rou got 115 points.

Except for them, no other disciples surpassed 100 points.

“Yang Zaixuan, how did you get two Purple Gold Armlets?” Baili Chen looked at Yang Zaixuan in surprise.

Both Mu Yingying and Feng Yutian also stared at Yang Zaixuan.

Both Mu Yingying and Feng Yutian were ranked higher than Yang Zaixuan.

But, in the end, Yang Zaixuan got twice as many points as they did.

How could they not be shocked?

Yang Zaixuan looked indifferent. He was just standing there like a stone, not explaining anything.

As for Su Rou’s points, people thought it was reasonable because Su Rou had pushed Xue Yun back during the selection battle.

All the geniuses of Tianzong Dynasty who participated in the hunt already knew their points except for Jian Wushuang. At this point, he stepped forward as well and walked towards the purple-robed elder.

Jian Wushuang took out the armlets he gained during the five days of hunting.

“Huh?” After seeing Jian Wushuang take out over ten armlets in succession, the purple-robed elder was in shock.

Among these ten or so armlets, the Black Iron and Silver Armlets could be neglected. But there were three Purple Gold Armlets and one Blood Jade Armlet.

“Blood Jade Armlet?” The purple-robed elder looked at Jian Wushuang with astonishment.

Normally the beasts that owned the Blood Jade Armlet had at least reached the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm. However, one of these warriors was killed by a genius who was only in the Gold Core Realm. This rarely occurred in the Twelve Dynasties.

Normally, such super geniuses only existed in the two large Empires and few middle-sized Empires. But now, unexpectedly, a small Empire produced one!

“In total 1,388 points. Well done, young man,” the purple-robed elder said while looking at Jian Wushuang. The way he looked at Jian Wushuang was obviously different from the other geniuses.

After all, a genius who could get more than 1,000 points in the hunt was at the pinnacle of all Twelve Dynasties.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s points, the other geniuses were all stunned.

“So many points?”

“His points are more than 1,000 higher than Baili Chen.”

“How could he kill a beast that owned a Blood Jade Armlet? He’s a real monster.”

The geniuses were all looking at Jian Wushuang, especially those who were not qualified to participate in the second stage. Their eyes were filled with envy and jealousy.

Unfortunately, even though Jian Wushuang gained so many points, he couldn’t share them.

“All right, I have recorded everyone’s score. The geniuses who are not qualified for the second stage can leave now,” the purple-robed elder said.

Hearing this, the geniuses who did not have enough points sadly left, one after the other.

Among the thirteen geniuses who survived, only six had enough points and were entitled to attend the second stage.

They were Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, Su Rou, Baili Chen, Mu Yingying, and Feng Yutian!

“You six already did a good job by passing the first stage. Next, I will tell you guys the rules for Stage Two,” the purple-robed elder said.

“The goal in Stage Two is actually very simple, it’s point stealing!”

“The armlets you collected during the hunt, which can represent your points, have been returned to you. Over the next ten days, you will enter Sky Valley and battle with the warriors from the other dynasties for the armlets!”

“After ten days, a ranking will be created according to the points you collect!”

“In the end, geniuses who rank in the top ten will be rewarded by the twelve dynasties.”

“The higher the ranking is, the greater the rewards.”
