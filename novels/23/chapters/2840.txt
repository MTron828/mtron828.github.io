Chapter 2841: Blood Essence of a Special Life Form

——

“This purity... is the Blood Essence of a special life form?” The silver-haired older man suddenly raised his head, and his eyes shone with an unprecedented light.

“Yes, it’s the Blood Essence of a special life form that you’ve been longing for, Master.” Bi Yan smiled.

“Quick, bring it over for me to take a look.” The silver-haired older man appeared incomparably excited.

Bi Yan immediately brought the jade bottle to the silver-haired older man.

After the silver-haired older man received it, he began to observe it.

“It’s too pure. This Blood Essence is too pure. It’s far more powerful than the Blood Essence of the two top bloodlines that I’ve obtained before. Such pure Blood Essence is definitely from a special life form. But, moreover, even if it’s a special life form, it should be one of the stronger ones. It’s definitely not an ordinary one.” The silver-haired older man carefully looked at the Blood Essence in the jade bottle. It was as if he was looking at a treasure.

In the eyes of an extremely high-level refiner, the most precious things were no different from the materials used to refine divine weapons and treasures.

And to refine an extremely high-level divine weapon or treasure, to a large extent, some Blood Essence was needed.

The higher the level of the Blood Essence, the better.

Once upon a time, this silver-haired older man had obtained two drops of Blood Essence from a top-tier bloodline race, as if he had obtained a precious treasure.

However, those two drops of Blood Essence were nothing compared to the Blood Essence of a special life form.

What was special about a special life form was something that the world had given birth to on its own. Every type of life form was unique!

Even in the vast absolute beginning divine realm, there were too few of such life forms.

It wasn’t easy to reach the sky to obtain the Blood Essence of these special life forms.

The silver-haired older man had always longed for a drop, but now, without any warning, his disciple had actually delivered a drop of the Blood Essence of a special lifeform to him.

“Bi Yan, who delivered this Blood Essence?” The silver-haired older man immediately asked. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“It was an Advanced Great Divine Master called Sword One,” Bi Yan said hurriedly.

“Advanced Great Divine Master?” The silver-haired older man was somewhat startled.

“Master, I’ve never heard of sword one before. He doesn’t seem to have any background in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, but he has many treasures. From the very beginning, he took out a 12,000-kilogram Blood Desolate Emperor Crystal. He wanted to use this Blood Desolate Emperor Crystal to ask the master to refine a divine weapon for him personally. But when I said that a single Blood Desolate Emperor Crystal wouldn’t move master out this drop of Blood Essence,” Bi Yan said.

“An Advanced Great Divine Master can take out 12,000 kilograms of Blood Desolate Emperor Crystal and the blood essence of a special life form? Interesting.” The silver-haired older man was obviously interested, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Bi Yan, go and invite Sword One over. Remember to invite him, and be polite. Don’t neglect him just because he is an Advanced Great Divine Master,” the silver-haired old man warned.

“Yes.” Bi Yan nodded and left immediately.

The silver-haired elder was still looking at the Essence Blood in the jade bottle, his eyes shining even brighter.

...

“Mr. Sword One, as I said before, the master was pleased to see the Essence Blood. Now he asked me to invite you to see him. Come with me.” Bi Yan smiled humbly.

“In that case, I’ll have to trouble you to lead the way.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Under Bi Yan’s personal guidance, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at the deepest part of the castle and arrived at the crimson space.

Jian Wushuang immediately saw the silver-haired old man. However, the silver-haired old man was now wearing an ordinary gray robe, and his expression became calm and unfathomable.

“Sword One greets Master Mo.” Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully.

Facing the number one blacksmith master in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and a powerful Immortal Saint, Jian Wushuang still maintained his due respect.

“Sword One is too polite. Please rise.” The silver-haired older man, Master Mo, waved his sleeve, and Jian Wushuang naturally lifted him up.

Then Lord Mo glanced at Bi Yan behind him and said, “Disciple, you can leave now. I want to have a private chat with Sword One.”

“Yes.” Bi Yan glanced at Jian Wushuang and bowed before leaving.

Only Jian Wushuang and Lord Mo were left in the crimson space.

“Judging from your aura, you’re only an Advanced Great Divine Master, but your attacks are extraordinary. First, you took out 12,000 kilograms of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, and now you even took out a drop of special life Essence Blood. Moreover, you brought it to me. Aren’t you worried that I’ll be greedy and leave you and the two treasures behind? After all, this drop of special life Essence Blood is very attractive to me,” Lord Mo said faintly.

“Haha, Lord Mo, as the number one blacksmith in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, with such a prominent status, how could you do such a thing?

“Even if you really have such a thought... Since I dared to come alone, I naturally have absolute confidence. If you really have such a plan, I guarantee you will regret it.” Although, Jian Wushuang smiled. The confidence between his brows was not an act.

He was truly confident.

He naturally had his own confidence since he dared to come alone and showed the Blood Desolate Emperor Crystal and the processed Blood Essence to Lord Mo.

His confidence came from the fact that he was a perfect chaotic creature.

Lord Mo could not kill him at all. If he was really desperate, he would use the will of heaven. He would also directly use the life-level suppression to teach Lord Mo a lesson.

Lord Mo took a deep look at Jian Wushuang. His vision was very high and he could see people very accurately.

He could tell that Jian Wushuang was indeed very confident.

Lord Mo changed the topic and smiled. “What kind of magic weapon do you want me to refine for you?”

“I have already refined the magic weapon. However, although this magic weapon is also a natal, it hasn’t been added with my Blood Essence during the refining process. So I want to ask you to refine it again so that it can merge with my Blood Essence power,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It’s that simple?” Lord Mo could not help being surprised.

It was only a matter of refining a natal magic weapon and infusing it with the power of blood essence. Some fifth or sixth-grade blacksmiths should be able to do it easily.

“Lord Mo, don’t think of this as a simple matter. It seems easy, but in fact, the requirements for blacksmiths are very high. It is said that you are a top seventh-grade blacksmithing master, but whether you can really meet my requirements and complete this step for me is uncertain,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Oh?” Lord Mo narrowed his eyes and glanced at Jian Wushuang without getting angry.
