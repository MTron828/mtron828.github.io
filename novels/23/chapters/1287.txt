“Three days? So soon?” Jin Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Soon?” Universe God Dong Men smiled faintly, “I’ve sensed the coming of the God Test two hundred years ago. I knew that the God Test is coming soon so I’ve been preparing for the past two hundred years and I’ve delayed it for very long. Now, I can’t push it any further so I am preparing to undergo the tribulation in three days!”

“Are you confident?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Confident?” Universe God Dong Men shook his head, “I am a Universe God in the First Heaven. I’ve passed the God Test in the First Heaven once. I was well prepared then and it was quite a smooth process, but this time, I am going to undergo the God Test in the Second Heaven!”

“The God Test in the Second Heaven is much tougher than the God Test in the First Heaven. Although I am well prepared after two hundred years, I am only thirty percent confident that I will pass the God Test!”

“Thirty percent?” Jiang Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“It’s already very high to be thirty percent confident. An ordinary Universe God mostly only about ten or twenty percent confident when it comes to the God Test in the Second Heaven.” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang felt helpless too.

Thirty percent is really not little.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m going to undergo God Test on Tribulation Passing Pinnacle in three days. Come over and watch. After all, it is just a matter of time for you to go through it. It’d be beneficial for you to feel the power of the God Test ahead of time.” Universe God Dong Men said.

“Mm.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

Universe God Dong Men then returned to prepare himself.

The news about Universe God Dong Men undergoing the God Test in the Second Heaven on Tribulation Passing Pinnacle spread like wildfire in Dayu Palace.

God Test, it was a terrifying existence that would cause fear in all Universe Gods.

Not one Universe God who wasn’t terrified about the God Test. Of course, like the Master of Dayu Palace, a Universe God in the Third Heaven who already undergone the God Test in the Third Heaven, was an exception.

In Dayu Palace, there were a lot of Universe Gods and most of them were hovering in the First Heaven. Hardly any of them transcended to Second Heaven. Every time there was someone undergoing God Test, it would normally attract many Universe Gods to visit and draw on more experience.

After all, watching other people undergoing God Test was like accumulating experience for themselves when they undergo God Test in the future.

Three days later, on the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle, Universe God Dong Men sat cross-legged on the pinnacle all by himself. He closed his eyes faintly in order to indulge himself in his peak state.

In the void far from Tribulation Passing Pinnacle, a large amount of inner disciples from Dayu Palace stood there in silence. Jian Wushuang was among the crowd.

“Jian Wushuang, keep your eyes on him. It’s rare to be able to see someone undergo God Test. Although there is a huge difference between God Test and Inverse Cultivation Test, it would be beneficial for you if you could feel the power of the God Test and get to be mentally prepared.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly but his gaze was fixed on the figure on the peak of the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle that was paying full concentration.

“Brother Dong Men, you must pass through.” Jiang Wushuang murmured.

For eighty years, he had been fighting with the inner disciples in Dayu Palace and there were some who shared good relationship with him. The one that was closest to him was naturally Universe God Dong Men. Jian Wushuang, of course, hoped for him to pass through God Test in the Second Heaven.

“God Test is in the brewing!” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang also noticed that in the void above the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, there was a huge dark cloud that covered the sky entirely.

In the dark clouds, there were lightnings striking. There was a terrifying imposing manner spread from the dark clouds that shook the sky.

“Such strong force.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He was far away from the dark clouds but the force within the dark clouds was felt across the place and it was daunting. One could well imagine just how pressuring it was for Universe God Dong Men who stood right below the dark clouds and was fully engulfed by the God’s test.

“Universe Dong Men belongs to a more ordinary cultivation so it’s not that bad. There’s isn’t anything too bizarre. Hence, the God test that he is undergoing is considered a normal thunder test,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Thunder test?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

King of Venomous Worms explained, “In Eternal Chaotic World, there are a variety of God tests. The more skillful a practitioner is, the more ferocious the God Test that they undergo.

“However, the God Test could simply be categorized into three types: thunder test, fire test, and mind test!”

“Among the three God tests, thunder test is the most ordinary, followed by fire test. And the mind test is the most terrifying one!”

“Universe God Dong Men is facing the ordinary thunder test. With his capability, if he was well prepared, the possibility of his success is not low.”

Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement then suddenly asked oddly, “My Inverse Cultivation Test, would it be one of those?”

“Inverse Cultivation Test? Most that I know of are, but yours might not be. In short, even if it was, you would definitely be dealing with the most terrifying mind test,” King of Venomous Worms replied.

Jian Wushuang was left speechless. He didn’t pursue further but looked forward attentively.

In the void above the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, the force within the dark clouds was getting more ferocious. Even though there was a long distance, the Universe Gods by the side were terrified too.

Everyone was holding their breath.

“The God Test has finished brewing. It’s going to start soon.” King of Venomous Worms said.

On the peak of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, Universe God Dong Men who had his eyes closed most of the time noticed the movement in the void above. He suddenly lifted his head and there was a sharp flash.

“Come on!”

Universe God Dong Men looked ferocious and there was an unprecedented craziness that surged in his eyes.

Rumble!

There was a bolt from the blue with a tremendous noise.

From among the huge dark cloud, there was a faint gold lightning that descended.

The faint gold lighting looked light in color but consisted terrifying power to break the sky and shatter the earth. The lightning descended and struck at Universe God Dong Men directly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The veins on Universe God Dong Men’s forehead stood out and the Divine Power in his body was surging and erupting without holding back.

“Break!”

Universe God Dong Men roared and swung his sword. The entire universe turned dark all of a sudden.

A huge sword shadow became extremely significant in the dark. It was extremely swift too. It skimmed over the faint gold lighting in the blink of an eye.

“That is…” For Jian Wushuang who was watching from afar, his pupil dilated at the split second.

He fought vigorously with Universe God Dong Men many times and he knew of Universe God Dong Men’s capability. Universe God Dong Men was putting his most powerful unique skill that he had invented to play.

“Universe God Dong Men straightway used his secret skill along with his most powerful unique skill?” Jian Wushuang was surprised but he creased his eyebrows, “But, would that be enough to defend him from the lightning?”

Although the faint gold lightning wasn’t directed to Jian Wushuang, his soul power felt it long ago. The power of that faint gold lightning was definitely not any weaker than a full force attack by a Universe God in the Second Heaven!
