4201 A Fifth-Stage Ruler

In his opinion, Jian Wushuang was only a fourth-stage Ruler. Even if he broke through successfully and became a fifth-stage Ruler, he would not be a match for him.

As time slowly passed, the vortex grew larger and larger, like a black hole that could devour the starry sky. Its momentum was terrifying to the extreme.

The Demonic Wind Ruler and the others did not leave. Instead, they sat cross-legged by the river of enlightenment, waiting for Jian Wushuang to come out of seclusion.

One day passed…

Two days had passed…

In the blink of an eye, two years had passed.

The riverbank of the river of enlightenment was now surrounded by people. they were all furious and stared at the turbulent whirlpool in the river of enlightenment with hostility.

Ever since the whirlpool appeared, the law energy in the river of enlightenment became chaotic and was sucked away by the whirlpool. They did not even cultivate in the river of enlightenment.

Thus, they were currently filled with pent-up anger and wanted to vent it.

“Rumble!”

Finally, on a certain day two years later, the surface of the entire river of enlightenment began to boil violently. Like boiling water, fist-sized bubbles appeared.

It was as if a monster was about to walk out of the river of enlightenment.

“Jian Wushuang is coming out!”

“Hmph, Jian Wushuang is finally coming out. i’ve been waiting for a long time.”

“Apologize! Jian Wushuang must apologize to us!”

On the riverbank, many new disciples of the Divine Life Palace were clamoring.

As for the Demonic Wind Ruler, he slowly straightened his body and gloomily looked at the river of enlightenment.

…

At this moment, at the bottom of the river of enlightenment.

A huge rock covered in aquatic grass suddenly trembled.

Kachaa.

A crack instantly appeared on the huge rock.

Kacha kacha kacha.

Then, more and more cracks appeared. Finally, with a loud bang, the rock exploded completely, revealing a cold figure in black clothes and black hair who was sitting cross-legged.

“A fifth-stage chief Ruler…it’s finally done.” A low and cold voice came out of the black figure’s mouth.

The next moment.

The man in black slowly raised his head and opened his eyes.

In an instant, two rays of divine light flashed through his eyes like lightning that tore through the night!

“I…I…you’ve become even stronger.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. He could feel that after he had finished digesting the divine medicine in his body, the abundant divine power was about to burst his divine body!

Jian Wushuang had an illusion that he could crush a star and a galaxy with a raise of his hand!

“Lord River Spirit, thank you again.”

Jian Wushuang looked at River Spirit, who was sitting on the ground and looking up at the sky with a smile.

“Don’t talk to me, I just want some peace and quiet.” The River Spirit waved his hand weakly.

Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

“Lord River Spirit, please take your time to rest. I’ll take my leave.” Jian Wushuang cupped his hands at him.

It had been ten thousand years. He should go out and take a look.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang stomped his right foot and his whole body shot up into the sky!

…

Bang!

A beam of golden light shot out of the river of enlightenment!

“Jian Wushuang!”

“He’s finally out!!”

In an instant, countless cold snorts sounded.

The Demonic Wind Ruler squinted his eyes and took a step forward, dashing toward Jian Wushuang.

“You are Jian Wushuang?”

He stood in front of Jian Wushuang and sized him up. Then, he asked with an unfriendly look. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Jian Wushuang’s expression was strange. Why were there so many people surrounding him the moment he came out?

Although he was confused, Jian Wushuang did not think too much about it. He cupped his hands politely and replied, “Yes, it’s me. What’s the matter?”

“Do you know that because of you, the principles of the river of enlightenment are in chaos and we can’t cultivate anymore?” Demonic Wind Ruler asked.

“Oh, I’m sorry.” Jian Wushuang replied. Perhaps he had not paid attention to the strength at the last moment of his breakthrough, causing him to absorb too much aura of principles at once.

After saying that, Jian Wushuang flew away.

After ten thousand years of closed-door cultivation, Jian Wushuang could not help but miss home.

Looking at Jian Wushuang’s back, the Demonic Wind Ruler’s expression turned gloomy.

“An apology and that’s it?” Demonic Wind Ruler said coldly.

His fans, as well as the new disciples of the Divine Life Palace, were all talking at once.

“How can there be such a rude person in this world?”

“I can’t leave. I have to leave something behind as the price!”

“Hmph, it’s because of him that so many of us can’t cultivate. How can an apology be enough to let it go?”

“Right, they must compensate us for our losses!”

They did not try to hide their voices, so Jian Wushuang could hear them.

Jian Wushuang stopped.

He frowned and turned around to look at the new disciples of the Divine Life Palace. He said indifferently, “How do you want to compensate?”

The new disciples of the Divine Life Palace could not help but look at each other.

It seemed that Jian Wushuang was a pushover.

They were overjoyed. They had never thought that Jian Wushuang would be so easy to talk to and agree to the compensation.

The fear in his heart instantly disappeared.

“I want 10000 Universe Origin Stones!”

“I want a godly medicine!”

“I want a principles treasure!”

They all shouted at the same time.

A look of contempt appeared on Demonic Wind Ruler’s face.

It seemed that Jian Wushuang was only so-so.

“Be quiet.” He pressed his hand down.

Instantly, the noisy crowd quieted down.

“Mm.” Demonic Wind Ruler nodded, satisfied with his prestige.

“Jian Wushuang, when I first came to the Divine Life Palace, I heard people saying that you were the number one genius. However, I didn’t believe it and wanted to see for myself. How is it?”

The Demonic Wind Ruler looked at Jian Wushuang with a fake smile.

Without waiting for Jian Wushuang to reply, he smiled and continued, “Jian Wushuang, don’t say that I’m bullying you. Since you’ve just become a fifth stage great Ruler, I’ll let you have one move first. How about it?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly became strange. The current him was afraid that even the Ninth Kalpa King, who was comparable to a Supreme, would not dare to say that he would give him a first move. However, this hothead who came out of nowhere actually said that he would give him a first move?

“Oh? are you sure?” Jian Wushuang blinked his eyes and said.

“Hmph, I, Demonic Wind, always keep my word. If I say I’ll let you have one move, then I’ll let you have one move. Is this a lie?” The Demonic Wind Ruler harrumphed coldly in displeasure, “Jian Wushuang, I promise you that if I lose, all the compensation will be written off. What do you think?”

Jian Wushuang replied with a faint ‘hmm’, then swept his gaze across the faces of Demonic Wind Ruler’s fans. he raised his eyebrows and asked, “You all agree with what he said.”
