Chapter 713: Jet-black Arrow

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I have to kill him even into the inner layer no matter what.” The black-robed elder radiated a huge killing intent.

If Jian Wushuang kept hesitating, the elder would not stop until he managed to kill him.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures, one after another, appeared on the edge of the pale gold lightning and directly rushed into the inner layer.

There, the endless jungle had disappeared and had been replaced by an immense wilderness, where the black-robed elder was chasing Jian Wushuang, who was absconding like crazy, with no effort.

Short after intruding the inner layer, Jian Wushuang found his spiritual power had run out.

Even though he had taken many elixirs to regain some on the run, he burned much more than what he recovered.

Even with his spiritual power was exhausted, the Dragon Blood Secret Skill continued to burn. However, now instead of consuming his spiritual power what burnt was Jian Wushuang’s own blood.

With the blood in Jian Wushuang’s body burning wildly, his heart felt a sudden pain.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang’s body seemed like it was about to melt under the torment of the pain, and he couldn’t stop cursing wildly.

Despite all of this, he was still escaping like a madman.

He would never give up when his life was in danger, even in such an impasse.

“Haha, young man, are you okay?”

The black-robed elder behind Jian Wushuang sneered, finally aware of Jian Wushuang’s odd complexion.

“Don’t struggle anymore! Get ready for your death!”

“It won’t be so painful if you die.” The black-robed elder said in a cold voice.

But at this time… Something strange happened.

Swoosh!

A streak of black light plunged into the air at an amazing speed, quickly reaching the black-robed elder.

“What’s this?”

When the light appeared in front of him, the black-robed elder finally saw it clearly, and a strange look appeared on his face.

That was a pure black arrow with an evil aura.

“Who shot the arrow?”

The black-robed elder was terrified. He could feel the horror emanating from the arrow although he failed to find who was the archer.

The jet-black arrow directly hit the chest of the black-robed elder old man at an amazingly fast speed. The elder had no time to dodge and could only wave his black dagger in a great rush. The dagger chopped at the arrowhead, trying to force it back or change its direction.

However, the power of the sudden arrow skyrocketed when it collided with the dagger, and then it shocked the dagger away and continued straight at the black-robed elder.

“This is not good!”

The black-robed elder was startled and desperately moved, at the same time a lot of spiritual powers gathered and formed many layers of shields in front of him.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The jet-black arrow broke all of them effortlessly and eventually hit its target. However, the black-robed elder shook his body at the last moment and his left shoulder was pierced by the arrow instead of his heart.

“What a horrible shot! Who did it?”

Looking at the arrow inserted on his left shoulder, the black-robed elder feared and cast his eyes on the direction from where the jet-black arrow came in a great hurry.

Immediately, he saw a middle-aged hairy man on a slightly raised hill, who was wrapped in simple animal skin and held a longbow with a basket of arrows on his back, staring at him with sharp eagle-like eyes.

“You outsider do have a quick reaction.”

The middle-aged man said, but the next moment his body shook suddenly, making the black-robed elder panic again.

He transformed from a normal human to a five-meters body in a flash. His hands and feet became extremely brawny with pieces of muscles upheaved. His whole body skin turned into silver.

“Silver-armored Demon God!”

“Silver-armored Demon God of the Eternal Realm!”

At that sight, the black-robed elder was greatly frightened. Even the weakest Copper-armored Demon God was much stronger than any ordinary warrior, especially on raw attacking power and strength.

He would be unsure about fighting against a Copper-Armored Demon God. But now, in front of him was a Silver-Armored Demon God of the Eternal Realm, which made him lose all hope.

The once middle-age-looking man once again drew the big bow. When the Demon God was drawing the big bow…

A horrible power began to converge.

The power locked the black-robed elder in a flash, which made him turn pale and frightened.

“Run!”

He had no time to chase after Jian Wushuang, but immediately turned back and fled like crazy.

The moment he tried to run, the middle-aged man’s right hand quickly released the bow. A streak of sparkling black light ejected with a bounce and chased up the elder at a staggering speed, just like a huge comet dragging a long tail.

The black-robed elder tried his best to escape. However, the black light finally caught up with him and shot directly towards his chest.

The black-robed elder had nothing to do but turn around to withstand it with all his strength, even in virtue of one of his most precious treasures, a copper clock. Although the copper clock protected the black-robed elder’s life by covering his body, it was shattered by the arrow in an instant, barely giving his owner a little bit of time to escape his unavoidable fate.

The black-robed elder used this opportunity to escape from the sight of the middle-aged man, it was better to be alive without a treasure than dead.

“These outsiders do have a lot of tricks to save their lives. It’s really hard to kill them.”

The Silver-armored Demon God shook his head and sighed. Then, his body shocked again and diminished into the original hairy middle-aged man.

After that, he came straight to Jian Wushuang.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang had burnt out of all spiritual powers and half of his blood. It was so miserable. He fell down to the ground with only a hint of consciousness, but unable to move.

When the middle-aged man walked towards him, Jian Wushuang cast his eyes to the man.
