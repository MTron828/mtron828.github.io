“Celestial Master Yu Ding told me to visit Tang Emperor before going on an adventure on the battlefield…” Jian Wushuang murmured to himself.

He took out a token and said, “Grand-teacher!”

“Kid, has everything been all right since coming to Green Fire Palace?” Tang Emperor’s response was swift.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang smiled. He got straight to the point, saying, “Grand-teacher, I’m planning to adventure on the battlefield.”

“The battlefield? So soon?” Tang Emperor was a little surprised but nevertheless said, “Come to my palace.”

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Green Fire Palace was located on a huge floating land with many lofty mountains, each of which had a magnificent palace towering on the top.

Tang Emperor, as one of the Palace Masters of Green Fire Palace, lived in one of those palaces.

Jian Wushuang soon arrived at the palace and met Tang Emperor in the hall.

“Kid, I know you possess the battle strength of medium-level Celestial Master before coming to Green Fire Palace. You’ve improved so much since then. Nevertheless, you shouldn’t underestimate the battlefield. Not only are there many Jin Kingdom experts lying in the wait, but there are also many dangerous places there. It could turn fatal even for me.”

“You’re still too young and have enormous potential. Why not postpone your adventure until you become a Dao Master?” Tang Emperor asked, trying to persuade him.

“Grand-teacher, I’ve naturally taken those elements into consideration before daring to go on the adventure.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I see. I won’t force you to change your mind then. I’ve found out some information for you.?One of our Celestial Masters, Ghost Shadow, will be going to the battlefield soon. He’s currently cultivating a Secret Skill and won’t leave until 50 years later. You can wait for him to go with you. He also has the battle strength of medium-level Celestial Master. You can look after each other during your journey,” Tang Emperor said.

“Thank you, but I intend to go alone.” Jian Wushuang turned down the suggestion.

“Alone?” Tang Emperor frowned.

In his opinion, it would be risky even if Jian Wushuang went with Celestial Master Ghost Shadow. Yet Jian Wushuang wanted to adventure alone…

“Are you sure?” Tang Emperor could not stop himself from asking.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

He was quite aware of the dangers and would not have minded if Ghost Shadow could set off right now.

However, he would have to wait for 50 years since Ghost Shadow was still in cultivation.

Other Celestial Masters might not mind but that was quite a long time for him.

Besides, he was accustomed to adventuring by himself. The risks, on the other hand… The deceased Celestial Master Silver Moon, who also had the battle strength of a medium-level Celestial Master and strong only in terms of defense, dared to venture on the battlefield for a hundred million years.

Jian Wushuang was confident that he was much stronger than Silver Moon and had greater defensive power.

If even Silver Moon dared to venture alone, of course he would not lose to her.

“Since you’ve made up your mind, I won’t stop you. There are three objects that I give every expert who is going on an adventure on the battlefield. Look at them carefully.” With a wave of his hand, Tang Emperor summoned three Flowing Lights that flew toward Jian Wushuang.

The Flowing Lights floated in front of Jian Wushuang and he looked at them one by one.

The first was a map made of an Exotic Beast’s fur.

“This map was drawn based on the experience of the experts who had been exploring the battlefield for tens of millions of years,” Tang Emperor said.”Even though so much effort had been put into making this map, it nevertheless includes only a small part of the battlefield. Most of the battlefield is still uncharted territory.”

“Now that you’re going there, perhaps it’ll be of use to you.”

Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. He saw that many places, such as the three Secret Lands under the control of Green Fire Palace and Tai Qing Palace, were marked in the map. Many naturally dangerous places in the exploring areas were also marked out.

The parts of the map unmarked were obviously uncharted areas.

After all, the battlefield was too vast and unpredictable.

The area that Green Fire Palacehad explored for tens of thousands of years was just a small part of the entire battlefield.

Jian Wushuang turned to look at the second object.

It was a token.

“The token is used to seek assistance from people nearby in times of crisis,” Tang Emperor said.

“Assistance? People nearby?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Kid, you’re quite clear about the vastness of the battlefield. When our Celestial Masters are in trouble, such as being chased by Jin Kingdom experts, we wouldn’t able to send experts to rescue them in time. The token would make all the difference in such a scenario.”

“The token is used to seek help from nearby allies. Once the message is sent out, Green Fire Palace experts nearby would sense the message and your position through their Jade Stones. Then they’ll immediately come to your rescue.”

“However, it won’t work if there aren’t any of our people nearby,” Tang Emperor added.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile, indicating that he understood the usage of the token.

Finally, he looked at the third object.

It was a golden water bead. Jian Wushuang could sense the enormous power contained in it by merely looking at it and that power felt rather familiar.

“It’s the Ancient God Power!”

Gu King, who was in his body, pinpointed the origin of the bead before Tang Emperor could open his mouth.

“Ancient God Power? What’s that?” Jian Wushuang asked, frowning.

“It’s a power refined from the Ancient God Power. It’s the purest form of power and has multiple uses. Even among Ancient Gods, it takes one of a certain level to gather this power,” Gu King said in a solemn voice.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Tang Emperor explained, “The third object is the Ancient God Power, which contains the purest form of power. If you absorb it, you’ll experience a drastic improvement in your strength for a short period of time. For example, our Celestial Masters can double their strength after absorbing a drop of this power for a short time!”
