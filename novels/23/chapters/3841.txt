Chapter 3846: The Change of the Star Field

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hearing the final roar of Star River Master, Jian Wushuang shook his head lightly. “I didn’t lie to him. Shuang ‘er has only been a Principles Master for 800 years. It’s just that she has been taught by a supreme-being for the past 800 years.”

After killing Star River Master with a whip, Leng Rushuang casually took away Star River Master’s interspatial ring and returned to Jian Wushuang’s side. She said, “Next time, if you want me to train, you must find me a stronger opponent.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and asked, “Shuang ‘er, how many layers of waves did your whip create?”

He had experienced the power of Leng Rushuang’s whip before. Waves after waves of tsunamis came at him, one after another. It was indeed very powerful.

Star River Master had only endured three waves of tsunamis before he died.

“If master had used this whip, the tsunami would have never stopped. Unless I break the spell with force, the tsunami would have continued to attack. But now, I have barely mastered this move. Even if I use my full strength, I can only use the ninth impact at most,” Leng Rushuang said.

“The ninth impact is not bad.” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Three strikes easily killed Star River Master, who was at the peak of the six realms. Nine strikes were enough to rival an ordinary Ruler.

Killing Star River Master was just a side trip. Cultivators at Star River Master’s level, as well as those who escaped from the three Saint Realms, were no longer worthy of Jian Wushuang’s attention.

After that, Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang moved forward. Soon, they left Crimson Stone Mountain and returned to Star Palace.

“This is Star Palace?”

Leng Rushuang and Jian Wushuang walked side by side, looking around.

There were many cultivators in Star Palace, and they met many people along the way.

“Blood Sword Master!”

“Greetings, Blood Sword Master!”

The Principles Masters in Star Palace bowed to Jian Wushuang in awe.

After all, everyone knew that Jian Wushuang had the battle strength of a Superior Ruler and had survived the Dark Magic Region. He was definitely one of the strongest people in the Star Field, the Star Palace had benefited a lot from the presence of such a super expert. Of course, they were in awe of him.

Jian Wushuang took Leng Rushuang to see Daoist Xuan God and the others.

In the grand hall, Jian Wushuang met with Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and the Divine Ancestor.

“My young friend, is this your wife?” Daoist Xuan God asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Greetings, everyone.” Leng Rushuang greeted them, but she was much colder than Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, my young friend, congratulations,” Temporal Temple Master said with a smile.

He knew very well that Jian Wushuang had been trying to awaken his aura and soul and restore his wife’s divine body, but now he had achieved his goal.

Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly, then he said seriously, “Everyone, when I came back this time, I found that the number of Principles Masters in my Star Palace is much more than before, and the security seems to be much stricter than before.”

“It’s like this.” Daoist Xuan God nodded. “First of all, because of you, our Star Palace’s status in this Star Field has improved significantly. Over the years, many Principles Masters have come to our Star Palace voluntarily. Most of our Star Palace did not refuse, so naturally, the number of Principles Masters has increased. Now, there are more than a thousand Principles Masters under our Star Palace.”

“Thousands of Principles Masters?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Although there were many Principles Masters in this star area, they were extremely scattered. The main reason was that there were too many lone rangers, and there were also many different forces. There were over a thousand Principles Masters in this star area, that was not bad.

“But of course, the increase in the number of Lords of the edicts is only one of the reasons. The most important reason is that in recent years, some unforeseen events have occurred in this Star Field. It hasn’t been very peaceful. Just to be on the safe side, I’ve summoned back quite a few of the Lords of the edicts who have been adventuring in the three great battlefields of my Star Palace,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“There have been changes?” Jian Wushuang was moved, and he already had a guess in his heart.

“It’s like this,” Daoist Xuan God explained, “five hundred years ago, an expert suddenly appeared in this Star Field. He called himself Demon Monarch Ancient Night. My Star Palace specially went to collect information about this Demon Monarch Ancient Night, but we didn’t find any information about him. Therefore, we guessed that this Demon Monarch Ancient Night came from another Star Field.”

Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang looked at each other, but neither of them said anything.

They knew very well that since this Demon Monarch Ancient Night suddenly appeared 500 years ago, he was most likely the prisoner who had escaped from the Eternal Dark Prison.

“This Demon Monarch Ancient Night is very strong, very powerful, and extremely overbearing. After he appeared, he immediately swept through this Star Field. The first place he went to was the North Sea Palace. After arriving there, he directly commanded the North Sea Palace to submit to him in a strong manner. Naturally, the North Sea Palace would not agree,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“The North Sea Palace is one of the top three forces in the Star Field with the Sky Roc Ruler.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “What happened?”

“The North Sea Palace was wiped out by him alone. Even the Sky Roc Ruler was killed by Demon Monarch Ancient Night in one move,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He was not surprised that Demon Monarch Ancient Night could destroy the North Sea Palace, but to kill the Sky Roc Ruler in one move…

He had fought with the Sky Roc Ruler before. Although the latter was not a second-level Ruler, he was definitely at the top among the first-level Rulers. Moreover, he had the protection of the supreme true treasure armor, his body-protection ability should not be weak. How could he be killed in one move?

“It is very likely that Demon Monarch Ancient Night’s battle strength has reached the third-level,” Jian Wushuang thought. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The news of the destruction of the North Sea Palace and the death of Sky Roc Ruler has shocked the entire Star Field. After that, Demon Monarch Ancient Night continued to sweep through the Star Field. Now, almost all the major forces in the Star Field have chosen to submit to him. As for our Star Palace, although you are here, it has only been a short time since it rose to power. It is not a top major force in this Star Field. It seems that Demon Monarch Ancient Night does not like us, so he did not come to us.”

“Right now, this Demon Monarch Ancient Night has established the Ancient Night Demon Palace in the former North Sea Palace’s lair and has become the publicly acknowledged number one faction in this Star Field. His power is unparalleled, and no other faction can contend against him.”
