Chapter 3486 Sparring

“Chenhuo.” Jian Wushuang could not help looking at Demon Master Chenhuo.

“I’ve been lonely for too long. It’s rare for me to meet a decent opponent. How could I miss it?” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly. He could understand.

Before the Purple Star Demon Sect was destroyed, Demon Master Chenhuo was a genius. He was also very belligerent and liked to challenge experts everywhere.

rs.

After the destruction of the Purple Star Demon Sect, he stayed in the secret realm of heaven and earth for nearly 200 million years alone. Just as he said, he had been lonely for too long, and he had not had a good battle with anyone for a long time, even after he came out of the secret realm of heaven and earth, he still did not meet any opponents because he was too strong.

The only one he met was probably Da Ying from before.

However, after he made a breakthrough in that battle and reached a new level, an expert at Da Ying’s level was no longer qualified to be his opponent. Now, only experts at the pinnacle of the six void realms were qualified to be his opponent.

There were only three such experts in the entire Divine Beginning Realm, including him. It was too difficult to meet them.

Now that Elder Dark Bone was standing in front of him, he naturally did not want to miss this opportunity.

Knowing this, Jian Wushuang did not stop him.

“Elder Dark Bone, do you want to fight with me?” Demon Master Chenhuo asked directly.

Elder Dark Bone also looked at Demon Master Chenhuo with a strange look, but then he smiled slightly. “Experts at the pinnacle of the six void realms are indeed very difficult to meet in the Divine Beginning Realm unless they are in the Universe Battlefield. Now that we can meet one, it doesn’t matter if we fight.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Hearing this, the surrounding people could not help but become excited.

Elder Dark Bone had obviously accepted the challenge.

The fight between two experts at the pinnacle of the six void realms was certainly exciting.

“After all, we’re in the Nine-tailed Clan. I’m afraid we won’t be able to fight freely. Let’s find another place,” Elder Dark Bone said.

“Okay.” Demon Master Chenhuo nodded, and then the two directly rushed out of the ancestral land of the Nine-tailed Clan.

“Let’s go and take a look.”

Jian Wushuang, Life Fall King, Xiao’er, Axe One Master, Marquis Duan Yu, Star Saint Master, and Shadow Fox Master did not want to miss the battle and followed them.

They came to an empty space not far from the ancestral land of the Nine-tailed Clan. Then, they made way for a huge battlefield, with Demon Master Chenhuo and Elder Dark Bone standing in the center of the battlefield.

A golden fist glove appeared in the hands of Demon Master Chenhuo.

“This fist glove was given to me by Master when Purple Star Devil Sect was still around. Later, I found someone to refine and strengthen it. Finally, it was upgraded to a top-tier true treasure. Its name is Golden God!” Demon Master Chenhuo said indifferently.

“Top-tier true treasure?” Elder Dark Bone smiled. “A top-tier true treasure from the Divine Beginning Realm. It’s powerful, but it’s nothing compared to a universe true treasure. However, today’s battle is just a sparring match. To be fair, I won’t use a universe true treasure. I got this blade many years ago, but I’ve never used it since. I’ll use it to fight you today.”

As Elder Dark Bone spoke, a pitch-black blade appeared in his hand.

This blade looked ordinary, but anyone could feel a shocking coldness from it.

Without a doubt, this blade was also a top-tier true treasure, but it was clearly not Elder Dark Bone’s strongest godly weapon!

There was nothing he could do about it. Elder Dark Bone had lived for too long, and he often went to the Universe Battlefield to explore. He even had a lot of universe true treasures, many of which were more powerful than the top-tier true treasures in the absolute beginning godly world.

As for Demon Master Chenhuo, he had never been to the Universe Battlefield, and he had stayed in the universe secret region for a long time, so he had no chance to collect more powerful true treasures. The glove in his hand was indeed his most powerful godly weapon.

“Sinking fire, make your move,” Elder Dark Bone said with a faint smile. Even though he was facing Demon Master Chenhuo, who was at the same level as him and was at the pinnacle of the six levels of the void space, Elder Dark Bone still looked very relaxed, it was as if Demon Master Chenhuo was not really in his heart.

And Demon Master Chenhuo had also noticed this. Although he was not angry, he had already used his actions to express his dissatisfaction.

Boom!

A sudden explosion of air could be heard. The void where Demon Master Chenhuo was originally at had instantly turned into nothingness. His figure had already disappeared in that void, and when he reappeared...he had already arrived in front of Elder Dark Bone. At the same time, his right hand had already turned into a huge star, directly striking toward Elder Dark Bone.

When Elder Dark Bone saw this, he unhurriedly slashed out with his blade.

This blade was soft, as if it did not possess any power.

However, as the blade light passed by, an empty tunnel appeared.

In the blink of an eye, the fist of the Demon Master clashed with the blade light.

Peng!

The void exploded on the spot, and a black hole with a diameter of nearly 1,000 meters appeared in this vast world.

“Black hole?”

“What a huge black hole. This area is simply unbelievable!”

“The strongest expert of the six void realms is indeed...extraordinary!”

The surrounding six void realm Principles Masters who were watching the battle could not help but exclaim in admiration. Even though they were all at the six void realms, the gap between the ordinary six void realms and the pinnacle of the six void realms was too great.

One had to know, what was the pinnacle of the six void realms?

That was after one had completely grasped and fused the three principles, comprehended the fourth principle, and grasped the seventh portion of the power of the will!

But the ordinary six states of the void, including the experts at the peak of the six states of the void, only grasped six will’s power. Compared to the pinnacle of the six states of the void, there was one less will’s power, and the difference of one will’s power...how huge was it?

To put it bluntly, the pinnacle of the six states of the void actually did not belong to the scope of the six states of the void. Speaking of which, they could already be considered to have reached the seven states of the void!

They had an extra portion of will power compared to the six void realms. In terms of pure divine power, they were far above the six void realms.

Just like now, when the Demon Master and Elder Dark Bone were fighting, the two of them were clearly just casually attacking and did not use any ultimate moves or secret techniques. However, the power that burst out in that instant...caused the several experts of the six void realms present to be shocked.

The casual attack of the Demon Master and Elder Dark Bone was not something that ordinary void six stage experts like them could achieve. At the same time, it was also something that they could not withstand.

Hualala ~ ~

After the spatial black hole appeared, the void started to recover at a terrifying speed. Meanwhile, the Demon Master and Elder Dark Bone had already retreated.
