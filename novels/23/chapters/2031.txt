2032 Drastic Change!

The redheaded elder performed a shocking power against the sudden attack.

He held a saber in each hand. Both sabers brought churning blood clouds, then:

Bang! Bang!

There were two loud bangs. It was a battle of two against one, after all. On top of that, the two were truly Great Emperors. Especially when Abysmal Saint Master’s black spear attacked in madness, the redheaded elder could only retreat and he looked to be in a fix.

Before he could steady himself, Jian Wushuang’s sword principle attacked like a rainstorm.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo with four moves.

Mixed Elements Spirit was a defense skill.

Turn Monstrous At One Thought prioritized speed.

Blast Rainstorm focused on power.

Moved like strong wind with the momentum of rainstorm.

Especially with Jian Wushuang’s divine power along with his power of ancient tribe bloodline.

The power of the stroke was much stronger than Abysmal Saint Master’s spear had been.

“This boy!”

The redheaded elder stared. Previously, he had never cared about Jian Wushuang, who was only in early stage Chaotic Realm. Hence, he had only focused on Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao’s attacks.

But then, just as Jian Wushuang’s sword appeared before him, the redheaded elder stared with his eyes wide open.

Then, he quickly wielded his sabers to block.

Dang!

There was a loud thud.

Just as Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword and the redheaded elder’s saber collided, there was a burst of terrifying power. It then had a great impact on the redheaded elder’s body.

Although the redheaded elder was a Great Emperor, he quivered and spat a mouthful of blood.

His face instantly grew pale and his aura diminished tremendously.

“Well done, Jian Wushuang!”

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

Just then… Swoosh! Swoosh!

The man and the woman rushed to where they were at their fastest speed. Their Great Emperor aura pressed over simultaneously.

“Jiu Qiao and I will hold them back. Jian Wushuang, hurry up and go to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock,” Abysmal Saint Master roared.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded and didn’t hesitate at all.

He took a step forward but his figure plunged to the middle of the golden whirlpool, where the Emperor Supreme Rock was.

On the other hand, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao blocked the man and the woman in the first instant, including the redheaded elder who Jian Wushuang had severely injured. He was also held back by Abysmal Saint Master.

The three Great Emperors who guarded the golden whirlpool all year round were stopped while Jian Wushuang had no other hindrance.

After a short while, he arrived in the depth of the golden whirlpool, which was the hundred zhang tall, mountain-like Emperor Supreme Rock.

Jian Wushuang stood before Emperor Supreme Rock at a close distance and he felt the pure energy contained in the Emperor Supreme Rock.

The amount of pure energy it carried was far beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination.

The vastest pure energy that Jian Wushuang had ever seen was the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning that contained boundless Power of Absolute Beginning. Back then, he had relied on the Power of Absolute Beginning to enhance his divine power tremendously.

However, although the pure energy contained in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was boundless, it was far behind the huge Emperor Supreme Rock.

It was such terrifying pure energy. No wonder it could maintain the dark millstone to revolve in the outside world.

“As long as I destroy it, the dark millstone will stop. Eternal Chaotic World will have a chance to live. However, if it continues to exist, Eternal Chaotic World will vanish into thin air!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Jian Wushuang had no alternative, so he didn’t hesitate.

Vroom!!!

There was a burst of terrifying sword intention that swept out of Jian Wushuang’s body.

The sword intention carried a supreme vibe, just like the Emperor’s Sword.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power flowed out madly with the power of ancient tribe bloodline power.

However, just as he was going to perform sword principle to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock entirely…

Wow!

There was a dark axe shadow that descended without any symptoms.

The axe shadow brought about boundless extermination aura. The moment it appeared, it caught Jian Wushuang’s attention.

“This is...?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed. He had yet to store up enough energy for Emperor Sword Principle, but he swung the stroke anyway.

Dang!

There was a loud bang and the universe shook.

There was divine power as vast as an ocean that instantly swept over.

Jian Wushuang quivered and took a step back while his eyes looked in front of him.

Under the cover of the boundless ocean, somehow there was an extra figure.

He was only five foot two, but his body was muscular. His muscles bulged and gave out a raging vibe. He made people think that there was a living beast.

The beast was aiming at Jian Wushuang with his battleaxe.

“It’s him?” Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze.

The beast-like bald man was the strongest person among the six Great Emperors that had besieged him in front of Silver-Winged God Mansion back then.

His battleaxe skills were terrifying and his strength was fierce. His axe had injured Emperor Jiu Qiao so badly. In terms of power, he was much stronger than Abysmal Saint Master.

Then, the beast appeared in the depth of the golden whirlpool and attacked him when he was about to destroy Emperor Supreme Rock.

“How? Why is he here?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“It seems that my appearance has surprised Sword Emperor?” The beast-like bald man, Ling Zong, smirked coldly at Jian Wushuang. Even though Jian Wushuang still maintained his appearance of a brawny man, Ling Zong had instantly recognized him.

“Actually, I have been waiting for you, Sword Emperor. I have been waiting for a very long time. Oh no, not I, I should say, we.”

As Ling Zong smiled, another three figures instantly appeared behind him. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The three figures gave out an aura that had already reached Peak Chaotic Realm. On top of that, Jian Wushuang had already seen the three of them in Silver-Winged God Mansion before. Among the three, one of them was the purple-haired man with purple eyes, Zi Chen.

“Sword Emperor, we have been waiting for you,” the purple-haired man with purple eyes, Zi Chen, spoke.

Jian Wushuang’s looked distressed. He looked at the scene before him. No matter how stupid a person was, they should be able to tell that he had fallen into a trap.

The four people in front of him were waiting for him in the middle of the golden whirlpool. They were waiting for him to take action, to walk right into the trap.

It was a trap.

Now, he was in the middle of the trap.
