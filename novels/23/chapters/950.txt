Chapter 951: Alive

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?”

Xia Yong jumped, startled by Gu King who was beside him.

Gu King’s former body was tens of meters long. But it had grown into a slithery mass ten-fold longer than before with a sharp increase in strength as Jian Wushuang absorbed thirty percent of blood essense power and had four stars agglomerated between his eyebrows.

By now, Gu King’s massive trunk coiled not far away from Xia Yong, his jaws baring in a wide and wicked grin.

“The Divine Rays of the Nine Tunes technique of the Plenilune Secret Skills!”

Gu King emitted a deafening howl. His wide-opened mouth glowed brightly in red with bloodthirsty malice and he hurled himself towards Xia Yong.

“Swish!”

The red glow flaring from his mouth formed a streaking crimson flash as it shot straight at Xia Yong at great speeds, aiming at the latter’s head.

“This is bad!”

Panic and fear instantly swept across Xia Yong’s mangled face. Overcame by horror, he staggered backward.

Xia Yong managed to keep himself out of the way of the flaming serpentine behemoth charging at him, but his lurch backward was also his undoing: it had sent him into the path of Jian Wushuang’s finger, the World-shattering technique!

“Die, Xia Yong, you filthy mongrel!” Jian Wushuang’s roar echoed loudly.

“Rumble!”?The finger technique that could shudder even the foundations of the world has appeared! The World-shattering technique! A gigantic finger of gold struck heavily upon Xia Yong, releasing the powerful Ancient God Power contained within its stroke!

“Noooo!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Xia Yong gave a terrifying shriek, his eyes utterly wide with shock as the gargantuan finger of gold crushed down on him.

The golden finger pushed and flattened Xia Yong, delving deep into the ground.

“Bang!”

A huge crater was formed where the golden finger had struck. A huge hole was in the center of the crater where the finger had burrowed, growing larger as the huge force continued tunneling downwards.

The grounds began to shake and the sky began to tremble.

But everything fell into a pale and deathly silence.

The entire surrounding had been engulfed by a huge and strong cyclonic turbulence of raw energy.

So great and terrible was the tempestuous storm of crude energies that even the Dao Masters from both sides of the battle panicked and retreated at once.

It was only when the storm had ended did anyone dare to venture a slight peek.

But the quick peek rendered everyone stunned.

The great and majestic royal palace was no more. What remained at where it stood before was but a wide and frightening pit, which depths extended far into the unknown reaches of the darkness.

The site where the entire royal city had once stood had been reduced into a bottomless abyss.

Deep at the bottom of the pit, there was nothing but ruins and rubble.

Stunning!

The same sensation of amazement and awe crept into the hearts of everyone present.

Suddenly, a jet of blood-red stream shot from the bottom of the pit. One could hardly miss the vestiges of life in it, albeit panic and hysterical, as the blood-red jet escaped from the pit and flew towards the encampment of the Xia Clan.

The blood-red stream fell into a blob of bloody mass beside Xia Tao before it formed into the figure of a person.

The person has hair of snowy white, despite having a few remaining grew and silvery hairs which were once testament of his youth and vigor. His face turned gnarled and wrinkle as if the long years his toil and torments of Life have caught up with him. His dry and rumpled skin was drenched in blood. But most disheartening of all, was his aura.

It was feeble; feeble and pitiful.

So feeble that it was not even the strength of a Dao Master.

These were the signs of one who had Death looming over him.

But everyone around him was gripped by fear and horror, for they had identified him: Xia Yong, the Ancestor of the Xia Clan! The greatest warrior of the entire Xia Clan!

“Ancestor!!”

The host of warriors of the Xia Clan were startled and angered at the wretched state rendered to their ancestor, Xia Yong.

Xia Yong had always remained as a legend even amongst the folk of their kin.

A legend who had always been unbeatable and indomitable against foes of any kind.

Even the Tang Empire of the East, during their golden age where the four great emperors reigned as one, had to fear their influence and might due to the dominance of their ancestor, Xia Yong.

Yet, who would have expected that the living legend of the Xia Clan had been battered to such insignificance?

The foe whom their ancestor was fighting against was but a mere warrior of the Eternal Realm!

How did a warrior of the Eternal Realm pummel a Holy Master into such a wreck?

How was this even possible!

It was the very same questions looming in the minds of everyone present.

Xia Yong face was flushed with a burning-red shade that he looked as if he could almost bleed from his face. His hateful stare remained transfixed upon the center of the huge pit from whence he emerged. A figure appeared from the depths. That was a lumbering giant, towering at more than tens of meters tall. His skin glazed with a golden blush and underneath his feet, was a worm beast more than hundreds of meters long with countless tendrils that exuded a powerful and staggering presence.

“That mongrel pup… to think that I have nearly fallen by his hands!” Xia Yong clenched his fists tightly with hatred as his eyes burned with rage.

Standing over the gargantuan trunk of Gu King, the resentment that filled Jian Wushuang had barely diminished. Embers of anger still burned in his golden eyes which were trained at Xia Yong’s direction.

“That stroke earlier did not kill him?” Jian Wushuang thought bitterly.

“That must be a quaint and unique technique that he used to save himself. But it must surely have come at a terrible price. Look at him. Look at how weakened he is now. He will never regain his power, not in tens of thousands of years, or even longer.” Gu King’s voice rumbled in his mind.

The greater one was, the harder one fell; and it would be harder still for that one to climb back up.

This was like King Gu Tong who had been seriously injured and his power diminished. For many years he had been trying to regain his strength as he chose to remain only within the confines of the stronghold of the Ancient Sect. But for so long, he had merely regained one-tenth of his former strength.

“Xia Yong must die!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flared with contempt and hate. But he had only begun to move when his body shook and convulsed suddenly with pain. He vomited a huge mouthful of blood as a strong, stabbing agony rose from the deepest parts of his body.

“This is madness, Jian Wushuang!”

The Gu King warned frantically, “The Essence Blood of King Luo Zhen is a most potent substance that bestows upon you powers way beyond that of yours for a short duration. But the price that follows its use is hardly one that you can easily bear! Look at your now! You are at your limits! There is no way you can continue fighting! Retreat for now!”

“Never!” Jian Wushuang howled with anger, his eyes gleaming in red. Much of his consciousness and sanity have left him, eroded by immeasurable bloodthirstiness and rage.

“This ends today! I will slay Xia Yong and completely decimate the entire Xia Clan even if it costs my life! This is for Leng Rushuang!”

There was nothing but steely resolve in his voice that thundered across the land. With all the consciousness and strength he could muster, he set his aims for the Essence Blood of King Luo Zhen.

He intended to consume more Essence Blood to further enhance himself!

“Don’t be rash, Jian Wushuang! Calm yourself!”

“Your lover, she is still alive!”

Jian Wushuang froze instantly where he stood as the Gu King’s frantic pleas reverberated continuously in his mind.
