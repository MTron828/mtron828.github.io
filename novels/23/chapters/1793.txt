Green Fire Palace, outside the huge war fortress, over ten crimson-dressed figures stood there arrogantly. The three leading figures were all Universe Gods and the rest were all Universe Masters.

Swoosh!

A grey-dressed elderly flew out from the war fortress. The grey-dressed elderly was a Universe God from Green Fire Palace.

“Devil Church, what are you doing here?” The grey-dressed elderly looked at over ten people before him and he looked distressed.

“The Master of Devil Church told us to pass you this list. Our Master instructed Green Fire Palace to gather all the treasures on the list within a year. If you fail to do so, we will compensate it with the lives of the experts from Green Fire Palace,” a purple-haired Universe God that led the group from Devil Church said coldly.

“B*stard!” The grey-dressed elderly looked at the treasures on the list and grew furious.

“Why? You Green Fire Palace has the guts to go against our Mister Blood Devil’s order?” The purple-haired Universe God glanced at the grey-dressed elderly and he looked in disdain.

Hearing Mister Blood Devil’s name, the grey-dressed elderly quivered in fear. He held back his anger but didn’t lose his temper.

Then, in the war fortress, many figures gathered and watched the scene outside with layers of prohibition behind the war fortress.

“These are the people from Devil Church?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze grew cold.

“Yes,” Wang Yuan nodded, “All these years, Devil Church grew stronger day by day. Besides the strongest thirteen Blood Devils, there are many experts under their command. The experts are mostly people who are of an evil disposition. For instance, the Universe God who was talking just then is truly a demon. He once massacred wantonly in Green Fire World. Then, Void Temple got angry and wanted to kill him. He was a person hated by everyone. After that, he joined Devil Church and has thirteen Blood Devils as his backers, so he behaves even more wantonly.”

“As for the list he gave… Devil Church will give us a list every once in a while and they want Green Fire Palace to gather the treasure and resources on the list in a given time. In the beginning, the treasure and resources that they asked for weren’t much, so Green Fire Palace dismissed them like the plague. However, the treasure and resources that Devil Church asked for are becoming more and more. They are simply treating Green Fire Palace as a treasury!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, “Tell the Universe God from Green Fire Palace to come back.”

“Mm,” Wang Yuan nodded and sent a message to the grey-dressed elderly.

Very soon, the grey-dressed elderly returned to the war fortress. The experts of Devil Church awaited Green Fire Palace’s reply.

Just then…

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures that appeared in front of the experts from Devil Church from nowhere.

“Die!”

A low bellow and a cold-looking young man who was carrying a sword attacked.

Just a simple swing lit up the universe. There were over ten experts from Devil Church and the strongest among them was only a Universe God in the First Heaven. In He Xiu’s eyes, they were a nonentity. They had yet to respond and they were killed by the sword light straight away.

Over ten experts from Devil Church died with one stroke. Then, He Xiu and Qiu Yue walked into the war fortress.

He Xiu and Qiu Yue walked through the prohibition and came before Jian Wushuang to bow politely.

“Old Three, these two are?” Wang Yuan looked at the two of them in shock.

“One of them is my disciple and the other one is my maidservant,” Jian Wushuang introduced calmly.

“Disciple? Maidservant?” Everyone was surprised.

His disciple was already this strong. Just how strong was he, as the master?

“Boss Wang Yuan, get me detailed information about Devil Church, including the locations of the thirteen Blood Devils, their relatives, friends, and experts under their command,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sure,” Wang Yuan nodded and said, “Old Three, those people earlier were sent by the thirteen Blood Devils. Now that they’re dead, the thirteen Blood Devils definitely know. If not mistaken, in no time, they will be here.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang smirked coldly, “Let them come then.”

Green Fire Palace was well-founded in Green Fire World. Even though they were suppressed by Devil Church all these years, the inside information was not something Devil Church could compare to.

In terms of information, they were far ahead of Devil Church.

According to Jian Wushuang’s instructions, Green Fire Palace’s huge information system immediately started to operate.

At the same time, the thirteen Blood Devils in Green Fire World had already received the news that the people that they had sent were killed.

The thirteen Blood Devils were furious.

“Humph, Green Fire Palace, they have guts!”

“They thought they control the formation and we of Devil Church would not dare to touch them? Such a joke!”

“It seems that we didn’t attack for many years and Green Fire Palace isn’t as fearful of us as before. Let’s carry out a massacre.”

“Old Nine, you take care of this.”

Among the thirteen Blood Devils, the one who was in the ninth place departed personally to Green Fire Palace.

Although they only sent one person, the Blood Devils weren’t worried at all.

After all, the thirteen Blood Devils were all supreme existences in Green Fire World. One person’s strength alone was sufficient to wipe out the entire Green Fire Palace!

In no time, the Blood Devil in the ninth place arrived outside the war fortress.

“Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, you two rubbish, come and die!”

A hoarse yet disdainful voice was heard from the Blood Devil’s mouth. It rang across the universe and traveled into the war fortress.

Green Fire Palace was led by Jian Nantian and Wang Yuan.

Jian Nantia was the strongest while Wang Yuan was best at making elixirs.

In the war fortress, under the layers of prohibitions, there were a large number of figures standing there.

These were all experts from Green Fire Palace. There was a total of a few thousand people. The experts could see the Blood Devil with the prohibition in between.

They could feel the terrifying aura soaring from the Blood Devil and they looked pale.

“Too strong!”

“The thirteen Blood Devils, any one of them is an unrivaled existence!”

“It is said that when the thirteen Blood Devils destroyed Tang of the East, only one Blood Devil fought. He killed all the higher-ups of Tang of the East with a snap of his fingers.”

“With us Green Fire Palace alone, how could we withstand the Blood Devils?”

Most of the people in Green Fire World didn’t know Jian Wushuang had returned.

Even if they knew, they weren’t confident.

After all, they had never seen Jian Wushuang in action.

However, they had experienced the scariness of the Blood Devil in Green Fire World long ago.

Just as everyone was quivering in fear, there was a figure in the war fortress that flew out. He flew in front of the Blood Devil.

He was in a crimson robe, carrying a sword. His face was cold, as though it had been covered with a layer of frost.

The moment he appeared, he immediately became the attention of the universe. Everyone couldn’t help but look at him.
