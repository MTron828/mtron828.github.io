Chapter 2296 The Reason behind Everything Part III

“Soon after I created the Universal Dao Scripture, the second Inverse Cultivation expert from Green Fire World was you!”Jian Wushuang read on. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“This time, with my two attempts behind me, I was confident. I prepared myself and handed you the Universal Dao Scripture personally.”

“Long before you were born, when that Inverse Cultivation pearl landed at the Ancient Worlds where you were born, I was waiting for you already. So as to prevent suspicion from others, I joined the Ancient Sect as an Eternal Realm cultivator and took in three Lineal Disciples.”

“I only took the three in because I liked them, I helped them too, but their achievements were completely based on their own effort. After waiting for tens of thousands of years, you were born, and soon stepped into the path of Inverse Cultivation.”

“The next bit was obvious. After you arrived at Green Fire Palace, I took you in as the Ancient Sect Sword Palace Master and passed you the Universal Dao Scripture. As you grew, I passed you the Blood Mountain Sword and Mountain River Map as well.”

“As the Jin Kingdom problem appeared, I had to do something about it, but that would have exposed a lot about me, so the logical decision then was to disappear in front of you.”

“I split my willpower into two, one disappeared in front of you, the other hid inside the Mountain River Map and watched you grow. I could save you when needed that way.”

Xuan Yi did not mention it, but Xuan Yi had helped him multiple times when he was at the brink of death back at the Eternal Chaotic World.

Like at the Eighth Lair, against countless Star Demon Clansmen, Xuan Yi had secretly passed Secret Skills of Star Palace’s powers to that stand-alone space for Long Qi to discover and help Jian Wushuang.

Like at the Buddhist Demon Sea, against Acheron Palace, at the brink of death Xuan Yi secretly released Mountain River Map’s powers out, awakening Old Monster Jiao and One-Star Man. One-Star Man had even passed Jian Wushuang an opportunity because he had sensed Xuan Yi’s aura.

At the Ancient battlefield near Green Fire World, at the Chillywind Valley where Jian Wushuang had first met Emperor Thirteen, not only had he not killed him, but he had left a mark on him as well, and that was because he could sense Xuan Yi’s consciousness within the Mountain River Map.

“Your growth was faster than expected. When you reached Perfect Chaotic Holy Body, my consciousness in the Mountain River Map could sense that you were different from Emperor Qing and Emperor Bai. You had everything needed to become a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.”

“I knew you were the one I’d been looking for!”

“But, to become the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, there would be one more step – Inverse Cultivation’s eighth step. Reincarnation!”

“Only with that move can you truly be born into the Absolute Beginning Divine World as a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.”

“I started making preparations.”

“When the Eternal Chaotic World fought against the Three Emperors World, I appeared not only to help you suppress Blood Emperor but also to send Emperor Thirteen a message. I got him to make preparations, to prepare a small-scale reincarnation.”

“The small-scale reincarnation was in the Reincarnation Pearl. Emperor Thirteen used One-Star Man to pass it to you, to let you think it was a simple treasure used to understand Reincarnation Rules of Order, but it was the key to everything.”

“After that, I heard that the Masters of Holy Land from the Absolute Beginning Divine World were about to open a link passage at Heaven’s Horizon. Just in time.”

“After all, even though the small-scale reincarnation had been set up, it still needed to link to the Absolute Beginning Divine World. It was hard for even Emperor Thirteen, One-Star Man and the others to link due to the restrictions. But if they opened it from the other side, that would be a whole new story.”

“Thus, the perfect plan was formed.”

“While they open the link passage, I would open the reincarnation passage for you.”

“But there was a catch. I could only send your soul in, not your body. The soul that enters the reincarnation passage must be at peace as well, with no signs of resistance. The best way was for your soul to sleep first, but it would be difficult for you if your soul was not hurt.”

“There was only one way to do it: you would die, and I would revive your soul via Spacetime Reversal.”

Jian Wushuang did not know how to feel.

At the same time, the many questions he had had were resolved.

“That’s the reason...”

His master Xuan Yi, in order to release Seven Star Divine Realm from its predicament, had created the Inverse Cultivation system to find the second Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.

The birth of Green Fire World, and everything before it, had been for that one motive.

Emperor Bai and the other Inverse Cultivators in the Eternal Chaotic World were simply failed products of Xuan Yi’s.

And there were eight steps in Inverse Cultivation.

Jian Wushuang had already reached the pinnacle seventh step. But the last step needed reincarnation.

Leading to the deliberate plans made by Xuan Yi, Emperor Thirteen, and One-Star Man.

Their calculations had even taken into account the use of the power of the three Masters of Holy Land to open Absolute Beginning Divine World’s reincarnation passage, sending Jian Wushuang over.

This had been Xuan Yi’s motive from the very beginning, since the Ancient Era.
