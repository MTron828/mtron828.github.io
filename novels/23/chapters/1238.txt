Inside the Battle Fortress.

Bam… Jian Wushuang had been violently shaking, but now, he finally quieted down.

After he fully calmed himself, Jian Wushuang’s body took on a faint golden glow.

This golden glow came with expansive aura.

“This is… the Divine Light?”?Gu King was shocked.?“How is it possible?

“Didn’t he combine three strongest Sword Principles and acquire the Immortal Dharma Body? How can there be a Divine Light?

“Didn’t he cultivate the Immortal Divine Body instead of the Immortal Dharma Body?”

Knowledgeable as Gu King, he could not help but find Jian Wushuang’s change shocking.

Combine the Sword Principles, cultivate the Immortal Dharma Body, and finally become a Celestial Master!

After that, transform the Immortal Dharma Body for the second time, form the Immortal Divine Body, and become a Universe Master!

The body of a Universe Master was already a real deal Divine Body!

But now, Jian Wushuang’s body took on a golden Divine Light, which only belonged to an Immortal Divine Body.

After the transformation, Jian Wushuang’s body had exceeded the Immortal Dharma Body and became an Immortal Divine Body!

With the Immortal Divine Body, Jian Wushuang did not fall into the category of Celestial Master anymore, but a Universe Master!

“He had become a Universe Master in leaps and bounds? Is that what an Inverse Cultivator can do?”?Gu King gasped.

In addition, he not only transformed his body, but also the Soul Fire within his sea of consciousness!

The Soul Fire inside him had been very fragile, but after the transformation, the Soul Fire was more than ten times stronger than before. The Soul Power was completely transformed as well.

Inside the Battle Fortress, sitting on the ground cross-legged, Jian Wushuang finally opened his eyes.

At the moment, a fierce light shot out. It was so sharp that it could even chill a Universe Master’s bones. Then, the fierce light directly tore apart the Void in its way.

Jian Wushuang slowly stood up, and he heard his bones crackling.

He had not sat for a long time, but he felt as if he had been sitting for hundreds of millions of years.

“Jian Wushuang, how are you feeling now?” Gu King suddenly asked.

“How am I feeling now?” Jian Wushuang paused and continued, “I feel very strong!”

“Strong?” Gu King was dazed.

However, Jian Wushuang just ignored him and flew out. Soon, he showed up outside the Battle Fortress.

Jian Wushuang appeared on the battlefield. He stood in the Void on the top and brought forth the Strength of Soul from his sea of consciousness. Immediately, he had covered the vast battlefield with his Soul Power.

Everyone and everything on the battlefield were projected in his mind.

At the same time, people on the battlefield immediately spotted him.

“Jian Wushuang!!! ”

“Palace Master Wushuang!!! ”

“It is Palace Master Wushuang!”

On the battlefield, numerous people exclaimed and fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Shuanger!”

At the core of the battlefield, a cyan-dressed man who was surrounded by four Universe Masters looked up in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

This man was no other than Jian Wushuang’s master, Jian Nantian. At this moment, only his upper half body remained, his legs had been cut off. However, he still managed to fight against four Jin Kingdom Universe Masters.

When he saw Jian Wushuang, he smiled thoughtfully.

…

“Jian Wushuang!”

The white-haired Tang Emperor, who grew a cinnabar mole between his eyebrows, was covered in blood. His aura had decreased to the lowest point. The elixir’s strength and his resentment supported him to continue killing.

At this moment, Tang Emperor also looked at Jian Wushuang.

…

On the ground below, Emperor Xiao, who had broken through to be a Celestial Master laid in a pool of blood. Only half of his body remained, but he managed to survive. He was trying his best to heal himself, in order to get on the battlefield again, to kill the Jin Kingdom experts again.

When Jian Wushuang walked out of the Battle Fortress, Emperor Xiao saw him too.

“Jian Wushuang, my good son-in-law, you finally wake up!”

…

In a place on the battlefield, a man and a woman were leaning against each other. Around them, 13 Jin Kingdom experts gathered.

They were Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou!

Yang Zaixuan had completely changed to a dragon-man. Su Rou had opened her Asura eyes as well. Their auras looked weak. Obviously, they had reached a point where they could not carry on.

But now, they all saw Jian Wushuang in the distance.

Then, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou both smiled.

“Brother, we’ve been waiting for you for a long time!”

…

Covered in blood, a man beyond recognition stood in the center of the battlefield.

He held a saber in one hand, and a Battle Axe in the other. He used two magic weapons to fight against the Jin Kingdom experts.

He was Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian!

Xue Lingtian used sabers. The Battle Axe he held used to belong to the deceased Bai Hu.

Among Jian Wushuang’s three Senior Brothers, only Xue Lingtian survived!

“Junior brother, it’s your turn!”

…

“Jian Wushuang!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Palace Master Wushuang!”

Everyone from the Green Fire World looked at Jian Wushuang.

He was their last hope.

Jian Wushaung had witnessed everything on the battlefield. He saw their weak auras, their moanings, and lingering hope.

He could even hear the whole Green Fire World roaring.

At the same time, he also sensed the already lost, disappeared auras.

“Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, Red Lotus Palace Master!” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Third Senior Brother, Emperor Yun, Huo Qiong, Palace Master Su Qian, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, and Ape Celestial Master…”

“Do we lost all of them?”

Jian Wushuang clenched both hands, and his heart was beating violently.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

His heart beat like a drum.

Gradually, Jian Wushuang’s face was twisting.

“The Jin Kingdom!”

Jian Wushuang roared, even his soul spat these two words!

Fury!

Unprecedented fury filled Jian Wushang’s mind and soul in an instant!

Fury could make him lose it!!!
