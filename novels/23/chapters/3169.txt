Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

“In the Divine Beginning Realm, the Temporal Temple, one of the three Freedom Alliances, only has more than 1,000 experts under its command?”

“How is this possible?”

Jian Wushuang’s face was full of disbelief.

Not to mention a behemoth like the Temporal Temple, even the ordinary sects in the Divine Beginning Realm had countless disciples and experts as long as they were slightly stronger and had some foundation?

Some large sects or forces had hundreds of thousands of cultivators under their command or even millions of them.

For example, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance had an unknown number of core experts and disciples, and if the outer experts were included, there were countless of them.

It was the same for many sects, but the Temporal Temple, which was worthy of the name of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, only had more than 1,000 cultivators under its command?

That was too few.

“The number of cultivators in the Temporal Temple is indeed not many. It is far inferior to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. It is even inferior to many ordinary forces in the Divine Beginning World. However, the strength of a force is not determined by the number of cultivators in the period,” Temple Master Bai Xing said with a smile.

“It is true that there are only more than 1,000 cultivators in the Temporal Temple, but these cultivators are all very powerful. Ordinary people are not qualified to enter the Temporal Temple.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Obviously, the Temporal Temple paid attention to the quality of the cultivators.

Temple Master Bai Xing raised his hand slightly, and a brand-new divine throne immediately floated out.

“Little guy, transfer a trace of your life aura into this divine throne,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and immediately transferred a trace of his life aura into the divine throne. After the Blood Aura entered the divine throne, Jian Wushuang immediately had a special connection with the divine throne.

“Now that you have your own divine seat, from today onwards, you will officially join the Temporal Temple. This divine seat represents you and will be placed here in the future. Because of this divine seat, you will also have a certain connection with the experts of our Temporal Temple.” Temple Master Bai Xing looked over.

After his divine throne was formed, he had a special connection with Temple Master Bai Xing and Ba Cang.

This connection could only be found among cultivators who belonged to the Temporal Temple.

“Little guy, you have to remember that although the number of cultivators in our Temporal Temple is very small, our Temporal Temple is still able to become one of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning World. Moreover, we are feared by all the sects and powers. This is not only because we have many top experts and special means, but most importantly, the cultivators in our Temporal Temple are very united!

“Kill!” Palace Master Bai Xing said.

“The cultivators of the Temporal Temple never kill each other. Anyone who kills each other will be executed. If they meet each other while they are traveling, they will help each other. If anyone is in danger while they are traveling, countless cultivators of the Temporal Temple will try their best to find a camp!”

“At the same time, if anyone dares to kill the cultivators of our Temporal Temple, all the top experts of our Temporal Temple will rush forward!”

“Because of this, no one in the Divine Beginning Realm dares to mess with our Temporal Temple! Even a weaker True Saint under our Temporal Temple can do whatever he wants when he’s out there.”

“Many years ago, when the Temple Master created the Temporal Temple, he told us that if any cultivators from the Temporal Temple were to clash with experts from other forces while they were traveling outside, we should win first. We don’t need to care about the consequences. We have the support of the entire Temporal Temple!”

Jian Wushuang’s blood boiled when he heard Temple Master Bai Xing’s words.

If they were to clash with experts from other forces, should they not win first? Should the Temporal Temple bear all the consequences?

How domineering was this!

This was the confidence that a super force should have.

“You must remember what I said. If you go out in the future, don’t embarrass the Temporal Temple,” Temple Master Bai Xing said with a smile. “Alright, let’s go out.”

Temple Master Bai Xing immediately led Jian Wushuang out of the palace.

After they walked out of the palace, Ba Cang spoke directly, “Temple Master Bai Xing, this little guy is now a member of my Temporal Temple. My task has been completed, so I’ll take my leave. As for the rest of the matter, I’ll leave it to you to tell this little guy.”

“Okay.” Temple Master Bai Xing nodded slightly.

“Kid, cultivate well. I’m looking forward to your growth in the future.” Ba Cang grinned at Jian Wushuang and left in a flash.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’ll take you to the spacetime island. There are a lot of opportunities on the island, and I’ll introduce them to you one by one,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Opportunities?” Jian Wushuang was full of expectation.

Under the personal guidance of Temple Master Bai Xing, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at the center of the island.

When he arrived, he saw a huge open space. On the open space was the Time-space Beast God, which was so huge that even Jian Wushuang was shocked!

Even though this time Beast God was crawling, its huge size still occupied one-tenth of the entire island.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had only looked at this Space-time Beast God from afar and was not that shocked. But now, Temple Master Bai Xing brought him to the front of the Space-time Beast God and looked at it, Jian Wushuang could not help feeling numb.

“Little guy, the Space-time Beast God in front of you is one of the many opportunities on the time-space Island,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“This Time-space Beast God is an opportunity?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Of course, it’s an opportunity. Look carefully at the scales on the Time-space Beast God,” Temple Master Bai Xing said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked over.

The enormous Space-time beast God had more than 10,000 scales, and each scale was not small.

Jian Wushuang focused his attention on one of the scales. In just a moment, he felt a strong power of space-time principles from the scale.

“Space-time principles, it’s really space-time principles. There are a lot of space-time principles in this scale, and these principles are very unique.” Jian Wushuang frowned, he could feel that the power of the space-time principles in the scale was arranged in a very special pattern. The arrangement was from shallow to deep, and it was completely step-by-step for people to comprehend.

“This feeling doesn’t feel like dissection, but more like dividing the space-time principles step by step?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Dividing and dissection were very similar. They both made the originally complex and difficult rules of heaven and earth easier to comprehend..
