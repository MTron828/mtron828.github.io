Chapter 2142 Seeking Reinforcements

Boom!Jian Wushuang was like a Devil and he found the gap among the various great emperors easily. He dashed in front of a young man in purple armour.

Sword light with incredible power stormed down upon the young man.

The young man tried to deflect the attacks, but was too slow. All he could do was watch the sword light penetrate his armor and mercilessly smash his divine body. He died instantly.

“The third one!” Jian Wushuang looked stern with a strong killing intent.

All the great emperors turned pale when they saw yet another of their comrades dead.

They wanted to cooperate and kill Jian Wushuang. However, three of them had died before they could even harm him.

“Seek reinforcements! There is nothing we can do to stop him. If this continues, everyone here will die!”

“We cannot stop him unless more Peak Chaotic Realm experts join us or the three leaders come down personally to stop him.”

“He is disgustingly powerful.”

Roars reverberated around this battlefield.

Within the short time that they exchanged blows, the great emperors were intimidated.

Among the great emperors, Ling Zong too was studying the situation.

While they were fighting Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, Jian Yi and King Chen Xing were still killing experts.

They were going at such a fast pace that at least a thousand of them died.

There were no remaining almighties around the three statues, hence they turned their focus to the remains of the Imperial Palace.

If the killing continued, every single cultivator within the Imperial Palace would be dead. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Lord, lord!”

“Help us quickly!”

Ling Zong frowned as he urged the leaders.

The massacre continued within the Imperial Palace.

In the mysterious void in the Three Emperors World, four figures gathered together.

They were Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu and Leng Ruxue.

When the Imperial Palace was attacked, they had received the news immediately.

“This Jian Wushuang. He was lucky he managed to escape the othe time. Now he dares to attack us in the Imperial Palace again?” Demon King Chen Yu clenched his fist as he was burning with rage.

Kaiser Blood, who was covered in a blood-red cloak, looked cold.

“The previous failures, especially the battle at the Heaven Repairing Palace, allowed the Sanctuary Alliance to have five more great emperors while we lost three of our own. Our advantage in numbers is no longer here.”

“Now, the Eternal Chaotic Worldsent has a small team of experts to ambush the Imperial Palace and kill our experts. If they were successful in doing so and escaped unharmed, we would be at a disadvantage. We cannot allow this to happen!”

“Immediately order experts to reinforce!”

Kaiser Blood ordered immediately.

Demon King Chen Yu stood up and said, “I have already asked Ba Su to rush over as fast as he can. He can hold Jian Wushuang there for a while. I will go down personally. I will not let that brat escape again!!”

Demong King Chen Yu disappeared from the mysterious void and headed for the Imperial Palace.

Kaiser Blood looked at where Demon King Chen Yu was and knitted his eyebrows.

Demon King Chen Yu had already sworn to kill Jian Wushuang many times and to cause great damage to the lineup of the Eternal Chaotic World.

What were the results?

He had failed every single time and returned defeated.

Kaiser Blood started questioning his abilities.

Even though he did not stop Demon King Chen Yu, he turned to Lord Fen and said, “Lord Fen. You will reinforce Demon King Chen Yu personally. Bring along experts from the Holocaust Sect as well. I have received news that Jian Wushuang and his team have already killed many of our experts. We cannot allow that group to escape unharmed. We will be at a severe disadvantage if that happens.”

“Understood. I will go there as fast as I can.”

He and Leng Ruxue disappeared from the palace.

Kaiser Blood was the only person left. He sat there in a gloomy mood. His finger was hitting the chair lightly.

What was he thinking about?

…

Within the Imperial Palace, the massacre continued.

There were nine great emperors: Abysmal Saint Master, Jian Yi, Underworld God, King Chen Xing, Black Dragon Emperor, Emperor God Tian Ling and Lei Yuan who were responsible for it.

The entire Imperial Palace was in a storm.

The great emperors who were on guard within the palace was stopped by Jian Wushuang alone and could do nothing to help the others

Most importantly, there had been sixteen to begin with. Now, only thirteen were left.

More than half of the thirteen great emperors had been injured by Jian Wushuang.

Even though Jian Wushuang was alone, he had completely suppressed these great emperors.

Right when he was about to kill the fourth great emperor…

Boom!

In the distance, a figure that radiated a tremendous aura was coming towards the battlefield at a fast speed.

This aura was fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Without a doubt, the figure had come here for Jian Wushuang.

The remaining thirteen great emperors who were in the battle too looked up at the figure.

They soon recognized who the figure was.

“It’s him?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Jian Wushuang recognized the person.
