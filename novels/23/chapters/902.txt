Chapter 903: The Blood Clothing Sect

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the vast void, a large team was moving forward slowly.

This team was made up almost entirely of people wearing fearsome scarlet armor. There were about a hundred of them.

Among these people were dozens of young men and women.

“Move faster!”

“Aha! Faster now!”

“Crack! Crack!”

The whips slashed heavily. The leader of the men in scarlet armor was a bald man. He had a savage look, and held a serpent-like whip in his hand.

“Father.”

“Little Wei!”

Crying and murmuring could be heard from the young people.

Among the crowd.

There was a young man in a shabby cloth made of animal fur. He had a dirty face and was holding a little girl in his arms. He may have been young, but his aura indicated that he had clearly reached the level of Divine Realm expert.

The Eternal World provided the perfect environment for cultivation. That is why there were countless geniuses, and this young man was one of them.

“Xiao Yin.”

The young man holding the girl had bright eyes, and they expressed his desire to live. He said in a gentle voice, “Sister, I promise you will survive.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The girl’s body trembled slightly.

“Are we going to die, brother?” the girl asked. “This is the Blood Clothing Sect. I heard that when captured by these people, only one out of ten will survive at most.”

The young man’s face was pale as death.

The Blood Clothing Sect was a notorious force in this territory.

They had only one method of gathering disciples. They looked for talented experts within an area and killed all of their relatives so they could bring the young men back by force.

After that, these young people would go through a bloody baptism.

The bloody baptism was actually an elimination game to knock out nine people from ten. Only the best could become disciples of the Blood Clothing Sect. Their way of picking disciples was truly far too cruel.

But their cruel methods provided them with strong disciples. And the Blood Clothing Sect had expanded that way. They were strong enough to rank top five in this territory.

The leader of the Blood Clothing Sect was so powerful that he was at the top of the Eternal Realm. It was said that he and the other two Dao Masters were in a close relationship.

That is why despite their notorious fame, no one dared to stand against them all these years.

“Don’t worry, Xiao Yin. I will protect you.” The young man hugged his sister with tears on his face.

Suddenly...

Woosh!

Suddenly a man appeared in front of the crowd. All the men from the Blood Clothing Sect stopped at once.

“Who do you think you are to stop the way of the Blood Clothing Sect?”

Their bald leader spoke with a rather cold voice as he looked over with a whip in his hand.

The Blood Clothing Sect had always acted in a tyrannous manner, and so had its members.

“The Blood Clothing Sect?” Jian Wushuang wasn’t familiar with this name at all, but he kept an eye on the looks of the young men.

“I see they are doing some dirty business here, but not bothering to hide it. They even told me their name, it looks like this Blood Clothing Sect is quite strong and famous here.”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself. He raised his head.

“I want to ask for directions and I was hoping you would tell me.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was somehow chilly.

“Ask for directions?”

The bald man laughed. “Hmm, you are the first one to be brave enough to ask the Blood Clothing Sect for directions in this whole area. Judging by your looks, you are still young, but you’ve reached the level of the Eternal Realm. Seems like you are a genius. We’re going to have to take you with us too.”

“Let’s go, brothers!”

The members of the Sect showed their excitement, rushing toward Jian Wushuang together.

The coldness in Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled. Immaterial sword shadows appeared before him. The Sword Essence may have seemed miniscule, but it emitted strong power.

All the sword shadows shot forward.

It was just like thunder and lightning!

Jian Wushuang had a battle strength at the legendary seventh level. He could even fight a few rounds with a decent Dao Master. It was way too easy for him to deal with Divine or Eternal Realm experts.

The sword shadows cut through the Void, into the bodies of the Blood Clothing Sect members, leaving them no chance to counter.

In a mere second, hundreds were killed. The only one to survive was the bald man.

As for the young men and women in the center, they were unharmed.

“Well, I...” The bald man was greatly shocked.

Even a stupid man like him could not fail to realize that he had encountered a real expert, someone capable of killing him a thousand times in less than a minute.

“Please, sir. Ask me anything, and I will tell everything I know.” The bald man kneeled on the ground and looked at Jian Wushuang with terror in his eyes.

“Tell me, which territory is this?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“This is Python Territory,” he answered.

Jian Wushuang took out his map and began to study it.

“Python Territory is here!” Jian Wushuang looked at a point on his map.

Python Territory was fairly close to the Stellar Fog Sea but far away from the Tang of the East.

“If I start from the Python Territory, it will take me more than a hundred years to reach the Tang of the East on foot. It seems I have no other choice but to go to the Void Temple and find a wormhole,”?Jian Wushuang murmured to himself. Then he asked, “Is there a Void Temple somewhere nearby?”

“Void Temple? What is a Void Temple?” The bald man was confused.

“You have no idea?” Jian Wushuang asked, but then felt relieved.

He was only in the fourth step of the Eternal Realm. He might have never had a chance to wander from the Python Territory. It was reasonable that he had never heard of a Void Temple.

“Sir, I have never heard of such a thing as a Void Temple. But the leader of the Blood Clothing Sect is knowledgeable, he even has a good relationship with the two Dao Masters in this territory. Surely he has heard of it. ”

“The leader?”

Jian Wushuang frowned. A cold smile spread on his face.
