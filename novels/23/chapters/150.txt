Chapter 151: Go through the Heavenly Palace

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At the very edge of the corridor, Jian Wushuang was standing side by side with Baili Chen, followed by a large group of disciples behind them.

Unlike the Dragon Gate, the Heavenly Palace was open to the public and could be seen by everyone.

“Jian Wushuang, this is your first time going through the Heavenly Palace, right?” Baili Chen asked with a smile.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“I have to remind you that the trial of Heavenly Palace is very simple. Although there are some hindrances created by these puppets, just go as far as you can. And don’t forget, you can’t stop or retreat. Once you do, the trial will end. Got it?” Baili Chen said.

“Can’t stop?”Jian Wushuang frowned and asked, “In other words, I have to keep moving forward?”

“Yes, as long as you don’t stop, you can go forward at a normal speed or even a very slow speed. Also, keep in mind that the Heavenly Palace is a total of one kilometer long.” Baili Chen said.

“One kilometer?” Jian Wushuang suddenly changed color.

In the outside world, traveling a kilometer would only take a minute. But the Heavenly Palace was filled with puppets that would try to stop him. So it was impossible for him to rush straight to the very end of the corridor.

Just move forward as far as possible.

“Are you ready?” Baili Chen asked.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Okay.?Let’s start.”

Swoosh! Swoosh! As soon as the sentence finished, Jian Wushuang and Baili Chen turned into a Flowing Light at the same time, directly rushing toward the end of the corridor.

The competition to see who could go farthest in the Heavenly Palace had started.

And they both started at the same time.

At the edge of the corridor, a large number of the disciples were watching with anticipation.

The moment Jian Wushuang and Baili Chen appeared in the corridor, the puppets immediately came to life and rushed towards them.

“Baili Chen ranks second on the Earthly Dragon List.”??A weird light shone in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“I have been steadily cultivating in the Sword Tomb for the last two years. My strength has skyrocketed, even to the point where I can kill common experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. However, it is said that the top ten experts on the Earthly Dragon List are also capable of killing warriors in the Yin-Yang Void Ream. And those ranked in the top three are at a monstrous level. This Baili Chen ranks second on the Earthly Dragon List. Between the two of us, who is stronger?”

Jian Wushuang looked forward to competing with Baili Chen. When he saw ten puppets rushing toward him, a cold light flashed in his eyes.

“Get out of my way!”

A howl of rage sounded out in an instant as the cold sword shadow swept out.

With an overwhelming amount of Sword Essence of Earth, the unbridled Sword Shadow instantly hit the puppets and knocked them away without even giving them a chance to touch Jian Wushuang.

Without waiting, Jian Wushuang continued to attack, but ten more puppets rushed towards him.

The strength of these ten puppets was obviously stronger than the puppets he just repulsed.

“The farther forward we move, the stronger these puppets will be. They will also be a greater hindrance, right?”?Narrowing his eyes, Jian Wushuang felt like he had a basic understanding of the trial in the Heavenly Palace.

Now that he understood the situation, he would use his full power and move forward.

“Come on.”

With a growl, Jian Wushuang instantaneously released his full power. Wielding an unbridled Sword Shadow, he used the Fiery Wind Sword Essence to the pinnacle of his ability.

The terrifying sword shadow, like a fire dragon, easily bombarded the puppets and knocked them backwards.

Jian Wushuang had not been hindered at all, so he continued to rush forward, attacking the puppets in the process.

On the other side, Baili Chen also used all his strength. His palms slammed forward, one after the other, and his blood-colored gloves radiated an iridescent luster at this moment. He attacks caused even the air to tremble.

Every one of his attacks was frightening.

Each blow contained the combined essences of Raging Fire and Waterdrop.

Water and Fire Essence!

Obviously, Baili Chen had combined two Essences as well.

Baili Chen’s Water and Fire Essence was not weaker than Jian Wushuang’s Fiery Wind Essence.

Also, Baili Chen’s Palm skill was extremely terrifying, frightening, and appalling.

One blow after another, the puppets never even had an opportunity to touch him before being knocked back.

“Extremely awesome! ”

“Is that the strength of the second rank on the Earthly Dragon List?”

“Extremely awesome. Baili Chen is too strong. His every move seems to be able to destroy the heaven and earth. Although I’m an expert on the Earthly Dragon List, I don’t think I could withstand his attacks.”

“Jian Wushuang is so strong as well. His comprehension of Fiery Wind Sword Essence is extremely high, together with his violent, fierce, and rapid assaults. Luckily, those puppets are made of special materials that are unbreakable. Otherwise, they would have already been chopped into pieces!”

“Both of them are very strong. What Baili Chen said is true. When Jian Wushuang competed with Luo Ang just now, he did not try his best. He did not even use his Fiery Wind Sword Essence.”

A large number of disciples were talking about that, and each of them was very shocked.

However, despite the strength possessed by both Jian Wushuang and Baili Chen, the farther they went into the corridor, the stronger those puppets were, and the more they were hindered by them.

Soon, both of them began slowing down. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was starting to get quite difficult for them to move forward.

Finally...

Bang!

A puppet approached Jian Wushuang with a fierce saber attack, but Jian Wushuang used his sword to withstand it. The terrifying sword shadow instantly pierced the Void, colliding with the incoming saber, immediately launching the puppet backwards.

However, the power of this puppet’s saber was not weak. Although it couldn’t hurt Jian Wushuang, it was still enough to make him stop for an instant.

That pause meant that this trial was over, so the puppets surrounding him immediately stopped.

At almost the same time when Jian Wushuang stopped, Baili Chen was also forced to stop by a puppet.

In a single instant, both of them had stopped, and their trials had ended at nearly the same time.

At this moment, the distance between them was less than ten meters. One was in front and the other was slightly behind.

In the outside world, a ten-meter distance was like a single step. But in the Heavenly Palace, it was much more complicated.

“It…”

Seeing this scene, the disciples at the edge of the corridor also stood up in amazement and stared at Jian Wushuang.

Palace Masters Black and White, as well as the Temple Masters, also watched this scene speechlessly.

“Only ten meters?”

“Only ten meters, that can be made up for with a single step.”

“Jian Wushuang is not lucky enough.”

Yes, the figure that was ten meters behind was Jian Wushuang.

If as usual, getting behind was a fact. But now there seemed to have coincidence as far as the merely ten-meter distance.
