Chapter 3396 The Rules of Reincarnation

Seeing the Samsara Grandmaster’s figure disappear, Jian Wushuang understood that the reason why the Samsara Grandmaster’s consciousness appeared was to tell him the secret of the Samsara Heaven Realm. Now that he had told him, his consciousness naturally fell silent again.

“The Samsara of life and death…if it really is the legendary Samsara of life and death, then this opportunity is too great.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in his heart, but at the same time, he also understood that if it really was the Samsara of life and death, it would be as difficult as ascending to heaven to refine it.

For example, the Samsara Grandmaster himself was extremely powerful. He created the Samsara Sect with great means. Although he might not have reached the overlord level, his strength and his understanding of the Samsara principles…among the experts born in the Divine Beginning Realm who were good at the Samsara principles, there were definitely few who were good at it.

However, such an expert, who was extremely talented in Samsara principles, had studied it for 300 million years without making any progress. One could imagine how difficult it was to refine and master the Samsara of life and death.

“Such a great fortune is placed in front of me, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to enjoy it.” Jian Wushuang shook his head secretly.

Perhaps in the future, when he grew up and reached the peak level that the Samsara Grandmaster had mentioned, he would try to break the restrictions around the Samsara Heaven Realm, but now…Jian Wushuang would not waste a month’s time refining the Samsara.

“The Samsara is a complete Samsara. I will meditate in it. It will definitely help me to master the Samsara principles. I wonder if I have the chance to improve the Samsara principles and master the Samsara principles in this month.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

Once the Samsara principles was improved, his strength would also be greatly enhanced.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and sat down cross-legged in the Samsara Heaven Realm. His consciousness still covered the entire Samsara with the death aura. He carefully observed and felt the Samsara.

He felt the power of life and death in the Samsara and the complete Samsara principles.

“The combination of life and death is perfect!

“The power of life and death is connected with the power of Samsara.”

Many thoughts suddenly appeared in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

In the Samsara Heaven Realm, he had seen the Samsara principles too clearly through the Samsara.

Soon, he found the part of the Samsara principles that he had not mastered yet. Then, he began to meditate.

Time passed quietly.

A month passed quickly. The Samsara Heaven Realm was still filled with the power of the Samsara principles. Even Jian Wushuang’s body was filled with the rich Samsara principles.

However, as Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes, the power of the Samsara principles on his body and around him instantly disappeared.

Jian Wushuang sat there with his legs crossed. He looked calm and unremarkable in the Samsara Heaven Realm. It was as if he belonged to a part of the Samsara Heaven Realm, or it could be said that the Samsara Heaven Realm was filled with a part of the Samsara principles.

“The Samsara Heaven Realm did not disappoint me. After a month, I have completely grasped the Samsara principles.” Jian Wushuang smiled, at this moment, he could already feel the complete power of the Samsara principles.

After he had gathered the space-time principles, he had finally completely comprehended the second principle. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After comprehending the Samsara principles, Jian Wushuang immediately gained another portion of the power of his will. Originally, because he had comprehended the space-time principles and the combination of the space-time principles and the Samsara principles, he had already mastered two portions of the power of his will. Now that he had also comprehended the Samsara principles, he had mastered three portions of the power of his will

Three parts of the power of the will were already at the level of an ordinary expert in the third realm of the Void. However, Jian Wushuang had cultivated the life divine power, so it was equivalent to having one more part of the power of the will, as well as the heaven-cleaving skill, one part of the power of the will could also be comparable to one part of the power of the will.

If all these were calculated, he now had the power of five parts of the power of the will, which was already at the level of an expert in the fifth realm of the Void!

The Principles Masters of the five void realms were almost at the top level in the Divine Beginning Realm. After all, apart from those masters of the Saint Realm or experts who had reached the ruler level, there should be less than 20 experts of the six void realms in the Divine Beginning Realm, and those below the six void realms were the Principles Masters of the five void realms, they were the Principles Masters of the five void realms.

“Unfortunately, although I have mastered the third part of the power of the will, I still don’t feel the slightest sign of a breakthrough.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

After all, he was still an Immortal Saint.

Although he had reached the peak of the Immortal Saint and met all the requirements for an ordinary cultivator to break through to the Principles Master level, and even exceeded them by a lot, a perfect life-level cultivator…it was already much more difficult than other cultivators to break through from the Immortal Saint Realm to the Principles Master Realm.

Even though he had mastered three portions of the power of the will, he still could not break through.

“Temporal Temple Master said before that master seemed to have fused three principles before he broke through to the Principles Master Realm. I’ve only fused two principles now, and I’m still far from master’s level,” Jian Wushuang muttered, “I can’t rush it. I have to take it step by step. After fusing two principles, I’ll have to figure out a way to comprehend the third principle. The third principle should be…the destruction principles!”

The destruction principles had a higher affinity than the reincarnation principles, which was comparable to the space-time principles. Jian Wushuang would definitely choose the destruction principles as his next principle to comprehend. However, he had not really comprehended the destruction principles before, so he had to start from scratch. It would definitely take a lot of time, if he could have some opportunities or treasures to help him, his progress would be faster.

“The one-month deadline is up. The Samsara Heaven Realm is already rejecting me. I’d better go out first.” Jian Wushuang smiled, then stood up and slowly walked out of the Heaven Realm.

Before leaving, Jian Wushuang stopped with some reluctance. His consciousness once again activated the aura of death and felt the complete Samsara of life and death.

“Samsara…I don’t know if someone really has the ability to completely refine you. If that person really exists, I hope it’s me.”

With a sigh, Jian Wushuang left the Samsara Heaven Realm.
