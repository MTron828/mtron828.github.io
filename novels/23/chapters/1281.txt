Chapter 1282: A Fight With Universe God Chen

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Man Yi, sit down.”

Lord of Scarlet Island arranged Man Yi to sit next to him, and then he looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“You are Jian Wushuang?” The Lord of Scarlet Island smiled and said, “I heard that you killed Zhuge Qiu from the Holy Prefecture? And it was a one-on-one confrontation?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“A Universe Master killed an Advanced First Heaven Universe God. I wouldn’t believe it even if I saw it with my own eyes,” The Lord of Scarlet Island said.

“Lord, what do you mean?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He thought that the lord would ask him about the issues concerning Jiu Xi and Jin Feng. He did not expect that the lord would question his strength straight from the beginning of their meeting.

“I have already arranged an opponent for you.” Lord of Scarlet Island said, slightly waving his hand.

Woosh!

A figure appeared by the Lord of Scarlet Island. This was a black-clothed middle-aged man who wore a kind smile focused on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, as he knew this man.

“You’re familiar with this Universe God Chen. I heard that when you joined Scarlet Island, it was Universe God Chen who personally verified your strength.” Lord of Scarlet Island said, laughing.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“You two fight in this palace. Just try your best,” Lord of Scarlet Island said.

Jian Wushuang nodded in unison with Universe God Chen. Both of them moved to the center of the palace.

“Jian Wushuang, the last time you sparred with me, your swordsmanship surprised me. I didn’t expect that you were so strong. Today, please show all your skills,” Universe God Chen said with hearty laughter.

“I will,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Jian Wushuang really could not figure out why the Lord of Scarlet Island had asked him to fight Universe God Chen again. However, he was glad to fight with a Universe God at the Peak of First Heaven.

Both Jian Wushuang and Universe God Chen took out their longswords.

“Let’s get started.”

Universe God Chen dived forward as he casually swung the scarlet longsword in his hand.

The casual strike actually contained his Divine Power. It could apply more pressure to Jian Wushuang than that of an Advanced First Heaven Universe God.

Buzz!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with killing intent as mighty power surged into his sword. It was soon that he was displaying Nirvana.

Clang!

With a loud boom, Jian Wushuang was forced to step back.

“I’ve used my full strength, but his move puts me at an absolute disadvantage. Is a Universe God at the Peak of First Heaven really so powerful?”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Jian Wushuang. I heard that when you fought Zhuge Qiu, you used a Realm Technique to suppress some of his strength. Now let me have a look at your Realm Technique,” Universe God Chen said with a smile.

“You know I have Realm Techniques?” Jian Wushuang’s face fell. “If that is what you wish!”

Jian Wushuang immediately took out the gold gourd.

At the sight of the gold gourd, the Lord of Scarlet Island’s eyes lit up. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Then the mighty Blaze Quicksand surged out and formed a Quicksand Realm, suppressing Universe God Chen.

Jian Wushuang had used Quicksand Realm to suppress 30 percent of Zhuge Qiu’s strength.

Apparently, Universe God Chen was stronger than Zhuge Qiu, so the Realm only suppressed 10 percent of Universe God Chen’s strength.

“Jian Wushuang, be careful!” Universe God Chen smiled.

He waved his longsword and unleashed a strike which swept toward his opponent like lightning.

The sword light fluttered slightly. When it was about to hit Jian Wushuang, the sword light was divided into four streaks.

A suffocating coldness arose.

It struck terror into Jian Wushuang’s heart. He went pale and immediately swung his sword to resist the attack.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

After four confrontations, Jian Wushuang’s arm became numb so that he was barely unable to hold his sword.

“How powerful!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He knew that he was inferior to any Universe God at the Peak of First Heaven, but he did not expect that the gap would be as big as this.

If Universe God Chen used his full strength, Jian Wushuang would be unable to deflect a few attacks.

“Jian Wushuang, you can’t kill Zhuge Qiu with such strength. Show me your real Killing Moves,” Universe God Chen growled.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate.

Immediately…

Phew!

The sword light emerged, and the sword began to chant a tune.

It sounded crisp and intoxicating.

When the sword light appeared, the Lord of Scarlet Island and Man Yi could not help but look over at it.

Universe God Chen was immediately influenced by a horrible Soul Attack.

“Humph!”

Although Universe God Chen made a little pale face as he snorted, his consciousness did not come to a halt. He immediately reacted in time, waving his hands to shatter the beautiful sword light.

After breaking the sword light, Universe God Chen stood there silently for a while. He finally looked up to fix his eyes on Jian Wushuang, “It is actually a consciousness attack! “This consciousness attack is so powerful. I was almost trumped by it. Zhuge Qiu is not a Universe God at the Peak of First Heaven, so it is understandable why it was impossible for him to block you. No wonder you killed him!”

“I could only deal with an Advanced First Heaven Universe God, but if I encounter a Universe God at the Peak of First Heaven like you, it won’t work,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Hehe, I’m afraid that those Universe Gods who have weak consciousnesses won’t be able to resist such an attack in time.” Universe God Chen smiled. His complexion had recovered at that moment.

“Okay, stop here.” Lord of Scarlet Island spoke.

Jian Wushuang and Universe God Chen naturally did not continue to fight.

“Jian Wushuang, do you know why I wanted to meet you and let you spar with Universe God Chen?” Lord of Scarlet Island asked while staring at Jian Wushuang.

“I have no idea.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.
