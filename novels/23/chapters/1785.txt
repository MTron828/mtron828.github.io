Chapter 1786: Tian Jue City

In Dayu Palace in Dayu World.

Jian Wushuang stopped in the void above a lofty hall in Dayu Palace.

In the void, Jian Wushuang could clearly feel the auras in the hall below and there were quite a number of them that he was familiar with. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“There are quite a lot of old friends here,” Jian Wushuang smiled and he flew towards the hall.

In the hall, many Universe Gods had gathered.

Among the Universe Gods, the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang were leaders. Then, they were followed by experts from Scarlet Island, Golden-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture.

In Dayu World, one Monarch and three overlords, the representatives of four major forces were gathered.

“Palace Master, there are news saying Tian Jue City’s troops already departed. They will arrive in six hours time at most,” a white-dressed Universe God reported politely.

“Six hours?” The Master of Dayu Palace grew distressed.

The Universe Gods at the scene didn’t look good either.

“I never expected Tian Jue City to grow so fast, the Master of Scarlet Island said.

“D*mn Tian Jue City, they didn’t even give us a chance,” the Master of Golden-sun Sect said.

“Tian Jue City has just risen and they wanted to punish one as an example to others. Dayu World seem to be the one,” one of the masters from Holy Prefecture said.

“Humph, Tian Jue City wants the forces in Dayu World to yield to them. It won’t be that easy,” A Universe God in the Second Heaven from Dayu Palace humphed.

The Universe Gods higher-ups in Dayu World united as one against the same enemy.

Just then…

“What made everyone so furious?” A calm voice spread and a crimson-robed figure substantiated in the middle of the hall.

The Universe Gods were stunned when they saw the crimson-robed figure.

They were having a discussion and they had set up prohibition surrounding the hall but this person had barged in quietly.

“You are…” the Master of Scarlet Island was the first who stood up and looked at the incomer, “Jian Wushuang, it’s you!”

“Jian Wushuang?” The Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang looked at him too.

“Haha, Master of Scarlet Island, Master of Dayu Palace, Brother Wu Cang, long time no see. How have you been?” Jian Wushuang let out a hearty laugh.

“It’s really you,” the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang walked down.

“Jian Wushuang, long time no see,” the Master of Scarlet Island was the most surprised one.

After all, Jian Wushuang was from Scarlet Island and he carried the Secret Skill of Scarlet Kingdom. He belonged to Lineage of Scarlet.

As for the Master of Golden-sun Sect and the few masters of Holy Prefectures, they didn’t look quite good.

Jian Wushuang shared resentment with Golden-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture.

Especially Golden-sun Sect as Jian Wushuang killed the Master of Golden-sun Sect’s brother. Back then, the Master of Golden-sun Sect had wanted to kill Jian Wushaung. But in the end, they had had no choice but to get the Master of Dayu Palace involved and settled the resentment between them. As they met again, his emotions were naturally complicated.

After a brief exchange of conventional greetings, Jian Wushuang found a seat and sat down casually.

“Listening to your conversation earlier, Dayu World seems to be in trouble?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“Yeah, we ran into some trouble,” the Master of Dayu Palace nodded faintly and looked at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, your aura is distinguished. I can’t see through it at all. I believe you must have improved tremendously, right?”

“Mm, I did,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“To what level exactly? Have you passed your third inverse cultivation test?” The Master of Dayu Palace asked closely.

“Yes, I have already passed it,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“That’s great,” the Master of Dayu Palace was thrilled and the Universe Gods in the hall beamed with joy. Even the Master of Golden-sun Sect and the few masters of Holy Prefecture who harbored grudges against Jian Wushuang looked happy too.

“Jian Wushuang, as you are a cultivator of Dayu World as well, I will be frank with you. About a thousand years ago, there was a force that rose abruptly near Dayu World. The force called themselves Tian Jue City…” the Master of Dayu Palace told him the ins and outs of the story.

Then, Jian Wushuang understood.

The danger that Dayu World was facing derived from Tian Jue City.

Not long ago, Tian Jue City had spread news to all forces and sects in Dayu World and over ten surrounding worlds to yield to them. All worlds naturally wouldn’t agree.

Hence, Tian Jue City wanted to take action and the first was against Dayu World.

Then, the city was under siege. Six hours later, the troops from Tian Jue City would arrive. Hence, the Master of Dayu Palace had gathered the three overlords in Dayu World to unite to fight against Tian Jue City.

“Tian Jue City is extremely powerful. It is said that they have more than ten Universe Gods in the Third Heaven and they have more than a thousand Universe Gods. Against a powerful force like them, with our strength in Dayu World alone, we wouldn’t be evenly matched. But now that Jian Wushuang has returned, it is a different story,” the Master of Dayu Palace beamed with joy.

“Jian Wushuang, you are an inverse cultivator. You should be extremely strong compared to those of the same level. As you have passed your third inverse cultivation test, there shouldn’t be any Universe Gods who are your match. If you were to partake in the battle, we Dayu World might be able to win the battle against Tian Jue City.

“Yes!”

Wu Cang, Master of Scarlet Island and the others nodded simultaneously.

Then, Jian Wushuang smiled, “I was from Dayu World. As Dayu World is in trouble, I naturally couldn’t just stand and watch.

Everyone heard that Jian Wushuang had agreed to help and they instantly saw a sliver of hope.

Six hours later, the army from Tian Jue City really came.

In the void outside Dayu Palace, Tian Jue City’s army gathered. There were at least four thousand people.

Among the four thousand people, the weakest aura was Universe God in the First Heaven.

A total of four thousand Universe Gods!

There were over two hundred Universe Gods in the Second Heaven and over thirty Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

Looking at the sight, the Universe Gods in Dayu World who saw a string of hope earlier, their faces instantly grew pale.

As pale as a sheet, with no color in their cheeks.

“How is it possible? How could it be?” The Master of Dayu Palace muttered.

“According to the information, it isn’t as such?!” The others were dumbfounded too.

The information that they had obtained about Tian Jue City previously had said that they had over a thousand Universe Gods and there had less than ten Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. But in the end…

Tian Jue City’s power was a few times greater than what they knew!!

A few times!

If their fighting power was as the information they obtained had said, they might have stood a chance because of Jian Wushuang’s return.

But then…

“No hope, no hope at all.”

“Although Jian Wushuang has returned, no matter how strong he is, he could at most fight with ten Universe Gods in the Third Heaven alone. The rest of Tian Jue City’s power could still easily massacre all the experts in Dayu World!”
