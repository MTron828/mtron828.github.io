Chapter 1830: Self Defense

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Fortress Master Hong Tian made the twelve Almighties stunned.

If they didn’t work together, the twelve of them would definitely be in a life threatening situation. However, Fortress Master Hong Tian wouldn’t be, right?

Fortress Master Hong Tian was a true Peak Emperor God. He had once fought with the Master of Star Palace twice and he survived both matches.

No matter how great Lineage of Star’s tactics were, it would be impossible that they could kill an expert at the level of Peak Emperor God.

“Why? Do you think I am joking?”

Fortress Master Hong Tian saw everyone’s expressions and he smirked coldly, “Everyone might not know, the reason I could retreat when I fought with the Master of Star Palace was that he never used Secret Skill of Star Palace. After all, his strongest trump card is Secret Skill of Star Palace. After he performs it, he will need a long time until he perform it a second time.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“If he isn’t sure that he can kill me, he won’t be willing to use his trump card.”

“But then, Jian Wushuang has risen and his strength isn’t much weaker than the Master of Star Palace’s. He has definitely cultivated Secret Skill of Star Palace too. Once they join forces and play Secret Skill of Star Palace, I might not stand a chance to flee either.”

The twelve Almighties then understood.

The scariest part about Lineage of Star was the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

The secret skill was eagerly coveted by many experts in Eternal Chaotic World.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian, according to what you said, even if we team up, we won’t be evenly matched with Lineage of Star?” A Sir God couldn’t help but ask.

“That’s true,” Fortress Master nodded faintly, “So, you were talking about killing Jian Wushuang and destroying Lineage of Star. Forget about that. With us alone, it is impossible. However, if we were to team up, although we couldn’t be evenly matched with Lineage of Star, we could defend ourselves well enough.”

“Self-defense?”

“So many of us team up, including you, but we can only defend ourselves?”

The twelve Almighties were unhappy about it.

They harbored deep-seated hatred against Lineage of Star and they were forced to team up. If they teamed up, they not only wanted to defend themselves, they wanted to bring damage to Lineage of Star.

“It’s great enough that we could defend ourselves. Plus, we can wait for a chance to come by,” Fortress Master Hong Tian smiled, “Just as you have mentioned, Jian Wushuang has high potential and he carries the fighting power of a Peak Emperor God at the level of Real God. Once he breaks through and becomes an Almighty, how much greater can he be? Sanctuary Alliance isn’t that united. There are many who wouldn’t want to see Jian Wushuang grow stronger.”

“Fortress Master Hong Tian, what you are trying to say is that someone will take care of Jian Wushuang?” A black-robed lady creased her eyebrows and asked.

“Hehe, not only Jian Wushuang, but also Lineage of Star. Over all these years, Lineage of Star has grown too quickly and possessed too many resources. Like the saying, a tall tree attracts the wind. There are many who are eyeing Secret Skill of Star Palace and want to kill Jian Wushuang. They are only waiting for an opportunity to do so. What we are going to do is to defend ourselves together. In no time, Lineage of Star’s danger will reveal itself. By then, we can beat a drowning dog. Why not?” Fortress Master Hong Tian laughed.

Hearing what he had said, everyone exchanged a look and nodded simultaneously.

They thought what Fortress Master Hong Tian had said made sense.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian,” the black-robed lady continued to ask, “even if we wanted to defend ourselves, Lineage of Star and Jian Wushuang are willing to let us be?”

“As for this…” Fortress Master Hong Tian smiled, “In this world, power rules. As long as we are powerful enough, even if Jian Wushuang doesn’t want to stop, he has to. I have already sent a message to Lineage of Star that we are going to meet them on Thunderbolt island one month later. By then, we will just go together.”

Everyone’s eyes glowed.

They already understood Fortress Master Hong Tian’s intention.

Fortress Master Hong Tian didn’t intend to fight with Lineage of Star. He merely wanted to showcase his team and trump cards to serve as a deterrent force to Lineage of Star, so that they wouldn’t act hastily.

Hence, he had invited them to go together.

On that day itself, the message that Fortress Master Hong Tian sent was heard in Jian Wushuang’s ears.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian has asked for me to meet him on Thunderbolt Island? What is he thinking about?” Jian Wushuang smiled but he made a decision very quickly, “No matter what he is thinking about, I shall go.”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t worried and he immediately went to Thunderbolt Island alone.

One month later, in a lofty hall on Thunderbolt Island, there were countless experts gathered.

The experts were from Sanctuary Alliance. Most of them were Real Gods and there were some Almighties who gathered there.

In the middle of the hall, there was a total of thirteen figures towering there. The thirteen auras spread and any single one could strike fear into the surrounding Real Gods.

The thirteen people were all Almighties!

Among the thirteen Almighties, there were seven ordinary Sir Gods, four top Sir Gods and the remaining two were Fortress Master Hong Tian and Emperor God Bing Can.

“Such a strong team!”

“There are not only Sir Gods, there are even two Emperor Gods and the two Emperor Gods… Sir God Bing Can is listed in the fifty-fourth place on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. He is slightly higher compared to Emperor God Tian Xiao from Soaring Heaven King Palace. As for Fortress Master Hong Tian, it’s needless to say, he is a Peak Emperor God!”

“Previously, Sword Emperor from Lineage of Star killed many Sir Gods, including two Sir Gods. But he killed them one by one. However, fighting against such a strong team formation, I reckon he won’t act hastily.”

“Fortress Master Hong Tian united the experts who harbored grudges against Lineage of Star and wanted to match evenly with them. I wonder if the two strong teams will fight a fierce battle.”

“Even if they fight, it won’t be within Thunderbolt Island.”

In the hall, all the experts from Sanctuary Alliance were talking among themselves.

Just then, the crowd suddenly moved to two sides. Then, a young man carrying a sword slowly walked to the middle of the hall.

There was no one behind him, just him alone. He didn’t have a team of thirteen Almighties like Fortress Master Hong Tian.

But he alone could make the entire hall quiet down.

In the hall, the experts from Sanctuary Alliance fixed their gazes upon him. Most of the people revealed reverence and adoration in their eyes.

When he reached the middle of the hall, in front of the thirteen Almighties, there was suddenly a hubbub in the hall.

“It’s Jian Wushuang. He came alone?”

“Alone? He fights alone with a total of thirteen Almighties, including Fortress Master Hong Tian. Such courage… tsk tsk.”
