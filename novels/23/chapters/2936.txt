Chapter 2937: Black Dragon Mountain

——

Since this Demonic Jade was a heaven rank member, she was at least a powerful second rank True Saint, or even more.

Faced with such an expert, the invincible reverends below and the five Immortal Saints who had not even reached the True Saint-level naturally had to maintain their due respect.

“This test is quite special. When the time comes, we will need Lord Yao Yu’s help,” the goateed Elder said humbly.

“Mm.” Under the mask, Yao Yu’s cold voice sounded.

The goateed Elder smiled and waved his hand. A spatial tunnel immediately appeared in the void beside him.

“Let’s go. Let’s head to the test site.” The goateed Elder smiled and was the first to rush into the spatial tunnel.

Yao Yu, the five Immortal Saints, and the twenty-seven reverends immediately followed.

There was a special territory in the endless territories. This territory was made up of six different realms of different sizes.

These six realms had countless cultivators, and these cultivators all knew one name — Black Dragon Mountain!

These six realms were ruled by Black Dragon Mountain.

In the center of these six realms was a floating land. This land was not very vast, and this was the base of Black Dragon Mountain, which was also the Sacred Land of Black Dragon Mountain mentioned by the cultivators in the six realms.

However, at this moment, the entire sacred land of Black Dragon Mountain was covered with a layer of barrier?

This layer of the barrier was extremely powerful and was not something that ordinary cultivators could break.

In the center of the barrier, on a towering black mountain, there were countless pavilions and palaces. In the center of the towering great hall, many experts of the highest level of Black Dragon Mountain gathered together. These experts’ expressions were extremely gloomy, it was extremely ugly.

“Patriarch, is there really nothing we can do?” A voice suddenly sounded.

Everyone’s eyes were all focused on an old man with white hair sitting on the throne in the center.

The old man frowned. After a while, he sighed, “I’ve already used all my connections and tried to contact the people of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Unfortunately, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance didn’t pay any attention to it.”

“Ignored? How is that possible?”

“Are they really not going to give us a chance?”

The expressions of the experts present changed.

“The Heaven-cleaving Alliance… is too strong, too detached.” The weathered Elder shook his head, “Compared to the high and mighty Heaven-cleaving Alliance, my Black Dragon Mountain is nothing. It’s just an ant, not even comparable to an ant. But to my Black Dragon Mountain, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is a tall mountain and a giant statue. When did you see a giant statue that would be willing to sit down and talk to an ant?”

“We have no choice. This time, our Black Dragon Mountain is doomed. We have no chance at all. who asked us to be so blind to provoke the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?”

“Patriarch, the reason why our Black Dragon Mountain provoked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance this time was purely an accident. It was not intentional. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance should also know this. How could they still do this?” Someone said unwillingly.

“It was an accident. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance also knows this. However, even if it was an accident, the high and mighty Heaven-cleaving Alliance wouldn’t allow it. It’s like a beggar accidentally bumping into an emperor. Although it was an unintentional act, it has already offended the emperor’s majesty. For the sake of his majesty, the emperor must also punish him.” The aged Elder sighed softly.

Hearing this, the experts of the Black Dragon Mountain turned pale.

Despair rose in the hearts of most of them.

In front of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, a mere Black Dragon Mountain was indeed too weak.

“Now that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has completely sealed off our Black Dragon Mountain, none of the cultivators of our Black Dragon Mountain can escape. Could it be that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance wants to completely wipe out our Black Dragon Mountain?” An Immortal Saint of the Black Dragon Mountain said in a low voice.

“It shouldn’t be to the extent of completely wiping out.” The aged old man shook his head. “Our Black Dragon Mountain has only inadvertently provoked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance will descend and punish us. It might directly destroy our Black Dragon Mountain, but it definitely won’t be too extreme. Instead, it will leave a certain amount of life force. Otherwise, with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s methods, after completely sealing off our Black Dragon Mountain, they will immediately take action and kill us all. However, several days have already passed, but other than that enchantment, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance hasn’t made a single move.”

“Obviously, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance doesn’t have the intention to completely wipe us out.”

“Then what does the Heaven-cleaving Alliance want to do?” The surrounding people looked over.

“Who knows, just wait.” The weathered Elder sighed softly, but his heart was filled with helplessness.

…

Black Dragon Mountain, in the void within the barrier.

Along with the appearance of a spatial tunnel, the many experts participating in this assessment, as well as the goateed Elder and the heaven grade member Xue Yu, all appeared in this void.

After appearing, everyone looked around blankly.

“Follow me.”

The goateed Elder waved his hand, and everyone immediately followed him forward.

After rushing forward, it took them only half a day to arrive in front of a towering black mountain.

Jian Wushuang and the others could clearly see the various buildings on the Black Dragon Mountain and the aura of cultivators coming from the buildings.

Some of the hidden auras were extremely powerful, enough to make Invincible Divine Masters and Immortal Saints treat them seriously.

“This is the place.”

The goateed Elder smiled and then looked at Xue Yu. “Master Xue Yu, Please.”

Xue Yu, who was two meters tall and wearing a mask, nodded slightly and walked toward the Black Dragon Mountain in front of her.

A moment later, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted from Xue Yu’s body.

As soon as this aura erupted, the pupils of the unrivaled reverent gods and the five Immortal Saints who were participating in the assessment shrank.

“So powerful!”

“This aura is at least a third-level True Saint. It might even be a peak existence among third-level True Saints!”

“This blood jade is too strong.”

Everyone exclaimed in shock, but blood jade had already attacked.

Her technique was very casual. She did not even take out her divine weapon. She only used one hand to slash with her finger.

But this slash contained endless power.

A blade light that blotted out the sky swept out at a terrifying speed.

Wherever the blade light went, everything was torn apart. In the end, this blade light swept onto the towering Black Dragon Mountain.

This towering Black Dragon Mountain was instantly cut in half by this blade light from above.

The entire mountain fell to the sides. Numerous experts from the Black Dragon Mountain within the mountain were shocked and furious as they rushed forward.
