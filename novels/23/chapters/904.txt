Chapter 905: Accident

Tang of the East, the imperial palace.

As the capital of the Tang of the East, the imperial palace was extremely large and prosperous. It was filled with a sea of people.

“Finally home.”

Jian Wushuang stood on the street breathing in the air of the imperial palace. His mood was complicated.

More than 200 years ago, four Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards, Jiu Zui, Ling Long, Shui Jin and himself had accepted the Hell Level task to the extremely dangerous Stellar Fog Sea. 200 years later, he was the only one to have survived.

“200 years have passed, what about the Icy Heart Poison in Leng Rushuang’s body?”Jian Wushuang thought worriedly.

But at this moment…

“What?”?Jian Wushuang felt an unusual energy in the imperial palace.

On the street, Royal Guard soldiers in gold armor were everywhere. Jian Wushuang also perceived some concealed and tyrannical auras hidden in the dark.

“Did something happen?”Jian Wushuang wondered. He wrinkled his eyebrows slightly.

He hadn’t been to the imperial palace in 200 years. Though heavily guarded at the time, it was far less compared to now.

Jian Wushuang also discovered there were more experts in the imperial palace than before.

“Did something happen?”?Confused, Jian Wushuang took out a Message Token.

This Message Token was used to connect with Wang Yuan.

“Elder Brother Wang Yuan, I’m back.”

The message was quite simple. Jian Wushuang got the reply only a moment later.

“Haha, Third Brother, you’ve finally returned. Over the past 200 years, I worried about you all the time. It made me lose a lot of weight,” Wang Yuan said happily.

“Don’t brag, I think you are much fatter than before,” Jian Wushuang said jokingly but then asked Wang Yuan seriously, “Elder Brother Wang Yuan, did something happen in the imperial palace?”

“You already know that?” Wang Yuan said with a smile, “Well, it’s not a big deal. In three years, there will be a Selection Ceremony.”

“A Selection Ceremony?” Jian Wushuang repeated. He was shocked at first, then without thinking he mumbled, “what is the Selection Ceremony? For whom?”

“Of course, it’s for the princess of the Tang of the East, Leng Rushuang. Who else’s Selection Ceremony could attract so many experts?” Wang Yuan said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s mood suddenly darkened.

Selection Ceremony?

A Selection Ceremony for Leng Rushuang?

Jian Wushuang had risked his life to find the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit in the Stellar Fog Sea in order to save Leng Rushuang from poison.

He had narrowly escaped from the Stellar Fog Sea and brought the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit back.

And here Leng Rushuang had been fine all along, even holding a Selection Ceremony to select a husband.

“Leng Rushuang…”?Jian Wushuang pondered a moment.?“No, with Leng Rushuang’s temper, even if she hadn’t been poisoned, she would never hold a Selection Ceremony, let alone the fact she was deeply poisoned and didn’t have much time left to live.

“The Selection Ceremony must have been arranged by Empress Leng.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and said, “Elder Brother Wang Yuan, I will come to you now.”

“Ok,” Wang Yuan replied.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived at Wang Yuan’s mansion.

As the chief alchemist in the Tang of the East, Wang Yuan got to live in a huge mansion in the imperial palace.

There was a dim secret chamber shielded by a Restriction. The Restriction was to prevent someone from breaking into the secret chamber or hearing the conversation inside.

Now, there were only two people in the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan.

“Haha, Third Brother, I knew you’d eventually make it out from the Stellar Fog Sea.”

Wang Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise. When Jian Wushuang entered the Stellar Fog Sea, he’d been really worried about him. Now that Jian Wushuang was in front of him, he was extremely relieved.

“Elder Brother Wang Yuan, tell me about the Selection Ceremony,” Jian Wushuang said very seriously. He was in no mood to make a joke.

“We all know what kind of condition Leng Rushuang is in. If I fail to get the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit to refine the Crape Myrtle Elixir, she won’t live more than 300 years. 200 have already passed, that means she can only live another hundred years at most. Why are they holding the Selection Ceremony now?”

Jian Wushuang asked in confusion.

Leng Rushuang was about to die. Why did Emperor Leng want to hold a Selection Ceremony for her?

“Selection Ceremony? Hehe…” Wang Yuan said with a sneer, “Third Brother, the Selection Ceremony is actually a way for the Tang of the East to make alliances with the Xia Clan through marriage!”

“Marriage? The Tang of the East with the Xia Clan?” Jian Wushuang was grave.

When he had been on the Cercis Island, he’d once heard from Lin Wan’er that the first master of the Xia Clan had been recognized as the son-in-law of the Tang of the East for a long time.

However, that was talk. It hadn’t been realized after all.

But now, this marriage…

“Does Leng Rushuang agree?” Jian Wushuang asked in a low voice.

This issue was of great significance.

If Leng Rushuang had agreed, it was a marriage of her own free will, something no one could prevent, not even Jian Wushuang. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

But if Leng Rushuang had not agreed, it was different.

“Agree?” Wang Yuan said with a smile, “If Leng Rushuang was willing to agree, then there wouldn’t be a Selection Ceremony in three years, it would be a wedding.

“But it’s strange. According to what I heard in the palace, when Empress Leng proposed that she marry the Xia Clan, Leng Rushuang refused directly. But when Empress Leng proposed holding the Selection Ceremony, she didn’t object.

“Third Brother, you should know that the master of the Xia Clan has been called the top genius of the Eternal World, and he is at the top of the Eternal Realm. He is the true chosen one!” Wang Yuan said with a smile.

“Everyone thinks he is the only one worthy of Leng Rushuang. Besides, who could possibly defeat him at the Selection Ceremony?

“So, almost everyone recognizes the Selection Ceremony as the marriage. Many believe that no matter what happens, Leng Rushuang will marry the master of the Xia Clan.

“Of course, people have come to this conclusion because they don’t know you, my Third Brother. If you join in the Selection Ceremony, the result might be different.”

Wang Yuan paused and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked incredibly confused.

He had heard what Wang Yuan said.

“She refused the marriage but didn’t refuse the Selection Ceremony?

“Why she didn’t refuse the Selection Ceremony?

Was she hoping someone could beat the master of the Xia Clan at the Selection Ceremony and marry her?

“Who is the person she wants?

“Is it me?”
