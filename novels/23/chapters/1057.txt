Chapter 1058: The Heaven-ceasing Peak

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Deep within the Blood Asura Clan,

Whoosh!

A white shadow flashed by as Jian Wushuang stood still. The tall tree in front of him had been sliced through.

“No, no, this isn’t right.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had achieved the peak of his speed, but it was limited by the Sword Principle of Universe Level.

It was far slower than the speed a Sword Principle of Creation Level could reach. In his sad attempts, he often even felt there was no purpose to his practice at all.

“I deciphered the essence of the Swordplay of Coalescence a long time ago, and to improve it, I only need to continue to assimilate new techniques. However, the Swordplay of Aurora and the Swordplay of Heat are quite different. I have to dig deeper and learn more for both.” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Brother.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Su Rou entered the yard as she spoke.

“You have something?” Jian Wushuang invited her to sit at the table.

“Yes,” Su Rou answered and nodded. “The expert of ours who infiltrated the Ancient Demon Clan sent me a message saying he figured out where your mother is. He isn’t completely sure, but he says there’s a good chance.”

“Tell me.” Jian Wushuang said hurriedly.

“Here is the thing,” Su Rou started to explain, “When he was first ordered to look for your mother, he investigated some experts of the Ancient Demon Clan. Since your mother was captured by Ninth-Sword Dao Master himself more than 2,000 years ago. It should have been easy to find more clues.”

“Except after more than 100 years in the Demon Clan, he still has not managed to find anything.”

“It seems that your mother never appeared in the Ancient Demon Clan. He asked many other experts secretly, and they didn’t even know that Ninth-Sword Dao Master had been to the Ancient World, much less capture anyone.”

“The investigation was a dead end until he overheard some people talking about the Heaven-ceasing Peak!”

“The Heaven-ceasing Peak?” Jiang Wushuang asked in confusion, “What is it?”

“It’s a strange, isolated place that terrifies most of the Ancient Demon Clan. As a result, the clansmen are forbidden to enter it. Even if they wre to try enter, many experts of the clan can’t even approach it.”

“Only the clansmen who committed terrible crimes or brought endless losses to the Ancient Demon Clan can be imprisoned in the Heaven-ceasing Peak. Ordinary criminals don’t deserve such terrible punishment.” Su Rou explained seriously.

“In all the years that The Ancient Demon Clan has been in the Samsara Continent, only two have been imprisoned in the Heaven-ceasing Peak.

“One is the second Clan Leader of the Ancient Demon Clan. He made a wrong decision, which resulted in the clan almost being driven from the Samsara mainland. After the crisis, he felt so guilty that he went to the Heaven-ceasing Peak of his own will for a hundred years!

“The other is the most famous traitor in the history of the Ancient Demon Clan. He fled after killing his Master and his parents, and many of the experts who were sent to capture him were also slaughtered. He was an insane Great Demon. It wasn’t until the strongest expert of the clan defeated him that they imprisoned him in the Heaven-ceasing Peak.

“He eventually died from the endless torture of the Heaven-ceasing Peak.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang became extremely serious.

According to what Su Rou’s account, the Heaven-ceasing Peak would be a grave challenge.

“Sister, you mentioned the Heavn-ceasing Peak. Is my mother…” Jian Wushuang asked worriedly.

“I was getting there,” Su Rou replied gravely. “Our expert heard that a woman was imprisoned in the Heaven-ceasing Peak. No one knows who she is, where she came from or why she is imprisoned there. The only thing he managed to find out is that the woman was imprisoned in the Heaven-ceasing Peak about two thousand years ago.”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank in his astonishment.

Su Rou added, “I know you said that mother should be special in the Ancient Demon Clan, except not many of them know about her. Even though the origins of the woman locked in the Heaven-ceasing Peak are unknown, she was captured about two thousand years ago, which matches the timeframe you gave. That’s why I think she may be your mother!”

Jian Wushuang stilled.

He agreed with Su Rou’s guess.

The woman locked in the Heaven-ceasing Peak was most likely his mother.

“The Heaven-ceasing Peak, the Heaven-ceasing Peak!” Jian Wushuang shouted, clenching his fists with an angry look.

“Brother. I have already checked on the Heaven-ceasing Peak for you. The Ancient Demon Clan won’t release her from their forbidden ground alive unless she entered it voluntarily.” Su Rou said, her words heavy.

“However, what matters in this world is strength. When you’re strong enough to overwhelm the Ancient Demon Clan, they will release her at your simple demand. You’re strong now, but not strong enough. You must improve yourself until you are the most powerful man in the realm.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang answered and nodded, unclenching his hands at the same time.

He was angry and agitated when he thought of the Heaven-ceasing Peak, but he could not allow himself to be distracted.

So he calmed himself down.

He was powerful enough to hold his own against the ordinary Holy Masters, and he could defeat some of the lower level ones such as Lin Li. However, he wasn’t strong enough yet to fight against the entirety of the Ancient Demon Clan.

After all, they had three Holy Masters in total.

The strongest of them had reached the highest level of cultivation and was even stronger than the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

“At least I know where my mother is now. Now I just have to put more effort into becoming stronger!”

“Only when I’m as strong as the Void Temple Master, the Samsara Temple Master or the Sunrise Sword Emperor can I attack the Ancient Demon Clan and find my mother!”

“All it takes is power!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed.
