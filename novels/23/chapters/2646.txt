Chapter 2647: Escape!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The boundless Samsara Strength filled every corner of that world.

The Scorpion King was the first person who could sense it as he was also specialized in Transmigration Law.

“Such surge in Samsara Strength, this world is simply born of it.” Scorpion King was completely stunned. “My attack...”

The Scorpion King maneuvered the dark asteroid closest to him and directly lashed out at Li Qianji.

Regardless of size or momentum, the dark asteroid was a level higher than before with an even faster speed. Li Qianji defended himself with all his might when it appeared before him. However...

Bang!

A loud noise.

“What?” Li Qianji was shocked.

He felt a surge of terrifying energy moving toward him. Although it could not kill him, it made his divine body tremble violently as a gulp of blood gushed out from his mouth. He humphed coldly before immediately jumping out.

“The energy of my strike is fifty percent higher than before!!” The Scorpion King was completely shocked and immediately felt ecstatic after that!

On the other hand, the experts from Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower including Bai Tu and Gu Ji were incredibly stunned and angry.

All of them had witnessed the Scorpion King being incapable of breaking down the Magic Formation around him by only relying on his abilities even after swallowing the Holy Witch Mantra Magic Pill. However, his abilities drastically and suddenly increased after the dark Transmigration World appeared!!

The Transmigration World was unleashed by the Earth Ultimate God—Jian Wushuang.

“This kid...”

“He’s only an Earth Ultimate God Territorial Lord, how could he unleash such an incredible technique?”

“World Transformation. This technique is unearthly!!”

Many experts gasped at its marvel. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, they did not know that the Transmigration World was just one of the Thousand Treasures Grand Worlds.

Thousand Treasures Grand World which meant to create the most suitable world for one to fight in accordance to one’s strength—an absolute geographical advantage.

Jian Wushuang specialized in Space-time Law, Transmigration Law, and Sword Principle. Therefore, creating the Space-time, Transmigration, and Sword Principle worlds using the Thousand Treasures Grand Worlds would greatly increase his abilities.

However, such increments did not only help him but also everyone.

Adapting to local conditions.

Experts who studied Transmigration Law would all become a lot stronger in the Transmigration World.

Sword practitioners on the other hand would receive incredible upgrades in the Sword World.

It was as such.

Jian Wushuang knew the moment the Transmigration World was unleashed it would help increase the Scorpion King’s overall abilities by 50 percent, hence he took action without hesitation!!

“Lord Scorpion King, please do it right now!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

The Scorpion King snapped out of his shocked feeling upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words. His sturdy divine power aura began to immediately surge without any hesitation. He once again appeared at the grey Magic Formation’s edge while maneuvering three asteroids. The asteroids were incredibly huge with powerful momentum.

At that moment... Boom boom!!

The three asteroids suddenly landed on the grey Magic Formation.

It was the same move with the Scorpion King previously used with all his might. Although it had initially shaken the grey Magic Formation, it finally stopped the attack. However...the Scorpion King unleashed his move once again under the Transmigration World’s influence which drastically increased the three astroid’s momentum by 50 percent.

It seemed to have gone beyond what the grey Magic Formation could endure after multiple consecutive bombardments.

Bang!

A huge rumble resonated as a gigantic hole was immediately formed on the grey magic formation at the spot where the three asteroids bombarded.

“No!!”

Gu Ji, Bai Tu, and Li Qianji’s expressions changed.

The magic formation was a whole entity by itself as a huge amount of grey energy started dissipating at high speeds the moment one side was breached and caused the entire grey magic formation to collapse in the blink of an eye.

The grey Magic Formation had disappeared!!

That sight made the surviving Crimson Stone Fort Heaven Ultimate Gods and the many Official Army soldiers happy beyond words.

They were trapped within the grey magic formation and waiting to be slaughtered just moments ago.

“Run!!”

“Run. Split up and escape!”

The Heaven Ultimate Gods from Crimson Stone Fort and Northern Darkstar Territory’s Official Army did not hesitate as they began to escape toward various directions in a split second.

Threads of light suddenly started moving toward every direction.

Those Heaven Ultimate Gods’ great personal strength was shown when they escaped at full speed.

The Official Army’s capabilities were also expected. Although their escape tactics were nothing to shout about when compared with Heaven Ultimate Gods, their numbers were huge. Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower had only over 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods and simply could not afford to worry about the fleeing Official Army.

The Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower’s Heaven Ultimate Gods were embarrassed as they could only chase after the few Crimson Stone Fort’s Heaven Ultimate Gods. However, it was not easy to catch them.

On the other hand, the Scorpion King raised his head and laughed after the Magic Formation was broken. He then glided into the surrounding void at full speed just like everybody else.

“Scorpion King, don’t even dream of escaping!!”

Gu Ji’s blue hair was floating in the air as an immense divine power aura swept out of her body as she squealed with her fierce face and blood-red eyes as though blood was about to stream out of them. Blue light threads then shot out like venomous snakes.

The tough and incredibly fast blue light threads shrouded Scorpion King inside and blocked his escape within only a short moment.

Bai Tu and Li Qianji quickly performed their hidden techniques by sacrificing quite a bit of energy to help Gu Ji block the Scorpion King’s escape route.

“So what if you’ve broken open the Magic Formation? You and your Interspatial Ring are our real target. It’s our gain so long we kill you and take the ring,” shouted Gu Ji.

Both Bai Tu and Li Qianji understood that logic as well, hence they did their best to stop the Scorpion King.

The Scorpion King used the nine asteroids to attack fiercely time and again—completely unleashing his strongest battle strength. However, he only managed to break out of their restriction.

“The Holy Witch Mantra Magic Pill’s effect is about to be over...” Scorpion King’s eyes turned frosty.

Its side effects would kick in immediately as soon as the pill’s effect was over. His abilities would decrease sharply, making it impossible to run away from those three Grand Ultimate Gods at that time.

“Jian Yi!”

The Scorpion King growled decisively before waving his hand and lashing out a black thread of light at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang subconsciously grabbed it only to find a black color Interspatial Ring the moment he opened his palm.

Jian Wushuang shuddered as his mind raced and realized what was happening!
