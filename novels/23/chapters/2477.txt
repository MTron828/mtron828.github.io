Chapter 2478: Sword World

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Junior Brother Wushuang could actually evenly fight with Fan Jianxian?”

“That isn’t just anyone, that’s Fan Jianxian!”

Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and the rest of Narcissus Island disciples could only widen their eyes in shock.

Of the three Narcissus Island Elders, Elder Wujian’s face turned blue while Elder Linghe and the Seventh Elder faces were filled with shock.

In the battlefield’s center, the two were frantically flashing with each of them wanting to suppress the other with their speed.

“Fan Jianxian, your moving technique is pretty good.” Jian Wushuang slightly smiled.

“Hmph, don’t dream of surpassing me just because you have a higher understanding in Space-time Law,” scoffed Fan Jianxian.

He might be below Jian Wushuang when it comes to the understanding of laws.

However, he possessed a set of secret techniques on movement skills. With those secret techniques, he could unleash his ultimate speed which was definitely comparable to Jian Wushuang’s speed.

As their speeds were about the same, they could only compete on sword principles.

Ring!

Jian Wushuang held his sword with one hand and swung it at will—chopping, stabbing and sweeping—fully displaying his understanding of sword principles.

As for Fan Jianxian, he was called ‘Sword Immortal’1 and was also the number one sword cultivator of the Wusha Wilderness, hence his accomplishments were evidently extremely high. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was shrouded by Heaven Shaking sword essences, appearing like the dictator of sword principles while displaying his swift and incomparably overpowering sword techniques.

Attack!

Non-stop attacks.

Fan Jianxian’s sword technique had a different yet similar style to Purple Blood Saint’s which leaned more on the one extremities.

He attacked in a frenzy with his sword technique, maniacally oppressive and not leaving any breathing space for Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was able to face those attacks quite calmly in the beginning. However, after a short while, he began to be on the losing side and making passive defenses.

“I’m not as skilled as he is with sword principles. A head-to-head battle puts me at a disadvantage.” Jian Wushuang told himself.

It was understandable, as Jian Wushuang may have lived a rather long life in his previous lifetime, but he did not spend much time on sword principles.

Even though he was advancing at an incredible speed, his current life’s time span was too short and he was also too young. It was only through various opportunities obtained in Saint’s Tomb that allowed him to reach Complete Sword Principle Realm.

However, Fan Jianxian had made a name for himself for a long time. His understanding of the sword had reached Complete Sword Principle Realm and was already at an extremely high level a long time ago.

Fan Jianxian was also very skillful when it came to close-quarter combat.

Hence, it was only normal for Jian Wushuang to be at a disadvantage purely from a sword techniques standpoint.

However, right at that moment...

Ring!

Jian Wushuang’s figure blurred and suddenly three Jian Wushuangs appeared.

Apparitions. It was still a Space-time apparition. The only difference was that Jian Wushuang could form a total of two apparitions.

Together with his true self, it looked like there were three Jian Wushuangs.

“Two Great Apparitions?” Fan Jianxian’s face immediately changed.

Forming a Space-time apparition was the first sign of one reaching the first stage of Space-time Law understanding.

In Saint’s Tomb, Jian Wushuang’s understanding of Space-time Law was already infinitely close to the First Stage of Apparition Forming before studying the Fengtian Scroll. The Fengtian Scroll was an immense help to him. By borrowing the secrets which Fengtian Scroll had revealed to him, he gained huge advancement after ten days despite studying sword techniques, Space-time Law, and Transmigration at the same time.

With regards to Space-time Law, he was not only able to step into the first stage and form his first apparition, but he was also able to form the second one as well.

It showed that he had gained an extraordinary understanding regarding the first stage of Space-time Law.

Every time he gained one more Space-time apparitions, it greatly increased his speed.

As such, when Jian Wushuang formed two apparitions at the same time, his speed had suddenly increased a great deal.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure flashes continuously while his Blood Mountain Sword had shifted from defense to offense and repeatedly attacked Fan Jianxian.

“Damn, his speed is a lot faster than before!” Fan Jianxian’s face turned gloomy.

He had initially successfully suppressed Jian Wushuang with his sword technique, and that was also based on the fact that they were on a similar level of speed.

However, Jian Wushuang was currently moving around Fan Jianxian and completely avoiding head-to-head combat since the great increase in his speed. He was looking for the right opportunities to attack at this moment. It mattered not how skillful Fan Jianxian was with his sword when he could not even touch Jian Wushuang at this point.

“Scram!” Fan Jianxian growled quietly as a flourishing white light was suddenly released from his body.

The extremely blinding white light had lit up Heaven and Earth. In fact, it was a frosty cold sword-light that frenzy projected its attack in every direction.

Jian Wushuang’s figure was forced back by the sword-light and the two of them once again widened their distances from each other.

“Jian Wushuang, I truly have underestimated you.” Fan Jianxian stared at Jian Wushuang with a heavy expression on his face.

Even though he held back a little, a simple clashing of swords showed him that Jian Wushuang’s true abilities were not to be taken lightly.

“You have a very high understanding of sword principles, but based on the understanding of laws, you’re below me. Show me your strongest ability. Otherwise, your reputation as the number one sword cultivator of Wusha Wilderness would have to be given to me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“As you wish.”

Fan Jianxian did not waste any more words as a strong light grew in his eyes.

Ring ring~ Shapeless sword essences swept out from Fan Jianxian’s body. However, what surprised everyone was that sweeping sword essence had then turned solid.

The wall of sword essence swept into every direction like a gigantic domain, almost shrouded the entire battle in an instant.

The dream-like sword essence was like an ocean filling every corner.

Fan Jianxian stood in the epicenter of the sword essence ocean like a dictator of sword principles.

“This...is Sword World?”

Jian Wushuang felt the ocean of infinity sword essences around him and his pupils suddenly shrunk.

Sword World, the first stage of sword principles understanding. The Realm of Swords!

This stage required forming a Sword World within one’s own body. Once the Sword World was completed it would be one with Heaven and Earth.

During future battles, one could then bring out the Sword World from inside their body and suppress their opponent.

The sword essence ocean that swept out of Fan Jianxian was clearly a Sword World!

“Fan Jianxian, he had already formed his own Sword World?” Jian Wushuang also felt rather stunned.

He had studied Purple Blood Saint’s understanding of sword principles in detail and knew how difficult it was to build his own Sword World.

According to the Purple Blood Saint’s words, Sword World was extremely difficult to develop even among Ultimate Gods. There were only a few people who could barely develop their own Sword World. All of them had very strong capabilities and were extremely talented in sword principles.

However, Jian Wushuang had not expected Fan Jianxian to have that kind of capability.
