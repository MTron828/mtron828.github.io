Chapter 2212 Sword Doctrine

“The Sword Doctrine Trial Tower can allow you to experience the higher form of sword doctrine. Just like your first opponent, he is considered a beginner in sword doctrine. If you can defeat him with your sword skills alone, you will be considered a beginner as well,” Emperor Thirteen said.“He is considered a beginner?” Jian Wushuang looked at the devilish young man fiercely.

He waved his hand as the Blood Mountain Sword flew back into his hand.

“Let’s go.”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang attacked once again.

He battled the young man fiercely with all the sword skills he knew.

Before long, he had lost again.

“Again!”

Jian Wushuang was not discouraged and he attacked again.

He was completely immersed in his battle against the young man with a devilish look.

Even though there was a large gap between the understanding of sword doctrine between the two, Jian Wushuang realised he had begun to understand more about the Sword Doctrine after multiple sparring sessions.

“Sword skill can be cast in this manner?”

“Coherence, smooth. A simple sword skill can be more powerful as compared to some top tier ones!”

“Sword, it can be used like this?”

Jian Wushuang was a fast learner.

He lost countless times against the devilish young man. He would always learn something from each and every defeat, whether it was from his battle techniques or from his sword skills.

Or he would figure out certain techniques the young man would use in his sword skills and learn from it.

Even though he was being suppressed in every manner, he was constantly learning from his opponent and slowly becoming a stronger cultivator.

After three years, Jian Wushuang still lost to the devilish young man, but was no longer suppressed.

Five years later, the devilish young man could only suppress Jian Wushuang in the form of sword skills. Even though Jian Wushuang’s defeat was inevitable, it would take longer before he was actually defeated.

Seventeen years later, Jian Wushuang could fight the devilish young man evenly head on.

Thirty two years later...

Clang!

Sparks were created as the long swords collided against each other. Jian Wushuang charged forward as the long sword in his hand turned into lightning and stabbed towards his opponent.

The speed was too fast to be described with words.

Clang!

The tip of the blade collided with the body of the devilish young man. The blade did not pierce his body, but the impact caused him to lose balance and stumble a few steps backwards.

After he steadied himself, the devilish young man looked at Jian Wushuang. This time, he did not attack. At the same time, his body started to evaporate.

“Looks like I finally defeated him.”

A hint of joy was seen in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as he saw the body of the devilish young man start to evaporate.

Up till today, he had been inside the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower for thirty two years.

During this time, he had been constantly battling the devilish young man. They had fought over tens of thousands of times.

Initially, he had been completely suppressed. After all these years of hard work, Jian Wushuang had finally defeated the devilish young man.

There had been great improvements in Jian Wushuang’s sword skills and his understanding of the sword doctrine was a level higher compared to before.

“The reason why I can defeat him is not just because I have a better understanding of the sword doctrine. I have with me Sword Principle Xuan Luo, which was one of the most powerful sword principles back in the ancient past. This helped me out greatly during our battles. If I were to use the most simple sword skills, I would need some more time before I could defeat him with the simple skills,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

However, he could still go even against the devilish young man if he only used the most simple sword skills.

According to Emperor Thirteen, he should be a beginner in Sword Doctrine.

“From an ametuer to a beginner...” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

In the space in front of him, another figure started to form slowly.

This time, his opponent was a graceful lady in white cloak. She had a cold gaze.

This was his second opponent in the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower.

Her sword skills were much stronger compared to the devilish young man’s.

Soon, the lady in white cloak attacked. Jian Wushuang fought back, but was defeated easily.

...

On the floating piece of land, the ancient, black Sword Doctrine Trial Tower stood tall. Emperor Thirteen sat down cross-legged again.

He looked at the tower as his vision turned cloudy.

“Sword Doctrine...”

“There is no end to the Sword Doctrine. Even though I reached the peak of the Sword Doctrine, I still feel that my understanding is not complete!”

“What exactly is the perfect Sword Doctrine?”

Emperor Thirteen muttered to himself before closing his eyes slowly.

He had reached the peak of the Sword Doctrine.

Even during the prime time during the ancient past, few could have reached the level he had. There was almost no one who was stronger than him in the aspect of sword doctrine.

Even so, he was still trying to chase after a better or higher form of Sword Doctrine.

There was no limit to the doctrine.

This was also the case for Sword Doctrine.

Jian Wushuang, who was in the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower, was immersed in the battles he had with countless number of opponents.

He was learning from his imperfections during these battles.

Time continued to pass.

A thousand years flashed by in the blink of an eye.

The Sword Doctrine Trial Tower still stood tall in the vast, dark space.

Two figures were engaged in a heated battle.

Jian Wushuang held his sword single-handedly. He did not use the secret skill of the Ancient God Clan to have nine heads and eighteen arms.

To him now, having eighteen arms and swords had no difference compared to holding one single sword on one hand.

Having too many hands became a burden.

He moved his sword around casually. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It could be a thrust, or a slash, or a flick... Each move was smooth and decisive.

He moved around elegantly and gracefully as he cast his sword skills.

His vision was sharp and focused.

His opponent was an elder with red hair.

The sword skills of this elder were extremely fast and violent.

Jian Wushuang was extremely calm in this battle. During the heated exchange, he was trying his best to find his opponent’s weakness.

After a while, the red-haired man slashed his sword, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up when he saw this move.

He swung the sword in his hands as it thrust out in an eerie manner.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo... Sanguis Extremus style.

Pfftt!

A bloody mist erupted from the elder man’s chest as he backed off.

“This is the sixteenth one,” Jian Wushuang smiled.
