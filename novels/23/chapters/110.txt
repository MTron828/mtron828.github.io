Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

BANG!

A thundering explosion was heard. The fierce collision caused the still water on Quiet Moon Lake to splash upward by several feet high instantly, together with the endless shower droplets and snowflakes.

The risen water was like a tsunami, gurgling~ ~ ~ and rushing towards the surrounding areas directly and violently.

“Step back!”

“Step back immediately!”

A large number of warriors of the Gold Core Realm on the lake were shocked and they were seen to step back immediately one by one.

After the waves finally subsided, the present warriors of the Gold Core Realm that had been drenched, looked at the lake again, and this shocked them.

The center of Quiet Moon Lake had become a depression of several meters’ depth, like a sinkhole. In the center of the “sinkhole”, two figures were battling over a distance of tens of meters. Around them, within a hundred meters, there was not even a single figure.

Everyone had been knocked back by that fierce collision.

It was silent!

The whole Quiet Moon Lake turned to silent immediately.

In this silence, many eyes turned towards Jian Wushuang.

“Isn’t it amazing that he was able to block that?”

“He, blocked that saber from Xiao Mang?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“What’s more, he didn’t even step back!”

“Is he evenly matched with Xiao Mang?”

Everybody was shocked.

They couldn’t believe that just an Initial Gold Core Realm like him was able to block the saber from Xiao Mang and be his match!

Gradually, the center of the depression was filled with water.

Xiao Mang still appeared to be relaxed, but at this moment, he was quite astonished.

“Interesting.” Xiao Mang looked at Jian Wushuang with a subtle smile. “It seems that if I want to take away the Black Water Lotus today, I have to work harder.”

“I’m also determined to win the Black Water Lotus, so if you want to get it, you have to get through me. But I’m sure that you can’t get through me,” said Jian Wushuang coldly.

“You are so confident?” In his eyes, Xiao Mang showed great interest. Then he glanced at the surroundings and said while shaking his head, “There are too many people here, if we fight with each other here, I’m afraid that it will be difficult for us to show our real strength.”

“How about having the competition over there?” Xiao Mang pointed to a lofty mountain nearby and laughed.

Jian Wushuang took a look of the mountain and nodded slightly, “Okay.”

“Haha, then follow me.” Xiao Mang laughed, and they rushed toward the mountain directly.

“Lao Si, you stay here,” Jian Wushuang warned Su Rou. “Don’t worry, I promise to get the Black Water Lotus back.”

Then Jian Wushuang also rushed to the mountain directly.

“Be careful,” Su Rou reminded him, but Jian Wushuang was already out of her sight.

On the Quiet Moon Lake, a large number of warriors of the Gold Core Realm were still in shock.

“Who is that guy? Is he only at the level of Initial Gold Core Realm?”

“It’s too amazing, the power of that confrontation was too intense.”

“There is no doubt that Xiao Mang possesses great strength. After all, he’s established. But it’s incredible that an Initial Gold Core Realm with a sword is evenly matched with Xiao Mang.”

Many warriors of the Gold Core Realm were talking about that.

Suddenly, Gu Tao who stood on the water before dived into the lake.

Many people around were aware of this.

“Gosh! Black Water Lotus Seeds!”

“Damn it. Vie for it quickly!”

“Black Water Lotus Seeds in the water. Vie for it quickly!”

A large number of warriors of the Gold Core Realm on the surface of water responded immediately. A crowd of warriors dived into the lake subsequently.

Remember, Xiao Mang won the Black Water Lotus just now, but he threw seven lotus seeds into lake casually. Although it had been a while, seven lotus seeds must be in the water.

As Black Water Lotus Seeds had a unique fragrance, it was not difficult to find them.

Soon, the first Black Water Lotus Seed was found.

Immediately, a fierce slaughter erupted after the seed was found.

When almost every warrior dived into lake water to search for the black lotus Seeds, on the lake, there was a girl in black named Su Rou staring at that lofty mountain with her dark eyes.

“Lao San.” There was a little worry in the eyes of Su Rou.

She wasn’t worried about whether Jian Wushuang could bring the Black Water Lotus back to her or not, but worried for the safety of Jian Wushuang.

After all, the man that Jian Wushuang was fighting with was Xiao Mang who was ranked the twenty-second on the Earthly Dragon List.

And Xiao Mang had become famous on the Earth Dragon List for so many years, and during these years, he seldom fought with others, which was the reason why he was still ranked around the twenties. But as for his real strength, who knew?

” I hope Lao San can really match up with Xiao Mang. Even if he can’t, as long as he survives, it will be fine. ” With a cold expression, Su Rou glanced at the lake underfoot, and the next moment, she also dived into the water directly to participate in the competition for Black Water Lotus Seeds.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures rapidly darted in the jungle one after another. After a while, both of them appeared at the top of the mountain where boulders were found everywhere. It could be called a boulders forest.

At a distance of about ten meters, Jian Wushuang and Xiao Mang stood on different boulders, staring at each other.

“Until now, I don’t know your name.” Xiao Mang said.

“Swordsman from Dragon Palace.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Disciple of Dragon Palace?” Xiao Mang raised his brow. “Well, as expected. Only the legendary Disciples of Dragon Palace are able to block me while at Initial Gold Core Realm.”

“But, you should know that I didn’t try my best just now,” said Xiao Mang.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded, and then he added, “Coincidentally, I didn’t do my best, either.”

“Haha, this is much more interesting,” Xiao Mang grinned, then he took out the Black Water Lotus and put it into the Interspatial Ring in front of Jian Wushuang. After that, Xiao Mang threw it aside casually.

The Interspatial Ring flew in a streak, like a concealed weapons given its rapid speed. It hit a tree at the edge of mountaintop. Due to the force of the throw it became deeply embedded in the trunk.

“The Black Water Lotus is in the Interspatial Ring. After the battle, the winner can take it away.” Said Xiao Mang.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded, with a strong battle intent rising in his eyes.

The similar desire to battle sparkled in the eyes of Xiao Mang.

His blood had been still for a long time, but it started to boil at this moment.
