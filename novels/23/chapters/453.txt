Chapter 454: A Dao Weapon

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“We don’t expect you to help us. It’ll be fine as long as you don’t drag us down,” said Silver Wing Lord to Jian Wushuang.

Iron Saber Lord gave Jian Wushuang a casual glance, his expression clearly said that he did not take Jian Wushuang’s words seriously.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang forced a smile.

It was all because he was only in the Saint Realm, which caused the lords’ to despise him.

“Silver Wing Lord doesn’t know my real battle strength and that I’m not weaker than him,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Iron Saber Lord is an advanced lord, so I’m no match for him, but I’m sure that I would at least stand a chance against Silver Wing Lord since he’s an intermediate lord.”

Right then...

“Eh?” Iron Saber Lord suddenly turned over his hand, revealing a Messaging Slip.

The slip instantly started burning by itself.

“This is a Messaging Slip from Spirit Lord. Normally, he wouldn’t use it unless there was an emergency.” Iron Saber Lord looked serious.

Jian Wushuang and Silver Wing Lord looked toward his hand.

After the slip finished burning, a hazy figure appeared. Though they could not see his appearance very clearly, they still recognized that it was Spirit Lord.

“Iron Saber,” said the figure in Spirit Lord’s voice, “Is there anyone with you?”

“Yes, Silver Wing Lord and...” Iron Saber Lord glanced at Jian Wushuang and continued, “Just Silver Wing Lord and I.” He had wanted to add Jian Wushuang’s name, but decided against it due to Jian Wushuang only being in the Saint Realm.

“You and Silver Wing?” After a moment of pondering, the figure waved his hand, causing a map to appear in front of them. It was a map of this mansion.

The figure pointed at an area on the map and said, “At this position, a fierce battle is taking place over a treasure. Loftiness Lord, from our camp, discovered it, but Marquis Cangyue’s camp doesn’t want to let it go. More and more people are gathering there, so you two should go there as soon as possible.”

“Remember, whatever it takes, you can’t let Marquis Cangyue’s camp take the treasure from us.”

Upon hearing this, Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord looked solemn.

“Whatever it takes?” Iron Saber Lord asked with a frown, “Spirit, what in the world is the treasure?”

The figure fell silent for a moment before saying, “A Dao Weapon.”

“What!”

Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord were both astonished when they heard the answer.

“A Dao Weapon?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes became sharp.

After such a long time in the Divine Land, he was no longer the naive boy from the Nanyang Continent.

He knew that once one becomes as powerful as a lord, he would process a first-grade magic weapon, even though they were very precious and rare in the Divine Land. So they were not that precious to a lord.

Even Jian Wushuang himself had a first-grade magic weapon, not to mention that more than ten of them had been found in this mansion during the past several days.

Simply put, first-grade magic weapons were not that important to lords. However, a Dao Weapon, that was a different story!

Dao Weapons were superior to the first-grade magic weapons, but they only existed in legend.

Moreover, the reason they were called Dao weapons was because each one was connected to a supreme “Dao”, which was a power that was far more advanced and formidable than the Origin.

In general, even a marquis might not process a Dao Weapon, let alone a lord. This was exactly why the news that a Dao Weapon was found in this mansion had rocked everyone.

“As far as I know, our marquis and Marquis Cangyue are both in the Seven-cloud Realm, but neither of them has a Dao Weapon. I guess they have other businesses and have not heard the news yet. Otherwise, they would already be here,” Iron Saber Lord said.

“A Dao Weapon!” Silver Wing Lord chimed in with admiration.

A Dao Weapon could capture the hearts of many marquises.

“Iron Saber, Silver Wing, you two head there right now and support Loftiness Lord. Tell him that he must definitely take the weapon back intact.” After saying this, Spirit Lord’s figure immediately disappeared.

“Let’s go before it’s too late,” Iron Saber Lord said to Silver Wing Lord and Jian Wushuang.

“Ok.” The two nodded.

In no time, the three were headed towards their destination.

Since they were close to the area, it only took them an hour to get there.

But they were completely stupefied by what they saw when they arrived.

Right in front of them was a huge open space, about the size of a Martial Arts Practice Field, with dozens of people fighting each other.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Deafening noise resounded throughout the whole area as terrifying waves of power continuously surged through the area, landing the surrounding walls and leaving craters in them.

This was the effect of more than 40 lords displaying their magnificent auras and fighting amongst themselves.

“Is this what a battle between 40 lords is like?”?Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord looked grave.

Among the fighters, two figures attracted the most attention. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

One of them was a short old lady, who glowed with a green light, and the other one was a tall man, who was over two meters high and looked like a brown bear.

“She is Demon Soul Lord, from Marquis Cangyue’s camp.”

“How long has this old witch lived? Why is she still alive?”

Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord looked toward the old lady with fear.

The lady had been super experts for many many years, and they had reached the Six-cloud Realm long ago. As a superior lord, she was only a step away from becoming a marquis.

At this moment, she was still in the Six-cloud Realm, but she had become much stronger than before.
