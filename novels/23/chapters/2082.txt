Chapter 2083 Invitation

“Ancient Emperor,” King Chen Xing immediately looked over.

“Before I arrived here, you were the person in charge of the Ancient God Sanctuary. You should’ve received a message from the Sanctuary Alliance right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Indeed,” King Chen Xing nodded. “The message came from Ancestor Tian Chen personally from the Alliance, stating the calamity the Eternal Chaotic World was facing. I told him I’d prepare everything that’s needed, but the brawl within the Ancient God Clan hindered that process.”

Jian Wushuang looked at King Chen Xing. He understood what had really happened.

He knew King Chen Xing was going to get rid of King Luo Yu and others, then get the Ancient God Clan to step up once everything had settled down.

Unfortunately, everything had spiraled beyond his control.

“The Three-Emperors World, Holocaust Sect, Acheron Palace, they’re all public enemies of the Eternal Chaotic World. What they do not only threatens the Sanctuary Alliance and the human domain, but the entire Eternal Chaotic World. We cannot avoid this battle, we must prepare for it,” Jian Wushuang instructed.

“Aye,” King Chen Xing nodded.

Now that everything had settled down within the Ancient God Clan, and Jian Wushuang had given the order, all they needed to do was gather the experts for battle. That was not hard.

“Besides our Clan, other tribes and clans should have received the same message, but no response has been heard from them since. We need to think of a way to speed them up.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was clear.

The Ancient Gods below the throne looked up towards Jian Wushuang. “King Luo Yu, didn’t you want to organise the coronation ceremony? If it’s a ceremony, a lot of experts from different clans will be invited right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Aye,” King Luo Yu nodded.

“If that’s the case, use this ceremony to get all the experts over. Not just the other top three tribes, but every clan that has the ability. As long as they have one Almighty within the clan, send an invitation to them, and get the person in charge to attend. At least someone with a voice in decision-making.”

“As the Ancient God Clan, this shouldn’t be tough to do right?” Jian Wushuang said solemnly.

“Rest assured Ancient Emperor, we’ll make the arrangements right away, guaranteeing every important person will be there,” King Luo Yu replied.

“Good, make the arrangements now. Remember, be quick about it,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Yes.”

King Luo Yu and the others quickly made their way out for the preparations.

Jian Wushuang was left alone on the throne, and let out a slight sigh. He was weirded out.

“Ancient God Emperor? The leader of such an awesome clan, I could get used to this,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

At this moment, a transmission token from his Qian Kun Ring was activated.

“Jian Wushuang.” It was Emperor Bai.

“Oh, Emperor Bai,” Jian Wushuang replied immediately.

“What’s your situation now?”

“I have taken the entire Ancient God Clan under my wing as an Ancient God Emperor, the real deal. The coronation ceremony will begin in a month,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Wow, Ancient God Emperor? Congrats,” Emperor Bai laughed. “The other Clans?”

“Those I do not know about. I have made the arrangements for their leaders or decision-making elders to attend my coronation ceremony. I’ll discuss it with them during the ceremony,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“No need to rush, the Dark Millstone has stopped. The next battle will not be a simple one. Troops from the Three-Emperors World won’t be able to make their moves for now,” Emperor Bai replied.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Also, I need to talk to you about something else,” Emperor Bai’s voice sounded serious. “Our Sanctuary Alliance scout at the Sky Devouring Sanctuary has news, spotting experts from either the Archelon Palace or Holocaust Sect interacting with the Sky Devouring Clan. The Sky Devouring Clan’s actions are getting suspicious too. Take note.”

“Sky Devouring Clan?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed.

There were four top Clans amongst the special tribes.

The Sky Devouring Clan was one of the four, like the Ancient God Clan. Both had their own Sanctuaries, and their strength and influence were not to be messed with.

But now, suspected experts from the Archelon Palace or Holocaust Sect were seen on Sky Devouring grounds?

Suspicious actions from the Sky Devouring Clan themselves?

“Emperor Bai, what you’re saying is that the Sky Devouring Clan is now siding with the Three Emperors World?” Jian Wushuang asked. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I can’t be sure about that, but it’s possible. After all, that Clan’s the most eccentric of the four top Clans. The other three would never switch sides. But them? Maybe,” Emperor Bai replied.

“Understood, I’ll do my best to figure out what’s happening,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Be careful, if you get into trouble and can’t settle it with your Ancient God Clan alone, let me know. I’ll send people from the Sanctuary Alliance.” With that being said, Emperor Bai disconnected the transmission.

Jian Wushuang remained there in his throne, but his face was now darkened.

The Sky Devouring Clan, as one of the top four Clans, has so much influence on the other clans.

If the Sky Devouring Clan really swapped sides, that would be a big blow for those Clans that follow it.

“I hope the leader of the Sky Devourers are not that foolish, if not…”

Jian Wushuang had a cold gaze.

…

With a new Ancient God Emperor emerging from the Ancient God Clan, a coronation ceremony was planned for a month from now, with many tribes and clans coming over to attend.

This news took the entire special tribe domain by storm.

Many experts from tribes and clans all over were shocked when they heard the news.

After all, after the Ancient God Emperor collapsed from the First Era, there was not another Ancient God Emperor.

The affairs within the Ancient God Clan were always handled by King Chen Xing, and for a long period now.

But now…

A new Emperor?

And not King Chen Xing, but an Ancient God expert with true Bloodline of Emperors?

And this new Emperor was from the human domain?
