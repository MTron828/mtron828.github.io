“Such a strong murderous intention.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Wu Cang before him and felt the terrifying murderous intention soaring from his body. His pupils contracted.

In Sky Sword Prison, the massacring was crazy. There was no reason required to kill anyone.

In the mad massacre, the experts in the prison had terrifying murderous intentions.

Jian Wushuang flipped his wrist and Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand instantly.

“Haha, I shall see just how powerful you are newbie, and see if you can live in Sky Sword Prison,” Wu Cang laughed and suddenly his figure turned vague.

Swoosh!

A ghostly figure suddenly appeared before Jian Wushuang and there was a green saber that swung out.

“So fast!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The expert information provided by Luo Meng highlighted that Wu Cang was good with swords and his close combat power was strong. It noted that his divine body was strong too but there weren’t any specifications on how fast his speed was.

Then, the speed that Wu Cang showed caught Jian Wushuang by surprise.

The moment the blade light descended, Jian Wushuang transformed his divine power and Blood Sword Mountain became a ray of crimson shadow to counter-attack.

Dang!

There was a loud clash and the fierce strength spread. Jian Wushuang’s figure shook faintly.

“Terrifying strength too. Although his divine power is only at the standard of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, he has cultivated some kind of secret skill and the secret skill increased his divine power, which seems to be stronger by a nose compared to mine,” Jian Wushuang sighed. The next moment, the power of Blood-killing Plate Armor erupted and his strength increased tremendously.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword swept out like a snake and instantly pierced five holes in the void. However, Wu Cang’s figure moved around creepily and dodged the five attacks easily.

Then, there was green light flowing out from his body that looked like a green dragon.

“Triple Abrupt Lightning!”

Wu Cang held his saber with both his hands and slashed three times at lightning speed.

The three slashes contained boundless power, just like three strikes of lightning that suddenly descended.

Jian Wushuang immediately wielded his sword to withstand it.

Dang! Dang! Dang!

There were three loud clashes and Jian Wushuang staggered backwards from the attack.

“Newbie, your power is only at such level?” Wu Cang stood there and looked at Jian Wushuang with disdain.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave and there was a sudden soaring sword intention from his body.

A fierce divine power suddenly erupted.

Wow!

A sword light suddenly shined out.

The sword light was like a frightened swan. It instantly disappeared. However, as it whistled, there was an extremely terrifying, shrill aura that swept past.

Sword Principle, Frightened Swan!

It was created by Jian Wushuang after comprehending for seventy years under the nine sword mountains in Sky Sword Mountain.

It was the most ferocious stroke that Jian Wushuang had ever created.

The moment he performed the stroke, Jian Wushuang immersed the slight bit of Power of Heaven Way that he had comprehended into the Sword Principle.

The sudden explosion!

“Rank three strongest Unique Skill?”

Wu Cang looked at the sudden stroke of Frightened Swan with a scornful look.

“Such a joke!”

Wu Cang bellowed and took a huge stride. His body was like a green dragon while his blade was like a bolt of abrupt lightning. Hualala. Boundless thunderous power swept out.

“Thunderous Green Dragon!”

Roar!

There was suddenly a huge green dragon that plundered out form Wu Cang’s body. The green dragon immersed itself in the blade light and the power of blade light instantly increased in power tremendously.

The stroke was obviously a Real God unique skill that Wu Cang had created.

Suddenly, the two bolts of terrifying attack collided.

There was a loud thud and the Sky Sword Prison faintly shook. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What?”

Wu Cang’s facial expression suddenly changed. Jian Wushuang had only performed Sword Principle of rank three strongest unique skill so he didn’t bother much. After they collided, he felt an extremely strong power from the sword principle. The power was the power of Heaven Way.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Due to the impact, both Jian Wushuang and Wu Cang staggered backwards.

The Frightened Swan that Jian Wushuang had performed was only a rank three strongest unique skill after all. In terms of power, there was a huge difference compared to Real God unique skill that Wu Cang performed. However, due to the power of Reincarnation, the two could be well-matched.

“Young man, you’re a newbie but you have already comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way?” Wu Cang’s eyes were bloodshot red and obviously green with envy.

One must know that he had been in Sky Sword Prison for almost a million years. Through countless life and death situations, he had yet to comprehend even a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang, who just come to Sky Sword Prison and had yet to experience a massacre in Sky Sword Prison, had already comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way. He was, of course, jealous.

“You comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way. Although you only created a rank three strongest unique skill, you are evenly matched with me. I can’t kill you but I can teach you a lesson,” Wu Cang’s face was cold.

“Teach me a lesson?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and then came back to reality.

Swoosh!

Wu Cang’s figure turned into a bolt of lightning and leaped before Jian Wushuang, then he slashed.

Not only was he fast, but he was extremely ferocious too.

Jian Wushuang immediately raised his sword to block.

Just as he blocked the first slash, wow! wow! wow! Blade lights swept towards him like billowing waves one after another.

Too fast, too ferocious. They were extremely strong.

The terrifying blade light formed into an ocean and engulfed him.

The explosion of Jian Wushuang’s divine power reached his limit and he wielded his sword to block.

Right after he blocked the few blade lights, Wu Cang’s figure moved again in an unexplainable manner and appeared next to Jian Wushuang again. His body became a saber and hit Jian Wushuang as though he was a slash by a saber. That very moment, not only his body but also his thighs, knees and arms were like sabers slashing with flexibility.

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“This… this is a close combat fight?”

It was close combat fight!

The information that Luo Meng had provided him with highlighted Wu Cang’s ability with close combat skills.

Although Jian Wushuang noticed it previously, he didn’t expect that Wu Cang’s close combat skill would be that strong.

His body was like a saber!

Every part of his body that could be used for attack seemed to have turned into a saber.

From the continuous attack, Jian Wushuang was suppressed. Although he had amazing power, he couldn’t give play to his power at all but he could only retreat. He was totally in a fix.

Rumble!

Wu Cang’s thighs were like the back of the saber. It broke Jian Wushuang’s defense and hit his body. Then, Jian Wushuang’s body immediately turned into a flowing light and erupted.

Swoosh!

Wu Cang’s body paused in the void. With a cold smirk, he looked at Jian Wushuang who finally steadied himself from afar.

“That’s enough teaching. I shall leave.”

Wow!

Wu Cang suddenly retreated and also at lightning speed. Very soon, he disappeared from Jian Wushuang’s eyes.
