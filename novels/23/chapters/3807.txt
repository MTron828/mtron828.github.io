Chapter 3811: Can’t Be Killed?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Foreign...foreign...people...die!”

A low, intermittent roar came out of the mouth of the dark red monster.

Although the voice was not very clear, Jian Wushuang still heard it clearly.

“This dark red monster can talk?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

The reason why he took the initiative to fight with the dark red monster was that he wanted to know more about the dark red monster.

Now he knew that the dark red monster’s two arms were extremely hard, comparable to an advanced Universe Supreme Treasure. In addition, the dark red monster could speak simply.

Boom!

The dark red monster turned into a red stream of light and rushed up.

Jian Wushuang only felt a surge of evil aura pressing toward him.

“This evil aura is really strong.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

The dark red monster extended its arms like two sharp sabers.

Swish! Swish!

As the dark red monster swung its arms, the air was immediately cut open, and two cold-blooded saber lights chopped down on its head.

Not only were the two saber lights extremely powerful, but they also contained a strong sense of destruction, and even the saber lights themselves were quite mysterious.

“Saber skills?”

“This dark red monster clearly has very low intelligence, but it can also use saber skills. Moreover, this saber skill is quite exquisite?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

However, although the saber skills of the dark red monster were quite exquisite, they were nothing in front of Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang’s body flashed, and then he easily passed through the gap between the two saber lights, he was already approaching the dark red monster.

Jian Wushuang casually thrust the Netherworld Divine Sword forward.

A blood-red flower bud seemed to have bloomed. The dark red monster’s chest directly exploded, revealing a bowl-sized bloody hole. The white bones in its body could be clearly seen through the bloody hole.

“Fortunately, the monster’s arms are very hard, but the other parts of its body have not reached that level,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

His sword attack just now did not increase in power, just like the sword attack on the arm of the dark red monster.

But the previous sword attack only left a white mark on the arm of the dark red monster.

But now, the sword attack on the chest of the dark red monster broke the surface defense of the dark red monster and hurt it.

Obviously, the dark red monster’s body was not as hard as an advanced Universe Supreme Treasure. Jian Wushuang estimated that the other parts of its body were only comparable to an elementary Universe Supreme Treasure. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“However, this monster is indeed very strong. It’s very close to a Superior Ruler. In addition, its saber technique is not very durable. Its battle strength is indeed very strong among Advanced Rulers. Perhaps one or two of them is nothing, but if there are six or seven of them together, they can indeed pose a threat to an ordinary Superior Ruler,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Jian Wushuang had been studying the dark red monster.

However, the dark red monster was already furious, especially after Jian Wushuang had broken its chest with his sword.

The dark red monster had low intelligence, so it did not know how to distinguish the strength of its opponent. It did not even know the law of the jungle.

Born in the Dark Magic Region, the dark red monster only knew one thing. As long as it was an outsider, it had to kill it at all costs.

“Kill, kill!”

A series of low roars were heard, and the dark red monster charged again.

Jian Wushuang also tried to fight it, but he found that the bloody hole in the dark red monster’s chest had been completely repaired and there was no trace left.

The monster’s strength was still at its peak.

“Immortal body?”

“No, this monster doesn’t have divine power at all. It just uses the muffled power of its body. It’s completely different from a cultivator at the Ruler level. It shouldn’t have an immortal body, but its injuries have been completely healed.”

Jian Wushuang casually attacked and completely suppressed the dark red monster. However, he did not kill it directly. Instead, he deliberately reserved his strength to fight with the dark red monster.

He wanted to understand the dark red monster more deeply.

Soon, dozens of breaths passed.

“This monster is really stupid. Its strength is obviously far inferior to mine. No matter how crazy it is, it will still be easily crushed by me. However, from the beginning of the fierce battle until now, it has no intention of escaping.”

“Obviously, it can’t beat me, but it still wants to kill me crazily.” Jian Wushuang shook his head with a smile, but he was pondering in his heart. “I have a good understanding of the monster’s strength, speed, and methods. The only thing I don’t understand is its body composition. I don’t know whether it really has an immortal body. In this case, there is no need to tangle with it.”

A fierce light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Whoosh!

A shadow flashed and a dazzling sword light lit up at the same time.

The entire head of the dark red monster had been thrown away. Then Jian Wushuang blew a breath and a sword light directly crushed the head.

“Is it dead?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the body of the dark red monster in front of him.

Although it had lost its head, the body of the dark red monster was still moving freely. Its two arms were still crazily slashing at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s not dead?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly. After dodging the saber light of the dark red monster, he saw that the head of the dark red monster had grown back.

Jian Wushuang attacked again.

First, he crushed the head of the dark red monster. Then, he pierced the heart of the dark red monster with his sword. Finally, he used a huge divine power attack to crush the entire body of the dark red monster.

However, the dark red monster was still beautiful. It was alive and full of battle strength.

“What’s going on?”

Jian Wushuang frowned. “This monster’s body is extremely tough. Although my attacks can hurt it, it’s difficult to destroy it on a large scale. It obviously doesn’t have an immortal body, but how can its injuries be healed instantly, including its head and heart?”

He clearly had the strength to crush the dark red monster, but now he could not kill it.

“No, this dark red monster must have a weakness, but I haven’t found it yet.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

Devil Flame, who was in the Blood-Red Gourd, had been paying attention to the outside world. Just like Jian Wushuang, he had been observing the dark red monster.

After seeing that the dark red monster’s head and heart were instantly repaired, Devil Flame immediately thought of a group.
