Chapter 5559: Imprisoned Special Life Forms

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Desolation!

Beneath the blood-red array, on the desolate land, lay dozens of peculiar-looking beings. Their faces contorted with ferocity, their bodies constantly suppressed and devoured by a force.

This sensation had tormented them for countless years.

As the Zhen Ling descended, these Special Life Forms, exhausted and tormented, one by one stood up, glaring at the Zhen Ling with gritted teeth.

It was the old man with a white beard before them who had oppressed them.

These Special Life Forms, born in the heavens and earth, were originally free and powerful creatures. How could they willingly accept being confined here? Therefore, they harbored resentment and fear towards the Zhen Ling.

Although they dreaded the Zhen Ling, there was no fear in their hearts, but rather a strong determination to fight!

“Damn it!” A Special Life Form with spiral horns on its head glared fiercely at the Zhen Ling.

The other Special Life Forms also gathered around, staring at the Zhen Ling.

The Zhen Ling swept his gaze around and chuckled, “After all these years, you still haven’t gotten rid of that foul temper!”

In fact, it hadn’t been that long since he suppressed them; it had only been a few million years since the Qishen Temple opened.

For these unruly Special Life Forms, even a moment of confinement was unbearable.

“Humph, we, the innate war gods who wander the God’s Tomb, dared you to imprison us. Aren’t you afraid of the rules of this heaven and earth?” one of the Special Life Forms said.

The Zhen Ling, however, dismissed it. He controlled the rules of this heaven and earth; what did he have to fear?

“Tsk tsk, you stubborn wooden blocks are truly unyielding!” The Zhen Ling shook his head.

Initially, he had planned to subdue these Special Life Forms, considering their formidable strength compared to the waste in the Elder Palace.

However, their stubborn temperaments proved to be a headache, so he suppressed them here.

The Zhen Ling couldn’t be bothered with further words. He straightforwardly said, “You want to get out, right? Well, now there’s a chance!”

Upon hearing the opportunity to leave, the Special Life Forms’ eyes gleamed with excitement, once again approaching.

The leading Special Life Form’s expression changed, also tempted. However, aware of the opponent’s peculiar methods and cunning nature, he hesitated and retorted, “Why should we believe you?”

Zhen Ling, however, was disdainful.

These fools, if they don’t believe in him, who else can they believe in?

In the Qishen Temple, his word was law. Without his command, these Special Life Forms would be permanently suppressed.

Within the God’s Tomb, any Special Life Form with uncontrollable power would be suppressed.

“Hmph!” Zhen Ling coldly remarked, “If you don’t believe, then stay here forever!”

Having said that, he pretended to leave.

Those Special Life Forms became anxious immediately. Several of the powerful ones, including the one with spiral horns, stepped forward to block Zhen Ling, not to attack him but out of curiosity.

“The opportunity you mentioned, does it involve us submitting to you?” they inquired.

“Not entirely! It’s just that the requirement might be a bit dangerous. If you’re afraid, forget it,” Zhen Ling casually replied, continuing to walk forward.

The strongest among the Special Life Forms began to discuss in hushed tones.

As long as it didn’t involve submission, they had no issues accepting it. As for fear?

Naturally born extraordinary beings, who among them would be afraid?

Even if a formidable figure like Zhen Ling personally descended, they wouldn’t be scared.

“Alright! We agree!” the Special Life Forms spoke up one after another.

Zhen Ling chuckled inwardly, finding these Special Life Forms as thoughtless as ever.

Compared to the Chishui on the Grave God Mountain, these beings here were like a group of children.

Zhen Ling revealed a smile and said, “That’s more like it! You are the strongest beings in the Four Great Secret Realms. How can you be afraid of death!”

Saying this, he glanced at a few hesitant Special Life Forms in the corner.

Upon hearing his words, the remaining Special Life Forms gritted their teeth and also stepped forward.

All 72 Special Life Forms agreed.

The Zhen Ling voiced his request.

He wasn’t afraid of these Special Life Forms changing their minds; their reputation and dignity mattered most to them.

“A Half-Step Universe Master?”

Upon hearing Zhen Ling’s request, they revealed a hint of wariness.

Facing a formidable enemy, instead of fear, a surge of fighting spirit overcame them.

Staying within the God’s Tomb, they had never encountered powerful supreme-peak cultivators. The strongest were the 13 Spirit Guardians.

Their strength wasn’t particularly formidable, but they possessed some kind of treasure that could specifically suppress them.

Now, hearing Zhen Ling’s proposal to accompany them to slay two Half-Step Universe Masters, excitement brewed in their hearts.

“As long as this task succeeds, not only can I restore your freedom, but in the future, you can freely traverse the Four Great Secret Realms, and I won’t interfere, as long as it’s not wanton slaughter. I won’t meddle in your actions!”

Zhen Ling, fearing that these unique beings might not exert themselves, dangled a massive temptation.

Upon hearing that success would grant them the ability to travel freely between the Four Great Secret Realms, these Special Life Forms became even more enthusiastic.

They had been in the God’s Tomb for countless epochs, living in the tomb since their inception. When the boundary between realms was broken, they were captured upon their first attempt to explore the other three realms and were confined here, harboring deep resentment.

Now, with Zhen Ling’s promise that they could freely traverse the Four Great Secret Realms in the future, expressions of joy emerged.

Each of these Special Life Forms had a divine body that surpassed 60,000-fold.

The strongest among them had already reached nearly 80,000-fold divine body, slightly stronger than Dragon God.

Comparable to Yun Zhong.

If their freedom were truly restored, the Four Great Secret Realms would likely be thrown into chaos.

The cunning Zhen Ling, however, never intended to grant them true freedom.

He wanted to lead these Special Life Forms to the First Prison, though his true form wouldn’t be going.

If his true form were to go, there would be no need for these Special Life Forms’ assistance.

He intended to send the clone he had forged in the Black Tortoise Temple.

Although the clone crafted by the Black Tortoise Temple moved through time and space with unparalleled grace, it ultimately lacked the strength of the true self and required some assistance. These Special Life Forms proved to be the best allies.

Each possessed formidable strength, brimming with a strong sense of combativeness.

At the very least, they wouldn’t idly stand by like those associated with Wu Zuo, daring to be indifferent.

At that time, regardless of success or failure, they would all be permanently trapped in the First Prison.

A permanent solution!

There was no need to worry about these individuals anymore.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Granting them freedom would only leave behind a source of trouble for oneself, whether they succeeded or not.

Despite the simplicity of these extraordinary beings’ minds, when it came to causing trouble, no one could control them.

When the time came, the White Tiger Temple would have to take drastic measures against them.

Now, with chaos rampant in the Earthly Realm, it was already enough to give the White Tiger Temple a headache.

If these Special Life Forms were to enter the Earthly Realm in the future, it would truly lead to widespread disorder.

Moreover, apart from the Zhen Ling and a few Temple Masters and Divine Generals, no one else could subdue these Special Life Forms.
