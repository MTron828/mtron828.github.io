Although Jian Wushuang had fought against the Ultimate Ruler in the third level, it was still in the nine luminaries star area, which was almost completely destroyed by the disaster, naturally, no one knew his actual strength.

No one even knew how high his comprehension of the principles of the universe was.

But Ninth Kalpa King was different.

Those who stayed in the Life Palace all year round knew a lot about Ninth Kalpa King’s strength.

Once upon a time, he was publicly acknowledged as the number one genius in the Life Palace. Moreover, he had received countless resources and benefits from the Life Palace at the Ruler level. In the Ultimate Ruler realm, he had already remained there for dozens of chaos cycles. In addition, the power he had displayed during those twenty chaos cycles had already reached a terrifying level. During those twenty chaos cycles, he had rarely fought. His power and his trump cards…he had long ago reached a level where no one could see through him!

No one knew how much power he had reached during those twenty chaos cycles before becoming an Ruler!

It could be said that Ninth Kalpa King was the uncrowned king of the Ruler realm in the vast universe!

He was the number one in the universe!

They could not figure out how Jian Wushuang, who had cultivated for more than 300,000 years, could fight Ninth Kalpa King!

Was it because their realms were similar in the trial field?

Or was it because Jian Wushuang had a huge Divine Body that made his divine power stronger than Ninth Kalpa King’s?

Even so, he was still no match for Ninth Kalpa King, right?

At this moment, Ruler Blood Wave led countless people to the green temple.

“Jian Wushuang, this temple is the location of the trial. Ninth Kalpa doesn’t seem to be here yet. Wait here,” Ruler Blood Wave ordered.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Ruler Blood Wave had already rushed toward the void nearby.

As Jian Wushuang arrived, there was a commotion in the surrounding void.

“Is he Jian Wushuang?”

“Does he look ordinary?”

“As expected, he’s only a third-level Ruler and has been cultivating for less than 300,000 years. Tsk, tsk, he’s too young.”

“To be able to have such achievements after cultivating for 300,000 years is already very heaven-defying.”

Some of the experts who came to watch the battle laughed.

At the same time, in the void on the other side of the Cyan Temple, there were three Supreme-level experts whose aura could suppress the ancients.

“Blood Wave, did Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body expand to 68,000 miles in the Life Nirvana Pool?” An old man with white hair, white eyebrows, and a black robe, who was full of rotten aura, asked indifferently.

“Ruler Gai Fu, this is absolutely true!” Ruler Blood Wave, who was half a body behind the old man, nodded and replied.

“In that case, this is interesting.” The old man raised his eyelids, and his turbid eyes were calm and emotionless.

This man was none other than Gai Fu, the strongest of the five Chief Supremes of the Life Palace!

He had cultivated for so long that it was impossible for him to record it. Even the chief supremacies such as Blood Wave and Giant Axe could only call themselves juniors in front of him.

It could be said that his position in the entire Life Palace was second only to that of the mysterious Palace Master.

This was not the most important thing. The most important thing was that he had brought Ninth Kalpa King to the Life Palace from a remote Star World.

He had not expected that the battle between Ninth Kalpa King and Jian Wushuang would draw him out.

“Blood Wave, you shouldn’t have let Jian Wushuang fight. Ninth Kalpa King has cultivated for dozens of chaos cycles, and Jian Wushuang has only cultivated for less than 300,000 years. His foundation is too weak. If Jian Wushuang loses this battle, it may cause some damage to him and hinder his future development,” said Giant Axe, one of the three Supreme figures, he frowned as he spoke.

“Giant Axe, you’ve underestimated this little fellow. When I first brought him here, he was filled with confidence in this battle,” Ruler Blood Wave said with a mysterious smile.

“It’s good to be confident, but blind confidence is arrogance,” Ruler Gai Fu said.

“Although I have high hopes for this little fellow as well, and I believe that when he grows up in the future, he’ll be even more powerful than the Ninth Kalpa King, that’s only after he grows up. As for now...I really don’t know how he’ll be able to defeat the Ninth Kalpa King after just 300,000 years of training,” Supreme Giant Axe said, shaking his head.

“Haha, let’s wait and see.” Blood Wave smiled and said nothing more.

Time passed slowly. Not long after Jian Wushuang arrived at the arena, the white-haired young man, Ninth Kalpa King, who was dressed in black and had a cold expression, also arrived.

“Jian Wushuang, you came very quickly.” Ninth Kalpa King looked at Jian Wushuang with a teasing smile.

“You came too slowly.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Ninth Kalpa King coldly.

“You should know the principles of the trial field. You and I only enter it with our consciousness. The trial field will fight according to our new divine bodies. However, considering that you’re only a third-level Ruler, I won’t bully you. The divine bodies I condense in the trial field will only be at the third-level Ruler level,” Ninth Kalpa King said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

No one was surprised.

It was a must that Ninth Kalpa King had a lower realm in the trial ground.

After all, if he went to the trial ground with his peak strength, the fight would be meaningless.

No matter how powerful Jian Wushuang was, he could not defeat Ninth Kalpa King, who had reached the peak of the Ultimate Dominator and had a divine power that was 7,000 times stronger than that of an ordinary cultivator.

In terms of divine power alone, they were not on the same level. Ninth Kalpa King’s divine power was barely comparable to that of a Supreme-being.

“Should we enter the trial field directly?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ninth Kalpa King. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“There’s no rush. Let’s discuss it before we enter the trial field.” Ninth Kalpa King suddenly smiled.

“Discuss what?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“We’re both perfect life-forms, and this exchange has attracted so many experts from the palace to watch. If this battle ends so easily, it’ll be too boring. Why don’t we add some more bets?” Ninth Kalpa King said with a smile.

“Rewards?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and laughed in his heart.

Ninth Kalpa King was really courting death.

He wanted to suppress him in this battle to raise his status, but now he wanted more rewards? Did he want to earn more from him?

“What rewards do you want?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I heard that when you first came to the palace, you met Supreme Giant Axe and he gave you a middle-grade principle divine fruit,” Ninth Kalpa King said with a faint smile.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

The onlookers were also shocked to hear this.

In the Void, among the three towering figures, Supreme Giant Axe king looked a little gloomy.
