“Good boy, are you okay?”The middle-aged man looked at Jian Wushuang with goodwill.

Jian Wushuang opened his mouth but found himself without words. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Well, you’re badly hurt. Don’t say anything. Be careful not to die.”

After saying that, the middle-aged man squatted down and then took a dagger from his waist, gashing Jian Wushuang’s arm.

Jian Wushuan’s expression changed slightly as he had no idea what was going on. But then, his apparent savior stretched out his right arm.

“Huzi.” The middle-aged man whispered.

In a twinkling, a wound appeared on his arm and a hideous worm with countless tentacles climbed out of it.

The scarlet worm and climbed into the wound on Jian Wushuang’s arm.

Watching this, Jian Wushuang felt a chill on his back, but he had no strength to resist what so ever.

However, when the creature entered into his body, Jian Wushuang immediately felt limp and numb. At the same time, he also realized that the worm contained an amazing amount of vital force that gave his whole body a bunch of fresh power.

In just a moment, Jian Wushuang’s injury got significantly better.

Afterward, the scarlet worm climbed out of his wound and returned to the middle-aged man’s hand once again.

“You’re seriously wounded. Huzi only can prevent you from getting worse. If you want to fully recover, you’d better take it easy and go slowly after your return to the clan.” The middle-aged man said.

“Thanks.” Jian Wushuang said with great efforts, but still unable to move.

“My name is Gu Yang, from the Eighth Tribe.” The middle-aged man said.

“I am Jian Wushuang.” Jian Wushuang responded.

The demon god’s expression changed, but Gu Yang only said with no more questions although he felt Jian Wushuang’s name was strange, “It’s not far from my tribe. Let me take you back there. You can go back to your tribe once you get better. Ok?”

“Back to my tribe?” Jian Wushuang’s complexion whitened.

He came from the outside world. The Eternal Zone was only open for ten days. After that, it would close again. Before he entered into the Eternal Zone, Ling Yu, the Vice Palace Master, had said that they must hasten to the edge of the outer layer once the ten-day deadline was up if they wanted to leave.

But now, there were only two days left.

Jian Wushuang could not guarantee he could reach the edge of the outer layer before the deadline if he followed Gu Yang to the tribe where the Demon God Clan lived in.

“But, I can’t move at all on my current state. It’s impossible to get to the edge of the outer layer.”Jian Wushuang felt pained.

“Let’s go! I can carry you on my back.”Gu Yang said, hoisting Jian Wushuang on his back and walking towards the Eighth Tribe.

Meanwhile, in the Eternal Zone, many outsiders from the Firmament Territory were still fighting madly in order to get more Demon God’s Essence Blood.

But time was limited. Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

Outside the Eternal Zone, above the vast ancient forest floated two huge wormholes. The top three magnates from the Firmament Territory and experts from top nine sects strode out from one of them and gathered in crowds.

Most of the experts from the Eternal Realm who adventured in the inner layer were out of spirit energy after ten days of combat. The number of experts was obviously reduced, many of them had lost their lives in the inner layer.

The Ancient Sect had dispatched eight experts in the Eternal Realm. After the combat, the eight experts survived, but two palace masters were seriously wounded.

“Destruction, I was told that you got a Demon God Baptismal Pool. How is it?” Mo Tao looked at the Palace Master Destruction.

“I failed.” The Palace Master shook his head ashamed.

“What a pity!”

Mo Tao secretly praised, “Those Demon Gods attach great importance to the Demon God Baptismal Pool. Although there are many of them in the inner layer, each pool was guarded by a Demon God. It’s extremely tough to get one of those pools under their guard. Even if we are lucky enough to get it, whether we can turn into a Demon God with it only depends on luck.”

“You did get the Demon God Baptismal Pool. But you were not lucky enough to become a Demon God. What a pity! We just got some drops of Demon God’s Essence Blood, far away from getting a Demon God Baptismal Pool.”

Ling Yu and other people could not help sighing.

“Among the experts of the Eternal Realm who adventured in the inner layer, only Zong Ming from the Immortal Dynasty and Violet Fairy from the Nine Heaven Sect are favored to get a Demon God Baptismal Pool and successfully turn into a Demon God.”Mo Tao said.

Immediately, several experts of the Ancient Sect all cast their eyes on the pair.

As for those experts from other sects, they all looked at the two lucky dogs with envy.

The Demon God Baptismal Pool was the place where the Demon God Clansmen received baptism. They had to get into the Baptismal Pool to turn into a Demon God when they grew up enough. But these human warriors also had the same chance to turn into a Demon God given that they had a part of Demon God bloodline by absorbing Demon God’s Essence Blood.

Every time when the Eternal Zone opened, the experts from different sects in the Firmament Territory came into the inner layer to adventure. All of them were after a Demon God Baptismal Pool to get at least a chance to turn into a Demon God, just like the Demon God clansmen.

Even if the chance was slim, their strength would get a huge boost even if they happened to turn in just the weakest Copper-armored Demon God.

Violet Fairy and Zong Ming were successful in turning into Copper-armored Demon Gods, which made experts from different sects admire them.

“They are so lucky.”Mo Tao highly praised.

“You’re right.”The Palace Master Destruction nodded.

“Zong Ming and Violet Fairy… Violet Fairy is weaker, just an ordinary expert of the Eternal Realm. I can beat her down in terms of strength. But now it will skyrocket several times as long as she turns into a Copper-armored Demon God.” Ling Yu, the Vice Palace Master shook his head and smiled.
