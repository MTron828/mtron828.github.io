Chapter 584: Killing Temple Master Iceberg

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“All right, I’ll go with you,” Jian Wushuang said. “But I have to settle something first.”

Jian Wushuang glanced at the experts in the human camp and finally focused on one person.

Temple Master Iceberg.

“This old guy had tried to kill me several times. I wasn’t strong enough before, but now things are different...”

Jian Wushuang said coldly, a faint killing intent rising from him. He suddenly moved and rushed towards Temple Master Iceberg.

Temple Master Iceberg had an uneasy feeling.

He had thought that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would kill Jian Wushuang, so he never thought that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would be defeated by Jian Wushuang.

“I’m in big trouble!”

“I’ve offended Jian Wushuang too much. In the past, he was too weak to do anything about it. But now his, strength has soared so high that he can even defeat Crystal-armored Monster Emperor. There’s no way he’ll spare my life,”?Temple Master Iceberg thought in a panic. He suddenly sensed that someone was looking at him with killing intent.

Jian Wushuang was rushing toward him.

“No!” The expression of Temple Master Iceberg greatly changed.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you want?” Temple Master Iceberg exclaimed.

“What do I want? Don’t you know?” Jian Wushuang replied coldly as his mighty killing intent instantly surrounded Temple Master Iceberg.

“Temple Master Black Spirit, help!”

“Help me!”

Temple Master Iceberg screamed while fleeing towards Temple Master Black Spirit at the same time.

He knew without a doubt that it was impossible for him to compete with Jian Wushuang. The only one among the humans who could do that was Temple Master Black Spirit.

Without hesitation, he tried to grasp at that straw.

Temple Master Black Spirit’s face darkened slightly. She said, “Jian Wushuang.”

Jian Wushuang halted to look at her, as he was quite respectful toward the latter.

“Temple Master Black Spirit,” Jian Wushuang said solemnly. “When I was a Saint Realm expert, I was forced by Temple Master Iceberg to have a Life-death Duel with Emperor Golden Snake. Then, on the Blood Moon Plain, Temple Master Iceberg even tried to kill me. I would have died if you hadn’t arrived at that time!”

“He has attempted to kill me several times. Can’t I get revenge? I hope you will allow me to have my revenge!”

Jian Wushuang explained sincerely.

Hearing his words, Temple Master Iceberg roared impatiently before Temple Master Black Spirit could reply, “Jian Wushuang, who do you think you are? After all, you’re just an outsider while I’m one of the pillars of the human population on the Monster Continent!”

“I have made great contributions to the human population, but what about you? What have you done for the Monster-exterminating League?”

“Shut up!”

Temple Master Black Spirit lower her voice and stared at Temple Master Iceberg with a hint of coldness in her eyes. She said, “Temple Master Iceberg, you have indeed made a great contribution to the League. But Jian Wushuang is also a Divine Emperor. Not to mention that his strength qualifies him to be a Temple Master.”

“Since you both belong to the League, I won’t be partial to anyone!”

“It’s a fact that you have a personal grudge against Jian Wushuang and have attempted to kill him several times. His strength has improved and he wants to seek revenge, which is also reasonable!”

“It’s unfair to allow you to kill him and forbid him to kill you.”

“Since your personal grudge can’t be resolved, you can solve it through a Life-death Duel according to the rules of the League.”

“Why?” Hearing the words of Temple Master Black Spirit, Temple Master Iceberg’s face darkened immediately.

“A Life-death Duel?”

“I must fight a Life-death Duel with Jian Wushuang?”

“Is she kidding?”

The experts of the human camp looked at Temple Master Iceberg with a pity in their eyes.

But no one dared to question Temple Master Black Spirit’s decision. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

She had indeed decided everything according to the rules of the League. The life-and-death grudge between Jian Wushuang and Temple Master Iceberg had to be solved through a Life-death Duel and she was partial to no one.

“Thank you!”

Jian Wushuang looked at Temple Master Black Spirit gratefully and then turned to Temple Master Iceberg.

“Temple Master Iceberg, you’ll definitely die today!”

Jian Wushuang roared as he rushed directly towards Temple Master Iceberg.

The human experts watched them indifferently, no one was willing to attempt to stop Jian Wushuang.

“Run!”

Temple Master Iceberg did not want to have a Life-death Duel with Jian Wushuang at all.

As he had witnessed the battle between Jian Wushuang and Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, he knew that he could not compete with either of them at all.

There was not even a small chance that he would survive.

“Do you think you can escape?” Jian Wushuang said coldly. As the mighty killing intent burst out of him and a vast blood river gushed forward like a surging tsunami.

Now that Jian Wushuang had reached the Nine-cloud Realm, the power of his Realm was much stronger than before.

Its momentum alone was infinitely stronger than before.

The huge Realm covered the entire battlefield in an instant. Temple Master Iceberg, who was trapped in the Blood River Realm, felt like he had sunk into a mire. He struggled violently but was still greatly restrained and his speed was greatly diminished.

“This guy.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, who had retreated to the horde of Demonic Beasts, frowned as he saw the crazy surging Blood River in front of him.

He could feel the power of the Blood River. He was afraid that he would also be greatly suppressed if he was surrounded by it.

But Jian Wushuang had not used his Blood River Realm when he fought with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

“Sword Emperor still kept some of his strength in reserve when he fought with me,”Crystal-armored Monster Emperor thought.

The Blood River Realm violently suppressed Temple Master Iceberg and greatly lowered his speed. On the contrary, Jian Wushuang was able to move more flexibly in it and approached Temple Master Iceberg in the blink of an eye.

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang attacked him directly.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Three bright and beautiful sword moves, each of which was extremely powerful and shocking to all the ordinary Temple Masters.

Temple Master Iceberg struggled to parry the sword moves with his long spear, but... Clang! Clang! The first two successive collisions knocked his long spear away and the third sword light glided mercilessly past him.

Temple Master Iceberg, one of the top three Temple Masters in the Monster-exterminating League, died on the spot!
