Chapter 3714: Scattered

“Ruler of blueness, it’s Ruler of blueness!”

The numerous Principles Masters at the entrance were shocked when they saw the white-robed figure.

Ruler of blueness was quite famous in the three battlefields.

When Ruler of blueness arrived at the entrance, he immediately sensed the presence of the people from Star Palace and the three Freedom Alliances. At the same time, he also noticed Jian Wushuang’s half-smile gaze.

The gaze made his heart tremble, but he immediately lowered his body and bowed slightly in Jian Wushuang’s direction through the void.

“You’re quite tactful.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“It seems that after the last time, you’ve become afraid of the Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Temporal Temple Master said with a smile.

Others thought that he was a solitary Ruler, but only Jian Wushuang and the others knew that he was actually an avatar of the Earth Saint Star Master.

Jian Wushuang had killed his way into the holy star for the sake of the Ice Heart Glazed Jade. He had beaten the holy star master so badly that he had to lower his head and reveal his secret.

The secret was the black Ruler.

Jian Wushuang knew the true identity of the black Ruler, but the Principles Masters at the entrance did not know, let alone the relationship between the black Ruler and Jian Wushuang.

Therefore, when they saw the actions of the Ruler, they were surprised.

“What is the Ruler doing?”

“He is bowing. is he bowing to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master or the Temporal Temple Master?”

“He should be the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master. I heard that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master is an advanced Ruler, so he should be stronger than the Ruler.”

Although these Principles Masters said this, they still had a trace of doubt in their hearts.

Under normal circumstances, even if the leader of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was a high-level Ruler and was stronger than Ruler Uqing, Ruler Uqing did not need to bow directly. At most, he would just show a little respect.

However, Ruler Uqing’s current actions clearly carried a trace of respect.

He was a real Ruler after all. was there a need for him to be so respectful to an advanced Ruler?

What the Principles Masters did not know was that the Ruler was not afraid of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, much less Temporal Temple Master. What he was truly afraid of was Jian Wushuang!

However, because Jian Wushuang was still a Principles Master and had yet to show his real combat strength to the outside world, the people around him did not know this.

Time continued to pass.

In the blink of an eye, another three months had passed.

Buzz!

In the vast Crimson Stone Mountain in front of them, the red jade that filled the heaven and earth suddenly surged up. Then, large patches of red clouds began to shrink toward the depths of Crimson Stone Mountain.

This scene caused the eyes of the experts at the entrance to light up.

“The Red Cloud Mist Tide is going to disappear.”

“It’s finally going to disappear.”

“Once the Red Cloud Mist Tide is gone, we can enter the Red Cloud World. I can’t wait any longer.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Many experts began to look forward to it.

Jian Wushuang, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, the Temporal Temple Master, and the others also stared at the changes in Crimson Stone Mountain.

When they saw the red cloud begin to shrink, and in the blink of an eye, it had already shrunk out of their sight, they immediately started to move.

“Let’s go!”

Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master took the lead.

Jian Wushuang, Temporal Temple Master, Star Palace, and the Principles Masters of the three Freedom Alliances followed behind. They rushed into Crimson Stone Mountain.

Not only them, but the more than 1,500 Principles Masters gathered at the entrance also rushed into Crimson Stone Mountain like wasps.

Crimson Stone Mountain became completely lively.

…

“The entrance to the Red Cloud World is under the blood-red land of Crimson Stone Mountain. Usually, the land of Crimson Stone Mountain is covered with red clouds. No one can sneak into the underground through the red clouds. Only when the Red Cloud Mist Tide appears and the red clouds shrink to the deepest part of Crimson Stone Mountain will the entrance to the Red Cloud World See the light of day again.”

“Oh, the entrance is down there.”

Jian Wushuang and the others had already arrived at Crimson Stone Mountain. Not long after they entered, they saw an endless abyss with a layer of faint red mist at the bottom of the abyss. According to what Temporal Temple Master had said, that layer of red mist was the entrance to the Red Cloud World.

“How big is the entrance?” Jian Wushuang asked subconsciously.

“It’s very big, covering almost the entire Crimson Stone Mountain. So now, no matter which direction the cultivators enter from, they can see the Abyss after entering Crimson Stone Mountain. Naturally, they can also see the entrance below the Abyss.” Temporal Temple Master said, “Everyone, let’s not waste any time. Let’s enter the Red Cloud World now.”

“Alright.”

Everyone nodded in unison. Immediately, their figures rushed down the abyss.

In just a short moment, they had arrived above the layer of red fog.

“Enter.”

The Temporal Temple Master let out a low cry. Everyone passed through the red fog and entered the Red Cloud World.

...

The sky of the Red Cloud World was filled with red clouds, dyeing the entire sky red.

There were no living plants on the same red land. There was a boundless red land everywhere. Occasionally, one could see bald red mountains or boulders.

Whoosh!

With a flash of light, Jian Wushuang appeared in the void of the Red Cloud World.

As soon as he appeared, Jian Wushuang immediately released his soul power to cover the surrounding sky.

“The void of the Red Cloud World seems to be much more stable than the three battlefields. Even if I release my soul power at full strength, I can only cover an area of 100,000 kilometers.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly.

The area of 100,000 kilometers seemed to be very large, but in fact, if Jian Wushuang was in the Divine Beginning Realm, it would be easy for him to cover millions of kilometers with his soul power with just a thought.

Of course, in the universe void, he would be more restricted, but it was not too outrageous.

In the three Universe Battlefields, his soul power could only cover an area of 1,000,000 miles.

In the Red Cloud World, it could only cover an area of 100,000 miles, which was already a big limit.

“There are eight Principles Masters in the area of 100,000 miles, but none of them belong to Star Palace or the three Freedom Alliances.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes darkened slightly.

Before entering the Red Cloud World, he had heard from Temporal Temple Master that even though they entered the Red Cloud World together, as long as they passed through the entrance of the Red Cloud World, they would spread out and spread out to different corners of the Red Cloud World.

That was why he did not have any experts from his side.

“Fortunately, although they have spread out, there is no restriction on communication in the Red Cloud World.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out a communication token.

“Heaven-cleaving, Temporal.”

Jian Wushuang immediately sent a message to Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master.
