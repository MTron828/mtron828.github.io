Chapter 2157 Ambushed

Jian Wushuang had a sword on his back as he explored the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground.The air was filled with blood-red mist that radiated sanguine.

However, vegetation was still thick under these conditions.

The entire area was a dense jungle.

“I have no knowledge about the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground. This may be troublesome.” Jian Wushuang frowned as he thought to himself.

If it had been other dangerous areas like the four Grounds of Despair, he at least would have had a basic understanding of the place as several experts had been in and come out to tell the tale.

However, the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground was different.

Only the most powerful great emperors from the Three Emperors World might have some understanding of the dangers of this place.

However, all of those great emperors had disappeared and gone inside. He could not get information prior to his scouting mission.

“Sigh. Let’s see how this goes.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He continued heading straight cautiously as his soul power encompassed everything around him.

Not long after Jian Wushuang entered the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground.

A man in crimson red cloak seated in the dark void in the depth of the forbidden ground noticed him.

“Someone ventured in.” Kaiser Blood said coldly.

“Ventured in? The army from the Eternal Chaotic World is here?” Demon King Chen Yu, who was sat beside Kaiser Blood, asked.

“No. There is only one person. Based on his aura, it should be the Sword Emperor.” Kaiser Blood said.

“Sword Emperor? Jian Wushuang? It’s this brat again!” Demon King Chen Yu widened his eyes and exclaimed.

“The army from the Eternal Chaotic World does things really quickly. They came to scout the Ancient Bloody Forbidden Ground so quickly,” Lord Fen said coldly.

“It is normal. The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World swept the territories very quickly in an attempt to find where we are hiding. They have swept even the most remote land. What is left are those dangerous areas. Furthermore, our experts will definitely leave behind small traces of evidence that we are here. It is just a matter of time before they get here.” Kaiser Blood smiled lightly.

“However, they are unsure whether we are really here and if this is our hiding spot. Otherwise they would not have just sent the Sword Emperor here alone. The entire army will be here.”

“The Sword Emperor only came here to do some scouting.” Lord Fen said.

“That should be the case. Since he is here to scout, let him roam inside the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground then. There are natural dangers and the Ancient Blood Tribe within this forbidden ground. If he is lucky, he might even meet that existence, and that will make things interesting.” Kaiser Blood smiled.

Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu smiled creepily.

They indeed were hiding within the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground even though there were many dangers there.

The reason why they could stay there and stay safe was due to special reasons.

But it was a different case for Jian Wushuang.

……

Within the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground, Jian Wushuang was still travelling slowly and cautiously.

In the blink of an eye, half a day passed.

During this half a day, he did not encounter any dangers.

Right then, he appeared on top of a dense forest.

Whoosh!

A crimson-red beam of light burst forth from below and attacked Jian Wushuang.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows as he fixed his sight onto this beam of light.

The speed of the beam of red light was very fast, much faster than most of the Sir Gods and Emperor Gods.

The speed was very similar to that of a great emperor.

Most importantly, this beam of red light was always in the depth of the forest. It did not have any aura and Jian Wushuang had not spotted it using his Soul Power.

When the blood-red beam of light appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, a blood-red claw appeared and targeted his throat.

The power of the claw could threaten even emperor gods .

At such a close distance, the claw could severely injure the victim given how fast and sudden it came.

Under this circumstance, an ordinary emperor god would probably be assassinated.

However, the target of the claw was Jian Wushuang.

“Scram!”

Jian Wushuang roared. He did not draw his sword. He simply waved his hand and a sword light appeared.

Even though Jian Wushuang had waved his hand casually, the power of this attack was equivalent to that of a stage one great emperor.

Almostly instantly, the claw and the sword light collided with each other.

A loud clang was heard, followed by a cry of pain as the blood-red figure backed off. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It did not die?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

That attack of his had been at the power level of great emperors, and it still had not killed the creature.

The blood-red creature steadied itself as Jian Wushuang could finally see the creature’s true identity.

This exotic beast was about 1.5m tall and looked like a fox. It was covered in blood-red fur.

The eyes of this exotic beast were bloodshot. It stared at Jian Wushuang before it turned and fled back into the jungle below.

“Now you want to escape?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the exotic beast coldly as a beam of golden light burst forth,

This was the legitimate Hong Jun Golden Sword.

It was travelling at a terrifying speed!

When Jian Wushuang controlled the replica version of the Hong Jun Golden Sword, it travelled at a speed that made even the stage one and two great emperors fearful.

Now that he was controlling the legitimate sword, the speed was three times faster compared to the replica version!!

What a crazy speed it had!

Even though the exotic beast was escaping at great speed, it was still significantly slower compared to the Hong Jun Golden Sword.

Within seconds, the Hong Jun Golden Sword caught up to the blood-red exotic beast and collided into its body with terrifying power.

Even though the beast had a strong self-defense mechanism, it could not take the attack from the golden sword as it pierced its head.
