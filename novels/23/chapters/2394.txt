Chapter 2395: Nomination

While Jian Wushuang was still secretly recovering his strength, something had happened in a towering palace at Narcissus Island.

Almost all Narcissus Island’s Circle of Elders were gathered in the palace, except for a few elders who had retired and rarely showed interest in what was going on.

In the center of the palace seated a plainly dressed middle-aged man. He had stubbles on his face and was dressed in an ordinary shade of green. He was an elegant looking man and seemed to be an affable person.

The many elders who had gathered around, including the three Peak Stage Divine Demon elders, looked at the middle-aged man with awe and respect.

The middle-aged man was the Lord of Narcissus Island and his name was Ling Gong.

He was also the only Ultimate God known to Narcissus Island.

Then again, that was the public’s common knowledge. It was unknown as to whether there secretly were other Ultimate Gods in Narcissus Island.

“Dear elders, you must have guessed the purpose of this meeting?” Ling Gong’s voice echoed gently.

“Lord, it’s regarding the Saint’s Tomb that’s about to open?” asked the Seventh Elder.

Ling Gong nodded. “Indeed, it’s regarding the Saint’s Tomb. After a thousand years, it’s time for Saint’s Tomb to open again. This is not only a major event for Narcissus Island, but also for all the sects of the Wusha Wilderness. We are gathered here to meet and discuss which candidates to enter the Saint’s Tomb!”

“Like all previous events, Narcissus Island gets to send ten candidates into the Saint’s Tomb. In addition, there are three safety tokens available. Now, the crux is which ten disciples shall we send into the tomb and which three disciples will be given the safety tokens. Fellow elders, you may voice out.”

The elders around started discussions immediately.

“Lord, there are known to be many opportunities in the Saint’s Tomb, hence countless Narcissus Island’s disciples are eager to enter it. However, don’t forget there are also great dangers in the tomb. Many disciples from many sects had been sacrificed in every single trip into the tomb. Three thousand years ago, Narcissus Island had also suffered a great loss of disciples. Therefore, we have to be cautious in selecting the best candidates. Those ten disciples must not only have a certain level of talent and strength to gain benefits from the many opportunities in the tomb, but also possess the abilities to keep themselves alive,” said an elder.

Ling Gong and other elders agreed in unison.

The Saint’s Tomb was a place with many possibilities, yet it posed a great risk for the conquerors. Not any Tom, Dick and Harry could get in there.

The candidates would be carefully selected and their strengths from many aspects would be considered in the process.

“Currently, Zhong Yi and Su Tong are the best among my core disciples in Narcissus Island. They are already First-Class Divine Demons and also very talented. They must go into the tomb and should also each be given a safety token,” said Seventh Elder.

“Zhong Yi and Su Tong?” The elders nodded.

The two disciples with the strongest power and talent would have to enter the Saint’s Tomb and there was no need to worry about their lives being endangered as they would be given the safety token.

“My personal disciple is rather good. I want him to have experience and learn a thing or two in the Saint’s Tomb. Is it feasible?” A white-haired old woman suddenly spoke.

Everyone turned around immediately to look at the old woman.

The old woman was the Second Elder of the Circle of Elders. She was a Peak Stage Divine Demon and had high seniority. Her words carried a certain degree of weight and authority.

Moreover, she was nominating her personal disciple which was indeed not a bad choice. Her personal disciple was equipped with the conditions to enter the Saint’s Tomb. Everyone agreed to it almost immediately after a short discussion.

“Among the core disciples, Xiao Heng seems to be performing well and has made rapid progress. He has just made a breakthrough some time ago and reached the Second-Class Divine Demons. He should be given a chance at the Saint’s Tomb,” said another elder.

The other elders went into discussion again.

Xiao Heng was indeed remarkable among the many core disciples of Narcissus Island.

Besides, he had broken through and reached the Second-Class Divine Demons. Hence, the elders agreed after a brief discussion.

Thereafter, some elders began to mention names. Those that were proposed and accepted by the elders as a candidate were core disciples. Without an exception, they were Second-Class Divine Demons with outstanding combat power.

Soon, seven places were filled while many Elders were still in a heated discussion on who should take up the final three places.

“Let me nominate someone.”

Elder Wujian who was seated aside finally spoke.

Elder Wujian was one of the elders among the Circle of Elders. Although he had not taken up the elder’s position for long, he had a right to speak.

The other elders anticipated quietly for who he was about to nominate.

“I want to nominate Jian Wushuang. I think he is qualified to enter the Saint’s Tomb,” said Elder Wujian.

However, many Elders around were doubtful after hearing him out.

They were doubtful of the name, Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang... Who is that?”

“The name sounds unfamiliar. I don’t seem to have heard of it.”

“Is there someone by the name of Jian Wushuang among the core disciples of Narcissus Island?”

The elders were actively discussing.

The elders of the Circle of Elders held very high status in Narcissus Island. They did not need to be bothered by many issues on Narcissus Island nor did they pay attention to the many disciples on Narcissus Island. Occasionally, when those exceptional core disciples caught their attention, they would offer to recruit those suitable ones under their wings as their personal disciples.

In other words, only the core disciples would pique their interest.

They had never heard of Jian Wushuang.

Apart from Elder Wujian, someone else also happened to know Jian Wushuang. The person was the Seventh Elder.

When Jian Wushuang had just arrived on Narcissus Island, the Seventh Elder discovered that Elder Wujian had handed his Elder’s Token to Jian Wushuang, an outer disciple. He was very angry so he went to Elder Wujian and rebuked him. It was a pity that Elder Wujian turned a deaf ear to his advice.

There was nothing he could do.

Things were no longer the same...

“Elder Wujian, will you stop fooling around?” The Seventh Elder’s expression was cold as he expressed his sharp disapproval.

The other elders were flabbergasted, including Lord Ling Gong. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Seventh Elder, you said that Elder Wujian was fooling around. What was going on?” asked Ling Gong while looking down from his seat.

“Lord and fellow elders, I’m afraid that you have never heard of Jian Wushuang. However, this is perfectly normal because Jian Wushuang is not one of the core disciples of the Inner Court. He’s merely an outer disciple from the Outer Court!” said the Seventh Elder.

“What?”

“An outer disciple?”

The faces of the many elders turned ugly. Even Ling Gong frowned after hearing that.
