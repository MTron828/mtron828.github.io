Chapter 2670: Ravaged

The Ancient Witch originally planned to advise Leng Xing so that he would not simply carry out a gamble-fight with Jian Wushuang. She felt that Jian Wushuang’s strength was slightly unpredictable on top of being too confident.

He had something to rely on as he dared proactively raised a gamble-fight with such huge bets even though he knew they were heavenly prides of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion.

However, Leng Xing waved his hand before she could finish speaking and said. “Junior Sister Ancient, you seem to be looking down at me. Please don’t forget that I’m one of the top five Peak Earth Ultimate Gods in the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. Do you think this Jian Wushuang can be one of the top five Peak Earth Ultimate Gods geniuses in the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion?”

The Ancient Witch was stunned and slightly frowned but did not continue to speak.

“I agree to two hundred Divine Elixir Pills. Jian Yi, the both of us are Peak Earth Ultimate Gods so there’s no need to reserve your divine power. Just show us all your skills,” shouted Leng Xing as his body suddenly trembled.

Hum!!

A total of 700 apparitions appeared at the same time.

Leng Xing had quite a strong understanding of Space-time Law even among the Heaven Ultimate God as he could cultivate as many as 700 apparitions at the same time. It was no wonder he was so confident.

Apart from his Space-time Law understanding, his Principle World had also opened up to the size of 30,000 kilometers with powers much stronger than the Ancient Witch’s.

His weapon was the battle saber which he handled in an extremely fast manner.

The combat power he showed at that exact moment was extremely surprising.

The surrounding Sacred Palace disciples looked at him in horror as Leng Xing was only a Peak Earth Ultimate God, but his combat prowess was comparable to those Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God in the eyes of those Sacred Palace disciples.

Would Jian Yi be an opponent to Leng Xing who had such horrifying power?

Everybody was wondering at the bottom of their hearts but what happened next exceeded their expectations.

Jian Wushuang slightly took action after Leng Xing activated his combat power.

He also activated his 800 apparitions—100 more than Leng Xing—to appear at that moment.

He also released his Profound Achievement Sword World but he did not display his full strength. The Sword World power he displayed was less than 50% but this 50% was enough to suppress Leng Xing’s speed in his Principle World.

Apart from that, his Blood Mountain Sword had appeared in his hand as he displayed his Sword Principle. He used the tactic of stopping speed with greater speed as he handled his sword faster than Leng Xing’s saber handling ways.

In terms of divine power, Jian Wushuang’s explosive divine power was stronger than Leng Xing’s.

Law understanding, Principle World, sword skill, saber skill, and divine power... Leng Xing was completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang in every aspect.

Everything ended with Leng Xing being completely ravaged by Jian Wushuang without being able to fight back much.

It was a one-sided complete ravage!

Although Leng Xing tried all sorts of ways as though he had gone crazy, everything was useless when faced with overwhelming strength.

The Sacred Palace disciples were slightly stunned when they saw that.

They had never imagined a Sacred Palace disciple would be able to ravage a similarly leveled Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s heavenly pride to that extent?

It was truly miserable!

The facial expressions of those three Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples who were standing at the battlefield’s edge slightly darkened.

They initially did not pay much attention to the Sacred Palace disciples but one of them was completely ravaged by the other party in a blink of an eye.

“I have already said that Jian Yi is extremely strong,” said the Ancient Witch coldly.

A while later, the completely one-sided battle and ravaged situation, had finally ended. The person who won was naturally Jian Wushuang. As for Leng Xing, he was initially very irritable and extremely angry but soon became extremely obedient after a round of being ravaged such that he even started to be frightened of Jian Wushuang.

This was the first time he was ravaged by a similarly leveled Peak Earth Ultimate God. Even the other four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods at the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion were not much stronger than him despite being positioned higher than him. It was impossible for them to so easily ravage him.

However, Jian Wushuang managed to do so.

It meant that Jian Wushuang would have been the first-ranked among those Peak Earth Ultimate Gods in their pavilion if he went to the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion!

“You’re Leng Xing, right? Two hundred Divine Elixir Pills.” Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze on Leng Xing with a smile on his face but with his right hand already stretched out.

The corners of Leng Xing’s mouth slightly twitched. Although he was extremely unwilling, he still took a batch of pills and several special treasures of the equal value out from his Interspatial Ring.

“There’s only so little Divine Elixir Pills?” Jian Wushuang pursed his mouth. He was not interested in those special treasures as he would only sell them at the Star Picking Pavilion the moment he got them. He wanted ready-made Divine Elixir Pills as the treasures’ value would be hugely discounted if he exchanged them for those pills later on. Unfortunately, Leng Xing did not have so many pills on him so Jian Wushuang could forcibly ask for it.

Jian Wushuang focused his gaze at the remaining two heavenly prides of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion after defeating Leng Xing.

The handsome teenager who was also at the Peak-level Earth Heavenly God could not help but secretly tremble when he felt Jian Wushuang’s gaze.

This handsome teenager dared not take action if even Leng Xing was ravaged by Jian Wushuang as he was not as strong as Leng Xing.

Jian Wushuang also did not pay much attention to him and turned his gaze at the final person. This crossed-armed person with an extremely cool facial expression on his face was the burly man called Wu Xin!

“Brother, I wonder if you’d like to have a gamble-fight with me?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile on his face.

Everyone present was startled with the look in their eyes that slowly changed into astonishment as he spoke.

If the reason Jian Wushuang dared continuously fight both the Ancient Witch and Leng Xing was because of his extremely powerful abilities, everyone felt he had gone completely crazy at that moment! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He was certainly crazy!

“H-he dared to challenge Senior Brother Wu Xin?” The Ancient Witch was also startled.

“He’s not satisfied after continuously defeating me and Junior Sister Ancient? Does he want to have a gamble-battle with Senior Brother Wu Xin? Does he really think he’s invincible?” Leng Xing also shouted slightly softly.

The handsome teen also mumbled, “Is... Is he really crazy?”

Wu Xin was completely different from them.

The reason was not only from being more talented but the crux laid within his current realm...

Boom~~~

A strong aura exploded from the burly man—Wu Xin’s body. This aura wave was extremely strong and suppressed everybody there.

Apart from Jian Wushuang and a small number of Sacred Palace experts, everybody else slightly trembled under the aura’s suppression.

Heaven Ultimate God! Wu Xin was a true Heaven Ultimate God!

He was also an extreme genius!!
