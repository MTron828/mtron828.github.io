2042 The Second Stage of Chaotic Supreme!

Jian Wushuang constantly elevated his divine power as he stayed in the golden prohibition.

The golden prohibition was unique to begin with. There was no one who noticed Jian Wushuang in the golden prohibition.

There were three Great Emperors who continued to stand guard outside the huge golden whirlpool all year round. Occasionally, the three Great Emperors would release their soul power to scan through the golden whirlpool. However, their souls couldn’t detect the scenery within the golden prohibition. Naturally, they didn’t find out about Jian Wushuang.

It was even more impossible to see him with naked eyes.

Hence, the entire golden whirlpool became peaceful.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the golden prohibition to refine and absorb divine power aggressively in order to level up his power, but no one knew.

As for the dark millstone, it wasn’t affected at all. It continued to move in Eternal Chaotic World and it continued to crush everything.

Its size was growing bigger and bigger over time.

The experts in Eternal Chaotic World were preparing at the fastest speed possible.

In such a situation, time flew past.

In the blink of an eye, thirty years passed.

In the golden prohibition above the Emperor Supreme Rock, Jian Wushuang, who had been keeping his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes.

In the instant when he opened his eyes, his aura underwent a drastic change.

Previously, he had merely been on the Sir God level. Now, he had reached Emperor God realm!

“I have reached the second stage of Chaotic Supreme!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and he was filled with excitement.

One should know that it had not been long since he had stepped foot onto the seventh step of inverse cultivation.

According to ordinary cultivation, he would need at least need tens of thousands of years or even longer before he could get to the second stage.

However, he only spent thirty years in the golden prohibition before he broke through.

This… was the opportunity!!!

It could also be described as Jian Wushuang’s luck.

When Jian Wushuang had reached the second stage of the Chaotic Supreme, his overall power had naturally increased tremendously.

First of all, his divine body had been enhanced.

Then, it was followed by his divine power.

From the first stage to the second stage, it was a transformation in quality in terms of his divine power. Judging from the strength of his divine power, it was stronger by a few times. Most importantly, the intensity of his divine power had grown!

The divine power in the second stage was much more abundant than in the first stage. Such abundant divine power represented that his defense ability had increased again.

If he was the first stage, he could reorganize his divine body four times.

Then, as his divine body enhanced again, it would be much more difficult to reorganize his power. But his divine power could support him in reorganizing his divine body by seven or even eight times.

It was even more ridiculous, it was even more terrifying.

“However, my ancient tribe bloodline didn’t improve along with this breakthrough,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

In between his eyebrows, there were only eight ancient tribe stars. Jian Wushuang could do nothing about it.

Regardless, his power continued to increase tremendously.

“Before this, I was only in the first stage. Relying on the pure divine power that I enhanced via the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body I cultivated, in addition to my ancient tribe bloodline power, my power had already far beyond any ordinary Great Emperor. When I fight head-on, even when I was up against the beast-like bald man from Three-Emperor World, Ling Zong, he was only just my match. Now that my divine power has increased again, in terms of power and strength, there shouldn’t be any Great Emperor from Three-Emperors World who can compare to me favorably.”

“Even if I met the bald man, he couldn’t suppress me in terms of strength,” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

From the first stage to the second stage, his fighting power had transformed in terms of quality.

He was absolutely the top among all Great Emperors. Besides Emperor Bai, there was no one in Sanctuary Alliance who could be his match.

Not only was he strong, but his defensive ability was terrifyingly strong. He was almost invincible. If he had to state a flaw of his, it would only be that his comprehension of doctrine was slightly lower.

Jian Wushuang was content to have reached such a level in a short time.

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief and took out a token. The token was naturally Emperor Jiu Qiao’s.

“Emperor Jiu Qiao,” Jian Wushuang finally sent a massage to Emperor Jiu Qiao.

On a remote mountain in Imperial City faraway, there was a cave dwelling that had recently been opened.

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao had been hiding in the cave dwelling for the past thirty years.

When Jian Wushuang sent a message, Emperor Jiu Qiao immediately received it.

“Sword Emperor. It’s a message from Sword Emperor.

Emperor Jiu Qiao, who was reclining leisurely, instantly stood up. His eyes were beaming with joy.

“What?” Abysmal Saint Master was instantly shaken too. He looked at Emperor Jiu Qiao and asked, “Jiu Qiao, what did you say just now?”

“It’s Sword Emperor!” Emperor Jiu Qiao was excited, “He sent a message.”

“How is this possible?” Abysmal Saint Master looked at him in disbelief.

Didn’t Jian Wushuang die thirty years ago?

In such a situation, he should have been dead. There was absolutely no chance of survival.

Why has he suddenly sent a message after thirty years?

“Hurry up and ask him,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Emperor Jiu Qiao immediately took out a token and asked closely, “Sword Emperor, is it really you? You didn’t die?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Of course, I am living well,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“How could it be? How did you escape from such a situation?” Emperor Jiu Qiao asked in disbelief.

“I didn’t escape. I am still in Imperial Peak and I am in the golden whirlpool. I used a unique way to fool the Great Emperors from Three-Emperor Worlds into thinking that I am dead. As a detailed reason, I could only explain that it is related to a unique ability I have as an inverse cultivator,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“I see,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded. He knew that inverse cultivators were scary and they had an extra unique ability in every step.

However, he didn’t know what ability the seventh step in inverse cultivation had.

Regardless, the unique ability that the seventh step in inverse cultivation had seemed to have rescued Jian Wushuang.

“That’s awesome. It’s great that you survived,” Emperor Jiu Qiao and Abysmal Saint Master were filled with excitement. Then, Emperor Jiu Qiao asked, “How about Zhi Luo? How is she?”

“Great Emperor Zhi Luo passed away. I saw her die with my own eyes. She performed the secret skill of Star Palace and Soul Ignition to fight for more time for me,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

Although Great Emperor Zhi Luo wasn’t a close friend per se, the four of them were comrades-in-arms that had been through life-and-death situations.

The final decision that Great Emperor Zhi Luo had made at the last moment of her life had earned Jian Wushuang’s respect.

There was no doubt that Great Emperor Zhi Luo was a hero that had died for Eternal Chaotic World.
