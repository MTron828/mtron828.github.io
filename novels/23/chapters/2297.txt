Chapter 2298 Perfect Chaotic Lifeform

Using his Soul Power, he checked every part of his new body – organs, bones, veins, cells.“Perfect, it’s perfect,” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He couldn’t complain about anything regarding his body.

Regardless of if it were his organs, bones, veins, or cells, they were all fine.

If you could tell someone’s talent from his body, Jian Wushuang would be perfect. No hairline cracks or faults could be found.

That was what it meant to be a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.

At the Absolute Beginning Divine World, determining someone as an expert would be done via his physical qualities, abilities, understanding and so on. Having one or two beyond average human levels was enough to be crowned as a genius.

But Jian Wushuang was perfect from every angle, every factor, to a point where he no longer could improve further.

“No, even though my body is perfect, I’m afraid I’m not a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform yet.”

From his master’s message, a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform was unique and born a Chaotic Divine Demon.

Like his master Xuan Yi.

Although Jian Wushuang had become a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform under his master’s guidance, he was but a baby and was no Chaotic Divine Demon. He was like the others, powerless, and needed to retrain all over again.

Jian Wushuang had to recover his pinnacle abilities one step at a time.

“Only when I restore my powers and reach the eighth step of the Inverse Cultivation, meaning to say I reach the Chaotic Divine Demon level, will I become a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform,” Jian Wushuang thought.

After reincarnation, his priority was now to restore his pinnacle powers.

In terms of that...

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power was released slowly, covering the entire Governor mansion.

“Indeed, Absolute Beginning Divine World is different. The spiritual influence of heaven and earth is so rich, way beyond Eternal Chaotic World levels,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He could sense that the spiritual influence of heaven and earth at Absolute Beginning Divine World was tenfold or even a hundredfold stronger than in his own hometown Green Fire World.

At a place with such rich spiritual influence over heaven and earth, Jian Wushuang’s work would be much easier.

After all, he had reached Chaotic Divine Demon levels before. His understanding of Dao and Rules were still intact. All he needed was time and sufficient spiritual influence of heaven and earth, and he would recover in a short period of time.

“As a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, I should be absorbing the spiritual influence of heaven and earth way faster than before. It’ll take me thirty years tops to restore my pinnacle abilities. Even faster if I have some treasures,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Twenty or thirty years were nothing to him compared to the hundred thousand years he had lived in Eternal Chaotic World.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang felt something, and the Soul Power that covered the entire mansion disappeared.

On his bed, Zhuo Yunfeng was frowning slightly.

“Husband, what is it?” Luo Xinqin on the bed looked over.

“Nothing, I just felt a strong Soul Power. It was like someone was peaking, but now it is gone. The other party withdrew it,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Probably an expert passing by, sweeping randomly. No ill intent, I suppose,” Zhuo Peng said.

“Hmm, probably,” Zhuo Yunfeng nodded and looked back towards the newborn baby.

The little boy in Luo Xinqin’s arms was in shock at that moment.

“What observant skills, he noticed my Soul Power immediately. He’s my new father?” Jian Wushuang had his eyes wide open as he started at Zhuo Yunfeng.

He noticed Luo Xinqin and Zhuo Peng as well.

“My new parents, and a brother?” Jian Wushuang thought.

He had his own parents back at the Eternal Chaotic World.

But after reincarnation, he was another family’s son.

“Looks like my days at Absolute Beginning Divine World won’t be too lonely after all,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

At the same time, he recalled a beautiful figure.

It was Leng Rushuang!

He knew that Leng Rushuang had been sent here as well.

Meaning to say, Leng Rushuang was probably born into the world as well. But he dared not wonder if Leng Rushuang had retained her memories or not.

“Shuang, I have a gut feeling that we’ll meet soon. I’ll recognise you then.” Jian Wushuang was full of anticipation.

Over the day, news of the second son being born into the Governor’s mansion spread across the entire Incineration Moon City.

Incineration Moon City was even more lively.

For the nine years and nine months the Governor’s wife Luo Xinqin had been pregnant, the snow had not stopped for even a moment.

But now that he was born, the snow had entirely dissipated and the skies were clear.

Everyone knew it was no coincidence.

Furthermore, the sword that had descended from above was shocking. Many people sensed it despite it being late at night.

Many servants and guards of the Governor’s mansion saw it as well. It could not be hidden for too long.

Soon, news of the sword, the arrival of Taoist Priest Xuan Shen, and the name Jian Wushuang spread across the entire Incineration Moon City.

Word spread like wildfire. It did not take long for most of Anjiu Commandery to catch news of it as well.

Everyone knew that this newborn son of the Incineration Moon City was determined to live an extraordinary life. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
