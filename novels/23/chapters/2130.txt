Chapter 2131 The Second Scroll, Complete!

The original plan between Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen had only one step, which was for Jian Wushuang to infiltrate into the Imperial City, use the Void Token, and allow all the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World to come in and destroy the city.But after some thought, Emperor Bai felt wiping out only the experts within the city was not enough. After all, most high-level experts would not stay in the city.

From there, step two was formed.

“I have discussed this plan several times with Tian Chen. It should be possible, and if we want to make our move we should do it while the Three Emperors World is not completely prepared. If you need a decade to master the secret skill and reach Third Stage… I’m afraid they will have been well prepared by then. So, three years at most!”

Emperor Bai looked towards Jian Wushuang. “You must complete it within three years. If you need resources, just say. The Sanctuary Alliance has spent six-tenths of our resources opening the Heaven Repairing Palace, but the remaining resources are still plentiful.”

“Understood, rest assured, I will master it within three years,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Jian Wushuang was confident.

Three years may not have been a long period of time, but with enough resources, cultivating the Immortal Celestial Body’s second scroll would not be difficult. Even if he did not make it in time, he could still head for Three Emperors World without Third Stage Great Emperor fighting power.

“Good,” Emperor Bai nodded. “Regarding the list of experts that will follow you, Tian Chen and I have decided on that already. Take a look.”

Emperor Bai passed the list to Jian Wushuang.

He took a look at it. There were six more Great Emperors on it besides him.

Abysmal Saint Master, Underworld God, and Emperor God Tian Ling from the Sanctuary Alliance; King Chen Xing, Black Dragon Emperor, and Lei Yun from the Special Tribes Alliance.

Six Great Emperors – three from each alliance.

In terms of ability, Abysmal Saint Master, Underworld God, King Chen Xing and Black Dragon Emperor were Second Stage Great Emperors. Emperor God Tian Ling and Lei Yuan were pinnacle First Stage Great Emperors. Add Jian Wushuang himself, and the team became extremely formidable.

“What do you think?” Emperor Bai asked.

“It’ll do,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “But I want to add another person.”

“Oh?” Emperor Bai looked over, surprised.

“I have a sword servant by the name of Jian Yi. He is from the Ancient Era, his powers fully restored, with pinnacle Second Stage fighting powers,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Pinnacle Second Stage?” Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen’s eyes gleamed.

The current Eternal Chaotic World only had two people with that level of fighting power: Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang himself. They had never heard of a third person.

“Sure, bring him along. Just remember the list of people, no need to mention it for now. Three years from you, before you take off, find them one-by-one, and don’t tell them of your purpose, just in case,” Emperor Bai said.

“Understood.”

Jian Wushuang soon left.

…

Soon after Jian Wushuang returned to the Green Fire World, Ancestor Tian Chen sent people to deliver the resources Jian Wushuang needed. Jian Wushuang himself began to shut himself out.

In a secret room, Jian Wushuang sat in the middle of a pool. The water in the pool was emerald in colour, with its own fragrance.

The water was Eternal Chaotic World’s rare Emerald Heart Water, each drop containing pure and billowing Divine Power. A drop of this was rare in the world, but over here, there was a whole pool of it.

Besides that, there were other treasures.

Jian Wushuang absorbed the pure power frenzily to cultivate the second scroll. The faster he absorbed, the higher the price. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Every day Jian Wushuang cultivated, he used an astronomical figure of resources, enough to dumbfound an Almighty.

But in those circumstances, the Sanctuary Alliance did not hold back. No matter the price, as long as Jian Wushuang could cultivate in time, it would be worth it.

Time passed… three years soon flew by.

Specifically, it was only two years and nine months.

Within the secret room, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, and along with it a golden light emerged. A black, jade-like complexion covered his body.

“Immortal Celestial Body’s second scroll, complete at last!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, visibly excited.

Instantly, he could feel his divine body changing.

The Immortal Celestial Body itself was an extremely powerful skill, with the divine body going through the most change upon completion of the second scroll.

Without doubt, the strength of his divine body had risen to a whole new level, his self-defense mechanism now stronger.

With such a strong divine body, along with the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body he had obtained through Inverse Cultivation’s seventh step, even if he faced a pinnacle Third Stage expert, he would have no fear. He would not be able to kill Jian Wushuang. Once he truly reached Third Stage… he would be truly invincible!

By then, even a Fourth Stage Great Emperor could not stop him, and the highest one could go was the Fourth Stage.

Besides his divine body, his Divine Power had increased significantly as well.

“This power… slightly stronger than what I expected,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He could feel this billowing power.

This power was way beyond what a normal Great Emperor could possess.

Based on fundamental power itself, Jian Wushuang had already surpassed Great Emperors.

This was Inverse Cultivation’s advantage – it was not subject to the constrictions the land had placed.

Even Demon King Chen Yu’s fundamental powers could only hit pinnacle Great Emperor levels. It was only because of the secret skills he had learnt, along with Rules of Order, that he reached Third Stage. Jian Wushuang could not have beaten him previously in terms of power.

But now, even without Rules of Order, based on Inverse Cultivation’s advantage alone, along with the Immortal Celestial Body, he was on par with Demon King Chen Yu, or perhaps even stronger.
