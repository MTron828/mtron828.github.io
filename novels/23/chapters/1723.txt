Chapter 1724: Registered Disciple

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang glanced at He Xiu.

He Xiu took a deep breath and he then immediately knelt before Jian Wushuang and said, “I earnestly request for mister to take me on as your disciple. I will definitely serve you for the rest of my life.

“Disciple?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

He had only taken in one disciple officially in his life.

It was Lin Lan back in Ancient Worlds, who had really formally been apprenticed to him.

As for Chen Hu that he had met in Qing Tian Mystery Land during his third inverse cultivation test, although he gave pointers to him, strictly speaking, Chen Hu wasn’t his disciple and he had yet to reach the criteria to be his disciple.

However, He Xiu before him…

Frankly speaking, Jian Wushuang quite liked He Xiu.

He liked him mainly because of his disposition.

He was determined. He had a mad heart that was daring to give his all and bet his all!

Regardless of if it was when he hid in You Ming Mountains and the experts from the surrounding sixteen Holy Kingdoms couldn’t find him for over twenty years or when he had made his last best with the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas when he had no way to go, Jian Wushuang was in awe of what he did.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t intend to take on any disciples.

“He Xiu, I heard that you’re good with swords?” Jian Wushuang looked at He Xiu.

“Yes,” He Xiu nodded heavily.

“Show me,” Jian Wushuang looked calm. He flipped his hand and there was a long sword in his hand. “Show me all you’ve got.”

He Xiu stood up and looked at Jian Wushuang in front of him. His face grew solemn.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had given him a chance. The chance was hard to come by and there was only one. He had to grasp it.

He took a deep breath, then there was a crimson sword in He Xiu’s hands too. The crimson sword looked rather vicious.

Suddenly, He Xiu moved.

There was a sudden crimson light and it was piercingly cold, yet enchanting.

The moment it appeared, it substituted the lights in the universe.

He Xiu concentrated his understanding of swordsmanship over the years and all his power into the stroke.

That stroke was already a Real God-level of unique skill.

Looking at the crimson light, Jian Wushuang was surprised. He had originally thought He Xiu was only an ordinary family disciple of a Holy Kingdom. Although he was a genius, Jian Wushuang couldn’t be bothered with a genius in a Holy Kingdom.

When he saw He Xiu’s actions, Jian Wushuang realized that he was wrong.

Genius was normally found where it was least expected.

He Xiu was absolutely a genius.

“He should have turned into Universe God in the Third Heaven not long ago but he already created Real God level unique skill. Most importantly, he has already comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way.

Jian Wushuang could clearly feel that there was a slight bit of Extermination Power in He Xiu’s stroke.

Although his comprehension level was low and he had merely comprehended a slight bit, it was impressive for a Universe God.

“A hundred Universe Gods on Universe God ranking list, He Xiu will at least be in the top fifty,” Jian Wushuang complemented as he moved.

A simple yet calm stroke, as though it didn’t contain any power, but it happened to hit He Xiu’s crimson sword.

He Xiu’s sword momentum instantly dissolved and he staggered. He couldn’t help but took a few steps back.

“How did it happen?” He Xiu looked surprised. He obviously had yet to respond.

He saw Jian Wushuang’s stroke didn’t contain much power, nor contain much mystery. He didn’t even use any Power of Heaven Way but he broke his sword momentum so easily.

“Sword Principle!”

“It’s his understanding of Sword Principle. Mister’s understanding of Sword Principle is far beyond my imagination!”

He Xiu clenched his hand tightly and there was a great commotion in his heart.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were twinkling with curiosity too, “No matter if it is his swordsmanship, comprehension of Power of Heaven, or his talent, they are all extremely good. Plus, his disposition is great…”

“He Xiu,” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“Mister,” He Xiu replied politely.

“You are quite powerful. In swordsmanship, you’re highly talented too. You are really a genius that is hard to come by. If it were to be any other swordsman, I think they would be dying to take you on as their disciple, but I’m different.

Jian Wushuang said coldly, “My focus is to chase more power. I hardly have the time to teach a disciple. If you really want to be under me, I can only take you in as a registered disciple and give you simple guidance. As for if I would take you on as a lineal disciple, it depends on your capability and performance. Are you willing?”

“Of course I am,” He Xiu looked thrilled. He immediately knelt down before Jian Wushuang and kowtowed politely. “Disciple, He Xiu, greets Master.”

“Get up then,” Jian Wushuang waved and He Xiu felt a bolt of energy that guided him to stand up on his feet instantly.

“As you are my disciple, you should know my name. I am Jian Wushuang, from Lineage of Star. Also, I am an inverse cultivator,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Inverse cultivator?” He Xiu was surprised. He had heard about inverse cultivators but he didn’t know much.

“I’ll bring you back to Lineage of Star first. As for other matters, you’ll slowly find out,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Mm,” He Xiu nodded but he suddenly paused, “Oh yeah, master. One more thing, it’s about this.”

He Xiu flipped his wrist and there was a weird-looking jade sword in his hand.

The jade sword was made of an unknown jade. Even Jian Wushuang couldn’t determine it. The jade sword obviously didn’t look like it was for killing but it should be something like a token.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“The jade sword is like the Taiqing Ancient Panacea. My father found them in Sir God Dan Hong’s cave dwelling. My father told me that the jade sword was related to a great opportunity and he told me to take good care of it. As for what the opportunity is, he had no idea either,” He Xiu replied honestly.

“Opportunity?” Jian Wushuang was interested.

Then, he recalled the information that You Ming Pub provided. It had said that not only did He Family receive the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas from Sir God Dan Hong’s cave dwelling, they had also got an opportunity, but no one knew what opportunity it was.

The people who chased after He Xiu were attracted the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas and they forgot about the opportunity.

It seemed like the opportunity would be the jade sword.

But, looking at the jade sword itself, Jian Wushuang had no idea what it represented.

“Wait till Hall Master Yuan and the others see the jade sword, they might know the origin of the jade sword,” Jian Wushuang thought.

“He Xiu, let’s go. Follow me back to the Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang said.

He Xiu naturally followed Jian Wushuang obediently.

The two of them sat in the spaceship as it traveled to Lineage of Star directly.
