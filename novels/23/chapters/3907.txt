Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Blood Sword Master, can you take us out of the Eternal Dark Prison?” Demon Dragon Lord stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Not only that, you only need to submit to me for 100,000 years. I can swear to the universal principle that you will be free in 100,000 years. Demon Dragon Lord, you have fought for so many years in the Eternal Dark Prison and fought so hard to reach your current position. Now you have a chance to leave, and the price is only 100,000 years. You have to think carefully.”

Demon Dragon Lord frowned and pondered for a moment before raising his head again, he said, “Now I finally understand why Emperor Sha, such a proud man, is willing to submit to you. You’re right. It’s only 100,000 years. Even if I have to work for you for 100,000 years, or even become your plaything like Star Demon Ancestor, I’ll accept it.”

“Demon Dragon Lord, you’re not that stupid.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

It was obvious that Demon Dragon Lord had agreed to submit.

“What about you guys?” Jian Wushuang looked back at Stone Fire Star Master, Red One Ruler, and the others.

Among them, Demon King Myriad Bones, Dark Fire Ruler, and Marquis Suxin agreed without thinking.

They had submitted to Demon Dragon Lord before, but they did not allow him to leave a mark in the soul origin.

Now, they had submitted to Jian Wushuang for only 100,000 years. However, Jian Wushuang was able to take them out of the Eternal Dark Prison. It was definitely a good deal.

As for the Red One Ruler and the Ruler Spark, they both chose to submit without hesitation.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was delighted.

Among the experts who submitted to him, Demon Dragon Lord was one of the ten great kings. He was probably close to the peak of the third-level Ruler. In the future, he would definitely be a great battle force in the battle with Devil Cloud Star.

As for the Red One Ruler, his battle strength was no weaker than the Emperor Sha Ruler, and he was also a great help.

However, the one who really excited Jian Wushuang was the Ruler Spark.

The Ruler Spark was the best in Eternal Darkness Prison Array Formation. With him around, his two sword formations could be greatly improved and perfected.

In just a moment, Jian Wushuang had left a mark in the soul origin of the Rulers in front of him and had absolute control over them.

“The cave mansion where White Melody Demon Lord lives is right in front of us. Demon Dragon, Stone Fire, and Emperor Sha, you three follow me. The rest of you wait here,” Jian Wushuang instructed.

“Yes.” Everyone naturally accepted the order.

In the cave mansion, Jian Wushuang sat on a stone bench while Demon Dragon Lord, Stone Fire, and Emperor Sha stood in front of him.

“Stone Fire.” Jian Wushuang looked at Stone Fire first.

“Master.” Ruler Spark smiled humbly. Although Ruler Spark looked arrogant, he was actually a very humble man with a good temper. The reason why he was imprisoned in Eternal Darkness Prison…was purely because he had offended the people of the Red Cloud branch, not because he had committed a heinous crime.

“I created two sword formations. Blood Rain Demon Monarch improved them a lot for me, but I still feel that there is a lot of room for improvement. You are good at formations and your attainments in formations are recognized as the best in the Eternal Darkness Prison. From now on, you will stay by my side and help me improve these two sword formations,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Ruler Spark nodded immediately.

“Demon Dragon, you are one of the ten emperors of Eternal Darkness Prison and the Lord of the Demon Dragon Field. Do you have any Principles Supreme Treasures?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No.” Demon Dragon Lord shook his head.

“None?” Jian Wushuang looked strange.

“Master, there are indeed a few principles supreme treasures in Eternal Darkness Prison, but there are not many. Among the ten emperors, there are a few who have principles supreme treasures, but I’m at the bottom of the list, so I don’t have any.” Demon Dragon Lord said bitterly.

“The bottom of the list?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “Why? Are you at the bottom of the list?”

“I’m at the bottom. At least I know that six of the ten kings are stronger than me. As for the other four, they’re probably the same as me,” Demon Dragon Lord said.

“Which of the other kings have a nomological treasure?” Jian Wushuang asked again. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“There are four known kings who have a principle supreme treasure. They are blood mountain lord, Redbud Domain Lord, Bone Emperor, and Devil Scorpion Lord. As for the other kings, they may also have a principle supreme treasure, but they have never taken it out. Among the four known kings who have a principle Supreme Treasure, Devil Scorpion Lord has the most principle supreme treasures. He has five principle Supreme Treasures,” Demon Dragon Lord said.

“What? Five?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

In the vast universe, there were only one or two principle supreme treasures in the fourth or even fifth level.

He had also passed the test of the Red Cloud World by chance and obtained a principle Supreme Treasure, divine sword, and a Heaven Suppression Tablet left by his Master Xuan Yi.

But now, in the first level of Eternal Dark Prison, where the highest level was a third level Ruler, someone had five principle supreme treasures at the same time?

These five principle supreme treasures instantly tempted Jian Wushuang.

“Demon Dragon, are you sure that Devil Scorpion Lord has five principle Supreme Treasures?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

“Of course I’m sure. To tell you the truth, I’ve met the old scorpion several times and even fought with him. I know his strength and trump cards very well. I’m sure that he has five principle supreme treasures, and one of them is a principle supreme treasure long staff that is completely suitable for me to use. I went to him personally and was willing to pay a huge price to exchange for the principle supreme treasure long staff, but he refused.”

“The reason I came to you this time is to get the two principle supreme treasures in your hands and exchange them for the long staff,” Demon Dragon Lord said.

“If you get my two principle Supreme Treasures, will Devil Scorpion Lord give them to you?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“Of course, he will beg me to exchange them,” Demon Dragon Lord said affirmatively.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“Master, you don’t know. Devil Scorpion Lord has five principle treasures, two of which are special stone tablets. I heard from Ruler Red One that he has a 30,000-meter-tall stone tablet with golden secret patterns on its surface. It should be the same as the two stone tablets in Devil Scorpion Lord’s hand,” Demon Dragon Lord said.

“The Heaven Suppression Tablet!” Jian Wushuang stood up abruptly. “You mean the Devil Scorpion Lord has two Heaven Suppression Tablets?”
