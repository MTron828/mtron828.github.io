Chapter 2487: Going Home

On the way back to Anjiu Commandery.

“Little Brother, did you really defeat those three Supreme Elders of the Great Compassion Sect?”

“Little Brother, how on earth did you cultivate your skills?”

“Father sent me a message a long time ago, saying your sword skill is unparalleled in the world. I didn’t believe it much at that time, but now...”

Zhuo Bing was talking non-stop while walking alongside Jian Wushuang. She was obviously impressed by her little brother’s strength.

Jian Wushuang was rather patient with his relatives and hence briefly responded to her questions.

“By the way, Little Brother, if the Great Compassion Sect hasn’t given you an explanation after a month, will you really pay them a visit?” Zhuo Bing looked over quizzically.

Jian Wushuang smiled. “Of course I will, since I have already said so, I will definitely not break my promise.”

“However, the Great Compassionate Sect is recognized as the top sect of Wusha Wilderness after all. Its background and strength should not be taken lightly.” Zhuo Bing frowned.

“I know. I’ve absolute confidence to handle them since I’ve decided to do so. Big Sister, don’t worry. I’m not bragging. There may be some experts in Wusha Wilderness who can beat me but there are almost none who can kill me,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He was not bragging.

His divine body was extremely powerful from being a Perfect Chaotic Creature. He had the perfect immortal body making it impossible to kill him even if an Undying Saint tried to. Generally, the Ultimate Gods were the strongest in Wusha Wilderness. Even when many Ultimate Gods combined their strength, they could pose no harm to him since they were unable to kill him.

Jian Wushuang knew there was a mysterious expert in the Wusha Wilderness when he mentioned ‘almost none’.

Daoist Xuan Shen!

The Daoist who visited Blazing Moon City when he was born, calculated his birth chart, and bestowed him the name—Jian Wushuang.

If there was anyone capable of killing him in the Wusha Wilderness, Daoist Xuan Shen would be one of them.

...

“We’re home.”

Jian Wushuang was pleased. After journeying for a few days, Zhuo Bing and Jian Wushuang finally arrived at Blazing Moon City.

The two immediately went toward the Governor’s mansion.

At the gate of the Governor’s mansion. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Four figures flew out of the mansion and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Pleasure to meet Master Jian Wushuang.”

The four of them respectfully saluted Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang studied the four people in front of him. Those four people were Second-Class Divine Demons. They must be the ones sent by Elder Wujian to protect his parents.

The four had already sent Zhuo Yunfeng and his wife to a safe place but returned to Blazing Moon City due to Jian Wushuang’s return.

“Although Elder Wujian is an elder of Narcissus Island, it’s remarkable he can mobilize four Second-Class Divine Demons based on his personal abilities.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and immediately waved his hand. Four Interspatial Rings appeared in front of those four people.

“Thank you very much for your help. There are a lot of resources in these Interspatial Rings. Please take them as my gratitude. You may leave and return to Narcissus Island now that I’m here,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

The four Second-Class Divine Demons took those Interspatial Rings and took a quick glance inside it. They were overjoyed to discover its contents.

Jian Wushuang had killed many genius disciples in the tomb and among them were many First-Class Divine Demons. He also killed the five Peak Divine Demons such as Tu Qiancheng outside the tomb. He was rich from making a fortune out of their belongings.

The four Second-Class Divine Demons were extremely pleased to receive the gifts from Jian Wushuang.

“Master, we’ll now leave.”

The four Second-Class Divine Demons left soon after.

Jian Wushuang and Zhuo Bing stepped into the Governor’s mansion.

As soon as they were in the mansion, Jian Wushuang immediately spotted Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin who were welcoming them from the inner courtyard.

“Father, Mother.” Zhuo Bing ran over immediately.

“Bing’er.” Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were very happy.

“Father, Mother. I’m home,” Jian Wushuang called out gently.

“I heard from those four Masters that you’ve encountered some troubles and was forced to secretly evacuate us. Your mother and I have been worrying about you. Has the trouble been resolved now?” Zhuo Yunfeng looked over.

“Almost,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“Father, Little Brother is amazing. His strength is even more impressive. We don’t have to worry about anything with him around.” Zhuo Bing comforted.

“Oh?” Zhuo Yunfeng looked curious.

“Don’t listen to Big Sister. She is exaggerating. As long as I’m around, I’ll never let my relatives suffer.” Jian Wushuang promised.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin looked at each other and were quite relieved upon hearing that.

Luo Xinqin had figured Jian Wushuang’s real origins. She suspected Jian Wushuang might be a reincarnated person. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, whether Jian Wushuang was a reincarnated person or otherwise did not matter to them as they were content with Jian Wushuang willingly considered them as his parents.

“Come, let’s go in and talk. It so happens Peng’er sent me a message yesterday, saying he will be back in a few days. We will have a reunion soon,” said Zhuo Yunfeng.

“Second Brother is coming back?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows and a smile appeared on his face.

Three days later, Zhuo Peng returned from the Ice Fire God Palace.

The family had finally reunited and had a family dinner.

At the family dinner, Zhuo Peng told his parents everything that had happened to Jian Wushuang in Saint’s Tomb.

He even asked Jian Wushuang directly, “Third Brother, I heard from several seniors at Ice Fire God Palace that you killed a lot of various sects’ genius disciples in the tomb and those sects were angry. However, none of them could do anything to you. Even the Ultimate Gods who attempted to do so were defeated, right?”

“Uh...” Jian Wushuang was speechless.

“Ultimate Gods?” Zhuo Yunfeng was taken aback and immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Husband, what are Ultimate Gods?” Luo Xinqin asked.

“Ultimate Gods are super experts in Wusha Wilderness. They are above the Divine Demon realm. I heard many top sects’ leaders in Wusha Wilderness, such as Lord of Great Compassion Sect and Lord of Narcissus Island are Ultimate Gods,” said Zhuo Yunfeng.

“What?” Luo Xinqin was startled and immediately looked at Jian Wushuang. She was still in shock when she said, “Shuang’er, did you really defeated those Ultimate Gods?”

“I merely engaged a few duels with them. It was not as exaggerated as what Second Brother said.” Jian Wushuang touched his nose and smiled lightly.

Even then, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were still shocked.

“My son...” Zhuo Yunfeng was amazed but was able to understand after considering Luo Xinqin’s speculations.

Just when Jian Wushuang and his family were reunited, a sudden huge explosion was heard in Wusha Wilderness.

The Lord of Great Compassion Sect who spent years in retreat came out!
