“Temporal Temple Master?” Elder Dark Bone was stunned.

“Temple Master?” The experts of the Temporal Temple were overjoyed.

“Temple Master has returned to the Divine Beginning Realm?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked at Temple Master Bai Xing.

As far as he knew, Temporal Temple Master had been adventuring in the universe battlefield for a long time. The last time he came back from the universe battlefield was millions of years ago.

“The Palace Master has indeed returned to the Divine Beginning Realm. In fact, he had already decided to come back. It’s just that his previous location in the universe battlefield was quite far from the Divine Beginning Realm. In addition, he encountered some things on the way, so he was delayed for some time. This time, after the collision with the three great Saint Realms, I sent a message to the Palace Master early in the morning, and the Palace Master returned as fast as he could,” said Bai Xing Palace Master.

“That’s great!”

“The Palace Master’s strength is monstrous. If he comes, the three great Saint Realms will not dare to be arrogant!”

“Right, as long as the Palace Master arrives, we don’t need to be afraid of the three great Saint Realm Masters.”

Many experts of the Temporal Temple were excited.

The Temporal Temple Master had single-handedly created the Temporal Temple. He was the absolute overlord of the Divine Beginning Realm!

Moreover, the Temporal Temple master was different from the three Saint Realm Masters of the three great holy regions. The three Saint Realm Masters had the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao, which was why they had the strength that surpassed the Principles Masters, however, the Temporal Temple Master, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and the Heavenly Ancestor had their own cultivation base that exceeded the scope of the Principles Masters.

In terms of strength and ability, the Temporal Temple master was far stronger than the masters of the Saint Realm.

This was also why it was rumored that a Saint Realm master would be inferior to an existence like Temporal Temple Master.

In the current situation, although there were already two Saint Realm Masters in the three Saint Realms, as long as Temporal Temple Master arrived, the three Saint Realms would not be able to do anything to Jian Wushuang.

“Temple Master, it will take 15 minutes to get here. As for the Flame Saint Realm, Dark Bone, I can only hope that you can delay him as much as possible,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“I’ll do my best,” Dark Bone said with a serious expression, “But let me be clear. Although I’ll try my best to stop the Flame Saint Master, I’ll leave this place as soon as I’m under too much pressure and my life is threatened.”

“Of course, we only hope you can do your best, but we don’t dare to force you if you die,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Elder Dark Bone only helped Jian Wushuang because his disciple, Underworld Emperor, owed him a favor.

However, there was a limit to this favor. It was already very rare that Elder Dark Bone was willing to help. Jian Wushuang and the people of the Temporal Temple did not expect him to risk his life for them.

“Flame Saint Master, long time no see.” Elder Dark Bone looked at the Flame Saint Master in front of him.

“Dark Bone? Are you sure you want to get involved in this?” Flame Saint Master’s gaze was cold as he glanced at Elder Dark Bone.

“I originally didn’t want to get involved, but that disciple of mine owes this little fellow a favor. You also know that I’ve lived for so long, and it wasn’t easy for me to take in such a disciple.” Elder Dark Bone laughed.

“Very good. Then this battle, I’ll take care of you as well.” Flame Saint Master said coldly, “I’ll kill Dark Bone. As for Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’ll leave him to you!”

“No problem.” A cold voice suddenly sounded from the other side of the void. When everyone looked over, they found that a woman in blood-red clothes had appeared in the empty void.

Although this woman in blood-red clothes was not considered very beautiful, the ruler-like temperament that she had had for a long time was enough to make people submit to her.

“Another Saint Realm Master?”

“Three Saint Realm Masters from the three great Saint Realms are all here!”

“Tsk tsk, this is a scene that is rarely seen in billions of years.”

The surrounding experts who were watching the battle had already become numb to the shock.

All they could think about now was how fortunate they were to be here and be able to see a scene that was rarely seen in billions of years.

“This is bad!”

The hearts of the experts from the Temporal Temple jolted.

“Everyone, although I have some tricks that can barely hold off a Saint Realm Master, I don’t have the ability to deal with two Saint Realm Masters at the same time.” Elder Dark Bone’s voice became anxious.

He was confident that he could survive if he fought against a Saint Realm Master alone. However, he was not confident that he could survive if he fought against two Saint Realm Masters at the same time.

If the Temporal Temple needed him to fight against two Saint Realm Masters at the same time, he would not hesitate to leave because it was impossible.

At this time, Jian Wushuang, who had been protected by the experts of the Temporal Temple, finally spoke.

“Senior Dark Bone,” Jian Wushuang looked at Elder Dark Bone and said, “Don’t worry, senior. You just need to think of a way to stall the Flame Saint Master. As for Destruction Saint Master, leave him to me.”

“Leave him to you?” Elder Dark Bone was stunned.

Many experts of the Temporal Temple also looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

A master of the Saint Realm, the most terrifying existence in the Divine Beginning Realm, even an expert at the peak of the six void realms did not have the courage to confront a master of the Saint Realm head-on. Elder Dark Bone only had the ability to fight a Saint Realm Master because he had lived for too long and had too many tricks up his sleeve, that was why he had the ability to fight a Saint Realm Master for a short while.

But now, Jian Wushuang, an Immortal Saint, said he would fight a Saint Realm Master?

Although Jian Wushuang had displayed extraordinary strength and skills in the previous battle, it was still too incredible for him to fight a Saint Realm Master alone.

Under the astonished and doubtful gazes of the surrounding people, Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out a purple bamboo leaf.

At first glance, the purple bamboo leaf looked ordinary. It only had a special purple halo around its surface. However, the moment they saw the purple bamboo leaf, the experts of the Temporal Temple...their pupils constricted.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, this bamboo leaf is...” Temple Master Bai Xing looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Because she had vaguely felt a suffocating aura from the purple bamboo leaf.

“The Heaven-cleaving Alliance gave me this bamboo leaf.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance had given him three things at once. Two of them were made by Palace Master Shuiyun and Palace Master Askance, which contained the magic power of the two palace masters, these two pearls had been used during the battle.

The last thing was the purple bamboo leaf in Jian Wushuang’s hand. It was also the most precious life-saving item among the three!
