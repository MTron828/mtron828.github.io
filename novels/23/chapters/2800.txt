Chapter 2801: Turning The Tide!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Heads were sent flying like wheat.

In a flash, Jian Wushuang had killed nearly ten great divine masters from the four forces.

Whoosh!

Jian wushuang dashed out again.

“Run, run! !”

“Run!”

The remaining great divine masters from the four forces were scared out of their wits. When they saw Jian wushuang charging out again, they did not hesitate and began to run frantically.

Everyone was running, including the life and Death Tower Master, the Dongfang family master, and the East God, the three peak great divine masters.

They knew very well that Jian Wushuang could kill Ba Xiong with one strike, and he could also kill them with one strike.

If they did not flee now, they would all die!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A large number of people were frantically fleeing in all directions. Despite the suppression of the realm and the restriction of the divine power sea, Jian Wushuang was able to catch up with very few of them.

However, his eyes had long been fixed on one person. It was the East God!

“The divine demon sect has suffered heavy losses because of our sword league. The East God hates me to the bone. We can’t let this potential threat escape.”Jian wushuang sneered. With a thought, the realm that had covered the entire battlefield rumbled, it was supposed to oppress all the experts of the four forces.

But in this battle, the great domain was oppressing the East God alone.

“What?”

Under the pressure of the great domain, the already heavily injured East God was once again suppressed. His strength was greatly reduced, and his speed was greatly reduced.

Jian wushuang only made a simple charge forward, and he was already beside the east god.

Then, a sword light flashed.

“No!”

The East God let out a hysterical roar, but the roar gradually disappeared. His eyes dimmed, and his body began to fall down weakly.

After killing the east god, Jian Wushuang did not chase after the other experts who had fled. Instead, he let them escape the battlefield.

In just a moment, all the experts who had survived the four forces had fled.

“Is it over?”

Jian wushuang looked at the battlefield that had completely calmed down and let out a sigh of relief. Then, the divine power sea that had filled the battlefield, as well as the techniques of the four realms, were slowly withdrawn. The 30,000-meter-tall golden emperor behind him also slowly disappeared.

The Mountain River Map was also withdrawn and turned into a golden light that entered his divine body again.

All means had stopped. At this moment, Jian Wushuang was feeling the divine power in his body.

“I’ve used up 50% of My Divine Power?”

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked when he saw that there was only 50% of his divine power left.

One had to know that his divine power was extremely vast. Although it could not be said to be endless, the amount was indeed enough to scare people to death.

In an ordinary fierce battle, even if he had to fight for a long time, his divine power would be very limited. Under normal circumstances, it would be very rare for him to use more than 10% of his divine power. But in this battle.., he had used up 50% of his battle strength and half of it!

Jian wushuang could not help but exclaim that he had really put in a lot of effort in this battle.

The many secret skills that he had used... whether it was the seven-star secret skill, the divine punishment skill, or the nine luminaries star armor, all required a tremendous amount of divine power.

He had used a lot of divine power just to use these three secret skills. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had been trying his best to maintain the four realms since the beginning of the battle. Each of the four realms consumed a lot of divine power. However, he had been using them from the beginning of the battle until the end, after all, an extremely long time had passed.

As for the mountain and river map... it was extremely difficult to use a supreme treasure like it. An ordinary peak divine master could only use the sword principle world of the Thousand Treasures great world for a short period of time, his divine power might not be able to withstand it, but Jian wushuang had been using it for a very long time.

Moreover, he used the divine emperor seal and the true emperor seal of the nine-region seal.

Such a method consumed a huge amount of divine power.

However, although these secret skills consumed a huge amount of divine power, it was still acceptable for Jian Wushuang’s massive divine power. What really consumed him was the final burst of divine power sea.

The burst of divine power was to isolate the battlefield between the two sides and prevent further damage to the experts of the red stone castle and the Sword League.

Although this move did not last long, it consumed a lot of divine power when the massive divine power kept surging.

Only Jian Wushuang dared to play like this. If it were anyone else, even the top immortal saint would not be able to do this.

During the time when the divine power sea erupted, he had used up 30% of his divine power, and the other 20% was consumed by his various secret skills.

In total, he had only used up 50% of his divine power.

“Ever since I broke through to the Divine Devil Realm and became a perfect chaotic creature, it’s the first time I’ve used up so much divine power,”Jian wushuang muttered, “A perfect chaotic creature has the most perfect immortal body, which requires divine power to recover. For other cultivators, the soul is the root, but for me, divine power is the most important thing. As long as I don’t use up my divine power, no one can kill me!”!

“This time, I’ve used up too much divine power. I’ll take it easy in the future. Unless it’s really a life-or-death situation, I can only use 30% of my divine power. The remaining 70% will be used to save my life,”Jian wushuang muttered to himself.

While he was pondering, many experts from the red stone castle and the Sword League had surrounded him.

These experts were shocked and could not calm down for a long time.

They looked at Jian wushuang with respect and admiration.

Their camp was at an absolute disadvantage in this battle. It could even be said that there was no room for them to fight back.

At the beginning of the battle, almost everyone thought that their camp would lose this battle. It was just a question of whether they would lose too miserably.

But who would have thought... that this sword union chief, Jian Yi, who was merely emitting the aura of a senior great deity, would use lightning-fast methods to first defeat and heavily injure East God. Then, he would fight against Palace Master Nan Wu alone, after a fierce battle, he killed Palace Master Nan Wu directly.

In the end, he single-handedly fought against all the experts from the four forces’camps, and in the end, he swept through all the experts from the four forces’camps, killing them until the four forces’camps could only flee frantically.

In this battle, he had killed three peak great deities one after another, including palace master Nan Wu, who was the strongest.

It could be said that he had single-handedly turned the tables on the situation that he was bound to lose!
