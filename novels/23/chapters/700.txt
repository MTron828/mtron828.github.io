Chapter 701: Clansman?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the outer layer of the Eternal Zone, two figures were gliding in the endless forest.

Jian Wushuang was following the Copper-armored Demon God, Gu Qiong.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re pretty good. You can keep up with me,” Gu Qiong said as he turned to give the boy a friendly glance.

“Yeah, fortunately.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Suddenly… Boom!

A violent sound arose, accompanied by two streams of mighty power.

“Someone is fighting.” Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

“Shit, there must be outsiders,” Gu Qiong mumbled and then accelerated.

Soon after, they arrived at a battlefield.

A patch of dense forest had disappeared as all the big trees were shattering into pieces. Two figures were fighting in the center of a huge open space.

A stone-faced man with a mighty aura was waving his long spear. He was proficient in the Raging Fire Dao, so every strike was scorching and violent.

“It’s him!”

Jian Wushuang immediately recognized the stone-faced man.

Although he did not know his name, Jian Wushuang had met this superior Divine Realm expert when many disciples gathered in the Eternal Zone.

The stone-faced man was four meters tall with silver skin that sparkled in the sunshine.

“A Silver-armored Demon God,”?Jian Wushuang thought while narrowing his eyes.

Silver-armored Demon Gods were much stronger than Copper-armored Demon Gods.

“He’s our captain.”

The moment he saw this Silver-armored Demon God, Gu Qiong burst into hearty laughter and said in a confident tone, “Haha, it’s not the outsider’s day. He’s encountered our captain.”

Jian Wushuang sensed that this Silver-armored Demon God was terrifying.

This Silver-armored Demon God held a Silver Mace in each of his giant hands. At this point, he was successively swinging his weapons, which contained the strength of billions of pounds, while his opponent had exerted his full strength but was still losing ground.

Every time the Silver-armored Demon God hit the stone-faced man’s long spear, the latter would shiver. Obviously, he was unable to counter such violent power. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After a while, the stone-faced man’s hands started bleeding.

”?How powerful!?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He sensed that the stone-faced man was as strong as a superior Divine Realm expert and more powerful than Hu Hu, but he was far inferior to the Silver-armored Demon God in strength, speed, and skill.

“This Silver-armored Demon God is proficient in close-fighting,”?Jian Wushuang said to himself.

Upon realizing that there was no chance to strike back, the stone-faced man turned to flee without hesitation. Although the Silver-armored Demon God chased after him, the stone-faced man was a Core Disciple of the Boundless Demon Sect and had an excellent life-saving skill, so he easily escaped.

“It’s a pity that this outsider escaped.” Gu Qiong sighed and walked toward the Silver-armored Demon God.

“Captain.” Gu Qiong greeted him in a resonant voice.

The Silver-armored Demon God, who had landed on the ground, turned his head in surprise. When he saw Gu Qiong, he broke into a smile, saying, “And what are your battle results?”

“Bad luck. I only encountered an outsider over the last two days. He was as strong as me, so he left when he realized that he was unable to kill me,” Gu Qiong replied.

“Those outsiders have incredible skills, so it’s hard to kill them.” The Silver-armored Demon God nodded slightly. He was capable of defeating the stone-faced man, but he could do nothing if his opponent escaped.

“You’re lucky. At least you’re alive. Gu Feng and Gu Ying are dead,” the Silver-armored Demon God said.

“What?” Gu Qiong was astonished. Then he clenched his hands, with fury burning in his eyes. “Damn it.”

“The outsiders are our enemies. They desire our Essence Blood to improve their strength while we train ourselves by fighting with them. We all take what we need.” The Silver-armored Demon God sighed.

Upon hearing this, Gu Qiong shook his head.

“Right, captain, I met a clansman on my way. He is a little boy who hasn’t been baptized,” Gu Qiong suddenly said.

“Oh?” The Silver-armored Demon God was surprised.

Gu Qiong turned to shout toward the forest. “Boy, come out.”

Jian Wushuang wore a solemn expression and hesitated, debating whether to go out or not.

Although Gu Qiong regarded him as his clansman, this captain would probably recognize that he was an outsider.

And once he was recognized by the Silver-armored Demon God… Jian Wushuang knew that he was unable to fight him.

“I can’t match him in a head-on fight, so if I run, he won’t have an opportunity to kill me.”?Jian Wushuang was deep in thought and finally decided to meet this Silver-armored Demon God.

He wanted to figure out why Gu Qiong treated him as his clansman.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang flew out of the dense forest and appeared in front of the two Demon Gods.

He deliberately stood 10 meters away from them and remained on guard. Even if this Silver-armored Demon God suddenly attacked him, he would be able to react in time.

“Jian Wushuang, why are you so slow? We’re family. What are you afraid of?” Gu Qiong looked at the boy with a smile.

The Silver-armored Demon God also scrutinized the boy, who was a bit perturbed.

“Jian Wushuang?” The Silver-armored Demon God looked him up and down and then said with a frown, “This name is similar to that of the outsiders. It’s strange that he’s here, but his Soul Aura is indeed consistent with our clansmen.”
