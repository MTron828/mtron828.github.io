Chapter 781: The Arrival of Teacher!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You even sent your Original Body here. Well, seems that the Cloud Sea Asgard really thinks highly of me.”

Jian Wushuang blurted out these words with a note of distinct taunt.

Hearing this, the experts from the various sects all turned sullen, murmuring under their breath.

And as for the members of the Cloud Sea Asgard, including Tian Yunzi, they all looked rather glum.

The Cloud Sea Asgard was one of the three magnates in the Firmament Territory and had claimed to be the top sect. But today, in order to deal with just one Divine Realm expert, they sent out almost all their experts and resorted to all their means and skills.

From the moment Yun Fan stepped forward to fight against Jian Wushuang, they were already bullying the outnumbered. However, they failed. Then, in desperation, Yun Fan joined hands with Saber Master of the Immortal Dynasty and Old Weirdo Dream of the Boundless Demon Sect.

The three guys, each of whom had lived for numerous years in this world, cooperated to take down Jian Wushuang. Nevertheless, they were still crashed by Jian Wushuang’s frontal attack.

Furthermore, the three even asked all the experts of the three magnates on the scene to attack Jian Wushuang at the same time.

This was already too outrageous. But even when all the experts united together and launched strikes against Jian Wushuang, they were still completely routed. Furthermore, Yun Fan was almost killed by Jian Wushuang.

At this point, Tian Yunzi, the Palace Master of the Cloud Sea Asgard, appeared again.

In the beginning, Tian Yunzi only dispatched his doppelganger to fight, but it was nearly killed when Jian Wushuang employed one of his trump cards. Seeing how critical the situation was, Tian Yunzi’s Original Body came on stage.

And all this actually happened in the presence of all those experts from assorted sects of the Firmament Territory.

To defeat Jian Wushuang, a mere Divine Realm expert, the Cloud Sea Asgard had depleted all its means. Yet, they still could not vanquish him. Eventually, they had to invite the Original Body of their Palace Master, the strongest Tian Yunzi, to fight him…If this incident got about, the Cloud Sea Asgard would certainly become a standing joke in the Firmament Territory.

Yes, a hilarious joke.

The experts of the Cloud Sea Asgard were all aware of this, and this was why their looks turned so nasty.

“Jian Wushuang,” Tian Yunzi bellowed coldly, his face glum. “I don’t have time to bicker with you. Just be a lamb and follow me to my Cloud Sea Asgard. If so, I can guarantee your safety. If not…”

Before Tian Yunzi finished this sentence, a dreamy voice suddenly sounded.

“If not? If not, so what?”

These words fluttered in from the Void, mingled with a sneer. All the experts on the scene instantly turned to look at the source of the voice.

They saw that a straight and tall, purple-haired man with a friendly face was strolling towards them.

He was walking very slowly. Each of the steps he made caused a ripple in the Void, which gradually spread to the surroundings.

When he walked onto the battlefield, the whole place was wrapped in vast ripples, and he was standing in the center of all these ripples.

Once this man arrived, the focal point of the whole scene immediately shifted from Tian Yunzi to him.

“Xuan Yi!” Seeing the newcomer, Tian Yunzi’s pupils bulged.

“Teacher.” Flames of joy danced in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi!” The nine Palace Masters of the Ancient Sect were all heartened.

As for the rest of the experts on the scene, they were thrilled, too.

“It’s Xuan Yi! Xuan Yi’s here!”

“He should be here much earlier than this. I wonder what took him so long this time.”

“Now, this is interesting. Palace Master Xuan Yi was always eager to defend for his disciples. 100 years ago, when he learned that Jian Wushuang failed to get out of the Eternal Zone, with a rush of wrath, he killed seven top Eternal Realm experts of the Cloud Sea Asgard at one go. The Cloud Sea Asgard even did not have the guts to complain. Now, since the Cloud Sea Asgard has turned into a bully and attacked Jian Wushuang several times with despicable means, Palace Master Xuan Yi must be raging.”

“We have a show now. But the opponent that Xuan Yi is facing today is Tian Yunzi, the Palace Master of the Cloud Sea Asgard who is at the level of Dao Master. I’m afraid Xuan Yi can’t be as domineering as he used to be.”

Everyone was waiting with bated breath.

Xuan Yi was said to be the most mysterious man in the Firmament Territory, and also the one that could not be messed around with the most.

As for Tian Yunzi, he was a supreme expert at the level of Dao Master, who also had the whole Cloud Sea Asgard backing him up.

The interaction between these two would be quite interesting.

“Xuan Yi, you’re finally willing to appear in public, aren’t you?”

Tian Yunzi stared at Xuan Yi, his expression did not change much. He said, “Apparently, you have been here for a while, but you hid in the dark until now. Aren’t you worried that your sweet disciple might die in the hands of our Cloud Sea Asgard?”

“Oho, if my disciple dies, I will send all the Eternal Realm experts of your Cloud Sea Asgard down to hell to accompany him,” Xuan Yi said composedly.

There was a murmur of terror around the crowd.

In the entire Firmament Territory, Palace Master Xuan Yi was probably the only one who dared to proclaim sending the Eternal Realm disciples of the Cloud Sea Asgard to accompany his disciple in the netherworld.

“Xuan Yi, aren’t you looking down on us too much?” Tian Yunzi asked in a deep voice.

“Indeed I am. But what can you do about that?” Xuan Yi laughed.

“You!” Tian Yunzi yelled and a flow of rage stole over him.

He used to have some dealings with Xuan Yi, and he knew basically what kind of person Xuan Yi was. Xuan Yi was truly qualified to be on an equal footing with him. But to his surprise, Xuan Yi had behaved so arrogantly in front of him.

“Teacher.” At this point in time, Jian Wushuang already came to stand by Xuan Yi.

“Hmm.” Xuan Yi nodded slightly at Jian Wushuang. “Don’t speak now. Relax, just stand behind me, and I’ll handle the rest.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He never doubted his master.

“Tian Yunzi, you owe me an explanation for today’s matter.” Xuan Yi opened his mouth, his nonchalant reverberated in the area.

“Explanation?” Tian Yunzi glanced at Xuan Yi and snorted. “100 years ago, when you killed seven of our Eternal Realm experts because your disciple did not walk out of the Eternal Zone, I didn’t come to you for an explanation!”

“100 years ago? Well, at that time, men from your Cloud Sea Asgard did attack my disciple. And I only killed seven of your Eternal Realm experts. Wasn’t that what you deserved?” Xuan Yi said.

“100 years ago, you already knew that your disciple didn’t die?” Tian Yunzi said, staring at Xuan Yi.

“Yes.” Xuan Yi replied honestly and did not try to deny this fact at all. “If my disciple really died, do you think your Cloud Sea Asgard would merely suffer such a small loss? Could the Immortal Dynasty and the Boundless Demon Sect possibly stifle my anger with a compensation of a few Divine Gems?”

“You jerk!” Flames of anger were raging in Tian Yunzi’s eyes.

“The real jerk is your Cloud Sea Asgard. My disciple is merely a Divine Realm expert, but to deal with him, your Cloud Sea Asgard sent out loads of experts. And in the end, even you, the Palace Master of the Cloud Sea Asgard, came to the battlefield in person. You, Tian Yunzi, a Dao Master, is about to have a go at a Divine Realm expert. And you’re still standing here shamelessly saying those far-fetched things. If this ever leaks into the public, aren’t you afraid of being scoffed at?” Xuan Yi said, his eyes becoming icy cold.
