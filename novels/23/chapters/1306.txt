Chapter 1307: Omen!

“Boom!”

The two appalling powers in the center of the battlefield finally dissipated.

Everything in the world finally came back into peace.

But the crowd around the battlefield remained in a dead silence.

You could have heard a pin drop.

Almost everyone stood wide-eyed, filled with horror, and apparently they had not yet recovered from what they had seen.

When the crowd saw Qingyang Universe God swallow the scarlet elixir in the final battle, they thought that Jian Wushuang was sure to die. Even Scarlet Island Master intended to give him a hand, though it was too late. However, the situation totally subverted expectation.

Unexpectedly, Qingyang Universe God, who enhanced his power by taking advantage of elixirs, was instantly killed by Jian Wushuang.

Instantly, without an opportunity to resist.

“What on Earth kinds of tricks does he use?” Everyone kept staring at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

Now people had all witnessed how Jian Wushuang killed Qingyang Universe God.

They remained wide-eyed in horror while one person became outraged.

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

A roar resounded, full of anger and aggression. At that moment, an aged figure rushed out.

This frightening aged figure was apparently stronger than Jian Wushuang and Qingyang Universe god. He rushed toward Jian Wushuang, intending to kill him, but he was held back by another figure.

“Bastard!”

The aged figure was the Universe God of the Nine Oceans.

He shouted, bristling with rage.

“Universe God of the Nine Oceans, what the hell are you doing?”

It was Scarlet Island Master who stopped the Universe God of the Nine Oceans. The master, also with a murderous look, could easily suppress the Universe God of the Nine Oceans with his power.

Although Universe God of the Nine Oceans was one of the four masters in the Holy Prefecture, only the most powerful master there, not him, could contain the Scarlet Island Master. Universe God of the Nine Oceans, only a primary universe god in the Second Heaven, meant nothing to Scarlet Island Master.

“Universe God of the Nine Oceans, here is Dayu Palace and the palace master is also present. You should know how to behave yourself!” White Sector God from Dayu Palace also came out to control the situation.

Hearing the words, Universe God of Nine Oceans changed his attitude and respectfully said to Dayu Palace Master in the distance, “Your Majesty, my disciple Qingyang was killed by Jian Wushuang. Please help me call for the justice! ”

“Justice?” The Dayu Palace Master glanced at Universe God of Nine Oceans and sneered: “Don’t speak such a bared-faced lie!”

Universe God of Nine Oceans was surprised by the response he received. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Humph!”

“Death and injuries are inevitable in such a fierce battle. Moreover, it’s your disciple who asked for the battle and even took the elixirs in order to kill Jian Wushuang. So why shouldn’t Jian Wushuang kill him?” Dayu Palace Master said indifferently.

The crowd also cast a taunting glance at Universe God of Nine Oceans.

They witnessed everything and could judge the situation fairly.

Qingyang Jieshen shamelessly took the elixirs in the battle in order to kill Jian Wushuang, so it was fair that Jian Wushang killed him for self-defense.

After all, they weren’t fools.

The face of Universe God of Nine Oceans went pale. He knew that he and the Holy Prefecture should accept the facts, even though he was unwilling to do so.

Everyone was on the side of Jian Wushuang.

And here was Dayu Palace, with it’s master was present.

He could do nothing but contain his own anger.

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

Frustrated, he glanced at Jian Wushuang with his indifferent and murderous eyes.

But this time, he was shocked.

As was anyone else who looked at Jian Wushuang.

It was because they found that Jian Wushuang completely ignored Universe God of Nine Oceans despite the extreme anger and murderous look of the latter.

Instead, he was looking up at the heaven above him, with an unprecedentedly serious expression.

From the heavens came a low hum, accompanied by an annihilatory power!

All the crowd were shocked, with eyes wide open when they saw the scene.

“That, that is…”

“This annihilatiory power…”

“It is a God test!!!”

“Exactly, it’s a God test!”

“Oh my God!”

Everyone almost got shocked.

It was unbelievable that Jian Wushuang had immediately ushered in his important God test right after he had killed Qingyang Universe God through a hard battle.

“God test right after a fierce fight? What a coincidence!” Even Dayu Palace Master and Lord Wu Cang could hardly believe what they had seen and frowned.

Generally speaking, a cultivating practitioner could feel the coming of the God test a long time before its arrival and he could even predict the exact date because the suggestion was so clear and obvious.

But now, the God test of Jian Wushuang came suddenly without a sign.

If there had been one, Jian Wushuang would never have chosen to fight with Qingyang Universe God.

The heavens kept humming.

And the universe suddenly darkened. And in the heavens, large dark clouds gathered, in the depth of which violent forces were brewing.

Everyone could feel the horrible pressure of the dark clouds.

Suffocating.

“The pressure…”

Feeling the pressure, Dayu Palace Master and Lord Wu Cang realized something and their expression changed again.

“No, this is not a God test!” Dayu Palace Master said.

“You are right. The pressure is accumulating, there is no sign of it coming immediately!” Wu Cang added.

These two prestigious Universe Gods from the Third Heaven looked at each other, saying the same word.

“Omen!!”

Now even these two prominent figures expressed a hint of fear.

“Indeed, the Omen before the coming of the God test!” Dayu Palace Master took a deep breath and solemnly said: “All cultivating practitioners will embrace an Omen before the arrival of the God test, which serves as an indicator to practitioners”

“However, in the Eternal Chaotic World, the Omen came as a feeling to most of the practitioners.”

“But Jian Wushuang’s Omen formed into thunderclouds!”

“A thundercloud with such a horrible pressure!!”
