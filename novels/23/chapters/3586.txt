Chapter 3587: The First Expert Was at the Pinnacle of the Six Realm Translation

In the depths of Devil Smoke Valley.

“My young friend, I have reported the matter to Palace Master. He is very happy to know that you are still alive. At the same time, he also knows your current situation, so he has sent a message to his good friend to pick you up.” Axe One Master sent a message.

“Palace Master’s good friend?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Star Palace Master was a genuine Ruler expert, but his good friend was also a Ruler, right?

“Palace Master is not in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley, so it will take him some time to get here. So he asked you to go to Wuxin Lake first, and he will get there as soon as possible,” Axe One Master said.

“Wuxin Lake?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He immediately took out the star map and found the location of Wuxin Lake.

Wuxin Lake was still some distance away from his current location. At his speed, it would take him at least three to five years to get there.

“Tell him that I will get to Wuxin Lake as soon as possible,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, be careful,” Axe One Master said and then cut off the communication.

Then, Jian Wushuang immediately rushed toward the Wuxin Lake according to the directions on the star map.

However, because the journey was quite far, he would definitely meet other cultivators on the way.

Sure enough, after only five days of rushing toward the Wuxin Lake, he met a Principles Master at the pinnacle of the six realm.

The Principles Master noticed Jian Wushuang’s existence immediately, but he did not rush up to fight Jian Wushuang. Instead, he chose to follow Jian Wushuang from a distance, which made Jian Wushuang’s face slightly gloomy.

“Dragon Swan Master, if you’re really capable, you can come up and fight me. But you won’t fight, you won’t retreat, what do you want to do?” Jian Wushuang stared in the direction of Dragon Swan Master, his low voice had already spread out.

“Blood Sword Master, you go your own way, I’ll go mine. I’m not in your way, what do you care?” Dragon Swan Master replied, but in his heart, Dragon Swan Master sneered, “Humph, fight you head-on? I’m not stupid!”

Dragon Swan Master knew that Jian Wushuang had killed Gray Python Master.

Gray Python Master could be considered an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm. Although he was weaker than Gray Python Master, he was not much weaker. However, Blood Sword Master had killed Gray Python Master head-on, it was possible that Blood Sword Master would kill him head-on.

Therefore, he naturally did not dare to fight Jian Wushuang head-on.

However, as long as he did not face him head-on, he believed that Blood Sword Master would not be able to kill him by following him from a distance.

And that was indeed the case.

Although Jian Wushuang had the strength to easily kill Dragon Swan Master, his strength was 10 times that of an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm, which was given to him by the Blood Demon Cave Armor. However, he was not fast, compared to Dragon Swan Master, his speed was probably a little slower.

His speed was not as fast as dragon Swan Master, and Dragon Swan Master did not take the initiative to rush forward. He just followed him from afar and kept a distance from him. Of course, Jian Wushuang could not do anything about it.

“Although Dragon Swan Master can’t threaten me, he has been following me. He can spread my whereabouts at any time and let the experts who have their eyes on me swarm over...” Jian Wushuang’s expression was a little unsightly, but he soon calmed down.

“Forget it. Since I’m destined to be unable to hide my whereabouts, I’ll just do it openly. I’ll let everyone know my location and let the experts who have designs on me come looking for me. When the time comes, I’ll let everyone watch. I, Jian Wushuang, am not someone who can be easily targeted.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Jian Wushuang could not control Dragon Swan Master, and just as Jian Wushuang had expected, Dragon Swan Master followed him and told many people where Jian Wushuang was. After knowing Jian Wushuang’s location, the experts who had their eyes on him naturally swarmed over.

Time passed, and a month passed in the blink of an eye.

During this month, more and more Principles Masters came to Jian Wushuang’s side, but now there were dozens of them.

However, among the dozens of Principles Masters, the strongest was only at the pinnacle of the six realm. They all knew that Jian Wushuang had killed the Gray Python Master, so they did not dare to act rashly even when they saw him, the dozens of experts only followed behind Jian Wushuang and did not make a move.

They were waiting for more experts to arrive. Once they had a certain lineup, they would join hands to deal with Jian Wushuang.

Or, an expert at the pinnacle of the sixth realm would appear.

In the eyes of the experts from various forces, if Jian Wushuang could kill the Gray Python Master, his battle strength should have reached the pinnacle of the sixth realm, and if they wanted to snatch the opportunity from him…naturally, the experts at the peak of the six realms had to take action.

In the gray void, Jian Wushuang was still moving forward at a leisurely pace. His soul power had already spread out and he could see all the experts around him.

“There are more and more people coming, but these people alone are not enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

Among the experts, there were only six at the pinnacle of the six realm. The others had not even reached the pinnacle of the six realm. Even if they joined hands, he would not care.

At this moment...

In the distant void, a vague figure suddenly appeared.

At first, the figure was far away, but in just a moment, the figure had arrived in front of Jian Wushuang and blocked him.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, and he stopped walking and looked up at the person.

It was a short barefoot youth with a blood-red saber on his back. He had a pair of dark green eyes and looked extremely evil.

“Finally, a decent expert has arrived.”

Seeing the person, the corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth curled up slightly.

He knew that ordinary experts, even those at the pinnacle of the six realm, would not dare to stand in front of him directly, because he had shown that he could kill an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm directly.

However, this person dared to stand in front of him directly, which showed that he was absolutely confident in his strength. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang had recognized this person, so he naturally understood why this person was so confident.

“Blood Saber Emperor from the Unity Star World is a top expert who has lived for a very long time and reached the pinnacle of the six realm many years ago.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Although he knew his background, Jian Wushuang was still very relaxed.
