Chapter 2930: Forced Entry

——

“Eh?”

Just before Jian Wushuang arrived at the Scarlet Castle, he saw the white-haired Elder walk out of the castle in a sorry state.

The white-haired Elder’s face was obviously a little ugly.

The white-haired Elder naturally saw Jian Wushuang.

“Your excellency, are you here to visit Xue Dong King?” The white-haired Elder looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“If that’s the case, I advise you to leave first and come back soon,” the white-haired Elder said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang asked, puzzled.

“Xue Dong King is currently in a rage. It’s too risky to visit him at this time. With his way of doing things, if he doesn’t like you later, he might directly kill you,” the white-haired Elder said.

“Oh, there’s such a thing?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and then smiled. “Let’s try. If he wants to kill me, we have to see if he has the ability to do so.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang flew directly into the Scarlet Castle.

Seeing this, the white-haired Elder was stunned. “This man wants to break into the residence of the seventh young master? Is he courting death?”

Now, 99% of the experts in the Inkstone realm knew that Xue Dong King had become an immortal saint. His battle strength was probably even stronger than that of the four Realm Lords.

The techniques he had deployed in his castle were also very powerful. Even ordinary Immortal Saints would not dare to break into it, but Jian Wushuang…

From the moment he rushed out, his aura was revealed. He was obviously a Divine Master.

How dare a Divine Master barge into the castle where Xue Dong King lives?

The white-haired Elder thought that Jian Wushuang was tired of living.

But suddenly… boom!

A violent boom suddenly resounded in the void.

The white-haired Elder’s eyes immediately widened.

He saw that the layer of a red river surrounding the Scarlet Castle had wrapped the entire castle tightly.

But now, in the middle of the Scarlet River, a huge hole had appeared.

This hole was too big, and it was obvious that it had been forcefully blasted open by someone.

After this hole appeared, the entire Scarlet River collapsed.

“He, he actually broke through seventh young master’s defensive measures on the castle with a single strike?” The white-haired old man had a look of disbelief on his face.

At the same time, in the deepest part of the Scarlet Castle, Xue Dong King, who had not completely calmed down, also sensed the commotion outside and immediately raised his head.

“My first attack was actually defeated in a frontal attack without any warning. Was it defeated in one blow?” Xue Dong King’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he immediately rose up.

Jian Wushuang grinned as he looked at the collapsed Scarlet River.

“According to Evergreen Realm Lord, I don’t need to say anything to Xue Dong King. I just need to have absolute strength to convince him or make him acknowledge me. In that case, there’s no need for me to be so polite.”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked ahead. He could vaguely see layers of restrictive moves.

The one that had just been defeated was only the first layer of the Scarlet Castle, which was relatively weak. There were still three more layers of measures waiting for him.

Only after passing through all the remaining three layers of measures could he enter the center of the Scarlet Castle and see the King.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang immediately burst into speed and shot forward into the void.

In just a moment, Jian Wushuang encountered the second move of the Scarlet Castle.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang still threw out a brutal punch.

This punch contained a terrifying divine power as if it could break the world. It hit the first move of the restriction in front of him, which shook crazily and then collapsed in the next moment.

“The second move has also been broken, and it’s still just a single strike.” The white-haired Elder was even more shocked when he saw this.

However, Jian Wushuang continued to rush forward.

Soon, the third move appeared in front of him. It was also a great restriction.

However, the power of this restriction was obviously much stronger than the previous two. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Facing this restriction, Jian Wushuang no longer fought with his bare hands. Instead, he directly took out the Blood Mountain Sword.

Whoosh!

With a casual slash, he activated his boundless sword art, which was 33,000 feet tall. A huge sword light struck the restriction, and it was instantly cut open.

Then, Jian Wushuang encountered the fourth and final restriction.

Whoosh!

It was still a slash, but it was extremely sharp. With a mournful sword light, it forcefully cut open a gap in the restriction. Jian Wushuang passed through the gap and entered the center of the Scarlet Castle.

Outside the castle, the white-haired Elder was a little stunned.

“A Divine Master easily defeated the four restrictions placed on the castle by the seventh young master. Who is this Divine Master?” The white-haired Elder exclaimed.

In the void at the center of the Scarlet Castle, the figure of Xue Dong King floated there. His eyes flashed with a glimmer as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Divine Master?” Xue Dong King was shocked.

He had personally set up these four restrictions, so he knew how powerful they were.

Even an ordinary Immortal Saint like the four Realm Lords of the Inkstone Realm would not be able to break in so easily, let alone a Divine Master.

But this Divine Master had actually broken in.

“Even I, back when I was at the Divine Master realm, wouldn’t have such terrifying combat strength. This person…” The anger on Xue Dong King’s face had completely disappeared. What replaced it was excitement, a thick sense of excitement, at the same time, a shocking battle intent rose up.

Just as the Evergreen Realm Lord had said, this Xue Dong King was a battle maniac.

What he liked the most were fierce battles!

Especially when he fought with experts.

However, the Inkstone Realm was too small. The four known Realm Lords were only ordinary Immortal Saints. Before he had made the breakthrough, he was still in awe of them. But now… he did not care about their strength at all.

Therefore, even if the four Realm Lords came personally, they could not make him excited.

But now, Jian Wushuang’s appearance had aroused his long-lost fighting spirit, which was exceptionally strong!

“Who are you?” Xue Dong King asked excitedly.

“Jian Yuan.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “After all, this is your residence, so it’s not convenient for us to fight. How about we go to the nearby void?”

“Okay.” Xue Dong King nodded without hesitation and immediately went to the void next door with Jian Wushuang.
