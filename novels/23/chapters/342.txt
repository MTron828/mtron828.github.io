Chapter 343: Which Holy Master?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang listened carefully to Wine Master with a solemn face. He knew what Wine Master said was true.

The main reason he was able to kill the seven Saint Realm experts of Holy Emperor Palace alone was that he had used Road to the Underworld and Bridge of Helplessness to limit their abilities.

Without those skills, his battle strength was only about the same as Wine Master, if not weaker.

However, among the four Holy Masters of Holy Emperor Palace, even the weakest one, the Fourth Holy Master, was stronger than Wine Master.

“Third Bro, I have sent a message to my father asking him to protect you.” Wang Yuan said, “I have mentioned you many times. But you were not strong enough to draw his attention. Now things should be different.”

“You have shown your great talent by killing those seven Saint Realm experts on your own at such a young age, so Alchemy School will attach more importance to you. Besides, you and Holy Emperor Palace are deadly enemies. Keeping you alive benefits Alchemy School. So he should agree.”

Jian Wushuang took a look at Wang Yuan and nodded slightly.

“There will be a reply within a day or two. I only hope Holy Emperor Palace doesn’t come to kill you before then,” Wang Yuan said. He believed Alchemy School would step in to protect Jian Wushuang.

From what he knew of his father, he believed he was right.

They waited quietly at the contact place.

In the Alchemy School! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Among the lofty palaces, the Alchemy School’s Sect Master and several high-powered Elders gathered in the central palace, talking about whether they should step in to protect Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, such a young man, killed the seven Saint Realm experts of Holy Emperor Palace alone. Amazing.”

“Young master is lucky to have made such a friend in a weak Dynasty.”

“But such a genius doesn’t belong to the Alchemy School.”

The elders were expressing some amazement and wonder.

On the chair above, a middle-aged man with a mustache, wearing a purple robe, sat coldly. Looking carefully, he physically resembled Wang Yuan.

The fat middle-aged man was Wang Yuan’s father, the Alchemy School’s Sect Master, Wang Yan.

“He really is a genius.” Wang Yan marveled at it, but he secretly shook his head and then said, “Unfortunately, we can’t protect him.”

Hearing that, Elders in front of Wang Yan became silent.

It was true, they couldn’t.

If it were anyone else, Alchemy School would extend its hand.

But Jian Wushuang was a special case.

They had agreed that the Alchemy School would never stand between Holy Emperor Palace and Jian Wushuang. Never!

“Tell Wang Yuan, Alchemy School will not step in. Bring him some elixirs, that’s the only thing we can do...” Wang Yan sighed helplessly.

...

Holy Emperor Palace, an overlord of Nanyang, located on a large island.

There were mountains and rivers on the island, with many pavilions rising from the center of those mountains.

On the top floor of a pavilion, the Holy Emperor Palace Master and more than ten Elders had gathered. The current mood was very subdued because they had just received the news about the seven Saint Realm experts who had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

By Jian Wushuang alone.

“Seven. We only have so many in total, but we lost seven of them this time,” an Elder of the Holy Emperor Palace shouted sadly and angrily.

The other Elders also looked pale.

Saint Realm experts were the most important forces of a sect. That was true even for Holy Emperor Palace.

It was a big loss for Holy Emperor Palace.

“The dead are dead,” Holy Emperor Palace Master, Yi Tianming said in a deep voice, “What we should worry about is Jian Wushuang!”

Jian Wushuang!

The mere mention of his name made the Elders of Holy Emperor Palace narrow their eyes.

Only a year ago, Jian Wushuang had just been a boy that they paid little attention to. However, he had made incredible progress in one year.

He improved at such an amazing speed.

Most importantly, he was so young!

According to the information, Jian Wushuang was only 22 years old now!

A young man who was only 22 years old had killed seven of Holy Emperor Palace’s Saint Realm experts on his own. What did that mean?

“Elder Mo Yun left these words before he died.” Yi Tianming’s eyes were cold as he said, “If we don’t kill him now, he will bring a great disaster to us one day.”

“He is right!”

“Jian Wushuang is still young!”

“But he has improved at such a fast pace, way too fast!”

“He already has these achievements at such a young age, only 22 years old. In a few years, won’t he be able to easily destroy Holy Emperor Palace?”

“Kill him!”

“Send him to hell!”

The elders in the pavilion were all furious.

“I’m afraid we won’t be able to kill him ourselves, we will need to ask for help from the four Holy Masters,” an elder said.

“I will ask them immediately,” Yi Tianming said.

Yi Tianming and the elders quickly went to the foot of a giant mountain, where a cyan-clothed boy was waiting quietly.

Yi Tianming took out a piece of paper and a writing brush, then he wrote a letter and gave it to the cyan-clothed boy.

“Please wait a moment, Palace Master.” The cyan-clothed boy took the letter and walked along the road to the giant mountain.

Yi Tianming and the Elders waited while the Elders secretly discussed it.

“Who do you think they will send?”

“It should be Fourth Holy Master. He is strong enough to deal with Jian Wushuang.”

“Anyone of them can easily kill Jian Wushuang, but which one does it will depend on who isn’t busy at the moment.”

“Anyway, First Holy Master will not do it.”

“That’s for sure.”

“Shut up,” Yi Tianming shouted deeply. The Elders immediately closed their mouths.

At the same time, the cyan-clothed boy could be seen walking back. He came to Yi Tianming, bowed, and said, “Palace Master, Second Holy Master said he will be here in three days.”

“Second Holy Master?”

“It’s going to be Second Holy Master.”

Yi Tianming and the Elders were all shocked. Then they waited quietly for three days.

Three days later, a slender elder in a black robe arrived. He was the Second Holy Master!
