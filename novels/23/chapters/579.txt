“Are you sure?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the air with his sword in hand and a surging Sword Essence as his cold voice echoed throughout the area.

Upon hearing this, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s face darkened.

He had indeed looked down on Jian Wushuang before. But now he had to be more cautious as Jian Wushuang had proven his strength with a single move.

“Sword Emperor, I admit that I underestimated your strength just now.”

“Even though you’re merely in the Cloud Realm, you’re even stronger than the Temple Masters in your camp.”

“Since that’s the case, I’ll go all out to battle with you out of respect.”

As soon as he finished his words, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor suddenly shook his body. A vast aura immediately swept around and bright purple light surrounded him, gradually condensing into an Amethyst Armor made of ferocious scales that covered his body and hands.

He raised his right hand and clenched his fist. An explosive force burst out and his aura soared as well.

“I will attack now.”

The crowd of experts from the human camp held their breath as they watched.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was one of the three Monster Emperors, an overlord?among the monster population, and the supreme expert who was at the peak of the whole Ancient World. What was his real strength?

Could Jian Wushuang really battle with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor?

Unconsciously, these human experts had become excited and were full of expectations for this battle among experts at the peak.

“Go ahead. I hope you won’t disappoint me,” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

After entering the Nine-cloud Realm, his Spiritual Power, physical strength, and Origin power had been enhanced to a terrifying extent.

He was definitely qualified to battle with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor now.

He even had the possibility of winning.

Whoosh!

The crowd heard a sudden burst of air explode in the air, then they noticed that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor had already disappeared from where he was standing before.

They could only see a purple Flowing Light moving through the sky at an incredible speed.

The next moment, a strong wind with an incredibly suppressive force approached Jian Wushuang head-on, causing his eyes to narrow unconsciously.

Boom!

With a boom, the who area began to shake violently.

A ferocious palm covered with Amethyst Scales suddenly blasted through the space in front of Jian Wushuang while turning into a claw.

It had transformed into a beast claw, scratching towards Jian Wushuang fiercely.

It almost seemed to tear the space in front of him apart.

Swoosh... The air was split by this claw.

Jian Wushuang stood up in the sky with a smile on his face, sensing the incredible power of this claw. He swung the Heart-killing Sword lightly and then thrust out.

A gorgeous sword move.

The moment he swung the sword, the whole area became dark, just like the night sky.

The sword shadow became the only light in this night sky, making it extremely gorgeous.

But an overwhelming killing intent was hiding behind this gorgeous light.

The seventh move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique!

It was named “Star River”.

As soon as Jian Wushuang began to comprehend the Slaughter Dao, he also mastered more of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, moves which had been extremely enigmatic before.

He had mastered the fifth and the sith move.

He had also comprehended the seventh move, but it was too difficult for him to use at the time. However, after his breakthrough, it became much easier to use.

The crowd looked at the spot attentively. In the center of that area, the heaven-tearing claw landed directly on the gorgeous yet deadly sword shadow.

The collision did not create the violent explosion that everyone imagined. Instead, the crowd only heard a ridiculously loud impact and a squeezing sound. At the same time... Boom! Boom! Boom!

The after-shocks of the collision swept out in all directions, crushing the surrounding trees, flowers, and gravel into dust.

This time, the Demonic Beasts were smarter and retreated far away so that they would not be affected by the after-shocks.

In the core area of the battle, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor remained with a cold expression on his face, but a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. Whoosh! A purple Flowing Light burst out and appeared on the other side of Jian Wushuang.

“A competition of speed?”

With a faint smile, Jian Wushuang turned into a residual shadow.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The figures of Jian Wushuang and Crystal-armored Monster Emperor flashed through the sky while releasing mighty attacks each time, dazzling the human experts and Demonic Beasts that were watching them.

Violent explosions could be heard echoing throughout the area from time to time.

This matchless and fierce battle was being perfectly displayed in front of everyone.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and Crystal-armored Monster Emperor were fighting fiercely, competing in speed, offensive power, and even various reaction abilities.

But the two sides remained even after the fierce battle.

Neither of them was able to obtain an advantage over the other side.

The human experts were in a daze.

Even the Temple Masters were watching attentively with their eyes wide open.

“Too, too strong!”

“Even though I’m a Temple Master, I don’t think I would be able to compete with them.”

“No wonder Crystal-armored Monster Emperor is one of the three Monster Emperors. His strength is too terrifying.”

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor is indeed strong, but why is Sword Emperor also so strong?”

“How can Sword Emperor, a Cloud Realm expert, compete with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor?”

“Sword Emperor is able to fight Crystal-armored Monster Emperor to a draw... Monster, he is definitely a monster!”

They all sighed because it was so incredible.

Temple Master Iceberg, who hated Jian Wushuang, was also watching the battle. When he saw that Jian Wushuang had not lost after battling with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor for such a long period of time, an unprecedented shock emerged in his eyes.

“How is this possible?”

“It’s impossible!”

Temple Master Iceberg could not believe what he was seeing.

When those monster spies tried to assassinate Jian Wushuang, the Monster King had easily defeated Jian Wushuang and almost killed him.

That happened only a few days ago.

But now, Jian Wushuang was able to fight Crystal-armored Monster Emperor to a draw!

Wasn’t this level of improvement too horrifying?

”?It’s?true that he broke through from the Saint Realm to the Cloud Realm. However, even if he jumped directly to the Nine-cloud Realm, he would not be this strong!”Temple Master Iceberg stared at Jian Wushuang while the word “monster” struck him.
