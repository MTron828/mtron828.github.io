Chapter 1860: Level Eight

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Most of the experts at the scene knew about Dao soldiers.

In Ancient Mystery Land, there were some places with Dao soldiers. Although the Dao soldiers were strong in power and not much weaker than an Almighty, they only knew simple attacks. Hence, to the Almighties at the scene, they weren’t much of a threat. However, that was when there very few Dao soldiers.

Now there was a total of thirty Dao soldiers. Even if three teamed up could only match evenly with a Sir God, they had the fighting power of ten Sir Gods.

In addition to the four silver-armored Dao soldiers, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun, Lineage of Star’s fighting power at Sir God level weren’t much weaker than Abysmal Palace.

In actual fact, Jian Wushuang had a total of a hundred bronze-armored Dao soldiers but he only took out thirty of them.

If he were to take out all of his bronze-armored Dao soldiers, the experts from Abysmal Palace would show even more interesting expressions.

“Jian Wushuang, is this the final trickthat Lineage of Star has?” Palace Master Wu Luo’s gaze was cold as he stared at the thirty bronze-armored Dao soldiers but there wasn’t much changed on his face. It was only thirty bronze-armored Dao soldiers and it was still within the range of Abysmal Palace’s power.

“Final trick? Of course not.”

Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his lips and with his will power, the three Hong Jun Golden Swords suddenly appeared simultaneously and floated before him, “Palace Master Wu Luo, you should know that I am the best at the three golden swords. Today, I shall let them greet you.”

“The three golden swords? That’s funny,” Palace Master Wu Luo smiled in disdain.

He had watched the mirror image that showed Jian Wushuang’s fight with Fortress Master Hong Tian and the others in Deluge Fortress personally.

In that fight, Jian Wushuang’s three Hong Jun Golden Swords were really eye-catching. Any one of them contained a hit of a Peak Emperor God and it was terrifying fast speed.

When they exploded in full force, they posed a great threat to an ordinary Peak Emperor God.

However, he wasn’t worried about the three golden swords at all.

“You’ll know when you try,” Jian Wushuang smiled maliciously and there was a boundless spacetime power that suddenly swept out.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The three golden swords that floated in silence were affected by the space time power. They quivered and shot out ferociously.

They appeared in front of Palace Master Wu Luo like three bolts of lightning and they shot Palace Master Wu Luo’s chest one after another.

Palace Master Wu Luo, who looked disdainful earlier, his eyes suddenly dilated in shock.

“This speed!!!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Palace Master Wu Luo was shocked because the three golden lights were too fast.

The speed that it displayed was much faster than back then when Jian Wushuang had used it during the fight in Deluge Fortress.

With such terrifying speed, even Palace Master Wu Luo was surprised.

However, Palace Master Wu Luo who was on the twenty-fifth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list was also quiet in reponse. Just as the three golden lights burst out, he swung the hammer in his hands. The swing was as though it could break the sky directly. It contained terrifying power that could make all Emperor Gods feel hopeless.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three continuous hits and Palace Master Wu Luo fell back for tens of thousands of miles. He could also feel that his hands were numb.

“Level eight?” Palace Master Wu Luo stared at Jian Wushuang.

He could feel the spacetime power that was given out from the three golden swords and the spacetime power was terrifying. Only when one’s comprehension towards spacetime doctrine reached the eighth level could give play to such power.

Jian Wushuang, a Real God, his comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine had already reached the level eight in Doctrine Palace?”

“Level eight!!!”

“How is it possible??”

Many experts from Abysmal Palace couldn’t help but exclaim.

Level eight in Doctrine Palace?was the comprehension standard of an ordinary Emperor God.

One should know that when Jian Wushuang performed the three golden swords during the battle in Deluge Fortress, his comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine was only at the seventh level in Doctrine Palace and it wasn’t even at the peak of the seventh level. However, with this fierce power and ferocity of Hong Jun Golden Sword, he could match evenly with a Peak Emperor God.

Then, it had only been over two thousand years since the fight but Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine had heightened so massively.

“Impossible. No matter how talented he is, no matter how ridiculously strong he was, without the assistance of opportunities, it is impossible that his comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine could improve so tremendously in two thousand years. Unless he has been hiding his true power since the beginning!” Palace Master Wu Luo stared and his voice became extremely cold, “Jian Wushuang, you have been hiding?”

“You only found out now?” Jian Wushuang smirked coldly.

Just as Palace Master Wu Luo had said, without the assistance of opportunities but merely relied on his personal comprehension, he wouldn’t achieve such massive improvement in comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine in two thousand years time. The reason why the power he had displayed then was different from the fight with Deluge Fortress before was that…

Jian Wushuang had never revealed his true power!

In the six thousand years he had wandered in the ancient battlefield near Green Fire World, he had received many opportunities. Among them, the biggest opportunity was a miniature cave dwelling.

He had comprehended in the miniature cave dwelling for one thousand and two hundred years. His comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine had improved at an unprecedented rate.

His comprehension was originally at the peak of level six in Doctrine Palace. However, after he had comprehended in the miniature cave dwelling, not only did his comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine break through to the level seven in Doctrine Palace, he continued to improve and possess the power to the level eight in Doctrine Palace.

Level eight was the comprehension standard of an ordinary Emperor God.

On top of that, his power and strength were twice as strong as Emperor God, the Hong Jun Golden Swords were scary, and also Jian Wushuang’s fighting power… he was far beyond anyone’s imagination!!

“Palace Master Wu Luo, you should be glad that, you are the first who gets to see my peak fighting power all these years. Today, I’ll use the blood of the experts from Abysmal Palace to serve as a deterrent to everyone,” Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated in the universe slowly.

“Arrogant!” Palace Master Wu Luo humphed coldly.

“If I am arrogant or not, you shall watch.”

Jian Wushuang spoke coldly and a bolt of spacetime power swept out. The three Hong Jun Golden Sword instantly turned into golden lightning.

Then, the three Hong Jun Golden?Swords attacked Palace Master Wu Luo, Emperor God Dan Tu, and Emperor God Luo Xian respectively from all three different directions.

It exploded its top speed then Emperor God Dan Tu and Emperor God Luo Xian stared.

“Sh*t,” Palace Master Wu Luo’s face grew grave.

Although Jian Wushuang’s power was far stronger than they had imagined, he was confident that he could match with him and he could withstand the three golden swords.

He could withstand but it didn’t mean that Emperor God Dan Tua and Emperor God Luo Xian could.
