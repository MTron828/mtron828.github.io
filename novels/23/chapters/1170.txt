When his words were finished, he did not give Ape Holy Master any chance to resist. With a flick of his hand, a great palace fell on Ape Holy Master.

Ape Holy Master looked helpless and he did not want to resist.

He knew very well that since Void Temple Master struck, his resistance would be futile, and if Void Temple Master did not kill him, he was being merciful.

“Blood Tusk, goddamn Blood Tusk! Why did you send messages to me?”

Ape Holy Master cursed in his heart. In the end, he was suppressed by the great palace.

During the following years, until the Jin Kingdom knew Jian Wushuang’s survival, Ape Holy Master had to live in the palace.

After suppressing Ape Holy Master, Void Temple Master once again disappeared.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang learned the news that Dao Master Blood Tusk was killed, and Ape Holy Master was suppressed by Void Temple Master.

“Oh, poor Ape Holy Master. He did not do anything, but still became imprisoned just because I am still alive.” Jian Wushuang stood at the top of an attic, contemplating.

At this time, Lin Lan came in.

“Master.” Lin Lan directly crouched in front of Jian Wushuang and bowed respectfully.

“Get up.” Jian Wushaung waved and a strength lifted Lin Lan up.

“You’ve really grown in the last 2,000 years, you actually became Queen Lanyue.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“It’s all because of you, my master.” Lin Lan respectfully said.

When Jian Wushuang left the Ancient World, he granted her a lot of swordsmanships,manuals, and treasures. In the end, she reached the Peak by them.

“I did give you some things at the beginning, but you’ve achieved this all by yourself.” Jian Wushuang waved. “In addition, your strength is really rare in this Ancient World, but if you put it in the Eternal World, it’s nothing.”

“In the end, the Ancient World is still too small, too small!”

“In a few days, I will return to the Eternal World. If you are willing to, I will take you there.” Jian Wushuang looked into Lin Lan’s eyes.

“I’m willing to.” Lin Lan was pleasantly surprised.

“That’s good, I will give you ten days to let you deal with affairs of Wushuang Sword Pavilion and the Ancient World. Ten days later, we’ll set off.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Lin Lan heavily nodded and went to arrange affairs of Wushaung Sword Pavilion.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang got to travel around the Divine Land.

It had been 2,000 years, things had changed. On Divine Land today, he could hardly find an acquaintance. Naturally, there was no one for him to visit. He just visited some places he used to be familiar with.

Ten days passed quickly.

In these ten days, Lin Lan disbanded Wushuang Sword Pavilion.

After all, she built Wushuang Sword Pavilion. The fight with Spirit Palace inflicted great damage on them. If she left, the pavilion would soon be dismembered by other sects and forces.

In this case, she simply disbanded Wushuang Sword Pavilion and distributed all the treasures that she had accumulated, so that the disciples could have their own way out in the future.

“Alright, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang single-handly stroke to break the Void and then took Lin Lan into the Green Fire World.

When he returned to Green Fire World again, Jian Wushuang took Lin Lan to Ancient Sect and visited Xuan Yi.

“Master, this is the disciple I received in the Ancient World more than 2,000 years ago. Her name is Lin Lan. I want to accommodate her here, and I hope that you can take care of her.” said Jian Wushuang.

“Your disciple? Isn’t that my disciple’s disciple?” Xuan Yi smiled gently and looked at Lin Lan.

“Lin Lan, greet your grandmaster.” Lin Lan respectfully said.

“Well, her talent and protentional seem pretty good. It’s a shame that there wasn’t a suitable platform in the Ancient World, but it is different in the Eternal World. You can rest assured, I’ll take care of this little girl. Soon the Firmament Territory Feast will be held again, I’ll bring her.” Xuan Yi said.

“Thank you, my master.” Jian Wushuang replied.

Having accommodated Lin Lan, Jian Wushuang bid farewell to Xuan Yi and then left the Firmament Territory again.

Having visited the Ancient World, Jian Wushuang went to the Stellar Fog Sea.

The Stellar Fog Sea on Void Continent had long been a mystery. Not even the many experts in Green Fire Palace, including the five Palace Masters, knew what was in the Stellar Fog Sea.

But Jian Wushuang knew very clearly.

The Stellar Fog Sea was actually a place for the Star Bloodline to choose disciples.

Through the space wormhole of the Void Temple, Jian Wushuang quickly arrived at the edge of the Stellar Fog Sea. He did not hesitate and directly entered it.

He saw vast gray fog, which not only blocked one’s view, but also stopped snooping from others.

But Jian Wushuang’s Strength of Soul had not been hindered.

Jian Wushuang had been a disciple of the Star Bloodline. As soon as he entered the Stellar Fog Sea, Lord Spirit Sound on Star Island noticed him.

Different from other Green Fire World Dao Masters who would be blocked outside, Jian Wushuang was not hindered and directly entered deep into the Stellar Fog Sea.

It didn’t take long for him to approach the central Star Island of the Stellar Fog Sea.

On Star Island, there were still a lot of Warriors.

Friends like Ling Long, Qian Yu, Zi Dong, and Dao Master Kong Ming who had an agreement with Jian Wushuang, stayed there as well.

Swoosh!

When Jian Wushuang appeared on Star Island and his aura came out, the broad Star Island suddenly shook.

“A Dao Master aura?”

“Did someone on the Star Island break through to the Dao Master level?”

“No, although there are many people on the Star Island who are able to break through, they all suppress themselves. No one is willing to do it.”

“It should be a newcomer, a new Dao Master.”

A group of people rushed, including the five Dao Masters standing on the top of the Star Island. They were all alarmed and rushed over.

When they stopped in front of Jian Wushuang saw his face, they immediately recognized him.

“It’s Blood Mountain!”

“Is the Blood Mountain that left the island more than 1,000 years ago?”

“He actually came back?”
