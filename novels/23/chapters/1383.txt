Chapter 1384: Examination!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack was the manipulation method of Soul Power.

The method was segregated into four levels: beginner, initial success, great achievement, completely satisfactory.

After Jian Wushuang obtained the method, he simply made the method known and came to wander around Tian Ling Mystery Land. At first, he was really unfamiliar with the method and he couldn’t put the power of the method to full play. It would even weaken his Soul Attack when he performed the method. So, he might as well not put the method to play.

However, in the thirty years that he stayed in the Soul Master Hall in White Sun Town, he had been fighting with the other Soul Masters and learned from one another. From continuous practice of the method, he had mastered the method better and better. At that point, he was finally at the beginner stage of the method.

Although he was just a beginner, his Soul Attack had improved tremendously, especially regarding his method of attack…

Previously, it was monotonous and it was purely killing off souls. Now, there were many ways of Soul Attack.

“The current me, merely relying on Soul Power, should be able to fight face-to-face with an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven, and the possibility of winning is not low!”

“I am just a beginner. If I were to train myself to the great achievement stage…”

“I must continue to familiarize myself with the method and improve myself to the great achievement stage before the battle to fight for my position as a disciple of Star Palace!”

Jian Wushuang held his fists tight.

“My friend, Wushuang,”

The voice came in from outside the secret room.

Jian Wushuang changed his expression and he immediately appeared outside the secret room.

“Soul Master He,” Jian Wushuang revealed a smile and looked at Soul Master He before him.

“My friend, the people from the headquarters of Soul Master Hall has arrived,” Soul Master He said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows.

A month earlier, Soul Master He noticed Jian Wushuang’s improvement in the method of using consciousness. He was barely reaching the requirement of a three-starred Soul Master. Hence, Soul Master He sent a message to the headquarters of Soul Master Hall and told them to send an expert over for Jian Wushuang to sit for the examination for recognition as three-starred Soul Master.

Under the guidance of Soul Master He, Jian Wushuang came to the lobby of Soul Master Hall.

In the middle of the lobby, there were two figures. The two of them looked rather cold and the surrounding Soul Masters looked at them occasionally with faces of terror.

“Three-starred Soul Master?” Jian Wushuang contracted his pupils.

He already saw that the two of them were wearing robes with arm-bands that represented their identity as three-starred Soul Masters.

“My friend, Wushuang, let me introduce you. These two are Master Feng Tao and Master Huo Yi from the headquarters,” Soul Master He said.

“Greetings,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely.

“You are Jian Wushuang?”

Feng Tao and Huo Yi looked at Jian Wushuang. As for Soul Master He, they totally ignored him.

“Let’s save the courtesy and go straight for the examination,” the man in a flame red robe, Feng Tao said.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Feng Tao waved and took out a transparent crystal.

“This is a crystal especially for examining the consciousness strength of a three-starred Soul Master. You give it a try,” Feng Tao passed the crystal to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it over. Then, he surged tremendous Soul Power into the crystal without hesitation.

Along with the surge of Soul Power, the transparent crystal immediately gave out a brilliant dark purple light.

“Dark purple?”

Feng Tao and Huo Yi were both surprised.

Under a normal situation, as long as one could let the crystal give out purple light meant that he reached the level of consciousness strength of a three-starred Soul Master. As for dark purple, it should be a Peak three-starred Soul Master’s level. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Peak three-starred Soul Master?”

Feng Tao and Huo Yi looked at Jian Wushuang with a different gaze.

After all, although they were three-starred Soul Masters, they were merely beginner level. They were far from a Peak three-starred Soul Master.

Jian Wushuang was surprised himself.

After all, his consciousness strength was actually only like an advanced three-starred that was very close to peak level but yet to reach Peak three-starred. The reason why the crystal gave out dark purple brilliance was that Jian Wushuang’s consciousness had already transformed into Soul Power.

“There shouldn’t be any problem, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course there’s no problem,” Feng Tao and Huo Yi immediately responded. Feng Tao replied humbly, “Your consciousness strength has reached the level of a Peak three-starred Soul Master. Theoretically, you could become a three-starred Soul Master directly. However, according to the rules, you are required to show your manipulation method.”

“How should I show it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Very simple. Both of us will use a normal three-starred Soul Master’s consciousness strength to fight against each other. Then, Huo Yi and I will judge if you can become a three-starred Soul Master,” Feng Tao explained.

“That simple?” Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows, “Let’s start then.”

“Let us go somewhere spacious,” Feng Tao said.

They immediately moved to the outside of Soul Master Hall, which was a boundless training field.

“Be careful!”

Feng Tao warned, then he spread his fierce consciousness the very next moment.

Vroom!!!

A humongous object that was formed by consciousness suddenly appeared in the universe.

It was a green giant that was more than ten meters tall. He was holding a mace in his hand.

“With mere consciousness, he formed such a huge green giant? A three-starred Soul Master is different after all,” Jian Wushuang complimented.

Bang!

The green giant stomped his foot and the ground cracked and shattered while his figure turned into a huge green shadow and appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Wow!

There was a surge of green light. The mace in the green giant’s hand descended with a strong force.

Looking at the mace slamming down, Jian Wushuang didn’t move an inch but there was boundless Soul Power that surrounded him.

“Moo!”

An ancient and deep bellow reverberated. The Soul Power surrounding Jian Wushuang soared up and formed a huge black tortoise. The black tortoise wrapped around Jian Wushuang and the extremely solid shell blocked the mace.

Bang!

A loud bang formed a terrifying breeze and swept over the area. The cultivators who were near to the battleground were swept by the strong breeze.

The terrifying power was far stronger than the two three-starred Divine Generals’ close combat.

Although Soul Masters majored in consciousness, the items that derived from consciousness could explode in close combat with warriors and were similarly fierce.

For instance, the green giant that was transformed from Feng Tao’s consciousness, the wielded mace could be compared favorably with an advance Universe God in the Third Heaven.

After a heavy collision, the green giant let out a loud groan and he started waving the mace in his hand.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Every one of the continuous hits were heavy and forceful. The power hit the black tortoise shell and the shell grew much dimmer but had yet to shatter.
