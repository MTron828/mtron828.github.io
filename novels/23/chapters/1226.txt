Chapter 1227: The Turning Tide!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Flame Deity Puppet was holding off the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom.

Whereas Jiu Xi was busy evading from the pursuits of Fu Yi.

The path was clear; there was no one else between Jian Wushuang with his companions and the gargantuan black and white vortex.

In only fractions of a second, Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies, Jian Nantian and the Sunrise Sword Emperor reached their designated positions.

“My Original Bodies are ready. How are you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I am in position!” Jian Nantian replied.

“So am I.” The Sunrise Sword Emperor nodded as well.

“Very well. Let’s begin.” Jian Wushuang notified his companions. Four jets energies shot into the sky; the Sword Essences released by the four figures, streaking through the air towards the eye of the spinning vortex.

Jiu Xi flitted back and forth through the rapid flows of energies as she evaded from the rampaging Fu Yi. But she instantly took notice of the four streaking Sword Essences tearing through the sky.

“Ah?” A squinch of a doubt was evident upon her face as she felt a foreboding dread.

“The positions of the four seemed unusual…”

From the trails of the Sword Essences, Jiu Xi could clearly sense the positions of the four people, knowing that they must be part of an intricate design.

“The four positions represent the most vital points of the Grand Formation. These four points connect the backbone of the entire Formation which leads to the eye of the vortex which is also the heart of the Grand Formation. How is it possible that they have found these four positions?” Jiu Xi’s expression began to turn ugly.

She had been basking in her hubris-soaked confidence, trusting fully that none from the Green Fire World would never be able to adequately read the Grand Formation and point out its secrets.

But now…

However, realizing that her enemies might have discovered her secret, Jiu Xi began to feel fear and desperation creeping into her.

At the same time, she began to realize the motives of Jian Wushuang and his companions as they launched their attacks.

“Is that a battle formation they are using? One which consolidates their attacks and concentrates their power?” She could hardly believe what she saw, the stabbing feeling of fear reaching its climax.

“They have completely seen through the secrets of the Grand Formation and they intend to destroy it by using a Sword Formation to focus their attacks upon its eye!”

She searched frantically for answers to the enemies’ gambit that now threatened her plans. She cast a swift look at the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom who was still far away, intending to reach out for his help.

But she immediately found that the Monarch was being held in a fierce battle against the Flame Deity Puppet. Not only the Monarch could not come to her help, but he himself was also in danger of losing in battle!

“Damn it!”

“How is it possible that somebody from the Green Fire World is able to find the weaknesses of my Grand Formation!”

“Who! Who is it?”

Jiu Xi growled frantically. Jian Wushuang and his companions were already channeling their powers together as one.

The Enduring Samsara Formation would be able to bring out its greatest potential and deal a fatal stroke to the Grand Formation once their stroke fell.

“This cannot continue! I will lose the rewards promised to me by Lord Jin Feng if the Grand Formation fails!”

Knowing full well that her earlier efforts could well sink or swim, Jiu Xi’s look turned dark as she realized she must strike quickly and hard. She turned and moved, heading towards the direction of the Sunrise Sword Emperor.

Despite being hardly skillful in martial techniques, she was armed to the teeth with various means for unconventional combat and movement techniques, allowing to her to dart and swoop deftly away from Fu Yi who was rapidly losing her.

Swiftly, Jiu Xi bore down on the Sword Emperor with Fu Yi far behind.

By now, the four were already in the final phase of their attack.

But Jiu Xi appeared suddenly behind the Sunrise Sword Emperor. Her figure had barely materialized when she crushed a mysterious token she held in her hand.

The token crumbled into pieces… and?“Boom!?” A deafening and terrible explosion erupted!

An overwhelming force surged in that very instant as three golden dragons appeared behind the Sunrise Sword Emperor. The slithery dragons intertwined together, fusing into a bolt of golden flash that struck and hit the Sunrise Sword Emperor!

“What?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The Sword Emperor’s eyes opened wide in disbelief. He had noticed Jiu Xi creeping near him. But being in the most critical phase of their attack, he had chosen to endure whatever attacks that Jiu Xi would unleash at him, believing that the woman’s blow would hardly be able to endanger him.

With the complement of his protective raiments and treasures, he had chosen to weather the enemy’s attack in order to maintain his hold on their offense!

The Sword Emperor, as a powerful warrior himself, would at most suffer severe injuries. He had not expected that Jiu Xi’s powers would be able to kill him.

Only never did he expect that Jiu Xi had used a magical token she had in her keeping.

Worst still, the powers contained within the magical token was stronger even than a blow by the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom himself!

The golden projectile hit him squarely without him being able to react. The blow struck a hole in his chest, crushing his heart as his life began to ebb away.

“I-I, I…”

Frozen in his stance, the Sword Emperor uttered a few incomprehensible mumbles. His gaze became blank and distant as he began to lose consciousness, his aura plummeting into nothingness.

He began to lose control of his body, beginning to fall. A look of calm and serenity crept into his eyes as if he was released from long years of toil and torment.

With his final ounce of strength, he left his final words to his comrades – Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian and the host of warriors who had been watching intently from the Battle Fortress.

“I’m sorry!”

It was merely two words, yet these were two words that bore a saddening weight of pain and anguish.

The Sunrise Sword Emperor breathed his last as his eyes blinked shut finally. With life left from his body, his corpse was drawn into the vortex and subsequently devoured!

The final moments of his life were witnessed by Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian as well as the warriors within the Battle Fortress.

None of them could barely move.

They have painfully witnessed, with their own eyes, how he was killed by the golden flash of light that penetrated his body like needle passing through a cloth; and they have watched, with excruciating agony how he was being swallowed into the vortex when he had finally passed.

Rage and fury came swiftly like lightning!

“Sword Emperor!”

“Sunrise Sword Emperor!”

“Unforgivable!”

Screams of anger and rage thundered from within the fastness of the Battle Fortress.

“NOOO!!!”

Not far away, the Original Bodies of Jian Wushuang jointly released a booming roar that illustrated both his grief and wrath!

The Sunrise Sword Emperor!

The most glimmering beacon of hope of the Green Fire World before the emergence of Jian Wushuang!

The undisputable Sword Cultivator of the highest order and the greatest prodigy in combat skills ever known!

Being an ordinary practitioner of martial skills and a Holy Master, these odds had never stopped him from cultivating and fusing his two Strongest Sword Principle as one to harness powers comparable to that of a Universe Master!

He was the third behind Jian Wushuang and Ji Wumeng who had been pegged as future chieftains of the Green Fire Palace; prodigious talents who could one day stand eye-to-eye against the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom.

Blessed with unique talents and shouldering the hopes of many, he would long have embarked upon a pilgrimage into the Eternal Chaotic World to try reaching for greater heights if not for the strifes which have plagued the Green Fire World.

And now, in order to destroy the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara for the good of the entire Green Fire World, the Sunrise Sword Emperor had breathed his last, only because he had chosen to sustain the synchrony for the Sword Formation to function…

And now, right under the eyes of the horde of warriors of the Green Fire, he had fallen with utter ignominy!
