Chapter 1255: Invincible Universe Master

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After Jian Wushuang read the information on the monarch of the Gold Kingdom, his expression became very strange.

“God, it turns out that I not only provoked the Holy Prefecture, but also provoked Golden-sun Sect. It is rumored that the monarch of the Gold Kingdom is the younger brother of the Lord of Golden-sun Sect. Even if the rumor is false, it means that they have a good relationship. If the Lord of Golden-sun Sect knows that I killed the monarch of the Gold Kingdom, he will definitely try to kill me,” Jian Wushuang sighed anxiously.

He had killed the monarch of the Gold Kingdom in the Green Fire World, where there were Formations isolating them from the outside world. Before the monarch died, he could never pass on the message of who killed him, so as long as Jian Wushuang keep that confidential, the Golden-sun Sect would not know.

“Although the chances are small, I’d better watch out for the Golden-sun Sect,” Jian Wushuang reminded himself.

“The best way to build a firm foothold in the Dayu World is to join a big force. The Dayu Palace is highly regarded, and life will be too easy and comfortable if I join it, which isn’t what I want,”?he secretly reflected.

“The Three Hegemons often fight against each other, and occasionally even wars will break out. They are worthy of me to join. However, in the Three Hegemons, Holy Prefecture and Golden-sun Sect both have grudges with me, so I could only join the last hegemon, the Scarlet Island!”

The Scarlet Island was also one of the hegemons in the Dayu World, and its overall strength was no worse than that of the Golden-sun Sect. In the past few years, within the Dayu World, Scarlet Island and the Golden-sun Sect were constantly embroiled in the fiercest battles.

“You, come here,” Jian Wushuang waved at a tavern attendant not far away.

“What can I do for you, Your Excellency?” the attendant came to him and asked respectfully.

“Is there any way for me to join the Scarlet Island?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Join the Scarlet Island?” the attendant smiled, “Your Excellency, the Three Hegemons in the Dayu World have been fighting all year round, and a great number of experts have died. Naturally, they need a lot of experts to supplement the loss, so it’s not hard to join them. Strong Celestial Masters can join easily. As for Universe Masters, it’s much easier.”

“However, if you want to master certain powers in the Three Hegemons, the threshold will be higher. With your strength, it is easy for you to join the Scarlet Island, Your Excellency,” the attendant added and smiled.

He had already found that Jian Wushuang was a Universe Master. That was why he acted with great respect.

“Oh, I see,” Jian Wushuang replied with an arched brow.

“It’s much easier to join the Scarlet Island, because the city where you are now is within the control of the Scarlet Island, and there is a recruitment office for the Scarlet Island in this city,” the attendant said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang laughed, took out a Interspatial Ring, and said, “Take me to the recruitment office, and then the Chaos Gems in this Interspatial Ring is yours.”

The attendant cast a fleeting glance at the Interspatial Ring and saw 20 Chaos Gems inside the Interspatial Ring. With a hint of joy in his eyes, he took the ring and deferentially said, “Your Excellency, please come with me.”

Afterwards, Jian Wushuang paid the money and followed the attendant to the center of the city. There was indeed a recruitment office for the Scarlet Island.

There was a sea of people in the recruitment office, forming two long queues. Obviously, there were a great deal of people who wanted to join the Scarlet Island.

“Your Excellency, the two lines are for the recruitment of Celestial Masters and Universe Masters respectively. Look, the longer line is for Celestial Masters, and the other is for Universe Masters. Your Excellency, you can go to the line with fewer people,” the attendant explained.

“Okay, thank you. You may leave now,” Jian Wushuang said and waved to the attendant.

“Excuse me,” the attendant bowed and took his leave.

Then, Jian Wushuang went to the line for Universe Masters.

When lining up, he found that the way to recruit cultivators was simple: after briefly judging the applicant’s strength, the recruiter would give the applicant a token, and the recruitment was over. Then, the applicant who got the token went to the place where he or she was arranged.

Those Universe Masters applicants were absolutely overlords in the Eternal World, but they were extremely humble in this recruitment office without putting on airs.

It was not long before Jian Wushuang’s turn came.

“Tell me your name and strength.”

A white-haired elder who was in charge of handing out tokens took a glance at him.

At the first sight of Jian Wushuang, he found that Jian Wushuang’s aura was much stronger than other Universe Masters’, but he did not care.

Over the years of recruiting, he had met countless Universe Masters, many of whom were more powerful than Jian Wushuang was.

“Is there any way for me to join the Scarlet Island?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well, the Scarlet Island has always valued strength. That is to say, the stronger you are, the higher your position will be. and the higher your status will be on the Scarlet Island,” the white-haired elder explained in a deep voice.

“Oh, I see.” Jian Wushuang smiled and pondered for a second before saying, “I am an Invincible Universe Master.”

“Invincible Universe… ” the white-haired elder murmured, but he suddenly paused and looked up at Jian Wushuang aghast before finishing his words.

Instantly, everyone behind him and in the other line stared in Jian Wushuang’s direction.

They all heard Jian Wushuang say “Invincible Universe Master”. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“What, what did you say?” the white-haired elder asked in amazement, “You are an Invincible Universe Master? Are you sure?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned eccentric at his question.

In terms of battle strength, he was equal to a Universe God at the First Heaven. However, he had just come to the Eternal Chaotic World, and he did not want to be too ostentatious. That was why he said he was an Invincible Universe Master, but he did not expect such a reaction from the white-haired elder and those around him.

He did not know that there were plenty of Universe Masters in the Dayu World.

If he had told the elder that he was a Universe Master at the peak, the elder would not have been so startled, because the Universe Master at the peak was not rare in the Dayu World, but the Invincible Universe Master was different.

Within the entire Dayu World, Invincible Universe Masters were very rare, even rarer than the Universe God.

That was because the Invincible Universe Master had to create unique skills, and if a Universe Master could create unique skills, he was definitely a real genius.

Even the local tyrant Dayu Palace and the Three Hegemons took such geniuses seriously!
