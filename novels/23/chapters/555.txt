Chapter 556: Perfect Slaughter Dao

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the battlefield, Emperor Golden Snake died and his body fell to the ground.

Jian Wushuang walked to Emperor Golden Snake’s corpse, taking away his black scimitar and Interspatial Ring.

After doing that, he looked around.

Outside the battlefield, the onlookers were silent.

But their emotions were in turmoil.

No one had thought that Jian Wushuang would survive the Life-death Duel.

But it turned out...

Jian Wushuang was alive and Emperor Golden Snake was dead.

A Divine Emperor had been killed by a Saint Realm.

Shock, bewilderment!

They struggled to calm their thoughts.

In the void where Divine Emperors had gathered, the sovereigns were also shocked. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They had been surprised to see Emperor Golden Snake show his real strength, his comprehension of Phantom Saber Principle and Triple Phantom Saber Moves.

They knew that Emperor Golden Snake’s real strength was remarkable, even though he was slightly weaker than superior emperors.

Emperor Golden Snake’s reveal of the true extent of his skills meant that he was nearly as strong as superior emperors. Among the 108 Divine Emperors of Monster-exterminating League, only Emperor Fengxiao and a few others were stronger than him.

There had been no doubt that he would prevail in the battle.

But no one had expected that Jian Wushuang to kill Emperor Golden Snake.

The terrible sword move which had split the Restriction after killing Emperor Golden Snake still held them in shock and awe.

That sword move had been too terrifying!

No Divine Emperor present dared to say that they would be able to fend it off without being wounded.

“If I tried my best, I would have to slash twice to split the Restriction. But Jian Wushuang did it with one sword move, which had been weakened by killing Emperor Golden Snake, He makes me feel a bit diminished by comparison.” Emperor Fengxiao said, eyes sparkling.

He had thought highly of Jian Wushuang and had hoped that he would survive. Luckily, Jian Wushuang’s performance in the Life-death Duel exceeded his expectations.

“If I’m right, Jian Wushuang made a breakthrough. That is... Dao! That’s why there was a tremendous increase in his strength.” Emperor Xiying said seriously, “He entered Dao.”

“It is. Besides, it is perfect, pure and different from our Dao which is built on Sword Principle and Saber Principle.” Emperor Fengxiao nodded heavily.

“Perfect Dao!”

Divine Emperors marveled Jian Wushuang’s accomplishment and looked at him in admiration.

Nine Temple Masters stood at the top high void,

All of them were shocked.

“Slaughter Dao, perfect Slaughter Dao!”

“Good, a Saint Realm evolved perfect Slaughter Dao from Origin without the help of Sword Principle, Jian Wushuang...”

“An exceptional genius!” Temple Master Pure Moon praised. “Perfect and pure Origin Dao, it is stronger than our Dao which built on Weapon Dao. Among us, only Wushan’s Earth Dao is on par with his.”

They looked at a burly man with a Giant Axe on his back, who had previously defended Jian Wushuang against an injustice.

The burly man smiled, “Though Earth Dao is perfect and pure, it is a defensive Dao. Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Dao is the strongest in Origin Dao. Therefore, he is far stronger than me in offensive power.”

Different Dao had different power.

Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Dao was far more powerful than the burly man’s Earth Dao in offensive power.

“Before Jian Wushuang comprehended Dao, his battle strength was on par with a normal Divine Emperor. Now, his strength has increased so much that he is definitely as strong as a superior emperor. In terms of offensive power, it is possible that no one in Monster-exterminating League is better than him.” Temple Master Pure Moon said.

Those present nodded in agreement.

They had seen how Jian Wushuang had killed Emperor Golden Snake. That power was amazing.

“Iceberg, you did so much to set up the duel. You gained nothing. On the contrary, you suffered a double loss.” Temple Master Pure Moon looked at Temple Master Iceberg who appeared stunned.

Temple Master Iceberg’s countenance was an accurate reflection of his thoughts.

He was stunned not by Emperor Golden Snake’s death, but by the message Emperor Golden Snake had given him.

The message had been sent to him.

“A compass?”

“Golden Snake had a compass? It’s a treasure that concerns the Ancient World Token?”

Temple Master Iceberg was mulling over Emperor Golden Snake’s message.

If you want to get Ancient World Token, the compass is the key!

“He had never told me about it before!”

“Luckily, it’s not too late!”

Temple Master Iceberg narrowed his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, Temple Master Pure Moon made a move and appeared on the battlefield.

“The Life-death Duel is over. Jian Wushuang, follow me.” Temple Master Pure Moon’s voice resounded through the area.

Jian Wushuang nodded, followed Temple Master Pure Moon and left.

The experts in the Bloodshed Valley began to depart as they continued to discuss the duel.

It was over.

The Life-death Duel which had attracted so many experts to watch had finally ended.

The result was beyond everyone’s expectations.

Jian Wushuang was alive and Emperor Golden Snake was dead.

A Saint Realm had killed a Divine Emperor in a head-on fight!

The ‘amazing’ story spread rapidly from the Holy Place to Eight Cities and to every tribe and corner of the Monster Continent.

Within a day, Jian Wushuang had become a popular topic of conversation among the human group on the Monster Continent.
