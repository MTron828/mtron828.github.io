Chapter 1154: The Shock of the Palace Masters

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The five Palace Masters gathered together in the Green Fire Palace, including three Original Bodies and two consciousness.

They looked very unhappy.

“The Jin Kingdom!” the Sunrise Sword Emperor said with cold eyes. He clenched his hands tightly and his teeth were chattering.

“Jian Wushuang has reached the level of a Dao Master and has the same strength as us, so he is likely to be the leader of the Green Fire Palace in the future, but now…” The Samsara Temple Master sighed slightly.

“Although I didn’t believe in his strength before, I hoped that he would exceed my expectation and then become the leader of the Green Fire Palace. I didn’t think that he would be assassinated in the Jin Kingdom.” Red Lotus said coldly.

Although the five Palace Masters had very high hopes for Jian Wushuang, their main concern was about the Green Fire Palace.

They had hoped that there would be a leader in the Green Fire Palace. Therefore, whenever a genius or an expert died, they would grieve.

Hearing that Jian Wushuang had died, they were deeply grieved.

At this moment…

“Hmm?” Tang Emperor’s expression changed, and then he turned to look at the other Palace Masters. “Please follow me.”

They felt very confused, but they still followed him.

Tang Emperor led them to a secret chamber in the Green Fire Palace.

There was no light inside the secret chamber.

When the five Palace Masters arrived, a figure appeared out of nowhere.

“Five Palace Masters.” Jian Wushuang, who was dressed in a black robe, gave a salute to the five Palace Masters politely.

Everyone aside from Tang Emperor was very surprised.

“Jian Wushuang? You are not dead?” Red Lotus screamed at first.

“Is it your original form rather than your consciousness?”

Samsara Temple Master stared at Jian Wushuang and then he realized that Jian Wushuang was indeed an original body rather than a short consciousness like him.

“Did your doppelganger fight with them in the battlefield? That’s not right. Why would your doppelganger have such strength?” Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, and the other people all felt surprised.

“It was indeed my Original Body that appeared in the battlefield, and it has died. However, I have long had had two Original Bodies.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Two Original Bodies?” All of the Palace Masters were very stunned.

They knew that one could have an Original Body and a doppelganger, but they never imagined he would have two Original Bodies.

“Because of Inverse Cultivation?” Void Temple Master stared at Jian Wushuang as if his eyes contained electricity.

In fact, they already knew that Jian Wushuang was an Inverse Cultivator.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang laughed and nodded. “An Inverse Cultivator has two Original Bodies. If he loses one Original Body, the other one will find a way to recover it. ”

“This…” The four Palace Masters looked at each other and felt very incredulous.

They had heard of Inverse Cultivation, but they only knew a little about it. Among the five Palace Masters, Tang Emperor knew it best.

“Tang Emperor, did you know Jian Wushuang has two Original Bodies?” Red Lotus looked at him.

“I knew.” Tang Emperor nodded slightly and then laughed. “My disciple Little Qing is also an Inverse Cultivator and has two Original Bodies, but nobody knows except me.”

“Well, you knew that Jian Wushuang wouldn’t die, but you didn’t tell us, so we were worried and grieved for him.” Red Lotus snorted, but in his heart, he felt relaxed.

Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master and Sunrise Sword Emperor all laughed.

They thought that Jian Wushuang, a peerless genius, had died, but they didn’t think that he just lost an Original Body.

“Inverse Cultivation is really terrible.”

Samsara Temple Master gasped in admiration and then turned to look at Jian Wushuang. He asked: “You said that your Original Body on the battlefield had died. What about Red Snow King and the other people? Are they dead?”

“I already knew that the Original Body would die, so I used myself as bait and set a trap for the four kings of the Jin Kingdom.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“There is a perilous place in those mountains that I call Chillywind Valley. In the Chillywind Valley, a mass Blood Coldwind always bursts out every hour. I experienced its power personally last time.

“Moreover, I’m the only one who knew of the danger in the Chillywind Valley and the rules on the outbreak of Blood Coldwind. The four kings of the Jin Kingdom didn’t know that, so I burst into the valley with a mortal heart and the four kings all followed me. After a while, the Blood Coldwind burst out…

“My Original Body was smashed in an instant. Heaven Shadow King also died. Red Snow King is very strong, so I don’t know if he died. If he is still alive, he must have suffered heavy injuries.”

Jian Wushuang spoke in a low but powerful voice.

Hearing this, the five Palace Masters were all shocked.

Jian Wushuang should used that Original Body as bait and then set a trap for those four kings.

And then…

Is Heaven Shadow King dead?

Is Red Snow King dead or alive?

“This…” The five Palace Masters looked at each other with shock in their eyes.

The kings from the Jin Kingdom were real Universe Master experts.

Every Universe Master expert was very strong.

A Universe Master was a respectable person in the universe and was supreme in the Eternal World. It was very difficult to kill such a top expert, wasn’t it?

The Green Fire Palace had been fighting with the Jin Kingdom for five million years. In the former mad war, they had fiercely fought against each other, only several Universe Masters were killed. Almost no Universe Master had died ever since.

Yet Jian Wushuang had actually directly killed one Universe Master.

More surprisingly, no one knew whether Red Snow King, who was the strongest, was dead or alive.

The five Palace Masters began to look at Jian Wushuang with different attitudes.

They felt very surprised when they found out that Jian Wushuang could escape from Heaven Illusion King, Golden Rock King, and Heaven Shadow King at leisure before, but they didn’t think that he was really on par with them. He was likely to have the strong skill to protect himself.

Now, however, Jian Wushuang had actually killed a Universe Master!

Although he had taken advantage of the danger of the Chillywind Valley to succeed, the five Palace Masters admitted his position in their hearts. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In fact, they didn’t know that the four kings were lucky. The Blood Coldwind had burst out soon after they entered the Chillywind Valley.

If the Blood Coldwind had burst out a little later when they had completely entered the valley and had no time to escape, all of the four kings would have probably been killed.
