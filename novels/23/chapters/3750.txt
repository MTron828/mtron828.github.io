Chapter 3751: Approaching

Pupil Master’s expression immediately turned grave when he discovered that Jian Wushuang had appeared within his soul perception.

At the same time, the special treasure hidden in his body once again revealed an unprecedented desire.

“As expected, as long as Blood Sword Master appears, my treasure will be extremely restless. It seems that Blood Sword Master indeed has something that the treasure desperately desires. Unfortunately...” Pupil Master’s gaze darkened slightly, but he began to comfort the treasure.

“Don’t worry, baby. I’ll definitely think of a way to get the thing in Blood Sword Master’s hands in the future. But for now, it’s better to leave.”

Pupil Master shook his head. He had no intention of meeting Jian Wushuang.

After all, Jian Wushuang was far stronger than him and they had long been enemies. He had been beaten up by Jian Wushuang and had to flee in a sorry state.

Now that he was alone, he naturally did not dare to face Jian Wushuang again, so he could only choose to retreat.

It was funny to say that a mighty Ruler wanted to avoid a Principles Master on his own initiative.

“Blood Sword Master, I’ll let you be complacent for a while. I’ll definitely get back at you in the future.” Pupil Master clenched his hands and secretly hated Jian Wushuang.

He had deliberately bypassed Jian Wushuang.

However, he soon found that although he had bypassed him, Blood Sword Master had changed his direction at the same time and rushed toward him.

“Blood Sword Master has the strength of an Advanced Ruler, so his soul perception must be strong. I can sense his existence, so he should be able to sense me. Now that I’ve bypassed him, he’s unyieldingly approaching me?” Pupil Master’s expression was a little ugly.

As a Ruler, he had already avoided a Principles Master, but the Principles Master did not give up and continued to rush toward him.

Although he was extremely angry, Pupil Master still did not have the intention to face Jian Wushuang.

He continued to change directions and increased his speed.

However, when he changed directions, Jian Wushuang immediately changed directions. After he increased his speed, Jian Wushuang also increased his speed.

It was obvious that he was completely focused on him.

“Blood Sword Master, what are you doing?”

In a rage, Pupil Master shouted directly through his consciousness.

“Pupil Master, at least we’ve met twice before. We can be considered acquaintances. Now that we’ve met for the third time on the Third Continent, it’s a bit unreasonable for you to leave without even greeting me,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“I’m unreasonable?” The corner of Pupil Master’s mouth twitched slightly. “I don’t have any friendship with you, so there’s no need for me to greet you. I’m leaving now, so don’t follow me.”

“What’s the rush? Why don’t we sit down and have a chat?” Jian Wushuang smiled and sped up again.

The faster he sped up, the more alert Pupil Master became, and his speed also began to explode.

“Pupil Master is really alert.” Jian Wushuang could not help shaking his head, but then he felt relieved.

“That’s right. After all, we are in the Red Cloud World. Fighting and killing are too crazy. He knows my strength well. Although he never thought that I could kill him, he knows that I can easily defeat him. It’s normal that he doesn’t dare to meet me. After all, he was beaten up by me last time. I don’t think he would want to meet me again.”

Jian Wushuang smiled in his heart. Suddenly, his expression changed and he sent a voice transmission, “Pupil Master, don’t leave in a hurry. To be honest, I came here because I have something to ask you.”

“What is it?” Although Pupil Master replied, he did not stop. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s like this. I heard that you once obtained a special treasure by chance, and that treasure is very useful to me. That’s why I wanted to talk to you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Special treasure?”

When Pupil Master heard this, his vigilance instantly soared.

He did have an extremely special treasure, which was his biggest secret. In this world, no one else knew about it except himself.

The reason why he had recklessly attacked some Principles Masters in this territory all these years, regardless of his status, was largely because of that special treasure.

Now that Jian Wushuang mentioned the special treasure, Pupil Master immediately thought of the treasure in his hand.

But the question was, how did Blood Sword Master know that he had that treasure? Or was the special treasure mentioned by Blood Sword Master not that one?

“Blood Sword Master, I don’t know what the Special Treasure you mentioned is,” Pupil Master said directly.

“You don’t know, Pupil Master? That’s impossible. I know very well that the treasure is in your hands.” Jian Wushuang pretended to be very confident, then he said, “Pupil Master, I think you should stop for now. Let’s find a place to talk.”

Pupil Master’s eyes darkened slightly.

He did not dare to face Jian Wushuang directly, but what Jian Wushuang said just now made him hesitate.

He was not sure if the special treasure Jian Wushuang mentioned was his treasure. If it was true...if the existence of the treasure was known by the Blood Sword Master, it would definitely be a big trouble for him once it was spread.

Therefore, he also knew what the Special Treasure Jian Wushuang mentioned was.

“Okay, I agree to talk to you. As for the place, you don’t have to choose. It’s right here. I Won’t leave, and you don’t come closer. You and I are so far away in the void, so we can communicate through consciousness,” Pupil Master said seriously.

“Consciousness communication?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Yes.”

With that, Jian Wushuang stopped walking.

Pupil Master’s figure also stopped in the void.

The two were separated by nearly 70,000 miles of void, and they were holding each other from a distance.

Seeing Pupil Master’s figure really stop, Jian Wushuang did not show any change on the surface, but he secretly smiled in his heart.

He did not know what Special Treasure Pupil Master had obtained. The reason why he said that was so that Pupil Master could stop moving so that Temporal Temple Master could hide in the surrounding void space.

Jian Wushuang knew very well that a Primary Ruler like Pupil Master, who had extraordinary strength and possessed Supreme True Treasure Armor, must have obtained some special opportunities or fortunes. Most likely, he had also obtained some special treasures, this was very normal.

Most Principles Masters had obtained some special treasures, not to mention a Ruler. Jian Wushuang only said it was a special treasure, but he did not specify which one. Pupil Master would be even more apprehensive, he did not dare to underestimate his words.

As expected, Pupil Master was fooled.

He had stopped moving. Although there was still a distance of 70,000 miles between him and Jian Wushuang, this distance was nothing to him.
