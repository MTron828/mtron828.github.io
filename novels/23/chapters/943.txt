Chapter 944: Ancient God’s Wrath and Plenilune’s Roar

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Don’t be stupid, Jian Wushuang!”

Gu King said urgently, “The Essence Blood in your body is something that King Luo Zhen left behind at great cost. It’s very rare. If you take your time and slowly absorb it, you’ll surely become a top expert. If you force it now, it can only temporarily improve your strength. It’ll just be a waste and once it erodes you, you’ll suffer greatly.”

“Besides, there’s a chance that we can still turn the situation around. Those experts on your side may have some cards up their sleeves. In the worst case scenario, you can just run and make a comeback again in the future.”

“Make a comeback again in the future?” Jian Wushuang shook his head with a smile. “This battle started because of me. How can I hide during a crisis? Do you think I am a coward?”

He was determined to make use of the Essence Blood wrapped within his Bloodline Power. Suddenly, his Bloodline Power erupted and swallowed 10 percent of the Essence Blood.

“Jian Wushuang!” Gu King, who resided inside him, shouted anxiously.

He was relieved when he saw that Jian Wushuang had only swallowed 10 percent of the Essence Blood. “Fortunately, it’s only 10 percent of it!”

It was a pity that Jian Wushuang had wasted 10 percent of the Essence Blood but fortunately, there was still 90 percent of it left.

Jian Wushuang’s Bloodline Power surged wildly after swallowing the Essence Blood.

He stood up in the sinkhole and then slowly rose above while bathed in dark golden light. In the beginning, the light covered only his chest but it soon enveloped his entire body.

The shape of Quadrangular Stars began flashing between his eyebrows.

The first star appeared, followed by the second and third. The last one was particularly dazzling.

Three-star Ancient God!

He had become a perfect Ancient God of Imperial Kinsmen!

Jian Wushuang lifted his head to reveal a pair of eyes that had completely turned dark golden. Lightning seemed to sparkle in his pupils in an arc. He looked at the battlefield where Emperor Xiao’s men had retreated far into the distance while the opposing Dao Masters frantically pursued them.

This was especially true for the Immortal Army of the Xia Clan.

The army consisted of many people with the strength of a Dao Master. The worst factor was that they were afraid of dying on the battlefield because they would not live long anyway. The situation was incredibly bad for Emperor Xiao’s camp.

“Fortunately, the National Master couldn’t get away from King Gu Tong. Otherwise…” Jian Wushuang looked at the battle far from him, where King Gu Tong was fiercely grappling with the soothsayer. Many people were watching but none dared to step in.

The two men were rather evenly matched. It seemed that their fight would last a long time before a victor would emerge.

“Jian Wushuang, let me out.”

The voice of Gu King rang in Jian Wushuang’s head. “I haven’t been in a battle for a long time. When you’re weak, I’m weak too. Now that you’re at the top Level of Three-star thanks to the Blood Essence, I’m also much stronger and can use my Secret Skills.”

Jian Wushuang gave a small nod and focused his mind to let Gu King out. Soon, a scarlet light glimmered from the mysterious scarlet crack in his arm and a large body appeared in the Void.

Gu King was covered in terrifying reddish-brown scales and equipped with numerous tentacles. He was so large that he seemed to fill up the space around him.

However, due to Jian Wushuang’s influence, Gu King’s body was smaller compared to when he was in the Stellar Fog Sea.

Back in the Stellar Fog Sea, the body of Gu King was so large that he could form a huge island. However, he was now only a hundred feet long. Even so, he was still a terrifying sight due to his ferocious appearance and the horrible Killing Intent.

His Killing Intent was incredibly potent.

“Jian Wushuang, work with me.” Gu King’s voice rang again.

Jian Wushuang had skyrocketed to ten feet high and his skin had turned dark golden. Standing on Gu King’s massive head, he asked, “How?”

“You know how to use the three Secret Skills of Ancient Gods. Just exert the Mind-controlling Secret Skill with all your strength,” said Gu King.

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

“Ready…” Gu King instructed. “Go!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted as he used the Mind-controlling Secret Skill that he had already prepared.

He used the skill at full strength, amplified by the Ancient God Power at the top level of Three-star as well as the Divergent Blood Stone. It felt as if thousands of sharp spikes pierced into his consciousness.

Simultaneously, Gu King lifted his head. While Jian Wushuang was using his skill, there was also a violent aura surging from Gu King’s body.

“Plenilune Secret Skill…Roar!”

Frighteningly vicious currents swirled in the air. Gu King then opened his bloody mouth and took a deep breath before letting out an earth-shattering roar. The roar was so violent that everything between heaven and earth trembled.

“Hoot!”

The sharp and intense roar rocked everything in the world, even time and space. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The sound waves caused ripples to form in the Void in front of Gu King. These ripples rapidly expanded before finally shrouding the entire battlefield.

On the battlefield, the experts from both camps were still engaged in a fierce battle.

In fact, one side was obviously prevailing over the other.

Under the leadership of the Immortal Army, the camp of Emperor Leng and the Xia Clan was madly chasing after the Dao Masters of Emperor Xiao’s camp, the casualties of which were heavy.

Then, the roar resounded.

“What?”

The Dao Masters all turned toward the direction of which the roar came from.

“What’s that?”

They all saw Gu King’s massive body but could not recognize what it was.

The roar resounded again and the waves of ripples also subsequently spread.

The ripples contained the horrible Sound Wave Attack formed by the Secret Skills that “Plenilune Centipede” Gu King used. They also carried the consciousness attack formed by the Mind-controlling Secret Skills that Jian Wushuang used.

The perfect match between the two had created this fearsome attack.

This was the Plenilune’s roar, as well as the Ancient God’s wrath!
