Chapter 2367: Apprehension

Each Elder possessed an Elder’s Token and had full authority in its distribution.

He could give to whoever he wanted even if that person was unrelated to Narcissus Island. In this case, Wujian had chosen Jian Wushuang—the outer disciple of Narcissus Island.

“Wujian, you are unbelievable!” The Seventh Elder trembled with anger and glowered at Wujian.

“It’s you who’s unbelievable! So what if I give him my Elder’s Token? Not only had I given him my Elder’s Token, but I’ve also ordered the Elixir Chamber and Supply Storage to treat Jian Wushuang better than a core disciple. His monthly elixirs and resources allocation will be more than an average core disciple’s. What can you do about it?” Wujian sneered.

“Absurd! That’s jobbery! Those in the Elixir Chamber and the Supply Storage will never violate Narcissus Island’s rules for you,” said Seventh Elder.

“You’re right. But what if I allow them to deduct from my allocation?” Wujian mockingly refuted.

The Seventh Elder coldly questioned, “Who’s Jian Wushuang? Why are you even willing to forfeit your own resources? Is he your family’s descendant or perhaps your illegitimate son?”

“Regardless of your assumptions, I’ve not violated Narcissus Island’s rules. What can you do?” Wujian was fearless.

He did nothing wrong.

He could give his Elder’s Token to anyone he wanted.

The elixirs and resources were also his personal gift taken from his allocation which was of course not against the rules.

“Harumph, do as you please but let me warn you that your actions today will be greatly disputed and won’t bring any good to that kid,” warned the Seventh Elder before he turned around and left—refusing to talk any further with Wujian.

Wujian just sat down again and drank a cup of tea with a grin on his face.

“What an idiot! He doesn’t even know how extraordinary Jian Wushuang is. I bet he would have done even more than me if he knew!” Wujian said scornfully.

“On the other hand, Jian Wushuang who’s wickedly talented only chooses to be an outer disciple in Narcissus Island so that he could enjoy the freedom and remain inconspicuous. This matter would’ve been easier if he’s more transparent with his intentions from the start.”

Wujian shut his eyes after letting out a sigh.

In Narcissus Mansion...

When the Seventh Elder went off to see Elder Wujian, Jian Wushuang had already reached the mansion’s fourth floor.

He had also browsed through two Sword Technique Manuals.

Both Sword Technique Manuals were at the advanced level with one of them being a technique that complemented Transmigration Law and was highly beneficial for Jian Wushuang.

However, he was not in a hurry and took his sweet time to browse through.

Suddenly, a seemingly ordinary jade slip caught Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

It was a record of a certain law which an expert apprehended.

“It’s the apprehension of Space-time Law?” Jian Wushuang was excited.

There were all sorts of secret techniques manuals, biographies, and law apprehensions record in the Narcissus Mansion but none moved him until now.

He anticipatingly started browsing it carefully.

“There are heaps of Space-time Law information!”

‘I’ve studied Space-time Law for over a hundred thousand years and my understanding is at best superficial, but it’s good enough to achieve the Saint’s Realm. The following are my Space-time Law apprehensions...’

Jian Wushuang was amazed by just the initial paragraph’s few lines.

‘Saint’s Realm?

‘This must be an Undying Saint!’

The jade slip was the possession of an Undying Saint!

Jian Wushuang continued reading.

‘At the very beginning of comprehending the law, one needs to learn about integrating Space-time Law into true time and space by seizing control over the power of Space-time Law and integrate it into Heaven and Earth to make yourselves less repellant to time and space. Doing so will strengthen one’s speed and power.

‘However, mastering this level of Space-time Law power is just a small glimpse into the actual law and as one’s understanding deepens, one will be more proficient in using these powers and could gradually perform the Space-time Apparition by only relying on the Space-time Law!

‘One’s command of Space-time Law and combat powers will be boosted upon the success of performing the apparition which signifies one has entered the first stage of Space-time Law comprehension.’

Jian Wushuang’s heart raced upon reading that.

“Apparition? Space-time Apparition?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

His current understanding of the Space-time Law is much stronger than his past life. In his past life, he could barely utilize the powers of Space-time Law, but he could presently sort of perform the Space-time Shadow.

However, Space-time Shadow is just a shadow and was different from an apparition.

In fact, the difference between the two was quite huge.

If he continued making progress in Space-time Shadow, sooner or later he would be able to perform Space-time Apparition.

Once he succeeded, that would be when he had truly reached the first stage in Space-time Law apprehension.

Jian Wushuang undoubtedly knew that even if he succeeded in performing a Space-time Apparition it was just a fraction of what the vast knowledge which Space-time Law entails.

‘Continuous improvements after successfully forming a Space-time Apparition will enable one to increase the number of apparitions by tens, hundreds, or even thousands. Such will be extremely useful in combat when the opponent is unable to locate your true self. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

‘After fully mastering the apparition technique can one then proceed to the second stage of Space-time Law—Strangulation!’

...

Jian Wushuang was totally engrossed by the jade slip’s contents.

The tips left by the Undying Saint was insightful as it not only contained his Space-time Law apprehension, but it also contained his understandings and experiences of using the law in cultivation and combat.

Those pieces of information were new to Jian Wushuang.

After quite some time, Jian Wushuang finally recovered his senses.

“Such benefits!”

“This is so useful to me who’s also practicing the Space-time Law.”

“Unfortunately, the information seems to be incomplete. Otherwise, I’m afraid it won’t be placed on the fourth floor,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

After briefly browsing through, he found the jade slip only contained detailed information of the law’s first-stage and second-stage apprehension which was Apparition and Strangulation. Any information after the second-stage was nowhere to be found. It was indeed an incomplete manual.
