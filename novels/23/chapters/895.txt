Chapter 896: I Am Gu King!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How, how could it be?”

When he saw this, even Jian Wushuang felt a hint of fear.

It was enormous and boundless, with scarlet scales, surrounded by numerous savage tendrils, covering its body.

A simple glance revealed countless hundreds of tendrils, thickly dotted across its body.

There was a huge maroon head at the top of that scarlet body, which was also fully covered with tendrils. Also, there was no nose on its face, just a pair of humongous eyes and a wide-opened bloody mouth.

There were also two tendrils beside its mouth.

It was fiendish, scary, and horrifying!

It gave off a frightening atmosphere which seemed to cast a shadow over everything in its surroundings.

However, the most bloodcurdling was its size.

It was just way too humongous!

Jian Wushuang had seen some huge exotic beasts before, but compared to this enormous scarlet worm beast, even the biggest one was a joke.

They wouldn’t even be qualified to be called small.

It was just like comparing ants to an elephant.

The humongous island they had been standing on before was actually its coiled up body.

“Is this...really the island we were just standing on?”?

Jian Wushuang’s heart was trembling.

Before this, he had walked a good distance on the island and noticed that the island seemed unusual. But to his great surprise, this island was actually a living creature and a huge horrifying worm beast at that.

Jian Wushuang was secretly amazed. However, his expression changed suddenly.

“This, this is,” His eyes were filled with astonishment.

He stared at the huge worm beast in front of him carefully. This beast... he sensed something familiar about it, like he had met it before.

Jian Wushuang tried to recall where he had sensed this before. In no time, he realized the worm beast’s identity.

“The Ancient God, the Ancient God Clan!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes. Now, he remembered. When he landed in the Ancient God Clan, he was badly wounded. At that time, Ancient God of the Ancient God Clan, along with Elder Ying, used a savage scarlet worm beast to cure him.

Jian Wushuang even assimilated the Essence Blood of the worm beast.

The worm beast’s Essence Blood seemed extremely precious.

However, the worm beast that was used to cure him, when compared to this one... Putting aside size and number of tendrils, was exactly the same in every other aspect.

“I am Gu King!”

An ancient and heavy sound was heard as enormous scarlet worm beast looked at Jian Wushuang with it’s humongous and round eyes.

“I am a Plenilune Centipede from the Ancient God Clan.”

“My lord is the Eight-star Imperial God of the Ancient God Clan, King Luo Zhen!”

The ancient and heavy sound reverberated throughout the area surrounding Jian Wushuang, which greatly shocked him.

“The Eight-star Imperial God?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened.

The hierarchy of the Ancient God Clan was decided by the number of angles in the Star on their chests.

So, the One-star Ancient God was the weakest, similar to a human Divine Realm expert.

While the Two-star Ancient God was equivalent to the Eternal Realm.

And the Three-star Ancient God in the Ancient God Clan, as he knew, was at the same level as the Dao Master in human.

Three stars was enough to rival human Dao Master. Yet this one, the master of Gu King, was an Eight-star Ancient God?

Eight stars?

What level would he reach according to the standards of human cultivators?

Moreover, he is an Ancient God of Imperial Bloodline!

How powerful would he be?

“Blood Mountain, I sense the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan inside your body, and the purity of it is extremely high. You also possess the Imperial Bloodline. Besides that, you are quite gifted since you managed to pass the three tests of Star Island and become the disciple of the Lineage of Stars. So, I will give you a chance to acquire my master’s most valuable treasure.”

After say that, Gu King lowered its moutain-sized head and opened its bloody mouth. At that moment, Jian Wushuang looked deep inside its bloody mouth, where he saw a dark golden light.

“What’s that?” Jian Wushuang glanced at that dark golden light.

But there was not enough time for him to understand what it was. Gu King’s bloody mouth drew near and seemed as if it was trying to devour Jian Wushuang.

Before Jian Wushuang could react, Gu King swallowed him in one gulp. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Lord Spirit Sound watched all this happen, from the beginning to the end, without interfering. Quite the opposite, he was standing there with a curious smile on his face.

After being swallowed by Gu King, Jian Wushuang was confused for a second. He didn’t understand what had happened at first, and by the time it dawned on him, he was already inside a grandiose scarlet palace.

This scarlet palace was also tremendous, with enough space to accommodate thousands of people. However, Jian Wushuang knew that this palace existed inside Gu King’s stomach.

At this point, Jian Wushuang finally understood what the dark golden light which attracted him was.

There was a drop of dark golden Essence Blood suspended above the scarlet palace!

Yes, a drop of Essence Blood.

This drop was exceptionally pure and contained incredible power. It only took Jian Wushuang one look to be completely enthralled by it. At the same time, the Ancient God bloodline inside him began to seethe subconsciously.

It began to seethe dramatically and even started to boil.

His light in his eyes even began to burn with a subconscious desire.

It was the first time Jian Wushuang had such peculiar feelings since he assimilated the Ancient God bloodline.

Although this feeling was weird, he was still able to remain calm in the deepest place of his heart.

“Is this drop of Essence Blood the most valuable treasure which that Eight-star Imperial God left?” Jian Wushuang whispered.

“Blood Mountain.”

The voice of the Gu King arose directly in the palace. “What you are looking at is the Inheritance Essence Blood which was condensed by my master before his death. This drop of blood contains my master’s bloodline and power.”

“If someone from the Ancient God Clan manages to refine this drop of Essence Blood and slowly absorb its energy over time, they could eventually come to possess the Imperial Bloodline of the Ancient God. As for the power, although they would not be able to completely inherit my master’s strength, which was at the eight-star Ancient God level, he could still, at the very least, reach the level of five or even six stars!”

“And, this increase in power will not have any side effects. After the master’s Essence Blood is completely absorbed, they can still rely on their own ability and continue to improve their strength.”

“Of course, the prerequisite for achieving this is that they must be able to refine this drop of Essence Blood.”
