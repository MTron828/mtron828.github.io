Even as the patriarch, rules were rules.

“Clan leader, this matter must not be publicized, to avoid tarnishing the Xuanyuan family’s reputation!” Several patriarchs advised cautiously.

Xuanyuan Dapan, with a stern face, stood at the entrance of the treasure vault, turned to his eldest son, Xuanyuan Ancheng, and said angrily, “Do you even take the family’s security seriously?”

Xuanyuan Ancheng, standing on the side, lowered his head and dared not retort.

Xuanyuan Dapan was the backbone of the family. Although he was called the clan leader, who dared to let him manage trivial matters? Usually, the family affairs were handled by Xuanyuan Ancheng.

Now that a problem had arisen, naturally, he was held accountable.

“Open the door!” Xuanyuan Dapan snorted coldly.

Xuanyuan Ancheng quickly stepped forward and opened the door of the secret chamber.

In the instant the door opened, Xuanyuan Dapan struck with a palm, an endless force of destruction emitting a black brilliance, instantly sweeping through the entire secret chamber.

The secret chamber had formations suppressing it. Although Xuanyuan Dapan was a tier 5 Emperor, a casual blow couldn’t damage the secret chamber, but the treasures inside were not so fortunate.

Even the top- grade Innate Treasures were damaged.

The stacked mountain of godstones was instantly melted away.

Now, all that remained were some rare treasures and exotic fruits. These treasures were stored in special utensils, and the previous strike did not destroy them.

However, even so, Xuanyuan Dapan’s palm had annihilated over a billion worth of assets.

For him, over a billion was nothing.

The Foxfire Palace had an annual revenue of over a billion, and he could take 30 percent. In a hundred years, that would be 3 billion.

The intrusion of that thief was a major concern. Failing to apprehend the intruder or eliminate them would be a disgrace.

Confronted with the fury of Xuanyuan Dapan, Jian Wushuang inside was also startled.

The terrifying force just now, in such a confined space, would have killed him a hundred times over if it weren’t for his Ten Refinement’s supreme physique.

His physical body had disintegrated at least ten times just now. finally condensing again, but the divine body inside was almost depleted.

He was now turned into a speck of dust, drifting towards the outside. The dust, accompanied by the powerful aura in the thick smoke, went unnoticed by outsiders.

Xuanyuan Ancheng and several ancestors quickly entered the secret room, searching but finding nothing.

Within such a vast aura, they couldn’t even sense the other party’s presence, let alone find the hidden person.

“Could they have already fallen?” someone wondered.

Xuanyuan Ancheng, however, was meticulous. After a thorough search, his eye sockets narrowed to a dot, and he said in a low voice, “Either the other party has escaped, or they’re still here.”

“Still here?” Xuanyuan Anchengs words made several tier 4 Emperors feel as if facing a great enemy.

Escape?

How could that be possible? If they could escape a tier 6 formation, they wouldn’t care about these treasures.

If the intruder had escaped right after the door opened, it was also unlikely. There were tier 5 Emperors outside blocking the way. The intruder should have been seriously injured even if they were a tier 4 Emperor!

Could it be that they are really still here?

Regardless, this place is not suitable for a prolonged stay.

“Father, I couldn’t find anything!” Xuanyuan Anchengs face was ashen.

Xuanyuan Dapan reined in his imposing aura, knowing that today was a setback. He spoke calmly, ‘Last time, I gave you the seed containing the godstones. Did you leave it here?”

“Yes!” Xuanyuan Anchengs eye sockets tightened again, suddenly remembering something. He immediately bowed.

Xuanyuan Dapan waved his hand weakly, saying, “Go then! Be more cautious in the future!”

The astute ancestors present quickly understood.

It seemed that during the last welcoming of the third son, someone had set their sights on him.

Now, whether the person had escaped or not was no longer important.

Because they had identified who this person was.

Xia Mang!

They guessed the surname right, but unfortunately, they couldn’t imagine that it was personally done by Xia Mang Guanyu.

The speck of dust floated in the air.

Finally, it settled on a Yan Immortal who was heading out.

When the person reached a bustling street, Jian Wushuang seized the opportunity to transfer to another individual several times. Finally, in a deserted alley, he restored his appearance.

Outside the alley, Xia Mang Guanyu was waiting.

After obtaining the seed, the clone naturally dissipated.

With the depletion of the divine body and the shattering of the origin source, all that remained was a physical body, and even the supreme Innate Treasure had melted away.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Having obtained the mustard seed, Jian Wushuang finally breathed a sigh of relief.

The mustard seed was ordinary, as he had examined it beforehand; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so bold.

After placing the godstones into his own mustard seed, he crushed the mustard seed.

Holding the board on his thumb, Jian Wushuang revealed a smile.

8 billion godstones in total.

He had never seen so many godstones before.

But that didn’t mean his worth was diminished.

Just the accessories of Candle Dragon alone were each worth more than 8 billion.

When he exchanged for the Candle Dragon Wings in Qiuhuang City, it was practically a gift, especially the Eternal Treasure it provided for protection.

Now he understood that even replicated Eternal Treasures had different grades.

The Eightfold Cloud Dragon Seal’ he obtained back then was a top-quality replica.

Its value in the outside world was worth hundreds of millions of godstones, but he got it for just a million treasure points.

In comparison, other treasures didn’t lag behind as much.

Fortunately, he exchanged for the Candle Dragon Wings back then. In the Four Great Secret Realms, a pair of Candle Dragon Wings alone could not only enhance the power of the spatial origin source but also elevate his comprehension of spatial insights. It was estimated that no one would be willing to sell it.

The origin source was the weakest point for cultivators in the Four Great Secret Realms. Any treasure that could enhance the origin source was exceedingly expensive.

This time, the origin source treasure he wanted to buy encompassed the Five Elements of All Things, extremely complex, to put it simply, it could handle anything. The cost was enormous.

Originally, buying those treasures was just an experiment.

Now, with these 8 billion godstones, he could try relying on treasures.

The power of devouring, didn’t he want to devour?

This time, he would devour to his heart’s content.

Specifically buying the Emperor’s origin source, especially the spatial origin source, spending several tens of billions to devour, let’s see how powerful his dao of devouring could be.

Perhaps among all Dao Lords, only he was so wealthy.

After returning to the royal residence, he began to intensify efforts to recruit followers.

He even spared no expense, selecting some Emperors from the prison, as long as they followed him in battle for a thousand years, they would be exempt from imprisonment.

Although it didn’t cost much, Jian Wushuang had only crafted an exceptional set of treasures for them. However, the cost of bringing them out amounted to over 100 million godstones.

Fortunately, he had recruited enough tier 2 and 3 Emperors.

Now, he was only lacking tier AEmperors.

10 Dao Lords, 72 tier 2 Emperors, and 36 tier 3 Emperors—all slots were filled.

As for tier 4 Emperors, there were still two vacancies.

Outside the imperial city, in the Northern Army camp.

Within a small military camp belonging to Jian Wushuang.

“Your Highness, those seven individuals are currently in Lishan County. As long as Your Highness offers the right price, they will come immediately!” Jian Wushuang revealed a contemplative expression.

Among the tier 4 Emperors he had recruited, one was a wandering cultivator in the chaotic domain. Since he knew quite a few people, Jian Wushuang had tasked him with searching for some wandering cultivator tier 4 Emperors..
