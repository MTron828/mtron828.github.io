Originally, Jian Wushuang had planned to devour it, but it had been a long time since he had tasted meat.

Feeling a sudden whim, he decided to roast the giant python instead.

Surprisingly, his divine body doubled in size.

For a tier 5 Emperor-level savage beast, it wouldn’t usually be of much help to Jian Wushuang. The meat itself had only a slight effect, but it seemed that the prolonged exposure to the Hundred Weeping Vines had contributed to the enhancement of his divine body.

Now, the root of the Hundred Weeping Vines had taken root within the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard.

“Don’t worry, I won’t take advantage of you. The treasures in these mustard seeds should be sufficient!” Jian Wushuang handed over a mustard seed.

This mustard seed contained treasures from the fallen Emperors of the Kui Organization he had plundered earlier. He had collected all the treasures within.

He gave a portion to Gong Miaoyi, considering that the combined value of the two tier 6 Emperor-level beings he had defeated, even though it was just a portion, exceeded 3 trillion.

The Hundred Weeping Vines were indeed special. If nurtured properly, they could generate a continuous stream of wealth. However, Gong Miaoyi lacked the ability to take care of it.

Afterward, Jian Wushuang condensed an Origin Source and took out a whole jar of tears from the Hundred Weeping Vines, handing them to Gong Miaoyi.

While the tears of the Hundred Weeping Vines were precious, the universal power within them was even more valuable. These treasures should be enough.

Not too advantageous.

The tears from just now were praised by the Hundred Weeping Vine for over 100 epochs. Back then, a tier 5 Emperor was also extremely fortunate to obtain a vine of the Hundred Weeping Vine.

Unfortunately, his own strength was too weak, and he ultimately fell. It turned out to be a windfall for the two of them.

Although many tears were lost, the accumulated amount over the years was substantial, reaching several hundred units. What he just gave to Gong Miaoyi accounted for one-fifth of it.

This value was not something that godstones could calculate.

Gong Miaoyi accepted without any hesitation.

The vines of the Hundred Weeping Vine couldn’t be divided, so one party had to bear the loss.

Due to her weaker strength and background, she could only swallow the bitter fruit. However, Jian Wushuang being able to give her so many treasures was quite unexpected.

It seemed that since Jian Wushuang had restored his true identity, he had changed completely, losing the ruthless and aggressive aura he once had.

He didn’t notice it himself, only feeling that he should kill less in the future and follow the path of heaven.

The path of heaven nurtures all things, and the power of all things is most suitable for walking the path of heaven.

The law of cause and effect, killing, and calamity were like ants on a hot pot. When Jian Wushuangs pot was not hot, the ants were relatively obedient. Now that he was getting stronger, the pot was getting hotter, and the ants began to run around.

Especially after vaguely breaking through the Extreme Dao, that feeling became even clearer.

Before merging with the Dao, Jian Wushuang had to cut off this part of cause and effect.

Now it was better to leave first.

“Jian Wushuang, where do you plan to go next?” Gong Miaoyi asked curiously.

But upon second thought, Jian Wushuang was an Inheritor and would probably go to the mysterious Grave God Mountain.

Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised. This person was no longer afraid of him, but there was nothing to be said about such things. He replied, “I’ll integrate with the Dao, then return to Grave God Mountain!”

“Are you really just a Dao Lord?” Gong Miaoyi found it hard to believe. “There’s nothing to hide. I am indeed a Dao Lord!”

The two chatted aimlessly as they walked out of the spirit spring secret chamber, then entered an ancient teleportation array to leave the place.

When they reappeared, they were already at the bottom of the Black Sea.

However, the current seabed was not as pitch-black as before; the sea had turned a light blue.

Splash!

Breaking through the water, the long-lost sunlight slanted down, and Jian Wushuang experienced an unprecedented sense of comfort.

100,000 years.

This time within the West Sea ruins, it was a true span of time, without any acceleration.

Counting the accelerated time, he could be considered an ancient creature who had lived through several epochs.

Back in the starry sky, although there was no clear calculation, a rough estimate would put it at least as the baseline for two epochs.

Opening his hands, the tattered clothes on his body were replaced with a dark green robe, and his hair stood tall once again.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Whew!

Jian Wushuang took a long breath.

On the side, Gong Miaoyi also put on her veil again, restoring her former noble saintly appearance.

Just as the two were preparing to bid farewell and take off separately, a powerful force swept in from a distance.

This force was familiar to Jian Wushuang, and he remained calm without any panic.

Then the sky tore apart, and a man in a Daoist robe, riding a black-lined serpent, walked out. It was none other the head of the Law Enforcement Hall of the Elder Palace, Wu Zuo.

Gong Miaoyi didn’t know who the newcomer was, but she felt that he was so powerful that she couldn’t breathe and could only stand still without moving.

“Jian Wushuang, long time no see!” Wu Zuo revealed a faint smile. Initially, he was not fond of these Inheritors, but judging from the actions of Zhen Ling, these people would be the pride of the heavens in the future. Therefore, he no longer had the arrogance he once held towards these Inheritors.

Especially towards Jian Wushuang, this Dao Lord who could obtain the personal belongings of Qishen, he would undoubtedly become a significant figure in the future, at least someone highly valued by Zhen Ling.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. Although he knew that Wu Zuo had sent away the old man with goat horns at that time, causing him to be taken away, he couldn’t show it on his face. Moreover, Wu Zuo didn’t know that Bai Junwang had come for him back then.

“Greetings, Emperor!”

Wu Zuo waved his hand casually and said, “No need for formalities.”

“l came this time for two reasons. One is to take back Situ Nan, whom you should have already met. The other is to see you.”

Jian Wushuang was momentarily surprised. Come to see him? He couldn’t even go to the Grave God Mountain now. M/ell, this time he could cling to Wu

Zuo’s thigh, join the Grave God Mountain, and ascend to the Heavenly Realm.

“What does the Emperor need from me?”

Wu Zuo casually took out a mustard seed and said, “Someone asked me to bring you a gift. Take a look for yourself.”

Jian Wushuang took the mustard seed and opened it, only to be stunned. Inside was a redwood box.

After taking out the box, he found a long sword lying inside.

Wu Zuo, upon seeing the long sword, didn’t express surprise. He sighed and said, “This is the sword bestowed by Jueyun. After Yang Sanmu became a tier 6 Emperor, he exchanged it from Palace Master Zhu Yi specifically for you. Consider it compensation for not protecting you well back then.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang felt a warmth in his heart.

He had never blamed the old man with the goat horns. He had cursed Wu Zuo in secret, but when he met the old man in Great Xia, although they didn’t say much, their thoughts were clear. There was no need for such extravagance!

Wu Zuo felt awkvvard as well. If the old man with the goat horns spent so much, as the Law Enforcement Hall Master, he was the one who had initiated Yang Sanmu back then. In the end, the responsibility was on him.

Now that Yang Sanmu had spent so much, he had to express his gratitude, right?

Clearing his throat, Wu Zuo took out a jade box and said with a smiling gaze, “Last time’s incident was a bit inappropriate on my part. This Dragon

Prolonging Fruit was obtained by my master from cutting down an ancient Dragon God tree. When it was split, I got one too. It’s of great help to the divine body. I see your divine body is still weak; you can use it to forge your foundation..
