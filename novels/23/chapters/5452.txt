Chapter 5451 ¬†Zheng Ling Finishing Up

On Square Inch Mountain, he hadn't encountered anyone since he entered. He had been hovering at the foot of the mountain until he was teleported out, having gained nothing.

While ascending the Soul steps and entering the Eternal Transformation Pavilion, he only chose a treasure of average value, not much to boast about.

100,000 years passed, and he achieved nothing.

Even climbing the Transformation Dao steps didn't provide much insight into the growth of all things.

This time could be considered a waste, accompanying others in a fruitless journey.

Tongtian Buddha maintained a calm expression, and Zhen Wuyang had decent gains.

In the bronze furnace, treasures were abundant.

Those who inherited the Soul Dao legacy made quite a harvest, especially Hu Qing and Jiang Shang, who acquired a large number of treasures.

The destruction of the Three Kings Court happened too quickly.

There weren't many treasures left from the initial collection, but in the eyes of the Emperors, it was still a vast resource.

Among them, there were several Universe Treasures, but it was unclear who took them.

These people all wore a calm demeanor, particularly adept at feigning indifference.

The few practitioners of the Transformation Dao had a tough time.

Emperor Tianchan also had a gloomy expression, not uttering a word.

Since it was already over, they glanced down below and left on their own.

Gui Ling, who followed the Soul Dao legacy, also obtained some treasures and was in a good mood. He left with some surviving subordinates.

His disciple, Broly, rushed towards the vortex as if going insane.

Gui Ling shook his head, saying nothing more, and left with his people, displaying indifference.

As for Bukun and the others, they had long since perished.

When Jian Wushuang entered the Three Kings Court, they were surrounded and killed by their subordinates.

Now, the entire relic had collapsed into the temporal turbulence, and finding their bodies was extremely difficult.

Splash!

Just as Broly was about to enter the vortex, Wu Zuo took action.

Before the person arrived, a massive palm had already descended, directly gripping Broly.

"Ah ah!!" Broly roared, his body bursting with a golden light, surprisingly breaking free from the restraint and plunging directly into the vortex.

By the time Wu Zuo arrived, it was too late.

The vortex had disappeared.

They had entered the chaos of temporal streams.

Once inside, even the Universe Master would fall. Naturally, Wu Zuo dared not enter, but he lost this Transformation Dao Emperor.

He was unaware that the relic trapped in the temporal chaos had not entered the chaotic flow but had appeared in another place.

The Origin Source Sea!

Zhen Ling beckoned with his finger, taking the relic of the Three Kings Court into his hands.

Naturally, Broly was also saved by him.

"Hmph, dare to challenge me!" Zhen Ling smirked.

In the recent Western Sea ruins, he secretly clashed with Shen Ling. Although the outcome wasn't explicitly determined, Fuego fled. However, due to Fuego's spatial traversal reaching perfection, Shang also advanced to the cosmic realm, becoming a Universe Mahayana.

With the Origin Source elevated to the cosmic realm, only the cosmic secret techniques remained. Once those were perfected, he could strive for the Universe Master realm.

And then there was Hu Qing!

Hu Qing successfully merged with the Dao, which was also a cause for celebration.

Over the course of 100,000 years, on the Grave God Mountain, 4 Ultimate Emperor Lords emerged. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

94 Ultimate Dao Lords attempted Dao Merge, but only 4 succeeded. This success came at an immense cost.

The Ultimate Daos these four individuals pursued reached only the eighth layer. Even with the successful fusion of the eighth-layer Ultimate Dao, they only attained the peak of the fourth stage.

The remaining 3 were Ultimate Emperors who achieved success by merging with the seventh-layer Ultimate Dao.

These were the immensely powerful individuals of immeasurable value.

However, compared to Hu Qing, they were still far behind.

Hu Qing, with a perfected ninth level, successfully became the most extraordinary Emperor by harmonizing with the Dao, a feat that elevated him to the peak of tier 5.

In the ancient era, such a phenomenon was considered one of the strongest prodigies, a rarity that might not occur even across countless epochs.

Zhen Ling grew more fond of Hu Qing as he observed him.

The Qishen Temple had only been open for a little over 100,000 years, yet it had produced so many formidable inheritors. Perhaps, they could truly achieve a glorious revival.

No!

They would undoubtedly achieve greatness once again, standing on the other side of the starry sky, becoming the masters of the cosmos.

On the Grave God Mountain, the number of Inheritors had increased by tens of thousands over the years.

Among them, Ultimate Dao Lords numbered over 5,000.

Although it was impossible for everyone to cultivate like Hu Qing, even with reduced resources in the future, having 200 Ultimate Emperors among 5,000 Dao Lords was reassuring to him.

As long as one or two Universe Masters emerged, he would be confident enough to let the Qishen Temple guard other timelines from a distance. With a Universe Master presiding, they would have the capability to establish themselves in other timelines.

The potential of Inheritors was significant, but they couldn't stay confined within the Four Great Secret Realms forever; they needed to venture into the outside world.

Otherwise, they would never become Universe Masters in their lifetime.

After the battle between Shang and Fuego, both left the Qishen Temple. Zhen Ling sent them to the end of the river of time, to explore the land of temporal origin.

Beyond the tier 6, there was no longer a significant need to stay within the Qishen Temple.

"Ah, Transformation Dao!" Zhen Ling extended his hand, bringing the unconscious Broly before him.

In the Western Sea.

Facing the sea breeze, Zhen Wuyang, Tongtian Buddha, and others bid farewell to Wu Zuo and hurriedly departed.

A great war erupted in the Earth Realm, and the inheritors were all involved. Wu Zuo could leave, but they couldn't.

However, Dao Lords like Jian Wushuang had no obligation to participate.

"Wushuang, we'll see you on the Grave God Mountain!" Hu Qing, accompanied by Jiang Shang, also left. Before departing, he left a mustard seed for Jian Wushuang.

Inside were numerous treasures, all crucial items for enhancing divine bodies.

Jian Wushuang was stunned as he looked at the treasures. When he tried to decline, Hu Qing had already left.

He remembered this favor.

Looking at these treasures, he finally understood why the Emperors heading to Square Inch Mountain all had gloomy faces. It turns out all the treasures were in that bronze furnace!

No wonder Zhen Wuyang kept smirking.

They indeed obtained quite a few treasures.

However, compared to him, these treasures seemed less appealing.

Jian Wushuang had obtained a Temporal Treasure.

Zhen Ling would envy it when he saw it, but fortunately, there was a formation concealing the temporal energy, preventing others from discovering it.

The treasures given to him by Hu Qing were enough to boost his foundational divine body by 30,000-fold.

Having perfected the divine body cultivation technique, the Heavenly Demon Technique, his foundation was extremely solid, and it was time to accumulate the divine body.

After seeing off those people, only the elders from the Elder Palace remained.

Not many tier 5 Emperors from the Elder Palace fell this time, and they gained a lot, so it wasn't a significant loss.

After everyone left, they didn't linger in that place and headed directly towards the core of the Earth Realm.

They traveled from the Western Sea towards the southeast, using teleportation arrays along the way. However, the teleportation arrays in the Earth Realm were not well-distributed, so most of the time, they had to travel on foot.

Just the journey took ten years, and they finally reached the core of the Earth Realm.

The core of the Earth Realm was a mountain range, stretching countless miles, comparable to a higher-level world.

On the mountains, a deep and ancient city was constructed.

Taiwu Mountains, Taiwu City.

It was Jian Wushuang's first time here, and he was quite curious. This was the largest city he had ever seen, a city as big as a world.
