4680 Old Master Disappeared

To a Supreme realm expert, 100,000 years was merely a period of time for one comprehension.

At this point, over 100,000 Invincible Supreme experts went into seclusion at the same time to make full preparations for the upcoming reckoning.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang entered a state of selflessness and repeatedly confronted Ding Baiyi’s Sword Dao in his divine sense.

During the 100,000 years of Sword Dao discussion, Jian Wushuang learned to withdraw his force, which was indispensable for the framework of the entire Wushuang Sword Dao.

At the same time, he was also looking forward to the day when he would be able to have a real confrontation with Sword Immortal Ding Baiyi!

Above the clouds, the clouds rolled and the great path flowed slowly.

In these 100,000 years, the secular world rose and fell, the ancient sects fell and rose, all at the same time.

As for the Supreme martial artists who had transcended the boundaries of life and death, it was just a snap of the fingers.

100,000 years later, all the Invincible Supreme martial artists who had been in seclusion woke up one after another. Their divine power had already been adjusted to their peak state.

The Dragon clan and the Phoenix clan had gathered almost all of their Supreme realm cultivators in front of the heavenly Cloud Palace for this final moment.

If they could completely erase the Void Universe, it would be unparalleled merit for them!

Dao Yan, who was dressed in a green robe, came to Jian Wushuang slowly and said softly, “Master, they are all here.”

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes and the aura of the Great Dao flowed around him.

He looked behind him out of habit, but he did not see Old Master.

Jian Wushuang calmed himself down and said, “Chu Zhi, please invite Old Master here.”

Chu Zhi responded and quickly rushed to Old Master’s residence.

“Master, this time I want to go with you to gain some experience.” Supreme Dao Yan said solemnly, “I hope Master will agree.”

Jian Wushuang laughed, “You should come along this time.”

Upon hearing this, Supreme Dao Yan was overjoyed. “Thank you, Master.”

At this moment, Chu Zhi’s slightly flustered figure appeared. “Y-your Excellency, Old Master is not in his residence. He seems to have disappeared!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled and he immediately flew to Old Master’s residence.

Xue Bo and the others looked at each other and followed Jian Wushuang.

Feeling the dense divine power around him, Jian Wushuang’s heart sank. Then, he pushed the door open and entered.

On the wooden bed, a black-robed figure had his back to him.

“Old Master?” Jian Wushuang asked softly.

Then, the figure on the wooden bed got up, and Old Master’s unique face appeared in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief. However, before he could speak, Old Master spoke first.

“Wushuang, I’m leaving. I’m going to the place where I should go. Just pretend that I’ve never been here, don’t miss me.”

“As for the conditions I mentioned to you before, just treat them as a joke. Forget about them. I don’t want you to end up like that. What I’ve gone through can’t happen a second time.”

“No, where are you going?” Jian Wushuang shook his head and tried to stop Old Master from leaving. “Are you going to the Great Yan Domain alone?”

However, this was only the last shadow left by Old Master, and he could not touch it at all.

Old Master finally looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile in his eyes. “The days I spent with you were one of the few pleasant days I had. Staying by your side makes me feel like I’ve returned to my younger days, but I have to leave now.”

“Remember, never come to the Great Yan Domain. This is something you shouldn’t know. Forget everything.”

After saying this, Old Master’s figure finally disappeared.

Jian Wushuang reached out to grab it subconsciously, but he only managed to grab a handful of tiny stars.

At this point, Old Master had completely disappeared. He had disappeared too cleanly, as if he had never existed in the universe.

Jian Wushuang retreated slowly and sat on the wooden bed, exhausted.

To him, Old Master was both a teacher and a friend. Without him, the entire Divine Power Universe would have been destroyed long ago, and all living beings would be in misery.

However, now that the Divine Power Universe had won, he had disappeared like a passerby.

Jian Wushuang could not accept this. In his heart, Old Master was almost as important as Xuan Yi.

Xuan Yi was his Teacher, and Old Master was his friend. But now, both of them had disappeared without a trace. It was even inexplicable.

They were like passers-by in Jian Wushuang’s life, who had given him supreme fate and help. However, for some unknown reason, they disappeared without leaving any clues.

“The Great Yan Domain, everything must be related to that damned Great Yan Domain! All the answers I want to know are definitely there!” Jian Wushuang suddenly raised his head. He wanted to step into the space-time turbulence to reach Wang Mi, but he gave up.”

If he left, what would happen to the Divine Power Universe? As long as the Void Universe was not destroyed, the Divine Power Universe would not be at peace.

However, in fact, he could not bring himself to totally destroy the Void Universe. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After all, the Void Universe was too vast, and there were no fewer living beings than the Divine Power Universe.

If they were all killed, the killing path they created would be too terrifying.

Old Master seemed to have seen through Jian Wushuang’s thoughts and left quietly.

After a long time, Jian Wushuang looked down at the mottled star in his hand and murmured, “Old Master, I’m sorry.”

The door of the small house closed quietly, and he had been silent for 1,000 years.

Although Xue Bo and the others did not know what had happened, they had a rough idea. They all returned to the Cloud Palace and waited for Jian Wushuang’s arrival.

Only Supreme Dao Yan had been waiting quietly outside the door.

1,000 years passed in the blink of an eye, and the closed door opened again.

Jian Wushuang looked a little haggard. He looked at Supreme Dao Yan, who was waiting respectfully at the side, and forced a smile. “Why didn’t you leave?”

“I can feel Master’s sadness, but I don’t know how to share it. I can only wait outside the door. I’m stupid.” Supreme Dao Yan said, slightly embarrassed.

Jian Wushuang was slightly stunned. Then, he extended his hand and patted Supreme Dao Yan’s shoulder, “Come with me. I want to show you something.”

Supreme Dao Yan nodded his head and agreed. Then, he followed Jian Wushuang and reached out his hands, flying into the distance.

Under the starry sky, the invisible Great Dao flowed slowly, and countless destiny was born again.

The Divine Power Universe, which had experienced the most brutal catastrophe, was gradually recovering under the protection of Cosmos God.

Supreme Dao Yan followed behind Jian Wushuang and moved forward without stopping.

The plane that had given birth to life and the broken Star Field were all swimming in his eyes, as if it had been 10,000 years.

The closer they got to the edge of the universe, the more intense the killing intent became. It was the God Burial Ground formed after the battle of the Great Catastrophe!

Supreme Dao Yan followed Jian Wushuang and finally stepped into the Offworld Battlefield.
