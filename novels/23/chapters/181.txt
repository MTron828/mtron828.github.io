Chapter 182: Jian Nantian

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Nantian, what are you going to do?” Ma Qinghai frowned and looked over at him.

“Ma Qinghai, don’t you always want me to teach your son swordsmanship?” Jian Nantian said in a deep voice.

“Hum?” Ma Qinghai was stunned.

“Ma Changfeng, watch carefully! I’ll teach you a move.” While saying that, the wooden sword in Jian Nantian’s hand was wielded lightly.

With no spiritual power, only sword light.

The sword light was beautiful, sharp, and charming!

Its beauty was intoxicating.

When the sword light rushed forward, everyone present, including Jian Wushang and Dan Jiu, were deeply attracted by it and could not take their eyes off of it.

“This move...”?Dan Jiu widened his eyes.

Meanwhile, in the sword light, there was an unprecedented killing intent that froze the surrounding air.

CHUU!

The sharp and beautiful sword light appeared in front of Ma Qinghai.

With a terrified face, Ma Qinghai hurried to ward it off, only to astoundingly realize it was so fast he couldn’t even react to it. He could only helplessly watch the sword light rushing towards him, and then relentlessly passing through his neck.

After that, the sword light went on flying towards Ma Changfeng without decreasing in power.

Ma Changfeng’s eyes were round with fear, but he did not have the power to resist, either. The sword light passed through his neck as well.

Chi! Chi!

After two consecutive sounds of the sword edge passing through flesh, the entire yard became completely quiet.

Silent in death.

Jian Wushang, Dan Jiu, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou all witnessed this in astonishment.

While Jian Nantian, whom they were staring at, acted as if nothing had happened. He sheathed his sword, and then casually and slowly walked towards that stone table.

Plop!

Two bodies fell down upon the ground without a life aura. Even in death, Ma Qinghai and his son could not believe what was happening.

Let alone them, even Jian Wushuang’s party, including Dan Jiu, who had an unusual background and great experience, felt it was totally unbelievable.

What did they see?

Only with one single sword move, two warriors, one in the Initial Yin Void Realm and the other in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm were instantly killed?

If the man who wielded the sword was an expert in the Yin Void or Gold Core Realm, they would not be astonished at all.

But the man who wielded the sword was Jian Nantian!

His Dantian had been destroyed, and he had no spiritual power at all.

In other words, Jian Nantian was just an ordinary person.

But what was the result?

The sword move, that incomparably marvelous move, did not use any spiritual power at all, but it killed Ma Qinghai and his son, Ma Changfeng, using only the wielder’s swordsmanship and his comprehension of Sword Principle.

Moreover, it was a wooden sword!

What did that mean?

“What a monster!”

Dan Jiu shouted at the bottom of his heart,?“It was ridiculous enough that Master Wushuang reached such a level at 19 years old. It’s unbelievable that his father could be even more monstrous than his son!”

“With a destroyed Dantian, he could still kill a warrior in the Initial Yin Void Realm with one single sword move, with only his swordsmanship and Sword Principle comprehension? Oh my god!”

Both Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou also crazily swallowed, with their minds going totally blank.

Only Jian Wushuang was extremely excited, with flames burning in his eyes at that moment.

“This man... is my father, whom I adored from childhood.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

He had been worshiping his father since long ago.

In Sword Pavillion, his father was a legend.

Even today, Jian Wushuang’s worship towards his father had not even decreased a little, especially now... He witnessed the sword move his father wielded, that startling move. His admiration towards his father became even stronger.

This was his father!

Even though his Dantian had been destroyed, and his spiritual power had dissipated, he was still qualified to be a top expert in the Tianzong Dynasty, just by his swordsmanship and Sword Principle comprehension.

“I have combined three sword essences. In other people’s eyes, my achievements are defied common sense. However, compared with my father, my talent is nothing at all,”?Jian Wushuang said to himself.

He completely understood that if his Dantian had been destroyed and he had no spiritual power, he might be able to kill a common warrior of the Gold Core Realm with only his swordsmanship and sword essences. Even so, it would be a tough fight, even though he used a wonderful weapon like the Triple-kill Sword.

To kill a warrior of Initial Yin Void Realm with only a wooden sword was impossible for him.

In Sword Principle, his father was far stronger than him.

At this moment, Jian Nantian had sat down on that stone bench and was drinking wine again. He shot a glance at Jian Wushuang and distantly said, “Go. Enhance your strength. The current you still have a long way to go.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and barely calmed down. Then, he immediately kneeled down and respectfully presented Jian Nantian three loud kowtows. After that, he stood up and solemnly said, “I’ll come back to rescue you soon. Then I’ll have a good drink with you, father.”

Jian Nantian slightly smiled and waved his hand, “Go.”

“Go.”

Jian Wushuang just turned around and left with absolute determination.

Dan Jiu, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou closely followed him.

Only Jian Nantian was left, quietly sitting on the stone bench and drinking alone, but his eyes became gloomy and faint.

“Wumeng, Can you see? Our son... Hehe, he has grown up!”

...

After leaving that yard where Jian Nantian was imprisoned, Jian Wushuang’s face became cold. He said nothing, while none of the three people following him, Dan Jiu, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou, said anything. The atmosphere was a little dreary.

They quickly appeared again at the battlefield of Nine Emperors Sect.

But the fierce fighting in Nine Emperors Sect had already finished.

Among the eight Yin Void experts from the Nine Emperors Sect, five were already dead, and three were seriously injured. Only that Upper Elder still had a little power remaining, the other two were crippled.

As for the six purple-masked assassins, they were surrounded by the purple-robed people and were unable to do anything.

When Jian Wushuang returned to the battlefield, Ghost Tiger, the leader of the purple-masked assassins, immediately laughed, “I said you were doomed to be unable to rescue your father this time. What about now?”

Jian Wushuang stared at Ghost Tiger with an icy face, “Who destroyed my father’s Dantian?”

“Dantian?” Ghost Tiger coldly laughed and said, “Haha, of course I destroyed it myself. There was no other way. When I caught your father, he had broken through to the Yin Void Realm. What’s more important, his comprehension of sword essence was too high. His strength was far stronger than yours today.”

“If I didn’t destroy his Dantian, I was afraid that even I could not easily get close to him, so I had to do it.”

“You are called Ghost Tiger, right?” Jian Wushuang gazed at Ghost Tiger.

“Yes,” Ghost Tiger nodded.

“I will kill you the next time we meet.” Several cold words came out of Jian Wushuang’s mouth.

A cold light flashed in Ghost Tiger’s eyes, but he only coldly smiled.

“Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and the surrounding Golden Dragon Ambassadors nodded, then they all rushed out of the Nine Emperors Sect.
