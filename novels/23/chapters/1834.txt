Chapter 1835: Welcome Gift

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“This is…”

Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin looked at the scroll painting world above them. They felt the magnificent aura that was given out and their gaze fixed upon it.

“Nine-province of the universe, Yang Province as the seal!”

“Overwhelm the Rain!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and his palm swung to the void above.

Rumble. The universe shook and a lofty continent descended from the scroll painting world and pressed down.

“This power…” Emperor God Liu Guang looked shocked.

Emperor God Jiu Yin was terrified. He stared at the lofty continent as it pressed down at Deluge Fortress.

In Deluge Fortress, in the spacious palace where Fortress Master Hong Tian and the other thirteen Almighties gathered.

Suddenly, a shocking power pressed down. The thirteen Almighties including Fortress Master Hong Tian quickly lifted their heads.

“What’s going on?”

“Such terrifying pressure!”

“What happened?”

The thirteen Almighties immediately soared up from the palace in shock.

After leaving the palace, they immediately looked to the lofty continent that descended from the sky above.

Huge, the continent was too huge.

The power that it contained was earth-shattering and the Almighties were shocked.

“Oh my God!”

“This, is this punishment of God from above?”

“No, it’s going to hit.”

The lofty continent covered the entire Deluge Fortress. It first pressed against the formation surrounding Deluge Fortress. Fortress Master Hong Tian asked people to set up the formations within the past one year and its power was terrifying. Under normal circumstances, even if two to three Emperor Gods joined forces, they would need some time till they could resolve the formation.

Then, as the lofty continent descended, the entire formation was shaking vigorously from the pressure. After a while, it collapsed and shattered.

“The formation broke?”

The Almighties stared with their eyes wide. They then roared in the next moment.

“Be careful!”

“The continent is pressing down at us!”

“Quick, hurry up and block!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian, Emperor God Bing Can and the other eleven Sir Gods immediately took action.

There were fierce auras exploding from the thirteen of them. The ferocious attack hit the descending lofty continent like lightning.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were deafening noises that rang continuously. It could destroy the universe.

Along with the noises, the entire Deluge Fortress was covered by the lofty continent entirely.

In the void, Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yong stood as they watched Deluge Fortress from afar.

Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Ying’s facial expression were both very interesting.

“Sword Emperor, this is the welcome gift you gave to Deluge Fortress?” Emperor God Liu Guang looked at Jian Wushuang.

She could feel the power of the lofty continent earlier wasn’t any weaker than her strongest hit that she could perform with all her strength. It might even be stronger than her full-force hit.

To be able to perform an attack of such level, Jian Wushuang’s power…

“It isn’t easy to perform this move. It’s already great that I could perform it once,” Jian Wushuang smiled. Then, he waved and the Nine-province world dispersed very quickly and turned into a scroll painting in Jian Wushuang’s hand again.

Although Emperor Liu Guang heard Jian Wushuang say so, she didn’t quite believe him.

After all, when Jian Wushuang had performed the earlier move, he didn’t look like he had had any difficulty.

“The formation has broken. Now, it’s time for a head-on fight,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin looked forward and the boundless divine power gradually dispersed and revealed the scene within.

Under the weight of the lofty continent, the huge Deluge Fortress was crushed to the ground. The original fortress was replaced with a huge pit.

In the void above the pit, there were thirteen figures that stood there coldly.

They were the thirteen Almighties, including Fortress Master Hong Tian himself.

Jian Wushuang had performed Overwhelm the Rain with his full force earlier. Although it broke the formation surrounding Deluge Fortress and raze Deluge Fortress to the ground, the full pressure on the thirteen Almighties didn’t bring about any damage or injury to them.

Even so, Jian Wushuang was content.

At least his move had brought about a deterrent power to his enemies.

Then, among the thirteen Almighties, Fortress Master Hong Tian’s eyes were bloodshot and he was raging in anger. After all, Deluge Fortress was his lair. He had resided there all those years. Then, it had been razed to the ground. Even though it had been easy for him to rebuild Deluge Fortress, it had been rather humiliating to have his lair razed to the ground before everyone else.

As for the twelve Almighties behind him, they were all raging with anger. However, in the anger there was a faint fear.

They were fearful of the power in the earlier move.

Such terrifying power… Luckily, the thirteen Almighties had teamed up and they had Fortress Master Hong Tian, who was a Peak Emperor God. If they were to be against him one-on-one, they might be gone without any trace under such power. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were seven figures that plunged over from afar and appeared before the thirteen Almighties.

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian and the others saw the incomer and they immediately clenched their teeth. Of course, they had already noticed Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin by his side.

They were fine when they saw Emperor God Jiu Ying. However, when they saw Emperor God Liu Guang, many of their faces grew grave.

Emperor God Liu Guang was a Peak Emperor God who was on a higher ranking than the Master of Star Palace and Fortress Master Hong Tian.

But then, the Peak Emperor God was standing with Jian Wushuang.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian and everyone, my welcome gift is quite good, huh?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but his voice was extremely cold.

“B*stard!” Fortress Master Hong Tian clenched his hand and there was soaring murderous intention in his eyes.

The Almighties behind him were all shocked.

“How is it possible? Jian Wushuang came so soon?”

“Didn’t he say in ten years’ time? It has only been a year. In only a year, he got Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin to help him?”

“Forget about Emperor God Jiu Yin. Emperor God Liu Guang never gets involved in others’ fights. What price did Jian Wushuang pay to get her to be here?”

“D*mn it. The experts that we invited have yet to reach us and Jian Wushuang is already here?”

“What to do? What should I do?”

The Almighties were panicking.

Too bad. The scene was beyond their expectations.

It was entirely different from what they had expected.
