4822 The Lucky Daoist

Looking into the boat, there was only a chessboard and the two figures in red and blue Daoist robes.

However, Jian Wushuang did not move. Instead, he cupped his hands and said, “Old Sir, thank you for your kindness. However, we are on a different path, so we will not bother you.”

“It doesn’t matter. Although the destination is different, we can travel together for the time being. It’s been a long time since the two of us have chatted with outsiders.” The old man in the green Daoist robe laughed and placed the chess piece between his fingers on the chessboard.

Jian Wushuang was a little wary of the repeated invitations.

“With a boat, it’ll save some energy to deal with the possible situation that might happen next, right?”

After saying this, the old Daoist stopped talking and focused on playing chess with another old Daoist.

Jian Wushuang, who was originally vigilant, was relieved. Then, he landed on the boat.

The kind old Daoist was so focused on fighting with the other serious old Daoist that he did not have time to chat with Jian Wushuang and the others.

“My Lord, this place is so beautiful,” Xi Qingchi behind him could not help but exclaim softly.

However, Jian Wushuang did not talk to her. After he came to the boat, his eyes were all on the chessboard.

This was a strange game of chess.

There wasn’t a single black piece on the entire board, and the two old Daoist priests only held white pieces. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Half of the game had already passed.

He was puzzled. They were all white pieces, so how did the two old Daoists recognize who was the enemy?

Could they be like the Fengtian Patriarch from the Divine Power Universe? Were they just terrible at chess?

Even though Jian Wushuang’s chess skill was worse than that of Fengtian Patriarch, he was still unaware of it. Instead, he was carefully observing the chess game.

Very quickly, he was shocked.

Because he could not understand anything. The White pieces on both sides stopped, and he could not even tell friend from foe…

However, Jian Wushuang knew very well that the two old Daoist’s chess skills were definitely not as wild as his. They were also not like Fengtian Patriarch, who only knew how to block holes after several chaos cycles. They were not mediocre players, but true experts.

Even though Jian Wushuang could not distinguish between friend and foe, he could clearly see the attacks of the two old Daoists.

The seemingly kind-looking old Daoist’s chess moves were as fierce as a tiger, and he liked to besiege and conquer pieces.

On the other hand, the old Daoist who had not spoken or smiled from the beginning to the end had a gentle chess move. He was neither anxious nor impatient as he slowly planned.

Moreover, the game was only halfway through. When the stern old Daoist stopped with a piece, the kind old Daoist suddenly became extremely vexed.

“How could it be? How could he lose like this?”

At this time, she looked at Xi Qingchi and could not help but say, “It’s strange. The chess pieces should be black and white. How can you tell when you use the same color chess piece?”

When the amiable old Daoist heard this, his originally vexed expression also eased. He turned to look at Xi Qingchi. “You’re an interesting girl. Your heart is true and sincere. You’re a good seedling for cultivation.”

“My pieces don’t distinguish between black and white. There’s only one color. That’s because I’m waiting for a fated person to come and try with a black piece.”

Xi Qingchi pursed her lips and laughed. “Don’t tell me I have to prepare my own chess pieces when I play chess with you.”

The kind old Daoist shook his head with a smile and stopped talking. Instead, he turned around and messed up the chess pieces on the board. “Quick, let’s play another game, another game.”

The other old Daoist who had been silent the entire time finally spoke, “Again? You don’t have anything else to bet on me, you know?”

“Stop it. We don’t know who will win this round. Let’s hurry up.” The kind old Daoist took a stance and started a new round of fighting.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything and just stared at the new round of chess.

But soon, a similar scene played out again. The friendly old man was defeated again.

“That shouldn’t be the case. Why am I the one who lost again?” He scratched his head, his expression anxious.

A smug look appeared on the cold-faced old Daoist’s face. “You lost again, old man. Tell me, what are you going to give to me?”

The kind old Daoist looked dejected. He reached out and touched his body. Soon, he looked at Jian Wushuang for help, “My Young Friend, can you lend me something to pawn to that old thing? I will get him to compensate double when I beat him.”

“…”

Jian Wushuang opened his mouth and finally said, “What kind ofo item?”

“Anything is fine. It’s just to form a good relationship,” the kind old Daoist looked at him and said.

Since any item would do, Jian Wushuang thought for a moment and took out a pill with a strong aura from the Interspatial Ring.

“I’ll have to trouble Little Friend to stretch out your hand and rub the pill,” the kind old Daoist said with a smile.

Although it was a little strange, Jian Wushuang still did as he was told and handed him the pill that he had rubbed.

The kind old Daoist bowed and threw the pill to the cold-faced old Daoist. “Get lost.”

The cold-faced old Daoist caught the pill and stuffed it into his arms, then stood up and gave up his seat.

“Little Friend, while there’s still some time, why don’t we have a round?” The kind old Daoist also got up and made an inviting gesture.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing at the side with his arms crossed, was a little stunned.

This kind of invitation was like a public punishment for a lousy chess player like him, whom the even the Fengtian Patriarch could easily defeat.

“Umm, I’m not good at playing chess. It’s better if I don’t come forward and embarrass myself,” Jian Wushuang smiled embarrassedly and waved his hands.

The amiable old Daoist smiled and said, “It’s alright. The worst case scenario is just getting stuck. I’ll help you with some moves when you’re stuck.”

Under such an invitation, Jian Wushuang could not refuse and could only brace himself to take a seat.

“Little Friend, although this chess piece only has one color, it has its own changes. Only the player can see it.” He smiled and pointed at the chess pieces in the chessboard.

Slowly exhaling, Jian Wushuang put his finger into the chessboard and took out a white chess piece. He then placed it on the star position.

The white piece did not change, it was as white as jade.

The kind old Daoist’s gaze was fixed on the chess piece that had been placed. When he saw that there was no change, a touch of desolation and disappointment flashed in the depths of his eyes.

However, he returned to normal very quickly, and Jian Wushuang started fighting.

The outcome of the chess game that could be predicted before it even started naturally ended with Jian Wushuang’s defeat after a while.

“I’ve lost.” Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly.

“It’s fine, Little Friend. If you work hard in the future, you’ll definitely be able to compete with us.” The kind old Daoist stroked his beard and smiled.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and did not say anything. They had met by chance and traveled together. It was unlikely that they would see each other again after they left.

The kind old Daoist continued, “I owe you something. If we meet again in the future, I will return it to you in double.”

Although the pill was a Supreme Treasure, it was no different from an ordinary item to Jian Wushuang. It was really nothing, so he did not intend to take it back one day.
