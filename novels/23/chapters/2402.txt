Chapter 2403: Joining Forces

“Since we are a team, we should split the Purple Amulets evenly.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Xiao Heng accepted the Purple Amulet without being hypocritical.

“It’s only been an hour and we’ve already found two Purple Amulets, looks like there are really quite many of them out here. Let’s continue the search,” said Jian Wushuang.

They continued searching right away.

Time flew and three days flashed by.

In the past three days, disciples from various sects who entered Saint’s Tomb were mostly staying at the outer area, looking for Purple Amulets.

After all, there was always plenty of time when the Saint’s Tomb opened up. Even the most important opportunity of all, the final six positions to study Fengtian Scroll that would only appear individually one month later. Hence, the disciples were not in a hurry, and in normal circumstances, those disciples would spend more than ten days in the outer area.

After finding all the Purple Amulets they could discover ten days later, they would move towards the inner area.

There were a total of three Purple Amulets floating above a vast and desolate field.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures suddenly appeared in the field.

“Three Purple Amulets?”

Both who arrived were core disciples from Narcissus Island. Their eyes lit up when they saw the Purple Amulets and kept the amulets in their Interspatial Rings without hesitation.

“We found four of them before this and we now found three all in one go, which means we found a total of seven in just three days’ time. Seems like our luck isn’t so bad.” The two disciples were chatting, apparently feeling rather joyful.

However, right then...

“Hm, somebody’s here?” One of the purple-robed disciple’s eyes froze all of a sudden.

“The auras feel like one First-Class and two Second-Class Divine Demons!”

“Let’s get out of here!”

They left immediately without thinking twice after noticing three individual’s auras.

In the next moment, right after the two disciples left three figures appeared where they were.

“We were slightly late as they were ahead of us,” said the green-haired woman among the three.

“Too bad, I just sensed the aura of Purple Amulets. They were all taken by those two,” exclaimed another blonde-haired strong man with a large axe on his back.

So far, the last member of the group, a crimson-haired young man had not said a word.

The crimson-haired young man was the only First-Class Divine Demon among the three of them.

His incredibly evil and strange eyes with a shade of scarlet looked at the direction where those two disciples headed.

“If I didn’t see wrongly, aren’t those two disciples of Narcissus Island?” said the crimson-haired young man quietly.

The green-haired woman nodded. “Yes. Before we came here, I’ve gathered information on almost all the genius disciples from every sect. It’s true that the two who were just here are from Narcissus Island, but they were only Second-Class Divine Demon, not the best ones from the island. The best ones are Zhong Yi and Su Tong. They both entered Saint’s Tomb as well, so they’re probably close by.”

“Zhong Yi?” The crimson-haired young man’s face froze as soon as he heard that name. “More than ten years ago, when I was wandering and gaining experience, I had a run-in with him. His ability was slightly higher than mine and he had an assistant with him. I was badly defeated then. I’m still holding that grudge. Ten odd years have passed. Finally, I get to fight him again!”

“Senior Brother, are you thinking of seeking revenge in Saint’s Tomb?” The green-haired woman looked over.

“Of course. It’s a rare coincidence to run into Zhong Yi again, not to mention it’s inside Saint’s Tomb. How could I miss a rare chance such as this?” The crimson-haired young man sneered frostily.

“But Zhong Yi’s ability isn’t weak, furthermore, there are a total of ten genius disciples from Narcissus Island who entered Saint’s Tomb. They’re definitely not weaker than us Black Thunder Pavilion when it comes to numbers and general abilities. I’m afraid it’s probably not so easy if we were to provoke them,” said the green-haired lady.

“Hmph, it’s true that we from Black Thunder Pavilion can’t deter them, but can’t we look for some help?” The crimson-haired young man’s lips curved upwards.

“According to my knowledge, Na Shiyu from Cold Blood Palace is also close by. In addition, they have beef with Narcissus Island. The last time Saint’s Tomb was opened, two genius disciples from Cold Blood Palace were killed by men from Narcissus Island during the final fight for the six positions. The fight in Saint’s Tomb was ability-based, it was hard to avoid losses of personnel in the process. Cold Blood Palace did not make any remarks afterward either, but they wouldn’t feel good about it anyhow. Now that Saint’s Tomb is open once again, Cold Blood Palace definitely wouldn’t go soft on Narcissus Island if there’s a chance.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Other than that, Na Shiyu is a friend of mine. I have his message token. I’ll try looking for him now.”

After saying so, the crimson-haired young man immediately took out a token and began establishing communication.

“Tang Xiao, you wish to touch Narcissus Island in the outer area?” replied Na Shiyu to him at the first moment.

“That’s right, Narcissus Island’s total strength is pretty strong. I’m afraid that Black Thunder Pavilion wouldn’t be able to match them, hence I need you to give us a hand,” said the crimson-haired young man, Tang Xiao.

Na Shiyu fell silent for a moment and then answered, “Tang Xiao, I know you have some resentment against Zhong Yi from Narcissus Island. You’ve once lost to him big time, it’s only normal to seek revenge. However, we’re merely at the outer area of the Saint’s Tomb. All the disciples are just looking for some Purple Amulets. Don’t you think it’s a bit too flagrant to take action right now?”

It was truly normal and understandable for all sects when there were casualties and injuries during fights for opportunities in the Saint’s Tomb; for example, the competition for the final six positions.

However, that was obviously a provocation if two sects joined forces against Narcissus Island in the outer area.

After all, Narcissus Island was one of the top ten sects in Wusha Wilderness. In terms of foundation and abilities, Cold Blood Palace was nowhere near them. Na Shiyu naturally was a little worried about that.

“Moreover, Zhong Yi is the most outstanding genius disciple of Narcissus Island. He definitely has a safety token and with it, it’s impossible for you to kill him,” said Na Shiyu.

“I understand everything you say, I don’t plan to directly kill Zhong Yi. I merely want to give him a small lesson. For example, you and I, two great sects coming together and force Narcissus Island to give up some Purple Amulets. If possible, we could think of a way to force Zhong Yi into using his safety token, sending him out of Saint’s Tomb, and that would be all. In this way, he would’ve wasted his trip and I could get my revenge. As for the other Narcissus Island disciples, we could go easy on them by just hurting them and not kill them. Isn’t that easy?”

“So long as we don’t kill their disciples, even Narcissus Island can’t say anything. It would just be a brawl between disciples from both sides. We won’t do anything overboard,” said Tang Xiao.
