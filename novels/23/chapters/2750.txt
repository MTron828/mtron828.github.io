Jian Wushuang’s divine power would improve tremendously once he made a breakthrough to the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm as it would also bring about a great improvement in his overall strength. At that time, he should be able to calmly face Peak Grand Ultimate Gods in a duel.

“Fort Master, I shall be waiting for your news.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and immediately turned to leave.

Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen remained standing in place after Jian Wushuang left from being overwhelmed by what transpired.

“What do you think, Palace Keeper Si Zhen?” Yin Su’er looked at Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen replied, “It’s unbelievable. I could see Jian Yi had great talents when he first appeared in front of me, but his strength at that time was still rather weak so I can’t see the possibility of him influencing Crimson Stone Fort’s situation. However, only a few decades have passed since and he has already gained control over such a powerful force.”

Palace Keeper Si Zhen was indeed shocked and impressed.

Jian Wushuang had just shown them a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets which were equivalent to the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God, a very powerful High-level Grand Ultimate God, and two ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

No one in Crimson Sone Fort’s various factions or the Danyang Continent’s top forces dared trifle with such a strong lineup.

In addition, there were the treasures Jian Wushuang just took out...

“I was shocked the last time he took out the two hundred and thirty catties of Royal Blood Gem. This time around, he showed us such a valuable Holy Treasure that even Crimson Stone Fort is unable to produce. Even Crimson Stone Saint only had one Holy Treasure when he was still around.” There were various expressions shown on Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s face.

Yin Su’er also nodded solemnly. “I also feel it’s unbelievable. I think Saber Master’s strength is ranked top ten in the entire Danyang Continent, right? I might not even be able to kill him, but he’s now dead and his weapon is with Jian Yi. His death obviously has a lot to do with Jian Yi.

“This guy...definitely has some incredible techniques. I really don’t know how many secrets he’s hiding.”

“Fortunately, Crimson Stone Saint invited him to help you and is our friend and not a foe. Otherwise...” Palace Keeper Si Zhen narrowed his eyes.

Although Jian Wushuang only exuded the aura of a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God, both Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen dared not look down upon Jian Wushuang as his existence would deeply disturb them if Jian Wushuang were their enemy.

Yin Su’er solemnly said, “Regardless, Jian Yi now controls such a powerful force and the Sword Alliance seems to have risen very quickly. We may be able to gain heaps of benefits from this opportunity with his help. Palace Keeper Si Zhen, you should prepare as soon as possible now that Saber Master’s death isn’t known to many and while we still have time and the situation in Crimson Stone Fort is stable for the time being.”

“Yes.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen nodded.

Yin Su’er was deep in thought on dealing with the Holy Treasure Battle Saber given by Jian Wushuang and obtained 50,000 Divine elixir Pills for him.

...

Jian Wushuang immediately returned to the Sword Alliance after leaving the Sacred Palace.

He sat on the throne in the lofty hall while listening to Xiao Tiexin, Long Shan, and the others reporting on the many things happening in the Sword Alliance during his absence.

The Sword Alliance had long established itself amongst first-rated forces with its combat power growing stronger alongside the Divine Sword Army’s growth and expansion. It became extremely powerful among the first-rated forces that no one in the Danyang Continent dared to get on their wrong side.

Its overall strength was constantly improving due to the large number of resources being pumped in.

Jian Wushuang just nodded slightly after listening to their updates.

He had handed over the Sword Alliance’s management to Xiao Tiexin and the others a long time ago. Jian Wushuang might not have trusted the others completely, but he had absolute trust in Xiao Tiexin.

“All of you may go now. Xin’er, would you go and get Old Snake for me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin and the others immediately left.

Old Snake met Jian Wushuang not long after.

“Alliance Master.” Elder Snake humbly saluted Jian Wushuang.

“Old Snake, how are you doing in the Sword Alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“I think I’m doing fine, but matters aren’t as casual as before,” replied Old Snake.

Old Snake was an independent expert and used to be carefree. It was normal for him to feel a little uncomfortable while adapting to the changes after accepting Jian Wushuang’s invitation and becoming the First Elder in the Sword Alliance Elder’s Palace.

“Take your time to get used to it.” Jian Wushuang smiled before flipping his hand and taking out a pill.

“Old Snake, what do you think this is?” Jian Wushuang handed the pill to Old Snake.

Old Snake looked at the pill before his pupils shrank sharply.

“Such a potent majestic aura. Is this...the Huangji Golden Pill?” Old Snake sounded excited.

Huangji Golden Pill was extremely useful to Grand Ultimate God cultivators.

It was no different for Old Snake.

He had stayed at the Primary-level Grand Ultimate God realm for a long time and faced a bottleneck in his journey to make a breakthrough. The Huangji Golden Pill would be very helpful to him in improving his cultivation realm.

Under normal circumstances, the chance of a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God making a breakthrough and reaching the High-level Grand Ultimate God realm after swallowing the pill was around 30 percent.

However, Old Snake was stuck at the bottleneck for so many years that his pure divine power and perception of the laws and principles had reached the requirements for making a breakthrough. The probability of him making a breakthrough was at least 50 percent if he meticulously made preparations for the breakthrough!

The 50 percent chance of making a breakthrough was enough for Old Snake to do everything possible and fight for a Huangji Golden Pill.

It was even more so with the Huangji Golden Pill placed in front of him.

“Alliance Master, this Huangji Golden Pill...” Old Snake was very excited but looked a little hesitant as he dared not directly ask Jian Wushuang for the pill. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly before throwing the Huangji Golden Pill to Old Snake. “It’s of course for you since you’re the First Elder in the Sword Alliance Elder’s Palace and this Huangji Golden Pill is useful to you.”

Old Snake was trembling in disbelief, but immediately asked, “Are you really giving it to me? Alliance Master, don’t you need this Huangji Golden Pill?”

“Do I need it? It’s of no use to me.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled.

He was indeed telling the truth.

The Huangji Golden Pill had great effects on ordinary cultivators—be it a Heaven Ultimate God or a Grand Ultimate God.

However, its effect was minimal for Jian Wushuang.

“It’s nothing but just one Huangji Golden Pill. In addition, I have more than one.” Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately flipped his hand to take out four identical Huangji Golden Pills.
