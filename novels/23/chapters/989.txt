Chapter 990: The Bloody Moon

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Peace and order returned to the Tang Empire with the return of the Tang Emperor.

Having discovered the possible whereabouts of his father, Jian Wushuang was ready to leave immediately to seek him out.

He was only beginning to embark on his journey when the Dao Master Spirit came to him.

Many a great year ago, the Dao Master Spirit had once been shown kindness by the then-living Emperor Qing. In memory and gratitude of the grace she had received, she had come to help in the defense of the Empire when Emperor Xiao had requested for her aid.

“I am here to inform you that I have accomplished the deed as you bade me, Jian Wushuang.” The Dao Master Spirit handed to Jian Wushuang a scroll.

“Is the seal undone?” Jian Wushuang asked with joy and anticipation.

Jian Wushuang had chanced upon the scroll when he had slain Xia Yan, the second young master of the Xia Clan, at Cercis Island. Once belonging to Xia Yan, it was one of the most precious treasures that he had pillaged from his dead adversary.

The scroll was supposed to contain a powerful and destructive Sword Essence, making it a most valuable treasure to have in one’s possession.

But when Jian Wushuang had first laid his hands upon the scroll, he had discovered that the scroll was being guarded by a powerful magical seal. For many years, he was not able to undo the magic that guarded the scroll as he held back his fervent eagerness at his helplessness of not being able to defeat the seal.

Returning to the imperial city and meeting with the Dao Master Spirit had renewed him with hope: she might be able to break the seal.

As the greatest conjurer of magical formations across the vast terrains of the Green Fire World, the Dao Master Spirit was able to defeat the magic that guarded the scroll in only a few days.

“The magical seal that held the scroll was powerful indeed. I have exhausted a great deal to destroy the seal. But this scroll is indeed a rare treasure; one that I believe will surely be helpful in your endeavor now.” The Dao Master Spirit said.

“Thank you so much, Senior.” Jian Wushuang was very grateful.

“My pleasure. Moreover, I am curious; curious to see what heights you will one day achieve in the future.” The Dao Master Spirit beamed at him with a smile. “Well, now that the siege of the imperial city has been lifted and Empire is delivered from ruin and despair, I will now take my leave. Farewell, Jian Wushuang.”

With that, the Dao Master Spirit turned and left, swinging the sleeves of her robes as she spun.

Jian Wushuang immediately peered through the contents of the scroll.

He had reached the most important parts of what he was reading when his eyes widened with amazement.

“Oh my, there are actually 19 complete Sword Principles in this scroll?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed with delight.

It was a truly powerful swordsman who had, with great strength and effort, inscribed the complete teachings of all 19 Sword Principles into this scroll.

Moreover, that was hardly all. The scroll had also contained illustrations and sketches depicting the application of the swordsmanships in combat.

It was as if the all 19 Sword Principles were thoroughly displayed in their fullness before Jian Wushuang.

“This is great, this is great indeed!” Jian Wushuang burst with joy and disbelief.

“Being at the pinnacle of the Eternal Realm, my next course of action for advancement will be to forge a Sword Principle of my own to achieve the rank of Dao Master. Long before, I have assimilated the acumen of forging the Strongest Sword Principle that Dao Yuanzi had left behind. And now, I have the scroll containing 19 complete disciplines of Sword Principles with details illustrations of their use in combat!”

“There are ten ordinary-leveled Principles, six Universe-leveled Principles, and three Creation-leveled Principles in all. Despite not being the most powerful and strongest of Sword Principles, they are all invaluable to me nonetheless.”

“I have always been gifted with using the sword. With the assimilated acumen of forging the Strongest Sword Principle and these 19 Sword Principles, it will not be long for me to create my own Sword Principle. I might even be able to forge the Strongest Sword Principle of my own!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with confidence.

On the very same day, Jian Wushuang went to meet with his Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian.

Standing before the huge mouth of a spatial wormhole,

“Are you truly adamant on going to the Samsara Continent, Junior Brother?” Xue Lingtian asked with chagrin, distressed for the safety of his fellow disciple.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Very well. The wormhole is opened to you now. Then again, I do not know where will this wormhole lead you upon the Samsara Continent. The Samsara Continent is, after all, under the dominion of the Samsara Temple. The Void Temple holds no sway there. Be extremely careful there.” Xue Lingtian warned.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang replied with a cheerful chuckle as he stepped into the wormhole before him.

With the flash of a light, Jian Wushuang’s figure dissolved out of sight.

…

In a land shrouded by darkness and gloom.

It was in the deep of night where the moon shone richly in blood crimson red over fields of the antiquated Earth. The fetid air reeked strongly of blood and malice.

This was the Samsara Continent; a land where only the law of jungle reigned supreme. The way of life that was more brutal and cruel that the Void Continent could never hope to compete.

The space in the air over a barren field ruptured suddenly, revealing a crack that issued the figure of a person who shot out swiftly into open.

Wearing a crimson robe made of the Blood-killing Plate Armor and the Blood Mountain Sword carried over his back, Jian Wushuang had finally stepped upon the Samsara Continent.

“Am I now in the Samsara Continent?” Jian Wushuang cast his sights around him curiously.

He found himself standing in the middle of a wide meadow, there was nothing but emptiness all around him, save for the silhouette of mountains many leagues away in the gloom of night.

“The moon! It is blood red!”

Jian Wushuang looked up at the sky and a smile lined over his lips. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Different continents have varying environmental properties. It appeared that the heavenly bodies seen from the Samsara Continent were different to that of the Void Continent.

Yet, the primal rule of the survival of the fittest applied everywhere..

“Just reaching this Continent, I am barely familiar with anything around here. I need to first find a place to settle down before I begin to search for the Golden-clothed Deacon of the Samsara Temple.”?Jian Wushuang decided.

All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang felt the air quivered: a jet of energy blast had shot through the air nearby.

It had originated from a site far away from where Jian Wushuang stood. It was due to his powerful senses that he could feel it.

“I-is, is there a battle taking place there?”

With a curious twitch of his brows, Jian Wushuang sped swiftly towards the point of origin of the energy blast.

He reached before a battlefield, finding the dangerous flickers of steel and fire shimmering relentlessly in the midst of night as men fought and cried in a fierce and brutal battle!

There were hundreds of thousands of people fighting against one another!

“Kill them all!”

“On this day, the Heavenly Ape Clan will be utterly destroyed! Kill every one of them! Spare no quarter!”

“Hahahaha! Kill them all! Kill them all!”

Screams and cries of killing resounded across the gloomy vista hemmed by the din of clashing steels and the sporadic shrieks and howls of pain and agony.

The people crying and screaming in anguish were mostly children and women.

Witnessing the carnage and bloodthirstiness of the slaughter, Jian Wushuang could not help but grimaced with an inexplicable pain.

This was not a battle. This was a massacre!
