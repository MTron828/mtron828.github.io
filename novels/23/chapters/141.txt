Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Ouyang Haoyue had only taken a few steps when a figure suddenly appeared in front of him.

“You are Ouyang Haoyuan, the 21st warrior at the Earthly Dragon List?” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“Em?” Ouyang Haoyue shot a glance at Jian Wushuang in front of him.

“I have wanted to join the Earthly Dragon List for a long time. But unfortunately, I haven’t run into any of the experts on the list. How lucky I am to meet you today! Let’s fight!” Jian Wushuang directly said.

Hearing these words, the numerous surrounding warriors burst into an uproar.

“He is coming for a challenge.”

“Another one who is not afraid of death.”

“There are so many experts on the Earthly Dragon List. Su Lie, who ranks 94th, is also here. Yet, instead of Su Lie, he chooses to challenge Ouyang Haoyue, the 22nd! He is either a real expert or a complete idiot.”

Many surrounding warriors began talking.

After being challenged by Jian Wushuang in front of so many people, Ouyang Haoyue looked a little gloomy.

“Where are you from, idiot. Do you know nothing? Get out of my way!”

The cyan saber in Ouyang Haoyue’s hand immediately slashed towards Jian Wushuang with towering force.

A slight upturn was seen at the corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth. He immediately reached out with his right hand the moment Ouyang Haoyue swung his saber. A vast amount of Earth Essence was gathered into Jian Wushuang’s palm, taking on a physical form as he immediately grasped the slashing cyan saber.

Bang!

A muffled sound was heard. The blade of that cyan saber could not even scratch the earthen glow surrounding Jian Wushuang’s palm. With the saber gripped in Jian Wushuang’s hand, Ouyang Haoyue could not budge it at all.

“What?”

“My God!”

“What am I seeing?”

Many of the surrounding warriors were stunned.

How powerful was this attack from Ouyang Haoyue, who ranked 21st on the Earthly Dragon List?

Undoubtedly, it could easily kill a warrior in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

Yet, such a powerful saber attack was now completely held in his bare hand?

It was possible if Jian Wushuang was wearing some gloves or fist covers, but there was nothing covering his hand. He simply grabbed Ouyang Haoyue’s saber?

What did that mean?

“How can this be?” Ouyang Haoyue himself was astonished.

Although that slash had not used his full power, it was still more than a common warrior in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm could handle. However, The man in front of him had easily grasped the blade with his bare hand!

“You are ranked 21st on the Early Dragon List, yet your strength is only this much?” Still hiding his face under the bamboo hat, Jian Wushuang gave out a sneer.

“Go to hell!”

Ouyang Haoyue was enraged at Jian Wushuang’s insult. A horrible current of Spiritual Power arose. A powerful blast of Blade Essence of Raging Fire suddenly erupted from the cyan saber, forcing back Jian Wushuang’s palm.

Immediately after, Ouyang Haoyue reclaimed his saber, immediately attacking again.

Swoosh!

The blade flash was sharp and explosive, containing a terrible fury that made the numerous warriors in the area instantly turn pale from fear.

Ouyang Haoyue had put his full strength into this slash.

But the result was...

Bang!

A palm appeared in front of the saber a second time, grasping it once more. The Blade Essence was instantly broken and the cyan saber was trapped in Jian Wushuang’s hand again.

“Impossible! ”

Ouyang Haoyue was really seized with terror and fury.

The first slash was wielded randomly, so it meant nothing although Jiang Wushuang could grasp it with his bare hand.

But this time, he had used his full strength. Yet, the result was the same, he grasped it with his bare-hand?

Stopping the saber with his bare-hand, twice in a row?

What kind of strength is this?

What he did not know was that Jian Wushuang had improved his sword essence comprehension immensely over the two years in the Sword Tomb.

Especially the Sword Essence of Earth. Although it had not been combined with the Fiery Wind Sword Essence, it had become the most powerful among the four sword essences he had comprehended. Jian Wushuang was even confident that, with only the Sword Essence of Earth, he could easily pass the 11th floor of the Dragon Gate.

Such profound comprehension in Earth Essence, which was good at defense, was intensely gathered in his palm. It is no surprise that Ouyang Haoyue’s attack could not break it.

“Hehe, the 21st warrior on the Earthly Dragon List was just so-so.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, then moved his palm a little. A vast current of the Earth Essence erupted and a terrifying force rushed out. At the same time, Ouyang Haoyue’s cyan saber was completely bent in Jian Wushuang’s hand, and then became an out-and-out twist.

Casually throwing aside that cyan saber he had turned into scrap metal, Jian Wushuang grinned and then punched Ouyang Haoyue’s chest.

“Puff!”

A mouthful of blood spurted out as Ouyang Haoyue brutally flew backwards like a kite with a broken string, immediately cracking the ground with his heavy landing. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The whole street became very silent.

Everybody who witnessed the scene was in shock.

Jian Wushuang slowly walked towards Ouyang Haoyue, and said in a low voice, “Ouyang Haoyue, with such strength, are you qualified to be the 21st on the Earthly Dragon List? How ridiculous! You are far weaker than Xiao Mang!”

What Jian Wushuang said was the truth, because he had fought against Xiao Mang. In terms of real strength, Xiao Mang was definitely much stronger than Ouyang Haoyue. But, because the former had kept a low profile and rarely fought against others, his rank remained 22nd for a long time.

“You! Who on earth are you?” Ouyang Haoyue tightly stared at Jian Wushuang.

“You mentioned Xiao Mang? He is a low-key person who hardly ever fights with others. His most recent fight was two years ago and it caused a big commotion. He fought against Swordsman, who died...”

Before he finished the story, Ouyang Haoyue suddenly widened his eyes and then shouted with fear, “You are Swordsman!”

“What?” The entire street was shocked.

Swordsman?

The guy who turned the whole Tianzong Dynasty upside down two years ago?

Swordsman, an “exceptional genius” that rarely appeared every few decades, who was listed in the Millennium Chronicle compiled by the Gladiator Arena?

Everyone was familiar with the name “Swordsman.”

But now, Ouyang Haoyue said that this mysterious man wearing a bamboo hat in front of everyone was the same Swordsman?

“Swordsman?” Su Lie abruptly raised his head, gazing at Jian Wushuang.

Everyone on the street looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang, who hid his face under the bamboo hat, slightly curled the corners of his mouth at this moment, and then directly threw away the bamboo hat. As he raised his head, a cold but handsome face appeared.

Meanwhile, his voice, with a little arrogance, was heard echoing on the entire street.

“I’m not Swordsman!”

“My name is Jian Wushuang! ”

“With a sword in hand, no one is my match!”

“Remember that!”
