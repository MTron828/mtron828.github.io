Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the Ancient God Palace, at the place of registration for the examination.

“Your name?” an old married woman sitting behind a desk said.

“Gu Jian,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Which King do you wish to be under?” the old married woman continued to question him.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly and he complained in his mind: “King of Venomous Worms, you did not tell me that such a question would be asked during registration.”

“I have not been to the Ancient God Sanctuary for so many years. How could I know the Ancient God Palace would change its rules?” the King of Venomous Worms curled his lips and said.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders and took a deep breath, “King Gu Tong.”

Jian Wushuang was unable to confirm whether King Gu Tong was a Royal Ancient God of the Gu King City. However, since he did not know of any other kings, he could only summon up his courage and try his luck.

“King Gu Tong?” the old married woman raised her head and glanced at Jian Wushuang with surprise. However, she still wrote down the name Gu Jian on a jade bamboo strip, “Take this jade bamboo strip and come back thirty years later to participate in the assessment.”

“Thank you very much,” Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief. After taking the jade bamboo strip, he left immediately.

“Looks like King Gu Tong is indeed a Seven-star Ancient God of the Gu King City,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“Perhaps so,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Oh right. King of Venomous Worms, you said that the Secret Skills and close-quarter combat Unique Skills that are suitable for an Ancient God like me to learn are within the Ancient God Palace. However, what kind of Secret Skills and Unique Skills are there?” Jian Wushuang questioned with curiosity.

He had only come for the sake of the Secret Skills and Unique Skills. As such, he needed to have a basic understanding of the Secret Skills and Unique Skills.

“In the Ancient God Clan, the Three Secret Skills and the Four Unique Skills are best suited for Five-star, Six-star and even Seven-star Ancient Gods!”

“The Three Secret Skills are the Thunder Attracting Skill, Star Destruction Skill and the Moon Picking Skill!”

“The Three Secret Skills are known as remarkable abilities that can shake the whole universe. Back then, as an Eight-star Ancient God, my old Master King Luo Zhen had mastered these Three Secret Skills completely. Moreover, these Three Secret Skills were one of the greatest powers that he relied on.”

“As for the Four Unique Skills, they are skills used specially for close-quarters combat. They are similar to those Unique Skills created by human beings by comprehending the Power of Heaven Way. However, the Ancient Gods are strong in terms of their bodies and the strength that they possess. As for the Power of Heaven Way, they have never really studied it. Hence, within the Ancient God Clan, there are very few people who are able to comprehend the Power of Heaven Way. Even if they were able to comprehend it, they would only be able to comprehend a general portion of it.”

“However, even without the aid of the Power of Heaven Way, with just the unreasonable Power of Bloodline within their own bodies and these Four Unique Skills, the clansmen of the Ancient Gods would not be weaker than a human being of similar realm. Moreover, they might even be slightly stronger,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang exclaimed in admiration.

The Ancient God Clan possessed powerful bodies, which were their greatest advantage.

However, their comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way was incomparable to human beings’.

In spite of that, even without comprehending the Power of Heaven Way at all, the Ancient Gods could also possess unparalleled abilities. Not only that, they could also achieve a level that could be compared to the human beings’ Almighties and even Emperor-level super experts.

“The finger-type Ancient God Unique Skill that I grasped as a result of obtaining the Memory of Inheritance previously, is it considered one of the Four Unique Skills?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That’s right. The finger skill that you grasped is the Ancient God’s Finger of the Ancient God Clan’s Four Unique Skills. However, what you have obtained is merely the first six fingers of the Ancient God’s Finger. Under normal circumstances, a Six-star Ancient God would be able to use these six fingers. However, there are still three final fingers remaining for this finger skill and they can only be used by Seven-star Ancient Gods,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“As expected. There are three stronger fingers,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened up.

Among the Unique Skills of the Ancient God Clan, he had quite a good understanding of the Ancient God’s Finger. Moreover, the Ancient God’s Finger was indeed powerful and it even became Jian Wushuang’s strongest attack move at one point in time. However, within the Ancient God Clan, there were still three other Unique Skills and the Three Secret Skills which could be compared to the Ancient God’s Finger.

As he thought about it, Jian Wushuang started to feel excited.

“I have to pass that assessment thirty years later and enter the Ancient God Palace!” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly.

For the thirty years, Jian Wushuang had stayed within the Gu King City and trained quietly.

To Jian Wushuang of that very moment, thirty years’ time was just a split second and it would be over quickly.

In the Ancient God Palace, there were hundreds of figures standing on the drill ground.

There were males and females among the figures. However, their physiques were big in general. Jian Wushuang was within the crowd as well. Compared to others, his body was obviously a lot ‘smaller.’

“Isn’t there a lot of people?” Jian Wushuang was looking at the surrounding people.

All those people were Ancient Gods. Moreover, they were Five-star Ancient Gods who had cleared the Ancient God Test of the Third Heaven. Hence, in terms of realm, they were the same as Jian Wushuang.

Swoosh!

An indifferent man, who was above five meters tall and glowing with silver light, appeared in front of everyone.

The indifferent man was a Six-star, silver-armored Ancient God and he was equivalent to a Real God of human beings. Moreover, he was an Eternal Real God.

“The assessment this time around will consist of three stages. Those who are able to pass all three stages will be able to stay in the Ancient God Palace. As for failures, you can come back again after ten thousand years,” the indifferent man’s voice spread across the crowd.

All the Ancient Gods on the martial arts training ground could not help but clench their fists.

The Ancient God assessment. Although it would be held once every hundred years, if the participating Ancient Gods failed the assessment this time around, they would have to wait for another ten thousand years before being able to participate in the assessment a second time. That was the Ancient God Palace’s rules.

“Jian Wushuang, let me remind you that this is the Ancient God Clan and you are participating in the Ancient God assessment. Hence, during the assessment later, you had better not use your Divine Power as well as the comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way. You have to use only Ancient God Power and techniques of Ancient Gods to pass this assessment,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Now, let the first assessment begin,” the indifferent man’s voice spread throughout the area.

The expressions of all the Ancient Gods on the martial arts training ground became serious and they were also extremely nervous.

However, the indifferent man only announced the start of the first assessment, not its content. At the moment when all the Ancient Gods were feeling puzzled.

Rumble~~~

A frightening power exerted pressure on everyone.

The power contained pressure from an extremely pure Bloodline, as well as aura, and it was placed on top of everyone like a lofty mountain.

The Real Gods on the martial arts training ground were under great pressure from the weight and some of them were caught by surprise. Hence, four of them crouched down straight away. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

By crouching down, they had failed the assessment.

“What powerful pressure. This pressure should be released by top Six-star Ancient Gods which are equivalent to Chaotic Real Gods of the human beings. Moreover, the Bloodline of this Ancient God is extremely pure and he should be a Gold-armored Ancient God,” Jian Wushuang said.

As the people present were only Five-star Ancient Gods, they naturally had difficulty resisting the pressure released by a top Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God with his full power.
