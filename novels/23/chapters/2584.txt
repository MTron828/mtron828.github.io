Chapter 2585: New Territorial Lord

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Crimson Stone Fort is currently extremely chaotic with quite a few factions that aren’t on good terms with no apparent authority at all. They are also losing their control over Danyang Holy Domain. Due to this, Crimson Stone Fort has set many rules that don’t make sense. These inspectors won’t dare to act so unscrupulously when collecting benefits in the past, but now they have no qualms at all.”

“If that inspector just now has a good backer, he could really use his authority to increase the Northern Darkstar Territory’s levy,” said Cang Heng.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

He also knew the Crimson Stone Fort was being torn apart since the falling of Crimson Stone Saint. Although Crimson Stone Saint’s daughter, Yin Su’er controlled the Crimson Stone Fort, she did not have much power and was in a very bad situation.

Nonetheless, Jian Wushuang had not expected that Yin Su’er was in such hot soup.

There were so many factions within Crimson Stone Fort competing with one another. No wonder it was in a mess.

“Northern Darkstar Territory is a huge Stellar Region after all. The amount of money paid by those sects and clans every thousand years will be an astronomical figure and under normal circumstances, even obtaining the remaining thirty percent was quite a lot for an ordinary Earth Ultimate God after handing seventy percent over to Crimson Stone Fort. However, if the levy is increased by another twenty percent and becomes ninety percent instead you will only obtain the piteous amount of ten percent.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and then looked at Cang Heng. “I only need to pay the levy every thousand years to Crimson Stone Fort while the wealth I gained by other means such as gifts from the clans after becoming the Territorial Lord is not included to be levied, right?”

“Of course.” Cang Heng nodded. “Except for the every thousand-year levy, the wealth you have accumulated on your own regardless of the reason had nothing to do with Crimson Stone Fort. As long as there’s no chaos in Northern Darkstar Territory, you can accumulate wealth as you like. This is why many experts are very keen to be a Territorial Lord.”

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He did not care much about the every thousand-year levy.

A thousand years was too long after all and he would probably choose to leave the Northern Darkstar Territory before that time to explore bigger places. His strength would have also increased by multiple folds at that time and would not care for such meager money by that time.

He could care less whether the Inspector used despicable means to make things difficult for him.

He had chosen to be a Territorial Lord because it would help him to collect a large number of Primordial Stones in a short period which could be used to improve his strength.

“Commander Cang Heng, go and spread the news that I will host a banquet in this mansion half a month later. Every sect and clan in Northern Darkstar Territory is invited,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.”

Cang Heng immediately went to work.

The various clans, sects, and powers in Northern Darkstar Territory’s wilderness have long been informed that Jian Wushuang was about to become the new Territorial Lord. They had also prepared gifts with some even sending their people on standby at Northern Darkstar Territory for the news to be announced.

Therefore, those families and the sects in the wilderness began to act the very moment Cang Heng started spreading the news.

Half a month later, the Territorial Lord Mansion was filled with visitors.

All those sects from various wildernesses sent their gifts in advance.

Half a month later, Jian Wushuang held a large-scale banquet in the Territorial Lord Mansion.

All the clans within Northern Darkstar Territory were showing Jian Wushuang great courtesy by having either their clan leaders or very powerful people from their clans in attendance. Many other lonely experts had also attended the banquet.

As for those sects in the wilderness, only a few extremely strong sects managed to attend the banquet while those that failed to attend still sent gifts nonetheless.

The banquet was lively and lasted for a full day and night before everyone started leaving.

The Territorial Lord Mansion was quiet once again.

In the magnificent hall, Jian Wushuang sat there leaning on an armchair while Xiao Tiexin and Cang Heng stood in front of him.

“Xin’er, have you recorded all those gifts from the clans and sects?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Xiao Tiexin nodded before slowly said, “Yes, I’ve counted them. First of all, the cultivation resources include elixirs, various Ground Treasures, and Heavenly Treasures. There are also some divine weapons and armor with all added up to more than two million four hundred thousand Primordial Stones.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned by the surprise.

“Furthermore, perhaps the news has spread far and wide that you prefer Primordial Stone hence those clans and sects of each wilderness sent a very large number of Primordial Stone which are much more than cultivation resources. They are worth six million eight hundred thousand Primordial Stones altogether!” Xiao Tiexin said.

“Six million eight hundred thousand? That much?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed and suddenly stood up.

Yes, it was quite a lot.

A total of six million eight hundred thousand!

Even their total assets of top-tier clans like Shi Clan, Wu Clan, and Situ Clan—excluding the Earth Ultimate Gods behind them—were estimated to be only about four to five million Primordial Stones. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He simply held a banquet after becoming the Territorial Lord and the results were gifts from those clans and sects which added up to 6,800,000 of Primordial Stones which were worth much more than assets of those top-tier clans.

If he counted the cultivation resources which were worth about 2,400,000 Primordial Stones. There were nearly 10,000,000 Primordial Stones!

He got nearly 10,000,000 Primordial Stones in one go from just a single banquet!

“No wonder so many people wanted the Territorial Lord position. What a great feeling to be a despot,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

There were so many wildernesses under Northern Darkstar Territory. Take the Wusha Wilderness as an example, the Great Compassion Sect was the most powerful sect among the many sects in Wusha Wilderness and they paid up one thousand Primordial Stones every thousand years. The amount paid by those smaller sects might not be as much as the Great Compassionate Sect but were still worth a few hundred Primordial Stones for each of the sects. Each wilderness would have to pay around 20,000 to 30,000 Primordial Stones every thousand years after adding up every big and small sect.

The total amount added up from the many wildernesses was probably 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 Primordial Stones.

It should be more after including those clans within the Northern Darkstar Territory.

Although it was only a banquet held by the new Territorial Lord and not the real levy, those clans and sects were more generous as it was the first time they offered gifts to the new Territorial Lord. This was why Jian Wushuang received a huge sum of nearly ten million Primordial Stones!
