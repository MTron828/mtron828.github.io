Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Starless City of the Divine Monster Territory.

The inauguration ceremony for the third supervisor of the Samsara Temple would be held in the Starless City, the busiest city in Divine Monster Territory.

The city was filled to the brim with travelling experts, and was heavily guarded.

More than half of the top experts throughout the Samsara Continent had gathered in the city.

Everyone who had recieved an invitation had to come to show pay their respects, even some uncivilized ones such as the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

Experts from all parties had gathered, in the large camp at the center of The Starless City.

Among them were experts from the four top Clans, including the Ancient Demon Clan, the Python Clan and the Xue Feng Clan. Most of the representative that came were the best in their clans.

In addition, the Clan Leaders of the Python Clan and the Blood Phenix Clan brought with them lavish gifts.

The strongest expert of the Ancient Demon Clan didn’t come, but two of their Holy Masters were present.

The two were Holy Master Dong Ming and Holy Master Lei Yi!

“The Ancient Demon Clan actually sent two Holy Masters for this?”

Experts from all parties in the camp couldn’t help staring.

Among all the clans in the Samsara Continent, only the Ancient Demon Clan and the Blood Asura Clan had two Holy Masters. The Python Clan and the Xu Feng Clan had only one Holy Master each, even tough they were both top clans. This difference was huge.

“Holy Master Lei Yi, the madman…”

“Holy Master Lei Yi willingly wandered in the Impasse for thousands of years. I didn’t expect to see him here.”

The experts were all gossiping to each other, and the focus of some of the whispering was on the red-haired elder of the Ancient Demon Clan, whose gaze was sharp as an eagle’s.

He was Holy Master Lei Yin, who became a famous top expert many years ago.

In terms of strength, Holy Master Lei Yi was more powerful than Holy Master Dong Ming, and among the three Holy Masters of the Ancient Demon Clan, he ranked the second.

Suddenly…

Whoosh!

Three men fell from the sky and landed in the camp.

Their sudden appearance captured everyone’s attention.

There was a young red-robed man with a longsword strapped to his back, a black-robed girl with a gorgeous face and a large man with a figure like a bear.

As a Holy Master, the strong man was the most powerful of the three. He, however, walked in the back respectfully. The young man with the longsword and the black-robed girl walked ahead of him, shoulder to shoulder.

“They’re with the Blood Asura Clan. The girl is the Holy Emperor of the Asuras!”

“Holy Emperor of the Asuras rules the Blood Asura Clan. She isn’t very powerful, but she has awakened the Eye of Asura which allows her to control many experts. The Holy Master behind her, is under her control.”

“She controls the Holy Master? That’s impressive!”

“Who is the man by her side?”

“He, he can’t be… Jian Wushuang?”

“Yes! Yes! It is Jian Wushuang!!!”

Everyone’s gaze turned to the red-robed man with the longsword at those cries.

Their interested in the mysterious Jian Wushuang was so strong that they even ignored Su Rou, the Holy Emperor of the Asuras.

“That’s Jian Wushuang? The man who shook the entire Divine Monster Territory?”

“He’s said to be of merely Eternal Realm, but he managed to survive a joint attack by the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and Holy Master Dong Ming of the Ancient Demon Clan. Holy Emperor of the Asuras helped him, true, but he was still alive after being hit by the Patriarch of Empryrean Glory three times!”

“Do you know the Ninth-Sword Dao Master of the Ancient Demon Clan? He was captured alive by Jian Wushaung and hasn’t been released yet.”

A heated discussion continued.

Jian Wushaung and Su Rou heard them and smiled secretly, but otherwise, they had no reaction.

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

In a corner of the camp, the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, dressed in a black robe, clenched his fists and glared at Jian Wushuang, veins throbbing on his forehead.

He was desperate to avenge his son. If he was strong enough, he would kill Jian Wushuang.

Unfortunately, he tried to kill Jian Wushaung 120 years ago and failed. He knew killing Jian Wushuang would be too much to hope for now.

Also, due to their agreement, he had no choice but to let go of his hatred.

So now, even though every bone in his body told him to, he didn’t attack Jian Wushuang. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

On the other side of the camp, Holy Master Lei Yi and Holy Master Dong Ming from the Ancient Demon Clan spied Jian Wushuang. Holy Master Lei Yi strode toward him first.

Holy Master Dong Ming frowned and followed.

“You are Jian Wushuang?”

Holy Master Lei Yi asked in a cold and deep voice. He wasn’t asking loudly, but his dangerous tone cut through all the other voices in the camp. The whole place fell silent.

Everyone turned to look at him.

Jian Wushuang and Su Rou, stopped in their tracks. Jian Wushuang looked up at the man standing in front of him.

A red-haired man stared at him coldly with burning eyes.

“Brother, he’s Holy Master Lei Yi from the Ancient Demon Clan. Speaking of strength, he’s more powerful than Holy Master Dong Ming and Lin Li. He also has a violent temper.” Su Rou said in a low voice.

“Are you from the Ancient Demon Clan?” Jian Wushuang said smilingly.

Experts on the looked on at the scene with confused expressions.

“It’s Holy Master Lei Yi!”

“I know it’s him!”

“He’s famous for his violent temper. He is the most irritable among three Holy Masters of the Ancient Demon Clan. When I saw him here, I knew things were going to get interesting.”

“Jian Wushuang has kept Ninth-Sword Dao Master in captivity for over a hundred years, but the Ancient Demon Clan hasn’t responded yet. Based on Holy Master Lei Yi’s temper, I don’t he’ll do nothing.”

“Let’s just watch.”

Other experts watched this with amusement as well, and no one had any plans to step in.

“Boy, I’m asking you something!”

The Holy Master glared at Jian Wushuang and demanded, “Aren’t you that lowborn bastard, Jian Wushuang, with a dirty bloodline. Are you the son of an insignificant slut from the Ancient World?”
