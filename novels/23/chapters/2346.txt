Chapter 2347: Secret Skills Mastered

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

From this day onwards, the Xiang Family paid careful attention to Jian Wushuang’s whereabouts.

However, shortly after that battle ended, Jian Wushuang shut himself away in cultivation.

He was still in the Lin Mansion but had gone to Lin Tiefeng to request some cultivation resources that he required.

The Lin Mansion felt sincere gratitude toward Jian Wushuang. Now that Jian Wushuang had requested some cultivation resources, Lin Mansion naturally tried their very best to gather them.

After a few days, Lin Mansion completed gathering these resources.

Relying on these resources, Jian Wushuang started cultivating the Secret Skill of Seven Star, Punisher God and Exquisite Pagoda.

Time passed rapidly and soon it was three months later.

Within the meeting hall of Lin Mansion:

“Over the last three months, the Zhuge Family has been a lot more honest and not resorted to any underhanded means. Moreover, they have been restricting their disciples and experts,” Lin Ao commented.

“They aren’t silly and know that, if they continue in this way, they’ll perish with the Lin Family,” Lin Tiefeng sneered.

“Although the Zhuge Family doesn’t seem to be doing anything, the Xiang Family has been active over this period,” Lin Ao reported.

“Xiang Family?” Lin Tiefeng was surprised.

Compared to the Zhuge Family, he was more fearful of the Xiang Family.

After all, the Xiang Family had a deep background and was considered to be among the top of the six elite families. They were also substantially stronger than the Zhuge Family and Lin Family.

Moreover, the Xiang Family had always been domineering. Now that they had suffered under Lin Family, it would probably not be possible for them to let this slide.

At this moment...

Swoosh!

A figure darted in.

“Family Head, we have got news from the Xiang Family that Xiang Yi is back,” Lin Family’s Elder reported anxiously.

“Xiang Yi?” Lin Tiefeng’s expression darkened instantly.

“Xiang Yi from the Xiang Family?” Fire Fairy also furrowed her brows. “I heard of Xiang Yi previously. He’s an Enforcement Elder of the Golden Cauldron Sect and a true Second Grade Divine Demon!”

“Second Grade Divine Demon?” All the experts around gasped in surprise.

In a place like Anjiu Prefecture, a Chaotic Divine Demon would be an overlord-like existence.

Even within the Wusha Barren Region, they could be considered experts. This was because they were only a handful of experts that were above the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm.

However, Chaotic Divine Demon Realm could also be separated into distinct classifications.

For example, the lowest level would be Third Grade Divine Demon.

This was the most ordinary Divine Demon, and Divine Demon Realm experts in various families of Anjiu Prefecture were almost certainly Third Grade Divine Demons. For example, the one in-charge of Zhuge Family and Lin Family would be at this level. Lin Tiefeng could barely be considered an elite among Third Grade Divine Demons.

As for Second Grade Divine Demons, they were above Third Grade Divine Demons. Their overall strength was substantially stronger as well.

As for First Grade Divine Demons, they were even more powerful. In various sects throughout the Wusha Barren Region, First Grade Divine Demons were extremely rare. They were all influential figures possessing great authority.

Also, there seemed to be a class known as Strongest Divine Demon above the First Grade Divine Demon. It was just that they were pathetically few and therefore the classification wasn’t often used.

Without a doubt, a Second Grade Divine Demon would be invincible in a place like Anjiu Prefecture as long as the Commandery Governor didn’t get involved.

“Xiang Yi is definitely after Jian Wushuang. This is going to be trouble,” Lin Tiefeng commented solemnly.

The experts around Zhuo Yunfeng were equally distraught.

“Quick! Let’s inform Jian Wushuang first. Ask him to stop his private cultivation and come out,” Lin Tiefeng instructed.

Jian Wushuang had been in secret room in Lin Mansion for the last three months.

Although he had his eyes shut, he wore a faint smile.

Moreover, within his consciousness sea where boundless soul power gathered, a transparent and exquisite pagoda was forming gradually.

The pagoda wasn’t huge but had enclosed all of Jian Wushuang’s soul power. If there was an incoming soul attack, it would have to break the defence of the pagoda first. However, the defence of the pagoda was extremely tough.

“The Exquisite Pagoda is the move that focuses on soul defence among the Five Great Secret Skills of the Seven Star Black Sect!”

“Although this is just the first tier and is only capable of preliminary soul defence, it will be sufficient to deal with soul attacks from some experts.”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and his smile deepened.

For cultivators, the soul was the core. The protection of one’s soul was naturally an essential thing.

In his previous life, he had tried all means to increase the defence of his soul. In the end, he had obtained the Five Gem Armor and Soul Swallowing Pearl. Those had greatly enhanced his soul defence and therefore allowed him to run amok easily.

In this life, despite losing his treasures, his soul defence could be considered powerful with just the Exquisite Pagoda.

“Other than the Exquisite Pagoda. I have also mastered the first scroll of Secret Skill of Seven Star with those cultivation resources. In the aspect of Punisher God, I could also form a God Statue of a thousand feet. With both secret skills, my battle strength has increased exponentially!”

“Also, in the three months of cultivation, my divine power has become purer and powerful.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist and was feeling the visibly stronger power he possessed.

Undoubtedly, he was way stronger than he had been three months ago.

If he had been feeling some stress facing the three Divine Demons from the Xiang Family previously, it would be like a walk in the park now.

At this moment, he received a message from his father.

“Oh? There’s news from the Xiang Family?”

Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow and left the secret room for the meeting hall.

In the meeting hall, numerous experts of the Lin Mansion, including some experts that were invited, had gathered.

Naturally, a large number of experts had left after receiving the promised remuneration for the battle against Zhuge Family. Among them was the Mad Lion.

“Father.”

Jian Wushuang walked to Zhuo Yunfeng and greeted him. As for the rest, he simply glanced at them in a gesture of acknowledgement.

No one in the meeting hall would find Jian Wushuang to be arrogant.

“Nephew Wushaung.” Lin Tiefeng was the first to speak. “You spent the last three months cultivating behind closed doors. Now that you are out, I believe you are a lot stronger than before, right?”

Everyone in the meeting hall turned towards Jian Wushuang.

For an ordinary cultivator, three months was an extremely short period. It was impossible to achieve huge improvements within three months.

However, Jian Wushuang was different. He was an unprecedented, demon-like genius.

Although only three months had passed, the experts were expecting a surprise from Jian Wushuang.

“I guess a little?” Jian Wushuang answered directly.

“Only a little?” Lin Tiefeng was visibly disappointed.
