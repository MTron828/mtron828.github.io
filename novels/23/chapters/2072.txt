2073 Get Down!!

King Chen Xing looked at Jian Wushuang coldly within the violent storm of divine power.

Jian Wushuang stood up straight as numerous mirages of Ancient Gods appeared behind him.

Ancient God Ancient God lost knowledge, Universal Laws!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Every single mirage used its palm and slapped forward fiercely. Each slap seemed to contain a complete cycle of reincarnation.

King Chen Xing face turned dark. His Ancient God power burst forth as numerous mirages appeared behind him.

It had been a battle between the strength of Ultimate Finger during the fight against Zhan Cang before. Now, it was a battle between the Universal Law.

The entire heaven and earth was overwhelmed by the endless divine power. All that one could hear was the countless number of tightly packed collisions as the sounds reverberated through the air.

Amidst the raging collisions. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Humph.”

A snort could be heard as the numerous Ancient God mirages belonging to King Chen Xing dissipated into the air. He swiftly took a few steps back in retreat.

“How could this brat’s divine power be so pure?” King Chen Xing thought. Even though he was startled, his face did not show any sign of fear.

“Secret skill…... Guided Thunder!”

Hum!

Heaven and earth shook suddenly, as a rift in heaven and earth appeared out of nowhere in the sky above.

At the ends of this gigantic rift, beams of crimson red light appeared. These beams of light were countless bolts of Sacred Thunder of Extermination packed densely together. Any single bolt of thunder could easily kill an Almighty and there were at least hundreds of thousands of bolts there.

These hundreds of thousands of bolts of thunder fused together perfectly, forming a single, huge crimson thunder bolt.

This bolt of thunder suddenly descended.

“Secret skill guided thunder?”

Jian Wushuang saw this and smiled, “I also know this move.”

A similar gigantic rift in heaven and earth appeared on the other side of the sky.

However, from this rift, the countless Sacred Thunders of Extermination were dark jade in colour. The power of the thunder was unbelievably strong. Under the control of Jian Wushuang, the thunder fused together to form a huge thunder dragon which was dark jade in colour.

The thunder dragon roared, as it rushed towards the crimson red thunderbolt.

The two collided in midair.

Kaboom!!!

It was as though it was a bolt from the blue. However, the sound and power was far greater than that of a normal bolt

The two Sacred Thunder of Extermination collided with devastating impact. The surrounding void dissipated completely and formed a spacetime storm.

Originally, there had been a complex of buildings beneath their feet. After the collision, all the buildings had been destroyed and ceased to exist.

The terrifying aura shocked the ancient gods who had escaped.

“I have used almost all the attacks and secret skills from the Ancient God lost knowledge. Next up is…” Jian Wushuang thought as he looked at King Chen Xing coldly. At the same time, the size of his body grew rapidly.

Heads and arms started to grow out of his body.

This occurred to King Chen Xing as well.

Both had nine heads and eighteen arms.

“Kill!”

“Fight!”

Following the war cry, both their fists collided fiercely into each other. This time, both of them fought with their bare fists.

Each of the eighteen arms Jian Wushuang had grown held a sword. His used his swordsmanship to the fullest.

King Chen Xing used the brute force of his fist. Each punch was like a meteorite crashing. The power was unbelievable.

Fighting at melee range had always been a specialty of Ancient God Clan. Their fighting power at close range was far superior to that of the people in other clans.

During the battle, Jian Wushuang and King Chen Xing both maximized their ability to fight at close range.

The Ancient Gods who were around watching this fight were stunned.

Many cleared their throats as they shuddered in fear from the bottom of their soul.

These two men were without a doubt the strongest within the Ancient God Clan.

On one side was King Chen Xing, the man who was unanimously thought to be the strongest within the clan.

On the other side was Jian Wushuang. He possessed the bloodline of emperors. Even though he was just an Eight-star Ancient God, his power level was still higher than that of King Chen Xing.

Yes, he was stronger than King Chen Xing.

Everyone witnessed it themselves.

Jian Wushuang was stronger in every way: be it the power of his secret skill and lost knowledge, or his ability to fight at close range.

Jian Wushuang managed to completely suppress King Chen Xing even now. Even though King Chen Xing did everything he could and was fighting back with all his might, it was still clear that he was at a disadvantage.

“How is this possible?”

“This brat is just an Eight-star Ancient God. How can he be stronger than me?”

King Chen Xing thought to himself, shocked. His face was gloomy.

King Chen Xing was a Nine-star Ancient God. Even though their ability to fight at close range was of the same level, Jian Wushuang could still suppress him head on. This was because the power that came from Jian Wushuang’s sword was stronger due to the superior divine power and the inhibition from the bloodline power.

On the point of quality of divine power, Jian Wushuang was at the second phase of the seventh step of inverse cultivation. He had also finished cultivating phase one of his Immemorial Celestial Body. Furthermore, he possessed the bloodline of emperors. Even though King Chen Xing was the heir to the first Ancient God emperor, he was simply a royal Ancient God. He would be weakened due to his inferior bloodline power. Hence, Jian Wushuang was definitely stronger than King Chen Xing.

King Chen Xing was no match for Jian Wushuang due to the reasons above, and was oppressed in battle.

“King Chen Xing!”

An angry bellow was heard.

King Chen Xing looked up immediately. He saw that four of Jian Wushuang’s arms were gripping a single sword.

A wave of shocking sword essence rose and skyrocketed.

Sword Principle Xuan Lu...Blast Rainstorm!

“Get… down!”

Jian Wushuang roared as his blade, with the speed of a gale and the power of a hurricane, swept out. The emphasis of this move was on the power.

King Chen Xing eyes turned bloodshot. He channeled his divine power as his fist punched out with a force equivalent to a real meteorite.

Bang!

An earth shaking sound was heard as waves of divine power flooded the entire heaven and earth.

The result: King Chen Xing fell towards the ground, trembling. A large ditch was formed. On the other hand, Jian Wushuang stood upright and unharmed. He looked down into the ditch.

“King Chen Xing, do you submit to me!?”
