30%, less than one-third.

In other words, Jian Wushuang needed at least three or even four strikes to kill Su Ying.

Fortunately, Qian Hongzi and the others had just swarmed over, so they could kill Su Ying.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, your shadowless escape skill is too terrifying. Su Ying is an extremely powerful Peak Saint, but she didn’t have time to react before her divine body was destroyed by you. If you hadn’t destroyed her divine body and left her behind, we would have watched the people from the Destruction Saint Realm escape,” Yue Yu said with a smile.

“This move is indeed abnormal. Even I have a headache facing this move,” Qian Hongzi added. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After killing Su Ying, everyone seemed to be quite happy.

“Everyone, is it okay for us to kill people from the Destruction Saint Realm?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

“No problem. What can be wrong?” Qian Hongzi smiled. “It has been a long time since the Temporal Temple fought with the three Saint Realms. In the Blood Wave Realm, the Temporal Temple has killed people from the three Saint realms. Similarly, the three Saint Realms have killed cultivators from the Temporal Temple here, so both sides are used to it.”

“Temple Master Bai Xing has told us that we must not show mercy to people from the three Saint Realms. If we can kill them, we must not let them live.”

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, but he was quite happy.

The Temporal Temple’s actions…meant that as long as he was capable, he could kill the people from the three Saint Realms without any scruples.

“However, the three Saint Realms have always been overbearing. We killed a Peak Saint from the Destruction Saint Realm right away, so the Destruction Saint Realm will probably hold a grudge against us. We must be careful when we travel in the Blood Wave Realm. Maybe the Destruction Saint Realm will plot against us,” Qian Hongzi added.

“Yes.” Everyone nodded in unison.

The Purple Myrtle Sect, for example, had joined hands to kill an expert from the Destruction Saint Realm during the opening of the Blood Wave Realm. The Destruction Saint Realm had taken revenge on the Purple Myrtle Sect, during the opening of the Blood Wave Realm, they had taken revenge on the Purple Myrtle Sect.

Jian Wushuang and the others had killed an expert from the Destruction Saint Realm. It would be strange if the Destruction Saint Realm did not seek revenge.

“Just be careful. There’s no need to be too afraid. There are only ten experts from the Destruction Saint Realm and two on the True Saint List. Now that we’ve killed Su Ying, there are only nine people from the Destruction Saint Realm left in the Blood Wave Realm. Even if all nine of them join hands to kill us, we don’t have to be afraid of them,” Qian Hongzi added.

Hearing this, everyone laughed.

Indeed, the Temporal Temple seemed to only have six cultivators, but all of them were extremely powerful and their techniques were extremely brilliant.

Especially Di Hao. During the battle just now, everyone could see that he had the upper hand in the battle against Thunder God!

With the six of them working together, even if they were to face the remaining nine from the Destruction Saint Realm head-on, they would at least be able to protect themselves. Of course, there was no need to be too afraid.

“Let’s go.”

The six of them continued to move toward the core area of the Blood Wave Realm.

…

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The four figures stopped, and their expressions were extremely ugly.

“She’s dead. Junior Sister Su Ying was killed!”

“We just arrived at the Blood Wave Realm, and we already lost one person!”

“That damned Temporal Temple and that rank six True Saint from the Temporal Temple deserve to die as well. If he hadn’t destroyed Junior Sister Su Ying’s divine body, she definitely wouldn’t have died.”

Low roars spread out one after another.

Three of the four had ashen faces.

They had seen Su Ying being killed just now, so there was nothing they could do. At that critical moment, they really could not go and save her.

“That rank six True Saint is indeed very strange,” Thunder God said in a cold voice, “He is only a rank six True Saint, but he is able to fight with Junior Sister Su Ying. He even has a slight advantage. And what did he do in the end? Did you see how he defeated Junior Sister Su Ying’s divine body?”

“No.” The other three shook their heads.

They had been trying to get rid of their opponents and escape from the battlefield. They had not noticed Su Ying, so they had not seen how Jian Wushuang attacked.

“Who is he? When did such a genius appear in the Temporal Temple?” Thunder God frowned and asked.

He was a rank six True Saint, yet he had the upper hand against a Peak Saint. Of course, he was a genius.

“I think of someone,” a silver-haired youth suddenly said.

“Who?” Thunder God immediately looked over.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis. Three hundred years ago, he killed a rank seven True Saint as a rank four True Saint. His name is known throughout the Divine Beginning Realm,” the silver-haired youth said in a low voice, “Although I’ve never seen the battle between Heavenly Sword Marquis and that rank seven True Saint, I’ve heard that Heavenly Sword Marquis specializes in the Dao of the sword. His comprehension of the principles of space and time is exactly the same as the rank six True Saint we just saw.”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Thunder God’s gaze was cold, “Regardless of whether this rank six True Saint is the Heavenly Sword Marquis or not, the people of the Temporal Temple attacked us in the Blood Wave Realm and even killed Junior Sister Su Ying. We can’t let this matter go just like that. and that Di Hao…”

At the mention of Di Hao, Thunder God’s expression sank.

In their previous battle with the Temporal Temple, Thunder God had fought with Di Hao head-on. Logically speaking, Di Hao was ranked eighth on the True Saint rankings, while Thunder God was ranked sixth. Just based on the ranking alone…his strength should have been stronger.

But in the real battle, Di Hao was obviously stronger than him!

Especially that last ax, Thunder God was extremely shocked.

“That Di Hao’s strength is much more terrifying than the introduction on the True Saint Ranking. I’m sure he has the strength of the top five on the True Saint Ranking. With him around, it’s impossible for the four of us to take revenge on the Temporal Temple alone. We have no choice but to report this matter to the higher-ups of the Destruction Saint Realm.” Thunder God made up his mind, he immediately contacted the higher-ups of the Destruction Saint Realm.

Although the Blood Wave Realm was extremely special in the Divine Beginning Realm, the space-time of the Blood Wave Realm was not completely cut off from the outside world. In other words, it was still easy to get in contact with the outside world in the Blood Wave Realm.
