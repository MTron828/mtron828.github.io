Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with happiness when Ancestor Tian Chen agreed.

The first condition was actually the most important condition.

The first condition included a crucial question, which was the control rights of Green Fire World over the years!

If the experts from Sanctuary Alliance and special tribes were to be allowed to step foot in Green Fire World, then even if Jian Wushuang had the grand formation, it would be difficult for him to control Green Fire World.

But now, only cultivators below Real God level were allowed to enter. At most, only the Alliance of Ten would be there.

Regardless of which Almighties Sanctuary Alliance chose, as long as there wasn’t a Great Emperor, Jian Wushuang would be able to suppress them.

Green Fire World’s actual control right still belonged to him and belonged to Green Fire Palace.

The cultivators from Green Fire World were still the owner. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The moment the first condition was done, Jian Wushuang’s goal had been achieved. Now, he needed to figure out a way to get the biggest advantage for cultivators in Green Fire World.

“Sword Emperor, tell us your other conditions, “Ancestor Tian Chen looked at Jian Wushuang.

The Sanctuary Alliance and the few special tribes actually had no alternatives.

Jian Wushuang, or it should be Green Fire World’s final trump card was too scary. They didn’t have the guts to corner them too much.

“My second condition is that, from today, all cultivators who are wandering in this ancient battlefield will not step foot in the surrounding area in Green Fire World. In other words, within the huge skull that you saw through the pearl earlier,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

The moment he said that, many experts’ faces changed.

Through the pearl, they could see that the huge skull where Green Fire World was located was the core of the ancient battlefield.

On top of that, the skull was huge and shocking. It definitely contained boundless opportunities.

The attraction of the skill to these experts was far beyond any other places on the ancient battlefield. There were many experts who had already made up their minds that they’d wander on the skull after they dealt with the matter with Green Fire World.

However, the condition that Jian Wushuang suggested was to prohibit them from entering the territory of the skull.

“Everyone, I’m afraid you don’t know that Green Fire World has been nurtured by this ancient battlefield for many years, over forty thousand years. Over the years, the cultivators from Green Fire World had been wandering in the surrounding ancient battlefield and the region that they wandered was mostly around the skull. In other words, ninety percent of the skull was already searched through by cultivators from Green Fire World, including myself. As for the opportunity in the skull, hehe...” Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t finish his sentence.

The experts at the scene heard and they were surprised again.

Although they didn’t truly believe in Jian Wushuang’s speech, they could make their own judgment.

Green Fire World had been on the battlefield for such a long time and they definitely would search for the surrounding opportunities and treasure. It was normal that they would search through the area around the skull.

Battlefield that had already been searched through... Even though they didn’t find any opportunities, the value was not as high as they thought it was.

“Plus, everyone, please don’t only think about yourself. Think about your disciples and juniors. If they intend to grow in Green Fire World, they will need a training ground.” But a Universe God could easily wander around the dangerous places in Green Fire World itself. There was no effect of training. They naturally only could place their hope on the ancient battlefield.

“Hence, the territory that the skull took up, live for your younger disciples and the cultivators in Green Fire World. What do you think?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He sounded reasonable. But in actual fact, he knew clearly.

At the territory where the skull was, there were boundless opportunities that had yet to be unearthed.

However, he did so for the cultivators of Green Fire World. Of course, all forces in Eternal Chaotic World that allocated cultivators to the territory of Green Fire World definitely wouldn’t reap the same advantages.

The experts at the scene exchanged a look and they seemed a little hesitant.

Then, Emperor Bai, who sat in the middle, suddenly opened his white eyes, “This condition is agreeable.”

Then, he closed his eyes again.

Emperor Bai spoke himself. Even though the experts hesitated, they never spoke again.

They finally agreed to this condition as well.

“The third condition, “Jian Wushuang looked at the surrounding people, “I hope that the experts who wandered in the ancient battlefield would give a certain amount of Doctrine Gem or resources of equivalent value to Green Fire World as rewards.”

“What?”

“You are asking for Doctrine Gem? How could you?”

“Get an inch, want a mile!!!”

Everyone’s faces changed and a few Great Emperors stood up in anger.

“Jian Wushuang, we have already comprised. Aren’t you going a little overboard now?” Ancestor Tian Chen said in a deep voice.

“Overboard? Am I really overboard?” Jian Wushuang scoffed, “Everyone, do you think this ancient battlefield could be so stable all the time? For you to wander and search for opportunities at ease? Why don’t you think about the grand formation surrounding the ancient battlefield. Without it, how would the ancient battlefield be?”

Everyone stunned.

Without the grand formation, they naturally knew the outcome.

They shivered in fear at the thought.

“Because the grand formation restricted the surrounding spacetime storm and the ancient battlefield could be maintained without effect. Plus, the outstanding cultivation environment is also affected by the formation. You have to think about how many resources we Green Fire World has spent in order to maintain such an unbelievable formation. How much treasure? Do you think it’s easy?” Jian Wushuang humphed coldly.

Many kept quiet when they heard what he said.

Especially those who were good with formations.

The grand formation surrounding the ancient battlefield was simply unbelievable in their eyes. The stronger the formation, the greater the energy required to maintain it.

The grand formation was so unbelievable. Hence, the resources required to maintain it would definitely be a sky-high number.

Then, Jian Wushuang added, “The grand formation was a huge burden. Previously, our cultivators from Green Fire World took turns to wander in the surrounding ancient battlefield to obtain resources and barely maintained the formation. But then, we handed over the ancient battlefield and only kept the territory where the skull was. The resources that we could get naturally diminished tremendously. At this time, if I didn’t ask for resources from you, who else could I ask?”
