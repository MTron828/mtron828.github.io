Chapter 2859: See You Again

——

This beautiful face, which could not be described with words, had appeared in Jian Wushuang’s mind countless times, making him yearn for it day and night. But now, this face appeared in front of him with this identity.

“Shuang Er, it’s Shuang Er!”

Jian Wushuang was roaring in his heart, and his whole body was trembling crazily.

He looked at the peerless beauty who had become the focus of the world, but his eyes were filled with unprecedented ecstasy.

He had waited for this ecstasy for too long, and he had longed for it for too long.

Leng Rushuang, his wife!

Not only did she look exactly the same, but the extremely cold aura on her body was also exactly the same.

Jian Wushuang was sure of her just by looking at her.

The woman in front of him was the recognized number one genius and beauty of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. She was his wife, Leng Rushuang!

He could not be wrong.

“Shuang Er, I’ve finally found you again!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists. His fingertips were bleeding, but he was very excited.

He had been waiting for this day for a long time. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was in his previous life, a long, long time ago. Leng Rushuang had left after his wedding night in the green fire world. From then on, he had been waiting, but he was looking for a chance to meet Leng Rushuang again.

But after nearly 100,000 years, all he found was the body occupied by Leng Rushuang.

As for Leng Rushuang’s soul, it had been sleeping for a long time. She had never met him.

Even when both of them were sent into reincarnation by his Master Xuan Yi, he had never met Leng Rushuang.

Until now, in this life, in the absolute beginning divine realm, he had finally met Leng Rushuang again.

He was so excited that he wanted to rush up and hug Leng Rushuang. However, his reason calmed him down.

He stood in the crowd and stood in a corner, quietly looking at the peerless beauty who had become the focus of countless experts.

Deep in his heart, he was full of thoughts.

“According to what Bi Yan told me, the Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion has been cultivating for less than 200 years, which means she is less than 200 years old, just like me. Apparently, Shuang Er and I entered the reincarnation passage and reincarnated together. However, I was born in the Pill Sun Sacred world, while Shuang Er was born in another place.”

“But why is Shuang Er so talented?”

This was what Jian Wushuang was most puzzled about.

“In my previous life, although Shuang Er had a body of destiny, her body of destiny was occupied by Leng Ruxue. She only retained a soul. Even after she entered the reincarnation passage, she could only cultivate normally like an ordinary cultivator. But in fact, her talent is so high that it’s enough to scare people to death…”

Leng Rushuang’s talent in this life was too high.

Although Jian Wushuang was a perfect chaotic creature with unlimited potential, he was inferior to Leng Rushuang in terms of the comprehension of rules.

However, Leng Rushuang had been in a deep sleep in her previous life and was not qualified to touch the power of rules. Logically, her cultivation speed should not be so fast.

“Unless…” Jian Wushuang had already thought of a possibility.

This possibility came from his master Xuan Yi!

“It was master who sent Shuang Er’s soul and mine into the reincarnation passage, which means that everything is under master’s control. Moreover, the master has deliberately left a backup plan in the primordial divine realm. I’m afraid that Shuang Er’s incredible talent in rules is also related to master. It’s very likely that master used some special means,” Jian Wushuang thought.

In his opinion, only his master Xuan Yi could make Leng Rushuang’s talent change so much.

“No matter what, it’s a good thing that Shuang Er is talented,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Leng Rushuang had arrived at the martial arts practice field.

“Leng Er, come and sit here.”

Among the two Immortal Saints of Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Elder Qin, the easy-going woman, besides the Pavilion Master Long Xingzi, said with a smile.

“Yes, master.” Leng Rushuang nodded slightly. Then, she landed beside Elder Qin and sat down on a futon.

At this moment, all the experts present let out a sigh of relief, but the fervor in their hearts did not diminish in the slightest.

“Everyone.”

Long Xingzi stood up, and his grand voice echoed throughout the entire martial arts practice field. “Welcome, everyone, to take time out of your busy schedules to come to our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to observe the ceremony. This old man is extremely grateful.”

“Pavilion Master Long, let’s not talk about such pleasantries. We are here for the Dragon-phoenix ranking. Open the ranking quickly. I am very curious about the rank of this Young Phoenix in the Dragon-phoenix ranking.” It was the Immortal Saint from the Thunder Cloud Pavilion who spoke.

This Immortal Saint was tall and sturdy, and his aura was extremely violent. It was obvious that he was an impatient person with a very bad temper.

“Haha, that’s right. If that’s the case, then let’s begin. Let’s invite the Dragon-phoenix List!” Long Xingzi waved his hand, and a special fluctuation spread out.

In an instant… weng!

The void shook violently, and a spiral tunnel appeared out of thin air in the void above the huge martial arts practice field.

The spiral tunnel was only about ten feet wide at first, but as the tunnel continued to expand, it reached a hundred feet wide in the blink of an eye, and it was still expanding rapidly.

At this moment… roar! Roar!

A dragon’s roar and a phoenix’s cry suddenly reverberated throughout the entire Dragon-phoenix pavilion.

In front of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s mountain gate, the two towering golden dragons and the fire phoenix sculptures directly came to life. The golden dragons emitted an endless golden light as they stepped on the seven-colored auspicious clouds. Meanwhile, the Fire Phoenix released flames that filled the sky, causing the sky to turn red.

The Golden Dragon and the Fire Phoenix rushed over at the same time and appeared under the enormous spiral passageway.

Under the simultaneous cries of the dragon and the phoenix, an ancient and enormous scroll slowly descended from the enormous spiral passageway.

This scroll was originally open, and as the scroll descended from the passageway, the contents of the scroll slowly appeared before everyone.

From the beginning, it was the three large golden words ‘Dragon-phoenix ranking’.

These three words contained an endless might that was not inferior to the might of an undying saint. They intimidated everything below. The experts who were able to attend the ceremony were all-powerful, and there were many experts present, however, they were able to easily withstand the might of these three large golden words.

Not long after the three words ‘Dragon and Phoenix Ranking’, the first name appeared… Ancient Saint!

Upon seeing this name, many people in the martial arts practice field who knew about it immediately revealed a look of reverence.

This was especially so for the few undying sages on the field. They were all extremely respectful.
