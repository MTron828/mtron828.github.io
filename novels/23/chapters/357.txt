Chapter 358: Blood Puppet

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

While Jian Wushuang was digging through the Sword Skills in Sword Tower, the Nanyang Continent gradually settled down.

One year passed in the blink of an eye.

After spending a year in the tower, Jian Wushuang finally exited. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had been constantly studying and practicing Sword Skills during this year. Now, he was like a completely different person, much stronger in Sword Principle and Origin comprehension.

With his excellent talent and the awakening of his Double First-grade Sword Soul, which was very helpful in comprehending both Sword Principle and Origin, he naturally reached the “Pinnacle” level of Origin.

Moreover, he gained a new understanding of Origin once he reached the Pinnacle.

This Pinnacle was the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.

It was totally different from “Momentum” and “Domain” because it was only a vague concept that represented a certain level of progress, but everyone in this realm would possess a different level of strength.

If the Origin was a vast ocean, comprehending a single drop of water would enable someone to step into the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. However, there was still a huge difference?in power with respect to how much one comprehended.

Currently, Jian Wushuang had only comprehended a single drop of water from the Origin since he had reached this realm just recently.

Jin Ling and Mu Shan were waiting for Jian Wushuang as soon as he walked out of the tower.

“You have only stayed for one year.” Jin Ling looked at Jian Wushuang with astonishment and asked, “Don’t you want to stay longer?”

“No,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and replied.

He had already gained a lot from the tower and got what he wanted, so staying longer would bring him nothing but slow progress in Sword Principle.

“I’ve received two of the three opportunities. What’s the last one?” Jian Wushuang asked directly.

“The last one is this.” As Jin Ling waved his hand, a bloody shadow flashed and appeared before Jian Wushuang.

It was a burly man in red armor, boots, and a helmet. His arms?were wrapped around his chest and an emotionless light shined from within his cold eyes.

“A Puppet Fighter?”

At a glance, Jian Wushuang could tell the man was not human, but a Puppet Fighter like Bai Ling and Mu Shan.

“He is a Blood Puppet.” Jin Ling looked at Jian Wushuang and explained, “He is not a normal Puppet Fighter. He was made to slaughter and destroy. Since he possesses no intelligence, he will only obey his master.

“Back when Sword Ancestor was at his peak, he was not only talented in Sword Principle. He was also gifted in regards to making puppets. He created Mu Shan and I and gave us consciousness.

“This Blood Puppet is the strongest Puppet Fighter among the ones he made.”

Jian Wushuang stared closely at the Blood Puppet.

Without exchanging even one move, Jian Wushuang already felt terrifying pressure from the puppet standing before him.

“This Blood Puppet’s body is as strong as a magic weapon. It also possesses excellent attack, speed, and defense, so it only has one weakness. Blood Gems are required to power it each time,” Jin Ling added.

“Blood Gem?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Yes, like these.” Jin Ling turned over his hand and showed Jian Wushuang three waxy yellow gems.

“Blood Gems are the only things that can power a Blood Puppet. I will give you these three for now.” Jin Ling handed the gems to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang held the gems in his hands and could feel a terrifying power contained in them. He was amazed.

“With these three gems, you can use this Blood Puppet three times. Of course, if you want it to increase its strength, you could use all three gems at the same time.” Jin Ling continued, “But normally, with only one gem, the puppet would be much stronger than an expert at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned, then asked, “Which means, the more Blood Gems it consumes, the more powerful it’ll be?”

“Right.” Jin Ling nodded. “If you used 10 gems at the same time, you would reach the limit of his power, but that is the maximum.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Though the Blood Puppet was just standing there, yet to show his strength, Jian Wushuang could tell that the puppet was very strong because an overwhelming pressure had risen in his heart.

With this puppet, he would have one more trump card.

“Since you’ve received your three rewards, it’s time for you to leave,” said Jin Ling.

Jian Wushuang nodded before asking, “What level do I need to reach to qualify for the third trial?”

“The third trial is different from the previous two. I have no idea what it is, only that it relates to a big secret. As for the level you have to reach...” Jin Ling pondered for a while and continued, “When you become as strong as Sword Ancestor at his peak, you can come back here and attempt the third trial.”

“As strong as Sword Ancestor at his peak?” Jian Wushuang was astounded.

With a bitter smile, Jian Wushuang entered the wormhole and left.

Inside the Dark Forest of Tianzong Dynasty, Jian Wushuang sat down quietly, at the peak of a mountain, with his legs crossed and eyes closed.

Soon after, a black shadow slowly split from his body. The shadow was none other than Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Doppelganger.

“Over a year has passed. Now, my Slaughter Doppelganger has finally been reborn.”Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart.

He lost his Slaughter Doppelganger in Tang Dynasty when he was chased by Tan Feng. He had been working on this new one for over a year before he finished it.

“In the Ancestor’s Land, I received a lot and greatly enhanced my strength.

“With the first-grade sword techniques, my trump cards, and my new Slaughter Doppelganger, it’s time to settle the feud between me and Holy Emperor Palace.”

Jian Wushuang looked up, staring into the boundless sky. Then, a sliver of light flashed in his eyes.

Meanwhile, an overwhelming killing intent surged out and swept through the sky.
