Chapter 1042: Fleeing for My Life!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

A moment ago, Jian Wushuang had achieved a breakthrough in his Aurora Sword Principle.

It was the second Sword Principle that he created. His Sword Principles had kept improving during his 50 years in the Firmament Territory after leaving the Rock Demon Clan. His Coalescence Sword Principle had achieved the Universe Level, while his Aurora Sword Principle was close to achieving that level.

Jian Wushuang had remained extremely calm when faced with the encirclement of the 10 Dao Masters earlier on, but his hidden potential had been unleashed, resulting in his breakthrough in the Aurora Sword Principle; he managed to block all of the 10 Dao Masters’ attacks and even knock them back due to this sudden increase in speed of his swordsmanship.

“Since all three of my Sword Principles have reached the Universe Level, my overall strength must have increased again. I’m currently still no match for a Celestial Master, but I must be close,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Jian Wushuang, why are you still thinking about such things now? You should be coming up with a plan to shake off Empyrean Patriarch. He is a Sky-devouring Bat at the Holy Master Level and much quicker than you. Furthermore, he has not shown his original form. Once he does, his speed will surely be increased by many times,” Gu King’s voice rang out again.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He had also noticed that the distance between Empyrean Patriarch and himself was drawing ever nearer.

He estimated that Empyrean Patriarch would be able to catch up with him after a little while more.

“I don’t have a choice. I can only go all in and hope for the best,”?Jian Wushuang thought. He clasped his hands together and said, “Gu King, lend me all your strength!”

“Fine,” Gu King nodded. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes once again.

“Dragon Blood Secret Skill!”

“Buzz!” In an instant, the vast amounts of Spiritual Power in Jian Wushuang’s body began to ignite.

Layers of blood-red vapor were emitted from his body. With Spiritual Power raging in his body, his speed had increased tenfold all of an instant.

“Whoosh!”

He seemed to have completely transformed into a ray of blood-red light as he zoomed across the Void, covering thousands of kilometers in an instant.

Empyrean Patriarch, who was close behind and catching up to Jian Wushuang, was shocked upon seeing the change in speed of his enemy.

“What’s going on?”

“How did that brat’s speed increase by so much all of a sudden? It felt as though it increased more than tenfold in an instant!”

Jian Wushuang had already surprised Empyrean Patriarch with his speed earlier on, but now, with the sudden huge increase, his speed had already exceeded that of a Rank Three Dao Master. Even an ordinary Celestial Master would be hard pressed to match his current speed.

“What Secret Skill did he use?”?Empyrean Patriarch thought, frowning.

He deduced that Jian Wushuang must have used some special Secret Skill to achieve the huge sudden increase in speed.

Even though there was no lack of Secret Skills in the Green Fire World that could increase one’s speed quickly, they grew less effective once the user’s strength improved. A Secret Skill sold in the Divine Monster Territory not long ago was a good example; it could increase a Rank Three Dao Master’s speed by two times, but only 30 per cent of a Celestial Master’s speed.

Even so, it was treated like treasure and sought after by many experts. Two Celestial Masters even personally appeared at the auction to compete with one another for ownership of the skill.

“Now, however, Jian Wushuang’s Secret Skill could increase his speed by 10 times?

“What did this mean?”?Empyrean Patriarch thought.

“Humph!” he grunted.

He then unleashed one of his Secret Skills as well, resulting in him being able to move at maximum speed.

Even so, he could only remain far behind Jian Wushuang and was unable to close up the distance between them.

“Humph, even though his Secret Skill is effective, he surely has to pay a high price for using it. I don’t believe that the brat can keep this up for long,” Empyrean Patriarch muttered, his gaze chilling.

Jian Wushuang’s speed did not diminish in the least bit.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, you have many tricks up your sleeve. It’s the first time I saw you use this Secret Skill. I didn’t expect that your speed could increase so greatly by burning off the Spiritual Power in you. Such a Secret Skill is rarely seen even in the Eternal Chaotic World,” Gu King said, his laughter ringing in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“It’s a Secret Skill passed on to me by my Teacher. Even though I have to pay a steep price for using it, it’s definitely most useful when fleeing,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“Your Teacher is indeed formidable. He has so many tactics and treats you extremely well. He gave you so many wonderful things,” said Gu King, laughing.

“I still remember his kindness and good deeds toward me. However, he told me that he could only give me these things, and that if I still had any wishes to fulfil, I had to pay my own price for them,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Right. That’s normal. A Teacher that really cares for his disciple will never overly pamper him or her. It’s more than enough for him to have given you these treasures,” Gu King said.

“Let’s leave that aside for now. Gu King, I’m expending a lot of my Spiritual Power. Can you help me regenerate quickly enough?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“I can’t help you completely recover if you expend your Spiritual Power too quickly, even if I gave it my all. I could, however, help you to continue using it for a much longer time. Let’s say if you can maintain usage of the Secret Skill for one day by yourself. I could extend that to three days at least,” replied Gu King solemnly.

“That’s more than enough,” Jian Wushuang said as he smiled. At the same time, he fished out a few elixirs.

He got them from the experts he killed, and they could help him recover his Spiritual Power.

Even though he had left most of his treasures with his Slaughter Body, he retained a few of them on his World Body. Most of them were meant for treating injuries, and two of them were elixirs that could help him recover half of his Spiritual Power instantly. They were left to him by Dao Yuanzi.

With these elixirs and Gu King’s aid, he believed he could maintain the amount of Spiritual Power burned by using the first level of Dragon Blood Secret Skill for a few days and possibly even much longer.

Furthermore, he believed that Jiu Xiu could not possibly continue to withstand the Restrictions for more than a few days.

Two figures, one chasing after the other, had traversed across thousands of kilometers of space in only an instant.

Empyrean Patriarch had originally believed that Jian Wushuang could not have withstood the usage of his Secret Skill for long, but as time passed…

Seven minutes, 15 minutes!

One hour!

Two hours!

Jian Wushuang did not seem to be slowing down even after four hours. Instead, Empyrean Patriarch had to start consuming elixirs to maintain usage of his own Secret Skill; he had also used up much of his Spiritual Power.

Both of them had traversed across great distances during these four hours, passing by many districts of different populations and cities; many experts were shocked by the wild chase.
