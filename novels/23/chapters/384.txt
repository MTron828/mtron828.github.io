Chapter 385: Lei Dao

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang looked at the person facing him while frowning.

This man exuded an extremely violent and overbearing aura, with fanatical eyes and overwhelming battle intent.

“My name is Lei Dao, and my favorite thing in my life is to fight with real experts. In today’s Iron Saber Territory, I have challenged all the experts who have reached the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. It is rare to meet an expert like you who looks like someone at Stage Two. Anyway, we have to fight a battle.” Lei Dao said.

“Stage Two?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Master Luo Hong, would you mind if I fight with this Swordsman in your Luo family mansion??” Lei Dao glanced at Luo Hong.

“As long as you don’t tear down my mansion, Mr. Lei Dao, just do whatever you want.” Luo Hong said with a smile.

“Swordsman, please.” Lei Dao cupped one hand in the other before his chest towards Jian Wushuang to show courtesy, and then directly attacked him.

A purple saber appeared in Lei Dao’s hand, who had come in front of Jian Wushuang with only one single stride covering tens of zhangs. The purple saber turned into a purple thunderbolt and was cleaving towards Jian Wushuang with a shrill boom across the void.

“Expert!” Jian Wushuang’s face turned gloomy.

Just watching Lei Dao’s strike, Jian Wushuang understood immediately that he was facing a real expert.

When the extremely overwhelming saber approached, even Jian Wushuang felt an unusually great pressure.

The pressure was even greater than that brought to him when the four Holy Masters from the Holy Emperor Palace attacked him together at the palace.

As for the strength of this Lei Dao, it was obviously far from being comparable to that of the four Holy Masters. Even the strongest First Holy Master was much weaker than him.

While the saber was arriving, Jian Wushuang shook his body. Then, he stepped forward, with his right hand clenched tightly, and a blast of outrageous force was gathered. He directly punched forward with a boom. Rumbling ~ ~ ~ at that moment, it seemed that the heaven and earth were trembling.

Peng!

Jian Wushuang’s fist collided against the purple saber with a violent crash. His body was immediately blown backward, while Lei Dao’s body also trembled.

“Eh?” Lei Dao looked at Jian Wushuang in a surprise.?“He dared punch directly with his fist against my saber, and my saber did not split his palm?”

Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

“My flesh can compare with magic weapons, but when he struck, my palm was numbed. It’s my limit to accept one of his strikes with my bare hands. I could never receive a second attack.”?Jian Wushuang secretly thought.

“Ha ha, come again!” Lei Dao laughed. Then he strode out again. He performed another violent cleave with his saber.

This time, Jian Wushuang could not block it with bare hands. A long sword appeared in his hand.

This sword was obtained from the Holy Emperor Palace. It was a medium second-grade magic weapon named “Lonely Heart”.

There was no other way. The Triple-kill Sword, as a first-grade magic weapon, was too well known. Hence, Jian Wushuang usually used this Lonely Heart Sword in public battles.

With a cold snort, the long sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand turned into a Ghost Snake and swerved out.

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

There were four consecutive sword moves, each of which was amazingly fast with most eccentric angles, making that Lei Dao unable to resist with all of his power.

After the four strikes, however, Jian Wushuang suddenly withdrew his body, with the sword in his hand cleaving out.

The first-grade sword technique?“Dragon-killing Sword Technique?” was displayed with immediately explosive power.

Lei Dao tried to defend with his saber, but found his saber was struck away violently by Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“Amazing! ”

Lei Dao stood up firmly and looked with excited sparkling eyes at Jian Wushuang.

“You are extremely powerful. If I want to defeat you, I’m afraid that I would have to display my most powerful techniques. Yet, that technique can only be used in life and death struggles. Now we are just sparring so it’s not necessary for me to use it.” Saying this, Lei Dao slowly sheathed his saber into the scabbard. Evidently, he had no more intent to fight against Jian Wushuang.

“Your strength is incredible. If you use your most powerful technique, I’m afraid I can not withstand it.” Jian Wushuang smiled modestly.

“Haha, Swordsman, it’s rare to meet with an expert like you. Let’s have a good talk, okay?” Lei Dao laughed.

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He had found that Lei Dao was a bold and straightforward man with a free spirit, who was worth befriending. Anyway, he had just arrived at the Divine Land, and needed to know more. Perhaps he could get answers from Lei Dao.

“Two warriors, the Luo family has prepared wine for you. You could have a good talk here.” Luo Hong said at this moment.

“Thanks to Master!”

After thanking the Luo family, Jian Wushuang rushed to their mansion with Lei Dao, and Lin Lan obediently followed Jian Wushuang.

...

In a manor of the mansion of Luo Family, Jian Wushang and Lei Dao were sitting together.

“Swordsman, you could block my saber with your bare fist. Your body is so strong! I have fought against countless experts in so many years in the Divine Land. There is no one, however, whose physique could compare with yours.” Lei Dao admired.

“Your saber techniques are also terrifying, powerful and overwhelming!” Recalling the saber techniques Lei Dao had wielded just now, Jian Wushuang also gasped in admiration.

“Haha, however powerful my saber techniques, you defeated me!” Lei Dao laughed. “By the way, your strength is so overwhelming. Yet, why haven’t I heard about your name in the Iron Saber Territory?”

“I come from an outside continent, and have just arrived at the Divine Land.” Jian Wushuang said.

“No wonder.” Lei Dao was silent for a while. “You cultivated in an outside continent but obtained the strength of Stage Two. You are really amazing.”

“Stage Two?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “Lei Dao, when you fought against me, you mentioned Stage Two. What does Stage Two mean?”

“You don’t know?” Lei Dao glanced at Jian Wushuang in astonishment, but he immediately understood. “Right, anyway, you have just arrived at Divine Land. It’s normal that you don’t know this classification. Let me explain it to you.”

Lei Dao began to explain.

“You should know that there is no difference between the height of the Realms within the Saint Realm. The difference just lies in the perception of the Origin. Therefore, as long as you reach the Saint Realm, you’ll be classified into three levels of ‘Momentum’, ‘Domain’, and ‘Pinnacle’.”

“Let’s put aside ‘Momentum’ and ‘Domain’, and just talk about the ‘Pinnacle’.”

“Pinnacle refers to the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm, which means you have reached a certain level of Origin perception.”

“However, warriors at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm also have different strengths, and the differences can be very large.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Warriors at the same Pinnacle of the Saint Realm really could have huge disparity.

Just like the battle strength of the First Holy Master was far more powerful than that of the other three Holy Masters in Nanyang Continent, who was much stronger than other warriors at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.

As for Jian Wushuang himself, he was also at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm, but he could very easily kill an ordinary warrior at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.

“Pinnacle of the Saint Realm is just a vague concept, and what really matters is the perception of the Origin!”

“The Origin of Heaven and Earth is as vast as the sea. When you comprehend one waterdrop, you are at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm; when you comprehend one hundred waterdrops, you all still at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. The disparity, however, is substantial.”

“According to the disparity, the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm is divided into three stages!”
