Chapter 312: Asura Secret Skill

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

What Leng Rushuang said was true. She helped him because she might need his help one day in the future.

It’s total nonsense to think that she was interested in him.

“I did it for a reason. However, you stole our father’s?Asura Secret Skill?and gave it to him. You thought I didn’t know, didn’t you?” Leng Rushuang looked over at Leng Ruxue.

Leng Ruxue stuck out her tongue.

She did steal the jade token from her father and give it to Jian Wushuang.

“The Asura Secret Skill is powerful and tyrannical. He is only in the Yang Void Realm, yet you gave it to him not knowing whether he will be able to use it. Such a...” Leng Rushuang sighed and shook her head at her naughty sister.

They were sisters, but their personalities were completely opposite.

Leng Rushuang?was as cold as frost and treated everyone coldly.

Leng Ruxue was naturally lively and naughty. She was enthusiastic and dealt with people according to her feelings.

Jian Wushuang helped her before, so Leng Ruxue treated him enthusiastically.

“Our father will finish his retreat soon, so you’d better stay here. Otherwise, once he returns and finds out about the trouble you caused, he will punish you,” Leng Rushuang said.

Leng Ruxue stuck her tongue out. Apparently she really did fear being scolded by her father.

...

After leaving the Nature Residence, Jian Wushuang traveled at his fastest speed for half a day before he stopped and landed heavily on the ground below, with a surprised look on his face.

“This feels great!”

Jian Wushuang was excited. A terrifying force surged through him as he clenched hands and released an attack towards the woods near him.

Rumble... lots of trees were uprooted or broken.

Such a terrifying force would be enough to defeat any Half-saint and even many true Saint Realm experts.

One month ago, when he was being chased by Tan Feng,?he had only been in the Profound Yang Void Realm, and he had just made his breakthrough. With the help of the Heavenly Creation skill, his cultivation could reach the Peak of the Yang Void Realm at most.

However, after staying in the Nature Residence for one month and listening to the zither, he had improved immensely. Now his cultivation had reached the Peak of the Yang Void Realm!

His power had increased by two levels!

“Now that I’m at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, and since I cultivate the Heavenly Creation Skill, my full power should be about the same as a Saint Realm expert.”?Jian Wushuang marveled at it. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Leng Rushuang helped him a lot, and that help was not less than what he received in the Ancestor’s Land.

He kept it in mind.

Jian Wushuang then took out the jade token which Leng Ruxue had given him.

“This jade token...”?Jian Wushuang looked at the jade token and focused as he began to examine it with his mind.

Suddenly, a rush of information flowed from the jade token and into his mind.

“Asura Secret Skill?”?Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He didn’t expect to find a secret skill in it.

On the Nanyang Continent, Cultivation Methods and manuals were normally recorded in books. Many of the sword techniques Jian Wushuang learned were recorded in books.

But this Asura Secret Skill was hidden in the jade token and the information was directly transferred to his mind.

It reminded him of the Heavenly Creation Skill.

It was hidden in a grey bead. When the bead disappeared, information on the Heavenly Creation Skill was instantly transferred into his mind, staying there forever.

The Asura Secret Skill was the same, which showed that it was also an exceptional secret skill.

Jian Wushuang immediately read through it carefully.

Asura Secret Skill, a special attack skill that contained three moves.

The first move, Road to the Underworld!

The second move, Bridge of Helplessness!

The third move, Eighteen Levels of Hell!

All three moves were powerful. Even the first move required the user to be in the Saint Realm.

“The cultivation requirement is so high?”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

That was just a brief introduction. Jian Wushuang didn’t really know how strong it was. But judging from the required cultivation level, Jian Wushuang could tell it wasn’t weak.

Only an expert in the Saint Realm was qualified to practice the first move. Jian Wushuang guessed that the Asura Secret Skill was a first-grade secret skill, or maybe even higher!

“Leng Ruxue really gave me something good.”?Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.“Asura Secret Skill, the way of killing. It would perfect to use with Slaughter Origin. Normally, a warrior needs to reach the Saint Realm before practicing Road to the Underworld, but that might not be true for me. “

Jian Wushuang stayed in the plain and immediately began studying the first move of Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld.

He had to admit that it was a profound technique. Even with Jian Wushuang’s talent, it still took him seven days to comprehend Road to the Underworld.

Even the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill only took him several days.

In a vast area somewhere, Jian Wushuang was standing quietly while looking forward.

Suddenly, a terrifying killing intent radiated from his body.

“Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!”

A sudden and deep shout was heard as the terrifying killing intent was released. At the same time, a vast flow of Spiritual Power also rushed forward, gathering together to form a bloody river.

A long Blood River, like a road to the underworld, stretching a thousand miles long.

The Blood River surged forward, cold and stifling.

“This is Road to the Underworld.”?Jian Wushuang looked at the Blood River that was flowing in front him and was shocked by the power it released.

He could tell that just the power radiating from the Blood River was enough to easily kill experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

This Blood River was much more powerful than his Domain.

As the owner of the Blood River, while standing in it, he could release more battle strength.

Not only that, the Blood River could be used along with Domains!

“Domain!”

Immediately, an invisible wave Origin Energy spread out and a huge Slaughter Domain formed, overlapping with the Blood River.
