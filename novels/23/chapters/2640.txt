Chapter 2641: Murderous Motive

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The nine stars...”

Looking at the nine stars that were surrounding him, something dawn on Jian Wushuang.

The Transmigration Sword Formation that he operated controlled nine Infernal Blood Divine Swords at once. The Infernal Blood Divine Swords could all join together as one, as well as making individual attacks—just like the nine stars. However, the nine stars’ usage of Samsara Strength and their coordination with each other provided Jian Wushuang a completely new understanding.

The Crimson Stone Fort experts at the mineral vein were stunned by the power of nine stars when Scorpion King performed the master stroke.

“That’s... Nine Asteroids! Master Scorpion King’s most powerful master stroke, Nine Asteroids!”

“Are we under attack?”

“Doesn’t seem so, this master stroke isn’t unleashed for a fight with an expert, it looks more like a demonstration for someone.”

“Look! Look at the center of the nine stars, there’s a man. Isn’t that the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?”

“Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?”

The Heaven Ultimate Gods were all surprised and confused.

They could already see that Scorpion King was performing his most powerful move as a demonstration for someone, and the observer was none other than the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

However, how did the Territorial Lord come to have such a relationship with Master Scorpion King that he was willing to treat him with such honor? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

A while later, the nine stars gradually dispersed.

“How do you feel, Jian Yi?” Scorpion King looked over.

“Pretty good, thank you very much, Master Scorpion King!” Jian Wushuang thanked him again.

“Haha, it’s really nothing, I hope it helps. You may go.” Scorpion King waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang bowed at Scorpion King and then left for his campground.

After his return, Jian Wushuang sat in a lotus position in his penthouse, feeling really moved.

Scorpion King gave him quite a bit of benefit in that encounter.

First of all, there were the 50 Divine Elixir Pills...

Although Jian Wushuang truly wanted to have Divine Elixir Pills, 50 of them was not enough for him to break through to High-class Earth Ultimate God from Primary-class. Nevertheless, it was still immensely helpful for his Divine Power accumulation.

The most important thing, though, was the master stroke that Scorpion King demonstrated.

The nine stars that were morphed from Samsara Strength contained Transmigration Law that was very deep. The trajectory that the nine stars formed and the battle tactic were all truly worth Jian Wushuang’s detailed studies.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and began to study.

Peace had once again returned to the Blood Gem Mineral Vein.

Word about Royal Blood Gem was not leaked and Jian Wushuang did not encounter any trouble. On top of that, seeing how well he was treated by Scorpion King, the people from Crimson Stone Fort knew that he was highly regarded by Scorpion King. Hence, even Jin Yihang had been behaving himself, not creating anymore conflicts with Jian Wushuang and his Official Army.

In the blink of an eye, five years had passed.

In addition to the two years prior to that, the Blood Gem Mineral Vein had been extracted for seven years and was finally exhausted.

In the grand palace hall...

“Master Scorpion King, according to early statistics, the Blood Gem that we have mined in the past seven years has amounted to 3.7 billion pounds! There are also a few million pounds higher quality ones among them.” Qing Ze reported respectfully before Scorpion King.

“3.7 billion pounds?”

The numbers sound astonishing even for Scorpion King. His face betrayed a stroke of joy upon hearing that number.

“The market rate of Blood Gem is 10 Primordial Stones per pound. The 3.7 billion is worth 37 billion Primordial Stones, and that is a huge income for Crimson Stone Fort. With that amount, Her Excellency the Fort Master could have quite a load off her shoulder.” Scorpion King smiled and ordered, “Qing Ze, pass down the order to have them gather all the Blood Gem into an Interspatial Ring and pass it to me. Recuperate and regroup tonight, we shall take off to Crimson Stone Fort by the break of dawn.”

“Aye.” Qing Ze took the order.

“Oh yes, do inform the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord and his Official Army about our departure tomorrow,” reminded Scorpion King.

Qing Ze nodded and left to pass down the order.

At that moment, many black clad figures gathered in a forest not too far from the Blood Gem mineral vein.

At a glance, there were no less than 40 men!

“We’ve gotten confirmation that the Divine Demons who were mining Blood Gems at the mineral vein have already been dismissed and the Crimson Stone Fort people will be departing tomorrow. Looks like the Blood Gem mineral vein has been emptied by them,” said a sharp-browed old man dressed in a black robe with his lowered voice.

“Hehe! It’s been seven years. It took tens of thousands of Divine Demons to mine for a total of seven years to empty the mineral vein. How much Blood Gems were there in the mineral vein? There has to be at least three billion pounds, yes?” A man in purple hair smiled demonically. “As per our agreement, you and I should get half each!”

“No problem, but we have to think of a way to steal the Blood Gems from Scorpion King. He’s not one to be simply messed with,” said the sharp-browed old man.

“Hmph! He’s definitely not one to mess with, nobody among the Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods in Danyang Holy Domain is an equal match to him when it comes to one-on-one battle. But this time our sects are working together, we have a total of four Grand Ultimate God.

“Regardless of how skillful Scorpion King is, there’s not much he can do but to be slaughtered. And he is the most trusted right hand man of the current Fort Master Yin Su’er, his death would be a devastating blow to Yin Su’er, and she wouldn’t be able to suppress the other factions in Crimson Stone Fort. By then, their conflict will probably blow up, all we have to do is to collect our benefits while they’re at it,” said the purple-haired man.

“True that.” The sharp-browed old man smiled faintly.

“Alright, let’s not waste our time talking. Let’s just stick to our plan and take action tonight,” said the purple-haired man.

“Very well.” The sharp-browed old man nodded seriously.

Right then, the party of 40 began to move.

It was midnight, the night sky could not be more beautiful.

The mountains where the Blood Gem mineral vein was were brightly lit up.

Official Army officers gathered in small groups, chatting casually.

“The mineral vein has finally been mined completely. We can finally return to Northern Darkstar Continent tomorrow.”

“Tsk tsk, guarding this place for seven years was a boring job, watching those people mining everyday. So glad that it’s finally over.”

“Hehe, it was rather boring, but we’ve earned a lot though. The two rewards that His Excellency the Territorial Lord gave us alone were a lot of Primordial Stones to split among us, that’s already a high earning.”

“That’s true. Our current Territorial Lord is a lot more generous than our previous one.”

“Needless to say! His ability is also a lot stronger than our previous Territorial Lord. They’re simply not on the same level, naturally, we can’t compare them at all.”
