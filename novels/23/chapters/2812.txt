“Give up?”

The Marquis of Three Yin shook his head. “The Palace Master has been eyeing the Pill Sun Sacred World for a long time. Previously, it was because the Dragon God World was watching from the side that the palace master did not dare to do anything to the Pill Sun Sacred World. He could only secretly send a part of his forces to infiltrate the world. But now... The Dragon God World was fighting with the other world not long ago, and the two sides are now in a heated battle. They have no time to care about what is happening here.”

“How can we miss such a rare opportunity?”

“My lord, you mean...” Chen Kong looked at the Marquis of Three Yin.

“The Sacred Pill Sun World must be conquered, but my lord, because of the agreement and comfort of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, you can’t come here personally. It’s definitely not enough for you to conquer the Sacred Pill Sun World, but if the heavenly void army under my lord can be mobilized, it doesn’t need to be all of them. Half of them should be enough to sweep the Sacred Pill Sun World,” the Marquis of Three Yin said.

“Heavenly Void Army!” Chen Kong could not help but be startled.

The Heavenly Void Army was the strongest army under the control of that Palace Master of the Heavenly Void Palace.

That Heavenly Void Palace Master had once relied on the Heavenly Void Army to expand his territory. This was definitely one of the top armies of the Golden Crow Nine Realms. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

If the Heavenly Void Army were to be mobilized... then with the current strength of the Sacred Pill Sun World, they definitely would not be able to withstand it.

“I’ll send a message to Palace master now.” Marquis of Three Yin made up his mind and immediately took out his token to send a message to the palace master.

On the other side, after Jian Wushuang fought with the Marquis of Three Yin, he immediately went to Crimson Rock Castle.

Soon, he met Yin Su’er.

In the towering palace, besides Yin Su’er who sat on the highest throne, Yun Shan and palace master Si Zhen stood on both sides.

“Sword One, have a seat.”

Yin Su’er was still very polite to Jian Wushuang and did not put on any airs. She directly ordered someone to bring a throne to sit in the palace.

“I wonder why you are here today, Sword One?” Yin Su’er asked.

“Doesn’t Castle Master Su’er know why I’m here? Haven’t you received any news?” Jian Wushuang asked in puzzlement.

Many experts in the Sword Alliance, including those outside the Sword Alliance, knew about the battle between him and the Marquis of Three Yin in the nest of the Sword Alliance.

If Yin Su’er had planted spies in the Sword Alliance, she should have received the news at once.

But it seemed that Yin Su’er did not.

“I really don’t know why you’re here, Sword One, and I haven’t received any news.” Yin Su’er was telling the truth.

She did not place any spies in the Sword Alliance. In fact, palace master Si Zhen and Yun Shan both minded her doing so, but she rejected them.

She did not want Jian Wushuang to have any grudges against her. At present, Crimson Rock Castle still needed the Sword Alliance, and specifically, Jian Wushuang’s help.

“It’s like this. Just now, an expert came to the Sword Alliance and fought with me. I lost this battle,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What?” Yin Su’er, Yun Shan, and palace master Si Zhen were all shocked.

Jian Wushuang had killed Palace Master Nan Wu in a head-on fight, and he was widely recognized as the number one expert in the Pill Sun Continent.

He was even very close to the legendary Invincible Divine Master. How could he lose in a one-on-one fight?

“Is it because of the Invincible Divine Master?” Yin Su’er immediately looked over.

“Yes, he is a real Invincible Divine Master, and he is very powerful. His name is the Marquis of Three Yin. Do you know him, Castle Lord Su’er?” Jian Wushuang looked at Yin Su’er.

He had never left the Pill Sun Sacred World, but he did not know about the background of the Marquis of Three Yin.

However, Yin Su’er was different. She was the Fort Master of Crimson Rock Castle and had been the ruler of the Pill Sun Sacred World for many years. She often traveled in the outside world, so she must know more about the experts than Jian Wushuang, that was why Jian Wushuang came to ask.

“Marquis of Three Yin?”

Upon hearing the name, Yin Su’er’s expression became extremely solemn.

Yun Shan, who was beside her, immediately frowned. It was obvious that he had heard of the Marquis of Three Yin.

“It seems that Castle Lord Su’er knows of Marquis of Three Yin?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Yes, I know of him.” Yin su’er nodded slightly, “Marquis of Three Yin is a very famous expert in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. He is also a genuine Invincible Divine Master. Most of the ordinary Invincible Divine Masters have only created one ultimate skill, but he has created two at the same time. Moreover, the second skill is exceptionally powerful. It is much more powerful than the ordinary ultimate skill.

“Because of this, Marquis of Three Yin can do whatever he wants in the Golden Crow Nine Realms. As long as he is not stupid enough to provoke the Immortal Saint, no one can do anything to him. If an ordinary Divine Realm expert met him in the outside world, he would respectfully call him ‘Sir’.”

“Why would such an expert come to our Pill Sun Sacred World and take the initiative to look for me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s easy to understand. The Marquis of Three Yin came from the Heaven Void World. He is a member of the Heaven Void Palace and the most trusted person of the master. He is the real arm of the master. When the Master of the Heaven Void Palace is not convenient to handle many things in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, he is usually the one to handle them,” Yin Su’er said.

“People from the Heaven Void Palace?” Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

The Heaven Void Palace had participated in the previous battle.

It was obvious that the Heaven Void Palace was targeting the Pill Sun Sacred World. The Master of the Heaven Void Palace wanted to attack the Pill Sun Sacred World.

Unfortunately, because of Jian Wushuang, the Heaven Void Palace was defeated and their people escaped.

Now that the Marquis of Three Yin had come in person, it was obvious that the Heaven Void Palace did not intend to stop there. Marquis of Three Yin came to him because he wanted to kill him, the strongest expert in the Pill Sun Continent, and then he could easily wipe out the Sword Alliance and Crimson Rock Castle.

At that time, the Heavenly Void World did not need to send too many forces to easily occupy the Pill Sun Sacred World.

However, the Marquis of Three Yin had not been able to kill him. If the Heavenly Void Palace wanted to occupy the Pill Sun Sacred World, they would need to use even more methods.

“Previously, they sent Chen Kong and the others to infiltrate and even colluded with the Blood Thunder King. Now that the Marquis of Three Yin has come in person, it seems that the Heavenly Void Palace Master is determined to annex the Pill Sun Sacred World.” Yun Shan said coldly.

“Hmph, swallow our Sacred Pill Sun World? Doesn’t he think that his appetite is too big!?” Palace Master Si Zhen said in a low voice.

“No, if the heavenly void realm is really determined to take action against our Sacred Pill Sun World, then with our current strength, I’m afraid we won’t be able to resist..” Yin Su’er frowned.
