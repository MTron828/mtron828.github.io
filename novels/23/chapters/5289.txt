Chapter 5288 - 5288: Sixth Refinement Completed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shan Jun reminded him.

“Still here?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. Wasn’t it said that after every trial, they would enter the Universe Bronze Furnace?

It had only been a few hundred years, and he was already feeling exhausted maintaining his body at a thousand times its divine power.

The following Six Refinements would require thousands, even tens of thousands of years!

He was truly afraid he couldn’t endure the intense physical tempering.

“Don’t be too nervous. With your current strength, you can probably handle the sixth level, barely tempering a supreme body. As for the last three levels, you might not even have to go there.”

Jian Wushuang nodded, although he felt somewhat dissatisfied. Yet, he knew his own strength best.

Given the increasing difficulty of these trials, the sixth level was indeed his limit.

Shan Jun’s status was extraordinary; he was the Demon Lord suppressed in this place. His power far surpassed countless peak Emperors. Perhaps even the Ultimate Emperor of his Original Universe weren’t as powerful as Shan

Jun.

He naturally believed in the assessment of such a figure.

However, things could change!

He hoped that in the time to come, he would truly undergo a transformation.

Entering the Universe Bronze Furnace for the second time, this trial lasted for a day. The fusion of two identical bodies was much more challenging than the previous trials in various heavens. The tempering process was also considerably lengthy.

However, when he emerged this time, his physical body had reached the level of a treasure,

And this was just in terms of toughness.

The explosive power of his body was also terrifying.

When combined with his divine body, he could fully unleash his strength. With a single punch, he could destroy the world!

In future close combat, his weakness was no longer a weakness; instead, it became his strength.

The sword Dao!

The Extreme Dao of slaughter!

A path where he could devastate all enemies with his attacks, crush the void with his fists, and suppress the world.

The road to invincibility!

This path was bright all the way. Jian Wushuang was now even more certain that he hadn’t made the wrong choice back then.

After the third level, as Shan Jun had said, he never came out again.

However, the tempering on the third level was the most special trial he faced. Ironically, he found this trial to be exceptionally simple.

A tremendously tough crystal was transformed by him into a set of scales.

He spent 780 years.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In those 780 years, the third level he was on seemed like a larger universe within a Universe Bronze Furnace.

In the hottest of voids, he endured for more than 700 years.

And he forged a set of scales.

What he gained, however, was a pair of hands covered in scales.

Each scale was as tough as a prehistoric treasure, possessing inherent power without needing the support of his origin source, carrying the might of Innate Treasures.

The fourth level began.

And then the fifth, and the sixth; he kept tempering the scales in various ways.

Until his entire body was covered in black scales.

These scales moved as if they were alive, responding to his will.

Once fully extended, Jian Wushuang transformed into a giant armored beast, towering tens of thousands of feet tall. On his palms, sharp fingertips gleamed.

7,000 years passed.

He barely survived the sixth level.

In truth, he had tempered his entire body with scales on the fifth level.

The space on the sixth level was a massive ancient palace, with a colossal Universe Bronze Furnace placed within.

However, this time Shan Jun didn’t appear.

He endured 100 years alone within the Universe Bronze Furnace, embedding the scales thoroughly into his flesh.

The supreme physique!

He had achieved it, but it hadn’t reached the realm of perfection yet.

Swaying his tail that had grown behind him, Jian Wushuang felt like an ancient artificial species.

A creature that had traversed from ancient times.

He breathed lightly, his nostrils emitting two thin streams of air.

His form shrank, reaching only around 10,000 feet in height. Every bone and scale on his body was extremely symmetrical.

Standing there, he resembled a towering mountain, unshakable.

“Is this the peerless state?”

He clenched his fist slightly, and the immense power made the stable space quiver with ripples.

The sheer eruption of power gave him the combat strength of a half-step Emperor.

The saying ‘strength can shatter all techniques’ wasn’t just empty words.

Crucially, he possessed the Ultimate Dao of the Origin of All Things.

With the combination of these two, who among the Grand Yan Immortals in the world could stand against him?

Even with Wan Xings imitation Eternal Treasure, Jian Wushuang was confident he could crush him with a single punch. He even felt the urge to crush an Innate Treasure.

In his hands, he left imprints when he exerted his full force on a spherical

Innate Treasure, eventually revealing several cracks.

This was the extent of his physical strength now.

Whoever had an innate treasure that even the Emperor couldn’t easily destroy was child’s play to him.

His demeanor shifted slightly, and his dragon scales receded, revealing his human form once more.

“It’s time to leave.’

The seventh level posed a threshold he couldn’t cross.

Pulling out a token, he shifted out of the trial tower. His physical body had reached a level beyond excellence, but perfecting the Ninth Refinement seemed almost impossible.

He had managed to pass the first six levels mainly due to the clandestine assistance from Shan Jun, especially concerning the Dragon-Lock Veins.

Exiting the trial tower, Jian Wushuang felt an unprecedented sense of relief.

“Senior!”

Shan Jun was already there above the Cosmic Bronze Furnace, seemingly waiting for him.

“Indeed, you should inherit the Thunder lineage’s physique. Your speed and endurance are exceptional,” Shan Jun commented.

Jian Wushuang smiled modestly. “Senior, nothing escapes your notice. However, my knowledge of the Thunder lineage, especially concerning avatars, is limited.’

He truly lacked in-depth understanding of the freshly tempered avatars. The Thunder lineage’s physique excelled in both speed and resilience, surpassing other transcendent physiques. Yet, his avatars were different. Strictly speaking, his avatars couldn’t be considered individual entities; they were ‘Shadow Splits’.

Hundreds of shadows burst forth from Jian Wushuangs body, each taking the form of a different exotic beast. In these forms, his avatars were incredibly robust, especially when combined with the Beast God Weapon, which made his progress through the sixth level remarkably smooth.

The origins of the Thunder lineage were subtly connected to the Space Beast God, which explained a lot. The more benefits the Beast God Weapon offered, the more Jian Wushuang desired its complete form.

Regrettably, it had shattered, breaking into countless pieces. Currently, he possessed only the Can Dragon Wings and Eye, with Candle Dragon Claw being another fragment.

Only three pieces were known. The real core of the Beast God Weapon was the Candle Dragon Breastplate and the Beast God Heart in the core. These constituted the essence of the Beast God ‘Candle Dragon’.

The old man with sheep horns had once mentioned that a mighty Divine Master had slain an equal-tier opponent with the Beast God Weapon ‘Candle Dragon’.

The complete Candle Dragon perfectly suited powerful beings skilled in divine body and spatial manipulation. When fully unleashed, it could yield a strength tens of thousands of times greater than a Divine Master’s. That was its terrifying aspect.

What was even more horrifying was that such a potent treasure had been shattered.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help feeling a sense of lament.

How could such a precious item be broken?

What had transpired in the era of the Qishen Temple?

Perhaps only the core members of the temple knew the truth..
