Chapter 3780: Three-Eye Demon Race

“If we can’t do anything to him, then we can’t do anything to him. Why are you still trying to quibble?” The Three-Eyed Demon Woman sneered.

“The two of you, stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and attack together. Don’t forget that we don’t have much time. If we really let this brat pass through our hands, then we’ll really be laughing our asses off,” the Snow-White Ape-Man shouted sternly.

Hearing the Snow-White Ape-Man’s words, the Three-Eyed Demon Woman and the five-meter-tall Stone Man’s expressions turned solemn.

“Stone, attack,” the Three-Eyed Demon Woman said.

“Mm, cooperate with me.” The five-meter-tall Stone Man nodded.

Hong!

The void suddenly trembled, and the entire land began to shake wildly at this moment. On those desolate mountains, large amounts of large boulders suddenly floated up.

These boulders were densely packed, and with the five-meter-tall Stone Man as the core, they formed a huge sea of boulders in an instant. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Stone Man, which was originally only five meters tall, suddenly expanded in size at this moment, directly reaching nearly a thousand feet tall.

The Stone Man, which was nearly a thousand feet tall, emitted a monstrous aura. Two streams of air spewed out from the sunken eye sockets.

The 300-meter-tall Stone Man stretched out his thick arms, directly picked up a huge rock in the void, and then raised it high.

The huge rock was comparable to an ordinary mountain, and it must have weighed tens of billions of pounds. However, when the Stone Man raised his hands, it was as if he was holding a ball of cotton.

Suddenly, the five-meter-tall Stone Man let out a sharp cry. The huge rock, which weighed tens of billions of pounds and was the size of a mountain, turned into a meteor and shot toward Jian Wushuang like lightning.

......

“What?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

He had thought that the Stone Man would launch an incredible attack, but he did not expect that his attack would be so simple.

He just picked up a giant rock and threw it directly at himself.

Although the giant rock shot toward him at a speed that was as fast as a meteor.

With Jian Wushuang’s strength, it was very easy for him to dodge such a huge rock.

Such an attack did not pose any danger to him.

At least, that was what Jian Wushuang thought.

However, just as Jian Wushuang was about to move and Dodge the Boulder’s attack, the Three-Eyed Demon Woman standing beside the 300-meter-tall Stone Man gave a strange smile.

A dazzling purple light suddenly flashed in the third vertical eye between her eyebrows.

The purple light was extremely demonic, like a huge purple sun. Jian Wushuang was immediately attracted by it.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, but he was immediately shocked to find that under the purple light, he felt a sharp pain in his consciousness. The pain made him unable to control his divine body.

He just stood there, motionless.

The huge rock that rushed toward him like a shooting star directly hit his divine body.

The huge rock weighed tens of billions of pounds and hit him at the speed of a shooting star. The impact of the Star was incredible.

.

The impact was at least not weaker than that of an ordinary Superior Ruler. It was even stronger than the full-strength attack of an ordinary Superior Ruler.

Jian Wushuang was struck by such a powerful attack without any defense.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had the protection of the Dark Gold Magic Dragon Armor, so the impact was weakened by more than 90 percent at the first moment. The remaining power was applied to his divine body.

His supreme eternal celestial body was comparable to an ordinary elementary Universe Supreme Treasure, but the remaining part of the impact was enough to completely shatter an ordinary elementary Universe Supreme Treasure.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s body shook, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

His divine body had been damaged by more than 40 percent of the impact.

“How terrifying. I have the protection of the Dark Gold Magic Dragon Armor and cultivated the supreme eternal celestial body. My divine body is comparable to an ordinary elementary Universe Supreme Treasure, but this level of attack still severely injured his divine body and damaged it by more than 40 percent.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with a trace of shock.

Although he had only consumed his divine body, he could immediately use his divine power to repair it.

However, it must be remembered that the stronger the divine body, the more divine power was needed to repair it. Jian Wushuang’s divine body was comparable to an elementary universe True Treasure. If it were an ordinary Principles Master, even if they used up all their divine power, they would not be able to completely repair more than 40 percent of their divine body.

However, Jian Wushuang was a perfect life after all. His divine power was as vast as the sea, much more than that of a Ruler. To repair more than 40% of his divine body, Jian Wushuang had only used 3% of his divine body.

“One attack has consumed 3% of my divine body. If this attack were to be repeated dozens of times, I would not be able to withstand it.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was a little unsightly.

The attack of the 300-meter-tall Stone Man was very strong, much stronger than the attack of the Snow-White Ape-Man. There was no doubt about that.

However, Jian Wushuang did not care about the Stone Man. What he cared about was the Three-Eyed Demon Woman next to the Stone Man.

He knew very well that he could have easily dodged the Stone Man’s attack just now. However, it was because of the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s technique that he lost control of his divine body in a very short period of time, that was why he was hit.

The Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s attack was a real threat to him.

“What happened just now?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. He did not even know how he was hit.

He only saw the Three-Eyed Demon Woman open her third eye and let out a purple light. Then he felt an unprecedented pain in his consciousness.

“Master, master.”

A voice suddenly sounded in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Hmm, Devil Flame?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused.

Although the soul of the Devil Flame was in the Blood-Red Gourd, he knew what was happening in the outside world and could communicate with Jian Wushuang’s consciousness at any time.

“Master, that woman should be a clansman of a special race in the universe, the Three-Eye Demon Race. The Three-Eye Demon Race is a very famous special race in the universe. This race has an innate advantage, which is the third eye between their eyebrows. The third eye can release different colored beams of light, which can affect the cultivator’s consciousness. Master’s consciousness was affected by her just now, so she couldn’t avoid the Stone Man’s attack,” Devil Flame said.

“A special method to directly affect consciousness?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Consciousness controlled the body, but it also controlled the soul.

One could even say that a person’s soul was derived from consciousness.

In the universe, many attacks aimed at the soul, such as some special illusions and illusions, were actually also aimed at the consciousness.

However, those attacks would first be blocked by the opponent’s soul power.

However, the Three-Eye Demon Race’s special attack methods were obviously different.
