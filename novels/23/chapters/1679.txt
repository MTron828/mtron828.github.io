“Oh, you even know to blame me?” Jian Wushuang’s smile spread wider.

Blood Sword Mountain was an embryo sword and it was very intelligent. Its sword soul was exactly like a child.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had no choice but to lose it in order to make an escape. In the end, it was eaten by a Crimson Star Demon. It was in the Crimson Star Demon’s mouth for a hundred years so it of course was upset.

“Alright, I wouldn’t lose you again,” Jian Wushuang reassured it.

As he reassured it, Jian Wushuang collected the surrounding demon cores.

The massacre was the most complete massacre. The Star Demons surrounding the river were killed and he naturally received a lot of demon cores.

After he collected them, Jian Wushuang returned to the independent space.

“Lord Long Qi,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely and the unbelievable mountain before him.

The mountain didn’t move an inch but the weird elderly with the golden tail that Long Qi had taken the form of suddenly appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“What’s the matter?” Long Qi looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I’m here to bid farewell to you, Lord Long Qi,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh? You’re ready to leave?” Long Qi sounded cold as usual.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Thank you for taking care of me all this time, Lord Long Qi.”

“Don’t mention it. I only helped you because of your connection with Seven Star Black Sect,” Long Qi waved his hand and then exhorted, “Jian Wushuang, remember this. Do not reveal this place where Master is in a deep sleep after you left. It’d be best if you do not bring up whatever you come across here to another person. I do not want anyone to come and disturb Master’s sleep.”

“I will remember this,” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly, then he asked, “Oh yeah, regarding Hong Jun Golden Sword, according to what Lord Long Qi said, I only received the skill for the first form of Hong Jun Golden Sword. Is there a second form?”

“A second form? Of course! However, only the real Hong Jun Golden Sword could perform it, not the nine imitation swords that I have given to you. I do not have the real Hong Jun Golden Sword. So, even if I give you the skill of the second form, you won’t be able to use it,” Long Qi said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood. “If so, I shall leave.”

“Go ahead,” Long Qi waved.

Jian Wushuang bowed at Long Qi again. At the same time, he bowed at the lofty crystal palace as well. Then, he left through the space tunnel.

When he arrived at the other end of the space tunnel, which was at the bottom of the black river, Jian Wushuang realized that the tunnel had already vanished. Obviously, Lord Long Qi had closed the space tunnel. In the future, even Jian Wushuang might not be able to return to the independent space.

“The independent space belongs to the master of Long Qi. It is where the ancient super expert is sleeping and no one knows when the superb existence is going to wake up. He might wake up very soon. But, he might not even wake up after I pass away, after the Eternal Chaotic World collapses and after it enters a brand new era,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“Regardless, I received a great opportunity in the independent space. I also found out some secrets in ancient times. I am content.”

“In the future, unless my power reaches the level of the experts’ in ancient times, or I find out a method to wake the experts, I definitely will not step foot here again.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and turned to leave.

The core region of Eighth Lair, the dark region.

The black river that Jian Wushuang was in was actually not the deepest place in dark region. It was still considered to be the border. It wasn’t far outside of the dark region.

Previously, due to the hindrance of Star Demons, Jian Wuhsuang couldn’t leave even though he knew the way to exit.

But then… the Star Demons that were after Jian Wushuang were already massacred. Even if there were some remaining, none would be able to stop Jian Wushuang. On the contrary, they might be killed by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang returned according to the route he had used to entere the dark region. He didn’t run into any hindrances along the way.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang walked out of the dark region.

“I’m finally out!”

Looking at the void where the black fog was obviously much thinner, Jian Wushuang stretched his body as he sighed emotionally.

“Real God Zi Ye, I forced you into a desperate situation back then. You had no choice but to run into the dark region and explode yourself to startled Star Demons to come after me. Your only goal was for us to meet our deaths together!”

“Even as an enemy, your method is simply admirable. If I were to be in the same desperate situation, I might do the same thing that you did. It’s a pity that you got dealt a bad hand. Not only did you fail to bring our deaths together, you also led me to more opportunities!”

“Speaking of which, I really have to thank you.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang smiled.

If Real God Zi Ye hadn’t led him to the dark region, he definitely wouldn’t have broken through and become a stage two Ultimate Real God so soon, nor would he find the sleeping place of Lord Long Qi’s master. Also, he wouldn’t find out about Seven Star Black Sect and he wouldn’t have received so many opportunities.

For instance, comprehension of Seven Star Picture and Hong Jun Golden Sword, both were great opportunities.

Of course, Jian Wushuang had to thank Real God Zi Ye. It was a pity that Real God Zi Ye had died so soon.

“Back when Real God Zi Ye and I went into the dark region, Real God Zi Ye died and I lost contact with the Lineage of Star entirely. The experts in Lineage of Star must be worried sick,” Jian Wushuang muttered and he immediately took out a token.

“Hall Master Yuan, how do you do?” Jian Wushuang reported to Hall Master Yuan about his safety.

“Jian Wushuang? Finally, we have news from you. I thought you died!” Hall Master Yuan immediately replied and his voice couldn’t conceal his excitement.

Just as Jian Wushuang had expected, when Jian Wushuang and Real God Zi Ye lost contact with the outside world, both Lineage of Star and Soaring Heaven King Palace had been anxious.

Especially Lineage of Star, they were especially anxious.

After all, Jian Wushuang was the top genius in the history of Lineage of Star. As long as he didn’t die, he would be at the level of Real God Wu Bei at the weakest. One could well imagine his importance.

As for Real God Zi Ye, he was merely a top Chaotic Real God. There were quite a few Chaotic Real Gods like him Soaring Heaven King Palace. Although there would be heartache if they lost him, it wouldn’t be too huge of a loss to Soaring Heaven King Palace overall.

“My life is tough. How can I die so easily?” Jian Wushuang joked.

“Tell me, what happened? Where’s Real God Zi Ye?” Hall Master Yuan asked.
