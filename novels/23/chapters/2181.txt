Chapter 2182 Arrival of Emperor Thirteen.

Emperor Thirteen, an expert from the Ancient Past!He was a mysterious man and no one knew for sure how powerful he was.

Back then, during the battle during the Lineage of Star, the darkness from Abysmal Saint Master had disappeared with just a simple stare.

One simple slash had destroyed Abysmal Saint Master’s body armour and almost killed him.

After fighting head on with Emperor Bai, he had forced Emperor Bai back with a simple sword.

And that was simply a consciousness embodiment!

But now, this was the original body of Emperor Thirteen.

The original body had come personally!

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were excited.

Even though they were clueless about the true identity of Emperor Thirteen, they deduced he was on their side from his previous actions.

Emperor Thirteen reached the centre of the battlefield in front of Blood Emperor.

His looked at Blood Emperor coldly and indifferently.

Even the Blood Emperor shook when he met the gaz… It was cold and arrogant!

Disregarding everything and everyone around.

It was as though to Emperor Thirteen, Blood Emperor was nothing more than air.

Blood Emperor was angry but helpless when he saw that gaze.

Emperor Thirteen had been one of the most powerful men back in the Ancient Past. He was top five in terms of power level during the battle on the Ancient Battlefield.

On the other hand, Blood Emperor was…

Even though he was an emperor from the Blood Clan, there were six emperors from the Blood Clan. He was the weakest out of the seven. He was incomparable to the great Emperor Thirteen.

Back in the ancient past, he would have run without hesitation when he saw Emperor Thirteen.

But now, it was different.

“Emperor Thirteen, I have heard from Demon King Chen Yu that you are in the same state as me. Your Original body fell into a deep sleep and only your consciousness embodiment is around. It does not seem like the case. Now your original body is awake?” Blood Emperor squinted his eyes and stared at Emperor Thirteen. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Great Battle of the Ancient Past was too horrific.

Many of the experts from the ancient past were severely injured and had fallen into a deep sleep. Furthermore, the stronger one was, the longer they would sleep and the harder it was for them to wake up. If not for the Opposing Blood Formation, who knew how long Blood Emperor would take to wake up.

However, Emperor Thirteen…

“Back then, during the battle, your injuries were much lighter than the others’. It is normal for you to wake up after such a short period of time.” The Blood Emperor continued.

Emperor Thirteen stood there coldly, not saying a word.

It was like he did not hear Blood Emperor at all.

Seeing this, Blood Emperor’s face twitched. “Just like in the myths, you really are quiet.”

Back in the Ancient Past, Blood Emperor did not meet Emperor Thirteen before, but he had heard of his quiet nature.

He rarely spoke. Even if he did, he would not speak rubbish.

Even if he spoke, he went straight to the point.

“Emperor Thirteen, what do you want to achieve in coming here?” Blood Emperor stared at Emperor Thirteen nervously.

Emperor Thirteen looked up as a glint of killing intent flashed across his emotionless eyes.

“Killing you!” Two simple words came out of his mouth as it radiated out in the battlefield.

Immediately after he said that, he attacked.

A sword appeared in his hands.

Back at the Lineage of Star, Emperor Thirteen used his fingers as swords and managed to defeat Emperor Thirteen with just his consciousness embodiment.

Now, Emperor Thirteen took out a sword.

This sword looked simple, yet sharp. It only radiated death.

It seemed like an ordinary sword.

Once this sword was drawn, the Blood Mountain Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hands trembled. Jian Wushuang could feel a different emotion coming from the sword.

There was some terror in it, but more of unyielding.

It was the first time Jian Wushuang had felt this kind of unique emotion coming from the Blood Mountain Sword.

Emperor Thirteen swung the sword towards the space where Blood Emperor was in casually.

The swing was so casual it looked like it contained no power at all.

Similarly, there was no divine power nor sword essence felt.

However, the moment the sword started swinging.

Boom!

Heaven and earth was shocked as the heaven and earth at the centre of the battlefield exploded.

A large crack appeared as it enlarged at an unbelievable pace to an astonishing size.

One thousand feet!

Ten thousand feet!

One hundred thousand feet!

One million feet!

It ended up being one trillion feet long.

The moment the crack appeared, everything including spacetime, air and every element there was disappeared.

In this space, there were no elements.

There was only a sword light.

It was dim and Inconspicuous.

On a normal day, this sword light would not attract any attention at all. However, this sword light was the only remaining substance left in this space.

It turned into the one and only, for all eternity.

“This is that sword skill!” Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang stared at this sword light in disbelief.

Both recognized this as the sword skill that had defeated Emperor Thirteen back then.

The only difference was that this sword light was even stronger and more breathtaking.

Everyone was breathless.

Everyone was staring at that sword move.

As for Blood Emperor, his attitude was completely different. Before, he had been almighty, proud and treated Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang as though they were his playthings. This was the same even after Emperor Bai casted Secret Skills of Star Palace.

But now, he was deadly serious when he was dealing with the sword skill that Emperor Thirteen had cast.

When the dim sword light appeared in front of him, the blood-red spear in his hands moved.

Boom~~

A ray of crimson light pierced the sky as the space behind the Blood Emperor turned into Eighteen Asura Hell.

The endless sea of red was out of place in this world.

Blood Emperor became the absolute emperor in this sea of crimson red.

His thrust his blood red spear out.

The moment the blood-red spear moved, deafening roars could be heard from within the sea of crimson red. It was as though the souls and remains within the sea of crimson red were angry and expressing their unwillingness to resign themselves to their fates.
