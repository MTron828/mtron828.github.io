Chapter 64: Ranked at The Bottom

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Palace Master White, may I know which one of these two passed the eighth level?” Though he seemed kind and gentle, there was a trace of insidious coldness inside his eyes when looking at Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.

Palace Master White instantly introduced them one by one, starting with Jian Wushuang, “This is Swordsman, 17 years old. He passed through the fourth level.”

“Oh?” Bai Cheng glanced at Jian Wushuang with a faint smile and said, “The fourth level. He would be ranked at the bottom among the many disciples of Dragon Palace. But he’s young. If there are no accidents, it’s possible for him to pass the seventh level before 20. He can reach the same level as Golden Dragon Ambassador Ye and would barely be an expert in the Tianzong Dynasty.”

Hearing what he said, Ye Rufeng smiled faintly and ignored it. He did not dare to show any disdain.

However, Jian Wushuang frowned and felt unpleasant.

“I might reach the level of Ye Rufeng?”

“I might barely become an expert?”

Even I can’t imagine what I might achieve in the future. What makes Bai Cheng think he can judge me with one glance in such a condescending manner, acting as if what he says will definitely come true in the future.

How arrogant and conceited can he be?

Even though he was unhappy, he didn’t openly offend Bai Cheng.

“This is Yang Zaixuan. He is the one who passed the eighth level and he is currently 21 years old,” replied Palace Master White.

Bai Cheng turned to face Yang Zaixuan and fixed his eyes on him before saying, “To pass through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate at 21 years old, you’re promising. In Dragon Palace, I’m afraid that there is no one but me who could suppress you.”

“You mean you are stronger than me right now?” Yang Zaixuan’s expression fell.

Bai Cheng didn’t answer him, he just smiled confidently.

“Palace Master White, no one is in the Dragon Gate, right?” Bai Cheng asked. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Yes.” Palace Master White nodded.

“Okay, I have not been tested in a long time. Today, let me give it a try.” After saying that, he immediately entered the Dragon Gate.

Both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan, who were supposed to leave, stopped and looked carefully at the Golden Pavilion to see what would happen.

After entering the Dragon Gate, Bai Cheng quickly passed through the first level, causing it to light up. Then he continued moving forward smoothly.

He passed eight levels in succession.

Bai Chong entered the ninth level and stayed in it for a long time before the ninth level finally lit up, releasing a golden light.

The ninth level of Dragon Gate, passed!

“He actually passed the ninth level?” Ye Rufeng was shocked and couldn’t say anything. It should be known that even if it was him, he would not be able to pass it, even after trying his best. However, Bai Cheng succeeded.

He really was the top genius in Dragon Palace!

“This is the strongest person in Dragon Palace, so awesome!”

“Though Yang Zaixuan is great, he is new and young. He can not compete with Bai Cheng yet.”

“We thought Yang Zaixuan would be strong enough to be Bai Cheng’s opponent, but the truth is that he is far away from him for now.”

A large number of disciples of Dragon Palace in front of the Dragon Gate were discussing the recent events secretly.

Not long after that, Bai Cheng walked out of the Golden Pavilion. Under the watchful eyes and shocked expressions, Bai Cheng walked over to Yang Zaixuan again and smiled slightly before saying, “You’ll need to work harder, Freshman.”

After saying that, Bai Cheng left without looking back. Since Jian Wushuang only passed the fourth level, Bai Cheng did not even give him a second glance.

“He is really arrogant!” Jian Wushuang licked his lips, the battle intent vaguely rising in his eyes.

“Yang Zaixuan, what do you think?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.

“About what?” Yang Zaixuan looked at him indifferently.

“I don’t like him, don’t you want to defeat him?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Crush him under my feet? Hum, he won’t be qualified to be my opponent within one year,” replied Yang Zaixuan.

Hearing that, the corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth quirked up.

“All of you are so arrogant and conceited. Okay, you are peerless geniuses, so it’s normal to be proud of yourselves. Besides, you really are strong.” Jian Wushuang thought.

Someone who just joined, passed the eighth level of the Dragon Gate, and the other one passed the ninth level.

However, he could only pass the Fourth Level after trying his best. So there was a huge gap between him and those two peerless geniuses.

The wider the gap was, the more it inspired him.

There was a gap now, so what?

It should be known that he had only started comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth four months ago!

It’s unbelievable to comprehend both of the Sword Essences of Gale and Earth to such a high level within four months. No matter whether it was Bai Cheng or Yang Zaixuan, they were both older than him and they had spent much more time comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth as well.

“Bai Cheng asserted that I could only be a Golden Dragon Messenger like Ye Rufeng in the future. Hum, let’s see.” Jian Wushuang snorted.

“All right, go back to your places. Yang Zaixuan, Swordsman, you both follow me,” Palace Master White said.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan followed Palace Master White. Ye Rufeng and the Golden Dragon Messenger who brought Yang Zaixuan here followed Palace Master Black to receive their rewards.

These Golden Dragon Messengers had the right to recommend disciples. Every recommendation that passed the test and became a disciple of Dragon Palace would earn the Golden Dragon Messenger a reward based on the strength of the disciple.

In the Dragon Palace.

Both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were curiously examining their surroundings while Palace Master White was telling them the basic information and rules of Dragon Palace.

“Dragon Palace is a Cultivation Sanctuary. You both became disciples of Dragon Palace means that you are talented. In Dragon Palace, there are 238 disciples, not counting both of you.”

“Among the 238 disciples, only one had passed the eighth level of the Dragon Gate, and that was Bai Cheng. But now he has passed the ninth level.”

“16 disciples passed the seventh level.”

“67 passed the sixth level.”

“141 disciples passed the fifth level.”

“The 13 disciples left passed the fourth level.”

After saying this, Palace Master White could not help glancing at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang also could not help touching his nose with an embraced expression.

“There are 238 disciples in total and only 13 of them were at the fourth level. Most disciples were all at the fifth level or higher. It seems that Bai Cheng was right, I am at the lowest level in Dragon Palace right now.”

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t worry about being at the bottom.

It didn’t mean that he would be at the bottom forever.

“So many geniuses are in Dragon Palace. However, the more geniuses the better for me.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were sparkling with excitement.
