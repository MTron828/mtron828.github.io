Chapter 2297 Wait for Me!

After understanding everything, Jian Wushuang could not help but admire and respect him!He had full respect and admiration for his master!

His master was dead but had used his willpower to continue to rule the lands.

He had created a whole new Inverse Cultivation system and created the second Perfect Chaotic Lifeform artificially, how insane was that?

Xuan Yi may have made it sound easy, but Jian Wushuang definitely knew it was not.

Xuan Yi had prepared for it since the Ancient Era.

He had only perfected it two eras later.

How many years had that taken?

It must have been insanely long from the Ancient Era to the First Era.

Then from the First Era to the Second Era.

He did not know how long it was, but he knew that Green Fire World had been formed 40 million years ago!

And Green Fire World was obviously born in the Second Era. Add that to the Ancient Era and First Era... Xuan Yi had spent billions of years.

“Billions of years?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

From his cultivation till now, even after reincarnation, barely a hundred thousand years had passed.

He could not understand the concept of a billion years.

But Xuan Yi had spent so many years and experienced so many failures all for the second Perfect Chaotic Lifeform to emerge. Jian Wushuang respected him for that.

Furthermore, he had not done it for himself.

He had done it for the Seven Star Divine Realm and for the many lifeforms trapped within Seven Star Divine Realm’s restriction formation!

He had been creating a chance for the living to escape!

And he had done it.

Jian Wushuang knew that he probably did not possess such determination and patience.

He could not even fathom a plan that would last billions of years.

But Xuan Yi had done it.

“Master was impressive,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang read on.

“Disciple, sending you down the reincarnation passage was the last I could do for you. Now that that’s done, I can finally rest. It’s all up to you now!”

“You can only use your own strength to grow within the Absolute Beginning Divine World. You must at least reach Emperor Thirteen’s abilities to use the boundless Divine Power given to you by your Perfect Chaotic Lifeform. Use special abilities to unlock the formation, and help the countless Seven Star Divine Realm cultivators and Seven Star Black Sect experts to escape.”

“But once you have chosen to do it, you must be prepared to go against much Absolute Beginning Divine World forces. Of course, by then, the Seven Star Black Sect experts will definitely help you.”

“I set up a Spacetime Formation at the battlefield where your hometown is. It will slowly restore the spiritual influence of heaven and earth at that area, hitting near pinnacle Seven Star Divine Realm levels. The Seven Star Black Sect experts at that battlefield will restore to pinnacle levels.”

“They are strong, and they will help you. As for the mission behind the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, you will know for yourself.”

“Lastly, I’ll pass you an opportunity. These are the five strongest secret skills of Seven Star Black Sect’s pinnacle period, the complete ones. It includes my self-created Heaven Slaughter Skill. Learn them.”

“Take care, lad.”

The message disappeared. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Seven Star Black Sect’s five strongest secret skills, along with the Heaven Slaughter Skill, were all ingrained in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang felt heavy after learning everything.

He knew that his master’s willpower had most likely disappeared after sending that message.

Meaning to say, his master was truly gone.

Despite his master having collapsed in the Ancient era, his willpower remained.

But now, that willpower was gone as well.

“Master... leave it to me.”

Jian Wushuang, in fetus form, still managed to show a tinge of resolution in his black bright eyes.

He had been born in the Seven Star Divine Realm, in Xuan Yi’s forehead-formed Green Fire World. Xuan Yi had spent so many years, along with the effort of countless experts, and had finally sent his soul to the reincarnation passage towards the Absolute Beginning Divine World, creating the second Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.

He now carried the burden and responsibility of the Seven Star Divine Realm.

He needed to reach the formation seal, and lead the countless Seven Star Divine Realm cultivators back to the Absolute Beginning Divine World!

He also needed to fulfil the mission given to him as the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.

“My parents, my brothers, my friends, they are all trapped there. I am their final and only hope. I cannot let them down.” A fire was burning within Jian Wushuang.

A flame of resolution.

“Wait for me guys!” Jian Wushuang howled.

Of course, he knew that it would not be possible in the short-term in his condition.

He needed time to improve his abilities.

He was sure of what had happened, the situation he was in, and what he needed to do next.

“Like Master said, I have succeeded at reincarnation. I should be at my Inverse Cultivation eighth step. I’m a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform now. But how is that different from other ordinary lifeforms?” Jian Wushuang checked his body curiously.

As an infant, he had absolutely no power, but his Soul Power followed him and had not diminished at all.
