Chapter 2000: Demon King Came Into The World

In a lofty palace.

There was a total of three Almighties knelt down on the ground in fear.

“Find out for me!”

“I’d like to know who is the one who is so capable that they could ask Sword Emperor to deal with me on their behalf!!”

“You must find out for me. I want to chop him into pieces!!!”

Yan Zun then was like a raging beast. His face was red and he was raging in anger. The three persons who knelt before him were experts under his command.

Yan Zun was certain that he had never offended Jian Wushuang. Even during the time when they were resolving the matter of Green Fire World, he was merely speaking on behalf of Sanctuary Alliance. It couldn’t be considered offending Jian Wushuang. He never came into contact with Lineage of Star either.

Hence, he was certain that Jian Wushuang didn’t come to look for him because of personal resentment.

The biggest possibility was that other experts got Jian Wushuang to deal with him using an unknown method.

He reckoned that the person only wanted Sword Emperor to trample on him to lose their reputation.

Then, he was embarrassed. Although it was Jian Wushuang who did it, he could only take it in about it.

Because, regardless of Jian Wushuang’s power or influence, they were far beyond him. He had great potential too. Hence, Jian Wushuang was not someone he could offend.

Hence, he could only vent all his anger on the expert who made Jian Wushuang did that.

Yan Zun used all his connections and started investigating.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang appeared before Emperor God Han Ye again.

“Take a look at this mirror token,” Jian Wushuang passed Emperor God Han Ye the mirror token.

Emperor God Han Ye took it over and looked through it carefully. Then, her eyes were shimmering with joy.

After she watched the images in the mirror token, Emperor God Han Ye took a deep breath and bowed politely to Jian Wushuang. “Thank you, Sword Emperor!”

“I trampled Yan Zun on your behalf merely because of the sword stele. There is nothing to thank me for,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Emperor God Han Ye nodded and immediately handed the sword stele to Jian Wushuang.

Emperor God Han Ye had already refined the sword stele before, which was why Jian Wushuang could refine it again with ease.

After refining it, Jian Wushuang started inspecting the sword stele. As expected, there was the last fraction of Sword Principle Xuan Luo in it.

With the combination of three sword steles, Sword Principle Xuan Luo was then completed. Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement.

“Emperor God Han Ye,” Jian Wushuang looked, “Yan Zun could become a Great Emperor and he isn’t stupid. I share no resentment with him but I found trouble with him today on purpose and trampled on him. He should be able to guess that there was someone who paid a price for me to do so. Hence, if nothing unexpected happens, he will stop at nothing to find out who the person is. And, he would find out that it is you very soon.”

“Thank you Sword Emperor for your reminder,” Emperor God Han Ye nodded. She had made the same speculations and she had already decided to immediately leave the ancient battlefield.

As long as she left the ancient battlefield, even if Yan Zun found out that it was her who had made Jian Wushuang do it, it wouldn’t be easy for Yan Zun to find her in the boundless Eternal Chaotic World.

Emperor God Han Ye left while Jian Wushuang returned to Green Fire World. As for if Yan Zun could find Emperor God Han Ye and if Emperor God Han Ye could survive, Jian Wushuang didn’t care.

He merely made a deal with Emperor God Han Ye. Then, the deal had ended. So, everything that followed had nothing to do with him.

In Wushuang City, in the secret room.

There were three green steles towering there in silence. Jian Wushuang sat before the three green steles as he carefully comprehended Sword Principle Xuan Luo in the three sword steles.

Jian Wushuang organized Sword Principle Xuan Luo from the three sword steles. Very soon, a complete and powerful sword principle took form in Jian Wushuang’s head clearly.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and started comprehending the ancient Sword Principle Xuan Luo with full attention.

Time flew past and Jian Wushuang was absorbed in his cultivation.

He went out once in between. He left Green Fire World and the battlefield to go to Lineage of Star.

He refined Universe Galaxy in Lineage of Star and moved it to Green Fire World.

From then on, Lineage of Star’s old lair was set up within Green Fire World.

Then, Jian Wushuang continued to cultivate in seclusion.

In the blink of an eye, one thousand and eight hundred years had passed as he cultivated in seclusion.

In the one thousand and eight hundred years, both the surrounding ancient battlefield and Green Fire World were peaceful.

The growing speed of Green Fire World was terrifyingly fast. There were more and more geniuses that came into the world, and they started to come to prominence in Eternal Chaotic World.

However, such tranquility was merely on the surface. In the darkness, the waves of chaos were surging.

In the darkest place in Eternal Chaotic World.

Gurgle. There was dark river water that covered the entire universe. The river was just like Acheron. The black river water was like water in Acheron.

There was where the old lair of Acheron Palace was located.

Right in the middle of the boundless Acheron water, there was a pitch-black pavilion that towered over the floating island.

In the pavilion, it was dark.

In the darkness, there were figures kneeling in reverence. In one glance, there should be more than dozens of them. All of them were in black robes and the aura that they gave out was powerful. They were all Almighties above Sir God level.

In front of the figures in black, there was a huge bronze sculpture.

The bronze sculpture was about a thousand zhang tall. It had a monster mask on and it had eight hands. Each of the hands were holding different weapons.

At that very moment, the bronze sculpture was quivering vigorously.

The thousand zhang tall body quivered and it shook the mountains and earth. The huge pavilion trembled in the balance too.

The figures in black who knelt before the figure lowered their heads further when they noticed the sight. All of them were so nervous that they were holding their breaths.

Along with the quiver, the bronze sculpture slowly diminished in size.

In a short while, the tall bronze sculpture became a two meter tall brawny man who was in bronze-colored skin.

The brawny man was muscular. He had a beard and his hair was messy. His body had a faint foul smell, just like he was a living savage.

The moment the savage man appeared, the figures in black who were kneeling down shivered in fear.

At the very next moment, everyone got up and cheered.

“Welcome Demon King, demon power is here!”

“Welcome Demon King, demon power is here!”

Their chants continuously reverberated in the dark pavilion.
