Chapter 669: Ninth Heaven Road

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This wormhole leads to the Ninth Heaven Road. Go ahead and enter,” Ling Yu said to the 20 competitors.

The competitors immediately entered the wormhole without hesitation.

The moment Jian Wushuang entered it, he found himself in front of a towering mountain.

The mountain looked like it had been thrust into the clouds, with no end in sight and only a long path leading to its peak.

While staring at the path in front of him, he spotted several figures standing a short distance way, but they had no signs of life.

The10 figures were black-armored Puppet Fighters, each armed with a long black spear, and they appeared to be guarding the path forward.

After glancing at them, Jian Wushuang began to walk forward, along the path. However, the moment his foot touched the first floor, the 10 Puppet Fighters all opened their eyes and stared at him emotionlessly. The next moment, whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The Puppet Fighters all charged at him at the same time Then, after drawing near, they all attacked him with their spears.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

A cold light emanated from the spears and they appeared as if they could pierce through anything.

Jian Wushuang watched calmly as the spear attacks quickly approached him, waiting until the last moment to make his move.

The Heart-killing Sword was already in his hand as he slashed out with a dazzling flash of sword light, at a speed that greatly exceeded the incoming spears as it passed the throats of the Puppet Fighters.

With a single strike, he had defeated all the Puppet Fighters, who then moved back and opened up the path for him.

“It seems that the obstacle on the first floor is not that difficult.”?Jian Wushuang smiled and looked forward as he moved on along the path.

The puppets that guarded each floor of the Ninth Heaven Road were in the same realm as their challengers.

Since Jian Wushuang was in the Skyscraping Realm, the 10 puppet fighters he encountered were at that realm as well.

Among the 20 challengers, those who had reached the Divine Realm would have to face puppet fighters that possessed the same power as a Divine Realm expert.

As a result, the game was fair to everyone.

The challengers could only depend on their comprehension of the Dao, skill, and offensive ability.

A moment later, Jian Wushuang arrived at the second floor. Again, there were 10 Puppet Fighters waiting for him. They were more powerful than the previous 10, but it did not change their fate.

As Jian Wushuang continued on, he effortlessly passed through the third, fourth, and fifth floor. However, when he reached the sixth floor, things changed. He found out that there was a qualitative leap in terms of the Puppet Fighters’ power on this floor.

However, they were still unable to prevent him from moving forward.

The sixth floor, the seventh, the eighth… Jian Wushuang continued on.

At the same time, in a big hall of the Ancient Sect, many Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters had gathered together, including Xuan Yi.

They were watching the progress of the 20 disciples challenging the Ninth Heaven Road.

“They’re moving so fast!”

“Yeah, because it’s just the beginning. They will slow down as they go further, especially once they reach the 16th floor.”

“The Puppet Fighters’ power becomes a level stronger every five floors and the 16th floor, which is the middle of the path, is a big obstacle for the challengers. They will all be forced to slow down at that floor.”

These masters chatted casually while smiling.

Things went just as expected. At the first, the 20 disciples were breaking through the blockades very quickly, but as they continued moving forward, they were all forced to slow down.

When they finally reached the 16th floor, 19 of them made it to the next floor, while only one person failed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

That person was Huo Ying.

“It’s obvious that Huo Ying tried his best. Generally speaking, only those who have comprehended the third Occult can defeat the puppet fighters on that floor. He was lucky to even make it that far given his level of power,” one of the Vice Palace Masters commented.

“Among the six geniuses Xuan Yi brought back from the Firmament Territory Feast, Huo Ying was the weakest, but he has a determined mind. It’s possible that he may reach the superior Divine Realm in the future.”

Huo Ying was the first one to be thrown out of the wormhole. He displayed a bitter smile under the watchful eyes of the onlookers.

He had expected his result, but when the time came, he still could not help feeling embarrassed and frustrated.

He had nobody to blame but himself.

The remaining 19 disciples continued moving forward, even though most of them visibly became slower after the 16th floor. All of them except for Luo Yong and Dong’er. These two had comprehended the fourth Occult and were much more powerful than the others.

“Look, Luo Yong has made it to the 20th floor and is still moving at a fast pace.”

“He has not reached his limit yet, so I guess that he should be able to at least make it past the 24th floor.”

“I agree, but I think he will fail to break through the 25th floor.”

“Dong’er’s situation is similar.”
