Before the many experts, he looked majestic and intimidating at the scene with Heaven Ultimate Gods and Grand Ultimate Gods surrendered under his feet, but he was also on the cusp of what could be a storm as all he had was the supreme life rating pressure. His true strength...was far inferior to anyone on that battlefield.

Any random Heaven Ultimate Gods were enough to crush him.

Therefore, he had to maintain an imposing posture without allowing any room for mistakes. Otherwise, he would not be able to leave the battlefield safely let alone retrieved his Stately Painting once his strength level was exposed.

He had simply done a very good job at disguising himself to the extent that those experts on the battlefield had completely believed him to be an invincible super expert.

The extremely powerful life rating pressure he exerted was of course the crux behind his disguise.

Even Crimson Stone Saint knelt when he unleashed his life rating pressure in the Saint’s Tomb, hence it was tried and tested that even an Undying Saint could not withstand the pressure he exerted.

That made the experts on the battlefield believe Jian WuShuang must be an extremely powerful super expert to be able to display such terrifying pressure.

In addition, he was a Perfect Chaotic Creature who had exceptional abilities in manipulating his divine power breath. No one would be able to discover his real cultivation realm as long as he did not take actions to reveal his divine power level including Heaven Ultimate Gods, Grand Ultimate Gods, and the Undying Saints in seclusion.

None of them could see Jian Wushuang’s real cultivation realm.

The unknown and ambiguity built a daunting experience for those experts on the battlefield.

Those two points convinced the experts on the battlefield that Jian Wushuang was indeed a super expert.

In addition, Jian Wushuang did very well in his disguise as he had not hesitated to leave the battlefield upon receiving the Stately Painting. The Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master would have no qualms handing over the Huangji Golden Pill and Jian Wushuang could have gotten the Huangji Golden Pill had he asked pushingly.

If he had done so, it might have raised doubts about his true identity.

The Huangji Golden Pill was only useful for the Ultimate Gods after all. He was trying to portray himself as a super expert who was superior to Undying Saints, so why would he even care for a Huangji Golden Pill at his level?

Even if he were to get one for his disciples, he did not need to snatch the pill from those groups of experts. Countless forces and sects might be vying to give him the Huangji Golden Pill upon his request.

Matters might have taken a different route had those experts been dubious of Jian Wushuang’s identity.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang was very clear with what he wanted and was not greedy for the Huangji Golden Pill. He merely turned around and left after getting the Stately Painting which only made the entire process of retrieving his Stately Painting and evacuation went smoothly.

“Although I’ve successfully obtained the Stately Painting, I’ve also displayed my strongest trump card—the life rating pressure of a Perfect Chaotic Creature. The pressure would have probably alerted the Will of Heavenly Way.” Jian Wushuang calmed down before raising his head and looked at the void above.

Daoist Xuan Shen once told him that he must not display his life rating pressure unless it was necessary.

The Will of Heavenly Way would be alerted of his existence once he displayed that skill.

Although it was not a life or death situation, the Stately Painting was very important to him and he would not want to miss it. He decided to take the risk and perform the technique after carefully considering the pros and cons.

“This place is far away from the Third Heaven which made the Will of Heavenly Way relatively weak. As this is the first time I’m using it, it will be relatively difficult to locate where I am even if I’ve alerted the Will of Heavenly Way. I’ll just need to be cautious and abstain from displaying this technique for the second time,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Daoist Xuan Shen had also mentioned before that if he used the technique outside of Third Heaven once or twice, it would be relatively hard for the Will of Heavenly Way to detect his location.

At the time, there were no changes from heaven above and earth below when he exerted his life rating pressure. He probably managed to avoid being detected since there was no pressure convergence from the Will of Heavenly Way.

However, if that happened again...

“If that happens again, I must immediately leave the Danyang Holy Domain and go as far away as I can, even if the Will of Heavenly Way doesn’t come after me,” said Jian Wushuang solemnly.

He had too much on his shoulder and could not afford to lose so he had to be cautious not to make even a slight mistake. Otherwise, it might cause a detrimental effect on himself, the Seven Stars Black Sect, and the Eternal Chaotic World!

“Let’s leave here first and find a place to regain control over the Stately Painting,” muttered Jian Wushuang who soon left the forest.

The Third Heaven where countless experts yearned to be was located somewhere in an extremely remote territory.

Somewhere within the Third Heaven’s core...

On a dojo’s high platform, the white-robed bald man who was preaching to billions of divine demons immediately and suddenly felt something after Jian Wushuang exerted his life rating pressure.

“It’s indeed outside of the Third Heaven.”

The white-robed bald man spoke faintly, but his voice was inaudible to the billions of divine demons who were listening to his lecture. His voice instead reached the ears of several other Realm Lords under the guidance of his subconscious mind.

In a bloodied space, the cold and beautiful woman softly replied, “This is troublesome. The Infinite Territory is outside the Third Heaven where the Will of Heavenly Way is weak and our influences are hard to reach. Even if we know he’s right there in the Infinite Territory, we won’t be able to find him.”

In the eternal burning flame, the purple-armored devil awakened as a cold voice came from him.

“There’s nothing we can do now. We can only continue waiting for the day he steps out of the Infinite Territory and arrives in the Third Heaven. Another option will be when he uses his special techniques in the Infinite Territory again and is detected by the Will of Heavenly Way. As long as the Will of Heavenly Way can roughly pinpoint his location—even if it’s only a vague direction or guidance—I’m sure we can hunt him down.”

The blood-clothed woman laughed casually in an exquisite mansion. “Oh, we can only wait then, but I’m sure he’s not stupid. If he knows he’s targeted by the Will of Heavenly Way, he won’t use this unique technique in the future again. I’m afraid it’s not realistic for him to do so again, but we can wait for him to set foot in the Third Heaven one day as it’ll be much easier to find him then.”

“Well, let’s adjourn for now.” The purple-armored devil spoke again before his voice faded away.

The four very powerful Realm Lords were communicating with each other over a long distance and all of them went back to what they were doing after a short exchange.
