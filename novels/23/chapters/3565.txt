“Fortunately, this human-shaped statue array has a time limit of tens of millions of years, which is enough for me. Let’s take it slowly.”

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry. He had experienced too many storms and waves in his two lives. He had also experienced many trials of this human-shaped statue array, he was no longer afraid, and it was useless even if he was afraid.

With the facts in front of him, he could only try his best to pass this trial.

“This human-shaped statue happens to use a sword as a weapon. Its swordsmanship is extremely powerful and contains profound mysteries. I can observe it during the battle. Although I have attacked twice in a row, I have only met it head-on twice. I wonder how its swordsmanship is in other aspects.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, then he struck again, and swept toward the figure.

Soon Jian Wushuang and the human-shaped sculpture again.

While Jian Wushuang was trapped in the middle of the high platform and fighting with the human-shaped sculpture, behind the high platform, in the deepest part of this special space-time, there was a consciousness that had been sleeping for God knows how many years, and then he woke up.

“Has someone come to this place again, and is breaking through the eighteen deadly arrays?”

“The last time someone came to challenge the eighteen absolute formations was three chaos cycles ago. Although the person who came to challenge the eighteen absolute formations ended up dying within it, he was still a Ruler-level figure, and he was more or less on the verge of passing through it. But this time, the only person who came was an Immortal Saint?”

“I didn’t expect a mere saint to be able to come to this space-time. How interesting.”

This consciousness was obviously awakened in the deepest part of this space-time, but it seemed to have complete control over everything in this space-time.

Like what happened to Jian Wushuang on the high platform, this consciousness was also very clear.

“Third brother, third brother.” This consciousness suddenly let out a deep voice, echoing in the deepest part of this space-time.

Not long after, another consciousness also woke up in the deepest part of this special space-time.

“What’s the matter?” A cold voice was heard.

“Have you seen that little guy who is challenging the eighteen ultimate formation?” The first consciousness said.

“He is just an ant. Is He worth you waking me up?” The second consciousness said coldly.

“The saint level is indeed an ant, but this little guy’s ability is extraordinary. Didn’t you see that he has already created the Pinnacle Absolute Art of a Principles Master?

“Moreover, his battle strength doesn’t seem to be much weaker than an ordinary Principles Master of the sixth realm. A mere saint can actually possess such battle strength. If I’m not mistaken, his life level should be extremely high. He might even be a legendary perfect level life form. Such a life form is as rare as a phoenix feather or a qilin horn even in the vast universe.” The first consciousness said.

“So what? Even though perfect level life forms are rare, it’s not like there aren’t any in the vast universe. However, how many people can reach the peak? Not to mention standing at the top of the universe, even stepping into the position of supreme being would be extremely difficult. And this little fellow, even though he has a perfect level life form, from the moment he stepped into this space-time and entered the eighteen ultimate formations, his fate was already determined. Over tens of millions of years, he will never be able to break through the eighteen ultimate formations. In the end, he will still die.” The second consciousness said coldly.

“Mm, you’re right. The eighteen ultimate formations left behind by master are an extremely terrifying test even in the vast universe. In addition, these tests usually target cultivators at the Ruler Realm. If this little fellow is already a Ruler, then with his talent, he might have a chance to make it through in ten million years. Unfortunately, when he entered this formation, he was only an Immortal Saint...”

“The test that the Immortal Saint will face in the eighteen ultimate formations will be tens or even hundreds of times more difficult than that of a Ruler Realm cultivator. After all, it is indeed inconceivable for an Immortal Saint to reach that level in absolute arts. However, when this little fellow entered the eighteen ultimate formations, he already created a peak tier 6 absolute art. His starting point is already very high, so there might be a slight chance.” The first consciousness said.

“Humph, a slight chance? Maybe, but do you think he can succeed?” The second consciousness snorted.

“This...” The first consciousness hesitated for a moment, but smiled bitterly.

“Fourth, don’t forget, we are now at the edge of the universe. It can be said that we are in the barren land of the vast universe. The cultivators born in this barren land are far inferior to those born in the core area of the universe in terms of talent, comprehension, and other aspects. Master had such a great reputation and power in the deepest part of the universe. He had rushed to this space and time for countless years, and there were countless people who deliberately came to challenge the 18 ultimate formation. But in the end, only three people were able to pass!”

“Those three are all top-tier beings in the universe. In fact, they can be said to be the most incredible geniuses. Later on, they became autarchs one after another, and all of them were the most terrifyingly powerful of them all. However, two of them passed the tests at the Ruleric level, while the other was a Principles Master. This Little Fellow is merely an Immortal Saint. Do you think that this little fellow, who was born in a barren land, is even more monstrous than the three decision-making geniuses who passed the eighteen absolute formations?”

“Even though this little guy has a perfect level life form, his life level is only an innate advantage. Even though he has endless potential, it doesn’t explain his talent.” The second consciousness said.

“You’re right.” The first consciousness nodded, obviously agreeing with this point.

In their opinion, not to mention this barren land at the edge of the universe, even if there were super geniuses from all corners of the universe in the deepest parts of the universe…there probably would not be a super monster who could break through the eighteen absolute arrays at the level of the Immortal Saint.

“Third brother, if you have time to pay attention to that little fellow, why don’t you sleep well and recover from your injuries? We followed our master in battle and have been down and out since then, but you probably don’t want to continue like this, right? Only by doing our best to recover can we get out of this predicament as soon as possible.” The second consciousness said.

“Understood.” The first consciousness nodded and immediately fell silent.

The two consciousnesses quickly fell into a deep sleep again. The deepest part of this vast space-time was once again completely silent. Not a single sound could be heard.
