Chapter 2812: Nothing Could Be Done

(Third update!)

——

Whoosh!

The giant blood-red wolf’s sharp scarlet claws swept down. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This claw seemed to tear heaven and earth in half, and the sound of air being torn apart was extremely loud.

Seeing this claw coming, Jian Wushuang’s face was also unusually solemn.

Buzz, buzz, a large amount of divine power swept up crazily.

The blood mountain sword was also trembling crazily.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang made his move...

He just casually swung his sword. It looked like an ordinary person swinging a wooden sword.

However, as soon as he swung his long sword, a sword light immediately lit up.

This sword light was extremely weak, dim, and incomplete.

It was a broken light, a remnant light!

However, as soon as the remnant light appeared, there were at least hundreds and thousands of remnant lights everywhere.

Under the gaze of many experts present, the original Jian Wushuang who displayed the sword skill suddenly turned into hundreds and thousands of people!

It was the eighth move of the space-time sword skill, thousand-sided remnant light!

It was also an ultimate skill.

In the blink of an eye, the two ultimate skills collided head-on.

Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle. Endless divine power collided with each other crazily.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang’s sword light was at an absolute disadvantage.

This was very normal. The power of the ultimate skill also varied. Jian Wushuang had created the space-time swordsmanship by combining the power of the space-time rules. The most terrifying part of this sword was its unparalleled speed, but when it came to the collision of power and power... this sword was at most similar to the Marquis Three Yin’s heart-gouging divine claw.

But compared to the blood-congealed divine claw, it was far inferior.

Boom!

The giant blood-red wolf’s sharp claw only paused for a moment before it crushed down with a crushing force.

The void where Jian Wushuang was was completely covered by a large amount of blood-red divine power, which was crazily annihilating everything.

Marquis of Three Yin had stopped what he was doing and stood in the void quietly watching.

Blood-condensing claw was his most powerful move.

It was much more powerful than the heart-gouging claw.

He was very confident in this move. In his opinion, if Jian Wushuang still had the purple bell barrier, he might have been able to resist this move. But now, the Purple Emperor Bell barrier had been defeated by him, with his own protective ability, he would at least be seriously injured by this claw.

But at this moment...

Whoosh!

A towering sword shadow appeared out of thin air. The sword shadow swept across everything with great power, completely dispersing the blood-red divine power in front of him.

After the blood-red divine power faded, a figure slowly stepped out of the void.

It was Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, although he was in a sorry state, his face did not change at all, and his aura was still very strong.

“Marquis of Three Yin, do you have any more powerful skills?” Jian Wushuang stood there and sneered.

“He is not injured?” The Marquis of Three Yin frowned and stared at Jian Wushuang.

His perception was also very strong. Under his perception, Jian Wushuang was not injured at all. Moreover, Jian Wushuang’s aura was still at the peak level, so it could not be faked. He was indeed not injured.

“I can’t even hurt him with my strongest move. It would be wishful thinking to kill him. I’d better leave first and think about it later.” The Marquis of Three Yin had made up his mind.

“Sword One, your protective ability is beyond my imagination. You’re lucky today, but it won’t end like this. Soon, we’ll fight again.” The Marquis of Three Yin sneered, then he turned around and left.

He was very calm. He was not worried that Jian Wushuang or the experts of the Sword Alliance would keep him.

Jian Wushuang had no intention of keeping him.

After all, his strength was above everyone else’s.

After the Marquis of Three Yin had walked away, many high-level experts of the Sword Alliance immediately surrounded him.

“Alliance Master, are you okay?” Snake Elder asked.

“I’m fine.” Jian Wushuang shook his head, but his face was very serious.

“Marquis of Three Yin...” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Although the Marquis of Three Yin could not do anything to him in this battle, Jian Wushuang knew very well that the Marquis of Three Yin was stronger than him in terms of real strength. Although he did not use his full strength in this battle... he did not use the mountain and river map.

However, Jian Wushuang knew that even if he used the mountain and river map and the thousand treasures great world with his full strength, he would still not be able to defeat the Marquis of Three Yin.

He could be considered the best and strongest among the Peak Divine Masters, but there was still a gap between him and the real Invincible Divine Master. He did not know this gap before, but today, when he fought with the Marquis of Three Yin, he completely understood it.

“What is the background of the Marquis of Three Yin? Why did he come to fight with me?” Jian Wushuang frowned for a long time..

“You stay in the Sword Alliance. I’ll go to Crimson Rock Castle.”

Jian wushuang instructed and immediately headed to Crimson Rock Castle.

...

In the void far away from the Sword Alliance’s nest.

The Marquis of Three Yin, who had just left the Sword Alliance, stopped here. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several figures appeared around the Marquis of Three Yin. They were the people from the Heaven Void Palace led by Chen Kong.

“Sir, that Sword One...” Chen Kong asked carefully.

“He’s still alive. I didn’t manage to kill him,” the Marquis of Three Yin said.

“Didn’t manage to kill him?” Chen Kong and the others could not help but be startled.

“Although this Sword One’s strength is not bad, he is still a distance away from the invincible reverent god. I can easily suppress him in a head-on battle. However, his protective ability is extremely formidable. It can even be considered abnormal. I have already used many methods, including my strongest ultimate move, but in the end, I was unable to injure him. With such a terrifying protective ability, unless the Palace Master personally acts, no one in our Heavenly Void Temple, including the entire Heavenly Void Realm, can kill him,” the Marquis of Three Yin said.

Chen Kong’s expression changed.

He was very clear about the Marquis of Three Yin’s methods. Since the Marquis of Three Yin had said so, then Sword One’s protective ability was really strong.

“If the Sword One doesn’t die, then it will be extremely difficult for us to conquer the Pill Sun Sacred World,” Chen Kong said.

“Yes, this Sword One is very difficult to deal with. Even if I use my full strength, I won’t be able to do anything to him. On the other hand, he can rely on his domain methods and his protective ability to tangle with me. With his strength, if he is determined to tangle with me, I might not have the chance to free up my hands. Without me, it would be impossible for you people to conquer the Pill Sun Sacred World,” the Marquis of Three Yin said.

“That how to do? Should we give up on this?” Chen Kong could not help looking over.
