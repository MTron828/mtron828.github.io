4278 Jian Wushuang’s Death (Part One)

The Ancient Path of Stars. Sixteenth City.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in the void, quietly recovering his divine power and divine body.

Some of the Ultimate Rulers who had rushed over after hearing the news looked at Jian Wushuang with complicated expressions from a distance.

Although they had not witnessed the battle between Jian Wushuang and the four unparalleled Rulers, they had been watching it in secret.

!!

They had thought that with the four unrivaled Rulers attacking, even a top figure would not be able to escape death. They had not expected that Jian Wushuang would be able to counterattack and reverse the outcome! He had turned the tide with his own strength and killed four invincible Rulers!

What kind of terrifying combat power was this?

Commander Han Shan, Commander Han Feng, and the others also looked at Jian Wushuang from afar. There was no longer fear and horror in their eyes, but deep respect.

Others only knew that Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was unparalleled and that he could fight against four people alone. they did not know that Jian Wushuang was only a fifth stage Ruler!

With the power of a fifth-stage Ruler, he had killed four invincible Rulers!

This kind of thing was simply unheard of since ancient times. Not only was it unprecedented, it would probably never be heard of again!

“There’s something terrifying about Blood Sword!” Muttered Commander Mountain Shaker.

There were even more people staring at Jian Wushuang with burning eyes.

“After this battle, Blood Sword will become a god and his name will shake the universe!”

“From now on, the power structure of the last eight cities of the Ancient Path of Stars will change because of Blood Sword. He will become the tenth magnate of the last eight cities!”

“Unparalleled! Blood Sword God seal!”

“Blood Sword, ascend to the throne of the giants on the Ancient Path of Stars!”

Countless people were secretly amazed.

Just as the crowd was boiling with excitement, suddenly, an extremely discordant low laugh sounded from the outermost part of the crowd.

“Oh, it’s so lively.”

A hunched man with spikes on his back and a pale face walked in with a sandalwood box in his arms.

This person was Qiu Long!

“Where did this person come from?”

This person is barging in and out of his way. How rude.

“Hmph, where did this brat come from? Get lost.”

“You’re courting death!” An Ultimate Ruler, who was almost invincible, frowned and looked displeased. He reached out to grab Qiu Long, trying to pull him behind him.

Before he could touch Qiu Long…

“Get lost!”

“Die!” Qiu Long casually slapped out and sent this near-invincible Ultimate Ruler flying ten thousand feet away. He fell from the sky like a cannonball and smashed into the great emperors, raising a cloud of dust.

When everyone saw this scene, their throats rolled and they swallowed their saliva. They did not dare to make a sound.

Just like that, Qiu Long walked out from the crowd and raised his head to look at Jian Wushuang, who was sitting cross-legged in the void.

He first took out a Mystic Light mirror from his waist and looked at it as if he was verifying his identity. Then, he looked up at Jian Wushuang and chuckled, “Blood Sword, I’ve finally found you.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes and frowned, “Is there something you need?”

Hearing this, Qiu Long let out a strange smile and said, “It’s nothing. I just want to borrow something from you.”

“You want to borrow something from me?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said, “What are you borrowing?”

Qiu Long was not in a hurry to reply. Instead, he stepped on the void with his right foot and soared into the sky. He stretched out his hand and slapped at Jian Wushuang!

He laughed in a low voice, “Let me borrow your head!”

Boom!

Before he could land his palm on Jian Wushuang, the spikes on his back had already turned into countless black chains and shot toward Jian Wushuang!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The speed of these spikes was extremely fast, like countless cannonballs, creating a series of intense sonic booms in the air!

“What?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Although he did not know who this person was or why he suddenly attacked him, his subconscious battle experience made him instantly take a step back. In a flash, he had already appeared a thousand feet behind him.

“You’re quite fast.”

Qiu Long chuckled and instantly turned into a black shadow, dashing toward Jian Wushuang again!

The dense black chains floated behind his back and bombarded Jian Wushuang continuously!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and the Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his hand. He moved quickly and slashed at Qiu Long!

Clang clang clang clang clang!

“Bang bang bang bang bang!”

Jian Wushuang instantly swung thousands of swords at the black chain, causing a long trail of sparks.

Jian Wushuang retreated rapidly, his legs leaving two long white marks in the air.

“What a terrifying power.” Jian Wushuang’s pupils could not help but shrink. He looked down and his purlicue became numb.

That was nothing. Most importantly, Jian Wushuang and the four Ultimate Rulers had used their divine bodies by force and the Eternal Night Kingdom had been destroyed. Their divine bodies were already riddled with holes. After the battle, the pain of their divine bodies being torn apart was extreme.

“Not bad. Again!”

...

Qiu Long Zhang Kuang laughed sinisterly as he charged at Jian Wushuang again with a crazy battle intent in his eyes!

“Go die die die die die die die die die die die!!!”

“Peng peng peng!”

Countless black chains charged at Jian Wushuang at an even faster speed!

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened and he quickly slashed out with the Wuqi Divine Sword. Every time he hit the chain, Jian Wushuang felt his body shake violently.

Every time the chain smashed down, it was extremely heavy!

“We can’t continue like this!”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and shouted with a serious expression, “Split open the sky!”

In an instant, the sky-opening sword radiance turned into a roaring river and slashed down at Qiu Long!

“Who can such soft power kill?”

Qiu Long sneered and grabbed the sky-opening sword light.

...

The sharp sword will burst out and kept cutting at Qiu Long’s palm, but it could not even break his defense!

The next moment!

Qiu Long opened his mouth and bit the sky-opening sword light.

Kacha kacha kacha!

The sky-opening sword ray was chewed up and swallowed.

“How is that possible?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed drastically and he could not believe it.

“Blood Sword, it’s my turn next.”

Qiu Long stuck out his spiky tongue and licked his lips cruelly. He then let out a strange smile and stretched out his arms as if he was hugging the heavens and the earth!

“Dragon! God! Cannon!”

Boom!

At his chest, countless divine power condensed and formed a blue ball of light that had been compressed to the extreme!

This blue ball of light was extremely terrifying. Its chaotic and brutal divine power spread out, and even the void cracked.

The next moment!

Qiu Long thrust out his chest and the blue light ball immediately flew toward Jian Wushuang like a missile!

The moment this blue ball of light appeared, it streaked through the air and turned countless space into dust!

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank and his expression became extremely serious. He could not care about the pain coming from his divine body and shouted, “Sundering stars!”
