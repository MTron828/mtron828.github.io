Chapter 879: She’s My Friend

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On Star Island, the trapped people were still attempting to seek the almost impossible dream as usual.

While Jian Wushuang was fully concentrating on his cultivation.

In a blink of an eye, it’s been two years since he came to Star Island.

In the palace of Yin Thunder, Jian Wushuang was sitting quietly in the midst of the endless, dark Thunder Sea absorbing the power of Thunderbolt around. He immediately looked up with a jerk as an unprecedented sharp light radiated from his eyes.

The sharp light was brightly like a Thunderbolt.

“I made it! Divine Yin Thunder.”

His face lit up with ecstacy. The power of Thunderbolt in his body was defensively fragile at the very beginning, but it gradually grew into a pitch-black and terribly powerful divine thunder.

The divine thunder was exactly Divine Yin Thunder.

The level of Divine Yin Thunder was extremely high.

And it was hard to cultivate it.

During the two years Jian Wushuang staying for earnest cultivation in the Thunder Sea, Jian Wushuang suffered all kinds of hardships of Wanlei and finally produced a Divine Yin Thunder.

This was the first Divine Yin Thunder he produced. Since it had just been produced and had some attacking potentials, it had a lot of room for improvement.

There were three levels of Divine Yin Thunder, and now he had just achieved Level One.

But for all this, this divine thunder was far enough to help him achieve a brand new level.

“After two years of earnest cultivation on Star Island, my strength has greatly improved. My Sword Heart has achieved at Level five, and then the first Divine Yin Thunder was produced. I don’t know whether I can pass through Level Two of the black tower?” Jian Wushuang clasped both of his hands, remaining a little bit expectation deep down inside of him.

With such an expectation, he would obviously prove it by himself.

Jian Wushuang left the palace of Yin Thunder at once, and headed to the black tower.

When he just left the palace of Yin Thunder, he saw the whole Star Island was in chaos. A great number of people rose up, rushing towards the Perimeter of Star Island.

Meanwhile, Star Island rang with all kinds of sounds.

“Haha, how could new people come here?”

“It’s been just two years since Blood Mountain came to Star Island. Now another newcomer comes?”

“That new newcomer, Blood Mountain, was strong indeed. As the 13th king on the island, he is not the one we can bother. But this new newcomer, I think, is not as strong as Blood Mountain.”

The whole Star Island was startled by the arrival of the new guy, just like Jian Wushuang’s arrival at Star Island two years ago. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Hearing these sounds, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help raising his brows.

“Another newcomer?”

“Is it Jiu Zui, Ling Long and other people?” Jian Wushuang confused.

Stellar Fog Sea was widely acknowledged as the seond Impasse and now almost no one dared enter into such a place. Over one thousand years, it was not bad that ten people came here. However, it’s been less than two years since he came to Star Island, but another newcomer arrived.

This new guy was likely to be Jiu Zui or Ling Long who had come to Stellar Fog Sea together with him.

At the thought of this, Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and headed to the Perimeter of Star Island.

At the Perimeter of Star Island, a long, Aquamarine-colored, particularly beautiful figure was surrounded in the center.

Countless burning eyes tarted towards this gorgeous figure, even more burning than those eyes on Jian Wushuang two years ago.

At least, Jian Wushuang was a male while this newcomer was a female. More importantly, she was a gorgeous and shapely beauty.

If such a beauty was in the Eternal World, numerous people would be definitely tempted by her, let alone those “prisoners” who had been stuck on Star Island for a long time.

Although there were some female cultivators stuck on Star Island, the number of them was limited and they were far less good-looking than this woman.

Numerous eyes were sticking to this gorgeous figure as if they were starving wolves.

This gorgeous woman noticed the stares of everyone around her as her face grew grim and her heart just sank with a bad feeling.

“Haha, it seems that destiny is kind enough to give us such a beauty. Supposedly, we’ll see a good day in the following life.” A wild and sturdy man said, making no secret of his greedy simle.

This wild man was exactly Shi Mo who had been defeated by Jian Wushuang two years ago.

As he had been stuck on Star Island for millions of years, Shi Mo became very wicked.

However, at this moment…

“This woman is mine.” A cold voice abruptly sounded.

This voice was too determined to make Shi Mo and other people around frowned. Then they all looked toward the speaker.

However, when they found the speaker, Shi Mo immediately smiled flatteringly.

“It’s you, Mr. Tian Quan. Since Mr. Tian Quan was also interested in her, this beauty is undoubtedly yours,” said Shi Mo respectfully, with a fawning smile.

A huge prison as Star Island was, people couldn’t be killed in such a prison and expert coming first was always the elementary principle.

Although you couldn’t be killed here, your rival who was stronger than you could always torment you at any time because it was not subject to laws.

This Tian Quan was one of the renowned kings of the 13 kings on Star Island, including Jian Wushuang. Ranking the sixth among the 13 kings, he was rigorous and competitive.

Except other kings, who dared offense him on Star Island?

If he wanted this woman, who dared say no?

“Well,” The ice-cold man nodded slightly and said with a cold smile. “Take it easy. I’ll take her for at most a thousand years. After that, suit yourself.”

“Many thanks, Mr. Tian Quan.” Shi Mo and people around looked delirious.

A thousand of years?

A thousand of years was a blast, about which they really didn’t care.

“You, come with me!”

Having a look at the Absolute Beauty, Tian Quan’s eyes were filled with wild excitement.

As the Absolute Beauty’s face suddenly changed, she looked frightened, clenching her teeth.

At this moment…

Woosh! A figure suddenly appeared in the Void behind.

Jian Wushuang saw the gorgeous figure with an Aquamarine-colored, long hair surrounded at the middle of people when he came here.

“Just as one expected.” A smile grew on his face when he saw her.

Surely, he also saw the surrounding, including those infatuating eyes of Tian Quan, Shi Mo and others people.

Jian Wushuang’s look grew immediately cold as his body dived down.

Bang!

Like a falling stone, his body landed violently at the middle of people as a fearful atmosphere prevailed everywhere.

Jian Wushuang’s cold eyes darted toward Tian Quan at once.

“She is my friend!”

“Who dares touch her!”
