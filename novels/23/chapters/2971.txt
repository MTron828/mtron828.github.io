Chapter 2972: Kill the Dragon Flame Beast

——

Boom!!

A violent roar resounded across the sky and broke the silence of the dense forest.

Along with a loud dragon roar, an extremely violent aura suddenly rose.

Whoosh!

A strong wind blew, and a large number of towering trees, which were 300 meters tall, were easily lifted up like seedlings. A huge monster really appeared in the world.

“Is that the Dragon Flame Beast?”

Jian Wushuang and Ah Chao stood in the void at the edge of the dense forest. They both looked at the fiery-red monster in front of them.

This huge monster was like a lion. It had a huge and ferocious head, and its body was covered with red scales. It also had a pair of huge wings on both sides of its body. These wings were dragon wings!

It was surrounded by raging flames, which burned everything. Anyone standing around it could feel the scorching heat.

“Dragon Flame Beast at the True Saint-level has a strong aura,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“Look, the captain and the others are attacking.” Ah Chao’s eyes were shining.

In the void in the middle of the dense forest, the tough man, Puyu, and Xue Dong King had already attacked with all their strength.

The three of them surrounded the Dragon Flame Beast and displayed their monstrous strength, frantically attacking to kill it.

Although the Dragon Flame Beast was a True Saint Beast, its combat strength was only around a first-level True Saint. Facing the combined attacks of the three of them, it naturally could not resist, especially man tie, who was the strongest of the three.

He held a golden ax tightly in his hand.

The golden ax was covered with layers of golden thunder as if the Golden Thunder God was alive.

He waved the golden ax repeatedly, each time as if a golden divine thunder had descended. It was extremely powerful and invincible.

The power contained in the golden ax suppressed the Dragon Flame Beast again and again. Several times when the Dragon Flame Beast wanted to rise, it was pressed down to the ground by the golden ax.

“The strength of this captain is not bad. He is very close to the Star Sea Saint,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

In terms of strength, the Barbarian King was only close to the Star Sea Saint, but it was still slightly weaker.

With the help of Puyu and Xue Dong King, the Dragon Flame Beast could not escape even if it wanted to.

In just a moment, the Dragon Flame Beast was covered in wounds under the attack of the three people. Obviously, it could not hold on for long.

“Is it going to be killed soon?”

The Barbarian King Team’s eyes were filled with anticipation as they watched the Dragon Flame Beast escape.

But right at this moment…

Dong! Dong! Dong!

A low and deep sound suddenly came from the void not far away.

At the same time, a similarly powerful and violent aura slowly rose from the void.

“This is…” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The eight members of the Barbarian King Team immediately looked towards the void.

At the end of the void, an ugly black-armored beast covered in pitch-black scales was rushing over.

The low thud thud thud was the footsteps of this black-armored beast.

The aura of this black-armored beast was extremely powerful.

“Another True Saint Beast?”

“Not good!”

“Damn it, there’s another True Saint Beast near this Dragon Flame Beast.”

The expressions of the Barbarian King Team became ugly.

They were currently trying their best to kill the Dragon Flame Beast, so they naturally did not want any other beasts to disturb them.

If it was just some weaker beasts, such as a few ordinary Saint Beasts, they would be able to deal with them easily.

But in the end, it was a True Saint-level exotic beast.

True Saint-level exotic beasts! Besides the three people who were currently surrounding and killing the Dragon Flame Beast, who else could contend against them?

Whether it was Barbarian King, Po Yu, or Xue Dong King, the three of them were at the most critical moment. The Dragon Flame Beast was about to be killed. If any of them left at this time, the Dragon Flame Beast would easily find an opportunity to escape, by then, all their efforts would have been in vain.

“Ten breaths, at most ten breaths, we can kill the Dragon Flame Beast. Ah Chao, Heavenly Sword Marquis…the five of you, think of a way to stop the black-armored beast!” The Barbarian King shouted.

As the leader of the Barbarian King Team, this was his best judgment at the first moment.

The three of them continued to kill the Dragon Flame Beast while Jian Wushuang and the others tried to stop the black-armored beast.

In just ten breaths, the five superior False Saints should be able to hold on.

“Kill!”

“Stop him!”

“Evil creature, die!”

The five superior False Saints, including Jian Wushuang, moved at once.

The five of them appeared in front of the black-armored beast and then attacked.

Except for Jian Wushuang, the other four immediately displayed their strongest strength.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Five powerful attacks were directed at the black-armored beast.

Jian Wushuang’s attack was also included. Although he did not use his full strength, the power of his casual attack was not inferior to the full strength of a superior False Saint.

In the face of these five attacks, the black-armored exotic beast spat out two streams of black air from its nose. Then, its body moved strangely, like a demonic charm.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

The black-armored exotic beast left several afterimages in the void, but its body easily passed through the attacks of the five people.

“What?”

“This speed…”

“It’s so fast. This beast’s speed is too fast.”

Ah Chao and the other three people were shocked, but the black-armored beast had already appeared in front of him.

Two sharp claws flashed like two streams of black light.

Jian Wushuang was the only one who could see some shadows, but the other four people did not have time to react.

Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!

The black-armored beast easily flashed twice, but only twice. Ah Chao and the other four peak false saints were hit by the sharp claws of the black-armored beast. Although their divine bodies were not shattered, the four of them were severely injured, they all spat out blood.

The four of them also retreated in a sorry state.

In addition, the black-armored beast did not only attack the four of them, but also the five of them at the same time.

Jian Wushuang was also one of the targets of the black-armored beast, but unfortunately, its sharp claws were blocked by Jian Wushuang.

“Human…”

The black-armored beast stared at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

An exotic beast at the True Saint level was not much inferior to a human cultivator in terms of intelligence. When it first saw Jian Wushuang and the others, it knew that Jian Wushuang’s aura was the weakest, but it did not expect that the weakest human…instead, it blocked its attack head-on.
