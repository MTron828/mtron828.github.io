Chapter 1911: The Powerful Emperor God Tian Ling

“Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Tian Ling is really powerful!” Qian Mingzi said.

“Mm, I can tell,” Jian Wushuang had already stopped then.

He had seen the way Emperor God Tian Ling had attacked earlier.

He could feel Emperor God Tian Ling’s terrifying spear techniques.

In a far distance, he tore spacetime and attack. Such techniques required one to have high comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine, at least much higher than Jian Wushuang’s comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Besides, the power of the spear…

One should know that Qian Mingzi had been under Purple Moon Emperor all this while. His power was powerful and also possessed the fighting power of a top twenty on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

Among Emperor Gods in Eternal Chaotic World, Qian Mingzi should be able to be in the top five.

Plus, Qian Mingzi had Chaotic Divine Treasure level armor to protect his body.

Even so, with merely two moves Qian Mingzi was severely injured by Emperor God Tian Ling.

Even then, if it wasn’t for Hall Master Yuan, who had helped using the galaxy formation, Qian Mingzi’s life would be at risk.

“Emperor God Tian Ling, it seems that everyone has belittled you,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and stared at Emperor God Tian Ling.

Emperor God Tian Ling had yet to attack anyone for a long time. Over the years, he had been wandering in the Second Lair and he had hardly shown up.

Back when Jian Wushuang had cornered Soaring Heaven King Palace to a miserable situation, Emperor God Tian Ling had never once left the Second Lair. Then, Jian Wushuang had even suspected that Emperor God Tian Ling found an opportunity and was cultivating at crucial time. It seemed that the truth was so.

Emperor God Tian Ling’s power was much more powerful since the last time he had attacked in front of anyone.

“Emperor God Tian Ling…”

Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church were looking at Emperor God Tian Ling in shock.

In shock, there were more elements of surprise.

Even though they had been teasing one another earlier, they were on the same side after all.

Then, Star Extermination Alliance was at an absolute disadvantage and they were on the brink of collapsing. At such a crucial moment, Emperor God Tian Ling stood out.

To Star Extermination Alliance, it was naturally a great surprise, a good surprise.

“Let me take care of Jian Wushuang and Qian Mingzi. The three of you, go and help the surrounding battlefield,” Emperor God Tian Ling’s voice was cold.

“With you alone, you can handle them both at the same time?” Palace Master Wu Luo creased his eyebrows.

“Hehe, they are merely two bigger ants. Not only I can handle them, it is also rather easy for me to just kill the two of them,” Emperor God Tian Ling sneered. Both his hands exerted strength suddenly and the black spear in his hand quivered. There was a strange exotic beast’s roar reverberated in the void.

Vroom!

The void shook and the space in front of Jian Wushuang and Qian Mingzi shattered.

The black spear brought boundless power and constantly magnified in Jian Wushuang and Qian Mingzi’s eyes.

“The spear…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock.

“Such terrifying power!” Qian Mingzi was terrified.

“Ancient God, the Eighth Finger!”

Jian Wushuang roared and Ancient God’s Eighth Finger suddenly pressed out.

Qian Mingzi’s body grew tremendously and became a devil. The crimson axe in his hands swung out.

The two of them gave their all.

Bang! Bang!

There were two loud bangs!

Then, Jian Wushuang and Qian Mingzi were forced to retreat from the impact. However, the both of them had joined forces after all. It wasn’t like before, when Qian Mingzi had been alone. Hence, it was slightly easier to withstand it.

However, the collision also fully displayed that Emperor God Tian Ling had the upper hand, even if he were to fight alone against two.

Most importantly, Emperor God Tian Ling performed his spear technique rather casually. Obviously, he had yet to go all out.

“Too strong! Emperor God Tian Ling is too powerful. I feel like he isn’t much weaker than Underworld God,” Qian Mingzi roared.

“Underworld God?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

Underworld God, the sixteenth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

In Eternal Chaotic World, he was widely recognized as the number one!

He was extremely powerful. It was said that even if he ran into an ordinary Great Emperor, he could give it a try to fight.

Then, Qian Mingzi said that Emperor God Tian Ling was not much weaker than Underworld God.

“Qian Elder has been following Purple Moon Emperor all these years. He is definitely clear with Underworld God’s power. He might even fought with him once. If he said so, he definitely wouldn’t be lying, Emperor God Tian Ling…” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

In the middle of the galaxy, Emperor God Tian Ling, with snow-white hair, held his spear in one hand. The aura soaring from his body grew intense and suddenly escalated to a brand new level.

Such an aura was enough to suppress anyone at the scene.

Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church were dumbfounded.

They were previously upset with Emperor God Tian Ling’s teasing and disdainful treatment earlier. But then, Emperor God Tian Ling’s had his power as a basis.

“Haha, brother, go all out and kill Jian Wushuang!”

“You must kill him!”

In the other corner of the battlefield, Emperor God Tian Xiao noticed the happenings and immediately laughed wantonly.

Emperor God Tian Ling’s face was cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang and walked to him step by step.

“Jian Wushuang, back then, I wasn’t back and you behaved wildly at Soaring Heaven Land and massacred the experts in Soaring Heaven King Palace!”

“Today, I will kill you and wipe out Lineage of Star to take revenge on behalf of the people in Soaring Heaven King Palace!”

“You have to die!”

A cold voice was heard from Emperor God Tian Ling and he sounded determined.

Everyone around the battlefield quivered when they heard him and they didn’t dare to be in doubt.

Needless to say, Emperor God Tian Ling really did possess the capability to kill Jian Wushuang and destroy Lineage of Star.

However, looking at Emperor God Tian Ling getting closer, the power spreading from Emperor God Tian Ling’s body was getting stronger too. However, Jian Wushuang didn’t look fearful at all.

Nor did he feel anxious.

“Emperor God Tian Ling, you are really strong!”

“I never thought that your power would be this powerful. You’re right. Even if Qian Mingzi and I team up, we wouldn’t be your match.”

“It’s a pity that your opponent isn’t me.”

Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“Huh?” Emperor God Tian Ling’s eyebrows creased.

There were people surrounding that looked at Jian Wushuang subconsciously.

Emperor God Tian Ling’s opponent wasn’t him? Who else?

“I originally wanted to wait until I had defeated Star Extermination Alliance, then only use this trump card when we fought against Supreme Ten Alliance or Almighties Alliance. But it seems that it won’t work. So… Jian Yi, go!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated.
