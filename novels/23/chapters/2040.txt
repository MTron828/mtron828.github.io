Chapter 2041 One Who Survives A Great Disaster Is Destined To Good Fortune For Ever After

“Luckily, I won the bet. Otherwise, the only choice I would have had back then would have been to stop at nothing and play all my trump cards to fight a life and death battle,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. With such actions, he might have caused some casualties among the Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World. However, there was no doubt that he would have died.

Now, at least he’d survived.

In the golden whirlpool, Jian Wushuang waved. Vroom!

There was a ray of dark light that burst out. It was Jian Wushuang’s Qian King ring that contained his treasures, including Blood Mountain Sword, River Mountain Map and so on.

The Qian Kun ring had always been under the coverage of his divine power. Most importantly, due to the fact that he was still alive, Qian Kun ring had an owner and it wouldn’t spread any aura. In addition to that, it was covered with his divine power. Hence, the thirteen Great Emperor couldn’t find it.

Jian Wushuang put on his Qian Kun ring and his Five Gem armor. At the same time, he took out two communication tokens.

The two tokens belonged to Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao. As long as they were still within Three-Emperors World, they would be able to keep in touch with Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang simply glanced through it and he knew that the two Great Emperors had sent him many messages after they’d left Imperial Peak.

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows. He didn’t reply and put the two tokens away.

He didn’t want anyone to know that he was alive, including the people in Sanctuary Alliance.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s body turned illusionary and appeared in the middle of the golden whirlpool, above the huge Emperor Supreme Rock. There was a faint golden light there. The golden light was much brighter than the other places in the golden whirlpool. The golden light was actually a unique prohibition.

“If I’m not mistaken, the prohibition is a vital element that connects the golden whirlpool with the Emperor Supreme Rock,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes while he walked before the golden prohibition. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

As his divine power scattered around the huge golden whirlpool, he also studied the revolving golden whirlpool. By then, he had already realized the existence of the golden prohibition.

He could tell that the golden prohibition was extremely mysterious. Besides, the boundless pure energy in the Emperor Supreme Rock actually surged through the golden prohibition.

In other words, without the golden prohibition, it would be impossible for the golden whirlpool to obtain energy from the Emperor Supreme Rock. Nor would it be possible for the dark millstone to operate.

“Previously, we didn’t understand the structure of the golden whirlpool at all. We only knew to damage the golden whirlpool blindly. In the end, although the golden whirlpool was damaged, the experts in Three-Emperors World repaired it with ease.

“If I could find out about the golden prohibition sooner and figure out a way to destroy the golden prohibition, I’m afraid it wouldn’t be that easy if the Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World wanted to repair it,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

“Don’t act hastily. Let’s take a look.”

Jian Wushuang muttered and slowly reached his hand into the golden prohibition.

Suddenly… Rumble. A vast ocean of pure energy flowed to Jian Wushuang directly.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang was shocked at first. Then, he was filled with excitement.

He could feel that the golden prohibition contained an unbelievable amount of pure energy. The pure energy wasn’t utilized by the surrounding whirlpool but could be refined and absorbed straight away.

“Could it be…” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes while he had an idea that popped into his head.

The moment the idea rose, it couldn’t be suppressed.

Jian Wushuang slowly walked forward and then submerged himself within the golden prohibition. He was covered under the golden prohibition entirely.

After Jian Wushuang entered the golden prohibition, he felt that he was submerged into an ocean of pure energy. There was too much pure energy and it was immense. His divine body couldn’t help but shiver. He was shivering in excitement.

Jian Wushuang could feel the blood in his body boiling and his cells were cheering with joy.

He didn’t intentionally guide it, but the surrounding pure energy poured into his divine body continuously. His divine body instantly refined and absorbed it.

The speed of refinery and absorption was shockingly fast.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and started absorbing pure energy to his heart’s content.

Thanks to the speed of absorption, he who had originally only had less than ten percent divine power, started recovering at a shocking speed.

Ten percent, twenty percent, thirty percent…

In merely half a day’s time, his divine power recovered by more than thirty percent.

“Haha, such a recovery speed is much faster than King of Venomous Worms!” Jian Wushuang was extremely excited.

King of Venomous Worms had been parasitizing his body and fighting along with him. He would recover Jian Wushuang’s divine power as well as a wound.

However, when Jian Wushuang reached the seventh step of the perfect Chaotic divine body, King of Venomous Worms’ recovery speed wasn’t significantly helpful to Jian Wushuang.

The trip to the dark millstone was dangerous and Jian Wushuang wasn’t sure what he would go through. Hence, he didn’t want King of Venomous Worms to take the risk. He had left King of Venomous Worms in Green Fire World and he’d left a drop of inheritance blood essence. He was prepared for the worst.

If he were to pass away, King of Venomous Worms could rely on the drop of inheritance blood essence to look for the next Ancient God.

Fortunately, he’d done so. Otherwise, when his divine body collapsed and turned into the scattered divine power all over the golden whirlpool, the existence of King of Venomous Worms would be hard to conceal. He most likely would die at the hands of the Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World.

Now, although Jian Wushuang didn’t have King of Venomous Worms to recover his divine power for him, the constant flow of pure energy within the golden prohibition was stronger by a few folds.

In two days’ time, his divine power completely recovered.

Jian Wushuang never once left the golden prohibition but constantly absorbed the pure energy. His refinery and absorption speed became faster and faster.

“Like the saying, one who survives a great disaster is destined to good fortune for ever after. It is true!!!”

Jian Wushuang laughed.

He knew clearly that the golden prohibition was absolutely a great opportunity for him.

A great opportunity!

One should know that the first stage to the third stage in the sixth step of inverse cultivation required an accumulation of enormous divine power.

Jian Wushuang put in extravagant time and effort to accumulate his divine power to his extreme limit through Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, and also via absorbing Star Demon Core.

At the seventh step of inverse cultivation, Chaotic Supreme possessed a perfect Chaotic divine body that was made of pure divine power. Hence, the divine power required to level up from stage one to stage three was an enormous amount of accumulated divine power.

Now, Jian Wushuang was in the golden prohibition and the golden prohibition obtained boundless pure energy from the Emperor Supreme Rock. He could continue to enhance his divine power endlessly through absorbing pure energy until he reached… the second stage!
