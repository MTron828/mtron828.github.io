Chapter 2271 Revenge Kill

“What a strange sabre skill.” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened but he did not slow down one bit.Power of Spacetime rolled out as Jian Wushuang moved like a phantom, easily avoiding all three sabre lights.

He had just found his composure.

Weng!

A strong Soul Attack was charging towards him.

It had been performed by a Chaotic Divine Demon not too far away.

The Chaotic Divine Demon was best at Soul Attacks, but he could only perform Third Stage Great Emperor levels under the restrictions on the earth. But Jian Wushuang had his Five Gem Armor, Soul Swallowing Pearl, and his own strong soul power.

The Soul Attack dissipated without even making Jian Wushuang frown.

As Jian Wushuang was being Soul Attacked, a black shadow appeared before him.

The black shadow held a dark, eerie dagger oozing with black liquid. It was poison.

“Die!”

A devious smile could be seen from the face of that shadow as the dagger went straight for Jian Wushuang’s skull.

At such a close distance, at such high speeds, Jian Wushuang could not have possibly avoided it.

But at that moment, boom!

His mind went blank – he was being Soul Attacked by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack was being complemented by his own soul power, the Golden Light Scripture from the Three Divine Lights, and the Soul Swallowing Pearl. Only Half Step Divine Demons could block it. Chaotic Divine Demons had no way to resist.

The black shadow’s eyes turned hollow and paused right there. The dagger did not move an inch either.

Xiu!

A golden light went bursting by.

It was the Hong Jun Golden Sword, slicing the black shadow down.

That was the end of the black shadow.

Under the attack of so many Ancient Era experts, Jian Wushuang did not die immediately but had taken one down instead.

Now Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was at full speed.

Hua!

Hua!

Hua!

The swordsmanship seemed casual but was, in fact, unfathomable, and sliced Ancient Era experts, complemented by his great Divine Power and perception abilities.

There were too many Ancient Era experts for Jian Wushuang to block everything completely.

So he did not bother to resist. As he was being attacked, he kept striking back.

His Soul Attack was also on full blast.

“Careful!”

“Watch out for his Soul Attack!”

“His swordsmanship as well!”

“Bullshit! With his Soul Attack, he won’t be able to block it even if we Chaotic Divine Demons took precautions!”

“Then let’s not give him the chance to attack one-on-one!”

In a fit of anger, the Ancient Era experts started teaming up.

But soon they realised something – Jian Wushuang’s self-defence mechanism was too strong!

Indeed, Jian Wushuang was not able to block all of their coordinated attacks.

That meant that Jian Wushuang was constantly being struck in vital places like his head. Even with his protective gear, the sheer power alone should have greatly injured Jian Wushuang.

If it had been them, their holy bodies would have long ago collapsed, but Jian Wushuang?

Jian Wushuang had been struck more than a hundred times since the battle had begun, but he showed no signs of collapsing. In fact, his aura has not been weakened at all.

“A hundred-odd attacks, but he’s still fine?”

“Don’t talk about collapsing, how is he still uninjured?”

“Impossible.”

The Ancient Era experts were all in awe.

If they had Inverse Cultivation’s seventh step, the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body, they would not have found it impossible.

Jian Wushuang, with his Perfect Chaotic Holy Body, as long as he had enough Divine Power, would recover immediately no matter how bad the damage.

Under attacks from at least a Third Stage Great Emperor, it was impossible for one not to get injured.

Jian Wushuang seemed uninjured but it was because he had recovered immediately with Divine Power.

That kept his fighting power and aura at the pinnacle.

“Die!” Jian Wushuang moved like a phantom as his Blood Mountain Sword went for an Ancient Era expert’s throat like a snake out of its hole.

“Crap,” the Ancient Era expert was taken aback. By the time he could react, a great Soul Attack had struck him.

Chi!

The sword light had pierced his throat.

“Crap!” The surrounding Ancient Era experts were all looking awful.

That was the eighth expert Jian Wushuang had taken down.

The battle had not been going on for long, but eight Ancient Era experts had fallen.

How terrifying was that?

“How could that be possible?” Bing Shan frowned. “If I received that much damage, I would have been severely injured by now.”

“Not just him, Emperor Bai as well,” Leng Ruxue smiled.

Bing Shan noticed the battlefield with Emperor Bai as well.

Amongst the 138 Ancient Era experts, a significant number of them were going against Emperor Bai as well.

Emperor Bai was in a similar situation to Jian Wushuang, but his aura had not decreased under the attacks.

“Inverse Cultivation is indeed impressive,” Bing Shan murmured.

“I said they could never kill Jian Wushuang. Holding him back is a different thing,” Leng Ruxue said.

“It’s too early for that, most of them have not given their all yet,” Bing Shan said.

Leng Ruxue raised her eyebrow.

Then... Weng!

The Heaven’s Horizon shook as the ripples along it became more concentrated.

There was greater movement.
