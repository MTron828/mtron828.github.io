Chapter 2133 Revisiting Three Emperors World

At the edge of the Three Emperors World, Jian Wushuang’s figured appeared above the boundless Void.As he appeared, his appearance and the aura on him began to change.

Within a moment of time, he turned into a cold young man with a sword on his back. His aggressive aura was too strong to not notice. It was as if he would strike anyone down the moment he was not pleased. His aura was at a regular Emperor God’s level, meaning to say a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm expert.

There were many similar experts in the Three Emperors World.

“Let’s go,” Jian Wushuang went straight for the Three Emperors World’s core – the Imperial City.

With his previous experience, he was able to navigate the way there easily.

After some time, Jian Wushuang arrived at the Void near the Imperial City.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang stood in the Void and looked over the huge city.

The last time Jian Wushuang had been there, the Supreme Emperor Stone had already been destroyed, leading to the collapse of the Imperial City’s formation. But it seemed that the formation had been re-activated.

“Looks like the Three Emperors World has found another power source,” Jian Wushuang mumbled but was not surprised.

A formation only the size of a city did not require too much power – it was not hard for the Three Emperors World to re-activate it.

But the Dark Millstone outside was too gigantic. With the Supreme Emperor Stone destroyed, they could not find an alternative power source, which kept it from re-activating.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and headed towards the Imperial City gates.

The gate was heavily guarded, as usual. During his way in, Jian Wushuang felt a concealed aura.

The aura could not have been sensed by normal experts, but Jian Wushuang could feel it clearly. It was a Great Emperor.

“A Great Emperor seeing to the guarding of a city gate personally?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Obviously, after the previous incident, the Three Emperors World had increased their level of vigilance.

Jian Wushuang was immediately stopped at the gate, and a silver-haired elder appeared in front of him.

“Do you intend to enter the Imperial City?” he asked Jian Wushuang.

“Indeed,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“May I get your name, as well as which family or domain you come from?” the silver-haired elder asked.

Jian Wushuang frowned, and said, “My name is Duan Lingfeng. I have no family, and I’ve always acted alone. I’m from the Dragon Heart God Mansion.”

The Dragon Heart God Mansion was one of forty-eight God Mansions the Three Emperors World controlled. Jian Wushuang himself had never travelled to that place.

“Duan Lingfeng? Dragon Heart God Mansion?” the silver-haired elder nodded. “Please give me a moment to confirm this.”

“Confirm?” Jian Wushuang felt something was amiss.

Unexpectedly, the silver-haired elder raised his head and said, “Sir, I have just talked to the ruler of the Dragon Heart God Mansion owner. He has not heard of a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm expert by the name of Duan Lingfeng.”

“What nonsense is this? The Three Emperors World is so large with countless experts. I myself rarely show my face outside, of course, I would be unrecognised by others. You mean I cannot enter the Imperial City because of this?” Jian Wushuang was angered.

“My apologies, but the Sanctuary Alliance has already given their orders. Any lone experts that we are unable to properly identify are all barred from entering the Imperial City. You’ll need an expert from the high ranks of the Sanctuary Alliance to give you the green light,” the silver-haired elder said.

“Such a hassle, might as well not enter,” Jian Wushuang snorted and turned away.

The silver-haired elder watched Jian Wushuang leave emotionlessly.

“Duan Lingfeng? A Middle Stage Chaotic Realm expert, unrecognised by anyone, what a freak. Under these circumstances, it’s best we don’t allow these kinds of people into the Imperial City,” the silver-haired elder mumbled to himself.

…

In a Void not far from the Imperial City, Jian Wushuang stopped. His expression was visibly sour.

“How could I be rejected at the gates?” Jian Wushuang mumbled.

“It’s normal. You entered the Imperial City using the same method as previously, causing them their Supreme Emperor Stone. With that heavy lesson, it’s normal for them to take precautions,” the suppressed Abysmal Saint Master said from within the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Our plan was to infiltrate and attack the Three Emperors World’s lair from within. If we can’t even get through their gates, how will we succeed?” Underworld God said.

Jian Wushuang had explained the mission to the Great Emperors on the way.

“It is a bit troublesome, but there is a way,” Jian Wushuang said solemnly. “They simply bar unknown experts from entering. If that’s the case, I’ll create an identity, or simply disguise myself as a Three Emperors World expert.”

“Disguise?”

“How would you disguise yourself?” Abysmal Saint Master asked.

“No rush, let’s find the Three Emperors World’s intelligence unit first.” Without further explanation, he went on his way.

The Three Emperors World had twelve states, eighty-four God Mansions, and countless domains.

Within such a large domain, the influence spheres were similarly complicated, and naturally there would be organisations that sold intelligence. Jian Wushuang soon found a relatively powerful intelligence unit.

“I need intelligence regarding some Chaotic Realm experts, those that have disappeared or fallen, the more ancient the better,” Jian Wushuang instructed.

“Please wait.” The personnel immediately started organising their information. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Within the Blood Mountain Sword, the seven Great Emperors, Jian Yi included, looked at each other. They understood what Jian Wushuang was trying to do.

He was about to disguise himself as a Three Emperors World expert that had vanished for years.

Those kinds of experts hid well, to the extent that no one knew if they were still around. It was normal for those kinds of experts to appear once in a while.

Within moments, the personnel from the intelligence unit handed Jian Wushuang a detailed list of the Chaotic Realm experts.

Jian Wushuang began analysing the list.

There were ten people on the list, all of whom had vanished.

The youngest missing case was 160,000 years ago, whereas the oldest missing case had happened eight million years ago. It was almost certain that he had fallen.
