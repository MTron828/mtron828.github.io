Chapter 775: The Third Move

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Upon hearing a torrent of scoldings, the experts from the three magnates looked embarrassed.

This was especially so for the three who gave the orders.

However, things have already turned out like that, they would not hesitate to carry out their plan.

In order to get the big secret, they were able to set aside their reputations.

Everything would give way to benefits.

Their face or dignity was nothing when compared to the absolute benefits.

Jian Wushuang was only handling the Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream. But now, all the experts from the three magnates were charging towards him.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang still wore an icy expression. Following which, he used his mind to cause a figure to appear by his side.

It was his Slaughter Body. The moment he showed up, he grew at an amazing speed into a 15-meter-tall Gold-armored Ancient God. He held a sword in his hand and a terrifying killing intent spread out.

“Doppelganger?”

“Doppelganger Secret Skill?”

“Humph, that’s not a big deal. Kill his doppelganger.” One of them spoke out.

They indeed just witnessed Jian Wushuang’s strength, so they were clear that they were unable to kill Jian Wushuang. However, they were confident of defeating the doppelganger.

While the Doppelganger Secret Skill was an eye-opener, there were some flaws in it.

Firstly, it was extremely difficult to cultivate. Only one or two from each magnate really cultivated it successfully.

Secondly, it was known that the doppelganger’s strength was far inferior to the Original Body. Sometimes, the difference could be huge.

For example, an Eternal Realm expert had practiced the Doppelganger Secret Skill and created a doppelganger, but this doppelganger’s strength might not even compare to a superior Divine Realm expert. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Therefore, they would think that doppelganger was not equipped with the Original Body’s battle strength.

The experts from the three magnates thought so.

However, they were wrong.

Very wrong.

This figure was not Jian Wushuang’s doppelganger, it was another of his Original Body.

Owing to the Heavenly Creation Skill, he had two Original Bodies who had their own consciousness and shared many trump cards that they could use.

For example, the two Original Bodies were able to change into Gold-armored Ancient Gods.

The two Original Bodies were roughly equal in strength. If they were to be compared in detail, the Slaughter Body and the World Body were only different in the possession of an Eternal Weapon like the Emperor Sword.

But even so, the Slaughter Body’s battle strength was still at Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

Seeing the experts rushing towards the Slaughter Body, Jian Wushuang threw them a frosty glance.

“You’re courting death!”

He radiated overwhelming killing intents as he brandished his 10-meter longsword.

Sword light was shining brightly, and he slashed the sword at his opponents.

The experts from the three magnates all made their different moves to resist his attack.

However…

Boom!

The sword light relentlessly flashed by and turned into a myriad of sword shadows which violently swept through them.

“What?”

“Damn it!”

“Run!”

Forlorn cries were heard. All of the Eternal Realm experts lost the ground and Jian Wushuang managed to kill four of them.

Following which, the Slaughter Body dived forward to continue its task.

Jian Wushuang was born militant, so he would not show any mercy to the experts from the three magnates.

The Slaughter Body held onto the sword in one hand. He launched all his battle strength from the fourth step and aided by the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, he slaughtered most of his opponents with ease.

In just a moment, half of them were gone. Only several experts escaped narrowly.

Calm was restored to the battlefield.

“How, how is this possible?” The spectators watched this in shock.

The had never expected that Jian Wushuang’s doppelganger was as powerful as his Original Body!

Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream were struck dumb.

“His doppelganger is so terrifying?”

“It, it shouldn’t be like this.”

The three supreme experts with the fourth step’s battle strength widened their eyes in disbelief.

At this point, Jian Wushuang’s World Body, who was standing in front of them, looked at the three with a cold gaze.

“Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream.”

Jian Wushuang began speaking with an easy heart, “Each of you is powerful and has high status in your sect. If all of you die here, it will be a great loss for your sects, right?”

Upon hearing this, the three supreme experts felt a tremor in their hearts, but they immediately snickered.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re over-confident. Kill us? Ridiculous!” Yun Fan sneered.

Saber Master also sighed, “I admit that you’re strong, but killing us with a strength like yours is simply just a dream.”

“What a conceited boy! I’ve lived for so many years, it’s been a long time since I met someone like you, so full of yourself!” Old Weirdo Dream said in a frosty voice.

“You’ll know soon, whether I am really just full of myself.” Jian Wushuang did not explain further, truth could speak for itself.

“Three of you, take my move!

“I’ve just mastered this move and haven’t displayed it. Today, let me test its power on you!”

After his exclamation, the whole area fell silent.

All of them fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

Everyone wanted to know how powerful this move that he just mastered was and why it made him so confident.

Yun Fan, Saber Master and Old Weirdo Dream also stared at him deadly.

At this point, Jian Wushuang raised his Emperor Sword slowly.

At that instant when he lifted it up, he radiated an overwhelming and destructive Sword Essence. It gathered at the sword blade.

Jian Wushuang paced his breathing. All the immense Spiritual Power and strength had completely gathered in his weapon.

The initially overwhelming aura had calmed down.

But it was the Emperor Sword in his hand that was unusual.

Everyone present clearly sensed his sword contained a terrifying power that was gathering there.

“Boundless Heaven Sword Art… the third move!”

Jian Wushuang spoke slowly, as his gaze became colder.
