Chapter 1778: Decision

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

War or retreat!!

Emperor God Tian Xiao’s voice reverberated in Clear Sky City and also in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

In Clear Sky City, countess cultivators fixed their gazes on Jian Wushuang.

Everyone was waiting for Jian Wushuang’s decision.

Before everyone’s gaze, Jian Wushuang’s face was gloomy. There was chilliness in his eyes as murderous intention soared from his body.

“Die!””Die!””Die!”

Jian Wushuang was dying to continue the massacre. He wanted to strike terror into Soaring Heaven King Palace’s heart and kill until no one dared to leave the lair anymore.

However, his rationality was telling him clearly that Great Emperor Colored Glaze would come forward personally and he would definitely be set against Great Emperor Colored Glaze if he were to continue the massacre.

With his power then, it was no doubt a hopeless battle if he were to fight with a Great Emperor. He didn’t even have the space to struggle, nor could anyone save him.

Even the Master of Star Palace might not stand a chance to stay alive in the hands of a Great Emperor, let alone Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, hold on. You must hold on!” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t act on impulse,” the Master of Star Palace who was hidden in the dark sent him a message too. “The dignity of a Great Emperor does not allow provocation.?Great Emperor Colored Glaze came forward personally to give an order. If you were to go against her, Great Emperor Colored Glaze definitely wouldn’t hesitate to kill you.”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold, but his tightly clenched hand slowly loosened before everyone’s attention.

The soaring murderous intention instantly dispersed into the air while his face grew calm as though nothing happened.

The cultivators at the scene were impressed by the sight.

“Jian Wushuang has such a strong mental state!”

“He was still raging with murderous intentions. He instantly reined them in and became calm. His emotional intelligence is almost perfect.”

“Jian Wushuang doesn’t seem to be carried away by resentment and rage.”

The cultivators were amazed.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang had already reined in his murderous intention and he naturally didn’t intend to continue the massacre.

In their viewpoint, it was the wisest choice.

Emperor God Tian Xiao’s smile stiffened and there was a glimpse of chilliness in his eyes. There was also a tinge of regret.

At first, he had wanted to provoked Jian Wushuang so that Jian Wushuang would pound at him under anger. Then, the Great Emperor Colored Glaze could kill him and remove the enemy of Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Jian Wushuang obviously wasn’t fooled by him.

“Humph, Jian Wushuang, I thought a top genius like you would never yield. But it seems like you are only so-so,” Emperor God Tian Xiao sneered.

“Tian Xiao, what’s there to be happy about?” Jian Wushuang spoke and his voice sounded cold.

“Huh?” Emperor God Tian Xiao looked at him.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace, the top force in Eternal Chaotic World was cornered into such a position by me, a Real God. I even killed four of your Sir Gods, many Real Gods and Universe Gods but you didn’t utter a word about it. In the end, you pleaded to Great Emperor Colored Glaze to come forward on your behalf. Even so, you are not embarrassed to be happy about this?” Jian Wushuang smirked, “If I were you, I would have found a hole to hide. I wouldn’t dare to come out and make a fool out of myself.”

“B*stard!” Emperor God Tian Xiao was angry.

“Why? Isn’t it true? If you Soaring Heaven King Palace didn’t plead for Great Emperor Colored Glaze to come forward, do you think you would have a chance to stand in front of me and speak to me? The experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace get to return alive,” Jian Wushuang teased.

Emperor God Tian Xiao was raging with anger but he suppressed his anger.

He knew that Jian Wushuang was provoking him. If he were to take action against Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang would instantly stand a chance to counterattack.

“Humph, I can’t be bothered to talk to you. In short, if you kill anyone from Soaring Heaven King Palace again, just you wait and bear Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s rage,” Emperor God Tian Xiao bellowed.

“Hehe, Emperor God Tian Xiao, I think you misunderstood Great Emperor Colored Glaze. She said that under the circumstance where Soaring Heaven King Palace doesn’t take the initiative to provoke me, I can’t kill the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace within Colored Glaze Sanctuary. In other words, out of Colored Glaze Sanctuary, Great Emperor Colored Glaze won’t care who I want to kill,” Jian Wushuang said coolly.

Emperor God Tian Xiao stunned.

Yes,?Great Emperor Colored Glaze did say so.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze only restricted Jian Wushuang within Colored Glaze Sanctuary. She prohibited him to continue the massacre in her territory, but if he were to head to other places, Great Emperor Colored Glaze couldn’t get involved.

“As long as Colored Glaze Sanctuary settles down, you can’t tell who will be the one killing when you run into experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace wandering outside,” Emperor God Tian Xiao said.

Emperor God Tian Xiao was confident. His brother Emperor God Tian Ling was in a crucial period. As long as he gave Emperor God Tian Ling some time, he would be able to reach the level of Underworld God. By then, when Emperor God Tian Ling returned, wouldn’t it be an easy task to kill Jian Wushuang?

“If so, I shall wait and see,” Jian Wushuang glanced at Emperor God Tian Xiao. Then, he turned and walked out of the city.

The cultivators in Clear Sky City saw that Jian Wushuang was leaving and they became quiet.

They knew that Jian Wushuang had no alternative. They could accept the outcome.

However, what they didn’t know was that Jian Wushuang’s face immediately turned gloomy the moment he turned around.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace and?Great Emperor Colored Glaze!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes glistened.

“Power. It comes down to the fact that I’m not powerful enough.”

“Experts of Great Emperor-level came forward personally and I couldn’t go against her instruction but could only obey. If I were to become more powerful, it would be needless for me to become a Great Emperor and I would only need to reach the level of Underworld God, then I’d be able to fight against a Great Emperor. I could even survive in the fight with a Great Emperor. By then, I can be fearless before Great Emperor Colored Glaze. Even if she wanted to stop me, I can just ignore her.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He possessed the fighting power of a Sir God and he was on the sixty-one place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. He was already on the peak of Eternal Chaotic World.

However, Jian Wushuang thought that he wasn’t powerful enough.

He still couldn’t fight with a Great Emperor.

When Great Emperor Colored Glaze gave an order, even though he harbored great resentment and felt aggrieved, he could only suppress it in his heart and leave.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace, I shall let you off the hook this time. However, it doesn’t mean our resentment has ended. Just you wait. In no time, I will attack again. By then, I will flip Soaring Heaven King Palace upside down and kill all experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace!”

“And?Great Emperor Colored Glaze, you are stronger than me today. I have no choice but to retreat when you ask me to, but it’s only a matter of time. I will crush you, a Great Emperor, under my foot!”

“This day definitely won’t be too far away!!!”
