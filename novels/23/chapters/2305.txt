2306 A Duel with Sword Skill

“Are you kidding?” Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin looked at each other in disbelief.

“Impossible!”

Another roar was heard. Lin Yan took two steps back before he attacked again.

This time, he used the strongest sword skill he had mastered.

The sword light traveled very quickly and mercilessly as it targeted Jian Wushuang.

The sword light seemed as though it was about to tear Jian Wushuang into two.

“Watch closely.”

Lin Tiefeng, Zhuo Yufeng, and the other adults used their soul powers to track Jian Wushuang’s movement.

When Lin Yan attacked, Jian Wushuang was ready.

He took a step forward. Before Lin Yan could land his blow, the branch hit Lin Yan’s wrist at lightning speed.

A loud slap could be heard as Lin Yan felt a stinging pain in his wrist. His attack crumbled instantly as he dropped his sword to the ground.

“You still want to continue the duel?” Jian Wushuang smiled at Lin Yan.

Lin Yan was completely taken aback.

“Wow, the little one can see the flaw in Lin Yan’s sword skills easily. Furthermore, he didn’t even use any sword skills. He only used the most simple sword moves and he still defeated Lin Yan easily.” A flash of excitement was seen in Lin Tiefeng’s eyes as he looked over at Lin Yi.

“Lin Yi, can you easily defeat Lin Yan using a branch, without the use of sword skills?”

Lin Yi was taken aback. He answered honestly, “If I can use sword skills, I will be able to defeat Lin Yan easily. If I don’t use sword skills, I can still defeat Lin Yan, but I won’t be able to do it as easily and smoothly as this little one did. Furthermore, there is no way I could detect a flaw in Lin Yan’s sword skills, make a decision and strike so accurately.”

“This also means that his understanding of the Sword Doctrine is deeper than yours?” Lin Tiefeng squinted his eyes and asked.

Lin Yi fell silent.

As much as he did not want to admit it, it did seem like Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Sword Doctrine surpassed his.

“Humph, and you said so confidently that this little one had no talent in the Sword Doctrine? His talent is not as terrifying as the people outside claim it to be? And you said you personally tested his talent in the Sword Doctrine?” Lin Tiefeng scolded.

“This...” Lin Yi knitted his eyebrows. He did not reply. Instead, he walked up to Jian Wushuang.

At that moment, the battle between Lin Yan and Jian Wushuang had stopped.

Lin Yan was not stupid. After losing to Jian Wushuang twice, he knew that Jian Wushuang’s sword skills were far superior to his.

He would not attack a third time. That would make him seem like a sore loser.

“Little one.” Lin Yi came up to Jian Wushuang and asked in a deep voice, “Four years ago when I tested your talent in the Sword Doctrine, did you take my test seriously? Or did you hide your true power?”

Lin Yi thought this was what had actually happened.

He felt that it would be unbelievable if Jian Wushuang had a greater understanding of the Sword Doctrine than him at this young age.

Jian Wushuang had to be insanely talented in the Sword Doctrine for that to be true. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But with this talent, how was it possible that Lin Yi did not see any essence when Jian Wushuang practiced the Sword Principle Bei Ming four years ago?

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head slowly and said, “No, I did the drill seriously.”

“Then why was there no essence in your drill? Is it because I made it too complicated and you could not understand initially?” Lin Yi asked curiously.

“I understood it and did the drill properly. It was you who did not understand my drill,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I did not understand you drill?” Lin Yi was stunned before he asked, “What do you mean?”

“Why don’t I show it to you? We shall have a duel with sword skills right here, right now? I will use the Sword Principle Bei Ming that I learned four years ago. As for Uncle Lin Yi, you can use whatever sword skills you like,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently and confidently.

“You want to have a duel with me?” Lin Yi raised his eyebrows before he turned back and looked at Lin Tiefeng.

Lin Tiefeng nodded his head in approval.

“Okay. Little one, are you going to use a branch in this duel with me?” Lin Yi looked at Jian Wushuang as he drew his sword.

“For me, anything can become a sword. The sword skills that I use when I hold a branch are not much weaker than when I use the same skill when I am holding an actual sword,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“What an arrogant one. I want to see if you can really beat me with your branch.” Lin Yi smiled.

“Attack me.” Jian Wushuang held his branch with one hand and placed the other behind his back. He stood there and waited calmly.

“I am starting.” Lin Yi dashed forward and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. He swung his sword in an eerie manner as it headed for Jian Wushuang’s throat.

It was so fast that the spectators could only see a blurred shadow of the sword.

“Husband.” Luo Xinqin looked worried. She knew this strike was powerful and she was afraid that Jian Wushuang would get injured.

“Don’t worry. Brother Lin Yi knows his limits. He has suppressed his divine power and is only using the power at the level of the Early Stage Transformed God. Jian Wushuang should be able to deflect this attack given his understanding of the Sword Doctrine,” Zhuo Yunfeng said, trying to calm his wife down.

Zhuo Yunfeng severely underestimated Jian Wushuang.

When Lin Yi attacked, Jian Wushuang moved as well.

He smiled lightly. A soft hum that came from a sword could be heard.

Jian Wushuang swung the branch he held in his hands. This swing was extremely ordinary and seemed as though it did not contain any essence at all.

From the sword momentum, it did seem like this sword skill was one of the styles from Sword Principle Bei Ming.

This ordinary swing collided with the sword light from Lin Yi almost instantly.

When the two blades struck each other, the long sword in Lin Yi’s hands turned slightly from the force from the branch.

“What?” Lin Yi was shocked.

Lin Tiefeng, Zhuo Yunfeng, and the others were in disbelief.

Even though Lin Yi had suppressed his own divine power to the level that Jian Wushuang was at, Lin Yi’s strike should have been more powerful given that he was using an actual blade and not a tree branch.

The results: Lin Yi was overpowered by Jian Wushuang.

The branch then went around the long sword before stopping on Lin Yi’s chest.
