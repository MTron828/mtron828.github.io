“Humph!”

Covered by a layer of Golden Spiritual Power and holding a saber like Satan, Yang Zaixuan fought with six talents from Cosmos Empire by himself at the same time.

Zhang Kong, who was 6th in the Rankings, was among the six geniuses.

However, while incessantly brandishing the saber, Yang Zaixuan’s moves became more domineering.

One person and one saber, fighting against six geniuses at the same time.

“What an amazing little guy! ”

“Easily fighting with six people?”

“That layer of the Golden Spiritual Power seems to be Heavenly Qi?”

“Yes. It’s Heavenly Qi from the High Heaven Technique, which is the highest level technique of the Cosmos Empire. Apparently, he concealed his strength because he didn’t want to display his cultivation method. It seems that he has an outstanding background.”

Many of the Monarchs and experts up in the air were secretly sighing, and they could not help glancing at the Monarch from the Cosmos Empire. The Monarch was a weathered elder, wearing an Emperor Robe.

At this time, the weathered elder looked down. When he saw the Golden Spiritual Power covering Yang Zaixuan, his face immediately became gloomy.

“It’s him. Yang Tian!”

“The traitor!”

The weathered elder clenched his hands as his eyes filled with killing intent.

The battlefield beneath them was a mess.

The sound of violent collisions could be heard as an incredible aura filled the air.

Although Yang Zaixuan’s strength increased enough to fight head-on with six of the warriors from the Cosmos Empire, they were fighting against two teams with a combined force of 14 people.

Even though Yang Zaixuan was holding back six people, there was still eight more that were not being restrained. One of those was Gu Yan, who could overpower Su Rou, Baili Chen, and the others.

“Damn it.”

Jian Wushuang noticed that Baili Chen, Feng Yutian, and Mu Yingying were retreating as they fought with the warriors from the Cosmos Empire. His expression became gloomy.

“It’s time to execute the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill...”

Jian Wushuang squinted.

The Soul-Devouring Secret Skill was his final trump card. He would not use it unless he was faced with an urgent situation.

After all, the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill placed a heavy burden on Jian Wushuang. Upon executing it, he would be weakened for several days. In a battlefield like Sky Valley, losing strength meant you would be eliminated or killed.

But in this situation...

Jian Wushuang decided to use the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill. But at this moment, a terrifying aura began radiating from among the crowd.

“What?”

Everyone immediately looked at the source of that terrifying aura.

“It’s her!”

“That woman!”

The geniuses from the Cosmos Empire looked at her in astonishment.

It was Su Rou!

At this moment, Su Rou’s sleeves and hair were fluttering as the terrifying aura continued to rise sharply and violently. In only a moment, it had reached an unbelievable level.

Subsequently, Su Rou’s eyes grew cold and she waved her hand. Vast aquamarine Spiritual Power surged out and formed a huge torrent.

The power of the torrent was amazing. It swept out and covered the entire space in only a moment.

The endless aquamarine power formed many sharp spikes and darted towards the geniuses from the Cosmos Empire.

“What is this?”

The geniuses from the Cosmos Empire were very surprised.

With their strength, it was not hard to defend against those spikes. However, there were so many spikes,?and they filled the area, thrusting toward them from everywhere in quick succession.

Everyone from the Cosmos Empire had to try their best to parry those spikes.

Which gave Jian Wushuang and the others a slight reprieve.

“Escape quickly!” Su Rou roared with a low and anxious voice.

“Fourth sister!” Jian Wushuang looked at Su Rou and left without hesitance. “Go!”

Immediately, Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, Baili Chen, Feng Yutian, and Mu Yingying left the battlefield and rushed into the dense forest.

Su Rou also managed to leave, following Jian Wushuang and the others.

The power of the aquamarine torrent didn’t slow in the least until Su Rou left, at which point those spikes also halted.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Everyone from the Cosmos Empire appeared on the treetops and watched the figures of Jian Wushuang and the rest disappear. Their faces stiffened.

“They’re escaping!” Gu Yan muffled his voice.

“It was beyond our expectations. Even though they are from a small empire, they are very strong. We knew it would be hard to fight with Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan, but we didn’t expect them to have such a terrifying woman,” said Zhang Kong as he squinted.

What Su Rou did had deeply shocked them.

Although Su Rou was only one person, she restrained all 14 of them.

“Hum, they only escaped temporarily,” Gu Yan groaned and said, “Xiao Xiao, how are things going over there?”

The black-robed woman frowned and said with a low voice, “That woman’s attack was terrifying. I had no choice but to focus on defending myself, and the Bloodarmor Bug was killed by a spike. I need two hours to hatch another one.”

“Only two hours? They can’t run far. We can just wait here for two hours,” Gu Yan said.

“OK.” Zhang Kong also nodded.

Now that they knew Yang Zaixuan was actually Yang Tian, these geniuses from the Cosmos Empire were specifically targetting the team from Tianzong Dynasty.

They would not give up until they killed Yang Zaixuan.

But at that moment…

“Hah, is everyone here?”

A light laughter suddenly sounded, and then a bloody-robed figure appeared on the treetop next to those talents from the Cosmos Empire.

It was a young man with a serious look, carrying a Blood Sword on his back, and wearing an evil smile. He looked at those talents from the Cosmos Empire with interest.

Seeing him, those talents from the Cosmos Empire all changed their expressions.

“Ling Xueyu!”

“Blood Sword!”

Ling Xueyu, acknowledged as the strongest genius in the Cosmos Empire, 2nd place in the Rankings!

Ling Xueyu and Meng Wutian, who ranked first, were publicly known as the two monsters in this Easternmost Hunt.

Even though he was also from the Cosmos Empire, Ling Xueyu was so strong that he could explore Sky Valley by himself.

Although he was one person, he had vanquished a team from a middle-sized empire!

Gu Yan and Zhang Kong’s expressions became unnatural when they saw Ling Xueyu.

They knew that Yang Zaixuan was an opportunity for them, but it would not belong to them if Ling Xueyu participated.
