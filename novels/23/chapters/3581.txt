Chapter 3582: Greed

The Life and Death Realm...

Both of them had just said that the Life and Death Realm was a place where death was inevitable. Even an expert at the level of a Ruler could not walk out of it alive. But now, someone had walked out of the Life and Death Realm right under their noses? How could they not be shocked?

Jian Wushuang, who had just walked out of the Life and Death Realm, had naturally discovered the existence of these two people.

“There are actually people here. Could it be that this is no longer an unexplored area?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

The unexplored area of Devil Smoke Valley was too dangerous and filled with too many unknowns. Therefore, very few cultivators entered it and the chances of encountering it were very slim. Now that Jian Wushuang saw the two people in front of him…he subconsciously wondered if he was still in the unknown region of Devil Smoke Valley.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang rushed toward the two people.

“You should be the Gray Python Master and the Death Slayer Master from the Jaderiver Star World, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two people in front of him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s us.” The gray-robed elder, the Gray Python Master, stared at Jian Wushuang. “Who are you?”

“Blood Sword of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Blood Sword Master?” Gray Python Master and Death Slayer Master both looked at Jian Wushuang carefully.

“Yes, he is indeed Blood Sword Master. However, didn’t he disappear after entering the unknown region? Even Star Palace announced his death?

“How did he come out of the Life and Death Realm?” Gray Python Master was surprised.

Jian Wushuang asked, “Where are we now?”

Jian Wushuang really did not know where he was. Even when he saw the huge black hole, he did not recognize it immediately.

“This is the deep part of Devil Smoke Valley, and the huge black hole behind you is the infamous Life and Death Realm,” the Death Slayer Master said.

“Life and Death Realm?” Jian Wushuang looked at the black hole behind him with a strange expression.

He was in the special space-time, but the special space-time was in the unknown region. He did not expect to come directly to the Life and Death Realm after walking out of the passage opened by Wind Demon, moreover, he came out of the Life and Death Realm.

“Is the Life and Death Realm connected to the special space? No wonder no one has come out of the Life and Death Realm in such a long time.” Jian Wushuang sighed to himself.

While he was sighing, the look on the faces of the Gray Python Master and the Death Slayer Master had begun to change.

“This Blood Sword Master has been missing for nearly 100,000 years. Everyone thought he was dead, but they didn’t expect him to be alive and well. Furthermore, he walked out of the Life and Death Realm. What exactly has he experienced during these 100,000 years?

“What is in the Life and Death Realm?” The Gray Python Master narrowed his eyes.

“Gray Python, what are you thinking about?” The Death Slayer Master looked over.

“What do you think?” The corner of Gray Python Master’s mouth curled up into a sneer. “Without a doubt, this Blood Sword Master must have had a very special encounter in the past 100,000 years. He might even have obtained a great opportunity. Not to mention other things, just the fact that he walked out of the Life and Death Realm is already very worthy of our consideration. And now, you and I are the first to discover that he is still alive and walked out of the Life and Death Realm. This is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us.”

“You’re right. I think so too. Moreover, before the Blood Sword Master went missing, he only had the battle strength of the initial stage of the sixth realm. Even if he had a great opportunity in the past 100,000 years and his strength increased a lot, with our strength, we should be able to take him down very easily if we work together.” The Death Slayer Master also nodded slightly.

“Since that’s the case, then it’s decided.” The Gray Python Master smiled.

The two of them conversed in secret and reached a consensus in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for informing me. Goodbye.”

After knowing where he was, Jian Wushuang turned around and intended to leave.

However, as soon as he moved, Gray Python Master and Death Slayer Master immediately surrounded him and sandwiched him between the left and right.

“What do you mean by this?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two people around him indifferently.

“Blood Sword Master, you disappeared for nearly 100,000 years. Everyone thought you were dead, but you’re still alive. If I’m not wrong, you must have had a very special encounter during these 100,000 years, right?” Gray Python Master stared at Jian Wushuang with a strange look.

“Yes, I have had some strange encounters.” Jian Wushuang did not deny it.

There was nothing to deny. He had disappeared in the unexplored area for nearly 100,000 years. Anyone could guess that he must have had some strange encounters.

“Can you tell us about your encounters?” The Gray Python Master asked.

“Just tell you about my encounters over the years?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two around him with a playful look. “Don’t you want me to hand over my interspatial ring and see if I’ve gotten any great opportunities over the years?”

“If that’s the case, it’ll be even better.” Gray Python Master smiled coldly.

He and Death Slayer Master did not try to hide it anymore. There was clearly a hint of greed in their eyes.

Upon seeing their expressions, Jian Wushuang could not help but sneer in his heart.

He knew their intentions. He had disappeared for nearly 100,000 years in the undiscovered region, but he had walked out of the Life and Death Realm, which meant that he must have had a great opportunity, it was likely that he had obtained a great opportunity, which was something that the Gray Python Master and the Death Slayer Master yearned for.

In addition, the Gray Python Master and the Death Slayer Master were both very strong, and their battle strength was close to or even comparable to the pinnacle of the six realm. Naturally, they thought that they would be able to defeat him if they joined forces.

“Gentlemen, I advise you to put aside your thoughts and let me go. Otherwise, you will regret it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Regret?” Gray Python Master smiled. “Blood Sword Master, you think too highly of yourself. With your strength, even if you’ve had a great encounter over the years, you won’t be able to do anything to us.”

“Since that’s the case, there’s nothing more to say. Since you want to know what happened to me over the years, you can attack me directly.” Jian Wushuang waved at Gray Python Master, there was a hint of contempt in his tone.

“Attack!”

Gray Python Master and Death Slayer Master did not hesitate. They exchanged glances and attacked at the same time.
