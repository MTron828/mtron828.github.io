Chapter 5116: Battle of Breakout (1)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the the boundless Great Desolate Wilderness, Yan power had long since vanished. When it erupted again, it caused the entire wasteland to tremble.

Those lost in the wasteland, the unconscious Yan Immortals, seemed to regain their former consciousness, only to shatter their own bodies in terror.

From the piles of skeletons in the valley, countless skeletons flew out to join the ranks of the great army. The being beneath the pile of skeletons also opened its eyes at this moment. His figure was not particularly large; instead, it was a small golden skeleton.

This skeleton was extremely well-preserved, even the blood-red imprint in the indentation on his forehead remained intact.

However, there were several scratches on his neck, and these marks were healing rapidly.

On the other hand, the battle between Jian Wushuang and the opposing forces turned the once silent wasteland into a hellish battleground.

The resurrected army of skeletons surrounded them, leaving no room to escape, but these were only a part of the skeleton army.

More skeletons rushed towards the source of the overwhelming pressure, but they dared not approach too close. They stopped their forms tens of thousands of feet away and then knelt down in worship.

Among these kneeling skeletons, there were seven gigantic armored giants, each holding a battle axe, sword, longsword, or banner.

Each of them possessed the strength of the previously mentioned armored figure, all at the level of Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals.

While their strength might be slightly inferior to the elders of the Heavenly

Court, they were undeniably genuine Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals.

Adding the one who was chasing Jian Wushuang and the others, there were a total of 8 Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals.

This was an incredibly terrifying force, especially when combined with the countless skeletons still awakening. It was uncertain if there were some formidable entities among them. With these skeletons united, along with their proclaimed ‘Lord’, they were likely capable of sweeping through the entire wasteland. Even the Great Si Region would be hard-pressed to suppress them, perhaps only the Heavenly Court could hold them back.

Moreover, their sworn enemies were the Heavenly Court. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jian Wushuang gazed into the distance towards the direction of the Great Si Region Heavenly Court. He wasn’t sure if the distant Great Si Heavenly Court had already detected the anomaly in this place, but all of that was no longer his concern.

The spears before them were something they had no confidence in blocking. Countless beings comparable to the Great Yan Immortals were relentlessly obstructing them from all sides, and their chances of escaping were slim to none.

The decapitated head of ancient warrior, a great cultivator of the past, now looked at the despairing crowd. His teeth shattered as he roared, “Zheng Wuyang’s lackeys, remember, remember my name. I will make you remember it for countless eons even in death.’ “Remember the name, Gu Yuan.”

Boom!

The brilliance of the Ancient Era made them seem like gods, second only to the Emperor in strength, the top cultivators revered by billions of cultivators.

However, Zheng Wuyang had reduced them to nothing but dry bones, scattered in the desolation of the Great Wilderness, trampled upon like wasteland.

With the accumulation of countless ages of resentment, Gu Yuan’s figure flickered, and he appeared beside the spears. He grasped a spear and shouted, “Break for me!”

A golden giant palm, like a strike from a deity, began to shatter upon contact.

The rugged Monk suddenly rushed out, standing in front of Jian Wushuang as the giant palm shattered. He faced the two of them, grinning.

“Kind Sir, don’t force it.

He left only these few words and, ignoring the backlash of his severe injuries, charged towards Gu Yuan, who was wielding the spear.

“Seal!”

At this moment, the rugged Monk’s Dharma transformation suddenly changed, and behind him, the Buddha Image Form transformed into a huge bell.

Several Monks who were still resisting the army of skeletons and were witnessing this were filled with sadness.

“Brothers, I’ll be leaving first.”

The bald-headed and white-bearded senior Monk closed his eyes, placed his palms together, and sadly said, “Senior Brother!”

He also unleashed his power, with 3,000 Buddhist beads surrounding him, grinding countless Yan Immortal skeletons to dust.

“I don’t have the strength the two of you. I’m barely even able to wield these 3,000 Buddhist beads. Hu Qing, please don’t blame me for being inferior in strength. ”

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The bell, Buddhist beads, Bodhi ancient trees, mustard seeds of the universe, and robes that filled the sky.

At this moment, all five senior Monks went all out. “Kind Sir, may I inquire about your name?”

“Surname Jian, given name Wushuang!”

Jian Wushuang released the young samanera Hu Qing, but he held onto his hand and bowed slightly to the five determined abbots.

“I am Jian Wushuang, a cultivator of the Great Si Region, and I respectfully bid farewell to the venerable Monks!”

“Haha, very virtuous!”

At this moment, the faces of the five Monks became unusually calm. The Great Daoo, which had been flowing for millions of years, poured forth at this moment. The besieged skeletons shattered one after another, turning into countless black mists, completely disappearing into the void of the Great Desolate Wilderness.

Gu Yuan stood above the void, his armor tattered, but the unstoppable pressure emanating from his entire body filled him with fighting spirit.

In the world, all enemies were nothing more than opponents for him.

This unparalleled fighting spirit was the result of years of accumulated grievances.

Perhaps he was no longer the top-notch cultivator he was during the glorious era of the past, and his cultivation had stagnated for billions of years. However, his genuine Nine Revolutions power still shook the void, like a war god. “A mere Three Revolution cultivator dares to challenge me. Are you seeking death?”

The moment the massive bell phantom descended, he suddenly made his move.

“Break for me!”

The plain gray spear split into tens of thousands of residual images and directly aimed at the bell. The originally unbeatable momentum began to shatter upon contact with the bell’s pressure.

“How is this possible?”

Even Jian Wushuang showed astonishment at this moment!

A Three Revolution cultivator suppressing a Nine Revolutions powerhouse!

If this news were to reach the Great Si Region, it would be enough to shock countless clans and sects.

Even the most top-tier Special Life Forms, those with naturally powerful physiques, might not be this strong!

Turning his head to look at the other Monks, they also erupted with power far beyond imagination, suppressing wave after wave of the skeletal army. In the endless space-time, in the distant Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm, under the ancient Bodhi tree, sat a majestic figure. His pair of Buddha eyes slowly opened.

Those two eyes contained countless illusions, and with just one glance, they swept over all sentient beings.

The Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm encompassed 3,000 great worlds, containing the Great Dao of all sentient beings, while billions of small worlds carried the remnants of ancient civilizations.

The entirety of the Buddhist Realm surpassed 3,000 great worlds.

Because he alone elevated the Buddhist Dao to the level of the Heavenly Dao.

So, within these 3,000 great worlds, there were worlds that rivaled or even surpassed the Great Si Region, yet they still regarded the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm as the supreme authority.

The majestic figures all saw this scene in the Great Desolate Wilderness!

“Virtuous!”

This figure sighed softly and then closed his eyes.

Across the vast void beyond thousands of worlds, another observer was also paying attention to the changes in the Great Desolate Wilderness. However, this observer did not care about the ants being besieged but was focused on the existence beneath the skeletons.

“Hehe, I’ve put in so much effort to bring you back to the Great Desolate Wilderness. I wonder how far you can walk on the path of the Emperor.”

This hidden figure in the endless darkness continued to conceal his presence, no longer paying attention to the disturbances in the Great Desolate

Wilderness..
