Chapter 42: Sword Essence of Gale

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After obsessively reading the contents of the Sword Essence chapter, word for word, from beginning to end, Jian Wushuang finally raised his head and breathed deeply, with a hint of shock in his eyes.

“How is it going?” Sima bu asked.

“Very good, especially the chapter on Sword Essence.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and said seriously,” when my father was teaching me swordsmanship, he mentioned Sword Essence. But I didn’t understand what Sword Essence really indicated until now. I finally know that Sword Essence is formed by comprehending the Essence of Heaven and Earth.

“Yes, in fact, it is a matter of understanding and using the natural power of Heaven and Earth. Watch this.”Sima bu said, then smiled and abruptly pulled out the sabre at his waist, immediately attacking a rock that was several meters away.

A sharp crack appeared on the rock and a large amount of rubble fell.

“I didn’t use the Essences of Heaven and Earth just now. but now, I will try again with the Essence of Heaven and Earth. Make sure you watch.” Immediately, Sima Bu split the rock again.

Jian Wushuang sensed a strong and fiery power this time when the rock was attacked.

“Was that the Essence of Heaven and Earth?” Jian Wushuang’s heartbeat quickened.

Peng!

The rock shattered and a large amount of rubble fell.

Jian Wushuang was astonished to see such a large difference.

The difference was humongous.

One attack only caused a crack in the rock while the other blew the entire rock into pieces.

“Is this the difference between a normal attack and an attack using the Essence of Heaven and Earth?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That’s right. The Essences of Heaven and Earth are the powers of nature, which can be guided by both Sword Warriors and Blade Warriors. However, I have only mastered superficial knowledge. Otherwise, the power would have been much stronger,” said Sima Bu.

“Actually, for Warriors, they would try to master Essences of Heaven and Earth after reaching the Gold Core Realm. Once he mastered a hint of Sword Essence or Blade Essence, his strength would explode.”

“Once, I met a super genius who was talented in swordsmanship, like you. At that time, he had just entered the Gold Core Realm, but he had deep comprehension in three different Sword Essences at the same time, which helped him to kill an expert Warrior at the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Everyone knows, the distance in power between each level only gets larger as their strength progresses.

The distance between the Initial Gold Core Realm and the Exceptional Gold Core Realm was so large that even a genius who possessed a Heaven defying Cultivation Method, like the Heavenly Creation Skill, still couldn’t compare with someone at the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

However, because that exceptional genius reached a high Level of understanding in Sword Essences, he was able to kill someone in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm with only one stroke.

Just a single stroke!

“Sword Essence is that terrifying?” Jian Wushuang asked in shock.

“Your Spiritual Power is still too low to progress to the Gold Core Realm, but after these few days, I noticed that you are very talented in swordsmanship. So, I decided to give you this book in the hope that you can learn Sword Essence earlier. It depends on whether you yourself can actually comprehend it,” Sima Bu said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

When he saw the chapter on Sword Essence, he knew there was a large difference someone who comprehended the Essences of Heaven and Earth and someone who did not. He was full of longing and expectation towards the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.

And that chapter also introduced the methods for comprehending the Essences of Heaven and Earth in great detail.

…

Even after this day, Jian Wushuang continued searching and battling with powerful spirit beasts at the Profound Transforming Sea Realm and Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm in the Dark Forest. But obviously, he spent more time studying Sword Essence than he had previously.

Inside an open canyon of the Dark Forest, Jian Wushuang stood alone with his eyes closed and his Long Sword held out. He had been holding this position for half an hour.

With the breeze whisking by his body repeatedly, he quietly attempted to feel the power of the wind in the surrounding the area.

“The wind … is invisible, but ubiquitous.”

Unexpectedly, the Long Sword in his hand began to sweep slowly upwards.

Very slowly, very lightly, each move followed the strength of the wind that flowed in the surrounding area.

With a trace of a smile on his face, Jian Wushuang very clearly sensed the power of the surrounding wind, as well as the lightness of the wind… Gradually, a trace of enlightenment grew in his heart as the speed of his sword increased.

At this time, Sima bu was sitting arbitrarily on a rock near the open space. Occasionally, Jian Wushuang would glance in his direction.

“This kid has begun to ponder Sword Essence, but is it so easy to comprehend?” Sima Mabu shook his head and could not help laughing in the heart.

One must know that to comprehend the Blade Essence of Raging Fire, he had ventured alone to a desolate and huge volcano. He lived there for a full three years, day and night, feeling the turbulent flames. Finally, he grasped a trace of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire, which was considered very lucky compared to the unfortunate experts in the Gold Core Realm who worked hard their whole life without ever being able to feel a trace of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.

Even though Jian Wushuang was born with talent in Sword Principle, it would still take a long time for him to comprehend Sword Essence.

But, at this moment …

“Hmmm? How is that possible?” Sima Bu looked up unexpectedly, feeling completely astonished by what he was seeing.

Jian Wushuang was still practicing his swordsmanship at this moment, but the speed of his sword gradually became surprisingly fast, so much that even Sima Bu could only see the flickering sword light.

“He is drawing his sword so quickly… And he is doing it freestyle, without using Sword Arts, ah?” Sima Bu was shocked.

He did not use Sword Arts to enhance the speed, like the Aurora Sword Art or Flowing Light Sword Art. He was just practicing freestyle, but it was still so fast. What does it mean?

“The sword flows with the wind, the wind becomes the sword!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The Sword Principle of Gale! He comprehended it!” Sima Bu was dumbstruck immediately.

Note that it was only yesterday when he gave the book to Jian Wushuang. Also, he only learned of the existence of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth yesterday…

Today he comprehended the Sword Principle of Gale from the Essences of Heaven and Earth.

“What speed is that?”
