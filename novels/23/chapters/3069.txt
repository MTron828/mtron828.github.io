Chapter 3070: Dao Palace’s Invitation

——

“Clang!”

There was a crisp sound.

Jian Wushuang felt that his Blood Mountain Sword was hit by an extremely terrifying force. In an instant, the Blood Mountain Sword changed its direction and almost fell out of Jian Wushuang’s hand, Jian Wushuang followed the Blood Mountain Sword and retreated to the side.

“So powerful,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Are there any other sword skills? Show them all,” Iceberg said coldly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned slightly.

Of course, he had other sword skills. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Wushuang Sword Manual was a complete sword skill. There were seven sword skills, and the moment of life and death was only one of them.

However, in front of so many people, Jian Wushuang did not want to show all the other sword skills in the Wushuang Sword Manual.

After all, if he displayed all the other six sword techniques, it would be obvious that he had created a complete sword technique. Moreover, all the sword techniques were embryonic forms of the sword technique, which would cause a great commotion.

Therefore, even though the opportunity to fight with an Invincible Immortal Saint was right in front of him, Jian Wushuang still did not intend to continue.

“My lord, this is the sword skill that I used to defeat Bai Xiao. Other than this sword skill, none of the other sword skills are good enough,” Jian Wushuang said straightforwardly.

“Just this sword skill?” Iceberg frowned, obviously a little disappointed.

The sword skill that Jian Wushuang just displayed proved that Jian Wushuang was a sword principle genius, but that was all.

After all, they came from the Dao Palace.

The Dao Palace, like the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, was filled with all kinds of monsters and evildoers.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis’ sword just now has reached the level of a fourth-level absolute art. His swordsmanship has brought his speed and his comprehension of the space-time principles to the extreme. It is indeed very rare for a first-level True Saint, and his basic sword principle is very solid. However, among the geniuses and evildoers in the Dao Palace, he is only at the middle level,” Iceberg thought to himself.

There were countless monsters in the Dao Palace.

Among these monsters, there were actually quite a few who had created rank four ultimate arts at the rank one True Saint Realm. This was not too surprising.

After all, the monsters in the Dao Palace were all able to challenge those of a higher level. Some were even able to directly challenge those of two levels higher. The reason why their battle prowess was so outstanding was not just because they knew some special secret arts that could increase the power of their divine power, most importantly, their comprehension of the principles and Dao was very high.

Take Mountain King, Evil Master, and Mirage Water whom Jian Wushuang had met in the white bone region for example.

These three were only rank one True Saints, but any one of them could easily suppress a rank three True Saint. They could even kill a rank three True Saint with some special means and treasures. Their battle strength was so great, their comprehension of principles and Dao was very good. Mountain King and Evil Master had also created rank four absolute arts.

The reason why Jian Wushuang could easily defeat the three of them was that his peerless sword manual was very good, and his divine power was much stronger than the three of them. However, if it was just the comprehension of principles and Dao…Mountain King and the other two were actually not inferior to Jian Wushuang.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

Iceberg spoke again, “You do have some talent in sword principle. If you are well-groomed, you will have great achievements in the future. The Dao Palace of the Divine ancestor Daoist Sect is to recruit many top geniuses and monsters in the Divine Beginning World. Are you interested in following me to the Dao Palace?”

Iceberg was very direct and did not beat around the bush.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang felt even weirder.

He had guessed that the experts of the Dao Palace had come to recruit him. He had only used the sword skill of life and death for a moment because he thought it was too troublesome. He did not expect Iceberg to still want him to go to the Dao Palace.

Jian Wushuang began to ponder.

When the elders and disciples of the Young Divine Sect heard Iceberg’s words, they immediately became restless. All they saw were fiery gazes looking at Jian Wushuang, these gazes were more or less filled with envy and jealousy.

The Dao Palace was a place specially used by the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect to nurture disciples of top geniuses. It was a place that countless geniuses in the Divine Beginning World yearned to go.

As one of the twelve divine sects, the Young Divine Sect had existed in the first heaven for so many years. In history, there were only two people who had joined the Dao Palace. Even including Bai Xiao, there were only three people.

Hearing that Iceberg had invited Jian Wushuang to join the Dao Palace, the experts, and disciples of the Young Divine Sect were naturally envious.

However, although they were envious, Jian Wushuang did not want to agree at all. He was already thinking about how to refuse.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, master has invited you personally. Why don’t you agree?” Bai Xiao looked over.

“Brother Sword Heavenly,” Jiu Luo said.

It was a rare opportunity for them to join the Dao Palace. who would be so stupid as to refuse?

“I…” Jian Wushuang was about to speak.

Suddenly…buzz!

A magnificent aura swept over.

This aura clearly came from outside the Young Divine Sect. However, even though there was a layer of heaven and earth secret realm between them, that aura had already spread to the interior of the Young Divine Sect.

When they sensed this unique aura, the expressions of the many experts present, including Bai Jue, who had been standing there without speaking, changed slightly.

“This aura is the Principles Master!” Sect Master Si Lan cried out immediately, “Another Principles Master has arrived!”

The experts and disciples of the Young Divine Sect all revealed shocked expressions.

Just a moment ago, the Principles Master, Bai Jue, had personally arrived. However, Bai Jue was a member of the Dao Palace. The reason for his arrival was very obvious. They had also received the news a long time ago.

And who was this Principles Master who had suddenly descended? And why had he descended?

Although he did not know the intentions of the person who had come, Sect Master Si Lan did not dare to bring a Principles Master with him when he personally came. He immediately rose up and his mighty voice was already transmitted out… “May I know which Lord has descended into our Young Divine Sect?”

“I am Mo Shan, from…the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!” A mighty voice was transmitted from outside the Young Divine Sect.

“The Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” Sect Master Si Lan was shocked.

“Mo Shan?” Bai Jue frowned.

“Senior Mo Shan?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He knew Mo Shan. The one who had been invited by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to join the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces was Mo Shan, who had reached the level of Principles Master.

When Mo Shan had met him, he had specially given him some pointers. For example, Jian Wushuang had obtained the ‘gold-splitting secret manual’ under Mo Shan’s guidance.

And the embryonic form of this swordsmanship was only created after Mo Shan gave him some advice.
