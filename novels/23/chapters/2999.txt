Chapter 3000: Holy Master Huocang

——

“Poison, it’s the god-burning poison, no!”

“Damn it, it’s 300,000 drops of god-burning poison, I’m doomed!”

“Spare my life, spare my life!”

The slaughter continued!

There were 12 True Saint experts on the must-kill list. These 12 True Saint experts were scattered in different corners of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom and did not gather together. Therefore, it was easier for Jian Wushuang to kill them.

He just needed to spend some time to find them one by one.

Originally, with Jian Wushuang’s strength, although he could crush those first rank True Saints, it would be very difficult to kill them directly.

However, because of the existence of the god-burning poison, it was much easier for him to kill those first rank True Saints.

The god-burning poison was known as the nightmare of cultivators below the fourth rank True Saint. It was not undeserved.

With the help of the god-burning poison, Jian Wushuang had traveled to every corner of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom in less than two months and killed six True Saints on the list.

Of course, the six True Saints killed were only rank one True Saints, the strongest of which was at the peak of rank one.

…

Boom!

Flames kept spewing out of the sky.

They were in the middle of a huge group of volcanoes.

This group of volcanoes was covered in Scarlet Earth. There were no living beings or living things around.

Whoosh! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A figure appeared in the void above the group of volcanoes. Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, was looking down with cold eyes.

“This should be the earth flame mountain range. There are 12 True Saint experts on the kill list. Among them, Holy Master Huocang, who is extremely strong and has reached the second rank True Saint realm, should be hiding here,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

In the mission information provided by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, not only were the 12 True Saint experts detailed, but their current location was also included.

Holy Master Huocang had been staying in this group of volcanoes all year round. It was said that he had not left for more than tens of thousands of years.

“Haha, he has been in seclusion for tens of thousands of years. He has worked hard and is very patient. However, tens of thousands of years ago, in order to refine his natal magic weapon, Holy Master Huocang burned one-tenth of the cultivators in a realm into ashes. It’s a heinous crime and unforgivable!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

A realm, like the Pill Sun Sacred World, which he was born in, was already very vast. How many cultivators did it have?

One-tenth of the cultivators in a realm was also an astronomical figure.

To burn so many cultivators in one go just to refine a natal weapon for himself, was so cruel and terrifying!

“Holy Master Huocang, get out here!”

Jian Wushuang let out a fierce shout that reverberated throughout the entire earth flame mountain range and did not disappear for a long time.

At the bottom of the earth flame mountain range, a burly figure sitting cross-legged in the endless flames suddenly opened his eyes and rushed up.

Boom!

Like a volcano erupting, the entire world suddenly shook.

The burly figure had already rushed out of the ground, arrived in the void, and arrived in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Is he Holy Master Huocang?” Jian Wushuang stared at the person in front of him with an extremely cold expression.

Holy Master Huocang was as burly as a small mountain. He wore scarlet armor and a scarlet helmet on his head. His body was surrounded by raging flames. He looked like a giant fire beast.

“You dare to disturb my cultivation. You will die. If you have any last words, just say them.” Holy Master Huocang’s voice was cold and emotionless.

“Last words? My last words are, you can die first.” Jian Wushuang moved directly.

He used the seven-star secret skill, punishment divine realm expert, and nine luminaries star armor at the same time.

His battle strength reached its peak in an instant.

Whoosh!

His body flashed and his terrifying speed burst out. In an instant, he appeared in front of Holy Master Huocang. At the same time, he held the Blood Mountain Sword in his right hand and slashed out with his sword.

Holy Master Huocang’s pupils constricted. A red long stick appeared in his hand. He held the long stick in one hand and sent it forward in a spiral. It created a huge fire whirlpool and directly rushed toward Jian Wushuang’s sword light.

The sword light immediately struck the long red staff.

Bang!

A low sound of collision rang out as Jian Wushuang took a few steps back.

“Your speed is not bad, but your strength is a little weak.”

Holy Master Huocang glanced at Jian Wushuang and endless flames suddenly burst out from his body. At the same time, he held the long red staff in his hands.

“Starfire penetrates the nine heavens!”

Boom!

The entire sky was suddenly dyed red. The sky was filled with flames, which came from the void and covered the entire world.

The scarlet long staff in Holy Master Huocang’s hands also contained astonishing divine power. As the divine power soared, the scarlet long staff suddenly grew in size.

Boom! Boom!

A huge scarlet long staff with astonishing power hurled toward Jian Wushuang.

“This guy.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

The moment he saw Holy Master Huocang attack, Jian Wushuang could tell that Holy Master Huocang was much stronger than the intelligence report said.

According to the intelligence report of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, Holy Master Huocang was only an ordinary rank two True Saint. Although his battle strength was not at the bottom among rank two True Saints, he was definitely not strong.

However, in this fight, the strength displayed by Holy Master Huocang was definitely not something an ordinary rank two True Saint could have.

Although he was not at the peak of rank two, he was very close.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang raised his right hand, and the 18 Star Luo Swords formed a sword formation at the fastest speed. A streak of green light shot out, dragging out.

The streak of green light also contained astonishing power, and in the blink of an eye, it collided with the scarlet staff shadow that was crushing down from above.

With a deafening sound, the streak of green light trembled slightly and shot out directly, but the power of the scarlet staff shadow above was barely blocked.

“Wow, in terms of offensive power, the staff skill Holy Master Huocang used is even stronger than my fifth reincarnation sword formation, saint beheading.” Jian Wushuang sighed secretly, but he was not worried at all.

It was true that Holy Lord Huocang was very strong.

120 years ago, he would have been helpless against Holy Master Huocang if he had not obtained the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual. Even if he had tried his best, he would have only been able to fight against Holy Master Huocang head-on.

It was impossible to kill him.

But it was different now.

“After 120 years of closed-door meditation, my strength is no longer the same as before. I’ll use you to test my progress over the past 120 years.” Jian Wushuang curled the corners of his mouth, but in the next moment, he rushed out again.

…
