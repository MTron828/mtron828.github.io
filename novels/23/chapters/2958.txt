Chapter 2959: Maturity

——

“Did he escape?”

Seeing the Star Sea Saint completely disappear from his sight, a strange smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face.

Buzz! The heaven and earth shook, and the pressure gathered at the top at a terrifying speed instantly disappeared.

“Brother Heavenly Sword Marquis, what are you…” Xue Dong King looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“I’m just bluffing.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Bluffing?” Xue Dong King was stunned, but he immediately understood.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang was bluffing.

He was very powerful and had many trump cards. However, unless he used the life-level pressure, he had no means to completely kill a True Saint at the peak of rank one.

As for the more powerful power that rose from the Scroll World in the sky, it was indeed the second seal of the strongest three seals of the nine-region seal. However, he could not completely use this seal.

He was just putting on an act and using some starting moves to condense such powerful power. However, because of the power of the first move and the many heaven-defying moves that Jian Wushuang had shown, Star Sea Saint believed that he could really use the second seal.

Therefore, the Star Sea Saint fled.

He fled in fear.

“Star Sea Saint is indeed powerful. I can only fight him head-on with all my trump cards. It’s impossible for me to kill him. It’s already good enough that I can scare him and scare him away. If nothing goes wrong, he won’t dare to come for the Divine Earth Fruit again out of fear of me,” Jian Wushuang said.

It would not take long for the Divine Earth Fruit to ripen.

Before it ripens, Star Sea Saint would not be able to ask other powerful True Saints to help him.

He was completely stunned by Jian Wushuang and was afraid that he would not dare to come again.

Therefore, the Divine Earth Fruit had naturally become his and Xue Dong King’s possession.

“Let’s wait here. In a few days, the Divine Earth Fruit will be fully ripe,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.” Xue Dong King nodded heavily, but he gave Jian Wushuang a strange look. “Brother Heavenly Sword Marquis, your strength is really terrifying.”

Xue Dong King was extremely shocked.

He had witnessed the battle between Jian Wushuang and the Star Sea Saint from the beginning to the end.

He had thought that Jian Wushuang’s battle strength should be comparable to his. They had fought equally before, but who would have thought that Jian Wushuang would be so heaven-defying.

A Divine Master had scared the Star Sea Saint, who had reached the peak of rank one True Saint, into fleeing in panic.

It was incredible.

“Let’s go down.”

Jian Wushuang did not explain much and returned to the palace with Xue Dong King.

…

In the bamboo forest on the floating continent in the center of the Star Sea.

“Since the Saint Master has gone to the dark shout realm, it should be easy for him to get the Divine Earth Fruit. He will be overjoyed and will reward you handsomely. But what will he reward you with?”

The graceful woman who had come to inform the Star Sea Saint was waiting there, but her heart was filled with anticipation.

The Star Sea Saint was publicly acknowledged as the number one expert in this territory, and he had the most resources in his hands. The things he bestowed, even the Immortal Saint would be extremely moved.

Right at this moment… Xiu!

A stream of light shot over from the distance, and in the blink of an eye, it had appeared in front of the graceful woman.

“Saint Master.”

The graceful woman immediately bowed, but when she saw the appearance of the Star Sea Saint, the smile on her face could not help but stiffen.

At this moment, the Star Sea Saint was not only in a sorry state, but his face was also extremely gloomy. The aura on his body was also extremely gloomy and cold. He did not look like he had any good news at all.

“Saint Master, that Divine Earth Fruit…” The graceful woman had just opened her mouth.

“Get lost! Don’t bring me the Divine Earth Fruit again!” The Star Sea Saint shouted angrily.

“Yes, yes!” The graceful woman nodded in fear and immediately turned around to leave.

The moment she turned around, a trace of coldness flashed in the graceful woman’s eyes, but more than that, she was shocked.

She knew that since the Star Sea Saint was so angry, it was obvious that he did not get the Divine Earth Fruit.

But as far as she knew, the people who occupied the Earth God Kingdom were only Xue Dong King and a Supreme Divine Master. How could the Star Sea Saint not get the Divine Earth Fruit from them?

“Since the Saint Master didn’t get the Divine Earth Fruit, I didn’t get the reward. This trip was in vain, and I got myself into trouble.” The graceful woman’s face was cold, and she soon left the bamboo forest.

The Star Sea Saint returned to the bamboo house. When he sat down cross-legged on the bamboo bed, his face looked better.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“You’re unknown. Before this battle, I didn’t know that you existed, and I didn’t know that you had incredible talent!”

“You’re just a Divine Master, but you can’t do anything to me. You even made me feel like my life was in danger when you used your last killing move. You’re very powerful!”

“It’s not unfair that I lost to you in this battle. Moreover, I believe that with your power, you will grow to a higher level before long. You might even become famous in the Absolute Beginning Divine Realm.”

“Although the Divine Earth Fruit fell into your hands, I still admire you!”

The Star Sea Saint’s eyes sparkled. He slowly closed his eyes, and the anger in his body gradually subsided.

He was an ascetic, and his strength had come from his hard work and cultivation over the years.

A treasure like the Divine Earth Fruit was indeed very useful to him, and he was eager to get it. But if he could not get it, he would not force it. At most, it would be a pity.

…

Time slowly passed.

Soon, a month had passed.

In the palace, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King were still eating and drinking. Suddenly…

Buzz!

A strange aura directly erupted from the deepest part of the underground.

At the same time, a large amount of hazy earthen yellow power formed a halo and swept out in all directions.

It was not a big movement, but it was quite strange.

“Has it finally matured?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King immediately stood up with surprise in their eyes.

They soon came to the depths of the underground, came to the muddy pool, and saw the Divine Earth Fruit again.

The Divine Earth Fruit had clearly completed its final transformation. The earthy yellow halo around its body was very thick, and the fragrance it emitted was even more tempting.
