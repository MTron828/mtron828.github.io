Chapter 3001: Night Vision, Star Dream!

——

Swish!

A silver light suddenly flashed in the scorching void.

Holy Master Huocang’s pupils constricted. The next moment, he saw the void in front of him. Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! ~ ~ ~

A strange silver light burst out in an instant. The dense silver light flickered crazily. Even a second-rank True Saint like him could not completely capture Jian Wushuang’s figure.

“Movement technique, what a terrifying movement technique!” Holy Master Huocang’s face sank.

Movement technique… Yes, it was a movement technique.

After 120 years of meditation, Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the space-time rule had improved a lot with the help of the dissection of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual.

On the way to meditation, Jian Wushuang also gained a great harvest. He created a movement technique himself.

This movement skill was called ‘Silver Light’.

Like a silver ghost, Jian Wushuang’s figure shuttled through the void.

Silently, he appeared beside Holy Master Huocang and slashed out with his Blood Mountain Sword.

A sword light suddenly lit up.

This sword light was also silent, but the moment it lit up…roar. Vaguely, a fierce beast’s roar echoed in the world.

It was a sword light, but in the blink of an eye, it turned into a huge and ferocious beast’s head.

Jian Wushuang’s self-created sword skill… Xi Xiang!

This sword move was powerful!

In terms of level, it had already reached the level of a rank two absolute art, and it was relatively strong among rank two absolute arts.

Holy Master Huocang seemed to have sensed that the power of this sword was not to be underestimated. At the first moment, he mustered all of his divine power. The scarlet long rod in his hand instantly turned into a huge volcano. This volcano contained terrifying power…the moment it came into direct contact with the sword light, it suddenly erupted.

Bang!

A shockingly loud sound rang out, and boundless divine power swept out in all directions. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A hint of shock suddenly flashed in Holy Master Huocang’s eyes. He staggered and fell down. It was obvious that he had been struck by the sword light.

“The power of the sword skill has increased so much?” Holy Master Huocang was a little surprised.

When Jian Wushuang fought with him just now, his sword skills were ordinary and not very powerful. Obviously, they were not as powerful as his.

Even if he used the sword formation, it was still the same.

But now, Jian Wushuang was using his swordsmanship again. Did his swordsmanship actually suppress his power?

“It’s a second-level absolute art, and it’s a second-level absolute art that focuses on strength.” Holy Master Huocang’s pupils constricted slightly. He finally felt the enormous pressure from Jian Wushuang’s body.

And this pressure suddenly soared as Jian Wushuang’s body swayed again.

In the void, the silver light kept flashing and changing at an incredible speed.

“Too fast, too strange!”

“His speed is already very fast, much faster than mine. With this movement skill…I can’t catch his figure at all.”

“With this speed and movement skill, he can completely crush me. I’m a living target in front of him.”

Many thoughts rose in Holy Master Huocang’s mind at once.

Buzz!

Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared on the ground. As soon as he appeared, sword light swept over. It was the move of ‘Xi Xiang’ again.

Holy Master Huocang gritted his teeth and could only passively resist.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Jian Wushuang’s speed and movement technique were fully unleashed. With his own sword technique, he surrounded Holy Master Huocang and attacked again and again.

Every time he attacked, he used the move ‘Xi Xiang’.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

A series of low collision sounds could be heard. Holy Master Huocang had no ability to fight back at all. He could only passively defend himself. Although he was a little embarrassed, his divine body did not suffer any damage.

“It’s useless. I admit that your speed is far faster than mine and your swordsmanship is more powerful than mine. With your movement techniques, you can completely crush me or even play with me. I don’t have the ability to fight back, but you can’t kill me at all!”

“It’s just a waste of time to keep fighting,” Holy Master Huocang shouted in a low voice.

He no longer had the will to fight, so he hoped that Jian Wushuang would stop as well.

“A waste of time? I don’t think it’s a waste of time.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, however, a strange smile appeared on his face. “It’s true that Xi Xiang alone can’t kill you. In that case, you can try my star dream again.”

“Star dream?” Holy Master Huocang was stunned.

But Jian Wushuang had already attacked like lightning.

The silver light flashed again, and Jian Wushuang still appeared silently beside Holy Master Huocang.

Holy Master Huocang had already noticed the moment he appeared.

“It’s useless.” Holy Master Huocang’s voice was cold, and his body was surrounded by raging flames. He wanted to swing his long rod to block Jian Wushuang’s next attack.

But suddenly, he saw Jian Wushuang’s sword.

It was a cold and beautiful sword shadow that felt like a dream.

The sword light was calm and indifferent. It swung out from Jian Wushuang’s hand and went straight for his neck.

But when he saw the sword, Holy Master Huocang’s eyes were wide open.

It was too fast!

The sword was too fast.

It was unbelievably fast. It was far faster than he had imagined.

He had reacted at the first moment and even attacked before Jian Wushuang did, waving the scarlet long staff in his hand. However, he found that he was still far from being able to keep up with the speed of the sword move.

The beautiful and dreamy ice-cold sword shadow…he could not withstand it at all.

Clang!

The ice-cold sword shadow directly cut into Holy Master Huocang’s protective armor.

His protective armor was also of a very high level, so it immediately blocked a large amount of power for him. However, at this moment, the sword shadow’s blade suddenly slashed.

This slash…his protective armor was actually torn open on the spot.

The ice-cold blade followed the opening and directly entered his divine body.

“How is this possible?” Holy Master Huocang was shocked. He could not believe it.

What he did not know was that the most terrifying thing about Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword was its sharpness. It was already a second-grade holy treasure. Once it was cut, even a second-grade holy treasure armor of the same level would not be able to withstand it, moreover, the star dream move that Jian Wushuang was using was also a move that could cut through.

His protective armor was useless in front of the Blood Mountain Sword and star dream sword techniques.

The cold sword shadow directly passed through Holy Master Huocang’s divine body. His divine body immediately collapsed, and the god-burning poison on the sword tip immediately attacked Holy Master Huocang’s divine power.

“No, no!”

Holy Master Huocang let out a shrill cry, but his divine body did not regenerate.
