Chapter 1625: Challenge To The End!

“Boom!”

The twenty-meter-tall Gold-armored Ancient God attacked straight away.

A great amount of golden Ancient God Power gathered in his index finger instantly. After that, his index finger, which was filled with thick Ancient God Power, was pointed out abruptly.

Rumble~~~ The void collapsed and an ancient, giant golden finger appeared out of thin air.

For the Star Moon Tower, the guards at the higher levels would be even more powerful.

Moreover, it was not just in the aspect of abilities. It also included close-quarters combat techniques and Unique Skills…

For example, for the first four levels, the Ancient Gods guarding the level only displayed the abilities they were supposed to display and they did not use Ancient God Unique Skills. However, from the fifth level onward, the guards would use Unique Skills. As such, at that very moment, the golden Ancient God used the Ancient God’s Finger.

“Ancient God’s Fourth Finger?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrow, “What a coincidence. I know this move as well.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As soon as the words left his mouth, a tremendous amount of Ancient God Power appeared from Jian Wushuang’s hands and gathered at his right index finger crazily.

As Jian Wushuang pointed out his finger, a similar giant finger appeared on the universe.

Both giant fingers looked as if they had appeared from the past and they possessed a frightening power, which was earth-shaking.

At the next moment, both giant fingers clashed.

Bam!

With a loud sound, the shocking Ancient God Power shattered the void completely into pieces.

The two Ancient God Powers were opposing each other madly.

They were both the God’s Test of the Ancient God’s Fourth Finger. The only difference was that one of the fingers was unleashed by a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God, while the other one was unleashed by Jian Wushuang, a Five-star Ancient God.

Of course, although Jian Wushuang was only a Five-star Ancient God, he did not possess only the Ancient God Power; he possessed Divine Power as well. As an Inverse Cultivator, by combining both Divine Power and Ancient God Power, the Ancient God’s Fourth Finger that he unleashed with his full power would have shocking power as well.

In the end, both their attacks dissipated completely while opposing each other.

“How can this be?” the Gold-armored Ancient God was astonished, “Gu Jian has awakened the Royal Ancient God Bloodline and he would definitely have some memories of inheritance. Thus, it would be normal for him to be able to use the Ancient God’s Fourth Finger. However, he is merely a Five-star Ancient God. How can the power of his Ancient God’s Fourth Finger be the same as mine?”

Just as the Gold-armored Ancient God was surprised.

A ghost-like body had already appeared in front of him and a sword light struck.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

For the sword shadows, every one of them contained the Power of Spacetime. Thus, they were extremely fast and they headed toward the Gold-armored Ancient God.

The Gold-armored Ancient God acted straight away to block the attack.

However, as soon as the both of them fought, the Gold-armored Ancient God understood immediately that he could not stop Jian Wushuang.

“Damn it! The Sword Principles of this little kid is too fast and delicate. Moreover, my Ancient God shadow is under many restrictions in the Star Moon Tower. Thus, I am unable to unleash some of my Unique Skills and Secret Skills. With that, I am unable to stop him and I will probably be defeated.”

The Gold-armored Ancient God could not do anything either.

At the fifth level of the Star Moon Tower, he could indeed use Ancient God Unique Skills. He could use the Ancient God Finger move, but not other Unique Skills or the Secret Skills. Moreover, his power was unable to suppress Jian Wushuang completely. Therefore, it was normal for him to be unable to stop Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principles.

In no time, the Gold-armored Ancient God was defeated completely.

Fifth level, cleared!

As Jian Wushuang saw the body of the Gold-armored Ancient God in front of him dissipating slowly, his eyes glowed brilliantly.

“I have cleared the fifth level of the Star Moon Tower. In other words, after I get out now, I will be able to obtain the Four Unique Skills within the Ancient God Palace, as well as one of the Secret Skills of the Three Secret Skills!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

“That’s right,” the King of Venomous Worms nodded his head, “For you to be able to reach this stage, it’s already considered not too bad. As for the sixth level… if I’m not wrong, the fighting capabilities of the guard on the sixth level are of a top Stage Two Six-star Ancient God, which is equivalent to that of an Eternal Real God standing at the peak. With your current abilities, you can try to challenge the sixth level. However, there will be a considerable amount of risk. After all, if you are unable to clear it, the only fate awaiting you is death.”

After hearing what had been said, Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. However, he raised his head up in the blink of an eye.

“My current abilities are enough to fight against a top Eternal Real God and the probability of me clearing the sixth level is not low either. Since I have already cleared the fifth level, I shall continue challenging the next few levels to the best of my abilities!” Jian Wushuang laughed nonchalantly, “It would be great if I could clear the sixth level successfully. If there’s really no chance, I still have the Secret Skill of Star Palace as my trump card.”

“You’re not wrong,” the King of Venomous Worms laughed, “Since that’s the case, go ahead and challenge the next level!”

Jian Wushuang’s body moved right away.

…

Outside the Star Moon Tower, numerous Ancient Gods focused their attention on the Star Moon Tower.

Although they were unable to see what was happening inside the Star Moon Tower, they could tell how many levels Jian Wushuang had cleared from the dim light that the Star Moon Tower was emitting.

At that moment, the fifth level of the Star Moon Tower emitted a dim light.

After seeing that, many Ancient Gods present could not help but be shocked.

“The fifth level has been cleared?”

“Firstly, he is the first person in the history of the Ancient God Clan to clear the fifth level of the Star Moon Tower!”

“The First person in history!”

Countless Ancient Gods on the drill ground roared madly and all of them were extremely excited.

Atop the sacrificial altar, many top Six-star Ancient Gods, including the two Seven-star Ancient Gods, became silent.

However, this silence only continued for a short while.

“This damn little kid!”

A furious voice could be heard and everyone atop the sacrificial altar looked toward the source of the voice.

The face of a red-haired, big old man, who was sitting on the throne, was filled with anger at that very moment, “This little kid has actually come to the sixth level that I am guarding!”

“The sixth level?”

The top Six-star Ancient Gods and even the two Seven-star Ancient Gods King Gu Yi as well Gu Mei could not help but reveal an astonished expression at that very moment.

It was still not enough, even though he had cleared the first five levels!

At that very moment, he still wanted to clear the sixth level?

“This little kid, what does he treat the Star Moon Tower as?” King Gu Yi could not help but shout furiously.

…

At the space of the sixth level in the Star Moon Tower.

The Ancient God shadow of the red-haired, big old man was only a ten-meter tall Gold-armored Ancient God, and he was standing in front of Jian Wushuang.

However, he was different from the guard of the fifth level. When Jian Wushuang faced the Gold-armored Ancient God on the space of the sixth level, he felt an extremely great amount of pressure.

“As expected. The guard of the sixth level has fighting capabilities comparable to an Eternal Real God’s who stands at the top. However, it is only because of this that it will be challenging,” as Jian Wushuang laughed, a tremendous amount of fighting intent rose from his body and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands started to shake madly.

“As a Five-star Ancient God, you have managed to clear the first five levels of the Star Moon Tower and you should have unlimited possibilities in your future. However, it’s a pity that you have chosen the wrong path.”

The Ancient God shadow of the red-haired tall old man looked down at Jian Wushuang, “I am different from the guards of the first five levels. Not only are they restricted in terms of their abilities, even their Unique Skills are restricted as well.”

“However, at the sixth level, I can unleash all my Unique Skills to my liking. Thus, you… have no chance!”
