Chapter 5488 The Cruel Path

That place was a true purgatory.

Even the supreme-peak experts couldn't guarantee their safety in that place. It was a place where even peak figures like Shan Jun could possibly fall. If they were to fall down there, it was doubtful that anyone would come to their rescue in time, and they might meet their demise.

Dongshen and Wanyan were not very familiar with the Second Prison, so Jian Wushuang recounted the information he had learned from Wu Zuo.

The two had somber expressions, and hesitation filled their hearts.

Cultivators traversed a perilous path, dancing on the edge of a blade with each step, each move a gamble.

But they also calculated their gains and losses.

The inheritance of the Universe Master was undoubtedly important, but compared to one's own life, it seemed somewhat less worthwhile.

Jian Wushuang quickly made up his mind; whoever wanted to go, let them go. He certainly wouldn't.

Taking Divine General Moyin as his master would be good. Currently, he was lacking such a powerful backing.

Divine General Moyin was not under the jurisdiction of the Elder Palace; he was a core member of Qishen Temple, even surpassing the Elder Palace and the Four Great Temples in influence.

Although the glory of the past was no longer there, with the strength of the supreme-peak and being the Ultimate Emperor, at least he could guide Jian Wushuang a bit.

"Daoist Friend Wushuang, do you know what kind of beings are imprisoned in the Second Prison?" Wanyan was still a bit unwilling to give up.

Dongshen had broken through to tier 6 and had the ability to go to the Grave God Mountain.

He could choose not to take risks, but he was still a distance away from tier 6. In the river of time and space, he had already completed the cosmic secret techniques he had obtained, and now he lacked a legacy that could help him.

He didn't want to give up this excellent opportunity.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. He only knew that the Second Prison was very dangerous, capable of causing the fall of supreme-peak experts. As for the beings imprisoned, he truly had no idea.

Standing beside them, Dongshen patted Wanyan on the shoulder and comforted him, "A true man is born between heaven and earth, able to advance and retreat. Don't be reckless for a momentary danger!"

"Hmph!" Wanyan snorted coldly, retorting, "You've already broken through to tier 6, so you're not in a hurry. But my realm is still far behind, and the Dao of the Shadow is the most difficult. Without that cosmic inheritance, I don't know when I'll be able to cultivate to what level!"

Dongshen, seeing this, withdrew his hand, unsure of what to say.

That is true!

The Dao is cruel; if you don't compete, you'll be left behind, surpassed by future generations, surpassed by peers.

They were all anxious, especially within the Qishen Temple. If they didn't progress quickly, once the gap widened, it would be challenging to catch up.

One step, fast steps, step by step.

At least the two of them were faster than tier 5 Emperors of other Original Universes.

"Have you made up your mind?" The face of the Demon Sound Divine General appeared in the sky.

Wanyan did not give up and asked, "Senior, if I fall into the Second Prison, how long would it take for you to rescue me?"

"One incense stick's time," Divine General Moyin said indifferently.

He sent Wu Zuo to establish a passage inside the prison.

Although this place was connected to the Second Prison, it was a one-way passage. You could only enter, not exit.

If someone fell inside, even if Divine General Moyin entered at the first moment, it would take time to search because of random teleportation.

This was still considered fast, because Wu Zuo was inside to assist. Otherwise, it would take at least an hour.

"One incense stick's time!" Wanyan gritted his teeth and thought in his heart, "Let's gamble!"

With his Myriad Shadows technique, he could hold on for 10 breaths in front of a supreme-peak expert. If he burned his Origin Source desperately, he could withstand 20 breaths!

As long as his luck wasn't that bad and he didn't encounter a supreme-peak expert right after entering, he could endure.

This was a life-or-death gamble. If he encountered a large group of supreme-peak existences as soon as he entered, then he could only say he was unlucky.

"I choose to walk the tightrope!" Wanyan said firmly.

Jian Wushuang and Dongshen exchanged a glance, their expressions devoid of much surprise.

Just as Wanyan had mentioned, he was unwilling to be left behind.

When Dongshen initially entered, he diligently cultivated, mastering the secret techniques to the great achievement and subsequently advancing further.

Now that Dongshen had ascended to tier 6 of Emperor, Wanyan was even more unwilling to stagnate.¬†no.vel.next.c~om

Without much hesitation, Jian Wushuang was not particularly eager for the Universe Master's inheritance. He had a significant chance of obtaining it at the Grave God Mountain, especially with the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard in his possession, where the Origin Source of the Universe Master abounded, along with the legacy of the First True King.

Within the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard, there was a set of chess pieces with hierarchical titles left by the First True King as an inheritance.

These pieces were categorized as pawn, rook, general, and deity.

Currently, Jian Wushuang could only imitate a portion of the pawn-ranked chess pieces. Only when he could imitate the general-ranked chess pieces could he unlock the inheritance of the First True King.

However, when he heard the spiritual consciousness of the First True King back then, although this inheritance was complete, the created secret techniques and some cultivation experiences were not suitable for him.

Saying so, who could guarantee that his power of all things wasn't picky?

He never thought that the universal inheritance he obtained in the primitive realm would be related to the sword dao. Hence, he made the decision to give it up without hesitation.

"I'm going too!" Jian Wushuang was startled; he never expected Dongshen to tread the same precarious path.

"Haha, since we're here, not taking a stroll would surely be a lifelong regret. Wanyan, I'll accompany you!" Dongshen grinned.

At this moment, he truly wished to be born as a mighty being in the vast expanse of the heavens and earth.

Wanyan's expression changed, then he chuckled, "What's the matter? Are you afraid that I'll surpass you in inheriting the Universe Master's legacy?"

"Don't even say that. I did worry about that!" This

statement was clearly a jest, a way to lighten the mood as they faced imminent death.

Jian Wushuang smiled, "Then let me congratulate you two in advance. May you succeed and inherit the legacy of the Universe Master!"

These two individuals were truly prepared to go all out. Wanyan possessed the Myriad Shadows, and Dongshen was a tier 6 Emperor.

With some means at their disposal, they probably had a chance to survive under the pressure of a supreme-peak opponent.

However, Jian Wushuang had none of these advantages.

Even with the most powerful means, merely surviving under a tier 6 Emperor was considered good, not to mention facing the formidable supreme-peak experts.

"Wushuang, aren't you going?" Dongshen asked in surprise.

Wanyan, however, laughed and scolded, "Jian Wushuang follows the Ultimate Dao. Can you compare to him?"

"Oh, I almost forgot. Wushuang doesn't need to go all out!" Suddenly, Dongshen remembered that Jian Wushuang had embarked on the Ultimate Dao.

He would undoubtedly become much stronger than them in the future, with greater potential, and Qishen Temple would focus on nurturing him. There was no need for him to go all out.

Seeing these two individuals going all out, Jian Wushuang couldn't help but feel a bit itchy to join the fray and inadvertently revealed the truth.

"To be honest, I'm still just a Dao Lord. If I were an Emperor, I wouldn't give up this time. It's just that the gap in strength is too significant, and I don't have confidence!" Jian Wushuang spoke with a hint of desolation.

Upon hearing that Jian Wushuang was only a Dao Lord, Dongshen and Wanyan were astonished.Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for ùíèew ùíèovels

"You're a Dao Lord?"

"How is that possible? In the Blood Dance, you weren't much weaker than the two of us. Can a Dao Lord compare to a tier 6 Emperor?" Wanyan was particularly surprised!
