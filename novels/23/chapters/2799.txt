Chapter 2800: Ultimate Technique!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The surging pure divine power formed a huge divine power sea in the blink of an eye.

This divine power sea was boundless and contained too much divine power.

It was completely beyond the imagination of all the great divine venerables present.

“How can there be such a huge divine power?”

“Divine power sea, such a huge divine power sea?”

“This divine power sea is emitted from Jian Yi’s body? Such a huge amount of divine power, even a top-notch immortal saint is only so-so, right?”

A series of shocked voices sounded.

The Great Divine Paragons that were fighting on both sides were all staring at this burst of divine power sea with incomparable shock.

And this vast god power sea swept out without restraint, engulfing the entire battlefield.

Immediately after, the vast god power condensed into many large hands, crazily grabbing towards the experts of the Allied forces.

“Damn it! !”

“What is he trying to do?”

“The god power sea covers the entire battlefield. Could it be that he wants to fight against all of us by himself! ?”

The experts of the Allied forces were stunned.

They found that the divine power sea had completely isolated the entire battlefield and separated their opponents. Then, the giant hand formed by the Divine Power Sea came to grab them.

It was obvious that he was trying to fight against the entire Allied forces.

“He’s courting death!”

“He doesn’t know how to Live!”

The experts of the Allied forces were shocked and furious.

They admitted that Jian Wushuang’s divine power sea was vast. However, once it was formed and rushed toward them, it consumed a lot of divine power. They thought that Jian wushuang would not be able to hold on for long, at most, his divine power would be exhausted in a moment.

However, they did not expect that Jian Wushuang’s divine power was so vast that it was ridiculous.

Under the crazy impact of the Divine Power Sea, it covered the entire battlefield and swept all the experts of the four forces.

In the center of the Divine Power Sea, Jian wushuang directly attacked.

Whoosh!

He appeared directly in front of Ba Xiong as if he had teleported.

Ba Xiong was also very powerful. He had always had the upper hand in the fierce battle with his companions.

When he saw Jian Wushuang’s arrival, his pupils suddenly shrank.

He did not dare to be careless with Jian wushuang, because they had killed palace master Nan Wu in front of Jian wushuang.

Jian wushuang drew his sword.

He drew his sword casually, looking like an ordinary person slashing a wooden sword.

However, when he drew his long sword, an extremely weak, extremely dim, and obviously incomplete light immediately lit up.

It was a streak of residual light!

However, when this streak of residual light appeared, in the blink of an eye, there were at least hundreds and thousands of streaks of residual light everywhere.

In Ba Xiong’s eyes, there was only one Jian Wushuang in front of him, but now there were hundreds and thousands of them.

It was the eighth move of the space-time sword art, thousand-sided residual light!

It was the same sword move that killed Palace Master Nan Wu’s sword move.

Under the influence of the sword principle world, Jian wushuang’s sword principle and swordsmanship had been greatly improved, and this sword move had become even more mysterious.

Ba Xiong subconsciously wanted to block the remnant light when he saw it, but suddenly, a trace of shock flashed in his eyes.

The remnant light had already passed through his neck.

“Too, too fast.”

Ba Xiong’s eyes were wide open, and his face was filled with unprecedented fear. However, his voice began to fade away.

In the surrounding void, the great divine masters from both sides who saw this scene turned pale with fright.

“One sword, one sword killed a peak great divine master!”

“How could sword one be so powerful?”

The great divine masters were all trembling in their hearts.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had used this move to kill Palace Master Nan Wu. However, because Jian wushuang had used several killing moves in succession, palace master Nan Wu had been severely injured and died under this move, they did not know how powerful this move was.

But now... with Jian wushuang killing Ba Xiong with one move, no one dared to ignore his swordsmanship.

“The move he just made...”yin su’er stared at Jian wushuang with a serious expression. “The ultimate ultimate skill. It’s definitely the ultimate skill!”

“The ultimate skill! He created the ultimate skill!”The life and Death Tower master screamed.

The experts who knew what the ultimate skill represented were also shocked.

When one’s strength reached the divine lord level, most of them would start to create their own ultimate skills and ultimate moves.

For example, the Kirin Strange Beast That Palace Master Nan Wu had used before, which was completely formed from Black Lightning, was extremely powerful.

And ultimate skills and ultimate skills also had different levels of strength.

The ultimate skill referred to the ultimate skill at the divine lord level.

To be called the ultimate, it was naturally the strongest and most tyrannical absolute arts.

Absolute arts at this level were extremely powerful and terrifying, but it was also very, very difficult to create them.

Palace Master Nan Wu had been invincible in the Sacred Pill Sun world for so many years, but she still hadn’t created an ultimate absolute art. This could be seen from this.

In the absolute beginning divine realm, anyone who could create an ultimate absolute art was the most terrifying existence among the divine venerates. Although this existence couldn’t compare to the undying sage, it was already completely above the great divine venerate, they even had a unique title, which was... Invincible divine venerables!

Invincible divine venerables were the invincible existences among the divine venerables.

Each of them easily massacred a large group of great divine venerables, or even peak great divine venerables. They were absolutely the most terrifying existences among the divine venerables.

However, there were too few such invincible divine venerables.

Under normal circumstances, there might not even be one in a sacred world, like the Pill Sun Sacred World.

And even in the entire nine realms of the Golden Crow, there were only a handful of invincible divine masters.

But now, Jian Wushuang had created the ultimate ultimate skill... this meant that not only did Jian wushuang have this terrifying ultimate skill, but his comprehension of sword principle and rule had reached the highest level that a divine master could reach, he was infinitely close to the immortal saint.

If there was only one gap between him and the invincible divine master, it was the gap in divine power.

After all, his divine power was only at the peak of the great divine master level. Even so, he could still easily kill a great divine master at the peak.

“Die!”

Jian wushuang moved through the battlefield like a ghost. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand was like the scythe of the god of death, casually brandishing it.

Each of his strikes seemed to be casual.

However, each of his strikes was extremely fast, so fast that the great divine masters could not even catch the sword shadow.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

The sword light easily passed through the divine bodies or necks of the experts. Even with the protection of the body-protecting armor, the strangling power contained in it could not be resisted.
