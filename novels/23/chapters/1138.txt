Chapter 1139: Coalescence!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang sat down cross-legged in the World of Swords, concentrating on the tree in front of him.

He continued to receive enlightenment.

Simultaneously, he could faintly find his own path.

It was a path that could lead him to turn the Coalescence Sword Principle of the Creation Level into the strongest Sword Principle.

“Coalescence Sword Principle, namely Unification Sword, will unite everything in the same way the sea converges all rivers.”

“All rivers flow into the sea!”

He gradually closed his eyes and began to carefully study the Sword Principle.

He carefully observed the way the tree derived and the image turned into a huge picture in his mind. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

There was a core in the middle of the picture, branching out into numerous light rays.

What he was currently doing was integrating the countless lights into the core.

His understanding of the Coalescence Sword Principle deepened as time passed.

It would have taken him years to figure out the way and direction to break through. However, being able to watch the tree grow in the World of Swords made his task much simpler.

Comprehension became much easier now that he had a direction in mind.

10 years passed just like that as he meditated.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes as he sat before the tree, his Sword Essence now completely changed. It used to be fierce and aggressive but it was now like a huge black hole that swallowed everything around him.

His Sword Essence was as deep as a bottomless pit.

It was mysterious, magnificent, and ready to embrace the whole world.

“Coalescence Sword Principle is the first Sword Principle that I developed and it’s finally at its strongest level after continuous evolution!” Jian Wushuang looked pleasantly surprised.

In his 10 years in the World of Swords, he had succeeded in advancing the Coalescence Sword Principle through the continuous evolution in his mind.

The Coalescence Sword Principle of the Strongest Level could contain all Sword Principles of inferior levels.

It could also contain his two other Sword Principles, Speed Sword Principle and Yin-Yang Sword Principle, as they were only of the Creation Level.

Just then, he felt an incorporeal fluctuation sweeping him.

He was surprised.

“My time here is up just as I finished evolving the Coalescence Sword Principle. Perfect timing!” Jian Wushuang grinned. With a flash of light, he reappeared outside of the World of Swords.

He found himself standing in front of a tree that was neither as tall as the one in the World of Swords or carried the same special Sword Essence. Sunrise Sword Emperor was waiting for him.

“Swoosh!”

Jian Wushuang walked out of the tree under a flickering light.

“Hm?”

Sunrise Sword Emperor was surprised when he saw Jian Wushuang.

He was, after all, the number one Sword Cultivator in the Green Fire World and second to none in terms of Sword Principles. Sensitive to Sword Principles as he was, he could clearly sense the amazing change in Jiang Wushuang.

“Congratulations, Jian Wushuang,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

Jian Wushuang laughed brightly.

“I could detect a majestic Sword Essence from you. It seems capable of containing everything.” “If I’m not mistaken, you must’ve developed a Strongest Sword Principle,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

“Yes. I’ve named it Coalescence Sword Principle,” Jian Wushuang answered frankly.

“Coalescence Sword Principle? Unification Sword? Interesting.” Sunrise Sword Emperor nodded. “Since you’ve developed a Strongest Sword Principle, I think you’ll soon become a Dao Master and then a Celestial Master. When that day comes, I’d like to have a battle with you.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

Inside Jian Wushuang, Gu King laughed. “He’s gifted in Sword Principle but lacks a broad outlook being confined in the Green Fire World. He doesn’t realize your real potential. He wants to fight with you when you become a Celestial Master? That’s unnecessary. You can even beat him after becoming a Dao Master.”

“Well…” Jian Wushuang was speechless.

“Well, let’s go back,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

He then took Jian Wushuang back to Green Fire Palace quickly.

Sunrise Sword Emperor excused himself after they arrived at the palace. Jian Wushuang also began his preparation to become a Dao Master.

If he wanted to be a Dao Master from the Eternal Realm, the most crucial thing to do was developing his own path.

Jian Wushuang had already developed his own path and fulfilled other factors for his breakthrough. He had been suppressing his level because he was waiting to develop a Strongest Sword Principle.

Now that he had succeeded, it was naturally time to become a Dao Master.

Nevertheless, he was an Inverse Cultivator. Compared to ordinary warriors, it was harder for him to break through and thus, needed a complete preparation.

“You probably won’t face any problems in breaking through but as an Inverse Cultivator, you may cause a commotion. You might attract unnecessary attention if you make your breakthrough here,” Gu King said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang gave a small nod.

Since Dao Masters were among top experts in the Green Fire World, it was normal for there to be a commotion when a warrior tried to advance into a Dao Master.

He would cause an even greater stir as an Inverse Cultivator.

He had proven his potential with his absolute strength and convinced many Celestial Masters of Green Fire Palace to acknowledge him. Since there was no need to show off again, he should find an isolated place and complete his breakthrough alone.

“Why don’t you do it on the battlefield?”

“The battlefieldis massive. Though there would be many experts of Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom wandering around, it will be hard to come across any of them. I can find a secret place to break through there and I doubt I’ll be disturbed.”

“Besides, I’ve planned to enter the battlefield after the breakthrough all along.”

With that, Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

He then left for the battlefield once again.

Few people knew about his departure, save for several Palace Masters and Celestial Masters whom he informed.

However, Celestial Master Golden Axe somehow got wind of it.
