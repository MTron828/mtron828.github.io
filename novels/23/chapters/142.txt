Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang? He said his name is Jian Wushuang.”

“I haven’t heard that name before.”

“With a sword in hand, no one is his match! So arrogant!”

“He is supposed to be a swordsman, but he defeated Ouyang Haoyue without a sword.”

The numerous surrounding warriors were discussing.

They had never heard the name Jian Wushuang name before. But, from this day forward, they would remember it.

Not just them, the countless warriors in the entire Tianzong Dynasty would know his name very soon.

After all, he had defeated Ouyang Haoyue, who ranked 21st at the Earthly Dragon List. And it was a thorough defeat. Of course, he would become famous after today.

“What Jian Wushang? You are absolutely Swordsman!” Ouyang Haoyue glared at Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman!” Su Lie, who was standing aside, looked over at Jian Wushuang with wide eyes as he shouted.

His “Swordsman” was enough to prove Jian Wushuang’s identity.

“Swordsman?”

“He is that Swordsman who defeated Xiao Mang, killed the purple-masked assassin from Blood Feather Tower, and then jumped into the Abyss two years ago?”

“He jumped into the Abyss and died, didn’t he? How can he... Still be alive?”

Everyone at the scene was shocked.

However, Jian Wushuang just slightly smiled.

He did not defeat Ouyang Haoyue to become famous around the world. He just wanted to recover his name and identity.

Swordsman...was just an alias he had used to avoid Blood Feather Tower’s pursuit.

Jian Wushuang was his genuine name.

At this moment, he wanted everyone to know that Swordsman had died two years ago and Jian Wushuang had been reborn like a phoenix!

“Swordsman, is it really you?” Su Lie ran over.

“Su Lie, I haven’t seen you for two years. How are you?” Jian Wushuang replied and smiled.

“You did not die?” Su Lie asked in surprise.

Jian Wushuang shrugged, reached out towards Ouyang Haoyue, and then said, “Hand over the Cloud Dream Ginkgo.”

Ouyang Haoyue’s face turned gloomy, with dense unwillingness in his eyes. But, he knew the strength gap between himself and Jian Wushuang. He did not dare to refuse,?immediately handing the Cloud Dream Ginkgo to Jian Wushuang.

Jiang Wushuang gave the Cloud Dream Ginkgo to Su Lie.

“I appreciate it a lot,” Su Lie said gratefully.

Jian Wushuang just smiled slightly.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t be so happy! This is not over yet,” Ouyang Haoyue said bitterly.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ouyang Haoyue.

“If my guess is correct, won’t you be participating in the event?” Ouyang Haoyue said coldly.

“Event? What event?” Jian Wushuang asked while looking puzzled.

“Stop pretending!” Ouyang Haoyue sneered, “You are a Disciple of Dragon Palace. Of course you will take part in this event on behalf of Dragon Palace. So we’ll meet again. When that happens,?I will make sure to return today’s humiliation to you twofold.”

“You’ll return it to me twofold? By yourself?” Jian Wushuang slightly curled the corners of his mouth.

“Of course not from me. It will be from my big brother,” Ouyang Haoyue said.

“Your big brother, Ouyang Haotian?” Jian Wushang’s smile grew even bigger.

There was an introduction to Ouyang Haoyue’s background in the Earthly Dragon List. Jian Wushuang knew that he came from the Ouyang clan, one of the seven oldest clans in Tianzong Dynasty. Ouyang Haoyue also had a big brother named Ouyang Haotian, who ranked 6th two years ago but was now ranked 3rd on the Earthly Dragon List!

It was said that Ouyang Haoyue had recently defeated the former 3rd rank, Mu Yingying from the Mu clan.

Ranking 3rd on the Earthly Dragon List definitely demonstrate Ouyang Haotian’s strength.

“Then, I’ll be waiting,”Jian Wushuang said, then slightly smiled.

“Just wait and see!” Ouyang Haoyue coldly snorted, and then left with hatred.

“This Ouyang Haoyue is quite narrow-minded!” Jian Wushuang said and smiled.

“Humph! He is a petty man, but his big brother is really strong,” Su Lie said seriously.

“Maybe.” Jian Wushuang casually nodded. He did not care too much.

3rd rank on the Earthly Dragon List was really strong. But Jian Wushuang was no longer the boy from two years ago.

“Swordsman, I never thought you were still alive. Haha! This is a major event for the whole Dragon Palace. Come on! Let’s go to Dragon Palace.” Su Lie smiled and said, “Little sister, you can head back first.”

“Okay.” The red-robed girl standing beside Su Lie nodded.

Then, following Su Lie, Jian Wushuang walked toward Dragon Palace.

...

At Dragon Palace. The moment Jian Wushuang returned, everyone in Dragon Palace was shocked.

“What? Who? Who has returned?” Palace Master White was stunned by the news.

“It’s Swordsman. He has returned,” replied the purple-robed servant who delivered the news.

“Swordsman?” The expression on Palace Master White’s face became complicated.

Jian Wushuang was the talent whom she thought most highly of. Two years ago, when it was said that Jian Wushuang had been forced to jump into the abyss, she was the saddest one. But now, Jian Wushuang had returned?

“Go! Go! Bring him here quickly!”

“Oh, no! I’ll go get him myself. Haha! The exceptional genius of our Dragon Palace has returned!”

...

Inside Dragon Palace.

Jian Wushang and Su Lie slowly walked forward, side by side, surrounded by the disciples of Dragon Palace.

When these disciples saw Jian Wushuang, their expression became very weird.

“It really is Swordsman!”

“It’s him!”

“He didn’t die?”

“He jumped into the Abyss, didn’t he? How can he still be alive?”

These disciples all felt it inconceivable.

After all, many warriors had witnessed Jian Wushuang jumping into the Abyss. It was a fact.

Jumping into the Abyss definitely meant death! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Even the Millennium Chronicle, compiled by the Gladiator, said that an exceptional genius had passed away. Alas! How sad!

But now, Jian Wushuang had not died and he just appeared in front of everyone, alive?

“Third Brother! Third Brother!”

A shout of awe and exultation was suddenly heard in front. Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked over. He immediately noticed Wang Yuan rushing towards him with Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou beside him.

“Haha! Elder Brother Wang Yuan!” Jian Wushang walked towards him with a laugh.

“Third Brother! I missed you so much!” Wang Yuan directly gave Jian Wushuang a big hug.

“Second Brother! It’s been a long time since we saw each other.” Jiang Wushuang looked towards Yang Zaixuan, reaching out his fist.

“Welcome back!” A smile appeared on Yang Zaixuan’s cold face as he reached out to bump fists with Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, Fourth Sister!” Jian Wushuang then turned towards the shy Su Rou and directly gave her a hug.

Su Rou did not resist, but her face turned bright red.

Two years later, the four of them had finally met again.

“Swordsman!” A clear and cold voice was heard. After which, Palace Master White walked towards him, followed by a crowd of Temple Masters.

“It really is Swordsman!”

“Little guy, how are you so lucky?”

“We all thought he had died, so we took revenge on the Blood Feather Tower. No one ever expected the boy was still alive.”

Seeing Jian Wushuang, the Temple Masters talked casually, smiling.

“Swordsman, follow me!” Palace Master White spoke directly.

Jian Wushuang raised his brow and shot a glance at Wang Yuan and the other two. “I’ll go with Palace Master White first, then join you later.”

“Okay, I’ll prepare some good wine for you. Let us four siblings drink heartily and have a good time later,” Wang Yuan said and then laughed.

“Yes!” Jian Wushuang nodded, then followed Palace Master White and left.
