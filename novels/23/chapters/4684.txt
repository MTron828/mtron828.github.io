4685 Great Yan Domain

In the 32nd year of Jingjing, the Bai Manor in Changping County gave birth to a strange son who grew old to 527 years old without any illness or disaster. The later generations were amazed.

After experiencing so many tribulations, it was not necessarily a bad thing to reincarnate.

In the Rodu Star Field, which was still in a state of destruction, there were only two figures left.

Ninth Kalpa King stood far away in the void, watching the thin but firm figure move forward step by step.

He did not know when they would meet again after this farewell, but everything was already set in stone and could not be changed.

The peerless genius who had stunned everyone had left just like that.

Jian Wushuang looked back at Ninth Kalpa King for the last time and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. Then, he stepped into the gate of heaven that was as vast as the galaxy.

Whizzzzz…

Billions of divine light rays scattered across the sky like tassels before completely vanishing into nothingness.

Ninth Kalpa King stood on the spot, lost in thought. He seemed to not believe that Jian Wushuang had already left.

However, there was no aura left by Jian Wushuang in the entire boundless Divine Power Universe.

It was as if he had never been there before, and also like a passerby who had stopped in a hurry. No one knew where he had gone in the end.

After a long time, Ninth Kalpa King murmured softly, “The Great Yan Domain? I’ll remember that.”

Along with the terrifying squall in the space-time turbulence, Jian Wushuang felt a sharp pain in his body almost instantly.

He cut off his past completely and stripped off his clay idol True Shadow. All of his Ancestor fate energy was returned to the Divine Power Universe.

While cutting off the Ancestor realm path, he had also entered the Yan Immortal Realm.

It was an even more mysterious realm. It was so mysterious that even Jian Wushuang, who had successfully ascended, could not explain it.

However, the only thing he could be sure of was that the Yan Immortal was a special existence that had surpassed the Ancestor realm.

This was because the symbol of Yan Immortal, Yan power was a mighty energy that was not much higher than divine power but had a unique growth property.

The Yan Immortal was also the symbol of entering the Great Yan Domain.

However, Jian Wushuang’s current situation was a little awkward. Although he had taken that step, his Yan power was still in a weak state and it was difficult for him to resist the space-time turbulence effectively.

One had to know that even the Sword Immortal Ding Baiyi’s realm could suffer a great loss from the space-time turbulence if he was not careful.

He was no longer wandering around like a headless fly in the chaos of time and space like before. There was a weak force guiding him.

He did not know how many years he had been walking in the chaotic darkness. Just when he felt like he was about to run out of oil, a crack of the space that was emitting an invisible white light appeared in front of him.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and stepped into it.

Almost at the same time, layers of unparalleled pressure enveloped his body. Jian Wushuang, who was already at the end of his rope, had no power to fight back and directly fainted.

History was always the same. Jian Wushuang, who came to the Great Yan Domain for the second time, was as embarrassing as he was the first time…

The intense pain spread through his limbs and bones, and then he was woken up by cold water.

Jian Wushuang suddenly woke up from his unconscious state and saw two servant-like figures looking at him with a faint smile.

“You’re clearly awake, yet you still dare to continue playing dead?” One of the brawny men laughed and pulled out a black bone whip from his waist. The black and purple wind whipped at Jian Wushuang.

Even though he had just woken up from a coma, the battle instinct that was deeply ingrained in his bones made him attack almost instantly. He grabbed the tip of the whip with his large hand and slapped the bearded man at the same time.

It was conceivable that Jian Wushuang’s terrifying move would definitely kill him easily.

But then, a strange scene appeared.

The chain iron medal engraved with complicated patterns on Jian Wushuang’s neck suddenly released a great power that traveled through his limbs and bones, imprisoning him.

“Ah…” Jian Wushuang cried out in pain and knelt on the ground.

The bearded man, whose legs were trembling with fear due to the killing intent, did not dare to be impudent. He immediately screamed and retreated.

At the same time, there were lightning snakes writhing in the dark sky.

The torrential rain fell, washing the earth.

Jian Wushuang lay on his side on the ground. The confinement made him unable to even breathe.

On the ground covered in rough black-gray soil, there were more than a hundred thousand figures with barely any clothes on. As the rain fell from the sky, they were all facing upwards, allowing the rain to wash over their bodies.

Each of them had a chain and metal token wrapped around their neck, imprisoning their divine souls and bodies.

In the heavy rain, an extremely thin figure slowly came to Jian Wushuang. Then, he stretched out an arm, put him on his shoulder, and walked toward a huge cave.

The storm stopped, and the hundred thousand figures slowly entered the cave.

After an unknown amount of time, Jian Wushuang slowly woke up and all he could see was the dim firelight.

“I… Where am I…”

He barely managed to support his body and sit up.

When he saw nearly a thousand figures sitting around him, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

How could there be so many people gathered in a cave like this? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Everyone looked at him with numb and empty eyes, not saying a word.

The thin figure who carried him back into the cave sized him up and said, “Go to sleep. There’s still work to be done tomorrow. Don’t die of exhaustion.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone fell to the ground, and the cave became even more eerily silent.

Slowly suppressing the depression in his heart, Jian Wushuang asked, “What is this place?”

“Your grave,” the thin figure said concisely.

Jian Wushuang did not ask any more questions. Instead, he tried to remove the chain iron plate from his neck.

However, he had only touched it slightly when the mighty power from the chain iron token instantly knocked him out again.

Time passed by quietly. When the last ray of light in the huge cave disappeared, everything was truly dead silent.

“Wake up, it’s time to work.”

With a slight push, Jian Wushuang woke up in a daze.

At this moment, the sky outside had already brightened up, and the people living in the cave began to line up and walk toward the exit.

The thin figure turned his head and left with big steps.

Jian Wushuang got up slowly and followed the team in a daze.

Although the sky was bright, there were no traces of the sun. There were still thick dark clouds in the distance.

Dozens of black mountains that were almost connected to the sky and more than 100,000 prisoners with chains and iron plates on their necks were the main colors of this place.

Jian Wushuang was sure that he had arrived at the Great Yan Domain.

However, the scene in front of him made him suspicious.

How did he come to this place, and it seemed like he had become a prisoner?
