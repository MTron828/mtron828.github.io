Chapter 134: Clearwater Stronghold

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In one of the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palaces in Tianyan Province.

Jian Wushuang, still dressed in black and wearing a bamboo hat, directly came to the counter and took out his token from Dragon Palace.

“Sir, come with me please.” After the blue-haired woman at the front counter saw the token, she immediately led Jian Wushuang into a private room.

“Give me all the files on Blood Feather Tower within my access permission, including strongholds of Blood Feather Tower in Tianyan Province, the number of experts, and the strength of those strongholds etc. Besides that, give me a copy of the Earthly Dragon List as well,” Jian Wushuang said.

The Earthly Dragon List would be renewed every once in a while. Since two years had passed, the list should have changed a lot.

“Yes Sir,” the blue-haired woman nodded and said. Soon she gave Jian Wushuang a lot of files. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang read them carefully.

“Oh. It is as I expected. Blood Feather Tower did suffer a desperate revenge after the battle on Quiet Moon Lake.”?Jian Wushuang smiled slightly when he saw the information about the battle.

When Dragon Palace heard of his death, the two Palace Masters of Dragon Palace along with many top experts retaliated against Blood Feather Tower in a full-scale attack. Many strongholds of Blood Feather Tower in Tianzong Dynasty suffered a bloodbath and lots of experts were killed, which was one of the few setbacks Blood Feather Tower had gone through.

But it just lasted for two months and suddenly died down.

“Blood Feather Tower had undoubtedly been in danger and was about to be destroyed, but why did everything suddenly die down?”?Jian Wushuang didn’t understand.

If there was no particular reason, they would not have stopped so easily.

“It seems that the background of Blood Feather Tower is not as simple as it seems,”

Jian Wushuang thought.

Then he looked at another file.

It was about the distribution of strongholds of Blood Feather Tower in Tianyan Province and their strength.

It said that the strength of Blood Feather Tower is much weaker because of the bloodbath two years ago. Now they behaved more carefully than before and their strongholds are located at easier to conceal places. Even Golden-dragon Palace could only locate three strongholds of Blood Feather Tower in Tianyan Province.

It astonished Jian Wushuang.

It should be known that Tianyan Province was an important place for Blood Feather Tower. However, there were as many as 108 commanderies in Tianyan Province, how could they run it well with only three strongholds? They need at least a dozen.

But their strongholds were secluded.

Even as the best at collecting information in Tianzong Dynasty, Golden-dragon Palace could only locate three of their strongholds.

Among the three, two of them were small. Only the last one was an important one.

“Clearwater Stronghold?” Jian Wushuang squinted.

Clearwater Stronghold, located in Clearwater Commandery of Tianyan Province. There were a lot of copper-masked and silver-masked assassins, as well as many golden-masked assassins. Most importantly, there were two purple-masked assassins and an intelligence director in it.

While in those two small strongholds, there were only a couple of golden-masked assassins, Jian Wushuang was not interested in them at all.

“Blood Feather Tower has established a well-defined intelligence system. Once I take action, Blood Feather Tower will notice immediately. It’s impossible to get a second chance. Therefore, the action must be fast, relentless, and bring a great loss!”Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

Losing some gold-masked assassins was nothing to Blood Feather Tower, who was one of the three Hegemons in Tianzong Dynasty. They would not care. However, it would be different if they lost some purple-masked assassins.

Especially in the battle two years ago, Blood Feather Tower had paid a huge price, which made purple-masked assassins even more important.

If Jian Wushuang could kill several purple-masked assassins this time, it would definitely be a big loss for Blood Feather Tower.

“These two purple-masked assassins are in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, but only the initial Yin-Yang Void Realm. They are about the same as the purple-masked assassin who was severely wounded. Even his right hand was disabled by me near Quiet Moon Lake two years ago. It’s possible to kill them both,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

An assassins’ strength in the same realm could vary. Some were stronger and some were weaker. These two purple-masked assassins in Clearwater Stronghold were weaker ones.

Two years ago, Jian Wushuang severely hurt and almost killed a purple-masked assassin with his Soul-Devouring Secret Skill. Now... even without using it, he was quite sure that he could kill them with only his comprehension in sword essence.

“I will take Clearwater Stronghold.”

Jian Wushuang decided.

Of course, the reason he targeted Clearwater Stronghold was not only because of those two purple-masked assassins, but also because of another man.

He was the one who was in charge of the intelligence system there.

His name was An Ying!

Jian Wushuang would never forget him.

Three years ago, some assassins from Blood Feather Tower chased him from Sword Marquis Mansion. And their leader was An Ying.

What’s more, it was he who poisoned his aunt with the Heart-biting Poison, which had tortured his aunt for years.

His aunt was caught by An Ying at that time, and he didn’t know how his aunt was doing now.

”?An Ying?, you old bastard...”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes were ice-cold. Then he called the blue-haired woman and told her, “prepare me a griffin and something special.”

...

A huge rift in Clearwater Commandery.

It was a remote rift, embosomed in hills. As usual, few people came here, not even to pass by.

In the thick woods at the center of the rift, was a huge courtyard. It was Clearwater Stronghold, a quite important place for the top assassin organization in Tianzong Dynasty, Blood Feather Tower.

On the top of a mountain in the rift, Jian Wushuang stood quietly, dressed in black and wearing a bamboo hat. Watching through the Void, his cold eyes stared at the courtyard below.

“Blood Feather Tower has heavy security. To enter the stronghold, assassins of Blood Feather Tower have to signal one another, and the password alternates every day. Besides that, the killers are well trained. It is impossible to sneak in by getting the password from them.”

“The only way to get in was... kill his way in!”

A stream of killing intent could be seen rising from his body.

At this moment, thunder growled over the Void and the sky became dark.

Then a heavy rain began falling a second later.

The rain fell on the ground and the earth got wet.

“It raining...” palm outstretched, Jian Wushuang felt the rain slapping on the back of his hands.

“Since the weather is favoring me, let me enjoy slaughtering them in the heavy rain.”

Jian Wushuang changed into a straw rain cape. Then, he grabbed his sword and directly walked toward the huge courtyard in the center of the rift.
