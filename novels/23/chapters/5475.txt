Chapter 5474 ¬†Golden Bridge of Freedom¬†

If they had truly entered the temporal turbulence, it would have been a great pity. Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

The Soul steps and the Transformation Dao steps were truly extraordinary. If brought out, their effects would surpass even those of the Demon Sound Mountain.

Imitating the Origin Source of Myraid Dao was a great blessing in the school of Myriad Dao.

"Oh, by the way, Brother Wushuang, how did you restore your physical body?" Dongsheng was somewhat curious. His own physical body was already strong enough, crafted after becoming an Emperor. However, it was not comparable to the supreme physique, capable of resurrection with just a particle.

Wanyan also looked at Jian Wushuang, equally curious. He just didn't have Dongsheng's shamelessness to ask directly, after all, everyone had their own secrets.

Jian Wushuang, however, was indifferent to this. His enemies were never these people, and there was nothing to hide. It's not like it was some secret opportunity.

But this was also a small secret of his, which was actually insignificant in terms of his own strength.

"My physical body was once refined in the Demon Sound Hall. However, at that time, the Divine General Moyin had not yet appeared. There were some accidents during the refinement process, causing my physical body to blend into the Origin Source and divine body. As a result, even if I lose my physical body, I can recover it out of thin air!" Jian Wushuang explained casually.

The listeners were extremely shocked!

Dongsheng also practiced the divine body path, and his physical body was also supreme-grade. However, it had not reached the ninth refinement level, so he was extremely shocked to hear this.

"Actually, being able to integrate into the Origin Source and divine body is too miraculous. Qishen Temple is indeed extraordinary. I've never heard of such a refining method!" Dongsheng's eyes were filled with admiration. He had a favorable impression of Emperors who followed the divine body path.

Especially someone like Jian Wushuang, who had refined his physical body to such a powerful extent.

They all thought Jian Wushuang was an Emperor. Jian Wushuang didn't deny it. If he continued talking, these two wouldn't be admiring him; they would be jealous.

"Alright, let's hit the road! Let's see what surprises the second bridge has in store for us!"

The two became three, and fortunately, the journey proceeded without any other peculiar occurrences.

However, the Blood Demon's presence gave them quite a shock.

They walked until the end, taking a month's time, finally laying eyes on a golden bridge.

This time, beneath the bridge wasn't purgatorial lava but rather a mundane world.

"The Golden Bridge of Freedom!"

Ancient characters were inscribed above.

As for what lay above the bridge, there was nothing.

The more ordinary it appeared, the greater the dangers within, a fact they were all well aware of. None of them were novices; all were seasoned experts who had ventured through countless ages, having seen and experienced all kinds of worlds.

"Let's go up!" Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

There was nothing more to say. Instead of trying to decipher anything just by looking, it was better to go up and try firsthand.

This time, Wanyan displayed great courage and ascended the Golden Bridge of Freedom without hesitation.

As he ascended, Jian Wushuang and Dongsheng, who followed, noticed that once they entered the bridge, their figures disappeared.

This indicated that the Golden Bridge of Freedom was likely an independent space.

Jian Wushuang didn't hesitate and stepped onto the bridge.

The moment they entered, a warm sensation enveloped them. The scene ahead wasn't a purgatory but rather an earthly paradise.

Walking on this bridge felt as though they had descended upon the mortal realm.

Although underfoot was the Golden Bridge of Freedom, his figure was immersed in the mundane world beneath the bridge.

Various noisy sounds echoed in his ears without end. Jian Wushuang hadn't heard such sounds for a long time‚Äîthere were commoners, wealthy and elegant people, as well as women from the brothels dressed in revealing attire.

Jian Wushuang stood among these people, as if no one could detect his presence.

"What does this mean? A journey through the mundane world?" Jian Wushuang's brows slightly furrowed. If that were the case, it would be too clich√©, and he was not buying into it.

A figure like Divine General Moyin wouldn't arrange such a mediocre trial!

Yet here he was.

There must be something peculiar about this. Jian Wushuang recalled his last experience crossing the bridge, which was intricate and bizarre.

The entity who designed these three bridges was undoubtedly a powerful being who enjoyed traveling through the mortal world.

This trial tested not strength but the state of mind and the power of the soul.

Jian Wushuang began to step forward, advancing one step at a time.

As he entered, he didn't feel anything peculiar about the place.

Soon, he walked out of the Golden Bridge of Freedom. He initially thought it was straightforward, but the moment he stepped off the bridge, the surroundings became increasingly realistic.

And he himself began to change.

Qingshan City, a small alley to the west of the city.

Now, Jian Wushuang was a beggar, dragging a crooked stick in one hand and holding a broken bowl in the other.

Although he walked off the bridge, he didn't reach the other side. Instead, he fell into this mundane small city.

He had been in this place for three days, three days without a meal!

Now, he was like an ordinary mortal, or even worse than an average person. He couldn't even defeat the wild dogs in the alley.

Jian Wushuang regretted it completely; this was simply torture.

From start to finish, he couldn't discern the purpose behind all of this.

It was somewhat better passing the first bridge; it had a slight enhancement on his soul.

However, the enhancement was truly limited.

Perhaps having experienced the Soul steps, he looked down on these things now.

But what was the meaning of this second bridge?

To make him wander the mortal world?

And then throw his soul into the body of a beggar, wandering for what?

He was getting a bit intolerant.

Clang!

Jian Wushuang tossed his only remaining bowl, smashing it on the ground.

In the fenced alley, the inhabitants were all impoverished people. Seeing a beggar desperate enough to throw a bowl, some of them felt sympathy.

"Shopkeeper, give him two steamed buns on my tab!" On the roadside stall, a middle-aged man without patches on his clothes, slurping a steaming bowl of lamb tripe soup, waved his hand to signal the stall owner to give Jian Wushuang two steamed buns.

The owner of the stall was also a kind-hearted person. Not only did he give Jian Wushuang two steamed buns, but he also handed over a bowl of hot soup.

"It's better to be alive than dead. Eat up. This winter will pass quickly."

Pow!

Jian Wushuang forcefully pushed away the food offered by the other person, brandishing his stick, ready to give the person a beating.

"Get lost!"

Who was he?

He was Jian Wushuang, the Ultimate Dao Lord, the pride of the heavens. With the qualifications of a Dao Lord, he surpassed the peerless talents of the Emperor.

Did he need pity from others?

Today, even if he starved to death or froze to death lying outside, he didn't need anyone's pity.

"You!" The stall owner's expression darkened. He had never seen a beggar like this before.

Even if the stall owner were a living Buddha, he couldn't bring himself to put a warm face against a beggar's cold buttocks.

"Hmph, how ignorant!"

The stall owner walked into the house with an angry snort, ignoring Jian Wushuang.

The middle-aged man slurping his mutton soup left some copper coins and, as he slowly stood up and passed by Jian Wushuang, said, "Young man, a restless mind is not good!"

However, Jian Wushuang sneered, finding amusement in their ignorance. Yet, the following words left him stunned in his tracks.

"If you don't even have the courage to survive in the mundane world, how can you face the universe?" The middle-aged man's words lingered in the air.
