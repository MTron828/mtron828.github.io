Buzzzzzz!

At that moment, the divine patterns on Jian Wushuang’s body lit up, and his purple-gold eyes shone brightly. The purple ‘River’ character between his eyebrows flashed with a touch of flirtatiousness. His originally ordinary appearance also had an inexplicable sense of handsome and domineering aura.

“Jian Wushuang, you…”

There was a flash of anger in the eyes of the South River Supreme. He had not expected that Jian Wushuang would dare to attack him in the universe myriad Clan Gathering!

!!

“Hmph, if you used the Wuxu chaotic cauldron or the Tarot Divine Sword, I would still be a little afraid of you. How dare you fight me with your mere physical strength?”

Then, River south Supreme sneered and endless supreme divine power surged in his hands. He had made a decision in his heart. In that case, he would make Jian Wushuang look bad in the Great Clan Gathering and make him lose face in front of all the clans.

Seeing this, the other Supreme-beings looked even more amused. To them, Jian Wushuang was an anomaly, and they didn’t mind seeing Jian Wushuang embarrass himself in the universe banquet of all races.

Bang-!

A muffled sound exploded!

However, a shocking scene happened.

Jian Wushuang’s fist, which was wrapped in golden light, had directly blown apart the hands of the Shiba Supreme, inch by inch. Then, it crushed all the way and finally smashed into the chest of the Shiba Supreme.

One force breaks ten thousand techniques!

Bang! Bang! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

It was as if the chest of the xunan Supreme martial artist had been hit by a huge hammer, and a short depression appeared. Then, his entire body flew out like a cannonball, rolling down the White jade stairs.

“How did this happen?”

“Isn’t Jian Wushuang a swordsman?”

“This…this physical strength is even more powerful than me, a Supreme who specializes in physical cultivation!!

In an instant, the Supreme martial artists on both sides of the White jade stairs let out a cry of surprise.

They looked at the expressionless Jian Wushuang, their eyes filled with shock and doubt.

“Can’t even withstand a single blow.”

Jian Wushuang withdrew his fist, shook his head, and continued to walk toward the White jade stairs.

According to the white-haired ancestor, the White jade stairs were only the periphery of the Great Clan Gathering. Although they had participated in the Great Clan Gathering, they could not even see the Lord’s face. They could only get some spiritual wine and fruits at the myriad Clan Gathering. If they were lucky, they might even hear a few words from the Lord when he gave lectures.

The universe’s myriad race gathering was a gathering of all races. Basically, the top-ranked races in the universe would receive a different number of admission tickets.

However, there were very few people who were lucky enough to enter the venue and see that Lord. In the past, only those who had obtained the qualification ticket on the Ancient Path of Stars or ranked in the top ten of the universe’s top forces had a chance.

As Jian Wushuang walked up step by step, a familiar voice suddenly came from in front of him.

“Jian Wushuang, how have you been?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and saw a beautiful woman looking at him with a smile.

“And you are?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned and confused. He had never seen this woman before, but he felt that she was familiar.

“You don’t recognize me?”

The beautiful woman reached out and touched her face. A blue veil immediately appeared, covering her face below her eyes, only revealing her beautiful eyes.

“Lady Blue?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned at first, then he was surprised and said with a smile, “Lady Blue, what are you doing here?”

Jian Wushuang had a deep impression of Lady Blue and had a good impression of him.

“This is my master’s training ground. If I’m not here, where should I be?”

The beautiful woman waved her right hand and The Blue Veil disappeared. She covered her mouth and laughed.

“This is your master’s training hall?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was stunned again. He was a little confused and didn’t understand what he meant.

Wasn’t this Ling Xiao Palace that Lord’s territory?

The next moment.

Jian Wushuang asked in disbelief, “Lady Blue, you mean to say that your master is that Lord?”

“Hehe, you just thought of it?”

The beautiful woman winked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Jian Wushuang, you don’t have to call me Lady Blue. You can call me Bluey.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and cupped his hands, “Back then on the Ancient Path of Stars, miss Bluey had given me a few pointers.”

“You’re being too polite by saying thank you. Jian Wushuang, follow me into the high heaven society. My master will be out soon and he admires you.”

Bluey smiled at Jian Wushuang, then turned around and led Jian Wushuang across the white jade stone steps and into the main hall of towering Palace.

There were a total of seventy-eight tables in towering Palace’s main hall, and behind each table sat an expert who was at least a top Supreme.

As soon as Jian Wushuang walked in, countless eyes were fixed on him.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“Hmph, how hateful. I actually let this little thief escape with his life.”

“This little thief still dares to come to the universe myriad Clan Gathering. He really doesn’t know how to spell the word ‘death’.”

These gazes were extremely complicated. There was killing intent, hatred, and surprise.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened and he glanced at the seventy-eight tables.

Ha, there were quite a few familiar faces in this Hall.

...

Supreme Bing Ye from the Great Void Temple, God Emperor Scarlet Sun from the Scarlet Sun Divine Kingdom, Blood Sky Hall Master from the Blood Sky Hall, Long Qing from the Dragon race…

The six forces that had participated in killing him had all arrived!

Other than that, there were also some old acquaintances.

“Jian Wushuang, you didn’t let me down. I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

The one who spoke was a white-haired man with an indifferent face. He was the Ninth Kalpa King.

However, at this moment, the Ninth Kalpa King, who had always been unsmiling, had a slight smile on his face.

“Jian Wushuang, you’ve become stronger again.”

Jian Wushuang looked at him and replied with a smile, “You’ve also become stronger.”

In these hundreds of thousands of years, the Ninth Kalpa King had broken through to the middle-stage Supreme martial artist!

Back when the Ninth Kalpa King had just broken through to the Supreme level, he had been able to kill an advanced Supreme. He had even been only a step away from being a top Supreme. Now that he had broken through to the middle Supreme level, his strength had probably taken another leap.

For a perfect chaotic lifeform like the Ninth Kalpa King, it was fine if he didn’t break through. But once he broke through, his strength would soar much more than ordinary people!

...

“Jian Wushuang, how about we spar after the universe myriad Clan Gathering is over?”

The Ninth Kalpa King said.

“I also have the same intention.”

Jian Wushuang nodded at him.

“Alliance master! You’re awake?”

At this moment, a surprised voice was heard from the other side.

It was the Overlord.

There was an empty seat beside him. Bluey said, “Jian Wushuang, that’s where you are. Hurry up and go.”

Jian Wushuang nodded at Bluey and then strode toward the Overlord.
