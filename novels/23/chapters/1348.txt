Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The vicious man in a black robe had obviously underestimated how powerful Duan Lingfeng was.

Shoo!

Duan Lingfeng waved his sword, cutting half of the palm of the black-robe man. Then Duan Lingfeng continued his attack, intending to cut the man’s head.

“Damn it!”

The black-robed man quickly jumped away and avoided another attack after his palm was cut.

He looked at his wounded palm and frowned.

And Duan Lingfeng held his sword and stood in the heavens.

“Idiot!”

Duan Lingfeng, “You would die now if I recovered my full strength.”

The black-robed man felt nervous when hearing those words.

Jian Wushuang was also shocked by Duan Lingfeng’s power.

Jian Wushuang had heard about Duan Lingfeng’s incomparable power. If Duan Lingfeng could recover his full strength and totally unleash his soul power, he would be invincible among the Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

Now he had just sixty percent of his power.

But despite that, Duan Ling cut half of a palm of one man from Sky-devouring Clan. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The black-robed man said, “So…Before I eat Jian Wushuang, I had better clear all of the obstacles in the way.” He smirked and immediately recovered his palm, leaving no scars at all. Then after a second of simmering, his power skyrocketed and his figure enlarged and covered Duan Lingfeng.

But Duan Lingfeng was indifferent.

He strode forward.

“The seventh skill.”

Duan Lingfeng waved his sword again.

The sword attack was still done briefly and silently.

Bang!

But Duan Lingfeng was hit by the black-robed man’s power and he had to jump backwards.

The black-robed man laughed, “Your skills are just…mediocre. Nothing to me.”

After being attacked, the robed man kept focus and exercised his real power.

His one hundred percent power.

But Duan Lingfeng was still calm. His eyes sent out an appalling light.

“Come on!” Duan Lingfeng shouted.

“The eighth skill.”

Duan Lingfeng waved his sword again.

Another blood sword light.

The heavens darkened..

Two opponents rushed toward each other.

Bang!

The heavens blared again.

Their figures collided violently with each other and they both jumped backward.

Duan Lingfeng now felt a strong sense of excitement.

A feeling of aggressiveness rose with in his body.

“Not bad.” The black-robed man said.

“You are better than other Universe Gods in the Third Heaven that I have met.”

“So…take my next attack!”

“The ninth skill!”

Duan Lingfeng shouted resoundingly.

Then, within a second, Duan Lingfeng waved his sword again and accumulated an unimaginable power.

“Another one?” The black-robed man was shocked and he didn’t underestimate Duan Lingfeng anymore.

He felt that although Duan Lingfeng’s breath hadn’t recovered, he still had incomparable power.

And the last two attacks were more powerful than the previous ones.

Shoo!

Another blood light.

The whole heaven was silent.

A dead silence.

The black-robed man experienced a rising force within his body. His power and figure exploded, and he turned back into his original shape.

His original shape looked like a giant gorilla, scary and savage.

After turning into his frightful original shape, he rushed to Duan Lingfeng with all of his power.

Bang!

However, the black-robed man was hit back by the collision with Duan Lingfeng

Now the black-robed man was at a disadvantageous position.

But Duan Lingfeng was still standing stably in his original place.

“Wow!”

Looking at Duan Lingfeng, Jian Wushuang was impressed and even shocked.

King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang, “I have told you that Duan Lingfeng’s power is at a further level than you might imagine.”

“What level?” Jian Wushuang didn’t understand.

But he knew that he himself was still far from that level.

Bang!

The black-robed man got furious and impatient.

His original shape continued to grow, while his power and breath kept rising.

He generated an appalling evil spirit, creating an evil storm in the heavens.

Jian Wushuang felt more pressure from the black-robed man.

“The black-robed man is by no means an ordinary Sky-devouring Clan descendant. His secret skills are also powerful.”

King of Venomous Worms said, “Although Duan Lingfeng was powerful, he hasn’t recovered to his full strength and the black-robed man now has an edge over him in terms of soul power. Duan Lingfeng is also enduring the poison in his body. Jian Wushuang, you should give him a hand or he may be defeated.”

After hearing that, Jian Wushuang asked King of Venomous Worms, “The Sky-devouring Clan descendants aren’t good at consciousness attacks, right?”

“Yes. They accumulated power by eating Exotic Beasts instead of cultivating. As such, they are not so good at consciousness attacks.”

“However, the black-robed man is a Peak Universe God of the Third Heaven. Ordinary consciousness attacks are nothing to him. Jian Wushuang, though your soul power is more powerful than your peers at the same level, I don’t think it’s realistic for you to attack the black-robed man with a Soul Attack!”
