Chapter 2873: The Peak of the Third-Grade

——

An eighth-grade weapon refiner’s weapon-making skills were far superior to those of the previous top seventh-grade weapon refiners.

Mo Tao was also absolutely confident. It was indeed not difficult for him to refine a domain-type holy treasure now.

“However, it will take me some time to refine a domain-type holy treasure even if I do it myself. The conservative estimate is that it will take about three years. If you have nothing else to do, you can stay in my fire cloud castle for three years. I will ask Bi Yan to take good care of you. Three years later, I guarantee that I will deliver a powerful domain-type holy treasure to you,” Mo Tao said.

“In that case, I’ll have to trouble you, brother Mo,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“No worries.” Mo Tao waved his hand and said, “Disciple, please take good care of your friend.”

“Yes.” Bi Yan nodded respectfully and left with Jian Wushuang.

Meanwhile, Mo Tao had already started refining.

“Mr. Jian Yi, master has instructed you to let me know if you have any instructions during these three years.” Bi Yan was very polite.

“Haha, I don’t have any instructions. How about this, Mr. Bi Yan, please arrange a secret room for me. I have something to do and I want to go into closed-door cultivation. When brother Mo refines the treasure three years later, just let me know,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.”Bi Yan nodded.

Bi Yan immediately arranged a secret room for Jian Wushuang in fire cloud castle.

The secret room was completely sealed, and there were powerful restrictions around it. No one would disturb Jian Wushuang.

The reason why Jian Wushuang chose the secret room was naturally to refine the 500,000 holy pills he got from Young Master Qu and the others.

After he reached the rank of Great Divine Master, his speed of devouring and refining skyrocketed again. Three years should be enough for him to refine all 500,000 saint elixirs. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

By then, his divine power would be able to improve significantly.

Time passed.

Three years passed in a flash.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang had already refined all 500,000 saint elixirs. Now, he was relying on the two heaven-sealing scrolls to continue to comprehend the rules and his sword principle.

Whether it was his comprehension of sword principle or the rules, he had already reached the limit of Divine Master. One more step and he would be an Immortal Saint. However, it was very difficult to take this step.

Even a peerless genius like Jian Wushuang, with the help of the heaven-sealing scroll, would not be able to take this step easily.

However, as he comprehended, Jian Wushuang also found that his bottleneck in comprehending the sword principle and the space-time rules were somewhat loosened.

What he lacked now was an opportunity. As long as he had a slight opportunity, his comprehension of the sword principle and the space-time rules might be able to directly break through to the Immortal Saint-level, at that time, his battle strength would soar again.

“I can’t rush it. I have to take it slow,” Jian Wushuang muttered in his heart.

But at this moment… buzz!

A powerful treasure aura suddenly burst out from the depths of the Fire Cloud Castle.

This aura was very shocking. It was obviously a powerful holy treasure.

There was an immediate commotion in the Fire Cloud Castle. They also knew that it must be the Lord of the Fire Cloud Castle. Since Lord Mo had refined a very powerful holy treasure, Jian Wushuang was naturally alarmed.

“Is it done?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up and he immediately walked out of the secret room.

As soon as he walked out of the secret room, Jian Wushuang saw Bi Yan hurriedly running toward him.

“Mr. Jian Yi, my master sent a message, asking me to take you there immediately,” Bi Yan said.

“Well, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang immediately followed Bi Yan to the place where Mo Tao refined the holy treasure.

Once there, Jian Wushuang saw a special treasure floating in the void.

It was a scarlet compass that seemed to be completely condensed from blood.

The compass was engraved with complicated secret patterns and exotic beasts, which looked extremely mysterious.

The powerful aura of the treasure was emitted from the scarlet compass.

“Jian Yi, this is the treasure I refined for you. Refine it first, then test its power,” Mo Tao’s voice sounded.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and appeared in front of the Scarlet Compass. He immediately recognized it as his master.

The compass was obviously a holy treasure with extraordinary power. Jian Wushuang was only a great divine master. Normally, it would take a long time to refine such a treasure, but this was only for ordinary great divine masters, however, Jian Wushuang was different.

The process of refining the Scarlet Compass was very easy. In just a moment, he had completely controlled the compass.

“Let’s give it a try.”

There was a hint of expectation in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Immediately, a large amount of divine power was poured into the compass, and the Scarlet Compass immediately burst out with bursts of blood light.

Buzz! Buzz!

The bursts of blood light completely turned into a blood-red river and swept out in all directions. In an instant, the entire world was covered by the blood-red river.

The blood-red river was vast and powerful. It moved people’s minds and occupied everything in the world.

The entire world became completely blood-red.

“It’s not easy to activate a domain-type holy treasure. It consumes a lot of divine power, but it’s nothing to me. The power of this holy treasure…” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. The blood-red river that occupied everything in the world… it immediately burst out with terrifying power and began to press down in one direction.

The terrifying pressure was applied to the void. It seemed that the void could not withstand the pressure and was about to explode completely.

“This power… although it doesn’t really affect the body of the cultivator and can not be fully manifested, I can feel that the pressure of the blood-red river’s domain is definitely dozens of times, or even nearly a hundred times stronger than the golden light domain used by the golden feather illusionary light mirror!” Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked.

“Jian Yi, try to drive the blood river domain toward me,” Mo Tao said.

“Brother Mo, you have to be careful.” Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately urged the blood river to crazily press toward Mo Tao.

Under the crazy pressure of the blood river, even a genuine Immortal Saint like Mo Tao was slightly shocked, but a smile appeared on his face.

“That’s enough,” Mo Tao said.

Jian Wushuang immediately put away the blood river domain.

“Brother Mo, how do you feel?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s really powerful. I once refined domain-type holy treasures and refined three of them, but they were only at the third-grade ordinary level. But now, after I became an eighth-grade weapon refiner, the compass I refined should have reached the peak of the third-grade!” Mo Tao said.
