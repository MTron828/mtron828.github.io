Chapter 1782: Descend, Snow Kingdom!

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s compliment, He Xiu clenched his hand but didn’t get carried away.

He knew his master’s capability. In terms of the improvement that he had made over the years, he was naturally much better than an ordinary genius. However, if he were to compare himself with his master, he was far behind. They were not at the same level at all.

He Xiu had always treated his master as his goal.

In the hall, Jian Wushuang looked down at He Xiu and Qiu Yue.

“Today, I called the two of you over to inform you that I will make a trip back to my hometown for a while. As for how long, I have no idea. So, I am giving you two a choice, if you are willing, you may head back with me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I am your maidservant. Wherever mister goes, I will naturally follow,” Qiu Yue replied without hesitation.

As for He Xiu, he kept quiet for a while then he nodded heavily, “I am willing to follow master anywhere.”

Then, Jian Wushuang smiled.

Actually he could’ve returned to his hometown alone, but it was inevitable that he would run into some trouble along the way. Because of his identity, he naturally couldn’t just take action hastily. Hence, it’d be best if one or two persons of the highest position followed him. Qiu Yue was his maidservant and He Xiu was his disciple. They could be said to be the two closest people to him. Jian Wushuang, of course, chose to bring the two of them.

“If so, let’s depart now.”

On that day itself, Jian Wushuang left Star Land. He took his ancient spaceship and traveled to the direction of his hometown, Green Fire World.

Back when Jian Wushuang had come to the ten sanctuaries from Green Fire World, he had spent a total of a few thousand years there. Along the way, he had come across countless hardships and he nearly died a few times.

Then… the threats and dangerous places along the way were almost non-existent before an expert with fighting power of an Emperor God.

The spaceship that Jian Wushuang was on constantly traveled at a terrifying speed.

In less than a hundred years’ time, he arrived at Snow Kingdom.

…

Snow Kingdom was the first Holy Kingdom that Jian Wushuang had stepped foot on after arriving in Eternal Chaotic World.

The Holy Kingdom was much further from the ten sanctuaries in the core of Eternal Chaotic World. It was located in a remote area. Hence, the experts weren’t as many as in the Holy Kingdoms closer to the sanctuaries.

The Holy Kingdoms closer to the ten sanctuaries, such as Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu and Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom, had dozens or even hundreds of Real Gods.

However, there were only over ten Real Gods in Holy Kingdom. As for the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom, he was only an ordinary Chaotic Real God. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

There were two places in Snow Kingdom where they nurtured geniuses. One was Universe God Palace and the other was Snow Dojo.

At first, the two genius campsites in Snow Kingdom were evenly matched. However, there had been some changes in recent years.

In a lofty palace in Snow Dojo.

Over ten Golden Deacons of Snow Dojo gathered there and they were standing in groups of two to three as they chattered. It could be seen that the faces of the Golden Deacons weren’t great.

“Lost. Snow Dojo lost the ranking battle again. Like the previous term, all three ranking battles were won by Universe God Palace!”

“Sigh. We were defeated so badly. I reckon the outside world sees Snow Dojo as a laughing stock now.”

“No choice. We have lost four terms continuously and we lost all three battles for four terms. It is a crushing defeat. We are both genius campsites of Snow Kingdom but Universe God Palace suppressed us Snow Dojo so badly.”

“All these years, the geniuses and experts that Snow Dojo raised were far behind Universe God Palace. The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom is already unhappy with us. For the ten ranking battle that took place in the past one hundred thousand years, Snow Dojo only won once and it was won with the assistance of a genius that we invited at the last moment. The genius wasn’t brought up by Snow Dojo. With such achievements, how do we face the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom?”

The ranking battle between Snow Dojo and Universe God Palace only happened every once in ten thousand years.

In the ranking battles for the past few years, Snow Dojo had suffered crushing defeat.

Then, there was suddenly a figure that substantiated at the uppermost throne in the hall. The moment the person appeared, his Real God aura spread across.

Everyone in the hall immediately stood in humble reverence. Looking at the cold looking man who was raging in anger, everyone kept quiet.

“Rubbish, a bunch of rubbish!” Master of Silence Gloriette cursed angrily.

“For four terms of ranking battle continuously, every term has three battles. There are a total of twelve battles and you lost all twelve?!”

“You could’ve just won one!!!”

“With such battle achievement, how will we of Snow Dojo be worthy of all the resources provided by the Monarch?”

Master of Silence Gloriette reprimanded and the Golden Deacons below lowered their heads in embarrassment.

Looking at how the Golden Deacons behaved, the Master of Silence Gloriette got even more furious, “Listen up, the Monarch already said that he will give us another chance. If Snow Dojo were to lose the next ranking battle again, it wouldn’t be necessary for us to exist.”

The moment he said that, the Golden Deacons were shocked.

Not necessary for us to exist?

Does it mean that they are going to close down Snow Dojo?

In the future, Snow Kingdom will only have Universe God Palace?

“How can it be?” There’s someone who exclaimed.

“Why? Now you’re panicking? What did you do then?” Master of Silence Gloriette glared at the Golden Deacons under him. Then, he sighed. “Forget it. The genius disciples in Snow Dojo are failing and that has to do with me too. It’s hard for me to absolve myself from the blame. Now, I won’t force you, but let me clarify this, if you want Snow Dojo to continue to exist, please give your all for the next ten thousand years. Regardless of the method, you must nurture disciples who are more outstanding than Universe God Palace!”

“Yes,” the Golden Deacons nodded heavily.

Very soon, everyone was dismissed.

There was only Master of Silence Gloriette left on the throne alone and he sighed.

Then, in Snow Kingdom, outside Snow Sacred World, there was an ancient spaceship that was moving over slowly.

There were three figures in the spaceship cabin.

“Mister, according to Star Map that I have, in front should be where Snow Kingdom is located. Is Mister’s hometown here?” Qiu Yue asked.

“No,” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “My hometown is in a small Eternal World but not this Holy Kingdom. The reason why I came here was to see some old friends.”

Jian Wushuang had stayed in Snow Sacred Land for a while. He had even joined Snow Dojo and he still carried the identity of a disciple of Snow Dojo.
