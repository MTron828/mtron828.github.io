Chapter 2863: Past Life and Present Life

——

In the void, Chi Ming had completely stopped. Jian Wushuang floated past him and continued toward Leng Rushuang.

Finally, he arrived in front of Leng Rushuang. When he was less than 10 meters away, he finally stopped.

Then he slowly reached out and took out a jade slip.

He looked at Leng Rushuang with deep affection and threw the jade slip to her.

Leng Rushuang hesitated for a moment, then took the jade slip and began to read it with her consciousness.

There was only one paragraph in the jade slip.

“In my previous life, I chased you for 100,000 years. My heart was broken, and I missed you. I entered the reincarnation with you

“In this life, I promise you 100 million years, and we will be together until death. When we meet today, you will be my companion.”

“Jian… Wushuang!”

Leng Rushuang moved for a moment and then looked up at Jian Wushuang.

But she found that Jian Wushuang had already turned around and left.

Leng Rushuang could only look at Jian Wushuang’s back and mutter to herself.

“Jian Wushuang, is this his name?”

“Why does this name feel so familiar to me?”

“In my previous life, in this life… who is he?”

Leng Rushuang was also puzzled. She shook her head after a long while.

“Let’s go,” Leng Rushuang said. Then she returned to her residence with many female disciples.

Until Leng Rushuang completely disappeared from everyone’s sight, the people on the martial arts practice field were in an uproar.

In the center of the training grounds, the few undying saints had been quietly watching this scene. They did not express any opinions, but now, they were all laughing and chatting.

“Haha, as expected of the Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. There really are quite a few suitors.”

“Yeah, the Young Master of the Heavenly Melody Realmlord and the Young Pavilion Master of the Star Pavilion aren’t ordinary people. There’s also that little fellow who appeared at the end. He seems to be quite extraordinary as well.”

“He is indeed extraordinary. Everyone should have noticed that in that instant, right?”

The several Immortal Saints exchanged glances and nodded.

“Sword intent. An extremely sharp sword intent that contains boundless killing intent!!”

“This sword intent isn’t too strong. Logically speaking, Chi Ming should be the young pavilion master of the Star Pavilion and his strength should be infinitely close to that of an Invincible Divine Master. This sword intent shouldn’t be able to do anything to him. But in the end, he was so frightened by that sword intent that he couldn’t even speak.”

“Haha, the sword essence is only secondary. The key is the overwhelming killing intent contained in the sword essence. If I didn’t guess, the little guy should be a real killing God. Although he looks young, he has killed many cultivators in his life. Only the terrifying killing intent condensed under the overwhelming killing and the sword essence released at the same time can shock Chi Ming. This little guy is not simple.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Immortal Saints were all talking about Jian Wushuang.

“By the way, do you know that little guy?” Long Xingzi, the Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, asked with a smile.

“No.”

“There are many experts in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, but not many can have such powerful sword essence and killing intent like this little guy. He’s only a Peak Divine Master… I’ve thought about it, but he’s not one of them.”

“It seems that he is a reclusive expert or someone who has just risen. We haven’t heard of him yet.”

None of the Immortal Saints present recognized Jian Wushuang.

On the martial arts practice field, a few people recognized Jian Wushuang, but they did not hear about it.

“Since you don’t know him, then forget it.” Long Xingzi waved his hand. “Thank you all for gracing us with your presence today, but the viewing ceremony has already ended. If you have nothing else to do, you can drink a few times more in my Dragon-phoenix Pavilion before leaving. If you have something to do, you can leave first.”

As Leng Rushuang left, the viewing ceremony had already ended.

Many experts in the martial arts practice field also began to leave.

In a corner of the martial arts practice field…

“Senior brother Chu Shi, that sword one seems to have left. Should we immediately chase after him?” Demoness Gu asked.

“There’s no need.” Chu Shi shook his head, “Junior sister Gu, your strength is still too weak. Perhaps you still don’t understand, but I saw it very clearly. Although Sword One didn’t make a move in that instant, he was at an absolute advantage in the confrontation with Chi Ming. Chi Ming was even completely intimidated by him.”

“Chi Ming is the Young Master of the Star Point Pavilion. Even he is no match for Sword One, so I’m no match for him. It seems that I was a bit rash to challenge him.”

“Sword One is so powerful?” Demoness Gu was rather surprised but more shocked.

The last time they met, Jian Wushuang’s cultivation was only at the Peak Earth Divine Master level, and his battle strength was only at the Divine Master level.

However, it had only been a short while, and Jian Wushuang’s strength was already so strong that he could not even deal with Chu Shi, who was at the peak of the Great Divine Master Level?

In another corner.

“Qu Hong, are you disappointed that Miss Leng Er did not take your phoenix silver snow garment?” Chi Ming appeared in front of Young Master Qu and mocked.

“Humph, didn’t Miss Leng Er also not take your Netherworld Fire Phoenix? What are you so proud of?” Young Master Qu said coldly.

“That’s right. Miss Leng Er didn’t accept the gifts that the two of us had meticulously prepared. She didn’t even take a look at them. On the contrary, that person who appeared out of nowhere actually caused Miss Leng Er’s expression to change. Miss Leng Er even took the initiative to ask for the other party’s name. Hehe, Young Master Qu, it seems that both of us have no hope.” Chi Ming said self-mockingly.

“There’s no hope?” Young Master Qu’s expression changed.

“Forget it, let’s not talk about it.” Chi Ming waved his hand and left.

Young Master Qu still stood there, but his expression had already become extremely gloomy.

“Black Blood Emperor, I told you to keep an eye on sword one. How is it now?” Young Master Qu asked.

“Young master, I’ve already sent someone to follow.” Black Blood Emperor said.

“That’s good.” Young Master Qu’s gaze was extremely cold. “Sword One… previously in Fire Cloud Castle, after me, only Sword One came to pay a visit to Lord Mo. The Sword Dao Treasure that Lord Mo used the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine is very likely to have been refined for Sword One. And now, sword one has actually come to Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to compete with me for the fledgling Phoenix!”

“Humph, he’s just a Peak Divine Master. How dare he try to get his hands on a Young Phoenix? If I don’t remove all his claws, I won’t be called Master Qu!”

“Black Blood Emperor, let’s go and find Sword One!” Master Qu shouted.

“Yes.” Black Blood Emperor nodded.

Immediately, Master Qu led his Invincible Divine Master, Black Blood Emperor, and several peak divine masters to chase after Jian Wushuang.
