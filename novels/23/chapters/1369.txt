Chapter 1370: Too Weak!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Not any cultivator fighting a fierce battle but a disciple of the Lineage of Star is catching a Meta beast?”

“That, that is a disciple of the Lineage of Star?”

The black-haired man and the lady in a gold robe looked at the Milky Way before them, they saw Jian Wushuang, who was fighting ferociously with the Meta beast. They also felt the existence of the token that signified his identity as a disciple of Star Palace on Jian Wushuang.

“See the aura of the token, he is really a disciple of Star Palace. But why is he so weak?” The black-haired man creased his eyebrows and said.

Weak!

Too weak!

At least from what they saw, Jian Wushuang was merely showing the fighting power of an ordinary Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven. But in the place where geniuses gathered, like Lineage of Star, any ordinary disciple who was a Universe God in the Second Heaven would be much stronger than Jian Wushuang.

“Would it be that he didn’t give his all?” The lady in gold robe thought.

“Maybe,” the black-haired man nodded too. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

They could only think that Jian Wushaung hadn’t given his all.

Otherwise, a disciple of Star Palace who was a Universe God in the Second Heaven who couldn’t even fight a three-meter Meta beast would definitely be a joke if the story spread.

But they didn’t know that Jian Wushuang didn’t hide his power but he really couldn’t do anything to the Meta beast.

He had already performed various measures. He even used Sword Principle with Blood Mountain Sword and also Soul Attack, but it didn’t cause any damage to the Meta beast.

“The Meta beast is born by the Milky Way. They are extremely intelligent and their consciousness is related to the surrounding Milk Way. My Soul Attack has nothing to do with it. Relying on my swordsmanship alone, I could barely suppress it. If I wanted to extract its meta strength alive, it would be impossible,” Jian Wushuang quickly understood and he didn’t waste any more time. He stopped and let the Meta beast leave.

“A three meter tall Meta beast, I’m afraid I can’t do anything to it now. I could only go look for smaller Meta beast.”

Jian Wushuang sighed and then continued to search at the surrounding Milky Way.

Jian Wushuang noticed the black-haired man and the lady in the gold robe afar with his Soul Power but he was unconcerned.

“Junior, did you see that?” The black-haired man creased his eyebrows slightly.

“Mm,” the lady in gold robe nodded solemnly, “He looked at the Meta beast escape from his hand. Was he really unable to do anything with the Meta beast?”

“The earlier sight, did you record it?” The black-haired man asked.

“Yes,” the lady in the gold robe said.

“Great, let’s return. I’d like to see what’s up with this disciple of Star Palace,” the black-haired man said.

“Alright, we are almost done with catching the Meta beast anyway,” the lady in the gold robe agreed.

Then, they returned to the old lair in the Lineage of Star.

On the training field that was formed within the nebula, a few figures were gathered. The few of them were all ordinary disciples in Lineage of Star. One of them was obviously stronger by one notch compared to the rest.

“Luo Quan!”

The black-haired man and the lady in the gold robe appeared on the training field after returning from the Milky Way.

“Didn’t you two go to catch a Meta beast? Why did you return so soon?” The disciple with the strongest aura on the training field, Luo Quan, wore a malicious smile.

“We originally wanted to catch a few more Meta beasts but we run into something interesting on the way,” the black-haired man said.

“Oh? What is it? Tell me,” Luo Quan smiled and asked.

“Don’t panic. Let me ask you first. Is there a recent new disciple of Lineage of Star?” The black-haired man asked.

“Yes,” Luo Quan nodded, “Not long ago, Mister Lei Chao brought a disciple of Lineage of Star back personally. The disciple of Lineage of Star is like us. He’s also a Universe God in the Second Heaven. As for his name, I think he’s called Jian Wushuang.”

“Exactly then. We ran into him in the Milky Way earlier and he happened to be catching Meta beasts,” the black-haired man said.

“He just got to Lineage of Star. He knew the Meta beast was useful. If he wanted to catch a few for cultivation, there is no big deal,” Luo Quan creased his eyebrows and said.

“If so, of course, there’s no big deal. However…” The black-haired man smirked and looked at the lady in gold robe, “Junior, take it out.”

“Mm,” the lady in gold robe nodded and then took out a token. She allocated her consciousness and the recorded image in the token was played before every one of them.

“A mirror image?” Luo Quan and the others were shocked but they looked anyway.

In a short time, Luo Quan and the others who watched the recorded image looked puzzled.

“How is that possible?”

“A disciple of Lineage of Star who was a Universe God in the Second Heaven couldn’t do anything to a three meter tall Meta beast. Isn’t this ridiculous?”

“Jian Wushuang, didn’t he hide his ability?”

The few disciples on training field gasped.

From what they saw, the power that Jian Wushuang showed during his fight with the Meta beast was really too weak.

Luo Quan squinted his eyes and looked at the black-haired man and the lady in the gold robe, “Are you sure that he used all of his power?”

The black-haired man shook his head, “We only saw him fighting with the Meta beast but we couldn’t tell if he gave his all. However, if he wanted to catch Meta beast, he can’t just let a three meter high Meta beast leave before his eyes, right?”

Just then…

“Everyone, what are you doing here?” A figure walked over. He happened to be the disciple that had brought Jian Wushuang around earlier, Qu Yang.

“Qu Yang, you came just in time. Quick, come and take a look at the image,” the black-haired man pulled Qu Yang over to watch the image.

Qu Yang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted after he watched.

“Would Jian Wushuang really be so weak?” Qu Yang muttered.

“Qu Yang, you meant really weak? Did you suspect his power before this?” The black-haired man said.

“To be frank, I brought Jian Wushuang to Star Tower once. But Jian Wushuang flew out almost instantly. He didn’t even pass through the first floor of Star Tower. Plus, when I ask if he was too careless and didn’t put his all to play, he said that he gave his all and he really couldn’t pass through the first level,” Qu Yang said.

“He didn’t even pass the first floor of Star Tower?”

All the disciples at the scene were shocked.

Sixth floor in Star Tower, one floor was more difficult than the other. But the first floor was the easiest.

Even they managed to pass through the first floor.

“It seems that we didn’t guess wrong. Jian Wushuang who just came to Lineage of Star was really weak but he became a disciple of Star Palace – a role that all of us desired?” The black-haired man’s eyes became fiery red as he spoke.
