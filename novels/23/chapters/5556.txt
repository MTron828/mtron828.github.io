Chapter 5555 ¬†Giant God Clan

The visitor from the Starry Sky was undoubtedly impressive, possessing formidable strength much like Jian Wushuang.

However, beneath the surface, there were questionable motives that instilled fear.

There was a genuine apprehension that Xuan Yi's prophecy might come true, and the Qishen Temple would unwittingly pave the way for someone else.

The entire existence of the Qishen Temple was at risk of being erased from the timeline‚Äîa bitter prospect.

Zhen Ling, an integral part of Qishen, belonged to the Qishen Temple by birthright. The situation was far from satisfying.

"Sigh."

Exhaustion set in.

The plan had been meticulously crafted, but its execution proved immensely challenging.

Everyone, including Zhen Ling, struggled in the relentless pursuit.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was essentially gambling with his own life, having never considered that Shen Ling could be sent to end him.

Following the Emperors, they entered a concealed space.

"How many are yet to arrive?" inquired the supremely skilled individual who had earlier clashed with Emperor Lu Hua.

"Elder Shadow Two has fallen. Only Kui One remains within the mine, disrupting the restrictions. Once the restrictions are breached, we can instantly depart!"

Elder Shadow One turned to glance at Jian Wushuang, expressing satisfaction at the relatively smooth progress.

Those who dared to venture here did not harbor hopes of leaving alive.

"Can't wait any longer, go directly to find Kui One, break the prohibition and leave directly. Lu Hua's strength is too strong; he can sweep us away in no time!" There was a hint of worry in Shadow One's eyes.

Indeed, the strength of Emperor Lu Hua was not just hearsay.

He had reached the pinnacle of the spatial realm, almost reaching the level of the universe, only lacking a secret technique.

Once the secret technique was mastered, he would possess the strength of those Divine Generals under the command of Qishen back in the day.

This time, several Divine generals did not appear, and these people were considered lucky.

If the Divine General Moyin or Lord Yun Zhong had descended, they could instantly annihilate them all.

They were all Ultimate Emperors, and they had elevated the spatial realm to the level of the universe, each possessing their own peak secret technique.

Moreover, all were masters of secret techniques.

The Divine Generals could rival the Half-Step Universe Masters.

Otherwise, Zhen Ling wouldn't have allowed Divine General Moyin and Lord Yun Zhong to guard the Elder Palace.

Buzz!

The space hidden in the darkness seemed completely separated from this place. Outsiders couldn't enter at all, even Emperor Lu Hua couldn't detect it.

Outside.

Emperor Lu Hua frowned and casually swept away those mysterious emperors.

The mysterious pinnacle expert he had just fought had disappeared, and no matter how he searched, he couldn't find him.

Then, he activated the array and found that Jian Wushuang had also disappeared.

"Jian Wushuang, it's better if all this is fake, or else you've dug yourself into a pit!" Emperor Lu Hua began to regret.

He had a part to play in releasing Jian Wushuang.

That was unavoidable.

At that time, it wasn't just the position of the Palace Lord that couldn't be maintained; it was feared that even life itself would be lost.

Looking back now on the words spoken to Wu Zuo, he had no face to turn back; there was only one path to follow.

Buzz!

At the entrance of the Qiankun Cave.

The restrictions were being worn away.

The restrictions here were so formidable that even supreme-peak experts couldn't break them. Breaking them required special means, and Shen Ling was well-prepared.

Relying solely on a few supreme-peak experts was almost impossible.

When these restrictions were created, they were designed to protect the top experts among the supreme-peak.

Even if the 18 Divine Generals gathered, they couldn't shatter it.

But Shen Ling had a solution.

Breaking the restrictions was Kui One.

The Grand Commander of the Kui Organization in the Earthly Realm.

His identity was extremely mysterious. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

Speaking of it, Jian Wushuang had once fought against him.

On the border of the Moluo Nation, he had experienced the opponent's methods.

Kui One was none other than the Elder Grandmaster of the Moluo.

When he was madly expanding back then, it was for this day.

Once he left, Moluo would perish without anyone to shelter it!

Fortunately, he made all the necessary preparations and left many contingencies before departing.

Even if he fell this time, there was no need to worry.

He activated a series of imprints in his hands, forming a terrifying scroll. On that scroll, there was a blood-red totem.

Shen Ling had informed him that once the totem was activated, it could break through All Things.

Because this was the totem of the Giant God Clan.

Giant God Clan!

Shen Ling was nothing more than an ordinary member of the Giant God Clan.

Fuego and the colossal egg in the Origin Source were both of the Giant God Clan.

In the Starry Sky, they were one of the most powerful clans.

At birth, they stood at the pinnacle of the universe, capable of ruling over a river of time and space in the Grand Mahayana stage.

In the vast expanse of the Starry Sky, with just over a hundred rivers of time and space, there were only dozens of formidable individuals within the Giant God Clan who could control one. More than half of them could command a river of time and space.

Such was the might of this formidable force.

When Qishen reached its peak, it only controlled one river of time and space before eventually falling.

The Giant God Clan, on the other hand, controlled dozens.

It was no wonder that with just one Fuego, they could annihilate the Three Kings.

Various figures flashed on the totem, each one a super powerhouse from the Giant God Clan. At this moment, the prohibitions began to shatter.

Hum!

A shout from the Starry Sky instantly descended.

Once again, from the Starry Sky.

Fortunately, it was only a voice, but its power was no weaker than that of the earlier sword strike.

The sword was pure slaughter, killing all living beings.

This shout, however, contained the essence of All Things, directly shattering the prohibitions.

Prohibitions shattered!

Kui One was very excited and quickly transmitted the message to Shadow One.

Swish!

The space descended!

"Go!"

Everything went unexpectedly smoothly.

In less than a quarter of an hour, they subdued Jian Wushuang, broke the prohibitions, and escaped.

Buzz, in the mysterious space, a glow began to emerge‚Äîit was a teleportation array.

Jian Wushuang stood among these people, watching with astonishment!

The power contained in this teleportation array was much stronger than the strongest one he had seen in the White Tiger Temple.

In the temple, the strongest teleportation array was for inter-realm travel.

However, the power emanating from above was not even one-tenth as strong as this teleportation array.

Where was it going to teleport him?

Jian Wushuang was amazed in his heart.

Leaving the Qishen Temple?

Swish!

When Lu Hua noticed that power, the teleportation array had already activated, and all the Emperors in the mysterious space disappeared.

At this moment, just a quarter of an hour later.

Deputy Hall Master Zhong and Wu Shan arrived.

Seeing the devastated mine and the desolate figure of Lu Hua, everything became clear.

"Where is Jian Wushuang?" Deputy Hall Master Zhong asked anxiously.

He had always felt that this matter must be related to Jian Wushuang.

Emperor Lu Hua couldn't be bothered to deal with him and directly left the place.

There was no need for him to clean up the mess.

This time, the losses were not significant.

But the reputation was tarnished.

The Space Fire Abyssal Mountain was split into two, and the restrictions were shattered.

As for those who fell, they were not much of a concern.

This was just one of the many mines on the mountain.

However, the strong from the Elder Palace also suffered losses.

Although most of them were indigenous Emperors, there were also some tier 6 Emperors who fell.

The Inheritors arrived last, only picking up the tail, naturally suffering no losses.

"Gong Miaoyi!" Deputy Hall Master Zhong stood where Jian Wushuang and others had fought before, staring at Gong Miaoyi on the ground.

They could do nothing about Jian Wushuang's swift departure. However, since Gong Miaoyi was left behind, not all was futile.

"Take her away, escort her to the prison at Yuanyang Lake. I want to interrogate her personally!"
