Chapter 1116: Chaos!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Life Elixir was what these experts from both the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom had been wantonly searching this area for all these years.

They had amassed a considerable amount of Life Medicine pellets after more than ten years of searching.

Thus, if what they saw inside the Loyalty Palace was several or even dozens of Life Medicine pellets, they wouldn’t show such a reaction.

The fact was that there were more than hundreds of Life Elixir inside!

The number of Life Elixirs inside was enough to produce hundreds of Celestial Masters! To think that they would appear all at the same time.

The gazes of the experts on both camps turned heated. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“If the Green Fire Palace obtains all those Life Medicine pellets, we can increase our strength significantly!” Celestial Master Yi’s gaze turned burning hot.

“One Life Medicine pellet is equivalent to 10,000 Fire Points. That means there are millions of Fire Points inside,” Celestial Master Meng Long said, licking his lips.

“We must try our best to take them all,” Celestial Master Jin Qu said passionately.

Jian Wushuang stood outside the layer of Restriction, observing everyone—including the three Celestial Masters with him—with a grave expression.

Suddenly, the hundreds of Life Medicine pellets hovering quietly inside the Loyalty Palace turned into flowing lights that projected in all directions. It was as if an unknown force had triggered their change.

The pellets shot out at the same time at a high speed, penetrating the layer of Restriction and appearing directly in front of the experts outside. Their hearts thumped violently when they saw this sight.

In a split second…

“Grab them!”

“Hurry up and grab them!”

“Oh God, there are so many Life Elixirs!”

“They’re mine! They’re all mine!”

The entire world erupted into chaos.

Mad!

Both camps had gone truly mad.

There was an outbreak of strong and ferocious Celestial Master’s auras as they took out their own magic weapons and joined the fight.

Celestial Masters Yi, Meng Long, and Jin Qu became frenzied as well.

“Be careful, you three!”

Jian Wushuang warned them. The Blood Mountain Sword was already in his hand as he eyed the two pellets of Life Medicine closest to him. In the next second, he dashed forward like an eagle swooping in from the sky above and arrived in front of the pellets.

There were two Jin Kingdom experts who had their eyes on the same pellets as well.

One was an advanced-level Celestial Master, while the other was a medium-level Celestial Master.

“Eternal Realm aura? He’s Jian Wushuang!”

The two Jin Kingdom experts recognized Jian Wushuang at once.

“Hmph! So what if your strength rivals Qu Yang’s? The two of us still killed him anyway!” the cold, severe-looking young man with a fire cloud pattern between his brows shouted.

“Well said!” The girl with bluish-green hair nodded heavily.

The three of them had appeared in front of the two pellets of Life Elixir at the same time.

The cold, severe-looking young man held a large and malevolent scarlet scythe. Bloody clouds surged in his body as he emanated a boundless and bloody aura. The fire cloud pattern between his brows radiated a dazzling light. He threw his scarlet scythe with a swing swift of his right hand. The sickle streaked the Void as if it had traveled through a long, endless river of blood.

The sickle arrived in front of Jian Wushuang in no time.

“Scram!”

Jian Wushuang roared, feeling the Ancient God Power pour into his body and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand breaking out with overwhelming might. He thrust his sword.

This strong thrust carried the might of no less than three Sword Principles of Creation Level. It abruptly burst in power under the support of the Blood-killing Plate Armor.

“Clang!”

The sound of collision resounded loudly.

The long, endless river of blood immediately dispersed. The powerful collision also flung the scarlet scythe, directly impaling the cold and severe-looking young man.

“Pfft!”

Blood sprayed from the young man’s mouth and his expression immediately turned deathly pale.

Just then, a strange sword shadow appeared behind Jian Wushuang out of the blue.

The icy-cold sword light carried a ravaging aura as if it was a spirit serpent sliding through the Void. It flew toward Jian Wushuang in a bid to pierce his skull.

“You’re seeking death!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted when he detected the cold gale blowing behind him. Without even bothering to glance at what was behind him, he swung his sword in a casual manner.

“Buzz!” The moment a faint sword echo reverberated, the girl with bluish-green hair who used a strange swordsmanship to ambush Jian Wushuang had already encountered a terrifying consciousness attack. The girl was merely a medium-level Celestial Master with a fairly weak consciousness. She immediately sank into a state of muddleheadedness.

Jian Wushuang’s beautiful and shrill sword killed her without the least bit of resistance!

“What?”

“He’s that strong?”

The young man who was heavily injured after being flung away by the collision was deeply shocked.

Jian Wushuang had severely hurt him with a single sword strike and then casually killed another medium-level Celestial Master with another sword strike.

This sort of strength was clearly one realm beyond a typical advanced-level Celestial Master.

After killing the girl with bluish-green hair, Jian Wushuang grabbed the two pellets of Life Elixir as well as the girl’s Interspatial Ring. He then rested his cold gaze on the young man.

“You’re going to die as well!”

His killing intent surged high into the sky. He arrived in front of the young man with a single step and violently thrust his Blood Mountain Sword.

“Bladed Surge!”

He unleashed his terrifying killing move that contained secret strength.

“Oh no!”

The expression of the cold and severe-looking young man changed drastically. He brandished his blood-red sickle to try and block Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“Clang!”

Yet came another loud collision. Jian Wushuang struck the young man so hard that the latter sank. The young man felt his arm numbing but before he could do anything about it, the second layer of power hidden in the Bladed Surge exploded.

The second layer of power hit the wide-eyed young man with basically zero resistance. Disbelief colored the young man’s eyes as he breathed his last.

With a swing of Jian Wushuang’s large hand, he grabbed the young man’s Interspatial Ring as well.

Though it felt like some time had passed, he took less than the time it took for him to take a single breath.

Yet, in that short span of time, an advanced-level and a medium-level Celestial Master of the Jin Kingdom died in his hands.
