Chapter 5544 ¬†Iron Blood Suppression

That was a serious crime. Not only would all those who were related to the culprit be executed, but their Origin Source would also be thrown into the Eternal Fire Prison and tortured for the rest of his life.

That feeling could be said to be extremely terrifying.

Only this kind of iron-blooded method could suppress those who had designs on the mine.

When the Divine Hall controlled the Northern Territory, the management here was even stricter.

The core members of the White Tiger Temple were all puppets, and they wouldn't fill their own pockets. The people below didn't even dare to be greedy. They could only get some benefits when the Elder Palace was in control of this place.

The ones in charge of the mine were the two halls of the Elder Palace.

They were Longevity Hall, which collected ores, and Mountain Suppression Hall, which was responsible for mining.

Not only were they responsible for mining, but they were also responsible for guarding.

Although there wouldn't be a fool who would dare to rush over to snatch the ore mine, for safety reasons, there were still several tier 6 Emperors guarding it.

Moreover, there were avatars of the three Palace Masters on the three great mines, and each of them had a supreme combat strength avatar guarding them.

If anything happened, there was a special teleportation array that could allow the true body to descend at any time.

It was very safe.

Space Fire Abyssal Stone was no ordinary ore.

It was too big, so it couldn't be stored in ordinary mustard seeds. It could only be placed in some containers that stored true treasures.

Furthermore, they couldn't be teleported through the teleportation array. Every escort required a Palace Master to personally escort them.

It was transported almost every 100,000 years.

Jian Wushuang roughly calculated how many cubic units would be mined in 100,000 years.

A few million cubic units of Space Fire Abyssal Stones at once, its value probably exceeded 100,000 cubic universe crystals.

A supreme treasure of such value would definitely require a supreme expert to personally escort it.

The value of 100,000 cubic universe crystals, and if they were sold in batches, the value might be even higher. Even the supreme-peak warriors among the natives would find it worthy of the risk.

The person who escorted the Space Fire Abyssal Stone this time was Tie San's brother, Chang¬†Feng Sword God, one of the three Palace Masters.

His position was extremely high, and although his strength was ranked at the bottom of the three Palace Masters, the universe secret technique he created was already at the initial level. His strength could not be underestimated, and few of the natives of the four secret realms could match him.

It's likely the other party had already left by now.

Jian Wushuang had nothing to worry about. The avatars of those supreme-peaks were on the mountain top, unlikely to pay attention to a tier 4 Emperor like him.

Gong Miaoyi and Jian Wushuang followed the team and entered the mine.

Outside the cave, four teams of experts patrolled the area day and night. Four tier 6 Emperors led dozens of peak-level tier 5 Emperors. Even the native experts of Hanzhou combined would not be able to break through such a formation.

Even if the experts from the Shadow Sect wanted to infiltrate, they would likely be discovered by the Law Enforcement Hall before reaching Hanzhou.

"Black Aura, these are your mining tools, and this bag. Put all the mined Space Fire Abyssal Stones into it, and it will automatically record the minerals you've extracted. Your goal is 10 cubic units. Once you have enough quantity, you can leave!"

ian Wushuang nodded without saying much, holding a straight stick-shaped treasure and a small bag, he entered the mine.

The days ahead would all be spent here.

To leave, he needed to mine enough Space Fire Abyssal Stones.

The wanted notice sent by the Law Enforcement Hall stated that he needed to mine 10 cubic units of Space Fire Abyssal Stones to lift the warrant.

This was even after Jian Wushuang had given up the mining reward.

If he wanted that reward, he would need 15 cubic units' worth of Space Fire Abyssal Stones.

He naturally didn't care much about that reward; he came here primarily to rescue Nie Yuan.

Through Wu Zuo's manipulation in the background, the two arrived at the mine where Nie Yuan was.

Rescuing people was just part of the plan.

He wasn't in a situation where he had no choice but to rescue. If the Shadow Sect's people found him now and wanted to take him to see Fueygo, he would refuse and go with them.

Unfortunately, even after such a long time, he had left many clues but still hadn't encountered the Shadow Sect.

During his time in Giant Gate City, he left some clues. When he killed the ancient desolate dragon, he left behind a heavy power of All Things.

According to the methods of Shen Ling, they should be able to discover him.

He continued down the mine.

The top of the mountain had long been mined out, and now only the square of ore had not been mined.

The top part of the mine was only 10 percent. The true core of the mine was underground.

His body descended, and he only landed heavily after traveling hundreds of thousands of miles.

The substance here was very thick. Even an Emperor would have to expend a lot of effort to destroy it.

As for the extraction, it was far from simple.

Otherwise, there wouldn't be specialized treasures for extraction.

The rod was used to extract the Space Fire Abyssal Stone. One needed to activate the treasure with their own power, then extract the stone. While the process might sound easy, the actual extraction felt like a daily large-scale battle.

This was also why few Emperors bothered to come for mining.

The erosion of consciousness and strength was severe, and waiting for millions of years without any personal benefit left them drained.

Although the rewards were generous, facing an infinitely valuable mine every day, revisiting insignificant treasures seemed trivial. Many people developed a sense of internal imbalance.

So, gradually, fewer and fewer people came.

"We've arrived. This is where we usually rest!" Gong Miaoyi walked at the forefront and halted.

Jian Wushuang followed her gaze. Ahead was an extremely spacious area with a simple Dao Arena.

The profound Origin Source above indicated that this place was specifically set up to aid their cultivation through a Dao Image.

Jian Wushuang scrutinized it, noticing the Dao Image had an Azure Dragon beast head.

"Long Yi?" he exclaimed in surprise.

He hadn't expected to see the Dao Image of the Azure Dragon Temple Master here.

Perhaps, this was the Dao Arena established by the temple in the past; otherwise, it wouldn't be so specific, using their own people's Dao Image.

If it were the wealthy and powerful Elder Palace, they might even create a Universe Master's Dao Image just to attract Emperor-level miners.

Dao Images were easy to refine. By using a portion of the Universe Origin Source, one could create a simple Dao Arena at the level of a Universe Master.

It wouldn't be as austere as it was now.

Below the Dao Image, there were countless meditation cushions.

On both sides of the Dao Arena were some crude palaces, serving as trading places.

There was another advantage to this place, which was that it was very convenient to buy any treasures.

In order to provide these individuals with some motivation, there was a yearly target for the mined ores. Within the span of a year, each person needed to extract 1 pound of Space Fire Stone. Anything in excess could be exchanged for merit points and also accumulated towards their personal mission objectives.

The target for one faction was 100,000 pounds.

If Jian Wushuang were to achieve the goal every year, it would take a million years before he could leave.

However, accomplishing the task of mining 1 pound per year was exceedingly difficult.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com
