4649 Shock

His Confucian robe fluttered in the wind. Lu Ding looked at Void God calmly. At this moment, he was like the King of Qilin, releasing the Ancestor-level power of extreme yang.

Void God God’s eyes focused. The supreme divine power surging around the middle-aged man was at the Ancestor realm! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Since when was there another Ancestor realm being other than Cosmos God in the Divine Power Universe?

Before he could even think, Jian Wushuang’s extremely sharp sword had already come down on his head!

He had become a Half Ancestor in ten years.

Only Jian Wushuang knew how great the comprehension he had gained was.

The carefreeness of traversing hundreds of millions of miles in the Cangwu Platform finally laid the foundation for Jian Wushuang to become a Half Ancestor — the comprehension of all things.

Jian Wushuang, who had grown up under pressure, only wanted to protect his people.

It was also because he had comprehended his own Dao too early that everything had come to fruition and he had entered the Half Ancestor realm.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent.

The second move, River.

The endless Sword Intent condensed into a sword waterfall and river. It was the most ordinary but also the most powerful move, which laid the framework of the entire Wushuang Sword Dao.

The vast and vigorous river of Sword Intent went against the current and faced the ancestral Demon God form!

Looking at the Sword Intent released by his opponent, who was like an ant in the past, even he felt a little scared at this moment.

Void God waved his sleeves, and the ancestral Demon God form behind him roared and waved its two giant arms that were wrapped in chains to counter the attack!

As the two of them clashed, the sword waterfall roared and directly crushed the two arms of the ancestral form. Then, without losing any momentum, it fell on the ancestral Demon God form like thousands of swords hanging in the sky!

At that moment, both the Divine Power Universe and the Void Universe were shocked.

With the power of Half Ancestor, he had broken an Ancestor-level Demon ancestral form!

Jian Wushuang’s growth had completely exceeded everyone’s imagination. Even Xue Bo, who was the closest to Jian Wushuang, was in disbelief.

The ancestral Demon God form that covered the sky wailed in grief as it spewed out a huge amount of void energy. Countless Sword Intents pierced through the surface of its body, and it had completely dimmed.

Void God took a step back. He looked at the figure in disbelief. It was only a difference of ten years, but the ant that he could kill with a wave of his hand had become what he was now.

Without giving Void Godany time to catch his breath, Jian Wushuang put his right index and middle fingers together and drew a vast Sword Intent.

He had no sword in his hand, but a sword in his heart.

The vast Sword Intent weaved together like a dense net and covered Void God.

Lu Ding followed closely behind. He smiled slightly, and the form of Qilin appeared behind him, turning into countless forces of extreme yang and attacking the army of Void Warriors.

The power of the Ancestor realm was not something that a Void Master could resist. As soon as the Qilin’s ultimate yang power was released, 300,000 Void Masters who had just entered the Divine Power Universe were all turned into dust.

The destructive power of an Ancestor realm was too terrifying. The life and death of all living things could be determined with a single thought. Even a Half Ancestor could only die on the spot.

In just a moment, more than half of the army of millions that had just been formed from the Void Universe had been wiped out.

Just as Lu Ding was about to strike again, another terrifying being walked out of the chasm.

Devouring Emperor, who was wearing a black and gold robe and had an Imperial Crown on his head, had arrived like the ruler of the darkness!

His appearance put Lu Ding on guard.

However, the Devouring Emperor’s eyes never stopped on him. Instead, he looked at Old Master.

“You really didn’t die!” Suppressed anger filled with unwillingness reverberated through the entire battlefield.

Old Master looked calm and looked at the Devouring Emperor with disdain. “Do you think you can kill me?”

A short sentence ignited the Devouring Emperor. The vooid trembled, and eight True Shadows appeared behind him.

“If I can injure you once, I can injure you a second time. Wait for me to devour you!”

The eight True Shadows were of different colors, but their faces were exactly the same as Old Master’s face.

Like the sudden arrival of extreme darkness, each of the True Shadows with Ancesto realm strength rushed over.

Lu Ding did not have the time to make a move. He immediately turned his thick extreme yang divine power into a barrier to block the army of cultivators.

Boom boom boom!

The combined attack of the eight True Shadows easily tore through Lu Ding’s extreme yang divine power and headed straight for Old Master.

The earth-shaking power even made Lu Ding’s heart palpitate.

That terrifying power that was difficult to understand, was it really Ancestor realm power?

On the other side, Jian Wushuang approached Void God with only one palm raised. He seemed much more relaxed.

He was like a flying Immortal in the sky. Each of his light attacks was enough to damage Void God.

Void God, who could have killed him with one palm back then, could now only barely resist the continuous attacks.

Jian Wushuang pointed forward, and the invisible Sword Intent pierced Void God’s left shoulder.

As the ancestral blood gushed out, his expression became ferocious.

“The worst decision I’ve ever made was to let you live!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s calm mind trembled. “What did you say?”

Void God’s eyes were cold. “I didn’t expect that you could grow to this level in just ten years. If I had known that, I would have killed you on the spot!”

Instantly, the final scene of the Great Catastrophe War ten years ago surged into their minds.

Jian Wushuang finally understood why he and Old Master could survive. It turned out that the attack of Void God, which was enough to destroy everything, had pushed them far away the moment it was about to explode.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice, “Why did you do that?”

Void God sneered. “There’s always a reasonable concern behind all unreasonable things, but I’m still wrong.”

“To make up for my mistake, I’ll completely destroy you today.”

With a deep voice, Void God’s body, which was originally wrapped in black mist, instantly lit up with countless mysterious runes.

Jian Wushuang only felt a great horror of life and death surging in his heart. He almost relied on his instinct to turn sideways and dodged several chains that swept out of Void God’s body.

The clothes on his left shoulder, which had just touched the chain, began to tear quickly.

After missing his attack, the chains returned to his body. Void God, who was covered in mysterious runes, looked at Jian Wushuang with burning eyes.

Void God, who carried the fate energy of the entire Void Universe, was extremely terrifying. Even Jian Wushuang felt a sense of life-and-death crisis when facing him.

“The destruction of the Divine Power Universe is a foregone conclusion. Your appearance is just adding the last sorrowful stroke to the Divine Power Universe. I will remember you, but you must die by my hands.”

Void God’s eyes were burning. After saying this, he did not plan on saying anything else.

The countless mysterious runes around him gradually sublimated into the void and condensed into a strange formation.
