Chapter 93: Abyss

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang had an odd feeling because he felt a sense of attraction. It seemed that something in front, not far away, was summoning and calling to him. To be exact, it was summoning and attracting his Sword Soul.

“What on earth is there? What is summoning me?” Jian Wushuang leaped to a branch of a big tree, looking forward.

Hesitating for a while, Jian Wushuang decided to investigate.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang directly rushed forward. And he also found that as he was getting closer and closer, his Sword Soul felt stronger and stronger. Likewise the attractive summoning power.

In the meantime, Jian Wushuang rushed toward the source of that power.

Meanwhile in the mountain forest where Jian Wushuang had killed two Dark Silver Guards,

“Humph! Is it these two f**k guys that killed so many teammates?” The Birdeyed man and other teammates approached the corpses of the two Dark Silver Guards.

They thought the one that had spied on them and killed several dozen teammates was a devil, a demon.

But now looking carefully, they found that they were also ordinary mortals without three heads and six arms and only possessed Cultivation of Profound Gold Core Realm.

“Pooh! Two bastards! Useless!”

The rest of the team were all cursing. Some of them were spitting at the two Dark Silver Guards.

No one noticed that a coquettish shadow had already appeared in a nearby tree. It was a lady with a bleak face. She was quite beautiful in silver, tightly holding a Purple Soft Sword whose hilt was carved with the number one.

“Lao Liu, Lao Qi?”

Standing in the tip of the tree, the severe-looking lady observed the corpses of the two Dark Silver Guards at a glance and a frozen killing intent flashed in her eyes immediately.

“Are they?” The frosty lady took action at once.

They were still cursing when a coquettish shadow moved suddenly.

“Ah!” “Ah!”

Two miserable shrieks sounded in succession. The next moment, they felt panic.

“Devil? Devil again?”

“Hadn’t he been killed already?”

“Shit! He hasn’t. He is coming again.”

Amidst those frightened voices, the blurry silver shadow moved, again and again, killing people crazily.

Just after a while, there were numerous corpses on the ground. Dozens of teammates were dead except the leader, the birdeyed man. But his arms had already been chopped off, he had lost the ability to struggle.

“Good-for-nothings. You aren’t likely to kill Lao Liu and Lao Qi. Tell me, who killed them?” the bleak lady turned up in front of the Birdeye man, interrogating.

The Birdeyed man had been frightened into numbness and immediately told everything he knew.

“Spiritual Sea Realm?”

“Lao Liu and Lao Qi were killed just by a Spiritual Sea Realm?”

The bleak lady’s face clouded over. When she waved her hands, a sword directly pierced through the Birdeye man’s throat. And then she chased toward the direction where Jian Wushuang left.

Pursuing the sense of fate, Jian Wushuang soon came to the convergence of two mountains. However, the convergence was cut off in the middle by a dark bottomless abyss. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang stood nearby the abyss, looking upon the bottom of the dark abyss where the chilly wind blowing.

Swoosh!

A chilly wind blew on both side of the mountain wall with a crackling sound. Meanwhile, some mountain stones were blown off.

“Horrible wind.” Jian Wushuang was astonished and knew where this was.

“The Abyss is well-deserved as the most dangerous land among Innumerable Huge Mountains.” Jian Wushuang looked grim face.

Before leaving for Innumerable Huge Mountains, he had gotten a map of it. There was information about the natural dangers on it, including the Abyss.

The Abyss, located at the convergence of two great mountains, was bottomless. There was a strong chill wind blowing into the abyss. The force of this chill wind was so terrible that rocks would be cracked into pieces, not to speak of the human body.

However, a human warrior could generate a shield of Spiritual Power to forcibly withstand these chill wind.

However the most terrifying aspect of the abyss was absolutely not the chill wind, but its mystery.

Since the abyss had appeared, over a long period, a great many strong warriors including some warriors of Yin-Yang Void Realm had attempted to explore it. But they only could enter within a kilometer. Once exceeding that, no one could get out alive.

So until now, nobody knew what existed at the bottom and what the secret was?

Unknown! Mysterious!

As such, the Abyss was so frightening and universally acknowledged to be the most dangerous land among Innumerable Huge Mountains.

“Is it the Abyss that attracted me all this time?” There was a hint of shock in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The Abyss was well-known, mysterious and terrible. What on earth was attracting him over there?

“Is it the Ancestor’s Land that aunt had told me before?” Jian Wushuang remembered it spontaneously.

Ancestor’s Land. Jian Wushuang also did not know what it was.

Ji Wuyue had told him to carefully keep the Triple-kill Sword, the only token to enter the Ancestor’s Land.

In his view, it seemed that in the abyss, the only thing deeply attracting him was the Ancestor’s Land.

Of course, Jian Wushuang was uncertain whether it was the Ancestor’s Land below the abyss. Even if confirmed, he dared not go down now.

Seriously, it was the abyss. Among other things, he was unable to withstand the chill wind with his present strength. It was no different from going to hell if he entered the Abyss impulsively.

“I should explore it after my strength is increased,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt very curious to find that there seemed to be a relation between the abyss and the Ancestor’s Land. But what made him happy was the changes in his body.

“Sword Soul, are you completely awake?”

Jian Wushuang smile slightly. Just on the way, his power of Sword Soul hidden in the body was continually improving, becoming stronger and stronger. Until now, the power of Sword Soul had reached a completely new level. Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang also found that there was something new in his brain.
