“Sixth Lair?”

King of Venomous Worms was shocked too, “The Eight Lairs, the stronger they are the more dangerous it is. Many strong Chaotic Real God only dared to venture into Eight Lair. As for the Sixth Lair, it is dangerous even for experts on Real God ranking list. Lei Chao has guts.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He could tell that Lei Chao’s trip was very dangerous.

Many higher-ups on Lineage of Star definitely knew. Hence the banquet to send him off.

“Come on everyone. Let’s toast to Lei Chao,” Hall Master Yuan raised his glass as his voice traveled across the hall.

The higher-ups of Lineage of Star at the banquet naturally raised their glasses and Jian Wushuang did the same.

Lei Chao departed right after the banquet.

Lineage of Star resumed its tranquility again while Jian Wushuang returned to his secret room to continue his cultivation.

In the blink of an eye, another two hundred years passed.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes.

“Regardless of if it was enhancement of Sword Principle or speed of comprehension towards Heaven Way, it obviously slowed down significantly. It seems that the eruption period after I breakthrough and become Universe God in the Third Heaven has passed,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself but there was a smile on his face.

An ordinary cultivator would be welcomed with a short eruption period after they broke through and entered another realm.

Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator, so he was trapped in the realm of Universe God in the Second Heaven for a long time. Then, as he broke through, the eruption period was naturally much longer. It lasted for a total of five hundred years.

In the five hundred years, Jian Wushuang didn’t spend his time in vain. After painstaking cultivation, regardless of sword unique kill or comprehension towards Heaven Way, there was a major improvement.

His power was naturally much stronger than when he was in Burning Demon Region.

“Once the eruption period is over, it will be useless to continue to cultivate in seclusion.”

Jian Wushuang immediately left the secret room.

In Sword Star, under a big tree.

Jian Wushuang, Ling Feibai, Long Ya and Xuan Yi sat together.

“Xuan Yi, congratulations for breaking through and becoming a Real God. Among the four of us, you’re the first who broke through and became a Real God,” Jian Wushuang said to Xuan Yi.

Ling Feibai and Long Ya by his side looked envious too, especially Long Ya. He stopped at the realm of Universe God much longer than Xuan Yi. But then, Xuan Yi had already broken through and he had yet to break through.

Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang with a weird look and said, “Although I broke through and became a Real God, in terms of power, I am far behind a Peak Void Real God. I can’t compare to you and Duan Lingfeng at all.”

“You want to compare with the two monsters?” Ling Feibai rolled his eyes at Xuan Yi.

Regardless of if it was Jian Wushuang or Duan Lingfeng, they were both widely recognized as monstrous monsters that were hard to come by in Eternal Chaotic World.

Like Jian Wushuang, he was only a Universe God but his fighting power could be evenly matched with an Eternal Real God.

When Duan Lingfeng broke through and became Real God, he could defeat an Eternal Chaotic Real God head-on too.

As for Xuan Yi, although he was also a top genius, he was far behind if he were to compare to the two of them.Visit on our

Jian Wushuang heard Xuan Yi’s complaints and laughed them off.

Although he was a deacon elderly then, he didn’t act haughtily. He was willing to chat casually with his few peers.

Just then… Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures that suddenly plunged in from the Milky Way and landed on Sword Star.

The four of them under the tree looked. When they saw the incomers, Ling Feibai, Long Ya and Xuan Yi got up simultaneously.

“Jian Wushuang, we shall make a move as you have things to deal with,” Ling Feibai said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After Ling Feibai and the other two left, Jian Wushuang got up too and looked at the man and woman before him.

“Elder Wu Liang, Elder Fei Yan, why are both of you so free to visit me today?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He waved and there were fresh wine and delicacies on the stone table again, “Come and have a drink together.”

“Drink is not necessary. We came today to ask for a favor,” Elder Wu Liang smiled faintly and he sounded quite gentle.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two of them in shock.

From what he knew, the two elders before him should be considered as extremely strong among all deacon elderlies in Lineage of Star. For instance, Elder Wu Liang was a peak Eternal Real God. As for Elder Fei Yan, although she was weaker, she was extremely close to a peak Eternal Real God standard.

He wasn’t a match for either of them.

With such power, they still needed help from him?

“Please do tell me what’s going on,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’ll be frank,” Real God Wu Liang said, “Actually, it is a task that Hall Master Yuan has delegated to me. He wants me to kill a Real God.”

“The Real God’s name is Real God Shi Jue!”

“Real God Shi Jue shared a great resentment with Lineage of Star. Many years ago, there were two disciples of Star Palace from Lineage of Star who came across him were killed when they were wandering outside.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The disciples of Star Palace were the most outstanding ones in Lineage of Star. Every one of them was truly a top genius. For instance, there were many higher-ups in Lineage of Star derived from disciples of Star Palace. Lineage of Star attached great importance to the disciples of Star Palace too.

However, Real God Shi Jue killed had two disciples of Star Palace. No wonder Lineage of Star would want to kill him.

“Real God Shi Jue is very cunning. He knew that he didn’t have a place in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries after the incident was exposed. Hence, he ran out of Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries long ago and went to some Holy Kingdoms far away. Over hundreds of thousands of years, we of Lineage of Star couldn’t find him. But not too long ago, we Lineage of Star received a piece of credible news that Real God Shi Jue returned to Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and he is hiding in Colored Glaze Sanctuary.

“Hall Master Yuan assigned me to kill him at Colored Glaze Sanctuary. However, Real God Shi Jue is a strong Eternal Real God after all. Plus, his defensive power is extremely strong. Most importantly, his speed is extremely fast and his martial art motion is impressive too. With me alone, it is almost impossible to kill him. So, I found you and Elder Fei Yan.”

“Elder Fei Yan was good at entangling and trapped his opponent while you, Jian Wushuang, have a terrifying martial art motion. You might be even faster by a slight bit than Real God Shi Jie. Only collaboration with the two of you will give me the confidence to kill Real God Shi Jue!”

“Of course, the reward for the task is bountiful. By then, we can split evenly,” Elder Wu Liang said. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Jian Wushuang, what do you think?” Elder Fei Yan looked at him too.

“Real God Shi Jue is on which land in Colored Glaze Sanctuary? It shouldn’t be in Four Symbol Land, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Don’t worry. It’s not in Four Symbol Land. If it was on Four Symbol Land, I wouldn’t come to look for you,” Elder Wu Liang laughed. He knew the resentment between Jian Wushuang and the overlord of Four Symbol Land, Four Symbol Mansion. If Jian Wushuang were to head to Four Symbol Land, he would be courting death himself.

“If so, alright then,” Jian Wushuang agreed straight away.
