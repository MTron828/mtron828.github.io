Chapter 2038 Finally Dead!

As Jian Wushuang was besieged by the thirteen Great Emperors in madness, he took out a token.

The token belonged to Emperor Jiu Qiao who had escaped from Imperial Peak.

“Emperor Jiu Qiao, listen to me. Find a place to hide with Abysmal Saint Master for now. Don’t be in a hurry to leave Three-Emperors World.”

After he sent out a simple message, Jian Wushuang didn’t worry about if Emperor Jiu Qiao replied, but his eyes grew red with madness as he looked at the thirteen Great Emperors in front of him.

“Haha, come on, come on!!”

Jian Wushuang’s hysterical laughter burst out.

His hysterical laugh made people feel that he was in a hopeless situation, that he was experiencing madness before death.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s divine body increased in size again. He was about ten thousand zhang tall.

With such a huge size, he was simply a giant target to the surrounding thirteen Great Emperors. The Great Emperors’ attacks hit Jian Wushuang even more easily. However, he could cover a bigger range with his body size. The damage that he could cause to the surrounding golden whirlpool was even greater.

Jian Wushuang became a madman who was fighting to his death. He fought with his all against the surrounding Great Emperors. The terrifying attacks shook the entire golden whirlpool and the originally-quivering golden whirlpool shook even more vigorously.

Rumble. There was a ferocious rumble and a storm took place in the golden whirlpool.

The terrifying storm stirred an enormous amount of pure energy in Emperor Supreme Rock and it started roaring.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang and all Great Emperors in the golden whirlpool were engulfed within the energy storm.

In the storm, there was a boundless gale howling and people couldn’t keep their eyes open.

“Oh no!”

“This crazy man!”

The thirteen Great Emperors looked on in distress.

The balance of the surrounding golden whirlpool was broken apart by Jian Wushuang. The energy storm was caused by the imbalance of the golden whirlpool.

“The aura he carried has diminished,” A Great Emperor suddenly said.

“Huh?” The other Great Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

As expected, Jian Wushuang’s aura was obviously weaker than it had been before.

One should know that from the beginning of the massacre until then, Jian Wushuang’s fighting power had been at its peak. He wasn’t affected at all.

However, his aura had diminished then. In other words, he was beginning to get hurt.

“Haha, I thought he was really invincible and unbeatable. It turns out that he can be hurt too.”

“Humph. He should be proud that he could last so long under the besiegement of thirteen Great Emperors. Regardless, he has his limits.”

“Forget about the golden whirlpool. Kill Jian Wushuang first!”

“Alright.”

The thirteen Great Emperors instantly reached a mutual agreement and launched attacks simultaneously. In the energy storm happening in the golden whirlpool, they continued to hem Jian Wushuang in.

“Die! Die! Die!”

Jian Wushuang constantly roared and he became even more violent and crazy. However, his aura grew weaker and he started spitting blood. It was obvious that he was coming to an end.

Finally… As Ling Zong’s battle ax hit on his huge divine body, his divine body began to collapse.

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

The speed of his collapse was extremely fast. After a short while, Jian Wushuang’s divine body turned into divine power that scattered all around the golden whirlpool.

In the golden whirlpool, the energy storm reached a terrifying level along with the madness of the battle. Only Great Emperors could stand straight in the storm. If it were any ordinary Sir God or Emperor God, they would have been killed in the energy storm.

The energy storm was terrifying. Hence, after Jian Wushuang’s divine body had collapsed, his flesh and blood that scattered around, including his divine power, was instantly swept by the energy storm. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The thirteen Great Emperors appeared in the place where Jian Wushuang’s divine body had collapsed and looked into the surrounding void.

“He’s finally dead?”

The expressions on the thirteen Great Emperors looked complicated. It stirred a billowing wave from the bottom of their hearts.

A total of thirteen Great Emperors had worked together.

There were so many powerful Great Emperors, including Ling Zong and the tall and sturdy middle-aged man among the group. Even so, they had used such a long time and put in great effort to finally kill Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang wasn’t the strongest enemy that they had ever fought against, there was no doubt that he was absolutely the one with the strongest defense power and had taken the most beating.

However, regardless, Jian Wushuang was killed by them.

“Sword Emperor is quite impressive. Look, he is already dead but his divine power and aura are still terrifying, “one of the Great Emperors commented.

The other Great Emperors looked at the surrounding void.

It was true. The surrounding void and even the energy storm in the golden whirlpool was covered in an enormous amount of divine power and aura. They were still shockingly strong.

The Great Emperors merely complemented casually and thought Jian Wushuang was truly impressive.

When one’s power reached their level, they would leave behind an enormous amount of divine power and aura. It was perfectly normal. The divine power and aura would slowly be dispersed as time flew past. They didn’t need to bother with it.

“Oh yeah, where is Jian Wushuang’s Qian Kun ring and his treasures?”

A Great Emperor immediately searched around the place that Jian Wushuang had died. However, he swept his soul power across but couldn’t find any treasure. He couldn’t even find the divine weapon that Jian Wushuang had used.

“What happened?” The Great Emperor looked confused.

“It should have been swept away by the energy storm in the golden whirlpool. His divine body increased to such a size and it covered too wide a range. The energy storm in the golden whirlpool is so strong, it could wipe away his treasure in an instant,” another Great Emperor commented.

“Mm, I noticed earlier that his Qian Kun ring was swept away by an energy storm. I wanted to stop it but I was quite far away from the Qian Kun ring,” another Great Emperor said.

Hence, the Great Emperors were not suspicious about it.

It was such a terrifying energy storm. Most importantly, Jian Wushuang’s size was so huge. At the very moment at which his divine body collapsed, it became perfectly understandable that his treasure would be blown away by the energy storm.

“Let’s think of a way to stabilize the golden whirlpool first. Then, we can search through the area carefully to see if we can find any of Jian Wushuang’s treasure,” Ling Zong said.

The Great Emperors on the spot nodded simultaneously.

However, Jian Wushuang had caused quite a bit of damage to the golden whirlpool. It would be rather troublesome to recover it.
