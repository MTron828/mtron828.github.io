Chapter 1732: Triangle Island

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Buddhist Demon Sea, at hidden void where four figures in black robes stood side by side. There was a deep voice that was heard under the black robe.

“Just got an update. Jian Wushuang has already entered Buddhist Demon Sea and Hall Master Gu Xin from Lineage of Star came in too but they parted ways.”

“Someone will take care of Hall Master Gu Xin, we can ignore her. Our target is the one and only Jian Wushuang.”

“Hehe, in order to kill Jian Wushuang, Acheron Palace is liberal with money. The four of us normally take action alone but they gathered us here together. Plus, they are only launching the first of the four killer attacks now.”

“From what I can see, the higher-ups look too highly upon Jian Wushuang. Although he is really talented, his power is barely at the level of a Sir God’s. It is unnecessary to make such a great troop to kill him. Four killer attacks and that is only the first, he might not be able to dodge, or there might even not be necessary for the first attack. With the existence of natural danger in Buddhist Demon Sea itself, it will be sufficient to kill Jian Wushuang.”

“Hehe, the four of us arranged to only be involved in the third attacks and above. I reckon we might not stand a chance to launch an attack.

The four of them chatted casually.

As they chatted, they were absolutely confident.

Acheron Palace wouldn’t take action. If they did, the other party would stand almost no chance at all to flee.

Then, Acheron Palace put great attention on Jian Wushuang and planned it meticulously. They had even prepared four killer attacks. Jian Wushuang… was doomed.

In the boundless dark sea, Jian Wushuang continued to plunge forward slowly as he looked around while he kept his guard up.

“Buddhist Demon Sea is extremely dangerous to Sir Gods. Although Lei Chao was chased after by Old Monster Sui Gu and he ran to Buddhist Demon Sea helplessly, he definitely won’t be too far in. He should still be at the border of Buddhist Demon Sea,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Buddhist Demon Sea, there was a difference between open sea and inland sea.

Inland Sea was more dangerous compared to open sea.

“What I can do now is search along the open sea and hope that I can find him,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

As long as he was on the open sea, Jian Wushuang stood a chance to save Lei Chao. If Lei Chao were to be at the inland sea, Jian Wushuang had no way at all.

Jian Wushuang continued to plunge as he spread his soul power. However, his soul power was greatly restricted in Buddhist Demon Sea and the coverage was less than one-fifth of his performance during his peak. Hence, the difficulty of searching had increased tremendously.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body suddenly stopped. He saw a crimson figure in the sea region before him in his sights.

It was the size of a human body with a pair of hands and legs. Its skin was crimson and there was an eye and a big mouth on its head. It was a Star Demon that could only be found in the Eight Lair.

However, the Star Demon in front of him and was obviously much stronger than any Star Demons that Jian Wushuang had ever seen. On its head, there were four horns.

Four-Horned Star Demon!

A Star Demon comparable to a human Sir God.

As Jian Wushuang saw the Star Demon, its crimson eye looked at Jian Wushuang directly.

“Human!”

With boundless murderous intention in the voice of the Star Demon, it instantly charged forward in the next moment. Then, there was a great rage that soared up.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

He knew that there were Star Demons in Buddhist Demon Sea and the power of the Star Demons were extremely strong overall. Such Four-Horned Star Demon was common.

Wow!

The crimson light twinkled. Then, the Four-Horned Star Demon suddenly appeared before Jian Wushuang. It waved its palm and clawed the sky. Not only the void was torn open, the dark sea underneath was greatly torn as well.

“Such intense speed,” Jian Wushuang was surprised and he quickly retreated.

The sharp claw came to nothing but it stirred up a violent storm and roaring waves in the sea below.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang humphed coldly, then the two Hong Jun Golden Swords appeared in front of him simultaneously and turned into two rays of golden flowing light that burst out.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The ear-piercing, air-splitting noise spread.

The two Hong Jun Golden Swords appeared before the Four-Horned Star Demon and instantly hit the Four-Horned Star Demon.

The Hong Jun Golden Swords hit it brutally while Four-Horned Star Demon swung its pair of arms with its all.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

After the few clashes that only continued for five times, one of the two Hong Jun Golden Swords pierced the Four-Horned Star Demon’s head at the sixth hit.

Jian Wushuang took a leap and came in front of the Four-Horned Star Demon. He waved and collected the demon core into his Qian Kun ring.

“The Four-Horned Star Demon should have just transformed not too long ago. Its power is comparable to the lowest level of Sir God, or maybe even lower. With my current power, it is quite easy to kill him,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He wasn’t like before. Among Sir Gods, he was definitely one of the stronger experts.

However, the Four-Horned Star Demons had reminded Jian Wushuang to be more cautious.

The time flew past and three years passed in the blink on an eye.

For three years, Jian Wushuang had continued to keep in contact with Lei Chao and Hall Master Gu Xin, but he had yet to find the triangle island that Lei Chao was at.

They had no choice. Buddhist Demon Sea was extremely huge and merely the open sea itself was spacious. A Sir God might not be able to search through the entire region in a thousand years. Jian Wushuang and Hall Master Gu Xin knew the rough direction which Lei Chao had entered Buddhist Demon Sea in and they got to minimize their search scope. However, it was still not easy to look for Lei Chao.

In the boundless dark sea, Jian Wushuang was suddenly attracted by the miniature island in front of him.

It was an ordinary island and it wasn’t huge. In the three years of Jian Wushuang’s search in Buddhist Demon Sea, he couldn’t keep count of how many similar islands he had passed by. Any island that he had passed before didn’t catch his attention, only this did.

That was because Jian Wushuang saw a big hole in the middle of the island. The big hole was obviously caused by a hit of divine power, and most importantly, the time that it was formed wasn’t too far back.

“Buddhist Demon Sea, there is hardly anyone that comes in. It is even more impossible for there to be a battle. The hole on the island was definitely made when Old Monster Sui Gu chased after Lei Chao. Lei Chao is definitely near the island,” Jian Wushuang was thrilled. He then started to search thoroughly near the island.

The search continued for another eleven years.

Finally, there was an extremely huge triangle island that appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Found it!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.
