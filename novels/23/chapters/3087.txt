Chapter 3089: Inviting Lord Long Xing

Hua!

The sword light mercilessly flashed past, and a head flew out.

The cold old man’s eyes were wide open as he watched his head and divine body separate.

Although he was shocked, the cold old man was not scared.

After all, True Saints all had immortal bodies, but suddenly..

“Ah!”

An unprecedented pain appeared out of nowhere, causing the cold elder to cry out in shock.

“Poison, it’s poison, this poison…it’s the evil god poison!” The cold elder instantly felt that the evil god poison was madly corroding his divine body.

The evil god poison was extremely powerful. Although he was a peak rank four True Saint, he still could not resist it.

In the blink of an eye, 80% of his divine power had been corroded by the evil god poison.

However, the evil god poison that had corroded the cold elder’s body had been completely exhausted.

“He’s not dead?” Jian Wushuang frowned, but he was not surprised.

Under normal circumstances, one drop of evil god poison was enough to kill a rank three True Saint.

However, the cold old man was a peak fourth level True Saint, so the effect of the evil god poison would be greatly reduced. In addition, the level of the evil god poison was not low. Even the Blood Mountain Sword could only absorb three drops of the evil god poison at the same time.

Three drops was the limit.

Therefore, when the sword light flashed past, only three drops of the evil god poison entered the cold old man’s divine body and began to erode his divine power.

It was normal that three drops of evil god poison could not kill the cold elder completely.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted and slowly raised his left hand. Then he pointed at the void where the cold elder was.

This finger seemed ordinary, but the moment he pointed, a power of space-time principles burst out.

Rumble! A majestic space-time storm appeared out of thin air.

“No!”

A mournful roar echoed in the sky. The cold old man’s divine body that was about to be reassembled, along with a large amount of surging god power, fell into the space-time storm.

Rumble

The space-time storm crazily crushed and annihilated everything, as if it was destroying everything.

In just a blink of an eye, everything in the void where the cold elder was, including his divine power, was destroyed. Naturally, the cold elder was also dead.

“One-finger void annihilation technique is a divine technique that can destroy everything on a large scale. It can also counter the immortal body of a True Saint expert. The space-time storm destroyed everything in its path, including divine power!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The immortal body of a True Saint expert was based on divine power.

However, if the divine power of this True Saint expert was completely annihilated, then the True Saint expert would certainly die.

A True Saint expert who had reached the peak of rank four was killed by Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

The surrounding people also saw this scene.

All of a sudden, everyone was shocked. They even forgot that they were fighting with someone and stopped what they were doing.

“This, this…” Xiong Tao stared at Jian Wushuang, his eyes full of shock.

“He, he really has hidden his strength?” The beautiful woman in golden armor trembled. “…”

Bai Xiao, Jiu Luo, Duan Yu, and the others were all stunned speechless.

They were not the only ones. The four black-robed men were the same as well.

“A rank one True Saint killed a peak rank four True Saint? How is this possible?”

“Am I dreaming?”

“It’s fake. How could 39 die at the hands of a rank one True Saint?”

The black-robed men were also completely stunned.

After a long while, one of the long-haired black-robed men reacted immediately. “Quick, invite Lord Long Xing!”

As the long-haired black-robed man shouted, a black-robed man immediately flipped his hand and took out a special token.

Pa!

The jade token was crushed, and a vast and majestic aura descended.

Weng, weng, weng, a large amount of black fog condensed in the void, and in the blink of an eye, it formed a three-meter-tall black phantom.

This black phantom was extremely hazy, and its exact appearance could not be seen clearly. All that could be seen was a pair of cold eyes peeking out from the fog.

“Lord Long Xing!”

Seeing the arrival, the four black-robed men immediately bowed respectfully.

The Black Shadow’s cold eyes looked around the void, and then he said in a hoarse voice, “Where’s 39?”

“Master, 39 is dead. We have no choice but to ask you to help us,” the long-haired black-robed man said respectfully.

“He only killed a few rank one True Saints. Not only did he fail to kill them, but he even lost his life. What a waste!” The black phantom cursed in a low voice.

The four black-robed men lowered their heads and did not dare to say another word.

In the void in front of them, Jian Wushuang and the others stood there, looking at the black shadow that suddenly appeared in the void with an extremely ugly expression.

They could see that the black shadow was probably an energy clone formed by an expert using a special method.

Although it was only an energy clone, if its owner was extremely powerful, the energy clone could also burst out with extraordinary battle strength, which was enough to pose a great threat to them.

“The strength that this main body’s energy clone currently possesses is extremely limited. It can only unleash one attack. After one attack, the four of you should immediately leave no matter what the result is,”the black illusory figure instructed.

“Yes.” The four black-robed men immediately nodded.

The black illusory figure slowly lifted his head after giving his instructions.

The moment he lifted his head, a strange glow flashed within his cold eyes.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. An extremely unique power burst out like a tsunami.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed. “Soul attack!”

“Oh no, be careful of the soul attack!” Xiong Tao also shouted in a low voice.

The moment he sensed that the black phantom had used soul attack, Jian Wushuang had already moved.

A silver light flashed across the void, and Jian Wushuang pushed his speed and movement to the limit.

He did not attack the black shadow, nor did he retreat. Instead, he stood in front of Jiu Luo.

Among the people present, only Jiu Luo had some friendship with him. Jiu Luo was the weakest, and he did not have any soul defense skills. Once he was affected by the soul attack, there was at least a 90% chance that he would die, now that Jian Wushuang was standing in front of Jiu Luo, the soul attack that was coming toward Jiu Luo was completely withstood by Jian Wushuang alone.

Boom! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang felt as if a huge drumstick had smashed into his sea of consciousness. He had the exquisite pagoda in his sea of consciousness, but with the impact of this soul power, his soul pagoda only lasted for a moment, then it collapsed.
