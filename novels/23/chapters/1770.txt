At that moment, in the Sea Continent, the Soaring Heaven Mansion, which once possessed a lot of power that could cause many powerhouses and sects to be extremely frightened, had been reduced to a piece of ruins.

A great number of bodies and a great amount of blood could be seen everywhere.

Emperor God Tian Xiao and his group of people were standing at the void on top of the Soaring Heaven Mansion. However, they were deathly silent and they did not say anything.

As for the large number of surrounding cultivators who were observing the battle, their throats were restless and similarly, they did not dare to speak.

At that moment, even more people were in shock.

In the battle on that very day, Jian Wushuang’s abilities had caused them to be completely stunned.

By himself, he had destroyed the big protective formation of the Soaring Heaven Mansion, charged into the Soaring Heaven Mansion, killed three Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace as well as many of the Real Gods and Universe Gods. In the end, he had fought with Emperor God Tian Xiao who had hurried over and he was not at a disadvantage at all. Even though Emperor God Tian Xiao had used his God Slayer Arrow, Jian Wushuang still remained standing with pride and he swaggered off in the end.

What kind of earth-shaking stunt was that?

“Palace Master!”

Sir God Qing Fu came to the side of Emperor God Tian Xiao and said with a trembling body: “Are we just going to look on as Jian Wushuang leaves?”

“What else can we do? I have already used the God Slayer Arrow. However, I was able to neither kill nor injure him seriously. Even if the three of you and I were to team up, would we really be able to keep him here?” Emperor God Tian Xiao snorted coldly.

Upon hearing that, Sir God Qing Fu and the two top Sir Gods at the side could not help but become silent.

That’s right. If they did not want to look on as Jian Wushuang left, what else could they do?

It should be known that Emperor God Tian Xiao had already taken action personally. Moreover, he had used the God Slayer Arrow. However, he was still unable to kill Jian Wushuang. Although the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s base had stronger trump cards, most of them could only be unleashed in the base and there were not many of them which could be brought out.

Moreover, even if they were to use all the trump cards that they could bring out, would they really be able to kill Jian Wushuang for sure?

“In the battle today, the Soaring Heaven King Palace lost a great amount of abilities. Moreover, if I am not wrong, Jian Wushuang will continue to go on a rampage in the Sea Continent and he might even continue his massacre into the Soaring Heaven land. By then, it will be even more troublesome.” Emperor God Tian Xiao clenched his fists tightly and his eyes shone with a shrill light, “Let’s go back first. The Soaring Heaven King Palace has to think of a surefire plan to kill him. Even if we are unable to kill him, we absolutely cannot allow him to go on a rampage wantonly in the territories of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

In no time, Emperor God Tian Xiao had brought the remaining experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace with him and returned to their base in the Soaring Heaven Land.

As for the large number of cultivators who were fortunate enough to observe the battle in the Soaring Heaven Mansion, they were in a huge uproar.

All of them knew that after that battle, the Soaring Heaven Mansion was crippled. In the future, the Soaring Heaven King Palace might send experts over to take control. However, it would not be soon.

At that moment, the most pressing matter for the Soaring Heaven King Palace was Jian Wushuang!

“The Sea Continent is about to change!”

…

When Jian Wushuang charged into the Soaring Heaven Mansion alone, all the powerhouses in the Eternal Chaotic World got the news right away.

In no time, the news of the results of the battle had spread.

Three Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace were killed. When Jian Wushuang fought with Emperor God Tian Xiao head-on, he was not in a disadvantage at all and in the end, he swaggered off…

At once, the Sanctuary Alliance was in an uproar and everyone was shocked!

Countless people felt that it was unbelievable.

“How is this possible? No matter what, Jian Wushuang is still a Real God. Although he is an Inverse Cultivator, he can’t be this strong, right?”

“A Real God is actually able to fight a head-on battle with an Emperor God and not be in a disadvantage? Haha~~~”

“This Jian Wushuang is too nature-defying. Even Real God Wu Bei, who once achieved the top of a Real God, barely possessed the fighting capabilities of a top Sir God when he was in his peak. Compared to Jian Wushuang, he is extremely far away. In the whole Eternal Chaotic World, perhaps there is only one person who can be compared to him!”

“Emperor Bai!!!”

Many experts had already stopped comparing Jian Wushuang to Real God Wu Bei. Instead, they compared him to Emperor Bai.

After all, Emperor Bai was an Inverse Cultivator and he had grown to become what he was from a Real God. At that moment, the Sanctuary Alliance recognized him as the most powerful person.

Perhaps only the fighting capabilities of Emperor Bai when he had been a Real God might be stronger than that of Jian Wushuang.

At the same time that everyone was exclaiming in admiration with regards to the battle in the Soaring Heaven Mansion.

In the Thunderbolt Island, in a courtyard at the highest peak of the Sanctuary Mountain where many top experts of the Sanctuary Alliance lived in.

Atop a single-plank bridge which stretched across a brook, there was an old man who wore simple gray clothes and he was sitting down and holding a bamboo pole. As for his body, it was leaning against a wooden peg which was beside him.

Although he looked like he was fishing, in actual fact, he had already closed his eyes and he was snoring softly at the same time.

This gray-clothed old man had obviously fallen asleep.

Moreover, he had remained in the same posture on the single-plank bridge for a total of thirteen thousand years.

All of a sudden, a layer of ripples appeared on the seal beside the courtyard. Although the ripples dissipated quickly, the gray-clothed old man still noticed them. Even though his eyes remained closed, he could still raise his eyebrows.

“East Royal, how come you’re free to come here?” the gray-clothed old man’s voice could be heard within the courtyard.

A silver-haired, middle-aged man appeared on the single-plank bridge abruptly and he sat down beside the gray-clothed old man right away. The middle-aged man’s eyes were as vast as millions upon millions of constellations and he said indifferently, “In the whole Sanctuary Alliance, the two of us are the only Great Emperors. Hence, isn’t it normal for me to look for you?”

“Hmph, those old bastards are living such a comfortable life and they have completely left the Sanctuary Alliance, which is in a mess, to the both of us,” the gray-clothed old man curled his lips.

“Stop complaining. Since both of us lost the bet back then, according to what we agreed upon, both of us have to oversee the Sanctuary Alliance for five million years. Now, not even half of that time has passed,” the middle-aged man sneered.

“It’s alright now. Tell me your objective for coming,” the gray-clothed old man’s eyes were still closed.

“This is a piece of news that I have just obtained. Take a look,” the middle-aged man passed a token over.

The gray-clothed old man took the token and skimmed through it. All of a sudden, he opened his eyes which had been closed all the while and a pair of dark gray eyes were revealed.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“As a Real God, he killed four Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace in succession. Moreover, when he fought with Emperor God Tian Xiao head-on, he was not at a disadvantage at all?” the gray-clothed old man revealed a surprised expression.

Even he was surprised by the piece of news.

“I have already confirmed the authenticity of this piece of news. It is indeed true. Moreover, Emperor God Tian Xiao has given his all and he even used the God Slayer Arrow in the end. However, even with the God Slayer Arrow, Jian Wushuang was still not injured in the slightest. Now, the Soaring Heaven King Palace is having a huge headache with regards to Jian Wushuang,” the middle-aged man laughed.

“Hmph, the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s way of doing things have always been unreasonable and they should pay for it. However, this little kid who is called Jian Wushuang is really impressive. Even though he fought with Emperor God Tian Xiao as a Real God, he was still not defeated. If such abilities were compared to Emperor Bai back when he was still a Real God, they should not be too different,” the gray-clothed old man muttered.
