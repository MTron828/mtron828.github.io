Chapter 2772: Blood Thunder King

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Tong were surprised to see the person who came forth.

Blood Thunder King... He was the leader of one of the three strongest factions in Crimson Stone Fort.

Not only was he a terrifying High-level Grand Ultimate God himself, but he also controlled the strongest Crimson Stone Official Army in Danyang Continent and there were more than ten known Grand Ultimate Gods who reported to him.

Blood Thunder King’s faction was able to compete with the Yin Suer and Yun Shan factions and keep them in check within the Crimson Stone Fort.

‘What made him make the trip to see Jian Wushuang in person?’

After a brief moment of shock, Jian Wushuang recovered his senses.

“Unexpectedly, the famous Blood Thunder King would come forth to my small and insignificant Sword Alliance today. You’ve graced Sword Alliance with your presence.” Jian Wushuang stood up and said politely.

“Alliance Master Su Han must be joking. If Sword Alliance is just a small and insignificant organization, then the various forces on Danyang Continent may be nothing at all.” Blood Thunder King chuckled.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and waved. “Please sit down.”

Blood Thunder King sat down at the stone table in front of him.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand to keep the chessboard on the stone table and then he took out some fruit and wine.

Blood Thunder King felt very at home. He grabbed a fruit with his big hand and ate it.

Jian Wushuang looked at Blood Thunder King playfully, “Blood Thunder King, you are here in person today. What’s the matter?”

“I’m here to discuss something important with you, Alliance Master Su Han.” Blood Thunder King wiped his mouth and said.

“You want to discuss something important with me?” Jian Wushuang’s expression remained unchanged.

“Alliance Master Su Han, as the leader of Sword Alliance, I believe you are aware of the situation in Danyang Continent during this period of time?” Blood Thunder King made the opening remark.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Danyang Continent is very calm during this time except for Sword Alliance who has been discontented. The situation has not changed much from before.”

“Very calm? Alliance Master Su Han, are you trying to fool around with little kids?” Blood Thunder King sneered, “The current Danyang Continent is like a raging storm. Drastic changes may happen at any time and the source of this storm is Crimson Stone Fort. Don’t you know, Alliance Master Su Han?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What can I do if I knew about it? It’s your own business no matter what happens in Crimson Stone Fort. What does it have to do with Sword Alliance?” Jian Wushuang commented calmly like he was uninterested.

“It has nothing to do with Sword Alliance? I don’t think so.” Blood Thunder King wore a strange smile.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang looked at Blood Thunder King.

“Alliance Master Su Han, you knew that there are many factions in Crimson Stone Fort and we are fighting incessantly. Among these factions, the factions led by Crimson Stone Fort Master Yin Suer and Grand Elder Yun Shan are very powerful.” Blood Thunder King said.

Jian Wushuang interrupted Blood Thunder King, “Really? As far as I know, there are three powerful factions in Crimson Stone Fort. Besides the factions led by Yin Su’er and Yun Shan, Blood Thunder King yourself is leading another faction that is not weak at all. You can keep the other two major factions in check.”

“Keep them in check?” Blood Thunder King smiled bitterly, “If it’s the usual small fights and conflicts, indeed my faction does not fear them. However, if a big battle breaks out, then my faction is considered weak. After all, the battle mainly relies on the combat power of Grand Ultimate Gods. The Heaven Ultimate Gods can’t do much at all. Well, they can’t do much in the Crimson Stone Official Army which is under my control.”

“And in terms of the combat power of Grand Ultimate Gods, I have ten of them and it seems like a lot of them under my command, but both Yin Su’er and Yun Shan have accumulated power in the dark for a long time. They are much better than me. I don’t know for sure how much stronger Yin Su’er and Yun Shan are at this stage. Besides, they are both Peak Grand Ultimate Gods with the strongest combat power, they are not people whom I can afford to challenge.”

“Therefore, if a battle breaks out, my faction is far behind the two of them. Therefore, they would be the two people who would reintegrate the factions if there is a major change in Crimson Stone Fort. However, no matter which of them is in charge, it’s probably not a good thing for Sword Alliance.”

“Why do you think so?” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at the Blood Thunder King.

“It’s very simple. It’s all because of your Sword Alliance background.” Blood Thunder King smiled strangely, “Alliance Master Su Han, don’t pretend like you’re confused now. If I guess it right, you came from the Outer Realm? You probably have support from the Outer Realm all this while.”

“How do you know?” Jian Wushuang frowned, he thought Blood Thunder King was funny to make the assumption.

‘Why would the Outer Realm support him?’

What a joke. Jian Wushuang had always been working purely on his own. Yin Su’er probably gave him a little help, but he gave Yin Su’er much more in return.

Blood Thunder King had obviously misunderstood Jian Wushuang.

“It’s very simple. The rise of the Sword Alliance is too fast and you all have too many resources. How could you possibly be able to own so many resources? There must be a big force behind you. I believe no one in the entire Danyang Holy Domain has the ability to support a top force like yours. Naturally, only those Outer Realms with an Undying Saint in their management have the ability to support you.” Blood Thunder King smiled, he was pleased with himself.

“Well, I admit that I do have the support of someone behind me, but what does it have to do with the internal conflicts in Crimson Stone Fort?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course it matters.” Blood Thunder King smiled, “Alliance Master Su Han, if I can guess your background right, I believe Yin Su’er, Yun Shan and the other top forces like Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan can do the same. Those in power would naturally be disgusted and repulsive at you who have the support from an external force. The reason why they haven’t acted on your Sword Alliance right now is that the timing is wrong. Crimson Stone Fort will be ending our years of internal conflicts real soon and the top forces like Nanwu Palace are coveting us. That’s why no one has time for Sword Alliance at this point in time.”

“But once the battle is over and Crimson Stone Fort has calmed down, Crimson Stone Fort will immediately attack you Sword Alliance no matter who is in charge. Even the top forces like Nanwu Palace would join hands to go against you. At that instance, unless the Undying Saint behind you comes out in person, your Sword Alliance will have no ability to resist and you’d be expelled from the Danyang Holy Domain.”

“Well, that’s true.” Jian Wushuang nodded pretentiously.

“But now, there is a great opportunity in front of you, Alliance Master Su Han. You can change the fate of Sword Alliance completely. I wonder if you’re willing to grab the opportunity?” Blood Thunder King smiled strangely.
