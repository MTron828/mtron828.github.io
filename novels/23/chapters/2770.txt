Chapter 2771: Man in Blood-colored Robe

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang believed that Strange Old Tong’s strength was definitely stronger than that of the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet he was controlling and that his attacking power was stronger than Divine Demons Sect Master, Dong Shen.

Earlier when Sword Alliance and Divine Demon Sect were fighting, Dong Shen was a handful for Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang deployed the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and used his domain oppression methods, yet he barely suppressed Dong Shen’s combat capability. Anyone with Peak Grand Ultimate God’s highest combat power could bring great pressure to Sword Alliance.

“Strange Old Tong is definitely not weak among the Peak Grand Ultimate Gods. In fact, he is quite a powerful one. Although the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet is a corpse puppet, it has the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God. In that case, Sword Alliance has two manpower of the highest combat power. And I could count as one too, right?” Jian Wushuang scratched his nose.

He did not display his full potential during the fight with Divine Demon Sect but his combat power was definitely at the level of a High-level Grand Ultimate God and he was ranked one of the top.

After all, he killed Saber Master in the Secret Realm.

Decades had passed since then and his cultivation realm had risen to another level as well as his understanding of laws and sword principles and his methods.

He possessed the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God.

Sword Alliance would have had three cultivators with the most powerful combat powers.

That was a scary fact.

The four top forces— Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower, Divine Demon Sect, and Dongfang Clan— each had only one highest combat power, a Peak Grand Ultimate God.

Even Crimson Stone Fort had only two under different factions, but Sword Alliance had three Peak Grand Ultimate God levels of combat power...

“Strange Old Tong, I have been working on an interesting chess game. If you are free, how about you come and have a look?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“Chess game?”

Strange Old Tong was surprised but he followed Jian Wushuang back to the manor nonetheless.

Under a big tree in the manor, Jian Wushuang placed a huge chess board on the stone table, and there were many chess pieces on the chessboard.

However, those chess pieces were only in one color, which was black.

“This chess game...”

Strange Old Tong began to delve into the game. After some time, he raised his brows slightly. “This game is a test. Every single chess piece is a test to be solved one after another? And the method of cracking these tests seems to be purely relying on sword techniques?”

“Whoa, you noticed it at a glance. This chess game was created by a cultivator from my hometown. It is called Daluo Star Game. I tried to crack it when I was younger and I reaped a lot of benefit from it. Now, my understanding of sword principles has already surpassed that cultivator from my hometown so I have recreated this game. Every chess piece contains a sword move to work on. Over the years, I have been working on this game and I have also gained a lot of benefit from it.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“I’m not good at sword techniques but you got me interested. I might try my hands on these.” Strange Old Tong smiled and he started to crack the game.

It was true that Strange Old Tong was not good at sword techniques but he had a high level of understanding of principles and that was helpful across many areas. He managed to crack a few steps but soon he fell into a bottleneck and was stuck.

Jian Wushuang sat by the side, just smiling and watching Strange Old Tong.

Suddenly...

Swoosh!

A figure appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

It was Xiao Tiexin, Jian Wushuang’s maid.

“Xin’er, what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Jian Wushuang had been cultivating in seclusion for years and Xiao Tiexin was the one dealing with all the management matters in Sword Alliance. Jian Wushuang trusted Xiao Tiexin fully.

“Master, someone is asking to meet you outside the Sword Castle,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Who?” Jian Wushuang sounded uninterested.

“I don’t know, he doesn’t want to tell us his name and identity, but he has shown his breath of aura. He is a High-level Grand Ultimate God, quite a powerful one,” Xiao Tiexin said.

“A powerful High-level Grand Ultimate God, but unwilling to reveal his name and identity is here to see me?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows and then smiled. “Bring him in.”

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin responded and went off to bring the visitor in.

“Strange Old Tong, I guess I’m the only one who knows that you have broken through to the Peak Grand Ultimate God realm. Don’t expose your strength for the time being and disguise your breath of aura,” Jian Wushuang said.

Strange Old Tong breaking through to the Peak Grand Ultimate God realm was equivalent to Sword Alliance acquired another ace in the hole. Naturally, Jian Wushuang would not want the secret advantage to be known just yet.

Especially when things were at a delicate stage.

“Sure, but I’m not good with the disguise so I might be able to cheat those High-level Grand Ultimate Gods but not the powerful Peak Grand Ultimate Gods,” said Strange Old Tong.

“Then don’t meet with those Peak Grand Ultimate Gods. You will stay in Sword Alliance during this time and I believe that no Peak Grand Ultimate God will be so boring to come here and investigate your cultivation realm,” said Jian Wushuang.

“That’s true.” Strange Old Tong smiled and quickly masked his breath of aura.

Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Tong waited quietly in the manor and it did not take long for Xiao Tiexin to lead a man in a man in a blood-colored robe.

The man in a blood-colored robe was well covered up. His face was completely shrouded under the blood-colored robe and no one could see his appearance clearly.

Indeed, he had a tyrannical breath of aura.

He was one of the best among the High-level Grand Ultimate God, probably no inferior to Strange Old Tong before his breakthrough.

“He is...”

Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Tong both stared quizzically at the person.

The blood-colored robe man arrived in front of Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Tong but he did not immediately speak. His exposed deep-set eyes glanced at Xiao Tiexin next to him.

“Xin Er, you may go first.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin nodded and left instantly.

“I don’t know who you are, please show me who you are,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

The man in a blood-colored robe stood in front of Jian Wushuang and looked around to confirm that there was no one else around, then he slowly removed his blood-colored robe, revealing an extremely strong and sturdy figure. He was dark and he had strong muscles. The surface of his divine body was covered with faint blood-colored thunderbolts.

He raised his head slightly to show an extremely cold and somewhat domineering face.

A faint blood-colored thunderbolt flashed in each of his pupils.

Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Tong were both taken aback to see who it was.

“Blood Thunder King!”
