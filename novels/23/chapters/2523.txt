Chapter 2524: Nine Thousand Primordial Stones

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Xiao Tiexin knew the Eighteen Prefectures well and also had informed Jian Wushuang on each of the Eighteen Prefectures’ strengths.

After listening to Xiao Tiexin, Jian Wushuang had to admit the Eighteen Prefectures were indeed very strong!

The Eighteen Prefectures were equivalent to 18 powerhouses with each of them being extremely powerful and had at least one High-Level Ultimate God.

The Demonic Moon Prefecture had one High-Level Ultimate God and eight Primary-Level Ultimate Gods which was a strong lineup but was still ranked lowest among the Eighteen Prefectures.

The other prefectures had two to three High-Level Ultimate Gods and more than ten Primary-Level Ultimate Gods. They were definitely much stronger than Demonic Moon Prefecture.

Besides that, the three strongest prefectures among all were each headed by a Peak Ultimate God.

“Individually, each of them might not be a big deal, but if those Eighteen Prefectures united as one, there will be nearly two hundred Ultimate Gods, twenty to thirty High-Level Ultimate Gods, and three Peak Ultimate Gods. No wonder despite their despicable reputation, they were able to stand strong in the Dark Thunder Territory for so many years. They will be fine on their own as long as they aren’t stupid enough to offend the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord or any other top clans from Northern Darkstar Territory.”

Even the Xiao clan at its peak dared not mess with the Eighteen Prefectures.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

However, he did not care too much in his heart.

He was not afraid of the Eighteen Prefectures, even though many powerful clans in Northern Darkstar Territory preferred to stay out of the Eighteen Prefectures’ way.

His opponent could not do much against him as long as he was careful not to expose his identity. He was currently a lone ranger with both his parents—Zhuo Bing and Zhuo Peng—being far away in the Wusha Wilderness after all.

He had nothing to fear.

Usually, lone experts were the leaders in many forces.

“Mr. Jian Yi, the Heaven Poison Prefecture’s nest is right in front.” Xiao Tiexin abruptly stopped.

Jian Wushuang raised his head. He could sense noises and movements in front of him from where the nest apparently was.

“The Heaven Poison Prefecture is ranked at the bottom of the Eighteen Prefectures just like the Demonic Moon Prefecture. There’s only one High-Level Ultimate God, but ten Primary-Level Ultimate Gods,” Jian Wushuang murmured. That was the entire message he obtained from Xiao Tiexin regarding them.

“Mr. Jian Yi, are you really going to do something against the Heaven Poison Prefecture?” Xiao Tiexin furrowed her brows tightly.

“You don’t need to be with me this time, just wait outside.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently. His figure soon advanced toward Heaven Poison Prefecture.

Rumbling...

Heaven and Earth shook as the golden divine power ocean once again swept out.

In just a split moment, a huge Golden Prison appeared.

The Golden Prison had completely enshrouded the Heaven Poison Prefecture.

Xiao Tiexin quietly stood waiting in the void not far from the Golden Prison. Although she could not see what happened in the Golden Prison, Xiao Tiexin could guess it and even imagined the scene of Jian Wushuang killing mercilessly in the Golden Prison.

She knew the Heaven Poison Prefecture was about to end with Jian Wushuang had also completely offended the Eighteen Prefectures.

As expected, the Golden Prison faded away and Jian Wushuang slowly stepped out.

The once boisterous Heaven Poison Prefectures had also fallen into dead silence with no more noises coming from it in the future.

Xiao Tiexin let out a sigh and silently shook her head.

She never thought that Jian Wushuang was too cruel or harsh. After all, Jian Wushuang was doing the world some good by extirpating these bandits.

Those extremely cruel bandits looted cultivators who happened to be around the area and should have long been killed.

She was just feeling a little emotional and shocked at the course of events.

“Heaven Poison Prefecture is now destroyed. What’s next?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“Underworld Prefecture,” said Jian Wushuang resolutely.

Xiao Tiexin raised her brows and guided Jian Wushuang.

The Eighteen Prefectures were located in the central area of Dark Thunder Territory. They were rather close to each other with the furthest being only a few days away.

Jian Wushuang first went to the Demonic Moon Prefecture followed by Heaven Poison Prefecture and Underworld Prefecture under Xiao Tiexin’s guidance. It took less than ten days for him to completely destroy those three prefectures.

Three out of the Eighteen Prefectures were wiped out in less than ten days.

The entire Dark Thunder Territory was in an uproar after news got out.

...

On an ordinary-looking glade...

Xiao Tiexin laid out the Interspatial Rings in front of them and carefully counted. She finally announced after a long time, “I’ve carefully listed them out for you. In addition, I’ve also made a rough valuation. These resources and treasures in the Interspatial Rings are valued at around one hundred and seventy thousand Primordial Stones. It might be a bit more than, but not by a lot.”

“One hundred and seventy thousand? Are you so sure?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Of course, I’ve been helping in our clan’s largest store before the Xiao clan was exterminated. I know around ninety-nine percent of those resources and treasures in these Interspatial Rings along with their market values. It’s not bad to have accumulated one hundred and seventy thousand,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang nodded. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Indeed, 170,000 Primordial Stones was a huge amount of money. Not even prominent clans in the Northern Darkstar Territory would take that amount lightly. Jian Wushuang had gained so much after destroying the Demonic Moon Prefecture, Heaven Poison Prefecture, and Underworld Prefecture. It was the wealth accumulated by three prefectures over a span of many years.

“Don’t be too happy that you have these valuable resources and treasures. If you take these and sell them at the shops, I doubt there are any shops in the Northern Darkstar Territory which are able to produce that many Primordial Stones at once. Even if there are shops which could and are willing to do it, you might be targeted once you leave. Such a huge amount of Primordial Stones would be tempting to any clans or sects,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang said, “I understand. I’ll put these resources and treasures in the Interspatial Rings for the time being. Once I have the chance or I’m powerful enough, I’ll exchange them for Primordial Stones. At this point in time, I’ve collected nearly ninety thousand Primordial Stones which will last me for some time.”

Apart from the various resources and treasures worth 170,000 Primordial Stones, he had collected nearly 96,000 Primordial Stones after annihilating the three prefectures.

After returning 6,000 to Xiao Tiexin, he had about 90,000 Primordial Stones remaining!

At Jian Wushuang’s stone refinement speed, it would take approximately one month to use all of it.

After careful consideration, Jian Wushuang doubted whether he could even progress to Peak Divine Demon Realm after refining those Primordial Stones.
