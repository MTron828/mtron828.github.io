Hong!

Both parties continued to fight again.

However, it was different then. Great Emperor Zi Xu were suppressed by Lord Spirit Sound. There was only Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze left.

Jian Wushuang sent Jian Yi to keep Great Emperor Colored Glaze occupied.

As for Abysmal Saint Master, Jian Wushuang had dealt with him with the assistance of the five godly spirits!

“Previously, it was only myself and I was not your match. But now...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. At the same time, the first ancient star in between his eyebrows immediately broke.

Among the seven ancient stars, he had only broken one. It was nothing as it was quite easy to recover it.

With the breaking of the ancient star, Jian Wushuang’s overall power instantly increased tremendously. In addition to that, he had the five godly spirits with him.

Besides, Lord Spirit Sound who already suppressed Great Emperor Zi Xu, as she suppressed Great Emperor Zi Xu, she could perform some sickle light occasionally to the surrounding battlefield. That gave some Jian Wushuang some assistance.

“Fight!”

Jian Wushuang was billowing with murderous intention and they fought with Abysmal Saint Master directly.

Then, Abysmal Saint Master wasn’t as relaxed as before.

It would be impossible if he wanted to trap Jian Wushuang as easily.

“D*mn it. My power had yet to reach my peak status. Alone, it would be impossible for me to take Jian Wushuang down!” Abysmal Saint Master’s face grew grave and he couldn’t help but steal a glance at the battlefield by the side. He realized that Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s situation was quite similar to his.

As for Great Emperor Zi Xu, it was one-sided.

“Where did Jian Wushuang find such powerful assistants?” Abysmal Saint Master was roaring in his head.

Previously, he had had the terrifying Emperor Thirteen to help him.

Now Jian Wushuang had another Great Emperor expert who was only stronger, not weaker, than when he was at his peak.

How long had Jian Wushuang lived for? How could he be that capable?

“We’re in big trouble!”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked cold as he looked around, “With the assistance of that person, the three of us couldn’t even lay a foot in Green Fire World, let alone conquering Green Fire World.”

That was true. The three of them were held back entirely.

It was impossible to barge into Green Fire World.

On top of that, one should know that the news about Green Fire World had spread all over.

Although the three of them had rushed there, the speed of other experts from various forces absolutely wouldn’t be any slower.

As long as they couldn’t conquer Green Fire World at the first instant, it would be difficult for them to achieve the greatest advantage.

As expected, the experts from Eternal Chaotic World arrived in a short while.

Those who rushed over were merely three ordinary Sir Gods. They were closer to Green Fire World and they rushed over when they had found out about the existence of Green Fire World.

When they arrived, they saw Green Fire World and they also saw a shocking battle!”

“My goodness, this, this is...”

“Great Emperors, there are so many Great Emperors?”

“Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zi Xu and Great Emperor Colored Glaze, also the infamous Sword Emperor, his sword servant became a Great Emperor as well?! As for the enchanting woman in the red robe, I don’t know her but she is powerful. She could even suppress Great Emperor Zi Xu directly?”

“What are they doing? Why are they fighting?”

The few Sir Gods were astonished but mostly confused.

Very soon, they spread the news about the war.

Most of the experts from various forces that were rushing over to Green Fire World were shocked at the news and they traveled at an even faster speed.

On the battlefield, regardless of if it was the three Great Emperors or those from Jian Wushuang’s side, they noticed the surrounding experts.

Jian Wushuang didn’t care much.

However, Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s faces grew grave.

They knew that it might be only a few Sir Gods who had arrived but in no time, there would be more experts. Even, in the end, the entire Sanctuary Alliance or the entire Eternal Chaotic World would be there.

That was fact.

There were more and more experts gathering around Green Fire World. Most of them were Sir Gods and Emperor Gods.

In no time, rumble. A vast figure descended from the sky and there was an aura of Great Emperor level that spread.

“Purple Moon?”

“It’s Great Emperor Purple Moon!”

Every expert was impressed.

Experts from both parties were fighting a battle and they noticed the arrival of Great Emperor Purple Moon.

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zi Xu and Great Emperor Colored Glaze were unhappy. But as Great Emperor Purple Moon had already arrived, it would be impossible if the three of them wanted to conquer Green Fire World first. The three of them immediately stopped.

“Why? Don’t you want to continue the fight?” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold as he glared at the three Great Emperors.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re just lucky. You got help from all the experts all the time,” Abysmal Saint Master said coldly and he couldn’t help but look at Lord Spirit Sound.

Until then, Lord Spirit Sound had seemed to be extremely at ease all this while. He wondered if she had really revealed all her power.

Regardless, whatever power she displayed would be enough to gain Abysmal Saint Master’s attention.

“Humph, being able to get help from experts is my skill as well,” Jian Wushuang replied coldly.

Even though they had stopped fighting, both parties were still oppositional.

“Everyone, please calm down.”

Great Emperor Purple Moon walked over and said with a curious look as he watched both parties, “What’s going on?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What’s going on? Ask Jian Wushuang,” Abysmal Saint Master said coldly, “He carries a big secret with him.”

“Big secret?” Great Emperor Purple Moon was confused.

“It seems that Purple Moon has yet to know. Let me tell you, Green Fire World is Jian Wushuang’s hometown. When I found out Green Fire World’s unique point, I wanted to check it out at Green Fire World at the first instant. But in the end, he chased me out. I had no choice and asked Abysmal and Zi Xu to come along with me. But in the end... Hehe, you saw that yourself,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze smiled coldly.

The moment Great Emperor Colored Glaze said that, everyone at the scene was stunned.

There were gazes that were redirected to Jian Wushuang in shock.

Green Fire World was Jian Wushuang’s hometown?

Was it a joke?

Looking at the gazes that flew to him, Jian Wushuang had no intention of hiding. He replied, “Yes, Green Fire World is really my hometown. As such, without my permission, don’t even think about entering Green Fire World!”

All experts at the scene went quiet when they heard that.

Even Great Emperor Purple Moon’s face changed.

If Green Fire World was really as magical as the rumor said and had limitless possibilities, Sanctuary Alliance definitely would try to figure a way to conquer it. Then, make some changes to make Green Fire World a brand new sanctuary. In other words, Sanctuary Alliance would take control of everything there.

However, Green Fire World was Jian Wushuang’s hometown...
