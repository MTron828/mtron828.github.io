RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Above the Void, no one could decipher the white-clothed woman Leng Ruxue’s reaction due to her veil, but her brows showed nothing but mockery.The Ancient Era experts started talking amongst each other.

They knew they owed it to Leng Ruxue.

Leng Ruxue with her Heavenly Body was the Lineal Disciple if that Master of Holy Land back at the Absolute Beginning Divine World, and that Master treated her with incomparable importance.

The reason why the Master of Holy Land would sacrifice so much to open the link passage was only to bring Leng Ruxue back!

The Ancient Era experts simply hitch-hiked.

Since the link passage was already open, they felt they might as well bring everyone back.

“Seems like you all are aware,” Bing Shan looked around and smiled. “Lord Leng is the reason why the link passage will open. If Lord Leng’s stuck here, do you really think you will be able to return to the Absolute Beginning Divine World?”

“Even if you do, what do you think the Master will do to you?” Bing Shan’s words shocked many.

It was what they had been worrying about.

The main purpose was to bring Leng Ruxue over to the Absolute Beginning Divine World. If they left her and departed, they would definitely suffer the wrath of the Master.

The Ancient Era experts made their decision.

Figures gradually approached from the edges of the Void.

In an instant, they had surrounded Jian Wushuang at the centre.

The Ancient Era experts had their eyes all fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor, we should not go over your personal grievances with Lord Leng, but since it is only due to her that we can leave.... you know what I mean,” a magnificent voice came from Chen Qi.

Chen Qi had followed Old Monster Jiao to attack Thunderbolt Island but had been obliterated by Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

Jian Wushuang’s powers struck fear into Chen Qi as well.

But despite that, he was in no position to back down.

Previously, it had been to return Old Monster Jiao a favour, but now it was for the smooth departure from the land!

The other Ancient Era experts felt similarly.

“Sword Emperor, we are not willing to be your enemies, but we have no choice.”

“After so many years of slumber, if I don’t take this chance to escape, I will die in my sleep. Keeping Lord Leng here means keeping all of us here.”

“Sword Emperor, we hope you can make the right decision.”

“Sword Emperor, please don’t push us down that road...”

Threatening words came from their mouths one by one.

The Ancient Era experts were all determined.

As they had said, keeping Lord Leng would be to keep all of them there.

They would never agree to that.

Xiu!

A figure appeared beside Jian Wushuang, it was Emperor Bai.

“Jian Wushuang, what should we do?” Emperor Bai frowned as he glanced at all the Ancient Era experts.

With Jian Wushuang and Bing Shan, he did not interfere. But he would certainly not back down knowing that everyone was targeting Jian Wushuang.

“They are right, blocking Leng Ruxue would be to block all of them, pushing them to a dead end. But letting Leng Ruxue would be pushing me to a dead end as well,” Jian Wushuang was determined.

He needed no second thoughts.

He made his decision before arriving at Heaven’s Horizon.

And once a decision was made, Jian Wushuang would not waver.

“I said, I need to stay here regardless of the price!”

“No one can stop me.”

That cold voice resonated across the land.

Leng Ruxue’s mockery grew more intense as she revealed a playful smile under her veil.

The Ancient Era experts’ eyes turned bloodshot.

“Don’t blame us, Sword Emperor!” Chen Qi’s voice was eerie cold. “Let’s take him down!”

“Die!” the Ancient Era experts did not hesitate.

Without Bing Shan, there were still 138 Ancient Era experts. At that moment, all 138 were charging towards Jian Wushuang from all directions.

“Hngh!” Emperor Bai snorted, as the shimmering enormous golden emperor appeared behind him.

At that moment, a golden-armoured figure appeared around him.

He had used both the Nine Star Armour and Punisher God.

Jian Wushuang gazed upon the incoming Ancient Era experts.

Although most of them were Chaotic Divine Demons, hitting Third Stage Great Emperor fighting powers at most, there were ten-odd experts beyond Chaotic Divine Demon like Chen Qi and Old Monster Jiao. Each of them was at Half Step Divine Demon levels.

“Those in my way, prepare to meet your fate!” Jian Wushuang was furious as he pulled out his Blood Mountain Sword beaming with Crimson Light.

A terrifying aura oppressed the entire area.

War had broken out!

“Crap!” the Great Emperors of the Eternal Chaotic World all witnessed it from a Void not too far away.

When they saw the Ancient Era experts charge towards Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai, their faces changed dramatically.

But no matter how anxious they were, there was nothing much they could do.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai had instructed them not to make any rash decisions.

After all, they were only First Stage and Second Stage Great Emperors, sending them to Ancient Era experts would be asking them to die.
