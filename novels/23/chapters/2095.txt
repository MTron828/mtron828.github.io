Chapter 2096 Emotions

“It’s over! The Black Dragon Clan is going to be destroyed!”

Many of the experts within the Black Dragon Clan were in despair.

They had given up all hope.

The Black Dragon Emperor was enraged upon seeing her people fear for the worst. “What are you afraid of? Even if we are going to die, don’t make their lives easy! Attack!”

The aura of Black Dragon Emperor boiled as she battled Ba Su once again.

Even though the experts from the Black Dragon Clan looked gloomy, they fought on madly.

The Black Dragon Clan was a clan with the bloodline of the ancient water dragon. They were

bloodthirsty and crazy by nature.

Their bloodthirst and craziness were further stimulated as they were in this desperate situation.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!!”

The experts from the Black Dragon Clan got desperate and fought with the mentality that they were going to die.

With this, the Sky Swallowing Clan and the Acheron Palace suffered great losses.

“Humph. What a waste of time. I want to see how long you can last.” Ba Su said coldly. “As for you, die!” He said to the Black Water Dragon Emperor.

A terrifying killing intent radiated from Ba Su as he finally decided to fight with his full strength.

“Haha. Bring it on!!”

A glint of ferocity flashed across the eyes of the Black Dragon Emperor as she continued her onslaught with Ba Su.

Even though she was trying her best, the difference in power level was obvious.

A great emperor who relied on the bloodline power to barely reach stage two was no match for a top tier stage-two great emperor.

A golden claw smashed onto the holy body of the Black Dragon Emperor.

“Puff”

The Black Dragon Emperor spat out a mouthful of blood. She retreated a great distance as her aura diminished. After she had steadied herself, she continued the fight without hesitation,

“Humph. I do not want to waste any more time.”

Ba Su said as his body transformed.

He transformed from a human into a giant golden bat. That was his original form.

The golden bat had golden irises which stared at the Black Dragon Emperor intently.

“Screech!!”

A shrill scream pierced through the battlefield and reverberated through the air.

An extremely powerful soul attack was hidden within this screech.

This move was used by Ba Su during the battle with Jian Wushuang during his coronation ceremony.

The Black Dragon Emperor was already seriously injured. There was a brief moment she lost her conscious when the soul attack hit her. Hum!! Hum~~

Ba Su attacked at the moment the Black Dragon Emperor lost her a conscious.

“Golden Lightning Elemental Barrier!”

Boom!

Waves of golden light the size of a water bucket flew towards the Black Dragon Emperor.

Each wave of golden light was surrounded with golden lighting which seem to be able to destroy everything.

Each wave of golden lighting was perfectly fused with the golden light as the combination appeared in front of the Black Dragon Emperor.

The Black Dragon Emperor had just regained conscious when she saw the waves of light appear in front of her. She had no time to react and block the attack.

The energy contained in this golden bolt of light made her fearful as she sensed crisis.

Without a doubt, she would either die or be gravely injured if she was hit by this attack.

“Is this the end?” The Black Dragon Emperor roared. Her unwillingness to die made her turn mad.

At that moment, an overbearing wave of soul power rose.

At that moment, the Black Dragon Emperor decided to use her final trump card.

Soul Ignition!

She decided to use this final crazy move so as to try and strive for the biggest possibility for her clan to survive.

Ba Su iris contracted as she saw the eyes of the Black Dragon Emperor turned blood red. He knew what she was about to do and moved backwards slightly.

Right when she was about to completely activate Soul Ignition, she heard a voice.

“Black Dragon Emperor!!!”

A voice cried out suddenly and rang in her ears.

She shook visibly as she stopped what she was about to do.

She turned around and saw a figure at the end of the horizon.

The size of the figure was small compared to the larger people in her clan. It was considered a small dot.

However, this figure had appeared when she needed it the most. Instantly, she was filled with hope.

The madness she had had disappeared.

Whoosh!

Even though the figure was quite a distance away from her, he took only two steps to close this distance and appeared in front of the Black Dragon Emperor. At this point of time, the waves of golden light were right before the Black Dragon Emperor and it was too late for the figure to do anything to stop it.

However, the figure did not even try to stop it. He simply stood there in front of the Black Dragon Emperor and allowed the waves of golden light crash into his strong holy body.

Boom!

A thunderous boom break through the air as the horrifying aura erupted in all directions. The entire space turned into a world-ending storm.

In the middle of the storm, the figure stood and allowed the storm of diving power to gush past him. Behind him was the Black Dragon Emperor, who was not harmed by the waves of golden light.

The strongest move that Ba Su had in his arsenal, these dreadful waves of golden light, had been stopped by the power of his holy body.

His holy body was completely unharmed by the impact!!!

“This, this…” The Black Dragon Emperor looked at the figure who had saved her during the time of crisis in disbelief.

She had already recognized the figure. It was the new Ancient God Emperor!

It was him that had appeared in front of her and saved her from that deadly attack.

“He… saved me?” The Black Dragon Emperor muttered to herself. The surprise in her eyes slowly turned into something else. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Something else uncharacteristic of her.

The Black Dragon Emperor was the leader of her clan for many years. She had always been looked up to as the strongest person in the Black Water Dragon Clan and every single member of the clan respected her greatly.

She forgot how this felt. She had thought she would never feel emotions like this anymore.

However, now…
