“Lin Dong, although the commander let us give Jian Wushuang more chances to practice, it’ll be too hard for him to fight Universe Master Bei!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Mo You looked at Lin Dong and said, “Universe Master Bei is the first Universe God in Red Water Alliance. Based on his strength, only you, the top Divine General in Scarlet Island, are able to defeat him. Jian Wushuang just left his hometown and hasn’t got enough experience to battle with Invincible Universe Masters. It’s a joke for him to fight Universe Master Bei.”

“Isn’t that even better?” Lin Dong laughed. “He just left his hometown and hasn’t met any ideal opponents. Now, he is too proud, so I want to teach him a lesson. In the Eternal Chaotic World, there are thousands of experts. When we just got here, the commander also challenged us a lot, didn’t he?”

“That’s true.” Mo You nodded, “In this case, let him learn a lesson first, but we need to be cautious. If he can’t keep up, then we need to take the action. Otherwise… if he is killed by Universe Master Bei, we will be in a big trouble.”

“Don’t worry, everything is under control” Lin Dong was very confident.

While Lin Dong and Mo You were supervising, Jian Wushuang flew into the city.

“Invincible Universe Master.”

Jian Wushuang stared at Universe Master Bei who was in the battle. His eyes turned cold, “Lin Dong is right. Before when I stayed in the Green Fire World, although I fought the experts from the Jin Kingdom, I indeed lacked killing experience. It’s time for me to practice!”

“Although Universe Master Bei is a Universe Master, his sledgehammer skills and unique skills are barely acceptable for me to practice my swordsmanship.”

Jian Wushuang made a decision in his mind.

He would conceal his strength and only rely on his swordsmanship in the fierce battle. When it was the right moment, then he would quickly kill him.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang showed up in the center of the battlefield.

“The bastard from Scarlet Island, go to hell!”

Universe Master Bei’s eyes were scarlet, and his face looked evil and horrible. His scarlet sledgehammer madly smashed out. Many Universe Master around him were already dead. When Jian Wushuang appeared, he did not even pay attention and smashed his hammer towards him.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted and exploded with Universe Master power, waving his Blood Mountain Sword.

Without any swordsmanship, the sword collided with the sledgehammer.

Snap!

Following the explosion, a Scarlet Thunderbolt shot out from his sledgehammer. It flew to a pavilion, and the pavilion was smashed to pieces instantly.

After retreating for dozens of meters, Universe Master Bei raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Invincible Universe Master.”

“You are the Divine General from Scarlet Island?”

Universe Master Bei stared at Jian Wushuang with his cold eyes and groaned, “There are six Divine Generals in the Scarlet Island, but I haven’t met you. Who are you?”

“Jian Wushuang, the Seventh Divine General in the Scarlet Island!” Jian Wushuang answered.

“The Seventh Divine General?” Universe Master Bei instantly realized that Jian Wushuang had just become a Divine General. He was furious and roared, “A new Divine General who dares to challenge me alone is asking for death!”

As his voice died, Universe Master Bei suddenly stepped out.

Unlike when he was killing the sergeants, Universe Master Bei exploited his full strength when he realized Jian Wushuang was an Invincible Universe Master.

Grand aura emitted from his body, full of endless killing. It turned to a dark cloud and enveloped Jian Wushuang.

The oppressive force was absolutely enough to make an ordinary Universe Master feel scared. Even a Peak Universe Master would feel terrified. However, when Jian Wushuang was under this pressure, he looked calm. When Universe Master Bei was coming towards him, he immediately joined the battle.

“Little kid, go to hell!”

Universe Master Bei was full of Killing Intent, and his scarlet scarlet sledgehammer turned to a scarlet Thunderbolt.

The Scarlet Thunderbolt flew through the Void and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang waved, and then his Blood Mountain Sword turned into a beam of Flowing Light.

Clang!

These two attacks collided, and an anti-shock force was sent to Jian Wushuang, forcing him to frown.

“This Universe Master Bei is quite strong,”?Jian Wushuang chuckled inwardly, but his power then skyrocketed, and he exploded with power.

Ten percent…

Jian Wushuang owned the Inverse Cultivation of combining three strongest Sword Principles. Also, he was the Four-star Peak Ancient God from the Imperial Kinsmen. Without using the Blood-killing Plate Armor, his strength could already compete with the ordinary Universe Gods. Even only using ten percent of his strength still made him slightly better than Invincible Universe Masters.

Bang!

His swordsmanship exploded.

Universe Master Bei was still very arrogant. His scarlet sledgehammer turned into lightning and started the attack again.

These two people were having the war in this city. The strong power flew out and terrified the sergeants and experts. Soon, they all ran away.

Outside the city, Lin Dong and Mo You who had been waiting there were shocked when they witnessed this.

“Didn’t he just leave his hometown? Didn’t he have no experience in battling with Invincible Universe Masters?” Mo You was stunned. She knew how strong the Universe Master Bei was. Ordinary Universe Master were not match for him, not even her.

But now…

“Jian Wushuang is able to fight Universe Master Bei?” Lin Dong frowned, “Universe Master Bei’s power is far stronger than an ordinary Invincible Universe Masters’. How is Jian Wushuang able to confront him?”

Lin Dong had fought Universe Master Bei before, and he was only slightly better than Universe Master Bei.

However, he had used his speed and skill to win.

Universe Master Bei was good at strength, and Lin Dong knew he was not as good as his, but now Jian Wushuang dared to confront him and still was not defeated?

In the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and Universe Master Bei had a half-hour fierce battle with no sign of defeat.

Jian Wushuang also noticed that the Universe Master Bei was already exploiting his full strength.

“He has done the best, but still can’t force me to use more strength?” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“The game is over!”

Jian Wushuang started another attack.
