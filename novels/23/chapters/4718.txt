4719 The Glory of the Three Swords Moves

Chun Qiu, who was in the middle of running, felt as if he had been punched in the head, and his entire body flew out.

As he was sent flying, the earth-shattering power exploded.

As if an ancient bell had been rung, the extremely bright light also lit up.

Chun Qiu was shocked, but he realized that he could not escape from the terrifying shock wave with his own cultivation realm.

At this moment, he felt a gust of wind behind him. It was as if a large palm had firmly supported his body.

Chun Qiu subconsciously looked behind him and saw the Young Emperor, who was still pale and dressed in luxurious clothes, and the purple-robed figure, who had not changed for 10,000 years, standing behind him.

The three of them were enveloped by the immense Yan power, which turned into a barrier to block the terrifying explosion.

“My companion, guess who will win and lose,” the Young Emperor’s expression did not change as he looked forward and said slowly.

The skinny purple-robed man raised his head, his pair of unclear eyes looking towards the center of the explosion. “Cheng Qing has already lost.”

During this simple conversation, the explosion slowly dissipated, and a huge pit of a thousand miles appeared.

On the two sides of the pit, there were two figures.

Jian Wushuang’s face was calm. Only the hem of his black robe seemed to be stained with dust. The Tarot Divine Sword in his hand was trembling.

On the other side, although Cheng Qing’s figure was a bit miserable, the excitement and warlike light in his eyes was getting stronger.

He knew very well that if he had not released his cultivation realm, he would not have been able to withstand Jian Wushuang’s attack with his first move of Sword Intent.

But so what? Today, he was going to try out all of Jian Wushuang’s sword principles and learn them for his own use.

After all, it was almost impossible to meet another person like that ancient Sword Immortal.

A sharp aura surged once again. If Chen Qing’s first sword attack was still in a state of hiding his edge, then now, his edge was fully revealed!

At this moment, Jian Wushuang said two words from afar, “Second Sword.”

Cheng Qing’s eyes focused and a Sword Intent that far exceeded the previous one floated around his body. At the same time, a light wheel that was like the sun appeared behind him!

This time, Cheng Qing was still the first to attack. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A great power rose in an instant. In the light wheel, there were actually tens of thousands of light swords!

As the light wheel spun, the light swords with scarlet-golden patterns smashed toward Jian Wushuang like huge waves.

Jian Wushuang was speechless. He did not understand. Although Chen Qing’s sword principle was not very strong, he should be an existence that could stand proudly in a region.

But now, although the Sword Intent he released was powerful, it was too broad and lacked exquisiteness. As a result, Jian Wushuang could see its weakness at a glance.

The Sword Dao that Chen Qing cultivated was broad, but it was slightly weak in general.

Jian Wushuang floated forward with the Invisible Sword on his back. He faced the wall that was almost made of sword edges and stabbed out.

This was Ding Baiyi’s Extinctive Sword Strike, a sword that abandoned everything, including his own body.

A white light that could not be more subtle flickered, and the seemingly powerless tip of the sword touched the water like a fish in water.

A layer of ripples appeared.

This sword was a mix of 100,000 sword strikes. It pressed forward with indomitable will, a sword strike that was about to kill!

As the ripples rose, the swords were shattered and the light was destroyed.

Chen Qing, who was carrying the light wheel on his back, trembled slightly when the Sword Intent was destroyed.

He seemed to smell a familiar aura, and the memory that was so long ago that it was about to be erased quietly came back to his mind.

The Young Emperor and the skinny purple-robed man beside him could not hide the surprise in their eyes.

As a result, when Jian Wushuang’s sword strike cut off a strand of Chen Qing’s hair, he came back to his senses.

“You are very strong. I have already lost in the Dao of the sword.” A trace of bitterness appeared on Cheng Qing’s face. In the two Sword Intents that he had exchanged in a row, he had lost completely.

Jian Wushuang did not put away the long sword in his hand. Instead, he looked at Chen Qing and smiled. He did not care about Chen Qing’s unfair actions.

“Brother Chen, let’s spar without a winner or loser. We’ll only talk about Sword Dao. If I’m not wrong, you should still have one more sword move.”

Hearing this, Chen Qing’s eyes brightened, but then dimmed again, “Brother Jian, you are right. However, this sword move of mine is still only a framework. It has not been connected.”

“If the way of the sword is not put into practice, then it is just a framework. We must put it to practice,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice. Then, he shook his wrist and the Invisible Longsword made a trembling sound.

Cheng Qing’s eyes were burning, and his desire to battle rose again.

“Then I’ll be embarrassing myself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the True Sword in his hand trembled. The earth trembled and a chasm appeared. Ten dark blue Sword Intents that were like giant pillars that reached the sky tore the ground apart and rose like dragons.

Chen Qing stood in place, the True Sword in his hand pointing to the sky. The ten grand rays of light dyed everything with a layer of dark blue.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and looked forward calmly. Then, he threw the Invisible Sword into the air.

In the next moment, ten dark blue pillars of Sword Intent wrapped around each other and crushed down.

At the same time, the Invisible Sword that had been thrown into the air quietly disintegrated, turning into hundreds of millions of wisps of Sword Intent.

Jian Wushuang put his hands behind his back and the hundreds of millions of Sword Intents gathered under his body like the galaxy in the sky.

The Young Emperor, who was watching from afar, squinted his eyes and seemed to have a faint smile on his lips.

After seeing Jian Wushuang’s Sword Intent, which was even stronger than the previous one, Chen Qing’s extremely nervous eyes were replaced with bitterness.

This was only the framework of the Sword Intent, and it seemed that it would disappear before it was even created.

Jian Wushuang stepped on the Heavenly River Sword Intent, his eyes extremely calm.

As the two of them were about to collide, everything seemed to have stopped for a moment.

There was no earth-shaking sound, only the sound of a clear spring.

Cheng Qing was stunned.

The Sword Intent that belonged to Jian Wushuang disappeared. It disappeared the moment it was about to collide.

The magnificent dark blue Sword Intent exploded in the sky without any resistance.

Everyone subconsciously covered their eyes with their hands for a moment, and then focused on the scene in front of them.

Jian Wushuang had appeared on the ground at some point in time. He pressed his right hand on the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword at his waist and nodded slightly at Chen Qing.

Everyone could clearly see that in this last confrontation, Jian Wushuang had dispersed the Heavenly River Sword Intent on his own and did not contend with it.

This meant that he had fulfilled Cheng Qing’s Sword Dao.

Chen Qing came back to his senses and solemnly cupped his hands at Jian Wushuang, “Thank you, Brother Jian.”

He knew very well that if Jian Wushuang’s Sword Intent had landed, his sword move would have had no chance of winning.
