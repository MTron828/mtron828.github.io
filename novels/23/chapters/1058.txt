Chapter 1059: A Shocking Invitation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly landed in the courtyard. It was an Elder of the Blood Asura Clan.

“Your Highness.”

He approached Su Rou and handed her a gilded invitation. He said respectfully, “An invitation from the Samsara Temple.”

“An Invitation from the Samsara Temple?”

Confused, Su Rou took the letter and opened it. As she was reading, an expression of surprise flashed across her face.

“Sister, what does it say?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Leave us.”

Su Rou sent the Elder away and turned to Jian Wushuang, saying, “It is an invitation from the Samsara Temple, asking us to send an representative for the inauguration ceremony of its new supervisor.”

“Supervisor?” Jian Wushuang asked in confusion, “What is that?”

“The Supervisor of the Samsara Temple is a superb expert who has great power and influence, second only to the Samsara Temple Master. Reincarnators of Rank Eight that are powerful enough to serve as influential Inner Elders must listen to the Supervisor.”

“The Supervior of the Samsara Temple, in a manner of speaking, is their leader.”

“A Supervisor must also be extremely powerful. Only Reincarnators of Rank Nine who have passed the final test are qualified to serve as a the Supervisor. As a result, qualified individuals are extremely rare.”

“The Samsara Temple’s test for Reincarnators becomes more and more difficult as the rank grows. It is already extremely difficult for Reincarnators of Rank Eight, and even Holy Masters are anxious at the tests for Reincarnators of Rank Nine. Only superb Holy Masters are qualified for Rank Nine!”

“The Samsara Temple has been developing in the Samsara Continent for many years and so have its Reincarnators. They’ve been competing with each other on the principle of survival of the fittest. So far, less than five people have become Reincarnators of Rank Nine. The Samsara Temple has only two such Reincarnators, known as its supervisors.”

“So the Samsara Temple is going to have a third supervisor.” Su Rou explained.

After she finished, Jian Wushuang nodded to himself. He recognized the vast strength and power needed to become a supervisor immediately.

In the past, the Samsara Temple had only two Supervisors, both of whom were also superb Holy Masters. Top clans like the Ancient Demon Clan and the Blood Asura Clan held great respect for both in fear of offending them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

None of the experts who recieved an invitation from the third Supervisor would dare refuse.

“The inauguration ceremony for the new supervisor will be held in three days. Brother, you should come with me.” Su Rou said.

“Me?” Jian Wushuang answered and nodded slightly. “The Supevisor is so powerful in the Samsara Temple. When I meet him, perhaps I can ask him the price to help me find my father.”

His father’s position within the Samsara Temple was quite strange. Even Elders like Ding Mo weren’t qualified to know about him, but a Supervisor, who was second only to the Void Temple Master, might have the authority to search for more information.

If the Supervisor agreed to help, he might have a chance of finding his father.

Su Rou also knew of this possibility, which was why she had offered to take him with her.

“I’ll be here in three days.” Jian Wushuang answered with a smile.

“Sounds good.” Su Rou affirmed, nodding her head. “We can’t be the only clan invited to the inauguration ceremony. There will most likely be others and perhaps a few solitary experts as well. I suppose the Ancient Demon Clan and the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory will also be there. You must prepare yourself for that.”

“The Ancient Demon Clan? The Patriarch of Empyrean Glory?” Jian Wushuang smiled wickedly. “The latter had an agreement with me, and with so much attention on us, he wouldn’t dare to break his promise. Even if not willing to let me off, I don’t think he’ll fight me if I don’t provoke him. As for the Ancient Demon Clan… Well, I’ll take anything they throw at me.”

Jian Wushuang was very confident in himself.

120 years ago, he had managed to survive when the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan hunted him down.

120 years later, he was stronger and naturally more confident as well.

Just as Su Rou said, the invitation to the inauguration ceremony in Samsara Temple was sent to many other clans including the Ancient Demon Clan, the Python Clan, the Xue Feng Clan, and other huge forces in the Samsara Continent as well as a number of solitary experts.

All the clans and experts were stunned when they received the invitation.

The Supervisor of the Samsara Temple was extraordinary.

The clans and solitary experts had hardly recieved their invitations before they were already rushing to prepare.

In the Python Clan, one of the four Peak Populations,

“There’s going to be another Supervisor of the Samsara Temple?”

The Clan Leader of the Python Clan demanded of a crowd of experts.

“A Supervisor! That’s much more powerful than an Elder!”

“The Samsara Temple has at least twenty Inner Elders, some of whom were replaced. The two supervisors have remained unchanged for so many years. Now there is going to be the third one. This must be something big!”

“Get prepare some lavish gifts to bring to the ceremony in three days.”

…

In the Xue Feng Clan, another of the four Peak Populations.

“The Supervisors of the Samsara Temple have great power. Even though they often stay out of the concerns of the masses and fights between different clans, their influence is still unparalleled.”

“They can ruin things we’ve worked toward for years with a single word. But, they can also improve us at a snap of their fingers.”

“Now that our clan is the weakest among four the Peak Populations and we failed to create a friendship with the first two Supervisors of the Samsara Temple, we must build a strong relationship with the new Supervisor. Even if we fail to make him like us, we shouldn’t make him angry with us.”

“Three Great Elders and I will set out in three days.”

“A Supervisor?”

The Patriarch of Empyrean Glory also received the invitation from Samsara Temple.

And even he, who is used to being unruly and unrestrained, left for the Divine Monster Territory with two of his Protectors.
