Chapter 894: The Bodhi Fruit

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Seeing the many One-meter Swords floating in front of him, Jian Wushuang was overjoyed. He put them into the Interspatial Ring without any hesitation.

“Each handle is worth one billion and is more powerful than an ordinary Emperor Weapon! 108 One-meter Swords!”?He clasped his hands.?“With these swords, I don’t have to worry about weapons when practising the second and third level of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.”

“Next is your second opportunity.” Lord Spirit Sound spoke again.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked toward her.

The first opportunity was already invaluable. What could the second opportunity be?

“Blood Mountain, you’re a Divine Realm expert now. After leaving Stellar Fog Sea, you’ll soon reach Eternal Realm, which is not difficult for you at all. But after that, it won’t be easy to become a Dao Master.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

He didn’t worry about breaking through the Eternal Realm.

After all, he met the requirements for Eternal Realm a long time ago. In his two hundred years on the Star Island, based on his understanding of the World Dao and Slaughter Dao, he already had a profound comprehension of the nine Occults. If he wanted, he could directly break through with just a little preparation.

Limited by the tests on the Star Island, he had been restraining his Realm and delayed the breakthrough again and again.

But he would definitely do it after leaving Stellar Fog Sea.

However, becoming a Dao Master was not as easy as breaking through the Eternal Realm.

“I have some Bodhi Fruits. You can take them.” The Lord Spirit Sound waved her hand and showed him some white Bodhi Fruits.

“Bodhi Fruits?” Jian Wushuang stared at the Bodhi Fruits in her hand, and detected an extremely strange aura from them.

“The Bodhi Fruits are extraordinary treasures. Here are five of them. Take one for every one thousand years and I guarantee you’ll become a Dao Master within ten thousand years.” The Lord Spirit Sound looked at him, wearing a cold smile.

“To become a Dao Master within ten thousand years?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Of course. The Bodhi Fruit has many usages. It may seem a bit wasteful if you swallow it in directly. If you can, find someone to refine them into Bodhi Dans. One Bodhi Dan is enough to help an Eternal Realm become a Dao Master within a short time.” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“Is the Bodhi Dan so effective?”?Jian Wushuang marvelled. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

To become a Dao Master was so hard in the Eternal World!

They were so rare.

Even in the Tang of the East, Dao Master Level experts were not very common.

The birth of each Dao Master, the top expert in the Eternal World, required years of accumulation. The most important thing was to find one’s own Dao way.

For many years, Jian Wushuang had been meditating under the Star Jade Wall, and had some idea about finding his own Dao way. But it would take a long time before truly opening up.

He had some confidence in his talent and he knew his chances of breaking into the Dao Master in the future were great. But he was not sure how long it would take.

Could the Bodhi Dan really help an expert to reach Dao Master within a short period of time?

If news about the elixir spread out, the countless Eternal Realms in the Eternal World would go crazy about it.

After all, a lot of top level Eternal Realm experts dreamt of becoming Dao Masters.

“These five Bodhi Fruits are the second opportunity for you. They can guarantee you the position of a Dao Master in the future. As to refining them into Bodhi Dans, it totally depends on you.” Lord Spirit Sound let out a faint smile and threw the five Bodhi Fruits to Jian Wushuang.

He took them and carefully put them into the Interspatial Ring.

Putting away the Bodhi Fruits, Jian Wushuang felt relieved. But then he suddenly asked, “Lord Spirit Sound, is there a difference between Dao Masters practised with the help of Bodhi Fruit and those without?”

“Difference? Just a little.” Lord Spirit Sound nodded.

“The function of the Bodhi Fruit or Bodhi Dan is to help you create your own Dao way in the shortest possible time so as to meet the minimum requirement for Dao Masters. The created Dao ways vary in strength. A more powerful Dao way indicates a stronger Dao Master, and vice versa.”

“The Dao ways created with the help of the Bodhi Fruit or Bodhi Dan are usually those weakest ones.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked, “Only the weakest Dao way?”

He was greatly disappointed.

He was ambitious and wanted to be a Dao Master, but was unwilling to become just the most ordinary one.

He would never choose the weakest Dao way unless he had to.

Lord Spirit Sound said,”I give you these treasures just in case. If you have some trouble on the way, you can still become a Dao Master with the help of these Bodhi Fruits. But if everything goes well, you don’t have to rely on them.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, already having his own idea.

If he could become a Dao Master on his own, he wouldn’t use the Bodhi Fruits.

But if there was little hope of becoming a Dao Master on his own strength, he would have to turn to these Bodhi Fruits for help.

“Great. I had already given you two opportunities. It’s time for the third one, which is also the most special one.” Lord Spirit Sound’s face turned grave.

“The third opportunity is invaluable, much more valuable than the previous two combined.”

“Most importantly, it suits you the most. It will be of great help to you and even change your fate.”

“Change my fate?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled, and grew more expectant.

“But I need to mention that I only give you a chance to win this fate-changing opportunity. It depends on your own ability to get it.” Lord Spirit Sound said,

“Only a chance?”?Jian Wushuang complained in his heart, but nodded heavily.

A great opportunity that could change one’s fate was not easy to obtain.

But as long as it can be obtained, it would be of great benefit to him too. Jian Wushuang certainly would not give up such a good chance.

“Follow me.” Lord Spirit Sound uttered these words and then waved again. Another space wormhole appeared before her.

Without a thought, she stepped into the space wormhole directly with Jian Wushuang.
