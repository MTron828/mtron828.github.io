Chapter 206: Real Exceptional Genius

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Void over Sky Valley, the Monarchs of the 12 Dynasties, as well as experts of old sects, kept an eye on what happened below.

When they saw the geniuses of the Cosmos Empire engage in a fierce fight with the team of the Tianzong Dynasty, they could not help but sigh.

“The Tianzong Dynasty is over!”

All of them thought it would happen.

But just a moment later, everyone above the Void became as silent as the grave. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“This is...”

It was hard for them to believe what they had seen.

Just now, they saw Jian Wushuang suddenly erupt with great power, cut off Ling Xueyu’s two arms, and immediately launch another attack with a brilliant strike.

14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire were killed by that strike.

Shock!

Everybody was shocked.

“How, how could it be possible?”

“Why is Jian Wushuang so strong?”

“Oh God, he killed 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire with only one strike?”

The Monarchs from the 12 Dynasties could not help but widen their eyes.

The Monarch of the Cosmos Empire, a weathered elder, had just shown a smiling face, but now it flushed red with anger.

Bang!

The elder stood up while patting the chair into dust.

He looked extremely angry as killing intent roared around his body.

The other Monarchs were a little surprised, but they could understand him.

The Cosmos Empire was one of the two large empires, but now all the geniuses from it had been killed by the same person in this Point Grab Battle. It was impossible for their Monarch not to be furious.

The experts of old sects gathered with a complex look.

Especially Mo Lingtian.

Mo Lingtian had thought highly of Ling Xueyu and judged that he was qualified to be a disciple of his Wilderness Sword Sect.

As for Jian Wushuang...

Mo Lingtian had not put him in his eyes.

However, Mo Lingtian was stunned at?this moment.

“It’s impossible!”

Even Mo Lingtian could hardly believe that what happened below was real.

“The kid has surpassed himself, but even if he broke through, how could he improve his strength to such an extent?”

Unimaginable!

Mo Lingtian could not understand.

As for his previous strength, Jian Wushuang could only reach top 10 in the standings, but now his strength had improved to such an inconceivable level where he could kill 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire with only one strike.

“This kid, how did he achieve it?”?Mo Lingtian roared in mind.

He was oblivious to Jian Wushuang’s true strength.

Jian Wushuang had improved his strength from the peak of the Profound Cold Core Realm to the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

It looked like an ordinary breakthrough, but Jian Wushuang had been cultivating Heavenly Creation Skill—the Heaven defying cultivation method.

It was a Supreme Gold Core that he had.

He had been at the peak of the Profound Cold Core Realm. As a result, his eruption of power could only be considered close to Half Step Yin-Yang, even if it was a Supreme Gold Core that triggered the outburst.

But now, he had reached the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, thus his power could exceed the Gold Core Realm and reach the Initial Yin Void Realm with the help of the Supreme Gold Core.

He could outclass any genius of the 12 Dynasties with the strength.

More importantly, he made a major breakthrough in the enlightenment of his sword essence.

Four kinds of sword essence combined...

The more closely four kinds of sword essence combined, the greater his strength would improve.

When he had combined two kinds of sword essence, Jian Wushuang improved his complete strength to a normal degree.

After he had combined three kinds of sword essence, his complete strength was at least five times greater than before.

Now after combining four kinds of sword essence, Jian Wushuang was quite clear that his complete strength was at least 10 times greater than before.

Moreover, the combination of them not only helped to improve his swordsmanship but also?brought him a kind of new power...

With all of them coupled together, Jian Wushuang became extremely strong after the breakthrough.

Subsequently, he could cut off Ling Xueyu’s two arms and could kill 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire with one strike.

“I thought Meng Wutian and Ling Xueyu were exceptional geniuses and didn’t expect that Jian Wushuang was much stronger than the two of them.”

“They’re not on the same level.”

“Such a peerless genius...”

Experts of old sects stared at Jian Wushuang with a feverish look.

They were different from Mo Lingtian, who followed his Sect Master’s order to come here and just pretended that he would choose several disciples for the Wilderness Sword Sect.

The experts of the other old sects came for these geniuses.

If they were satisfied with someone, they would offer them an opportunity to join their old sects.

Now they knew that Jian Wushuang was the most outstanding genius in this Easternmost Hunting, as he had proved himself through his strength and talent.

He was a much more terrifying monster than Meng Wutian or Ling Xueyu.

The experts of old sects naturally wanted him.

“Mr. Ling Tian, I remember that you said that you were not interested in Jian Wushuang and that we could accept him as a disciple if we wanted him?” an expert of an old sect said while looking toward Mo Lingtian.

“Haha, Mr. Ling Tian comes from the Wilderness Sword Sect, one of top eight sects in Nan Yang. He is demanding. How could he be satisfied with such a kid?”

“Right, Mr. Ling Tian might not be satisfied with him, but we don’t mind accepting Jian Wushuang as our disciple.”

“Mr. Ling Tian, you will keep your promise, right?”

The experts of the other old sects watched them with interest.

All of them eagerly wanted Jian Wushuang to be their disciple, therefore their biggest competitor was the Wilderness Sword Sect.

The Wilderness Sword Sect was one of the top eight sects, so it was more powerful than the other sects.

Moreover, the Wilderness Sword Sect was famous for Sword Principle, and Jian Wushuang was also a Warrior of Sword Principle.

Therefore, the conditions which the Wilderness Sword Sect could offer were much better than that of the other old sects.

If they gave Jian Wushuang an option, he might choose the Wilderness Sword Sect without hesitation.

The experts of the other old sects reminded Mo Lingtian of what he said because they wanted him to give up on Jian Wushuang.

Mo Lingtian understood their intentions and immediately snorted. “Hmph, I’ll keep my promise. Jian Wushuang might be slightly talented, but our Wilderness Sword Sect is full of geniuses who are more excellent than him. It’s fine without him.

“Since you want him, I’ll quit.

“It’s not a big deal.”

Mo Lingtian seemed unconcerned, but he was somewhat upset about it.

After all, Jian Wushuang showed his talent. What an exceptional genius he was!
