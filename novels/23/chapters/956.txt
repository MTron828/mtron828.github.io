Chapter 957: Earth-shattering Roar

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Gu King, should I fail, please find a way to leave this place with Leng Rushuang…”

When Jian Wushuang’s placid voice rang in Gu King’s mind, he could sense Jian Wushuang’s buried determination.

“I’ll try my best.” Gu King nodded solemnly.

Jian Wushuang smiled but his gaze was resting on Leng Rushuang who was in his embrace.

He lowered his head and planted a gentle kiss on her lips. Then, he placed her on Gu King’s back.

Then he closed his eyes. The Blood Essence that originated from?“Eight-star Imperial God” King Luo Zhen was enveloped in his inexhaustible force of blood vessels. There was only seventy percent of it left.

He took in a deep breath and promptly allowed the force of blood vessels to wash over the drop of Blood Essence. He did not hesitate and engulfed the Blood Essence in one go.

He forcefully absorbed the seventy percent left of the Blood Essence.

“Kaboom!” An unprecedented strong Ancient God Power exploded within Jian Wushuang. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This Ancient God Power gushed out of his body and sent shockwaves throughout the world. The helpless souls who had lost all hope turned to look at him in alarm.

They were deeply startled when they noticed the terrifying power coming from Jian Wushuang. Unprecedented aghast expressions appeared on their faces.

They could tell that the power bursting out of Jian Wushuang was far stronger than what came out of King Gu Tong.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and the rest stared at Jian Wushuang.

They once again gained a renewed sense of hope after witnessing Jian Wushuang’s enormous power.

Even if that hope was so pathetically minuscule, it was enough to get their hearts thumping wildly.

What they were seeing was a youngster in the Eternal Realm but he was someone who had created countless miracles on this battlefield.

He had already displayed the shockingly powerful Magic Weapon Pavilion that contained 103,800 Emperor Weapons during the battle in the recruitment assembly.

Then, with his Eternal Realm cultivation, he fought Xia Mang, the genius from the Eternal World who was already a Dao Master. He used his thunderbolt skill to deliver Xia Mang such a crushing defeat that he nearly killed the latter.

When the war subsequently broke out, he alone confronted three Dao Masters and used one move to kill one of them.

Then, the Immortal Army of the Xia Clan was dispatched and immediately turned the tides of the battlefield to their side. Emperor Xiao’s army was forced to retreat little by little. It was at that moment that Jian Wushuang once again appeared to help Emperor Xiao to capture that enormous worm beast. Jian Wushuang had unleashed a terrifying consciousness attack and sound wave attack. Once the sound wave died, the Immortal Army of the Xia clan all perished and the situation soon favored Emperor Xiao’s side again. Jian Wushuang had turned the situation on its end with a single, smooth move.

Just earlier, Xia Yong, the Dao Master as well as the strongest factor that the Xia clan had relied on for so many years, had joined the battle.

Ultimately, it was still Jian Wushuang—a mere Eternal Realm dweller—who used some kind of trick to produce an unbelievably mighty power. He unleashed three pointers in succession, each one stronger than the one before. Xia Yong suffered such a crushing defeat that he had to pay a steep price to use a life-saving secret skill just to keep himself alive.

Everything that had happened could be dubbed a series of miracles, yet they all happened to him alone.

Jian Wushuang was now once again making a shocking move in a time where others were despairing about the Life-devouring Formation and resigning themselves to their deaths. Would he be able to create yet another unbelievable miracle?

Over in the camp of the Xia clan, there was a gathering of surviving experts who were staring at Jian Wushuang.

“What kind of a trouble can that lowly beast create at this stage? Could he really kill that Dao Yuanzi? I doubt it!” Xia Tao said coldly.

“I really hope that he’d succeed.”

Xia Yong stood at the rear of the camp as he stared coolly at Jian Wushuang. “If he really manages to kill Dao Yuanzi, then he’d be saving us all. Our grudge, on the other hand… Humph! I bet he has to pay quite a steep price for all those moves he used. Even if he really kills Dao Yuanzi, I’m sure he’ll lose his life as well. That saves us the trouble of taking revenge on him.”

Countless gazes that harbored anticipation and all sorts of complicated emotions were focused on Jian Wushuang.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang was experiencing overwhelmingly great changes in his body.

After forcefully absorbing all of the remaining Blood Essence from King Luo Zhen, he felt the majestic Ancient God Power coursing violently through his body. The unprecedented impact on his body made him clench his teeth as he endured the intense pain within. It took him a great effort to control the Ancient God Power.

Others would only be able to detect that his strength had exploded several times over. The Quadrangular Star imprinted in his midbrows once again transformed.

When he tried to engulf thirty percent of the Blood Essence in the past, he had merely reached the peak of Four-star level. However, there was now another star that had condensed in his midbrows. Then yet another one appeared. The changes in Jian Wushuang showed no sign of stopping and the remaining Ancient God Power frantically created a final star—making it the seventh star.

However, the seventh star failed to be fully condensed and left only an illusory shadow on his skin.

Six stars!

Six-star Imperial Ancient God!

He was even so close to becoming a Seven-star Imperial Ancient God!

This was the kind of short-term strength that Jian Wushuang gained after forcefully engulfing the drop of Blood Essence.

He currently had his eyes closed as his body trembled ever so slightly because of the intense pain that he felt.

“What’s wrong with him?”

There were countless people who had their gazes firmly planted on Jian Wushuang. Even Dao Yuanzi, who stood safely under his defensive cover, could not help looking over at him.

Finally, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes.

The moment his eyelids flew open, a dark golden thunderlight that seemed capable of ravaging the earth flitted across his pupils.

“Roar!”

The piercing pain unlike any that he had ever felt before caused him to involuntarily let out a roar. It was a roar that was enough to shock every living creature in the world.

The roar contained Jian Wushuang’s determination to save his brothers, Senior Brother, and his savior Emperor Xiao, even if it meant his death.

It was simultaneously a roar that came out of the millions of innocent folks, directed at Dao Yuanzi.

The roar startled the world and petrified heaven. It swept the eight desolate lands and looked down upon all living in this world. Even more importantly, it signified an anger that Jian Wushuang had never experienced.

This roar reached all the way up to the Nine Heavens. It charged forward all while carrying the Ancient God Power that had leaked out of Jian Wushuang.

Standing in front of Jian Wushuang was none other than the group of experts from the Xia clan.

The sound wave imbued with Ancient God Power washed over them.

“No!”

The several great experts of the Xia clan, including the most powerful one of them all, Xia Yong, emitted bloodcurdling screeches.

Then, their bodies that were enveloped in the sound wave began to shatter like pieces of paper.

When the roar subsided, the place where the Xia clan experts had stood was entirely empty. Ancestor Xia Yong; the current Master of the clan, Xia Tao; as well as his heir, Xia Ming had all vanished within the roar.
