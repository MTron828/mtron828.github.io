Chapter 1601: Jian Wushuang’s Treatment

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“You’re really…” Hall Master Yuan’s eyes shone brilliantly right away and he laughed, “Haha. Jian Wushuang, your luck is not too bad.”

“My luck is not too bad. However, I have a question now,” Jian Wushuang had an indifferent expression, “I have heard that the requirements to enter the Thunderbolt Island are extremely high?”

“Indeed. The minimum requirement to enter the Thunderbolt Island is to be an Eternal Real God,” Hall Master Yuan nodded his head and laughed soon after: “However, in terms of realm, you do not need to be an Eternal Real God; it will be fine as long as you have the fighting capabilities of an Eternal Real God. For example, there are some Void Real Gods at the Thunderbolt Island as well. In particular, most of these Void Real Gods are those who stand at the top and they are geniuses who are extremely outstanding. However, the key point is that they are not Eternal Real Gods.”

“Since Void Real Gods are able to enter, as long as the abilities of a Universe God like you are able to achieve that level, you will naturally be able to enter the Thunderbolt Island.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened up.

“In actual fact, I had already made preparations for you to go to the Thunderbolt Island even if you didn’t obtain this Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. I have filed an application to the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance to get a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy for you by paying a price for it,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“What?” both Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan looked over with surprise.

“In the history of the Lineage of Star, you are the most outstanding genius disciple and you possesses an immeasurable amount of talent. As such, the Lineage of Star will naturally do its best to nurture you. Moreover, it’s only one Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. Although it’s precious, it’s nothing to the Lineage of Star. Not only will I help you to get a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy now, but in sixty thousand years, the new Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy that is given out by the Sanctuary Alliance will also be given to you. However, the requirement for this is that you must have already made a breakthrough to a Real God,” Hall Master Yuan laughed.

After hearing what was said, Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan were completely stunned.

They then looked at Jian Wushuang at once and their eyes were filled with enviousness.

It should be known that deacons of the Lineage of Star like them wanted the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy so much that they even dreamt about it. However, no matter how hard they fought for it, they were unable to get such an opportunity.

However, what about Jian Wushuang?

When he was a Universe God, he would be given a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. After sixty thousand years, he would be given a second one as long as he became a Real God?

He did not even need to fight with anyone. Moreover, even without needing him to request for the token, Hall Master Yuan would have also taken the initiative to make preparations for him.

Such treatment…

When comparing his treatment to others, it was really infuriating.

Even Jian Wushuang himself was a bit dumbfounded.

“Hall Master Yuan, since you have already made a trip to exchange a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy with the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance for me, then the token with me…” Jian Wushuang did not finish speaking.

“Since you have obtained this Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy yourself, it is naturally yours,” Hall Master Yuan laughed.

“In other words, I can have two Tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy when I am a Universe God and sixty thousand years later, I will be able to get a third token if I make a breakthrough to a Real God by then?”

“That’s right,” Hall Master Yuan nodded his head, “For the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, one token will only allow you to choose one Fairy Palace to comprehend for one hundred years. However, you have been comprehending the Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine at the same time. Hence, if you have two tokens, you can comprehend a hundred years each in the Reincarnation Doctrine’s Fairy Palace and in the Spacetime Doctrine’s Fairy Palace.. that would be just nice for you.”

“However, isn’t this a bit…” Jian Wushuang had a puzzled expression.

“A bit what? A bit too biased?” Hall Master Yuan sneered, “If anyone feels that way, tell him to try to fight an Eternal Real God on equal footing when he is still a Universe God. If he is able to do it, I guarantee that I will give him the same treatment. Moreover, this matter is not decided by me alone; it is decided by me, the Palace Master and the two other Hall Masters after some discussion. Thus, who in the Lineage of Star would dare to have something to say?”

After hearing what was said, Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan who were by the side looked at each other and they forced a smile.

They knew that for this matter, Hall Master Yuan was not being biased. Instead, the talents that Jian Wushuang displayed were indeed worthy enough for the Lineage of Star to pay such a big price to nurture him.

Even if the news were to spread, the experts in the Lineage of Star could at most be envious of Jian Wushuang and they would not be dissatisfied in the slightest bit.

After all, the Lineage of Star was just like that. One would need to display abilities that were good enough to earn the Lineage of Star’s resources.

“We shall leave this matter as such. In no time, the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy will come. At that time, I will send people to bring you to the Thunderbolt Island,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh right, I heard from Wu Liang that you have already cultivated the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace successfully?” Hall Master Yuan looked toward Jian Wushuang abruptly.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“That’s great,” Hall Master Yuan had a beaming smile and it was only after a long time that he calmed down. He then warned: “Remember this, Jian Wushuang. From now on, unless there is a need to, try to refrain from using the Secret Skill of Star Palace. This Secret Skill is a trump card and if you were to use it properly, you would be able to turn the tide during a critical situation. Hence, you had better not let other people know about it. In addition, I will also tell Wu Liang and Fei Yan to keep this matter to themselves.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head again.

“That’s it. You may leave now,” Hall Master Yuan waved his hands.

Jian Wushuang, Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan then went their own separate ways.

After returning to the Sword Star, Jian Wushuang started to train again. At the same time, he was also waiting quietly for the second Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy to arrive.

He was looking forward to the Thunderbolt Island as well as the Fairy Palace on it.

On the other hand, the news of him obtaining two Tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy in one go and the fact that he might even get a third token in the future started to spread in the Lineage of Star.

After many experts in the Lineage of Star knew about that, many of them gasped.

However, no one was jealous.

All of them knew that Jian Wushuang had obtained everything with his own abilities.

If they had the same abilities as well, they would definitely have gotten the same treatment as Jian Wushuang. However, it was a pity that they did not have the same abilities. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed and the second Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy finally arrived.

“Jian Wushuang, I will get Wu Liang to send you to the Thunderbolt Island. As for some of the matters regarding the Thunderbolt Island, Wu Liang will tell you about it clearly. In addition, after reaching there, remember to train properly and don’t miss this opportunity at any cost,” Hall Master Yuan warned.

Jian Wushuang naturally agreed to it. After that, he went to the Thunderbolt Island together with Real God Wu Liang.

“Elder Wu Liang, I’m sorry for troubling you to bring me to the island,” Jian Wushuang was standing in front of Real God Wu Liang.

“No problem. It just so happened that I was planning to go to the Thunderbolt Island as well. Therefore, sending you there is no trouble,” Real God Wu Liang laughed.

“Elder Wu Liang is planning to go to the Thunderbolt Island as well? For training?” Jian Wushuang asked randomly.

“Yes” Real God Wu Liang nodded his head, “The Thunderbolt Island does not only contain the Fairy Palace; it also contains other opportunities as well as special training grounds.”
