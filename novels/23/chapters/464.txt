Chapter 465: Dragon King Arrow, Shoot to kill!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This bow is a first-grade magic weapon?” Myriad Islands Lord’s expression changed slightly.

The powerful Energy Shield around him was his largest trump card.

Under normal circumstances, even a marquis could not crack it unless he used his strongest skill.

Myriad Islands Lord had thought that he could not be defeated by Jian Wushuang, who only owned a Puppet Fighter of marquis level.

A Marquis Puppet would not know how to use its strongest skill, so it was impossible for it to break the Energy Shield.

But it would be different if the marquis Puppet Fighter was equipped with a first-grade magic weapon.

The bow concentrated its strength at its point. As the Blood Puppet drew the bowstring and the terrible power accumulated, Myriad Islands Lord felt its threat.

Inside the palace, lords of the two camps observed the Dragon King Bow closely.

At the moment, the Blood Puppet had already drawn the bowstring to about 80 percent of its full extent. Soon, it stretched to 90 percent.

That was the limit of the Blood Puppet. The power that had condensed on the Dragon King Arrow was astounding.

“90 percent?” Jian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction.

The drawing resistance of the Dragon King Bow was extremely high. When Jian Wushuang had just obtained the Bow, he had drawn it to 10 percent with his best efforts. Later, he had found Marquis Beimo’s opportunity which had increased his strength, particularly in the physical aspects. This had?enabled him to draw it to a limit of 50 percent.

It was extremely difficult for the Blood Puppet to draw the Bow to 90 percent. Probably, only actual marquises could hold it at full draw.

With the accumulated power reaching its peak, the Blood Puppet suddenly loosened its tight palm.

CHUU!

A golden Flowing Light crossed the sky with a long tail like a comet.

Fast. It was too fast!

It was so swift that everyone present forgot to dodge.

Myriad Islands Lord knew that he could not escape from the arrow. He stood still and stared attentively at the Dragon King Arrow. Although he had full confidence in the Energy Shield around him, he felt fearful as the arrow flew toward him.

Erring on the side of caution, he operated his Spiritual Power to build another Spiritual Power Shield around his body.

The “Golden Comet” dragged its long tail and hit the Energy Shield around Myriad Islands Lord.

Boom... The terrible power that had condensed to an extreme density suddenly broke out and swept through the Energy Shield in a frenzy. Simultaneously, the Energy Shield tried to resist its advances and released vast amounts of power.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

Subtle sounds from the pressure of energies colliding reverberated through the palace.

The lords had already fallen silent. Even Black Yuan Lord and others who had been fighting the golden Puppet Fighters and Golden Purple Puppets stopped to look at them.

At the point of impact, the Energy Shield had been completely dented. At the center of the dent, a sharp light pounded heavily and drilled a tiny hole in the Energy Shield.

The lords narrowed their eyes in surprise.

Myriad Islands Lord took a deep breath and roared angrily. There was another Spiritual Power Shield formed by his own Spiritual Power around him. It helped to hold off the Golden Comet, but was eventually pierced by it.

The “Golden Comet” encountered great resistance as it pushed toward Myriad Islands Lord.

After drilling through the two Shields, the power of “Golden Comet” was exhausted. When it arrived at Myriad Islands Lord’s chest, its point merely pierced his skin and then stopped.

Myriad Islands Lord breathed heavily and his whole back was soaked in sweat. He had been really scared when the Dragon King Arrow had pierced his Shields. Fortunately, the power of the Dragon King Arrow had been depleted just as it was going to penetrate his body.

Myriad Islands Lord felt that he was at the extreme edge of survival.

Then he laughed wildly.

“Haha, Swordsman, you can’t kill me!”

“You can’t kill me.”

The broken Energy Shield began to repair itself at a surprising speed. In a blink of an eye, it was completed repaired, and the Dragon King Arrow was pushed out by the Energy Shield.

This Energy Shield had become intact again.

Seeing this, the surrounding lords all sighed.

“What a pity!”

“It was so close. He nearly killed Myriad Islands Lord.”

“Only Myriad Islands Lord can survive that arrow. If it were us, we would be dead. Even Black Yuan Lord with his strong body can’t resist that arrow.”

The lords sighed and felt pity for Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman, I said before, you can’t kill me. No matter what aces you have, you can’t kill me, haha...”Myriad Islands Lord was still laughing hysterically.

Jian Wushuang was calm as he looked at Myriad Islands Lord with a hint of pity in his eyes.

“Myriad Islands Lord,” Jian Wushuang finally said.

Myriad Islands Lord stopped laughing and looked at Jian Wushuang with a trace of arrogance.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and sneered, “It’s too early for you to feel lucky!”

“Well?” Myriad Islands Lord was puzzled at first, but he suddenly looked down at his chest hurriedly.

The arrow had not really hurt him, but it had touched his body and pierced his skin. He looked down to inspect the wound.

He was terrified by what he saw.

“This, this is...” Myriad Islands Lord stared at his chest. A patch of white had appeared.

The white patch was spreading at an alarming speed and nearly covered his entire chest. Meanwhile, he felt a creepy chill spreading through his body and freezing his consciousness.

The patch of white continued to spread and finally covered his entire body. Click, click... As the chill condensed, Myriad Islands Lord turned into ice.

The wind blew.

Woosh! The ice sculpture shattered.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
