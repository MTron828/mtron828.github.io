Chapter 582: Win or Lose

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s strongest Killing Move is so powerful that only Temple Master Black Spirit in the whole Monster-exterminating League can survive. As for Jian Wushuang... In the end, he is just a Cloud Realm expert. It’s impossible for him to be alive,”?Temple Master Iceberg thought with a gloomy face.

He really hoped that Jian Wushuang would die in this battle.

although it meant that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would get the compass, Temple Master Iceberg understood that he could not possess the compass now that its secret had been exposed.

The Temple Masters of the Monster-exterminating League also knew that the compass was priceless, but they all hoped that Jian Wushuang would give it to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and settle the conflict. That did not mean that they had no greed for the compass. On the contrary, they were very eager to get their hands on the compass.

But similarly, they knew that they could not possess it with only their little bit of strength.

Since it was impossible for him to obtain the compass, Temple Master Iceberg naturally hoped that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would kill Jian Wushuang.

There was already bad blood between him and Jian Wushuang, and the grudge between them was deep. The strength which Jian Wushuang displayed here filled him with an extreme amount of fear. If Jian Wushuang did not die, then he would be in great trouble.

Silence emanated from the huge pit for a while.

Suddenly, the sound of light footsteps were head as Jian Wushuang walked out from the pit and arrived in front of the crowd once again.

Jian Wushuang’s clothes were in rags and his appearance was messy, but that was it.

His aura had not weakened at all.

It astonished all the spectators.

“How is this possible?”

“He isn’t even hurt?”

“He’s unhurt, and his aura hasn’t weakened at all.”

Even Crystal-armored Monster Emperor narrowed his purple eyes when he saw Jian Wushuang standing in front of him, completely intact.

“My strongest Killing Move didn’t even injure him?”?Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was astonished.

Jian Wushuang turned to face Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, with a smile on his face as he said, “Sevenfold Demonic Killing is indeed good.”

It really was powerful. Seven ordinary attacks combined to form an extremely terrifying Killing Move. Even he was not able to completely dodge it and was hit by the seventh move. However, because his body was so strong, it still wasn’t enough to really hurt him.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang said coldly, “You’ve displayed your strongest Killing Move, so?now have a taste of mine.”

Upon hearing this, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s expression changed slightly.

Jian Wushuang started. He suddenly stretched out his left palm and clapped several times in the air.

Vast Spiritual Power began to surge.

“Asura Secret Skill, Eighteen Levels of Hell!”

A chilly cry was forcefully uttered by Jian Wushuang.

Boom... The area suddenly trembled. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Up in the air, above Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s head, scarlet waves that were similar to whirlpools suddenly appeared.

Then, an 18-floor scarlet pavilion appeared.

It had 18 floors with ghost shadows visible on each floor, as its overwhelming power began surging toward Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

The strongest part of the Eighteen Levels of Hell was its deterrence.

When Jian Wushuang was still in the Saint Realm he could barely use this skill and could not bring its full power. But now, after his breakthrough to the Nine-cloud Realm, the power of this move could be completely released.

The terrifying deterrence struck Crystal-armored Monster Emperor directly.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was caught in a haze due to the deterrence.

It lasted for an instant, which was plenty of time for Jian Wushuang to do many things.

He quickly swung his Heart-killing Sword.

The moment he swung the sword, the whole area became dark, just like a night sky.

The sword shadow became the only light in this night sky.

A mighty killing intent suddenly surged out.

The seventh move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Star River!

It was too fast, in addition?to the fact that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor had been disoriented by the scarlet pavilion, so he did not have any initial reaction. By the time he finished struggling to recover himself, the beautiful sword shadow was already in front of him.

He could do nothing but watch the beautiful sword shadow as it continued drawing nearer.

Suddenly, it paused.

It paused when it was half a centimeter away from his throat.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, you have lost,” Jian Wushuang said coldly, with his Heart-killing Sword pointing at Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s throat.

Time and space seemed to be frozen.

The human experts and the countless Demonic Beasts looked at them in astonishment.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor lost!

He really had lost!

Had Jian Wushuang not stopped, the Monster Emperor would have died.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s face reddened and his Amethyst covered body trembled slightly because his heart was full of anger and unwillingness.

He could not accept the fact that he was defeated by a human being, a Cloud Realm human being.

But he had to keep his anger and unwillingness under control no matter how strong they were.

After all, he lost!

“Sword Emperor...” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang and said solemnly,?“You’ve won the battle. I’ll leave immediately and I won’t set foot in Human Territory for a thousand years. As long as the compass is in your hands, I’ll never try to obtain it again!”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He did not kill Crystal-armored Monster Emperor directly in the hopes that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would retreat by himself.

After all, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor had led thousands of Demonic Beasts to the battlefield. If he killed Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, the Demonic Beasts would definitely be angry and rush towards the Human Territory

Naturally, it would be good if Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would leave of his own free will.

However, before Jian Wushuang spoke, something suddenly happened.

Up in the air near them, a dozen vigorous and majestic auras suddenly appeared. At the same time, a magnificent voice echoed throughout the area.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, as one of the three Monster Emperors, how could you be defeated by a human being? How shameful!”

A hint of ridicule in the voice attracted everyone present to turn around and look at it.

They were astonished upon seeing the dozen behemoths that were rushing towards them.

“Bone Dragon Clan!”
