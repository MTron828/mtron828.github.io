Chapter 5191 - 5191: Forbidden Demon Lord and Qishen

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The originally kind expression vanished in an instant, replaced by an intense sternness.

“You old thing, why do you hinder my path!” A large and hideous head hovered above the sea of origin source.

Its hollow eye sockets emitted a dim light, and the entire head was uneven, exuding an evil aura.

The true spirit, after clearly seeing the newcomer, snorted coldly, “This is what the master ordered. I naturally have to do it. I don’t care whose path I block.”

“You!” Black mist spewed out from the nostrils of the ugly head, roaring, “Don’t forget, I am a part of Qishen. I used to be your master’s Great Dao!”

The true spirit sneered, “A Great Dao cast away by the master dares to claim it’s a part of Qishen.”

Although he said so, he was aware of the immense power of the Great

Devouring Dao. Just now, he noticed the devouring technique displayed by Jian

Wushuang, which had transformed into the taboo Great Devouring Dao of the Forbidden Demon Lord. It had come to the Qishen Temple. There was probably some kind of coincidence behind this.

“Hmph, that old man had no idea about my strength. It was his own blindness. If he hadn’t stripped me off, how could he have fallen!” the grotesque head roared.

“Shut your mouth. The master is someone you, a filthy thing like you, can never insult. If you don’t leave now, I’ll suppress this avatar of yours in the Qishen Temple and torment you for eternity!” the true spirit thundered.

Everything else could be tolerated, except insulting the Qishen Temple. That was his bottom line.

Seeing the old man furious, the evil skull hesitated for a moment. Knowing he couldn’t gain anything here, he began to disintegrate on his own.

Before disintegrating, he couldn’t help but threaten, “Just you wait! One day, I will break free from this seal and completely devour the Original Universe, restoring the glory of the Great Devouring Dao! ”

“Hahaha!!! ”

The true spirit sneered contemptuously. “Feel free to devour; the Original Universe isn’t mine. I wouldn’t care even if you devour yourself.”

“The Forbidden Demon Lord?”

“Just a filthy insect!”

Just an insect that his master had removed from his body. Back then, his master’s Great Devouring Dao was so powerful. He wouldn’t even furrow his brows at devouring an entire universe.

However, that filthy insect did have some abilities back in the day. It had devoured several universes, but in the end, a powerful being suppressed it in the Original Universe. Now, the seal was beginning to collapse, indicating that the being that suppressed it had also perished.

The true spirit sighed.

If the Great Devouring Dao still existed, perhaps his master wouldn’t have fallen back then.

But at that time, the Qishen was too strong, too arrogant. The Great Devouring Dao was a disaster; he had to remove it. One, for his own sake, and secondly, for the sake of the river of time and space.

The fall of an Emperor would give birth to Emperor’s Fall, creating numerous ghosts and monsters capable of destroying a world without an Emperor.

As the peak existence in the River of Time and Space, the Qishen’s Great Dao was incredibly powerful. Even after being stripped away, that Devouring Dao could easily trample over a universe.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Fortunately, when Qishen fell, he attained enlightenment within the Qishen Temple, preserving his complete Great Dao within the temple.

If he had fallen outside, his Great Dao would either enrich a universe or give birth to the powerful Forbidden Demon Lord.

That Forbidden Demon Lord, after being expelled years ago, developed self-awareness and roamed the river of time, causing havoc whenever it could.

Luckily, a powerful being suppressed it later. Now, it re-emerged and encountered the Qishen Temple once again, making the Forbidden Demon Lord extremely wary.

After all, it was something left by Qishen. He had known Qishen’s plan back then. Now that the Qishen Temple had opened in the Original Universe, he feared that it might cause a tremendous upheaval, ruining his plans.

Thinking of threatening the true spirit, he ended up scaring himself away.

At the heart of the Original Universe, within a massive cage, stood an enormous figure stretching billions of miles. No living being could approach this place. The malevolent aura emanating from this colossal figure was incredibly potent, corroding even the origin source. Even a tier 5 Emperor would have their consciousness affected here, damaging their origin source.

This was also the most dangerous place in the Original Universe!

“Heaven’s Prison.”

The towering figure was the true form of the Forbidden Demon Lord.

Although the seal had started to loosen, he still couldn’t move a step.

According to calculations, it would still take tens of thousands of chaos cycles to break open the prison. Each epoch spanned billions of years, and he couldn’t afford to wait for tens of thousands of chaos cycles.

In the Original Universe, the Qishen Temple had appeared. No one knew what the Original Universe would become in the future. What if a Universe Master emerged?

He couldn’t afford to delay any longer.

“Are they really forcing me to reveal my true strength?” The Forbidden Demon Lord sighed, his immense eyes shifting at that moment.

“A million years more, that should suffice! I hope that little one grows up quickly,” the Forbidden Demon Lord sunk into contemplation again. At this moment, the tension in the Original Universe eased slightly.

In the Qishen Temple, on the original planet.

If Jian Wushuang knew that devouring Mi Luo’s origin source would attract the attention of two peak-level existences in the universe, there was no telling how he would react.

In the canyon, after Mi Luo’s fall, the tide turned.

Mi Luo self-destructed his origin source, leaving behind only intact armor on the ruins, along with a dark red pearl.

Both were excellent innate treasures. Jian Wushuang naturally took them without hesitation and handed them to Hu Qing. “Choose one for yourself!”

Hu Qing folded his hands and shook his head. A brown staff was innate to him; the stronger his treasure, the stronger he became. He didn’t need any innate treasures.

“In that case, I won’t hold back!” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He directly acknowledged ownership, immediately putting on the armor and taking the pearl that guarded the origin source.

The pearl floated above the origin source, not only guarding the Great Dao of the origin source but also nourishing it. Jian Wushuang felt refreshed, his mind much clearer.

“Brother Wushuang, what about those three?” Hu Qing pointed to the three frenzied individuals.

Calling them frenzied was not an exaggeration. Three peak-level powerhouses burned their origin sources, fighting in a desperate melee. Punches and kicks were exchanged, nearly trading life for life.

No matter how hard the two Princes from the Daluo Realm fought, they couldn’t kill God -Emperor MO Long. This didn’t mean MO Long was exceptionally strong; despite his numerous innate treasures, his strength was suppressed, making him inferior to the two counterparts of the same level.

The reason he hadn’t fallen was that when he was about to succumb, the pressure from the One Thought Universe would loosen slightly due to Jian Wushuang’s influence. Jian Wushuang would gradually loosen the restrictions to allow him to gain some strength to continue fighting.

Now. all the restrictions had been released. even enhancing MO Long’s

strength by 30 percent, allowing the fight to continue.

The three Princes from the Daluo Realm thought they had an advantage, but in reality, they were evenly matched. After consuming their strength for so long, they were close to exhaustion. Jian Wushuang and Hu Qing could easily deal with them..
