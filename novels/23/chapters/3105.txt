Chapter 3106: Interception

——

“Haha, Your Highness Qing, I have been waiting for you for a long time.”

When the hearty laughter echoed in the air, the expressions of Qing and Yuan Chong immediately changed.

Yuan Chong immediately saw the person who was laughing.

“Holy four? Oh no, it’s the Third Prince’s men!” Yuan Chong was shocked, and everyone immediately stopped.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The figures were so fast that they appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the others in the blink of an eye.

At first glance, there were nearly 30 experts who had just arrived, and the lowest among them was a rank three True Saint. However, there were only a few of them, and most of them were rank four True Saints, the aura emanating from the black-clothed old man in the lead far surpassed that of a fourth rank True Saint.

This black-clothed old man was a genuine fifth rank True Saint!

Such a lineup was far stronger than the one on Prince Qing’s side. They were on two completely different levels. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“How? How did you know to wait for us here?” Prince Qing’s voice was cold.

“How did you know? Of course, someone told us.” The black-robed old man, Shen Si, smiled coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking…

A purple-haired man who was originally behind Prince Qing instantly transformed into a purple ray of light and shot out. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Shen Si.

“My Lord.” The purple-haired man bowed respectfully to Shen Si.

“En, you did well.” Shen Si merely nodded indifferently.

Upon seeing this scene, Prince Qing immediately reacted. “Spy!”

“Haha! Prince Qing, although in terms of cultivation talent, be it you or the Sixth Prince, both of them are very impressive, but in terms of methods of doing things, you and the Sixth Prince are still a little too immature.” Shen Si laughed loudly, “Previously, the Sixth Prince was so ostentatiously inviting experts from all over the place. How could the Third Prince not know about such a huge commotion?

“Even though the Third Prince didn’t stop him, it’s still possible for him to secretly send a few experts under the Sixth Prince’s command. and among the ten experts you’ve chosen this time, we happen to be one of them.”

God four only spoke half of his words.

Actually, the Third Prince had sent quite a number of spies under the Sixth Prince’s command. There were at least more than ten of them, including third and fourth level True Saints.

It was because he had sent out so many spies that even if Prince Qing had chosen ten people at random, one of them would still be one of them.

“So that’s how it is?” Prince Qing and Yuan Chong’s expressions were extremely unsightly.

“Fourth God, it’s one thing for you to have spies under his command, but now that you’re blocking his path, what are you trying to do?” Yuan Chong shouted coldly.

“What are we trying to do? Don’t you know?” Fourth God snickered, “Your Highness Qing, the Third Prince has already guessed your intention. Isn’t it to go to the Holy Feather Sect and become the subordinate of that Peak Sixth level True Saint Elder, and then use the power of the Holy Feather Sect to help the Sixth Prince ascend to the throne? Do you think the Third Prince will let you have your way?”

Inwardly, Prince Qing was stunned. She did not expect that the Third Prince had even guessed her intention.

“Your Highness Qing, we have also brought with us the words of the Third Prince. The Third Prince has said that if you come back with me now, you will stay by his side from now on. That prince will not make things difficult for you because of the blood connection. In the future, when he ascends to the throne, you will still be able to become the princess of the Zhen Wu Country. Your position will only be second to him. However, if you are still stubborn and stand together with the Sixth Prince to oppose him, then don’t blame him for being ruthless.” Shen Si said in a low voice.

“Hehe, connected by blood?” From the moment he was born, he had been planning and preparing. When father was around, he had also been suppressing us. Now that father had gone missing, he could not wait to eliminate the people who threatened his status. Now, he still had the face to say that they were connected by blood? If he said it out loud, it would be a joke!” Prince Qing shouted.

“It seems that Prince Qing is not going to change his mind.” Shen Si’s voice became low and his eyes turned cold.

Prince Qing stopped talking, but he had already made up his mind.

Yuan Chong looked at Jian Wushuang and the others behind him.

“Everyone, Sixth Prince paid a great price to invite you here. Now It’s time for you to fulfill your duty,” Yuan Chong said in a low voice.

Hearing this, the eight people next to Jian Wushuang looked at each other with strange expressions.

“Mr. Yuan Chong,” One of the rank three True Saints suddenly said, he said, “I was indeed invited by the Sixth Prince. The reward promised by the sixth prince is indeed a lot, but although I can be his guard for a hundred years, it’s not worth my life, not to mention the current situation. So…I’m sorry!”

As soon as this rank three True Saint finished speaking, his body immediately transformed into a streak of light and shot out into the air.

With someone taking the lead, the others immediately followed suit.

“Your Highness Qing, Mister Yuan Chong, I’m sorry!”

“The two of you should just pray for yourselves.”

“Although I agreed to be your escort, I’ve never agreed to risk my life for you, much less die.”

Voices rang out one after another.

In the blink of an eye, eight of the nine cultivators behind Prince Qing had left.

Seeing these eight people leave, and the others did not stop them. They knew that these people who left were not truly loyal to Sixth Prince, so there was naturally no need to kill them.

When Yuan Chong saw this, he was so angry that he trembled. “Damn it, damn it!”

Princess Qing’s face became colder and colder.

“Huh?”

Princess Qing’s expression suddenly changed.

She found that although eight of the nine rank three True Saints had left, one of them had chosen to stay.

This person was Jian Wushuang.

“Why don’t you leave?” Princess Qing asked in a deep voice.

“I don’t like to go back on my words. Since I promised to be your guard for a hundred years, I will do my best to protect you,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Hearing this, Prince Qing was stunned and then nodded slightly.

“Prince Qing, don’t worry. Even if I die, I won’t let anything happen to you.” Yuan Chong’s eyes were extremely scarlet. He took a deep look at Prince Qing and then stepped forward.

“God Four, I want to talk to you about a condition.” Yuan Chong’s voice echoed.

“Talk about a condition?” God Four sneered, “At this point, what condition can you talk to me about? Moreover, even if you want to talk about a condition, Prince Qing will be the one to do it. Who do you think you are?”

“Humph, you can’t refuse to negotiate because…” Yuan Chong said as he approached Shen Si.

However, Yuan Chong suddenly waved his hand, and two red streams of light were thrown out from his hand.
