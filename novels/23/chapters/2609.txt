Chapter 2610: Huangji Golden Pill

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the individual room, Jian Wushuang sat calmly, but his expression was quite frosty. He raised his head and stared at the room of Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master, his eyes were burning with fire.

“Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master, huh?

“My old brother, please hang in there. I’ll find you very soon.”

Jian Wushuang mumbled, but his voice was extremely cold.

The auction continued.

After the Stately Painting, the second star of the auction was presented.

The second star of the auction was like the Spiritual Stone Staff that Jian Wushuang sold, a treasure related to the soul.

The only difference being a defensive soul treasure of the High-level Heavenly Treasure!

It was common knowledge no matter the type of treasure that a defensive treasure was always more valuable than an offensive one.

For example, an offensive divine treasure’s worth was never as high as a defensive armor at the same level.

A defensive soul treasure was also more valuable than an offensive soul treasure of the same level. The only difference was their not-so-large price variance.

Even though it was a defensive soul treasure at the Ordinary-level Heavenly Treasure, it was still a lot more valuable than the Spiritual Stone Staff Jian Wushuang sold. Not to mention the soul defense treasure presented was already at High-level Heavenly Treasure!

An increase of one level would increase the treasure’s price by tenfold!

The auction immediately started.

The starting bid was still 10,000,000 Primordial Stones with the bids placed by experts in the third floor individual rooms.

Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, Nanwu Palace, and Dongfang Clan were competing fiercely with each other.

Nanwu Palace and Dongfang Clan especially competed for them fiercely.

In the end, the treasure’s price shot up to an astronomical figure of 1,800,000,000 Primordial Stones.

The winning bidder for the item was the beautiful lady from Dongfang Clan.

“My brother’s abilities are incomparably great. He’s even one of the best

among Peak Ultimate Gods. Unfortunately, he’s weaker when it comes to soul power and will be at a disadvantage when he’s facing highly skilled experts in soul offense. This High-level Heavenly Treasure soul defensive treasure is just the right thing for him. Although we spent one billion and eight hundred million Primordial Stones, it’s worth it as long as it can help my brother improve his shortcoming,” said the beautiful lady to herself.

The bidding for the second star of the auction had ended.

It was the auction for the third treasure star next and also the auction’s last treasure.

Countless experts in the auction were waiting impatiently for the treasure.

Each of the three treasure stars was incredibly valuable. One was sold for 1,300,000,000 Primordial Stones while the other was sold for a total of 1,800,000,000 Primordial Stones.

However, everybody knew the last star would truly be the most valuable item in the entire auction.

That was the true star of the auction. Those experts in the auction knew very well that the last star treasure was not something ordinary people like them were qualified to bid for, but they were still filled with curiosity.

They were wondering what that last treasure would be.

On the display stage, the Golden Chief did not let them wait for too long as he soon displayed the final treasure.

Apparently, it was a golden elixir pill with a thick fragrance that made all those experts drool.

That golden elixir pill was about the size of a baby’s thumb with an extremely dark color. At the same time, the energy projected by the pill was unique.

That energy felt like the energy of an emperor!

Yes, an emperor’s energy!

Most experts in the auction looked perplexed when facing the elixir pill on the display stage.

Some experts on the second and third floor individual rooms managed to identify the elixir pill.

“That’s...a Huangji Golden Pill?”

“Yes, it’s a Huangji Golden Pill. My goodness! The last treasure is actually a Huangji Golden Pill!”

“That’s crazy! Those four powers are gonna go nuts!”

Waves of exclamations could be heard from the individual rooms.

It was indeed true.

The faces of those from Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan turned bright red and became breathless from the excitement when they saw the golden elixir pill.

“It’s... It’s a Huangji Golden Pill? What an auction house Star Picking Pavilion is!!” The Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace had bright lights shining through his eyes. He immediately stood up and said, “I have to get this Huangji Golden Pill no matter what it takes!”

“Damn it! If I knew the last item is the Huangji Golden Pill, I won’t have bought that soul defensive treasure for my brother. I’ve spent one billion eight hundred million Primordial Stones in one go to purchase it. Now, I don’t have much left!” The expression of the Dongfang Clan’s beautiful lady froze. “Quick! Immediately inform the clan and tell them to collect as many Primordial Stones for me as possible by all means. They can also bring cultivation resources of equal values.”

“Aye.” The Heavenly Ultimate Gods of Dongfang Clan nodded in full commitment. They knew it was an important matter.

The experts learned more about the Huangji Golden Pill following the Golden Chief introducing it in the auction.

A Huangji Golden Pill was extremely well known in the Ancient God Domain with its shockingly wide usage.

It only worked on Ultimate Gods with its effects almost equivalent to that of a Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir for Divine Demons.

Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir could help ordinary Divine Demons make a breakthrough in their cultivation in an extremely profound way.

As for the Huangji Golden Pill, it could help Ultimate God experts raise their cultivation level.

Moreover, those who were below Heavenly Ultimate God level could have an 80% chance of making a breakthrough to the next level after taking a Huangji Golden Pill.

For those who were above the Heavenly Ultimate God level, the probability of making a breakthrough was still extremely high after taking a Huangji Golden Pill. Most importantly, it even had great effects on Grand Ultimate Gods.

According to hearsay, if a powerful Peak Heavenly Ultimate God took a Huangji Golden Pill, there was a 50% chance he could make a breakthrough to the Grand Ultimate God level!

If a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God had eaten a Huangji Golden Pill, he would have nearly a 30% probability to make a breakthrough to High-level Grand Ultimate God!!

Even for a High-level Grand Ultimate God, he would still have a 10% probability to reach toward Peak Grand Ultimate God by taking the Huangji Golden Pill!!

With such effects, it was extremely attractive to every Heavenly Ultimate God and Grand Ultimate God.

Especially for the top powers of Danyang Holy Domain—Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan!

There has been no Undying Saint holding the fort at Danyang Holy Domain ever since the fall of Crimson Stone Saint. The Crimson Stone Fort was only superficially seen as the authority while those few top powers only had a few Grand Ultimate God as their strongest expert.
