Chapter 5417 ¬†Key

If only Zhen Wuyang could lead them in, that would be acceptable. But now, with everyone having the chance to enter, how could it still be divided in such a way?

The three of them discussed fervently in the hall and eventually settled on a distribution plan.

"We each take twenty percent, and the remaining 40 percent goes to Senior Shang!" Chishui and Tongtian Buddha stood together.

Regardless of how it was divided, the two of them were adamant about elevating Senior Shang just like Zhen Wuyang.

Zhen Wuyang suppressed his anger and could only agree.

When he turned to look at Tongtian Fo, Zhen Wuyang revealed a meaningful gaze.

Indeed, the wisest people generally spoke the least.

Tongtian Buddha, from start to finish, either nodded or shook his head. Without doing much, he secured 20 percent.

Chishui, at least, managed to invite someone influential. As the instigator, he ended up letting Tongtian Fo take advantage of the situation.

After everyone paid attention, Shang also arrived.

He came in a low-key manner, known to very few. Apart from some inheritors, almost no one else recognized him, not even the people from the Elder Palace.

With great respect, they presented Shang at the main seat, and Zhen Wuyang and the others began studying the key to unlocking the opportunity, the "Bloodfall Crystal."

On Qing Mang Island Island.

"A key?" Jian Wushuang exclaimed, asking, "Elder Qing Mang, is this what Shen Lings mentioned?"

Jian Wushuang found it hard to believe.

A Super Ruins!

In the Ancient Era, the abode of the Universe Master, the birthplace of gods!

A series of events left Jian Wushuang's head spinning.

They had merely stumbled upon an ancient abode, watching as Gong Miaoyi obtained an extraordinary eternal treasure. How could it turn out to be the key to the Super Ruins?

"I don't know about that, but Lord Shen Ling has ordered that only core members can go, and others must not proceed!" The speaker's gaze turned hostile as they looked at Gong Miaoyi, a hint of killing intent in their eyes.

Gong Miaoyi panicked!

Since she encountered Jian Wushuang, nothing good had happened. Either she was being chased or someone was after her life on the escape route. Now, in this place, someone else wanted her dead.

Jian Wushuang toyed with the jade tablet on his thumb, lost in thought. Gong Miaoyi indeed proved to be quite useful to him now that he had broken through to the eighth level of the Ultimate Dao, providing a clear path for the future.

Keeping her alive served little purpose, and if she had no value, killing her was inconsequential.

"Wait!"

Gong Miaoyi took a step back, her expression changing rapidly. Coldly, she said, "Do you know why it's called Bloodfall Crystal?"

As she spoke, she summoned the Bloodfall Crystal.

Blood lines surged, countless blood spheres congealed from sacrifices, crystal clear.

"This is formed by the condensation of blood. You can't take it away. If I die, the Bloodfall Crystal disappears!"

Upon hearing this, Elder Qing Mang hesitated, retracting his killing intent.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, "We never said we were going to kill you!"

"Hmph, you despicable person, stop pretending to be a good guy!" Gong Miaoyi, rarely tearing off her facade, directly scolded Jian Wushuang.

Unfazed by this, Jian Wushuang gestured for everyone to step back. The Mental Power Avatar within Gong Miaoyi's body forcefully began to occupy her Origin Source. In an instant, Gong Miaoyi slumped to the ground, wearing a pained expression on her face, unable to move.

Raising his hand, Jian Wushuang drew Gong Miaoyi into his palm.

"Alright, let's set out directly!" he declared.

Elder Qing Mang, a peak-level tier 6 Emperor, witnessed Jian Wushuang effortlessly handling a tier 5 pinnacle Emperor and couldn't help but reveal an astonished expression.

He was well aware of Jian Wushuang's background. As the direct descendant of Shen Ling, Jian Wushuang knew far more than ordinary elders of Kui.

Jian Wushuang, just a Dao Lord, possessed such formidable strength that he could effortlessly control a peak-level tier 5 Emperor with a casual gesture?

In reality, he wasn't that powerful. The key was Jian Wushuang's Thought avatar.

It could enter the Origin Source of cultivators, and as long as the Origin Source wasn't exceptionally powerful, Jian Wushuang's Thought power avatar could transform into a miniature black hole.

Emperors whose Origin Source hadn't reached the level of a black hole couldn't resist.

Of course, getting inside wasn't easy.

Otherwise, Jian Wushuang could stroll through the tier 6 Emperors as he pleased.

"Directly there?" Bai Junwang expressed some surprise.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, "This matter can't be delayed. Many people are waiting to capture us!"

Shen Ling had already provided them with accurate coordinates. They just needed to go there and activate the relic.

"Still in the Black Demon Sea?" Jian Wushuang furrowed his brow, fearing those who were unwilling to leave and continued searching in the Black Demon Sea.

Elder Qing Mang explained, "The Black Demon Sea is vast. We may not necessarily encounter those people, and even if we do, we can deal with them easily."

This first-rank elder was quite confident.

As a tier 6 pinnacle Emperor with a complete set of top-tier Eternal Treasures and treasures on par with the peak-level, Jian Wushuang had the confidence to face even those at the peak-level.

Except for Qing Mang, there were also two tier 6 Emperors, Zhi Shan and Lan Yu.

These two individuals possessed extraordinary strength, both at the top-level.

In addition to these three, there were 30 Emperor figures dressed in straw robes and masks.

This formidable force was the result of Shen Ling's planning in the Western Sea over countless eras.

Finally, it was now being put into action. All of them were devout followers of Shen Ling, far surpassing the ordinary members of the Kui Organization.

For example, Xuan Yuan Dapan, also an elder of Kui Men, leaned more towards the family in the conflict between Kui Men and the family. Such individuals were not suitable.

There had to be sufficient benefits to mobilize them.

It was different for devoted followers; ask them to crash into the east wall, and they would not hit the south wall.

These people were like devoted followers, unwaveringly loyal. G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

"This time, following the orders of Shen Ling, everything will be under the command of Bai Junwang and Lord Wushuang!" Zhi Shan's voice was deep.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief. He did not want to be a bystander.

Being the leader was crucial.

Bai Junwang didn't care much about that. He only focused on one thing: what Qing Mang said about his suitable physical body and divine body being in that super ruin.

This time, he had to go all out.

He couldn't recover to the peak without obtaining the suitable physical and divine body.

Wanting to refine his divine body and physical form on his own wasn't impossible, but the cost involved was exorbitant.

To recover his tier 6 strength, he had spent billions of treasures, with the crucial factor being the Heavenly Demon supreme technique, which greatly enhanced him.

However, all of this was not enough.

If he were to refine it himself, he would have to break everything.

Start anew, establish a foundation, and then steadily progress.

The physical body was manageable; the cost of a top-tier physical body was relatively ordinary.

But the divine body was a different story.

His Origin Source was now complete, comparable to the ultimate.

If he were to pursue the divine body, it would need to break through to 70,000-fold.

But where could he find this 70,000-fold divine body?

Without 10,000 epochs, he couldn't recondense the peak divine body.

He had originally thought that Shen Ling would have been prepared for him long ago, but unexpectedly, he had to seize it himself.

With Gong Miaoyi in tow, Jian Wushuang followed Elder Qing Mang and quickly arrived at the Black Demon Sea.

The biting wind was fierce, bringing a piercing cold with it.
