Chapter 1180: The Swordsmanship Named “Dawn Light”

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Yin Dragon Power!”

Jian Wushuang let out a cold snort and the black dragon transformed by the Blood Mountain Sword immediately roared and dashed out.

No sooner had the burly man warded off the sword lights all over the sky than the black dragon charged at him.

“Get out of my way!” The burly man shouted and hacked the Giant Axe in his hands outward, quick as a flash.

The huge and mighty Axe Shadow directly tore the black dragon open. However, there was a power hiding in this dragon. It suddenly released and made the burly man take several steps backwards.

At this time, Jian Wushuang moved in a strange way and stared at the burly man. All of a sudden, a fierce wind blew.

“Spell of Disturbance!”

Jian Wushuang continually wielded his sword. Sword shadows, along with the gale, formed a real storm that covered the burly man completely.

Innumerable sword shadows attacked the burly man fiercely. All the sword shadows affected the spacetime and thus were incredibly fast.

The burly man also tried his best to fend off the sword shadows with his Giant Axe.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Sounds of collisions were heard continually. The burly man was trapped in the storm of sword shadows and looked terribly bad.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang emerged from the storm and his eyes radiated with sharp light.

“Triple Waves!”

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Three consecutive sword shadows broke free from Jian Wushuang’s hands in the blink of an eye.

Although they were merely three sword shadows, when they combined together, they were more like three waves rushing forward in succession.

The burly man immediately resisted them.

Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!

As three deep sounds rang out, the burly man took three steps backwards. Every step was at a distance of ten thousand miles and smashed the Void below him.

After the burly man regained his balance, he looked at Jian Wushuang again. Although he still looked indifferent, there was a trace of horror in his eyes.

After fighting with him for a short period, he was able to detect Jian Wushuang’s power. Although it was not much better than that of 1,500 years ago, he had made great progress in swordsmanships.

It was an immeasurably vast difference.

Jian Wushuang himself was stunned as well.

“It seems that I have underestimated this Puppet Fighter.”?Jian Wushuang admired secretly.?“I have just displayed the swordsmanships that I have created over the years, however, I?just barely gained the upper hand.”

Jian Wushuang executed a lot of swordsmanships right at that moment.

All of them were created by himself these years.

Among them, the Heaven’s Bane, Yin Dragon Power, and Spell of Disturbance acquired a substantial improvement from the original basis.

The Yin Dragon Power was the improved version of the Bladed Surge. It contained more than one wave of hidden power and was far more powerful.

Likewise, the Spell of Disturbance was the improved version of the Death Shadow and was faster than the Death Shadow. It enabled cultivators to strike out the sword hundreds of time at one go. Each time the sword would influence the spacetime and contain horrifying Soul Attack Power.

Nonetheless, the burly man managed to withstand this blow too.

The Bright Moon and Triple Waves were the swordsmanships that he had lately created. They were also fabulous.

The burly man looked at Jian Wushuang surprisedly.

“Your swordsmanships are much better than before. With such swordsmanships, you totally can have the upper hand in the fierce battle with me and even suppress me, but they are not sufficient if you want to defeat me.” The burly man said in a low voice.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

What he was required to do was to defeat the burly man if he wanted to pass the ultimate test.

Though suppression and defeat seemed to be of a similar nature, there was still a huge gap between them, in fact.

If this was all Jian Wushuang could do, he still couldn’t past the ultimate test this time.

“I have already said it before that I will definitely defeat you this time. I never break my word.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“So, what other means do you have?” The burly man stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled and did not deny that. He thought secretly,?“My two Original Bodies shared out the work and cooperated with each other over the past 1,500 years. They put all their energy into the study of swordsmanships. Moreover, I have an amazing gift in Sword Principles, and with the aid of so many manuals and Mirror Images, I surely have achieved great progress. The most important thing is that I have spent quite a long time to study them!”

It was his first time to cultivate for such a long time in the secret chamber.

For him, this period was enough for a dramatic change to occur on his strength.

However, he spent it just to study swordsmanships. So how great the progress he achieved on swordsmanships would be?

And of course, this would never be all he could do!

“My biggest achievement these years is that I have created a sword movement coincidentally!”

“Since I created it at dawn, I named it Dawn Light!”

Jian Wushuang said gently. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Dawn Light?” The burly man knitted his brows. Although Jian Wushuang had not acted yet, he had already vaguely felt how exceptional that swordsmanship was.

Soon afterwards, Jian Wushuang took actions.

He lifted the Blood Mountain Sword with a single hand and looked quite casual.

Right at that moment… The whole world was caught in complete darkness.

There was not a little bit of light, just like the real night.

Furthermore, no sound was heard, even the sound of breathing. Horrible silence pervaded there.

Jian Wushuang held the longsword with his right hand and had no expression on his face. He struck the longsword outward the very next moment.

A flash of dazzling light appeared immediately.

It shone brightly above the sky, as if it was the first ray of light at dawn.

It stood for infinite hope.

When the burly man saw this ray of light, his pupils shrank.

Woosh! Silently, the Dawn Light came in front of him.

His expression changed dramatically and his power surged out crazily. Quick as a flash, he waved his Giant Axe outward.

He had done his best.

However… “Clang!”

A sound of metal collision rang out. The Giant Axe in his hands flew backwards due to the impact and the Dawn Light hit him unimpededly. Luckily, he was a Puppet Fighter. If he was a normal human expert, even if he was a Universe Master, his body would fall apart under this impact.

Boom!

The Dawn Light swept around crazily with blasts of air. The dark Void finally calmed down after quite a long time.
