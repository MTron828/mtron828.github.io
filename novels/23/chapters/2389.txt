Chapter 2390: Jian Wushuang and Miss Xiao (2)

Xiao Heng and his companions stared at Jian Wushuang as if he was some sort of monster.

They could not imagine that he could have already predicted what would happen since the very beginning and because of that, he had prepared an escape plan for himself.

Moreover, the escape plan was laid out simultaneously when he was busy slaughtering the Mu Clan experts.

A method such as that was truly shocking.

“Miss Xiao, there are already gaps in the Space-Time seal around us, and I’m in control of them. As long as I wish to, every single thing that happened here will be reported to Elder Wujian of Narcissus Island. At that point in time, you would not only deeply offend Nine Stars Palace, you would also profoundly offend Narcissus Island.”

“Of course, if you have the skills to kill me before I could even transmit the message, then by all means please make your move.”

“I’m not trying to be arrogant, but just by using your bewitchment technique and your Peak Stage Divine Demon maid, even with enough time it would still be hard for you to kill me right here, let alone stopping me from transmitting the message.” Jian Wushuang while wearing a confident smile on his face.

When it came to battle strength, he was comparable to First-Class Divine Demon but still a far cry from Little Li’s Peak Stage Divine Demon.

However, it was not easy for a Peak Stage Divine Demon to kill him either.

The crucial point was that he was a Perfect Chaotic Creature, not to mention that he had fairly deep insights on Space-Time Law that would allow him to escape based on his own speed!

The second Perfect Chaotic Creature born in the world would not be someone who could get killed so easily.

Miss Xiao’s eyes calmly looked at Jian Wushuang.

Little Li on the side had her eyebrows locked tightly.

They both could feel Jian Wushuang’s absolute confidence and had to admit that they probably would not be able to kill him within a short time, even if they attacked him together.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re brilliant, but you truly look down on me. Narcissus Island? Nine Stars Palace? What are they? You really think that I would worry about them?” Miss Xiao burst out laughing.

“You wouldn’t, but you don’t like trouble, especially now. If my guess is right, you deliberately exposed your whereabouts to Mu Clan with full preparation beforehand and you’re probably going to attack them in the near future. At this juncture, you want to avoid provoking large sects like Narcissus Island and Nine Stars Palace,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Miss Xiao squinted immediately.

She did prepare to make a move on Mu Clan and she did deliberately expose her whereabouts to the Mu Clan.

However, how did Jian Wushuang predict all of that?

“Interesting, it’s getting more and more interesting.”

Miss Xiao’s tone had a shade of playfulness while she was speaking and the red light in her eyes started to reappear.

She was looking towards Xiao Heng and the four core disciples this time.

Xiao Heng and the core disciples could not react at all before their eyes started turning into a daze before immediately collapsing to the ground.

Jian Wushuang took a short glance behind at five of them and knew that Miss Xiao did not kill them but merely made them faint.

With the five of them blacked out, the only ones still standing were Jian Wushuang, Miss Xiao, and the chambermaid, Little Li.

Miss Xiao smiled. “Jian Wushuang, you do have superior eyes and could see behind everything, but I could also see quite many of your matters. When you were cutting down the Mu Clan’s men a while ago, you had utilized two secret skills.”

“The first secret skill was using a mysterious power that had already merged with your divine power, blood, and essence. This kind of power is really potent as it’s able to push your realm level from the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm all the way up to the peak of it and even extremely close to Peak Stage Divine Realm, directly p[promoting you by half a realm.”

“Secret skills that could directly level up your realm while not presenting any side effects are rare, even in the Ancient God Domain. If I’m not mistaken, what you used was the Seven Stars Secret Skill of Seven Stars Black Sect!!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked but did not show it on his face.

“As for the second secret skill which formed a 300 feet hologram behind you and pushed your battle strength even higher, I know it as well. It’s Divine God of Punishment from the Seven Stars Black Sect!!”

Rumor has it that Seven Stars Black Sect possesses five of the strongest secret skills, Seven Stars Secret Skills and the Divine God of Punishment were among them. The Seven Stars Black Sect regards secret skills like this as something extremely precious to them. They almost never pass it to outsiders. If an outsider had unusually good luck and was able to use one of the secret skills, he would be considered very impressive. However, to possess two of the secret skills from Seven Stars Black Sect, it’s absolutely impossible!”

However, to be at Middle Stage Chaotic Realm and possessing two secret skills from Seven Stars Black Sect? Haha, your relationship with the now perished Seven Stars Black Sect must be quite unusual.”

Miss Xiao stared at Jian Wushuang with a half-smile.

Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at her deeply, but smiled right away. “Miss Xiao also has very good eyes. The process of destroying the Mu Clan experts was very short and I only used the secret skills for an even shorter time yet you could still recognize them.”

However, just because you were able to identify these two secret skills, you have also exposed yourself at the same time.”

Neither Seven Stars Secret Skills nor Divine God of Punishment was the most important secret skills in the Seven Stars Black Sect. It’s not easy for someone to recognize these skills. It wasn’t even easy for someone who had fought against these two skills to identify them through my battle just now. The only people who’ve gotten extremely familiar with them through deep studies, been in contact with them physically, and practiced them could recognize the two secret skills at first sight.”

Miss Xiao, you’re the Second Miss of Mu Clan and was born in Wusha Wilderness. Up until now, you probably had less than twenty years of practice, so how could you’ve known about Seven Stars Black Sect? How could you be familiar with these two secret skills?”

“I’m afraid there is only one explanation to this, Miss Xiao. You arrived at Wusha Wilderness only after going through Samsara, am I right?”

Jian Wushuang stared dead at Miss Xiao.

Miss Xiao also looked at Jian Wushuang at the same time, there was an absolute coldness in her eyes. Within the coldness, there was a bit of fear hidden!

Yes, it was fear!

Miss Xiao did not care much about Jian Wushuang in the beginning, but she really felt a little fear at that moment.

However, the fact is that Jian Wushuang had an even bigger fear towards her! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Both of them had extremely powerful minds and vision.

Miss Xiao identified the two secret skills that Jian Wushuang practiced and his unusual relationship with Seven Stars Black Sect simply by observing his short battle.

While, precisely because of that, Jian Wushuang could identify Miss Xiao as someone like himself who have been through the Reincarnation Passage and ended up in Wusha Wilderness using Samsara.
