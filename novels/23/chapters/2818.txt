Not long after, Elder Gu appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again.

“I’ve checked carefully. There are only a few corpse puppets left in the secret realm, except for those who must stay in the secret realm to stop the cultivators,” Elder Gu said.

“Not many? How many?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I tried my best to select 100 corpse puppets for you. I don’t know if I can help you,” Elder Gu said.

“100?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“Look.” Elder Gu waved his hand and streams of flowing light shot out. They appeared in the surrounding void and condensed into ice-cold figures.

These figures were all dead. There were a total of 100 corpse puppets standing in the surrounding void.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked around.

These corpse puppets were no different from the ones Jian Wushuang had seen before. They were all copper-armored, silver-armored, and gold-armored corpse puppets.

More than half of the copper-armored corpse puppets had the battle strength of an ordinary Advanced Divine Master. There were more than 60 copper-armored corpse puppets in the surrounding 100 corpse puppets.

There were 30 silver-armored corpse puppets with the battle strength of an Advanced Divine Master.

The remaining 10 were gold-armored corpse puppets!

“10 gold-armored corpse puppets, 30 silver-armored corpse puppets, and 60 bronze-armored corpse puppets!” Jian Wushuang was extremely excited.

100 corpse puppets meant 100 Great Divine Masters’ battle strength.

The weakest among them was an Advanced Great Divine Master, and there were 10 gold-armored corpse puppets, which was the battle strength of a Peak Great Divine Master.

All of them added together, this was a powerful corpse puppet army!

Yes, it was a corpse puppet army!

“There are 200 Great Divine Masters in the Heaven Void Temple’s army of 2,000 people. However, their strength is uneven. I’m afraid that many of them are Elementary Great Divine Masters, and there are definitely a few Advanced Great Divine Masters. As for Peak Great Divine Masters, there must be even fewer!”

“This time, only half of the Heavenly Void Palace Army, or 100 Great Divine Masters, gathered under the orders of the Master of the Heavenly Void Palace. The corpse puppet army standing in front of me now also has 100 Great Divine Masters. Their numbers are equal, but in terms of quality, the corpse puppet army clearly has the absolute advantage!”

“With the corpse puppet army in hand and the strength of Crimson Rock Castle and our Sword Alliance, our camp will definitely have the absolute advantage if we fight against the Heavenly Void Army now!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, but he was pleasantly surprised.

At this time, Elder Gu looked at him again and asked, “Su Han, are you satisfied with the 100 corpse puppets?”

“Yes, very satisfied.” Jian Wushuang nodded and said.

“In fact, these corpse puppets are nothing. They are just small things that master refined when he was alive. Master could refine saint-level corpse puppets when he was alive, but unfortunately, there are not many of them left in this secret realm. I can’t give you saint-level corpse puppets, but I have one corpse puppet with me, so I can give it to you,” Elder Gu said.

“There’s another one?” Jian Wushuang looked at Elder Gu in surprise.

Elder Gu smiled mysteriously and waved his hand again. In an instant, a streak of blood-red light shot out.

In front of Jian Wushuang, a corpse puppet in blood-red armor with skin that looked like it was made of blood appeared.

This corpse puppet was also lifeless. Since it had not attacked, Jian Wushuang could not immediately determine its strength.

“Elder Gu, what is this?” Jian Wushuang could only ask.

“It’s above the golden-armored corpse puppet. The blood-armored corpse puppet is also a corpse puppet at the divine master level. However, among divine masters, the blood-armored corpse puppet is invincible!” Elder Gu said.

“Invincible among Divine Masters? Invincible Divine Master?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Yes. According to the realm of the primordial divine world, his battle strength is comparable to that of the extremely rare Invincible Divine Master,” Elder Gu said with a smile.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

With the army of corpse puppets formed by 100 corpse puppets, he was confident that he could fight against the Heaven Void Army. The only problem was the invincible Divine Master of the Marquis of Three Yin.

He had been unable to find a way to fight against Marquis Three Yin, but now Elder Gu had given him a higher-level blood-armored corpse puppet that was comparable to the Invincible Divine Master. How could he not be surprised?

“Thank you, Elder Gu!”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and thanked Elder Gu immediately.

“You’re welcome. You deserve all the tests that your master left for you, and they’re just some corpse puppets. They’re nothing to the numerous opportunities in this secret realm,” Elder Gu said with a faint smile, but then he continued to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Su Han, I can give you another treasure in addition to these corpse puppets. That treasure should be of great use to you, but you have to agree to one condition.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned and looked at him subconsciously. “What’s the treasure that’s of great use to me?”

“I can show it to you first.”

Elder Gu smiled, but with a flip of his hand, a dark green jade bottle appeared in his hand.

He opened the cork of the bottle and immediately a green elixir the size of an adult thumb appeared in Elder Gu’s hand.

“This is... an elixir?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed as he stared at the green elixir.

He did not know this elixir, but since it was made by Elder Gu, it was definitely not an ordinary item.

However, Jian Wushuang did not know what effect it could have on him.

“Have you heard of the Saint Ascension Elixir?” Elder Gu looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Saint Ascension Elixir?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and subconsciously shook his head.

He had never studied alchemy. All he knew was some widely known elixirs in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

As for this Saint Ascension Elixir, he had never heard of it. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s normal that you don’t know. This Saint Ascension Elixir is located in the center of the absolute beginning divine realm. It’s quite famous in the third sky of your realm. However, outside the third sky, in this remote territory of yours, this Saint Ascension Elixir should only belong to the legends. Naturally, not many people know about it.” Elder Gu smiled faintly.

“It doesn’t matter if you haven’t heard about it. I can tell you about its effects now.”

Jian Wushuang listened carefully.

“As its name suggests, the Saint Ascension Elixir is an elixir that leads to the path of a saint. Its effects are actually similar to the royal gold core of a Divine Master.”

“The royal gold core can help a Divine Master breakthrough to become a Great Divine Master, and it can help a Great Divine Master break through his own realm. The Saint Ascension Elixir... can help a Peak Great Divine Master who has been stuck at a bottleneck for a long time breakthrough to the level of an Immortal Saint!”

Just as Elder Gu said this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened!

Help a Peak Great Divine Master breakthrough to the Immortal Saint level?

That was the Immortal Saint level!
