Chapter 2973: True Saint Battle Strength

——

“Human, die!!”

The black-armored Beast’s brutal aura rose again. It turned into a stream of light and rushed toward Jian Wushuang again.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, be careful!” Someone immediately warned him.

Jian Wushuang just smiled and flew out.

In the void, Jian Wushuang and the black-armored exotic beast’s speed burst out.

Bang! Bang! Clang!

Several sounds of collision resounded in the void. Jian Wushuang had already fought with the black-armored exotic beast several times. In the void, the afterimages of the two people constantly burst out.

“Terrifying! The speed of this black-armored exotic beast is too terrifying!”

“In terms of attack power alone, this black-armored beast is probably only comparable to an ordinary first rank True Saint, and might even be inferior. However, its speed is far faster than an ordinary first rank True Saint. With such speed, if this black-armored beast wants to kill us, it will definitely slaughter us.”

“With the speed of this black-armored beast so terrifying, I can immediately do it. After all, the talent of this beast is different from us human cultivators. However, the key point is, how can the speed of this Heavenly Sword Marquis be so fast?

“Look, he can completely keep up with the speed of the black-armored beast, and even fight it head-on without being at a disadvantage?”

The four members of the Barbarian King Team who had been pushed back were stunned.

They had just joined hands to block the black-armored beast, but in one move, the black-armored beast had seriously injured them and pushed them back.

But now, Jian Wushuang alone had blocked the black-armored beast?

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of violent explosions still resounded in the sky.

Jian Wushuang had blocked the black-armored beast, and on the other side, the Barbarian King, Puyu, and Xue Dong King were also attacking the Dragon Flame Beast with all their strength.

The Dragon Flame Beast had been seriously injured. Previously, the Barbarian King estimated that they could kill the Dragon Flame Beast within ten breaths, but in fact, it did not take them ten breaths.

In just the eighth breath, the Barbarian King’s huge axe struck the Dragon Flame Beast’s huge head. Sparks flew in all directions. Although the Dragon Flame Beast’s body protection ability was extremely strong, half of its head was still chopped off by this ax, then, the killing moves of Puyu and Xue Dong King followed. The Dragon Flame Beast was finally killed.

“It’s finally dead!”

Looking at the Dragon Flame Beast that was already killed, the Barbarian King, Puyu, and Xue Dong King were pleasantly surprised.

Then, they also noticed the scene in the void.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis…he stopped a True Saint-level exotic beast by himself. And this black-armored exotic beast is so powerful.” The Barbarian King’s eyes were full of surprise.

Puyu was also very surprised.

Xue Dong King was not surprised at all.

He was very clear about Jian Wushuang’s battle strength. Jian Wushuang could even fight a True Saint at the peak of rank one. So what if he stopped an ordinary True Saint-level exotic beast?

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

From time to time, a series of beast roars or hisses could be heard from the surrounding void. Apparently, a large number of exotic beasts had begun to gather in their direction.

“The Dragon Flame Beast has been killed. Let’s not tangle with these exotic beasts and leave quickly!” The Barbarian King shouted in a low voice.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Xue Dong King called out to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and easily got rid of the black-armored exotic beast.

“Let’s go!”

Everyone in the Barbarian King Team immediately left.

The black-armored exotic beast did not dare to chase after them.

…

An hour later, in a remote void, everyone in the Barbarian King Team stopped.

“I killed the Dragon Flame Beast, and its body is in my interspatial ring. This mission is much easier than I expected,” the Barbarian King said with a laugh.

“That’s true, but it’s mainly because our team is very strong,” Puyu said with a smile.

“Yes, it’s all thanks to Heavenly Sword Marquis.” The Barbarian King immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

He was not the only one. Everyone else could not help looking at Jian Wushuang.

Everyone present saw the scene clearly.

If Jian Wushuang had not stopped the black-armored beast by himself, they would not have been able to kill it so easily.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I doubted your strength before, but now I apologize to you. And this time, it’s all thanks to you,” the Barbarian King said directly.

“So do we,” the Peak False Saints beside them said one after another. They had mixed feelings at the moment.

When they first saw Jian Wushuang, they did not put him in their eyes at all.

Even though Jian Wushuang did not lose in the three head-on battles with Ah Chao, they only approved of him and allowed him to join the team, but they still felt a little proud, after all, they were Immortal Saints, and Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master.

But now…

After the battle with the black-armored beast, the Immortal Saints in the Barbarian King Team no longer had any arrogance.

What a joke. Apart from the Barbarian King, Puyu, and Xue Dong King, who had True Saint battle strength and were not afraid of the black-armored beast, the other four people would definitely die if they fought against the black-armored beast alone, however, Jian Wushuang had stopped the black-armored beast alone.

His strength was obviously much stronger than theirs.

“True Saint, this Heavenly Sword Marquis definitely has the battle strength of a True Saint!” These people were secretly shocked and looked at Jian Wushuang with strange eyes.

It was incredible that a Divine Master had the battle strength of a True Saint!

Monster!

This was the evaluation of Jian Wushuang in the hearts of everyone present.

“Captain, what happened before is over. Let’s not talk about it anymore. Let’s talk about this mission first,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Okay.” The Barbarian King nodded and then became serious. “As I said before, this mission is very special. There are two stages.”

“The first stage is to come to the Dragon Flame World and kill a Dragon Flame Beast that is comparable to a True Saint. Now that we have completed this mission, we have two choices!”

“The first is to give up the second stage of the mission and leave the Dragon Flame World with the corpse of the Dragon Flame Beast. We will return to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s nest to hand over the mission. Although we haven’t completed the complete mission, we can still get a total of 20 million sacred elixirs even if we only complete the first stage of the mission.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If the eight of us split the twenty million sacred elixirs, each of us will be able to get quite a bit.”

At this point, the Barbarian King stopped and looked at the reactions of the people around him.

The members of the Barbarian King Team also looked at each other at this moment. They all had their own thoughts.
