Chapter 2603: Transmigration Sword Formation

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“One hundred million!”

Even for Jian Wushuang, hearing the final transaction price of the Spiritual Stone Staff made his heart tremble.

At that point, Primordial Stones were not much use for his cultivation and neither had he ever paid much attention to his financial foundations. However, he truly needed a huge amount of Primordial Stones to purchase The Stately Painting at that moment and would have been happy if the Spiritual Stone Staff was sold for 80,000,000. However, it was sold for 100,000,000 in the end.

His confidence was boosted with that 100,000,000.

“I wonder who’s the person in that room being so generous with her spending?” Jian Wushuang could not help but look at the room where the final offer was made.

Unfortunately, his spiritual power could not penetrate due to the restrictive shield. Naturally, he could not tell who that person was, but was probably a woman from that person’s voice.

The auction continued.

Treasures after treasures were presented on the display shelf.

Although those treasures were not remotely as valuable as the Spiritual Stone Staff, they were far from cheap. For example, the Heavenly Treasure offensive divine weapons were very rare in any stellar regions but they appeared quite often in the auction.

Huge amounts of various treasure types were displayed before the crowd with most of them being more valuable than regular Heavenly Treasure offensive divine weapons.

The many experts taking part in the auction were competing enthusiastically, trying to purchase those treasures.

Whenever an extremely valuable treasure appeared, it would cause a small stir in the auction.

In the blink of an eye, the auction had already gone on for a full day.

Within one day, a few hundred pieces of valuable treasures were being individually sold.

Among the four treasures which Jian Wushuang put up at the Star Picking Pavilion, the boxing gloves and pitch-black spear were sold one after another besides the Spiritual Stone Staff.

Among them, the final price for San Shouwang’s boxing gloves amounted to 1,150,000 while the pitch-black spear was sold for 2,050,000. More or less as predicted by the Black Chief.

At that point, Jian Wushuang only had the Heavenly Treasure defensive armor yet to be sold.

On the display stage, the Golden Chief waved his hand again and a jade slip immediately appeared then.

An extremely powerful sword essence shrouded the jade slip. Anyone could tell with a glance that it was not an ordinary item.

“Jade slip? Is that some secret technique?”

Everyone’s attention in the auction was attracted by it.

Jade slips were usually used to record information on secret techniques, secret literature, and various methods.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is a sword formation!” The Golden Chief’s loud voice resonated within the auction house, “The name of the formation is called ‘Transmigration Sword Formation’. It can only be studied by those who are highly skilled in sword principles and proficient in Transmigration Law.”

“Transmigration Sword Formation?” Almost everyone in the room felt doubtful.

Even the individual rooms’ experts on the second and third-floor felt a little lost.

They had not heard of the Transmigration Sword Formation.

However, in an individual room on the third floor, the beautiful lady’s pupils contracted. “Transmigration Sword Formation? Might it be the sword formation created by that man?”

“That man?” The four Heavenly Ultimate Gods standing behind her looked puzzling at each other. They had no idea who she was referring to.

On the display stage, the Golden Chief took in everyone’s facial expression and laughed. “Perhaps you haven’t heard of the Transmigration Sword Formation. If that’s the case let me explain in detail.”

“The Transmigration Sword Formation was the creation of a sword expert who studied Transmigration Law from many ages ago. His name was Tong Xin and most called him Tong Xin Saint, but some called him Sword Lord Tong Xin! He was someone who had pushed the sword principles to the extreme third stage. In other words, he was a terrifying sword expert!”

As soon as he made the introduction, there was a wave of exclamations within the auction.

The exclamation was not due to the fact the creator of the Transmigration Sword Formation was an Undying Saint, but due to the creator’s capability to be known as Sword Lord Tong Xin.

‘He managed to push his sword principles to the extreme third stage?’

Sword principles knowledge was vast and deep and the level of understanding could roughly fit into three different stages.

The first stage, Sword World!

The second stage, Infinity Sword Tree!

The third stage, Formation of All Things!

Each stage was a lot complicated than the previous and more difficult to achieve as well.

Take Purple Blood Saint for example who Jian Wushuang knew, he was an Undying Saint who was highly skilled in sword principles and extremely powerful.

However, he had only reached the second stage of the Infinity Sword Tree despite being so. Moreover, he was still very far from the third stage.

However, Sword Lord Tong Xin who created the Transmigration Sword Formation had understood the extreme third stage of sword principles, Formation of All Things. How could one fathom his greatness?

It was no wonder people called him a sword lord. Compared to the Purple Blood Saint, he was really very far ahead.

The Golden Chief continued, “Sword Lord Tong Xin’s level was only slightly below the peak of Undying Saint. However, he managed to roam the Ancient God Domain by relying on his sword skills and Transmigration Sword Techniques. He was almost invincible among the Undying Saint beyond the Third Heaven!!”

His words had caused a huge stir in the auction. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Invincible among Undying Saints?”

“Sword Lord Tong Xin was that amazing?”

“Although it’s only beyond the Third Heaven, it was already very impressive. Sword Lord Tong Xin was a true super expert!”

“An almost invincible existence among Undying Saints. The most powerful sword formation that he relied on is...”

Those eyes that were looking at the Transmigration Sword Formation began to burn with extreme desire.

However, many were keeping themselves level-headed, especially those second and third-floor experts in individual rooms.

A voice from a third-floor individual room immediately spoke, “I’ve learned about Sword Lord Tong Xin’s reputation in ancient literature. Although it was something that happened a few million years ago, he truly had such capabilities. However, the Star Picking Pavilion would never put it on this auction if it’s truly the Sword Lord Tong Xin’s creation, don’t you think?

“Even if you will, it’s unlikely to appear in an auction of this level. Instead, it will be featured in a much larger scale auction. Perhaps one that’s well attended by Undying Saints, so that they can compete for it.”

The crowd began to agree.

One had to have the capabilities of an Ultimate God or came from a prominent background to attend that auction. Therefore, none of them were idiots.

The most powerful sword formation created by an almost invincible Undying Saint appearing in an auction only attended by Ultimate Gods? It was not even the star item of the auction. Was that a joke?

As expected, the Golden Chief laughed.
