After a while, Great Emperor Purple Moon finally spoke again, “Everyone, this is very serious. From my point of view, let’s wait until the others arrive before we discuss this.”

Then, Great Emperor Purple Moon stole a glance at Jian Wushuang.

From the bottom of his heart, Great Emperor Purple Moon would be on Jian Wushuang’s side. However, Green Fire World was associated with many parties. He, who was an ordinary Great Emperor, couldn’t do much.

Hearing what Great Emperor Purple Moon had said, the three of them nodded simultaneously.

“Alright then. Let’s wait until the others arrive,” Abysmal Saint Master looked cold.

Their initial plan had failed anyway. It would be impossible if they wanted to conquer Green Fire World and get the biggest advantage.

However, even if they couldn’t get the biggest advantage, they absolutely wouldn’t want to see Jian Wushuang continue to conquer such a great treasure.

As for Jian Wushuang, he stood there without saying a word.

He knew that it was a matter of time until he would have to deal with experts from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Hence, he had been well prepared since long ago.

As time flew past, there were more and more experts that came to the void around Green Fire World.

The experts who came saw Green Fire World and they found out about the relationship between Jian Wushuang and Green Fire World.

Suddenly, there was shock and astonishment.

“No wonder Sword Emperor was so talented. It turns out that his hometown is Green Fire World!”

“It is only a unique place like Green Fire World that could nurture a genius like him. Plus, before the news of the ancient battlefield spread, Green Fire World possessed it. Sword Emperor definitely received great advantage from the ancient battlefield!”

“That’s a definite. I have heard of Sword Emperor’s billowing skills long ago. I think all his skills are from this ancient battlefield. Previously, during the war in Lineage of Star, they brought out so many Dao soldiers and where were they from? There’s no doubt they were definitely obtained from this ancient battlefield.

Countless experts were talking about it.

Then, most of the experts who were wandering in the ancient battlefield had already arrived outside Green Fire World. Even Great Emperors, besides Great Emperor Purple Moon, there were another three.

Including Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zi Xu and Great Emperor Colored Glaze, the fifteen Great Emperors on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, there were seven of them there.

As for the remaining Great Emperors, either they cultivated in seclusion all year round or they were staying back to guard Eternal Chaotic World.

Plus, these were merely human cultivators camp.

Those special tribes also had a large number of experts rushing over.

Especially the top four peak tribes that had Great Emperors standing guard.

The four peak tribes conquered a piece of sanctuary each among the special tribes. Their positions and foundations were extraordinary.

The four peak tribes were Ancient Gods, Sky-devouring Clan, God-Eater and Black Water Dragon.

Among the four, Ancient Gods were widely acknowledged as the best at close body combat. On top of that, they were also recognized as the most prosperous tribe. Their Ancient God Emperor was once known to be the top overlord in the first era as well.

Sky-devouring clan was known to be the most barbaric tribe. They grew through consumption of various bloodline powers. They had the smallest population but their overall power were second to Ancient Gods.

The remaining God-eater and Black Water Dragon tribes were ancient and they were extremely powerful as well.

Then, the four peak tribes had Great Emperors attending the scene personally.

The Great Emperor from Ancient God tribe who came had a total of nine stars in between his eyebrows!!

Behind the nine-star Ancient God, Jian Wushuang saw two familiar faces. They were King Gu Tong and King Gu You.

King Gu Tong were friends with Jian Wushuang.

It could be said that besides Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace who were always in the dark, all experts from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World were there.

And they only had one target, which was Green Fire World!!!

However, if they wanted to step foot in Green Fire World, they had to first wipe out the only hindrance, which was Jian Wushuang, who blocked the Green Fire World.

Jian Wushuang, Lord Spirit Sound and Jian Yi stood side by side. His gaze was cold as he glared at the thickly dotted experts in front of him.

He felt an unprecedented pressure.

“I’m impressed. So many Chaotic Realms. I think more than half of the cultivators of the Chaotic Realm from this era gathered here.” Lord Spirit Sound was astonished. She looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Jian Wushuang, there are so many people who are eyeing Green Fire World. Are you confident you can protect it?”

“I don’t know,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“You don’t know?” Lord Spirit Sound creased his eyebrows.

“I really don’t know, but I can play a bet,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and there was determination in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang’s body immediately moved and he flew to the experts in front.

When he arrived before the experts, Jian Wushuang stopped and took a deep breath. He bowed to the experts and spoke, “I greet you all. Everyone should be here for my Green Fire World. However, it’s a pity that Green Fire World is only a small temple. It can’t contain so many experts. Hence, I apologize for the shortcomings in our hospitality.”

“Sword Emperor.”

There was a cold voice. A tall man who was red-skinned as though he was covered in flame stood out.

The tall man was called Yan Zun, one of the Great Emperor from Sanctuary Alliance.

However, there were fifteen Great Emperors on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list and Yan Zun happened to be in the fifteenth place.

Then, Yan Zun said with a loud and clear voice, “Green Fire World is the core of the battlefield. It contains boundless potential and magic. Such an important place shouldn’t be conquered by you alone. Please hand over Green Fire World. You are also a member of Sanctuary Alliance. As long as you hand over Green Fire World, Sanctuary Alliance won’t mistreat you too. We can discuss to let you keep territory in Green Fire World. What do you think?”

“Keep territory? I wonder Mister Yan Zun, how about the cultivators in Green Fire World?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This...”

Yan Zun thought for a while and answered, “If Green Fire World were to be that magical, Sanctuary Alliance would definitely remake a brand new sanctuary that is far better than any one of the ten cultivation sanctuaries. It might even surpass Thunderbolt Island. However, such an important place isn’t suitable for any ordinary cultivators there. However, don’t worry. We will find a way to relocate all your cultivators in Green Fire World. I assure you that they will continue to cultivate and grow.”

Although it was Yan Zun’s speech, he had been in Sanctuary Alliance long enough that he was certain that the result would be as such after the discussion among the higher-ups from Sanctuary Alliance.

However, the result was definitely not something Jian Wushuang wished for.

As expected, Jian Wushuang’s face grew cold.
