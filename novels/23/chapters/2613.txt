Chapter 2614: Life Conquers All!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In addition to those people who fought on the battlefield, many experts and Earth Ultimate Gods who stood watching from a distance outside the battlefield including a few Heaven Ultimate Gods all knelt with their eyes widened in surprise.

Even Star Picking Pavilion’s purple-robed supervisor and his three Golden Chiefs in the secluded void could not control their legs—joining the others in kneeling.

The only person barely enduring the pressure and keeping himself from kneeling was Senior Meng.

“T-this pressure... Even I can barely stop myself from kneeling?” Senior Meng stared at his trembling legs and took a sharp breath of cold air.

He was a genuine Undying Saint and also the most powerful expert at that moment. That was probably the reason he was able to keep himself up.

In addition, he was quite far away from the battlefield where the life rating pressure was mainly asserting on before disseminated to its surrounding void, therefore it was not as strong in his current location and somewhat allowed him to resist the pressure.

However, he truly felt fear in him.

“This person.” Senior Meng looked with a terrified expression at the mysterious black-robed man who was at the edge of the battlefield.

The other experts present had also stopped what they were doing and turned their attention to that black-robed man.

The experts including the five Grand Ultimate Gods from those four top sects were frantically struggling to stand up but appeared weak under the extreme life rating pressure.

They felt as though they were not facing a human cultivator, but the boundless world or universe.

As though they were just some unremarkable ants in the infinitely wide world.

“Expert! Super Expert!”

“Is he an Undying Saint? No, even an Undying Saint will never be able to oppress Grand Ultimate Gods like us and force us to worship him on our knees. His oppressive pressure is so extraordinary and nothing like divine power. It’s something even more terrifying and intimidating than divine power pressure!”

“It’s not something within the capabilities of an Undying Saint. This person is definitely above the Undying Saint.”

“A Super Expert above the Undying Saint? My goodness!”

“Could he be after the Huangji Golden Pill as well?”

“That can’t be right. Even if it’s a treasure worth a hundred or even a thousand times more valuable than the Huangji Golden Pill, it’s insignificant in the face of such a powerful person. Let alone the Huangji Golden Pill.”

The experts were soon in suffocation.

Their bodies trembled from feeling terrified, but no one dared to utter even a single word.

They could only grumble and complain in their hearts while trying to guess the reason such a Super Expert was there. None dared to speak for fear of irritating the Super Expert.

The battlefield fell into complete silence with those countless experts surrendering themselves to the mysterious black-robed expert.

Suddenly, the mysterious black-robed expert moved.

He moved slowly like he was sauntering in a garden and arrived at the battlefield’s center in just a few steps.

He went up to the Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master.

The Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master was no longer in his usual posture as he was prostrating with his head hung low without even daring to look up at the mysterious black-robed expert.

Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master remained in that posture until the mysterious black-robed expert finally stopped in front of him. The black-robed expert slowly stretched out his palm.

The Young Palace Master was frightened and said, “Sir, I’ve already given the Huangji Golden Pill to Elder Heng. The Huangji Golden Pill is with that person over there.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Young Palace Master pointed his finger to the blond youth next to him who was one of the Grand Ultimate Gods from Nanwu Palace.

The Young Palace Master thought that Huangji Golden Pill might not be safe in his hands, hence he had given it to the Nanwu Palace Grand Ultimate God for safekeeping before the battle. He thought the mysterious black-robed expert was after the Huangji Golden Pill, so he pointed the mysterious black-robed expert toward it.

Unexpectedly, the mysterious black-robed expert did not even glance at the blond youth. His exposed cold eyes remained looking down on the Young Palace Master. His low and hoarse voice emerged from behind the mask. “The Stately Painting in your hand. Hand over it now and I’ll spare your life!”

“The Stately Painting?” The Nanwu Palace Young Palace Master was startled.

The experts present were stunned.

Everyone thought the mysterious black-robed expert was also after the Huangji Golden Pill, but they were surprised that his target was the Stately Painting.

“Did he say his Stately Painting?” Many of them reflected on the mysterious black-robed expert’s words.

Senior Meng’s eyes were twinkling in the void not far away.

“So, it’s exactly as I expected! The Stately Painting indeed has a master and someone who can maneuver such a Holy Treasure must be a great cultivator—probably a top-tier Undying Saint. He’s probably someone invincible who surpasses the Undying Saint level. His appearance even made an Undying Saint like me feel compelled to kneel and worship him despite such a far distance between both of us. This level of strength must have exceeded the level of an Undying Saint!”

“He’s indeed an invincible expert. I didn’t expect to see a Super Expert like this again in my lifetime. I can now die without regrets.” Senior Meng softly sighed.

The still kneeling Star Picking Tower purple-robed executive and his three Golden Chiefs behind Senior Meng were so cautious they dared not even breath out loudly.

“What’s going on? Did you not hear what I’ve said?” The black-robed man spoke again with a flat voice.

“N-no, I’ve heard it. The Stately Painting is with me. I’ll immediately take it out.” The Young Palace Master dared not hesitate and immediately retrieved the old and browned painting from his Interspatial Ring—the Stately Painting which he bought from the auction at the price of 1,300,000,000 Primordial Stones.

He initially bought the painting out of curiosity and thought of bringing it home with him to try claiming ownership of it. It was only at that moment he realized the Stately Painting already had an owner.

Its master was someone incredibly powerful!
