Chapter 1726: The First Era

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Blood Cloud Palace?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Blood Cloud Palace is a special place in the Third Lair,” Hall Master Yuan explained, “In the Eight Lair, the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Lair are ordinary. The biggest threat derives from Star Demon clan. However, besides the three lairs, the remaining five lairs are battlefields left behind from the first era or ancient times. Not only are there Star Demons, but there are also various dangers.”

“Where there’s danger, there are, of course, opportunities.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised. He knew the Eighth Lair to a certain extent.

He also knew that besides the lair of Star Demon clan, the Eight Lairs were huge battlefields.

The battlefields were segregated into two kinds. One was a battlefield from ancient times, which was of a higher level, also most mysterious. Among the Eight Lairs, it was said that only the First Lair was the true battlefield left from ancient times.

As for the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Lairs, they were battlefields left from the first era.

The so-called first era was a new era after ancient times ended.

Ancient God Emperor, who was supreme in Ancient God tribe, was a super expert that was famous during the first era.

However, the first era didn’t last long because it was destroyed after a huge war. Then, the second era started, which was the Eternal Chaotic World that Jian Wushuang was currently in.

“Ancient times, first era, second era… Three different eras but ancient times was the strongest. The first era is far behind compared to ancient times but it is also far stronger than the current Eternal Chaotic World,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He knew that the universe that he was in, as they reproduced and as the time flew past, the overall power of cultivators was sliding down, and sliding down massively.

In ancient times, it would have been prosperous.

There were countless experts. Whichever one would be a supreme existence in the current era. There were even rumors in Eternal Chaotic World that said an Emperor God was nothing back in ancient times.

Jian Wushuang was once in the independent space. He had seen a painting of war in ancient times before Long Qi’s master’s coffin. The painting showed clearly how scary the experts in the war were.

The first era, although it wasn’t as strong as in ancient times, had also given birth to a ten-star Ancient God superb expert like Ancient God Emperor.

However, in Eternal Chaotic world, also during the second era, forget about experts who could be compared favorably with those in ancient times, even experts like Ancient God Emperor didn’t exist.

The strongest in the current era was Great Emperor!

It was widely acknowledged.

It was because the ancient times and the first era were much stronger than the current era, the battlefield that they had left behind was so attractive to the experts in Eternal Chaotic World.

Many Almighties opted to wander in the Second to the Fifth Lair. It wasn’t because they wanted to hunt the Star Demons but because they were going for the battlefield from the first era.

They were going for the opportunities on the battlefield.

“In the Third Lair, there were many special places. There are four most famous places and Blood Cloud Palace is one of them.

“Blood Cloud Palace was left behind by a strong Great Emperor in the first era. The Great Emperor could be in the top three among all expert of Great Emperor level in the first era. In the current Eternal Chaotic World, there shouldn’t be anyone who could match him.”

“In the Blood Cloud Palace that he left behind, there are great opportunities. However, Blood Cloud Palace will only open once in a very long time. Every time it opens, only one with a designated token can enter, and that’s what this jade sword is.”

“It is said that the token for Blood Cloud Palace are ten jade swords. There is a total of six unearthed jade swords and there are four that have yet to be found. I never expected Sir God Dan Hong, who passed away so long ago, to have had one of the jade swords and been hiding it.”

Hall Master Yuan sighed.

Jian Wushuang heard and he was complementing in silence.

From Hall Master Yuan’s story, Jian Wushuang could tell the value of the jade sword.

It was a palace left behind by a top Great Emperor from the first era. The value should be unbelievably high if even a Great Emperor would be tempted.

Although the jade sword was merely a token, it was priceless. If he were to take it out, it might stir up a crazy fight among all Almighties.

Jian Wushuang had only received such a treasure out of sheer luck.

“Hall Master Yuan, when will be the next time Blood Cloud Palace opens?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I happen to know but it’s a pity as it is a long wait for you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“How long exactly?” Jian Wushuang asked closely.

“Eight million years!” Hall Master Yuan answered.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Ever since he was born and had started cultivation, it had only been tens of thousands of years. The next opening would be another eight million years?

Maybe to other Almighties, eight million years was nothing, as many Almighties could live for very long, far longer than eight million years.

However, to Jian Wushuang, it was really a long wait.

“Jian Wushuang, although you can’t use the jade sword for now, it is priceless. Keep it carefully. Who knows when you might need to use it,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. He then put the jade sword in his Qian Kun ring and intentionally put it in an obvious spot.

After Jian Wushuang left from Hall Master Yuan’s place, he returned to his Sword Star.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat down. There was a jade bottle floating in front of his face. In the jade bottle, there were elixirs that make one’s mouth water. There was a total of nine.

Jian Wushuang poured one Taiqing Ancient Panacea out from the bottle. He then consumed it without hesitation.

The moment the elixir entered his body, it instantly turned into billowing divine power that Jian Wushuang absorbed and transformed.

The speed of absorption and transformation was shockingly fast.

Three days later, in Jian Wushuang’s body, the eighty-ninth drop of Ultimate Divine Power Droplets precipitated and he expended less than half of the divine power in the Taiqing Ancient Panacea.

“Taiqing Ancient Panacea lives up to its name. This elixir is so efficient!” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

With less than half the elixir, he had already precipitated the eighty-ninth drop of Ultimate Divine Power Droplet. If he were to absorb the Taiqing Ancient Panacea fully, Jian Wushuang reckoned he should be able to precipitate the ninetieth Ultimate Divine Power Droplet.

And, he had a total of nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.

“Although it is said that it will be more difficult in the later stages of precipitating Ultimate Divine Power Droplets, I have nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas. Even if I can’t reach the extreme limit of my divine power, I reckon I shouldn’t be too far away from it.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. With anticipation, he continued to absorb the elixir.
