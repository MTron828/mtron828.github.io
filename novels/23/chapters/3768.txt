Chapter 3770: Challenge

“This power is a little too strong.”

Jian Wushuang was a little excited, and his eyes were full of surprise and joy.

He had thought that activating the second level of the Dark Gold Magic Dragon Armor would not increase his strength too much. After all, it was only 30% of the Magic Dragon Power.

But in fact, the 30% Magic Dragon Power was too strong for him. He did not use any secret skills or techniques, but the power burst out in an instant, Jian Wushuang felt that he was still slightly stronger than an ordinary Senior Ruler and was almost close to his peak power.

After all, he did not use his life divine power, Heaven-cleaving skill, or the power of his will given by the universe principles.

The power was so strong without using these things. If he used all his strength...the power would not be weaker than an ordinary Superior Ruler.

“With 30% of the Magic Dragon Power from the Dark Gold Magic Dragon Armor, my power should not be much weaker than that of a Superior Ruler. In terms of swordsmanship and comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle, I am definitely no weaker than a Superior Ruler. In addition, I have the support of the most powerful Flight Type True Treasure, such as the Celestial Light Wings. With the help of the Mystic Light Phantom movement technique and the suppression of the domain...”

“Now, I really want to find a genuine Superior Ruler to spar with.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

He had fought with a Superior Ruler before.

But this so-called fight was just to save his life.

A Superior Ruler could not kill him, but he could easily crush him. Jian Wushuang was very clear about this.

...

However, now that he had the Dark Gold Magic Dragon Armor, which gave him power comparable to a Superior Ruler, he looked forward to a real fight with a Superior Ruler.

He was absolutely confident that if he encountered a Superior Ruler again, he would definitely be qualified to fight him head-on.

If he used his innate divine power, the original universe, he could even suppress an ordinary Superior Ruler within ten breaths.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, how powerful is the armor?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master looked at him. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Very good.” Jian Wushuang stood up with a smile on his face. “With this Supreme True Treasure Armor, not only will my protective ability reach a new level, but my strength will also increase by a level.”

“Oh?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master looked at each other.

In their eyes, Jian Wushuang’s strength was already strong before, but now, it had increased by another level?

Could it be that he could fight against a Superior Ruler?

“With this Supreme True Treasure Armor, we have achieved our purpose in coming to the Red Cloud World, and you have also obtained a Supreme Flight Type True Treasure. This can be said to be a great surprise. As for the following...although the Red Cloud World will still be closed for thousands of years, it doesn’t matter if we can get another treasure in the remaining thousands of years,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He now had not only a supreme attack type True Treasure, but also a Supreme True Treasure Armor, a Supreme Flight Type True Treasure, and a Supreme Suppression Type True Treasure.

He basically had a Supreme True Treasure in all aspects. The only thing he lacked was a supreme Domain Type True Treasure.

However, he had a Pinnacle Domain Type True Treasure, and with the combination of the two, his domain power was close to that of a supreme Domain Type True Treasure.

Just as Temporal Temple Master had said, his gains in Red Cloud World over the years had been huge, and they had long exceeded his expectations. As for whether he could obtain other True Treasures, there was no need to force it.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what are your plans next?” asked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master.

“My strength has improved a lot since I got the Dark Gold Magic Dragon Armor. Now, I really want to fight with top-tier Rulers. Almost all the top-tier Rulers in this Star Field are in the Red Cloud World, so I plan to continue adventuring here. I don’t want to obtain True Treasures, but only to hone my swordsmanship and fight with those top-tier Rulers,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay. With your current strength, you can survive a Supreme Ruler even if you can’t defeat him. Heaven-cleaving and I won’t stop you. You can continue to roam around here,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“By the way, Don’t forget the legend of the Red Cloud World, which is Heaven-Treading Mountain.” Temporal Temple Master reminded him again, “If possible, go to Heaven-Treading Mountain earlier. With your talent and strength, you might have a chance to pass it.”

“I remember,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Of course, Jian Wushuang would not forget the Heaven-Treading Mountain.

He still wanted to explore the Red Cloud World for a while. It would be best if he could fight with one or two Superior Rulers. After that, he would go to the Heaven-Treading Mountain.

Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master left.

Jian Wushuang continued to explore the Red Cloud World.

However, he no longer had any thoughts about the Supreme Treasures in the Red Cloud World. His goal was to fight with the top Rulers, so there was no need for him to stay on the Third Continent, instead, he went to the continents where there were top Rulers and began to explore.

More than 5,000 years after the Red Cloud World opened, Jian Wushuang, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and Temporal Temple Master jointly killed Pupil Master. The battle shocked the entire Red Cloud World.

400 years later, on the Second Continent, Jian Wushuang encountered an extremely powerful Advanced Ruler, Master Icefox, in a fight for a Supreme Treasure.

Master Icefox was a very famous Advanced Ruler. His battle strength was definitely among the best among the Advanced Rulers, and he was slightly stronger than the Tyrant Axe Ruler.

After the encounter, Jian Wushuang directly challenged Master Icefox. The two fought, but the battle only lasted for a short while before Master Icefox admitted defeat and admitted that he was no match for Jian Wushuang.

In the 6600th year since the Red Cloud World opened, Jian Wushuang met Doom Ruler again.

Doom Ruler was an overlord of this Star Field. Although his battle strength was not as strong as a Superior Ruler, he was one of the few people in this Star Field who dared to challenge a Superior Ruler.

His attack power was extremely powerful and far exceeded that of an ordinary Superior Ruler. He was also very good at speed and body protection. He also had many secret skills and no weaknesses.

Because of this, many people in the Star Field thought that the Doom Ruler was the number one person under a Superior Ruler.

However, after fighting Jian Wushuang, the title of the number one person under a Superior Ruler was immediately changed.

The battle was extremely fierce. At first, Jian Wushuang only used his life divine power, Heaven-cleaving skill, and the power of the will given by the universal principles. With the advantage of his domain, he fought fiercely with the Doom Ruler, it was only a tie, but with Jian Wushuang’s Mystic Light Phantom movement...
