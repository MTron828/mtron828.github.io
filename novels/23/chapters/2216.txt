Chapter 2217 Real Martial Arts Divine Church

“Looks like something happened within the Real Martial Arts Divine Church,” Jian Wushuang muttered. He had a keen look.“This was the reason why I messaged you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Alright. I will settle this. Disciple, do you have anything important to settle in the short run?” Jian Wushuang said.

“No,” He Xiu answered.

“If that is the case, follow me to the territory that the Real Martial Arts Divine Church controls,” Jian Wushuang instructed.

“Roger,” He Xiu nodded his head.

Soon, Jian Wushuang set off.

...

The Real Martial Arts Divine Church was located in one of the sanctuaries and occupied a large territory.

Before the battle at the Lineage of Stars, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church had been an overlord in this territory and was one of the strongest clans in the Eternal Chaotic World.

After the battle in the Lineage of Stars, their leader had died and their overall combat power was far worse compared to before. Even though they were still the most powerful clan on their territory, they were not as dominant anymore.

However, within the last one thousand years, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church seemed to have recovered.

They had become as dominant and overbearing as before. They had even dared to provoke Lineage of Stars. Those clans that tried something funny during the time they were weak were all eliminated.

The Real Martial Arts Divine Church had once again become the overlord of this territory and no one dared to provoke them.

Within the Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

An elder man in white robes was in an independent space somewhere within the group of majestic buildings.

The aura from this elder man was of the level of emperor god. He was the last emperor god that the Real Martial Arts Divine Church had, Emperor God Bai Xing.

Emperor God Bai Xing was one of the weakest emperor gods in the Eternal Chaotic World. However, he was still an emperor god, and hence he took over the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and became its new leader.

“Church Master.” A man in crimson armour appeared beside Emperor God Bai Xing.

“Have you done the final checks?” Emperor Go Bai Xing asked coldly.

“Yes. There are a total of twelve thousand people that come from outside the sanctuary. We have checked that they are virgins under the age of thirty. According to the lord’s request, they have never cultivated nor explored the outside world before,” the man in crimson armour said.

“Okay,” Emperor God Bai Xing nodded his head as he looked up at a floating island in the sky.

Many beautiful girls sat on the barren island. They were not cultivators, evident from the fact that they did not radiate any spiritual power. They looked around, confused. They did not know where they were or what was going to happen to them.

“This batch is good. The lord should be satisfied. Now, go and prepare the next batch,” Emperor God Bai Xing said.

“Don’t worry, church master. I have already conquered ten ancient worlds and commanded them to groom young girls who do not cultivate or venture out to explore the world. Even though it is difficult to have one out of a thousand, it should be alright if ten of these ancient worlds groom at the same time. This can guarantee that we have enough numbers for the next batch thirty years later,” The man in blood armor said confidently.

“That’s good. Due to what happened to us back during the great battle, we were almost annihilated. Thank god we met the three lords. With their help, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church can return to, or even exceed its former glory. It is even possible to outshine Lineage of Stars and even Green Fire World to become the most powerful clan in the Eternal Chaotic World!” Emperor God Bai Sheng nodded his head and said.

“That’s right,” the man in crimson armour nodded his head seriously.

He was absolutely confident in the three lords.

“Okay. Can you take your leave first. I will inform the lords to come over soon,” Emperor God Bai Xing said.

“I shall take my leave,” The man in crimson armour said.

Emperor God Bai Xing waited for a short while. Whoosh!

A middle aged man in silvery, loose robes appeared.

“Greetings, my lord. According to your request, I have prepared another batch of twelve thousand virgins,” Emperor God Bai Xing greeted respectfully.

“Yes,” The middle aged man nodded his head as he looked up at the island filled with beautiful girls. He stuck out his tongue and gave a bloodthirsty smile.

The middle aged man then flew towards the island.

Emperor God Bai Xing turned back towards and left for his independent space. At the same time, he could clearly hear the sad and painful screeches and screams.

Emperor God Bai Xing did not hesitate at all as he quickly left the independent space and waited patiently.

Seven days later, the middle aged man in silvery, loose robes walked out of the independent space.

When he came out, his robes were blood red. His tongue was still out, licking what remaining blood there was around his lips. He looked hungry for more.

“I’ll come again after thirty years.”

The middle-aged man said before he left.

“See you, my lord.”

Emperor God Bai Xing watched the middle-aged man leave as he returned to the independent space.

The independent space turned into hell. On the island at the centre, there was a sea of blood as the dead bodies of girls were stacked up like mountains.

Emperor God Bai Xing did not feel bad at all as he commanded people to start cleaning this place up.

This was to provide a comfortable environment for the middle-aged when he would return thirty years later. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As for the middle-aged man, he returned back to a quiet palace.

When he appeared there, hum!

A blurry figure appeared from thin air.

The middle-aged man looked serious when he saw the consciousness incarnation and greeted, “Brother.”

“You went to absorb the blood of virgins?” the blurry figure asked.

The middle aged man laughed, embarrassed.

“Didn’t your older brother warn you to stop this addiction?” the blurry figure said with a deep voice.

“Brother, you too know that we were in slumber for so many years. It has been too long since I tasted the splendid virgin blood. I finally managed to awaken. Of course I will take this chance to have a taste,” the middle aged man said.
