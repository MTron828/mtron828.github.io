Chapter 2712: A Big Surprise

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

For example, Strange Old Snake was an extremely powerful Primary-level Grand Ultimate God.

However, he did not have many Divine Elixir Pills. He had asked for 4,000 Divine Elixir Pills when Palace Keeper Si Zhen contacted Strange Old Snake and asked him for help, which was a lot to ask for. After bargaining persistently, Palace Keeper Si Zhen offered Strange Old Snake 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills and 2,000,000,000 Primordial Stones instead which Strange Old Snake happily accepted.

1,000 Divine Elixir Pills was a windfall for Strange Old Snake.

On the other hand, there were some very poor Grand Ultimate Gods in Danyang Continent.

Scorpion King was one of them.

Scorpion King knew of Jian Wushuang’s identity when he first saw Jian Wushuang in Northern Darkstar Territory. He also knew Jian Wushuang needed a lot of Divine Elixir Pills so he gave Jian Wushuang all the 50 Divine Elixir Pills he had.

Scorpion King was ranked top among the Primary-level Grand Ultimate God and was even a little better than Fo Yi, but he only had 50 Divine Elixir Pills—showing how poor he was.

Of course, his wealth was attributable to Yin Su’er’s difficult situation as Scorpion King had contributed his resources including nearly all of his Divine Elixir Pills to Yin Su’er—which left him poor.

Jian Wushuang was surprised to be able to bag 4,000 Divine Elixir Pills from Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring.

After that, Jian Wushuang continued to dig into the various treasures in the Interspatial Ring.

There were countless treasures in Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring. Among them were many mystical weapons, secret techniques, and a myriad of elixir pills.

Jian Wushuang was casually browsing through the treasures and something lying alone in the corner of the Interspatial Ring suddenly caught Jian Wushuang’s attention.

“That is...”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened in astonishment and disbelief. He then flipped his hands and the item appeared in front of him.

It was an ancient scroll with an archaic feel.

Jian Wushuang’s heart shook at the sight of the ancient scroll.

He was so familiar with the scroll because he had an exactly similar one with him.

Wow!

A similar scroll that he owned appeared on his other palm when Jian Wushuang waved his hand again.

The two scrolls were identical such that even their spiritual aura was the same.

“Fengtian Scroll!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

It was a Fengtian Scroll!

Crimson Stone Saint gave Jian Wushuang a Fengtian Scroll in the Saint’s Tomb.

It was exactly due to the Fengtian Scroll that Jian Wushuang had promised Crimson Stone Saint to help Yin Su’er to relieve the tormenting situation afflicting her.

Crimson Stone Saint said the Fengtian Scroll was extremely precious and had paid a hefty price back then to obtain the scroll.

However, Jian Wushuang had just taken out another Fengtian Scroll from Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring.

“Let’s check if this is the Fengtian Scroll?”

Jian Wushuang immediately opened the scroll while trying to control his excitement.

A huge stellar map instantly appeared in front of him.

There were light spots on the stellar map like dazzling stars moving slowly. Jian Wushuang carefully meditated upon it and could feel the vast expanse of heaven and earth from the star map.

“This is indeed a real Fengtian Scroll!” Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

Fengtian Scroll was a very rare treasure.

Jian Wushuang had been relying on meditating upon the Fengtian Scroll to improve his cultivation and was progressing at an astonishing speed.

He heard from Crimson Stone Saint that there were many Fengtian Scrolls and each of them was extremely precious. It would be of great use to any cultivator if they were able to have three scrolls at once—even for one at the Undying Saint realm.

Jian Wushuang had no idea what would happen if he obtained three Fengtian Scrolls, but he was certain that even a single scroll had tremendous benefits.

It was unexpected he would obtain a second Fengtian Scroll from Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring.

“How could this be? The Fengtian Scroll is so precious that even Crimson Stone Saint was struggling to get only one of it, yet Fo Yi is just a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. How did he get his hands on it?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

Unfortunately, he could not find the answers because Fo Yi had passed away.

“Well, it doesn’t matter how he got it. This Fengtian Scroll is now mine. Adding in the one I previously obtained from Crimson Stone Saint, I now have two scrolls with me.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed excitedly.” One scroll is already so useful. I wonder what will happen if I have two scrolls.”

Jian Wushuang was looking forward to finding it out. He then opened up both Fengtian Scrolls at the same time with a wave of his hand.

Instantly, two huge and wonderful star maps appeared concurrently in front of Jian Wushuang.

Both star maps started merging into one in the blink of an eye, forming a more complete star map that covered a larger area.

At the same time, the Cosmic Mystery within the star map became even more abstruse than before such that its abstruseness had been multiplied by several folds.

Jian Wushuang tried to understand the Cosmic Mysteries and tried to mediate upon the scrolls. He discovered his speed of gaining insights was several times faster than before!

Jian Wushuang was stoked to make the discovery.

The best thing about the Fengtian Scroll was the Cosmic Mystery within. He could use it to improve his understanding of laws and Sword Principles at a faster pace using such a method. He had been doing that all along and it helped him to improve his understanding of laws and Sword Principles at a rapid speed.

In just a few decades, he had reached his current achievement.

The progress of his meditation was already very fast. Could he possibly be even faster?

How incredible would that be? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The Heaven and Earth’s laws, not to mention the Sword Principles were deep and profound which became more difficult as I progressed further. My current understanding of the laws and principles is still at Peak Heaven Ultimate God level and I already find it much harder than before. I’ve obtained the second Fengtian Scroll today, hence my speed of gaining insight will increase once again, and with that my progress will then...” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands together tightly in excitement.

Accumulation of divine power was not difficult for any cultivators as it merely needed time.

Some people with prominent and resourceful backgrounds could absorb and refine Primordial Stones or Divine Elixir Pills to enhance their divine power.

It might be easy to improve one’s divine power, but increasing one’s understanding of the laws and principles was not as easy.

Many people were stuck at bottlenecks such that their progress remained stagnant for thousands of years at times—just like what Fo Yi had gone through before. The best way to make a breakthrough was using the Fengtian Scroll.

It was very important for Jian Wushuang to improve his understanding of the laws and principles.
