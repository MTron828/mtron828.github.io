Chapter 2726: One More

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was killed quite easily.

It was because they were a group of six Grand Ultimate Gods with the powerful Saber Master at the forefront to suppress the corpse puppet.

It was likely that even Hong Chen and Long Xianzi would be defeated in a one-on-one battle without Saber Master and them joining forces.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was terrifying.

“Devilish Wind King, I guess the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet is not the only danger in this cemetery, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course there’s more!” Devilish Wind King looked solemn. “The scariest thing in this cemetery is the corpse puppet, but the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet you saw was just one of them and it was attacking us alone.

“There are three types of corpse puppets in this cemetery. They are Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets, Silver-armored Corpse Puppets, and Gold-armored Corpse Puppets. Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets are the weakest, but their combat power is comparable to an ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate God. The one you saw was a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and those are comparable to the more powerful ones amongst High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and could easily crush an ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate God. As for the final Gold-armored Corpse Puppets—they are the scariest!

“The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet has the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God!”

“Did you say a Peak Grand Ultimate God?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The gap between each Grand Ultimate Gods level was huge. Saber Master was the top amongst High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. However, a Peak High-level Grand Ultimate God should be able to easily suppress and even kill the Saber Master. On the other hand, a Peak Grand Ultimate God should be able to defeat all six of them.

“Alliance Master Su Han, you probably don’t know why the six of us stopped in this cemetery the last time we came. We encountered a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet who was wearing an Interspatial Ring. We don’t know the exact combat power of the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. We wanted to kill it and take its Interspatial Ring away instead of running for our lives. As a result... ” Devilish Wind King’s face sank slightly when he narrated the story.

Jian Wushuang chuckled as he could guess what happened after that.

‘The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet possessed the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God, yet the six of them did not flee. They even tried to kill it and take away its Interspatial Ring. They must have a death wish!’

“In that battle, the six of us were completely crushed such that even Saber Master was badly injured in just a jiffy. We got scared and immediately fled. Fortunately, our life-saving methods were not too bad and Saber Master was holding it back to buy us time. We were lucky enough to escape, but most of us had been seriously injured—especially Saber Master. Besides that, we did not prepare any Corpse Poison Pill at the time and had to consume a lot of our divine power to resist the corpse poison’s erosion. We had no way to advance, hence choose to temporarily leave,” said the Devilish Wind King.

“Of course, the last time we weren’t prepared at all and we didn’t know the combat power of the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. However, we are all fully prepared this time. Even if we encounter the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet again, we know that we can flee if we can’t fight it and stand a greater chance of escaping.”

Jian Wushuang heard it and nodded.

“One more thing, the corpse puppets in this cemetery aren’t alone at the time as sometimes there are two or three together while other times more. There could be five to six Silver-armored Corpse Puppets or more than a dozen Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets grouped. In such cases, we can only run for our lives,” added the Devilish Wind King.

Jian Wushuang had a general understanding of the cemetery at that moment.

The group of six continued their journey and approached the cemetery’s end which was the deepest part of the ancient castle. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They knew the cemetery was not the location of the true opportunities in the secret realm, but rather a place they had to pass through to get to the true opportunities just like the previous two places of crisis.

Three hours passed in a blink of an eye.

During the three hours, the six of them encountered two other corpse puppets along their way.

The first encounter was four corpse puppets at one go, but those four corpse puppets were just Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets.

They were just as powerful as High-level Grand Ultimate Gods which Hong Chen and Long Xianzi could fight against in one on one. It was relatively easy for them to handle the four corpse puppets with the six of them.

After Saber Master beheaded the first Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet, the remaining three corpse puppets that joined the battle were easily resolved.

The second wave of corpse puppets they encountered was a little harder as there were two Silver-armored Corpse Puppets and one Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet.

However, those three corpse puppets merely gave them a little trouble and were handled in the end.

The downside was only two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets from two waves of corpse puppets had Interspatial Rings on their hands, so the six of them had little treasures to share.

The group of six did not slow down their pace.

They were vigilantly observing their surroundings while skimming forward.

Although they had sufficient understanding of the cemetery’s dangers, they dared not lower their guards due to the possibilities of unknown dangers popping up.

Suddenly...

Bang!

A stone coffin near them was abruptly lifted.

“Again?”

The six of them stopped and immediately set their eyes on the stone coffin.

After the first stone coffin was lifted... Bang! Bang! Bang! Three more sounds came within their earshots indicating three more stone coffins were opened at the same time.

“Four corpse puppets?”

Their expressions became a little solemn.

Four corpse puppets slowly stood up from those four opened stone coffins.

Among the four corpse puppets, two were filled with silver light and the other two were filled with bronze light.

“We have two Silver-armored Corpse Puppets and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets. This is a bit worse than what we previously experienced. The six of us can certainly handle them,” said Devilish Wind King confidently.

The other Grand Ultimate Gods including Jian Wushuang nodded.

They previously encountered two Silver-armored Corpse Puppets and a Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet at the same time and resolved it easily. It was certainly within their capabilities to cope with an extra Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet.

“Look, two of the four corpse puppets have Interspatial Rings on their hands,” Yi Shen exclaimed.

Jian Wushuang and the others also noticed that.

A Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet each were wearing an Interspatial Ring on their hands.

Their eyes instantly lit up.

However, just when the six of them were ready to eliminate the four corpse puppets in front of them... Bang! Another stone coffin opened.

“Another one?”

The group of six was taken aback as their gazes moved toward the stone coffin.
