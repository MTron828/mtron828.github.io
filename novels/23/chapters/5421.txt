Chapter 5420 - 5420: Show Their Divine Techniques

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A massive turtle shell appeared, and the sea within billions of miles instantly evaporated.

Zhen Wuyang also refused to be outdone, directly swapping the heavens and earth, causing the dark clouds to sink to the bottom of the sea.

Originally, everyone was in the depths of the sea for billions of miles, but suddenly it seemed like they were on the ground, with even the dark clouds appearing beneath their feet.

Without the dark clouds, the sky turned pure white with a hint of blue, and the sun and stars were dazzling.

From now on, the Black Demon Sea would cease to exist, and this sea area might disappear altogether.

Jian Wushuang stood at the back, swallowing hard and secretly thinking, ‘Is this necessary?’

This kind of formidable technique, was it meant to intimidate people?

There aren’t many tier 6 Emperors present!

Intimidating people doesn’t require such extravagance.

“Behave sensibly and hand over the Bloodluo Crystal!” Chishui was even more domineering, revealing his true form directly, transforming into a colorful four-legged exotic beast.

However, Gui Ling coldly snorted, taking the initiative to get close to Bai Junwang below and saying, “Fellow Daoist, we are all people of the Earth

Realm and can cooperate. We cannot let the inheritors take advantage.”

“Just you guys?” Bai Junwang pointed at them disdainfully, revealing a contemptuous expression. Then he continued, “You bunch of scraps still want to get the treasures of the Three Kings Court? It’s simply a fool’s dream.”

A force comparable to the peak suddenly erupted, directly suppressing everyone.

Bai Junwang forcibly increased his strength, and both his divine body and physical body were breaking apart, but he didn’t care.

Following behind Zhen Wuyang, Shang was low-key. Originally, he had no intention of taking action, but when he realized that Bai Junwangs strength exceeded expectations, he took a slow step forward and stood out.

He stood there, and that space belonged to him.

Jian Wushuang stared intensely at the figure below!

The familiar sensation made him understand that the opponent was a practitioner of the Ultimate Dao, and indeed, an Ultimate Emperor.

“Don’t act rashly; he’s a tier 6 Emperor, a tier 6 Ultimate Emperor!” Jian Wushuang frantically spread the word, trying to stop Bai Junwang from impulsively seeking death.

Though he couldn’t grasp the specific combat power of the opponent, the four words ‘Ultimate Emperor’ were irresistible.

Indeed, no one understood the Ultimate Dao better than Jian Wushuang.

If this Ultimate Emperor’s true self was here and not his avatar, he could suppress them with just one hand. Even if Bai Junwang returned to his peak, he wouldn’t be a match.

This was the formidable power of the Ultimate Dao, not to mention that the person in front had a realm far beyond everyone’s imagination.

Zhen Wuyang and others were at ease; with Shang present, who could stand against them?

Bai Junwang sneered, “Just an avatar!”

However, upon further consideration, in controlling this world, Shang far surpassed him and Gui Ling.

Although it was an avatar, the gap was still significant.

Shangs avatar only possessed one-tenth of his true power, but it was comparable to a supreme-peak powerhouse.

Not something a tier 6 peak could contend with.

Tier 6 Emperors were divided into three levels: ordinary, top, and peak.

As for the supreme-peak, it represented the limit of space or the divine body reaching its extreme.

With a body breaking through 60,000-fold, one could be considered a supreme peak-level.

However, within the Earthly Realm, the requirements for reaching the peak-level were much lower. The patriarch of the Nalan family, for instance, didn’t even deserve to be called supreme-peak.

Only Guangmu Tianzun in the Heaven Realm, along with Wu Zuo from the

Elder Palace and a few palace masters, were true supreme-peak powerhouses.

When Bai Junwang was at his best, he was a true supreme-peak powerhouse, and moreover, he was among the top experts in that level. He once brutally beaten Guangmu Tianzun and Bai Yi’s avatars.

The gap between the supreme-peak and the tier 6 Emperor was still significant.

It was like the disparity between the ordinary Origin Source Dao and the Ultimate Dao.

A tier 6 Emperor of the Ultimate Dao could already rival supreme-peak experts.

The main route Shang took was the cosmic secret technique, with no pursuit of pure combat power. He aimed to reach the peak in one go before considering his combat power.

Otherwise, with his Ultimate Dao, he could perfect the cultivation of space. Apart from the Zhen Ling, no one in the Qishen Temple could match him.

Even the Four Grand Temple Masters and the Five Great Demon Masters had to step aside.

The divine generals under the Qishen, each one an Ultimate Emperor, reached the supreme-peak level but lacked any breakthrough ideas. They could only be divine generals, not divine masters.

After experiencing the Ultimate Dao, everyone calmed down.

Gui Ling and others had somewhat shallow insights, being newcomers.

Although they didn’t understand completely, they knew that this was probably one of the top-level experts among the Inheritors. In a direct confrontation, they wouldn’t stand a chance.

Jian Wushuang swept his gaze around, and with Gong Miaoyi, he walked to Bai Junwang and said loudly, “Senior, let me say this: at this moment, we are about to open the ruins. If there’s a fight, let’s do it after we see the treasures inside,’

“Your words, little one, are interesting. I like that. Let’s open it first!” Gui Ling revealed a smile, easing the tense situation.

Jian Wushuang, seeing this, also breathed a sigh of relief. The current situation was beyond their control. He glanced at Bai Junwang and shook his head, signaling not to take action.

At this moment, with his current strength, he couldn’t intervene.

There was also the possibility of falling, even if he revealed his identity, it wouldn’t change much. He doubted whether Zhen Wuyang and the others would sacrifice the opportunity to seize the treasure for his sake.

Moreover, now that he was mixed with the people from the Kui Organization, they would have a reason to directly deal with him.

A force comparable to the peak suddenly erupted, directly suppressing everyone. He spoke, “Young Friend, you’ve been here for quite some time. You’re not waiting for us, are you?”

Then he pointed to the tombstone.

“Senior, originally there were two tombstones here. Using the Bloodluo Crystal, we could only open one, so it’s impossible to activate them both!” Jian Wushuang explained everything that had just happened, revealing some concealment but not mentioning the inscriptions above.

As soon as they heard that it couldn’t be opened, everyone’s expressions changed.

“Humph, this person is quite cunning. Senior, don’t trust him!” Luo Chuan glared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang frowned, his aura rising sharply. He shouted angrily, “A mere tier 4 Emperor, you have no right to speak here. If you dare to be disrespectful again, don’t blame me for being impolite.”

His aura had reached the tier 5 Emperor level, crossing the threshold. A tier 4 Emperor had no qualifications to be here, let alone dare to shout at Jian

Wushuang. It was as if he was seeking death.

Did the other party not consider the possibility of getting in but not being able to come out?

Jian Wushuang was not making threats but subtly reminding the tier 6 Emperors around him. With a slight movement during the confrontation, he could easily take Luo Chuan’s life.

No wonder he couldn’t thrive in MO Luo Country as well as the Crown Prince. His mind wasn’t suitable for navigating within the imperial dynasty.

Probably, being in seclusion made people foolish.

Maybe he hadn’t encountered as many people and things in his life as the ordinary folks selling pancakes on the streets of a common town.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

However, as the disciple of the Island Lord Gui Ling, Jian Wushuang didn’t say much. Under the guidance of Gui Ling, Luo Chuan also shut his mouth and stopped talking.

Meanwhile, Luo Sha, standing behind, sneered.

And behind Luo Sha, there were two people, a father and son. Jian Wushuang hadn’t noticed them yet, but if he did, he would be amazed at the terrifying nature of fate..
