Chapter 1876: Emperor Sword Palace Opened

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang and Luo Xianzi fought closely. The four Hong Jun Golden Swords attacked continuously and Luo Xianzi had to fight with her all.

The surrounding people who were watching the fight looked horrified.

“Sword Emperor’s close body combat is so terrifying!”

“I heard long ago that he had Ancient God bloodline and Ancient God is a unique tribe that is number one in close body combat. Most importantly, when he was fighting at close quarters, he still could use the four golden swords. The golden swords’ speed and power aren’t affected at all. He is so scary!”

“Merely with the attack of the four golden swords, he once defeated Palace Master Wu Luo. Now, he displays his fierce body combat skill… My goodness!”

The experts exclaimed.

Of course, Jian Wushuang revealed fierce fighting power and Luo Xianzi wasn’t too shabby herself.

Her swordsmanship was too powerful, too impressive.

Jian Wushuang was good with swords. In terms of swordsmanship, he was slightly behind Luo Xianzi.

Luo Xianzi’s swords movement was unpredictable, like an ocean, like a boiling volcano, like lofty overlapping mountains.

In addition to the assistance of her clone, she didn’t have the lower hand even when she was dealing with Jian Wushuang’s fierce attacks.

The battle was extremely ferocious.

The experts who were watching were burning with enthusiasm.

The fight merely lasted for a short while before Luo Xianzi stopped.

“You live up to your name, Sword Emperor. Not only can you control the four fierce golden swords, you are also powerful in close body combat. I am impressed. Let’s call it a draw for today’s match,” Luo Xianzi said.

“Draw?” Jian Wushuang was surprised but he nodded.

He had to admit that Luo Xianzi was really powerful. At least she as much stronger compared to Palace Master Wu Luo.

Her swordsmanship was amazing.

He had gone all out to use the four golden swords and he had given full play to his close body combat skill. But, in the end, he hadn’t had the upper hand at all.

Plus, he knew that although Luo Xianzi had given her all, she didn’t exactly go all out. There were many tricks that she had never performed.

Such as in the fight where Luo Xianzi had gained fame, she had injured a Peak Emperor God with one stroke. That was Luo Xianzi’s strongest stroke but she didn’t show it.

Of course, Luo Xianzi held herself back. Same went for Jian Wushuang.

After all, they didn’t share any resentment and it was merely a bet. A bet that didn’t affect Luo Xianzi much so it wasn’t worth it for her to risk her all.

“Emperor Sword Sect Master.”

Luo Xianzi looked at Emperor Sword Sect Master, his gaze grew cold, “I already tried my best but in the end… you saw what happened. As for what happens next, you can decide on your own.”

Hearing what Luo Xianzi had said, Emperor Sword Sect Master and the other Almighties looked bitter.

At first, they had thought that with Luo Xianzi getting involved, they would be able to resolve the issue. They had never thought that Luo Xianzi couldn’t take Jian Wushuang down.

Then, they continued to face the two options before.

Either they yielded or they would endure a drowning disaster.

Although Emperor Sword Sect Master was arrogant, he definitely wouldn’t take Emperor Sword Sect’s life and death as a joke.

Then, Emperor Sword Sect Master took a deep breath and bowed to Jian Wushuang, “Sword Emperor, today, it’s Emperor Sword Sect’s fault. We are willing to apologize to you. As for the one million Doctrine Gems, we will go and prepare them now.”

“At least you’re not that stupid,” Jian Wushuang glanced at Emperor Sword Sect Master.

He could tell that Emperor Sword Sect Master was unwilling but there was more fear than that.

It was obvious that his power had deterred Emperor Sword Sect Master.

Unless he was really on the brink of death, otherwise Emperor Sword Sect Master wouldn’t have the guts to attack him.

As he had achieved such an effect, it was unnecessary for Jian Wushuang to continue to massacre.

“Emperor Sword Sect Master, Emperor Sword Palace would only open after some time. During this time, I will stay at Emperor Sword Sect. I hope Emperor Sword Sect Master can make some arrangements for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sure,” Emperor Sword Sect Master quivered but nodded heavily.

Jian Wushuang had killed one of their Almighties and hurt a few of their men. Emperor Sword Sect had had to apologize and they had to even arrange Jian Wushuang’s shelter and food. Emperor Sword Sect Master was naturally aggrieved but he finally understood a principle.

That was the principle where absolute power was enough to suppress any rule!

Then, Emperor Sword Sect Master became wiser. He didn’t dare make it difficult for Jian Wushuang anymore.

Jian Wushuang only stayed in Emperor Sword Sect as he waited patiently for Emperor Sword Palace to open. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As they waited, the news of what had happened in Emperor Sword Sect quickly spread in Eternal Chaotic World.

One person had suppressed one sect!

Emperor Sword Sect was forced to yield.

Jian Wushuang hadn’t had the lower hand in the fight with Luo Xianzi. At the same time, he had displayed his terrifying close body combat skill.

Most importantly, when Jian Wushuang was fighting at close quarters with Luo Xianzi, his four golden swords weren’t affected at all.

Everyone in Eternal Chaotic World had a new understanding of Jian Wushuang’s fighting power.

Back then, there were many people who had been in doubt of Jian Wushuang’s ranking on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. They had thought Jian Wushuang shouldn’t be ahead of Emperor God Tian Ling. They had thought Jian Wushuang’s four Hong Jun Golden Swords were scary but Emperor God Tian Ling could totally withstand it. The moment the four golden swords couldn’t put him in an advantageous position, Emperor God Tian Ling would be able to defeat Jian Wushuang.

But then…

Jian Wushuang had proven himself to everyone with his battle achievements. He had more than one trick up his sleeve.

Even if Hong Jun Golden Sword couldn’t bring him any advantage, he wouldn’t be defeated by just anyone.

Time flew past and a few years passed.

It had finally come the day Emperor Sword Palace opened.

In Emperor Sword Sect, in a lofty hall.

The experts who had come for opportunities in Sword Principle in Emperor Sword Palace sat on both sides of the hall. At the front of the hall, there were two people seated on the two seats second to the host’s.

The two of them were Jian Wushuang and Luo Xianzi.

The two of them looked cold while the surrounding people stole glances at them occasionally. There was reverence in their glances.

“Luo Xianzi, Sword Emperor and everyone, everything is ready. We can head to Emperor Sword Palace now,” Emperor Sword Sect Master said politely.
