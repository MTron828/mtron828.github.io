Chapter 67: The Secret Pavilion

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

What Jian Wushuang said was the truth.

He had merely spent two hours inside the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth but made great progress in his understanding of the Sword Essence.

“My Sword Essence of Earth and Gale have both made huge progress in the third form of Formless Swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised that those two hours were equivalent to his one month’s worth of hard work, or more.

“Same here. I made great progress, too,” Yang Zaixuan said seriously.

“Haha! This is one of the three treasures of the Dragon Palace. The cost of entering it so high, naturally there’s a high return too. You can enter the place three times. Since you’ve entered once, you must treasure your two remaining chances,” Wang Yuan said, smiling.

“Come with me. I’ll show you the last treasure of the Dragon Palace.”

They followed Wang Yuan to the entrance of a heavily guarded tall attic that exuded a faintly ancient scent.

“This attic is the most important of the Three Treasures of Dragon Palace, the Secret Pavilion.”

“There are countless treasures in the Secret Pavilion, but you can only take them in exchange for points. Go in and have a look,” Tianbao said.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan immediately entered the Secret Pavilion.

Inside the large and spacious Secret Pavilion, the treasures were divided into many categories.

There were Cultivation Methods, Martial Arts Techniques, Elixir Pills, and Exotic Classes…

With a Heavenly Creation Skill that defied the natural order, Jian Wushuang had no need for Cultivation Methods. Neither did he need Elixirs and Exotic Classes for now, so he made a beeline for the Martial Arts Techniques section.

The Martial Arts Techniques section was divided into swordsmanship, knife methods, spear methods, and so on. Jian Wushuang left Yang Zaixuan’s side and headed straight for the swordsmanship section.

The section stored nearly thousands of rare books on swordsmanship. Fortunately for Jian Wushuang, there was a list that he could refer to. Otherwise, he might need to flip through each book to find the one on his swordsmanship.

The list detailed a number of swordsmanship, a basic introduction for each swordsmanship, as well as the points needed for exchange. But just from a quick glance, Jian Wushuang realized the lowest-ranked swordsmanship on this list was already top-notch ones. There was also no shortage of Sword Skills.

Sword Skills were beyond the scope of so-called swordsmanship.

Generally, one needed to use Sword Skills with a display of Sword Essence understanding at the same time.

“Formless Swordsmanship…” The first item he looked for was the Formless Swordsmanship.

He found out from Ye Rufeng that the Formless Swordsmanship was none other than the Anonymous Swordsmanship. The Formless Swordsmanship had nine sword movements and what he had been cultivating was merely the simplest first three of the swordsmanship.

“Found it!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened when he found the Formless Swordsmanship on the list.

“Formless Swordsmanship, the Sword Skill acknowledged by the Tianzong Dynasty as world’s number one. It was suitable for warriors who understood the Sword Essence of Gale. There were nine movements, and each was stronger than the one before it.”

“Exchange for the first three movements with 200 points!”

“Exchange for the middle three movements with 2,000 points!”

“The last three movements are unavailable!”

“So it’s true they only have the middle three movements, not the last three.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He had heard this from Ye Rufeng on their way here. Though there were nine sword strokes of the Formless Swordsmanship, the most powerful latter three were long lost to history. The Dragon Palace might be the Cultivation Sanctuary of the Tianzong Dynasty, but not even they could recover sword movements in a swordsmanship that had been lost.

“I’ll need to spend 2,000 points alone just for the middle three movements.” Jian Wushuang frowned secretly for his current score was precisely that number.

“There’s no hurry. Let’s look at other Sword Skills.”

Jian Wushuang was not anxious to make his decision yet. He started reading the category of swordsmanship for Sword Essence of Earth understanding.

His comprehension of Sword Essence of Earth was, in fact, far higher than Sword Essence of Gale. It was a pity that he did not have any suitable Sword Skill to display it all this while.

Even in the Mansion of Sword Marquis, the First-class Swordsmanship he learned leaned toward the Earth Essence. But that was not even a First-class Swordsmanship, let alone a super First-class Swordsmanship. It was too weak that he could not even show the might of his Sword Essence of Earth to its fullest.

Therefore, his immediate priority was finding a suitable Sword Skill in the Sword Essence of Earth.

There were many Sword Skills on the list that was suitable for his goals. He finally selected three after carefully pondering over each one.

They were Mark of Earth, Immemorial Sword Skill, and Formless Sword Wave.

Mark of Earth required 2,500 points, while Immemorial Sword Skill required 3,000 points. Formless Sword Wave was divided into two sections, with each being 2,500 points.

“Though each of these Sword Tactics has its own advantages, I think the Formless Sword Ripple seems superior. It also suits me better, but the exchange rate is higher.”Jian Wushuang frowned.

The two sections would cost him 5,000 points. At the moment, he only had 2000 points.

“Whatever. Since I don’t have enough points for the other two Sword Skills now, I’ll just not exchange for now. I’ll just wait and find a way to get more points. It wouldn’t be too late by then.”

He then left the Swordsmanship section and began taking a stroll through the Elixir Pills and Exotic Classes section. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

There were all kinds of odd treasures and elixirs here, many of which were hard to find in the outside world. In the Secret Pavilion, one only needed points to get them.

Before long, Jian Wushuang left the Secret Pavilion with Yang Zaixuan. But before he left, Yang Zaixuan spent 4,000 points to exchange for a Martial Arts Technique.

Jian Wushuang could only shrug his shoulders helplessly. There was nothing he could about it. Yang Zaixuan had more points than him after all.

When he came out of the Sword Pavilion, Wang Yuan came up to him. “What do you think about the treasures in the Secret Pavilion?”

“There’re many of them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’ve once visited the storehouse of a great power, but it’s nothing compared to this place,” Yang Zaixuan added.

“Haha! Of course. This is the Secret Pavilion of the Dragon Palace. How can those so-called sects of the Tianzong Dynasty compare to? As the disciples of this place, we can redeem the treasures if we have enough points.” Wang Yuan smiled.

“Boss Wang Yuan, how can we get these points?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“There are many ways! I’ll tell you one by one,” Wang Yuan replied, immediately describing each method.

“First method: go through the Dragon Gate Pass!”

“There are 13 stories in the Dragon Gate. Starting at the third level, you can get 1,000 points for passing through each level. After the ninth floor, you get 2,000 points each.”

“I heard you mention that one of you passed the eighth floor and the other the fourth. Old Two, you earned 5,000 points. Old Three, you earned 1,000 points. But every newcomer also get 1,000 points for free, so you have 6,000 and 2,000 points respectively.”
