Chapter 2676: Dragon Divine Sect

Many of those mediocre forces were randomly formed by a few Heaven Ultimate Gods. However, they did not have foundations or territory, hence Jian Wushuang felt it was pointless to bring those forces under his control. He would like to target the third-rated forces or above at the very least.

However, the third-rated forces in Danyang Continent were not weak either as any of them had one or two Grand Ultimate Gods in charge with a bunch of High-level and Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods under their command. It was not going to be easy for Jian Wushuang to work on them.

He had to comb through the forces’ information he had on hand in search of a suitable target.

A name popped up after some thorough research.

“Dragon Divine Gang?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Dragon Divine Gang...was obviously a gang from its name. There were a few like them in Danyang Continent.

However, the reason Jian Wushuang shortlisted the Dragon Divine Gang was not only because it was relatively weak among the many third-rated forces, but most importantly the only leader in the Dragon Divine Gang who reached the Peak Ultimate God level fought with someone not long ago and was beheaded on the spot by his opponent.

The Dragon Divine Gang was in a frenzy without a leader, hence it was a good time for Jian Wushuang to step in and gain control.

“The Dragon Divine Gang’s foundation isn’t weak and at least has occupied a city in Danyang Continent,” murmured Jian Wushuang—quite satisfied with the Dragon Divine Gang.

They had a foundation and base. Although they were very weak, they seemed to have the complete package with also a substantial amount of Heaven Ultimate Gods in Dragon Divine Gang.

“Let’s go and check it out.”

Jian Wushuang put away the information and headed toward the city occupied by the Dragon Divine Gang.

The city was called Dragon City.

The Dragon Divine Gang’s lair was in the center of Dragon City.

A huge black castle made of blood gems could be seen with its surface covered with various unusual beast patterns. There was also a black dragon sculpture kept in the castle’s middle while circling it with its head slightly raised just above the black castle.

The facade made the black castle look quite majestic.

“This place looks quite imposing.”

Jian Wushuang stood above the void and looked down at the black castle below before taking action and went straight into the castle without bothering the castle guards.

At that instance, nearly thirty figures were gathered in a magnificent hall in the deepest part of the black castle.

Those figures were emanating a tyrannical divine power breath at the level of Heaven Ultimate God.

Most of them were Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods with five High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods among the group of thirty.

That was the entire Dragon Divine Gang Heaven Ultimate Gods level’s strength.

They used to have a leader at the Peak Heaven Ultimate God but unfortunately was beheaded not long ago.

“Everyone.”

A graceful red-clothed woman stood up and glanced at the people around her before slowly saying, “We’re three days away from the one-month deadline given to us by the Purple Beast Alliance. I’m uncertain if all of you have thought about it. Are we going to fight or surrender?”

The expressions of the many Heaven Ultimate Gods present turned a bit ugly when they heard the woman.

“Let’s just surrender.” A purple-haired middle-aged man—one of the five High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods present—stood up.”Our current strength isn’t a match for the Purple Beast Alliance ever since our Sect Master was killed. The Purple Beast Alliance Master alone is enough to slaughter all of us. We won’t end well if we’re still stubborn under such circumstances.”

“Yes, the Purple Beast Alliance Master could have wiped us all out, but choose not to. He instead gave us a month to consider. I think he’s already really good to us. We’re just being ignorant if we don’t surrender.”

“Let’s just surrender. Our current strength will not be able to resist the attack from the Purple Beast Alliance. We’ll all die if the battle continues.”

“I also agree that we should surrender.”

Many people immediately agreed with the purple-haired middle-aged man.

The Dragon Divine Gang was in a dire situation and thought their best option was to surrender.

However...

“Humph!”

A cold grunt sounded without warning came from a bald old man called Long Shan who was and had always been the recently deceased Dragon Divine Gang Master’s most loyal servant.

“A bunch of useless scum.” Long Shan stood up and cursed.

“Long Shan, what did you say?” The purple-haired middle-aged man’s face turned sullen.

Both of them were High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods. The purple-haired middle-aged man might watch out how he behaved around Long Shan when the Sect Master was still alive. However, he no longer showed even the slightest respect for Long Shan at that moment.

“Was I wrong?” Long Shan sounded cold. “Sect Master was not bad to you, was he? Ninety percent of the various annual benefits we got from Dragon City were distributed to every one of us here and he only kept ten percent to himself. He had also tried his best to help all of you here to get whatever you wanted so that you could focus on improving your strength.

“The Sect Master has just been killed by the Purple Beast Alliance Master not long ago but all of you are giving up on avenging him and surrender at the feet of the Purple Beast Alliance. What are you if all of you aren’t some useless scum?”

“Long Shan, you’re not entirely right.” The graceful red-clothed woman frowned and said, “Of course, we want to avenge our sect master but you have realized our current situation. How on earth can we fight against the Purple Beast Alliance Based on our current strength? We’re just committing suicide if we act rashly and carry on with the fight.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s right. Long Shan, We won’t stop if you’re loyal to the Sect Master and want to go crazy with revenge, but don’t bring all of us down together with you,” the purple-haired middle-aged man bellowed in a low voice.

“You...” Long Shan was anxious but he did not know what to say.

A figure suddenly appeared in the hall out of thin air without any signs.

“It’s quite lively here.”

A hearty laugh echoed in the hall as soon as the person appeared.

Many Dragon Divine Gang’s Heaven Ultimate Gods in the hall were shocked and turned to look at Jian Wushuang one after another.

“Who are you? How dare you break into our Dragon Divine Gang’s lair.” The purple-haired middle-aged man stared at Jian Wushuang with seemingly angry electrified eyes.

“A High-level Heaven Ultimate God?” The graceful red-clothed woman squinted slightly before softly said, “Are you from the Purple Beast Alliance?”

“Purple Beast Alliance? No, I’m not.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly before swiftly moving his figure and then sat down on the hall’s main seat.

The seat which was used to be occupied by the Dragon Divine Gang Master.

A domineering voice also suddenly resounded after he sat down.

“My name is Su Han. I’ll be the new leader of the Dragon Divine Gang from today onwards. I wonder if any one of you disagree?”
