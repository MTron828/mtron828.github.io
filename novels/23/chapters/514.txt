“A Sound Wave Attack?”?Jian Wushuang sneered.

It was not the first time he had encountered a Sound Wave Attack. He had already made preparations against this type of technique, not to mention that he was physically stronger than he used to be by far. The Sound Wave Attack of the Demonic Lion Puppet Fighter had little effect on him.

He clenched his right fist and launched a punch. His violent physical power exploded like a volcano waking up after being dormant for a long time.

Bang!

He had an absolute advantage in brute force, so the Demonic Lion Puppet Fighter was forced to retreat. However, its long greenish black tail appeared near Jian Wushuang’s side, catching him off-guard.

The tail swept directly toward his head like a sharp saber.

“What a move!”

A bit of surprise flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He waved his arm casually and parried the tail. Chi! Chi! Chi! The metallic sound of several collisions reverberated through the area again and again.

The Puppet Fighter’s tail was knocked away, only leaving behind some white marks on his arm.

“Well?”

A sigh of surprise came from outside of the Gladiator Arena. In one row of stands at the top of the Gladiator Arena, sat a handsome long-haired man in a green robe. Until just now, he had been completely indifferent while watching the other applicants’ fight with the Demonic Beast Puppet Fighters.

But, just now, when he saw how Jian Wushuang struck the Puppet Fighter’s tail away, he was a little surprised.

“What a strong body!”

“He has only cultivated up to the Sixth Level of the Bone Fusion Technique, but his body is stronger than those who have cultivated the Seventh or even the Eighth Level!”

The long-hair man nodded and glanced at the red-robed woman standing next to him and asked, “Who is he?”

“Your Highness, he’s Jian Wushuang from the Wu Yan Tribe,” the red-robed woman replied respectfully.

After all, this man was Emperor Fengxiao, who possessed great power within the Monster-exterminating League and stood at the peak among the humans on the Monster Continent.

Emperor Fengxiao ranked second among the 108 Divine Emperors. Among the human population, He was estimated to only be weaker than the 33?superior Temple Masters from the Monster-exterminating League.

“Jian Wushuang?” Emperor Fengxiao nodded slightly, remembering the name.

“Jian Wushuang can defeat the Demonic Lion Puppet Fighter easily by virtue of his strong body. It’s quite likely that he’ll also pass the third round,” Emperor Fengxiao said.

“If he can pass the third round, he’ll be a Second-grade Divine General. So far, only Jin Ling has passed the third round among these applicants,” the red-robed woman said carefully.

“Jin Ling? He’s different,” Emperor Fengxiao shook his head. “I know Jin Ling. He always stays with his father, and his father has helped him a lot with his cultivation and even improved his physical strength using lots of treasures. It’s normal for him to pass the third round.”

“Jian Wushuang comes from an ordinary tribe. Since he can make it this far without any background, he is much stronger than Jin Ling. After he becomes a Divine General and cultivates for a period of time in the Holy Place, he’ll make greater progress. Maybe our side will have another Divine Emperor several years from now.”

“Divine Emperor?” The woman glanced at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

She had not expected that Emperor Fengxiao would give Jian Wushuang such a high evaluation.

“Just look,” Emperor Fengxiao stopped talking and continued to watch.

As Emperor Fengxiao expected, Jian Wushuang did not exert himself to defeat the Demonic Lion Puppet Fighter in the second round. He easily defeated it without drawing his sword.

The Puppet Fighter of the third round appeared immediately.

It was comparable to an Eight-cloud Realm expert and even stronger than Marquis Zizhong who Jian Wushuang had fought in the Divine Land.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang was also stronger than he used to be after cultivating the Bone Fusion Technique and improving his physical strength to a great extent.

In front of this Puppet Fighter, Jian Wushuang finally drew his sword and used his Spiritual Power to defeat it.

The Demonic Beast Puppet Fighter of the fourth round showed up.

It looked exactly the same as the Demonic Apes in the first round. It even had four arms, but it was much stronger.

“Few Second-grade Divine Generals can compete with the Demonic Ape Puppet Fighter in the fourth round. I wonder how long he can hold out,” Emperor Fengxiao watched the fight attentively.

Jian Wushuang began to attack the Demonic Ape Puppet Fighter.

Woosh!

The Triple-kill Sword carried a decisive and unwavering intent as he attacked with the second move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique.

A sword shadow burst out, like sharp bolt of lightning, roaring as it stabbed forward.

The Puppet Fighter waved its four arms violently and clenched a fist, releasing a punch towards Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword.

BANG!

The Triple-kill Sword was deflected to the side as the Puppet Fighter directly strode forward and violently punched at Jian Wushuang with its other three arms.

Jian Wushuang retreated in a hurry and swung his sword to parry the incoming attacks. However, he?still suffered a blow on his chest from the Puppet Fighter’s fist.

Jian Wushuang groaned painfully and tried to calm down his turbulent aura.

“How powerful! It’s even stronger than me.” A hint of excitement flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. “It seems that I will have to use some of my trump cards.”

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The Puppet Fighter trod forward heavily and then pounced on him.

He immediately retreated while simultaneously waving his hand.

Hum... A giant tumbling Blood River rushed out, accompanied by surging waves of invisible Sword Essence that spread out around Jian Wushuang.

He had superimposed Road to the Underworld and the Hundredfold Realm. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

As for the Blood Fire Domain in the Blood Fire Ring, it was too weak to be of use to Jian Wushuang now.

Due to the oppression of the Domain, the Puppet Fighter’s speed and strength were greatly restrained.

Jian Wushuang stopped retreating and raised his Triple-kill Sword, which gave off a dazzling light at this moment.
