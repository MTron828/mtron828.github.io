Chapter 1902: Three Alliances

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Supreme Ten Alliance gathered ten major forces and a few solo experts. Their power was extremely fierce as well.

In terms of the number of Almighties alone, Supreme Ten Alliance wasn’t weaker than Star Extermination Alliance. However, in terms of Sir God level, they were slightly weaker than Star Extermination Alliance.

After all, between the ten forces in Supreme Ten Alliance, no matter if it was Soaring Heaven King Palace or Divine King Island or Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, there were some differences.

The major ten forces teamed up and in addition to a few solo experts, there were only eight Emperor Gods. Amongst them, there were only two Peak Emperor Gods. One of them was the Master of Emperor Sword Sect that Jian Wushuang had once got in contact with.

Although in terms of fighting power of Emperor God level, Supreme Ten Alliance was weaker than Star Extermination Alliance. Their overall power was very impressive.

Besides, there were not only forces and experts who held grudges against Lineage os Star, but there were also people who had nothing to do with Lineage of Star but were only aiming for the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

The number of these people were even greater.

Plus, these people had also formed an alliance called Almighties Alliance in order to match evenly with Supreme Ten Alliance and Star Extermination Alliance.

Almighties Alliance, there were more than a hundred Almighties and there were quite a number of Emperor Gods as well. In terms of their overall power, they were much stronger than Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance.

In Lineage of Star, in a lofty palace.

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun gathered together as they analyzed their current situation.

“Two hundred and fifty years have passed and the entire situation has become clear,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Previously, there was only Star Extermination Alliance while the others hid in the dark. Lineage of Star didn’t know how many forces and experts they were dealing with.

Hence, Lineage of Star had been showing the white feather even though they had fighting power that made it needless to be fearful of Star Extermination Alliance. They didn’t dare to take action hastily because they had scruples.

But then, it was all crystal clear.

At least, all these people had come to light.

“Outside the Milky Way, the three alliances stood side by side. Among the three alliances, Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance holds deep-seated resentment against Lineage of Star. They are determined to destroy Lineage of Star and root us up. As for Almighties Alliance, although they are the strongest, they hold no standing,” Hall Master said in a deep voice.

“Almighties Alliance and Lineage of Star share no grudges. They are only aiming at Secret Skill of Star Palace. We might be able to talk terms with them,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

“I think so too,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

Just then…

“Mm?” Hall Master Yuan was surprised.

“Why?” Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun looked to the side.

“There is someone outside the Milky Way to request to meet. It is the head of one of the three alliances, Emperor God Xiu Luo from Almighties Alliance!” Hall Master said in confusion.

“Emperor God Xiu Luo?”

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun were astonished. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

They just thought that they could try to talk terms with Almighties Alliance and then one of the heads of Almighties Alliance, Emperor God Xiu Luo came to visit.

“You stay here. Let me welcome Emperor God Xiu Luo in,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Hall Master Yuan, do we need to inform Palace Master? Emperor God Xiu Luo is a Peak Emperor God. If he were to have wicked intentions, once he enters the Milky Way and collaborates with the experts outside, they might pose a threat to the grand formation of Milky Way,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

“Don’t worry, Emperor God Xiu Luo only came as a consciousness embodiment. He can’t do much,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun felt at ease when they heard that.

Under the guidance of Hall Master Yuan personally, Emperor God Xiu Luo’s consciousness embodiment came into the Milky Way and entered the lofty palace.

In the palace, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun sat side by side.

“How come there are only three of you? Where’s Sword Emperor?” The balding Emperor God Xiu Luo in black robes looked at the three people in front of him.

“Our Palace Master is cultivating in seclusion. Excuse him for not being able to greet you personally. Emperor God Xiu Luo, what’s the matter? You can talk to us directly. We can make a decision on most matters. Even if we can’t, we can send a message to ask Palace Master,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Cultivation in seclusion?” Emperor God Xiu Luo raised his eyebrows, “Sword Emperor is so patient. Lineage of Star is cornered in a desperate situation and he has the mood to cultivate in seclusion?”

“Emperor God Xiu Luo, let’s be frank here. What’s the matter?” Hall Master Yuan replied.

“Actually, the purpose of my visit, you should be able to guess,” Emperor God Xiu Luo looked around, “Outside the Milky Way, although three alliances stand side by side, we Almighties Alliance do not hold any grudges against Lineage of Star. Our purpose is only to obtain Secret Skill of Star Palace. As long as we obtain Secret Skill of Star Palace, regardless of Lineage of Star’s rise and fall or life and death, it has nothing to do with Almighties Alliance.”

“In other words, as long as we get Secret Skill of Star Palace, Almighties Alliance can side whichever campsite.”

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Nie Yun by the side, they exchanged a look and smiled in their hearts.

They could tell from Emperor God Xiu Luo’s suggestion that he meant Almighties Alliance could totally stand by Lineage of Star as long as they got the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

“I understand what Emperor God Xiu Luo meant. Lineage of Star could let the experts from Almighties Alliance cultivate Secret Skill of Star Palace. The prerequisite is that they have to first serve Lineage of Star for ten thousand years. Of course, during the ten thousand years, we Lineage of Star would reward according to merit. The three volumes of Secret Skill of Star Palace would be given to them one by one according to their contribution,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Serve Lineage of Star? This is impossible!” Emperor God Xiu Luo shook his head, “Although you’d only be doing so as guest elders and there isn’t any restriction, it’s still a no.”

“How about getting everyone from Almighties Alliance to team up with Lineage of Star to defeat Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance, then we let everyone receive the inheritance?” Hall Master Yuan suggested again.

Emperor God Xiu Luo grew distressed.

To defeat Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance head-on?

Forget about the power of Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance, which were powerful, the danger that Lineage of Star was facing was faintly supported by the Great Emperor in the back.

To have Almighties Alliance take sides and stand by Lineage of Star, it wasn’t a problem, it was merely a standing.

However, if they wanted Almighties Alliance to go all-out and fight Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance head-on, the experts in Almighties Alliance might not be willing to.

“Why? You’re not willing to be Lineage of Star’s guest elders. Then, you’re not willing to fight against the two alliances alongside Lineage of Star. You’re merely declaring your standing yet you want to receive the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace. Emperor God Xiu Luo, aren’t you letting your imagination run wild?” Hall Master Yuan’s gaze became sharp.
