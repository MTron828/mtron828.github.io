Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Now we have arrived at the Thunder Fire Sect.”

“Thunder Fire Sect?” Jian Wushuang didn’t know even what it was.

“The elderly God from the Thunder Fire Sect is our friend. He sent a message to us that the Thunder Fire Sect is in danger. Now we are going to help him.” Lei Chao said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang said.

Thunder Fire Sect was only a small sect. It was not easy for such a sect to develop a friendship with the Lineage of Star.

“Let’s go.”

They went to the gate of thunder Fire Sect.

“Who is that?”

The Universe Gods in the Thunder Fire Sect felt alarmed by these two visitors. Immediately, more than ten Universe Gods surrounded Jian Wushuang and Lei Chao.

More specifically, they surrounded Lei Chao.

Lei Chao stood there calmly and silently.

After a while, an elderly in a purple robe came.

“I am the master of the Thunder Fire Sect. May I ask what you are coming for?” The elderly stared at Lei Chao, knowing that his visitor was powerful.

“We came at the invitation of the Green Fox. It’s his letter.” Lei Chao took out a letter.

The Green Fox was the elderly God of the Thunder Fire Sect.

“Talents who will help us?”

Those Universe Gods were excited and happy after hearing that.

After the sect master read the letter, he was relieved.

“Come in, please.” The sect master welcomed them.

So Jian Wushuang and Lei Chao entered the Thunder Fire Sect.

As they were walking, the sect master asked Lei Chao, “Do you know where Green Fox is now? He just told me via letter that he couldn’t come back without making his location known.”

“Now his situation is dangerous and there may sometimes be a risk of death. He can’t come back to save the sect. And he asked me to help.” Lei Chao said.

“Green Fox is now in danger?” The sect master frowned.

Thunder Fire Sect was only a small tribe in which there were only two Real Gods: the sect master and Green Fox.

The death of any Real God would be a disaster.

Green Fox, in particular, was the backbone of the sect.

Lei Chao didn’t beat about the bush. He asked, “What crisis is the Thunder Fire Sect facing?”

The sect master answered directly, “We have always been fighting against the White Flame Palace. Our conflicts and hatred are only growing in magnitude.”

“In the past we were neck and neck with each other. We each had two Real Gods, and Green Fox was very powerful so the White Flame Palace didn’t dare make trouble. However, recently they added a new Real God and also invited an Independent Real God to protect them.”

“So they now have four Real Gods, making them much more powerful than us. In the past one hundred years, they have been attacking us and grabbing our property. We are surviving thanks to our Sect Secret Skills, but actually the sect is on shaky ground.”

“I intended to call Green Fox back to save our sect, but I now know that he is in danger.”

The sect master seemed helpless.

Lei Chao said, “That’s to say, if we can kill two Real Gods in the White Flame Palace, they can’t pose a threat to you, right?”

“Yes.” The sect master nodded, “If we manage to do this, we will not only contain the White Flame Palace, but also recover our lost property!”

Lei Chao said, “OK, that’s easy. As you have fought with the White Flame Palace for a long time, you must know how many Universe Gods they have, right?”

“Of course.” The sect master nodded, but he didn’t know why Lei Caho had asked that.

The real crisis came from four Real Gods. Why did Lei Chao mention Universe Gods?

Jian Wushuang couldn’t understand either.

“Give me a ranking list of all the Universe Gods from the White Flame Palace.” Lei Chao said.

“No problem.” The sect master asked his subordinates to finish the task.

After a while, Lei Chao got the list.

After looking through the list, Lei Chao said, “Let’s go to the White Flame Palace.”

The master of the Thunder Fire Sect didn’t understand and he asked, “At this very moment, talents from the White Flame Palace are watching us outside our sect. If we go out, they will raid us immediately. How can we take that risk?”

Lei Chao glanced at the sect master and said indifferently, “How can you solve the crisis by staying in the sect?”

“But…”

“Stop talking and lead me there.” Lei Chao didn’t want to explain further.

The sect master chose to trust Lei Chao’s decision.

He trusted Lei Chao because he felt that Lei Chao was powerful enough to protect the sect.

Without enough confidence, Lei Chao would risk death and go to the White Flame Palace.

Lei Chao was confident enough.
