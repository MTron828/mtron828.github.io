Chapter 2966: Earth-Level Members

——

Heaven-cleaving Alliance, nest no. 385.

Wearing a mysterious gray mask, Jian Wushuang came to the old man again.

“Hand in the task.” Jian Wushuang took out his identity token and the mirror token that had recorded three tasks.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you’ve completed all three tasks? And all of them alone?” Elder Qiu looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

“The process of the task is in the mirror token.” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“I’m not qualified to look at the mirror token. How about this, you wait here for a while. I’ll pass the mirror token to the high-level experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to make a judgment,” Elder Qiu said.

“How long will it take?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not long, three days at most,” Elder Qiu said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He was not in a hurry for three days.

Jian Wushuang immediately waited in the nest. Three days passed quickly, and the results came out.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, this is your new identity token. From today on, you are an earth-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and you have the authority of an earth-level member.” Elder Qiu handed an identity token to Jian Wushuang, his expression was somewhat humble.

What a joke. A Divine Master could become an earth-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Even a fool would know how great this Divine Master was.

How could a mere person in charge of a secret lair compare to such a task?

After receiving the identity token, Jian Wushuang was quite delighted. He immediately headed straight for the Treasure Pavilion.

Watching Jian Wushuang leave, Elder Qiu could not help but sigh.

“A Divine Master can complete three ordinary three-star missions alone and become an earth-level member. Heavenly Sword Marquis is definitely one of the top super-geniuses in the Divine Beginning World. He is definitely qualified to enter the three palaces and become the core genius disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. But the strange thing is, even though he is so talented, why is there no instruction from above?” Elder Qiu thought it was a little strange.

The mirror token that Jian Wushuang used to complete the mission was judged by the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

If Jian Wushuang could complete three three-star missions alone, even the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would be eager to recruit such a super genius.

However, the result he got was only that Jian Wushuang could become an earth-level member without any instructions. It was as if the Heaven-cleaving Alliance did not care about such a super genius at all.

“Maybe there are other factors.” Elder Qiu sighed and did not think much about it.

…

The golden light figure in Treasure Pavilion, which was Lord Tianshuo, gathered in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Tianshuo.” Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, congratulations on becoming an earth-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. You can also enjoy the authority of an earth-level member here,” Lord Tianshuo said.

“Lord Tianshuo, I want the four forms of the Samsara Sword Formation that I mentioned to you before,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Yes, the four forms of the sword formation require 15 million saint pills with the privilege of being an earth-level member,” Lord Tianshuo said.

Jian Wushuang was prepared and immediately took out an interspatial ring.

Lord Tianshuo took the interspatial ring, scanned it with his consciousness, and nodded slightly. “Wait here. Someone will deliver the four forms of the sword formation to you in 10 days.”

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang thanked him, but his expression suddenly changed.

He remembered the origin of Lord Tianshou.

Lord Tianshou was the only weapon spirit in the Treasure Pavilion of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. He was knowledgeable and could identify any treasure as quickly as possible. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had obtained a special treasure a long time ago, but he had never appraised it…

“Sir Tianshuo, I have a treasure here. I hope you can appraise it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Take it out.” Sir Tianshuo appeared very calm.

Jian Wushuang flipped his palm, and a baby-sized black exotic beast statue covered in the power of destruction rules appeared in his hand.

Jian Wushuang had obtained this black exotic beast statue in the secret realm of the Pill Sun Sacred World.

He had obtained three precious treasures, including the cloud-pattern armor. He had used the token that contained teleportation to save his life in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Only the black beast statue remained.

Jian Wushuang had always thought that the black beast statue was extraordinary, but he did not know what it was.

Now, Jian Wushuang brought the black beast statue to Lord Tianshou.

Lord Tianshou glanced at the black beast statue with a strange look in his eyes.

“You can get such a treasure?” Lord Tianshou’s voice was obviously a little surprised.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang understood that this treasure was indeed extraordinary. Otherwise, Lord Tianshou would not have said so.

“Lord Tianshou, this treasure…” Jian Wushuang had just opened his mouth.

“This treasure has some history. Under normal circumstances, a little guy like you would not have had the chance to come into contact with such a treasure. It’s also a fortuitous opportunity for you to get it.” Lord Tianshou praised, “I can help you appraise this statue, but the cost of appraising it is relatively high.”

“How much?” Jian Qushuang asked.

“Five million sacred elixirs!” Lord Tianshou stretched out five fingers.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Five million sacred elixirs just to appraise this treasure?

When appraising the Earth Divine Fruit, Lord Tianshou only said that he would take 500,000 sacred elixirs.

The difference between 500,000 and five million was ten times.

Could it be that the real value of the statue was 10 times higher than that of the Earth Divine Fruit?

“How about it? Do you want me to appraise it for you?” Lord Tianshou looked at him.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

5,000,000 sacred elixirs was not a big number for him. He wanted to know what the black beast statue was.

“Sir Tianshuo, this is five million sacred elixirs.” Jian Wushuang took out an interspatial ring again.

This time, he completed three three-star missions in one go and received a lot of rewards. In addition to the remaining sacred elixirs, he still had a lot of them, so he could easily take out five million sacred elixirs.

After taking the interspatial ring, Sir Tianshuo said directly, “This black beast statue originated from a top special life form in the Beginning Divine World, the Destruction Beast God!”

“Destruction Beast God?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“It has been many years since the divine beginning world was born. During this long time, countless creatures have been born…”
