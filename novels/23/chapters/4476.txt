The moon was bright and the stars were few.

After thinking for a while, Jian Wushuang spread his divine power again. After making sure that no one was nearby, he pulled the token from his waist with his right hand.

Not only could this token conceal his divine power aura, but it could also communicate with Cosmos Gods across the cosmos and report the situation.

Ding ding ding!

Ripples that looked like water mirrors suddenly appeared on the token. Then, a gentle but slightly worried voice sounded.

“Jian Wushuang, how are you?”

Following that, the lens swiped upwards, and the face of Cosmos God appeared in the water mirror.

His appearance did not change much, but there was a hint of fatigue in his eyes.

It was obvious that Cosmos Gods must have been exhausted during this period of time.

“Reporting to Cosmos God, I have officially entered the God Refining Sect.”

Jian Wushuang took a few steps back and cupped his hands at Cosmos God.

“Oh? You’ve entered the God Refining Sect?”

Upon hearing this, a look of surprise flashed across the face of Cosmos God. He said, “Supreme Gongyang had reported to me earlier that you guys had gone to participate in the God Refining Sect’s selection, but we were exposed. He couldn’t care less about you guys, so he had to escape first. I thought you had already escaped.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile bitterly. He shook his head and said, “It’s a long story.”

Then, Jian Wushuang changed the topic and said, “Lord Cosmos God, from the looks of it, Supreme Gongyang is fine?”

Cosmos God in the token water mirror nodded and replied, “That’s right. I’ve already contacted Supreme Gongyang and Supreme Bing Ye. Both of them are fine and have escaped from the God Refining Sect’s pursuit.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Supreme Bing Ye? Escape from the pursuit?” Hearing this, Jian Wushuang sneered in his heart. This guy did not even come to participate in the selection of the God Refining Sect. How could he escape from the pursuit?

Shaking his head, Jian Wushuang had no intention of explaining this to Cosmos Gods. Instead, he asked in a deep voice, “Lord Cosmos God, what about Supreme Lingyu?”

“Supreme Lingyu…” Cosmos God fell silent for a moment before saying, “I’ve tried to contact her many times, but there was no response. I’m afraid she has been secretly executed by the God Refining Sect.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang sighed slightly in his heart. He had a good impression of Supreme Lingyu, but he did not expect that she would not be able to escape from the God Refining Sect.

Jian Wushuang guessed that it would not be long before he saw the divine corpse of Supreme Lingyu on Coffin Mountain.

However, he had already taken Supreme Tarot with him. If he were to take Supreme Lingyu with him, it would be hard to avoid suspicion.

After sighing for a while, Jian Wushuang told Cosmos God about his recent situation.

When Cosmos God heard that Jian Wushuang had seen Supreme Tarot at Coffin Mountain, a look of shock and anger flashed across his usually calm face.

“Bastard! I was suspicious that even if Tarot was no match for the Devouring Emperor, he shouldn’t have been killed so quickly without leaving any traces. I didn’t expect him to be sold to the God Refining Sect as a Divine Corpse!”

When Cosmos God heard that Jian Wushuang had refined Supreme Tarot’s Divine Corpse and brought it away from Coffin Mountain, his expression softened. He looked at Jian Wushuang with satisfaction and gratification.

After that, the two of them chatted for a while. Cosmos God told Jian Wushuang to be careful in the God Refining Sect. He had to protect himself as this was the most important thing. He also told Jian Wushuang to find out the battle deployment of the Void Universe against their universe without taking any risks. He also told Jian Wushuang to find out which position the Void Universe plans to attack next, who they will be sending, and where they were.

Also, which crack in the void forbidden land did they pass through to enter the native universe?

After that, Jian Wushuang ended the conversation with Cosmos God.

…

Roar!

In the limestone mountain, the roars of the divine corpses became more and more frequent as the night deepened. Then, they gradually stopped at the break of dawn.

The next morning.

Knock knock knock.

Outside the Corpse Cave where Jian Wushuang was, there was a strong knock on the door.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and waved his right hand to remove the restrictions. He said indifferently, “Please come in.”

Not long after he finished speaking, he saw the sickle-headed Scar-level Void Warrior walk in from outside the Corpse Cave.

“Wushuang, why are you so cautious? We are in the God Refining Sect, why do we need to set up so many restrictions?”

A voice that seemed to be laughing yet not laughing sounded.

The sickle-headed Void Warrior squinted his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang with an inexplicable expression.

“Elder Shen Lian.” Jian Wushuang looked calm and bowed slightly to him.

This person was the one who had tried to kill him outside the gate of the God Refining Sect.

“Elder Shen Lian, what’s the matter for your sudden visit?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

He could sense a faint enmity from this Elder Shen Lian.

“Wushuang, can’t I come to visit for no reason?” Elder Shen Lian sized up Jian Wushuang and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. “I came to find you this time, firstly to see how you are doing, and secondly, to tell you a piece of news.”

“What news?” Jian Wushuang asked indifferently.

A glint flashed in the eyes of the Elder Shen Lian as he said slowly, “Wushuang, do you still remember the few people who were with you? One of them has already been captured and executed.”

As he said that, Elder Shen Lian stared at Jian Wushuang as he wanted to see if there was anything unusual on Jian Wushuang’s face.

However, he was disappointed.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm the entire time. He asked without any fluctuation in his expression, “Oh, what does that have to do with me?”

Elder Shen Lian did not say anything. Instead, he looked at Jian Wushuang deeply. After a long while, he said with a faint smile, “Nothing much, I’m just here to inform you.”

“Unfortunately, that person didn’t reveal any other information before she died. In the end, she simply self-destructed.” Elder Shen Lian shook his head as he spoke, as if he was sighing.

Jian Wushuang did not reply. Instead, he just looked at Elder Shen Lian.

...

“Alright, Wushuang. Since you’re fine, I will take my leave.”

“Oh right, I almost forgot. I forgot to congratulate you for refining the number one divine corpse of our God Refining Sect. Tsk, tsk, even the five Grand Elders and the Sect Master can’t do anything about the strong obsession in the divine corpse, but you’ve refined it so smoothly. It’s really strange.”

Shaking his head, Elder Shen Lian left the Corpse Cave with his hands behind his back.

A long time after Elder Shen Lian left…

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s right hand suddenly hit the bed, and his originally calm and indifferent face instantly became extremely gloomy.

How could he not have guessed that this Elder Shen Lian had pretended to come and check on him just now, but in reality, he was trying to catch him off guard and was here to test him.

This person did not trust Jian Wushuang at all. He did not believe in the results of the Trial Foundation Stone.

“This person must die, or I’ll be in too much danger!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and looked at Elder Shen Lian’s back as he left. A cold killing intent flashed in his eyes.
