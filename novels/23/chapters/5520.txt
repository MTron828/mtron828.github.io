Chapter 5519 ¬†Set a Plan

Wu Zuo was shocked when he saw him in such a state!

"You, what's happening?" Wu Zuo said, "Could it be that the other party contacted you proactively?"

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and then replied, "It's not that they contacted me proactively, but I discovered a shocking secret!"

His pupils contracted, and Wu Zuo, seeing this, became tense as well. He set up three formations before daring Jian Wushuang to continue.

Whatever could make Jian Wushuang so nervous obviously couldn't be a trivial matter.

Jian Wushuang revealed everything that happened in Beiwang Tower in one breath.

Listening to it, Wu Zuo was astonished, standing up immediately in the hall.

Then he paced around in the hall.

"For this matter, are you sure you haven't told anyone?" Wu Zuo asked with uncertainty.

Jian Wushuang wiped the sweat from his forehead and, somewhat exhausted, said, "I haven't even told Divine General Moyin, let alone others!"

"That's good. It's easy then. If you've only approached Divine General Moyin, even if there are spies in the Elder Palace, they shouldn't be able to guess. What we're worried about now is whether the other party already knows that you've discovered the secret there!"

Indeed, Shen Ling had discovered it.

Over the past thousands of years, not only was Shen Ling frightened, but even the giant egg in the Origin Source, which dared to quietly absorb the power of All Things for its own needs, was now terrified. Previously, it could absorb the power of the Origin Source discreetly, but now that it had been discovered, it didn't dare to venture out of the secret realm.

Jian Wushuang was afraid, but the other party was even more terrified.

On this point, Wu Zuo, as a bystander, observed even more.

He soon discovered that something was amiss.

"You've spotted them, and they've undoubtedly spotted you. If Shen Ling truly possesses such great abilities, they might strike before you get a chance to report this to Lord Zhen Ling!"

Wu Zuo continued, "Being silent for such a long time, they are probably taking a gamble! This matter must not be disclosed to anyone. As for the giant egg, leave it for now. I'll inform Lord Zhen Ling later. This time, you've earned credit in advance."

This merit, not only for Lord Zhen Ling's faction, but when the plan unfolds, even Shen Ling will acknowledge his moves.

Those who have been to the Three Kings Court are familiar with the giant egg. Shen Ling surely knew this. Jian Wushuang kept everything to himself; when the time comes, it will be revealed.

If this matter leaks, the plan will likely face difficulties.

At most, they'll capture one giant egg, and the biggest threat, Fuego, will remain elusive.

The fact that the giant egg has been here for so long without hatching definitely has reasons. Even if it hatches, it's a captured bird in a jar, nothing to worry about.

Jian Wushuang nodded. Initially frightened, he hadn't considered so much. Now, it seems this might not be a bad start after all.

"Alright, let's set aside that matter for now. We need to create some illusions, like the Origin Source of All Things!" Wu Zuo revealed a sly smile.

When Jian Wushuang and Wu Zuo arrived here, many people had seen them. It was necessary to release some information. ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

The people in the Elder Palace portrayed an image of ostracizing Jian Wushuang.

Unwilling to grant the Origin Source of All Things to Jian Wushuang, his Dao Companion was then taken away by the Hall Master of the Longevity Hall.

In this way, Jian Wushuang could also be considered to have made a name for himself.

"That's how we'll handle it!"

Jian Wushuang stood up, exhaling a long breath.

Now, there was only one way left. He had never expected that the plan proposed last time would lead to him being hastily sentenced by the Elder Palace.

"Wu Zuo, for the sake of caution, release more information recently!" Jian Wushuang reminded as he spoke.

"No problem!" Wu Zuo replied.

"By the way, I heard that Qingniu and Chang Feng, one shut himself off completely, and the other went to the mining mountain. Without these two stumbling blocks, your escape this time should be smoother!" Wu Zuo chuckled.

The affairs of these two individuals were related to Jian Wushuang. They were avoiding him, leading to this last resort.

Now, everything was proceeding according to plan.

Jian Wushuang and Wu Zuo discussed many details, even setting the route for his escape.

Prepared and resolute, he journeyed northward.

The teleportation array to the borderlands was in the temple, an area strictly off-limits.

After the cleansing of the northern forces by the Elder Palace, they were at their weakest, presenting an opportune moment for him to escape towards the north.

He first used the teleportation array to reach the city of Sharuo, then proceeded northward relying on flight.

If all went smoothly, he might even make a detour to the mines to search for Nie Yuan.

After a rough plan was set, he couldn't linger here any longer.

Now, he needed to stage a departure performance; otherwise, it might raise suspicions from outsiders.

Before leaving, Wu Zuo stopped him.

"Jian Wushuang, take this!" he said, handing over an embroidered box.

Jian Wushuang was puzzled, but when he opened the box, he was stunned.

"What's this?" Jian Wushuang wondered. "This is the Abyss Flower!"

Wu Zuo nodded and said, "Consider this a gift from me. You've done me a great favor this time, and your performance in Beiwang Tower exceeded Zhen Ling's expectations. Zhen Ling has great praise for you."

This gift was obtained by Wu Zuo through the collection of countless treasures in the Forest of Eternal Secrets, later exchanged with Zhu Yi.

Don't underestimate this Abyss Flower; its value was almost on par with half of a Universal Treasure.

Jian Wushuang was equally shocked.

Back on the Original Planet Alpha Nine, he had seen this Abyss Flower, but back then, merely exchanging for its pollen was already extremely expensive.

The crucial point was that back then, they were trial participants, and even with plenty of godstones, they didn't have a chance to lay eyes on the Abyss Flower, let alone exchange for it, in the Four Great Secret Realms.

The Abyss Flower!

Jian Wushuang's eyes sparkled with excitement. Even if he had to give up the Origin Source of All Things this time, it didn't seem like too much of a loss.

Within the Origin Source of All Things, terrifying life was stored, something that even he found fearsome.

But that was a concern for later. After dealing with Shen Ling and Fuego, he could reconsider.

By that time, he estimated that he would have successfully integrated the Daos and ascended to become the Emperor.

Once an Emperor, his demand for the Origin Source of All Things might not be as urgent as it was now.

Leaving the main hall of the Enforcement Hall, Jian Wushuang soared into the air, heading directly to the island where the Longevity Hall was located.

There were indeed things he needed to take care of, especially matters involving people.

In the past, it didn't matter much. He had little fame, and it was challenging to challenge a veteran Hall Master.

But things had changed.

With his newfound fame, the three Palace Masters avoided him, and no one dared to offend him at this moment.

If someone dared to provoke him too much, he could demand the Origin Source of All Things, and let's see who would suffer more.

Although he didn't have much feeling for Gong Miaoyi, she was someone he brought along. It was unacceptable for her to be silently taken away.

This clearly violated the rules.

Under the banner of righteousness, he intended to display his might.

Longevity Hall.

Located in the northwest corner of Yuanyang Island.

Unlike other islands, this place resembled more of a continent.
