4934 The Old Shepherd

Faced with the attack of an early-stage Grand Evolution Immortal, Jian Wushuang snorted coldly and 30,000 Sword Intents surged out of his palm.

In the next moment, he directly faced the Grand Yan Immortal!

Boom!

A sudden explosion sounded in the air. The two Ancestral Skills were completely transformed into one punch, and the explosion produced was extremely powerful.

Then, there was a scream.

The old man, who was like a ferocious wolf, was sent flying by Jian Wushuang’s punch.

Jian Wushuang did not expect this. He was confused as he looked at the elder who flew thousands of feet away and then crashed heavily on the ground.

This old man who was clearly at the Grand Yan Immortal stage was a little too weak.

Jian Wushuang felt that if he had used more strength, he could have directly smashed the old man.

Puzzled, he flew over to the old man who was lying on the ground.

The old man panted heavily and his face was covered in divine blood. When he saw Jian Wushuang walking over, he hurriedly got up and retreated. There was only fear in his eyes.

“You, who exactly are you, how can a mere Yan Immortal have such strength?” he covered his face and said in a trembling voice.

“I’m the man who will kill you!” Jian Wushuang said coldly and raised his palm.

Jian Wushuang had never shown any mercy to his enemies.

When the old man heard this, his face turned ashen. Then, he directly knelt down with a thud. “I beg you to raise your hand and let me go. I’ve lived in this Endless Sea for countless years. I only want to be able to leave alive one day.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“As long as Sir can spare my life, I’m willing to do anything.”

Jian Wushuang withdrew his palm and stopped killing.

“Tell me, where is this place? Have any unfamiliar faces come here these days?”

The old man looked as if he had been pardoned. “Sir, this place is called Ranch of the Exiled. I don’t know when it was created, but the one who created this place is still alive and is in charge of maintaining order here.”

“This place is called the Ranch of the Exiled because there are a large number of exiles gathered here. If we want to survive, we can only fight endlessly.”

“The dead Grand Yan Immortals were used to fill the ground beneath their feet to stabilize this place.”

As he said this, the old man pointed at the chain around his neck, “Only by killing a certain number of Grand Yan Immortals can the chain be unlocked and you can survive here.”

“How many have you killed?” Jian Wushuang looked at him and said.

“I’m ashamed. Not a single one,” the old man said with shame, “I just want to continue living.”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang asked again, “Have you seen any unfamiliar faces in the past few days? He was tall and looked very valiant. There were golden feathers in his hair.”

Listening to his description, the old man pondered for a moment, then shook his head and said, “Sir, this Endless Sea is almost a pool of stagnant water. In recent years, no one has been exiled to enter. The person you described definitely could not have come here.”

A flash of disappointment flashed across Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Then, he turned around and prepared to leave.

“Sir, this Ranch of the Exiled is dangerous. Please don’t stay here any longer and leave as soon as possible!” The old man quickly stepped forward and gritted his teeth. “The sooner, the better.”

Although Jian Wushuang was a little confused, he could tell that he was not lying.

He nodded and prepared to leave.

However, it was already too late.

Several black lights burst out from the surroundings and stood in front of Jian Wushuang.

A total of four figures with rich energy appeared. They locked onto this stranger in an instant.

Three short and one tall, three early-stage Grand Yan Immortals and one Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, each of them had extremely abundant derivation energy.

However, their eyes were all red, as if they had seen prey.

The old man’s expression changed drastically and he said in a low voice, “Sir, let’s leave quickly. If we don’t leave now, we really won’t be able to leave.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave. If he was facing a single Grand Yan Immortal, he would not be afraid at all. However, now that he was facing four Grand Yan Immortals, the situation was not optimistic.

At this moment, the tallest Grand Yan Immortal among the four saw the old man beside Jian Wushuang and sneered, “So you, the Old Shepherd, dare to attack? This is your prey? A new exiled person?”

The old man who was called Old Shepherd gritted his teeth and said nothing. Finally, he said, “That’s right. This is my prey. You can leave.”

The four Grand Yan Immortals laughed at the same time, “You, an Old Shepherd, dare to speak like this? Your prey?”

The tallest Grand Yan Immortal walked out and waved his hand across the air. Immediately, the unparalleled Yan energy sent him flying.

The old man flew a thousand feet away like a kite with a broken string, then fell to the ground.

Everything happened too quickly. By the time Jian Wushuang reacted, the four Grand Evolution Immortals had already rushed toward him.

Four unparalleled flows of energy exploded in a corner of the continent.

The air trembled, clearly unable to withstand the might of a Grand Yan Immortal.

In the next moment, a seven-star galaxy appeared between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows.

Immortal Style, Little Mountain River.

The current Little Mountain River was no longer the Little Mountain River from before. It had grown along with Jian Wushuang’s growth.

He suddenly opened his five fingers and burst out a huge torrent!

The Yan power turned into a torrent and gushed out. Caught off guard, it swept away the three Grand Yan Immortals who were at the front.

Rumble!

The torrent exploded, causing the four Grand Yan Immortals to be in a sorry state.

After stopping, the shortest Grand Yan Immortal was furious, “Damn it, I will definitely kill you today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly condensed a long spear in his hand and threw it at Jian Wushuang.

The long spears expanded in the wind and split into thousands in an instant. They came at him like a rain of spears.

Jian Wushuang did not panic at all when he saw this scene. He quietly condensed an Invisible Sword in his hand.

He stood with his sword in hand, the wind blowing at the corner of his clothes, making him look desolate and lonely.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Ocean Sword Intent, first move.

Star.

The sword slashed out without any fancy moves.

In an instant, a million Sword Intents descended from the sky!

The rain of nearly a thousand spears that came at them were shattered when they came into contact with the Sword Intents. Not even a trace of their aura was left behind.

Moreover, that sword strike did not lose its momentum as it surged forward, tearing the land under its feet apart.

The short Grand Yan Immortal who was the first to bear the brunt was shocked. He had never thought that this sword strike would be so terrifying.

The Sword Intents were like a mountain or a sea, instantly wrapping him up.

The other three Grand Yan Immortals dodged in time and watched this scene with trepidation.
