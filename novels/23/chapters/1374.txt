Chapter 1375: Give a lesson to Qu Yang

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the Star River, Jian Wushuang and Qu Yang stood face to face. Silence spread over the surroundings.

“Qu Yang.”

Jian Wushuang raised his head, “I’m okay with giving you the Meta Beast, but I feel uncomfortable with your attitude to me.”

“Who cares? In the Lineage of Star, no one respects you.” Qu Yang sneered.

Jian Wushuang didn’t respond but stared at Qu Yang. A flash of light was sent out from his eyes.

Bang!

The light was the great soul power generated by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang generated it so quickly and silently that it shot out to Qu Yang in just one second.

“What?”

Qu Yang was surprised. He knew it was a soul attack but he couldn’t resist.

Bang!

Qu Yang felt like billions of thunderstorms had struck him, and his consciousness came to a halt.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang continued to beat him with his palms.

Bang!

The sound of the beats were resounding. Qu Yang was knocked down, causing blood to fly from his mouth. It took him a while to stand stably.

After Qu Yang recovered his consciousness, he found that a scarlet, palm-shaped scar was left on the left side of his face.

It hurt!

Qu Yang was shocked!

“If you were not a disciple from the Lineage of Star and if we were out of the territory of the Lineage of Star, I would have killed you!” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Then Jian Wushuang left Qu Yang alone.

Qu Yang was speechless and stunned.

The scar on his face told him what had just happened.

“How can this be possible?!”

“Why is his consciousness attack so strong?”

“Much stronger than one hundred and twenty years ago!”

…

Jian Wushuang continued to walk through the Star River.

“I have kept a low profile and stayed focused on cultivation for the past one hundred and twenty years. No one knows that my power had increased dramatically.”

“Qu Yang believed that I was weak.”

“And now he has learned his lesson.”

Jian Wushuang laughed.

One hundred and twenty years ago, he had been defeated by thirteen disciples.

He had indeed been weak at that time. Ordinary disciples found it easy to defeat him.

But now things were different.

He had made a great breakthrough.

He had caught up with ordinary disciples and passed the first level of the Star Tower in a test of his secret skills and swordsmanship.

But the most dramatic improvement was in his soul power.

The resources in the Reset Palace, as one of the most valuable treasures in the Lineage of Star, had indeed helped him a lot.

Furthermore, he had used Meta Beast’s power to facilitate his soul power.

The most important resources came from the Universal Dao Scripture from his master Xuan Yi.

The Universal Dao Scripture was a high-level guide to improving soul power.

Jian Wushuang had gained great benefits from the Universal Dao Scripture when he was in Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

But the Reset Palace was more challenging and therefore more powerful than the the Universal Dao Scripture.

Within one hundred and twenty years, Jian Wushuang’s soul power had increased to nearly the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven.

He could generate soul power that even an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven couldn’t resist.

That was why Qu Yang had been easily defeated.

Qu Yang’s consciousness was just barely equal to an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven.

So he had lost consciousness under Jian Wushuang’s attack.

In this way, Jian Wushuang could take chances to attack him.

“Since you have improved your soul power a lot, it is now easier for you to exercise the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Yes, I can now use the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan five times in a short time.”

One hundred and twenty years ago, he could have only used it once at a time!

“Continue to improve yourself to the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven so that you can exercise the second level of the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan rather than the first now. It will be a big advantage in the Selection Battle for Disciples in the Star Palace.” King of Venomous Worms said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He went back to the Reset Palace.

There he continued to improve his soul power with the help the Meta Beast’s power.

As for Qu Yang, he didn’t mention anything about Jian Wushuang and his scar. It was too shameful for him.

So no one else knew Jian Wushuang’s power.

Six years soon passed.

Jian Wushuang paused his cultivation in the Reset Palace.

“I have consumed all my Meta Beast’s power, but my soul power is still at the level of an Advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven. No breakthroughs yet.”

“Maybe I should go to the Four Mystery Lands for new inspiration.”

Jian Wushuang thought.
