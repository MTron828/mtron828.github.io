Chapter 489: Killed on the Spot

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The blow split the air, and before it even struck Jian Wushuang, its waves had already left a bottomless saber mark on the land below them.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes darkened as he leaped forward and swung the Triple-kill Sword at his opponent. The sword light was like a bolt of lightning that would continue moving forward until it struck its enemies.

Jian Wushuang displayed the second move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Desperation!

The golden Sword Soul Phantom that was behind Jian Wushuang also attacked at the same time.

The power from his Sword Soul exploded forth.

At the same time, the seven Slaughter Origin marks were activated and released their full power.

The sword light became as dazzling as the sun.

Marquis Nanyu’s killing intent continued increasing and his blow became even more fierce.

“Die!” he growled hoarsely, with a grim look on his face.

The two faced each other head-on, and they both used their?full power. Neither one of them was taking it easy!

Marquis Nanyu, as a marquis in the Seven-cloud Realm, was quite confident about his power. He intended to defeat this insignificant opponent, who was only in the Saint Realm, using a single strike.

However, his opponent, Jian Wushuang, also had confidence in his strength.

With only his seven Slaughter Origin marks, he might be slightly inferior to Marquis Nanyu, but he also had the Heavenly Creation Skill and a strong body to help make up the difference, as well as the Heart-killing Sword Technique from the Sword Ancestor.

Most importantly, he had his Sword Soul!

He was backed by the power of the Strongest Sword Soul.

All added together, Jian Wushuang’s attack was something that could shake the world.

Boom!

The two blows collided and the two formidable forces exploded.

The whole area quivered as a visible blast wave swept over everything as it rippled out from the point of impact.

It caused the sky to tremble and the ground to crack open.

When the blast wave hit a mountain, the mountain was crushed into dust.

“Step back!”

The experts who had been watching the battle from off in the distance drew back even farther when they saw the wave, afraid to unintentionally get involved.

The whole battlefield was a surging storm of power.

Swish! Suddenly, a figure shot out from the storm like a bullet. The figure kept rolling as he flew backwards, and didn’t stop until he was hundreds of meters away.

After regaining his balance, the figure’s face flushed red, and he spat out a mouthful of blood onto the ground.

Opposite the figure, a youthful figure walked out of the storm with a long sword in hand.

The young figure was Jian Wushuang. “Your power doesn’t live up to your name, Marquis Nanyu.” His words resounded throughout the area.

The onlookers were muddled by what they had seen.

Marquis Nanyu was not weaker than them.

“How is this possible!”

“I’m a marquis, in the Seven-cloud Realm! He is only in the Saint Realm! How could I be overpowered by him when fighting head-to-head?”

He was completely overpowered. He had been knocked back hundreds of meters by that one strike and was injured to the point that he coughed up blood.

But, it should have been Jian Wushuang that was overpowered, not him!

The result was totally beyond the marquis’s expectations.

“How could that boy defeat a marquis?”

Confusion rocked everyone’s mind. They were all in shock because they didn’t know that Jian Wushuang was not just an ordinary expert in the Saint Realm.

His cultivation followed a path that defied the heavens with every step he took.

A normal Saint Realm expert would step into the Cloud Realm after condensing three Origin Marks, but Jian Wushuang had condensed seven Origin Marks, which was the same number of marks as Marquis Nanyu.

The difference was that Jian Wushuang possessed Origin Marks while the marquis had Clouds, which were much more powerful.

Jian Wushuang had overcome the difference by depending on the Heavenly Creation Skill and his strong body.

That was to say, even without his Sword Soul, Jian Wushuang still had a chance of beating Marquis Nanyu. But, by using it, he was able to overpower him.

Jian Wushuang stood there, towering above him, holding a sword. As he pointed forward, a vast Blood River flowed in that direction.

Relying on his current power, he could cover the whole battlefield with Road to the Underworld. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He displayed both the Hundredfold Realm and Blood Fire Domain at the same time.

The three techniques worked together and suppressed Marquis Nanyu.

“Damn!”

Marquis Nanyu’s expression changed. He was being suppressed by a mighty force and was not able to display his full power.

“He didn’t do his best.”?Marquis Nanyu shot Jian Wushuang a horrified look, at which point he noticed a trace of killing intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The marquis became frightened out of his wits.

It never occurred to him that he would fear someone in the Saint Realm to such an extent, but he was truly afraid. He knew that he was no match for Jian Wushuang.

“Run!”

Marquis Nanyu began to flee without any hesitation.

He was too frightened to think of protecting his reputation.

Regardless of whether it was fame, treasures, or Dao Weapons, nothing mattered more than his life.

“You want to run away? You’re running nowhere!”

Seeing Marquis Nanyu’s intention, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. With a flash, he left behind a shadow as he moved effortlessly through the Blood River. It only took him an instant to catch up with Marquis Nanyu.

“Marquis Nanyu, go to hell.”

Indifferent words escaped Jian Wushuang’s mouth, sentencing Marquis Nanyu to death.

Marquis Nanyu turned around upon hearing the words and saw Jian Wushuang’s sword flying towards him like lighting again.

The sword was so fast that he knew he had no chance, even if he had not been suppressed by the Realm technique.

“No!”

Marquis Nanyu screamed miserably before he was pierced by the Triple-kill Sword.
