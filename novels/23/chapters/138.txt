Chapter 139: It was still raining...

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Born in the Sword Marquis Mansion, the acknowledged top hegemon in Bashui Commandery, Jian Wushuang was familiar with the big forces within the commandery.

Situ family was one of the greatest families in Bashui Commandery, and Situ Qingyue, the Master, was an expert at the Gold Core Realm.

After all, within such a small place like Bashui Commandery, an expert in the Gold Core Realm could be seen as one of the strongest.

Jian Wushuang had seen him before, at the Sword Marquis Token Battle three years ago when the great masters of all the forces were invited to come and watch. Situ Qingyue was one of the invitees.

“Situ Qingyue belongs to Blood Feather Tower?” Jian Wushuang asked while coldly staring at An Ying.

“Yes. He is one of us, and he has a very special position in Blood Feather Tower. Although his strength is only at the Gold Core Realm, his orders come directly from the Tower Master. Even I can’t enjoy such treatment,” An Ying shouted in a low voice.

“Directly ordered by the Master of Blood Feather Tower?” Jian Wushuang was shocked but he believed his words, more or less.

Anyway, Blood Feather Tower was desperate to kill him just because his Sword Soul had awoken. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Common people knew nothing and had never even heard about Sword Soul. Neither had the assassins of Blood Feather Tower.

Yet, as long as Situ Qingyue was directly ordered by the Tower Master, maybe he knew something about Sword Soul.

As soon as he awoke the Sword Soul in that battle, Situ Qingyue must have immediately sensed it, and then notify Blood Feather Tower to hunt and kill him.

“I have said everything I should say. Kill me! Quickly kill me!” An Ying crazily roared.

“You want to die? It’s not so easy.”

With a sneer, Jian Wushuang waved his sword with brilliant light, breaking the tendons in An Ying’s legs.

“Behave yourself and wait here for me! Don’t worry, I had you swallow that elixir before feeding you the leech. That elixir is a panacea. You won’t die.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang walked away, leaving An Ying crazily roaring in the cave. However, the cave was so deep that no one could hear his roar.

Jian Wushuang mounted a Griffin and directly flew towards Bashui Commandery. It was already dark when he arrived in Bashui Commandery, stopping in front of the Situ family mansion.

Boom~~~Above the void was rumbling thunder.

The rain was still pouring.

“The rain hasn’t stopped, so let the slaughter continue...”

Situ Mansion was brightly lit.

As one of the biggest families within Bashui Commandery, the Situ family mansion was still very bustling even at night.

Suddenly...Bang!

The Situ Mansion gate was directly kicked open, as a thundering boom shook the air. Numerous warriors in the Situ family were disturbed and came out.

“Who is it?”

“How dare you! You dare trespass into our Situ family!”

Numerous figures rushed out and quickly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. The leader of them was Situ Qingyue.

“Master Situ, I haven’t seen you for years. How are you?” Jian Wushuang slowly walked towards Situ Qingyue while speaking. Meanwhile, he had lightly raised his head, showing his handsome face.

Clearly seeing Jian Wushuang’s face, Situ Qingyue opened his eyes widely and shouted, “Jian Wushuang, it’s you!”

“Jian Wushuang?” A commotion arose in the area. Evidently, all the warriors of the Situ family had heard about the exceptional genius from Sword Marquis Mansion, who had shocked the whole Bashui Commandery.

“Hehe, as long as you still remember me, things will be easier. Answer me! Where is my aunt?” Jian Wushuang coldly asked.

Situ Qingyue was astonished. Naturally, he knew who his aunt was, but he pretended to be confused and asked, “Who is your aunt?”

“Still pretending?” Jian Wushuang sneered and suddenly appeared in front of Situ Qingyue like a shadow. In the next instant, Situ Qingyue had been explosively knocked out, spouting blood as he flew backward.

Bang!

Situ Qingyue heavily fell upon a chair in the hall, which immediately exploded.

“Master!”

Those warriors of the Situ family were all scared and angry, but no one dared to move.

Even Situ Qingyue, in the Gold Core Realm, had been severely hurt without clearly seeing Jian Wushuang. If they stood out, it was just like seeking their doom.

“I will ask you again! Where is my aunt? If you still won’t answer me, today I’ll slaughter the whole Situ family, leaving no one alive!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was icy cold, with great killing intent.

Situ Qingyue’s throat tightened as he spoke, “I, I’ll take you there.”

“Hm, really pretending,” Jian Wushuang said while coldly smiled.

Then Situ Qingyue struggled to stand up, and led Jian Wushuang towards a secret chamber in the mansion.

Kuang! The door of Situ family’s secret underground chamber immediately opened.

It was a very dark chamber. As soon as Jian Wushuang entered, he saw a woman in a cage in the front of the chamber.

Her hair was in a mess covering half of her face. While the other half was full of malignant tumors and scars, looking extremely ugly. The offensive odor from her body could be smelt even in the distance.

“Auntie!”

Jian Wushuang recognized this woman as soon as he saw her, and then he immediately rushed towards her.

Just as Jian Wushuang started to move, next to him, a sparkle appeared in Situ Qingyue’s eyes. Although the latter looked terribly pale and was covering his chest with one hand.

“Attack!” Situ Qingyue shouted loudly.

One black iron pillar after another suddenly rose from the ground on which Jian Wushuang just rushed past, forming a giant cage. In an instant, the whole secret chamber was covered, and Jian Wushuang was trapped within the cage.

“Haha.” Seeing this scene, Situ Qingyue finally laugh out loudly.

Jian Wushuang stopped his steps and could not help changing his face as he turned around and found the cage in front of him.

“Jian Wushuang, you must have never thought about it.” Situ Qingyue stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold smile. “When building this secret chamber, I had predicted that such a scene would happen one day, so I set up this trap from the beginning.”

“The surrounding walls of this secret chamber are made of black steel with a thickness of over three meters. No one could break through them. As for the iron pillars in front of you, they are forged with raven gold. Except supreme experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, no one can...”

Before he finished his words, Situ Qingyue suddenly became stunned.

As Jian Wushuang abruptly waved his hand, a sharp and brilliant sword light suddenly burst out. Although the iron pillars were made by raven gold and incomparably hard, they were instantly broken into pieces as soon as the sword light touched them.

Whoosh!

A figure unexpectedly appeared beside Situ Qingyue.

“You!” Situ Qingyue opened his eyes widely, staring at Jian Wushuang in front of him.

“I planned to let you live a little longer, but now, it’s unnecessary.” Jian Wushuang’s icy voice rang in his ears, and then a sword light burst out.

SHUA!

Situ Qingyue’s head was completely separated from his body.
