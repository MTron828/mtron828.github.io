Chapter 2330: Humility

A Half Step Divine Demon was a rare asset to come by for the fight against the Zhuge Family.

A Chaotic Divine Demon would certainly help the Lin Family even more.

Now, Lin Tao brought over a Chaotic Divine Demon and three Half Step Divine Demons.

“Haha, Brother Tao.”

Lin Qingqing and Lin Yan rushed towards Lin Yan at the first moment they could.

“Oh? Yan? Qingqing? It’s the two of you,” Lin Tao recognised both of them.

“It’s been over a decade since we last met, you have all grown so much.”

Lin Tao had left for the Thunder Sound Sect at the age of 27. Twelve years had passed, and he was already 39.

They made some small talk.

“Come, Brother Tao, let me introduce you to a Sword Principle genius, Brother Wushuang. My father said his gifts in Sword Principle were the best in the Anjiu Commandery, and perhaps even in the entire Wusha Barren Region,” Lin Yan said as he pointed at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang flinched and smiled bitterly.

Lin Yan was not a good talker.

It would have been fine if he had said that to others. But Lin Tao was a genius, and there were definitely many other geniuses in Thunder Sound Sect that were proficient in Sword Principle. Lin Yan’s statement would certainly attract unnecessary attention.

Indeed, Lin Tao and his three Half Step Divine Demons, and even that Divine Demon beauty, shifted their gazes towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and said humbly, “Greetings to all, I’m Jian Wushuang.”

“Jian Wushuang?” Lin Tao stared at him curiously.

“Unparalleled in Sword Principle, what a powerful name. I wonder if your Sword Principle cultivation base lives up to your name.” A black-robed man behind Lin Tao smiled widely with his teeth showing. He had a longsword behind his back, stating the obvious that he was into sword cultivation.

“The name was given to me by my parents. In terms of Sword Principle cultivation base, it’s not as exaggerated as Young Lord Yan claimed. I’m considered ordinary compared to you all from the Thunder Sound Sect,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Modest too,” Lin Tao nodded.

The black-robed man with the longsword shrugged his shoulders. He had no intention to go after Jian Wushuang after he had put himself down.

“Yan, you can say that within the Lin Mansion, but not outside. Don’t make trouble for him,” Lin Tao instructed.

“But...” Lin Yan only wanted to say how gifted Jian Wushuang was, but Jian Wushuang pulled his sleeve.

“Young Lord Tao is right. There are countless talents around, I’m really nothing much compared to the Wusha Barren Region,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He did not want to cause any trouble.

Lin Yan naturally did not say much.

“It’s nice to see someone with modesty,” Lin Tao nodded. Even if the Lin Family Head said Jian Wushuang was the best in Sword Principle in the entire Wusha Barren Region, he would take it with a pinch of salt.

After all, his worldview had changed the moment he entered the Thunder Sound Sect.

He knew that the land was unfathomable, and geniuses could be anywhere and everywhere.

Even in the Wusha Barren Region, the strongest Sword Principle genius had dared not claim to be the best in the Wusha Barren Region.

Lin Tiefeng was a Chaotic Divine Demon, but his worldview was limited to only the Anjiu Commandery.

His judgement naturally could not mean much then.

After some chit chat, Lin Tiefeng and the Lin Family top experts welcomed him as well.

Lin Tiefeng and the rest were naturally excited when they saw the four experts Lin Tao being brought over.

After a while, everyone congregated at the Lin Mansion’s conference hall, including the experts that the Lin Mansion had invited.

Zhuo Yunfeng was there as well. Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, hid at a small corner with Lin Yan.

Lin Tiefeng sat at the front, then stood up and bowed to the crowd in front of him.

“Thank you all for providing the Lin Family with much needed assistance during dire circumstances like these. Especially the four experts from the Thunder Sound Sect, led by Fire Fairy. Thank you!”

“You’re too kind, Head.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Chaotic Divine Demon beauty from the Thunder Sound Sect, Fire Fairy, said, “Lin Tao is one of the core disciples of the Thunder Sound Sect. If his family is in trouble, we will naturally help him, but because we had an agreement amongst clans to not interfere in every single clan or family feud, we can only send over some core disciples here. Please forgive us.”

“Nonsense. We are already eternally grateful for your assistance.” Lin Tiefeng smiled.

There were many sects in the Wusha Barren Region. Some of the clans controlled regions, but most did not.

As time passed, the sects had an agreement to not interfere too much in family feuds within the region.

Even if they had disciples in that family, the clan could only send a small number of experts to help.

Lin Tiefeng knew all that and naturally understood.

“The Thunder Sound Sect can’t help us completely, and neither can the Dongzuo Sect help the Zhuge Family too much. They will at most send a Chaotic Divine Demon and some Half Step Divine Demons. The remaining forces will simply be Lin versus the Zhuge Family.” Lin Tiefeng’s voice was clear and echoed within the hall.

“The Zhuge Family have been fighting with us for years, we know each other well. We are about equally as powerful, how much stronger can they be? The only reason they dare challenge us is that one Half Step Divine Demon recently ascended into Divine Demon levels. Even then, it won’t be that easy to decimate us.”

After hearing what Lin Tiefeng had to say, the hall was filled with whispers.

Many experts invited by the Lin Mansion nodded.

The Lin Family and Zhuge Family had fought for so many years. Even if they had one more person that ascended to Chaotic Demon levels, even if they had Dongzuo Sect’s help, they could not destroy the Lin Family.

After all, the Lin Family had the Thunder Sound Sect behind them and had invited experts to help at all costs.
