4913 The Arrival of the Heavenly Official

The three top cultivators who flew over felt that something was wrong.

They hurriedly retreated, but they were still half a step too late.

Swish…

The sound of cloth being torn apart resounded, and a long and narrow hole was opened in the void.

The three top cultivators who retreated all looked at him solemnly.

At this moment, there was a scarlet line of blood on the same spot on their cheeks, and divine blood was dripping from the wound.

An ordinary horizontal slash had injured the three top cultivators.

They all felt the palpitating Sword Intent, but they were still unable to dodge it. If they had not stopped in time, the consequences would not have been just this.

“Motherf*cker, you’re courting death!” One of the youngest top cultivators was furious. He wiped the divine blood on his face and rushed forward.

Xu Jin raised his eyebrows. Facing this powerful top cultivator, he had no fear.

Flowing Cloud Grass Sword, second move.

Moon Link.

The True Sword slashed straight down, taking advantage of the remaining power of the previous move, Star Bind, to erupt with the coldest sword attack.

The cultivator smiled evilly as if he was prepared for this. He shook his arms and created a barrier around his body to counter the attack.

In the next moment, the two collided. The thin Xu Jin was directly sent flying a thousand feet away. Even the True Sword in his hand almost fell off.

The top cultivator stood rooted to the ground and laughed loudly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Cough cough…” Xu Jin slowly straightened his body, wiped the divine blood from the corner of his mouth, and looked at him calmly.

A shocking scene appeared. The top cultivator who was originally laughing loudly suddenly shut his mouth. His expression was solemn as he looked at his chest in disbelief.

His heart was pierced through by a sword, and his Life Source turned into mottled starlight that quickly seeped out.

“No, that’s impossible! How can my Life Souorce be damaged?” He was extremely terrified and then died.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye. In just one exchange, he had killed a top cultivator of the same realm. No top cultivator dared to underestimate such combat strength.

The remaining two top cultivators had extremely grave expressions. Clearly, the death of their companion had given them great pressure.

The two of them looked at each other and then moved at the same time. They directly flew towards Xu Jin and exploded with their strongest attacks.

The void trembled as two boundless energies arrived.

Xu Jin took another deep breath. He had relied on the second move of the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword to kill a top cultivator of the same realm. He was not familiar with the third move, so he was afraid that he would not be able to unleash it to its fullest.

Even though he was thinking this, he still released the third move.

Water Travel.

The third move, Water Travel, was actually a move that combined the two Sword Intents and used them.

Although it seemed simple, it contained a myriad of hidden meanings. If one was not completely familiar with the first two Sword Intents, one would not be able to unleash them at all.

As soon as the Water Travel Sword Intent was released, the entire void seemed to turn into a spring.

The two peak cultivators who had been going all out felt like they were drowning when they stepped in. They were suddenly bound and could not even release their Yan power!

It was in this short moment that Xu Jin’s thin figure arrived. He held a True Sword in his hand, as if he was the Heavenly Dao that was in charge of punishment, and he began to harvest.

The void was silent. At this moment, the eyes of all the peak cultivators and even the Yan Immortals who saw this scene lit up.

Even the old Grand Yan Immortal with cloudy eyes looked at Xu Jin.

It was because this sword strike was simple and clear, but it was also extremely stunning, making everyone who saw it want to learn.

The two top cultivators who had been bound by the Water Travel sword strike were no longer alive. They fell into the abyss like stone statues.

Xu Jin withdrew his sword that was soaked in divine blood. He panted heavily. It was obvious that after completely releasing these three Sword Intents, he no longer had the strength to fight.

However, even so, his expression was still calm, as if he did not care about anything.

He was already very satisfied with killing three top cultivators of the same realm with three sword strikes. At the same time, he recalled the figure with fluttering clothes in his divine sense.

He was afraid that from now on, he would never be able to comprehend the subtlety of the second half of the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword Style.

Even the wind in the void quieted down, and it was completely silent.

Immediately after, the voice of the old Grand Yan Immortal sounded, “Junior, tell me the Sword Dao you cultivate and I will let you live. I will also let you cultivate under me. How about it?”

The moment these words were said, all the Yan Immortals were in an uproar, to be able to gain the favor of a rank Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, his future cultivation path would definitely be extremely bright.

This guy was only a top cultivator, if he agreed, breaking through to the Yan Immortal realm was just around the corner. In an instant, many Yan Immortals were envious.

Xu Jin laughed. He seemed to be extremely happy, and his clear voice resounded in the void.

However, in the next moment, he returned to normal, and his clear eyes were filled with disdain.

“You think you’re worthy?”

All the Yan Immortals were stunned, they could not believe that a small top cultivator would give up such a generous offer and even insult the Grand Yan Immortal?!

Just when all the Yan Immortals thought that the old Grand Yan Immortal would be furious, they did not expect him to be expressionless, as though he was not scolding them.

“Since you don’t want to tell me the Sword Dao you cultivate, I won’t force you. Tell me the name of the creator of the Sword Dao, and I’ll let you live. How about it?”

The elderly Grand Yan Immortal slowly spoke with a gentle tone.

Xu Jin smiled coldly and glanced at him from the corner of his eyes. Then, he sheathed his sword.

“If my master’s name reaches your ears, it will dirty my master’s name. No matter how stupid a disciple is, he would never do such a thing.”

He was ready to die.

Before the elderly Grand Yan Immortal could get angry, a voice that seemed to descend from the nine heavens sounded.

“Since you want to know my name so much, why don’t I tell you myself?”

All the Yan Immortals were terrified, they all looked behind them as if they were facing a great enemy.

A black-robed ranger slowly walked over from the silent shattered void.

His entire body was covered in majestic divine patterns, exuding an indescribable aura that even Yan Immortals could not look straight at.

Two figures followed closely behind him.

One of them was a bald giant that was as sturdy as a divine mountain. He was rubbing his fists and rubbing his palms, as if he was waiting for an order before he would go all out.

The other figure held a silver spear in his hand. His arrogant aura was obvious, and he was filled with an invincible aura.

All the Yan Immortals held their breaths as they watched this scene.

“It’s, it’s Heavenly Official Jian!”

In the Six Heavens Realm, the few remaining Yan Immortals shouted at the same time, their eyes red.

“Heavenly Official Jian! Heavenly Official Jian!”

At this moment, all the remaining top cultivators in the Six Heavens Realm spontaneously shouted.
