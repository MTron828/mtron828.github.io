“Mister Emperor Bai, this is…” Jian Wushuang looked at the elixir in Emperor Bai’s hand.

He could feel that the elixir was unusual. Even he couldn’t help but felt greed in him the moment he saw the elixir.

“This is Seven Treasure Divine Elixir,” Emperor Bai smiled, “I got this elixir by sheer luck a long time ago. It was in the first era when I was wandering in the ancient battlefield. I found five in total and I am only left with two now.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This elixir is amazing. Even in ancient times, it was considered a top grade item. Many experts in ancient times, including those existences above Great Emperor, would use this elixir at crucial times. After consuming this elixir, the super experts who were above Great Emperor could recover their divine power instantly. To inverse cultivators like us, it is shockingly useful!”

“You know that we inverse cultivators could constantly fuel our divine body as long as we had enough divine power. Even if I consume this Seven Treasure Divine Elixir, it could instantly recover more than an ordinary level of divine power. To you who are only in the first stage, your divine power could be instantly recovered after you consume this elixir.

Jian Wushuang was delighted when he heard that.

His divine power could be instantly recovered when he consumed the elixir.

It was considered another life to an ordinary cultivator, but to an inverse cultivator… It was even more useful.

His current divine power enabled him to reorganize his divine body for four times, which meant four extra lives.

With the addition of Seven Treasure Divine Elixir, his divine body could be reorganized eight times!!!

Just how amazing was that!

“The elixir is what I prepared for your troop. But among the four members in the troop who are going to enter the dark millstone, only you can give full play to the power of this elixir. So, I am giving it to you,” Emperor Bai passed the Seven Treasure Divine Elixir to Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you Emperor Bai,” Jian Wushuang quickly thanked him.

“Everything is for Eternal Chaotic World. Go ahead and get ready,” Emperor Bai waved.

Jian Wushuang left then.

There was only Emperor Bai left in Presbytery Pavilion. Emperor Bai watched Jian Wushuang as he disappeared at the end and there was a strange light twinkling in his eyes.

In actual fact, he had arranged for Jian Wushuang to go into the dark millstone not only because Jian Wushuang would be helpful to the troop, but because there was also another reason. Emperor Bai wanted Jian Wushuang to receive greater training.

It was about time for Eternal Chaotic World. It at most had another one thousand years to go. By then, the two dark forces would definitely incite war.

In merely a thousand years, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t improve much with ordinary training. Hence, he had to be sent for polishing.

…

Jian Wushuang immediately started to make arrangements when he returned to Green Fire World.

No one knew what would happen in the dark millstone. Jian Wushuang wasn’t even sure if he could come out alive.

Hence, Jian Wushuang naturally had to make the necessary arrangements.

In the lofty palace.

“Father, after I leave, you shall take over the great formation that merged with spacetime storm. As for those Dao soldiers, Hall Master Yuan and you can work together to take care of them. If there is any problem in Green Fire World, Green Fire World can discuss with Lineage of Star.”

“Jian Yi, stay back in Green Fire World to serve as a deterrent to other experts.”

“Hall Master Yuan…”

Jian Wushuang passed down the tasks one by one.

Everyone who was seated in the hall looked extremely solemn.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang was going to a dangerous place and it was hard to predict his life and death.

“Third Brother. Do you have to go no matter what?” Wang Yuan looked at him.

“No matter what,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “This is not only for Eternal Chaotic World, it is also for Green Fire World. This crisis concerns the life and death of Eternal Chaotic World. If we fail, the entire Eternal Chaotic World will vanish. Green Fire World naturally won’t exist either. Hence… All experts in Eternal Chaotic World will be obligated!”

Jian Wushuang was determined.

Everyone around him saw his determination and didn’t pursue further.

Then, Jian Wushuang began to prepare for his trip into the dark millstone.

Although ten years’ time wasn’t long, at least he was given some time to prepare himself.

“It’s a pity that the dark millstone appeared all of a sudden and a little too early. If it had appeared a little later, by about a hundred years, I would be able to cultivate the ancient tribe’s first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body. By then, my divine body and my divine power would improve again. Regardless of if it was my overall power or my defensive power, both would improve tremendously. Then, I would be even more confident in surviving.”

“It’s a pity…”

Jian Wushuang found it a regrettable matter but he had no alternatives.

The crisis had descended and he had to deal with it.

In ten years’ time, Great Emperor Colored Glaze had passed the four of them the concealment skill.

Besides, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao had made a trip to Green Fire World one after another and they had received the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace in Lineage of Star.

Although the three Great Emperor had received the perfect inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, the three of them could only perform the first volume, no matter how hard they tried.

It was impossible for them to even perform the second volume!

It seemed that only Jian Wushuang and the Star Palace Master, who had already passed away, had cultivated the second volume successfully in the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

Star Palace Master had once absorbed the blood essence of an expert from Seven Star Black Sect but Jian Wushuang… It was smooth sailing for his cultivation. Not to mention the second volume, he had already cultivated the third volume successfully.

Of course, even the first volume itself would be a great trump card for the three Great Emperors.

It was a pity that the trump card would require a long time until if could be performed the next time again. Hence, they didn’t dare to use it recklessly.

Ten years passed by very quickly.

Jian Wushuang was well prepared and he handed down all the tasks. Then, he left.

In Eternal Chaotic World, in the boundless dark void.

It was still extremely far from the ten cultivation sanctuaries.

In the dark void then, there was a huge black steel ball that was far bigger than the size of a holy kingdom spinning and traveling forward.

Everywhere it passed would vanish. There was no space for struggle.

In the dark void near the dark millstone, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were a few figures that appeared simultaneously.

The higher-ups from Sanctuary Alliance, led by Emperor Bai, Red Dragon King, Ancestor Tian Chen and the others were there.

Of course, Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo, Emperor Jiu Qiao were there too.

Their gazes were fixed upon the huge black steel ball before them.
