Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How could it be?”

The Celestial Master’s brow knitted, he looked in shock at Jian Nantian.

The observing crowd also looked serious.

The had witnessed the entire fight between Celestial Master Ku Xin and Jian Nantian from the very beginning.

They had witnessed the Celestial Master’s skills and Killing Moves such as Illusion Attack, Sound Wave Attack, and etc. The Celestial Master had used all his secret skills.

However, no matter how many skills he had utilized, Jian Nantian stayed put and brandished his sword casually, warding off all his moves.

“Is he not affected by Illusion Attack at all?”

“And stay unmoved facing Sound Wave Attack?”

“Moreover, he even dodged the best hit I’ve just struck?”

The Celestial Master looked terrible. But soon, he snorted and spoke in a deep voice. “Jian Nantian, what a Supervisor that has passed nine tests from Samsara Temple! You’ve exceeded my expectations.”

“In the same realm, if I meet you elsewhere, I must kill you right on the spot. However, here is my clan, I’ve got all the legacy of my prosperous Ancient Demon Clan… you, can’t win this!”

“Open the Energy-gathering Formation!”

Hearing Celestial Master Ku Xin, on top of an Ancient Demon Clan’s towering altar, a dozen of Celestial Masters’ eyes flashed with excitement.

Boom!

A terrifying energy was released from the altar. The world seemed to be covered in the great power. Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy in the Void was gathered rapidly from all directions. They all went in the direction of Celestial Master Ku Xin.

Standing above the Void, absorbing these amazing Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy, his aura was becoming increasingly strong.

At the sight of this, Jian Wushang squinted.

“Well, they’ve prepared themselves. They actually have set up such an Energy-gathering Formation.” Gu King faintly smiled.

In a so-called Energy-gathering Formation, one could gather the nearby Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy and absorbed them. Finally, they could use the power temporarily.

It was a common formation in Green Fire World.

If it was just a normal formation, Jian Wushuang would have ignored it. Nevertheless, this formation was growing bigger and bigger, covering a big part of the land.

With this amount of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy, Celestial Master Ku Xin had naturally strengthed himself.

At present, his aura was stronger by three tenths; his strength also grew by the same.

It might look trivial, however, in the realm of Celestial Master, even an insignificant rise would greatly increase his offensive power, speed, and etc.

The Celestial Master had reached a brand new level of the battle strength.

Above the Void, Celestial Master Ku Xin’s face looked weather-beaten. He was still covered in the red cloud; the heavenly monster spectral image behind him even expanded a little more.

“Jian Nantian, how about now? Ready to take my paw?”

Bearing an extreme confidence, he struck again.

His paw was still fierce like that of an eagle, and fast like a lightning. Shrouded in the red blood, it came at Jian Nantian.

At the moment he acted, the spectral image also reached out its paw. A giant scarlet paw fell from the sky, with overwhelming strength, it was about to land on Jian Nantian’s head.

This time, Celestial Master Ku Xin performed a paw that none of his previous ones could compare to.

Nevertheless, Jian Nantian was as calm as ever. He still brandished his longsword, casually.

A grand sword light shone.

It was a beautiful and mind-blowing one.

Swish!

The giant scarlet palm actually broke into two; massive power burst out in four directions.

“What?” Celestial Master Ku Xin was shocked. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He could accept the fact that Jian Nantian had taken his previous paw.

However, using the Energy-gathering Formation to have increased his strength, he still failed to completely destroy the latter?

“How is this possible?”

“We’re in the same Exceptional Realm of the Celestial Master. Why is he…?” Celestial Master Ku Xin still found it unbelievable.

“Celestial Master Ku Xin, you’ve been attacking from the very beginning. Now, is it time for me to take the turns?” Coldly, Jian Nantian’s voice echoed in the sky.

The observing crowd was stunned by Jian Nantian’s words.

It occurred to them that Jian Nantian had been standing in the same spot from the beginning. He had been casually warding off the Celestial Master’s blows. He did not strike even once.

He merely used his defensive skills, never a offensive swordsmanship.

“Go!”

Jian Nantian drew his sword.

Still casually, the magnificent sword light shone again.

The blow was magnificent and fast.

It nearly approached Celestial Master Ku Xin in just one second.

The Celestial Master widened his eyes and put on a serious face. At the sight of the grand sword light, red clouds rose up from his skin. Releasing his formidable aura, he lifted his palm and struck again.

The giant heavenly monster spectral image caught the beautiful sword light. However, the fierce and shredding energy in the sword light burst out.

Splash! The giant scarlet palm was sliced in half, even the adjoining red arms were split into two.

Though it was formed by the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy, Celestial Master Ku Xin still felt a pain in his palm. Then, he retraced at once.

At this moment, Jian Nantian brandished his longsword one more time.

The second sword light fell.

This swift and violent one, like a meteor, glided over the sky and reached the Celestial Master in moments.
