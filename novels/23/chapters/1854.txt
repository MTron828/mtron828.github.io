Chapter 1855: The First To Do It

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After pausing for some time, the stalwart, middle-aged man continued speaking: “This Sword Emperor is so aggressive and he is not impudent at all. This is not something that he can pretend to be so easily and he must definitely be extremely confident to do it. Moreover, where exactly did his confidence come from?”

The three people by the side looked at each other.

Jian Wushuang’s confidence?

Subconsciously, they thought about the Star Palace Master.

“Could it be that the Vientiane Tower’s prediction is really wrong and that the Star Palace Master is not dead at all. Instead, he has only entered a special place and he is unable to contact the outside world?” the evil old man said.

“It is hard to say. However, we are unable to come to a conclusion with just Emperor God Zhu Long alone,” Emperor God Tian Xiao said.

They did not know that Jian Wushuang’s confidence did not come from the Star Palace Master. Instead, it was from the power that he possessed, as well as the large number of trump cards that the Lineage of Star had.

With Jian Wushuang bringing many Dao soldiers back to the Lineage of Star and an expert from the Ancient Past overseeing things, as well as his own abilities, Jian Wushuang and the Lineage of Star were still extremely confident even though they had lost the Star Palace Master.

Especially Jian Wushuang… from the start of his training to date, he had come across all kinds of dangers and he had been used to it since a long time ago.

Moreover, he had already thought of a way out. If a great battle were to really break out and the Lineage of Star were unable to compete against its opponents even after using all its trump cards and powers, he would at least bring some core experts of the Lineage of Star and escape to the Green Fire World.

Over there, not only was it hidden and no one knew about it, there was a great formation that his Master, Xuan Yi, had deployed. As such, no one could do anything to them.

The most important thing was that the training environment in the Green Fire World was a lot better than that of the Ten Sanctuaries. As such, he could absolutely stay at the Green Fire World and hide there for a period of time to allow his Sword Servant, Jian Yi, to completely recover his abilities. Then, with the fighting capabilities of a Great Emperor, even if the Green Fire World were to appear again, who would dare to act recklessly?

Of course, Jian Wushuang would only do this at the final stage when there was no other choice.

Furthermore, due to the presence of this route of retreat, Jian Wushuang was not afraid in the slightest bit.

“If we really want to know if the Star Palace Master has died, there are only two ways to do it,” the stalwart middle-aged man said with a heavy voice.

“Firstly, we will wait for the Ancient Mystery Land to close. Then, we will see if the Star Palace Master comes out from the Ancient Mystery Land. However, there is still more than one thousand years’ time before the Ancient Mystery Land closes.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

More than one thousand years’ time was considered nothing to these old bastards who stood at the highest point of the Eternal Chaotic World and had lived for an unknown number of years. To them, it was just the instant of flicking a finger.

However, if they had to wait for another one thousand over years at then, they would feel uneasy.

After all, Jian Wushuang’s speed of growth was too fast!

His speed of growth with really incredible!

In more than one thousand years’ time, there was a high possibility that his abilities would rise again.

Moreover, the most important thing was that during the one thousand years, the Lineage of Star could make ample preparations to deal with the upcoming danger. Moreover, they could move the core experts of the Lineage of Star, as well as the method of inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, to another location secretly. Then, even if they were to fight their way in, what they would destroy would simply be an empty shell.

“In more than one thousand years’ time, there would be many changes,” the evil old man said.

“If we do not wish to wait for more than one thousand years, we can only use the second way as Jian Wushuang said. We have to force the Lineage of Star into a hopeless situation. In order to do this, we need someone to lead a big group of experts and fight their way into the Lineage of Star,” the stalwart middle-aged man’s voice was cold.

The three people by the side nodded their heads in succession.

If the Lineage of Star were already in a hopeless situation and the Star Palace Master did not show himself or there was no news about him at all, then it meant that he had died.

However, the key question was: who would they get to do that?

“Tian Xiao, during this period of time, your Soaring Heaven King Palace has had the fiercest fight against Jian Wushuang. Hence, it would be extremely logical for your Soaring Heaven King Palace to fight your way to their doorstep now,” the stalwart middle-aged man looked in the direction of Emperor God Tian Xiao.

“Forget about my Soaring Heaven King Palace. During the intense battle with Jian Wushuang previously, we lost quite a number of Almighties. If we were to have a life and death kind of great battle with the Lineage of Star again, even if we were to win, my Soaring Heaven King Palace would be close to destruction.” Emperor God Tian Xiao laughed apathetically, “How about the three of you? For the past few years, your powerhouses have already recovered to your peaks. Why not make a trip to the Lineage of Star? You should know that if you are the first one to fight your way into the Lineage of Star, the method of inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace will belong to you.”

“My Divine King Island is not so established, unlike the powerhouses of the three of you. Hence, we do not have the means to go against the Lineage of Star,” the stalwart middle-aged man shook his head repeatedly.

“With the appearance of the Ancient Mystery Land, more than seventy percent of the Almighties of my Real Martial Arts Divine Church have gone there to travel. For a short amount of time, we are unable to organize a team of experts to fight their way into the Lineage of Star,” the evil old man laughed.

As for the last person, he said right away, “My Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion will not do it.”

Upon seeing such a scene, Emperor God Tian Xiao’s eyes squinted and he laughed coldly within his heart.

Although the four powerhouses had gathered together then, they had not been united since the start and all of them had their own selfish motives.

They were still not sure about the Lineage of Star’s situation and the Star Palace Master’s death was not confirmed yet. In addition, they knew that they might obtain the method of inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace if they were to be the first one to fight their way into the Lineage of Star. However, no one dared to do it.

“Since no one is willing to take action, let’s disperse,” Emperor God Tian Xiao waved his hands and his figure was the first one to dissipated.

The remaining three people laughed nonchalantly. After that, they disappeared from the void.

In no time, the news that Emperor God Zhu Long had paid a visit to the Lineage of Star and was seriously injured by Jian Wushuang due to him talking recklessly spread within the Sanctuary Alliance.

Jian Wushuang’s aggressiveness had caused quite a number of people to be extremely surprised.

“Such aggressiveness. This Sword Emperor is probably very confident.”

“Could it be that the Star Palace Master is not dead?”

“Who knows? However, now, if we want to find out whether the Star Palace Master has really died, it will be totally useless to rely on a simple test. Someone has to take action and fight a great battle with the Lineage of Star. Moreover, he must force the Lineage of Star into a hopeless situation. However, the key thing is, who will be willing to be the first one to do it?”

The first one to do it… these words were indeed used appropriately.

Although the first person to do it would take the greatest benefit, he would need to face the greatest amount of risk.

Sticking one’s neck out, everyone knew this saying.

If the Star Palace Master were not dead, this first person who did it would face the merciless massacre of the Star Palace Master.

Although a great number of powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance were ready to start something, none of them was willing to be the first one to do it. For the next ten years’ time, even though the Sanctuary Alliance and the whole Eternal Chaotic World were seething with excitement, no one dared to take action against the Lineage of Star.

Until one day…
