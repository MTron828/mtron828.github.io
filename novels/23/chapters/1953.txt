Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Shuang Er!”

“Third Brother!”

Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, Su Rou and the others came next to Jian Wushuang.

They looked at Emperor God Xie Xin’s dead body and everyone sighed.

“He is an Almighty,” Wang Yuan couldn’t help but compliment.

“He’s an Almighty and he isn’t weak. It’s a pity that I killed countless Almighites when I was wandering in Eternal Chaotic World. Emperor God Xie Xin is nothing,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

He was telling the truth.

Back then, during the war in Lineage of Star, he wiped out the entire Almighties Alliance with one stroke. He had literally killed more than a hundred Almighties in one breath.

Compared to that, Emperor God Xie Xin was nothing.

Emperor God Xie Xin had died and the Real Gods who sought patronage from him were wiped out too.

The forces in Green Fire World naturally cheered with excitement.

At the same time, the reverence they held for their Wushuang City Master became stronger too.

It turned out that although Wushuang City Master was only a Real God, he could kill an Almighty easily!!

After Jian Wushuang had killed Emperor God Xie Xin, he returned to the secret room in Wushuang City.

Before him, the ancient bronze mirror floated in the air in silence. The bronze mirror gave out a unique aura.

“Five godly spirits. I wonder what kind of fighting power they could display under the my divine power.”

There was anticipation in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He immediately churned his divine power along with the power of ancient tribe bloodline. Then, he poured them into the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror.

These divine powers and the power of ancient tribe bloodlines were absorbed by the five godly spirits in the bronze mirror. The five godly spirits became stronger after Jian Wushuang fed them with his divine power.

Jian Wushuang went back to cultivation in seclusion but he didn’t know that when he killed Emperor God Xie Xin… Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In a void within the surrounding ancient battlefield but far from Green Fire World.

Vroom!!

A crimson flowing light that was originally flying at high speed suddenly stopped.

The crimson light dispersed and revealed a young man with crimson hair in a crimson robe.

Behind the young man was a crimson saber. His body was soaring with raging aura.

His aura revealed that he had already reached the level of Sir God.

One should know that, besides Jian Wushuang and his sword servant, Jian Yi, there was no other Almighty in Green Fire World.

The man with crimson hair in the crimson robe was obviously not someone from Green Fire World.

“Dead. Brother, he’s dead?!”

The man with crimson hair stared as he stood there with anger.

He was Sir God Xue Dao.

A Sir God expert who recently broke through and became Sir God, and had just came to prominence in Eternal Chaotic World!

At the same time, he had another identity, which was Emperor God Xie Xin’s junior!

Of course, there was almost no one who knew his identity in Eternal Chaotic World.

Just like what Jian Wushuang knew, Emperor God Xie Xin didn’t have any friends that could go with him through thick and thin. Just like the battlefield with such major opportunities, could be known as a big treasure. Even if there were to be someone he was close to, he might not be willing to share.

But he was extremely close to his one and only junior.

He had only told one person about the location of the ancient battlefield, which was his junior, Sir God Xue Dao.

When Emperor God Xie Xin came to wander in the ancient battlefield, Sir God Xue Dao came to the battlefield under the lead of Emperor God Xie Xin. However, they didn’t take any action together but they parted ways to look for their own opportunities.

Previously, when Emperor God Xie Xin had found out about Green Fire World, he had immediately sent a message to Sir God Xue Dao for him to rush over.

It was a pity that Emperor God Xie Xin had been killed by Jian Wushuang before Sir God Xue Dao had managed to get there.

Before Emperor God Xie Xin died, he had broken the spacetime seal that Jian Wushuang put up and he sent a message to Sir God Xue Dao.

“Sword Emperor, Sword Emperor is in Green Fire World!!!”

“Green Fire World was Sword Emperor’s old lair!”

“Don’t come, don’t come here ever!!!”

After the message, Emperor God Xie Xin’s token didn’t respond anymore.

It was obvious that he had died!

“Sword Emperor?”

Sir God Xue Dao’s face grew in distress.

Although he had just broken through and became a Sir God not too long ago, he had heard of Sword Emperor’s bad name too.

He was one of the experts on the top of the pyramid in Eternal Chaotic World and he was widely recognized as the number one genius.

He was only a Real God but his fighting power was beyond a Peak Emperor God. He could be known as terrifying.

“Sword Emperor is in this ancient battlefield? Green Fire World is his old lair?” Sir God Xue Dao looked horrified.

At the same time, he was surprised.

“I know now. I have finally understood why Sword Emperor is so powerful and why he could improve so quickly.”

“It turns out that he has been keeping these opportunities all to himself. He has been keeping this vast, ancient battlefield to himself!!!”

“He possesses large resources that no one else in Eternal Chaotic world has!”

“A person conquering such a vast ancient battlefield alone, taking all opportunities and treasures. If it were me, I reckon I wouldn’t be much weaker than him.”

Sir God Xue Dao roared as his gaze turned crimson.

The crimson gaze not only showed that he was envious and jealous of Jian Wushuang, he also carried boundless hatred.

Emperor God Xie Xin and him were brothers in martial arts and they were very close, ever closer than blood brothers.

Emperor God Xie Xin could be said to be his only relative in the world.

Then, Emperor God Xie Xin died.

No doubt, he had definitely died in the hands of Sword Emperor.

“Revenge! Must take revenge!”

“I have to take revenge on behalf of my brother!”

“Sword Emperor…”

Sir God Xue Dao’s face became red.

He wanted to take revenge for Emperor God Xie Xin. However, he clearly knew about his difference in power with Sword Emperor. It would be impossible if he wanted to take revenge on his own.

Even when he could receive opportunities in the ancient battlefield.

Jian Wushuang was also improving. Plus, Jian Wushuang was only a Real God then. No matter how he improved himself, it would be impossible if he wanted to catch up with Jian Wushuang.

Hence, he could only rely on the others if he wanted to take revenge.

“Humph, you conquered such a vast, ancient battlefield and enormous resources alone. Aren’t you a little too greedy?!”

Sir God Xue Dao looked cold as he thought to himself. Before long, he had made up his mind.

That day itself, Sir God Xue Dao returned on the original route where he came from.

From ancient mystery land to the surrounding battlefield in Green Fire Land, it was connected via a space gap.

One could reach the battlefield through the space gap in ancient mystery land.

Similarly, the battlefield could reach the ancient mystery land through the space gap.

Sir God Xue Dao remembered the location of the space gap very clearly. Through the space gap, he returned to Eternal Chaotic World very quickly.
