Chapter 2276 Poison Girl

The explosive crimson red lights penetrated the body of Leng Ruxue. The terrifying aura instantly ripped Leng Ruxue and the space she was in into pieces. There was no sign of pleasure on Jian Wushuang’s face. On the contrary, he took Leng Ruxue even more seriously.“What a unique martial art motion.”

Jian Wushuang stood where Leng Ruxue had disappeared. His soul power detected Leng Ruxue immediately. She was standing in the air to one side of him.

“Haha. You really are heartless.” Leng Ruxue smiled playfully.

“Her martial art motion is one of the most powerful of all that I have seen,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

No matter how unusual or eerie one’s martial art motion was, Jian Wushuang could detect where the person was with his soul power instantly.

However, it was difficult for him to detect where Leng Ruxue was when she used her martial art motion, which caused both of his attacks to miss.

“You have already attacked twice. Now, it is my turn,” Leng Ruxue said as she radiated an extremely destructive aura.

Her jet-black hair turned white immediately.

Her beautiful irises turned grey.

Her aura changed completely.

She had originally been an angel in white clothes.

She instantly turned into a demon who would destroy the entire world.

That destructive aura filled the entire Heaven and Earth. At the same time, she radiated an extremely cold aura.

In an instant, the spacetime that Jian Wushuang and Leng Ruxue was in was frozen.

Heaven and Earth went dead quiet.

It was as though they were in hell as the place was filled with a Death Mist.

“Her unique constitution evolved?” Jian Wushuang thought as he felt the terrifying death mist.

He felt depressed under the effects of the Death Mist.

It was as though he was going to turn into a corpse.

“Jian Wushuang, this is the first time I’ve used my power after I completely awakened my unique constitution. You should feel lucky that you’ll be the first to experience it.” The smile and playfulness in Leng Ruxue disappeared. What replaced it was absolute coldness and terror.

Jian Wushuang looked gloomy.

From what he knew, Leng Ruxue rarely used her power to fight.

At least he had yet to see her fight. No one knew how powerful she really was.

Jian Wushuang guessed that Leng Ruxue’s fighting power was at the level of a great emperor.

But now, without even attacking, just the aura of Leng Ruxue was putting great pressure on Jian Wushuang.

This aura was more powerful than that of Old Monster Jiao or Chen Qi. It was at the same level as Bing Shan’s aura.

“Jian Wushuang. Today, I will show you what true destruction looks like.”

Leng Ruxue looked at Jian Wushuang indifferently. She remained in place as she pointed her finger out in front of her.

Instantly, an endless grey mist started to fill this Heaven and Earth before crashing towards Jian Wushuang like a tsunami.

Jian Wushuang used his divine power immediately to stop the grey mist. He soon realized his divine power had been completely suppressed by the silver mist to a ten meter radius square box around him. There were still signs of his divine power being pushed back.

“How is this possible?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. “There should not be anyone in this Heaven and Earth who possesses a stronger divine power than me. What is the grey power that she just used? Even though it is not as powerful as mine, it still completely suppressed my divine power.”

Suppression in terms of divine power.

This was the first time Jian Wushuang had encountered this situation after he had broken through into the Ultimate Phase of the Seventh Step Inverse Cultivation.

“Poisonous Dragon!”

Leng Ruxue said softly.

Instantly, the silver mist that filled Heaven and Earth started to gather and form a gigantic silver dragon. This dragon was tens of thousands of feet long and it covered the entire sky. It exhaled a cloud of silver mist before attacking Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang gripped the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands tightly.

He dashed.

A sword light was seen within the grey mist. It was like the first light of day as it lit up the world. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The sword light hit the grey dragon as it tore the dragon into half. The grey mist then saturated the air again.

“You simply suppressed my divine power. It does not affect my fighting power.” Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Ruxue coldly.

“If one Poisonous Dragon cannot hurt you, how about ten?” Leng Ruxue said with a low voice.

Instantly, the grey mist started to twirl again as more similar grey dragons were formed.

This time, there were ten of these grey dragons.

These ten dragons brandished their claws as they attacked Jian Wushuang from all directions.

Jian Wushuang was not afraid. His figure flashed again as he left eerie shadows in the air.

Even though these Poisonous Dragon were extremely powerful, they travelled too slowly.

Jian Wushuang dashed around the battlefield in a weird way before appearing in front of the grey dragons. He swung his Blood Mountain Sword at it once again.

Ten sword lights appeared and struck the Poisonous Dragons at the same time.

The ten grey Poisonous Dragons dissipated instantly.

“Your attacks are really stylish. However, they’re useless against me.” Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Ruxue and said coldly.

“Is that the case? Do you really think that my Poisonous Dragons are so simple?” Leng Ruxue replied.

Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows tightly. He had a bad feeling about what was going to happen.

He then noticed the changes in his divine body.

“This is poison!”

He could clearly feel that a large amount of the grey mist entered his body through his pores.

This grey mist had come about after the grey Poisonous Dragons dissipated. Jian Wushuang had been at the centre of where all of the dragons had dissipated, hence the grey mist would come in contact with him. Under normal circumstances, the divine power around his body should have stopped the grey mist from entering his body.

In reality, it had not.

The grey mist was incredibly powerful. It ignored the protection from the divine power around Jian Wushuang’s body before it started to corrode everything within Jian Wushuang easily.

“What a terrifying poison! It corrodes my divine power and my internal organs. It can even corrode my soul!” Jian Wushuang turned pale.
