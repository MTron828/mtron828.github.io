Chapter 1998: Challenge Yan Zun!

“The b*stard Yan Zun killed my husband and my daughter. I am dying to drink his blood and eat his flesh!!” Emperor God Han Ye sounded extremely cold and brutal.

The hatred between her and Yan Zun was too profound.

It was a pity that she wasn’t powerful enough and she couldn’t take revenge. However, with any chance that she got, she would try to fight Yan Zun.

Even if it meant only embarrassing Yan Zun, it was enough for her to pay a great price to get it done.

That was hatred!

“I can promise you that I will find Yan Zun and vent your anger on your behalf,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Thank you, Sword Emperor,” Emperor God Han Ye was surprised.

“Wait for me here,” Jian Wushuang said. Then, he turned and left to find Yan Zun.

There were many regions on the boundless ancient battlefield that had yet to be discovered.

In the void above the ancient battlefield, where the space gap was at.

Vroom. There were lofty palaces and pavilions towering in the sky that formed rolling buildings.

The buildings were built by Sanctuary Alliance on the ancient battlefield.

There were countless experts from Sanctuary Alliance that wandered on the ancient battlefield. They needed a place to rest too. Hence, Sanctuary Alliance built a bunch of buildings there.

There were many experts in Sanctuary Alliance who would return to the buildings when they were tired from exploring the ancient battlefields.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang arrived before the buildings.

“Yan Zun!”

Jian Wushuang’s loud and bright voice reverberated across the sky.

There were many experts from Sanctuary Alliance in the buildings who heard the voice. Of course, that included Yan Zun.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures that plunged out from the buildings in the first instant.

Besides Yan Zun, there was another tall and sturdy middle-aged man in golden armor.

“Oh, Great Emperor Tian Yue is here too?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the tall and sturdy middle-aged man in golden armor.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were thirteen Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance. Among the thirteen Great Emperors, there were ten of them who were masters of a sanctuary.

Great Emperor Tian Yue was the master of Sky Mountain Sanctuary.

His power should be below average standard among all Great Emperors.

“Oh, it’s Sword Emperor.”

Both Yan Zun and Great Emperor Tian Yue looked surprised when they saw Jian Wushuang.

Both of them also noticed Jian Wushuang’s Sir God aura and they knew that Jian Wushuang had broken through.

“I wonder why Sword Emperor is looking me for?” Yan Zun smiled and asked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang and he did not share any resentment. Even before Jian Wushuang grew strong, he had never revealed any murderous intention to Jian Wushuang.

Hence, he wasn’t worried that Jian Wushuang would do anything to him.

Jian Wushuang smiled and replied, “Yan Zun, as you can see, I just broke through and I have yet to determine my power accurately. Hence, I came to look for Yan Zun to challenge you.”

“Challenge?” Yan Zun was shocked. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In Eternal Chaotic World, it was normal that cultivators would challenge one another.

However, when one’s power reached the Great Emperor level, they cared about their position and status. Hence, they wouldn’t fight easily. They wouldn’t take the initiative to challenge one another if there wasn’t a reason behind it as well.

However, Jian Wushuang…

Although Yan Zun was confused, he replied with a smile, “If so, let’s find an independent space to fight a hearty battle then.”

“Independent space? There’s no need to. The ancient battlefield is so huge. We can just fight nearby,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Such a joke. He came to find trouble intentionally so that Yan Zun would be embarrassed. If they were to fight in an independent space, there would only be the two of them but no other spectator. Even if Yan Zun were defeated, it wouldn’t affect his reputation.

“Here?” Yan Zun creased his eyebrows and he found it weird.

“Yan Zun, get ready. I am going to fight now,” Jian Wushuang flashed a malicious smile and he moved.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang was like a ghost. He disappeared and reappeared before Yan Zun.

He already withdrew Blood Mountain Sword on his back.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle…”

Buzz!

The sword light slashed and it was as though it contained a full reincarnation cycle. Jian Wushuang exploded his divine power and ancient tribe bloodline power to his extreme limit.

The stroke was enough to split heaven and earth.

“What is Jian Wushuang trying to do? He challenged me out of nowhere and he didn’t want to go into independent space either.”

“Regardless of what his intention is, as he wants to fight, I will fight a battle with him. He is alone, after all. Even if he has already broken through, he is at most one with the fighting power of a Great Emperor. I can easily deal with him.”

“I will dismiss him after a short fight.”

Yan Zun was still trying to figure out Jian Wushuang’s intention and was in deep thought. When Jian Wushuang appeared before him and slashed, only then he came back to reality.

“This stroke…”

Yan Zun’s face changed. He flipped his hand and there was a red battle-ax.

The battle-ax contained a fiery flame and he suddenly slammed it down.

Hong!

That stroke seemed to have the power to burn every living thing in the universe.

Although Yan Zun was at the bottom among all Great Emperors, he was still extraordinarily strong.

However, Just as the red battle-ax collided with Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword.

Buzz!

Yan Zun’s divine body shook and his aura churned. Then, the muscles all over his body flew out like he was lobbing a shell.

Just as the muscles were shot out, his body continued to boil. His body finally stopped after a while.

After he steadied himself, Yan Zun couldn’t help but look at his hands. His right hand was numb and it was aching.

“How is this possible?”Yan Zun was astonished.

He thought Jian Wushuang would at most have the fighting power of an ordinary Great Emperor after a breakthrough.

Although he was at the bottom of all Great Emperors, it shouldn’t be a problem to deal with Jian Wushuang.

But in the end… he was knocked senseless by the stroke that contained terrifying power.

The power contained in the stroke was too powerful.

From that stroke itself, he could tell that Jian Wushuang was absolutely not weaker than him but even stronger than him.

At least, in terms of power and strength, he was far behind Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, Yan Zun, you and I shall fight a hearty battle today!”

Jian Wushuang laughed and raged. His body increased in size and there were extra heads and arms popping out of his body.

A total of nine heads and eighteen arms!!

Nine heads and eighteen arms, Jian Wushuang had already mastered the secret skill entirely.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang took out a token.

The token was a mirror token specially to record this battle.

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang came before Yan Zun again. He waved his eighteen arms and fought at close quarters with Yan Zun.
