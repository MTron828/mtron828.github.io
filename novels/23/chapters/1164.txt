Chapter 1165: Old Acquaintances

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Damn it!”

Both the elegant woman and the middle-aged man were furious.

With their distinguished statuses, they had always stood high above the masses. It was difficult for normal people to even see them.

Now, the old man had beat them up so badly that they fell near such a crowded street.

“What?” The elegant woman’s expression underwent a drastic change.

She lowered her head to look at the crowded street below. She was now hovering in the air and stood less than 10 meters above ground. Most people could see her if they just lifted their heads.

To her surprise, the woman discovered that everyone on the street was so preoccupied with their affairs that they did not notice her.

The crowd ignored her as if she was air.

It was as if they were in another world.

“What… What’s happening?” The middle-aged man’s eyes widened when he noticed the same.

“We’re right here above the street but no one noticed us even after all that commotion. What did he do?” The elegant woman was dumbfounded.

She knew that the pedestrians were neither deaf nor blind. The only possible explanation was that the blind old man had used some powerful skill to temporarily silence their hearing and eyesight. That was why the crowd did not notice them.

What an incredible skill.

She took a deep breath. She came to realize that she had come across an incredibly formidable expert.

“You’re those youngsters’ Elders, aren’t you?” the old man asked coldly as he stood there.

The elegant woman and the middle-aged man finally responded after some hesitation.

“I’m Jian Yu, the Upper Elder of Sword Marquis Mansion.”

“I’m Jian Hua, Sword Marquis of Sword Marquis Mansion.”

“Nice to meet you!”

“So one of you is the Upper Elder and the other is the Sword Marquis.” The blind old man smiled. He pointed at Jian Yu and said, “You look like my old friend from Sword Marquis Mansion. Do you know her?”

“May I know her name?” Jian Yu asked.

“Jian Meng’er,” the blind old man answered.

“Jian Meng’er?” Jian Yu was stunned and a hint of terror flitted across her pupils. “She was my great-grandmother who passed away 2,000 years ago. Senior, are you really her old friend?”

Emotions surged wildly in Jian Yu and Jian Hua.

Jian Meng’er had been one of the most powerful figures in the history of Sword Marquis Mansion. She was also acquainted with the incredible founder of Sword Marquis Mansion, Jian Wushuang. When he disappeared, Jian Meng’er had managed Sword Marquis Mansion on her own.

Though she had been decently talented, the Peak of the Yang Void Realm was all she could achieve. Since she had not reached the Saint Realm, she lived mere hundreds of years. It had been over 2,000 years since her death.

But this blind old man had introduced himself as Jian Meng’er’s old acquaintance.

“This man is an old monster who’s the same age as my great-grandmother?”?Jian Yu was in shock.

Old monster?

That was true!

Jian Wushuang was considered a youngster with a short cultivation age over in the Green Fire World.

But over in the Ancient World, a man more than 2,000 years old was undoubtedly an old monster.

“Your great-grandma and I were old friends. Today, I happened to run into some arrogant juniors from Sword Marquis Mansion.”

The old man snorted. “Sword Marquis Mansion might be influential in the Nanyang Continent now, but don’t you forget that there are countless experts in this world who are capable of destroying Sword Marquis Mansion.”

“I advise you to keep a low profile or you might end up offending some tough enemy!”

“Moreover, you Elders should be monitoring your juniors’ behavior. You can’t let them bully others in the name of Sword Marquis Mansion.”

“Most importantly, never forget your past suffering!”

“Don’t forget that Sword Marquis Mansion was weak once. It owes its influence and prestige today to all its past hardships.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Us members of Sword Marquis Mansion will bear your words in mind,” Jian Yu replied respectfully.

“Well, that’s quite enough. Those words just came to mind.” The blind old man waved his hand. “Besides, I have a manual of swordsmanship with me. Now it’s yours. You can discuss how to utilize it.”

He threw a token and then vanished.

Jian Yu and Jian Hua looked at each other in confusion.

“Upper Elder, who was that?” Jian Hua asked, frowning.

“I have no idea.” Jian Yu shook her head. “He looks like a good man who bears no malice toward Sword Marquis Mansion. Besides, he left us a manual. His words and actions show his dissatisfaction with our current situation. It seems that he’s disappointed with us. Is he really my great-grandmother’s acquaintance?”

“Perhaps. But he reminded me that our rising influence in the Nanyang Continent in recent years has attracted the attention of many forces. Moreover, it’s true that our juniors are increasingly unruly,” the middle-aged man said.

“One of our clansmen had recently slaughtered a faction of Tianzong Dynasty with his men for a woman’s sake but our Elders merely turned a blind eye to this.”

“One of our geniuses assassinated a talent with a higher ranking on the Earthly Dragon List.”

“What the hell are they doing?”

“Why didn’t you bring this up before?” Jian Yu asked in a reproachful tone, her eyes turning razor-sharp.

“I only found out a couple of days ago. Sword Marquis Mansion seems strong and united on the surface but it has been divided into many clans fighting for their own benefits. Though I’m the Sword Marquis, I’m incapable of changing this situation on my own. After all, I have to balance these clans.”

“Those useless fools!” Jian Yu’s voice was terribly cold. “That Elder is right. We’ve been comfortable for so long that many of us have forgotten how we had struggled to become stronger. It seems that we should start cleaning up our act!”

“It’s time for those Elders to learn a lesson or two!”

“I’m too weak to achieve this myself but it’s possible with your support,” Jian Hua replied.
