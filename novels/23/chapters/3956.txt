Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It would be fine if we could block it, but if we can’t, the death of the Divine Beginning Realm is still a small matter. The key is that Blood Sword Master might also die,” another Pavilion Master said with a frown.

To the Nine Emperor Pavilion, they did not care about the life and death of the Divine Beginning Realm.

The only thing they cared about was Jian Wushuang’s life or death.

After all, Jian Wushuang was a real super genius, and his name was already on the Nine Emperor List. If he could grow up in the future, it would be beneficial to the Nine Emperor Pavilion.

“Unfortunately, the Nine Emperor Pavilion does not compete for Ruler and does not participate in the fights between the various forces. Although the Blood Sword Master is on the Nine Emperor List, the Nine Emperor Pavilion will only provide him with some basic help, but we will not help him out of the crisis. Whether he lives or dies in this battle depends on himself.” Ruler Chenyun shook his head secretly.

The Nine Emperor Pavilion would not care about the experts on the nine-emperor list.

Especially the young experts who had not yet grown up.

For example, although the Nine Emperor Pavilion valued geniuses like him, they would not help Jian Wushuang much. Even if Jian Wushuang was in a desperate situation, the Nine Emperor Pavilion would not help him, this was the iron principle of the Nine Emperor Pavilion. After all, there were so many geniuses on the Nine Emperor List. If the Nine Emperor Pavilion helped anyone who was threatened, the Nine Emperor Pavilion would pay too much and would not be able to handle it.

Moreover, the path of cultivation could not be smooth sailing. Anyone who wanted to become a top expert had to go through trials and tribulations.

The Nine Emperor Pavilion was willing to see the genius experts on the Nine Emperor List meet with danger, because in the eyes of the Nine Emperor Pavilion, these dangers were just some tempering.

Only experts who could truly grow through the tempering and reach the top level of the universe were qualified to ask the Nine Emperor Pavilion to help them.

The current Jian Wushuang was still far from that level.

“I hope Blood Sword Master can survive this time,” Ruler Chenyun thought.

The ancient and huge universe boat appeared in the void at the edge of the Divine Beginning Realm. Hundreds of thousands of cultivators in the Divine Beginning Realm looked at the ancient universe boat with serious expressions.

“Finally, it’s here.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, and there was a fierce gleam in the depths of his eyes.

His wife, Leng Rushuang, stood beside him. Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and the Heaven Ancestor stood beside Jian Wushuang as well. There were many high-level experts in the Divine Beginning Realm, looking at the ancient universe boat in front of them, their expressions were solemn, and their hearts were slightly trembling.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. The ancient universe boat finally came to a complete stop in the dark void. Then, countless figures rushed out of the universe boat like wasps.

These people were the great beings under the command of Devil Cloud Star, and they were all Principles Masters. As for the number, it was much less than the Divine Beginning Realm’s camp, which only had 100,000 people.

However, although the Principles Masters in the Devil Cloud Star Army could not be compared with the Divine Beginning Realm’s camp in terms of numbers, these Principles Masters of Devil Cloud Star were all wearing the same black armor, and even the godly weapons in their hands…they were all the same standard divine weapons, and their auras were all magnificent and tyrannical.

100,000 Principles Masters were at least at the peak of the void fifth level, and more than half of them were at the void sixth level.

In terms of quality, these Principles Masters in the Devil Cloud Star Army were much stronger than the Principles Masters in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Although the Divine Beginning Realm had an army of 700,000 Principles Masters, forming an army formation of seven people with 100,000 people, the strength of these 700,000 people was uneven. Even though there were quite a number of void sixth level Principles Masters among them…in terms of numbers, however, they were not as many as Devil Cloud Star’s side.

This was merely a simple comparison of numbers and quality. However, in a real battle, the coordination of the army, the degree of tacit understanding, and all sorts of methods were the key to victory.

Although the Divine Beginning Realm’s side had an army of 700,000 people, if they really wanted to fight against the army of 100,000 Principles Masters from Devil Cloud Star, they might not have the confidence to win completely.

Suddenly…

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

More than 100 streams of light rushed out of the ancient universe boat and appeared at the front of the army of 100,000 Principles Masters.

These streams of light were the Ruler-level experts of the Devil Cloud Star Camp. There were more than 100 of them, led by Devil Cloud Star Master and Shi Hua Divine Emperor.

“Is he Devil Cloud Star Master?” Jian Wushuang stared at the most conspicuous person in the crowd.

It was a middle-aged man who looked extremely elegant. He stood at the front of the army with his hands behind his back. There was a smile on his face, and a faint golden light appeared in his eyes, he gave off an extremely demonic feeling.

The root of the war was Devil Cloud Master, and also the true source of the disaster in the Divine Beginning Realm.

“Devil Cloud Master looks very ordinary. He doesn’t look very scary. I can’t sense his aura.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

He knew that the more ordinary Devil Cloud Star Master looked, the more extraordinary he was.

“The man in purple armor next to him should be Shi Hua Divine Emperor?” Jian Wushuang looked at Shi Hua Divine Emperor again.

They were both fourth-level Rulers, so Jian Wushuang did not dare to underestimate Shi Hua Divine Emperor.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed, and his eyes immediately locked onto a Ruler behind Devil Cloud Star Master.

“Ruler Starfall.” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted, and a trace of sharpness flashed in his eyes.

He knew Ruler Starfall, but he had never seen the Sorcerer God’s real body, so he could not recognize him. However, Daoist Xuan God and the others immediately recognized him.

“It’s the Sorcerer God?”

“The Sorcerer God is very cunning. When the three Saint Realms were destroyed, the three masters of the Saint Realm were killed, but the Sorcerer God fled far away. We have been looking for him all these years, but we haven’t been able to find him. We really don’t know where he has been hiding all these years.”

Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, and the others looked at the Sorcerer God with killing intent in their eyes.

“Haha! I didn’t expect you to reach such a level in such a short time. Jian Wushuang, you really surprised me.” A hearty laughter suddenly sounded.

The faint golden light in the eyes of the Devil Cloud Star Master suddenly became more dazzling, making him look even more evil.

“Devil Cloud Master, this should be the first time I’ve seen your real body. Moreover, I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time,” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.

“I’ve been looking forward to meeting you, Jian Wushuang. After all, you’re the most powerful genius I’ve ever met in my cultivation. Even your master, Xuan Yi, can’t compare to you in terms of talent and potential,” Devil Cloud Master sneered.
