Chapter 3069: Clamp

——

“Are you just a guest?” Iceberg’s expression was cold.

Soon, Bai Xiao had brought Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo out.

When he saw the experts standing in front of him, even though Jian Wushuang was prepared, he was still a little surprised.

“There’s actually a Principles Master here?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with surprise.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, let me introduce you. This is the current Sect Master of the Young Divine Sect, Sect Master Si Lan,” Bai Xiao introduced.

“Sect Master Si Lan.” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly to the middle-aged man in a loose robe.

“Get up.” Sect Master Si Lan smiled faintly. “Since you’re a guest of the Young Divine Sect, there’s no need to be so polite.”

“This is my master, the famous Sword Saint Iceberg of the Divine Beginning World. He’s invincible among the Immortal Saints,” Bai Xiao introduced.

Jian Wwushuang immediately looked at Iceberg.

He was dressed in a white robe, and his aura was as cold as an ice mountain.

Jian Wushuang felt a vague sword essence from Iceberg, which was so strong that it made his heart palpitate.

According to Bai Xiao’s introduction, Iceberg was nicknamed Sword Saint Iceberg, and he was an Invincible Immortal Saint. With such great strength, his swordsmanship must have reached the peak. He was not sure about other things! However, Jian Wushuang knew that Sword Saint Iceberg must have reached the third stage of sword principle, and his sword essence could evolve into all things!

“Greetings, Master Iceberg.” Jian Wushuang also bowed respectfully.

“Yes.” Iceberg nodded slightly, appearing very cold.

“And this one.” Bai Xiao spoke again, but his voice became obviously excited. “This is Master Bai Jue. Master Bai Jue is one of the higher-ups of our Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. He is a great Principles Master!”

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the white-haired Elder Bai Jue.

Just like when he met Mo Shan, Bai Jue gave him the feeling that he was not in this space-time. His aura was also very strange.

However, it was this strange feeling that made Jian Wushuang extremely shocked.

Principles Master was a super expert who stood at the top of the third heaven. Although Jian Wushuang’s combat strength was good, he was still far from being a Principles Master. Facing Principles Master head-on…even Jian Wushuang was a little afraid.

“Greetings, Master Bai Jue,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

“You’re welcome, young man.” Bai Jue smiled calmly, and Jian Wushuang immediately felt relieved.

“Heavenly Marquis Jian, I heard that you have good talent in sword principle. Three days ago, you fought with my disciple Bai Xiao and defeated him with only one sword. Is that true?” Iceberg looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Although my disciple’s talent in sword principle is not the best, he is still outstanding. However, he can’t even take one of your sword moves. This makes me very curious. How about this, you can show me that sword move again,” Iceberg said seriously.

“I’ll show you?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The people around him were also very strange.

No matter how powerful Jian Wushuang was, Iceberg was an invincible existence among the Immortal Saints.

How could Jian Wushuang be qualified to fight with such an expert?

“Don’t worry, I just want to see your swordsmanship. I don’t really want to fight with you,” Iceberg said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang felt relieved, but then his eyes lit up.

An invincible expert who was good at sword principle and an Immortal Saint was standing in front of him, wanting to see his swordsmanship.

This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you don’t have to be afraid. As your master, I won’t hurt you. You just need to display the sword move that defeated me,” Bai Xiao said.

“In that case, please enlighten me.” Jian Wushuang took out the Blood Mountain Sword with a flip of his hand.

The surrounding people immediately gave way to a battleground.

“Let’s fight.” Iceberg stood there coldly and his voice was very cold.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and moved in the next moment.

Buzz! Buzz! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Many strange figures suddenly burst out.

At this moment, hundreds and thousands of ‘Jian Wushuang’ appeared in the world. These ‘Jian Wushuang’ were space-time phantoms.

After the phantoms burst out at the same time, Jian Wushuang suddenly took a step forward, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand fell straight down.

Wushuang Sword Manual…Life and death moment!

In just a moment, in a moment, Jian Wushuang had already performed a killing move.

A sword shadow flashed and then disappeared.

Clang!

A sound like the collision of metals was heard, and then the whole world became quiet.

The experts on the field had their eyes fixed on the center of the void. Sword Saint Iceberg, who was as cold as an ice mountain, was still standing there. He did not draw his sword, and one of his hands was behind his back, as for the other hand, it had already reached out, and on two of the fingers of the hand, majestic divine power gathered. It was holding a cold and sharp longsword.

This sword was the Blood Mountain Sword!

“What?”

Jian Wushuang widened his eyes and looked at Iceberg in astonishment.

He had long known that Iceberg was ridiculously strong, and his understanding of sword principle must be much higher than his.

But he did not expect Iceberg to be so strong.

In the instant of life and death in the unparalleled sword manual he created, this move was so fast that ordinary experts could not react in time. Of course, with Iceberg’s strength, he could react in time, but the way he blocked the sword…it was really hard to accept.

He actually used two of his fingers to directly clamp the Blood Mountain Sword!

Jian Wushuang had been cultivating in this life and had encountered many people who were stronger than him. However, this was the first time someone had used two fingers to directly clamp his Blood Mountain Sword.

The difference in strength was too great.

“Your sword is indeed good.” Iceberg’s expression was still cold, and his eyes did not contain any emotion as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!” Jian Wushuang snorted. With a thought, a shocking evil aura suddenly burst out from the Blood Mountain Sword.

Buzz!

The Blood Mountain Sword shook violently, and a shrill sword hum echoed in the world. Then the Blood Mountain Sword began to struggle crazily under Iceberg’s two fingers.

“Oh?”

Iceberg raised his eyebrows. He looked at the Blood Mountain Sword in surprise, but then he flicked his finger.
