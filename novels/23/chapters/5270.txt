Chapter 5269: MO Long Has Fallen

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Outside Qiuhuang City.

The bloody battle continued!

The towering divine statue was engulfed by the Devouring Demons, countless people fought desperately atop the city walls.

In that moment, the sky turned blood red.

The Transcendent Immortal Array emitted boundless power, an unmatched aura.

On the city walls, every Grand Yan Immortal fought for their lives.

Buzz!

A figure emitting a faint golden light shot up into the sky, wearing a high crown and a majestic expression.

It was Emperor MO Long.

“Burn the divine boody!’

The originally 1,000-fold divine body instantly soared to 3,000-fold, origin source and divine body burning together, pushing his strength close to that of a Dao Lord.

A godly fist shaking the heavens and earth smashed toward the Devouring Demon.

Thousands of Devouring Demons were sent flying, granting a momentary respite to the hundreds of people behind him, but it was only a breath; the next moment, the tide of Devouring Demons surged back.

Emperor MO Long was once again submerged in the sea of demons, his golden body covered by the black ocean.

Among the ten generals, the first to fall was Emperor MO Long.

The stronger the force he unleashed, the more it attracted the frenzied attacks of the Devouring Demons. Surrounded by hundreds of thousands of 3-Star Devouring Demons, even when he unleashed the power of a Dao Lord in his final moments, he was still consumed to death.

Originally, the hundreds of top-level Grand Yan Immortals who followed MO Long witnessed the tragic scene before them. They exerted all their remaining strength, desperately resisting, hoping to hold on until Si Tian’s rescue.

Swish!

Blood claws tore through the sky, shattering everything in their path.

“Hurry, someone hold this position!” Si Tian roared.

Several half-step Dao Lords quickly filled the gaps, as if no one had fallen here before.

The Devouring Demons’ corpses were torn apart and devoured by the sword formation, and the flesh of the Grand Yan Immortals was absorbed by the Devouring Demons.

Although the battlefield was crowded with countless warriors, towards the end, there was no need to clean up the battlefield at all. It was even cleaner than before. However, beneath Qiuhuang City, numerous deep abysses appeared.

Ten generals fell in succession, and the remaining top-level Grand Yan Immortals were completely powerless to resist.

A 3-Star Devouring Demon was equivalent to a top-level Grand Yan Immortal.

After devouring a Grand Yan Immortal, their strength skyrocketed. Some 3-Star Devouring Demons, after absorbing a Grand Yan Immortal, instantly advanced to become 4-Star Devouring Demons.

One peak-level and at most a dozen other top-level Grand Yan Immortals. Once the number of opponents exceeded 100, the risk of falling became imminent.

Now, there were over 10,000 Grand Yan Immortals on the city walls, each person having to deal with more than 200 Devouring Demons on average.

However, among the 10,000, only a few thousand were peak-level Grand Yan Immortals. The majority were just top-level tier Grand Yan Immortals, on par with the Devouring Demons. They were utterly incapable of resisting.

While Si Tian was rescuing others, he kept an eye on Jian Wushuang.

“Do something useful! You’ve exchanged for the Candle Dragon Wings, you’ve been given everything, but you’re not doing anything!’

Si Tian felt conflicted, even a hint of regret seeping in. If he had sold the Candle Dragon Claw on his body to Jian Wushuang back then, would the situation be a bit better now?

Once the city fell, they would all have squandered their opportunities.

But to give away a treasure!

Si Tian gritted his teeth!

He didn’t regret it. Losing this treasure meant his combat power decreased by at least one level. He couldn’t even maintain Dao Lord status anymore. Even if Jian Wushuang was strong, what could he do?

What if he could pierce through the ninth wave?

In the end, someone else would benefit!

Thinking this, Si Tian remained resolute, Even if Jian Wushuang was useless, it had nothing to do with him. If he had the ability, he should have killed him in the first stage. He had nothing more to say.

The carnage on the city walls surpassed Jian Wushuang’s imagination.

The Devouring Demons of the ninth wave were much fiercer than he imagined.

Although their numbers were only ten times more than the eighth wave, the difficulty was not tenfold but a hundredfold or even a 1,000-fold greater.

During the eighth wave attack, he could attract tens of thousands, and the rest didn’t even bother attacking him, directly assaulting the city walls.

Of course, he had the thought of preserving his strength at that time. Now, facing tens of millions of Devouring Demons, he had been forced into this situation.

Even his Dharma figure was on the verge of collapse!

These Devouring Demons were like rats, gnawing at an ancient and enormous crocodile.

One or two couldn’t break the defense, but under the combined force of millions, even Jian Wushuangs Demonic Annihilation Armor, an Innate Treasure, started showing tiny cracks.

This was an Innate Treasure that Grand Yan Immortals couldn’t damage. Even Emperors would find it difficult, yet it was now being gnawed by these rats.

“Transcendent Immortal Formation!”

Jian Wushuang’s mind moved. He no longer dared to be arrogant, directly retracting the Transcendent Immortal Formation, protecting himself and dispersing the approaching Devouring Demons.

“You’ve used everything! I’ve exchanged even the Candle Dragon Wings for you. I’ve given you everything. You better do something now! ”

He recalled the sword formation, but on the city wall, the slaughter was overwhelming.

With the sword formation, the 20,000 Grand Yan Immortals had struggled to resist, sustaining significant losses, while the Devouring Demon continued to pour in without end.

Now without the support of the sword formation, they were utterly defenseless, retreating all the way to the edge of the barrier, their faces etched with despair.

“Jian Wushuang!’

Screams for help echoed from Si Tian, but he couldn’t stop the onslaught. He, once a primeval deity atop the ancient seas, couldn’t engulf this wave of darkness. He could only watch as the Devouring Demons surged past him.

“Damn it!!!”

Apart from him, the other four leaders also gave up the struggle.

They knew there was no hope.

19 waves of Devouring Demons, and they faltered at the 9th.

It was over; they were utterly finished.

Even if the barrier broke, they had to exterminate these Devouring Demons. “Everyone, gather together, huddle up, save yourselves!”

The remaining few thousand gathered, some even began to retreat from the city wall, slowly wearing down the Devouring Demons from the periphery.

Although this mission was a failure, they could still gain treasure points; they had to cut their losses!

For those peak-level Grand Yan Immortals, and even the top-level Grand Yan Immortals who had survived through luck, they could barely hold out until the 9th wave. Now, it was better to give up. They all breathed a sigh of relief. If Si Tian hadn’t been vigilantly watching, many of them would have fled.

His gaze was malevolent as he observed them. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He truly wished to throw all these people into the midst of the Devouring Demons.

“They’re all useless!”

The Devouring Demons’ frenzy devoured, and the barrier could withstand at most a breath’s time. When it broke, they would lose all hope.

But the remaining Devouring Demons wouldn’t disappear; they had to be killed.

If they failed, Jian Wushuang would probably go insane. At that time, they would watch him send them to their deaths and suffer the same fate in the end.

They were afraid too!

But there was no way out, they couldn’t block them; it was unstoppable!

They had already anticipated these people would collapse, but Jian Wushuang didn’t expect them to crumble so quickly. It took just a breath, and the defense line was shattered.

Some died, some were injured.

These people couldn’t be relied upon; he had known this for a long time, but he hadn’t expected them to be this unreliable.

He dared not imagine how the other city walls were holding up.

What he didn’t know was that the other city walls were in much better shape than his current situation.

Hu Qing and Wan Xing had already concluded their defense.

The remaining south city wall, under the command of Xue Yue and Dao Lord Leng Shuang, they were barely able too hold on..
