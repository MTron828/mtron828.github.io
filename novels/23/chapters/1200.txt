Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The participants will all be equipped with the strongest magic weapons and rewarded with a drop of Ancient God Power?” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes.

Green Fire Palace was being generous indeed!

“It’s easy to gather those magic weapons since there’s an abundance in the Fire Points Exchange Office but are there so many drops of the Ancient God Power available?” he asked in shock.

After all, all the Dao Masters in the Green Fire World would be gathered for the war. It would be quite a stunning number.

If each of them was rewarded with a drop of Ancient God Power, they would need at least ten thousand or even hundreds of thousands of it.

Even a single drop of the Ancient God Power was invaluable in the Eternal Chaotic World. Did Green Fire Palace have so many?

Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master looked at each other and smiled.

“To be honest, we accumulated many drops of Ancient God Power.” Void Temple Master smiled. “Never mind ten thousand, we can even afford hundreds of thousands of drops of it. Since they’re precious, we typically don’t use them. We’ve been saving them for such battles.”

Jian Wushuang gasped with surprise.

Inside him, Gu King growled. “How can they afford hundreds of thousands of drops of Ancient God Power? How? It’s difficult to form even a single drop! Besides the Ancient God Clan in the Eternal Chaotic World, who can provide so many drops of the power?”

“What on earth happened on this battlefield? Why are there so many drops of Ancient God Powerhere?”

“Did plenty of Ancient Gods die here?”

Gu King was quite surprised and puzzled.

Jian Wushuang sighed deeply.

It was no wonder that Samsara Temple Master thought that Green Fire Palace stood a 10 percent chance of success.

There were the high-realm experts in the Green Fire World, battle formations, the Battle Fortress, as well as the Puppet Fighter that can counter the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom for a short time.

Coupled that with all resources of Green Fire Palace, they did indeed stand a 10 percent of victory.

“We’ll be helping our experts improve their battle strength at all costs. Then, it’s up to them how they’ll prepare for the war.” Samsara Temple Master sighed.

The great war was imminent and Green Fire Palace would do its best to prepare for it.

They would try and improve the battle strength of Green Fire World at all costs.

Meanwhile, everyone in the Green Fire World was stunned after receiving the message from Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master.

Every expert and faction in the Green Fire World began actively preparing for the war.

Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master had made it clear how crucial this war was. This war would determine the destiny of the Green Fire World. If the Green Fire World collapsed, they would all die!

There was no plan B in this war!

This would be a desperate fight for survival!

They had no choice but to risk their lives to strive for the survival of the Green Fire World.

Over in Tang of the East in the Void Continent.

The ruler of Tang was still Emperor Xiao.

He had immediately received Tang Emperor’s command.

“Experts above the Dao Master level—be it the Mansion Masters of the 36 prefectures, experts of all clans, or solitary experts within Tang of the East—should settle their affairs and gather in Green Fire Palace in a year’s time!”

Tang of the East, as the largest country in the Void Continent, boasted a vast territory.

It took an enormous force to manage such a large country.

Yet, Tang Emperor had demanded all experts over Dao Master level in the country to head to Green Fire Palace.

Without Dao Masters playing deterrence in Tang of the East, the country would be a complete mess. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This fact was clear to both Tang Emperor and Emperor Xiao.

Even so, Tang Emperor still gave his order.

Emperor Xiao also implemented it without hesitation.

“Hurry! Dao Masters, settle your affairs immediately and gather in the imperial palace in a year’s time! Those who violate my order will be killed!”

Emperor Xiao’s order was decisive. No one in the country dared to disobey him.

Thus, all experts above the Dao Master level began to make their preparations.

Within a year, they were all gathered in the imperial palace and left for Green Fire Palace under Emperor Xiao’s leadership.

The experts over the Dao Master level of the four top clans—Ancient Monster Clan, Blood Asura Clan, Python Clan, and Blood Phoenix Clan—were gathered in the Samsara Continent.

There were nearly a thousand of them hovering in the air, led by the leaders of the four top clans.

Some of the experts that had gone into seclusion were also present.

“The 266 Dao Masters and three Celestial Masters of our Ancient Monster Clan all here for the war!” Celestial Master Ku Xin said in a booming voice. His eyes were cold and grim.

“The 241 Dao Masters and four Celestial Masters of our Blood Asura Clan are all here! ” The voice of Upper Elder of the clan, Su Qian, reverberated in the air. He was also the Teacher of Asura Lord, Su Rou.

“We’re the Python Clan. Aside from a Dao Master who has taken 100 of our young clansmen into seclusion, all experts over Dao Master level all here!” the leader of Python Clan said.

“The whole Blood Phoenix Clan is here except for one Dao Master!” the leader of Blood Phoenix Clan said.

“The only distinction in this war is between the Green Fire World and the Jin Kingdom. Please bear that in mind.” Ku Xin gave them a reminder.

The four top clans had engaged in never-ending conflicts, be it in the open or in secret, and even got into killing battles. However, they were now thoroughly united.

This was all for the Green Fire World!

“Go!”

With Ku Xin’s order, the Celestial and Dao Masters of the four top clans immediately set off for Green Fire Palace.

The solitary experts on the Green Fire World also received the message about the war.

Inside a grand castle.

10 Protectors kneeled in front of Empyrean Patriarch with reverence.

“I’ve always acted alone, away from anyone’s influence or control.”

“Green Fire Palace had repeatedly invited me but I turned it all down. But I can’t say no this time!”

“When the Jin Kingdom experts arrive in 80 years, the entire Green Fire World will have to fight desperately or collapse forever. This is no other choice!”

“This war will determine the survival of the Green Fire World as well as my own. No cultivator of the Green Fire World will be able to avoid fighting in this war!”

“You’ve served under me for many years. Our chance of success is a mere 10 percent but are you willing to go to Green Fire Palace with me?”

Empyrean Patriarch looked at the 10 Protectors.

“We’re willing to!”

The 10 Protectors nodded as their loud voices resounded.

“Then, let’s go!”
