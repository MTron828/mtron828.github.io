4659 Great Void Divine Emperor Had Died

The clouds and smoke were ethereal, and divine power was vast.

At this moment, only a flesh-colored cauldron remained on the Cangwu Platform that was situated above the entire Rodu.

Behind the furnace, there were thousands of lotus peaks. In the center of the lotus peak, Lu Ding was as warm and gentle as it had been 200 years ago.

However, what was surging around him was no longer a vast divine power, but an unknown power and aura. He looked even more unfathomable.

In this huge hall of the Cangwu Platform, the cauldrons were filled with spiritual movement and exuberant vitality.

For the second time, almost all the Last Flames in the universe was gathered. A total of five million cultivators were thrown into the strange flesh-colored cauldron.

Each and every cultivator’s voice and appearance could be seen in the rising clouds and smoke.

In the 200 years since then, close to 10 million cultivators had died in the flesh-colored furnace.

Looking at the cloud and smoke rising from the furnace, a sinister smile emerged on Lu Ding’s face.

The furnace slowly transformed, and in the blink of an eye, it turned into a pure white body. On the head of the body, a strange face that resembled both men and women slowly grew.

Lu Ding waved his hand and his physical body floated in front of him.

He stood up slowly and walked around the body, admiring it. Then, he cut open the abdomen with his finger.

Dark red blood that was filled with vast divine power gushed out.

That strange body had surpassed the Half Ancestor level, and it was only one step away from the Ancestor level.

“Just one last step, one last step… You’ll have your heart.” With a wave of his hand, he closed the hollow abdomen and put on a long Confucian robe over the body.

At first glance, he actually looked 70 to 80 percent similar to Lu Ding.

At the same time, the main door of the Cangwu Platform’s giant hall slowly opened, and a somewhat haggard-looking Lu Ting strolled into the hall.

He raised his head and glanced at Lu Ding and the strange body, then lowered his head again.

“How is it? Haven’t any of them arrived yet?” Lu Ding said in a deep voice, his eyes unable to hide his anger.

Lu Ting shook his head. “I haven’t received any reply from any sect so far. I’m afraid…”

Lu Ding did not say anything more. He closed his eyes and pondered.

A moment later, he said, “Spread the news that I already know about Jian Wushuang. At the same time, tell them that the Spring of Chaos in Rodu is fluctuating abnormally.”

“What’s wrong?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Taking in a deep breath, Lu Ting said, “In recent years, there have been some bad rumors from the Great Void Temple. They say that you are using the excuse of passing along teachings of the Great Dao to attract countless cultivators to die in order to cultivate your evil path…”

Lu Ding was expressionless as he said, “It’s been 200 years. It’s time for me to go out and take a walk. Second Brother, continue to do as I say. I’ll personally make a trip to the Great Void Temple to retrieve an item.”

Lu Ting nodded and quickly ran out of the giant hall.

A moment later, Lu Ding and the strange body behind him disappeared as well.

“What? There’s news of Jian Wushuang?!”

In the Red Sky Star Field, Feng Qi jumped up from the fiery throne, staring at the messenger of the Qilin clan. “Are you telling the truth?”

The envoy from the Qilin race had a pale expression. Without any hesitation, he nodded his head. “Cosmos God said so himself. At the same time, the Spring of Chaos in Rodu has also begun to fluctuate.”

After asking the envoy some more questions, Feng Qi immediately rushed to the Cangwu Platform.

“Matriarch…” Feng Xiao hesitated, “Aren’t you worried that this news is fake?”

Feng Qi was startled, but then she said firmly, “If he dares to lie to me, I’ll skin him alive even if I die!”

Seeing Feng Qi walk out of the Crimson Sky Hall first, Feng Xiao gritted his teeth and directly led more than 1,000 Supreme martial artists to follow her and head to the Cangwu Platform.

At the same time, the Dragon clan, which had its Heavenly Gate tightly shut, was also opened, with a group led by Long Yan and Long Chi to the Cangwu Platform.

In the dark hall, the sun never shone in.

In a place where the light could barely be seen, a figure dressed in black and gold was sitting quietly.

Behind this figure, there were nearly a hundred other figures.

“I told you to leave. Why didn’t you leave?” Great Void Divine Emperor opened his eyes slowly and said calmly.

An Elder holding a staff took a step forward and cupped his hands. “Your Highness, all the disciples of the Great Void Temple should leave. Those who should die are already dead. The remaining old guys will accompany Your Highness for the last time.”

“Since that’s the case, let’s walk the final path together,” Emperor God Taixu stood up slowly and looked at the figures, ” but before that, you have to help me do one last thing. Warn the dragon clan and Phoenix Clan, as well as the divine Palace of life, not to go to the Cangwu Platform.

“Yes.” The old man cupped his hands in acknowledgment and then disappeared into the sky with nearly a hundred figures.

Looking at the empty hall, Great Void Divine Emperor left and stood outside the Great Void Temple.

For seven consecutive days, it was only when the clouds in the sky had darkened and a giant face that was changing the Great Dao fell that Great Void Divine Emperor opened his eyes slowly.

The clouds collapsed, and the moon and stars shattered. A figure that seemed to have inherited the Heavenly Dao appeared under the giant face.

Immense divine power interweaved with the rules of Great Dao. The moment Lu Ding appeared, Great Void Divine Emperor realized that he was suppressed to the point where he could not move at all.

With the arrival of Lu Ding, his unabashed Ancestor realm aura could almost wipe out an entire dimension with ease.

Behind him stood a strange-looking figure.

Looking at this existence that was already at the peak of cultivation, Great Void Divine Emperor’s expression remained extremely calm, “Aren’t you afraid that Jian Wushuang will come back and settle the score with you in the future?”

Lu Ding walked towards him slowly, a dark look growing in his eyes. “Jian Wushuang? Who the hell was he?! I’m the Savior of the entire Divine Power Universe. Instead of thanking me, you’re all avoiding me?”

Great Void Divine Emperor laughed coldly, “Savior? Don’t you think that it’s very shameless to say that?”

Lu Ding was not angry. He just said coldly, “Say what you want to say. I’ll send you on your way myself later.”

“Do you know what I regret the most? I just didn’t let Jian Wushuang kill you in the last battle.” Great Void Divine Emperor said calmly, “None of them realized it except for me. Although you are from the Divine Power Universe, the energy that is mixed in the divine power you use is the same as Devouring Emperor of the Void Universe.”

Hearing this, Lu Ding chuckled. “You’re smart indeed, but it’s too late.”

After saying that, Lu Ding extended his palm and clenched it in the air. The power of the rules of the Great Dao crushed Great Void Divine Emperor’s heart directly.
