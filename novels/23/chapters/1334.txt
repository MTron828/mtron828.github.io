Chapter 1335: The Poor Confused Guy!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The last round of the battle, also the most important one, was the battle between the Universe Gods in the First Heaven.

All eyes were on the participants from both teams.

Among them there was Jian Wushuang, who deliberately controlled his aura to avoid attention.

Only Lord Wu Cang and Dong Ao were looking at him.

Dong Ao stared at Jian Wushuang angrily, tightly holding his hands. He could accept the fact that he was defeated by Jian Wushuang.

He still believed that he was defeated because of his carelessness over Jian Wushuang’s conscious attack.

“I am now watching how you will be defeated in the battle!” Dong Ao murmured with hatred brewing in his mind.

At the center of the battlefield, twenty talents from the two teams stood side by side.

“See you again Long Hao.”

The voice came from the young man in the black robe. He was the genius in Universe God Palace.

“Lu Qing?” Long Hao was surprised.

“Are you going to invite the insult this time?” The young man in black said to Long Hao, since last Ranked Battle Long Hao was defeated.

“That was the story ten thousand years ago. This time, I will win!” Long Hao said.

“OK, I will wait and see,” Lu Qing snorted.

“Round Three starts!”

The red-haired Elderly announced.

“Go!”

Talents from the two team went through the wormhole and entered into the Mountain Rock World without any hesitation.

The third round had now started.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang went into a forest.

The forest was luxuriant and vibrant.

As he came here, Jian Wushuang started to looked around.

“Long Hao told me to go to the Blood Fire Pinnacle immediately after arriving at the Mountain Rock World, but, where is the Blood Fire Pinnacle?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

And he realized he could only remember fragmented parts in the Mountain Rock World when he watch the precious two rounds. But he couldn’t connect them together and he now had no idea of routes in this Mountain Rock World.

He didn’t even know his own location.

“But I feel that the Blood Fire Pinnacle is in this direction.” And Jian Wushuang followed his intuition.

In the battlefield, everyone was watching the third round.

A participant had already met his opponent and started to fight.

And soon a result was concluded.

One talent from the Snow Dojo was already out! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Well, unfortunately, he met Lu Qing and didn’t even have a chance to escape.”

In terms of overall strength, participants from the Snow Dojo were weaker than those from the Universe God Palace. And now with one out, the Snow Dojo was in a harder situation.

Talents signed for the unfortunate Snow Dojo.

Master of Silence Gloriette seemed worried.

After a day.

The Snow Dojo almost lost its member!

But at the crucial moment Long Hao came here to kill two rivals from the Universe God Palace. Or four talents from the Snow Dojo would die!

But two participants from the Snow Dojo were severely injured, though they didn’t die.

Spectators were holding a heated discussion of the battle.

Until now, two talents from each team were out and two from the Snow Dojo were severely injured.

The Snow Dojo lagged behind.

“Snow Dojo must come up with a solution or it will be doomed to fail!”

“But they cooperate well with each other. All talents from the Snow Dojo are now coming toward the Blood Fire Pinnacle so that they can fight together against their opponents who were alone. There is still hope!”

“Hahaha, look here. Who is that guy carrying a sword? Is he from the Snow Dojo? What is he doing?” Someone found Jian Wushuang and laughed.

And others all started to pay attention to him.

It looked funny.

“Why does he go to the Dark Sea when others were fighting fiercely?”

“The Dark Sea is the margin of the Mountain Rock World. Is he hiding there?”

“Haha, poor guy, he looks confused!”

Everyone was laughing.

Talents from the Universe God Palace laughed recklessly.

But those from the Universe God Palace looked worried and ashamed.

Why did Jian Wushuang go to the Dark Sea when others were fighting fiercely?

“What is happening?!”

Master of Silence Gloriette tightly clenched his hands and looked horribly angry.

All Golden Deacon behind him were also surprised.

Especially Lord Wu Cang. The poor confused guy was exactly like Jian Wushuang!

“What the hell is he doing?” Lord Wu Cang got angry. But after a while he analyzed that maybe Jian Wushuang had lost his way and didn’t know the direction of the Blood Fire Pinnacle.

Suddenly, something occurred to Lord Wu Cang.

“Oh my God!”

He just entered into the Snow Dojo and was unfamiliar with Mountain Rock World. And I forgot to give him a map!

At this moment, Master of Silence Gloriette stared at Lord Wu Cang angrily.

“I hear that it’s you that recommend the guy in the dark sea into the Snow Dojo. Right?” Master of Silence Gloriette asked.

“If we lose this time, I will kill you!” Master of Silence Gloriette told Lord Wu Cang.
