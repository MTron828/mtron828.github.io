Chapter 2649: Escaped

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Those three Grand Ultimate Gods were surprised that an Earth Ultimate God who they had not cared for before ruined their plan. The Earth Ultimate God displayed the Transmigration World which allowed the Scorpion King to destroy the formation.

The most devastating part was the Earth Ultimate God ended up taking the Interspatial Ring containing the Blood Gems away and they could not even chase after him.

After a while...

“Forgive me. Master, please forgive me.”

A purple-robed man fearfully knelt while begging for mercy.

This person was Jin Yihang.

He was afraid of being involved when the war broke out, so he found a mineshaft and hid in it. In the end, he was discovered and brought to face the three Grand Ultimate Gods.

“This person is also from Crimson Stone Fort?” Bai Tu glanced at Jin Yihang and said with his indifferent voice.

“Yes, Master. He’s an inspector from Crimson Stone Fort according to him and is related with Jin Yan, one of the faction leaders in Crimson Stone Fort,” replied a Heaven Ultimate God respectfully.

“Oh, Jin Yan’s man?” Bai Tu raised his brows and glanced at Jin Yihang again before smiling strangely.

Jin Yan was a famous and powerful man in the Crimson Stone Fort as a High-level Grand Ultimate God—much stronger than the Scorpion King or any of them present.

They would have to show Jin Yan some respect if they ever met.

Jin Yihang was a joke in comparison.

“Answer me, who’s Jian Yi? Is he also from Crimson Stone Fort?” Bai Tu asked in a cold voice.

“Jian Yi?” Jin Yihang was stunned but immediately shook his head. “He’s not from Crimson Stone Fort, but the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. His Official Army was guarding the mining sites as those Blood Gems had appeared within his territory.”

“Territorial Lord?” Bai Tu and the other two Grand Ultimate Gods exchanged looks.

They thought Jian Yi was some super genius from the Sacred Palace.

Unexpectedly, Jian Yi was just a territorial lord.

How could a territorial lord be so capable?

“Although Jian Yi is only a territorial lord, he’s extremely talented. He was just a Peak Ultimate God when I first saw him many years ago who then defeated me as a Peak Earth Ultimate God in the end. He became a Peak Earth Ultimate God five years ago and fought evenly against a Heaven Ultimate God from Crimson Stone Fort called Qing Ze at one instance before the Scorpion King had to step in.”

“I am unsure the reason, but Scorpion King had personally shown Jian Yi his masterstroke—Nine Asteroids,” said Jin Yihang.

He spilled all the beans.

“A Peak Ultimate God who defeated a High-level Earth Ultimate God and was appreciated by the Scorpion King to the point he showed Jian Yi his masterstroke.” Gu Ji, Bai Tu, and Li Qianji looked at each other with solemn expressions.

“I can be sure that Jian Yi is indeed a genius. They must have been in contact since the Scorpion King showed his masterstroke to Jian Yi. The Scorpion King might have even persuaded him to join the Sacred Palace. The Scorpion King didn’t hesitate to hand the Interspatial Ring to Jian Yi right before his death and had great confidence in him. Jian Yi will find a way to return it to the Crimson Stone Fort since the Interspatial Ring has fallen into his hands. He’ll most probably hand the ring over to the new Fort Master, Yin Su’er,” said Gu Ji coldly.

“We should never let him return to Crimson Stone Fort!” Bai Tu bellowed in a low voice.

“Hunt him down. Do everything possible to find, kill, and retrieve the Interspatial Ring from him.” Li Qianji was full of murderous intent.

“Do you know Jian Yi’s specific origin or who are his associates?” Gu Ji asked.

Jin Yihang honestly answered their every question.

It did not take long for many experts from the Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect to be sent out. The first place they went was the Territorial Lord Mansion in Northern Darkstar Territory. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

...

A few days later, Jian Wushuang kept his aura undetected while hiding in a cave which he cracked open in the depths of a dense forest at an unknown distance from the Blood Gems mineral vein. He was holding up a Message Token in his hand.

“Xin’er, are you alright?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’m okay.” Xiao Tiexin immediately replied to the message. “I left the Territorial Lord’s Mansion and then disguised myself to leave the Northern Darkstar Territory as soon as I received your message. There were a large number of experts who appeared in the void above the Territorial Lord’s mansion not long after I left. There were only a few maids left in the mansion, so the experts could not get anything and left shortly.”

“Well, where’s the Official Army?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’ve contacted Commander Cang Heng and received news that we didn’t lose many people in the army. They have currently been divided into several small groups and are resting in some deserted areas without rushing to return to their camps,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“The Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect are on the lookout for me. I won’t return to the Northern Darkstar Territory for the time being. The Official Army isn’t a threat, so they should be able to return to their camps after those experts from Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect leave. However, those experts will try to get you and use you as a threat for me to show up since you’re my maid—the person closest to me.”

“You don’t have to go back to Northern Darkstar Territory for now. On the contrary, you shouldn’t show up anywhere for the time being and have to disappear. Do you understand?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Understood.” Xiao Tiexin knew what to do. “Master, you don’t have to worry about me. I’m just a maid after all. The Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect won’t care too much about me. Master, you have to be very careful.”

“I know. I planned to temporarily leave the Northern Darkstar Territory and will only be back when I can confidently face the Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang cut off the transmission after explaining to Xiao Tiexin before sighing in the cave.

“I thought my Northern Darkstar Territory could finally get some peace once the Blood Gems mining was completed. I can then continue to improve my strength the moment Crimson Stone Fort had taken all of those Blood Vems and left. Who would have thought there will be such a big change?” Jian Wushuang shook his head and sighed.

The change had not only affected the Crimson Stone Fort, but also Jian Wushuang and his Official Army. He had no choice but to find a way out for himself.

In the end, he managed to escape but also ran into big trouble.

The experts from Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect had seen the Scorpion King handing over the Interspatial Ring containing all the Blood Gems to Jian Wushuang. Would they let him off so easily?

“Scorpion King...” Jian Wushuang mumbled softly.

Jian Wushuang had a good impression of the Scorpion King.
