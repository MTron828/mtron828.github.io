4907 The Terrifying Cultivation Path

He panted for a moment and continued, “I was alone and wandering in the Heavenly Regions. I happened to come to a Heavenly Region with abundant energy. There, I saw a powerful Yan Immortal who opened a Dao Field and talked about the Dao. I sat down and listened to him. Soon, I was immersed in his discussion.”

“He promised us that as long as we join him, any top cultivator with extraordinary talent will definitely reach the Yan Immortal stage within a year. Even if they aren’t top cultivators, they will develop Immortal Roots within a few years and reach unimaginable heights.”

“During that debate, there were more than 100,000 top cultivators who followed him, and I was one of them.”

“I thought that this was a path with a bright future, but I didn’t expect that this path of cultivation would be beyond redemption.”

Jian Wushuang and the others could roughly guess what was going on.

The person that this apex cultivator was talking about was definitely the black-robed Grand Yan Immortal You Yun. He roamed the Heavenly Regions and opened up a wide Dao Field, attracting wave after wave of top cultivators and even Yan Immortals to follow him.

Then, he brought it to his nest and absorbed the origin to strengthen himself.

The result was just as Jian Wushuang had expected. After You Yun brought them here, he bared his fangs, tied them up, and sucked their Origin. However, the process was ten thousand times crueler.

“After that old dog brought us here, he no longer hid anything. He directly divided us into three, six, and nine grades.”

“The lowest grade, the first grade, has a huge population of tens of thousands. That old dog slaughtered them all and made every cultivator into a Soul Amber, which he distributed to the mid-grade cultivators for them to absorb.”

“After the mid-level cultivators were forced to consume these Soul Ambers, their strength increased rapidly. However, what awaited them were the top-level cultivators.”

“That old dog did the same thing. After slaughtering all the middle-level cultivators, he made Soul Ambers and gave them to the top-level cultivators.”

“As for me, because of my extraordinary talent, I was assigned to the highest level. Every 10,000 years, I have to absorb 100,000 Soul Ambers.”

“During this period of time, my cultivation level increased greatly and I successfully broke through to the Yan Immortal stage. There are more than 50 people in the same situation as me.”

“However, what awaited us was something even crueler. From then on, I knew that even if I became a Yan Immortal, I was just a chess piece.”

His eyes revealed a hint of bitterness. At the same time, his Immortal body was rapidly drying up and was about to die.

“After becoming a Yan Immortal, I thought that I would have the ability to fight him. I didn’t expect that I was still so powerless. All 50 of us were turned into praying mats by him, sucking our Immortal Source day and night.”

“This situation lasted for several years. Those who had their Immortal Sources sucked dry were made into dead Immortal slaves for him to command. They were beyond redemption.”

“In order to not become his slave, I crazily devoured the Immortal Source of the other Yan Immortals and lived until the end. When he left, I also took the opportunity to escape from the cave.”

When he said this, his aura was already weak and gradually dissipated.

Feng Shan said hatefully and then looked coldly at Shu Yang.

“Why are you looking at me? I have never interacted with him before. I just heard about him, ” Shu Yang quickly explained. “Didn’t you see that guy even tried to kill me?”

“Then why are you in the same camp?” Feng Shan asked again. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Shu Yang’s expression was a little awkward, and then he said seriously, “Forgive me for not being able to say anything, but since You Yun dared to attack me, then I want him to die under my spear!”

Feng Shan snorted and stopped talking. In his opinion, even Shu Yang’s full strength could not even compare to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang squatted down slowly and said to the Yan Immortal, “You’ve been tired for so long. It’s time to have a good sleep.”

He forced open his shriveled eyelids and forced a smile, “Thank you, Sir. It’s time to have a good sleep. From the day I found my master’s wife until now, I haven’t had a good sleep. Now, I can finally sleep…”

“What is the name of your sect?” Jian Wushuang asked softly. He had asked this on a whim.

It was as if he was opening up a memory that had been sealed long ago. Finally, he said slowly, “My Lord, it’s called Shangqing Pavilion. It’s located in Qingzhou, a very far away Heavenly Region. The scenery is very good. Master and Mistress are very good to me. It’s a pity that I won’t be able to see them one last time.”

After saying this, the Yan Immortal finally died. His Immortal body that could not hold on anymore turned into a pile of bones and scattered with the wind.

Jian Wushuang’s heart moved slightly, and his originally calm state of mind seemed to recall the past.

That reckless, bold, and meticulous girl had walked out from the Qingzhou and followed Di Qing to Great Mi Heaven.

Her name was Qing Xianchi, the daughter of the Sect Master of the Shangqing Pavilion.

The dead Yan Immortal was also one of the 12 disciples of the Shangqing Pavilion.

Everything seemed to be so coincidental, but it also seemed to be in the unseen world.

Jian Wushuang sighed and saw a finger-sized jade slip in the skeleton.

He raised his hand and picked up the jade slip. He saw that the two words ‘Shu Huan’ were engraved on it. After several years, it was still fresh.

Perhaps this jade letter was the identity of the dead Yan Immortal. When he was enduring the torment, the one that supported him was probably the Shangqing Pavilion where he cultivated in his youth.

Putting the jade slip in his bosom, Jian Wushuang turned around and looked at the dilapidated hall in the deepest part of the mountain range. His gaze was extremely cold.

Rumble!

The hall shattered, and even the entire mountain range could not withstand the power and collapsed.

With Jian Wushuang in the lead, Shu Yang and Feng Shan used all their strength to bombard anything they see.

Feng Shan roared and unleashed a series of extremely violent attacks that easily shattered anything that could be seen.

Jian Wushuang held the Invisible Sword in his hand and walked towards the dark hall at the front step by step.

In front of this pitch-black hall, under the huge and towering pitch-black pine tree, there were more than ten broken Immortal bodies guarding it. As far as the eye could see, the entire place was filled with deathly stillness and desolation.
