4308 Counter-Attack

“This...”

A look of hesitation appeared on the faces of the Supreme martial artists. Just as they were about to get up and chase after the Blood Wave Supreme to persuade him not to be so reckless, an indifferent and ancient voice rang in their ears.

“Just let him be.”

The Supreme martial artists looked at each other and finally nodded. They sighed and said, “Yes. Ruler Gai Fu.”

Outside the Divine Life Palace, Blood Wave Ruler transformed into a streak of light that shot toward the Ancient Path of Stars at full speed!

A moment ago, he was still at the entrance of the Divine Life Palace. In the next moment, he appeared in another star field.

At this moment, the Blood Wave Ruler was directly using his star field leap technique. Every time his figure flickered and leaped, he would cover a distance of hundreds of millions of miles.

However, before he could reach the halfway mark of the Ancient Path of Stars, a giant pitch-black Hand slapped towards him.

“Blood Wave, stay.”

“What?”

The Blood Wave stopped in its tracks. After it casually scattered the giant hand, it stared at the void where the giant hand had slapped.

A dignified middle-aged man wearing a purple-gold Royal robe and a purple-gold crown with flowers, birds, beasts, and insects embroidered on it walked out of the void.

This person was the mysterious and unpredictable Hall Master of Cosmos Temple.

Upon seeing this, the Blood Wave Ruler laughed in anger. “I’m really honored to have the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple personally stop me.”

The Hall Master of the great Cosmos Temple smiled faintly and said, “Hehe, you’re the first seat of the Divine Life Palace. I’m naturally worried about others stopping you, so I have to do it myself.”

When Supreme Blood Wave heard this, there was no fear on his face even when he was facing the Hall Master of the famous Cosmos Temple. His eyes flickered with killing intent as he said, “Hei Yu, are you really going to stop me here?”

The Hall Master of Cosmos Temple stood in the void with his hands behind his back. He shook his head and said, “Blood Wave, give up. You are no match for me. No one can save Jian Wushuang today.”

Supreme Blood Wave’s face remained expressionless, but his heart sank.

He knew that Hei Yu was right. He was indeed not a match for him.

After taking a deep breath, the Blood Wave Supreme looked at the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple coldly and said, “You’ve really gone through a lot of trouble to kill this disciple of mine, who’s only at the ultimate Ruler realm. Not only did you send a Ruler to intercept him, but you, as the Hall Master, even personally came to stop him. You’re truly capable.”

How could the Hall Master of Cosmos Temple not hear the sarcasm in the Blood Wave Supreme’s words? However, he just smiled indifferently and said, “Your Divine Life Palace has already produced a Ninth Kalpa King. You can’t produce another one.”

After a pause, he shook his head and said, “No, according to the strength of the Ninth Kalpa King in the ultimate Ruler realm, compared with Jian Wushuang, I’m afraid that after Jian Wushuang broke through to the Supreme realm, his strength is far superior to the Ninth Kalpa King. Such an existence naturally has to be killed as soon as possible to avoid future trouble.”

Supreme Blood Wave’s expression turned gloomy, and his eyes flickered.

After a short while, the Blood Wave Ruler took a deep breath and said slowly, “Hei Yu, then let’s wait and see. That disciple of mine might not die.”

“Is that so?” The Hall Master of Cosmos Temple laughed indifferently.

The Blood Wave Supreme did not reply. He could only hope that Jian Wushuang could create another miracle and escape from the hands of the Black Eagle Ruler, such as...once again, he used the life-saving magical power he used against Qiu Long.

However, what he did not know was that cosmos temple had already done a detailed investigation on Jian Wushuang, including Jian Wushuang’s divine power decomposition previously. It was also in their hands!

It could be said that they were fully prepared to kill Jian Wushuang!

...

The entrance to the Ancient Path of Stars.

“Jian Wushuang, you won’t be as lucky as last time. No one will come to save you this time.”

The Black Eagle Ruler looked down at Jian Wushuang and sneered with a cruel expression. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Come on, Jian Wushuang. Let me torture you bit by bit. I’ll let you die in pain!”

Black Eagle Ruler sneered and exerted force on his feet. He started to crush Jian Wushuang’s divine body inch by inch, starting from his feet.

Ka ka ka!

Jian Wushuang’s indestructible divine body started to crumble under the stomping of the Black Eagle Ruler.

Furthermore, Black Eagle Ruler controlled his divine power to the extreme. He did not cause Jian Wushuang’s divine body to completely collapse and explode, but he still made Jian Wushuang feel endless pain.

“This Supreme martial artist is so scheming and vicious!”

“What kind of enmity does this person have with Jian Wushuang? To torture Jian Wushuang in such a way!”

“Jian Wushuang’s fate is really full of misfortune. It was not easy for him to kill Qiu Long on the Ancient Path of Stars. I didn’t expect that he would be intercepted by a Supreme once again.”

In the distance, some of the ultimate Rulers watching this shook their heads and sighed.

All of them despised the Black Eagle to the extreme, but none of them dared to say it out loud. They could only shake their heads and sigh.

“Jian Wushuang, do you regret that you should have been killed by me when you were in Nine Glory Star area? Otherwise, why would he be tortured like this?”

The Black Eagle Ruler laughed. However, when he looked at Jian Wushuang, who had remained silent since the beginning, he suddenly felt bored.

Why didn’t he beg for mercy at the moment of his death?

Shouldn’t he be kneeling in front of me and begging me to spare his life?

Shouldn’t he be crying bitterly, feeling despair and regret?

“Hmph! Jian Wushuang, go to hell!”

Black Eagle Ruler snorted coldly as a murderous intent surged in his eyes. He did not plan to delay any longer as he lifted his foot and stomped down on Jian Wushuang’s head!

This kick was aimed at taking Jian Wushuang’s life!

“Now!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and the Wuqi Divine Sword disappeared silently. Boundless darkness surged out from under his body and surged towards the Black Eagle Ruler.

“Eternal night!”

With a low shout, wisps of black mist instantly enveloped the Black Eagle Ruler.

“What is this?”

In an instant, Black Eagle Ruler was dragged into the eternal night Kingdom before he could even utter a single word!

A massive black ball had wrapped itself around the Black Eagle Ruler, and a snatching aura began to take away everything that belonged to the Black Eagle Ruler!

Jian Wushuang took the opportunity to jump up, took out a large amount of divine medicine from his interspatial ring, and swallowed it.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang did not dare to relax at all. He stared at the Black Eagle Ruler, who was wrapped in the black ball, and his divine power was stretched to the extreme.

Jian Wushuang!

An extremely furious roar came from the black ball. The next moment, the eternal night Kingdom started to crack inch by inch!

Like a glass orb, cracks appeared on the surface of the ground. The next moment, the entire eternal night Kingdom collapsed!

The Wuqi Divine Sword wailed and flew back to Jian Wushuang.
