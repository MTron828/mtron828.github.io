Chapter 3967: Jian Wushuang Made His Move

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’m in big trouble!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his body trembling slightly, and his heart filled with shock and anger.

He had never expected that Devil Cloud Star Master not only had a principle true treasure, but also comprehended a trace of the universe principle!

The universe principle, even if a Ruler had comprehended a trace of it, his strength would change dramatically. Moreover, with the universe principle driving the principle true treasure, the power of the principle true treasure could be better displayed.

Jian Wushuang himself had comprehended a trace of the universe principle, and he also had a principle true treasure. He knew very well how much help these two things would bring to his strength.

As a fourth-level Ruler, Devil Cloud Star Master was already at a high level. Although the increase in his strength from these two things would not be too outrageous, it would still reach a whole new level.

At the very least, he had to be at the peak of the fourth-level advanced Ruler, or even barely comparable to the peak of the fourth-level.

No one in the current Divine Beginning Realm camp could contend with such battle strength.

“What should we do?”

“This Devil Cloud Star Master’s power is too strong. It has completely exceeded our expectations. What should we do?”

“He already has the combat power of a fourth-level Ruler. With the addition of a principle true treasure and even comprehending a trace of the universe principles, he can completely slaughter all of us by himself.”

“Could it be that we really can only retreat to the Divine Beginning Realm?”

The experts of the Divine Beginning Realm were very anxious and angry at this moment.

“Husband.” Leng Rushuang glanced at Jian Wushuang and clasped her hands with a hint of worry on her face.

“Don’t worry, leave it to me.” Jian Wushuang gently rubbed Leng Rushuang’s hands and then rushed toward the void ahead.

Seeing Jian Wushuang appear in the battlefield ahead, the experts of the Divine Beginning Realm were stunned, and then a glimmer of hope burned in their eyes.

The strength that Devil Cloud Star Master had displayed was too tyrannical and terrifying. It was so terrifying that they almost despaired.

However, in the eyes of the experts from the Divine Beginning Realm camp, Jian Wushuang was also an absolute legend.

However, the Principles Master had killed a master of the third level before the outbreak of the Great War. He was widely recognized as the number one expert in this Star Field, and there were so many experts who had reached the third level, all of them had submitted to him, and were even his servants.

His strength and his methods were unfathomable to many experts in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Now that he had appeared on the battlefield, perhaps he really had the ability to change the current situation.

Although the hope was very slim, it was still hope.

“My young friend, the Heavenly Marquis.”

Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and the Heaven Ancestor stood side by side. Their eyes were completely locked on Jian Wushuang.

The four of them had been in contact with Jian Wushuang for the longest time. Over the years, they had watched Jian Wushuang grow step by step until his current strength and status.

At the same time, as Jian Wushuang grew, he gave them one shock after another. In their eyes, Jian Wushuang was a monster, a monster, he was even more heaven-defying than Xuan Yi.

Even though the Devil Cloud Star Master had shown his terrifying strength, when Jian Wushuang walked out, they did not know why, but they suddenly felt more confident. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This confidence was their absolute confidence in Jian Wushuang.

Unknowingly, they had already regarded Jian Wushuang as their backbone and the biggest pillar to support the Divine Beginning Realm.

In the entire Divine Beginning Realm, Jian Wushuang was the only one who still had a chance to fight against Devil Cloud Star Master.

“My young friend, I’m counting on you!” The four of them murmured in their hearts.

Jian Wushuang had already arrived beside Devil Flame.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, are you finally going to make a move?” Standing in the void in front of them, Devil Cloud Star Master laughed heartily when he saw Jian Wushuang, but he did not intend to make a move immediately.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Devil Cloud Master coldly and did not say anything.

“Master, I’m useless.” Devil Flame bowed and said.

“Get up. You can’t be blamed for this.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

He did not mean to blame Devil Flame, and it was indeed not Devil Flame’s fault.

Devil Flame had only judged Devil Cloud Master’s approximate strength based on the information he had told him about Devil Cloud Master. He thought that Devil Cloud Master might have just broken through to the fourth-level Ruler not long ago, and that was indeed the case.

Devil Flame had not expected that Devil Cloud Star Master not only had a principle-type true treasure, but had also comprehended a trace of universe principle!

This was simply unbelievable. Jian Wushuang had not thought of it before, so Devil Flame certainly had not thought of it.

“Master, Devil Cloud Star Master is very strong, and he has comprehended a trace of universe principle. He also has a principle supreme treasure suitable for him to use. His battle strength is much stronger than we expected. I said that I was confident of defeating him, but now it seems that it’s a joke. His strength has completely exceeded what I can deal with now. Unless my gold-swallowing divine body can recover to more than 30%, I can’t kill him,” Devil Flame said solemnly.

Jian Wushuang took a look at Devil Flame and nodded slightly.

Devil Flame’s strength was already very impressive. He had only recovered 20% of his divine body and his cultivation was only at the peak of the third-level, but he was able to burst out with the battle strength of the fourth-level. Moreover, his battle strength was extremely strong. It was already very rare.

“Devil Flame, let me ask you. In your current state, if you recklessly use a more powerful killing move, at least it will be able to threaten Devil Cloud Star Master,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well…” Devil Flame frowned, then he said seriously, “Master, I still have a killer move that is extremely powerful, but it’s not easy to use even when I’m at my peak. If I use it in my current state, I can barely use it, but the price is that the 20% gold-swallowing divine body that I recovered will directly collapse and I’ll have to start from scratch.”

“How powerful is this move of yours?” Jian Wushuang looked over.

“With my current strength, the power of this move can reach the peak of the fourth level. Although I’m not sure if I can kill him, at least I can seriously injure him,” Devil Flame said seriously.

“Can I seriously injure him?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes immediately lit up, and at the same time, a plan emerged in his heart.
