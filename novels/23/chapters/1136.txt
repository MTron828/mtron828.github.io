“This is my Message Token, my young friend. Let me know if there is anything I can do for you.” Celestial Master Golden Axe handed Jian Wushuang a Message Token and then took his leave.

“Take care.” Jian Wushuang saw him off.

Now alone, Jian Wushuang turned the Message Token over in his hand with a strange smile on his face.

“Celestial Master Golden Axe sure is a good person. He treats me so warmly though we’ve just met.” He smiled, having had a favorable impression of Golden Axe.

Gu King snorted. “He would’ve died many times over if you put him in the Eternal Chaotic World. He sure is lucky to have survived for several million years in Green Fire Palace.”

“Well…” Jian Wushuang was stupefied.

He knew how cruel this world could be. People like Golden Axe typically would not survive long here, yet Golden Axe became an exception to the rule.

“Putting him aside, I’ve just fought Celestial Master Malignity and learned the true power of the Blaze Quicksand Gourd. I need to find a way to cultivate the Secret Skill concealed in the gourd. Only then will I be able to master the real Blaze Quicksand Realm,” Jian Wushuang murmured. He then returned to his secret chamber and began isolating himself.

Meanwhile, Golden Axe did not travel far away from Jian Wushuang’s mansion before stopping midair.

He glanced at the mansion, a cold and insidious expression taking over his typically amicable face.

“Jian Wushuang… I didn’t expect he’d acquire such an extraordinary treasure after just returning from the battlefield. To think it could even restrict Celestial Master Malignity’s speed. His defense will be enhanced even further with such a treasure. Looks like it’ll be even harder to kill him now!”

“However, hard as it is, there will still be an opportunity. I must be patient, take it slowly, and befriend him first.”

…

Since the World of Swords would not open for another 40 years, Jian Wushuang isolated himself in the secret chamber to cultivate the Secret Skill inside the Blaze Quicksand Gourd.

The abstruse Secret Skill required the use of the Blaze Quicksand Gourd. After studying the skill for a long time, he finally found the method to do so.

He finally mastered the Secret Skill after 31 years.

“I finally made it!”

He opened his eyes, which were filled with joy.

With the cultivation of the Secret Skill complete, he took out the golden gourd and pull out the plug without hesitating. Under his control, the Blaze Quicksand surged out of the gourd.

“Quicksand Realm!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze sharpened as he used the skill.

Then, the madly surging Blaze Quicksand combined in a distinct rhythm and filled the entire secret chamber.

“Whoosh!”

An immaterial Realm was formed.

The Realm was formed entirely out of dense Blaze Quicksand and would focus its pressure in the direction that Jian Wushuang thought of.

“Boom!” The spaceinside the secret chamber erupted under the immense pressure. The pressure was strong enough to cause Celestial Masters to tremble.

“Terrific!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted.

Since he was the master of this Realm, he knew just how strong it was.

He was sure that if he maximized the power of the Realm, it would be enough to crush ordinary Celestial Masters.

He could even grind an advanced Celestial Master into ash with the pressure of the Realm.

Only experts stronger than Celestial Master of the Exceptional Realm could survive the pressure.

Even so, their overall strength would be largely restricted. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Take Celestial Master Malignity for example…

Malignity was the fastest Celestial Master in the entire Green Fire World. However, Jian Wushuang estimated that Malignity could only exert 10 percent of his regular speed at most while trapped in the Quicksand Realm.

Moreover, Malignity could also only exert 30 percent of his full strength at most.

Considering how much Malignity’s strength would be suppressed in a true battle between them, Jian Wushuang was confident of emerging the victor if he used all his might.

“How fearsome! When I was weak, I cultivated several skills that involved the use of Realms but those skills could at mos reduce my opponent’s strength by 10 to 20 percent. I was never able to crush my opponent to death using the Realm’s pressure alone.”

“The pressure of the Quicksand Realm has exceeded all expectations. Since it could reduce the strength of ordinary Celestial Masters of Exceptional Realm by 70 percent, I bet it’ll also affect Universe Masters. With this Realm, anyone weaker than the Exceptional Realm won’t be able to threaten me anymore!”

“Even if a dozen or over a hundred advanced Celestial Masters team up to attack me, nearly no one would be able to escape once I activate the Realm!”

Jian Wushuang sighed emotionally. He had never felt more excited before.

The might of the Blaze Quicksand Gourd was far beyond his imagination.

“It’s still too early to be happy. Mighty as the Quicksand Realm is, it’s only useful against certain Celestial Masters. It’s still not powerful enough to deal with Universe Masters. Of course, once you become a Dao Master and make great breakthroughs in your strength, even Universe Masters won’t be able to belittle your technique,” Gu King said.

Jian Wushuang frowned.

Treasures required the user’s strength to exert their power.

For example, Jian Wushuang had only succeeded in using a Chaos Divine Treasure, the Mountain River Map, once, and it only happened after he engulfed King Luo Zhen’s Essence Blood.

Typically, he would not be able to use the Mountain River Map.

In contrast, Quicksand Realm required less strength from him. Even so, Jian Wushuang was barely able to summon a small portion of the Realm’s power. He would have to enhance his strength to maximize the use of the Realm.

“The Quicksand Realm gives me another trump card. The World of Swords is going to open in nine years… This is a big opportunity that can’t be missed. In the following nine years, I should prepare adequately so I can secure the greatest harvest there.”

Then, he started his preparation for the World of Swords.
