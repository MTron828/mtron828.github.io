Chapter 1056: Terror

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Stop! Stay your hand!”

Angry cries and shoutings arose all around him. The experts of the Council have caught up to them.

All of them could hardly believe the sight of carnage and destruction laid out before them.

“Too fast!”

Everything, from the beginning of Jian Wushuang’s sudden assault to the end of the skirmish when Lin Li was incapacitated beneath the huge boulder, had happened so quickly as the blink of an eye.

Even Lin Li herself had not been able to fully respond to the abrupt onslaught of devastation beset upon her.

Especially when Lin Li, in particular, was a true Holy Master who wielded immense strength herself.

How could a Holy Master of such power and stature fall so easily?

Even though one could factor in the haste of Jian Wushuang’s sudden attack and Lin Li’s overestimation ofher own powers, one matter was invariably definitive: Jian Wushuang’s skills and prowess!

“How could it be possible!”

“Preposterous!”

Despite being crushed under the rock and her life hanging on a thread, Lin Li roared and bellowed vainly.

She had not expected Jian Wushuang would dare strike so swiftly, nor had she knew that Jian Wushuang had such strengths!

Most exclusively that particular stroke…

Not only was the stroke earlier exceptionally powerful, but it also held a secondary charge hidden within.

The hidden charge had surged forth as a secondary force, erupting towards her without any sign or warning and had annihilated her entire arm, cripplingher instantly.

And it was that hidden charge that was the actual terror that had been her undoing.

“With a hundred and twenty years and the abundance of materials for my research, I have finally improved my powers greatly, most notably my mastery of the Coalescence Sword Principle. With all the many different styles of Sword Principles unified as one, I have passed the Universe Level to reach the Creation Level!”

“The powers of the Creation Level is indeed so much more powerful than that of the Universe Level!”

“And as I assimilated the various Sword Principles laid out before me, I have also been searching for any suitable techniques for the Swordplay of Coalescence.”

“The Ruthlessness technique which I had created is strong. But it is too simple and direct. And now, I have this… My new creation, the Bladed Surge!”

“This newly-designed stroke of mine is not only strong. There is a second charge, powerful and destructive in force, hidden in the first stroke!”

“Then again, I have only the Empyrean Patriarch to thank for. It was he who had inspired me to create this technique.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Despite having only endured three blows from the Patriarch himself, Jian Wushuang had vividly remembered all three blows unleashed upon him, especially the second technique.

It was the second technique used by the Patriarch which had held a hidden charge within. It was the hidden charge which had injured him heavily.

And it was this devastating stroke by the Patriarchthat had spurred him to create the Bladed Surge technique.

It was a stroke most savage and yet mystifying. With his mighty strength and Lin Li’s own misjudgment, Jian Wushuang was able to soundly defeat Lin Li.

“What have you more to say, Great Elder Lin Li?” Jian Wushuang looked down at her coldly from atop the huge boulder.

But Lin Li was hardly able to answer as she spewed mouthful after mouthful of blood as she remained trapped under the boulder.

“Release the Great Elder, Jian Wushuang!”

“Please, Jian Wushuang. The Great Elder has no intentions of offending nor infuriating you. Please, stay your hand.”

The Council elders and warriors of the Blood Asura Clan implored him.

“Third Brother.” Su Rou called to him as well. But she had not pleaded mercy from him.

Looking at the surrounding people around him, a thin smile broke upon Jian Wushuang’s face.

He had anticipated that these people would behave and react so.

“It is always the fist that does the talking. No matter where I am in this realm.” Jian Wushuang remarked to himself with an amused expression.

He full well knew that Lin Li was only using him as a pretext to subvert Su Rou’s rule.

But Jian Wushuang himself has no interest to bandy words with Lin Li. Thus he had elected to directly pummel Lin Li into submission.

Action, after all, has always spoken louder than words.

And with his might fully impressed into the minds of the elders of the Council and Lin Li’s life at his fingertips, none of them dared rashly provoke more vengeance from him, staying only at where they stood and urged for clemency. None of them dared to bare their fangs at him no more.

This was the reign of terror upheld by Jian Wushuang.

“I confess that my stay here has indeed given you great dilemma and trouble. Moreover, I have borrowed the use of the resources of your clan. I am willing to repay your kindness with Chaos Gems.”

“But there will be no tolerance towards anyone who intends to use me as a means of realizing their devious schemes.”

Jian Wushuang cast his fiery stare on to the people encompassing around the scene. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“This is, after all, a matter of your own Clan. An internal strife between different factions which, in truth, concerns me not. But now that I have been involved, I will not sit quietly. More so, since the affair matters also my Fourth Sister.”

“Lin Li.”

Jian Wushuang’s icy glare descended upon Lin Li. “By the pleas of my Fourth Sister and the rest of the Blood Asura Clan, I have respectfully addressed you as Great Elder. But do not ever think that any impudence from you will be tolerated when the Upper Elder, Su Qian, who is also the esteemed teacher of my Fourth Sister is absent from the Clan.”

“Anger me, and I will not stay my blade anymore. I have dared to incur the wrath of the Empyrean Patriarch and the Ancient Demon Clan and I will not shy away from infuriating one more. Especially when you hardly wield the strength to subdue me.”

Filled with ominous threats, Jian Wushuang’s thunderous declaration echoed across the skies above the city of the Blood Asura Clan.

Silence lingered dismally over the group of surrounding elders and warriors, as well as the growing band of curious onlookers who have come over to watch.

Every one of them knew full well that Jian Wushuang has spoken nothing but the cold and hard truth.

Crushed under the boulder, Lin Li could neither raise any objections nor could she fight back.

The strength of Jian Wushuang had frightened and tamed her.

A strength that could easily smother the life out of her body.

Jian Wushuang looked once more and studied the crowd around him. A thin smile broke upon his face at the realization that his tactic has succeeding in making a strong impression. He threw a look at Su Rou.

“Fourth Sister.” He called out to her and gave her a knowing look.

Su Rou returned with a faint nod and walked up. “Great Elder Lin Li. With your consent, I will assume control of the Asura Guards.”

With a painful twitch of her mouth, Lin Li opened her mouth to speak. Yet, no sound came from her.

“Does anyone else have anything to say?” Su Rou turned to the rest of the Council.

The rest of the Council shared a look amongst them and ultimately yielded, all of them rushing to bow with respects to Su Rou. “As you command, Your Majesty.”

With that, Su Rou beamed delightedly.

Jian Wushuang released Lin Li from under the huge boulder. The Council was then adjourned and the crowd dispersed.

Peace returned once more to the city of the Blood Asura Clan.
