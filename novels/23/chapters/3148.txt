“The first Hell Dao is so powerful. I wonder what the other five Daos will do?” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, full of expectation.

After killing Bai Yuan and picking up the interspatial ring left by him, Jian Wushuang immediately left.

It only took him 25 breaths to kill Bai Yuan, and it took the Purple Cloud Pavilion experts five breaths to arrive, that was enough time for Jian Wushuang to leave.

After Jian Wushuang left, the experts of the Winter Snow Kingdom were in an uproar.

“Lord Bai Yuan was killed?”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, he really killed Lord Bai Yuan. He is a rank seven True Saint.”

“King...”

Many people looked at the middle-aged man in luxurious clothes, King of Winter Snow Kingdom.

The Winter Snow King was also very excited. Apparently, he had not fully recovered from the scene.

After a while, he took a deep breath and immediately looked at a True Saint next to him. “Did you record the fierce battle between Heavenly Sword Marquis Lord Bai Yuan?”

“Yes.” That True Saint replied.

“That’s good. The experts from the Purple Cloud Pavilion will arrive soon. We only need to show them the mirror image. Heavenly Sword Marquis is too strong. We are not weak at all. Lord Bai Yuan’s death is not our fault.” The Winter Snow King said in a low voice, “Also, we have to announce the mirror image.”

“Announce it completely?” The people around were stunned.

“That’s right. The Divine Beginning Realm is extremely cruel. It’s not that easy for an expert to rise up. And this Heavenly Sword Marquis... His talent is too terrifying. His potential is limitless. and for such a genius with such great potential, he will more or less be envied and ostracized by some people. As long as we announce this mirror image, many experts of the Divine Beginning Realm, including some high and mighty Principles Masters, will most likely pay attention to him!”

“It’s not a good thing to be the center of attention,” the Winter Snow Kingdom said with a cold smile.

Soon, the Winter Snow Kingdom released the mirror image.

...

In the past 60 years, the battle between Jian Wushuang and the Purple Cloud Pavilion for the first heaven was very fierce, and it had become a hot topic among many cultivators.

Although it was a topic, it did not cause much of a stir.

However, after the Winter Snow Kingdom released the mirror image of the battle between Jian Wushuang and Bai Yuan, the First Heaven, including the Third Heaven, could no longer remain calm.

After all, Jian Wushuang had killed a rank seven True Saint!

“Abnormal, this is too abnormal!”

“Where did this Heavenly Sword Marquis come from?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It was already unbelievable that he could kill a rank six Peak True Saint with a rank four True Saint, but now, he actually killed a rank seven True Saint?”

“That’s a rank seven True Saint! In the First Heaven, the strongest person in many forces is only a rank seven True Saint.”

“There are many geniuses in the Divine Beginning Realm. For example, the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, the Dao Palace, and the Temporal Temple all have many top geniuses. Some of them are extremely dazzling, but I’ve never heard of anyone who could kill a rank seven True Saint with a rank four True Saint.”

“If Jian Wushuang doesn’t die, his future achievements will be unimaginable!”

“Jian Wushuang, monster!”

All the experts in the Third Heaven who heard about this and saw the mirror image were shocked by Jian Wushuang’s battle strength.

The words ‘Jian Wushuang’ resounded throughout the Third Heaven in a very short time!

“Monster, monster, great pervert!”

All the names were addressed to Jian Wushuang.

...

In the vast chaotic void, Mo Shan, the three-eyed man, and the blue-haired woman were sitting together.

In the void in front of them, there was a huge mirror image, which was the mirror image of the fierce battle between Jian Wushuang and Bai Yuan.

“Haha, I knew that Heavenly Sword Marquis might give me a surprise. He really gave me a big surprise!” Mo Shan stroked his white beard and laughed heartily.

More than 100 years ago, when Jian Wushuang was trapped in the Mystic Realm of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance by the heart witch, Mo Shan had been looking forward to Jian Wushuang.

He knew that since Jian Wushuang refused his help, he must be confident that he could deal with this situation.

As expected, 90 years later, Jian Wushuang hired Dao Dragon at a great price. In addition, he killed the heart witch and the others with his battle strength, which was enough to defeat a rank six True Saint. At that time, he was very excited.

Now, 60 years later, Jian Wushuang had killed a rank seven True Saint directly...

“This Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed a bit too heaven-defying.”

The three-eyed man also said in a low voice, “There are many geniuses in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Although this time there aren’t many dazzling geniuses, in history, there have been incredible geniuses in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. For example, the super genius ‘Remnant King’ eight million years ago was a complete monster. He could also kill a rank six True Saint with rank four battle strength. If he met a weaker rank six Peak True Saint, he could also kill him if he was lucky!”

“The reason why Remnant King’s battle strength is so strong is that he is a special life-form, and he has a high comprehension of the principles under the careful cultivation of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. He also has a supreme treasure in terms of attack. However, Heavenly Sword Marquis...without the careful cultivation of the major forces, only relied on himself to obtain opportunities and treasures to grow. In the end, his battle strength is much more terrifying than that of Remnant King. It’s really shocking.”

The three-eyed man was, after all, a Principles Master, so he had high expectations.

He had lived for a long time and had seen many amazing geniuses, but none of them were comparable to Jian Wushuang.

“Do you think Heavenly Sword Marquis is also a special life form?” Mo Shan suddenly asked.

“Definitely,” the three-eyed man said with certainty. “He is definitely a special life form, and he must be one of the top ones. Otherwise, his divine power wouldn’t be so powerful.”

“Yeah, I think so too.” Mo Shan nodded slightly. “But even if he is a special life form, to be able to have such combat strength is already very impressive. Moreover, his opportunities are indeed abundant. Looking at this scene, the reason why he was able to kill the rank seven True Saint of the Purple Cloud Pavilion was because of the secret technique he used at the end. And that secret technique, if I’m not mistaken, is the secret technique he comprehended under the Black God Pillar of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, the six paths of reincarnation.”

“His battle strength is obviously similar to that rank seven True Saint, but he used this secret technique and easily killed that rank seven True Saint. The secret technique in the Black God Pillar is really amazing!”
