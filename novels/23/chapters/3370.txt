Chapter 3371: Force Them to Come Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You mean, force them to come out?” Demon Master Chen Huo asked with a strange look on his face.

“This is the sect of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. There should be many experts or disciples of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley valley around the sect. As long as we capture a group of them, there’s no need to worry about Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley being in a hurry,” Jian Wushuang

said with a smile.

“That’s a good idea, but I’m afraid that you won’t be able to attract the attention of the highest level of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley just by capturing a few disciples. At the very least, you’ll have to capture one or two Principles Masters,” Demon Master Chen Huo said.

“As long as you capture disciples, are you afraid that you won’t attract big fish?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo left.

As one of the overlords of the Second Heaven, the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley was superior to the previous Xiaoyao Mansion in terms of both strength and foundation. The territory controlled by the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley was also very vast.

In one of the restaurants in a bustling city around the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo were sitting by the window. They were looking at a team in the market not far away, the team was made up of women. Judging from their attire, it was obvious that

they were from Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

“Chen Huo, it’s up to you,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“There are eight people in total. The strongest one is only a rank five True Saint. I’m not in the mood to fight such a little guy,” Demon Master Chenhuo refused directly.

This was normal. Demon Master Chenhuo was a super expert at the peak of the sixth void realm. Such super experts would more or less pay attention to their status. For them, even if they were asked to fight a Peak Saint or an Invincible Saint…but now, he was asked to fight eight True Saints who were

only at the fifth rank. Of course, he did not want to.

“If you don’t fight, do you want me to go?” Jian Wushuang rolled his eyes at Demon Master Chenhuo, he said, “I’m now too famous in the Divine Beginning Realm. If I fight, it’s hard to guarantee that I won’t be recognized. Once the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley knows that I’m the one who’s arresting

people, let alone sending experts, they might immediately recall all their disciples. Then our plan will not work.”

“It’s your plan. It has nothing to do with me.” Demon Master Chenhuo curled his lips. “Forget it. Let ‘it’do it.”

Demon Master Chenhuo waved his hand, and a burly figure immediately appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“This is… puppet fighter?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“This is a puppet fighter left behind by the Amethyst Demon Sect. Although it’s not very strong and is only at the level of an ordinary Invincible Saint, it’s more than enough to capture these little guys from the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley,” Demon Master Chen Huo said.

“A puppet fighter at the level of an Invincible Saint?” A smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face, at the same time, he praised, “As expected of the Amethyst Demon Sect. Its foundation is indeed extraordinary. I’m afraid that in its heyday, the Amethyst Demon Sect should have even a puppet fighter at the

level of a Principles Master, right?”

Demon Master Chen Huo snorted and did not answer. He just gave an order to the puppet fighter, “Go and capture the eight of you who are wearing the same clothes. Remember, only capture and suppress them alive. Don’t kill them. This is a top-tier holy treasure for suppression. Just suppress them

inside.”

Demon Master Chenhuo also gave a mini palace to the puppet fighter.

Under the order of Demon Master Chenhuo, the puppet fighter immediately set off.

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo watched quietly in the restaurant. When they saw the puppet fighter appear in front of the eight disciples of forget-love valley, they immediately attacked without saying anything.

They attacked the disciples of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley directly in the city near the gate of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley!

The eight disciples of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley were also shocked. They did not expect to be attacked here. They immediately reported to the sect and fought with the puppet fighter.

However, in this fight…the Invincible Saint puppet fighter swept the eight disciples away. The eight disciples wanted to escape, but the Invincible Saint puppet fighter took out the mini palace and used its suppressive power, in an instant, all eight of them were suppressed.

After doing all this, the puppet fighter at the level of the Invincible Saint retumed to Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Let’s go, welll go to the next place to catch them,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Immediately, he and Demon Master Chenhuo wandered around the cities around the mountain gate of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. Every time they came to a city, they would look for the disciples or experts of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. As soon as they found one…they would

immediately have the saint-level puppet fighter take action and suppress it.

It had to be said that the strength of the puppet fighter that the deepfire demon master took out was indeed not bad. It was not inferior to human cultivators at the Invincible Saint Realm. In addition, with the help of the top-tier holy treasure-level suppression-type treasure…it was very easy to suppress

the disciples of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

Even if it encountered a peak saint, it could not escape from this puppet fighter.

In just half a day, that saint realm puppet fighter had suppressed nearly 40 disciples of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. Among them, there were one Peak Saint, three rank seven True Saints, and the rest were all ordinary disciples below rank seven.

And this puppet fighter had suppressed the disciples of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley so brazenly in front of everyone, and it was in the vicinity of the mountain gate of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. This naturally caused the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley to be furious, the

Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley immediately sent experts over to kill them.

It was still in a city near the mountain gate of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. That Invincible Saint Realm puppet-fighter had just suppressed four disciples of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. In the end, just as he was about to return to the side of the Demon Master Chen Huo…a spatial

tunnel suddenly appeared in the void of this city. Following that, no less than ten figures stepped out of the spatial tunnel at the same time.

Each of these figures had a strong aura. The weakest one was an expert above the Peak Saint Realm, and the two Principles Masters were in the lead.

When they arrived, they immediately surrounded the Invincible Saint puppet fighter.

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo hid their auras in a corner of the city. When they saw the ten-odd figures from Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, they smiled. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, the big fish you’ve been waiting for is finally here. The two Principles Masters, together with so many Peak Saints and Invincible Saints, it seems that Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley is also very cautious. They know that this matter might not be so simple, so they sent so

many experts at once,” Demon Master Chen Huo said with a smile.

“It’s big fish, and the two Principles Masters in the lead happen to be two acquaintances of mine,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Acquaintances?” Demon Master Chen Huo was surprised.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were extremely sharp as he looked at the two figures in the center of the Void who were emitting the aura of Principles Masters.
