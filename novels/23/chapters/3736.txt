Chapter 3740: One Against Two

“Blood Sword Master, don’t even think about leaving until you hand over the black wings,” Ruler Tyrant Axe shouted.

“Humph, Tyrant Axe, you think too highly of yourself. So what if you have a Suppression Type Pinnacle True Treasure? Even if I can’t leave, how can you kill me?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, there was no fear in his expression.

He just did not want to cause too much trouble, so he wanted to leave as soon as possible.

But now that he could not leave, there was nothing to be afraid of.

It was not easy to kill him in this Star Field with his life-saving means.

“Let’s try it.”

Ruler Tyrant Axe did not want to waste time with Jian Wushuang. He transformed into a golden demonic god and dashed toward Jian Wushuang with the mighty golden axe in his hand.

Jian Wushuang also went up to meet him.

Jian Wushuang showed his full strength. He even exerted the power of his will, which was given by the universal laws. His battle strength soared and he was much stronger than ordinary Advanced Rulers in terms of basic divine power. With his swordsmanship…he was not afraid to fight head-on with Ruler Tyrant Axe.

He even had a slight advantage in the fight.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A series of low, terrifying explosions and collisions could be heard.

The fierce battle between the two turned the sky and earth dark.

The surrounding Principles Masters who were watching the battle were already terrified.

“This Blood Sword Master is so powerful, so terrifying!”

“He is indeed terrifying. He is just a Principles Master. I originally thought that it would be inconceivable for him to have the battle power of a high-level Ruler, but I didn’t expect him to be even more powerful than the rumors had said. Ruler Tyrant Axe is already considered extremely powerful amongst high-level Rulers, and his axe techniques are tyrannical. He specializes in killing, but in the end, when he fought with the Blood Sword Master, he ended up being at a disadvantage.”

“The Blood Sword Master is slightly stronger than the Tyrant Axe Ruler in terms of direct combat ability.”

The Principles Masters were all amazed.

While Jian Wushuang and the Tyrant Axe Ruler were engaged in a frenzied battle, there was still an endless stream of experts rushing over.

Although the Tyrant Axe Ruler’s suppression-type Supreme Treasure suppressed everything around and prevented Jian Wushuang from leaving, it did not stop people from rushing over.

Therefore, as time passed, more and more experts came to the void.

When these experts arrived, they immediately saw the terrifying battle between the Rulers in the center of the battlefield.

While they were shocked, the new Principles Masters quickly figured out what had happened and knew that the Supreme Flight Type True Treasure had fallen into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

“The Supreme Flight Type True Treasure is in Blood Sword Master’s hands?” Someone suggested? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“What are we waiting for? Why don’t we kill Blood Sword Master Together? Then we can fight for the Supreme Flight Type True Treasure. If so many Principles Masters join hands, even if they are Rulers, they will have to retreat,” Someone suggested.

“Kill Blood Sword Master together?”

As soon as the suggestion was made, someone sneered, “If you want to go, go ahead. I forgot to tell you that Blood Sword Master killed nearly 80 Principles Masters with one sword attack.”

“What?”

Those Principles Masters who had just arrived in the void were shocked.

Killed nearly 80 Principles Masters with one sword attack?

And this matter was confirmed immediately because too many people had seen it at that time.

With such a result, the new Principles Masters became much quieter. From the beginning to the end, none of the Principles Masters did not want to fight anymore.

Of course, Jian Wushuang’s achievement of killing nearly 80 Principles Masters with one sword stroke could shock many Principles Masters, but it could not shock a Ruler-level expert.

In addition to the Ruler Tyrant Axe, who had rushed to the battle with Jian Wushuang, a second Ruler-level expert soon arrived in the void.

The second master was an acquaintance of Jian Wushuang.

It was Pupil Master, who had been defeated by Jian Wushuang 3,000 years ago and had no choice but to flee in embarrassment!

“Blood Sword Master!”

As soon as Pupil Master arrived in the void, his faintly red eyes immediately locked onto Jian Wushuang.

On the way here, he had learned that the most powerful Flight Type Supreme Treasure had fallen into Jian Wushuang’s hands. Now, Jian Wushuang was engaged in a fierce battle with the Ruler Tyrant Axe.

The occupation in front of him made Pupil Master realize that it was impossible for the Ruler Tyrant Axe to defeat Jian Wushuang alone, and it was also impossible for him to hand over the black wings.

Pupil Master stepped forward without hesitation.

“Ruler Tyrant Axe, let’s join hands and teach this arrogant kid a good lesson,” Pupil Master shouted in a low voice.

“Okay.” Ruler Tyrant Axe nodded. “This kid is not weak, and his ability to fight head-on is not weaker than mine. However, no matter how strong he is, he is only a Principles Master. His body protection ability should not be that strong. Help me from the side and kill him when you have the chance.”

“Okay.” Pupil Master nodded heavily.

They all understood that it was almost impossible for Jian Wushuang to hand over the wings in his hands.

In that case, they had to find a way to kill Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang was very strong, he was only a Principles Master, so his life-saving ability could not be compared to an ordinary Ruler. This also gave them hope to kill Jian Wushuang.

Rumble! The endless blood clouds rolled.

A monstrous wave of air pressed toward Jian Wushuang.

Pupil Master also made a move, and he did his best.

Having fought with Jian Wushuang in a head-on battle, he knew that Jian Wushuang was definitely stronger than him.

“Pupil Master?”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and glanced at Pupil Master, but he was still not afraid.

He did not care about the Ruler Tyrant Axe at all.

Even with Pupil Master, he was still not qualified to threaten him.

So what if they joined hands?

Even if the two Rulers joined hands, with his current strength, he could still fight them head-on and even suppress them.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang attacked with all his strength.

Not only did he unleash his power to the maximum, but most importantly, his swordsmanship had finally been completely unleashed.

It should be known that he had entered the origin of the sword universe very early in his understanding of sword principle, which was a step that most Rulers had never reached.

After a long period of time, especially five thousand years of comprehension under the heaven suppressing tablet, and three thousand years of study within the Sword Stone, his comprehension of the Sword Dao grew increasingly higher and higher. The current him…had already truly stepped into the origin of the sword universe.

His comprehension of the Sword Dao had long surpassed that of an ordinary high-level Ruler. Even if it was a peak Ruler, there were probably only a few who could match up to him.

With such a high understanding of the sword, his attainments in swordsmanship were naturally high as well.
