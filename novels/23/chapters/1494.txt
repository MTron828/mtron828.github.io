Chapter 1495: The Mysterious White Fruit

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang was sitting with his legs crossed in the vast Heaven Way River in the Real God Hall. He could feel that his surroundings were filled with a tremendous amount of the Power of Heaven Way.

The Supreme Four Doctrine and the Nine Heaven God Doctrine were all within the Heaven Way River.

“Previously, I only stayed at the Real God Hall for a month and I comprehended a portion of the Reincarnation Power. Hence, my abilities skyrocketed. This time round, I have four months, which is a lot more time. In these four months, I cannot even waste a second.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing brilliantly. He closed his eyes soon after and began his comprehension with great concentration.

During his comprehension, time passed by.

…

The Eternal Chaotic World was boundless and had no limits. Hence, it contained all kinds of wonderful things.

Within this far-reaching land, an extremely valuable treasure was hidden.

The Red Dragon Sanctuary of the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries!

There was a vast sea with waves surging forward with great momentum. This sea was a big, perilous place in the Red Dragon Sanctuary and it was known as the Wind Fire Sea.

The Wind Fire Sea was extremely dangerous and even the sea water was dyed the color of blood.

At that moment, within a normal island that no one was aware of in the middle of the Wind Fire Sea –

Boom!

A piercing voice burst forth fiercely and the whole island shook violently, as if the universe was shaking.

Under the tremendous shaking, whiz, whiz, whiz! Three shadows plunged out from the deepest part of the island and it was only until they were in the void millions of miles away from the island that they stopped.

Among the three of them, there were two men and one woman. At that very moment, they were puffing and panting. At the same time, they were also looking in the direction of the island with an extremely horrified look.

“Too frightening, that place is too frightening!” among the three of them, the red-clothed woman, who was the only woman, muttered.

“Third Sibling, Fifth Sibling and the Sixth Sibling have died. Only the three of us walked out alive,” the slim, bald young man clenched both his fists tightly. His face was filled with sorrow.

“This is all my fault. I underestimated how dangerous that place was. Previously, I thought that that was only a cave left behind by a normal expert, but who could expect that…” among the three of them, the old man, who was the leader of the group, was wearing silver armor and he had the ghastliest expression.

Both the red-clothed woman and the bald young man looked at the silver-armored old man. However, they could only shake their heads.

They knew that this matter was decided by the three of them and it was not the idea of the silver-armored old man alone.

“Since things have already become as such, there is no use regretting it. Second Brother, didn’t you get a fruit just now? Take it out and let us have a look,” the red-clothed woman said.

The bald young man’s expression changed. With a wave of his hand, he took out a sweet-smelling white fruit. The white fruit was extremely delicate and pure.

“It’s this fruit that got the three of them killed,” the bald young man stared at the white fruit and his eyes were glowing fiercely.

“We have never seen nor heard of this fruit before. However, I have a feeling that this fruit is special!” the silver-armored old man said.

“I have this feeling as well,” the red-clothed woman nodded her head as well.

“First Brother, what do we do with this fruit?” the bald young man looked toward the silver-armored old man.

The silver-armored old man muttered to himself for some time and spoke after that, “We have no idea what this fruit is, nor its uses. Hence, it would be a waste to keep it with us. Therefore, we should sell it to someone who knows about it.”

“Someone who knows about this fruit?” both the red-clothed women and the bald young man each revealed a puzzled expression.

“The Vientiane Tower!” the silver-armored old man’s eyes were glowing brilliantly.

…

In a secret room of the Vientiane Tower.

The silver-armored old man took out the mysterious white fruit and handed it over to the branch owner of the Vientiane Tower for inspection.

However, even the owner did not know about the background of the mysterious white fruit.

“My guests, please wait a moment. I will send the information of this fruit to the higher-ups and the high-level experts of the Vientiane Tower will appraise the fruit personally,” the branch owner of the Vientiane Tower said.

“Understood,” the silver-armored old man pocketed the mysterious white fruit and waited at his position quietly.

After an hour, the branch owner of the Vientiane Tower took out a token and broke it into pieces.

Boom!

A strong aura burst forth and became a big and dim shadow. Next, a pair of sharp eyes which could pierce through everything appeared.

“This, this is Tower Master Qi Fu of the Vientiane Tower, the second-in-charge of the Red Dragon Sanctuary?” the branch owner himself who took out the token was surprised as well.

The second-in-charge of the Red Dragon Sanctuary?

Tower Master Qi Fu?

He was an expert of the highest level of the Vientiane Tower and his consciousness had actually come down personally?

“Greetings to Tower Master Qi Fu!” the branch owner bowed and greeted him immediately.

“Where is that fruit?” an extremely dignified voice could be heard from the enormous shadow.

“My Lord, the fruit is with me.”

The silver-armored old man took out the mysterious white fruit and his voice was very respectful. He could tell that the big shadow was a super expert who could shake the world.

“As expected, it’s that fruit!”

When the big shadow saw that mysterious white fruit, his eyes glowed with a substance-like light immediately. After that, he shot a glance at the silver-armored old man and frowned, “A Universe God?”

“Yes,” the silver-armored old man felt a bit fearful.

He was indeed a Universe God. However, he was a Universe God who stood at the peak of the Third Heaven. However, he was still very far away from the Universe God ranking list.

“A mere Universe God can actually find such a treasure?”

After muttering to himself for some time, the big shadow said with dignity: “I will give you two choices now. Firstly, hand this fruit over to the Vientiane Tower. In addition, tell us everything you know about this fruit, including how and where you obtained it. After that, the Vientiane Tower will give you two hundred million Chaos Gems. As for you, you must forget everything you know about this fruit from today onward.”

“Secondly, the fruit will still remain in the Vientiane Tower, but you refuse to say anything. The Vientiane Tower will not blame you for that. However, after you leave, I guarantee you that countless experts from the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries who stand at the top will think of all kinds of ways to find you and get you to spit out information of the fruit, even if they have to hack you into pieces.”

“Among these two choices, pick one of them!”

“My Lord, I choose the first choice,” the silver-armored old man picked the first choice without hesitation.

He could also tell how important the fruit was. Hence, he would naturally not dare to withhold any information. Even though he knew that the fruit was extraordinarily valuable and it could not be compared to a mere two hundred million Chaos Gems, he agreed without hesitation and dared not bargain at all.

“Two hundred million Chaos Gems is more than all the family keepsakes and valuables of a Real God. For a Universe God like me to obtain so many Chaos Gems is more than enough. If I were to ask for more, I would just be asking for death!” the silver-armored old man was clear about this point.

“Speak.”
