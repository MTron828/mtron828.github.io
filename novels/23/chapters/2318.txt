Chapter 2319 One Strike

“Old pal, it’s been a long time since I last fought with you.”Jian Wushuang ran his fingers through the body of the Blood Mountain Sword while feeling the icy cold sensation from it.

The Blood Mountain Sword was the closest comrade Jian Wushuang had ever had.

Although it had only been sixteen years since he had held the Blood Mountain Sword and gone on a killing spree, it felt like a lifetime.

The difference of a lifetime was undoubtedly long.

Now that Jian Wushuang had taken out his Blood Mountain Sword again, it symbolized that the infamous Sword Emperor of the previous lifetime was about to use his reaper sword once again.

As for the Blood Mountain Sword, it could also pick up the killing intent from Jian Wushuang that it had been missing for a long time. The body of the sword started trembling violently.

“Tsk! Although this kid is still young, he has a pretty good sword!”

“I heard when this kid was born, a divine sword descended with him. It was also because of that that the name he was given suggested he would be unparalleled in swords. That divine sword that descended with him is probably the one he is holding on to currently.”

“Such an incredible sword in the hands of a Pure Sun Realm kid would be such a waste. It’s better for it to be with us to show its true might.”

“To prevent unexpected events from happening, let’s kill him right now!”

“Kill!”

After a short conversation, all four of them struck at the same time.

Logically speaking, they were all at the Chaotic Realm while Jian Wushuang was just at the Pure Sun Realm. Any one of them could have easily killed Jian Wushuang.

Yet, they had chosen to strike at the first instant together. This was because they wouldn’t want to give Jian Wushuang even the slightest opportunity.

Moreover, they coordinated well.

One of them was using a sabre and was like the embodiment of the God of Thunder as he charged towards Jian Wushuang with flickering lightning surrounding him.

Another one used a black spear. Through the emptiness of space, he silently lunged towards Jian Wushuang’s head.

A girl was using a red long whip that moved like a giant python and was circling around Jian Wushuang swiftly.

The most stunning of them all was a burly bald man. As he pushed out his palm. a giant hand formed that shrouded the space before Jian Wushuang.

They had completely cut off any path of escape for Jian Wushuang.

The next instant, the sabre sliced open Jian Wushuang’s body.

That black spear penetrated Jian Wushuang’s skull.

That long red whip crushed Jian Wushuang’s body.

And the final large palm from the burly bald man destroyed everything that Jian Wushuang had been using initially.

Everything was so smooth and fluid.

However, the four Chaotic Realm experts that struck felt something wasn’t right.

This was because all of them could feel their attacks weren’t connecting with a material body.

Whoosh!

Unknowingly, Jian Wushuang had appeared in the middle of the quartet.

In the same space, Jian Wushuang utilised Spacetime Rules of Order and arrived in the middle of the quartet silently.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang struck with his Blood Mountain Sword.

Weng~~~~

As the sword moved through, ripples reverberated through the surrounding space as though something heavy was being thrown into a calm lake.

The swing from Jian Wushuang was like a heavy object while the surrounding space was like a peaceful lake.

A sword glow lit up the space and intoxicated the rest. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was just a small ray of sword light and yet the entire space was shrouded in it.

For a moment, time and space seemed to have stopped.

It was as though the four figures were frozen solid and not moving an inch.

Jian Wushuang put away his sword slowly and walked through the quartet without taking a look back.

At this very moment, the frozen quartet was filled with fear.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to move. They couldn’t have even if they wished to. Moreover, they could feel a sharp pain in their necks. From there, blood started flowing out.

A thin, minuscule sword mark had been left on their necks.

However, this sword mark had neatly sliced through their necks.

The quartet could clearly feel their vitality slipping rapidly from their bodies.

Before death, they were filled with astonishment and disbelief.

When Jian Wushuang walked out of the middle of the quarter, four heads flew off.

In a single strike, the four Chaotic Realm experts from the Zhuge Family had been killed!

At the other end, Jian Wushuang could hear angry roars from time to time. Those were from the five demonic dragons.

The five demonic dragons were extremely powerful and just one of them was sufficient to suppress a Peak Chaotic Realm. When the five of them coordinated, even Half Step Divine Demon would have to go all out against them.

Lin Yi’s fighting strength was just barely comparable to a Half Step Divine Demon’s. After an intense battle, he had crushed one of the demonic dragons relying on his Sword Principle. However, he had also suffered some injuries while battling the demonic dragons.

As for the red-haired old lady with the dragon head truncheon, she stood in the air. When Lin Yi was battling the demonic dragons, she would search for opportunities to attack. Lin Yi’s injuries had been caused by her directly.

Although both of them were in battle, they were also paying attention to the situation at the other end.

Lin Yi was initially flabbergasted when he saw Jian Wushuang not heeding his warning to leave at the first instant. There was nothing he could have done.

Subsequently, Lin Yi felt despair when he saw the Chaotic Realm quartet strike decisively towards Jian Wushuang with their killer moves.

He had not thought Jian Wushuang would have any chance of survival under the besiegement of the Chaotic Realm quartet.

Just as the thought went through his mind, the tiny and intoxicating sword light illuminated the space.

“That strike...”

Lin Yi was completely mesmerized by Jian Wushuang’s strike.

He could tell from a single glance that the strike was the Snow Cleave that Jian Wushuang had created three years ago. He had only gained enlightenment and made a breakthrough in his Sword Principle after seeing it go into cultivation in seclusion for three years.

This strike was definitely the most amazing and mysterious that Lin Yi had ever seen.

It wasn’t just him. Even that red-haired old lady was mesmerized by that strike.

The next instant, something unbelievable happened before the red-haired old lady and Lin Yi.

After that single strike, the Chaotic Realm quartet from Zhuge Family couldn’t put up a struggle at all and had their heads severed directly!

“Impossible!” A strange light glittered in the eyes of the red-haired old lady as she stared deadly at Jian Wushuang.

“How could this have happened?” Lin Yi was stupefied!

He would admit Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principle was exceptionally amazing and no one in Anjiu Prefecture was a match for him.

However, regardless of how incredible his Sword Principle was, he was merely a Pure Sun Realm?
