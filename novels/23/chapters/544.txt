Chapter 545: An Outsider

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“17 Temple Masters?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Temple Masters had a supreme position in the Monster-exterminating League. It was not easy to meet any one of them, let alone to meet 17 Temple Masters.

Even if Emperor Golden Snake used up all of his wealth, it was impossible for him to meet so many Temple Masters.

Most importantly, the Temple Masters might not promise even if he could afford the price.

“Of course, he can’t do anything publicly. But he may find a chance to kill you secretly,” Qing Huo said.

If Emperor Golden Snake used some secret means, as long as he was not discovered by others, no one could blame him.

“I’ll take whatever measures the situation calls for. I’m ready for him, regardless of whether his actions are open or secret,” Jian Wushuang replied calmly. He had a taste of Emperor Golden Snake’s strength from the previous fight with him.

Although he might have difficulty competing with Emperor Golden Snake in one-to-one combat, it would not be a problem for him to keep his life.

Jian Wushuang did not care too much about Emperor Golden Snake’s threat. On the other side, Emperor Golden Snake was sitting at a long desk in one of East Camp’s tents.

“General, all the information about Jian Wushuang is here,” A sergeant handed a packet of information to him.

Emperor Golden Snake took the paper and immediately frowned. He asked, “So little?”

The material was only a few pages long, so it didn’t take long for Emperor Golden Snake to open it and read through it.

“What’s this? There is only information on?him for the last few months. Where is the rest of his information?” Emperor Golden Snake asked.

“General, according to the information we found, Jian Wushuang was saved by the Wu Yan Tribe a few months ago. No one knew anything about him before that,” the sergeant replied respectfully.

“Oh?” Emperor Golden Snake was surprised and read the information again.

“Hm? He just started to learn the Bone Fusion Technique when he joined the Wu Yan Tribe?”Emperor Golden Snake was surprised.

Since he had fought with Jian Wushuang, he clearly understood Jian Wushuang’s physical strength. Obviously, Jian Wushuang had cultivated to the sixth level of the Bone Fusion Technique.

“He’s such a powerful Saint Realm expert, but he only just learned the Bone Fusion Technique a few months ago? In addition, he has cultivated to the sixth level of the Bone Fusion Technique within such a short period...”

“His past is also full of mystery. Even the Monster-exterminating Pagoda failed to find out his background before entering the Wu Yan Tribe...”

“Since he’s so strong and has extraordinary means, why was he not famous at all?”

Emperor Golden Snake frowned thoughtfully.

“There are only two possible ways to explain all this!” Emperor Golden Snake’s eyes suddenly lit up.

“The first one, he’s a monster spy!”

“However, since he is a Divine General, he must have been inspected by a Monster Discriminator, so that isn’t possible.”

“That only leaves the second option, he is an outsider!”

Outsiders referred to human experts who came from outside of the Monster Continent.

There were several outsiders on the Monster Continent and there were even three outsiders among the 108 Divine Emperors.

When Jian Wushuang was in the Wu Yan Tribe, Qing Huo, a First-grade Divine General, had guessed Jian Wushuang’s identity as an outsider. Golden Snake had a broader vision than Qing Huo, so he naturally could figure it out as well.

“Haha, God blessed me. God blessed me!”

“Jian Wushuang turns out to be an outsider.”

Emperor Golden Snake became extremely excited.

He was worried about how to kill Jian Wushuang and avenge his son, but now he knew that Jian Wushuang was an outsider.

People in the Monster-exterminating League would inevitably have some objection to outsiders. The League was more likely to help their own people when there were conflicts.

After all, a mother would favor her own son no matter what her son did.

If Jian Wushuang was not an outsider, the Temple Masters would probably refuse Emperor Golden Snake’s application for a Life-death Duel. After all, Jian Wushuang had great potential. As a Saint Realm expert, he was already so powerful. Once he entered the Cloud Realm, he would become at least a superior emperor. It was even possible for him to become the 34th Temple Master of the Monster-exterminating League.

The Monster-exterminating League would never allow a peerless genius like Jian Wushuang to be killed prematurely.

But an outsider was different. What was the use of a potential outsider who was not controlled by the Monster-exterminating League?

In contrast, although Emperor Golden Snake did not have as much potential, he was a Divine Emperor and could make greater contributions to the League.

“Since we know he’s an outsider, it will be easier to kill him,” Emperor Golden Snake sneered and left the tent.

After traveling through the wormhole, Emperor Golden Snake quickly arrived at the Holy Place.

Among the palaces that covered the mountain in the Holy Place, there was a scarlet one, and the owner of that palace was Temple Master Iceberg, one of the Temple Masters in the Monster-exterminating League.

The palace was magnificent.

A middle-aged man with a mustache was sitting there, barefoot and wearing a loose robe.

“Respected elder,” Emperor Golden Snake said with his head down.

This man was also a Temple Master. When facing Temple Master Pure Moon, Emperor Golden Snake appeared to be humble and respectful, but he was filled with genuine respect and fear toward this man.

“Golden Snake, did you come here for your son Jin Ling?” the middle-aged man named Temple Master Iceberg looked down at him.

“Yes.” Emperor Golden Snake nodded respectfully.

“I can’t help you avenge your son,” Temple Master Iceberg shook his head.

“Elder,” Emperor Golden Snake’s look changed slightly.

“Golden Snake.”

Temple Master Iceberg spoke some more, “I’ve watched you grow up all the way to Divine Emperor, so I can be counted as a half Master to you. Because of that, I’ll help you as long as I can. However, I also have to obey the rules of the League. The man who you want to kill is a Second-grade Divine General. You can only kill him by initiating a Life-death Duel!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“But, the most important issue is that he’s only a Saint Realm expert...”

“Eve as a Saint Realm expert, he has the battle strength of a Second-grade Divine General. Such a peerless genius has never appeared on the Monster Continent before. The old guys in the League will never allow you to kill him.”

“What’s more, they may send experts to protect him secretly so that he can grow up to become a powerful resource for the League.”

“Elder, Jian Wushuang is an outsider.” Emperor Golden Snake suddenly said.

“What?”Temple Master Iceberg’s look changed.
