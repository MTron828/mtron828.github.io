Chapter 1529: Defeat The God Destroying King!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Boom! Boom!

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng attacked again.

Two experts standing at the top of countless Universe Gods had teamed up to fight the God Destroying King!

Duan Lingfeng had already displayed his comprehension of the Massacre Doctrine and Darkness Doctrine completely.

His comprehension of the Massacre Doctrine and Darkness Doctrine already had the ability to clear the first level of the Doctrine Palace.

The saber skills that he had created were so powerful that it was absurd. Combined with many secret skills, his fighting capabilities at that very moment were enough to make a normal Real God despair.

As for Jian Wushuang… His attack power, defense and speed were at the top of the Universe God ranking list. Moreover, his martial art motion was extremely strange.

The most important thing was his Soul Attacks!

His Soul Attacks were a great threat to the God Destroying King.

Afterall, it was impossible to avoid Soul Attacks and one could only defend or block with all their might.

The Soul Attacks that were unleashed time after time had caused the God Destroying King to be under even more pressure.

Take the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan that Jian Wushuang used with his full power as an example. With every attack, the God Destroying King’s consciousness would be wounded.

After taking the attack four times, his consciousness was already seriously injured.

From then on… The fifth attack, the sixth attack. It was only when the God Destroying King took the seventh attack of the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan that his expression turned ghastly pale.

“Haha, he won’t last for much longer. Duan Lingfeng, let’s put in a bit more effort. Today, the both of us shall defeat the God Destroying King!” Jian Wushuang laughed loudly.

“No problem,” Duan Lingfeng was filled with murderous intent.

However, at that moment, the God Destroying King’s body changed and he retreated to a distant void.

As he stood at the void, the God Destroying King stared at Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng with an ashen expression.

“Jian Wushuang, White-robed Swordsman, today, I admit that I have lost. The days are still long. If there is another opportunity after today, I will fight the two of you again!”

With a roar, the God Destroying King turned his body and left immediately.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng stood beside one another and they looked on as the figure of the God Destroying King flew further away. Finally, the God Destroying King disappeared from their field of vision completely.

At that moment, both Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng heaved a sigh of relief.

“The God Destroying King has finally left,” as Jian Wushuang spoke, his whole body almost collapsed.

“He was scared off by you,” Duan Lingfeng glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“Haha,” Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh and he said: “If I didn’t scare him, he might push on and continue fighting with us. At that time, both of us would be the ones escaping tragically.”

Jian Wushuang was very certain that in the match moments ago, his cooperation with Duan Lingfeng had indeed managed to push back the God Destroying King.

However, they did not overpower him easily.

Afterall, the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan was a secret skill of the Soul Attacks. Hence, it would deplete a huge amount of Soul Power.

Although Jian Wushuang’s Force of Soul had risen greatly, he had used up quite a bit of his Soul Power during his match with Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu. After that, he had continued fighting against the God Destroying King and he unleashed the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan seven times consecutively. As a result, his Soul Power had been completely exhausted.

He had absolutely no way of using the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan an eighth time.

Without the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan, they would be unable to push back the God Destroying King.

Moreover, not only were Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power depleted, even Duan Lingfeng’s Divine Power would be completely used up as well.

In other words, both of them were unable to continue the fight. As such, Jian Wushuang intentionally said that he would work together with Duan Lingfeng to destroy the God Destroying King at that moment. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He was merely putting up a strong front to scare the God Destroying King.

“The God Destroying King must have depleted a huge amount of energy as well. Moreover, his consciousness should be on the edge of falling apart. Hence, he has no choice. Even if you didn’t scare him, he would probably not want to continue fighting against us,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“Perhaps so,” Jian Wushuang said, “No matter what, the God Destroying King is really frightening.”

“Indeed,” Duan Lingfeng also nodded his head seriously.

Although he had teamed up with Jian Wushuang, they were only barely able to push back the God Destroying King.

Moreover, if the God Destroying King had decided to push on and continue fighting against them, would the end result still be the same?

What kind of power was that?

“As expected of the strongest expert recognized by the Universe God ranking list. Even the proud and ambitious Zi Dongwang could not be compared to any super monsters that were proficient in mental strength. But the abilities of the God Destroying King…” As Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, he had a thought in his mind, “Perhaps after I clear the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven and become a Universe God of the Third Heaven for real, I’ll be able to defeat him.”

At the moment where Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were gasping in surprise with regards to the God Destroying King’s shocking fighting capabilities.

At a void far away from the battlefield, numerous Universe Gods had gathered. Many of them had arrived a long time ago to witness the astonishing battle from afar.

When the pinnacle match concluded for real, everyone was stunned.

“The team consisting of the God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu actually… lost?”

“Even though Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu teamed up, they were still defeated by Jian Wushuang alone? And Zi Dongwang was seriously injured?”

“Jian Wushuang and the White-robed Swordsman teamed up and managed to push back the God Destroying King?”

“The invincible God Destroying King actually lost?”

“Gosh!!!”

Inside the vast hall outside the cave.

Many Almighties, as well as the Real Gods of many big powerhouses, had gathered. In the middle of the big hall, there was a giant video screen.

The video was recorded meticulously by someone who had seen the pinnacle match. It was then sent over after the match had concluded.

What appeared in the video first was the scene where Jian Wushuang was fighting Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu.

“Gosh. Jian Wushuang actually dared to have a close combat fight with Zi Dongwang? Moreover, both of them are actually evenly matched?”

“His close combat abilities are actually not weaker than Zi Dongwang’s?”

In the video, after Jian Wushuang and Zi Dongwang clashed with their strongest move, Jian Wushuang used his Soul Attacks at once. This caused Zi Dongwang to give shrill roars. After that, Jian Wushuang wounded Zi Dongwang with a stroke and caused him to escape madly.

“This… this is a consciousness attack?”

“Even Zi Dongwang was unable to block Jian Wushuang’s consciousness attack? Doesn’t that mean that his consciousness attacks are stronger than Xin Zhu’s?”

“His consciousness attacks are stronger than Xin Zhu’s, his martial art motion is more frightening than Universe God Liu Ying’s, and his close combat abilities are not weaker than Zi Dongwang’s. In addition, there are also his defensive abilities. I also feel that he is not inferior to the Ice Feather Demon King, who is ranked eighth in the Universe God ranking list. As such, he can be said to have no weak points at all. The only thing that he is lacking in is probably his Unique Skills!”

“How strange. Even though Jian Wushuang is so powerful, why are his Unique Skills so weak?”

In actual fact, it was already very impressive for a Universe God like Jian Wushuang to create so many Real God Unique Skills.

However, compared to the experts in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list who stood at the peak of the pyramid in the Eternal Chaotic World, it was indeed very?inferior.

The intense fight in the video continued. After Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu escaped from Jian Wushuang, it proceeded to show Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng teaming up to fight against the God Destroying King.
