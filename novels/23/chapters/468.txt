Chapter 469: Six-Story Pagoda

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Swoosh!

Bright sword light flashed like lightning and penetrated the Void.

The sword movement Jian Wushuang used was Desperation. He used his force to violently break the Blonde Puppet’s axe?movements and knock him backwards.

The Blonde Puppet Blonde regained his footing. There was a white mark on his body left by Jian Wushuang’s sword. If he had been an ordinary lord, he would have been dead.

“You won.”

He looked at Jian Wushuang and threw a black Flowing Light to him. He said, “This is your reward for passing the test.”

Jian Wushuang caught it. As he inspected it, a strange expression flashed on his face.

The black Flowing Light turned out to be a mini black pagoda with six stories, each of the same height.

“A pagoda?” Jian Wushuang left the secret chamber. Doubts churned in his mind as he returned to the palace to meet Di Jing.

“Not bad, boy,” Di Jing smiled faintly.

“Respected elder, is this pagoda the good thing you mentioned?” Jian Wushuang asked skeptically.

“Boy, don’t be too greedy,” Di Jing said as he looked at him. “It’s called Six-story Pagoda. It’s definitely a good thing in Divine Land and it’s useful to you.”

“Six-story Pagoda?” Jian Wushuang whispered.

“Try to bind to it,” Di Jing said.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang used his blood to bind to it. He met no resistance from the black pagoda at all and finished the process quickly.

“Well?”

Jian Wushuang realized the difference after binding to it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He could clearly sense a Restriction on the first story of the pagoda.

It was very complex and enigmatic. At first glance, Jian Wushuang could feel it but not understand it.

“What a mysterious Restriction,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

Di Jing said, “Boy, there is a Restriction on each story of the Pagoda. They were all Slaughter Restrictions.”

“You’ve meditated on the Slaughter Origin, right?” Di Jing looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded. He mainly meditated on two types of Origin, World Origin and Slaughter Origin. In the past, his comprehension of Slaughter Origin had been higher than that of World Origin.

After adventuring in Marquis Beimo cave mansion, his comprehension of World Origin had vastly improved. He had formed four World Origin Marks and only one Slaughter Origin Mark.

“That’s it.”

Di Jing responded with a smile and said, “The six Restrictions are extremely profound and each contains 999 Slaughter Occults. Since you’ve meditated on Slaughter Origin, you can also meditate on these Slaughter Occults. The reference of the Slaughter Occults will greatly improve your speed in comprehending it.”

“When you comprehend all 999 Slaughter Occults, you can unriddle the first Restriction. Then, it’d mean that you’ve really entered the Slaughter Dao.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned, but exhilaration soon took over.

He turned to sense the first Restriction in the pagoda and felt the existence of many Slaughter Occults. Most of them were new to Jian Wushuang.

“No wonder you said that the Six-story Pagoda is useful to me. It’s such a great opportunity for me,” Jian Wushuang said in gratitude.

The first Restriction was obviously a shortcut to the Slaughter Dao.

Dao... Beyond the Origin was Dao!

When comprehension of the Origin reached the peak, the Origin would naturally transfer into Dao.

For example, Slaughter Origin would transfer into Slaughter Dao when his comprehension reached an extremely high level.

Dao was much more powerful than Origin.

That was why many experts and marquises would fight tooth and nail for the Dao Weapon. Dao Weapon was involved with “Dao”.

However, Dao was too enigmatic!

Even though the marquis experts were strong, they were not qualified to have access to “Dao”.

In Divine Land, only Ten Sovereigns and Three Ancestors had entered the level of “Dao”.

How extraordinary the Six-story Pagoda was, that its first Restriction alone could enable Jian Wushuang to enter the Slaughter Dao!

“Boy, you’ve won this advantage. Now I’ll send you away,” Di Jing said.

“Thank you, Respected Elder,” said Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he bowed to the Puppet Master.

Di Jing raised his eyebrows. He waved his hand and a huge wormhole immediately appeared in the Void in the hall.

Di Jing’s ease at creating such a huge wormhole shocked Jian Wushuang. The latter revised his estimation of Di Jing’s strength.

“Go in,” Di Jing said.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang stepped into the wormhole and soon disappeared.

After he had left, someone walked slowly out of the secret chamber. It was the Blonde Puppet who had fought with Jian Wushuang.

He came to Di Jing in the hall and asked, “Sir, may I ask why you said your Six-story Pagoda was my master’s fourth test?”

The Blonde Puppet was confused.

Puppet Master, the owner of the cave mansion, had only set three tests, which were about making puppets. The opportunities after passing the tests were also about making puppets. The fourth test had actually been set by Di Jing just now.

His purpose was obvious, that was, to give the Six-story Pagoda to Jian Wushuang.

Di Jing remained silent while he thought to himself.

“Young master is indifferent and doesn’t trust others easily. Even I’m not qualified to get her pledge, but she gave him one... What’s more, he can refine young master’s Icy Heart Poison. It’s so incredible.”

“He’s of great use to young master, but he is too weak now.”

Di Jing had given the Six-story Pagoda to Jian Wushuang to help him improve his strength as quickly as possible. He had concealed the truth about the Six-story Pagoda’s ownership because of his identity.

It would be better to keep Jian Wushuang in the dark.
