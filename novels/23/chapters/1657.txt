1658 Three Droplets

“That Jian Wushuang has definitely killed a Three-Horned Star Demon head-on.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Real God Xue Ling was murmuring, “Real God Gu Ying and I are genuine Chaotic Real Gods. When we teamed up, both of us unleashed our full powers right off the bat. However, we were still easily suppressed by Jian Wushuang in the end. Moreover, Real God Gu Ying was killed on the spot. Jian Wushuang’s abilities…”

“A top Chaotic Real God!”

“That’s right. Jian Wushuang definitely has the fighting capabilities of a top Chaotic Real God. Moreover, he is also comparable to Real God Zi Ye of our Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

“But he is only a Void Real God!!”

Real God Xue Ling’s mind was filled with shock and it was only after a long time that he calmed down.

After that, he took out a transmission token and sent a message to the higher-ups of the Soaring Heaven King Palace to inform them of the matter.

The higher-ups of the Soaring Heaven King Palace also replied quickly.

“Hmph. Jian Wushuang, I admit that you are an unbelievable genius. However, the experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace are not people who you can kill as and when you like!” Real God Xue Ling’s eyes were scarlet in color.

…

Inside the cave that Jian Wushuang opened, he had been sitting down with his legs crossed and he was absorbing the Demon Spirits and Demon Cores that he had obtained so far with great concentration.

As Jian Wushuang absorbed them, he realized that the pure power within the Demon Spirits and Demon Cores was not as simple as he had expected.

When he was absorbing the pure power previously, he had absorbed them forcefully. Although there would not be any side effects in doing so, a considerable amount of pure power would be lost.

However, at that very moment, as Jian Wushuang continued to absorb the pure power, he gradually found a new way to absorb the pure power.

Although his new method of absorbing the pure power would take a longer period of time, he would not waste any pure power of the Demon Spirits and Demon Cores.

Time passed by. In a flash, one year had passed.

During the one year, Jian Wushuang had absorbed many of his Demon Spirits as well as his Grade One Demon Cores completely. With that, the Ultimate Divine Power within his body had increased greatly as well.

At that moment, there was a total of two Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets in his body.

This meant that Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power was twice as thick as before.

“I have finished absorbing all my Grade One Demon Cores. Now it’s time for the Grade Two Demon Cores.” With a flip of his hands, Jian Wushuang took out two Grade Two Demon Cores.

The amount of pure power that a Grade Two Demon Core contained was many times more than that of a Grade One Demon Core. Jian Wushuang then began to absorb the pure power from the Grade Two Demon Cores.

For the two Grade Two Demon Cores, it would require six months’ time to absorb them both. After the two Grade Two Demon Cores were completely absorbed, half a year had passed. With that, the Ultimate Divine Power in Jian Wushuang’s body increased again. However, he was still a step away from forming the third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet.

“Originally, I thought that the second and third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet were the same as the first Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet. However, looking at it now, that is not the case. Comparing the level of thickness, the second Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet is stronger than the first water droplet. As for the third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet, it is thicker than the second water droplet. Thus, it will require me to absorb more pure power and it will be more difficult for me to form it,” Jian Wushuang muttered. However, his eyes were looking at the final Demon Core on his hands.

That Demon Core was the Grade Three Demon Core.

“The Grade Three Demon Core contains even more pure power and I hope that it can help me to form the third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly. After that, he started to absorb the pure power from within the Grade Three Demon Core.

Not only was it more difficult to absorb a Grade Three Demon Core compared to a Grade Two Demon Core, the time taken was also longer.

Jian Wushuang took a total of one year and four months to complete the absorption of the pure power of the Grade Three Demon Core.

After the absorption was complete, the third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet was finally formed in his body!

“There are three droplets now!”

When Jian Wushuang sensed the three Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets that were in his body, his eyes glowed brilliantly.

“It has only been a few years since I came to Eighth Lair and I have already managed to raise my abilities greatly by forming the third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet. If I were to continue relying on the pure power within the Demon Cores, I would probably be able to form the tenth Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet in no time!”

“At that time… I will be able to make a breakthrough to Stage Two Ultimate Real God. With that, my Divine Power and body will achieve the level of an Almighty. Even though my comprehension of the Heaven Way is slightly lacking, I will still be able to run wild amidst the Real Gods with just my Divine Power and body!”

While thinking about that, Jian Wushuang was extremely excited.

To everyone else, although the Eighth Lair was an opportunity, its effectiveness was limited.

However, to Jian Wushuang, the Eighth Lair was a great opportunity.

The Demon Spirits and Demon Cores within the bodies of the Star Demons were extremely useful to him.

“I have finished absorbing the Demon Cores and Demon Spirits. Next, I have to continue searching for Star Demons to obtain new Demon Cores,” Jian Wushuang stood up and left the cave straight away.

At the void, as Jian Wushuang searched for the traces of the Star Demons, he also took out his transmission token to communicate with Hall Master Yuan at the same time.

Back then, Hall Master Yuan had looked for Jian Wushuang when he was absorbing the Demon Cores after having secluded himself in the cave. After knowing that Jian Wushuang had secluded himself in the cave to absorb the power of the Demon Cores, Hall Master Yuan did not disturb him. It was only after Jian Wushuang had completed his absorption that he contacted him again.

“Jian Wushuang, I heard that you have killed Real God Gu Ying of the Soaring Heaven King Palace while travelling in the inner layer of the Eighth Lair?” Hall Master Yuan’s voice was filled with laughter.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“How impressive. You are able to kill a Chaotic Real God after such a short period of time,” Hall Master Yuan was excited as well.

“It is because of the fact that he underestimated me that I was able to have my way,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Of course, his words were modest. Real God Gu Ying did not underestimate him and he used his full power right off the bat. Moreover, he had also teamed up with Real God Xue Ling. However, there was nothing that they could do as the gap between their abilities was too huge.

“Oh right. With the death of Real God Gu Ying, the Soaring Heaven King Palace will definitely be infuriated. I wonder if they have created some trouble for the Lineage of Star?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Of course they did. The Soaring Heaven King Palace even wanted the Lineage of Star to hand you over so that they could execute you. Haha, that was really funny.” Hall Master Yuan sneered, “Oh right. What exactly happened during that battle?”

“Real God Gu Ying and Real God Xue Ling had cast their greedy eyes on my Grade Three Demon Core. Thus, they took action straight away to kill me so that they could snatch it away from me. However, as their abilities were not strong enough, they were killed by me. It is just that simple,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Even though two Chaotic Real Gods had teamed up, one of them was still killed by you in the end?”

Hall Master Yuan managed to get a great piece of information from Jian Wushuang’s words. After that, he laughed, “I knew that you would not provoke the Soaring Heaven King Palace for no reason. As expected. Back then, Real God Xue Ling even said that you were the one who had cast your greedy eyes on Real God Gu Ying’s treasure. Hence, you took the initiative to launch a surprise attack to kill Real God Gu Ying. How shameless they are!”
