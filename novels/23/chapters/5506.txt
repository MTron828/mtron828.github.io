Chapter 5505: I’m Really Going to Be Rich

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation       Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the side, Emperor Tianxi wore a somewhat disdainful smile, though he refrained from commenting.

Jian Wushuang bid farewell to Wanyan and arrived in front of a teleportation array within the grand hall. This was the sole passage to enter the Beiwang

Tower.

“100 million cubic godstones!” declared the elderly guardian of the teleportation array, his voice icy.

Jian Wushuang readily handed over the godstones this time.

In return, the guardian handed him a jade slip.

Jian Wushuangs thought power gently probed the jade slip, and he finally understood why Wanyan had spoken as he did.

“With this jade slip, you can enter and exit freely. It can be used ten times, and afterward, it will automatically shatter. At that point, you’ll need to exchange it for a new one using your own points!” The elderly guardian spoke these words and then closed his eyes, unwilling to say more.

After investigating the jade slip, Jian Wushuang comprehended everything.

Upon entering the Beiwang Tower, for each level he passed, he would have an opportunity to comprehend the Origin Source of the Universe and earn 100 points.

Jian Wushuang was a Dao Lord, corresponding to the first 10 levels.

After passing these 10 levels, he would receive 1,000 points and 10 opportunities to comprehend the Origin Source of the Universe.

If he surpassed the 10th level, he could obtain double rewards.

For example, breaking through 1 level would yield 200 points and two opportunities to comprehend the Universe Origin Source.

Breaking through 2 levels would yield 400 points and 4 opportunities to comprehend the Universe Origin Source, and so on.

“Haha! l ‘ Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

This place truly was a treasure trove for him; he was about to strike it rich.

His laughter immediately drew the attention of many people, who looked over as if watching a fool.

The cold and indifferent Emperor guarding this place couldn’t help but sneer, but he didn’t bother with Jian Wushuang.

Only one person seemed confident in Jian Wushuang. Wearing a smile on his face, Wanyan knew that Jian Wushuang had truly struck it rich this time, and his smile wasn’t mocking but rather one of joy for the others success.

Emperor Tianxi set down his wine cup and casually remarked, “Brother Wanyan, your friend seems quite confident! ‘ I

“What do you think of his strength?” Wanyan asked casually.

“A tier 5 Emperor, but he falls far short compared to you. He should be able to reach the 46th level,” Tianxi, who had been around here for a long time, had a keen eye for people.

Wanyan laughed heartily. Reaching the 49th level was indeed commendable. The reason he hadn’t continued was that he had more important matters to attend to.

After resting for a moment and getting acquainted with Emperor Tianxi, he found him to be quite impressive, despite some arrogance.

Originally, upon seeing Jian Wushuang arrive, he had planned to leave, but now he decided to stay and observe.

“You have a keen eye. He’s only at the 46th level, still a long way from me,” Wanyan remarked with a smile.

Many people were unaware that Jian Wushuang was only a Dao Lord. He didn’t reveal it himself, and even a tier 6 Emperor couldn’t see through his true cultivation realm. If intentionally concealed, ordinary supreme-peak beings couldn’t discern his actual level.

There were many gazes fixed on Jian Wushuang, but they quickly shifted away. Such occurrences had happened many times before, and only a few could truly amaze everyone.

A few years ago, a tier 5 Emperor broke through to the 54th level, attracting a lot of attention, but he quickly disappeared.

Speculation arose that he might be an Inheritor of the most supreme peak on the Grave God Mountain.

On the Grave God Mountain, there were also several levels. The Ultimate Emperors naturally occupied the first level.

Then there were some experts in the special Origin Source Dao, such as those who followed the Myraid Daos or those like Broly, who excelled in the Dao of Transformation.

This is the 2nd level, and in fact, they are not much weaker than those on the

Ultimate Dao. Some of them are even more powerful than the Emperors on the Ultimate Dao.

Broly is a prime example. His strength is extremely formidable; as a tier 6 Emperor, he can easily kill some supreme-peak experts in the Earth Realms.

It’s almost like he’s a freak.

Next are the Emperors with second-grade Origin Sources. They are not too weak either, and some of them are extraordinary, like Zhen Wuyang and

Tongtian Buddha, who can break through to the 5th or 10th floor (or level).

But now they all have their own inheritances and don’t have time to come here!

In this Beiwang Tower, there are seven layers of Inheritors, two layers of strongmen from the Elder Palace, and the rest are the native Emperors.

Zhen Ling is eager to find talent and is willing to spend a price to help some promising native Emperors repair their Origin Sources.

The cost of this is much higher than freely plundering foreign Emperors.

Emperors from the outside world are eager to come in, but it’s not so easy for Emperors from other universes to come here, and Emperor-level powerhouses

will be rejected.

They can only plunder some Dao Lords or Grand Yan Immortals.

Yan Immortals are troublesome; they have to go through two screenings.

Zhen Ling can’t wait any longer; he is impatient to leave the Original Universe or, more precisely, to leave this River of Time and Space.

This place is like a remote and backward village, a wilderness.

Staying here is not only inconvenient for selecting Inheritors, but it also hinders these Inheritors from exploring space more effectively.

When a large number of tier 6 Emperors appear among the Inheritors, the Four Great Secret Realms also become somewhat constrained.

After all, these powerhouses can’t all stay in the Four Great Secret Realms!

In the vast river of time and space outside, there was nowhere as adventurous as the Four Great Secret Realms.

So, Zhen Ling was a bit anxious.

He wanted to quickly nurture a group of powerful beings, then eliminate the true master who suppressed the Original Universe, settling the cause and effect.

At that time, he could leave this time and space with the Qishen Temple, heading towards a more expansive world, perhaps even returning to the Moro dimension.

Of course, that was a story for another time.

Jian Wushuang, at this moment, became increasingly delighted.

On the walls of the external grand hall, there was a list.

The same list was also present in the jade slip.

At the top were the Dao Lords and Emperors.

Among the Dao Lords, the one leading the ranks was a formidable individual named ‘MO Long, who had already broken through the 6th level.

The second had only reached the 3rd level, lagging behind by half.

Among the Emperors, they started counting from the tier 4 Emperors because those of tier 1 to 3 wouldn’t bother coming here.

Those who could reach this point as Dao Lords were all exceptional geniuses.

Those below the tier 4 Emperors had weak potential.

In Jian Wushuangs view, anyone who didn’t directly reach the tier 4 Emperor after Dao Merge was not considered a genius.

Those who could achieve this directly after Dao Merge were the true powerhouses.

However, most Emperors would only reach tier 2 after the Dao Merge, which was the most common scenario.

Tier 1 Emperors were quite rare, and those who did often ended up being sharpening stones for those monstrous I)ao Lords and were killed by those heaven-defying Dao Lords.

There were also some who, after merging Dao, directly achieved the tier 3

Emperor, with most of them being Inheritors on the Grave God Mountain.

There were also a few who could directly reach the tier 4 Emperor, but they were relatively few.

As for directly entering the tier 5 Emperor, currently, only Hu Qing achieved that.

To directly enter tier 5 Emperor, first, the Spatial Origin Source had to reach a high realm. With this crucial factor, it was possible to accomplish it in one step.

However, Hu Qings level of abnormality was something Jian Wushuang had never seen before.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Back in the Great Desolate Wilderness, he entered the Dao in one step, which was simply absurd.

No wonder Zhen Ling had such high expectations for Hu Qing; there was a

reason for it.

Moreover, Hu Qing had always been one step ahead in cultivation..
