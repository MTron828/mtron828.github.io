Chapter 767: Jian Wushuang VS Yun Fan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The vast place had now quietened down.

The experts and disciples were all looking at Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the Void, in great fear.

They could not help it; what Jian Wushuang said really terrified them.

How could a Divine Realm expert dare to challenge the Great Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard?

After all, Yun Fan was at Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

Out of all the people there, who could be his match?

Even Yun Fan himself looked at Jian Wushuang with a startled look. But in the next moment, he started laughing hysterically.

“Haha, kid, are you sure you’re not sleep-talking?”

“Win you?”

“You’re just a Divine Realm expert, winning you is not even glorious. You know what, I once got a Puppet Fighter by chance and never used it before. Now, I’ll have it fight with you to test its power.”

After speaking, Yun Fan waved his hand, and a Puppet Fighter immediately appeared before everyone’s eyes.

The puppet was covered with purple gems and only had one mouth and a vertical eye on its head. After its appearance, its body began to expand at an alarming speed. In an instant, it grew to over 100 meters tall.

It gave off a terrifying aura.

“What…what kind of a Puppet Fighter is this?”

“It’s so big, too big.”

“Oh my god! A Puppet Fighter over 100 meters tall! Its aura is too strong, it’s already so far beyond Step One of the Eternal Realm, I’m guessing its nearing Step Two.”

The experts of the sects were all in shock.

Jian Wushuang’s expression remained cold. He lifted his head and looked at majestic Puppet Fighter covered in purple gems. In the next instant, his body moved suddenly.

He was so fast, it looked as if he was teleporting. His figure traveled through the Void. At the same time, he struck out his Emperor Sword.

Whoosh!

The sword light started to shine and in the next moment, the crowd saw that Jian Wushuang’s figure had already moved to behind the Puppet Fighter.

The Puppet Fighter’s aura was still overwhelming, but the crowd saw a clear sword scar on its waist. This scar broke its waist completely and its body was cut into two.

“How is this possible?” Yun Fan widened his eyes at his Puppet Fighter. Obviously, all that just happened were totally beyond his expectations.

Before he had enough time to be in shock, he heard a whooshing sound. A figure appeared out of nowhere in front of him.

“Secret Skill, Twilight!”

Jian Wushuang’s low voice rang in Yun Fan’s ears. By the time he realized it, he saw a cold sword light lighting up in front of his mid-brows. It was less than half a meter away from him.

“How fast!”

Yun Fan instantly narrowed his eyes. He was too close to the blade and had no time to fetch his own weapon. He could only shake his long sleeves violently, causing a strong wind to surge and form into a powerful dragon.

The dragon bellowed and charged towards Jian Wushuang with its mouth wide open.

Bump!

Yun Fan turned into a meteorite, smashing into the ground ferociously. When he reached the ground, he created a huge pit that was 10 meters deep.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang immediately dived toward the pit.

At the bottom of the pit, Yun Fan rose up to his feet and took out a black Stone Staff. However, he did not manage to get out of the pit in time.

“Secret Skill, Netherworld!”

Immediately, a net of terrifying sword lights covered the pit and fell mercilessly into the pit that Yun Fan was in.

Boom! The earth began shaking.

Some of the sword light hit the ground and created huge cracks on the floor instantly. These cracks then branched out in all directions.

Eventually, the whole ground, which covered a few kilometers, were filled with cracks. Countless blocks and rocks were sent flying in all directions like shooting stars.

The crowd in Firmament Territory were lucky to be standing above the void and not get hit.

Bang!

With another loud sound, a certain part of the cracked ground sunk in. Following which, two figures were seen, in the cloud of ashes, running into each other at the same time.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with killing intent and his Sword Essence seemed to be able to cut the sky open.

This shocking Sword Essence of his was then split into innumerable sword lights which shot towards Yun Fan.

Yun Fan’s aura rose tremendously at this moment. He spun the Stone Staff so fast as if it was causing the surrounding air to form a wheel of fast wind. At the same time, air flows were coming out from his body. They formed a stiff air shield to block off the sword light coming towards him.

While he was busy defending himself, Jian Wushuang had approached Yun Fan and was less than two meters away from him. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

With the two fighters so close to each other, they had to rely on their near-distance offensive ability to win. Jian Wushuang used to cultivate earnestly during his long years in the Underground Palace of the Eighth Tribe. His offensive ability had increased tremendously since then.

Jian Wushuang’s terrifying near-distance offensive ability was in full launch. He had turned into an unbeatable sharp sword.

The Emperor Sword that he was holding onto was a cold and dark Sword Edge. His body had turned into the sword’s blade and his every move was full of sword light.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Loud banging sounds rang through the skies. In just a short moment, Jian Wushuang and Yun Fan had exchanged over 100 moves.

Each of their exchanges produced a rigorous wave that awed all the onlookers.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang’s roar echoed again in the skies. After which, his thighs were seen kicking hard against Yun Fan’s back, as if they were a sword blade of a long sword. The terrifying strength caused Yun Fan to fall onto the disheveled ground once again.

Bump!

Another huge pit appeared.

Seeing this, the onlookers were all shocked.

Just several moments before, they had thought that Jian Wushuang was just joking when he challenged Yun Fan.

However…

With one strike, Jian Wushuang cut Yun Fan’s Puppet Fighter into two parts.

After that, he went up to Yun Fan directly. In just a few moves, he caused Yun Fan to smash into the ground below. Twice!

Twice!

What kind of strength was that?

After knocking Yun Fan into the pit again, Jian Wushuang finally ceased his attacks.

He gazed down at the pit with a stolid face.

Suddenly, a thundering roar sounded from the pit. Soon, the crowd was blinded by silver light. Following which, a huge figure rose up and appeared before everyone.

It was a Silver-armored Ancient God!

Yun Fan had transformed into an Ancient God!
