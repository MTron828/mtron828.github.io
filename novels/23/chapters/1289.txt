The dark clouds in the sky dispersed and the God Test, too, subsided entirely.

But on Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, including the surrounding void, was deadly silent!

It was silent as the grave, where one would be able to hear a pin drop!

Universe Gods from Dayu Palace, including Jian Wushuang, saw what happened earlier clearly but everyone was left speechless.

The transformation took place too quickly!

When they saw that the black turtle shell on Universe God Dong Men’s body resisted the gilded lighting, they subconsciously thought that there’s hope for Universe God Dong Men to pass through the God’s Test.

Who would have thought that Universe God Dong Men would vanish into thin air the very next moment?

“That’s, that’s fire test!”

A Universe God in the Second Heaven from Dayu Palace who was knowledgeable spoke and the void suddenly became noisy.

“It was really a fire test.” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang head too, “It was also a God’s Test but fire test is more terrifying by a few folds as compared to the thunder test. The second lightning that Universe God Dong Men dealt with consisted of slight fire test. Although it wasn’t complete, it went through the defense of black turtle shell and killed him!”

Jian Wushuang felt heavy hearted.

He was quite close to Universe God Dong Men. To see him ended up like that, Jian Wushuang naturally felt a heartache.

“That was the consequence of failing to pass through God Test!” King of Venomous Worms said coldly, “In any cultivation, Universe Gods are walking through Gate of Hell at this state. They are required to walk through it thrice. Once they pass through thrice, they could become the real top expert. But the three God Tests, one might die if they were to fail any of the God Tests.”

Jian Wushuang heard and shook his head in silence. The pressure that he carried became heavier.

Merely God Test itself was known to be a situation which one survived but nine died. Just like Universe God Dong Men who was already in the First Heaven, well prepared and even protected by the black turtle shell, ended up vanishing into thin air due to God Test. But, Jian Wushuang was going to undergo Inverse Cultivation Test, which was few times more terrifying than the God Test!

…

Universe God Dong Men failed to pass the God Test in the Second Heaven and ended up vanishing into thin air.

Although the outcome saddened many of them, they have no choice but to accept it.

It was a God Test after all. Every a Universe God had to face it.

The crowd surrounding the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle dispersed very soon. Everyone was in distress when they left.

Jian Wushuang left Tribunal Passing Pinnacle too and returned to the courtyard where he stayed. He just returned and he received a message from the White Sector God.

“Jian Wushuang, the palace master sent a message to you. You shall be prepared for a class at Fairy Palace in a month’s time.”

“It’s happening?” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands together and began to look forward to the class.

Jian Wushuang witnessed the dreadful God Test with his own eyes and he was dying to obtain some experience of passing through God Test from the Master of Dayu Palace.

A month’s time passed by quickly.

In Fairy Palace, Dayu Palace.

The Fairy Palace was where the Master of Dayu Palace teaches. It was a majestic hall. The Fairy Palace was normally closed but only opened when the Master of Dayu Palace teaches.

In front of the Fairy Palace, Jian Wushuang arrived ahead of time and waited patiently. Then, there were three other people next to him.

Jian Wushuang knew the three of them. They were all inner disciples of Dayu Palace and they were the utmost excellent ones, especially the leader among the three, the youth with evil charm who was in a red robe.

The youth with evil charm was called Chu Xiao. He was generally recognized as the top among all inner disciples in Dayu Palace, a definite genius.

There were many Universe Gods in the First Heaven in the palace and Chu Xiao was considered the first in capability. Even Universe God Dong Men who failed to pass through the God’s Test and fell, was a notch below as compared to Chu Xiao.

“You, are Jian Wushuang?” Chu Xiao looked at Jian Wushuang and asked.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

“I always hear people talking about you in Dayu. They say that your talent is no weaker compared to Universe God Qing Yang from Holy Prefecture. It’s a pity that you are still a Universe Master. After you break through and become a Universe God, I’d be delighted to meet up with you.” Chu Xiao said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows.

Chu Xiao had been traveling around and only rushed back two days ago. Hence, he didn’t have the chance to fight him.

From the sound of it, Chu Xiao obviously meant that Jian Wushuang who was of Universe Master level couldn’t spike any interest.

“Chu Xiao was stronger than Universe God Dong Men. Although I have improved tremendously over the past eighty years, I could barely fight against a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven. I could only run for my life when I fight against Universe God Dong Men. If I were to fight against Chu Xiao… I am really not his match.” Jian Wushuang knew where he stood.

Just then, there were two figures that flew over from the void before them. Then, they landed in front of the Fairy Palace.

Among the two of them, one was the White Sector God who was in charge of all affairs within Dayu Palace and the other one was a purple-haired youth who dressed luxuriantly and looked handsome.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and couldn’t help but looked at the purple-haired youth.

He lit his Soul Fire. His sensitivity to soul power was much stronger compared to everyone else at the scene. He could clearly feel that although the purple-haired youth was merely a Universe God in the First Heaven, the hidden aura was extraordinarily fierce. It was much stronger than any other Universe God in the First Heaven that Jian Wushuang had come across.

Even if compared to the number one inner disciple in Dayu Palace, Chu Xiao, the purple-haired youth seemed to be slightly superior!

“In Dayu World, stronger than Chu Xiao among the Universe Gods in the First Heaven, would he be…” Jian Wushuang’s pupils dilated in shock as he could guess who the other person was.

While Chu Xiao and the other two inner disciples of Dayu Palace, too, fixed their gazes at the purple-haired youth.

“Universe God Qing Yang!!”

Chu Xiao’s voice was cold but the aura in his body was surging.

That’s right. The person gained fame in Dayu World long ago and had always been known as the number one genius in Dayu World, Universe God Qing Yang!

Universe God Qing Yan had yet to live more than fifty-thousand years as of then!

But in the fifty-thousand years, he had risen in a massacre. He created a legend in the bloodbath.

Not only was his cultivation period extremely short, but his fighting power was also extremely ferocious!

He was merely a Universe Master then but he was generally recognized as the number one in Dayu World.

When he passed through his God’s Test and became Universe God in the First Heaven, he was known as the strongest among Universe Gods in the First Universe!

Just as Jian Wushuang had yet to rise up, there wasn’t any genius in Dayu World who could be compared to him.

Just like the inner disciples in Dayu Palace, many of them were geniuses but none of them were as dazzling as Universe God Qing Yang.

Even Chu Xiao who was the most impressive among the inner disciples, was slightly inferior compared to Universe God Qing Yang in terms of rising time and dazzling level.

Chu Xiao thirsted to vie with Universe God Qing Yang to see who was better but he never had a chance to. Then, he finally saw Universe God Qing Yang in person!
