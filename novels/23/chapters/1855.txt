Chapter 1856: Abysmal Palace

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the lofty palace, there was a total of over a dozen figures that stood there waiting.

Among the dozens of people, the one leading was a middle-aged man in a baggy green robe. The middle-aged man was tall and well built, and his aura was enough to shock an ordinary Emperor God.

His name was Wu Luo.

Palace Master Wu Luo, a Peak Emperor God in the twenty-fifth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list!

One should know that Emperor God Liu Guang, who Jian Wushuang had invited to destroy Deluge Fortress regardless of the price he paid, was only in the twenty-seventh place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

Palace Master Wu Luo was slightly stronger than Emperor God Liu Guang.

However, a strong existence like him was standing in reverence before a dark blurry figure floating in front of him.

The dark figure was very dark. When he was there, it was as though there wasn’t any light in the universe.

“Go ahead!”

“Go and kill Jian Wushuang.”

“There’s no reason for Lineage of Star to continue to exist.”

The dark figure said and his figure slowly dispersed.

Palace Master Wu Luo watched the blurry figure disperse in reverence. Then, he stood in front of the experts and waved, “Let’s go… to Star Land!”

Very soon, the news spread like wildfire in Sanctuary Alliance.

Abysmal Palace was going to attack Lineage of Star.

Every since the news of the Master of Star Palace’s death had spread, they had been standing at the heart of the struggle. However, as the news had yet to prove its veracity, it was still at peace. However, all forces and sects were eyeing Lineage of Star with hostility.

They were all waiting, waiting to see who was the one who loses patience first.

Who would be the bird at the head of the pack?

Then, Abysmal Palace obviously could hold back no more.

…

Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Niu Yun gathered at the hall.

“Abysmal Palace, who would have guessed it would be Abysmal Palace!”

Hall Master Yuan’s face grew grave.

One should know that although Lineage of Star had offended many forces and experts, Abysmal Palace wasn’t one of them.

Then, the forces and experts who harbored great resentment against Lineage of Star didn’t take action but Abysmal Palace was the first.

“Abysmal Palace, Abysmal Saint Master, I will remember this,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands as his eyes gave out a chilly gleam.

Abysmal Palace was one of the major forces in Sanctuary Alliance They were also the top three superb forces in terms of foundation and power among the forces in Sanctuary Alliance.

In terms of foundation, power, and fame, Abysmal Palace was much scarier than Soaring Heaven King Palace.

In Abysmal Palace, the number of Almighties alone was more than twenty and there were four Emperor Gods. As for Palace Master Wu Luo, he was in the twenty-fifth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

He wasn’t the scariest. The scariest was the founder of Abysmal Palace, Abysmal Saint Master, who was in third place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, who was on par with Red Dragon King, second to Emperor Bai.

They were already so powerful themselves. In addition, they had a Great Emperor who was in third place, Abysmal Saint Master, who backed them. Just how scary Abysmal Palace would be?

Under normal circumstances, even Soaring Heaven King Palace which was barbaric would exercise self-control when dealing with Abysmal Palace.

Abysmal Palace and Lineage of Star shared no resentment. During the Master of Star Palace’s massacre back then, Abysmal Palace hadn’t partaken in the war, nor had the Master of Star Palace killed any of their men. However, they were the first who took action against Lineage of Star.

Jian Wushuang immediately realized that Abysmal Palace wasn’t aiming for Lineage of Star but their main target was actually him!

Abysmal Saint Master wanted to kill him!

As for the reason behind it, Jian Wushuang was sure. Back when he had met Abysmal Saint Master in Deluge Fortress, he could tell that Abysmal Saint Master hadn’t liked him and held a faint murderous intention. However, the people in Sanctuary Alliance knew.

“Hall Master Yuan, only Abysmal Palace is coming after Lineage of Star alone?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It seems to be so on the surface,” Hall Master Yuan answered.

“On the surface? How about at the back?” Jian Wushuang asked closely.

“I have no exact answer. However, there must be many forces and experts that follow Abysmal Palace. However, before Abysmal Palace forces Lineage of Star to play our strongest trump cards, they won’t have the guts to take action,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I understand.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and there was billowing murderous intention in his eyes. He looked at the three Hall Masters in front of him and he spoke with a cold voice, “As Abysmal Palace is taking action, it was definitely Abysmal Saint Master who told them to. However, Abysmal Saint Master is a Great Emperor and he is restrained by Sanctuary Alliance. The fight between Lineage of Star and Abysmal Palace, no matter how ferocious the fight becomes, as long as we do not step foot in the lair of Abysmal Palace, he won’t get involved.”

“Plus, it was the Master of Abysmal Palace who took the initiative to attack Lineage of Star, so we won’t have to worry!”

“As Abysmal Palace wants to be the bird at the head of the pack, Lineage of Star can only go all out and knock it down!”

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, the three Hall Masters clenched their hands and let out a chilliness.

Lineage of Star was different from before. Even without the Master of Star Palace in the commanding position, they wouldn’t be bullied as one wished.

As Abysmal Palace wanted to come, they naturally would counterattack with full force.

“Hall Master Yuan, send a command down. Tell the experts and disciples of Lineage of Star who are on Star Land to immediately return to Universe Galaxy at their fastest speed. As for experts in other sanctuaries and wandering elsewhere, you don’t need to chase them back. Also, from now on, keep watch of Abysmal Palace. I want to know their every move,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan immediately sent down the command.

After receiving the command, the experts and disciples of Lineage of Star immediately returned to Universe Galaxy at their fastest speed.

Ten days later.

A huge warship appeared on Star Land. The warship didn’t conceal itself but plunged towards Lineage of Star’s lair at its top speed after it descended.

They charged forward very quickly and weren’t hindered at all.

Lineage of Star received the news the very moment they descended as well.

“Palace Master, Abysmal Palace is already in Star Land. They rushed over in a spaceship and according to the information that our spy got, there is a total of eighteen people in the spaceship. They are all Almighties. Among, there are three Emperor Gods and fifteen Sir Gods. They are led by Palace Master Wu Luo himself,” Hall Master Yuan reported solemnly.

“They arrived very quickly and there are so many experts. Three Emperor Gods, fifteen Sir Gods, this team formation…” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold.
