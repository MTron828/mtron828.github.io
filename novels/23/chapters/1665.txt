Chapter 1666: The Dark Region

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Soaring Heaven King Palace. In a lofty palace, many higher-ups of Soaring Heaven King Palace had gathered.

Previously, the higher-ups were already informed that Real God Zi Ye found Jian Wushuang. They were all waiting for the news from Real God Zi Ye that he killed Jian Wushuang.

They had absolute confidence in Real God Zi Ye.

After all, Real God Zi Ye was the top Chaotic Real God and he wasn’t far from the Real God ranking list. On the other hand, although Jian Wushuang had killed Real God Gu Ying previously and proved that he wasn’t weak, he was a Void Real God who just broke through, after all. Even if he was an inverse cultivator, even if he was unusual, he would only have the fighting power of a top Chaotic Real God at most.

They believed that with Real God Zi Ye’s power, he could definitely kill Jian Wushuang. The worst-case scenario would be Jian Wushuang fleeing.

The higher ups in Soaring Heaven King Palace thought so.

Just then, a man in a gold robe at the top of the palace looked surprised and a smile spread across his face, “Zi Ye sent a message back.”

“It seems that he has killed Jian Wushuang.”

“Real God Zi Ye is taking care of this personally. Of course, success is ensured.”

“Humph, Jian Wushuang is a genius. It’s a pity that he was too arrogant. He even dared to kill our people from Soaring Heaven King Palace. He deserved to die.”

Most of the Real Gods were chatting casually in the palace.

The man in a gold robe skimmed through the message that Real God Zi Ye had sent.

The smile on his face stiffened and he suddenly stood on his feet.

“Real God Zi Ye is being hunted by Jian Wushuang,” the man in a gold robe bellowed.

“What?” The Real Gods in the hall were dumbfounded.

“Palace Master, are you mistaken? It should be Real God Zi Ye chasing after Jian Wushuang, right?” One of the Chaotic Real God couldn’t help but ask.

“Who would make a mistake?” The blonde man’s hair blew like a raging lion. He roared, “Hurry up and tell Lineage of Star to send a message to Jian Wushuang. Tell him to stop immediately. Otherwise… If Real God Zi Ye were to die, no matter where he runs to, Soaring Heaving King Palace will kill him!”

“Yes,” someone answered immediately.

Real Gods in the hall stared with their eyes wide-open. They knew that they didn’t hear wrongly, but it was a fact.

…

“Real God Zi Ye was being chased after by Jian Wushuang?”

The news spread across Sanctuary Alliance in an instant, like a storm.

Of course, the news was sent to Hall Master Yuan in Lineage of Star at the first instant. Hall Master Yuan found it unbelievable as well, “Real God Zi Ye? He is the top Chaotic Real God and he is being chased after by Jian Wushuang? Did I hear this correctly?”

Full of doubt, Hall Master Yuan immediately sent a message to Jian Wushuang to ask about the incident.

Very soon, he received an answer. Real God Zi Ye was really being chased after.

“Jian Wushuang, what are you going to do with Real God Zi Ye?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“He must die!” Jian Wushuang’s replied in short.

“If so, kill him. You don’t need to worry about Soaring Heaven King Palace,” Hall Master Yuan gave Jian Wushuang a boost of confidence. Then, Hall Master Yuan replied to Soaring Heaven King Palace with a short message, “I’m sorry, I already texted Jian Wushuang, but he… didn’t reply.”

Soaring Heaven King Palace suddenly raged in anger.

The Eighth Lair, in the core region, Jian Wushuang was still chasing after Real God Zi Ye.

“Humph, Soaring Heaven King Palace’s Soaring Heaven Blood Law used up a lot of divine power and you were severely injured. I’d like to see how long can you run away for?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold and he was also calculating his divine power in secret.

He had spent quite a bit of divine power in the fight earlier and as he was chasing after Real God Zi Ye by performing the secret skill of Dragon Blood. Luckily, he had already accumulated five drops of ultimate divine power water droplet. Hence, his divine power was sufficient. Until then, he only used two drops and he still had enough divine power.

However, for Real God Zi Ye, Jian Wushuang was certain that his divine power was less than twenty percent.

“D*mn it! Jian Wushuang should have received a message from Lineage of Star, but why isn’t he stopping?” Real God Zi Ye’s face was pale and he was terrified. He could feel that the divine power in his body was growing lesser. Originally, there was twenty percent. Then, there was only ten percent left.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t force me!”

Real God Zi Ye turned around and let out a shrill scream.

“Force you? Hehe, you’re already at this stage but you’re so naive?” Jian Wushuang scoffed.

“Alright then. As you want me dead, I won’t let you live well either!” There was madness in Real God Zi Ye’s eyes. The next moment, he suddenly switched to another direction and plunged towards the other void.

“Real God Zi Ye, he is already in such a state, what is he trying to do?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

After a while, Jian Wushuang realized Real God Zi Ye’s real intention.

“This is the Dark Region?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed and he looked into the void before him.

The void was filled with darkness but not a slight bit of light. In the air, there was obviously denser black fog compared to other places. It was at least double the amount.

The Dark Region… it was a unique region in the Eighth Lair.

Very long ago, there was a war between Sanctuary Alliance and Star Demon Tribe and they came to the lair of Star Demon Tribe. In other words, they came to the Eighth Lair and foolishly attempted to exterminate all Star Demon entirely. However, in the Eighth Lair, there were some unique regions. In these regions, every an Almighty would be restrained. They couldn’t explore, nor could they kill the Star Demons within. Hence, the unique regions formed into Dark Regions.

The Dark Region, not only was the place where the most Star Demons gathered, but there were also other dangers in the Dark Region. In short, it was very dangerous.

With Jian Wushuang’s power, to wander in the Eight Lair, his life wouldn’t be threatened under normal circumstances. However, if he were to barge into the Dark Region, there were definitely many things that could kill him.

Then, Real God Zi Ye ran to the border of the Dark Region and plunged into the Dark Region.

“You thought I wouldn’t come after you if you were to run into the Dark Region? Such a joke!”

There was murderous intention flashing in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Although he knew the void before him was a Dark Region, he continued to chase after him without hesitation.

In the Dark Region, Jian Wushuang continued to chase after Real God Zi Ye. They continued the chasing game and ran quite a distance.

Very soon, Real God Zi Ye’s last ten percent of his divine power ran out too.

Without divine power, he couldn’t perform his secret skill anymore.

Real God Zi Ye’s body stopped into the black fog. He turned around to look at Jian Wushuang.
