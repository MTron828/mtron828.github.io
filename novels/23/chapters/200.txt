Chapter 201: Be My Protector

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Gu Yan, Zhang Kong, you two have been in discord for a long time, and this time, in the Sky Valley Battle, you two also led two different teams and took separate actions. But now, you’ve gathered together. Something must have happened... just tell me!” Ling Xueyu walked towards them with a slight smile.

Gu Yan and Zhang Kong looked at each other and smiled with resignation. Then they briefly told him the identity of Yang Zaixuan.

“Yang Tian?”

“You mean Yang Tian who ranks first in the Bounty List?”

Ling Xueyu was also astonished at first, but then he smiled, “No wonder you chose to join together. But it seems that you didn’t get much from the team of the Tianzong Dynasty?”

Both of Gu Yan and Zhang Kong countenance’s turned serious.

“Hmm, it is quite a shame that the combination of the two teams from our Cosmos Empire could do nothing to a team from a small empire.” Ling Xueyu sneered. “But that’s okay; it provides me with a chance to perform.”

...

Above the void, the monarchs from the 12 dynasties and the experts from the old sects were discussing the previous battle.

“The breath that woman burst out... Is she from that place?”

“It seems she is. Only people from that place can use such a special skill. What’s more, from the strength of her breath, she has a high position there.”

“Why did she, someone from that place, take part in the Easternmost Hunting of our Twelve Northwestern Dynasties?”

“Who knows?”

Knowing Su Rou’s background, the experts were all surprised.

“This time, Tianzong Dynasty’s disciples are at a rather high level. One owns the High Heaven Technique and can drive Heavenly Qi, and another one comes from that place... Both of them can be considered true, peerless geniuses!”

“Compared to them, their leader, Jian Wushuang, performed quite ordinarily in the Sky Valley battle.”

“Yes, the battle had lasted for so long, but Jian Wushuang showed no improvement in his strength!”

“I used to be optimistic about him as he’s still very young, but now... Compared with those two geniuses, he’s much weaker.”

“Mr. Ling Tian, you are so visionary.”

“Yes, Mr. Ling Tian looked down on Jian Wushuang since the beginning.”

Some experts from the old sects were flattering Mo Lingtian.

Glancing down at Jian Wushuang, Mo Lingtian sat on the chair and sneered coldly.

“Other geniuses mostly gained a few improvements as the battle went on. In his team, all the members except him gained improvements in both Essence Realm and Cultivation after the continuing slaughter; however, his strength remained the same.”

“He made no progress after the continuing slaughter. Is it really that he’s a genius?”

“Ridiculous!”

“In our Wilderness Sword Sect, even a disciple whose job is to sweep the floor is much more talented than him.”

Mo Lingtian kept being dismissive of Jian Wushuang all along.

During the whole battle, the only one he appreciated was Ling Xueyu.

“He’s not bad.”?Mo Lingtian looked down at Ling Xueyu.?“He was able to comprehend three sword essences at the same time and what’s more, one of them was the Sword Essence of Brightness, which is very rare. It’s quite good for him to combine the three sword essences at this age. In our sect, he can be considered barely qualified to be a core disciple .”

At first, Mo Lingtian didn’t intend to choose any disciples for the Wilderness Sword Sect, but recently, after watching Ling Xueyu’s performance in the Sky Valley, he slightly changed his mind.

.

In Sky Valley, after fighting with the experts of the Cosmos Empire, all members of Jian Wushuang’s team sat down on the ground to restore their spiritual power.

“Little sister,” Jian Wushuang looked at Su Rou and said, “Thanks a lot. If it weren’t you, we would have had no hope in surviving under the siege of the two teams from the Cosmos Empire.”

Yang Zaixuan, Baili Chen, and the other members also looked at Su Rou with gratitude.

Just now, Su Rou did save them.

“It’s not a big deal.” Su Rou looked pale. It was apparent that it also consumed a lot of her energy just now. “Third Brother, if I were not there, you would also still have led us out of that mess.”

Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang without any suspicion.

Jian Wushuang smiled and then he looked around.

“Everybody...” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice. “These days, it is our cooperation that has led us here. As a leader, actually, I didn’t lead you that much.

“Though I am ashamed, I have a presumptuous request.”

Hearing this, the five members around Jian Wushuang were all surprised as they looked at him.

“I request all of you to be my protectors,” Jian Wushuang said directly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Protector?” Yang Zaixuan and other members were all amazed.

“Third Brother, are you going to make a breakthrough?” Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang surprisingly.

“I fought with Gu Yan just now and gained a few insights. It seems that I’m going to make a breakthrough.” Jian Wushuang smiled with gratification.

Finally... he was going to make a breakthrough!

It was known that he had waited for this day for a long time.

Since combining three sword essences in the selection battle, he had met a huge bottleneck in improving his strength.

Although he tried many times to break through the bottleneck, he failed.

From the beginning of Easternmost Hunting to now, with the continuing battles and slaughter, the geniuses from other dynasties and even the geniuses in his team all made a breakthrough in their strength.

People like Yang Zaixuan and Feng Yutian had made even greater improvements in their strength.

How about Jian Wushuang?

From the beginning to now, he had made no progress.

It was not because Jian Wushuang was not talented enough, but rather because the bottleneck interfering with him was too huge.

The bottleneck stopped him from making any progress.

Once he broke through the bottleneck, his strength would reach a new and prominent level.

Now, the breakthrough he longed was coming!

“That’s so great!”

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, are you going to make a breakthrough?”

“Finally, you are going to make a breakthrough?”

Yang Zaixuan, Su Rou, Baili Chen, Feng Yutian, and Mu Yingying were all surprised.

They knew Jian Wushuang’s strength well and they all knew how amazingly talented he was.

Before the breakthrough, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was far beyond theirs and he also ranked top among the geniuses of the 12 dynasties. Once he made the breakthrough, his strength would reach new and prominent heights.

“Everybody, I promise...” Jian Wushuang said confidently, while looking at his team members.

“I request you to be my protectors, and after the breakthrough, I will lead you to sweep over the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties and create a brand new legend!”
