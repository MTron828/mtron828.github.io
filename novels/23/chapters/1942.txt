1943 Unaware Of The Oriole Behind

From the golden mountain to the golden dragon seal, the seventh Palace Master took out two golden spears.

The two golden spears carried extraordinary aura as well. They were also Chaotic Divine Treasure.

He really had a lot of treasure with him.

“Treasures are great, but in terms of his power, he is only an Emperor God after all. He would at most be similar to Palace Wu Luo from Abysmal Palace. Even with the assistance of the treasure, he definitely wasn’t Jian Yi’s match.

Jian Wushuang sneered when he looked at the other six Almighties nearby.

Jian Yi could take care of the seventh Palace Master, but these other six…

“Die!”

There was a flash of murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Then, four Hong Jung Golden Swords soared up at the same time. They instantly became four resplendent golden lights.

The four golden lights were unbelievably fast as they flew at the six Almighties.

“Die!”

“Kill him!”

The six Almighties were soaring with murderous intention. There was no fear in them. They immediately let their power into full play and fought with Jian Wushuang.

Although the six of them had teamed up, their powers were vastly different from Jian Wushuang’s.

Jian Wushuang only drove the four Hong Jun Golden Swords to attack rampantly and he killed four Sir Gods at lightning speed.

As for the remaining two Emperor Gods who had ordinary fighting powers, they didn’t last long either before they were killed by Jian Wushuang.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body floated in the void and the four Hong Jun Golden Sword returned to his sides as he looked down at the six dead bodies on the ground. However, he was shocked.

One should know that the six Almighties were obviously not his match. They would totally be suppressed if they fought with him.

However, the six Almighties had no intention to retreat even though they knew so. There was only madness that wanted to kill him.

“Almighties, every single one of that went through so much. They should look highly upon their lives. However, the six of them seem to have put their lives aside. What is going on?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Not only the six Almighties, but Jian Wushuang also noticed that the seventh Palace Master who was fighting with Jian Yi was the same.

He had played all his trump cards and he was still suppressed by Jian Yi. Theoretically, at such a crucial moment, he should run for his life. But in actual fact, he had no intention to flee.

Just then...

“Humph!”

The seventh Palace Master suddenly humphed coldly and the aura on his body suddenly increased at a terrifying speed.

“This is… Soul Ignition!” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed.

He wasn’t unfamiliar with soul ignition.

Back when he had invited Colored Glaze Emperor God and Emperor God Jiu Yin to Deluge Fortress, when they had besieged Fortress Master Hong Tian, he had been cornered into a desperate situation and he performed soul ignition and swore to counterattack. But in the end, Jian Wushuang and his troops had killed him.

Once one soul was ignited, his overall power would increased tremendously in a short period of time.

However, the price to pay was definite death!

Only an expert who was above peak Emperor God could pull off that move. If one wasn’t at a final desperate situation, no one would do so.

Then, although the seventh Palace Master was cornered by Jian Yi, he would stand no chance to flee with all the treasures and trump cards that he had. But he soul ignited to counterattack without hesitation?

“He’s mad!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Jian Wushuang, I want you dead!!”

The mask on the seventh Palace Master shattered and revealed an old, ugly face. The face was then distorted and ferocious looking.

Because of soul ignition, the power that he let out had reached a brand new level.

In collaboration with the treasures he had… His fighting power was extraordinary.

“Jian Yi, block him!” Jian Wushuang roared.

Jian Yi naturally wouldn’t hesitate to go forward and fight a fierce battle. Plus, he put his full power on display.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There was continuous explosions that resounded in the universe. The sky was filled with divine power and the floating land quivered madly.

Luckily, there were countless cultivators on the land that fled faraway. Otherwise, the battle could destroy everything on land.

There was another explosion and the floating land shattered into pieces entirely.

“Jian Wushuang! Jian Wushuang!!!!”

An angry roar reverberated in the universe. The hysterical roar brought about boundless madness and unwillingness.

“This man…” Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze at the seventh Palace Master solemnly as his face grew distressed.

He felt glad that he had brought Jian Yi with him. The seventh Palace Master couldn’t break through Jian Yi’s guard and come before him even if he soul ignited.

But, if he was alone…

His power of seven star had yet to recover. There were many trump cards that he had yet to perform. If he were to fight against the seventh Palace Master at such a crucial moment, he might really be in danger.

Time flew past. After a while, the seventh Palace Master’s consciousness started fleeing along with his ignited soul. They started to disperse.

After a while, the seventh Palace Master’s aura finally vanished into thin air and he died.

“Is he dead?”

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief, “Oh yeah, his treasure…”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed. The seventh Palace Master had many treasures, he immediately wanted to go forward.

Suddenly… Just as he approached the seventh Palace Master’s dead body, the surrounding dark void suddenly shattered. Then, a ghostly figure leaped out from the broken void. Then, she waved and took the seventh Palace Master’s dead body along with his Qian Kun ring and his treasures.

“Courting death!”

Jian Wushuang grew distressed and the four Hong Jun Golden Sword burst out.

Jian Yi, who was near to the seventh Palace Master’s dead body, plunged forward as well.

The ghostly figure smirked coldly and dodged. Her body moved to somewhere far away.

The four Hong Jun Golden Swords and Jian Yi’s attack missed.

“Sword Emperor, don’t be angry,” there was a soft voice. The person steadied herself and it was an old lady in black robe. Although she was only a Sir God, she gave Jian Wushuang a strange feeling

Forget about the others, the old lady in the black robe had been hiding in the surrounding dark void for so long but both Jian Wushuang and Jian Yi didn’t notice her at all. She shouldn’t be belittled by that factor alone.

“Who are you?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold as he looked at the old lady in the black robe.

“It doesn’t matter who I am. Sword Emperor, you only need to know that I come at my master’s command. My master’s surname is Leng. Sword Emperor should know her,” the old lady in black robe smiled as she spoke.

Jian Wushuang’s body stiffened at her speech.

Surname Leng?

“Lord Leng?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was turned cold.

“Lord Leng? No, no, my master is no longer the Lord but… Holocaust Sect Master!!”
