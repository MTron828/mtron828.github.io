Chapter 2465: Evolution of Heaven and Earth

In the Divine Power Ocean, many sect disciples were still there to absorb divine powers.

Suddenly, with a loud boom...

The terrifying life rating pressure instantly spread and covered every disciple in the Ocean.

All the disciples in the Ocean drew their breath, and raised their heads one by one in horror, staring at the pressure source.

“What is that?”

“What’s going on?”

“I-I feel my soul is about to burst.”

Numerous cries of terror sounded one after another.

If one could easily withstand the oppressive aura of a cultivator they had a strong character and perseverance to resist, but it was impossible to resist the pressure from life ratings.

Jian Wushuang was the second Perfect Chaotic Creature born between Heaven and Earth and had become the one and only.

His life rating was higher than everyone else.

No one was capable of resisting the pressure from his life rating.

In the Divine Power Ocean, many genius sect disciples were groaning. They were looking toward the direction where Jian Wushuang was and could not help but worship him with a trembling heart.

That action was done against their wills as their bodies had betrayed them and were beyond their control.

“That direction! That’s where Little Brother is!” Zhuo Bing cast her eyes over at the pressure source as she quivered.

“It’s indeed where Junior Brother Wushuang is. What exactly happened to Junior Brother Wushuang?” Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and the others were at a loss.

Nevertheless, they were unable to find out as they were also unable to move their bodies.

In the hidden independent space of the tomb.

“This...”

Who the hell is he?”

What kind of a monster is he?”

What’s going on with this pressure?”

The Crimson Stone Saint was completely struck in awe.

His expression was horrified and blank as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

Even he could feel a sense of fear that rose from the deepest part of his soul under the intense pressure. He was also unable to move his body.

The life rating pressure was overwhelming even to Crimson Stone Saint.

It was not something that he could overcome.

However, what appeared even more unbelievable to him as that life rating pressure kept rising and becoming more powerful. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The pressure quickly got out of Crimson Stone Saint’s control; covering the entire tomb; and soon rushed out of Saint’s Tomb.

On the glade outside the Saint’s Tomb.

Experts from various sects, including those genius disciples who had crushed their Safety Token and came out in advance, remained to wait.

Everyone was waiting for their genius disciples to come out of the tomb. More importantly, was of course waiting for that one person.

That person was none other than Jian Wushuang.

The world seemed to be peaceful during the long wait.

Suddenly, a loud boom sounded!

The pressure originating from the life rating spread out from the tomb and towards the glade.

On the glade, expressions of those various sects’ experts drastically changed under the intense pressure.

“Who is emitting this pressure?”

“It’s so unique. It’s obviously not coming from an expert, yet it makes me subservient to it. My heart quivered under the pressure. Who exactly is it?”

“Who emitted that kind of pressure? Is that from an Ultimate God or the Crimson Stone Saint?”

The experts from various sects on the glade rose in an uproar.

No one could remain calm under the pressure.

Regardless of First-Class Divine Demon or Peak Divine Demon, the pressure touched a soft spot in their hearts and made them want to subconsciously worship it.

As the pressure continued increasing and expanding, the thoughts in their hearts became stronger.

Their faces changed drastically.

At that instant...

“Look, look up at the heavens!” An exclamation came from a Peak Divine Demon expert.

Everyone immediately looked above and was shocked.

The world up in heaven had changed its color. Thunderclouds billowed from all directions, thick and deep purple thunderbolts the size of buckets made a rumbling sound. Those deep purple thunderbolts sent everyone who was present down below into shock and shivers.

Without warning, two of the dark purple thunderbolts collided. The impact did not produce much movement, but an electric bolt formed and swept down onto the glade down below.

Boom! All of a sudden...

The vacant piece of land instantly disappeared, leaving only a bottomless pit filled with scorched soil with no traces of vitality left.

“My goodness!”

“Such power... even an Ultimate God expert would not survive under this thunderstrike!”

“This is the effect of just a fragment of the thunderstrike!”

The various sects’ experts on the glade were horrified.

The Heavens above rumbled as a series of deafening roars sounded one after another. It was the roar of Heaven and Earth. The Heavens was bellowing in rage!

The terrifying pressure went crashing down and was about to annihilate everything completely.

“That’s Heaven’s Will. The pressure of Heaven’s Will!”

A hysterical voice emerged from above the plain.

The experts of the various sects reacted immediately.

“Yes, it is Heaven’s Will!”

“This kind of pressure must be from Heaven’s Will!”

“Who is it, who the hell is causing Heaven’s Will to make its presence?”

“Who had violated the Way of Heaven?”

“Who the hell is it!”

Countless experts bellowed.

Heaven’s Will was in control of the Heavens. It was the supreme power in Heaven and Earth!

According to legends, in the early days of the Ancient God Realm, whenever something that could pose a certain threat and affect the cycle of the Heavens emerged, the Heaven’s Will would make its presence to suppress that threat completely. It was to ensure that the Heavens could continue its cycle in a proper manner.

Then again, it was merely a legend.

In reality, who on earth had the abilities to tip the balance of Heaven and Earth? Or worse, to affect the cycle of the Heavens?

It was impossible, entirely impossible.

Even if there was, perhaps there would be only one or two in hundreds of millions of years.

What was happening right before their eyes were clearly influenced by Heaven’s Will!

No one had seen such a momentum before!

The Divine Demon experts present submitted themselves quietly and hung their heads low under Heaven’s Will.

They could only grumble and complain in their hearts.

Who the hell went against Heaven’s Will?

Who the hell had the abilities to cause Heaven’s Will to make its presence?
