Chapter 979: The Gloves are off!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang had thought that Master Ku was only here for revenge, but now it appeared that he was also a messenger.

“Jian Wushuang, the Temple Master specifically asked for you specifily, and this almost never happened before,” Master Ku continued, “so take some time to think about it. I’m sure you know how awesome the Void Temple is. After all, your Senior Brother is one of us. And if you join too, you’ll be a Master, and it won’t be long before you could be an Elder.”

Jian Wushuang was pleased, but he didn’t reply.

“Like I said, think about it. If you decide to join us, just break this token and the Void Master will know, and he’ll send someone to pick you up,” Master Ku said, handing the token to Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you. And please tell your Master that I’ll think about it,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Will do. See you around.”

Master Ku left immediately after he finished.

Jian Wushuang watched him walk away and then he put away the token before he turned his gaze toward the camp of the three big countries.

Many experts were there, and the most powerful three were Ape Holy Master, West Paradise Emperor, and Nan Emperor.

These experts were now very disappointed.

They had expected Master Ku to kill Jian Wushuang or at least force the youth to use his full strength, but it turned out that Master Ku was unable to do any of that.

Not even hurting him.

Not at all.

He could not kill him even when Jian just stood still and did not fight back.

“We’ve got company,” Ape Holy Master said.

And then it happened...

“Yo, experts of the three big countries.” A loud voice reached their camp.

It was of course Jian Wushuang’s voice. He was in the Void outside the royal palace. He crossed his arms and looked at them, “Like I said before, you’ve got to give me an answer within three days; it’s been two, have you thought of an answer?”

The three experts were obviously annoyed, but they still moved toward Jian Wushuang. They stopped when they were less than 30 meters away from him.

Any of the experts could cover that distance in an instant.

“This kid didn’t even flinch; he isn’t backing off. Isn’t he afraid of us at all?” Ape Holy Master murmured with a frown.

“We’ve seen his defense ability. Even Master Ku couldn’t hurt him, why should he be afraid of us?” West Paradise Emperor replied, “Even you will have trouble killing him.”

Ape Holy Master nodded and thought.

“Yes, indeed.

“Although I’m a Holy Master, it’ll still be hard for me to kill Jian Wushuang.”

“Correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t you the three bosses of the three big countries? And the Holy Master in the middle is Ape Holy Master,” Jian Wushuang said confidently.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Ape Holy Master opened his mouth, his voice was dignified.

“You want an answer?

“Why should we give one to you?

“Because of your achievements 1,200 years ago?”

Ape Holy Master asked, each word more powerful than the previous one.

“Wasn’t that enough?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Nope, not even close!” Ape Holy Master shouted. “Don’t try to fool me, you were something 1,200 years ago, but it wasn’t all you. You used some special tricks, and I’m guessing it was precisely because of that, your body exploded into a blood fog.

“Those special tricks were hard to use for the first time. It’s impossible for you to use them again.

“So tell me, why should I answer to you?”

Ape Holy Master was correct.

Tang of the East could not stand against the three big countries, and if Jian Wushuang had not used those special tricks years ago, it would have been impossible for him to stop them. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang knew it all.

“You’re right, I can’t use those tricks anymore,” Jian Wushuang said smilingly. “If you still want to destroy our country, so be it, but I have to point out something.”

He took a deep breath and then said in a sonorous voice.

“You can continue attacking us, you can continue besieging our royal palace, and you can take away our 36 prefectures. We don’t have the power to fight back.

“But as long as Dao Master Spirit’s formation is in place, you can’t come in, and you can’t kill us all. Our top-level experts can be well protected.

“And as you begin to attack the royal palace, I’ll leave.

“I’ll go away to find ways to improve myself.

“I’m confident that within 1,000 years I can become a Dao Master, and within 10,000 I could become a Holy Master.

“And I’ll come back for you, and when I do, you’ll be the first ones I kill. I swear, I’ll hunt you down no matter what!

“And I’ll make the three big countries disappear.

“Time is all I got, let’s see what happens!”
