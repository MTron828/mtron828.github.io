Chapter 2435: Besieged

“Little Brother, are you thinking of...” Zhuo Bing frowned and looked at Jian Wushuang. She had figured out what Jian Wushuang was about to do.

“Just leave it to me and don’t worry. I know what I am doing.” Jian Wushuang gave her a reassuring smile.

Zhuo Bing contemplated and sighed. “Okay, but you must be careful. If it doesn’t work, hand over one or two of those tokens.”

“I know. I have Pang Tao’s safety token now. If there’s danger, I’ll just crush the safety token and leave,” said Jian Wushuang.

Zhuo Bing finally gave in.

“We’ll go now.”

Zhuo Bing signaled the rest and walked towards the battlefield’s edge with Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong.

“Let them go.”

The crowd around immediately gave way.

Those genius disciples were after the position tokens and saw Zhuo Bing giving hers to Jian Wushuang. They have decided to only deal with Jian Wushuang since all the three position tokens were with him, hence they could not wait for Zhuo Bing and the others to leave.

After Zhuo Bing and the rest walked out of the crowd, they stood at the battlefield’s edge and watched instead of leaving the area.

“Junior Sister, are we really just watching from here?” Ling Dan sought confirmation from Zhuo Bing.

“We can only place our trust in Little Brother. Besides, you’ve seen his strength and power. We may not be able to help much,” said Zhuo Bing.

“Miss Zhuo Bing is right. Junior Brother Wushuang has been hiding his true potential from the beginning. No one knows how strong he is exactly. Judging from his confident look, the many genius disciples might not be able to harm him at all. We just have to look from afar for now. Besides, Junior Brother Wushuang has Pang Tao’s safety token. He can just crush it if he senses danger,” added Zhong Yi.

Zhuo Bing and the others had left the battlefield while Jian Wushuang remained encircled by those genius disciples from various sects.

The three position tokens are in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Those genius disciples present were greedily eyeing the three tokens.

Jian Wushuang flipped his hands, and the three position tokens went into his Interspatial Ring.

That provoked those genius disciples around with their expressions turning ugly.

“Jian Wushuang, we respect your ability and have agreed not to snatch the first token from you and your group. Don’t push our limits.”

“Yes. Although you are capable, push past our limits and we’ll go after you. When that happens, it will be your dead end.”

“Jian Wushuang, I advise you not to be so full of yourself.”

A few First-Class Divine Demons started yelling.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly as he swept his gaze around. “The three position tokens are indeed in my hands, but I can’t hand over the tokens for nothing. If you really want them, come and grab it from me.”

“So bold!”

“Since you are so stubborn, you can’t blame us.”

“Let’s kill him together!”

“Kill him and all the three tokens will be up for grabs!”

“Attack!”

About hundreds of genius disciples from various sects charged at the same time!

Among them, there were nearly ten First-Class Divine Demons!

They believed with their combined attacks a true Peak Divine Demons, even a top-tier one would not be spared.

“Let’s do it!”

Zhuo Bing and the others were solemnly watching from outside the battlefield with some worries in their hearts.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Suddenly, an overwhelming attack came down on Jian Wushuang.

The attacks came from all directions and there were so many of them that Jian Wushuang could not avoid it all.

Nonetheless, Jian Wushuang did not intend to avoid them at all.

With the strength of his right arm, his Blood Mountain Sword hummed softly and a majestic sword essence manifested itself.

With him achieving the Complete Sword Principle Realm, Jian Wushuang’s sword essence was more powerful than before.

The sword essence greatly influenced his surroundings.

Jian Wushuang himself seemed to have evolved into a black hole that was able to consume everything.

In the middle of the black hole, a bunch of sword lights came forth.

The sword lights were ferociously firing out like a rain of swords.

Those atrocious attacks that were aimed at Jian Wushuang were instantly drowned by the rain of swords.

The attacks were soon sent scattering in all directions.

That was Xuanluo Swords Principle...The Qi Coalesce!

“Did he just parry off all our attacks with a sword principle?”

“His swordsmanship is powerful.”

“Be careful, don’t let him escape.”

The many genius disciples around began to locate where Jian Wushuang was, albeit just recovering from the shock.

After the sword rain dissipated, Jian Wushuang’s figure magically moved.

Wow!

Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared in a void. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Nearly 20 genius disciples in the void’s vicinity immediately reacted. Rumble—a series of attacks were fired.

Nonetheless, Jian Wushuang did use any sword principle to resist these attacks. He submitted himself to the assaults instead.

The attacks shuttled past his body without touching any substance. That was obviously not Jian Wushuang’s body.

“He’s there!”

“No, he’s there.”

“There is also one here.”

A series of exclamations sounded and the many geniuses who besieged Jian Wushuang discovered that five Jian Wushuangs appeared on the battlefield at the same time.

Adding in the one that they had just launched an attack on, there should be a total of six images.

Those six Jian Wushuangs were exactly the same in appearance and demeanor. They could not tell which one was real.

“These are Space-time shadows. Only those who had learned and apprehended Space-time Law could do this!”

“Goodness and he can create six Space-time shadows at the same time. He must have a great understanding of Space-time Law, perhaps he’s very close to the First Stage Space-time Apparition.”

“Space-time apparitions can only trick the naked eyes, but not one’s soul. With soul power[1], you can discern which of these six are merely shadows.”

Those genius disciples released their soul powers in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

However, what their souls found...

“All six are shadows!”

“How could that be?”

“There, his real body is there!”

An exclamation sound came abruptly, and everyone looked around only to find that on a hill at the edge of the battlefield, a young man holding a sword was watching them with interest.

That person was Jian Wushuang!

While they were busy identifying which of these six shadows was Jian Wushuang, he had already broken free from their siege and went to the battlefield’s edge.

[1] Soul Power 灵魂之力: In the original text, it was written as 令狐之力 which could be translated as ‘Fox Order Power’. However, it seems inconsistent with the following sentences which mentioned soul power, hence we believed that there might have been a typo and have taken the liberty to amend this term to ‘soul power’ instead.
