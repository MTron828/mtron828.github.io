Chapter 5141 - 5141: The Emperors Appear

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The state of heart was like the Heart power. It could not be touched or seen by others. It seemed useless, but in reality, it was needed everywhere.

If Xiang Bingyun had a stable state of heart, he wouldn’t have had his mental state shattered by Jian Wushuangs sword, causing his strength to plummet by

30 percent.

Perhaps, this was a flaw in these revived powerhouses; their anger had annihilated their composure.

One was filled with determination, the other contemplating retreat but unwilling to accept it, their positions clearly defined.

Buzz!

Xiang Bingyun couldn’t hold on any longer. In this moment, he recalled Gu

Yuan’s fate and hurriedly struck his own chest, attempting to clear his mind.

“Traitor, how dare you deceive me!” Xiang Bingyun roared in anger, yet his body kept retreating. He genuinely didn’t want to continue this fight.

Moreover, he had been away for too long. This place was close to the Gret Si Region, and with Zhen Wuyangs speed, he could return at any moment.

These two individuals, with such power, must be Princes from some faction. Especially Jian Wushuang, who once exuded Zhen Wuyangs aura, even though it was absent now. But if he was a sitting Prince of Zhen Wuyang, his temperament being what it was, he would undoubtedly notice their absence if he came to the Great Desolate Wilderness. If someone was left alone outside, they would surely perish.

Little did he know that Zhen Wuyang had long arrived in the Great Desolate Wilderness, aware of their situation but utterly indifferent. In Zhen Wuyangs eyes, only absolute strength mattered; Emperors, Heavenly Courts, they were all mere passing clouds.

However, Xiang Bingyun was ignorant of all this, and at this moment, he made up his mind.

“Let’s go!’Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xiang Bingyun retreated and then concealed himself in the void. After a ripple in space, he vanished.

“Gone?” Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised. Just like that, he left?

Just after Xiang Bingyun left, the space where Jian Wushuang and the others were distorted and changed.

Several majestic figures became faintly visible, then instantly solidified.

In the last moment, these majestic beings were still far from Jian Wushuang and the others. But in an instant, their figures and pressure arrived, followed by their physical bodies.

A wail!

A faint Buddhist chant echoed through the void.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang was utterly astonished.

Every one of these majestic beings gave him a unique feeling that was exclusive to Zhen Wuyang. It was the peculiar aura of an Emperor.

So many Emperors?

Jian Wushuang felt uneasy, but his keen intellect made him realize instantly that these beings didn’t come for him. It must be because of that mysterious ancient temple and the revived entity.

But even if that revived being was an Emperor, it shouldn’t have attracted so many Emperors here!

Surprised though he was, Jian Wushuang maintained the necessary respect for the powerful figures around him. He immediately bowed deeply. “Junior, Great Si Region, Jian Wushuang,” he introduced himself, feeling the weight of the gazes from the Emperor-level experts in the room. He continued after taking a breath, “l greet all the Emperor Lords.”

“Virtuous!” The leader of the group was none other than the Heaven-Reaching Lord Buddha.

Heaven-Reaching Buddha’s towering body emitted endless golden fate energy. He looked at Jian Wushuang and said with a faint smile, “Little Virtuous one, there’s no need to be so polite.”

“Thank you, Emperor.” Jian Wushuang had roamed through countless realms and had seen many big scenes. However, this was the first time he had seen so many Emperors.

Emperor Dongyan, who was standing next to the Heaven-Reaching Buddha, did not care about this. He even despised the Heaven-Reaching Buddha for being hypocritical in front of the younger generation. In his opinion, the Heaven-Reaching Buddha loved the so-called etiquette the most. He wanted everyone to worship him.

The little monk, who had regained his senses, also came to his senses. He quickly put his palms together and lowered his head slightly. “Lord Buddha!”

Wulliang Buddha’s eyes were wide open at this moment. He looked at the little monk and said in surprise, “Hu Qing, you’ve comprehended an Ultimate Dao?”

The little monk had lived on Wuliang Mountain since he was young. Although there were hundreds of millions of monks living on the mountain, as the emperor, he knew every single one of the monks living in his Dao arena.

“Yes!” At this moment, the little monk’s expression was calm, and his obsession with Buddhism had faded. Instead, the zen in his heart had allowed him to comprehend the Dao.

“This is extraordinary goodness!” Although Hu Qing belonged to the Wuliang Mountain, in the eyes of the Buddha, he was the holy land of the Buddha realm. Hu Qings comprehension of the Ultimate Dao was a blessing for their Buddhist sect.

“Yes! For how many years, there hasn’t been another who attained the seventh level of the Ultimate Dao within the 3,000 Worlds.” Emperor Dongyan also discerned the profound aura emanating from Hu Qing. It was clearly a certain form of the Ultimate Dao, and it seemed that he had traveled quite far along this path.

Upon careful observation, Wuliang Buddha also noticed the considerable progress Hu Qing had made on the Ultimate Dao.

“Indeed, just as I expected. Impressive,” Wuliang Buddha said, his surface displaying a pleased expression, but deep down, he harbored a hidden threat.

“30 million years, and he has reached the sixth level of the Ultimate Dao.

When Hu Qing returns to the 3,000 Worlds, he can select any Emperor

Supreme Technique from our Wuliang Mountain,” the Heaven-Reaching Buddha praised and then turned to the Wuliang Buddha, saying, “Wuliang, with Hu Qings talent, he can be appointed as an Emperor’s successor.”

Originally a novice monk under the Wuliang Mountain, Hu Qing had received all the compliments from the Heaven-Reaching Buddha. Emperor Dongyan shook his head in amazement. Regardless of whose disciple they were in the 3,000 Worlds, discovering a practitioner who comprehended the Ultimate Dao was cause for celebration.

Emperor Dongyan regarded Hu Qing with a much gentler expression. He could sense that Hu Qings disposition was unlike that of Wuliang or

Heaven-Reaching. Instead, it was an innate quality, one he found increasingly endearing.

As he looked at this young successor, he couldn’t help but think of his own disciple from ages past.

That disciple was his pride and joy. In just a million years, he had attained the seventh level of the Ultimate Dao, becoming the most talented Grand Yan Immortal in the history of the 3,000 Worlds.

A million years, the seventh level of the Ultimate Dao, reaching the peak of the

Perfected Nine Revolutions of cultivation—such accomplishments were unimaginable before. Even Jian Wushuang wouldn’t have dared to assert that he could achieve this in a million years, even with his confidence in mastering the Extreme Dao and Heart power now.

Unfortunately, this genius, who had once captured the imagination of the entire world, succumbed to emotional turmoil. His shattered heart led to an unstable state of heart, rushed attempts at fusion, and ultimately, a failed fusion, which forever denied him the opportunity to advance to the Emperor-level.

Emotions, Dao, both damaged. In the end, he self-destructed, his consciousness utterly annihilated.

Since that incident, Emperor Dongyan had refrained from accepting personal disciples.

Even though the world might have forgotten that disciple’s name, the

Emperor had never forgotten him. He remained in Dongyan’s heart.

“A heavenly miracle.”

The attention of the Emperors was fixed on the young samanera. For the moment, Jian Wushuang was left forgotten. Yet, he didn’t mind.

The others assumed Hu Qing took 30 million years to reach the sixth level of the Ultimate Dao, while Jian Wushuang, a newcomer, had directly stepped into the sixth level of the Ultimate Dao. Although the truth was different, Jian Wushuang chose not to correct their misunderstanding.

“So, this young benefactor saved you, I presume!” Wuliang Buddha said with a smile, looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” the young samanera Hu Qing replied softly..
