Chapter 1148: That Person

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After hearing Gu King’s words, Jian Wushuang was speechless with amazement.

“Even the Jin Kingdom could manage to accumulate so many treasures. The Green Fire Palace must’ve uncovered a surprising amount of treasures here.

“As for the most precious ones, they must be in the hands of the five Palace Masters,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s drop the subject now, Gu King. Tell me the use of this Soul Gem,” said Jian Wushuang.

“It stores Strength of Soul, and her Soul Gem clearly still contains some Strength of Soul inside itself. She can use her consciousness to channel the strength out to launch an attack on you. Jian Wushuang, this is an attack fueled by Strength of Soul. You have to be careful,” said Gu King.

“So this is a Soul Attack?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted, but he did not look frightened.

“Go die, Jian Wushuang,” Tianhuan King shouted in a loud deep voice.

In the meantime, the Strength of Soul flowed out of her Soul Gem, formed a spine and then rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

“What an idiot. It’s really stupid to use Strength of Soul in this way,” Gu King observed. “Jian Wushuang, you don’t need to do anything to fend off this Soul Attack, because it can never hurt you.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang had intended to use his own Strength of Soul to fend it off before, but now he gave up that plan and let the spine hit him directly.

The next moment, he stood in the void, his eyes slightly closed.

“Is he dead?” someone asked.

Tianhuan King did not reply. Instead, she fixed her gaze upon Jian Wushuang, her face extremely pale.

As she herself had not yet acquired any Strength of Soul, she found it really painful to control such an advanced strength with her consciousness and barely managed to launch the Soul Attack.

After a while, she said, “I’ve used my Soul Gem to launch an attack on him. This is Soul Attack. It’s far more powerful than a regular consciousness attack. Even a Universe Master can’t withstand it, let alone a Dao Master. He must be…”

She was stunned before she finished her sentence.

In the void in front of her, Jian Wushuang reopened his eyes and winked mockingly at her.

“That’s impossible! That’s impossible!” Tianhuan King screamed in disbelief.

She did not know that Jian Wushuang who adopted the method of Inverse Cultivation was much stronger than an ordinary Dao Master. More importantly, she had no idea that he had already ignited his Fire of Soul.

Once someone ignited his or her Fire of Soul, he or she would be endowed with Strength of Soul.

Under the guidance of Tianhuan King, the Strength of Soul stored in the Soul Gem could give a devastating blow to an ordinary Universe Master but could hardly affect Jian Wushuang, since he had already ingnited his Fire of Soul.

After enduring the attack, he was still alive and well.

However, he did not have much energy left after enduring so many attacks. He decided to escape from the clutches of the three kings.

“Well, I’ve seen what you can do, Universe Masters, so please allow me to excuse myself now,” Jian Wushuang said smilingly to the three kings and then turned around, ready to take his departure.

“You want to escape? No way!” Golden Rock King shouted while drawing his Blood-Deadly Longbow.

In the meantime, Tianhuan King and Tiaanying King also rushed toward him combatively.

They were both impressed and threatened by Jian Wushuang. In their eyes, he possessed even stronger deterrence than Sunrise Sword Emperor did.

They believed that Jian Wushuang was going to pose serious problems for the future of the Jin Kingdom and thus were determined to kill him here. After all, they probably would not get such a good chance to do so in the future.

Jian Wushuang could not help but scoff at the three ferocious and determined kings while shaking his head.

“I decided to face off against you guys just because I wanted to try out my new powers during a real battle. But now, I wanted to leave. None of you are able to make me stay,” said Jian Wushuang, his Blaze Quicksand beginning to form a violent storm again.

“Swoosh—” The storm spread far and wide.

In just a split second, the Blaze Quicksand covered a radius of hundreds of thousands of kilometers.

“Quicksand Realm!” shouted Jian Wushuang.

“Buzz—” The invisible powers of the Realm took effect.

Jian Wushuang had used Blaze Quicksand for protection during the previous fights but never summoned a real Quicksand Realm.

Now, when this Realm took effect, the three kings suddenly felt that some form of pressure was applied to them. They felt as if they had been dragged into mud or bound by shackles. They were unable to move as fast as before or give full play to their powers.

Suddenly, they saw Jian Wushuang turn himself into a flowing light and flee away.

“Let’s go! Let’s chase after him!” Golden Rock King roared, but no matter how hard he tried, he still fell further and further behind Jian Wushuang.

“D*mn it. My speed is suppressed by this Realm. I can’t move any faster,” Tianhuan King cursed in a deep voice.

“So is mine, but I can still manage to catch up with him,” said Tianying King.

Suppressed by Quicksand Realm, both Tianhuan King and Golden Rock King were left far behind by Jian Wushuang. Only Tianying King could keep up with the young man, as speed was always his forte.

However, Tianying King could never stop Jian Wushuang on his own. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What can we do? What can we do now?” Tianhuan King grumbled.

“There’s nothing that we can do. Jian Wushuang’s powers are way beyond our imagination. The three of us can never kill him. Now we can only leave him to that person,” said Golden Rock King.

“That person?” Tianhuan King and Tianying king were somewhat stunned.

These three kings were not the only ones sent out by the Jin Kingdom to kill Jian Wushuang. There was another one deployed on this mission.

That person was a secret weapon of the Jin Kingdom. They had planned to keep the existence of this person confidential unless it was absolutely necessary. However, they had no other choice now.

“I’ve sent a message to that person. As for whether he’ll come to help us, it depends on himself,” said Golden Rock King.

In the center of the sandstorm, Jian Wushuang was rapidly rushing forward. Seeing the three kings behind himself, he could not help but scoffing at them.

“How are you? Jian Wushuang.” Sunrise Sword Emperor sent him a message.

At this moment, three of the five Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace had gathered together in a hall of the palace. The other two, who were currently on the battlefield, also transmitted their spectral images to the hall and attended the meeting through their powers of consciousness.

All of them were nervous upon hearing that Jian Wushuang was ambushed by three kings of the Jin Kingdom.

Beyond their expectations, Jian Wushuang replied, “Hello, Palace Masters. I’ve just engaged the three kings in battle. They’ve used every trick they know but still failed to kill me. They’re still chasing after me right now, but I can shake them off with my Blaze Quicksand Gourd.”
