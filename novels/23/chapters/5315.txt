Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The people present paid little attention.

The defeat of these thirteen was also within expectations; it would be strange if anyone had won!

The disciples of Shangqing Palace were not so easily defeated.

In the ceremonial sword-fighting event after each tide-watching, only one or two could successfully seize the sword. In the case of the generation of Nie Yuan, the Taia Sword had achieved an unbeaten record in seven consecutive tide-watching ceremonies.

Eventually, it attracted the superlative disciples from the ancient land of

Central Province, engaging in a breathtaking battle with Nie Yuan. In the end, it resulted in a draw.

Out of respect for the opponents prestigious identity, the golden sword was handed over to him.

Jian Wushuang had already stood up, positioned at the railing, scanning the disciples on the arena who wielded the Taia Sword.

Although there was a significant gap in origin source compared to him, Jian Wushuang had never encountered many ancient sword techniques. It was an opportunity to observe and learn.

The intricacies were subtle, but unfortunately, the practitioners! origin source was too weak to fully unleash the techniques.

Jian Wushuangs eyes glowed with enthusiasm, thinking to himself, Indeed, they are disciples of ancient sects!

The Taia Sword was truly a rare and supreme sword technique. It was highly suitable for Dao Lords to cultivate. With the origin source of these individuals, achieving Dao Lord status would be extremely challenging in the outside world. Still, by practicing the Taia Sword, they could become formidable. The Sword Dao reaches perfection, merging into the unity of the primordial yuan.

Each sword embodies incredibly potent sword intent, far surpassing any sword intent he has ever encountered.

This is the essence of a practitioner of the sword pathperson and sword, heart and sword, form transcending even the sword itself.

Unfortunately, there are some flaws in the origin source.

Although the Qishen Temples origin source is formidable, even surpassing that of the original universe, it is ultimately too complex.

Not suitable for the sword path.DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

If it were the Myriad Daos, it would be highly sought after in the Four Great Secret Realms.

Regrettably, he has yet to come across relevant records.

The first round, Taia Sword emerges victorious! declared Elder Jiu Jian loudly.

All 13 challengers were injured; either they conceded voluntarily or were knocked off the stage. Upon returning to their positions, the Shangqing Palace would provide godstones to help them recover.

This policy actually encouraged more people to take on the challenge.

Of course, ordinary Dao Lords wouldnt embarrass themselves by stepping onto the stage!

Soon, after more than a dozen rounds of challenges, formidable contenders began to appear.

Tianmo Sect, Zhu Bachi, challenges the Thirteenth Sword!

The newcomers voice resounded like a bell, his physique bulky, with a face full of rough musclesa member of the demonic sect.

Niany trembled at the mention of the Tianmo Sect.

It was a super sect rivaling the Shangqing Palace, ranked among the top three demonic sects in the Northern Region.

Zhu Bachi was a powerful disciple of the contemporary Tianmo Sect, destined to become a demonic giant in the future. Judging by his physique, ordinary people wouldnt easily discern his cultivation in the Sword Dao.

Boom!

Advancing from the second row, Zhu Bachi!s massive figure, with a perfected physical body and a divine form exceeding 8,000 times, approached. Only the Sword Daos origin source seemed slightly weaker.

Jian Wushuangs gaze deepened. This person indeed had the qualifications to challenge the Thirteenth Taia Sword, and he was challenging the weakest among them.

This surprised him; even he couldnt see through it thoroughly. Except for the leader, the auras of the other twelve swords were identical. It was challenging for individuals of the same level to discern each others origin source. Not everyone possessed thought power as formidable as his.

His gaze shifted towards a young man with white hair, similar to himself. It became clear to him.

The tier 5 demonic path Emperor had communicated with Zhu Bachi through telepathy, informing him about the weakest challenger.

After several rounds of challenges, the Thirteen Tai p a Swords had inadvertently revealed some of their strengths.

The discerning eyes of an Emperor could easily distinguish the strong from the weak, even in a lake filled with Sword Intent and origin sources. The Emperors mastery over spatial origin sources allowed him to unravel the intricate Sword Intents and see their essence.

Zhu Bachis appearance prompted many to step forward. After all, it was a peak-level battle between equals.

In this round, besides the formidable Demon cultivator, there was also a Grand Yan Immortal who rivaled an Emperor. However, not many paid attention to the latters background.

Apart from these two, the rest were all half-step Emperors.

Qiuhuang Citys interest in these battles was minimal. Qiuhuang casually chatted with the Shangqing Palaces Master about matters concerning the Elder Palace, then closed his eyes to rest, projecting an air of detachment.

However, in secret, he continued to telepathically communicate with Jian Wushuang.

Kid, you can endure this? Thats the Sword Dao origin source of the Shangqing Patriarch. Arent you afraid someone else might snatch it before

Jian Wushuang didnt turn around, still fixated on the Thirteen Taia Swords. Silently, he transmitted his thoughts, Lets wait a bit longer. The Sword Dao origin source is unique; obtaining even a strand is sufficient. No need to attract unnecessary attention.

He wasnt sure, but among these 13 strands of golden Sword Qi, there seemed to be a different origin source of sword Dao.

Tsk tsk, if I tell you that these 13 strands of Sword Dao origin source are different, would you be ready to bow out right now?

Different? Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow.

Sword Dao was supposed to be singular, the purest form of the martial path focused on killing and combat. How could it be different?

Indeed, its different. Shangqing Ancestor followed the Dao of the Myriad Swords, similar to the Myriad Dao schools, not inferior to the Ultimate Dao!

Myriad Swords!

Jian Wushuang was somewhat astonished.

Could Sword Dao be cultivated in such diverse ways?

How do you know? Jian Wushuang transmitted his curious tone.

The old man with goat horns snorted and continued, Do you think the Elder Palace is just idling around? Even if theyre unfamiliar with these ancient sects, would they still be unfamiliar with these powerful tier 6 Emperors?

Ordinary tier 6 was one thing, but the current head of the Shangqing Palace was quite mediocre in strength. When he was a tier 5 Emperor, he only mastered the tail end of the Nine Swords.

It was only after breaking through to the tier 6 that he ascended to the position of the palace head. He was not even considered during the initial planning, and no one expected him to sneakily reach the tier 6. Even the Shangqing Ancestor was shocked at the time!

Although his combat strength wasnt formidable, he was still a tier 6

Emperor, on par with the peak of the tier 5, the goat-horned old man.bender

For those truly top-notch tier 6 Emperors, the Elder Palace had been studying them since its inception.

After all, whether to recruit or suppress, one must be tactful in ones heart.

The Four Great Secret Realms will eventually be integrated and unified to restore the ancient glory. The current scattered state is worthless; instead, its a burden.

If the White Tiger Temple cant suppress it, the Elder Palace will have to take action.

In the Elder Palace, there are several formidable tier 6 Emperor among them, no weaker than the White Tiger Temple.

Just like Wu Zuo, once a named disciple of the Qishen Temple, the power of his inheritance is probably beyond their imagination. Otherwise, during the initial exploration, they might have died in the Land Realm.

Compared to the Land Realm, the Heavenly Realm is much more stable.

At least those tier 6 Emperors are quite honest; they wont easily provoke the White Tiger Temple.

Kid, you dont have much time left. Take the opportunity to gain some benefits. Maybe when you make a move, the Shangqing Palace, seeing your strength, will give you some treasures!

Jian Wushuang looked surprised and communicated through voice transmission, Is it possible? As a Grand Yan Immortal, I shouldnt be treated like this by the Shangqing Patriarch, right?

Humph, you dont understand. Even if the Shangqing Patriarch doesnt value you, the current Palace Master of Shangqing Palace will give you some benefits to establish a connection with you..
