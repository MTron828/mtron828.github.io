Chapter 446: Wu Ming

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

With the appearance of the marquis’ cave mansion, the Inner Area had attracted everyone’s attention.

“Even though I’ve been in the Inner Area for a long time now, I have only seen two experts. It seems almost all the Stage Three experts have gone to the mansion.”

Setting out from the campsite, Jian Wushuang traveled at a fast speed towards the Inner Area. It wouldn’t take him long to get to the marquis’ cave mansion. Right at this moment...

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang paused, looking towards a figure, that was walking, a short distance away from him.

It was a dark-skinned bald man with a Giant Axe on his back. Not perceiving his token, Jian Wushuang knew that he was an expert from the opposite camp.

Jian Wushuang was heading to the marquis’ cave mansion, so it was better to ignore normal experts of the opposite camp. However, this man wasn’t just any normal expert.

“It’s him.”

Seeing his face, Jian Wushuang immediately thought of a name.

“What are the chances I would meet him here?” Jian Wushuang grinned, then he moved.

In the grass, the bald man, Wu Ming, was walking forward slowly with a cold and indifferent look on his face.

“Three days, I haven’t seen an expert from the opposite camp for three days. Apparently, they have all gone to the marquis’ cave mansion.” Wu Ming’s eyes were cold, “Humph, idiots!”

“Opportunities are always accompanied by danger. More than ten experts at the Peak of Stage Three have died since it was found, and so have several lords!”

“If you’re not as strong as experts like Bone King and Heaven Stone Castle Lord, you will die even you are only exploring the outer layer. And those opportunities are worthless to you if you die.”

Wu Ming knew his strength well enough.

He gave up after learning that it was a marquis’ cave mansion. He knew it was nothing more than seeking death for him. Many experts had died in the cave mansion in just the last few days.

“It’s better for me to stay in the Inner Area. Here, no one can kill me unless he’s an expert at the Heaven-defying Level.” Wu Ming was busy thinking when a sudden wind-breaking sound reverberated from nearby.

Wu Ming raised his head and saw a Flowing Light rushing towards him. The light left a residual shadow in the air as it moved toward him in the blink of an eye.

“Wu Ming!”

While standing above an empty space in front of Wu Ming, Jian Wushuang shouted to him.

“You’re... ” After gazing at him and seeing his face, Wu Ming only thought of one name.

A terrible name for him.

“Swordsman?” Wu Ming was astonished, but he quickly calmed down and greeted him humbly, “Nice to see you, Master Swordsman. What can I do for you?”

Wu Ming knew that with no lords present, Jian Wushuang was invincible in the entire Flaming Battlefield.

If he behaved himself, such an expert would not attack him just for the battle achievements.

Jian Wushuang watched his every tiny expression and smiled slightly, “Wu Ming, I heard that you have a ring which can display something similar to a Realm Technique.”

Wu Ming’s heart tightened.

He instantly remembered that Jian Wushuang also had a powerful Realm Technique.

“Is he after my ring?” Wu Ming’s heart fell as he looked at the scarlet ring on his finger.

He had found it in a cave mansion by chance, and it had saved his life several times now.

It was quite important to him, it was even the most important treasure he had.

“So it’s the scarlet ring.” Jian Wushuang looked at the scarlet ring on Wu Ming’s finger.

He had kept it in mind ever since he heard about it from Xue Yang. He had not been striving for it, but he had unexpectedly met Wu Ming here. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Since he came across it, Jian Wushuang surely would not leave without it.

“I’m curious, which one is more powerful, yours or mine?” Jian Wushuang asked and smiled.

Hearing this, Wu Ming’s eyes narrowed, then... Whoosh!

Without any hesitation, Wu Ming turned and tried to flee.

“Run! Run!”

Wu Ming dared not fight with Jian Wushuang and he was also unwilling to give him the scarlet ring, so his only remaining option was to flee.

Seeing that, Jian Wushuang smiled. Then a vast Blood River flowed out, completely covering Wu Ming and the space around him.

A powerful force tried to put pressure on Wu Ming.

Wu Ming had a sullen look on his face. Upon perceiving the Blood River that was rushing towards him, he gritted his teeth. Then, an intangible bloody flame arose and a Blood Fire Domain swept out.

Jian Wushuang’s Blood River tried to break the Blood Fire Domain, but it was only able to compress it into a small area.

“Road to the Underworld can only contain it?” Even though Jian Wushuang was surprised, he just smiled slightly and muttered, “Interesting.”

Then a stream of soaring Sword Essence appeared, along with a vast Sword Realm. They turned into intangible waves and began to flow forward.

Sword Realm, Hundredfold Realm!

Before getting into Bei Mo Marquis’ cave mansion, Jian Wushuang had only mastered the first level of the Multifold Realm, Tenfold Realm.

However, he could now display the Hundredfold Realm.

Road to the Underworld and the Hundredfold Realm were being displayed simultaneously, immediately causing the Blood Fire Domain surrounding Wu Ming to break down.

“What?” Wu Ming’s face turned pale.

He was confident in his scarlet ring. Even though he had heard that Jian Wushuang had a good Realm Technique, he didn’t think that it was stronger than his scarlet ring.

But it turned out... his scarlet ring was much weaker than Jian Wushuang’s Realm Technique.

Too much weaker.
