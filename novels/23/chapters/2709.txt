Chapter 2710: Invitation to Join the Alliance

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Is he finally dead?”

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief when he saw Fo Yi breathed his last. A smile finally appeared on his face.

Fo Yi was a genuine Grand Ultimate God expert and was extremely powerful among Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

Jian Wushuang felt rather excited that he managed to kill and behead such a powerful Grand Ultimate God and concluded the battle at the same time.

He was able to kill Fo Yi by relying on various powerful secret techniques.

As an example, the ‘A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique’ was not as effective when being used on a Grand Ultimate God because Jian Wushuang executed it while at the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm, but it could still create great opportunities for him to launch an attack.

The double domain-type method—Star Armor Domain and Prison of Punishment were indeed extremely tyrannical. The only part he lacked was his understanding of the Sword Principle which allowed him to perform the perfected Profound Achievement Sword World.

If Jian Wushuang had a higher understanding of the Sword Principle, he would be able to perform the 100,000 miles Perfect Sword World. The Perfect Sword World could easily crush Fo Yi’s Principle World and deprived him of his capabilities to resist Jian Wushuang’s attack which would amount to triple domain oppression.

Fo Yi might not be able to display any of his strength had there been triple domain oppression.

“My understanding of laws and principles is still too weak compared to a genuine Grand Ultimate God,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Many experts at the voids nearby were watching the battle and became completely stunned regardless of whether those were from the Sword Alliance or the Star Fort.

Their eyes were glued on the cold corpse.

“Fort Master. Is the Fort Master dead?”

“Did Su Han really kill the Fort Master?”

“This...”

The Star Fort experts were shocked and horrified.

After Jian Wushuang took away all the treasures in Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring, he set his gaze on the Star Fort experts as a cold smirk appeared on the corners of his mouth.

Rumbling...

The perfectly integrated huge Golden Prison and Star Armor Domain instantly enshrouded the Start Fort experts.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang commanded as his figure skimmed forward.

Many Sword Alliance experts who were at the side were the fastest to react, especially the Divine Sword Army. The almost a hundred Heaven Ultimate Gods from the Divine Sword Army attacked the Star Fort experts under Long Shan’s guidance after seeing Jian Wushuang taking action.

“Kill, kill!”

“Haha, kill them all.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Monstrous cries to kill resounded.

The Star Fort experts panicked and were horrified.

“Escape, escape!”

“Run!”

“Fort Master is dead. We’ll be dead if we don’t make a run for it.”

The high-level Star Fort experts had come for the battle with a large number of them at the scene. They were initially able to fight against the Divine Sword Army with their larger numbers, but they were stunned by Jian Wushuang’s terrifying strength after seeing Jian Wushuang kill Fo Yi on the spot and had lost their fighting spirit.

The experts were frantically escaping and so were their Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods—who were the fastest to escape.

“Escape, escape!”

Gu Mo’s eyes turned red as he fled, overwhelmed by a wave of feelings. “Su Han killed Fo Wu a little more than a year ago, and he killed the Fort Master who had just improved tremendously in strength today. His progress is way too fast and scary. I need to quickly run away...”

The terrified Gu Mo had forgotten about his hatred for Jian Wushuang.

He had forgotten how Elder Brother Shi Mo had died in Jian Wushuang’s hands. He no longer wanted to avenge his brother, but only to escape from Dragon City—the further the better.

However, a phantom-like figure appeared in front of him just when he took his first few steps.

It was Jian Wushuang.

“You...” Gu Mo stared wide-eyed at Jian Wushuang.

“Hehe, Palace Master Gu Mo. You should stay here.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and swung his Blood Mountain Sword across.

The horrified Gu Mo tried to resist the sword attack.

However, the result was Jian Wushuang instantly defeated Gu Mo’s divine weapon before cutting off his divine body.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and glanced around at the various battles occurring around him.

“Those who surrender can live but kill those who resist or try to escape with no mercy!”

Jian Wushuang’s magnificent voice reverberated across the void.

Those Star Fort experts who were fleeing stopped in their tracks and surrendered after hearing Jian Wushuang’s voice.

Nearly 80 percent of the experts agreed to surrender. Only more than 20 percent of the recalcitrant experts who were Fo Yi’s loyal followers were subdued and killed by the Divine Sword Army.

It did not take long for Dragon City to calm down again.

Dong Xue had already begun to integrate the Star Fort experts into the Sword Alliance with the next action was to collect the cities and territories under the Star Fort’s control.

The Star Fort Master had been beheaded and many high-level officials were either also beheaded or surrendered to the Sword Alliance. The territories controlled by the Star Fort would naturally fall under the Sword Alliance.

After the things were settled, Jian Wushuang approached Strange Old Snake.

“Alliance Master Su Han, congratulations on your great advancement.” Strange Old Snake congratulated Jian Wushuang.

Earlier, Strange Old Snake thought Jian Wushuang was arrogant when he refused to join hands with him and went solo ahead to a fierce battle against Fo Yi.

Surprisingly, Jian Wushuang managed to behead Fo Yi.

Strange Old Snake was extremely shocked and knew Jian Wushuang was much stronger than him since Jian Wushuang managed to kill Fo Yi whose strength had surpassed himself. Therefore, he was no longer as cold as before when faced with Jian Wushuang again and behaved rather humbly on the contrary.

“All thanks to you, Strange Old Snake,” said Jian Wushuang.

“You’re too humble as I didn’t do much.” Strange Old Snake was embarrassed.

He knew he did not help much. All he had done was just blocking Fo Yi for a short moment in the beginning, but he failed miserably at even doing that.

In the end, Jian Wushuang called the shots himself.

“Anyway, I’m thankful you tried your best to stop Fo Yi for a while.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Now that I’ve killed Fo Yi while many of the Star Fort experts are willing to surrender to Sword Alliance, Sword Alliance can take over the Star Fort’s territories and swallow it completely.

“Star Fort is originally a top second-rated force who aren’t too far from first-rated forces. The overall strength of the Sword Alliance is now estimated to be comparable to some ordinary first-rated forces after Star Fort has completely integrated into the Sword Alliance. The only area we’re lacking is probably experts above the Grand Ultimate God realm.

“Therefore, I’d like to invite you to join Sword Alliance. I wonder if you’re willing to accept my invitation?”
