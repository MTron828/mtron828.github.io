“Those who were not qualified can only look on in despair?”

Upon hearing this, numerous Sword Principle experts suddenly had an odd look on their faces.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang was mocking Su Ming. After all, Su Ming had possessed the Heart-killing Sword for thousands of years, but he had not been able to bind it.

“How bold!” Su Ming said, as a silver of coldness flashed through his beautiful face.

He stared at Jian Wushuang. “It’s been a long time since someone dared talk to me like this. Since you’ve said so much, you won’t be able to leave here.”

“Even if I had not said those words, you would not let me go, right?” Jian Wushuang wore a cold smile. “Su Ming, you don’t have to pretend to be noble. If you want the Heart-killing Sword, make your move.”

“Since you are courting death, I will make your dream come true,” Su Ming said. Then a sword appeared in his hands.

It was a dreamlike sword, with an almost transparent body. Su Ming held the sword while radiating an overwhelming Sword Essence.

Jian Wushuang looked grim.

Sword Demon Su Ming was different from Marquis Nanyu and Marquis Zizhong. Though he was at the Eight-cloud Realm, he had reached the Dao.

The Dao was the supreme level, superior to the Origin.

If an expert reached the Dao, his strength would experience a dramatic change.

“Boy, are you ready to die?” Su Ming stared at Jian Wushuang as if he was looking at a dead person.

“Come on.” Jian Wushuang gripped the Heart-killing Sword tightly while the 180 foot Golden Sword Soul Phantom emanated a mighty aura.

Su Ming sneered, then he casually swung his dreamlike longsword.

It seemed like a casual and slow movement.

However, the moment he attacked, a colorful, dreamlike sword light appeared in the sky.

The streak of sword light was charming.

Jian Wushuang was shocked. In that instant, he saw a different scene.

“Shuang’er, Shuang’er, help, help!”

Jian Wushuang heard a terrified voice and looked over. He saw his father who had been indifferent earlier, fleeing in panic while being chased by a grinning Marquis Xuefeng who was brandishing his saber.

“Dad!” Jian Wushuang panicked.

“No!” Jian Nantian uttered a forlorn scream.

Jian Wushuang saw his father’s body being split in two by Marquis Xuefeng. He was shocked, but he immediately realized that it was not real.

“Illusion, it’s an illusion!”

“Wake up! Be quick!”?Jian Wushuang snarled in his heart.

He suddenly gritted his teeth and tried his best to disentangle himself from the illusion.

When he regained consciousness, he noticed that the heart-stopping attack was less than one meter away from him. He had no chance of parrying it, so he could only try to dodge.

Su Ming had originally aimed his attack at the young man’s head, but Jian Wushuang moved, so the sword light passed by next to his ear and landed on his right shoulder.

Woosh!

A huge sword wound appeared on his shoulder and blood began flowing out of it. Luckily, Jian Wushuang had a powerful body, otherwise, his right arm would have been chopped off.

While ignoring the sharp pain in his arm, Jian Wushuang quickly retreated.

Su Ming still stood in the air, slowly sheathing his longsword.

“You were able to escape from my Illusory Sword Principle. Very impressive.” Su Ming sneered while looking at the young man.

Jian Wushuang was terrified.

He did not expect Su Ming to possess a swordsmanship which contained a terrifying illusion.

“Illusory Sword Principle?” Jian Wushuang could not help nodding in private.

The Dao was worthy of being the supreme level, superior to the Origin. It was terrifying indeed.

If he had not reacted to the attack in time, his head would have been split in half...

“My Illusory Sword Principle is marvelous. Few marquises could parry it. You should be proud of yourself since you did not die from that attack,” Su Ming said.

Jian Wushuang looked grim and began activating the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill in his mind.

“Soul-Devouring Secret Skill!”

Jian Wushuang had not used Soul-Devouring Secret Skill ever since he arrived at the Divine Land.

It placed a heavy burden on his body. So, unless it was a critical moment, Jian Wushuang was unwilling to use it. He had not experienced a truly desperate fight in the Divine Land yet. But now, he had to rely on it to save himself.

Jian Wushuang instantly radiated a terrifying power which seemed like it could devour everything. He was activating the second volume of the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, the highest level.

Boom... In an instant, the whole area began to shake.

Jian Wushuang’s body seemed to be a black hole that could devour everything as a stream of natural power from everything in the area began rushing into his body at an amazing speed.

The ground below became dry and cracked.

In the blink of an eye, the land within a radius of dozens of meters had become lifeless.

The spectators were panic-stricken.

“What a frightening skill!”

“What, what happened?”

“He is actually devouring natural power?”

The spectators exclaimed in amazement.

“Hum, just a small trick.” Su Ming sneered.

Eventually, Jian Wushuang stopped devouring the energy, but his aura had already improved to a new level.

Of course, it also placed a heavy burden on him.

Jian Wushuang pointed towards the space ahead of him with his blood-red eyes.

“Asura Secret Skill, Bridge of Helplessness!”

Buzz... A terrifying power erupted and a huge blood bridge appeared above the Blood River, slowly stretching toward the end of the river. Jian Wushuang, who was covered by a scarlet armor, stepped onto the bridge.

Jian Wushuang’s aura soared once again.

He glanced at Su Ming. Then, in the next moment, he moved.
