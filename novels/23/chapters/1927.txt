1928 Emperor Bai“s Condition

“Emperor Bai, go ahead,” Jian Wushuang was excited.

The seventh step of inverse cultivation skill was the crucial factor of him becoming the strongest person in Eternal Chaotic World.

Without the skill, no matter how great his skills and trump cards were, he wouldn’t be able to compare with a true Great Emperor after all.

However, with the skill, he can then try to breakthrough and become an Almighty. By then, he could easily reach Great Emperor level. He might even stand a chance to compare favorably with Emperor Bai.

Hence, regardless of the price he had to pay in order to get the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, he’d do it.

Jian Wushuang had already made up his mind. As long as the conditions that Emperor Bai suggested didn’t go against his principles, he would figure out a way to get it done no matter how difficult it was.

“The first condition is that I have to receive the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace,” Emperor Bai said directly.

“The Secret Skill of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang stunned, “Emperor Bai is also interested in the Secret Skill of Star Palace?”

“The secret skill is extremely unique. It is also extremely helpful to Great Emperor. Previously, I couldn’t use it. But now, it’s different,” Emperor Bai said, but he didn’t explain much.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and asked, “Mister Emperor Bai, I’d like to clarify if the Secret Skill of Star Palace is for you alone to cultivate or Emperor Bai intends to spread the secret skill widely, for the experts from Sanctuary Alliance to cultivate it?”

“Lineage of Star obtained the Secret Skill of Star Palace relying on your own opportunity. Hence, it belongs to Lineage of Star alone. I wouldn’t make Lineage of Star to announce the secret skill to the world. I only wanted to cultivate it myself,” Emperor Bai answered.

“Then, there’s no problem,” Jian Wushuang agreed straightaway.

The Secret Skill of Star Palace was the biggest advantage and trump card that the experts and disciples from Lineage of Star had.

If it wasn’t necessary, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t wish to spread the secret skill wide to the point that everyone knew it. Then, Lineage of Star would lose their advantage.

However, if it was only Emperor Bai alone, there was no difference.

Just like guest elders in Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang promised to let them cultivate the Secret Skill of Star Palace as well.

“After this war, the three alliances are defeated. Almighties Alliance is even long gone. Lineage of Star could consider yourself a great victory. If I am not mistaken, you would be dealing with the other two alliances later on, right?” Emperor Bai asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “No matter if it was Star Extermination Alliance or Supreme Ten Alliance, they came at Lineage of Star with a goal to root us out, especially Star Extermination Alliance. Back on Star Land, they advanced and consolidated at every step to destroy Lineage of Star’s foundation. They didn’t want to leave Lineage of Star any chance. Now that Lineage of Star has passed through the calamity. I, of course, have to wait until I settle everything before I deal with them!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I believe anyone would do the same as I do.”

“You’re right. The two alliances took the initiative to attack Lineage of Star and it is only right and proper that you take revenge on them. However, my second condition is for Lineage of Star to not attack the two alliances for now,” Emperor Bai said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Because the current situation is unusual,” Emperor Bai looked, “You know clearly that the existence of Sanctuary Alliance is to match against Star Demons in the Eight Lairs, hidden forces, Holocaust Sect and also Acheron Palace!”

“The two major dark forces were originally forced to hide in the dark by Sanctuary Alliance. They were like rats on the streets and they didn’t date to reveal themselves. Over the years, the two hidden forces started preparing for an attack. Not too long ago, Sanctuary Alliance received news that Holocaust Sect went through a drastic change?and they were united by someone else ruling with an iron fist!”

“On top of that, the actions of Acheron Palace for the past years… I’m afraid, in no time, Eternal Chaotic World will be in chaos again. Sanctuary Alliance might come across a tragic war.”

“At such a crucial moment, Sanctuary Alliance naturally has to figure out a way to maintain our power!”

Emperor Bai paused and continued, “This time, the war between the three alliances and Lineage of Star, no one expected Lineage of Star to win a great victory. You even broke Star Extermination Alliance apart and made Almighties Alliance vanish into thin air. After this war, Almighties who passed away were more than a hundred and fifty of them. To Sanctuary Alliance, it is a great loss. If both parties were to continue, it would only expend more of Sanctuary Alliance’s fighting power. While an oyster and a kingfisher were engaged in a bitter tussle, a fisherman came along and carried them both off. In other words, the two dark forces benefit from it.”

“Emperor Bai, I understand what you mean,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was deep, “But the war isn’t instigated by Lineage of Star. We are being taunted and bullied. Now that we finally passed the calamity and stand a chance to counter-attack, you want Lineage of Star to hold back?”

Jian Wushuang was unwilling.

Not just him, but all experts in Lineage of Star were also aggrieved. They were only waiting for Jian Wushuang’s command until they counter-attacked the two alliances.

If Jian Wushuang were to tell them to stop the war then, there might be a lot of people who were unhappy.

“I know that Lineage of Star is upset. But the current situation didn’t allow you to continue the war. On top of that, although both alliances lost many experts in the war, their foundation is still solid. If they continued to work together, their fighting power would still be magnificent. If Lineage of Star were to leave the galaxy formation and enter their lairs to fight, the match would be hard to call. In the end, both parties might be in a stalemate situation. Sanctuary Alliance wouldn’t allow that.”

“I brought up the condition in order to provide Lineage of Star an opportunity to step out from a difficult position. You can announce to the outside world that you and I reached a mutual agreement that you have to stop for now. If Sanctuary Alliance were to get involved, it wouldn’t be taken care of so easily,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew in distress.

He also knew Sanctuary Alliance’s concern.

If it was an ordinary period, it wouldn’t matter if Lineage of Star were to continue to fight against the two alliances. Sanctuary Alliance wouldn’t be bothered.

But it was different then.

“Jian Wushuang, you actually really didn’t have to continue the war. Even if you were to continue to fight, there wouldn’t be any other result. You should know that there are some forces among the two alliances that have deep-rooted foundations. Some are even associated with the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. For instance, Abysmal Palace has Abysmal Saint Master as their backer!”

“Soaring Heaven King Palace also has Colored Glaze Emperor to lead for them. With Great Emperors involve, Lineage of Star can’t destroy them.”

“You might as well take the time to increase your power. After some time, when Eternal Chaotic World finally settles down, I reckon you should be an Almighty by then and your power should be able to compare favorably with a Great Emperor’s, or even with mine. By then, it’d be much easier if you wanted to destroy the two alliances and Sanctuary Alliance definitely wouldn’t say much,” Emperor Bai said.
