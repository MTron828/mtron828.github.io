Chapter 2844: Opening of the Holy Heavenly Furnace

——

Boom! Boom!

As the Holy Heavenly Furnace was opened, this enormous volcano began to shake violently.

One had to know that this volcano was the largest and the most core of this group of volcanoes. As it shook, immediately... the entire group of volcanoes began to shake violently. Endless flames erupted from the mouths of the volcanoes, the entire sky was dyed red.

The noise was no less than that of countless volcanoes erupting at the same time.

In an instant, the entire Fire Cloud Castle was shaken.

In the main hall in the depths of Fire Cloud Castle.

The purple-robed middle-aged man, Bi Yan, brought Jian Wushuang to meet master mo and then returned here. He was still talking with Master Qu.

“Master Qu, the master is meeting a distinguished guest. I’m afraid it will take some time for him to give an answer. So I have to trouble you to wait here for a while,” Bi Yan said to Master Qu.

“Since Master Mo is busy with something, as a junior, it’s only right for me to wait here.”

Young Master Qu did not have any temper.

What a joke. Even if his father came to pay a visit personally, when Master Mo had something important to do, he could only wait obediently. How could he dare to have the slightest bit of dissatisfaction?

It had already been three days since they had waited like this. Young Master Qu was not in a hurry. He seemed to be very patient.

But at this moment...

Boom Boom!

The entire Fire Cloud Castle, along with the huge group of volcanoes, began to shake violently.

Endless flames filled the entire world.

This huge commotion was noticed by Bi Yan and Young Master Qu in the main hall.

“What’s wrong? What’s going on?” Young Master Qu was puzzled.

But Bi Yan suddenly stood up, his eyes filled with shock.

“This, this is... the Holy Heavenly Furnace?”

“The Holy Heavenly Furnace has opened?”

Bi Yan’s voice was filled with shock.

“Holy Heavenly Furnace?” Young Master Qu was also shocked when he heard these three words.

The number one master craftsman in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, Lord Mo, was too famous in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms.

Many experts knew of Lord Mo’s craftsmanship. At the same time, they had also heard of the Holy Heavenly Furnace. Young Master Qu naturally knew of it.

As for the Holy Heavenly Furnace, it was a sacred treasure that was used to refine weapons or elixirs. This treasure was especially important to Lord Mo. Moreover, it was not easy to activate this treasure. Not only did it require flames... but it also consumed a huge amount of Lord Mo’s divine power and mental energy.

Because of this, Lord Mo rarely used the sacred heavenly furnace when refining weapons.

For example, the last time Lord Mo used the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine weapons was a long time ago. The most powerful expert of the Golden Crow Nine Realms, the bone emperor, personally came to ask Lord Mo to refine a special treasure. At that time, Lord Mo had just used the Holy Heavenly Furnace, it had been hundreds of thousands of years.

And now... Lord Mo had actually used the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine weapons again?

“Master has been staying with that Sword One for the past three days, and now he’s using the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine weapons. It seems like he’s refining a divine weapon for that sword one, but no matter what, that sword one is only an Advanced Great Divine Master. What kind of divine weapon does he want master to refine for him? It’s actually worth master using the Holy Heavenly Furnace?” Bi Yan growled in his heart.

“Who, who invited Lord Mo to personally refine a divine weapon, and even let Lord Mo use the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine it?” Young Master Qu’s heart was shaken, and his heart was filled with doubts.

He tried to ask Bi Yan, but Bi Yan only gave him a few prevarications and did not tell him who invited Lord Mo...

Young Master Qu could only investigate on his own.

It was not just Bi Yan and Young Master Qu. Many experts and blacksmiths in the Fire Cloud Castle were also shocked.

But other than surprise, there was more ecstasy and excitement.

Especially those blacksmiths. The reason why they came to the Fire Cloud Castle was to observe the bloodbath blacksmithing technique. And now, although they could not see the scene of Lord Mo controlling the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine elixirs, they could only feel the Holy Heavenly Furnace being activated, feeling the great power of the blacksmithing was of great use to them.

...

In the vast open space under the largest volcano in the center, the Holy Heavenly Furnace was surrounded by a purple-black sea of fire. The aura of the holy treasure level had completely erupted.

“The Holy Heavenly Furnace has been opened. Little friend Sword One, send your magic weapon over,” Lord Mo shouted in a low voice.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He waved his hand and threw the blood mountain sword into the Holy Heavenly Furnace.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As soon as it entered the Holy Heavenly Furnace, the purplish-black flames around him suddenly soared.

Lord Mo stared at the divine power defense shield and directly rushed into the sea of flames and came to the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

Then he began to slap all kinds of handprints on the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

These handprints were very unique, and they were a special tool-refining method.

Jian Wushuang could not understand this tool-refining method, but he could feel that as the handprints were made, the temperature of the flames in the Holy Heavenly Furnace became higher and higher.

While using the tool-refining method, Lord Mo kept throwing some auxiliary materials into the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

Time passed slowly.

Lord Mo was using the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine the blood mountain sword with all his strength, while Jian Wushuang was watching quietly.

Although he did not know how to refine weapons, the skills of a superior seventh-grade weapon refiner were worth watching.

In a flash, nine days passed.

During these nine days, Lord Mo had been using the Holy Heavenly Furnace with all his strength and did not stop for a moment.

After nine days, Jian Wushuang could clearly sense that lord mo had used up a lot of divine power and mind power, and he looked a little tired.

Because the Holy Heavenly Furnace had been activated, the giant volcano had been shaking violently. The entire Fire Cloud Castle had been shaking for nine days without any weakening.

After nine days and nine nights of continuous refining, Lord Mo finally completed the refining step.

“Little friend Sword One, get ready. We are going to use the essence blood soon,” Lord Mo said solemnly.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and his face became extremely solemn.

In the blink of an eye, another hour passed.

Buzz!

A faint sword hum suddenly sounded from the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

The sound was not loud and did not stand out in the sea of fire. However, both Lord Mo and Jian Wushuang heard it clearly.

Especially Jian Wushuang, who was connected to the blood mountain sword heart blood. He could clearly feel the throbbing of the blood mountain sword at this moment.

“Young friend, quickly send the essence blood into the Holy Heavenly Furnace,” Lord Mo shouted.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He turned his palm and a drop of scarlet essence blood appeared in his palm.
