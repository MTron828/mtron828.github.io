Chapter 2315 Lin Mansion

When the grey-robed man left with Zhuge Hong, everyone in the Lin Mansion crowded over.“Brother Wushuang, that’s amazing!” Lin Yan was overjoyed.

“Brother Wushuang, I’m impressed! Really impressed!”

“You really live up to your name. Today’s a good eye-opener for all of us.”

“Zhuge Hong could be considered an elite class talent in the entire Anjiu Prefecture or even the Wusha Barren Region. Yet, the difference between him and you is larger than one would expect.”

Many experts from Lin Mansion joined in praising, expressing gratitude or even paying respect to Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang was just sixteen years old, the strength he displayed in the battle against Zhuge Hong was something that no one in the field would overlook. Moreover, his potential was even greater.

“Everyone, you guys are too courteous,” Jian Wushuang also responded with a smile.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several figures landing on the drill ground. They were none other than Lin Tiefeng and the four Half Step Divine Demons who had remained hidden and watched over the entire series of events.

When they saw Lin Tiefeng, the experts and disciples of Lin Mansion shut their mouths instantly.

“Nephew Wushuang.” Lin Tiefeng walked to Jian Wushuang and said, “We have troubled you this time. If it wasn’t for you, the Lin Mansion would be utterly embarrassed.”

“It was just a simple act,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“Haha! Your simple act did help my Lin Mansion greatly. If I’m not wrong, the Zhuge Family was probably trying to sound out the strength of our Lin Mansion today. Or rather, they are trying to find out the extent of my recovery. If you did not defeat Zhuge Hong and let him press the issue, I would most likely be forced to step in.”

Jian Wushuang kept his smile.

He knew Lin Tiefeng would be able to see the true intentions of Zhuge Family since he could be the family head.

“Oh right! Wushuang, I saw you broke Zhuge Hong’s weapon with just your finger... Zhuge Hong’s weapon was most likely a terrestrial treasure. Yet, you are able to break it. Considering that both of you are at similar cultivation bases, I guess your understanding of Sword Principle has probably reached the level of Great Achievement?” Lin Tiefeng turned to Jian Wushuang abruptly and asked.

“Great Achievement in Sword Principle?” Several Lin Mansion experts who specialized in Sword Principle had now turned to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang only responded with a casual smile and didn’t answer directly.

However, his smile could be seen as a wordless sign of consent.

“Just as I expected!”

Seeing Jian Wushuang did not mention otherwise, and Lin Tiefeng was astounded.

He was able to tell from the battle previously.

In the Absolute Beginning Divine World, the classifications of one’s cultivation base, weapons, elixirs and various aspects were different from those in the Eternal Chaotic World.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, the most powerful weapon was just Chaos Divine Treasure.

However, Chaos Divine Treasure was just a blurry concept. Many experts that stood at the top of the Eternal Chaotic World owned Chaos Divine Treasures. Yet, their might differed greatly. Together with the immense Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, even those Great Emperors that stood at the pinnacle would find it hard to maximize the real strength of some Chaos Divine Treasures.

It was also because of that that the classification of Chaos Divine Treasures was blurry.

However, the classification of weapons in Absolute Beginning Divine World was much clearer and defined.

There were ordinary weapons, terrestrial treasures, heavenly treasures, divine treasures, and others.

Terrestrial treasures were already hard to come by. Even Chaotic Divine Demons would be extremely interested in them.

However, Jian Wushuang was able to forcefully destroy a terrestrial treasure class sabre with just the strength of his finger. This would only be possible if he possessed an extremely frightening sword essence.

That sword essence was something that couldn’t be found in those with only Initial Success in Sword Principle.

It was because of that that Lin Tiefeng believed Jian Wushuang had likely achieved Great Achievement.

And for Great Achievement in Sword Principle... Not a single person in Anjiu Prefecture had reached this level.

This lad’s talents in Sword Principle are truly astonishing. Lin Tiefeng thought to himself.

“Uncle Lin.” Jian Wushuang looked at Lin Tiefeng and said, “I have been troubling you and the Lin Family for more than three years. It’s about time and I should be returning to Incineration Moon City.”

“You are going back?” Lin Tiefeng furrowed his brows.

The surrounding crowd, including Lin Yan, Lin Yi, and many experts were also shocked.

If it was possible, they would of course want Jian Wushuang to remain in the Lin Mansion. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

With an expert that had achieved Great Achievement in Sword Principle to guide cultivators that specialized in Sword Principle, it would be even better than having a Chaotic Divine Demon guiding them.

However, they also knew Jian Wushuang wasn’t from the Lin Mansion after all. He was just a guest that resided in the Lin Mansion temporarily.

Now that Jian Wushuang wished to return to the Incineration Moon City, they naturally wouldn’t have any reason to stop him.

“I’ve been away from home for too long and I should be heading back,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Alright. ” Lin Tiefeng didn’t plan to get him to stay. “In that case, it’s already late today. I’ll get Lin Yi to send you back personally the next morning.”

“Thank you, Uncle Lin Yi.” Jian Wushuang turned to Lin Yi.

“You are being too courteous,” Lin Yi responded warmly.

Soon, Jian Wushuang returned to his room and started packing.

Although Lin Mansion was in chaos when Zhuge Hong arrived, peace returned after Zhuge Hong left.

Soon, the night fell.

In a luxurious restaurant of a city that was a short distance away from Lin Mansion,

An old man in a grey robe was standing in the room with his hands behind his back.

“Your honour, this is the information from the Lin Mansion.” A man in a silver robe entered the room and handed the grey-robed old man a jade bamboo strip.

The grey-robed old man took a quick glance at it as his murky eyes suddenly lit up.

“It’s him!”

The grey-robed old man mumbled to himself before waving his hand. “You may take your leave first.”

The man in the silver robe bowed and left the room.

The grey-robed old man brought the jade bamboo slip to the inner room of the restaurant. Zhuge Hong, who had been defeated by Jian Wushuang in the Lin Mansion previously, was sitting in the room.

“This is the information we got from Lin Mansion. You can take a look.” The grey-robed old man handed the jade bamboo strip to Zhuge Hong.

Although he was a Chaotic Divine Demon and definitely an elite expert or overlord class existence in Anjiu Prefecture, he was still rather humble before Zhuge Hong without any pretension.

He wasn’t from the Zhuge Family and obviously wasn’t a senior family member to Zhuge Hong.

However, he was from Dongzuo Sect and had been arranged by Zhuge Hong’s master to be here. His objective was to make things easier for Zhuge Hong.

By this point, Zhuge Hong had recovered his vitality. However, he still looked a little defeated and down. Clearly, the battle had been an overly huge blow to him. His pride and confidence had been ruthlessly trampled and it would have been difficult for him to recover immediately.

Nonetheless, he still took the jade bamboo strip and glanced at it.
