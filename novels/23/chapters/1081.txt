“Meng’er, we’re going home!”

His words made the blue-robed woman, Ji Wumeng, tremble. However, there was something in her eyes. She did not respond immediately.

He seemed to sense the latter’s worries, walked toward Jian Nantian, and held her hands. “I knew it, your responsibility, from your master. Don’t worry, I’ll take it for you. If I fail, there’s still Shuang’er. He’s a tough boy now.”

Ji Wumeng froze and then smiled.

“I see.”

Ji Wumeng responded and walked side by side with Jian Nantian toward the door. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Nantian had released her from the cuffs.

Outside the Heaven-ceasing Mountain, numerous experts were waiting for a result.

Soon, two figures emerged from Soul-crushing Pagoda. They held each other’s hands and walked side by side as if they had walked out from a fairy tale.

“Is that Jian Nantian’s wife, Jian Wushuang’s mother?”

“She looks normal, nothing special. Why has she been kept in Heaven-ceasing Mountain for so many years?”

The observing experts were all in doubt.

But soon, they knew why. Experts and clansman of the Ancient Monster Clan all gawked at the sight of Ji Wumeng.

“Is, is that…”

“Powerful, powerful bloodline aura. She’s much more powerful than Ancestor Ku Xin, much more than any of our clansmen!”

“We actually have a clansman whose bloodline is so pure?”

“Who is she? Why haven’t I seen her?”

Ji Wumeng’s existence had remained a secret, even in the Ancient Monster Clan. Ordinary experts were not able to see her at all.

Those who heard about her, only knew that she was trapped at Heaven-ceasing Peak, but fail t know why and her deep secrets. Now, Ji Wumeng had finally shown up.

Every Ancient Monster Clan clansman felt a fear from the bottom of their heart.

This kind of fear purely came from their bloodline.

It was like a normal copper-armored Ancient God standing in front of a real Imperial God.

Bearing a heavenly monster bloodline, all the Ancient Monster clansmen thought they were watching their king at the sight of Ji Wumeng.

What a supreme bloodline level!

Despite the clansmen’s shock, Celestial Master Ku Xin’s face paled.

He looked up, not in the direction of Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng, but to a Void in the distance.

“Why?

“Why don’t you stop him?

“Do you really want Jian Nantian to take my protege and waste her bloodline?

“What do you want!”

Roaring in his heart, Celestial Master Ku Xin looked angry and shocked.

In the direction Celestial Master Ku Xin was looking at, five figures hovered.

The five people just stood there without any Restriction or other methods. Under normal circumstance, as long as the experts present looked up, they would see. Nevertheless, never had they noticed the group of five.

They were a group of four men and a woman. All of their auras look ethereal and hard to grasp.

At that moment, all five of them felt the fury and grudge in Celestial Master Ku Xin’s eyes.

The only woman in the group broke the silence. “So we just watch him and do nothing? Do you forget how important Ji Wumeng’s bloodline is to our Green Fire Palace?

“Remember the price we pay to have her receive the Inheritance and reincarnate!

“Now, if Jian Nantian takes her away, all of our efforts will be in vain.”

A trace of Killing Intent was detected in the graceful woman’s voice.

Her rousing words stirred the rest four. They frowned with dismay.

They indeed had paid a high price for Ji Wumeng’s bloodline.

“Samsara, you’re Jian Nantian’s Master, why don’t tell us what to do?” The black-robed woman said in a low voice.

Samsara was a stout man wearing black armor, with a black horn on his forehead. He stood there without emitting any aura, but still looked formidable.

He was the very overlord on this Samsara Continent, Samsara Temple Master!

And he was also Jian Nantian’s Master.

“I know too well of my own disciple. Starting from the Ancient World, he had gone through a lot of hardship for Ji Wumeng!

“He’s paid too much all these years. All those hardships have failed to stop him, now, no one can.”

Samsara Temple Master looked calm. “When I received him as my personal disciple, I’ve told him everything about Ji Wumeng. He knows how important she is to our Green Fire Palace, even to the entire Green Fire World. But, he did it anyway, that means he’s confident!”

“Confident? He’s being selfish!” The black-robed woman snorted. “He’s doing it for himself. He puts the entire Green Fire World at stake. Samsara, what a great disciple you’ve received!”

“I know too well of my own disciple. No matter what you say, I believe he had a plan.” Samsara Temple Master said indifferently with his arms folded.

The black-robed woman could not argue anymore. Then, she looked at an old gold-robed elder beside her. The gold-robed elder grew a cinnabar mole between his eyebrows.

“Tang Emperor, what do you think?” The black-robed woman asked.

Tang Emperor just smiled and answered, “Ji Wumeng does have extraordinary bloodline and will be of great benefit to Green Fire Palace. But I also believe that Jian Nantian will help us too!”

“Ridiculous.” The black-robed woman jeered. “It’s indeed incredible that Jian Nantian devised the strongest Sword Principle in such a short time. Nevertheless, he’s been suppressed when he’s young. He won’t amount to anything great, at most, he’ll be like us. How will he match Ji Wumeng?”

“If Jian Nantian isn’t enough, how about adding Jian Wushuang?” Tang Emperor teased.

The black-robed woman was in a daze.

Jian Wushuang?
