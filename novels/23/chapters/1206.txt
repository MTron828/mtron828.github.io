Chapter 1207: Challenge

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

A massive figure, nearly three meters in height, entered the hall.

He wore a shinning scarlet armor, a scarlet helmet and a pair of war boots and carried a blood-red saber on his back. This was a killing-machine. The murderous aura that surrounded him was so strong that one could almost see a glint of red in his eyes.

“My Lord.” The figure bowed to the monarch of the Jin Kingdom.

“I know that you’ve been looking for an opponent who could match you skills for a while. I’ve found such an opponent for you, right there within the Battle Fortress. His name is Jian Wushuang.” The monarch challenged.

“Jian Wushuang?” The scarlet figure raised his head, and asked, “Does he have the Invincible Universe Master battle strength?”

“Undoubtedly.” The monarch nodded his head.

“Amazing!” The scarlet figure in a dangerous tone, anticipation flickering in his eyes.

“Go. Kill him as soon as you have the chance to.” The monarch ordered.

“Yes, my Lord.” The scarlet figure nodded his head and turned to leave.

After the scarlet figure was gone, the monarch of the Jin Kingdom continued, “Red Snow, you can leave. I will give you your orders later.”

“Yes, my Lord.”

The Red Snow King left immediately.

In the Green Fire Palace, the massive Battle Fortress was activated, with numerous shields blanketing the palace, it was as solid as an iron bucket.

Meanwhile, the experts staying at the Battle Fortress of the Green Fire World had already taken notice of the Spaceship’s arrival.

“That is the warship of the Jin Kingdom.”

The experts of the Green Fire World were stared at the ship with anger and determination in their cold faces.

The war was about to start.

The palace masters gathered right at the center of the Void within the Green Fire Palace.

The Samsara Temple Master looked around, and said, “The Jin Kingdom has sent spies in our Green Fire World, so they must know we have gathered all the experts who have passed the rank of Dao Master. However, they might not know that we took elixirs from the Loyalty Palace, that have greatly elevated the battle strength of our high-level cultivators.”

“Now, the Jin Kingdom must think that our battle strength is about the same as before. They might think we only have six Palace Masters and around 200 Holy Masters.”

“We can use this chance to surprise the Jin Kingdom with a heavy blow!”

“Yes we can,” Jian Wushuang and the others all agreed.

The fact that the Jin Kingdom’s understanding of them hadn’t grown in 80 years was a huge advantage to them.

“The main force of the Jin Kingdom has arrived, but we have no clue as to when they will launch their attack” the Samsara Temple Master said.

“We don’t have to worry about when they start their attack, we have are already prepared,” the Void Temple Master said seriously.

The Palace Masters around nodded their heads.

After 80 years, Green Fire World at present was well-prepared.

Suddenly…

A scarlet streak flew towards them from the direction of the Spaceship.

“Someone is coming!” Red Lotus said.

All the other Palace Master looked in the direction of the ship.

“They only sent one person?”

“What is he going to do?”

Shock filled the faces of the Palace Masters.

The red figure halted 10,000 miles away from the fortress.

The scarlet figure looked toward the Battle Fortress with blood and anger in his eyes, but no matter how he tried, he could not see who was inside the Battle Fortress due to the protections around it. But then, his horrible voice echoed out and spread across the vast distance.

“I am the first general of the monarch of the Jin Kingdom,?Long Xu King!”

“Jian Wushuang, do you dare to battle with me in a fight to the finish?”

His challenge spread through the Fortress, surprising all the experts inside.

“Is he challenging someone?”

“He came alone?”

“Did he challenge Palace Master Wushuang?”

“Palace Master Wushuang is the most powerful man in the Green Fire World. This man is just asking to die!”

Voices filled the Battle Fortress, and most of the Dao Masters around the edge of the Palace were clumped together to discuss the sudden appearance of the lone scarlet figure, Long Xu King.

In the gathering of Palace Masters at the Void,

Animosity toward the Long Xu King was written clearly across their faces.

“He dares to challenge Jian Wushuang?” the Samsara Temple Master frowned slightly and said, “Jian Wushuang is the best expert of our Green Fire Palace and widely recognized as a prdigy. He could be considered the backbone of our Green Fire World. But even before the war has started, the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom dares to issue a challenge to him?”

“Hmm. The Jin Kindom Monarch seems to have a plan”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He and the other experts sensed a motive behind the monarch’s actions.

The challenge from the Long Xu King seemed normal at first, but there was definitely more to it.

After all, he was challenging Jian Wushuang, the spiritual backbone of the Green Fire World. If he failed in this challenge, their morale would suffer a heavy blow.

If the best cultivator on their side couldn’t beat a lowly general from the Jin Kingdom, what damage could the Dao Masters or even the Holy Masters do? During the 80 years, the Samsara Temple Master had tried his best to build their confidence, but he worried that this one challenge might destroy all his efforts.

And even if Jian Wushuang managed to beat the general, the outcome wouldn’t have a negative effect on the Jin Kingdom’s morale. Their monarch was even more powerful than this general that they had sent.

“Their strength is far superior to ours, but the Jin Monarch is still choosing to attack us in stages to harm our morale. What a prudent man!” Temple Master Void said.

“It said that the Long Xu King is the best general under the monarch, and he can even compete with the Red Snow King. Judging by this, he is almost unbeatable. Jian Wushuang, will you accept his challenge?” the Samsara Temple Master asked of Jian Wushuang.

The other Palace Masters around also looked to him.

Jian Wushuang thought for a moment and nodded his head, “I will accept!”

“You will?” the Samsara Temple Master was a little bit shocked. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Our enemy has come to our territory to issue a challenge. If I don’t face him, our morale will be greatly influenced, so I have no choice but to fight him!” Jian Wushuang said resolutely.

“Are you sure you can win?” the Samsara Temple Master frowned.

“Win?” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Of course!”
