Chapter 757: Traces

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On a nameless hill in the Tianqi Mountains, Jian Wushuang and five Palace Masters of the Ancient Sect were chatting.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m so happy to see you alive,” Palace Master Destruction said. “In a few days, the Eternal Zone will close again. Please leave with us before that happens.”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Well, what’s your plan for the next couple of days? Do you want to travel with us or go by yourself?” Palace Master Destruction asked another question.

“I still have some things to take care of. So, I may not be able to join you this time,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Are you going to deal with the three magnates?” Palace Master Destruction cast a significant look at him.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“With your current strength, experts from the three magnates in the Tianqi Mountains are hardly a threat to you. But you still need to be careful,” Palace Master Destruction advised.

“I know.”

He gave a smile. “By the way, is there any chance you know who the Eternal Realm expert from the Boundless Demon Sect that hunted me down was?”

Jian Wushuang had not forgotten Gu Qiong, to whom he owed a lot.

Gu Qiong had died for him. His death had become a thorn growing in Jian Wushuang’s heart. He was absolutely determined to kill the Eternal Realm expert who had chased after him back then.

“Judging by his appearance, strength, and the attack style that you just described, I reckon it was An Chao!” Palace Master Destruction said solemnly.

“An Chao?” Jian Wushuang memorized this name by heart.

“Speaking of An Chao…” The expressions of Palace Master Baiyu and Vice Palace Master Ling Yu suddenly turned weird.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang looked at them.

“Jian Wushuang, frankly, not long ago, when Ling Yu and I were adventuring in the Tianqi Mountains, we ran into An Chao,” Palace Master Baiyu began.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang’s face altered.

“The place we met him is not far from here. When we saw him, he was with three guys, all experts from the Boundless Demon Sect. One of them was Xia Yuan!” Palace Master Baiyu said.

“Xia Yuan?” Jian Wushuang repeated, staring at Palace Master Baiyu in bewilderment.

“Xia Yuan is extremely strong. He is at Step Two of the Eternal Realm. A few days ago, he usurped a Baptismal Pool and successfully used it to transform into a Copper-armored Demon God. When he assumes the form of a Copper-armored Demon God, his battle strength will reach Step Three of the Eternal Realm,” Palace Master Baiyu said.

An Eternal Realm expert with a battle strength at Step Three of the Eternal Realm could be counted as the strongest expert in the Firmament Territory.

Among the Palace Masters of the Ancient Sect, only Palace Master Destruction had a viable chance of putting up a fight against him.

“The four of them must be traveling as a group. I’m afraid that they are still wandering about in that area,” Palace Master Baiyu added.

Jian Wushuang simply took out the map of the Tianqi Mountains.

“Palace Master Baiyu, where did you meet them?” he asked.

Palace Master Baiyu quickly looked through the map and pointed a finger at a giant mountain. “Here, near the Ice Fire Mountain.”

“Here?” Jian Wushuang tilted his head a little. “Thanks a lot.”

Jian Wushuang put the map away. He cupped his hands at Palace Master Destruction and the other four. He was ready to leave.

“Jian Wushuang, remember, in seven days, you have to hurry to the Heavenly Stone Valley and find our Ancient Sect’s assembly place. If you miss this chance, you can only stay in the Eternal Zone for another hundred years,” Palace Master Destruction yelled.

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang shouted back. He was already flying away.

On the hill, Palace Master Destruction and the other four were standing in a line. They watched Jian Wushuang gradually fly out of sight and then heaved a sigh.

“The kid has upgraded his strength to such a level in merely a hundred years. Even we can’t catch up with him now.”

“I always knew he was very talented. But I never expected him to be so powerful!”

“Destruction, over the past a hundred years, you’ve been bragging about Feng, your personal disciple, showing him off like a star, right? You also said that in less than a thousand years, Feng could enter the Eternal Realm, right? How about you let this disciple have a fight against Jian Wushuang and we can see who is better?” Palace Master Mo Tao said jokingly.

“Fight? What for?” Palace Master Destruction breathed a puff of air into his beard, his face thoroughly bitter.

Feng?

Whether he could break through the Eternal Realm was still unknown.

Even if he did, there was no way he could be more powerful than Jian Wushuang, could he?

…

Following Palace Master Baiyu’s directions, Jian Wushuang headed for the Ice Fire Mountain.

It took him less than half a day to reach the foot of the Ice Fire Mountain.

“I wonder if An Chao and his lot are still around,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He began to loaf about in the vast region around the Ice Fire Mountain.

Only two hours later, he detected the emergency signal of the Ancient God Clan. He rushed there as fast as he could.

However, since the source of the signal was quite far, by the time he got there, the fight was already over.

The water in a Baptismal Pool had been taken by someone. The two Ancient God Clansmen responsible for guarding the Baptismal Pool were both severely injured. Thanks to the timely arrival of other clansmen, they had not been killed.

Jian Wushuang inquired about the human experts who attacked them.

The answers they gave were exactly what Jian Wushuang wanted to hear.

According to the account of the two injured clansmen, four human experts had attacked them, one of whom transformed into a copper-armored Ancient God. There was also a glum elder in their group, who was supposed to be An Chao.

“Seems that the four from the Boundless Demon Sect are still around.”

Jian Wushuang squinted into the surroundings and muttered, “There are six Baptismal Pools in the vicinity of the Ice Fire Mountain. They’ve already robbed one of them, they must be biding their time to rob the rest.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

Once the Boundless Demon Sect experts struck again, his opportunity would come.

…

Jian Wushuang continued to wander around the Ice Fire Mountain, waiting for the four Boundless Demon Sect experts to strike again.

Meanwhile, on the bank of a small nameless lake near the Ice Fire Mountain, four figures were sitting together.

“Haha, Following Mr. Xia Yuan is great. Look, we obtained a Baptismal Pool without effort!” An Chao, a glum black-robed elder, said with a chilling voice.

“Well, it’s just a Baptismal Pool, not a big deal.” A strapping shirtless man snorted.

This was Xia Yuan, the most powerful among the group of four.

An Chao gave a dry smile and did not dare to say more.

Xia Yuan looked around, “We investigated before, there are six Baptismal Pools at the Ice Fire Mountain. We only have one. It’s nothing to brag about. If we can obtain all six Baptismal Pools, that will be something.”

“And our next target is this one…”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
