Chapter 2253 Ultimate Kill!

Without Jian Wushuang needing to remind him, Emperor Bai had already executed his Punisher’s Hell, as golden waves plunged for Old Monster Jiao.But as Old Monster Jiao, a crimson region had formed, blocking against the golden waves. The golden waves were not able to dissipate the crimson region, and Old Monster Jiao was left unharmed.

“Crap,” Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai’s faces were sour.

They could tell that they had forced Old Monster Jiao to his limit. The crimson secret restriction must have been his last resort.

If they were not able to take down Old Monster Jiao, all their efforts would go down the drain.

The Old Monster Jiao... he had gathered twenty-odd Chaotic Divine Demons at such short notice to take revenge for his Scaly.

If they were not able to take down Old Monster Jiao, he would continue to try to take revenge. There would be more Ancient Era experts by then.

Because of that, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were determined to keep him.

But now...

“He’s too fast. My Moon Picking Skill’s not able to reach him, nor any of my other secret skills,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes went cold.

“If I used Secret Skills of Star Palace, it’d spread Punisher’s Hell’s radius tenfold to limit his speed. But now he’s already escaped to the edges of the golden Divine Power Sea. I won’t be able to stop him no matter what,” Emperor Bai was indignant.

Both of them chased him as hard as they could.

But the distance between them was only getting wider.

They watched as he reached the edge of the golden Divine Power Sea and rushed out of its radius.

It was impossible for them to chase him after he had escaped the Divine Power Sea.

“Can we do nothing but let him escape?” Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were very indignant.

But at that moment, something bizarre happened!

Outside the Divine Power Sea where Old Monster Jiao was, a large hand that seemed to have held the entire sky appeared.

The hand was grey and murky and contained another power other than boundless Divine Power.

It was Reincarnation Power!

The hand appeared in front of Old Monster Jiao without warning.

Old Monster Jiao was in a miserable state.

The crimson secret restriction between his brows was still there – they were not that easy to activate.

Furthermore, he had been seriously injured by Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai, he was like an oil-exhausted lamp.

Luckily, he had escaped the golden Divine Power Sea before the crimson secret restriction had dissipated.

That meant that he had successfully escaped.

All he needed to do was to escape and restore his powers.

“Emperor Bai, and Sword Emperor!”

Old Monster Jiao clenched his fists in rage.

“You two shall wait. I will be back! No chances will be given to you then!”

“If twenty is not enough, I’ll bring two hundred! Just wait and see!”

He was already planning how to take revenge against the Sanctuary Alliance.

But at that moment, the large hand that seemed to have held the entire sky appeared.

“What?” Old Monster Jiao was in a state of shock.

He had his eyes dead on that hand. The hand’s endless Reincarnation Power could have been easily blocked if not for the injuries sustained from when he was fighting Jian Wushuang. Furthermore, he was already on the run for his life!

“This aura, it’s you, old geezer!”

Old Monster Jiao let out a hysterical roar, for he had recognised the owner of that hand.

He was completely enraged because he recognised it!

Fit of rage!

He had never expected to fall into the old geezer’s trick after escaping from Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

“No!”

With a roar, the Old Monster Jiao was completely covered by that hand.

Under his resistance, the hand did not kill him but slapped him with terrifying power. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He had originally been on the run, with Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai behind him.

Now, he was being slapped back by the palm?

In the direction of Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai?

“There’s our chance!” Jian Wushuang was elated as his nine Hong Jun Golden Swords went bursting out.

The Blood Mountain Sword was rolled out as well.

Chi!

Chi!

Chi!

Old Monster Jiao’s body could no longer defend against the golden streaks of light and had his head cut off by the sword of Jian Wushuang.

Old Monster Jiao, who had dominated the Ancient Era, with a name back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, was now dead!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai gathered together to witness the decapitated Old Monster Jiao, and heaved a sigh of relief.

“He’s finally dead!”

“He’s dead at last.”

While Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were relieved, they were still gasping regarding what had happened.

The Ancient Era experts were not to be underestimated even under the restrictions placed on the earth.

The Ancient Era experts that Jian Wushuang had slaughtered were at Chaotic Divine Demon at best.

But Old Monster Jiao was terrifying.

Even under the restrictions, regardless of Jian Wushuang or Emperor Bai – none of them to take him down.

Even when they had teamed up, he had almost escaped.

Jian Wushuang could not imagine how strong he would have been at his pinnacle.

Like when Jian Wushuang had taken down Blood Emperor.

Then what about people like Emperor Thirteen... strong enough to shake and alter the restrictions based on power alone?

“Ancient Era, Absolute Beginning Divine World... I wonder how powerful that place was,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Yes, that hand...” Emperor Bai opened his mouth.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze shifted.
