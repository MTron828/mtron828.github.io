Chapter 5391: Black Hole

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Staying behind here while they advanced was a great opportunity.

Watching the retreating army, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but smile. He turned to look at the people who stayed with him.

Ever since he devoured the origin source of time, the evil aura within his origin source had diminished, completely suppressed by him.

Now, looking at these unsuspecting followers, that malevolent aura gradually surged.

Seeing the somewhat nervous Emperor, Jian Wushuang revealed a hint of surprise and looked towards Xia Mang Guanyu, saying, “Your Highness, why don’t you take a rest here for a moment? We’ll handle the watch!”

“No, no, it’s time for you all to rest!”

Whoosh.

Xia Mang Guanyu’s appearance began to change, instantly reverting to his original form. The powerful Thought power swept across the surrounding tens of millions of miles.

“Hehe, haven’t used this move in a long time!” Jian Wushuang grinned and said, “One Thought!’

Buzz!

The heavens and earth surged, and the aura circulated.

The space within tens of millions of miles was instantly engulfed and collapsed; this vast expanse was his world.

In the east, a dazzling sun rose, and in the west, a dark moon accompanied by an extreme cold force gradually ascended.

And Jian Wushuang himself was like a black hole.

“What is this?”

“He’s not Xia Mang Guanyu!!

The first to react were those tier 4 Emperors who had been recruited by Jian Wushuang. They were most afraid of death and had never willingly joined Jian Wushuang, only doing so for the godstones.

It was a bit regrettable for the Lou Hou Battle Formation. After practicing for so long, it had never been used once, and now it was going to be overkill.

Devouring these people wouldn’t actually provide much improvement; the main issue was that these people were too troublesome. What he wanted to devour was that Black Hole.

Even Bai Junwang, hiding within Jian Wushuangs body, watched with an accelerated heartbeat. These people were excellent materials for a blood sacrifice!

“Hmph, no matter who you are, daring to disguise as the Great Xia Prince and attacking us, capture him first!”

There were dozens of Emperors present, including several tier 4 Emperors.

In the past, Jian Wushuang might have had trouble dealing with so many people.

But now!

His Thought force condensed the universe, swallowing and condensing a black hole.

And the power of All Things is the power of the universe.

A mere Emperor dares to resist the will of the universe, simply seeking death.

“Universe!”

Jian Wushuang roared, and the void within thousands of miles instantly burst and collapsed. These tier 4 Emperors couldn’t resist, considering their strength was generally only at ordinary levels of tier 4.

The universe formed, and these Emperors were unable to move under its oppression. Those Dao Lords and some weaker Emperors even directly fell.

Only those tier 4 Emperors could still resist.

Jian Wushuang transformed directly into an Eight-Armed Heavenly Demon, grabbing one tier 4 Emperor in each hand, and directly crushed the opponent’s head.

An evil aura rose, starting to devour the origins of these people.

Bai Junwang was already used to seeing this scene, but when he saw Jian

Wushuangs skilled techniques, he couldn’t help but feel a chill in his heart.

Especially seeing Jian Wushuang devouring his victims without intending to offer blood sacrifices, he wanted to remind him. However, when he saw the crimson eyes of Jian Wushuang, he swallowed his words back.

In just three breaths, everyone present was completely devoured.

An aura of evil lingered, akin to thunder flickering in the surroundings. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

With a casual release of divine power, a force congealed and thrown out, creating a thunderous explosion that swept the battlefield clean.

The sky condensed into a fine drizzle.

Previously, when there was a phenomenon of Emperor Fall, there would still be some scattered origin sources. But now, not to mention origin fragments, there wasn’t even a trace of the Emperor’s lingering regret—everything was devoured by him.

Exhaling, the One Thought Universe abruptly froze.

These people could only be considered as a cup of tea before a meal. The real feast was the black hole.

Staring at the enormous Black Hole, the devouring force within it was many times stronger than him.

If it were only the power of devouring, he probably wouldn’t be able to swallow the opponent. Instead, he might end up being engulfed. For a moment, Jian Wushuang was unsure how to proceed.

Crackling!

Inside, the force of devouring contained endless destruction, a power surpassing that of a tier 5 Emperor, something Jian Wushuang couldn’t contend with.

“Thought power?” A thought stirred in Jian Wushuangs mind. The immense Thought power entered the Black Hole along with the devouring power, only to be destroyed by the force of annihilation as soon as it entered.

Re-concentrating Thought power, this time, it was wrapped in the devouring force, attempting to slip through unnoticed, just like the force within the Black Hole.

This time, indeed, it penetrated to a deeper level. Jian Wushuang even felt as if he had entered another universe. However, before he could continue exploring, that train of thought was annihilated once again.

Neither telekinesis nor devouring force worked. Jian Wushuang was left with only the power of All Things.

Embracing all things, much like everything devoured by a Black Hole.

The steamed bun, once thrown to the dog, was irretrievable.

Jian Wushuang found himself in a dilemma.

The black hole resembled a table of tantalizing food, yet he couldn’t lay his hands on it.

Bai Junwang kept his eyes fixed on the black hole, utterly clueless. However, the more he looked, the more familiar it seemed. Finally, he exclaimed, “What is this?”

At that moment, he thought of the abyss where Shen Ling Odwelled, finding a striking resemblance between it and the Black Hole.

Though the abyss lacked the devouring power, when he was above it, he felt a force that didn’t belong to this world.

Back then, he dared not ask too much. Without that abyss, he would have withered and died long ago.

Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang remarked, “What’s this? Do you have some understanding of Black Holes too?”

Though Bai Junwang pursued the path of the divine body, his origin source was not weak, likely reaching the level of a Black Hole.

After all, as a pinnacle expert who ascended to the peak with a divine body, even if his origin was inferior, he should have reached the realm of black holes.

Just like those strong ones following the origin source path, even with a weak divine body, it would be 30,000 times stronger.

Some dual-cultivators, with 50,000-fold stronger divine bodies, could reach the cosmic realm with their origin source.

That’s what defined true strength.

The Ultimate Emperor’s origin progressed faster, like Jian Wushuang. Perhaps, by the time he reached the tier 5 Emperor, he could aspire to the level of Universe.

The sole Ultimate Emperor in the Original Universe was truly extraordinary.

By the tier 5, his origin source had reached the Universe-level. Subsequently, he condensed the embryonic form of universe origin source, creating his own universe secret techniques.

Now, entering tier 6, he probably surpassed the Qishen Temple.

The Ultimate Emperor at tier 6, with his origin source at that level, likely had no match even in the Qishen Temple.

Jian Wushuangs speed wasn’t considered slow.

Compared to those Ultimate Dao Lords on the Grave God Mountain, he had already surpassed them by a significant margin.

Now, he could effortlessly kill tier 4 Emperors.

If he devoured this black hole, he could reach the realm of Black Holes. This was simply unheard of for a cultivator at the Dao Lord level.

But now, he was stuck here.

Feeling somewhat helpless for a moment.

Bai Junwang grunted, reluctant to say more. Jian Wushuang knew that it must be related to that Shen Ling.

“Ask Shen Ling for me, is this black hole related to him?” Jian Wushuang was persistent. With the benefits laid out before him, he was not willing to give up.
