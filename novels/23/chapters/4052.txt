Chapter 4053: Di Huo’s Challenge

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Di Huo?” Jian Wushuang looked at the purple-robed young man calmly.

“I heard that you have passed the fourth level of the Principle Sea. I would like to fight with you. Do you dare to accept my challenge?” Di Huo asked directly.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. When he saw Di Huo’s gaze, he had guessed what Di Huo was trying to do. However, he did not expect Di Huo to challenge him so directly.

Jian Wushuang did not respond immediately, but Golden Feather Star Lord snorted and said, “Di Huo, you are already a fourth-level Ruler, but Blood Sword is only a second-level Ruler. How dare you challenge him?”

“Of course I won’t bully him. When we fight, I will deliberately control the power of my divine power. I will only use the power of the fusion of the five Principles. I will only rely on my comprehension of the universe Principles and the Dao to fight.” Green Flame continued to stare at Jian Wushuang. “Why? Don’t you dare?”

!!

Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face.

“My young friend Blood Sword.”

Someone spoke again, but at this moment, it was Emperor Flame’s Ruler, Green Flame Star Lord.

“My young friend, can you speak from the side?” Green Flame Star Lord said with a smile.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Immediately, Green Flame Star Lord and Jian Wushuang came to the side. Moreover, Green Flame Star Lord directly blocked the surrounding space and time, obviously not wanting their conversation to be heard by others.

“Blood Sword, I’m sorry. Although my disciple is talented, he is too arrogant. In addition, he has been recognized as the number one genius in the Bone Pupil Star Field all these years. No one can compare with him, which makes him more arrogant. That’s why he came to challenge you today,” Green Flame Star Lord said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was obvious that Di Huo had always been the number one genius in the Bone Pupil Galaxy. Now that someone with a higher talent and comprehension than him had suddenly appeared, Di Huo was not convinced and wanted to fight.

“Do you want to accept the challenge?” Asked Green Flame Star Lord.

“Green Flame Star Lord, do you want me to accept the challenge or not?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“If you are confident that you can defeat my disciple, I hope you can accept the challenge,” Green Flame Star Lord said.

“Oh, why?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“I just said that my disciple is good at everything, but he is too arrogant and arrogant. This is not a good thing for him. So if possible, I hope you can teach him a lesson and let him know that there is always someone better than him. Of course, I won’t let you do it for nothing. I can give you a Principle Supreme Treasure as a reward,” Green Flame Star Lord said.

After hearing what the Star Lord said, Jian Wushuang’s expression became even more strange.

He did not expect that the Star Lord wanted to ask him to teach his disciple a lesson.

However, it was also true that Di Huo’s arrogant personality was fine in the Bone Pupil Galaxy. However, if he went to the vast universe in the future, he might cause trouble because of his personality.

Teaching him a lesson earlier would be very helpful to Di Huo.

“Green Flame Star Lord, I will agree to fight with him. I will also teach him a lesson according to what you said. As for the reward, there’s no need for it,” Jian Wushuang said.

It was a piece of cake. Jian Wushuang really did not want any reward.

“Thank you, Blood Sword.” A smile appeared on Green Flame Star Lord’s face.

Soon, they returned to Di Huo.

Di Huo looked at his Ruler, Green Flame Star Lord, in confusion, but he found that the latter looked unfathomable. He was also confused and did not know what his Ruler had said to Jian Wushuang.

“Di Huo, I agree to fight with you,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Very good, where shall we fight?” Di Huo’s eyes were shining.

“I’m in a hurry, so I don’t need to pick a place to fight. Let’s fight here,” Jian Wushuang said casually.

“Humph, arrogant.” Di Huo was enraged by Jian Wushuang’s attitude.

In the void of the island, Jian Wushuang and Di Huo stood face to face at a certain distance, while Green Flame Star Lord and Golden Feather Star Lord had long retreated to the side.

Leng Rushuang, Devil Flame, and Gui Yun stood together.

“Humph, Emperor Fire just passed the second level of the Principle Sea. Does he think he’s so great? Not to mention that he’s deliberately suppressing the power of his divine power, even if he goes all out, he probably won’t be a match for Ruler.” Devil Flame secretly curled his lips.

In the void, Emperor Fire’s eyes were cold, and a cyan saber appeared in his hand.

The cyan saber was burning with a raging Green Flame, which was enough to make an ordinary Ruler’s heart palpitate.

“Blood Sword, you’re the first person in hundreds of thousands of years that I really want to fight. I hope you won’t disappoint me in this battle.” Di Huo held the Green Flame saber with one hand and stared at Jian Wushuang with a burning gaze.

“I’m in a hurry. Don’t be so long-winded. Hurry up and fight so that I can get rid of you so that I can continue my journey.” Jian Wushuang looked impatient.

“You’re too arrogant.” Di Huo was completely enraged by Jian Wushuang. He did not waste any more words and directly attacked.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Numerous phantoms burst out at the same time.

Di Huo actually conjured nine figures at the same time. Whether it was their appearance, aura, or the movements of their hands, they were all exactly the same, even the soul power of a Ruler could not tell which of the nine figures was his real body.

The nine figures rushed over at the same time. The cyan-colored flame saber in their hands was raised high and ready to cut down.

“Emperor Fire’s comprehension of the universe principles is far inferior to mine. Like me, he also doesn’t know how to better Ruler these universe principles.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, but suddenly he moved.

“Swish!”

Jian Wushuang’s entire body turned into a cold sword light and flashed out in an instant.

His speed was too fast.

Before Di Huo could even slash out his saber, the cold sword light that Jian Wushuang transformed into had already struck his many figures.

In that instant, Di Huo’s eight figures were directly crushed into pieces. As for his original body, it was also struck by the terrifying sword light, and his entire body was forced back in an extremely sorry state, it was not easy for him to regain his balance.

“You lost.”

Jian Wushuang reappeared in the void and looked at Di Huo indifferently.

Di Huo, on the other hand, was completely stunned.

In just a moment —

He was the one who attacked first, but he was defeated before he could swing his saber.

There was no room for struggle.

The gap between the two was just too big!
