Chapter 1338: Triumph in Ranking Battle!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Less than three months? No wonder.” The red-haired elderly suddenly understood and sighed, “A genius like that is hard to come by. It’s a pity that Snow Dojo got their hands on him first.”

“The Master of Silence Gloriette, your Snow Dojo is lucky this time. For the next ranking battle, you won’t be so lucky.”

The red-haired elderly said, then his figure suddenly dissolved into thin air.

“Humph, with such a genius, it’d still be Snow Dojo who wins the next ranking battle,” the Master of Silence Gloriette replied.

After the red-haired elderly left, the Master of Silence Gloriette looked at those golden-dressed deacons, “Wu Cang, you’re a man of vision.”

“Thank you, master,” Wu Cang showed a smile and he felt relief.

The Master of Silence Gloriette said that he would tear his skin off earlier. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Luckily, Jian Wushuang managed to reach them in time and pulled off impressive tricks. His one lift helped Snow Dojo to win the victory for the ranking battle.

“Oh yeah, what’s the man’s name? How did you come across him?” The Master of Silence Gloriette asked casually. He looked like he was in a good mood.

“His name is Jian Wushuang. I met him when I wandered in the outside world. He is definitely the strongest genius I have ever seen,” Wu Cang replied. Of course, Jian Wushuang intentionally reminded Wu Cang so he didn’t reveal to the Master of Silence Gloriette that Jian Wushuang was an Inverse Cultivator.

“A Universe God in the First Heaven who has such impressive consciousness, attack skill and such terrifying divine power. He is really out of the ordinary,” the Master of Silence Gloriette nodded as he complimented.

Previously, when Jian Wushuang took action in Mountain Rock World, no one else had seen it clearer than him.

“Such a genius, if we Snow Dojo nurture him properly, his achievement definitely wouldn’t be any weaker than Chen Feng. Maybe even stronger,” the Master of Silence Gloriette smiled.

“Master, Jian Wushuang, he… I’m afraid he didn’t intend to stay in Snow Dojo,” Wu Cang said.

“Oh? Why?” The Master of Silence Gloriette creased his eyebrows and asked.

Wu Cang didn’t hide anything, briefly telling the Master of Silence Gloriette the ins and outs of the story.

“Is that so? Jian Wushuang wanted to get the travel route to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries from me and that’s why he won the ranking battle for me?” The Master of Silence Gloriette nodded, “the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. I once stayed for a while in one of the sanctuaries. It is a place that people yearned for. Jian Wushuang has such talent. It is very normal that he wants to go to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. It’s such a pity.”

The Master of Silence Gloriette sighed in disappointment.

For a genius like Jian Wushuang, he, of course, wanted for Jian Wushuang to stay in Snow Dojo if possible.

However, Wu Cang said that he already invited him once and advised him. However, Jian Wushuang had made up his mind.

“Master.”

Wu Chao among the golden-dressed deacons stood up and said, “If Jian Wushuang only won a ranking battle for Snow Dojo and he is going to leave right after that, there’s no need for us to give him the quota to enter Tian Yuan Mystery Land. We could totally give it to the other geniuses in Snow Dojo.”

Wu Cang’s face suddenly grew grave.

The main goal of Jian Wushuang was of course for the travel route to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. However, Tian Yuan Mystery Land was a great chance too. Hence, it’d be great if he could obtain that chance.

Then, Wu Chao wanted to pass the quota that originally belonged to Jian Wushuang to other people.

“The quota to enter Tian Yuna Mystery Land should still be for him.”

The Master of Silence Gloriette replied, “He won the ranking battle on behalf of Snow Dojo. Supposedly, he should get some benefit. It’s only a quota for Tian Yuan Mystery Land. We at Snow Dojo are not that stingy.”

As the Master of Silence Gloriette had ordered it, Wu Chao naturally didn’t dare to go against him.

“Qing, you take care of the rest of the matter,” the Master of Silence Gloriette instructed.

“Certainly,” the first deacon, Master Qing, nodded.

“I shall return first. Wu Cang, bring that man to see me later.”

Then, the Master of Silence Gloriette vanished into thin air on the stand.

…

The ranking battle had ended. The experts on the training field slowly dispersed as the result was out.

The people in Mountain Rock World came out from the middle of the training field as well.

Many geniuses from Universe God Palace gathered and they looked embarrassed. Their gazes were fixed on a figure on the opposite side.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“It’s him. He defeated all seven of our geniuses at once. Even Lu Qing couldn’t resist his stroke!”

“Jian Wushuang, I wonder where he popped out from.”

The geniuses from Universe God Palace discussed among themselves.

Before the ranking battle begun, they would pay closer attention to geniuses from their opponent. For instance, their top representative, Long Hao was someone they focused on.

However, Jian Wushuang… He joined Snow Dojo for about three months time and he was extremely low profile during those three months. No one knew his true power in Snow Dojo, so Universe God Palace naturally wouldn’t know either.

They never expected that the scariest genius in Snow Dojo wasn’t Long Hao but this person named Jian Wushuang.

“He’s too strong.”

Lu Qing stood there and watched Jian Wushuang too. He was upset.

He remembered clearly how Jian Wushuang killed him with one stroke in Mountain Rock World.

He thought Jian Wushuang was only good with consciousness attacks, but he never expected his divine power explosion would be that terrifying too.

He wasn’t defeated unjustly. Their difference was too vast.

As for the geniuses from Snow Dojo, they looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

They clearly knew that they would have lost the ranking battle if it wasn’t because of Jian Wushuang.

Dong Ao was among the crowd too. But then Dong Ao was well-behaved and he even didn’t have the courage to look at Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Previously, he thought Jian Wushuang defeated him by a fluke. However, after the ranking battle, he finally understood.

He didn’t win by a fluke. Jian Wushuang was much stronger than him.

Jian Wushuang obviously didn’t put in any effort during the fight three months ago.

Swoosh!

A figure appeared next to Jian Wushuang. It was Wu Cang.

“Jian Wushuang, I talked to the Master of Silence Gloriette. The Master of Silence Gloriette wants me to bring you to see him,” Wu Cang said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was delighted. He didn’t bother with the people around him but left with Wu Cang to see the Master of Silence Gloriette.

In Snow Dojo, there was a palace that was entirely black. All the decorations and embellishments in the palace were black too.

Wu Cang and Jian Wushuang walked into the black palace.

“Master, I brought Jian Wushuang,” Wu Cang said politely.

“Mm, you may go now,” the Master of Silence Gloriette who was seated on the throne in the palace waved.

Wu Cang left immediately.

In the black palace, there were only Jian Wushuang and the Master of Silence Gloriette left.

“Jian Wushuang, greet the Master of Silence Gloriette.”

Jian Wushuang bowed politely in response.
