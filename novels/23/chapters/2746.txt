Chapter 2747: Organizing Treasures

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang had previously displayed the triple oppression method that consisted of Star Armor Domain, Prison of Punishment, and Sword World superimposed on each other when he used it to suppress Saber Master who ended in a miserable state of defeat.

He had four methods of oppression at that moment with the additional Golden Feather Phantom Mirror—all of which were extremely powerful.

It would cause a considerable amount of suppression on a High-level Grand Ultimate God or even a genuine Peak Grand Ultimate God when those four oppression methods were unleashed and superimposed.

It would be a great advantage for Jian Wushuang in a duel.

After refining the Golden Feather Phantom Mirror, Jian Wushuang took out a pitch-black defensive armor that looked like the scales of a ferocious beast.

Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen used to wear that defensive armor.

“This is a Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure defensive armor and is the best defensive armor I’ve seen, but unfortunately it’s been severely damaged.” Jian Wushuang disappointingly shook his head.

Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen obtained the defensive armor that had the amazing physical protective ability from the secret realm. It was unfortunate that he went against Saber Master who was using a Holy Treasure.

No matter how strong the physical protective ability of the defensive armor, it could not gain an advantage in the face of a Holy Treasure.

Saber Master killed Hong Chen by making a slit through the defensive armor with a single saber move before finally beheading Hong Chen.

The defensive armor’s value greatly depreciated after it was severely damaged.

Jian Wushuang put the defensive armor aside before taking out the Purple Imperial Bell and Holy Treasure Crimson Battle Saber belonging to Saber Master.

Jian Wushuang was carefully examining them.

“The Purple Imperial Bell isn’t too bad.” Jian Wushuang was grinning.

The defensive armor he took out earlier was only good for defending one’s divine body while the Purple Imperial Bell was a comprehensive physical protective treasure.

It could directly withstand face-to-face physical as well as soul attacks. Therefore, it could also be regarded as a soul defensive treasure.

In addition, the force bombarded on the Purple Imperial Bell would produce a sonic boom counterattack upon resisting an attack.

Jian Wushuang had seen the Purple Imperial Bell’s potential when it was still in Saber Master’s hands.

Its defensive ability was extremely powerful since it managed to even repel Long Xianzi’s Meteor Bead’s terrifying power.

The only flaw was its defensive barrier would weaken over time from repeated impacts struck by the opponent. Once the barrier was destroyed, it would take quite some time to recover before being put to use once again.

“Although its protective barrier could not be immediately restored, its value was still several times more expensive than the Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure defensive armor.” Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately claimed ownership of the Purple Imperial Bell which was soon refined and fused into his divine body.

“My physical protective ability is extremely powerful on top of my perfect immortal body. It’s almost impossible for the average expert to kill me. The Purple Imperial Bell isn’t very useful to me but since I shouldn’t expose my immortal body just yet, it’s not a bad idea to use the Purple Imperial Bell as a disguise.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Next, he looked at the Crimson Battle Saber.

The Crimson Battle Saber was truly a Holy Treasure!

“Even an Undying Saint would cherish a Holy Treasure.” Jian Wushuang was excited.

“The defensive armor and Purple Imperial Bell are extremely precious, but the Crimson Battle Saber’s value is probably more than ten times the Purple Imperial Bell’s.” Jian Wushuang was beaming.

Holy Treasure and Heavenly Treasure were very different.

A Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure was definitely far less valuable than an ordinary Holy Treasure regardless it was an offensive-type divine weapon.

Unfortunately, the Holy Treasure was absolutely useless to Jian Wushuang since it’s a battle saber, so he could only sell it to exchange for the resources he needed.

After sorting out those treasures, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took out an Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang could not wait to explore the contents in the Interspatial Ring in front of him.

It was the final Interspatial Ring Old Gu offered and was also the one that made five Grand Ultimate Gods compete for it frantically.

No one else would know the Interspatial Ring’s contents apart from Saber Master who initially received it.

However, they were still fighting frantically for it even when they knew nothing about its content.

They knew very well its contents must be some important treasures. There was no doubt about it.

“Let me see what kind of treasure did the old man put in this Interspatial Ring.”

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang began to investigate the ring’s content.

Jian Wushuang found there were only three treasures in the Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and the three treasures appeared in the void before him.

It was a Silver Battle Armor, a baby-sized Black Beast Statue, and a dark gray jade slip.

Jian Wushuang first looked at the Silver Battle Armor.

It looked ordinary at first glance with a relatively dull color and not releasing much aura.

Copious messages flooded in as soon as Jian Wushuang sent out his soul power to examine the armor.

“Moire Battle Armor—a Holy Treasure!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes went wide.

“Holy treasure! It’s another Holy Treasure! In addition, a defensive armor-type!”

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

Saber Master’s Holy Treasure Battle Saber was extremely valuable.

It was a known fact that a Holy Treasure Offensive Divine Weapon was far less valuable than a defensive armor of the same level!

Among the few treasures that Old Gu gave, there was a Holy Treasure defensive armor? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

How much was the defensive armor’s value?

“If the Battle Saber was something ordinary Undying Saints would cherish, then this Moire Armor is probably good enough to cause ordinary Undying Saints to fight for it,” mumbled Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang knew that many weaker Undying Saints did not own a suitable Holy Treasure Offensive Divine Weapon with most still using Pinnacle Heavenly Treasures. Therefore, a suitable Holy Treasure Offensive Divine Weapon would trigger a fierce contest.

Indeed, the defensive armor was good enough to make ordinary Undying Saints go crazy for it.

“He’s very generous!”

Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

Although the Moire Battle Armor was good, it was also of little use to Jian Wushuang.

After all, he had his own life armor—the Golden Glass Armor.

Although the physical protective capability of the Golden Glass Armor was far inferior to the Moire Battle Armor, it was connected with Jian Wushuang’s lifeblood. In addition, it could continuously improve its power as Jian Wushuang’s strength improves.

In correlation to Jian Wushuang’s strength increase, the Golden Glass Armor had also been upgraded from Primary-level to High-level Heavenly Treasure. It was in actuality at the peak of a High-level Heavenly Treasure and only a thin line away from being a Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure.

The most important part of choosing a divine weapon or treasure was still compatibility toward its user after all.

It was sufficient for Jian Wushuang to have the Golden Glass Armor, hence we would not need the Moire Battle Armor.
