Chapter 344: Three-day Drunk

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At the contact place for Alchemy School.

In the courtyard, Jian Wushuang was practicing his sword arts while Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou sat quietly at a table on the side.

Though Su Rou had regained consciousness, she still looked pale and sad. Apparently, she hadn’t recovered from the heavy blow yet.

She had been so shocked by Ye Chen’s betrayal that it had even affected her physically, and she had yet to recover.

“Third Bro.” A voice was heard and Wang Yuan ran in.

Jian Wushuang stopped and looked over at Wang Yuan, “Any news?”

“Em.” Wang Yuan nodded, but he was hesitant and nervous as he said, “My father said the Alchemy School won’t step in.”

“What?” Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou were surprised.

This time, Holy Emperor Palace would definitely send one of their Holy Masters. If Alchemy School didn’t help them, how could they defend against them?

Jian Wushuang just raised his brows while listening to the news. There was no sorrow or happiness on his face.

“I don’t understand his decision either. I asked him repeatedly, but he only told me that it’s not because the Alchemy School fears Holy Emperor Palace. It’s because of some special circumstances. So...” Wang Yuan paused and reached out.

“Here are two elixirs, a Spirit-recovering Elixir and a Yin-Yang Dark Dragon Elixir.”

“Spirit-recovering Elixir, the highest level of healing elixir on the Nanyang Continent. Even inside the Alchemy School, no one can refine it. The elixir helps restore Spiritual Power and can quickly recover from a wound, which can be very useful in?your life is on the line.”

“Yin-Yang Dark Dragon Elixir. It can increase your strength for a short period of time, but it has a small side-effect.”

“My father asked me to give them to you, and he said it’s the only thing Alchemy School can do to help you.”

Looking at the elixirs in Wang Yuan’s hands, Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Whether it was the Spirit-recovering Elixir or the Yin-Yang Dark Dragon Elixir, he knew they were both top level elixirs.

Like magic weapons and manuals, elixirs were also classified into three levels. Spirit-recovering Elixirs were superior second grade.

Yin-Yang Dark Dragon Elixirs were at a slightly lower grade, medium second-grade.

On the Nanyang Continent, few alchemists could refine these elixirs.

Therefore, these two elixirs were valuable.

“Third Bro, I’m sorry.” Wang Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang with guilt.

“I’m not a disciple of Alchemy School and Alchemy School has its own concerns. So it’s normal. You have nothing to apologize for. What’s more, you have given me two elixirs, which helps me a lot.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and accepted the elixirs.

He was Wang Yuan’s brother, but he had little connection with the Alchemy School. He was grateful that the Alchemy School gave him a Spirit-recovering Elixir and a Yin-Yang Dark Dragon Elixir.

If he had a chance, he would return the favor.

“Don’t worry, I will be staying with you. If you die, I will die too. I don’t believe my father will still sit by idly,” Wang Yuan said in a deep voice.

“Don’t be silly,” Jian Wushuang said, then glanced at Wang Yuan.

“I’m staying as well.” Yang Zaixuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Third Bro.” Su Rou gave him a stern look.

They were like a family. So, of course, they would live or die together. None of them would abandon the others.

Jian Wushuang was greatly touched. He smiled and said, “Let’s not talk about it anymore. We haven’t been gathered together in a long time. Today, let’s have a good drink.”

“Okay.” Wang Yuan nodded heavily, “Today we must have a good drink.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They moved to a stone table and Jian Wushuang took out a pot of wine, pouring each one of them a drink.

“What’s this? It smells good.” Wang Yuan took a deep breath, smelling the aroma of wine and marveling at it.

“It does,” Yang Zaixuan said and nodded.

“It really was a hard-won wine. Cheers,” Jian Wushuang said, then raised his wine and smiled.

Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou also raised their glasses, then they guzzled them down. However, Jian Wushuang only put it under his nose without drinking it.

“Third Bro, why didn’t you drink yours?” After emptying his glass, Wang Yuan noticed Jian Wushuang’s glass was still full, so he frowned. But his face turned red and he quickly began to feel dizzy.

“The wine...” Wang Yuan’s voice became soft, then he fell on the stone table.

“Third Bro, you...” Yang Zaixuan felt dizzy and foggy. He shook his head fiercely, trying to stay awake, but he fell asleep as well.

Su Rou’s face was also red. She took a deep look at Jian Wushuang, then she fainted?too.

After that drink, everyone was drunk except for Jian Wushuang.

“I knew it.” An old figure walked slowly towards him.

“Senior Wine Master,” said Jian Wushuang, then he stood up and smiled.

“How was my ‘Three-day Drunk’?” Wine Master asked.

“It deserves its reputation. They all became drunk after only one drink,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course. It was made a thousand years ago by the best winemaker on the Nanyang Continent. One drink can even make me sleep for three days, let alone them.” Wine Master smiled slightly, then he looked seriously at Jian Wushuang, “Young man, you really want to confront Holy Emperor Palace by yourself?”

Yesterday, Jian Wushuang asked Wine Master for a pot of Three-day Drunk. Wine Master had realized what Jian Wushuang planned to do.

“What else can I do?” Jian Wushuang asked and smiled in an odd manner.

“I have no other choice but to face them because of the Blood Soul Mark. But these three... I understand how they are. If I didn’t do this, they would insist on going with me.”

“The resentment is between me and Holy Emperor Palace, so I’ll take care of it on my own. There’s no need to get them in trouble.”

Looking at them all, bent over the desk, Jian Wushuang was determined.

Even if it was a crisis for Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, or Su Rou, he would protect them, let alone his own problems.

“Be my brothers, we should share our joys, but bear the sorrows... only by me!”
