Chapter 3542: Killing Move

“This move!”

The moment Master Dragonhawk saw Jian Wushuang’s move, he could feel the extraordinary power contained in the move.

However, he was the first to make a move, and his power had been pushed to the limit. At this time, he could not avoid the fight at all. He could only brace himself and meet Jian Wushuang head-on. As a result, the collision…

Clang!

The hook in Master Dragonhawk’s hand was smashed and changed direction. It was almost thrown away, but the brilliant blood-red sword light was not affected at all. It continued to chop at Master Dragonhawk’s divine body.

Master Dragonhawk also had an elementary universe true treasure armor on his body. It immediately reduced the power by more than half, but the rest of the power was transferred to his body, causing him to be severely injured, almost 40% of his divine power was instantly destroyed.

Buzz!

Master Dragonhawk retreated rapidly. On the way, everyone could see that his aura had been greatly weakened.

“Blood Sword Master!”

After he stabilized himself, Master Dragonhawk revealed a look of shock and anger.

“Master Dragonhawk, I forgot to tell you that the battle between us today will determine the victor and the victor, as well as life and death,” Jian Wushuang said leisurely.

“Life and death?” Master Dragonhawk was stunned.

“Blood Sword Master is...going to kill Master Dragonhawk?” The surrounding Principles Masters were also astonished.

In the 50 years that Jian Wushuang had been wandering in the outskirts of Devil Smoke Valley, he had never killed anyone among the experts he had challenged. But today, he was going to kill Master Dragonhawk.

“Run!”

Master Dragon Eagle did not hesitate. He immediately fled when he saw that Jian Wushuang was going to kill him. He did not dare to stay any longer.

Jian Wushuang’s sword attack had scared him.

The power of that sword attack was so strong that it was no less than that of an ordinary expert of the six realms of the void. He had the armor of an elementary universe supreme treasure, but almost 40 percent of his divine power had been destroyed in an instant, if he were to receive a few more strikes, he would definitely die!

“Do you think you can escape?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. His space-time domain instantly covered Master Dragonhawk, and he disappeared into the void at once.

The space-time domain suppressed Master Dragonhawk, causing his speed to drop drastically.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, used his shadowless escape art, and his speed was extremely fast. He easily caught up with Master Dragonhawk.

“Master Dragonhawk, die!” Jian Wushuang shouted and slashed his Blood Mountain Sword at Master Dragonhawk.

“Why, Blood Sword Master, why do you want to kill me?” Master Dragonhawk roared crazily.

He did not understand why Jian Wushuang wanted to kill him when he had never killed anyone before.

He had never had any contact with Blood Sword Master before?

Was it because of Star Palace?

However, there was a certain conflict between his camp and the highest level of Star Palace. Most of the experts under Star Palace came from the surrounding star worlds, so they did not get involved in the conflict between Star Palace and the highest level of his camp, most of them did not get involved.

In that case, what was the reason?

“Master Dragonhawk, do you want to know why I want to kill you?” Jian Wushuang looked down at Master Dragonhawk with a cold gaze.

At this moment, Master Dragonhawk’s aura was extremely weak, and he had less than 10% of his divine power left. There was no chance for him to survive in Jian Wushuang’s hands. When he heard Jian Wushuang’s words, he immediately raised his head, he was eager for Jian Wushuang to give him an answer.

However, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and said, “You want to know the answer? Unfortunately, I won’t tell you.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wushuang attacked again. He cut off the head of Master Dragonhawk and killed him.

After the death of Master Dragonhawk, his supreme treasure armor, his long hook, and his interspatial ring naturally fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

After killing Master Dragonhawk easily, Jian Wushuang looked at the surrounding Principles Masters.

The Principles Masters were not as relaxed as before when they saw Jian Wushuang’s eyes. On the contrary, they were all vigilant.

They did not know whether Jian Wushuang was purely looking for trouble with Master Dragonhawk or whether he would continue to target them after killing him.

Jian Wushuang naturally saw through their thoughts and smiled, “Don’t worry, the person I’m looking for is only Master Dragonhawk. I want to kill him because of the Sacred Island behind him. I’ll kill anyone who comes from the Sacred Island. As for experts from other astral worlds or forces, I don’t have any enmity with them.”

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, the surrounding Principles Masters heaved a sigh of relief.

“Farewell, everyone.”

Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

Seeing Jian Wushuang leave, the Principles Masters were relieved.

“Fortunately, Blood Sword Master is friendly to us,” a Principles Master said.

“Blood Sword Master has always been friendly to us. As for Master Dragonhawk, it seems that Blood Sword Master killed him because of the Sacred Island behind him.”

“I just don’t know what grudge Blood Sword Master has with the Sacred Island.”

“The Sacred Island is just an insignificant small force in this universe territory. This force itself seems to be the overlord of the absolute beginning Star World, the three great sacred territories. However, the absolute beginning star world has something special compared to the other Star Worlds. Although the three great sacred territories are the overlords of the absolute beginning star world, they don’t have a ruler-level expert guarding them. Because there is no ruler-level expert guarding them, the Sacred Island doesn’t have much presence in this territory.”

“In addition, I heard that there are some grudges between the highest level of the Star Palace and the Sacred Island. It’s very likely that Blood Sword Master killed the people of the Sacred Island because of this.”

The Principles Masters all started to discuss.

Whether it was the Star Palace or the Sacred Island, they were both one of the powers in this universe. Even though the Sacred Island was weaker and had a lower sense of existence, these experts from the various astral worlds still knew about it, they also knew that there were some grudges between Sacred Island and the highest level of Star Palace, so they had all made guesses.

“No matter what grudges there are between Star Palace and Sacred Island, or between Blood Sword Master and Sacred Island, it has nothing to do with us. We can only not take the initiative to provoke this Blood Sword Master.”

“That’s true. However, Blood Sword Master’s power is indeed tyrannical. That Master Dragonhawk is, after all, a great being at the pinnacle of the fourth level of the void realm, and he has a universe true treasure armor to protect his body. Yet, he was easily killed by Blood Sword Master, and he didn’t even have the slightest chance of escaping.”

“Tsk, tsk, that’s true.”

These Principles Masters left one after another amidst the admiration.
