Chapter 4099: Mortal Enemy

“He’s dead?” Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly.

How terrifying and heaven-defying was it for an Ultimate Ruler to kill an Ruler directly?

It was a pity that such a super genius had died a long time ago.

“Young man, in terms of innate advantage and potential, you’re stronger than Jie Dong. My guess is that as long as you become an Ultimate Ruler, your strength will not be any weaker than Jie Dong’s. If you improve faster in the universe principles, your strength might be even stronger than Jie Dong’s!

!!

“In the future, if you can break through to become an Ruler, then you will truly soar. With your innate advantage, as long as you become an Ruler, you will definitely be a top-notch Ruler,” Heart Slayer said with a faint smile, but then he changed the topic. “However, because of your life level, you will have more potential enemies. The appearance of the Cosmos Temple is one of them. In the future, if you travel in the depths of the universe, you have to be careful. After all, the universe is dangerous. If you are not careful, you might directly die. By then, no matter how much talent and potential you have, it will be useless.”

Jian Wushuang nodded heavily. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He also knew that a genius was only a genius.

Before he really grew up, he just had more talent than others.

Only when he really grew up and reached the top level could he be qualified to be called a real expert.

But now, he was still far from being one of the top experts in the universe.

“By the way, Ruler Heart Slayer, even if Ruler wants to kill me, how could he find my location so accurately?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He had always been puzzled by this question.

Previously, he had been chased to this universe void, and the universe dark void was vast and boundless. It was too difficult to find a person here. That was why he had stayed here to recover his divine power.

However, he did not expect that Ruler would actually directly find him.

“Haha, this problem is actually very simple. That Ruler is not only a powerhouse of the Grand Cosmos Temple. Moreover, his status in the Grand Cosmos Temple is very high. If I’m not wrong, he should have a unique treasure bestowed by the Grand Cosmos Temple that can sense special life forms. This unique treasure can have a certain sense of those special life forms. Moreover, the higher the level of the life form, the stronger the sense will be.” Ruler Heart Slayer smiled.

“I guess Ruler didn’t know about your existence before, but when he arrived in this Star Field, the treasure on his body sensed you, which attracted his attention. Then he followed the direction of the treasure and found your location.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

A treasure that could sense the existence of special life forms?

Jian Wushuang could understand this kind of sensing ability.

After all, the universe was vast and there were countless kinds of life forms. In addition to the birth of countless experts, they had created all kinds of treasures. It was normal for some treasures to have special senses toward certain things.

Not to mention treasures, even life forms also had these special senses.

Devil Flame, for example, was from the gold-devouring clan. He was born with a strong sense for all kinds of special crystals. The higher the level of the special crystals, the stronger his sense would be.

“If the experts of the Cosmos Temple all have these special treasures, won’t it be dangerous for me to travel in the universe in the future?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He was now in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy and not in the depths of the universe. He had met an expert of the Cosmos Temple, a Supreme-being, and almost died.

But if he went to the depths of the universe in the future, there would be experts everywhere, and there would be many experts from the Cosmos Temple. If all the experts of the Cosmos Temple had these treasures, which could sense special life forms, wouldn’t that mean that powerful beings would come looking for him at any time? This time, it would be a Supreme-being. However, in the depths of the universe, it was possible that a group of Supreme-beings or even top-tier Supreme-beings would make a move.

Even Ruler Heart Slayer had said that killing a perfect life-form was a very generous reward from the Cosmos Temple. It was enough to tempt any Supreme-being. It was reasonable for a top-tier Supreme-being to kill him for the reward from the Cosmos Temple.

“Kid, you don’t have to worry too much. The Cosmos Temple is very powerful, and they do have many experts under their command. Their power extends to every corner of the universe. However, the experts of the Cosmos Temple aren’t able to kill those special lifeforms without fear. They also have many restrictions,” Ruler Heart Slayer explained with a smile.

“First of all, those special life-forms have enormous innate advantages. Anyone who grows up and dares to venture into the depths of the universe is quite powerful. Many special life-forms, in particular, have even more heaven-defying life-saving methods. Even if an Ruler were to personally attack them, they wouldn’t be absolutely confident in being able to kill them.

“Secondly, those special life-forms aren’t stupid. They know that they are weak on their own, which is why when they venture into the depths of the universe, they often find a good backer. For example, if they join a top-tier power or become a subordinate of an expert, the experts under the command of the Grand Cosmos Temple wouldn’t dare to provoke them.

“After all, the Cosmos Temple is just a loose alliance. They can’t completely gather their power together. The experts under the Cosmos Temple don’t dare to rashly provoke the major powers in the depths of the universe. Take Ruler Blackhawk, for example, for example. He came here today to kill you.

“It’s true that Ruler is a Supreme. He dared to kill you because you’re a solitary expert with no background. The only thing he has is a status on the Nine Emperor List. However, he’s only a friend of the Nine Emperor Pavilion. After all, he’s not a core expert on the Nine Emperor List. However, if you’re determined to join the Nine Emperor Pavilion and become a core expert under the Nine Emperor Pavilion, I can guarantee that Ruler won’t dare to kill you.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was quite shocked.

“Yes, the experts under the Cosmos Temple are all individuals. They don’t dare to provoke the big forces in the depths of the universe.” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

“In addition to these two points, the most important point is that the special life forms also know how to work together. In the depths of the universe, there is an extremely powerful top force, the Life Palace!” Heart Slayer’s voice suddenly became solemn.

“The Life Palace can accommodate all the special lifeforms in the universe. It is the home of all the special lifeforms in the vast universe, and the Life Palace and the Cosmos Temple are arch-enemies. They have been fighting nonstop for countless years!”
