Chapter 1353: Sending a message

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“It takes longer and brings more risks?” Jian Wushuang frowned, “It seems like it will be impossible for me to go to the Purple Moon Sanctuary.”

King of Venomous Worms smiled, “Don’t be upset. You are unable to go alone there, but you could turn to talents from the Lineage of Star for help and ask them to take you there.”

“Ask them for help?”

“Exactly. Don’t forget that you are not only a disciple of the Lineage of Star but also enjoy a high status as you belong to Star Palace. Send them a message and they will take you there.” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Now that we are in the East Royal Sanctuary, it will be much easier for us to go to the Purple Moon Sanctuary. As far as I know, there is a famous community called Vientiane Tower.” King of Venomous Worms said.

He continued, “Any resources are available in the Vientiane Tower. And it’s power stretches to any corner of the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. There are all kinds of businesses in the tower: intelligence vendors, traders of treasures and even killers for hire. As long as you pay, you can do anything there.”

“So it’s easy for you to ask about sending a message.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and asked, “Do they dare to kill talents?”

“Of course, talents there fear nothing. Once someone payed a high price for the service of killing a top genius from one of the top-three tribes in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, which was even more powerful than the Lineage of Star.”

“So talents from Vientiane Tower accepted the request and killed that top genius. The tribe leader was furious but he couldn’t do anything.”

Jian Wushuang felt amazed by the power of the Vientiane Tower.

The Vientiane Tower was far above the standard fare.

“So, let’s go to the Vientiane Tower.”

He entered a nearby town.

There was a Vientiane Tower there.

“Is that the Vientiane Tower?”

In front of Jian Wushuang was a towering purple castle with, decorated with a pattern of a large, exotic beast, with its mouth wide open, as if it wanted to swallow everything in the heavens.

Jian Wushuang entered into the Vientiane Tower.

There were many cultivators there, each of whom was followed by a waiter in a black robe.

“What a place full of talents.” Jian Wushuang was excited.

Those talents, as well as their waiters, were all Universe Gods.

“Even the waiters are Universe Gods. Universe Gods are really ordinary.” Jian Wushuang murmured.

After all, the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries is the center of the Eternal Chaotic World, and the heaven of countless cultivators. A super powerful Universe God in an ordinary universe is just another nobody here.”

After pausing for a while, King of Venomous Worms continued, “Many talents are far more powerful than you and they are able to kill you easily. Don’t bring trouble to yourself here.”

Jian Wushaung nodded.

At that moment, a deacon in a black robe came to Jian Wushuang. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

She was a beautiful lady, who said smilingly, “How can I help you?”

“I want to send a message.”

“To whom?” The lady asked.

“Purple Moon Sanctuary of the Lineage of Star.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Aha…Cross Sanctuaries? OK, follow me.”

The lady took Jian Wushuang into a secret room.

“Sir, please write the message into the token and we will send it out. Two million Chaotic Crystals.”

“So expensive…” Jian Wushuang thought.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, an ordinary Universe God in the First Heaven was around fifty thousand Chaotic Crystals. The price of a message almost equalled that of a peak Universe God in the Second Heaven.

But Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate to pay.

He had accumulated many Chaotic Crystals along the way in the past one thousand years. But after he paid for the message, he now had only a few left.

“Within three days, we will inform you of the response from the other side.” The lady said.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang said before going to wait patiently in the secret room.

The Vientiane Tower was indeed efficient. One day later, the message was sent to a top talent from the Lineage of Star.

Now in the Purple Moon Sanctuary.

At the center of a star river, which was long and wide, full of stars, was located the Lineage of Star.

An elderly in a white robe entered into a huge palace made of special crystals.

“Master.”

The elderly bowed to a man in a crystal bed.

“What’s the matter?”

The man asked, sitting still.

The Elderly said, “There is a message from the Vientiane Tower. In the message, a Universe God said he belonged to the Star Palace of the Lineage of Star and now he is in the East Royal Sanctuary. He asked us to bring him here.”
