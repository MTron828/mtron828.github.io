Chapter 5255: The Limits of the Physical Body

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“l do not know when I will be able to meet you and demonstrate the knowledge I have gained. I want you to know that I have been moving forward all these years, never stopping, following the teachings!’

Reflecting on his lifelong journey, it all started because of Xuan Yi, his mentor. Although he was aware that Xuan Yi had plans and reasons for staying hidden all these years, the deep respect in his heart never wavered.

Once again lifting his head, Jian Wushuang suppressed his emotions.

“Go on, young one. After you gather all these origin sources, you can come find me. This old man still has some insights on the Dao of forging,” said the old man with goat horns, putting away the precious treasures and disappearing within the grand hall.

Jian Wushuang flashed away, leaving the grand hall, only to bump into Wan Xing, who had also been teleported out.

They met without exchanging many words, just nodding slightly in acknowledgment.

His ranking indeed surprised Wan Xing!

It seemed there was another formidable opponent. Wan Xing sighed inwardly. However, with his imitation Eternal Treasures and his mastery of skills, he was confident.

Hmm!

Among the half-step Emperors, he was standing at the peak.

They passed each other, Jian Wushuang heading to the adjacent treasure hall, and Wan Xing leaving the City Lord’s Mansion.

Thunk!

Stepping into the Treasure Hall, a familiar figure and a warm smile greeted his eyes.

“Haha, young man, you’re a bit late this time. That spatial treasure has already been exchanged by someone else,” Qiuhuang laughed heartily.

He seemed eager to see Jian Wushuang regretful, but he was disappointed. Jian Wushuang just sighed lightly and didn’t seem to care too much.

“Huh? You don’t seem to care at all!” Qiuhuang said, puzzled.

But Jian Wushuang just smiled and replied, “Enlightenment cannot be forced. If I can’t obtain it, it’s simply not meant to be.”

That treasure didn’t hold much attraction for him at the moment; it wasn’t a big loss.

Even if it did, he planned to exchange it for the four heaven-earth origin sources first.

He had already touched the threshold of the spatial origin source. Further improvements wouldn’t make much difference. Once he gained recognition from the spatial origin source, he would be able to travel through space freely.

There wasn’t much room for improvement now; the trials were getting fiercer. What he needed was a qualitative change in his strength, allowing him to become stronger with each battle. For every slight increase in his strength, he would receive substantial rewards.

Such opportunities were rare; he had to cherish them.

Qiuhuang squinted his eyes and nodded slightly. He spoke with an instructive tone, “Well done. Your firm conviction is indeed extraordinary. At least, old man that I am, I don’t think you’re lying.”

“One is one, and two is two. There’s no need for the younger generation to deceive the elders.’

“Alright, what do you want to exchange this time? You have quite a few treasure points on you. Let this old man give you some advice again.” Qiuhuang rubbed his hands together, sounding somewhat excited.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t quite fathom why this old man was so keen on recommending treasures to people. Did he get a commission for every sale, perhaps?

However, recalling the last time he got tricked, he had a sudden idea. He put on a devout expression, pretending to be sincere, allowing Qiuhuang to recommend treasures to him thoroughly.

Seated on the throne, Qiuhuang waved his hand, revealing all his possessions, and began to point out various treasures, describing each one in extravagant detail. Jian Wushuang remained silent, nodding along, indicating his approval.

Eventually, Qiuhuang presented treasures worth nearly 500,000 treasure points. He elaborated on the intricate relationships between them, emphasizing their significant impact on Jian Wushuang’s future.

Among them were numerous treasures that would prove immensely useful to Jian Wushuang in the future. Particularly, there were treasures designed for perfecting the physical body.

The challenges of the Dao weren’t limited to testing one’s mastery of the origin source Dao; they also extended to testing one’s divine body.

Jian Wushuang didn’t dwell on these matters too much.

The strength of one’s physical body could significantly enhance the likelihood of successfully mastering the Dao, especially when cultivated to an Immortal state. Even if the body was torn apart, it could regenerate effortlessly. It could endure countless ages, remaining unchanged even after a fall.

Jian Wushuang acknowledged the importance of this aspect.

Following Qiuhuangs plan, the physical body was also graded. First, it had to be cultivated to perfection. Then, it could be categorized as upper, middle, or lower-grade physique, or even a special supreme-grade demon god physique.

Although Qiuhuang boasted about it, Jian Wushuang remained unmoved. He decided to postpone discussions on these matters until after he finished inspecting the other grand halls.

His knowledge of physical cultivation was limited. He only knew that MO Long had achieved perfection, an extraordinary strength that allowed him to withstand the backlash from the Blood Jade Palace, an Innate Treasure set. That backlash was immensely powerful. Most Grand Yan Immortals would have perished, but MO Long endured it.

That was a set of Innate Treasures!

The power of the backlash was exceptionally formidable. Ordinary Grand Yan Immortals would have fallen, but he stood his ground.

The strength of the physical body was related to the divine body. At that time, MO Long possessed the Eye of the Candle Dragon, and with the enhancement from the divine body and the perfection of his physical body, he attained such immense physical power.

Jian Wushuang understood that Qiuhuang was being cryptic. He took the initiative to inquire, “Senior, you mentioned that it takes a thousand-fold enhancement of the divine body to achieve a top-grade physical body. For a top-grade body, how much enhancement and how many times is needed?”

Qiuhuang squinted his eyes, a longing expression on his face. “To be honest, back in my days, I only achieved a top-grade physical body. Many powerful cultivators only reach that level. To have a physical body comparable to a

Innate Treasure is already remarkable. However, there are those unparalleled Grand Yan Immortals who, in pursuit of perfection, elevated their bodies to the supreme-grade level. It’s hard to quantify the treasures needed. Just

passing the hurdle of the divine body alone deterred countless Grand Yan

Immortals.’

“Those truly capable of condensing their physical bodies to the supreme-grade level need treasures enhanced by 10,000 times. Without 10,000-fold enhanced treasures, no matter how many resources are poured in, it won’t work.’

“The utmost limit of the physical body ends here. After becoming an Emperor, one can have avatars outside the body. There’s no way to further enhance it unless through reconstruction!” Qiuhuang added cautiously, refraining from sounding overly confident. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He still had some distance from the peak of the universe. Although he was a bit ahead of other Emperors, it was only by a small margin.

“10,000-fold!” Jian Wushuangs initial interest waned instantly. However, his expression subtly changed at the mention of reconstruction.

An Emperor could reconstruct their physical body?

It was the first time he heard of it, but the concept was too remote for him to dwell on it further.

“Well, do you still have the confidence to cultivate?” Qiuhuang deliberately taunted.

Jian Wushuangs expression regained its calmness. He replied calmly, “This junior’s divine body is not even 2,000 times enhanced. The gap is too significant.”

“Haha, I told you, this supreme-grade physical body isn’t something an ordinary person can cultivate. It’s reserved for those monstrous geniuses!”

Monstrous geniuses!

Jian Wushuang wanted to retort, “Am I not monstrous enough?”

He was already this formidable as a Nine Revolutions. The crucial point was that his room for improvement was exceptionally vast, especially his origin source. It had already grown immensely, but there was still tremendous room for enhancement.

One should know that many Grand Yan Immortals had already elevated their origin source Dao to the ninth layer, and some even had almost perfected their origin source Dao, reaching peak-level power.

Alternatively, there were second-grade special origin source Dao. Once perfected, they had the power of a Dao Lord..
