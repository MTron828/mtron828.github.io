Chapter 5350: I Bet Five Million

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang was engaged in conversation with some nobles, but his brow furrowed slightly after his true self succeeded in its endeavor. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“By the way, aren’t you guys interested in playing a bit?” Xia Mang Guanyu pointed to the massive plaque outside with words displaying today’s beast arena duel.

Above it was the display of today’s battle in the Beastfight Arena.

Jian Qijin vs Huangpu Xiongyi.

One was a Sword Principle expert, and the other was a divine body expert.

The life-and-death battle between these two people attracted quite a number of people to come and watch.

The other nobles waved their hands, and a young woman quickly appeared in front of them.

“l bet Huangpu Xiongyi, 50,000 godstones!”

Despite saying it was just for fun, these people were quite extravagant in their bets.

“If you bet on Huangpu Xiongyi, then I’ll bet on Jian Qijin. I practice swordsmanship too—Annihilation Sword Technique!’

They bantered and laughed, but the scene on the stage was about to turn into a bloodbath.

Jian Wushuang observed it all, calmly stating, “1 bet on Jian Qijin, two million godstones, plus this innate top-grade divine sword!”

Crash!

Other than a sack containing godstones, there was also a bone-crushing divine sword, entirely white and exuding a profound aura.

It was a treasure forged by a god who had subdued an Emperor-level savage beast for him.

This sword was currently his most handy divine weapon.

The crucial point was that this supreme divine sword was quite valuable.

“A top-grade divine weapon!’

“Two million?”

“Are you insane?”

The one speaking was his cousin, Xuanyuan Jingxuan, his uncle’s son. Their relationship was quite good, so he came forward to try and offer advice.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and spoke, “I’m ready to go to the battlefield. These are just external possessions, keeping them serves no purpose, Today,

I’ll bring them out to amuse everyone!”

He spoke with great care, accompanied by a sense of world-weariness, earning admiration from the onlookers.

To the battlefield!

Xuanyuan Jingxuan tilted his head and whispered to Xia Mang Guanyu, “To the battlefield? Are you sure?”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

In the eyes of these people, Xia Mang Guanyu was not someone accustomed to the battlefield and combat.

“Go to that battlefield. My father is currently at the Southern Region battlefield. If you want, I can take you to find him!” Xuanyuan Jingxuan suggested quietly.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and patted the other’s shoulder, saying, “Your father will be back soon!”

“Ninth Prince, this White Bone Sword can be used as collateral for three million godstones!” The person who spoke was Pei San, and he handed a golden token to Jian Wushuang, with five characters inscribed on top.

Taking the token and playing with it, Jian Wushuang addressed the shocked young aristocrats, “Five characters won’t do; it’s too ominous. Add another million!”

Saying this, he threw a sack to Pei San, remarking, “The things inside should be enough!’

Pei San glanced inside and found it was indeed sufficient, at least 30,000 to 50,000 godstones short. However, he couldn’t bring himself to ask for more just because of this, so he reluctantly exchanged the token for Jian Wushuang.

“Good! Six characters sound better.’

It was a total of six million.

If he lost, it would be as if he hadn’t heard any noise. However, if he won, based on the one-to-three odds, he would gain 18 million godstones.

Adding two million godstones and a top-grade divine sword pressed down, he now had the qualification to go to that auction house.

The auction house was a super force, and this time, the top-tier auction held in Great Xia would be presided over by a tier 6 Emperor.

It wasn’t a place ordinary people could enter.

The ticket was not about status but godstones on one’s person; with a base of 20 million, one couldn’t even enter.

Moreover, many treasures auctioned this time were special treasures exclusively used by the Heavenly Realm.

Even some tier 6 old monsters would come.

His identity as the Prince of Great Xia was simply not enough to be considered, and even if the Lord Emperor of Great Xia went, he wouldn’t be considered a significant figure.

Unless the ancestral figure of Great Xia went.

Every tier 6 Emperor had a supreme prestige.

Only tier 6 Emperors would be honored guests there.

Inside the secret chamber.

Jian Wushuang, who had transformed into Jian Qijin, walked out slowly.

In about 15 minutes, he had flipped through the memories of Jian Qijin Jin in detail.

“Huangpu Xiongyi, a divine body expert with a divine body that is 16,700 times stronger!’

To be honest, it was very weak.

Bai Junwang was once a divine body flow cultivator, with over 60,000 times the strength, which was a true powerhouse.

If they really fought, Jian Wushuang could finish his opponent in 15 minutes.

However, in order not to let others notice the changes in Jian Qijin, he was still prepared to act a little more realistically and use the origin source to exhaust the other party to death.

This would only make people say that the divine body flow was weak, highlighting the strength of the origin source.

But seeing so many people pressuring Huangpu Xiongyi, Jian Wushuangs strength didn’t seem to be up to par.

Even though he was at the peak of tier 3, he was probably not even as strong as a tier 2 Emperor in the outside world.

Much weaker than the tier 3 Emperors in the Heavenly Realm.

It seemed that within this imperial city, there were some seemingly powerful individuals.

Feeling the sack in his hand, Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised. Apart from a divine sword, there was nothing else, not even a godstone.

The other sack was the same, but with an additional token.

A golden token with a conspicuous 12 on top!

It turned out to be wagered with 12 million godstones.

Jian Wushuang was not swayed by the godstones; he was not seen winning in Jian Qijin’s memory!

How could this be!

Both Bai Junwang and Jian Wushuang were like a single organism, so Bai Junwang naturally also saw it.

“There’s nothing strange. His memories should have been processed in some treasure. It’s normal that you can’t see it clearly!” Bai Junwang reminded.

Jian Wushuang became even more puzzled.

A tier 3 Emperor with a net worth of a million was already considered pretty good. How could he have 12 million?

Could it be that there was something hidden?

Investigate!

He had to investigate. Amassing 12 million was not an ordinary feat.

There was probably a tier 4 Emperor behind him helping.

But why was he so confident? Was he sure that he would win?

The Beastfight Arena had tier 4 Emperors who would personally test the strength of the two.

Finally, they gave out the odds.

Could it be?

Jian Wushuang thought of something; there must be someone manipulating behind the scenes.

He could have clones, and so could others.

However, it would be difficult to fool a tier 5 Emperor.

“Old Ghost Bai, inform Xuanyuan Dapan and let him personally investigate the origin of this Jian Qijin!’

Regardless of whether they could find out, he would make a killing this time!

After winning, just the Jian Qijin alone would yield 36 million godstones.

Combined with Xia Mang Guanyu’s share, it would surpass 50 million.

An ordinary tier 4 Emperor was probably only worth this much!

Of course, that was only the poorest; the gap between tier 4 and tier 3 Emperors was significant.

Some secret realms or relics had special requirements, whereby only tier 4 Emperors could enter. In those kinds of places, even with the worst luck, they could still gain several million godstones..
