4657 Meeting Cosmos God Again

When the Emerald green power was offset, the lady in green was extremely shocked.

“Who are you?” After taking a deep breath, the lady in green transformed into a pair of green wings and flew to Jian Wushuang’s side.

“A passerby.” Jian Wushuang was concise and comprehensive. It was obvious that he did not want to get entangled with her.

Obviously, the woman in green did not realize this. She immediately sat on Ah Zi’s back.

The curiosity in her eyes grew as she looked at Jian Wushuang, “A passerby? I’ve never seen anyone use the kind of energy you just used. It’s really mysterious!”

Ignoring her words, Jian Wushuang looked at the same chain and token on her neck that was exactly the same as Ah Zi. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Sensing Jian Wushuang’s gaze, the lady in green hurriedly hugged herself and said, “You’re despicable!”

His face was full of black lines, but he could only say patiently, “I’m looking at that iron plate!”

The green-robed woman smiled awkwardly and then grabbed the metal plate on her neck. “You’re talking about this? It’s the plate used to bind and record the number. It’s all thanks to that bastard!”

Without saying anything else, Jian Wushuang pulled out the Tarot Divine Sword, picked up the iron token, and easily cut off the iron chain.

The green-robed lady’s eyes widened in disbelief as she looked at the metal medallion that had been broken into two. “H-how is this possible? Even I can’t break this metal plate…”

“Just because you can’t do it doesn’t mean others can’t. Alright, you can leave now. I’m ready to leave too,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“My name is Qingluan.” The lady in green nodded. “Thank you for saving me. I will definitely repay you in the future.”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “Let’s not talk about that. Let me ask you, do you know any way to leave this universe?”

“So there really are other universes apart from this one,” the woman named Qing Luan said in surprise.

Jian Wushuang was speechless. “Do you have any way to leave? I’ve been here long enough.”

Qingluan stopped talking, as if she had made a decision. Finally, she nodded and said, “I can, but with my ability, I can only tear a gap at most.”

Jian Wushuang did not have any hope. He immediately nodded and said, “That’s enough, that’s enough!”

Qiangluan nodded. “Then, take me to the place where you first came from.”

Unable to contain his excitement, Jian Wushuang immediately led Qingluan and directed Ah Zi to gallop back to the place where he first came from.

Jian Wushuang was eager to return to the Divine Power Universe. 600,000 years was probably enough to wipe out the memories of most people.

All he could do was seize the slightest opportunity and return to the Divine Power Universe.

More than ten years later, the two humans and one beast arrived at their original location.

Looking at the crater that had become a huge lake, Jian Wushuang sighed with emotion. Who would have thought that he had come to an unknown universe and lay there for 600,000 years?

“Did you first enter from here?” Qingluan asked. At the same time, wisps of strange green energy surged around her body.

Jian Wushuang nodded and pointed at a direction with great precision.

“To be honest, I’m afraid you’ll be the first and last person to break into the Great Yan Domain on your own. I can’t imagine it. Qing Yuan shrugged. anyway, I wish you good luck.

‘Great Yan Domain? It sounds a little weird,’ Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The next moment, Qingluan let out a long cry and her entire body turned into a sky-covering green bird that soared into the sky.

She pecked at the void with her emerald-green beak, and ripples appeared in the void.

Then, a crack the size of a needle appeared. The Qingluan tore it apart with all her might, and the crack immediately expanded to an inch long.

“Now!” Qingluan cried.

Jian Wushuang patted Ah Zi’s big head and then leaped toward the crack.

The violent aura of the space-time turbulence emerged again. Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and cupped his hands at Qingluan. “Thank you for your help. We don’t owe each other anything now.”

Qingluan, who had returned to her human form, smiled faintly. “Alright, we don’t owe each other anything.”

“If you can, send Ah Zi to a more desolate place. Don’t let it be caught again,” Jian Wushuang added, and then strode into the space-time turbulence.

“Wait a moment!” Qingluan suddenly called out to him, “Will we meet again in the future?”

“I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to meet again.” After taking one last look at Qingluan, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and disappeared into the space-time turbulence.

Looking at the sealed space-time crack, Qing Yuan stood there in a daze. She only left after a long time.

This ancient and desolate savage land had returned to peace. If it was not for the fact that a young Ranger had accidentally entered this place for 600,000 years, it would probably have remained silent.

As soon as Jian Wushuang stepped into the space-time turbulence, the turbulent astral wind that could even cut the divine soul attacked him again.

To Jian Wushuang’s surprise, although the chaotic astral wind was as terrifying as before, it did not hurt him as much as before.

This change made him extremely excited. At least, he did not have to worry about dying in this space-time turbulence all of a sudden.

As he watched the tiny light spot behind him disappear, Jian Wushuang leaped into the turbulence and searched for the aura of the Divine Power Universe carefully.

As he continued to search, a faint and familiar aura came from an unknown direction. It was like a coordinate that guided Jian Wushuang forward.

It was that aura that allowed Jian Wushuang to change his route and move forward with difficulty in the space-time turbulence.

It was unknown how many years they had been traveling in the turbulent flow, but that incomparably intimate aura had also become more and more intense.

When Jian Wushuang suddenly crossed a turbulence, a figure sitting in space-time appeared in front of him.

“C-Cosmic God!” Jian Wushuang was completely shocked. Looking at the figure sitting there, he could not think.

Cosmic God, who had sealed Void God in the space-time turbulence with his own body slowly opened his eyes.

It was as though a trillion years had passed. Cosmos God smiled, “Little Friend Wushuang, we meet again.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned red and he charged at Cosmos God.

In his eyes, that kind elder had already gone through too much.

“Little Friend, get up quickly. This old man can’t endure this bow of yours.” Cosmos God helped Jian Wushuang up and smiled. “You’re already the master of the rules of the heaven and earth. I can’t be worthy of your bow anymore.”

“A teacher for a day, a teacher for life. It is also a rule for a disciple to bow to a teacher,” Jian Wushuang said. He knelt on one knee and bowed solemnly to Cosmos God.
