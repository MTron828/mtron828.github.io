4333 Meeting Again

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu looked at everyone’s puzzled eyes and slowly said, “Ever since the palace Master of the Divine Life Palace was established, our disciples can die in battle, but when has there ever been a need to execute our own disciples in order to protect the Divine Palace?

“If we execute Jian Wushuang today, should we encounter such a thing again in the future, are we going to execute other disciples to please other forces and protect the Divine Palace?”

As soon as he said this, everyone was stunned.

“Lord Gai Fu, you’re right. If it wasn’t for the fact that we had no other choice, who would want to see Jian Wushuang die?”

!!

Ruler Clear Reed raised her head and looked at Ruler Gai Fu.

At the same time, he sighed in his heart. Since none of them wanted to be the bad guy, then he would be the bad guy!

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu glanced at him and said, “When did I say that there’s no way?”

After saying that, Supreme Master Gai Fu turned to look at Jian Wushuang and said in a deep voice, “Jian Wushuang, listen up. From today on, you are no longer a disciple of the Divine Life Palace!”

“I strip you of your status as a disciple of the Divine Life Palace. You are to leave the Divine Life Palace by today! Don’t stay!”

“You, do you understand?”

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu’s last sentence was spoken with a bit of power, and it was like the sound of a yellow bell ringing, deafening the deaf!

Everyone was shocked by his words!

“Supreme Ruler Gai Fu, I…”

Jian Wushuang was stunned and was about to speak.

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu’s face darkened as he berated, “Don’t you understand what I’m saying? From now on, you are no longer a disciple of the Divine Life Palace. Leave now!”

Looking at Supreme Master Gai Fu’s cold expression, Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled and a warm feeling welled up in his heart.

He wasn’t a fool. He knew what Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu meant.

However, would the dragon clan really let the Divine Life Palace go so easily if he left?

“Get out!”

Supreme Master Gai Fu flicked his sleeve and a gentle but powerful force blasted out, sending Jian Wushuang flying out of the Supreme shrine.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang fell hard on the ground outside the Supreme shrine. He struggled to stand up and looked at the Supreme shrine. He clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his flesh.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, turned around, and headed toward the sixth mountain range.

…

Within the Ruler temple.

After Jian Wushuang left, the hall became silent.

No one said anything, except for the Ruler Blood Wave, who was smiling in his heart.

It’s good to leave, good to leave…

“Supreme Master Gai Fu, Jian Wushuang has left…then what should we do?”

Supreme Clear Reed took a deep breath and said in a deep voice.

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu’s originally stern expression had already eased up. He glanced at Supreme martial artist clear Reed indifferently and said calmly,

Qinghan, it seems like you’ve lost your courage after so many years of rest. That’s why you’re so scared when you hear the word ‘dragon clan’.

“Supreme Ruler Gai Fu, I…”

Upon hearing this, Supreme Clear Reed’s expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to speak, he saw Supreme Gai Fu wave his hand.

“Alright, you don’t have to say anymore.”

“The dragon clan is strong, but so what? Now that Jian Wushuang is no longer a disciple of the Divine Life Palace and he has been expelled, if the dragon clan wants to find trouble with him, they can go to the universe to find him. What does it have to do with the Divine Life Palace?”

“Besides…”

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

A sharp intent surged up on that old, mottled face.

“When the palace Master disappeared back then, did you really think that the palace Master didn’t have a few tricks up his sleeve?”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone present was shocked.

Everyone stopped talking.

…

In the manor where Jian Wushuang was in the sixth mountain range.

Jian Wushuang stepped into the room with heavy steps.

“Husband, are you alright?”

Leng Rushuang seemed to have heard the news as well. Seeing Jian Wushuang walk in, she stood up and asked anxiously.

“I’m fine,” she said.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, took a deep breath and said, “Shuang ‘er, pack up your things. We’re leaving this place.”

“Alright,” he said.

Leng Rushuang did not ask why he was in a hurry to leave. She had always been like this. As long as Jian Wushuang had made a decision, she would not ask or say much.

After a while, Jian Wushuang put Leng Rushuang into The Investiture of the Gods and was ready to leave.

Jian Wushuang turned around and took a look at the gate of the Divine Life Palace.

In the Divine Life Palace, many disciples looked at him with complicated expressions. Their emotions were difficult to understand.

...

“I will definitely come back, definitely!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and a flash of determination appeared in them!

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to leave, a flowing light suddenly shot toward him.

As the light fell, the figure of the Ruler Blood Wave was revealed.

He was here to send them off.

“Ruler Blood Wave, in the Great Hall today…”

Jian Wushuang cupped his hands at him.

Without waiting for Jian Wushuang to finish, the Blood Wave Master waved his hand and said with a smile, “There’s no need for all this between us.”

After a pause, the Blood Wave Supreme continued, “Jian Wushuang, I’m afraid the road ahead will be dangerous. You must be extremely careful. It’s best to change your appearance and keep a low profile.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and replied, “I understand.”

The Ruler Blood Wave grunted in acknowledgment and took out a Scarlet Jade token with a flip of his right hand. “Jian Wushuang, this Jade token contains the power of my three attacks. Keep it carefully. If…if you really encounter a life-and-death crisis, the power of three strikes in this Jade token should be able to save your life.”

...

Jian Wushuang was not a pretentious person. He accepted the Jade token and nodded at the Blood Wave Supreme.

There was no need to say any words of gratitude. They were all in his heart.

The Ruler Blood Wave smiled and continued, “You must take care of yourself. By the way, Supreme Master Gai Fu asked me to pass you a message. No matter what, you, Jian Wushuang, will always be a disciple of the Divine Life Palace!”

After a pause, the Blood Wave Supreme laughed. the Ninth Kalpa King also asked me to tell you not to die. He’s waiting for you at the Great Clan Gathering. He also wants to try what it’s like to slay a Dragon.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was touched and filled with pride. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Don’t worry, Ruler Blood Wave. I won’t die!”

“Good! We’ll meet again in the future.”

The Blood Wave Supreme patted Jian Wushuang’s shoulder and bade him farewell.

“I’ll be leaving then. You take care, Supreme Blood Wave.”

Jian Wushuang strode away. He took Leng Rushuang with him and turned into a stream of flowing light, shooting toward the vast starry sky far away.

Today, he would leave without asking about the time limit or the way back.

He would once again face the sea of stars alone.

In the distance, the Divine Life Palace had already turned into a small black dot, which was thousands of miles away.

Jian Wushuang turned his head and looked deeply at the Divine Life Palace and the Blood Wave Supreme. Then, he spoke in a voice that only he could hear.

“We meet again.”
