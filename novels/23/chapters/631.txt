Chapter 632: Barely

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

All these experts had very sharp eyes, so they could tell that the reason Jian Wushuang was able to fight against the Puppet Fighter for so long was that his Sword Soul Power was very strong. A Sword Soul’s strength was determined by the user’s talent in Sword Principle.

The stronger the Sword Soul was, the more gifted they were in Sword Principle.

Therefore, they thought Jian Wushuang had a ‘good’ talent for Sword Principle.

However, they didn’t know that this wasn’t the peak of Jian Wushuang’s Sword Soul Power at all and that he was merely using a portion of his Sword Soul Power.

“Emperor Xiao told me that my Sword Soul is the Strongest Sword Soul he has ever seen and that it is unusual. So he asked me not to expose my Strongest Sword Soul in the Firmament Territory Feast. Because of that, I can only use a portion of my Sword Soul Power and?I have to purposely hide my Sword Soul Phantom so that no one will know I have awakened the Strongest Sword Soul,”?Jian Wushuang thought as he fought with the Puppet Fighter.

Emperor Xiao warned him about many things before Jian Wushuang left to attend the Firmament Territory Feast.

Because his flawless foundation and Sword Soul were very significant, Emperor Xiao reminded him not to expose them easily.

As for his other abilities, there was no harm in exposing them.

Therefore, when Jian Wushuang engaged in close combat with the Puppet Fighter, the physical strength from his foundation and the advantage from his bursts of Spiritual Power had not been completely put on display.

He had hidden most of his Sword Soul Power.

But, even so, the experts from the sects still thought that Jian Wushuang was quite gifted in Sword Principle.

15 minutes quickly passed.

Jian Wushuang exited the battlefield.

As he exited, he noticed that many of the surrounding geniuses were staring at him with very strange expressions.

“This boy... He has already reached his limit.”

“Yeah. It was clear that he was about to lose and that as long as the Puppet Fighter made another move, it might have defeated him and sent him out, but the 15 minutes ended just in the nick of time.”

“He’s a lucky dog.”

These geniuses could tell that even though Jian Wushuang passed the second round, he barely passed.

Barely, just barely.

Everyone could see that Jian Wushuang had been one-sidedly beaten by the Puppet Fighter the entire time. If it kept attacking Jian Wushuang, it would win eventually, but time ran out.

“My performance in this second round really did look like I reached my limit. Perhaps everyone thinks I passed this second round because of luck?”?Jian Wushuang looked around, but he was laughing in his heart.

He didn’t care at all about what these geniuses thought of him.

They were free to believe that he barely won if that’s what they wanted to think. It was only the second round anyway, and there would still be a third and fourth round in which he would have many opportunities to reveal his strength.

In the Skyward Pavillion.

“This boy has good talent in Sword Principle, but it’s a pity that he’s weak in comprehension of the Dao and he’s still far from complete comprehension in the first level of the Slaughter Dao. Besides, he’s from the Ancient World.”

“He is good talented since he was able to get to this point from the Ancient World, but he is much weaker than the geniuses from the Eternal World.”

“Passing the second round is already his limit. As for the third round, he has no chance of passing it.”

The experts from the sects talked casually as they laughed. There were only a few small sects and one medium sect that sent people to invite Jian Wushuang.

As for the three magnates and the top sects, they didn’t do anything.

But in the room where the Ancient Sect was, Xuan Yi, the purple-haired man, looked at Jian Wushuang with a lot of interest.

“That little guy... hides his strength so well?” Xuan Yi smiled. “There are quite a few people hiding their strength in the Firmament Territory Feast, but he is one of the few who is hiding their strength the best.”

The other experts felt that Jian Wushuang’s strength was very normal.

Only Xuan Yi saw at a glance that Jian Wushuang had hidden his strength very deeply.

“I’ve seen so many Sword Principle geniuses and even some Sword Principle experts, among which were many great talents. But, no matter how gifted they were in Sword Principle, it wasn’t enough to influence me. However, this little guy... his Sword Soul actually caused my Sword Heart to become a little excited, ha ha...”

“He’s not simple.”

On the Drill Ground, the second round was still in process.

It went on for a whole day and night before the second round was finally over.

After the second round, only 124 of the 1,000 talents who emerged from the first round were left.

These 124 people were eligible to enter the third and fourth rounds of the genius battle while all the others were eliminated.

“Among the 124 people, there’re only... six from the Ancient World!”?Jian Wushuang frowned. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The five people next to him included Feng, Huo Ying, Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang, who all stood there and frowned as well.

The five of them, plus Jian Wushuang, were the only six among the 100,000-odd geniuses in the Ancient World who survived the first two rounds of the genius battle.

However, there were still 118 talents from the Eternal World remaining. The difference was too obvious.

Of course, those who could still stay after the first two rounds were very excellent. They were all transcendent talents.

In the Skyward Pavilion, plenty of sect experts were considering what conditions they should offer to attract the top geniuses on the Drill Ground.

At this moment, Xuan Yi, the purple-haired man in the Ancient Sect’s private room, finally made a move.

“Give the six tokens to these six people.” Xuan Yi passed the six tokens to the white-robed man.

“Aye.” The white-robed man nodded respectfully. Although he was surprised at Xuan Yi’s decision, he left immediately.

Seeing the white-robed man flying out of Xuan Yi’s room, many of the sect experts in the Skyward Pavilion immediately looked at him.

After all, this was Xuan Yi’s first invitation to the genius battle. They were all very curious about who the Ancient Sect, which had a great position in the whole Firmament Territory, and Xuan Yi, who was called the number one Eternal Realm cultivator in the Firmament Territory, would choose.

A large number of the sect experts, including the three people representing the three magnates, stared at the white-robed man.

When the white-robed man appeared on the Drill Ground, he directly walked toward the six geniuses from the Ancient World.

“Feng, Huo Ying, Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, Wu Huang, and Jian Wushuang!”

The white-robed man spoke in a cold voice.

Jian Wushuang and the other five people immediately looked at him.

“These are the tokens that Master Xuan Yi from the Ancient Sect ordered me to give you.”

After saying that, the white-robed man threw the six tokens to the six geniuses.

The white-robed man didn’t hide his voice in the least, so the surrounding geniuses from the Eternal World heard it and instantly fixed their sights on Jian Wushuang and the other five.
