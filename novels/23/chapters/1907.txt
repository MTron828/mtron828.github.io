Chapter 1908: Fierce Battle!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang!!”

There was a sudden roar, seemingly from the Highest Heaven. Number One Divine King’s face instantly grew red and his veins popped. There was fierce fire that was burning in his eyes, just like a lion in rage. His eyes were like lightning as he locked gazes with Jian Wushuang in the void in front.

“Haha, Number One Divine King, weren’t you calm earlier? You said it didn’t matter even if Lineage of Star prepared the trap. Why? I only killed one of the divine King from Divine King Island and you got so anxious?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Just like the experts in Lineage of Star and the Dao soldiers, Jian Wushuang had already attacked the moment they leaped out from the space wormhole.

Number Two Divine King from Divine King Island happened to be around him and Jian Wushuang had targeted him at the first instant.

He suddenly attacked and the four Hong Jun Golden Swords flew out simultaneously. Under full force, Number Two Divine King couldn’t resist at all. On top of that, he didn’t have any Chaotic Divine Treasure level defense armor. In an instant, Jian Wushuang killed him on the spot.

The speed was too fast. So fast that Number One Divine King didn’t manage to save him in time.

“I want to kill you!!!”

Number One Divine King felt hysteric. A Peak Emperor God’s terrifying aura spread out. He clenched the saber in his hand and took a leap forward to charge at Jian Wushuang.

Besides, Palace Master Wu Luo and the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church had locked onto Jian Wushuang as their target as well.

“Jian Wushuang, you escaped last time. You won’t be that lucky this time!” Palace Master Wu Luo’s voice was loud.

“Jian Wushuang, you have to die today!” The Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church beaming with cold light. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The two Peak Emperor God knew that no one was Jian Wushuang’s opponent one-on-one.

Jian Wushuang so that Jian Wushuang couldn’t free himself to attack the people at the surrounding battlefield.

The three Peak Emperor Gods charged to him but Jian Wushuang wasn’t fearful at all.

“Haha, in the previous battle, we had to show the white feather and I couldn’t mess with you much. But today, I’d love to fight against the three Emperor Gods heartily!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was rampage. He revealed his ancient tribe body with seven heads and fourteen arms while the four Hong Jun Golden Swords floated in front of his body.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang exploded his full power. After merely two hundred fifty years, he stood alongside the three Peak Emperor Gods again.

At their surrounding, the experts and Dao soldiers from both campsites started a ferocious war.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were constant bangs and thuds resounding.

The war was in a white-hot stage from the very beginning.

In the crowd, a creepy dim light followed by two flashes appeared in front of a white-haired man in white robe.

“I am Qian Mingzi. I have been looking forward to meeting Emperor God Tian Ling,” Qian Mingzi flashed a gentle smile.

“Qing Mingzi, never heard of you,” Emperor God Tian Ling’s face was cold and the gaze he looked at Qian Mingzi was as though he was a cloud of air.

“From today onwards, you will know of my name then. I won’t give you any chance to interfere with the battlefield,” Qian Mingzi smiled.

“You?” Emperor God Tian Ling’s eyes let out chilliness and there were no emotions.

“Why not give it a try?” Qian Mingzi didn’t talk further but charged at Emperor God Tian Ling.

Before the fight began, Jian Wushuang had already instructed him to hold Emperor God Tian Ling back so that he wouldn’t have a chance to take action.

Qing Mingzi naturally gave his best.

The war was earth-shattering. The fight was extremely ferocious.

To begin with, in terms of team formation alone, Lineage of Star wasn’t weaker than Star Extermination Alliance. In addition to the four one-eyed giants, their fighting power was even slighter stronger. Plus, Lineage of Star had the assistance of galaxy formation.

Since the beginning of the war, the experts and Dao soldiers of Lineage of Star had had the assistance of galaxy formation. Hence, the displayed power was obviously much stronger.

Besides, Hall Master, who was hidden in the depths of the galaxy, couldn’t stay put.

In one corner of the battlefield.

Dang! Dang!

There were two loud thuds and Emperor God Jiu Yin was sent backwards by his opponent. After a while, he steadied his figure. Then, he scoffed and plunged out again as his fighting power was not affected at all.

That scene made the Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, who was fighting with Emperor God Jiu Yin, look distressed.

Although the Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion wasn’t a Peak Emperor God, he was extremely close to one.

Many years ago, the Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion had once crossed paths with Emperor God Jiu Yin. Back then, Emperor God Jiu Yin would opt to avoid him when he saw him and he didn’t have the courage to fight with him.

But now…

“Emperor God Jiu Yin took advantage of the assistance from the surrounding formation and he has the courage to fight head-on with me. Plus, he has Chaotic Divine Treasure level’s armor to protect his body. I can do nothing about him,” the Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion was helpless.

In the void next to them.

“Poof!

One of the guest elders in Lineage of Star, a red-robed woman, was surprise-attacked by a Sir God and she was severely injured.

“Die!”

There were immediately two Sir Gods from Star Extermination Alliance, including a top Sir God that charged at her.

“Sh*t,” the red-robed woman’s face changed.

Just then… Vroom!!

Behind the red-robed woman, there was a space wormhole that appeared from nowhere. At the same time, there was a palm that was substantiated from energy extended from the inside of space wormhole and grabbed her into the space wormhole. The red-robed woman disappeared in the space wormhole and the space wormhole dispersed instantly.

“What?”

The two Sir Gods who had been charging at the red-robed woman were surprised.

In the void in the depth of the galaxy.

Vroom!

The red-robed lady’s figure appeared again.

“Thank you, Hall Master Yuan.”

The red-robed woman looked at Hall Master Yuan in front of her with gratitude.

She knew clearly that if Hall Master Yuan hadn’t managed to drag her there from the battlefield earlier, she was most likely be dead.

“Take your time to recover.”

Hall Master Yuan said while his gaze fixed upon the battlefield in the core region.

As soon as there were experts from Lineage of Star or Dao soldiers that were in danger on the battlefield, he would immediately take action to manipulate the spacetime within the formation to rescue them.

Then, he could reduce the damage of Lineage of Star tremendously.

Of course, in such a vigorous war, one might lose their life if they weren’t careful. Some came across dangers that Hall Master Yuan didn’t manage to rescue them from in time.

“It’s about time. We should start using that move.”

Hall Master Yuan muttered and his eyes were unusually cold.

In the core region of galaxy formation, on the huge battlefield, the experts from both campsites were fighting ferociously.

Just then, without any signs, there were three space wormholes that appeared suddenly in three corners on the battlefield. From the space wormholes, there was a ray of purple light that burst out.
