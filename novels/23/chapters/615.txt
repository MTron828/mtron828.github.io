The Eternal World was vast.

It was full of experts and killers!

Survival would be a more difficult endeavor in this world.

Firmament Territory was considered a huge territory in the Eternal World and it controlled millions of Ancient Worlds.

There were many warriors in the Ancient World but they were far weaker than those in the Eternal World.

Warriors in the Ancient World could only reach the Skyscraping Realm; the Divine Realm was inaccessible to them.

To become stronger, they had to go to the Eternal World. Usually, the only way in was to get an Ancient World Token and attend the Firmament Territory Feast, which was held every 3,000 years.

Firmament Territory Feast was the biggest gathering in the Firmament Territory. It was a dream destination for geniuses.

Each Firmament Territory Feast would attract innumerable geniuses, which included Skyscraping Realm experts from both the Ancient World and the Firmament Territory.

If their displays of talent and potential at the Firmament Territory Feast were appreciated by Firmament Territory’s top sects, they would receive many resources and treasures.

Today was the opening day of the Firmament Territory Feast.

Geniuses had come in great numbers.

Among the Ancient Worlds...

“Husband!”

“Father!”

“Master!”

An armor-clad and strapping middle-aged man with sword-shaped eyebrows was saying goodbye to his family and friends.

His name was Feng!

He was a born fighter and peerless genius!

He had reached the peak in this Ancient World with his unique gift in less than 100 years.

He had been unbeatable in this Ancient World 1,500 years ago.

There were many Skyscraping Realm experts and several had created their own Secret Skills in this Ancient World, but he was known as the strongest expert.

If the Skyscraping Realm experts with Secret Skills banded together, they would still be no match for him.

He had remained unbeatable for a long time. He had also spared no effort to elevate his son and other relations to the Skyscraping Realm.

His entire life appeared perfect.

Many experts in this Ancient World respected and admired him.

But only he knew that he had felt lonely for 1,500 years.

To have no rival was lonely.

He had been suffering from loneliness for 1,500 years.

Today, the Firmament Territory Feast would begin. His inner flame flared up again.

“I will be back. It wouldn’t take long.”

After saying goodbye to them, Feng waved and flew into the Portal.

...

In another Ancient World, a white-haired elder stood at the top of a mountain, looking up at the Portal above him.

“The Eternal World!”

His eyes were filled with frenzied excitement. He stepped forward in his bare white feet.

The white-haired man entered the Portal.

No one noticed that the expert who had suffered from loneliness in this Ancient World for 2,000 years had left.

This white-haired elder was Huo Ying.

There was a myth in this Ancient World that Huo Ying was unbeatable!

800 years ago, Huo Ying had disappeared. All thought that he had died or left.

In fact, he had concealed his identity and meditated alone in the mountains for all these years. That was because nothing in the Ancient World held his interest. Today, he left with the Ancient World Token.

Feng and Huo Ying were top geniuses who had been alone for years in their respective Ancient Worlds. The Firmament Territory Feast would be their chance for new adventures.

In these Ancient Worlds, there were many people like them.

The Firmament Territory Feast was held every 3,000 years, which was a long time for people in Ancient Worlds.

People like Feng and Huo Ying were considered lucky, unlike most of the others.

Some had no Ancient World Token.

Even more tragically, some managed to obtain tokens but died before the Firmament Territory Feast.

Only a few of them eventually made it to the Firmament Territory Feast.

The Firmament Territory Feast was a very rare opportunity for them.

No one would miss it.

...

They arrived at a vast Drill Ground. Its gem ground was transparent, a sight that no one from the Ancient Worlds had seen before.

Hum...

People arrived at the Drill Ground in succession. Soon, at least 100 thousand people had gathered there!

The arrivals included men and women of all ages who were dressed differently. All of them looked around curiously after arriving at the Drill Ground.

In the crowd, a black-robed young man with a longsword on his back surveyed his surroundings.

“Is this the Eternal World?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He noticed that the Eternal World was different from the Ancient World.

“Such a stable space.” Jian Wushuang touched the air and found that the space was much more stable than that of the Ancient World.

In the Ancient World, Dark Emperor’s secret skill could produce a space rift, and Xue Yang could heavily damage the space with simple moves.

But the Eternal World was different.

The space of the Eternal World was much more stable. Jian Wushuang was much stronger than Dark Emperor now but he knew that he couldn’t do any harm to this space even if he were a hundred or thousand times stronger.
