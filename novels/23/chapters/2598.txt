Chapter 2599: The Price of the Treasures

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took out several treasures which he had prepared.

The Black Chief peered at what was being displayed.

“These are...”

The Black Chief first looked at the four jade slips. He scanned through them before smiling. “Master, this is the first four volumes for the Divine Destructive Beast cultivation method. They are indeed valuable but I’m afraid the effect won’t be satisfactory if you put them up for auction.”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Firstly, this secret technique is quite unusual. Although it’s extremely powerful, the prerequisite for cultivation is very high hence not many people are interested in it.”

“Secondly, the Star Picking Pavilion has this cultivation method as well. These first four volumes you’ve got here probably comes from the Star Picking Pavilion. Whoever got the cultivation method from us would have also received the cultivation insights. The cultivation insights are only made available to the first person who received the cultivation method.

“Master, the cultivation insights in these four volumes of yours were taken away from what I see. This greatly reduces the value of these four volumes. Even if there’s an expert who’s interested in these four volumes, they will want to get it directly from the Star Picking Pavilion to receive the cultivation insights even if it costs more. No one will be interested in buying these four volumes from you,” said the Black Chief with a smile.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang’s face sank as he never expected that.

He knew the cultivation method was excellent and valuable. San Shouwang had been in the position of the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord for so many years and had accumulated so much wealth across those years. However, more than 90 percent of his wealth was used in exchange for these four volumes.

He had always thought these four volumes were of great value, but it was the opposite.

Those four volumes’ truly precious element was the cultivation insights contained therein, but those insights had been taken away by San Shouwang a long time ago.

Noticing the changes in Jian Wushuang’s expression, the Black Chief smiled and suggested, “Master, are you willing to sell these four volumes to the Star Picking Pavilion? We’re willing to offer two million Primordial Stones for them.”

“Two million Primordial Stones?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “Yes.”

The Black Chief smiled faintly.

San Shouwang did pay quite a hefty sum to get those four volumes of the Divine Destruction Beast, but the value had dropped greatly after the cultivation insights were taken away. They were worth less than 2,000,000 Primordial Stones.

The Black Chief offered 2,000,000 Primordial Stones for them to make a good impression because he saw the other treasures Jian Wushuang had taken out.

The Black Chief looked at the other treasures again.

“This is a Heavenly Treasure offensive divine weapon but unfortunately, its power is just average.” The Black Chief glanced at the pair of black boxing gloves.

The gloves were San Shousang’s offensive divine weapon which he left behind.

“The market price of an ordinary Heavenly Treasure offensive divine weapon is worth about one million Primordial Stones. The Star Picking Pavilion will probably buy this at nine hundred thousand Primordial Stones at most. If you sell this elsewhere to someone else who needs it, you might be able to dispose of it at around one million to one million two hundred thousand Primordial Stones.”

“This spear is not bad. Although it’s only a Low-level Heavenly Treasure, its power is much stronger than those gloves with its menacing and cold spirit. The price is estimated to be very close to a High-level Heavenly Treasure offensive divine weapon. You might be able to sell it for over two million Primordial Stones in the auction.” The Black Chief looked at the black spear.

Both Heavenly Treasure and Earthly Treasure were divided into three levels—Low-level, Ordinary-level, and High-level.

San Shouwang’s gloves and Zhong Hun’s black spear were just Low-level Heavenly Treasure offensive divine weapons, hence their prices were not very high.

However, the two remaining treasures which once belonged to Zhong Hun were quite extraordinary.

One of them was a Heavenly Treasure defensive armor and the other was the offensive divine soul weapon—Spiritual Stone Staff.

The Black Chief’s eyes constricted as he studied the two treasures.

The Black Chief said, “Even a Heavenly Ultimate God would be interested in getting a piece of Heavenly Treasure defensive armor. The armor you have here may be rather ordinary in terms of its power, but its value is still worth ten times more than an offensive divine weapon of the same level. This armor may be worth fifteen million Primordial Stones in the auction and if you are lucky to meet someone in need of this, you may be able to get a good twenty million Primordial Stones!”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows but was not surprised.

The body armor was worth ten times more than an offensive divine weapon of the same rank. If Zhong Hun’s black spear was worth 2,000,000 Primordial Stones, there was hope for the defensive armor to be sold for 20,000,000 million Primordial Stones.

“I see, so that’s how much a defensive armor could go for. In that case, the offensive divine soul weapon should be even more precious and rare compared to the defensive armor...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes had a glimmer of expectation.

The Black Chief stared momentarily at the Spiritual Stone Staff.

“This offensive divine soul weapon is extremely rare and also a piece of Heavenly Treasure. My goodness!” The Black Chief was at best a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God, but he held quite a high position in the Star Picking Pavilion and had seen countless kinds of treasures. Most of the treasures like the Heavenly Treasure defensive armor failed to catch his interest.

However, an offensive divine soul weapon was different.

It was one of the rarest and most precious treasures. It was much rarer and precious than the defensive armor.

The value of the Spiritual Stone Staff must be extremely high as it was a Heavenly Treasure.

“Master, this stone staff is very precious. I can’t estimate its specific value, but I’m sure it’s more than fifty million Primordial Stones. As for how much it’s worth, we shall find out in the auction,” said the Black Chief with a solemn expression, “Master, please allow me to go and discuss with the supervisor if we can put this piece of offensive divine soul weapon as the first item to be auctioned!

“If the first thing to be auctioned is a Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon, it will set a very lively atmosphere at the auction. In addition, the price of the first treasure auctioned will usually be higher. If you are lucky, you might get seventy to eighty million Primordial Stones.”

“The first item to be auctioned?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly before he asked in a surprised tone, “Shouldn’t something worth seventy to eighty million Primordial Stones is sold as a star product in the grand finale?”

Jian Wushuang knew that each auction would have a grand finale. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The treasure in the grand finale round was the most precious and important piece of all the treasures auctioned. Generally, there would be more than one piece of treasure with an average of around three to four pieces.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, the Spiritual Stone Staff was so valuable that it should qualify as a grand finale treasure.
