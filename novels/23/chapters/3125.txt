Chapter 3126: Killing Intent

——

“The black nail just now was very strange and terrifying! If I didn’t have a special constitution and ignored all kinds of poisons, I might have died at the hands of this person.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, he stared at Chu Yixiao in front of him, but there was a faint layer of killing intent condensed on his body.

He had always been a person who would not offend others if they did not offend him.

Chu Yixiao clearly wanted to kill him just now, so of course, he would not be merciful now.

Buzz!

The world shook.

The raging flame, mixed with endless white ice fog, produced endless power of ice and fire, rising from Jian Wushuang’s body.

The two natural powers of ice and fire perfectly fused together. The power of ice and fire swept wildly in all directions. In the blink of an eye, it covered the entire world, forming a huge world of ice and fire, the world of ice and fire, with Jian Wushuang as its core, was astonishingly vast.

The power of the ice and fire swimming dragon ruler, a domain type supreme treasure, began to show in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

This was a true treasure!

Under normal circumstances, only Principles Masters were qualified to have a true treasure, and it was an extremely precious domain-type true treasure.

Although Jian Wushuang was too weak to fully display the power of this true treasure, it was still terrifying to only show a part of it.

With a thought from Jian Wushuang, the endless power of ice and fire rose and pressed toward Chu Yixiao crazily.

Chu Yixiao’s body shook immediately. He felt as if he was about to be burned into ashes or frozen into an ice sculpture.

A huge pressure was exerted on his body.

“What is this? A domain? But how can this domain be so powerful?” Chu Yixiao was shocked.

This domain was indeed too powerful!

Jian Wushuang was using the full strength of the ice and fire domain with the divine power of a True Saint at the peak of the fifth rank, while Chu Yixiao was only at the peak of the fifth rank. With the same divine power, the power of the ice and fire realm was shocking.

“40%!”

“My strength has been suppressed by 40%!”

“How is this possible? Did he use a superior-grade domain-type holy treasure?!”

Chu Yixiao was shocked.

Jian Wushuang did not waste any more words with him. The power of ice and fire suppressed Chu Yixiao crazily. The cross-shaped purple light in front of him flickered, and then…whoosh. The purple light instantly shot out.

It was the seventh level of the Samsara Sword Formation, a thread of love!

“Get lost!”

Chu Yixiao waved the cyan giant hammer in his hand, trying to push back the purple light. However, under the pressure of the ice and fire domain, he could only use 60% of his strength and 60% of the power of the hammer to collide with the purple light, as a result, the impact force contained in the purple light changed the direction of the giant hammer at the first moment.

Jian Wushuang, who was at the back, flashed and unleashed his silver light movement technique.

Whoosh!

A hazy but beautiful sword-light lit up.

It was the Peerless Sword Manual, Star Dream!

Under the pressure of the domain, Chu Yixiao’s speed was greatly reduced. He could not keep up with Jian Wushuang’s speed at all, so naturally, he could not block Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

Chi!

The sword light passed through Chu Yixiao’s divine body. Although it did not directly cut Chu Yixiao’s divine body into two, the ice-cold Sword Edge had already torn open the armor on Chu Yixiao’s body and even cut open his skin, three drops of the evil god poison surged into Chu Yixiao’s body.

Chu Yixiao’s body trembled, and another 10% of his divine power was eroded!

Previously, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship had torn open the armor on his body once and eroded 10% of his divine power. Adding this 10% , it was 20% of his divine power. In addition, he had used his most powerful move while riding on the sword, he had used up 20% of his divine power to control the god-slaying nail.

In other words, Chu Yixiao had used up 40% of his divine power!

“No, I can’t keep up with his speed under the pressure of this realm. I’ll be his target if I fight with him. One sword strike from him is enough to make me lose 10% of my divine power. I only have 60% of my divine power left. In other words, he only needs to use six more sword strikes to kill me!”

“No!”

Chu Yixiao’s expression changed drastically. As a genius disciple of Purple Cloud Pavilion, he did not take Jian Wushuang seriously at first, but now he was completely flustered.

“Stop, stop!”

“I’m not going to interfere in this matter. Stop right now!”

Chu Yixiao shouted.

However, Jian Wushuang did not pay any attention to him and did not stop at all.

On the surface, he suppressed Chu Yixiao with the seventh reincarnation sword formation. Then, he took the opportunity to display his swordsmanship, which made Chu Yixiao unable to resist him.

Chi!

Another sword attack was launched, and Chu Yixiao only had 50% of his divine power left.

“Boy, I am one of the outstanding genius disciples of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. My master is the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s Heart Witch Elder, a super expert close to the peak of rank seven. If you dare to kill me, the Purple Cloud Pavilion and my master will never let you go!”

“Stop!”

“Let’s stop now. You and I will have a better life. Otherwise, if I die, you will die too!”

Chu Yixiao shouted again.

“You are about to die, and you still threaten me?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, but the killing intent in his body had reached its peak. He still did not stop.

Around the battlefield, the evil master and Mirage Water had been staring at Jian Wushuang. While they were in awe and admiration, they also heard Chu Yixiao’s words. They immediately sneered, “This idiot, he’s already come this far, yet he still wants to use the Purple Heaven Pavilion to suppress the Heaven Marquis. What a joke!”

“Purple Heaven Pavilion?”

“It’s only dominating in the First Heaven, but it’s nothing in the Second Heaven or Third Heaven. In front of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, it’s as weak as an ant. What kind of status does the Heaven Marquis have to care about the Purple Heaven Pavilion?”

Both evil master and Mirage Water were disdainful.

Although Jian Wushuang was not a genius disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, the fact that the Three Palace Masters could make an exception for him to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm was enough to make him a powerful figure in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, many high-level experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were paying attention to him.

Compared to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Purple Cloud Pavilion was nothing?

Even Evil Master and Mirage Water, two disciples of the Primitive Palace, did not care about the Purple Cloud Pavilion, so why should Jian Wushuang care?

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s figure was cold, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand struck out again and again. Chu Yixiao, who was suppressed by the domain, could not resist at all.

Chi! Chi!

In the blink of an eye, Chu Yixiao had less than 20% of his divine power left.

With less than 20% of his divine power, Jian Wushuang only needed two strikes to kill him.

“Stop, stop!”

“Spare me, spare my life!”

“Deacon Long, save me, quickly save me!”

Chu Yixiao’s laughter was extremely shrill. He screamed crazily and also called Deacon Long to help him.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
