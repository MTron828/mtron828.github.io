Chapter 1484: Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure was extremely hard to come across and it was an extremely valuable treasure.

Even among Real Gods in Eternal Chaotic World, there was hardly any who owned Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure.

For instance, when Jian Wushuang killed ten Real Gods in Sky Sword Prison and retrieved their Qian Kun rings, there was only one Real God who owned a Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure and the Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure that the Real God owned was a long spear.

The long spear was an divine attack weapon.

Jian Wushuang used a sword. Even if he received a Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure which was a spear, he could only look at it.

But then, he received a bonus reward from completing the Ultimate Disciple Task in Lineage of Star. The bonus reward was aimed for him. The Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure was definitely something he could use.

“Jian Wushuang, first tell me which segment of Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure you’d like,” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“This…” Jian Wushuang thought for a while then he lifted his head and answered, “To me, the most useful thing will be a Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure in forming realm.

“Forming realm?” Hall Master Yuan stunned.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He knew clearly how useful a realm treasure would be.

In an evenly matched situation, a person with a realm treasure would definitely be at an advantage.

Plus, even if one were in danger, he could use a realm treasure to suppress his enemy and make an escape easily.

Hitting when one pleased and leaving when one wished. That was the biggest advantage of realm treasure.

Jian Wushuang had always possessed a realm treasure, blazing quicksand gourd. It was a pity that the stronger his power grew, the less useful the blazing quicksand realm would be to him.

For instance, when he was in Sky Sword Prison, he gave his all to performing blazing quicksand realm, but it only had suppressing power to Universe God in the third and fourth level to a certain extent. To Universe Gods who were stronger, the effect was rather unnoticeable.

Hence, he naturally wanted to get another stronger realm treasure.

However, after hearing Jian Wushuang’s reply, Hall Master Yuan’s expression grew strange. He said, “Jian Wushuang, how dare you? Out of various kinds of treasure, realm treasure is no doubt the rarest and hardest treasure to come by. Comparing the Real God level Chaos Unique Treasures, a realm Chaos Unique Treasure could equal a few divine attack weapons.”

Jian Wushuang was speechless.

Hall Master Yuan shook his head and continued, “Forget about Real God level realm Chaos Unique Treasure for now. I shall prepare two treasures and you can choose from them carefully.”

Then, Hall Master Yuan waved. A green sword and crimson armor that gave out a strange aura appeared in the void before him.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the two treasures.

“You should be able to see for yourself. The green sword is a divine attack weapon while the crimson armor is a defense treasure. Look…” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, pick the crimson armor,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “Hall Master Yuan, I pick the armor.”

“You’re quite smart,” Hall Master Yuan smiled too, “Among treasures of the same kind, although armor couldn’t be compared to realm treasure, it is more valuable than a divine attack weapon. The crimson armor is named Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor and I specially picked it for you.”

“Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor?” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

The armor’s name included the word ‘reincarnation’.

“Jian Wushuang, you should have comprehended Reincarnation Doctrine from the four Supreme Doctrines, right?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded and admitted it straightaway.

“That’s it, then. Not only is Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor great in defense power, it contains a secret skill that can enhance one’s power. The secret skill requires the power of Reincarnation to trigger it. The higher one’s comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine is, the stronger the power triggered from the secret skill. However, relying on your current comprehension level, it should still be rather difficult to trigger the secret skill,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang grabbed the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor straight away. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He touched the armor gently with his palm. Jian Wushuang could even faintly resonate with the armor.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s smile grew even wider.

“Oh yeah, as you already have Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor. Please pass me the Blood-killing Plate Armor,” Hall Master Yuan looked over.

“Blood-killing Plate Armor?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Blood-killing Plate Armor is Holocaust Sect’s treasure after all. Previously, you were weaker in power and there was no better treasure. You had no choice but to use Blood-killing Plate Armor, but now…”

“Your power had increased tremendously and you have got yourself a stronger Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor. It’s best to not keep Blood-killing Plate Armor with you. The experts from Holocaust Sect possess a certain sensory power to Blood-killing Plate Armor after all. If you were to wander in Eternal Chaotic World with Blood-killing Plate Armor with you, you might catch the attention of the people from Holocaust Sect,” Hall Master Yuan explained.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

In Sky Sword Prison, he had been under Blood Emperor’s watch because of Blood-killing Plate Armor.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were definitely more hidden Holocaust Sect experts. There definitely were experts stronger than Blood Emperor but he had never come across one before.

It was naturally best to pass Blood-killing Plate Armor to Hall Master Yuan.

Jian Wushuang removed the owner recognition on Blood-killing Plate Armor then passed it to Hall Master Yuan.

“This Blood-killing Plate Armor saved my life countless times.”

Jian Wushuang sighed. Although he loathed to hand it over, he had no choice.

Blood-killing Plate Armor was Holocaust Sect’s treasure after all.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang left Hall Master Yuan’s and returned to Sword Star where he resided.

He saw Qiu Yue on Sword Star and briefly asked about how the internal affairs in Lineage of Star had been over the past four thousand years. Then, Jian Wushuang opted to cultivate in seclusion.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat down while the crimson Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor floated before him.

“Start owner recognition!”

There was a glimpse of light shimmering in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and he started the owner recognition process.

Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor was a Real God level Chaos Unique Treasure after all. It wasn’t easy for it to recognize a new owner, but fortunately, Jian Wushuang comprehended Reincarnation Doctrine and he was a person of quick comprehension. There wasn’t any accident in the process of owner recognition. A month later, Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor turned into a crimson robe and was put on by Jian Wushuang.

After owner recognition, Jian Wushuang started studying the secret skill in Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor.

Jian Wushuang was surprised when he started to study it.

“Haha, Hall Master Yuan only knew I comprehended Reincarnation Doctrine but he didn’t know how much I comprehended Reincarnation Doctrine. Its beginner level requires one to possess comprehension level towards Reincarnation Doctrine that could pass through the first level of Doctrine Palace!”

“And I, happen to reach the prerequisites!”
