Chapter 3145: The Fight Began

——

In another secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Jian Wushuang, wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, was sitting at a table, holding a piece of information that he had just received.

“Sure enough, after the heart witch died, the Purple Cloud Pavilion became furious and tried to kill me. Not only did they issue a kill order, but they even put a bounty on the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and all the intelligence organizations in the First Heaven to find my whereabouts. However, this is exactly what I want.” Jian Wushuang looked at the information in his hand, a strange smile appeared on his face.

He had long expected the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s anger and was mentally prepared for it.

In the face of the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s kill order and the bounty from the intelligence organizations, ordinary rank four True Saints and even rank seven True Saints would be terrified. However, Jian Wushuang was not. Not only did he not panic, but he also looked forward to it, on the contrary, he was looking forward to it.

“The road to becoming an expert is full of obstacles. In this life, I rose up in endless territories. In the beginning, I encountered some obstacles in the Pill Sun Sacred World. However, after leaving the Pill Sun Sacred World, I rarely encountered any obstacles

“There are very few experts in the endless territories. It’s normal that I don’t encounter any big obstacles. However, this is the First Heaven, where there are as many experts as clouds…my strength increases, and my rise requires a large number of whetstones. The Purple Cloud Pavilion will be my first whetstone after I come to the First Heaven.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining brightly.

If an ordinary person heard that Jian Wushuang treated the Purple Cloud Pavilion as a whetstone, they would definitely think that he was crazy.

However, Jian Wushuang was full of confidence.

It was his own strength and confidence in his talent.

He was not worried that he would not be able to withstand the anger of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Instead, he was worried that the Purple Cloud Pavilion was not enough.

“Let the slaughter begin!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, and the token in his hand that recorded the information of the Purple Cloud Pavilion immediately shattered.

Three months later, in the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion in the First Heaven.

In the vast void, two figures were flying forward side by side.

They were a man and a woman. Their auras were very strong, and they had reached the peak of rank five!

A peak rank five True Saint. With such strength, they could already hold the position of deacons within the Purple Cloud Pavilion. These two people were the two Deacons of the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

As they rushed forward, they were still chatting idly.

“The ruler of the Hengshui Kingdom just now was very generous. Not only did he pay us enough money, he even prepared ten million holy elixirs for each of us,” the red-robed woman said. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“He’s smart. He knows that he can give us some benefits, so we won’t deliberately make things difficult for him. Some of the monarchs are as stupid as pigs. Every time, they insist that we use some tricks before they are willing to give us benefits,” said the white-robed, white-bearded old man with a smile.

“Haha, that’s true. However, no matter what, although the two of us aren’t strong and can only be considered at the bottom among the Deacons of the Purple Cloud Pavilion, we are considered lucky to be able to get this job,” said the red-robed woman.

“That’s not just good, it’s very good. You don’t know that our current job is very lucrative. There are so many Deacons in the Purple Cloud Pavilion. I wonder how many Deacons envy our job,” said the white-robed, white-bearded elder.

As the two of them conversed, they were clearly in an extremely good mood.

But suddenly…a figure appeared in front of the two of them without any warning.

The red-clothed woman and the white-robed, white-bearded elder immediately stopped.

Both of them raised their heads and looked at the person.

The person was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask. This was clearly the attire of a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and the aura emanating from his body had already reached the limit of the rank four.

“Who are you?” The white-robed, white-bearded elder shouted in a low voice.

They were rank five Peak True Saints. Facing a rank four True Saint, they naturally had the right to look down from above.

“My name is Heavenly Sword Marquis. You should have heard of me.” A cold voice came from under the gray mask.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The white-robed, white-bearded elder and the red-clothed woman’s expressions changed drastically.

They were Deacons of the Purple Cloud Pavilion, so of course, they knew Heavenly Sword Marquis, who had angered the Purple Cloud Pavilion and issued a kill order.

“It’s you? How dare you appear in front of us?” The red-clothed woman shouted.

“It’s just two dead people, why wouldn’t I dare?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said playfully, “You should have finished sending the message, right?”

The white-robed, white-bearded elder and the red-robed woman were stunned.

They were secretly sending the message to the Purple Cloud Pavilion, but Jian Wushuang knew this and did not intend to stop them.

“Since you have finished sending the message, you two can go to hell.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

Then, he directly attacked.

There were only two True Saints at the peak of rank five. With Jian Wushuang’s strength, he killed them in a flash.

After killing them, Jian Wushuang left.

When the experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion received the message and sent them, Jian Wushuang had already gone to God knows where.

The two Deacons of Purple Cloud Pavilion were just the beginning of Jian Wushuang’s slaughter.

Two months later, the five core disciples of Purple Cloud Pavilion were targeted while they were out training. All five of them died, and none survived. The killer…was Heavenly Sword Marquis!

Half a year later, a True Saint expert at the peak of rank six of Purple Cloud Pavilion was killed in a city. The killer…was Heavenly Sword Marquis!

Three years later, at a neutral auction, eight people from the Purple Cloud Pavilion participated. Five of them were rank six True Saints, and three of them were rank five True Saints. They spent a lot of holy elixirs and bought several treasures at the auction! As soon as the eight people walked out of the auction, they were immediately killed. All eight experts died, and the murderer was still Heavenly Sword Marquis!

Five years later, in a country…

…

While Purple Cloud Pavilion gave Jian Wushuang a kill order and frantically searched for his escape route, Jian Wushuang also set his eyes on Purple Cloud Pavilion.

To everyone’s surprise, he directly entered the territory controlled by Purple Cloud Pavilion and crazily killed the solitary experts of Purple Cloud Pavilion.

The Purple Cloud Pavilion was a large sect with countless experts and disciples. Many of them were wandering in the outside world and were active in this territory. Jian Wushuang had his eyes on them, he got detailed information from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and then went to find them.

In just ten years, Jian Wushuang had attacked eight times. More than 30 experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion had died at his hands, including many rank six True Saints.

This incident not only shocked the Purple Cloud Pavilion but also shocked the outside world.

Everyone knew that Jian Wushuang had completely fought with the Purple Cloud Pavilion!
