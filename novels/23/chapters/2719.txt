Chapter 2720: Principle Spirits

On the other side of the special area, the bald and stockily built Elder Saber Master had ignored the souls and illusions obstacles by relying on his peremptory strength and was the first person to step foot to the edge of the area.

Saber Master stopped and turned around to have a look after he passed through the area.

He originally thought the second person to go through and follow behind him should be either the Grand Ultimate Gods Hong Chen or Long Xianzi. However, the first person to appear beside him was Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was the second person to pass through the area.

“Oh? Su Han, it looks like your soul and state of mind is quite strong?” Saber Master said.

“Thank you for your praises, Saber Master.” Jian Wushuang only smiled indifferently as his line of sight continued to focus on the people still inside that area.

The chaotic soul effects and illusions in the area were extremely powerful. Jian Wushuang only managed to cross the area with ease due to the help from the Exquisite Pagoda.

As for the others, Hong Chen and Long Xianzi were alright with perfectly calm expressions on their faces. They were only slightly slower.

However, Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen had darkened expressions on their faces. It was obvious the two needed strenuous effort to resist the chaotic soul effects and illusions. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Although they required strenuous effort, they did not stop their pace because of it.

Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, Yi Shen, and the Devilish Wind King continued to advance the area with the Devilish Wind King being the last to pass through the area.

“Alliance Master Su Han, I never expect your soul and state of mind to be of such a high level!” The Devilish Wind King looked at Jian Wushuang in a slightly surprised manner.

He had some information about Jian Wushuang and also knew that Jian Wushuang had improved extremely fast.

In his opinion, increasing one’s realm in such a quick manner would usually result in lowering one’s soul and state of mind.

On the contrary, Jian Wushuang was much more relaxed than any of them and was only slower than Saber Master.

“I managed to raise it after experiencing a lot of hardship.” Jian Wushuang only casually made an excuse before the group of six continued moving forward.

Not long after that, the six of them arrived in a special void.

That void also had a huge amount of hazy air current enshrouding it. However, those air currents were golden in color.

“We’ve arrived in the second dangerous area.” The Saber Mater looked at the void in front of them.

The expression on Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, Yi Shen, and Devilish Wind King faces had turned extremely serious.

They had explored the secret realm 50 years ago and faced many dangers. The first dangerous area they faced just moments ago focuses on their soul and state of mind. It was considered the least dangerous area. However, the second dangerous zone was much deadlier compared to the first.

“Alliance Master Su Han, do you have any pills or items that can recover our divine power within a short time?” The Devilish Wind King glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“I do have some pills and precious items that can recover one’s divine power in a short time,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“That should do. The second dangerous area we’re going to face is going to be much more difficult compared to the first. You have to be extremely careful. Apart from that, don’t be reluctant to use those pills and precious items to recover your divine power as you have to ensure your divine power is always abundant,” said the Devilish Wind King.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Let’s go!” The Saber Master said and was the first to enter the void filled with golden air currents in front of him.

Jian Wushuang and the remaining four also followed behind him and skimmed into the void.

At that moment when they entered the void filled with golden air currents... Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Some soft noises could be heard from the void around them.

“They’re coming.” The Saber Master had a cold glint in his eyes.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several golden figures could be seen densely packed in the void around them before turning into golden streams and shooting at the six of them.

“What are these things?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed as he focused on the golden figures that had no substance and formed purely from the golden air currents. Jian Wushuang could feel the strong existence of principle in those golden air currents.

“Could they be principle spirits?”

Principle spirits... Jian Wushuang learned about that term from Purple Blood Saint’s insights he previously obtained.

Purple Blood Saint had a high understanding of the Sword Principle and clearly understood the number of levels the Sword Principle had.

There was a huge difference between the beginning Principle World, the second stage Principle Tree, and the third stage Formation of All Things.

Stepping across each stage would result in a huge improvement to a person’s overall strength.

Especially the third Formation of All Things stage—was an unimaginably incredible method.

These principle spirits evolved purely from principles but had self-awareness.

Many principle spirits formed and attacked the six of them from all directions in the special void at that moment.

Jian Wushuang dared not act carelessly and immediately unsheath his Blood Mountain Sword before waving it single-handedly.

Slash~~ The shrill sword shadows directly cut outward and slashed the principle spirits coming towards him into halves. The sword shadows continued to slash outward and killed many principle spirits before disappearing.

“These principle spirits are actually so weak?” Jian Wushuang was extremely surprised.

He originally thought the owner of that secret realm was an extreme expert, hence the principle spirits formed should be extremely strong. However, he discovered that these principle spirits were not that strong upon engaging them. Every principle spirit was only at the ordinary High-level Heaven Ultimate God level of strength.

A wave of his sword was sufficient to kill many such principle spirits.

However, Jian Wushuang was unable to cheer up even though he knew those principle spirits were very weak.

After all, there were too many principle spirits around them.

They were so densely packed with at least tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of them.

On the other hand, those principle spirits did not have any self-awareness and only knew to attack them. The six of them were extremely strong and able to resist the attacks. However, the most crucial point was they still had to utilize their divine power to block the attacks of so many principle spirits.

Apart from that, it consumed an extremely high amount of their divine power.

He finally understood the reason Devilish Wind King asked if he had prepared divine power recovery pills that took effect in a short time.

It would take them a slightly longer time to cross through the wide void. During that time, they had to resist the crazed attacks from those principle spirits with their full capacity which consumed a huge amount of their divine power. It would result in their deaths if their divine power had been exhausted before managing to completely crossover the area.

“Be careful and try your best to conserve your divine power!

“Damn it, there are really too many of these principle spirits.”

There was really a lot of them.

The densely packed principle spirits came swarming toward them from their surroundings such that even Jian Wushuang had to use his full might to withstand them which also caused his divine power to be rapidly consumed.
