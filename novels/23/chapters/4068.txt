Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Boy, do you think I will answer your question honestly? Who do you think you are, a Supreme Elder?” Emperor Rain mocked.

“It’s okay if you don’t say it now. After I suppress you, I will have time to ask you slowly.” Jian Wushuang did not waste time with Emperor Rain. He waved his hand, instantly, the three Heaven Suppression Tablets in the surrounding void burst out with dazzling golden light.

On the Heaven Suppression Tablet, the three enormous golden divine devil phantoms condensed, and the already powerful suppressive force rose again.

“A suppression-type principle treasure?” Emperor Rain’s pupils constricted.

The suppressive force of a suppression-type Principle treasure was already very powerful. He still had more than half of it left and could barely resist the suppressive force. However, once he was seriously injured and fell into a weakened state…Jian Wushuang could control the principle-type supreme treasure and completely suppress him. His life and death would be controlled by his opponent.

“You want to suppress me? In your dreams!” Emperor Rain roared and struggled desperately in the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation.

However, the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation was a powerful Suppressive Formation performed by three Heaven Suppression Tablets at the same time. If Jian Wushuang were to perform it personally, Emperor Rain would not be able to escape the Suppressive Power of the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang also made a decisive move.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

One after another, mysterious sword lights slashed toward Emperor Rain. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

These sword lights were imbued with a rich universal principle. They were unfathomable and incredibly fast. Emperor Rain could barely withstand one or two of them, but the remaining ones were still standing on his divine body.

One sword, two swords. After just a few swords, more than 80% of Emperor Rain’s divine power had been destroyed. His aura had become extremely weak.

At this point, it would be extremely difficult for him to block the suppressive force of the Heaven Suppression Array.

But at this moment, a change occurred!

Boom!

A pale palm appeared out of thin air. This palm expanded infinitely in the air and in an instant, it forcefully tore open a hole in the heaven suppression array. It then grabbed Emperor Rain.

The entire Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation shook violently. The three Golden Divine Devil Phantoms on the Heaven Suppression Tablet dimmed slightly, and the entire formation almost collapsed.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

With his current strength, the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation cast by the three Heaven Suppression Tablets was forcefully torn apart and almost collapsed?

His opponent’s strength was extraordinary.

Buzz! An old figure appeared in the magic formation and stood beside Emperor Rain.

“First Elder!”

Seeing the arrival, Emperor Rain, who was already extremely weak and almost despaired, was overjoyed. His eyes shone with a dazzling light again.

“First Elder?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He knew all the information about the top officials of the Thunder God Palace. Among them, the three ultimate level Rulers were the strongest and most respected.

The First Elder of the Thunder God Palace was one of the three ultimate level Rulers.

“Ultimate level Rulers?” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, but he was very surprised, “When I attacked, I had already completely sealed off the surrounding space and time. Although Emperor Rain was in a desperate situation, he shouldn’t have been able to send a message for help. Even if he could, the senior experts of the Thunder God Palace shouldn’t have been able to arrive so quickly. But this great elder…

“How did he know that Emperor Rain was in danger and how did he arrive here in time?” Jian Wushuang was very confused.

But in fact, not only him, but also Emperor Rain was very surprised.

“First Elder, why are you here?” Emperor Rain asked immediately.

“When I saw you in the palace, I already knew something was wrong,” the old figure said, “our Thunder God Palace has stood in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy for a long time, and we have many enemies. However, only a handful of them can reach the fifth level. Moreover, under the strong influence of our Thunder God Palace, these enemies usually hide. It’s already good enough that our Thunder God Palace doesn’t actively pursue them. Who has the courage to directly take revenge on our Thunder God Palace?”

“And this time, it was an unknown powerhouse who suddenly destroyed the Blood Thunder Cliff. Your disciple Zhenhuang happened to be there as well. This is too much of a coincidence.

“So, when you rushed out to avenge your disciple, I followed you secretly just in case. Unfortunately, I was a little slow and could only save you in time. I couldn’t save the two principle-enforcing elders as well.” The First Elder of Thunder God Palace sighed.

Whether it was Emperor Rain and the other two or the First Elder of Thunder God Palace, they all arrived at the second-grade astral world through the universe passage.

However, after the same universe passage was activated once, it would take a while for it to be activated a second time. It was during this time that the First Elder of Thunder God Palace was delayed a little.

In addition, Jian Wushuang was too strong and too fast. When the First Elder of Thunder God Palace arrived, the two principle enforcement elders were already dead, but Emperor Rain was still alive and had not been completely suppressed.

“First Elder, this is the person who killed Zhenhuang and the third and eighth principle enforcement elders. If you hadn’t arrived in time, I’m afraid I would have died in his hands and at the very least, I would have been suppressed.” Emperor Rain stared at Jian Wushuang, he gnashed his teeth and said.

The First Elder of Thunder God Palace also fixed his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“A third-level Ruler?” The First Elder of Thunder God Palace narrowed his turbid eyes slightly.

“First Elder, although he is only a third-level Ruler, his strength is very terrifying. He killed the third and eighth enforcement elders with only two strikes. His battle strength is definitely at the pinnacle of the fifth-level. He is even stronger than me,” Emperor Rain said immediately.

“I can see that if he doesn’t have enough strength, he won’t dare to plot against the first principle enforcement elder of the Thunder God Palace.” The voice of the First Elder of the Thunder God Palace became cold, “I don’t know who you are, but since you dare to plot against the Thunder God Palace, you shall die today.”

“Oh, you are very confident?” Jian Wushuang’s lips curled up.

Boom!

The First Elder of Thunder God Palace made a move directly. He did not move much and simply flipped his hand.

In an instant, a large amount of divine power, accompanied by endless power of Principles, rapidly gathered in the void. In the blink of an eye, it formed a giant jade-like hand.

The giant hand occupied more than half of the sky, and Jian Wushuang was under the cover of the giant hand. He looked up and could clearly sense the destructive aura contained in the giant hand.
