Chapter 1544: Deal

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The experts in the hall were still waiting.

However, as the Star Palace Master came personally, there was no one who dared to plot against Jian Wushuang anymore.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang came out from the cave.

On the island, at the entrance of Wu Bei’s cave, Jian Wushuang leapt out along with a flash of light. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Just as he leapt out of the cave, the entrance behind him immediately shook and collapsed entirely.

Wu Bei’s cave then vanished into thin air.

Jian Wushuang only shook his head in silence when he saw what happened.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Lei Chao instantly sent him a message, “Did you see the palace above you? Hurry up and come over.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate but plunged towards the palace and appeared in the lofty hall.

Once Jian Wushuang had appeared in the lofty hall, he instantly felt the bold, vigorous auras in the hall.

Every single aura was terrifyingly strong.

Especially those seated in the higher areas in the hall. The casually-spread aura was already suffocating him.

“This, these people…” Jian Wushuang looked at the people around him and he felt dreadful.

He knew clearly that anyone at the scene could kill him easily.

These people were looking him up and down too. That made Jian Wushuang even more horrified.

“Jian Wushuang, hurry. Come and great Palace Master,” Lei Chao’s voice was heard.

“Palace Master?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and followed Lei Chao’s guidance. He immediately looked at the white-haired elderly in the middle of the hall.

“Greetings, Palace Master,” Jian Wushuang immediately bowed and let out a breath of relief from the bottom of his heart, “It turned out that Palace Master came personally. I guess I don’t have to worry much,”

“Get up,” Star Palace Master waved and Jian Wushuang stood up.

The fiery-haired elderly next to Star Palace Master, Huo You, looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange look in his eyes.

“This aura… Universe God in the Second Heaven?” Huo You was surprised but he instantly understood.

“Haha, Old Monster of Star Palace, I finally know this young man’s secret. Haha…”

Huo You laughed heartily. However, due to the restriction of the surrounding void, the people around them, including the Almighties, didn’t know what he was talking about.

Huo You was one who was on equal footing as the Star Palace Master. The treasure that the Star Palace Master had made personally could conceal Jian Wushuang’s aura from everyone else at the scene, including the Almighties, but not him.

He definitely could tell Jian Wushuang’s ins and outs then.

He could tell that Jian Wushuang was merely a Universe God in the Second Heaven but people treated him as Universe God in the Third Heaven because of a treasure on him that concealed his aura.

As a Universe God in the Second Heaven, he was so powerful and he was in the top three on the Universe God ranking list?

No ordinary cultivator would be able to do that. There was only one kind of person who can do that.

An Inverse cultivator!

An inverse cultivator like Real God Wu Bei!

Huo You was certain that Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator.

“Huo You, do you remember what you promised me earlier?” Star Palace Master glanced at Huo You.

“Of course I do,” Huo You smiled, “Four White Blaze Fruits and I will keep this young man from Lineage of Star’s secret. I’ll never leak his identity as an inverse cultivator to anyone in the future. How about that?”

“Four?” Star Palace Master squinted his eyes, “You’re good at taking advantage, huh?”

“Haha, it’s only four White Blaze Fruits. Jian Wushuang got nine of them in the cave and also two White Blaze Fruit Trees. With the two White Blaze Fruit Trees, you can have however many White Blaze Fruits you want. What are four pieces to you?” Huo You laughed.

The Star Palace Master was on friendly terms with him but that didn’t change the fact that he took advantage of the Star Palace Master.

Plus, four pieces of White Blaze Fruits were really nothing much from the harvest that Jian Wushuang had got from Wu Bei’s cave.

“Four pieces of White Blaze Fruits, deal,” the Star Palace Master agreed directly.

“Great,” Huo You’s smile grew even wider.

The people in the surroundings could see Huo You talking to Star Palace Master and they seemed to reach a mutual agreement but they didn’t know the context of their agreement.

“Jian Wushuang, pass me the White Blaze Fruit Trees,” Star Palace Master looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and immediately took out the two special rings that he had gotten from Wu Bei’s cave.

He looked at the two rings and the surrounding experts, including the Almighties. There was a glimpse of heat in their eyes but they pressed it down forcefully.

“The rings are quite interesting. I wonder how Wu Bei got them,” Star Palace Master briefly glanced at the rings and pocketed them.

“Pass me the four pieces of White Blaze Fruits that you got from Wu Bei’s cave,” Star Palace Master said again.

Jian Wushuang immediately took out four pieces of White Blaze Fruit.

Star Palace Master passed the four pieces of White Blaze Fruits to Huo You.

“Jian Wushuang, do you have any other matter to deal with? If not, follow me back to Lineage of Star,” Star Palace Master looked at him.

“Palace Master, please hold on for a while,” Jian Wushuang replied and came before an Almighty before everyone’s watch.

The Almighty was naturally the owner of Sky Sword Mountain.

“Senior Sky Sword, previously you told Mister Lei Chao to send me a message. I wonder, does it still count?” Jian Wushuang asked politely.

“Of course, of course it counts,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain smiled, “When the fight is over, I said that as long as you offered me two White Blaze Fruits, you, who I once imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, could release anyone you wished.”

“Here are two pieces of White Blaze Fruits. I’d like Senior Sky Sword to release Fiery King from Sky Sword Prison. Let him be free,” Jian Wushuang took out two White Blaze Fruits.

“Haha, no problem. When I return, I shall release him immediately without any delay,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain was delighted.

“Please tell him to send me a message when he gets released,” Jian Wushuang said as he let out a breath of relief.

Fiery King, also the founder of Lineage of Scarlet. The secret skill of Scarlet Kingdom was created by Fiery King himself.

Previously when he was imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, Fiery King took good care of him and Jian Wushuang was grateful. He wanted to rescue Fiery King.

Then, he had finally made the owner of Sky Sword Mountain release Fiery King. He considered himself to be removing a thorn in his heart.

“Two pieces of White Blaze Fruit in exchange for the freedom of a first stage Real God. Sky Sword, you made quite a good deal. Huh?” Star Palace Master glanced at the owner of Sky Sword Mountain.

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain smiled awkwardly.

However, Star Palace Master didn’t worry much about him and left with Jian Wushuang and Lei Chao soon after.
