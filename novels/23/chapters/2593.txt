Jian Wushuang murmured, “I reckon this stone staff probably helped Zhong Hun to execute that magnificent soul attack. Although I know about soul attacks, it’s not my forte and this stone staff is only useful for me to a certain extent.”

A cultivator had limited capacity to cultivate and that applied to even super-geniuses.

Jian Wushuang was a prime example. He meticulously studied sword principles and sword techniques and was also working on sharpening Space-time Law, Transmigration Law, and several other extremely powerful secret techniques at the same time. Under those circumstances, he was unable to split his attention into researching soul power.

His soul had improved over the years with the only progress being in increasing his soul power. He did not work on mastering soul attack techniques. It did not mean that he was uninterested in pursuing the area just that he had too much on his plate.

Someone powerful like Zhong Hun who was good at soul attacks probably spent more than 90 percent of his life perfecting his techniques and would therefore know all kinds of soul techniques to open up his very own Soul World. The downside was that his attack towards one’s body would probably be weaker.

Jian Wushuang could only focus on attacks of the body. In terms of soul attacks, he might study and perform soul attacks when necessary but it was impossible to compare with those experts who immersed their time in studying the soul techniques. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After letting out a couple of sighs, Jian Wushuang put the stone staff into the Interspatial Ring before flipped his hand again—revealing two special item types.

They were a few golden beads and a token.

Jian Wushuang recognized the golden beads at a glance. It was the Soul Golden Bead. The golden beads were filled with a lot of soul power. He could sense the soul power contained within was impure. There was a lot of resentment within to be precise. It was not surprising as these were the souls Zhong Hun stripped from the Official Army soldiers.

“Was he not worried his state of mind would be corrupted after absorbing and refining soul power which had such huge resentment to restore his strength?” A trace of anger flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Thereafter, he tightened his grip around the golden beads and directly crushed them along with the soul power contained within.

Jian Wushuang finally looked at the token.

At first glance, the token looked ordinary and inconspicuous among the treasures found in Zhong Hun’s Interspatial Ring. Jian Wushuang only noticed it because of the unique indescribable aura it exuded.

He held the token in his hand and cautiously channeled his soul power into the token.

As soon as his soul power sipped into the token, he sensed an astounding power contained therein.

The power formed a huge but unclear human face which opened his mouth and swallowed Jian Wushuang’s soul power.

Jian Wushuang was greatly startled.

“Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect?” His pupils narrowed slightly.

Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect was the message he received from the human face after it swallowed his soul power.

The token must be related to the Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect.

“Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect? It must either be a powerful force or a sect. Judging from this token, this sect is anything but ordinary. I wonder if Zhong Hun was a member of the Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect...” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He had never heard of the Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect nor was he interested in it.

Judging from Zhong Hun’s skills and techniques, he was very likely a member of the Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect.

“It doesn’t matter where he’s from. What matters is that I’ve killed him and gotten quite a fair bit of benefits from him. That’s enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled and felt quite happy in his heart.

There was only one year away from the Star Picking Pavilion’s auction. Jian Wushuang was worried his assets were insufficient to buy The Stately Painting from the auction. It was fortunate that Zhong Hun came.

He had gained resources and treasures worth about 15,000,000 Primordial Stones as well as the three precious Heavenly Treasures from Zhong Hun. Adding the Divine Destructive Beast Secret Technique he got from San Shouwang, he finally had a substantial amount of wealth to bid at the auction with confidence.

After killing Zhong Hun, Jian Wushuang had no reason to stay in the forest, hence he returned to the military camp.

Xiao Tiexin, Cang Heng, Mo Shan, and the others greeted him upon his return.

“Master, are you okay?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“I’m alright.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

“Territorial Lord, have you found that demon?” Mo Shan asked.

“I found and killed him,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“Killed?” Mo Shan and the others were startled.

All of them had dealt with the demon before and he was known to be powerful with despicable means. In addition, the demon’s strength must have improved by leaps and bounds after killing so many soldiers and absorbing their soul power according to Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang was the Territorial Lord, he was merely an Earth Ultimate God. All of them thought it would be good if Jian Wushuang could defeat the demon and rid him from the Northern Darkstar Territory. Surprisingly, Jian Wushuang had beheaded and killed the demon!

Was he really beheaded and killed?

Many people, especially those experts from Qinhuo Wilderness were not entirely convinced.

Jian Wushuang of course knew what was on their minds, judging from their expression change. He immediately flipped his hand and a dark spear appeared in his hand.

“Mo Shan, your two battalions fought with the demon before so you should be familiar with the weapon he used. Is this the weapon that the demon used?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Mo Shan was startled before he nodded incessantly while staring at the black spear. “Yes, it’s his spear. The breath of aura is the same as the divine weapon used by that demon.”

“He’s really killed?”

The soldiers as well as those powerful experts from Qinhuo Wilderness were overjoyed and were completely convinced.

If the Territorial Lord had that divine weapon, the demon must have been killed by the Territorial Lord.

“All hail Territorial Lord!”

“Territorial Lord, thank you for solving this crisis for Qinhuo Wilderness. All the sects and cultivators in Qinhuo Wilderness are truly grateful.”

Voices of awe and gratitude sounded one after another.

Jian Wushuang did not pay much attention to them.

“Mo Shan, you should stay and sort out the aftermath. Xin’er and Cang Heng, let’s go back.”

Jian Wushuang waved his sleeve and was already on his way toward the Territorial Lord Mansion.
