Chapter 1279: Sneak Attack!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He only knew that the Blood Mountain Sword needed to merge with unique skills to enhance its power, but he did not expect that the Blood Mountain Sword had such a high fusion requirement.

“It means that the power of the Blood Mountain Sword can’t soar in a short period of time,”?Jian Wushuang said inwardly.

He had just created an advanced rank one skill, so he did not know when he would be able to create a superior rank one skill, let alone create a supreme one.

“Take it slow,” Gu King said.

“You have to go step by step, Jian Wushuang. You still have not cultivated for very long, so you have more room for growth. Don’t worry.”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

At this point…

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“What’s wrong?” asked Gu King.

“A powerful aura has broken into the scope of my Soul Power, and this aura is very strange. It’s obviously not from any Universe Gods of our Scarlet Island,” Jian Wushuan responded in a low voice.

Everyone from Scarlet Island possessed the aura from their ID tokens, but Jian Wushuang had not sensed this kind of aura before. Naturally, whoever was coming was not from the island.

“What a nice concealment skill! The intruder was trespassing on our Scarlet Island, but none of the Universe Gods discovered it. If I didn’t possess the Soul Power, I’m afraid I that would not have sensed it either.” Jian Wushuang sighed. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No, this intruder is coming after me!”

Jian Wushuang sensed that the aura’s owner had quietly accelerated and was rushing in his direction.

However, the experts from Scarlet Island had not discovered anyone breaking into the island.

“Jian Wushuang, run!” Gu King shouted.

“I understand.”

Jian Wushuang wore a solemn expression while dashing out and shouting, “Commander, come and help!”

It sounded harsh in the silent night.

The military camp of Scarlet Island was shaken by this scream.

Jian Wushuang had displayed the Dragon Blood Secret Skill, causing his speed to burst out. Now, he was fleeing in the direction of Commander Man Yi.

At the sight of this, the intruder in a golden robe frowned. “The boy has sensed my arrival?”

After he realized that he had been exposed, the intruder turned into a Flowing Light and started chasing after Jian Wushuang at full speed.

Jian Wushuang tried his best to run, but the golden Flowing Light was approaching him at an astonishing speed.

“Blaze Quicksand Realm, come out!”

Jian Wushuang immediately took out the Blaze Quicksand Gourd. The endless Blaze Quicksand swept out, flooding the sky, and formed a vast realm to oppress the golden Flowing Light. He thought that it would create some obstacles for the intruder.

But in fact, the Blaze Quicksand Realm did not work on the golden Flowing Light.

“So fast! And… brilliant strength!” Jian Wushuang was terrified.

He realized that his opponent was a powerful Second Heaven Universe God; otherwise, the Blaze Quicksand Realm would have had some influence on his opponent.

“Swoosh! Swoosh!”

The two figures flew swiftly across the sky, which was particularly dazzling in the dark night.

However, it only lasted for a breath’s worth of time before the intruder suddenly stopped.

Commander Man Yi and four Universe Gods of Scarlet Island had arrived, while the former had already blocked the intruder.

“Buzz!”

As the golden Flowing Light dissipated, a golden-robed figure slowly emerged.

It was a skinny elder with blond hair. He looked weak, but with endless cold light in this eyes, he was radiating a powerful aura that was superior to Commander Man Yi’s.

Commander Man Yi was second only to the Lord of Scarlet Island. He was also a Second Heaven Universe God, but he could not match this skinny elder.

“Golden-sun Sect Master!

“You came here!”

Commander Man Yi stared at the skinny elder with a blaze of fury in his eyes.

With grim faces, the other four Universe Gods also considered the elder.

If any other expert unscrupulously intruded into their military camp, they would have definitely killed him without saying a word, but this intruder was the Master of the Golden-sun Sect!

The Master of the Golden-sun Sect was a Superior Second Heaven Universe God.

Even if Commander Man Yi and the other four Universe Gods worked together, they could barely compete with him.

And naturally, it was impossible to kill him.

Therefore, Commander Man Yi knew that he was unable to fight against him.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

“This man is the Golden-sun Sect Master?

“He tried to assassinate me in such a shameful way?”

It sent a chill down Jian Wushuang’s spine.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had ignited the Soul Fire, and his Soul Power was amazing, so he had discovered his arrival in advance.

Otherwise, he would have already been killed.

After all, he only had the battle strength of an Advanced First Heaven Universe God. Even if he exerted his full strength to display Stars, he would be able to fight against a Superior First Heaven Universe God, at most.

His strength was nothing when compared with the Golden-sun Sect Master.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang immediately figured out why the Golden-sun Sect Master had come.

“For the monarch of the Jin Kingdom?”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.
