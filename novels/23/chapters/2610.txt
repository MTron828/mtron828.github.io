Chapter 2611: Big Problem

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A Grand Ultimate God was just too rarely seen!

If any of the top powers have even ten Grand Ultimate Gods, it was considered very impressive. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Each of those Grand Ultimate Gods was also the top powers’ main support pillars as they possessed the highest battle strength level. Losing even a single one of them was an unimaginably huge loss.

At the same time, it could bring them up a level if they could have one more Grand Ultimate God.

Therefore, the Huangji Golden Pill which offered a Peak Heaven Ultimate God a 50% chance to make a breakthrough into Grand Ultimate God was extremely important to them.

The auction for the Huangji Golden Pill soon began.

The starting bid itself was already 1,000,000,000 Primordial Stones. In a very short period, the price had gone up to 2,000,000,000 which was double the starting bid.

Moreover, the experts in the third floor individual rooms—especially those who were representing the top powers—had been competing with each other fiercely, hence the price continued to climb.

“This is insane!”

“That’s too crazy. It’s already thirty billion Primordial Stones and yet they continue to bid?”

“Thirty billion is an unimaginable number for me.”

Waves of exclamations were filling the auction house.

As time flew by, the Huangji Golden Pill’s price had climbed up to an astronomical 50,000,000,000.

At that rate, there were not many left who could continue bidding. In the end, it was again the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace and the beautiful lady from Dongfang Clan who competed against each other.

The beautiful lady coldly asked, “How many resources can we move around?”

“We only have fifty-two billion Primordial Stones when adding on to the amount the clan had temporarily transferred to us with what we have now. That’s everything we can gather in such a short time,” said one of the Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Fifty-two billion!!”

The beautiful lady made her final bid without hesitation.

At that moment, Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master wore a dark expression as he was also calculating the number of resources he could control. “Fortunately, I’ve found quite a bit of stuff at the ruins. Even though I have spent quite a lot on the Stately Painting, I could still outbid the Dongfang Clan woman with the remaining sixty billion or so when adding on to my properties and the resources that were prepared beforehand by the palace.”

“Fifty-three billion!!”

As the Young Palace Master made his bid again, the Dongfang Clan’s room turned silent.

“Not competing anymore?” The Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace shot a cold glance at Dongfang Clan’s room.

“Hmph.” A cold harrumph came out of that individual room. “You truly are the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace to bring so many resources with you. You win this time, but don’t get cocky now as even though you spent an incredible amount on this Huangji Golden Pill, it’s still a question whether you safely can bring it back to Nanwu Palace.”

“Oh, are you trying to scare me, Madam Dongfang?” Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master coldly said.

“I’m not trying to scare you of course. After all, how many in the Danyang Holy Domain can really scare the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace? However, Huangji Golden Pill is such a precious item, and many desperately desire it. I’m merely reminding you out of kindness due to the friendship between the Dongfang Clan and Nanwu Palace. I have no desire to worry about the rest, so take care.”

As the beautiful lady finished speaking, she stood up and started leaving the room.

The auction for the last star treasure had ended which indicated the end of the auction event. Naturally, the beautiful lady had no reason to continue staying there.

Not only her but also most of those experts who took part in the auction left with sighs and feelings of loss.

Of course, several experts did not immediately leave.

Especially those in the third-floor individual rooms, most of those powerful Heaven Ultimate Gods did not immediately leave.

Although they were staying inside their respective rooms, their eyes were burning with greed while staring at Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master’s room.

The Young Palace Master and the beautiful lady of Dongfang Clan did not hide their identity when competing at all. Everyone also knew that two of the three treasure stars had fallen into the Young Palace Master’s hands and the star treasures were very attractive to those Heaven Ultimate Gods, especially the Huangji Golden Pill.

“That’s a big problem.”

Jian Wushuang was still staying in his room and began to frown.

Although he could not see the facial expressions of the Heaven Ultimate Gods on the third floor, he could guess what was running through their minds.

A Huangji Golden Pill was enough for them to go insane and do whatever it takes to obtain it.

Although the Huangji Golden Pill was in the hands of the Young Palace Master, his strong family background and those few Heaven Ultimate Gods around him could not fend away the experts who were drooling over the pill.

In other words, he had become everyone’s target!!

He would be fine as long as he stayed inside the Star Picking Pavilion. However, as soon as he left their place... Just like what the beautiful lady from Dongfang Clan said—although he had obtained the Huangji Golden Pill, it was questionable whether he could safely bring it back to Nanwu Palace.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had not much interest in the Huangji Golden Pill even though it was very valuable. The only item he wanted was the Stately Painting.

Earlier, he was the only one targeting Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master and was already not confident about taking the Stately Painting from him. However, his problem just grew even bigger since so many people were targeting Young Palace Master at that point!!

“Well, looks I’ll have to play by ear.” Jian Wushuang squinted slightly.

...

In Nanwu Palace’s room on the third floor.

“Young Palace Master, we’ve brought the Stately Painting and Huangji Golden Pill over.” The Golden Chief who hosted the auction personally presented the two treasures to the Young Palace Master.

The Young Palace Master simply took a glance at it and immediately passed an Interspatial Ring he had prepared earlier to the Golden Chief.

Following the successful transaction, both treasures were in the Young Palace Master’s possession without ordeal.

“The treasures are at hand, but to leave this place and return safely to Nanwu Palace will be quite a challenge.” The Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace frowned. “It will be a breeze if they are only ordinary treasures. Even if they are more valuable ones, those Heaven Ultimate God won’t have the guts to come at me for that treasure. However, the Huangji Golden Pill is different as it’s sufficient to make any Heaven Ultimate God go crazy!

“There should be quite a few Heaven Ultimate Gods taking part in the auction and all of them know that Huangji Golden Pill is in my possession. I’m afraid a siege is inevitable as soon as I leave this place...”
