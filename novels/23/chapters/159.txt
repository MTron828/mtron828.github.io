Chapter 160: Fierce Fight

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After Ling Xue’er left, the other two experts looked at each other and then left as well.

None of them had the confidence to face this Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard in the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

On the entire mountain top, Jian Wushuang was the only one who stayed to fight with this Demonic Cloud Leopard.

“During two years of earnest cultivation in the Sword Tomb, my strength improved a lot. However, I have not used my full strength in a fight since I left the Sword Tomb. But this Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard...”?Glancing at the animal in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shined with battle intent.

Indeed, since he left the Sword Tomb, he fought several times, but none of them were fierce battles. The opponents were too weak to be his match.

The slaughter in Clearwater Stronghold was a good example. While facing two purple-masked assassins, he easily killed one of them.

When he challenged the Heavenly Palace, he did his utmost, but the opponents were just puppets. Their strength was only enough to hold him back, not enough to be considered a life and death battle.

Up til now, he had not experienced a truly fierce fight!

Only a truly fierce battle would help him fully digest the progress he made in the Sword Tomb over the past two years.

This Three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard, which possessed battle strength close to the Profound Yin Void Realm, was completely capable of challenging him.

“Come on.” With a monstrous battle intent, Jian Wushuang’s body flashed like a flowing light and rushed forward like a sharp sword.

“Human!” Demonic Cloud Leopard’s eyes were blood-red and surging with potent killing intent.

Being a spirit beast in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, its intelligence was the same as a human. When the human expert captured it, it was told that it could live as long as it survived for seven days.

As a spirit beast, it’s survival instinct was very strong.

“Go to hell!”

With a roar, the Demonic Cloud Leopard suddenly rushed forward with a speed that was even a bit faster than Jian Wushuang. It instantly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, waving its sharp claws towards him.

These claws seemed as if they could tear apart the world.

Jian Wushuang simultaneously released the Fiery Wind Sword Essence. The Triple-kill Sword suddenly rushed forward like a vast fire dragon.

The Eighth Move of the Formless Sword Art!

Jian Wushuang used this move with his full power.

Bang!

Soon after a deep collision was heard and the Demonic Cloud Leopard immediately retreated.

“In terms of pure power, I am stronger!” Jian Wushuang smiled and muttered.

He possessed a Supreme Gold Core, so even in the Profound Gold Core Realm, his power was able to reach a whole new level. But the key reason was his Sword Art. Using the Fiery Wind Sword Essence with the Formless Sword Art greatly enhanced his power. His strength was even greater than the Demonic Cloud Leopard.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang displayed his second move, slashing out with the Triple-kill Sword again. He used the Eighth Move of the Formless Sword Art once more.

But Demonic Cloud Leopard wasn’t stupid. It knew it could not win based on strength, so it aimed to win with its speed. With a dash, the beast evaded Jian Wushuang’s attack. All four legs kicked against the ground as it opened its mouth and revealed its cold teeth, directly pouncing towards Jian Wushuang’s head.

This was exactly how the previous Earthly Dragon List expert died while fighting with the Demonic Cloud Leopard.

Jian Wushuang did not panic at all. He immediately turned the Fiery Wind Sword Essence into Earth Sword Essence. Demonstrating the Reincarnation Sword Skill, his Long Sword directly blocked the Demonic Cloud Leopard as it closed in and prepared to pounce.

Bang!

With this collision, both Jian Wushuang and the Demonic Cloud Leopard retreated backwards.

“This Demonic Cloud Leopard moves pretty fast, and it’s very flexible,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“This human...” Obviously, the Demonic Cloud Leopard noticed that Jian Wushuang was much stronger than the person he just killed.

After a short pause, they fiercely attacked again.

As this was happening, it was all being watched by the experts gathered in the air above the Cloud mountain range.

“What is that young man, Jian Wushuang, doing? Is he really fighting with the Demonic Cloud Leopard?”

“Stupid, really stupid. It’s not easy to kill a three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard! He should leave that mountain and fight the other spirit beasts rather than wasting time fighting with this Demonic Cloud Leopard. The other beasts are much easier.”

“Exactly. It’s stupid to fight with the Demonic Cloud Leopard. Ling Xue’er was smart. She chose to leave and immediately went to another mountain. She understood it’s not easy to deal with this Demonic Cloud Leopard. The spirit beasts in the mountain she went to have ordinary strength. Plus, she is the strongest expert there, so she has a very good chance of getting a core.”

“Ha-ha, he is not even scared of Xue Yun, not to mention this Demonic Cloud Leopard!”

“A silly boy!”

“What an impetuous person!”

The peak experts were wantonly talking and laughing. The two Palace Masters of Dragon Palace, who were among them, wore sullen faces after hearing what they said.

“What is he doing? Why not just leave and go kill other spirit beasts?” Palace Master White said and frowned.

Among the peak experts, only one person understood Jian Wushuang’s purpose.

He was Di Xi.

“Is this little guy training himself? Using this three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard to train?”

Training!

Yes, he was training!

It’s been more than two years since Jian Wushuang took part in a fierce battle.

The reason he fought with the three-striped Demonic Cloud Leopard was not because he was silly or impulsive.

He had his own purpose, which was to experience a fierce battle!

He was eager for an intense fight!

At the same time, during this fast-paced battle, he was gradually digesting the great progress he made over the last two years.

Jian Wushuang and the Demonic Cloud Leopard had been fighting for a long time on the mountaintop.

“Good! This feels so good!”

Sweat ran from Jian Wushuang’s forehead, but he was getting excited.

“I have not been this satisfied for a long time. The opponent is just a spirit beast, but my whole body feels comfortable. But this is enough.”?Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the Demonic Cloud Leopard.

The Demonic Cloud Leopard had erupted with its full strength in this fight just now.

But Jian Wushuang had only displayed the Fiery Wind Sword Essence and Earth Sword Essence. The former was used to attack and the latter for defense. Offense and defense combined without leaving any flaws. However... he never displayed the Waterdrop Sword Essence during the fight.

“It’s time to end this.”

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang violently stabbed out with his longsword again.

But as the sword light rushed forward this time, what it contained was not the monstrous Fiery Wind Sword Essence, but torrential Waterdrop Sword Essence.

Suddenly, the sword light glided through the air like a mist, leaving a peculiar wave rippling in the air.

The Demonic Cloud Leopard immediately felt the sword essence surging towards it like the tide, from all directions Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It slashed out with its claws, continually swinging and tearing, trying to escape from this flowing sword essence. However, the more it struggled, the deeper it sank.
