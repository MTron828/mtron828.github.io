Chapter 2549: The Brazen Jian Yi

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After Jian Wushuang left, the Ye Clan Elders quickly leaned in to learn what happened from the Clan Leader.

The purple-haired old man asked, “What happened in the Golden Prison?”

“What happened? Haha, it’s nothing. Jian Yi never wanted to be our enemy and we naturally don’t want to be against him either. If that’s the case why not just make peace?” Ye Dingshan explained and smiled.

The purple-haired old man frowned and regretfully said in a low voice, “But fifty thousand Primordial Stones... It’s all because of my rebellious son. We wouldn’t be in this mess today if he hadn’t rubbed Jian Yi wrongly!”

“No, today’s incident isn’t entirely your son’s fault. If I’m not mistaken, Jian Yi probably is just after Primordial Stones. He used Ye Ming as an excuse to get what he wanted. I’m sure he’ll come up with something else even if Ye Ming isn’t involved,” said Ye Dingshan.

“Excuse me?” The Ye Clan members were surprised.

“He deliberately came to us, flexed his power, and showed us his capabilities before gracefully retreating for those Primordial Stones. By doing so, we won’t be embarrassed and he’ll get what he wanted as compensation,” said Ye Dingshan.

“He’s so brazen,” exclaimed the purple-haired old man.

“He’s indeed brazen or perhaps he badly needed Primordial Stones and had to use such methods. Experts like him have many ways to get Primordial Stones after all. Although he blatantly did this to us, it’s better than battling it out with him. Moreover, we can afford the fifty thousand Primordial Stones. Just considered it a gift to establish new friendships.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After explaining the situation, Ye Dingshan was no longer interested in staying with the Ye Clan Elders. He turned around before going back to his retreat.

The Ye Clan’s Elders and experts agreed with Ye Dingshan.

However, they had no idea there was an undisclosed reason why Ye Dingshan agreed to give Jian Wushuang the 50,000 Primordial Stones and acted so politely toward him.

It was because Jian Wushuang gave him face and also saved the Ye Clan’s dignity.

No one was able to see what happened earlier in the Golden Prison where he dueled with Jian Wushuang. Once the Golden Prison disappeared, Jian Wushuang openly lauded his capabilities so that everyone thought Jian Wushuang had lost the battle.

However, it was Ye Dingshan who was disadvantaged inside the Golden Prison!

The moment they were trapped in the Golden Prison, a golden armor appeared on Jian Wushuang’s body which amplified his overall strength by nearly three times!

Coupled with his outstanding sword skills, Jian Wushuang had Ye Dingshan completely under his control.

Ye Dingshan knew he was going to be defeated for sure.

Who would have thought Jian Wushuang removed the Golden Prison and declared his defeat in front of everyone to save Ye Dingshan’s face?

Ye Dingshan was fast witted and instantly knew what Jian Wushuang was up to.

Thereafter, he chose to go along with Jian Wushuang and save himself along with the Ye Clan from being embarrassed.

As for those 50,000 Primordial Stones, they were nothing compared to his and the Ye Clan’s dignity.

...

Jian Wushuang reunited with Xiao Tiexin in the tavern.

“What happened?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

Jian Wushuang triumphantly said, “I’ve got fifty thousand Primordial Stones in hand.”

“Fifty thousand?” Xiao Tiexin’s eyes lit up. “They agreed?”

“Well, they had no choice.” Jian Wushuang grinned.

Jian Wushuang may have openly admitted his defeat but what happened in the Golden Prison was him badly beating Ye Dingshan up.

Ye Dingshan knew Jian Wushuang’s capabilities. Besides, Jian Wushuang was only asking for 50,000 Primordial Stones which the Ye Clan could still afford.

“Although Ye Dingshan is a Peak Ultimate God, he’s probably of a lower-ranked level. I’m unable to compete with him without the Nine Sparkle Star Armor but he didn’t stand a chance once I used the armor.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“This Interspatial Ring is for you.” Jian Wushuang threw a ring to the thin man beside him.

This thin man was the one who earlier acted as Jian Wushuang’s disciple. His eyes lit up with joy after taking the Interspatial Ring and peered into it. “Thank you, Master. This is my Message Token. Please contact me if you need me for anything in the future.”

The thin man left after putting down his Message Token.

“Why do you let him go now? Aren’t you going to find fault with other clans?” Xiao Tiexin looked over quizzically.

“Never repeat the same trick twice. It’ll be dubious if I repeated the same thing. Besides, I can come up with lots of excuses for my next target.” Jian Wushuang smiled mischievously. “By the way, which clan should I target next?”

“The Jiang Clan is a mid-tier clan whose strength is similar to the Ye Clan. Although the Jiang Clan Leader is slightly stronger than Ye Dingshan it’s not by much,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Let’s go for Jiang Clan then.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

He went with Xiao Tiexin to nettle with the Jiang Clan soon after.

...

In the Shi Clan’s Grand Hall.

Shi Qianhan, the Shi Clan Leader was discussing some matters with several Elders.

Suddenly, an old man in black walked in.

“I’ve just got the news that Jian Yi received fifty thousand Primordial Stones from the Huo Clan,” said the old man in black.

“Jian Yi made his move.” Shi Qianhan smiled coldly when he got the news. “He went to the Ye Clan first followed by the Jiang Clan and made up excuses to extort Primordial Stones from both of them. What excuse did he make up for the Huo Clan?”

The old man in black said, “His excuse is so ridiculous. Jian Yi went to the Huo Clan and claimed that Huo Yiming tried to kill him many years ago and he’s here to seek revenge.”

“Huo Yiming? Who’s that?” Shi Qianhan asked.

“He’s a Primary-Level Ultimate God from the Huo Clan who was killed in a battle a few hundred years ago,” said the old man in black.

A Shi Clan Elder exclaimed, “Oh my! He even used a dead person as an excuse. Why is he so brazen?”

“Indeed, he’s quite shameless to have done that. There is no way to seek clarification when a person is dead after all. He can claim whatever he wants yet the Huo Clan is unable to refute him. In the end, the Huo Clan has no choice but to give him fifty thousand Primordial Stones to settle the issue. He’s also being rather thoughtful and didn’t cause a scene at the Huo Clan’s Mansion,” said the old man in black.
