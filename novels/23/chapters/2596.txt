Chapter 2597: Peak Ultimate God

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Not only are they extremely polite to me, but they must also have an extraordinary background. Although they are reluctant to reveal their sect, they can produce three Divine Elixir Pills at will with no sweat. Their background is indeed unusual!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

The three Divine Elixir Pills were worth 15,000,000 Primordial Stones.

Such a large amount of wealth was substantial even to ordinary Heaven Ultimate Gods from an impressive background.

However, the two of them were unfazed.

It was as though those three Divine Elixir Pills were nothing to them.

Someone so generous must be from a spectacular background.

“That token is useless to me anyway and I’m not interested in figuring out the token’s secrets as I’ve already made a lot of money in exchange for bagging those three Divine Elixir Pills.” Jian Wushuang smiled secretly.

Those three Divine Elixir Pills happened to be of great use to him at that time.

Jian Wushuang immediately returned to the underground palace and began his seclusion once again.

...

In the void not far from the Territorial Lord Mansion, Su Qin and Liu Xian’er were walking side by side.

“Senior Brother, I don’t understand. Why did you need to give him three Divine Elixir Pills for the token? Although those three Divine Elixir Pills are nothing to us, it’s a waste for you to do that. I’m sure the Territorial Lord would’ve handed the token to you nonetheless even if you gave him nothing in return,” said Liu Xian’er.

“This token is of no use to him and will merely keep it in the Interspatial Ring. It’s better to give it to us as a favor, but...Junior Sister, I told you before that the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is not someone to be trifled since he’s able to kill Zhong Hun.” Su Qin smiled.

“Why can’t I see that he’s extraordinary? I think he just got lucky. We’re kind enough to not ask him for all the treasures left behind by Zhong Hun and instead only asked only for the token.” Liu Xian’er pouted.

Su Qin did not reply immediately. He stopped dead in his tracks at the void before raising his palm.

There was a pea-sized golden beetle in the center of his palm. Some faint blood streaks pattern could be seen on the Golden Beetle’s elytra.

“Why did you bring Goldie out?” Liu Xian’er glanced at the golden beetle confusingly and asked Su Qin.

“Didn’t you say that you can’t tell if the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is extraordinary? Goldie could see it.” Su Qin smiled before continuing, “You know Goldie can recognize and distinguish various beings in the Ancient God Domain. There are many special ethnic groups and lifeforms in the Ancient God Domain including human cultivators—each having different life ratings. No matter how the other party tries to stay under the radar, Goldie could easily sense the other party’s life rating as long as it’s nearby.”

Liu Xian’er said, “Oh really? Goldie is just next to the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. Could it sense he has an impressive life rating? Is he not just a human cultivator?”

“No, Goldie was unable to sense it. It was just right next to the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, yet it sensed nothing. This was the reason I’ve said the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord must be unusually powerful,” explained Su Qin.

Liu Xian’er was startled.

She knew of Goldie’s ability.

There were all kinds of special ethics and beings in the world. There were very few among them which Goldie was unable to sense their life rating.

The two of them had never seen it happen.

“Could that Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord be a special being?” Liu Xian’er asked instinctively.

“I don’t know and it’s not convenient for us to ask him either. Anyways, we shouldn’t look down upon someone like him. It’s the reason I took out three Divine Elixir Pills to exchange the token with him. I want him to be happy or even grateful to us. There might be a chance for us to grow closer if we have an opportunity to meet again in the future,” said Su Qin with a smile.

Those three Divine Elixir Pills were nothing to them. It was certainly a good bargain to use them in exchange for a good relationship with someone having an impressive life rating.

“Let’s go. We’ve settled Zhong Hun and next is the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s matter,” urged Su Qin.

“That’s not something urgent. I want to go explore around here since we are outside the sect,” said Liu Xian’er.

Su Qin smiled and did not object to the idea as the two continued to walk around and soon disappeared into the void.

...

In the underground palace, a thick divine power erupted from his body as Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged.

“My divine power has reached the very limits of High-level Ultimate God and there’s nothing more I can do to improve. I shall accumulate a huge gush of divine power and aim for a breakthrough. These three Divine Elixir Pills...” Jian Wushuang looked at the three Divine Elixir Pills in front of him.

Next, he grabbed one of the elixir pills and swallowed it.

As soon as the Divine Elixir Pill entered his body, it immediately turned into a vast divine power. The most important part was the extremely pure divine power within!

“Its divine power is a hundred or even a thousand times purer than the Primordial Stone’s divine power. It’s an entirely two different concepts.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glimmering with excitement.

The pure divine power in his body slowly gathered in front of the heavy barrier. As long as he made a mental move, he could try to fire on the heavy barrier.

“Although the divine power in a single Divine Elixir Pill was able to shake the barrier, I feel it’s still lacking in power to completely smash the barrier,” muttered Jian Wushuang before he immediately reached out, grabbed another Divine Elixir Pill, and directly swallowed it.

Another pill went into his body. The same vast and pure divine power emerged as it integrated with the earlier formed divine power.

“It’s almost there. Let’s start.” Jian Wushuang’s hands tensed up.

In his body, the vast and pure divine power accumulated in front of the heavy barrier and instantly turned into a huge charging torrent.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Several bombardments took place which shook Jian Wushuang up with each collision.

After more than a dozen bombardments, almost half of the pure divine power from both Divine Elixir Pills were consumed and a faint crack finally appeared on the heavy barrier. Jian Wushuang was ecstatic with the crack’s appearance.

Boom! Boom!

Two more extremely strong bombardments occurred. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Finally, the heavy barrier was destroyed as his divine power soared.

In just a few moments, his divine power and divine body were promoted to a new level.

“Finally, Peak Ultimate God!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes. There was a deep twinkle in his eyes and a smile suddenly cracked on his face.
