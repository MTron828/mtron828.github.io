4237 Snake Slaying (Part Eight)

“It’s a pity for the Blood Sword. It took me so much effort to severely injure Heavenly Snake Playboy and kill him. But now, because of this idiot, Heavenly Snake Playboy has recovered.”

“The Blood Sword is in danger.”

The spectators looked at Jian Wushuang and shook their heads with a sigh.

“Jiuxi Holy Land, I, Hao Jin, won’t rest until you’re dead!”

!!

“Die!” Ruler Hao Jin’s eyes almost popped out of his head as he charged toward the Jiuxi disciples!

On the other side.

Heavenly Snake Playboy’s snake tail swung again and he swallowed Divine Lord Tiancang.

In an instant, the huge wound on Heavenly Snake Playboy’s body that was cut by Jian Wushuang’s star-slashing sword rainbow began to recover. In just a few breaths, it was completely healed.

“Hiss hiss hiss…”

Heavenly Snake Playboy slowly raised his head and let out a cold smile.

“Blood Sword, it seems like even the heavens don’t want me to die.” He looked at Jian Wushuang and said sarcastically.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and he replied indifferently, “If I can kill you once, I can kill you a second time.”

“Is that so?”

Heavenly Snake Playboy chuckled without a care.

The next moment!

“Blood Sword, you should die!!!”

His face suddenly became distorted and his huge golden vertical pupils were filled with ruthlessness and madness. He bounced up from the ground again and shot toward Jian Wushuang.

“You’re the one who should die!”

Jian Wushuang snorted coldly with an expressionless face. He lowered his head to look at the black spot on the Wuqi Divine Sword that had been scalded by the venom. With a flip of his right hand, he put the Wuqi Divine Sword back into his Interspatial Ring.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and his expression became calm. He closed his eyes and slowly said, “Divine body, appear.”

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s body emitted a sound similar to frying beans.

A wave of energy that came from the deepest part of his soul and the deepest part of his perfect life form began to gush out!

Under this power, his divine body started to grow.

One miles…two miles…three miles…

Ten thousand miles…thirty thousand miles…sixty thousand miles…

At this moment.

Everyone’s face froze and their eyes widened in disbelief.

An unimaginable giant, tens of thousands of miles tall and surrounded by endless immortal radiance, appeared in front of Heavenly Snake Playboy.

His face was surrounded by chaos, only revealing a trace of his appearance. He looked exactly the same as Jian Wushuang. His power was indescribable and powerful beyond comprehension. It was as if he could break the universe with a raise of his hand and destroy the earth with a step. Heavenly Snake Playboy, who was originally huge, was like an ant under the feet of the giant.

Under countless shocked gazes, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes. Two bolts of lightning flashed across his eyes.

Other than having divine power and a soul that far surpassed cultivators of the same realm, special creatures also had a divine body at its strongest state!

This was the first time Jian Wushuang had revealed his divine body to the world!

The entire Eighth City was shocked!

What is this?!!

Heavenly Snake Playboy’s speed came to a sudden halt. He raised his head and looked at the giant surrounded by countless immortal light, and his golden vertical pupils shrank.

A cold Qi rushed to his head!

For the first time, Heavenly Snake Playboy felt fear in his heart.

“Retreat!”

Heavenly Snake Playboy’s eyes flickered. He was uncertain about the giant who had transformed into Jian Wushuang’s divine body. He immediately made a decision to avoid the sharp edge first.

In an instant, Heavenly Snake Playboy was about to shoot into the distance.

Looking at Heavenly Snake Playboy who was far away, Jian Wushuang’s expression did not change at all and he spoke calmly.

“Suppress!”

In an instant, Jian Wushuang was like a god who controlled the life and death of the world and set the law. An indescribable divine power gathered in Jian Wushuang’s giant hand and pressed down on Heavenly Snake Playboy.

Boom!

No words could describe the horror of this palm.

The entire world was covered by a giant palm. There was no light, no earth, and no sky.

Under this palm, Heavenly Snake Playboy seemed to have turned into a small snake that was at the mercy of others and was suppressed by Jian Wushuang’s hand!

“Roar roar roar!”

Heavenly Snake Playboy screamed and howled. However, no matter how he struggled, he could not move at all, as if he was being pressed down by a million mountains!

The sharp and fierce sword essence was activated by Jian Wushuang. It exploded between his five fingers and bombarded Heavenly Snake Playboy continuously.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Heavenly Snake Playboy’s snake body kept exploding, condensing, and exploding again. This process was repeated thousands of times.

As Heavenly Snake Playboy let out a shrill roar, everyone was shocked to see this scene. They felt a chill down their spine as if they had fallen into an ice cellar.

“This is too terrifying!” Countless people’s lips trembled as they spoke.

After a while.

When Jian Wushuang raised his palm again, it had already turned into nothingness.

Heavenly Snake Playboy had been completely annihilated. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Kacha kacha kacha.

Jian Wushuang’s 68000-mile-long divine body gradually shrank and returned to normal after a while.

At that moment, the entire Eighth City fell into a deathly silence. It was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

No one was discussing it, and no one made a sound.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang and they were all shocked.

Until now, their minds were still filled with Jian Wushuang’s indomitable and 68000-mile divine body.

The same thought appeared in their minds at the same time.

‘I want to compete with the heavens!’

…

After returning to his normal form, Jian Wushuang’s aura was extremely weak and he almost fell from the sky.

“The price of using the divine body once is too great.”

Jian Wushuang laughed bitterly. Outsiders only thought that he had killed Heavenly Snake Playboy with a flip of his hand. Only he knew how much he had paid.

At this moment, his divine power was almost completely exhausted, and his entire body was in pain as if it had been stabbed by needles. His divine body was on the verge of exploding.

“But it’s good, it’s not like I didn’t gain anything.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and turned his head to look at the place where Heavenly Snake Playboy had died.

He saw two sharp fangs and an Interspatial Ring floating in the air.

Drops of pitch-black venom dripped down the fangs, corroding the ground and creating huge pits.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took the two poisonous fangs and Heavenly Snake Playboy’s Interspatial Ring.

Then, Jian Wushuang took out a few divine herbs from his Interspatial Ring that could quickly replenish divine power. He sat down cross-legged to recover his divine power.

Each of these divine herbs was extremely precious. However, to Jian Wushuang, who had obtained the complete treasures of the Tarot Ruins, they were nothing.

When his divine power had recovered slightly, Jian Wushuang stood up and walked toward the crowd.

in an instant, everyone automatically made way for him and looked at Jian Wushuang with extreme respect.

Jian Wushuang walked past them slowly and finally stopped in front of the Jiuxi Holy Land disciples.

It was time to settle some scores.

“Sir Blood Sword.”

Jiuxi had a complicated expression on her face as she called out softly.
