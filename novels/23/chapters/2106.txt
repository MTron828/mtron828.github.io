Chapter 2107 Interest in Jian Wushuang

Jian Wushuang Purposely Repaired the Seals Around the Palace and Sent Experts to Protect the Area. He Also Placed an Order to Kill Anyone Who Tried to Break Into the Palace. This Was to Create the Illusion That the Soul Swallowing Pearl Was Still Within the Palace in Order to Bluff Acheron Palace.

This Would Misdirect Them Into Thinking That Jian Wushuang Could Not Refine the Pearl Even After Trying for a Period of Time.

King Zhan Cang Set Out to Execute His Orders.

Jian Wushuang Walked Out of the Palace.

‚ÄúAncient God Emperor!‚Äù the Black Dragon Emperor Called Out as She Flew Toward Him.

‚ÄúBlack Dragon Emperor.‚Äù Jian Wushuang Smiled.

‚ÄúAncient God Emperor, You Finally Left the Palace. What Was the Result?‚Äù the Black Dragon Emperor Asked.

‚ÄúIt is Not Easy to Refine the Soul Swallowing Pearl.‚Äù Jian Wushuang Said Casually.

‚ÄúI See. If the Ancient God Emperor Cannot Refine It, I Think the Hopes for the Rest of Us Will Be Even Slimmer,‚Äù the Black Dragon Emperor Was Not Surprised by the Results.

Jian Wushuang Simply Smiled Before Asking, ‚ÄúBlack Dragon Emperor, is There Anything of Concern?‚Äù

‚ÄúI Want to Speak to You About Some Things Concerning the Alliance.‚Äù the Black Dragon Emperor Said Before Looking at King Chen Xing.

King Chen Xing Took the Hint and Left.

Jian Wushuang Raised His Eyebrows, but Continued With the Conversation.

Before Long, the Black Dragon Emperor Left.

Jian Wushuang Stood There, Confused. ‚ÄúWhat is Going on With the Black Dragon Emperor?‚Äô

Jian Wushuang Was Indeed Surprised.

The Black Dragon Emperor Asked Him About Some Tedious Things to Do With the Alliance. Most of Those Things Could Be Easily Settled by Any Deputy Leader, but She Had Chosen to Find Him. During the Conversation, She Asked Some Questions in a Casual Manner. n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

However, Some of Those Questions Were Personal. She Asked Whether He Had a Wife or Children.

‚ÄúAncient God Emperor.‚Äù King Chen Xing Returned to Jian Wushuang.

‚ÄúKing Chen Xing, Did You Find There to Be Something Off About Black Dragon Emperor?‚Äù Jian Wushuang Asked.

‚ÄúSomething Off? Of Course I Can Feel There is Something Off With the Black Dragon Emperor. She Came to Visit You at Least Ten Times While You Were Refining the Soul Swallowing Pearl. During That Period of Time, She Would Find Me or King Gu Tong to Ask Things About You. If I‚Äôm Not Wrong, She is Interested in You.‚Äù King Chen Xing Smiled.

‚ÄúInterested in Me?‚Äù Jian Wushuang Was Surprised. It Was Awkward.

He Hadn‚Äôt Had Much Interaction With the Black Dragon Emperor Before. He Simply Saved Her Clan During a Time of Crisis and She Had Developed Feelings for Him?

This Couldn‚Äôt Be the Case, Right?

Jian Wushuang Shook His Head and Stopped Thinking About It.

...

During the Eighteen Years Jian Wushuang Had Been in the Underground Palace Trying to Refine the Soul Swallowing Pearl, the Respective Clans Had Finished Their Preparations. Wormholes Leading to the Human Territory Were Already Set Up and All They Were Waiting for Was Jian Wushuang.

When Jian Wushuang Left the Underground Palace, He Hosted a Meeting With the Respective Leaders of the Various Clans. He Was the Alliance Leader, So He Sat Right at the Front of the Table.

The People Sitting Beside Him Were Leaders From Ancient God Clan, Black Water Dragon Clan and the God Eater Clan.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs My Pleasure Meeting You, Sir Lei Yuan and Leader Qing Xiu.‚Äù Jian Wushuang Smiled at the Two Men From the Three Top Tier Clans.

One of the Men Was Burly. He Was Covered in Animal Furs and His Defined Muscles Could Be Seen Clearly. The Power of Thunder Was Felt Around His Muscles and He Radiated a Violent Aura.

This Man Was Called Lei Yuan.

He Came From the Thunder Ape Clan. This Clan Was a Strong Clan. However, the Clan Was Destroyed a Long Time Ago by the Sky Swallowing Clan as Both Clans Were on Bad Terms.

Lei Yuan Was One of the Many Lucky Members of the Thunder Ape Clan Who Had Escaped When Their Clan Was Being Attacked by the Sky Swallowing Clan.

Back Then, Lei Yuan Had Just Been a Sir God. After All This Times and Cultivation He Had Managed to Reach the Realm of Great Emperor!

He Had Been Active Within the Sky Swallowing Clan in Recent Years and Tried to Cause Problems for the Sky Swallowing Clan. However, His Efforts Were in Vain.

Now That the Sky Swallowing Clan Was Finally Destroyed, He Had Decided to Reveal His True Identity.

The Other Elegant Man, Qing Xiu, Was Dressed in Green. He Was the Leader of the Green Leopard Clan. He Had Reached the Peak of Emperor God Many Years Ago. He Had Handed Over the Matters Within His Clan to Others and Secluded Himself Himself From the Rest of the World to Cultivate. He Had Not Been Present During the Coronation Ceremony of the New Ancient God Emperor.

Now, He Had Reappeared as a Great Emperor.

‚ÄúThis Time, We Shall Ally With the Sanctuary Alliance and Battle the Three Emperors World. I Hope Both of You Can Step in and Help When the Time Comes.‚Äù Jian Wushuang Looked at Them and Said.

‚ÄúNo Worries, Ancient God Emperor. Even Though My Clan Has Been Destroyed, I Am Still Part of This Territory and a Member of the Special Tribes Alliance. Furthermore, You Saw Through the Evil Plan of the Sky Swallowing Clan and Destroyed Them at Once. You‚Äôve Avenged My Clan for Me. I Will Remember This Favour and Put in My All for the Battles Ahead!‚Äù Lei Yuan Said.

‚Äúthe Green Leopard Clan is Part of the Special Tribes Alliance. We Will Definitely Do Our Best in the Battle,‚Äù Qing Xiu Said.

Jian Wushuang Smiled Upon Hearing This.

Qing Yuan and Lei Xiu Were the Only Two Great Emperors Within the Special Tribes Alliance Outside of the Three Top Tier Clans.

Adding Both of Them to the Total, There Were Now Eight Great Emperors in the Special Tribes Alliance: Black Dragon Emperor, Leader of God Eater Clan and Three Great Emperors From the Ancient God Clan.

As for Jian Wushuang, He Was Both a Human and the Emperor of Ancient God Clan. He Was Not Counted.

‚ÄúEveryone, I Trust That Everyone is Well Prepared Given the Amount of Time We Have. I Now Request All of You to Bring Your Clans Through the Respective Wormholes Into Human Territory and Gather the Experts From the Sanctuary Alliance!‚Äù Jian Wushuang Said Gloriously.

‚ÄúRoger!‚Äù

The Respective Leaders Roared in Reply.

The Experts From the Various Clans Started Making Their Moves.
