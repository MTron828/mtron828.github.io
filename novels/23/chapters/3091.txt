Chapter 3092: Sorcerer God

Bai Jue’s expression was extremely unsightly, and his aura was also abnormally cold.

This time, the Dao Palace had indeed suffered heavy losses.

After all, a total of three geniuses had fallen. These three geniuses were all very outstanding. Although the chances of becoming the Principles Master in the future were very low, the chances of becoming a top-notch immortal saint were still very high, they might even become invincible amongst the Immortal Saints.

Unfortunately, because of this small mistake, these three geniuses had died.

“Fortunately, Xiong Tao didn’t die. Otherwise, the losses this time would have been too great. It was so great that even I couldn’t bear it.” Bai Jue clenched his hands tightly.

The Dao Palace valued Xiong Tao extremely. If Xiong Tao died here, although he was the Principles Master, he would definitely be severely punished by the Dao Palace. Even if he did not die, he would at least lose a layer of skin.

“Where did those five black-robed men come from?” Bai Jue shouted in a low voice.

“Lord Bai Jue, the appearance of those five black-robed men was very strange. I’ve already sent people to investigate, but they were unable to find any traces. However, there’s one thing. The reason why they were able to kill the three geniuses of our Dao Palace was because they crushed a command talisman and summoned an expert’s energy clone. Then, this expert’s energy clone unleashed a soul attack. At that time, those black-robed men addressed this energy clone as Lord Long Xing!” Iceberg said respectfully.

“Long Xing?” Bai Jue narrowed his eyes and a sharp light shot out. “Long Xing, the Master of Long Xing! It’s the Sorcerer God’s Sect!”

“Sorcerer God’s Sect?” Iceberg was also stunned.

“Damn the Sorcerer God’s Sect. I’ve heard that they’re very close to the three great sages. It seems that it’s true,” Bai Jue said coldly.

“The three great saints?” Iceberg was shocked.

“Humph, the three great saints have always been at odds with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the temporal temple, and our Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. Although the two sides have not really shed all pretenses of cordiality, there are still all kinds of fights going on in the dark. In recent years, the three great saints have been thinking of ways to suppress the three great Freedom Alliances. To suppress us, other than killing as many of our higher-ups as possible, the most important thing is to kill some of the geniuses in the three great Freedom Alliances ahead of time!”

“Many years ago, three disciples of our Dao Palace were assassinated when they were out adventuring. At that time, they suspected that it was the three great sages who had done it, but they couldn’t find any traces of it. But now, the Sorcerer God’s Sect is openly assassinating the geniuses of our Dao Palace. Good, very good. It seems that the old Sorcerer God wants to be chased back to the universe battlefield.” Bai Jue’s ruthless aura surged into the sky.

“Lord Bai Jue, wasn’t it rumored that the Sorcerer God Sect has always been interested in some special bloodlines and some special life forms?” Iceberg suddenly said.

“Yes, they are indeed very interested in special life forms. For a long time, they have been searching for all kinds of special bloodlines. Usually, they would capture those who could be captured alive, and kill those who could not be captured alive. Then, they would take away their corpses. As for their purpose, no one knows. “No matter what, since the Sorcerer God Sect dared to attack the genius disciples of our Dao Palace this time, they must bear the wrath of the entire Divine Ancestor Dao sect!”

“Ah!”

The killing intent of the 100-jue was overwhelming. Soon, he personally went to see the supreme existences of the Dao Palace.

…

Jian Wushuang did not know the identities of the five black-robed men and why they wanted to assassinate them. He was too lazy to know.

After parting with Jiu Luo and the others, he began to explore the First Heaven by himself. At the same time, he was trying to improve his comprehension of the reincarnation rule.

Time passed quickly. Fifty years passed in the blink of an eye.

The three-winged kingdom was a relatively strong and prosperous country in the first heaven. It had existed for a very long time. The reason was that Luo Academy, one of the nine academies in the First Heaven, was behind the three-winged kingdom.

In such a prosperous kingdom, there were naturally many gladiatorial arenas.

In the largest gladiatorial arena in the three-winged kingdom.

Whoosh!

In the huge gladiatorial arena, there was a deafening noise. Countless spectators were sitting in the audience seats, watching the two people fighting crazily on the battlefield in front of them.

In the inner hall of the gladiatorial arena, a few figures gathered together.

“Brother Han, it’s your turn to fight soon. Are you ready?” A rough voice sounded in the inner hall.

“Haha, Brother Han has already won nine battles in a row in the arena. With such strength, what else do you need to prepare?” Another person’s voice sounded.

“That’s true, but you should still be careful and not be careless. After all, brother Han’s next opponent is Mo Axe, who is a battle maniac. Moreover, he has already won a total of 21 battles in a row in the arena!”

“Brother Han is going to fight with Mo Axe? Damn, why didn’t you say so earlier?!”

“Mo Axe, with Han?”

The people of the inner hall immediately gathered. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

While these people were talking, the one they called Brother Han was sitting quietly at the side, drinking a pot of wine in his hand. When he heard the conversation around him, he did not seem to care at all.

“Mo Axe?”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He had seen the battle between Mo Axe and others in the gladiator arena. His strength was indeed good, but it was far from enough to attract his attention.

“50 years have passed. In these 50 years, my comprehension of reincarnation rules has improved a lot, but now I have reached a bottleneck. This Mo Axe is my last battle in the gladiator arena. I hope he won’t disappoint me.” Jian Wushuang raised the wine pot in his hand, he drank the entire pot of wine in one gulp.

Soon, Jian Wushuang came out.

“Han!”

“Han!”

As soon as Jian Wushuang entered the battlefield in the center of the arena, the entire arena burst into cheers like a landslide and tsunami.

Jian Wushuang had won nine battles in a row in the same level of the arena, so he was naturally very famous.

However, not long after Jian Wushuang entered the battlefield, Mo Axe also arrived.

As soon as Mo Axe appeared, the surrounding cheers were even louder than Jian Wushuang’s. The enthusiasm of countless spectators had been ignited.

“I’ve seen you fight with others.”

A deep voice came from the mouth of the burly man in black armor who looked like a living fierce beast. A giant black axe appeared in Mo Axe’s hand, “Your sword formation is quite powerful, and your movement is very flexible. Unfortunately, it’s useless against me.”

“Really?”

Jian Wushuang gave a strange smile. His body moved, and a total of 18 purple longswords floated out. Under Jian Wushuang’s control, they formed into one in the blink of an eye, it was a purple magic sword that was three meters long.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang pointed.

Swish!

The purple divine sword instantly shot out.
