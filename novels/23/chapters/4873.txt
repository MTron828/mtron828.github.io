4877 The Great Heavenly Official Jian

The entire sky was covered by Yan Immortal’s light. The power gathered by more than 400 Yan Immortals was unimaginable.

The atmosphere was getting more and more restless.

The leading 10 Yan Immortals also looked at each other and tried to attack.

Yan power surged and rushed towards Di Qing like a dragon.

He laughed coldly and suddenly put his palms together. Thousands of golden rays shot up like a huge net and came down.

The dozen Yan Immortals did not even have the time to retreat before they were all ground into dust by the golden light.

“Anyone who dares to take another step forward will die!”

Di Qing shouted coldly, and at the same time, an invisible image form that covered a million miles appeared.

All of the Yan Immortals were shocked, but after looking at each other, they all released their Yan power and attacked together.

Di Qing, who was originally extremely arrogant, immediately shouted after seeing this scene, “Run!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A moment ago, Chun Qiu and the others had still been displaying unparalleled courage, but in the next moment, they had turned around and fled without a trace.

“Catch up and crush them!”

As the earth-shaking sound rang out, the entire Little Lonely Heaven began to fall apart.

The continent plane was shattered, and Little Lonely Heaven, the most vast Heavenly Region in the Six Heavens Realm, was also shattered.

Wherever the hundreds of Yan Immortals passed, Heavenly Regions were destroyed.

At this point, two parts of the entire Six Heavens Realm had been destroyed.

“Your Highness, let’s go find Brother Jian. Otherwise, the entire Six Heavens Realm will be destroyed.” Chen Qing’s face was tired, he was already an arrow at the end of its flight.

Outside the void of the Six Heavens Realm, the Young Emperor was in a daze.

“Your Highness, let’s look for Heavenly Official Jian. The Six Heavens Realm has been destroyed, and all of our heritage is gone,” the skinny purple-robed man said.

The remaining Yan Immortals around him did not dare to speak.

At this time, the Six Heavens Realm was almost wiped out, and even Heavenly Official Jian. would not be able to save them.

A stream of divine blood gushed out of the corner of his mouth without any warning, and the Young Emperor’s body swayed.

The skinny purple-robed man reached out to support him and then handed him a square towel.

Slowly wiping away the divine blood at the corner of his mouth, the Young Emperor’s eyes seemed to be compromising.

“Let’s go to the third Heavenly Region, we’ll welcome Heavenly Official Jian. there.”

…

“Where are we running to? There are so many people chasing us.”

Cui Jing’s panting voice resounded in the void. Chun Qiu and the others followed Di Qing and fled for their lives.

Di Qing, who was at the front, closed his eyes tightly, as if he was trying to sense something.

“Don’t say anything. I’m trying to sense where Wushuang is.” Di Qing said, and then opened his eyes to look at the deep void in front of him.

That was the third Heavenly Region of the Lower Three Heavens.

After Little Lonely Heaven was completely destroyed, the hundreds of Yan Immortals did not stop, they also followed Di Qing and the others, gathering in the Lower Three Heavens.

“Won’t anything happen if we bring so many Yan Immortals to Big Brother Jian?”

Cui Jing stopped in the void of the third Heavenly Region and said nervously.

“Of course something will happen. So, the most important thing now is to call Wushuang out and we will leave this place together,” Di Qing frowned and said. “You guys go in and find Wushuang. I’ll hold them off for a moment.”

Chun Qiu nodded. He was not an indecisive person, so he immediately ascended to the third Heavenly Region.

With the arrival of Di Qing and the others, the Young Emperor, Chen Qing, and the others also came to meet them.

When Cheng Qing saw them, he was instantly overjoyed, “Great, I knew that you guys were fine.”

“You’re also here to find big Brother Jian?” Cui Jing welcomed them.

“Motherf*cker, there are too many of these b*stards. I’ll come here and leave with Brother Jian before I make any plans,” Cheng Qing gritted his teeth and said.

Just then, the group of Yan Immortals arrived.

The remaining 400 or so Yan Immortals were like the sun and stars. The aura they gave off was extremely oppressive.

Even in the entire Great Si Region, 400 Yan Immortals was an unimaginable number.

Apart from the Grand Yan Immortal, they were the most powerful force in the entire Great Si Region. They could destroy stars with a wave of their hands and destroy the Heavenly Region with a flick of their fingers.

They were so arrogant that they could beat the Eldest Prince of Zhen Wuyang like a stray dog.

“Get out of the way. We are only here to destroy the Six Heavens Realm. The other Yan Immortals will not be affected,” The black-robed Yan Immortal shrouded in dark clouds said in a low voice, “Otherwise, all of you will be buried with him!”

Di Qing’s face turned cold, and a touch of disgust appeared in his eyes. “What if I don’t give in? What should I do?”

“Then die!” the black-robed Yan Xian shrieked. With his surroundings as the origin, the void quickly collapsed. At the same time, nine netherworld pythons-like bolts of silk drilled out of the collapsed void and went straight for Di Qing.

As he made his move, the 100 Yan Immortals also released their full power.

All kinds of forces that could easily tear apart the laws of the Heavenly Dao came down with billions of rainbow shadows.

“Damn it!” Di Qing gritted his teeth. Before he could recover from the loss of one true life, he was afraid that he would be seriously injured again.

The Yan Immortal was above the Heavenly Dao, an existence that had transcended the shackles. Even the most ordinary Yan Immortal could create the Heavenly Dao with a wave of his hand.

Thus, the combined attack of the 100 Yan Immortals could not even be withstood by the laws of the Heavenly Dao.

The collapse of the endless void caused a tremor that could even turn the Lower Three Heavens into dust.

However, in the next moment, something happened.

That terrifying strike had yet to land. Time seemed to have stopped, and even the collapsing void was closing.

Di Qing, who was gritting his teeth and about to explode, was also stunned when he saw this.

Everything was eerily silent.

Then, a mysterious scene appeared. A bright river that stretched for billions of miles quietly floated in the void and easily devoured the attack that gathered nearly 100 Yan Immortals.

All the Yan Immortals looked towards the source of the river.

A naked figure with Blood Qi rising around him slowly walked out of the barrier.

With every step he took, there would be strands of extremely dense Blood Qi surging under his skin, which was extremely breathtaking.

Behind this figure stood a figure in a black robe that was as tall as a divine peak.

Ink-like droplets of water dripped into the void through the black robe.

He slowly raised his head, and his originally golden eyes began to emit a blood-red light.

“H-Heavenly Official Jian!”

The remaining Yan Immortals and tens of thousands of top cultivators behind the Young Emperor all widened their eyes at this moment, their hearts beating like drums.

The Young Emperor’s lips curved up slightly, but he returned to his calm state.

Di Qing also raised his eyebrows slightly and heaved a sigh of relief. Even he himself did not realize that he would be completely relaxed after seeing Jian Wushuang.
