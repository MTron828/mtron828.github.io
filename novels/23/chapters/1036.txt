Chapter 1037: Suppression

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom…

The giant hand possessed immense destructive power and it covered the Void around Jian Wushuang entirely, even locking down his movements completely in the process.

Even though Jian Wushuang possessed great speed, he could not escape from the effective range of the giant hand and could only watch helplessly as it came crushing down.

“This is an attack from a Celestial Master, and not just any ordinary one to boot. You have to be careful, Jian Wushuang,” said Gu King, sounding extraordinarily solemn.

“Right,” agreed Jian Wushuang, nodding heavily. “I’ve expected Jiu Xiu to have some tricks up his sleeve, but I never expected him to possess a token containing a Celestial Master’s attack.”

Jian Wushuang looked serious as he stared at the giant hand.

He could feel its power and he understood that it was many times more powerful than the strongest blow of Dao Master Dreamless’s spear.

Even though it was an entry-level technique that was just at the Celestial Master Level, it had wounded him seriously. ”?Now, this giant hand…?” he thought.

“No matter what, I can’t wait to be killed!”

He looked a little unhinged as the Ancient God Power came gushing forth into his right arm.

“Second Finger of the Ancient God, Star-extinguishing!”

Boom!

As he struck his finger out, the image of an Ancient God appeared out of nowhere and it mirrored Jian Wushuang’s action.

Its giant gold finger, which encompassed the power to shatter stars, struck directly at the giant blood-red hand.

This move was currently the strongest technique in Jian Wushuang’s arsenal.

In terms of power, it was much greater than that of the Heaven’s Bane he used earlier.

Bump!

The giant gold finger made direct contact with the giant hand.

The instant they touched, the space around them began rupturing, creating a Black Hole hundreds of kilometers long in the process.

The Black Hole spread with astounding speed, affecting a number of clansmen from the Bone Clan who were nearby. They immediately crumbled into dust particles the instant they were swallowed up by the Black Hole; there was no way they could struggle away.

Two kinds of terrible powers were in a head-on collision.

Contrary to belief, such clashes only lasted for an instant, even shorter than the time it took to take a breath. The giant gold finger that was unleashed by Jian Wushuang had been utterly destroyed.

There was nothing else stopping the giant hand, and it resumed its path toward Jian Wushuang.

“I can only rely on the Blood-killing Plate Armor now,” Jian Wushuang said, the fire of defiance raging in his eyes.

The terrible hand covered Jian Wushuang completely before its power was completely unleashed.

All of a sudden, heaven and earth started to split open.

The terrible ripples from the clash had swept toward the edge of the battlefield, and even the Dao Masters standing around the sides looked fearful and dared not to get in contact.

The technique had even more devastating effect at the epicenter of the clash.

“You should feel proud, Jian Wushuang, that you’ve forced me to use my lifesaving item,” said Jiu Xiu as he stood in the Void, his chilling gaze fixed to the front.

In his opinion, only a Celestial Master could withstand such a terrible blast.

Even though Jian Wushuang was powerful, he was still in essence just an Eternal Realm expert. He would surely be unable to survive after being caught in the center of the blast.

Suddenly, however, …

Ching!

A piercing wind-breaking sound suddenly rang out.

“What?” asked Jiu Xiu incredulously as his expression changed. He immediately turned to see a pale purple lightsaber racing toward him vaguely.

There was a figure dressed in black robes standing at the Void from where the lightsaber came flying out from, and it was undoubtedly Jian Wushuang.

“How is this possible?”?thought Jiu Xiu, his eyes wide open with surprise.?“How is it that he’s perfectly fine after being hit by such a fearsome attack? Also, when did he arrive behind me?”

Even though Jiu Xiu was full of amazement, he still managed to block the lightsaber with his own sword.

The lightsaber was knocked backward with a resounding clash, as was Jiu Xiu. More importantly, he was headed toward the spot where the might of the giant hand had been unleashed, and the turbulent energy storm created earlier had not subsided entirely.

Just at this moment, a ghost-like figure came dashing out from the energy storm.

Even though the person cut a sorry figure, he possessed amazing speed, and he struck at Jiu Xiu’s figure with his longsword.

The sword stroke was as perfect as before, and even though consciousness attack had little effect on Jiu Xiu, it was still made with great speed.

The sword light dashed across the Void mercilessly.

Jiu Xiu could only feel a painful sensation at his throat as his head was detached from his neck and flew off.

“Is that… doppelganger?” Jiu Xiu asked, his pupils wide open. He had finally realized what was happening, but it was too late.

“Sword Mountain, suppress!” Jian Wushuang growled.

The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand began to transform.

What was originally a blood-red sword, which epitomized endless killing, had transformed into a huge mountain in an instant.

It descended from above and came pressing down upon Jiu Xiu’s torso.

At the height of his powers, Jiu Xiu would not have been suppressed by Jian Wushuang, but he had been beheaded, and even though he was still alive, he had temporarily lost the ability to act.

There was a buzzing sound as a Black Hole appeared at the bottom of the mountain, and countless mysterious cracks came swarming out of it. They soon engulfed the entire area and formed into a vast Spell Formation.

The formation had wrapped over Jiu Xiu’s body.

“No!” only a growl could be heard from him as he was entirely swallowed up by the Black Hole.

Soon, no sound was coming from him.

With a wave of his hand, the mountain transformed back into sword form and reappeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand. As he stroked the sword, Jian Wushuang could sense the trapped Jiu Xiu.

“I succeeded!”

His eyes were bright with glee, and his Slaughter Body appeared at his side.

He had made detailed preparations before attempting the suppression. Other than making a sneak attack, he had hidden his Slaughter Body nearby, waiting for the right moment to unleash it. He had succeeded because it attacked at the right moment and was in sync with the movements of his World Body.

“That giant hand was really powerful, I wonder which Holy Master of the Ancient Demon Clan did it originate from?” Jian Wushuang muttered. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Its power was not reduced in the least bit even after being hit by his Second Finger of the Ancient God, and it had even pressed onto Jian Wushuang. Luckily, the Blood-killing Plate Armor he was wearing reduced most of the impact, and he managed to withstand the rest of it as his body was extremely tough, due to the fact that he was a Three-star Imperial God.

Even though he was seriously wounded, it was not enough to destroy him.
