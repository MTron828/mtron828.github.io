Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After exchanging pleasantries, Jian Wushuang chatted with Emperor Wan Xing about the Grave God Mountain. They then turned their attention to the grand hall.

These individuals had arrived tens of thousands of years before him, and their knowledge surpassed his own by a considerable margin.

However, some people remained in meditation within the hall, paying no attention to his arrival.

Wan Xing smiled faintly, ‚ÄúWushuang, it‚Äôs not as complicated as we might think.

Take a look at the murals on the walls.‚Äù

Jian Wushuang wasn‚Äôt a fool; with just one glance, he understood.

The depictions were crystal clear.

In a secret realm, the Three Kings Court captured a giant egg.

Rather than saying they captured it, it was more accurate to say that a colossal egg descended from the heavens into a secret realm under the influence of the Three Kings Court.

Within the secret realm, there was a team of Heavenly Lords led by what seemed to be a tier 6 Emperor. Jian Wushuang could sense the aura on the person.

That person was at least a peak-level tier 6 powerhouse.

Leading a team of ten individuals, each of them was a peak-level tier 5 Emperor.

This elite squad, upon encountering the egg for the first time, was unexpectedly suppressed by the secret law on the egg‚Äôs surface.

Their deaths were inexplicable.

Fortunately, in ancient times, most powerful individuals used avatars when traveling.

At that time, with sufficient treasures and time, they nurtured avatars over several epochs, investing numerous treasures to create avatars comparable to their true selves.

So, a few of them did not perish but lost their avatars.

They promptly reported this news to the higher-ups.

Initially, the Universe Master in charge did not pay much attention. Instead, he dispatched a supreme-peak powerhouse to investigate.

However, this move triggered a catastrophe.

The first mural was done!

Wan Xing then pointed to another painting, urging Jian Wushuang to continue looking.

In the second mural, a massive eye was depicted.

It leaked out from the eggshell.

A supreme-peak powerhouse shattered the eggshell, revealing the eye. Although the surpeme-peak powerhouse suppressed it, they couldn‚Äôt deliver a fatal blow.

Then, the Universe Master personally took action.

He brought the giant egg into the Three Kings Court.

Originally, it seemed like good luck to obtain a beast egg and attempt to forcefully hatch it using treasures.

But it turned out to be counterproductive.

Not only did the giant egg fail to hatch, but the exotic beast within nearly perished.

In the moment of the beast‚Äôs weakness, a piece of news spread.

This piece of news reached the vast expanse of the starry sky.

It attracted the descent of a formidable being.

Even the Universe Master suffered a backlash, losing control under the rule force on the eggshell and inexplicably started slaughtering his subordinates.

This scene prompted the appearance of kings from the Three Kings Courts.

The king, whom Jian Wushuang had encountered before, or rather, anyone who entered this place had encountered‚Ä¶

He was the disheveled chessboard old man with dark red skin.

His descent suppressed the Universe Master.

Unfortunately, that time, countless Heavenly Lords fell.

Under a Universe Master, there were countless individuals.

Apart from the Heavenly Lords, there were also Dao Lords. The fall of billions caused ripples in the river of time and space.

In a corner of the mural, a venerable old man with curved horns on his head was revealed, with the character ‚ÄúQi‚Äù embroidered on his robe.

It was the dominance of Qishen, the power of Qishen Temple.

The old man with curved horns, representing Qishen Temple, was also intervening.

Jian Wushuang was curious about the giant egg. This time, without waiting for Wan Xing to speak, he looked at the third mural.

The third painting did not depict the giant egg but rather the collision with the old man with curved horns.Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The old man with curved horns seemed to be entangled with something, showing hesitation in dealing with the Three Kings Courts.

However, it was evident that the Three Royal Courts were wary of the old man

with curved horns.

In ancient times, the three Divine Masters of Qishen Temple could handle the Three Kings Courts.

There were strong and weak Universe Masters.

Strong ones, like Qishen, could dominate the entire Moro spacetime alone.

There were also weak ones, like the Universe Master disrupted by the giant egg in the second mural, obviously struggling within the same tier.

Yet, Jian Wushuang was unaware of the power divisions among the Universe Masters and couldn‚Äôt determine the extent of the power gap.

The old man with curved horns in the mural eventually retreated, and the Three Kings Courts began to study the giant egg.

However, what followed was the arrival of a terrifying powerhouse.

Just as they placed the giant egg in the Three Kings Court, a visitor from the stars arrived.

It was Feugo.

Leading a vast army, or perhaps he alone constituted an army of cultivators.

Countless twisted crawlers separated from his body, assaulting the Three Kings Court with force.

At this moment, the old man with curved horns appeared again, but this time, he stayed in the corner of the mural, not stepping forward.

Fego attacked the Three Kings Court, devastating everything in his path, unstoppable.

He continued until he stood before the Three Kings.

Those skeletal figures seen by outsiders were actually part of Fuego‚Äôs body.

If he could see the external scene now, he would be even more convinced.

Because Fuego, by devouring those skeletons, was growing stronger.

The true form of Shang, initially able to contend with him, had now fallen to a lower state.

The outside world was in chaos.

The Earth Realm erupted into an unprecedented chaotic battle; the Southern Chaotic Domain collapsed, and countless powerful beings perished.

At this moment, the Kui Organization unleashed a great war.

This step was the result of billions of years of planning by Shen Ling.

In the hall, the more Jian Wushuang looked back, the more shocked he became!

The Three Kings sacrificed themselves, yet Fuego, unstoppable until the end, was killed by the old man with curved horns.

The giant egg also hatched completely, but it was previously damaged at its foundation, possessing only half the strength of a Universe Master at birth, yet its realm was that of a Universe Master.

This already rivaled those innate divine beasts, born as Universe Masters, incredibly powerful.

What hatched from the giant egg was a dark golden dragon. Without Fuego‚Äôs protection, the old man with curved horns easily suppressed it.

The final scene was a picture of ruins.

Among them were Zhen Wuyang, Tongtian Buddha, Chishui, and even Situ Nan and Island Lord Gui Ling.

Jian Wushuang was utterly shocked!

This was a mural predicting the future.

Apart from these people, he also saw three faceless individuals, even their gender indistinguishable.

Who did these three represent?

Jian Wushuang pondered carefully.

Then he thought of himself; he did not see himself.

There were also Hu Qing and that person, Jiang Shang!

Without the three of them.

These three faceless individuals should be them.

However, why they had no faces, Jian Wushuang couldn‚Äôt fathom.

After finishing viewing the mural, he couldn‚Äôt calm his emotions for a long time.

This scene was no different from the others.

‚ÄúBrother Wushuang, you, Hu Qing, and that girl Jiang Shang haven‚Äôt shown up. I think this opportunity is related to you three. The Three King Courts happen to have three kings!‚Äù Wan Xing pointed to the three faceless figures above, feeling a bit emotional.

He practiced the Myriad Dao, naturally having a connection with the Transformation Dao.

Although he chose the Transformation Dao, in terms of innate talent, he couldn‚Äôt compare to Jian Wushuang and Broly. Now, he was only at the peak-level of tier 4 and had long lost the arrogance he once had..
