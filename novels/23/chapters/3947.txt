Chapter 3951: Arrival

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The vast and boundless universe void space was pitch black, and no light could be seen.

An ancient and huge universe boat was shuttling through the dark void space. This universe boat was incredibly fast. It was obviously huge and heavy, but it could fly through the dark void space of the universe, it was like a fish shuttling through water.

Within the universe boat, there were many powerful and majestic energies. Whether it was the cabin or the deck, there were many great beings standing there. Most of them were Principles Masters, but there were also many Rulers.

And at the core of this universe boat, there was clearly a golden and resplendent palace.

In the center of the palace, two figures were sitting on towering thrones, with fine wine and delicacies placed in front of them.

“In a few days, I will be able to resist that Star Field. Tsk tsk, speaking of which, I have taken over a Star Field in this Star Field. However, my true body spends most of its time in the Devil Cloud Star. As for this Star Field, I seldom come here. I remember that the last time I came to this Star Field was a very, very long time ago.” A loose green robe was placed on the middle-aged man’s back, a middle-aged man with short hair held a bowl of wine and sighed. He had a unique smile on his face.

At first glance, this green-robed middle-aged man gave people a gentle and refined feeling. However, his eyes were strangely golden, which made him even more bewitching.

And his identity was the Star Devil Cloud Star Master.

He was also the source of this catastrophe in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Countless years ago, if Devil Cloud Star Master had not come to this star area and accidentally found the embryonic stage of the Divine Beginning Realm and seized it, many things would not have happened, the Divine Beginning Realm would also be very stable.

Unfortunately, because of this Devil Cloud Star Master, everything changed.

Right now, the entire Divine Beginning Realm was in a crisis because of this Devil Cloud Star Master. Once they failed to survive, countless creatures in the Divine Beginning Realm would lose their lives.

“Devil Cloud, we agreed that when we get to that heavenly realm, you have to let me take a good look at the heavenly realm that you’ve taken over. It would be best if you let me enter that heavenly realm to take a stroll.” Said a man in purple armor who was sitting opposite Devil Cloud Star Master. “Let’s go,” Said a man in purple battle armor.

This man in purple battle armor had a burly figure. At first glance, he looked like a huge mountain. He was sitting opposite the Devil Cloud Star Master, and his words and actions did not carry any hint of reverence. Moreover, the Devil Cloud Star Master had clearly interacted with him on an equal level.

“Shi Hua, don’t worry. You can forget about just taking a look at my astral world. Even if you want to stay there for a long time, you can do so as long as you want,” said the Devil Cloud Star Master with a smile.

“I don’t plan on staying in your astral world for long. I’m just curious and want to take a look. Although it’s only a Grade 3 astral world, it’s after all a self-nurtured place in the vast universe. To be able to possess such an astral world, tsk tsk, it’s really enviable.” The purple armored man praised, but at the same time, he did not hide his envy.

“Haha, I was just lucky. Back then, when I was forced into a corner in Devil Cloud Star, I came to other territories to try my luck. In the end, I really hit the jackpot.” Devil Cloud Star Master laughed.

“Of course I was lucky. However, you didn’t die when you took over a star world. Instead, you succeeded in taking over. Your ability isn’t weak either.” The purple-armored man praised.

He was very clear that even if it was an embryonic astral world, it would still be extremely difficult for him to take over it.

The reason why the Devil Cloud Star Master was able to succeed was because of his own experiences. He was forced into a corner by others. It was not easy for him to find a great opportunity. Naturally, he gambled everything. He did not leave any way out for himself before he succeeded in taking over it.

Devil Cloud Star Master and the purple-armored man were casually chatting and laughing.

Suddenly…

“Huh?” Devil Cloud Star Master’s expression changed. He had already sensed the two people waiting in the void space in front of the universe boat.

“Let the two people in front come up.”

Devil Cloud Star Master sent a message to the great beings on the universe boat.

Soon, the universe boat stopped in the dark void space in front of them. The two human figures who had been waiting there for a long time arrived on the universe boat, and they soon appeared in front of Devil Cloud Star Master.

“Greetings, Devil Cloud Star Master.”

The two people who arrived bowed slightly to Devil Cloud Star Master with a hint of humility.

“Star Luo, Sorcerer God, you two are hiding here?” Devil Cloud Star Master looked at the two people in front of him with interest. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

They were Master Star Luo and Sorcerer God.

Master Star Luo was Leng Ruxue’s master. Although she was not an expert under Devil Cloud Star Master, she had worked with him before. Previously, Jian Wushuang had tried to help his wife, Leng Rushuang, recover her divine body, he had also tried to find Master Star Luo, but unfortunately, he had not been able to find her.

As for the Sorcerer God, he had once controlled the Sorcerer God sect in the Divine Beginning Realm and stood on the same side as the three Saint Realms. He had also attacked Jian Wushuang.

Later, after Jian Wushuang had destroyed the three Saint Realms, he had also tried to find and kill the Sorcerer God. However, the Sorcerer God seemed to have vanished without a trace.

Now, the two people Jian Wushuang was looking for had appeared here.

“It can’t be helped. The Star Palace has complete control over the Star Field. Their forces are everywhere in the Star Field, including the three Universe Battlefields. The Star Palace and Jian Wushuang have been looking for us. If we were still in the Star Field, they would have found us long ago. We can only stay at the edge of the Star Field and wait for your arrival, Devil Cloud Star Master,” the Sorcerer God said with a dry smile.

“Sorcerer God, do you remember our agreement?” Devil Cloud Star Master stared at the Sorcerer God.

“Of course I do. But since the three saint realms were uprooted by Jian Wushuang, all my plans have stopped. I can’t do anything about it,” the Sorcerer God said.

“That’s not a problem. After I flatten this Star Field and kill Jian Wushuang and his people, you can do it again,” said Devil Cloud Star Master.

“That’s true. However, the power of Jian Wushuang and the Divine Beginning Realm is no longer the same as before. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to completely uproot the resistance of the Divine Beginning Realm,” said the Sorcerer God.

“Oh?” The Star Master raised his eyebrows. “Then tell me, how strong has the resistance of the Divine Beginning Realm become over the years?”

“Devil Cloud Star Master, as far as I know, because of that Blood Sword Master, the Divine Beginning Realm has obtained a large number of resources and treasures. At the same time, they’ve also gathered a large number of experts. Especially in recent years, they’ve gathered nearly 70% of the upper echelons of this Star Field…” Sorcerer God began to narrate.
