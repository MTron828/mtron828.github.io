Chapter 562: Exiting the Holy Place

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang, as one of the Divine Emperors, had his own residence in the Holy Place, and it was a fairly large manor.

At this moment, he was busy exercising inside his manor. He was in the horse stance, with his upper body naked and his fists tightly clenched, releasing punches, one after the other, and his every move would cause an exploding sound to reverberate throughout the area.

Naturally, he was covered in sweat.

After a long time had passed, he finally stopped and moved to a stone table, where he proceeded to gulp down the container of water that was on it.

He let out a sigh.

Though he looked tired, there was joy in his eyes.

“Finally, I’ve mastered the 10th Level of the Bone Fusion Technique after two months of practicing.”?Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had been cultivating hard during these last two months, all in order to strengthen his body. He had even bought some treasures from the Monster-exterminating Pagoda, like the Ninth Heaven Thunderbolts. These treasures had been quite helpful to him and he had finally succeeded in mastering the 10th level.

It goes without saying that the 10th Level was more powerful than the Ninth Level.

As of now, Jian Wushuang’s body was much stronger than before, but it was still far from its limits.

From the time he first reached the level of Venerable Master until now, he had been slowly strengthening his body.

“I really want to know how incredible my body will be when it finally reaches its limits.”?

Jian Wushuang was full of expectations.

“Sword Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang heard a hearty voice right before a red-haired elder entered.

“Emperor Daofeng.” Jian Wushuang stood up and looked at the elder.

Emperor Daofeng, one of the 108 Divine Emperors, had an important position in the Monster-exterminating League. He was in charge of many issues regarding the Human Territory.

“Sword Emperor, I came here for only one reason.” Emperor Daofeng went straight to the point.

“Please tell me then,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Even though the Human Territory takes up a small portion of the Monster Continent, it is still so vast. Because of this, many Demonic Beasts keep infiltrating our land and placing monster spies within our population.

“Those spies normally maintain a low profile and behaved themselves for fear of being found, but several days ago some spies attacked a territory and slaughtered many experts for no reason.”

“They slaughtered human beings inside the Huaman Territory?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

From what he had learned, monster spies usually wouldn’t slaughter human beings unless they were exposed.

Therefore, what the elder had told him was a rare case.

“Those attackers were very powerful. Some of them were even Rank Seven or Eight Monsters. So far, they have destroyed four tribes,” said the elder gravely.

“In that case, you must be preparing to send some human experts there to kill those spies as soon as possible,” said Jian Wushuang. He shot Emperor Daofeng a weird glance before asking, “Emperor Daofeng, did you come here to ask me for help?”

“Yes.” Emperor Daofeng nodded. “These spies are powerful and only Divine Emperors can kill them all. I came to ask you for help because those attacks took place near the Wu Yan Tribe.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly darkened.

The Wu Yan Tribe was where he had stayed when he first arrived on the Monster Continent.

It was a place where he had felt some rare warmth in his life. He had only spent one month there, but he still held some feelings for the tribe.

Wu Yu, the lovely girl with big eyes, and Qing Hu were still on his mind.

“Did those spies attack the Wu Yan Tribe?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

“Not yet,” Emperor Daofeng answered. “I came here because I knew you were from that tribe.”

“Ok, I’ll start off now.” After saying that, Jian Wushuang left immediately and headed towards the tribe.

In no time at all, a Flowing Light was seen heading from the Holy Place towards the Wu Yan Tribe. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Outside the Holy Place, the spies who had been watching the entrance reported the news the moment they saw Jian Wushuang come out.

Inside the Monster Clan’s Information center, the black-robed elder smiled cruelly upon receiving the news.?“Sure enough, Sword Emperor set out to save the Wu Yan Tribe without a hint of suspicion. But there’s no reason for him to think that it was a trap set for him.”

The elder was right.

It never occurred to Jian Wushuang that the whole thing was just a trap set to lure him out.

He never thought that the Monster Clan would specifically target him since he was just an outsider.

There were some cases where monster spies had murdered exceptional geniuses from the Monster-exterminating League before they could become really powerful.

However, as an outsider and a superior emperor, Jian Wushuang was different. It would be insane for those spies to plan to kill him.

What was beyond Jian Wushuang’s expectation was that a Monster Emperor had been driven crazy by the compass he got from Emperor Golden Snake.

“Master Ji is ready. All we need to do is wait for Sword Emperor to arrive.”?The black-robed elder sneered.

Over the years, he had managed to murder many geniuses and experts.

Even though his current target was a superior emperor, he was still confident.

At the same time, in a towering palace in the Holy Place, Temple Master Iceberg also received the news that Jian Wushuang had left the Holy Place.

“Finally, you went out by yourself.

“With the Wu Yan Tribe in danger, you couldn’t just stand by and watch.”

Temple Master Iceberg looked grim with an icy smile on his face.?“I thought you would never leave the Holy Place.”

“It’s true that I can’t deal with you as long as you’re in the Holy Place, but now that you’ve gone outside.”

Not long after Jian Wushuang left the Holy Place, Temple Master Iceberg left as well.
