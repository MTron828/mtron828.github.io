Chapter 2976: Easily Killed

——

A cave-dwelling that had been temporarily opened up.

The six experts of the team gathered together. Although there were only six people in this team, their lineup was extremely strong. There were three True Saints of the first rank alone, and the remaining three were also extremely powerful Peak False Saints.

They had also killed a True Saint-level Dragon Flame Beast, even though they had been hiding here.

“This mission is really strange. They didn’t tell me the details of the second phase of the mission and just let us stay in the Dragon Flame World for another month. Could it be that something big will happen in the Dragon Flame World within this one month?” A True Saint expert said.

“Who knows? I’ve been an earth-rank member of the War Sky Alliance for a long time, and I’ve received quite a few missions. However, I’ve never encountered such a strange mission. I wonder who the War Sky Alliance is issuing the mission to. What are they thinking about?” Another person said.

“Alright, stop complaining.” The leader of the team, a bald old man, said, “No matter what we will encounter in this mission, we only need to stay here for a month. At most, we can hide here for a month. No matter what happens in the outside world, don’t go out. As long as we can stay here for a month, we can get a total of 200 million sacred elixirs!”

Upon hearing the 200 million sacred elixirs, the eyes of the other members of the team turned scarlet.

In fact, very few people were willing to accept missions like this, where they did not even know the details of the mission.

But this time, it was because the reward of 200 million sacred elixirs was too attractive. No one could resist the temptation of 200 million sacred elixirs.

At this moment…

His Highness Qian Chen, who had just arrived in the Dragon Flame World, had already arrived in the wilderness and arrived outside the cave abode where the team was located.

Boom!

A majestic divine power from the body of Prince Qian Chen swept up, and directly toward the cave to the impact.

Hiding in the cave in the six people immediately reacted, whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Six figures shot into the sky at once.

In the void, the six strong men of this squad, one by one, glared at the black-robed young Prince Qian Chen in front of them.

“Where is the boy, dare to destroy my six people’s cave, seek death?” A Peak False Saint immediately shouted.

His Highness Qian Chen’s gaze was cold as he swept across the six people in front of him. He coldly said, “I’ll give you two choices. The first is to hand over the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse that you’ve killed before and leave the Dragon Flame World!”

“The second is to die!”

Hearing this, the six people in this team were so angry that they laughed.

“Haha, where did this idiot come from? He’s just a Peak False Saint, yet he still dares to speak so shamelessly in front of the six of us. He’s really courting death!”

“Don’t waste your breath on him. Kill him before!”

“Kill!”

The three weaker Peak False Saints in this six-man team immediately moved.

Three majestic auras directly pressed down on Prince Qian Chen. As for the three True Saints in the team, they just watched with faint smiles on their faces. They had no intention of making a move.

In their eyes, both sides were Peak False Saints. With three against one, this black-robed man with a battle saber on his back was dead for sure.

But suddenly…

Prince Qian Chen made his move.

His figure flashed and he appeared in front of the three Peak False Saints charging over. The battle blade behind him was instantly unsheathed.

Whoosh!

A blade light slashed out mercilessly.

This blade light was clearly just casually slashed out, but it contained the endless power of the laws of darkness. The power of the laws of darkness was far denser than these Peak False Saints had imagined, and the blade light even grew bigger along the way…it instantly engulfed the three Peak False Saints.

“Careful!”

The three Peak False Saints also sensed it, and they instinctively attacked with all their strength, trying to block this blade light.

But in the end…the blade light mercilessly swept past, and the three Peak False Saints were all killed, leaving behind three cold corpses.

“What?”

The other three True Saints who were in the air not far away were all shocked when they saw this scene.

One against three, and he killed three Peak False Saints with a blade. What kind of battle power was this?

“It’s your turn.”

Prince Qian Chen’s expression was cold. With a flash, he appeared in front of the three True Saints as if he had teleported.

“Block him.”

The bald elder, who was the team leader and the strongest of the three True Saints, was the first to react. He brandished a huge hammer and smashed it out with boundless divine power. Divine Lightning crackled and formed a lightning prison that charged toward Prince Qian Chen.

Prince Qian Chen’s gaze was still cold as he casually waved the battle saber in his hand.

The lightning prison, which also carried the endless power of the law of darkness, instantly collapsed. However, this dark saber light continued to stand on top of the bald old man’s divine body with shocking power.

The bald old man was a first-level True Saint after all, and his protective ability was not weak. However, under this saber light, chi chi chi chi! Chi chi! His divine body started to crumble.

Weng!

With one slash, the bald elder’s divine body completely crumbled.

“Impossible!”

“He’s this strong?”

The other two True Saints were completely stunned.

One slash had caused the divine body of a rank one True Saint to crumble. This strength had definitely surpassed the level of a rank one True Saint.

Sou! Sou!

Princess Qian Chen’s figure once again flickered, and then shua! Shua! Another two slashes descended. The two True Saints did not even have time to react before they were swept away by the blade light, and their divine bodies also collapsed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In just an instant, the divine bodies of the three True Saints in this team had already been directly destroyed.

However, True Saints could control their immortal bodies and rely on divine power to replenish their divine bodies.

A large amount of divine power began to gather, and the bald old man’s divine body was the first to recover.

However, after recovering, the bald old man was extremely terrified.

“Too terrifying, this person’s strength is too terrifying!”

“He destroyed my divine body with a single slash. Although I can reassemble my divine body, reassembling it once would consume close to 30% of my divine power. If that’s the case, he would only need four slashes at most to truly kill me!”

“Run!”

The bald old man did not hesitate at all and immediately chose to flee.

He knew very well that this black-robed young man’s strength was only that of Prince Qian Chen’s. He was not someone he could contend against.

Not to mention him alone, even if the three True Saints joined forces, they would not be able to contend against him. They would only be easily killed by the other party.

“He’s the strongest in this team. The Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse should be on him.” A sharp light flashed in Prince Qian Chen’s eyes as he instantly chased after the bald old man.

The purpose of this trip was that his mission was not to kill all the experts from the twelve squads, but to kill the corpse of the Dragon Flame Beast in the hands of the twelve squads!
