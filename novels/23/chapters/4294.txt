4298 Qiulong Dies

The Wuqi Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand seemed to have hit an invisible wall and could not fall any further.

“Jian Wushuang, I told you. You can’t kill me.” A mocking look appeared on Qiu Long’s face as he laughed fearlessly.

The next moment!

A huge shadow appeared behind him.

!!

This phantom was wearing black armor with mysterious patterns on it. The waistcoat was formed by two dragon claws, and it had a dragon head and a human body.

The Black Eagle had an indifferent expression. He glanced at Jian Wushuang indifferently and said indifferently, “Human, I’m Dragon Nine, the law enforcer of the dragon clan. The members of the dragon clan must be handed over to the dragon clan to deal with. I’ll give you the time it takes for an incense stick to burn to send Qiu Long out of the Ancient Path of Stars. The dragon clan will send someone to pick up Qiu Long and bring him back to the dragon clan.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and then, as if he didn’t hear anything, divine power poured into the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand and pressed down on the Qiu Long’s head inch by inch!

“Ka ka ka!!!”

In an instant, the void above the Qiu Long’s head was filled with the sound of glass breaking.

In an instant, Qiu Long and the dragon clan’s law enforcer’s faces changed.

“Human, I’m talking to you. Did you not hear me?” The illusionary figure of the Dragon Clan’s law enforcer squinted his eyes, which emitted a cold and sharp light.

“You’re too noisy!”

Jian Wushuang shouted coldly and continued to stab at Qiu Long’s head with the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand!

When the Dragon Clan’s law-enforcement officer saw this, he was instantly enraged to the extreme. He opened his mouth and scolded sternly, “I’ll give you the last three breaths. Now! Immediately! He immediately stopped what he was doing! After that, we’ll send Qiu Long out of the Ancient Path of Stars and let him be punished by our Dragon Clan!”

“Impudent! Human, are you challenging my authority? Are you challenging the dignity of the Dragon race?”

When the dragon clan’s law-enforcement officer saw this, he was instantly enraged to the extreme. He opened his mouth and scolded sternly, “I’ll give you the last three breaths. Now! Immediately! He immediately stopped what he was doing! After that, we’ll send Qiu Long out of the Ancient Path of Stars and let him be punished by our dragon clan! Otherwise, you will bear the consequences!”

“Three!”

“Two!”

“You’re too noisy.”

Without waiting for him to finish, Jian Wushuang slashed his sword and shattered the illusionary shadow of the Dragon Clan’s enforcer!

“You’re just a mere consciousness Phantom without any divine power. Even if you were here in person, you wouldn’t be able to stop me from killing someone!” Jian Wushuang sneered and with a flip of his hand, the Wuqi Divine Sword stabbed toward Qiu Long’s head again!

“Qiu Long, you will die today.”

This time, Qiu Long’s expression finally changed drastically.

“Jian Wushuang, stop! Do you know what you are doing now?” Qiu Long was shocked and angry.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s lips curved into a mocking arc and he said indifferently, “Are you afraid now?”

Qiu Long’s expression was livid, and he replied, “Jian Wushuang, do you know the consequences of killing me? The dragon clan’s enforcer represents the dignity of the dragon clan. You have shattered his consciousness shadow, so the dragon clan will never let you off. They will definitely allow anyone who has provoked the dragon clan to live!”

After a short pause, Qiu Long’s expression softened and he continued, “The only way for you to survive is to let me go. I promise that when I return to the dragon clan, I will be able to speak to you. How about it?”

“Not much.”

Jian Wushuang laughed sarcastically and without any hesitation, he stabbed the Wuqi Divine Sword into Qiu Long’s head!

“Roar!”

As Qiu Long roared in pain, he began to struggle violently and smashed the surroundings madly.

Jian Wushuang held the hilt of the sword tightly with both hands and stabbed it into the Wuqi Divine Sword on Qiu Long’s head. Waves of sharp sword Qi burst out continuously and shattered the divine power that belonged to the dragon clan in Qiu Long’s body!

Countless drops of dragon blood splattered on Jian Wushuang’s face, but he did not react at all. He was extremely indifferent to Qiu Long’s cries.

The Overlord, the Nine Stars Saint, and the others were all stunned by this scene. Their lips trembled as they said, “Tu…Dragon slaying! Jian Wushuang is killing a Dragon!”

“I don’t know how many years it has been, but it hasn’t left the universe. Who would dare to kill a member of the dragon clan?”

“This is the dragon clan! The dragon clan will be in charge of the dragon clan. This is a rule set at the birth of the universe. Jian Wushuang actually dared to break this rule!”

“Even the Great Void Temple only suppressed Qiu Long and did not kill him because they were considering the reaction of the Dragon Tribe! Now, Jian Wushuang has destroyed the illusionary Shadow of the Dragon clan’s law enforcer and killed Qiu Long…”

The Overlord and the others were not the only ones who were shocked.

Even in the universe, the top forces were watching this scene with their eyes shining.

“Hmph, Jian Wushuang is really stupid.”

In the Great Void Temple, Supreme Bing Ye snorted coldly as he had already sentenced Jian Wushuang to death in his heart.

A Dragon had a reverse scale that would kill anyone who touched it!

The dragon clan’s reverse scale was his high and mighty prestige.

Whoever dared to challenge the dragon clan’s dignity had to be prepared to die!

…

In the Cosmos Temple, the Palace Master, who was wearing a black gold crown and a purple gold royal robe, also smiled.

“The sins of the heavens can be forgiven, but the sins of one’s own can not be lived. Now it seems that the little guy from the Divine Life Palace is already dead without the help of Cosmos Temple.”

All of a sudden, the entire universe was abuzz with discussions about Jian Wushuang killing the dragon.

Some people sneered. “Jian Wushuang was cutting off his own future and acting on impulse.” Some people sighed. “If Jian Wushuang had let Qiu Long go, the dragon clan wouldn’t have let him go easily based on what he had done. However, Jian Wushuang had put himself in danger.”

Only a burst of hearty laughter came from the Divine Life Palace.

“Hahahaha, this little guy doesn’t even give face to the dragon clan. He’s really different from ordinary people. I’m really more and more fond of him.”

The Ruler Blood Wave laughed in a carefree manner.

On the other hand, Supreme Being Giant Axe seemed a little worried and said, “Blood Wave, I’m afraid the dragon clan won’t let Jian Wushuang go so easily.”

...

The Ruler Blood Wave narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Jian Wushuang is a member of the Divine Life Palace and he is considered half a disciple of mine. If the dragon clan finds trouble with him, I, Blood Wave, will take the blame for him! What’s there to fear?”

Supreme Giant Axe could not help but smile wryly. He shook his head and did not say anything.

…

In the universe, there were many discussions about Jian Wushuang.

Meanwhile, in the 18th city on the Ancient Path of Stars.

As the sword essence of the Wuqi Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand continued to burst out in Qiu Long’s head, finally, Qiu Long’s struggle gradually weakened.

At the last moment, Qiu Long no longer looked like he was struggling. Instead, he stared at Jian Wushuang and said with hatred, “Jian Wushuang, it doesn’t matter if I die. Don’t worry, you will come down to accompany me soon.”

Bang!

With a loud explosion, the Dragon’s body completely collapsed. Starting from the dragon’s tail, it dissipated inch by inch.
