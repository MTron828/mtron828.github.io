Chapter 1040: It’s Worth a Risk!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang, that Jiu Xiu is acting so tough because he knows that the expert from the Ancient Monster Clan will come to his rescue. It’ll be impossible for you to extract the information you need from him before they arrive, therefore I suggest you kill him outright,” suggested Gu King solemnly.

“Kill him?” Jian Wushuang asked as he squinted slightly.

He was full of killing intent when faced with Jiu Xiu; indeed, he wanted Jiu Xiu dead immediately.

Before that could happen, however, he still needed to find out about his mother’s whereabouts and also many secrets about the Ancient Monster Clan.

“I spent so much effort in capturing Jiu Xiu, and now that I have a chance to find out where my mother is, how could I give up so easily?” asked Jian Wushuang as he clenched his fists together, feeling increasingly indignant.

“Right, I’m indignant!”?he thought.

He spent so much effort to subdue Jiu Xiu and had even given up 28 Chaos Gems just to hire the two killers from the Blood Saber Organization to help him; he did all these because he had wanted Jiu Xiu to tell him what he wanted to know.

“If I merely wanted him dead, why would I go through so much trouble?

“Now that I’ve subdued Jiu Xiu, how could I allow all my effort to go to waste out of fear of the Ancient Monster Clan’s expert?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted with a sharp glare as he thought about the matter.

Whizz! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Jian Wushuang, who had been traversing quickly, suddenly stopped in his tracks.

His Slaughter Body had suddenly appeared.

He passed his Interspatial Ring, along with many other treasures, to the Slaughter Body.

“Have you really made up your mind, Jian Wushuang?” Gu King’s voice rang in his head again.

“Right,” nodded Jian Wushuang heavily. “I’ll let my Slaughter Body carry my treasures, including the Mountain River Map, into hiding, so that my life will be secure. Then, my World Body will bring my Blood Mountain Sword and Blood-killing Plate Armor to engage the Ancient Monster Clan!”

“I have many tricks up my sleeve, and now that Jiu Xiu is in my hands, I can contend with and even discuss terms with the Ancient Monster Clan. Even if we end up trying to kill each other, they cannot kill my World Body.”

“Also, even if my World Body is somehow destroyed by the Ancient Monster Clan, I’ll just be losing the Blood Mountain Sword and the Blood-killing Plate Armor; I won’t be dying there.”

“I can still try to get my items back if I lose them, but if I lose this chance to interrogate Jiu Xiu, I may never get another shot at him.”

“My father did not hesitate when he made the irreversible decision to become a Reincarnator, all because he wanted to have a chance of meeting my mother again, even though it was only a slight one. Today, I have the rare chance of knowing where my mother is, and it’s definitely a risk worth taking.”

Jian Wushuang spoke in a low tone, his expression serious; he had already made up his mind.

“In this case, go for it. With your Blood-killing Plate Armor and my restorative power, even a Celestial Master would not find it easy to kill you,” said Gu King solemnly.

Jian Wushuang could not control his emotions and gave off a laugh.

His Slaughter Body immediately began hiding in a secluded spot, while his World Body carried the Blood Mountain Sword, along with Jiu Xiu, who was suppressed in it, to continue traversing forward.

Whilst doing so, he kept increasing the suffering and pressure on Jiu Xiu.

He was now in a contest with Jiu Xiu to see who could hang on for a longer time.

Either Jiu Xiu would give up trying to withstand the suffering of being restricted within the Sword Mountain and tell Jian Wushuang everything he wanted to know, or Jian Wushuang would be found by the expert from the Ancient Monster Clan and be destroyed. Whoever lasted longer would emerge as the victor.

After Jian Wushuang had finished making preparations for his risky venture, the expert from the Ancient Monster Clan was already drawing near.

“Soon, I’m already close!”

Celestial Master Winter Whistle from the Ancient Monster Clan appeared as a flash of lightning as he zoomed through the Void, his gaze fixed in front. He could sense that the mysterious crack on Jiu Xiu’s body was somewhere in the distance.

“One more hour, I can catch up with him by one hour at most!”

“Nine Sword, I hope you can hold on for another hour,” muttered the Celestial Master.

Just at this moment…

“Celestial Master Winter Whistle,” a message suddenly came to him.

The Celestial Master’s expression changed and he took out a token immediately.

“Empyrean Patriarch?” asked Celestial Master Winter Whistle, feeling surprised.

He had seen Empyrean Patriarch once before personally, but they were not really acquainted with one another. He possessed the Message Token because Empyrean Patriarch had some issues with the Ancient Monster Clan in the past.

Even so, Celestial Master Winter Whistle knew about the bounty of 20 Chaos Gems that he had placed on Jian Wushuang. He had already known what he wanted.

“Empyrean Patriarch, are you here for that Jian Wushuang?” Celestial Master Winter Whistle transmitted his reply.

“Yes,” replied Empyrean Patriarch. “He killed my son, and naturally, I have to kill him to take revenge for my son. I heard that you’re after him as well, and unless I’m mistaken, you’ve already locked on to his position, right?”

“Indeed I am,” nodded Celestial Master Winter Whistle.

“Tell me his current location. I want to cut that young fool into pieces!” said Empyrean Patriarch coldly.

“I can tell you his position, but I hope that you can assure the safety of Dao Master Nine Sword when you strike, Empyrean Patriarch,” replied Celestial Master Winter Whistle.

“Oh? He’s not dead yet?” said Empyrean Patriarch as he laughed nonchalantly, but he then nodded and continued, “I promise you!”

“That’s good. His current location is…”

Celestial Master Winter Whistle showed Empyrean Patriarch where Jian Wushuang currently was.

Empyrean Patriarch hurried to the location with a few experts.

“Haha, it just happens that the young fool is fleeing toward my current spot. If everything goes as expected, we will meet soon,” Empyrean Patriarch said in a clear voice.

“Empyrean Patriarch, please remember to ensure that Dao Master Nine Sword will be safe,” Celestial Master Winter Whistle kept reminding.

Under the infinite Void was a vast plain.

Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a blood-red long robe and carrying a longsword on his back, was traversing forward at great speed.

“I’ve lost exactly four hours since subduing Jiu Xiu. I believe the expert from the Ancient Monster Clan is nearby now,” muttered Jian Wushuang.

When he lifted his head, however, he could clearly see a headstrong old man with neat, short hair and a slender face standing at the peak of a hill at the far end of his view.

The elder was as sharp as an eagle and he looked directly toward Jian Wushuang, his sight piercing through the Void.

Just his gaze alone made Jian Wushuang feel fearful without being aware of it.

He had stopped abruptly and looked at the elder too.

“I’m… Empyrean Patriarch!”

An angry voice rang out, and it sounded like the endless rumbling of thunder bursting forth from the endless Void, passing to Jian Wushuang’s ears at the same time.

“Empyrean Patriarch?”?thought Jian Wushuang as he got a huge shock.
