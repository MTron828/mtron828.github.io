Chapter 5473 ¬†Blood Demon

This is the Blood Demon!

One of the five ancient Demon Lords, the Blood Demon.

A figure similar to Shan Jun.

Jian Wushuang stabilized his figure, not only did he not move, but his divine body was pushed to the extreme, ready to risk his life at any moment to break through.

As for the front, he dared not move forward even if he were beaten to death.

But now, the retreat path was blocked by the Nine-Headed Blood Demon.

The shock and fear filled Wanyan's eyes. The two of them had been followed by such a creature all the way, and they didn't even notice it.

Perhaps they encountered this thing from the very beginning when they encountered the blood.

"What should we do?" Jian Wushuang dared not breathe heavily and conveyed through sound transmission.

The front was simply impassable; going forward meant certain death.

Going back meant facing the Nine-Headed Blood Demon.

A stalemate ensued here.

They couldn't sense the opponent's aura. However, for someone who could be on par with Shan Jun, Jian Wushuang knew they were definitely not an opponent.

"We'll fight our way out?" Wanyan replied uncertainly.

He was also frightened and unsure of what to do.

Wanyan knew less than Jian Wushuang. He was unaware of the origin of the monster in front of him. It had probably been silently following them for a long time, undetected. Its strength certainly surpassed theirs by a lot.

Trying to break through was not very likely.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. His suspended body slowly approached the wall, gesturing for Wanyan to approach the other side of the wall.

His intention was for the two of them to retreat along the wall.

Although somewhat disoriented, now they could only step back and take it one step at a time!

What if all of this was just an illusion?

Jian Wushuang prayed in his heart, hoping that they could safely retreat. If they couldn't, then he would plunge into the blood ahead.

Fortune favors the bold.

Just as he was stepping back, a voice shattered his illusion.

"Hehe, it's the aura of Shan Jun. Kid, what's your relationship with Shan Jun?" One of the heads among the Nine Blood Demons approached Jian Wushuang, greedily sniffing.

The voice was sharp, and Jian Wushuang's ears buzzed.

Upon hearing the question, Jian Wushuang dared not continue retreating. Originally prepared to escape, upon hearing the name of Shan Jun, he suddenly had some room to maneuver.

"Senior Blood Demon, I have a close relationship with Shan Jun!" Jian Wushuang respectfully replied.

On the side, Wanyan breathed a sigh of relief when he heard that Jian Wushuang could actually establish a connection here.

However, the demon's next sentence directly made their hearts jump to their throats.

"Old Seven, why bother with words? Since they're related to Shan Jun, we must devour them!" said a female head with numerous braids like hemp ropes on her head, her eyes waxen.

Jian Wushuang cursed under his breath, "Not good!"

Originally, he had thought of building connections, but now he encountered the mortal enemy of Shan Jun.

This might be a bit tricky.

"Senior, I..." Wanyan wanted to say that he didn't even know who Shan Jun was.

But before the words could come out, sharp teeth bit into his neck. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Similarly, on Jian Wushuang's side, his blood was being voraciously consumed by the demon.

However, the two of them discovered that the Blood Demon could only devour their blood; their divine bodies and origin sources were directly separated from their flesh, and the blood-sucking posed no threat whatsoever.

Blood Demon seemed oblivious, holding their flesh and chewing voraciously.

"Whew!"

So exhilarating.

Watching their flesh perish while they remained unharmed.

"Let's go!"

They exchanged glances, without much communication, and continued forward.

With furrowed brows, they charged into the blood, relying on faint senses to guide them through the walk.

"Dao Friend Wanyan, don't walk too fast!" Jian Wushuang felt a phantom ahead, moving swiftly, so he transmitted to Wanyan.

Wanyan paused, halting his steps, and expressed surprise, "But I'm behind you!"

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang also froze.

Wanyan was behind him?

Blocked by the blood, they could only rely on faint senses to detect each other as they moved through it.

Wanyan was behind him, so who was ahead?

Regardless, they needed to leave this place first.

This time, Jian Wushuang accelerated, as someone ahead was exploring, making him more audacious in his movements.

After not too long, they finally managed to leave this pool of blood.

Phew!

After taking a breath of fresh air, Jian Wushuang's divine body felt a bit ethereal.

Finally, he had come out.

Just as he emerged, a figure approached from the front, and a strong aura rushed toward him.

"Stop!" Jian Wushuang angrily shouted. He retreated, pressing against the wall, and his physical body instantly recovered, startling the approaching figure.

Jian Wushuang had a body tempered in the Ten Trials, and both the Origin Source and the divine body contained the power of the physical body. Even if he completely lost his physical body, he could still recover.

The reason he didn't immediately recover earlier was to prevent the Blood Demon from devouring him again.

Now, facing the opponent's attack, he didn't hesitate. He directly restored his physical body and struck out with a punch.

Crash!

A loud noise sent the phantom attacking him flying.

Wanyan, who arrived later and saw Jian Wushuang's move, was also nervous. He looked up at the flying phantom.

"Dongsheng!" Wanyan exclaimed in surprise.

Walking ahead of them was none other than Emperor Dongsheng, the first to enter the Demon Sound Hall.

Puff!

As Dongsheng, looking somewhat embarrassed after getting up, saw Wanyan and Jian Wushuang, he was astonished. "It's you guys!"

The three reunited!

They each recounted their experiences.

Pretty similar.

Their experiences were almost the same.

However, Dongsheng, unlike the two of them, was not as miserable initially. After the bridge collapsed, he swam directly through the magma.

He encountered a genuine desolate beast, and it was only through sheer luck that he managed to get through.

This was also the reason for his surprise.

Because of Jian Wushuang and Wanyan's strength, a 99 percent chance of perishing awaited anyone who tried to cross.

"Hmph, the opportunities here don't seem all that impressive. Instead of straightforward, it's all twisty and turny. Looks like I've come to the wrong place this time."

It seemed that Dongsheng hadn't obtained the universe source stone; otherwise, he wouldn't speak like this.

The reason they coveted the Demon Sound Hall was twofold: firstly, because no one could enter, and secondly, when acknowledged by the Origin Source, the token rewarded contained the Universe Origin Source. They had never seen such a scarce resource before. They were all stubbornly persisting, hoping to enter the Demon Sound Hall and obtain more of the Universe Origin Source.

In the river of time they were in, there was no Universe Master, and the Universe Origin Source was only present in the Original Universe. However, the consciousness of the Original Universe was peculiar. It could nurture various treasures, but obtaining its Origin Source was extremely difficult.

No one had yet acquired the Origin Source of the Orignial Universe.

Jian Wushuang saw that this time he gained the most. Not only did his soul improve, but he also acquired tens of thousands of universe source stones. He felt that this place was quite good.

Of course, compared to the Three Kings Court in the Western Sea, it was still far behind.

Unfortunately, the Three Kings Court had fallen into the chaos of temporal currents. It was unknown whether it had been salvaged by Zhen Ling.
