Chapter 1843: Extremely Rich

“Sword Emperor, are you for real?” Emperor God Jiu Yin’s eyes glowed brilliantly and he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang laughed, “Moreover, if you were to be a Guest Elder of the Lineage of Star, you would also have the chance the cultivate the Secret Skill of Star Palace of the Lineage of Star.”

“The Secret Skill of Star Palace?” Emperor God Jiu Yin’s eyes turned red at once and his breathing became heavier.

A Chaos Divine Treasure-level defense armor was extremely attractive to him. After all, most of the Emperor Gods which was inclusive of some Peak Emperor Gods, did not possess a Chaos Divine Treasure-level defense armor. For example, Fortress Master Hong Tian did not have one.

Moreover, the Secret Skill of Star Palace was even more impressive and even Great Emperors drooled at the Secret Skill of Star Palace. As such, he naturally yearned to cultivate it as well.

So, as long as he agreed to become a Guest Elder of the Lineage of Star, he would be able to obtain all these?

Things were really falling into his lap.

“Of course, for the Secret Skill of Star Palace, at the very least, you must become a Guest Elder of the Lineage of Star for a hundred thousand years and also make some contributions to the Lineage of Star before you are able to cultivate it. As for the defense armor, I can give it to you right away,” Jian Wushuang said.

After taking a deep breath, Emperor God Jiu Yin looked at Jian Wushuang again, “Sword Emperor, thank you for thinking so highly of me. The conditions that you have given me are too alluring and I am absolutely unable to find a reason to refuse your offer. However, because of that, I find it a bit embarrassing. How about this? Give me some time. It will not take too long, at most thousands of years. Then, I will definitely come to the Lineage of Star and I will also bring the Lineage of Star a great present. With that, I will have the right to become a Guest Elder of the Lineage of Star.”

“No problem,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened up. After that, he flipped his palm and some black armor appeared in his hands.

The moment the black armor appeared, Emperor God Jiu Yin’s eyes were attracted to it right away.

He could already tell that the black armor was of the level of a Chaos Divine Treasure.

“I will give this armor to you first,” Jian Wushuang passed the black armor to Emperor God Jiu Yin.

“This…” Emperor God Jiu Yin hesitated slightly, “Sword Emperor, I have yet to join the Lineage of Star for real. This armor…”

“It is merely a Chaos Divine Treasure-level armor and it is nothing much. Just accept it,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Upon seeing that, Emperor God Jiu Yin stopped refusing him.

When Emperor God Liu Guang, who was at the side, saw the scene, she could not help but gasp, “It is a Chaos Divine Treasure-level armor and you gave it away so easily. You are really liberal with your wealth. Moreover, if I am not wrong, the armor that you are wearing is of the level of a Chaos Divine Treasure as well. Haha. Even though some Peak Emperor Gods have paid a huge price, it is still very difficult for them to obtain such a kind of armor. For example, Emperor God Tian Xiao of the Soaring Heaven King Palace only possessed one because of the great foundation of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, as well as Emperor God Tian Ling.”

“However, Sword Emperor, you alone possess two such armors. This really makes us envious of you.”

“Emperor God Liu Guang, if you really need it, I am willing to give you the same conditions and also add on some Chaos Divine Treasure-level attack weapons. Why don’t Emperor God Liu Guang come to the Lineage of Star and become a Guest Elder as well?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Upon hearing that, Emperor God Liu Guang was attracted as well.

From Jian Wushuang’s words, she could tell that Jian Wushuang still had Chaos Divine Treasure-level armors. Moreover, he had a few attack weapons.

With so many treasures with him, he was not concerned in the slightest. This had caused Emperor God Liu Guang to be extremely surprised.

In actual fact, Jian Wushuang indeed did not care about those treasures.

It should be known that he had searched the ancient battlefield in his hometown for six thousand years alone.

For that ancient battlefield, no Almighties had gone to search it. As such, a large number of treasures and opportunities remained there in one piece, they were all waiting for Jian Wushuang to get them.

In just a short six thousand years’ time, he had searched many special pieces. As such, how many treasures and opportunities had he obtained?

In particular, in one of the special places, he had obtained a total of seven Chaos Divine Treasure in one go and there were two armors among them.

Moreover, including Fortress Master Hong Tian, he had killed a total of four Emperor Gods and obtained three Chaos Divine Treasures. By adding all of them up, Jian Wushuang possessed more than twenty Chaos Divine Treasure and among them, there were four armors!

With so many Chaos Divine Treasure on hand, Jian Wushuang could be said to be extremely rich. As such, he would of course not be stingy with regards to one or two armors.

After all, the Lineage of Star’s situation then was not normal. If he were able to use one or two Chaos Divine Treasures to win an Emperor God over, he would have benefited greatly.

However, it was a pity that Emperor God Liu Guang shook her head and declined. “Be it attack weapons or defense armors, I have all of them already. Moreover, I do not like to participate in fights between the powerhouses or sects. Hence, I can only thank Sword Emperor for your good offer.”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang could not do anything at all.

“No matter what, Emperor God Liu Guang has helped me greatly this time around and I will definitely remember this favor of yours. In the future, if you have something you need help with, please go ahead and instruct me,” Jian Wushuang said.

Emperor God Liu Guang nodded her head.

The ancient silver spaceship left the Abysmal Sanctuary in no time.

After leaving the Abysmal Sanctuary, Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin bided farewell to Jian Wushuang. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Of course, before leaving, all of them exchanged their transmission tokens.

“Sword Emperor, within the next thousands of years, I, Jiu Yin, will definitely go to the Lineage of Star,” Emperor God Jiu Yin said earnestly.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

The two of them left in a jiffy and Jian Wushuang also started to head back to the Lineage of Star.

In no time, the news of Jian Wushuang inviting Emperor God Liu Guang, Emperor God Jiu Yin and bringing four battle puppets to fight their way into the Deluge Fortress and then killing the thirteen Emperor Gods, including Fortress Master Hong Tian, spread.

The whole Sanctuary Alliance and the whole Eternal Chaotic World burst into an uproar instantly.

…

Colored Glaze Sanctuary, within the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Emperor God Tian Xiao was drinking tea with Sir God Xuan Bing and Sir God Qian Ren, who had just joined the Soaring Heaven King Palace. At the same time, they were also chatting.

“Hmph, that Jian Wushuang is really extremely arrogant. Fortress Master Hong Tian, Emperor God Bing Can and the eleven Almighties under them. With such a frightening lineup, even the Soaring Heaven King Palace would be a bit afraid of them. However, this brat actually said that he would fight his way into the Deluge Fortress within ten years? And kill these thirteen Almighties? Where did his courage come from?” Emperor God Tian Xiao snorted coldly.

“This Jian Wushuang’s speed of growth is too fast. Moreover, he killed two Emperor Gods previously. As such, he is blind and extremely arrogant. According to what I know, when he made his decision and said those words, he did not consult the Star Palace Master or the Almighties in the Lineage of Star at all and he merely made the decision himself. Haha. Who does he think he is? Even if it were the Star Palace Master, I reckon that he wouldn’t be so daring as to do that?” Sir God Xuan Bing laughed coldly.

“I reckon that the Star Palace Master and the Almighties of the Lineage of Star are probably so scared that they are unable to find a place to cry in?” Sir God Qian Lan sneered.

However, just then, a piece of news was sent to the three of them at almost the same time.

“Jian Wushuang has already fought his way into the Deluge Fortress. Fortress Master Hong Tian, Emperor God Bing Can and the eleven Sir Gods under them are all dead!”

“None of them has escaped!”

Upon getting the news, the smile on the faces of the three of them, who were originally sneering wantonly, froze instantly.
