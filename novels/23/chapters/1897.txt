Chapter 1898: Retreat!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Lineage of Star shouldn’t have walked out of their own lair. If they were to stay in their lair, they might have been able to match evenly with Star Extermination Alliance via their formation. But now…”

“Lineage of Star’s action isn’t very wise.”

“From the looks of it, Lineage of Star is going to be defeated.

“It is definite that they are going to be defeated. However, Sword Emperor from Lineage of Star is really impressive.”

“Sword Emperor…”

Everyone who was watching the war focused their attention on the battlefield where Jian Wushuang and the other three Peak Emperor Gods were. When they saw Jian Wushuang and the other three Peak Emperor Gods in a fierce fight, it stirred up a great commotion in the expert’s heart.

“With his power alone, he fought evenly with three Peak Emperor Gods. It seems that he doesn’t have the lower hand much. Sword Emperor is very impressive!”

“Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King from Divine King Island and also the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church, their names are famous and they have many techniques and skills. However, even when the three of them team up, they can’t take down Jian Wushuang.”

“Just how does Jian Wushuang cultivate? Isn’t his improvement speed too fast?”

Everyone was surprised.

They could see clearly that Jian Wushuang was fighting against three alone and he didn’t have the lower hand.

Such battle outcome shocked everyone.

One should know that, on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, only Underworld God who was widely known as the number one Emperor God had once fought evenly with three Peak Emperor Gods alone. However, not only had Underworld God matched evenly with the three Emperor Gods, but he had also defeated them directly and even killed two out of three of them.

Jian Wushuang might not be comparable with Underworld God. However, he was about there.

On the battlefield, the three Peak Emperor Gods from the enemy’s side had teamed up but couldn’t do anything to Jian Wushuang. The three Peak Emperor God were furious.

“Don’t waste any more time on him. Launch a full attack and kill him. If we don’t take him down now, the three of our Peak Emperor Gods’ names will be ruined,” Number One Divine King roared. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Alright,” the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church nodded heavily.

As for Palace Master Wu Luo, he had the intention but not the will

He was fighting against Jian Wushuang’s four Hong Jun Golden Swords and he was already going all-out.

“Die!”

Number One Divine King roared and he turned into a saber himself.

A life-destroying saber that wanted to shake off the shackles of heaven and earth.

The saber contained life-destroying aura that was enough to shock one’s mind.

As for the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church, he looked imposing and the aura that was soaring from his body was impressive.

His eyes were like lightning. In one hand that he flipped open, there was boundless golden light flowing.

“Palm of Real Martial Arts!”

Hong!

The sky broke and the earth split.

A huge handprint which was extremely imposing descended from above from nowhere.

Palm of Real Martial Arts was the strongest unique skill that the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church had created.

There were two terrifying attacks that flew at Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Haha, come on!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were bloodshot but there was no fear.

The billowing divine power and bloodline power were flowing out in madness.

Before everyone’s gazes, one of his hands slowly extended. On one of his fingers, there was in intense black jade light.

The black jade light seemed to light up the entire universe.

“Ancient God… the eighth finger!”

“The Universe Finger!”

Hong!

An ancient black jade finger suddenly attacked.

Ancient God finger was the strongest move in terms of power in Ancient God unique skill.

Nine fingers of Ancient God, each stronger than the last.

Especially the last three fingers.

Merely the third finger, Vault of Heaven’s Finger, was already comparable with many unique skills that Emperor Gods had created.

As for the eighth finger, one finger daunted the universe.

The power was infinite.

With one finger, the universe shook, heaven and earth broke apart.

In an instant, it collided with the full hits launched by the two Peak Emperor Gods.

The terrifying power swept out.

At that moment, all living things in the universe lost their colors.

The bang that wasn’t as loud as any of them had imagined. However, when they collided, there was instantly a merciless black hole that took form. The space black hole magnified infinitely to swallow up everything in the universe.

The fierce divine power swept across wantonly.

At the border of the battlefield, there were four Sir Gods who were fighting ferociously and two Dao soldiers that were swept out. The four Sir Gods got injured while the two Dao soldiers flew out.

Swoosh!

A figure flew across the sky like a shooting star. It flew about ten thousand miles until it finally stopped in the void.

The figure belonged to Jian Wushuang.

Although his face grew pale, his aura was still rather strong.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Four Hong Jun Golden Swords had already returned to his side.

In the void far ahead of him, the three Peak Emperor Gods stood side by side and their faces looked cold.

The three of them had already gone all-out and they had even performed their strongest unique skill but they merely had the upper hand by a slight bit. They weren’t even enough to injure Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s strength surprised the three Peak Emperor Gods.

“If we were to fight with him one on one, any one of us could only flee in a fix when we met him,” Number One Divine King couldn’t help but say.

“Forget about fighting him alone, even if we were to team up in pairs, we wouldn’t win against him,” Palace Master Wu Luo said.

If they only paired up, Jian Wushuang’s four Hong Jun Golden Swords would be freed and then he could totally fight the two of them at the same time and he would definitely have the upper hand.

However, the three of them made up a team of three Peak Emperor Gods after all.

“Palace Master, we can’t do this anymore!”

There was a sudden roar and Jian Wushuang’s face changed as he looked around anxiously.

Both campsites were fighting furiously. Although it was merely a short while, Star Extermination Alliance’s advantage was magnified.

Lineage of Star already looked like they were going to be defeated.

“Retreat!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang immediately commanded them to retreat while he tried his best to open up a route for escape in order to help the experts and Dao soldiers from Lineage of Star to flee.

“Retreat! Retreat!”

Everyone from Lineage of Star immediately started to retreat.

Everyone was decisive to retreat. They didn’t delay any further.

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance saw and let out a chilly gleam in their eyes.

“Haha, you want to retreat now? It’s too late!”

“Die! Everyone, head into the lair of Lineage of Star and kill everyone in Lineage of Star!”

“Kill everyone. Don’t leave anyone behind!”

“Die!”

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance started chasing after them under the lead of the three Peak Emperor Gods.

Jian Wushuang led the experts from Lineage of Star to retreat into Universe Galaxy. Star Extermination Alliance naturally chased after them.

“Hall Master Yuan, it’s your call now,” Jian Wushuang sent a message to Hall Master Yuan.

“Don’t worry, let me take care of this!” Hall Master Yuan’s voice was solemn but he was confident.
