“Five years?”

Jian Nantian looked at Jian Wushuang. After perceiving the determination in his gaze, he could not help but nod. “I’m looking forward to it.”

On hearing this, Wang Yuan could not help but acclaim.?“In the whole Nanyang Continent, I’m afraid that only Jian Wushuang and his father dare to say that they would trample Holy Emperor Palace underfoot in five years.”

Jian Nantian turned over his hand and took a manual out of his Interspatial Ring. “Here you are.”

“This is...?” Jian Wushuang took it with a hint of curiosity in his eyes.

“A top expert kept a record of some tips about the Origin. I found it when traveling around. Now it’s useless for me, but will be helpful for you,” Jian Nantian said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and immediately accepted it.

Jian Nantian brought a pot of wine and said, “Shuang’er, let’s have a drink.”

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded and took the wine pot.

After drinking a pot of wine, Jian Nantian smiled slightly and said, “Shuang’er, you need to depend on yourself from now on. I hope you will trample Holy Emperor Palace underfoot in five years. I’ll wait for you.”

Then his body flashed, and he left with the wind.

Jian Nantian desired freedom.

He was destined to rove the world.

Jian Wushuang stood still in the room and watched his father disappear with tears in his eyes.

“I’ll catch up with you in five years.”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly, with his hands clenched.

After a while, Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan sat down at the same time.

“Third Younger Brother, what are you going to do?” Wang Yuan asked.

Jian Wushuang’s face fell and answered, “I originally planned to look for a strong sect to improve my strength, but now I have offended Holy Emperor Palace. I’m afraid few sects will accept me in the Nanyang Continent.”

He spoke the truth.

Holy Emperor Palace was known as the overlord of the Nanyang Continent, so few sects dared to protect the person that was being hunted by Holy Emperor Palace.

“Alchemy School was able to protect you, but it’s up to my father. I’ve mentioned you to him, yet he just smiled, without saying a word,” Wang Yuan said discontentedly.

Jian Wushuang kept silent.

“Third Younger Brother, you can not enter those sects, but I know a place where you can practice. It might be not worse than those sects you want to join,” Wang Yuan suddenly said.

“Where?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked toward him.

“Tang of the East, the first empire in the Nanyang Continent,” Wang Yuan replied seriously.

“The first empire?” Jian Wushuang asked with a doubt.

“The Tang Dynasty was known as the first empire in the whole Nanyang Continent. It covers a vast land, which was over 10 times larger than any other large empires. Moreover, it’s full of experts, so it’s much stronger than the other old sects.

“The forces of the Nanyang Continent belonged to one palace, one school, three valleys and four temples, eight sects, and thousands of Dynasties. In fact, as for the overall strength, the Tang Dynasty is definitely superior to the three valleys. Even our Alchemy School and Holy Emperor Palace hold the Tang Dynasty in awe,” Wang Yuan said.

“It’s so strong?”?Jian Wushuang was surprised secretly.

“The Tang Dynasty has another two names, the Slaughterous Dynasty and the Country of Death!” Wang Yuan said in a low voice.

He continued, “The other empires of the Nanyang Continent follow the law of the jungle, but they have a bottom line and set some rules for themselves. In contrast, there are no rules or bottom lines in the Tang Dynasty. The strong have all the say.

“As long as you are strong, no one cares even if you slaughter in the palace of the Tang Dynasty.

“If you’re strong enough, you can slaughter thousands of Warriors or wipe out cities one by one as you like.

“No rules or constraints. It’s up to your strength.

“Therefore, it could be compared to Shuraba.

“The more chaotic a place is, the more appealing it will be for militant warriors. A large number of warriors go to the Tang Dynasty every day. Many warriors die there, so it’s known as the Country of Death.

“It’s a paradise for killers and hell for the merciful.”

A glimpse of crazy battle intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“The Slaughterous Dynasty?”

“The Country of Death?”

“It’s a paradise for killers and hell for the merciful?”

“There exists an empire like that in the Nanyang Continent?”

“It’s crazy and horrible in the Tang Dynasty. With countless experts, it would be the most suitable place for cultivation. The second younger brother has been brought there by Wine Master,” Wang Yuan said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The second younger brother has gone there too?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows. In fact, he was already at fever pitch.

He was adept at Sword Principle. Sword Principle was used for killing.

He also comprehended Slaughter Source.

He was born to be a fighter.

The place might be unacceptable for ordinary warriors, but it was a place he was longing for. Without the threat from Holy Emperor Palace, he would desire to go there. Now since he was completely targeted by Holy Emperor Palace and places for his practice were limited, the Tang Dynasty would be his best choice.

“I have decided to go to the Tang Dynasty,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

Wang Yuan shrugged his shoulders, as he knew Jian Wushuang would go.

“Third Younger Brother, if you go to the Tang Dynasty, you’ll pass by the Northern Region. I happen to have one thing that needs your help. I believe you won’t refuse my request,” Wang Yuan said with a smile.

“Oh? Say it.” Jian Wushuang looked toward Wang Yuan.

Wang Yuan began to narrate the whole story.

“You must know the whole setup of the Nanyang Continent. Our Alchemy School has kept a delicate relationship with Holy Emperor Palace. We’ve never started a war, but we have an explicit or implicit contest with each other. The Wilderness Sword Sect, one of the top sects...

“The disciples of the Wilderness Sword Sect have been disappointing these years. The sect has declined, so it will be expelled from the eight sects, but during this period, it seems that the Wilderness Sword Sect got support from Holy Emperor Palace because of you.

“Our Alchemy School doesn’t want to see the Wilderness Sword Sect became the Holy Emperor Palace’s affiliate, so we want to remove it using special tactics. We’ll take action in a month, so I need your help.

“Do you want to go against Holy Emperor Palace? You can wipe out the Wilderness Sword Sect first at your convenience.”
