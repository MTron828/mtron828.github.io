Chapter 2349: Jian Wushuang And Xiang Yi

In the air before the Lin Mansion’s doors, a total of eight figures stood upright.

Other than Xiang Zong, the family head of Xiang Family, and that burly old man, the remaining six were all wearing uniform golden robes. At the back of the golden robes and between their two sleeves, there was an embroidered picture of a small black cauldron.

The small cauldron was the identifying symbol of the Golden Cauldron Sect. Clearly, six of them were from the Golden Cauldron Sect. Moreover, judging from the auras that were emanating from them, they were all Chaotic Divine Demons.

It was especially so for an ominous-looking young man with black hair and a bald man carrying a sabre.

The auras from the two of them overwhelmed everyone around. Without a doubt, they were Second Grade Divine Demons.

That ominous-looking young man with black hair was none other than Xiang Yi from the Xiang Family!

“There are two Second Grade Divine Demons?”

Jian Wushuang and the other experts of Lin Mansion appeared before the mansion’s door. Sensing the powerful auras of the six Golden Cauldron Sect experts, many Lin Mansion experts paled.

Even Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows.

If there was only one Second Grade Divine Demon, he wouldn’t be that worried. However, if both of them teamed up, he would probably be under pressure.

Although the remaining four were Third Grade Divine Demons, their auras weren’t ordinary. Two of them weren’t inferior to Lin Tiefeng. Clearly, they were also the most elite Third Grade Divine Demons.

This line-up was extremely strong and it would be easy for them to sweep through any family in Anjiu Prefecture.

“This looks like trouble!”

Lin Tiefeng was flabbergasted as he stared deadly at the eight Chaotic Divine Demons. Although he knew the answer, he still asked, “Xiang Zong, what does your Xiang Family want?”

“What do I want? Hehe.” Xiang Zong replied with a cold smirk. “Lin Tiefeng, we will put aside the feud between our Xiang Family and Lin Mansion. Today, we are here for him! Jian Wushuang!!”

“So you are Jian Wushuang?”” Xiang Yi’s eyes were chilling as he turned to face Jian Wushuang.

“Yeah, I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded indifferently.

“So you are the one who killed my sister?” Intense killing intention showed in Xiang Yi’s eyes.

“If you are speaking of the Divine Demon Realm expert that I killed from the Xiang Family, you are right. I killed her,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“How dare you kill my sister!! If I can’t break your bones and burn you to ashes today, then my name’s not Xiang Yi!” Xiang Yi screeched, overwhelmed with bloodlust.

“Xiang Yi.” Fire Fairy took a step forward and said, “There must be a misunderstanding here. Jian Wushuang is a distinguished guest of our Thunder Sound Sect. Could you do my Thunder Sound Sect a favor today?”

“Do a favour for Thunder Sound Sect? Hah! How hilarious! What’s your Thunder Sound Sect?” Xiang Yi scoffed. “Even if he’s a core disciple of Thunder Sound Sect or a disciple of some Elders or sect leader, he will have to die since he killed my sister! Moreover, I know he isn’t related to the Thunder Sound Sect! Fire Fairy, step aside now! Otherwise, I’ll kill you as well!”

Xiang Yi had been blinded by anger and wasn’t afraid of Fire Fairy or the Thunder Sound Sect behind her.

This was important. Although Thunder Sound Sect was a respectable sect, there was a huge difference between the Golden Cauldron Sect and Thunder Sound Sect.

Xiang Yi was the Enforcement Elder of the Golden Cauldron Sect. Why would he be bothered by the insignificant Fire Fairy?

Fire Fairy’s eyes turned icy cold. She took a glance at Jian Wushuang and remarked solemnly, “Wushuang, I’m asking you for the last time. Are you willing to come to Thunder Sound Sect with me?”

She had made up her mind. Once Jian Wushuang agreed, she would protect Jian Wushuang at all costs. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, if Jian Wushuang refused, she wouldn’t want to be involved in this incident.

“I’m sorry. I’m not interested in the Thunder Sound Sect for now.” Jian Wushuang shook his head without even hesitating.

“Alright then. You’re on your own for now.” Fire Fairy was enraged and no longer cared about Jian Wushuang’s life and death. She stepped aside.

“I’m glad you know what’s the best thing to do.” Xiang Yi looked mockingly at Fire Fairy before turning to Jian Wushuang. “Brat, speak now! How do you want to die?”

“Hehe! You think you can kill me?” Jian Wushuang scoffed. “Spare me the nonsense. If you want to kill me, just come for me. A total of six Divine Demon Realm experts have come from your Golden Cauldron Sect. Together with the two Divine Demon Realm experts from Xiang Family, you guys can come at the same time.”

“At the same time?”

Those who heard him were shocked.

Among the eight Chaotic Divine Demons, there were 2 Second Grade Divine Demons, 2 elite Third Grade Divine Demons and the remaining 4 weren’t weak at all. Jian Wushuang wanted to take them all at the same time?

Was he really that confident?

“Tsk! You aren’t qualified for us to team up against you. I alone am enough to kill you.” Xiang Yi snorted and charged towards Jian Wushuang.

As for those around him, none of them moved.

Regardless of if they were from the Xiang Family or Golden Cauldron Sect, they had absolute confidence in Xiang Yi. In their eyes, Xiang Yi was more than enough to kill Jian Wushuang.

It was especially so for those from the Golden Cauldron Sect. They could all see that Jian Wushuang was just at the Chaotic Realm.

Although they had heard of Jian Wushuang’s strength from Xiang Zong personally, they were skeptical. After all, they had not witnessed it with their own eyes.

In the air, Xiang Yi moved like a phantom. In an instant, he arrived before Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he clenched his fist and an explosive power gathered in his hand. This power had the attributes of lightning.

All of a sudden, the fist went straight for Jian Wushuang.

Terrifying strength exploded in that instant.

Completely overwhelming strength!

A Second Grade Divine Demon wasn’t just better than a Third Grade Divine Demon in the aspect of Rules of Order. In terms of divine power, a Second Grade Divine Demon’s divine power was purer and denser.

In terms of pure strength, a Second Grade Divine Demon would have an absolute advantage.

“I wonder how much stronger a Second Grade Divine Demon is compared to a Third Grade Divine Demon?” Jian Wushuang was curious as he swung his fist. Gathering pure divine power in his palm, he lunged ahead violently and his strength exploded violently.

Two huge fists collided like two huge meteorites.

Peng!

Following a loud boom, ripples could be vaguely seen in the atmosphere. At the same time, everyone could hear the strong compression of energy.

Immediately after, Jian Wushuang flew back like a cannonball.

From the door of the Lin Mansion, he barely stopped even after reaching the center of the Lin Mansion.

After stabilizing himself, Jian Wushuang took a glance at his right hand. He could feel pulses of pain in his arm and joints.

As for Xiang Yi, he looked perfectly fine.

“A Second Grade Divine Demon is indeed something. In terms of intensity of strength, he’s way stronger than a Third Grade Divine Demon,” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.
