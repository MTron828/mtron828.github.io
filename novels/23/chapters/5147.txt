Chapter 5150 - 5150: Eternal Tower

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Emperor Zhutian had long achieved the fifth tier as an Emperor, emerging from the Original Universe and venturing into the River of Time within the space-time continuum. Now, with the emergence of the Qishen Temple, the controller of the Eternal Tower immediately informed his master. However, even a fifth-tier Emperor would require a million years to return from the River of Time to the Original Universe.

They had no choice but to let them explore the Qishen Temple first.

“Demon Lord Fengyu!’

Inside the temporary headquarters of the alliance, a terrifying old man appeared outside the Eternal Tower with just a flicker of his figure.

The name Eternal Tower came from the magnificent divine tower before the old man.

This was the Eternal Treasure that Emperor Zhutian obtained from the River of Time, a creation of the mythical Universe Master.

Even a fifth-tier Emperor would covet such a treasure because it was crafted by the Universe Master, containing the Great Dao of the universe within. It allowed one to comprehend their own Great Dao and suppress all things.

The tower had nine levels, and only a fourth-tier Emperor like Emperor Zhutian could fully unleash the power of the Eternal Tower.

“Chishui, are you going to be an enemy of our Eternal Tower?” Inside the eighth level of the Eternal Tower, Ruler Fengyu shouted angrily. Fengyu was dressed in a long green robe.

She was one of the few female Emperors among the fourth-tier Emperors. Her delicate face frequently changed, and even the weaker Emperors couldn’t see her true appearance clearly.

“I have no choice. A group of little fellows has caught the old man’s attention and insisted on dragging me into their affairs. So, the old man had to step forward,” Wanderer Chishui said with a faint smile.

He was originally a lone traveler from the Eastern Domain. His homeland world had long been destroyed, but he had mastered a secret realm. Although he hadn’t mastered a domain, his strength was that of a genuine fourth-tier top Emperor.

“Oh, since that’s the case, then you’re going to be our enemy!” The expression on Demon Lord Fengyu’s face gradually turned cold.

She earned her title of ‘Demon Lord’ through ruthless means, capitalizing on her brutal tactics. When the Emperors of the Eastern Domain had risen like mushrooms after the rain, she had started looking for high- grade worlds everywhere, trying to seize control opportunistically.

One fourth-tier Emperor, who had achieved mastery in the second- grade

Dao, directly took control of a high- grade world within the scope of the Eternal Tower’s influence and even killed the guardians of the Eternal Tower in that area.

In that era, fifth-tier Emperors entered the River of Time one after another.

The peak forces were momentarily without the presence of these fifth-tier Emperors. Many powerful rulers and Emperors began to detach themselves from the Eternal Tower. At that time, Demon Lord Fengyu was just a Ruler of a high- grade world, his strength merely ordinary among the fourth-tier.

Many of the strong individuals within the Eternal Tower were not convinced.

However, due to her status as the direct disciple of Emperor Zhutian, some people, while not daring to rebel openly, secretly refused to obey her commands.

Without the direct suppression of fifth-tier Emperors, the peak forces were on the verge of collapse. Both internal pressure and external threats required her strength to be validated.

Coincidentally, a top third-tier Emperor appeared, giving her a target to establish her dominance.

This third-tier Emperor first killed the second-tier Emperor guarding the higher world and then took control of the higher world himself.

Although many Emperors emerged during that era, there were still very few who could successfully reach the second-tier through the harmony of their

Dao. Therefore, many higher worlds remained ownerless. As a peak force, the Eternal Tower naturally saw the potential in these higher worlds. They took control of several surrounding higher worlds and planned to have Emperors from their own faction govern these worlds in the future.

This third-tier Emperor was extremely arrogant. After taking control of the higher world, he directly advanced to the fourth-tier Emperor, becoming a Ruler. He thought little of Demon Lord Fengyu and began to provoke the Eternal Tower.

In his Dao Arena, the fourth-tier Emperor who ruled the higher world was considered the ceiling of power at that time. Even within the Eternal Tower, there were only three Rulers.

However, Demon Lord Fengyu managed to manipulate the Eternal Tower and enter that higher world. No one knew what happened inside, but when the

Demon Lord Fengyu came out, the higher world had already become a ruin. One higher world had been destroyed like this.

Since that incident, no one in the Eternal Tower dared to act recklessly, and the Fengyu became the Demon Lord Fengyu.

In the chaotic era of the Eastern Doomain, the number of Emperors who died at her hands was in the double digits.

In contrast, the Wanderer Chishui was a lone wanderer. From the chaotic era of the Eastern Domain to the present, he had no remarkable achievements to speak of.

Although his personal strength had reached the peak of the fourth-tier, his prestige and fame were not significant. He was known for his sneak attacks and had nothing much to show for himself. He had no attachments, controlling only a few hundred special beings within his territory, and he had no relatives. Therefore, he lived aimlessly, as long as he was happy.

He had many enemies, but most wouldn’t seek revenge against him. After all, they didn’t fear the person with nothing to lose. Even some super forces that suffered losses at his hands could only swallow their grievances.

However, this time, the Chishui became the leader of a temporary alliance and directly challenged the peak power, surprising Demon Lord Fengyu.

Wanderer Chishui was barefoot and dressed in tattered robes, resembling an old beggar. But no one dared to underestimate his strength.

“Fengyu, don’t speak so definitively. The appearance of the Qishen Temple is the bestowal of the supreme rules. No one can monopolize it, not even a fifth-tier Emperor!” Chishui changed his usual demeanor and became serious.

Inside the Eternal Tower, the Demon Lord Fengyu stood by the tower window, looking at the defiant Chishui standing in the void, her brows furrowed.

“This old thing, Chishui.” A third-tier Emperor was infuriated.

They were the closest among the peak forces. This time, the opportunity from the Qishen Temple was most likely to fall into their hands.

At this moment, a sudden temporary alliance had emerged, gathering half of the super strong individuals in the Eastern Domain. Even though they were peak forces, until the return of the fifth-tier Emperors, they wouldn’t gain any advantage within this temporary alliance.

“During the chaotic era, this old fellow wandered alone, stirring up many wars. Now, some people actually believe him.”

“Hmph, do you think those people are fools? They are just using each other.”

The temporary alliance gathered half of the strong individuals in the Eastern Domain. Each of them was shrewd. There were more than ten fourth-tier

Emperors among them. With so many strong individuals, they elected the Wanderer Chishui as their leader, obviously fearing being implicated once the fifth-tier Emperors returned.

Chishui was different. He was a lone wanderer. Even if the fifth-tier Emperors returned, he could just pull up his pants and run away. He didn’t need any territory. He could thrive in any universe.

“Forget it. For now, let’s prioritize the Qishen Temple. If we delay any longer, the strong individuals from the other factions will join forces against us, which will be even more disadvantageous for us.” Demon Lord Fengyu made

up her mind and appeared outside the Eternal Tower with a flash.

Inside the tower, no one dared to say more. Demon Lord Fengyu was no longer the little girl who used to live under her master’s shadow.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
