The vast and majestic river Sword Intent swept across the void, almost swallowing the entire void.

The void was deathly silent, and only the river of swordsmanship surged.

“Victory, victory…”

A top cultivator could not help but say excitedly.

Prince Qian, who had almost escaped death, was the most excited at this moment. The hundreds of Yan Immortals under him had all died, but he was still alive. He did not even lose much of his Yan energy.

This was something he did not dare to think about before. He was even prepared to be seriously injured and captured.

But now, everything was settled.

Prince Qian shouted excitedly, “Motherf*cker, Heavenly Official Jian is unparalleled in the world!”

Like a stone that caused a thousand ripples, all the top cultivators and Yan Immortals in the Six Heavens Realm shouted.

“Heavenly Official Jian, unparalleled in the world!”

“Heavenly Official Jian, unparalleled in the world!!”

Their voices shook the void.

They had won this battle.

This was an unimaginable battle, with close to a thousand Yan Immortals and two Grand Yan Immortals joining in.

The Six Heavens Realm only had a hundred or so Yan Immortals. Facing the assault of nearly a thousand Yan Immortals, they actually managed to protect the Six Heavens Realm.

This was an unimaginable and inconceivable battle.

However, every surviving Yan Immortal and peak cultivator knew that without those two, this would not have happened.

All the voices that they shouted out were the true thoughts in their hearts.

However, Di Qing was the only one who looked at Jian Wushuang with a serious expression. He looked at the void where the celestial river flowed out.

He had a premonition that the Grand Yan Immortal would not die so easily.

Jian Wushuang did not relax. He was still staring at the center of the Sword River.

When the Sword River completely dissipated, a figure that could barely stand still appeared.

It could be seen that his Immortal Source was about to dissipate.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief. The collapse of the Immortal Source was an irreversible sign of death even for a Grand Yan Immortal.

The old Grand Yan Immortal was about to die.

Although he was about to lose his balance, he still straightened his body and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“You have far exceeded my expectations. This old man is utterly convinced of his defeat.”

After saying this, he knelt in the void listlessly as if he was waiting for his death. “But I still want to live…”

Jian Wushuang walked forward slowly. He did not hate the old Grand Yan Immortal. He was calm.

The reason why he had stepped forward was to ensure that he would not release his divine thought to escape.

Just when Jian Wushuang was less than three meters away from the old Grand Yan Immortal, the old man, who had been waiting to die with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes.

Then, with an unimaginable speed, he shot toward Jian Wushuang like a thunderbolt.

Everything happened so fast that Jian Wushuang could not react in time.

A black and extremely sharp scepter ruthlessly stabbed into his heart.

The old Grand Yan Immortal’s previous decline was gone, his eyes were filled with madness and pride.

“Junior, although you are very strong, you are still a little too inexperienced. Are you so sure that I don’t even have the chance to counterattack?”

Looking down at the black scepter in front of his chest, Jian Wushuang’s calm eyes showed some fluctuations.

Then, he said faintly, “Idiot, you didn’t stab in.”

The old Grand Yan Immortal was stunned and immediately looked at his hand subconsciously.

Immediately after, the sound of crystals breaking could be heard.

The black scepter was instantly covered in cracks and shattered from the tip!

“No, impossible. How could my scepter be like this?!”

The old Grand Yan Immortal was shocked, he did not dare to imagine what had happened.

Every piece of azure blue armor leaf seemed to have a life of its own. It was rhythmically moving, and it was extremely beautiful.

“This, this is, Chang Duoling’s Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens?!” The old Grand Yan Immortal was extremely frightened. He finally understood why his scepter had not dealt any serious damage to Jian Wushuang.

There was a rumor in the entire Great Si Region that the Immortal Lord of the Nine Heavens Chang Duoling had a supreme treasure that could resist all external forces and could even block a full-powered attack from an Emperor.

It was rumored that the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens was only blue in color and was formed from 99,000 armor leaves. It was extremely beautiful.

Wasn’t the azure armor on Jian Wushuang Chang Duoling’s Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens?!

The old Grand Yan Immortal felt the divine blood in his body turn cold. He had never expected Jian Wushuang to wear the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens and withstand his attack.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with ridicule. He allowed the black scepter in front of his chest to shatter completely. Then, he reached out and grabbed the neck of the old Grand Yan Immortal.

“Chang Duoling was… Killed by you? Did you also steal his Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens?” There was no fighting spirit in his eyes, only despair.

“I didn’t want to take his Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens. He gave it to me at the last moment,” Jian Wushuang said.

When the old Grand Yan Immortal heard this, he seemed to have sensed something. He suddenly grinned, “That’s right, that’s right. Who wouldn’t love a prodigy like you when they’re about to die?”

“We don’t have any blood feud, so this battle doesn’t have to happen. But since it’s irreversible, I’ll make one last request,” he looked at Jian Wushuang and said. “I want to kill myself.”

“No,” Jian Wushuang refused without hesitation.

Originally, he had some compassion for him, but if Jian Wushuang had not put on the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens in advance, he would have been severely injured and even his Immortal body would have been shattered.

The old Grand Yan Immortal also knew the reason, he had no face to ask for anything else, he could only close his eyes and die.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate anymore. Thousands of Sword Intents appeared in his right palm and then hit his Immortal body.

The Sword Intent surged wildly and tore the old Grand Yan Immortal apart without any obstruction.

The Immortal Source was destroyed, and the Immortal body turned into dust and scattered in the void.

A Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal had fallen at Jian Wushuang’s hands.

At this point, this battle that involved almost all five Princes ended with the loss of over a thousand Yan Immortals.

This battle was the most intense battle since Zhen Wuyang opened up the Great Si Region.

Countless Heavenly Regions and countless living beings disappeared silently in this battle. Even the Yan Immortals died, as if they had no value.
