Chapter 1700: Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“If it’s enough? It’s definitely not enough,” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly.

He knew clearly that Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet would be more difficult to precipitate as he progressed further.

He had obtained quite a number of demon cores from Soaring Heaven King Palace. However, even if he absorbed all of them, Jian Wushuang reckoned he would at most precipitate twenty or maybe thirty Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets. He would still be far from the one hundred drops needed to break through and become a stage three Ultimate Real God.

“I just got many grade three demon cores from Soaring Heaven King Palace. Just to absorb all of the demon cores will require a very long time. So, I’ll wait till I absorb all the demon cores before I come to ask for more from Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Mm, tell me directly when you need it,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Actually, if it is about the accumulation of divine power, there are more ways to absorb them from demon cores. You can also use Natural Treasures,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

“To be frank, my divine power is unusual. Any ordinary treasure for the accumulation of divine power won’t be much help to me. Only some extremely precious Natural Treasure will be effective for me. Plus, I would require a terrifying amount of them. If I were to rely on Natural Treasure to accumulate divine power, I reckon even Lineage of Star couldn’t support me,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He wasn’t joking about what he said.

Previously, he had thought about relying on Natural Treasure to precipitate a hundred drops of Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet. However, the price was too high. It was even higher than a White Blaze Fruit Tree. He naturally couldn’t live in luxury like that.

“We don’t have any ordinary Natural Treasures and we couldn’t support any high valued treasure but I have heard of a place that might be useful for the accumulation of divine power,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked at Hall Master Gu Xin, “What place?”

“Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning!”

Hall Master Gu Xin squinted her eyes, “Of course, I’ve only heard about it from other people. It is said that an expert obtained a drop of Absolute Beginning divine power from an ancient battlefield. Then, she brought it back and it naturally developed and evolved into a divine pond!”

“The divine pond is 999,999 zhang deep. It is huge and it contains boundless Absolute Beginning divine power. Plus, Absolute Beginning divine power is extremely pure. It is said that the power is ten times purer compared to the power contained in the demon cores. On top of that, it is much easier to absorb!”

“There was one time when a severely injured Emperor God, who was on the brink of death, entered the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning and he resumed his peak state in three years’ time!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Nie Yun next to him were shocked too. It was obvious that it was their first time hearing about Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning as well.

As for the effect of the divine pond… an Emperor God on the brink of death, he recovered in three years.

He was an Emperor God!

The stronger one’s power was, the more difficult it was for one to recover after injury.

“Jian Wushuang, you need to absorb a large amount of pure power now to accumulate your divine power. In Eternal Chaotic World, I’m afraid there is nowhere with purer power than Absolute Beginning divine power from Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

“Hall Master Gu Xin, do you know where the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning is?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He was very interested in the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.

After all, if Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning were to be that impressive, his divine power could totally be accumulated to the maximum in the shortest time possible.

“I’ve only heard about Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. As for its actual location and its actual owner, I have no idea,” Hall Master Gu Xin shook her head, “However, there’s a person who would likely know where the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning is located. After all, I found out about the existence of Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning from him.”

“Who’s that person?” Jian Wushuang asked closely.

“That person… Hehe, he’s a strange man, also a mad man. He stays on Thunderbolt Island now. His name is called Mad Dog,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

“It’s him?” Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Nie Yun were shocked.

“Mad Dog?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and he immediately thought of a person.

When he had first got to Thunderbolt Island, he met a strange elderly.

The strange elderly had seen him and guided him to master his power superposition skill. His Ten Thousand Waves skill was based on the power superposition skill.

But after he had mastered the skill, the strange elderly had become unhappy and wanted to recruit him as his disciple. It was a pity that Jian Wushuang had rejected him.

Then, Jian Wushuang had found out that the strange elderly was the strangest Almighty in the entire Sanctuary Alliance on Thunderbolt Island.

His name was Mad God and he had no other title. Almost everyone called him Mad Dog, but as they had scruples about his identity as an Almighty, they would call him Sir God Mad Dog.

Sir God Mad Dog liked to eat the most!

Back then, Sir God Mad Dog expressed his interest in White Blaze Fruit and wanted to get a few White Blaze Fruit from Jian Wushuang but he hadn’t had any then.

“Jian Wushuang, do you know Sir God Mad Dog?” Hall Master Gu Xin looked at him.

“I do,” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Not only that, I also have his communication token. He offered it to me.”

“Communication token?” Hall Master Gu Xin and the others were shocked.

One should know that although Sir God Mad Dog wasn’t a nice name, he was arrogant and obstinate. He behaved completely lawlessly in Sanctuary Alliance. He held no scruples against anyone and showed no consideration for anyone’s feelings. It was naturally extremely difficult to get his communication token. At least Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun definitely didn’t have it.

But Jian Wushuang did, and it had been Sir God Mad Dog who had offered it to him.

“As Sir God Mad Dog offered his communication token to you, it means that you shared a friendly moment. You can go and ask him,” Hall Master Gu Xin smiled.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded, then he suddenly turned to look at Hall Master Yuan and said, “Speaking of Sir God Mad Dog, I nearly forgot about this. He is very interested in White Blaze Fruit. Hall Master Yuan, is there a White Blaze Fruit left in Lineage of Star?”

“There are a few more and it will not be too long until the next fruiting of White Blaze Fruit Tree. How many do you need?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“Two will be enough. Sir God Mad Dog is only a greedy eater. He isn’t using it for cultivation,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Sure. After the banquet ends, I’ll get them for you,” Hall Master Yuan promised. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

In the lofty hall, the banquet was still ongoing.

Then, Hall Master Yuan suddenly stood up and raised his glass. His loud and bright voice reverberated in the hall.

“Come on, everyone, Let us toast Hall Master Wushuang!”

Everyone in the hall stood up simultaneously.

“Cheers!”

…

After eating and drinking, the banquet ended.
