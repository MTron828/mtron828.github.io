Chapter 38: A Blood Feud

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In a cave on an unknown hill, a few hundred miles inside Tranquility Forest, Jian Wushuang slowly woke up after being unconscious for most of the day.

“Boy, are you awake?”

The shaggy-haired, burly Bu, was sitting beside him, burning coals for barbecuing. He threw a piece of meat to Jian Wushuang and said, “You must be hungry after being unconscious for so long. Come on.”

“My name is Sima Bu, but people call me Bu. You can call me elder brother Bu,” he said.

“Brother Bu,” Jian Wushuang called out and immediately asked him, “Where is my aunt?”

“Ji Wuyue?” Sima Bu shook his head and heaved a deep sigh. “She should have been caught by Blood Feather Tower. They are heartless and cruel. She would come to a sticky end.”

“Asshole!” cursed Jian Wushuang.

“Boy, your name is Jian Wushuang, right? Although you are young, you have caused Blood Feather Tower to appoint so many people to kill you.” Sima Bu sighed and said, “But you seem to be at a loss.”

“Yes, I’m puzzled. Up to this point, all I know is that I have awakened my Sword Soul. So they want to chase me down, just as they chased my father years ago. That’s why he left Sword Marquis Mansion. But what is a Sword Soul?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Sword Soul? I haven’t heard of it. But if Blood Feather Tower wants to kill you and your father so recklessly because of this Sword Soul, and they even slaughtered the Ji Clan without hesitation, then it must be important,” Sima Bu said.

“Eldest brother Bu, since you have a deep relationship with my aunt, you must know something about her, the Ji Clan, and Blood Feather Tower. Please tell me something,” Jian Wushuang pleaded seriously.

“We have been on many adventures together, and we were like Damon and Pythias, but I don’t know much about her. However, I do know something about the Ji Clan and Blood Feather Tower,” Sima Bu answered at once.

“When it comes to Blood Feather Tower and the Ji Clan, we have to start with the general pattern of the Tianzong Dynasty.”

“The Tianzong Dynasty has a vast territory with 16 provinces, and each province has many commanderies. For example, Tianyan Province has 108 commanderies, and Bashui Commandery is only one of them. So you can imagine how wide the Tianzong Dynasty is. Although the Sword Marquis Mansion that you belong to is the most powerful, compared to the whole Tianzong Dynasty, it is so weak that it can’t even be regarded as a third-rate power.”

An amazing gleam appeared into Jian Wushuang’s eye, but it soon disappeared.

Indeed, it was only in Bashui Commandery that Sword Marquis Mansion was a top power. In the entire Tianzong Dynasty, it was not. Even in Tianyan Province, there were countless powers stronger than Mansion of Sword Marquis. For example, the Tianyuan Sword Sect, one of the five Sects in Tianyan Province, was not something that the Sword Marquis Mansion could compare to.

“The three Hegemons in the Tianzong Dynasty are Golden-dragon Palace, the Gladiator Arena, and Blood Feather Tower.” Sima Bu continued.

“The ruler of Golden-dragon Palace is the Monarch of the Tianzong Dynasty. Branches of Golden-dragon Palace can be found all over the Tianzong Dynasty. Although its power is overwhelming, it isn’t restrained by the Golden-dragon Guard like me and your aunt, Ji Wuyue.

“The power of the Gladiator Arena, the biggest chamber of commerce, is everywhere in the Tianzong Dynasty. It is said that the Gladiator Arena has the support of the imperial household, which must be the prince.

“The last one is Blood Feather Tower!

“Everyone that wanders around the Tianzong Dynasty knows about and fears Blood Feather Tower. It is the number one assassin organization recognized by the public. There are a large number of invisible assassins. These assassins are divided into four levels. Copper, silver, gold, and purple. Silver masks generally have cultivation in the Gold Core Realm. Gold masks are at the peak of the Gold Core Realm. And purple masks are supreme experts in the legendary Yin-Yang Void Realm.

“This time, dozens of silver-masked assassins and three gold-masked assassins chased us down.

“What I talked about was the Three Hegemons with terrible strength who stood in the first echelons of the Tianzong Dynasty. The ancient Eight Clans were second to them.

“It is said that the Eight Clans were passed down since the establishment of the Tianzong Dynasty, ancient and culturally-rich. One of them, the Ji Clan, was wiped out three years ago, which shook the whole Tianzong Dynasty. All the powers were curious about the reason. However, they were killed because of granting asylum to your father,” Sima Bu said and sighed.

“What about my aunt? What about the poison in her body?” Jian Wushuang looked sullen.

“It is called Heart-biting Poison and it’s very poisonous, enough to completely destroy a person gradually. When I saw her three years ago, she was poisoned and it would occasionally attack her. When it does, she suffers unprecedented pain that directly destroys her mind. She will refuse to have anything to do with her kin or friends, only understanding to crazily kill. I have seen it several times, it’s so miserable!

“The attack of the poison manifests suddenly, without any regularity. She was trying to save you this time, but it so happened that the poison attacked, alas!” Sima Bu sighed gently, and said slowly, “The poison quickly makes her fall into madness. If we took her, we could not have escaped, so…”

Saying this, Sima Bu looked pale.

He and Ji Wuyue had gone through many things together, and they had a deep relationship. He would have never left without her unless there was no choice.

“Who? Who poisoned my aunt?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“I know. It was An Ying, the Hall Master of Blood Feather Tower in Tianyan Province. He was among the assassins this time,” said Sima Bu.

“An Ying? Good, I will remember him.”

“Not only him, but also Blood Feather Tower!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang raised his head and his eyes were filled with unprecedented killing intent. He did not know his lot before, but now, he knew everything.

His mother was the firstborn daughter of the Ji Clan. He had the blood of the Ji Clan. That is to say, he bore the blood feud of the Ji Clan.

In order to protect his father, the entire Ji Clan was killed.

His father, who had been caught by Blood Feather Tower, could be dead or alive.

His aunt, persecuted by Blood Feather Tower, was suffering from severe pain. Now, in order to save him, she had been caught by them.

With the awakening of his Sword Soul, the experts of Blood Feather Tower had come to kill him for the first time… All of the culprits were from Blood Feather Tower!
