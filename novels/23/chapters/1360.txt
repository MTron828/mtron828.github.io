Chapter 1361: A Fierce Fight

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Come on!”

The Universe God called Luo Xu started the attack.

He was confident, believing that he was as powerful as Jian Wushuang.

However…

Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword transformed into a bright flash of light and went through the throat of Luo Xu. A horrible Soul Power exploded from the sword, tearing Luo Xu apart. Luo Xu’s eyes were wide open, but soon became lifeless.

“Killing with only one sword attack?”

Everyone from both the Thunder Fire Sect and the White Flame Palace couldn’t believe what they had seen. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Luo Xu died in the first round of the battle with Jian Wushuang.

Lei Chao was still calm and called the next Universe God.

“Next, Xu Meng.”

Xu Meng went out and looked at Jian Wushuang aggressively.

As the Universe God in the Second Heaven, Xu Meng was much powerful than Luo Xu.

So Xu Mang was supposed to defeat Jian Wushuang.

However…

Shoo…

Jian Wushuang waved his sword, which sent out a freezing cold light to surround Xu Meng and kill him.

“Also with one attack?”

Everyone from both the Thunder Fire Sect and the White Flame Palace was speechless.

Lei Chao felt satisfied and nodded, and he continued to call the next person.

After pausing for a while, he pronounced a name.

“Chen Bin!”

Other Universe Gods started a heated discussion.

A youth came out from the group of the White Flame Palace.

“Chen Bin is the top guy amongst the Universe Gods in the Second Heaven! It is said that he fought against a Universe God in the Third Heaven and wasn’t defeated! What if Chen Bin kills Jian Wushuang?” Someone from the Thunder Fire Sect commented.

“Impossible. I know Lei Chao. He is at the top of the Real God List, and he is able to kill a group of Real Gods. So he would not even allow a Real God to kill that Universe God in the First Heaven, let alone only a Universe God in the Second Heaven.” The master of the Thunder Fire Sect said.

But he was also shocked that Jian Wushuang was going to fight with a Universe God in the Second Heaven.

Now the sect master fully understood why Lei Chao was confident enough to go to the White Flame Palace.

By himself, Lei Chao could ruin the whole White Flame Palace.

In the heaven, Chen Bin came to Jian Wushuang with a long purple sword, sending out a scary power.

Jian Wushuang could feel that the pressure brought by Chen Bin was much stronger than the previous two talents.

“Watch out, I am different from them.” Chen Bin said coldly.

“Come on.” Jian Wushuang held his Blood Mountain Sword tightly.

Bang!

Chen Bin unleashed his strong power. His breath transformed into a giant purple exotic beast, rising from Chen Bin. Chen Bin hurled out his sword, producing a resounding cracking sound.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Several attacks came at Jian Wushuang and surrounded him.

“A very fast attack!” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He generated his Divine Power and waved his sword whilst combing it with the Ancient God Power.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Several resounding booms exploded.

“Purple Thunder!”

Chen Bin started to generate another skill.

A giant shadow of an exotic purple beast appeared behind Chen Bin.

The beast opened its giant mouth. Its roar shook the whole heaven and formed a horrible force rushing toward Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang shivered under the powerful attack and couldn’t open his eyes.

Shoo!

The flash of purple light stabbed into Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Although Jian Wushuang didn’t open his eyes, he managed to defend himself with his Soul Power against the attack of the purple light. He stepped back further and adjusted his position.

“I have said that I am different from the precious ones.” As Chen Bin spoke, he generated power in the purple sword in his hand.

The horrible power gradually dispersed.

Jian Wushuang was undergoing high pressure from Chen Bin, “Although my Soul Power is better than Chen Bin’s, from which I could defend myself, he has many more powerful unique skills than I have!”

And immediately, Chen exercised another attack.

Boom!

Chen Bin’s horrible Divine Power tore a hole in the heavens and the power rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

Then, several attacks came suddenly.

A purple tornado rose up. Though its power had yet to explode, its formidable strength had already shocked many Universe Gods in the Second Heaven.

“Rank three unique skill?”

“He’s even using an advanced rank three unique skill?!”

Jian Wushuang was amazed.

It was so amazing that a Universe God in the Second Heaven could generate an advanced rank one unique skill. Jian Wushuang now could only generate a peak rank second unique skill, far behind this top genius from the White Flame Palace.

“Though I am not as good at unique skills, I can make up for it with secret skills!” Jian Wushuang started to generate a golden light, igniting a blood-red fire.

The fire spread and formed a vast, blood-red sea.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang took out his Blaze Quicksand Gourd, from which floods of sand gushed out and rushed to Chen Bin.

“Blaze Quicksand?”

Even the used-to-be-indifferent Lei Chao was surprised by Jian Wushuang’s secret skills.

“The Dragon Roar!”

Jian Wushuang generated another secret skill!

Boom!

With a starling roar, the power of Jian Wushuang’s sword skyrocketed.

The Dragon Roar, one of the three Peak Rank Second Secret Skills, was the one which had the feature of being able to generate power.
