Chapter 974: The Fear of the Three Big Countries

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Since I’ve said my piece, we only need to judge the choice made the rulers of the three big countries now. I hope they make the correct decision. Otherwise, I’d have to fight to my death!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes thinned into a slit, with the light of passion shinning from within.

The worst possible outcome was for him to engage in a brutal battle.

It would be best if they could end the war!

Then, the experts from the three big countries would retreat and leave Tang of the East.

Though the country would still suffer in this scenario, the lost was acceptable.

Either way, the country would not make such a recovery in a short while with Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun heavily injured.

Even if it recovered, the country would still lose in a direct war against the three big countries.

Tang of the East had suffered too much during the war at the imperial palace 1,200 years ago. Later on, conflict broke out in the Xia Clan, resulting in a chaotic civil war within Tang of the East, weakening the country even further.

Not even Jian Wushuang’s return would be able to immediately rejuvenate the might of the country.

In such a scenario, it would be impossible for the country to retaliate and seek revenge on the three big nations.

Thus, the country could only compromise and promise not to seek revenge on the three big countries. It would be enough as long as the outsiders leave and give the country the opportunity to recuperate.

They could always find an opportunity for revenge after the country recovered. Then, they could talk about their past humiliations of being trapped helplessly in the imperial palace.

“Let us calmly wait here for three days,” Emperor Xiao said.

The others in the palace nodded in agreement.

Right at the same time, the rulers of the three big countries had also gathered in their camp.

The three of them immediately started their discussion after receiving the news.

“Jian Wushuang dissipated into blood fog in front of so many of us! How is he still alive?” The purple-haired man with a gloomy face was the first to speak. He was the ruler of West Paradise. In the Green Fire World, he was called West Paradise Emperor.

“I can’t believe it either! Could we have made a mistake, Ape Celestial Master?” a grey-robed elder asked, frowning. He was South Emperor, the ruler of South Mountain Kingdom.

The last man wore a pure gold imperial robe. Complementing his solemn demeanor was the strongest aura amongst all three emperors.

His aura was stronger than that of Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun at their peak. He was evidently a Celestial Master.

He was of the same realm as Xia Yong, the ancestor of the Xia Clan that Jian Wushuang killed.

He originated from the North Sea Kingdom. Those in the Green Fire World called him Ape Celestial Master.

“Humph!”

Ape Holy Master looked around him before saying, “Yes, many people saw that. But the man who killed Dao Master Gu Ji outside the imperial palace was an Eternal Realm expert. If it’s not Jian Wushuang, who in the Eternal Realm could kill a top-tier Rank Two Dao Master?”

West Paradise Emperor and South Emperor were both stunned.

“Furthermore, the expert uses a sword. That means he’s obviously a Sword Principle cultivator. The finger that he used to kill Dao Master Gu Ji was the same as the one he used in the war 1,200 years ago. He’s Jian Wushuang!”

“There’s no need to doubt his identity and speculate about how he revived himself. Our problem right now is how we should deal with this situation and Jian Wushuang!” Ape Celestial Master cried.

West Paradise Emperor and South Emperor frowned.

“How?”

“How do we deal with Jian Wushuang?”

It was widely known that Jian Wushuang saved the entire Tang of the East by himself in the war at the imperial palace. Many experts had closely observed and noticed that his power at the end was far strong than any Dao Master. He had achieved something of another realm.

That realm wasn’t something that any of the experts could even dream of reaching. Even Ape Celestial Master, the strongest of them all, was just a joke in the eyes of experts of that level.

If Jian Wushuang had the same strength now, how could the three big countries even defend themselves?

Fear!

Though he was a mere Eternal Realm expert, he managed to invoke the deepest fear in all three rulers.

“Humph! Jian Wushuang is just an Eternal Realm expert. Even though he killed Dao Yuanzi 1,200 years ago, he must have used some unusual methods and it’s unlikely he’ll be able to use them again. In other words, he’s no longer as strong as he was back then,” Ape Celestial Master murmured.

“I also don’t believe that he can use the same power again.” West Paradise Emperor nodded in agreement.

“That’s right. But what if he still retains that power?” South Emperor retorted quietly.

West Paradise Emperor and Ape Celestial Master were stunned.

“That’s right.”

“Even if it’s unlikely, it’s still possible.”

“What if Jian Wushuang still retains that power?”

“With such a power, killing us would be as easy as crushing ants.”

“Furthermore, even if he’s unable to retain his power, his potential is unmatched. If he doesn’t die, his threat to the three big countries will be paramount in the future,” South Emperor said.

West Paradise Emperor and Ape Celestial Master couldn’t help but keep quiet on the issue.

Jian Wushuang’s potential was another huge problem for them.

Even if he wasn’t strong enough to be a concern, his ability to kill a top-tier Rank two Dao Master while being in the Eternal Realm meant that he would be incredibly powerful after becoming a Dao Master. If he had numerous Dao and became a Rank Three Dao Master, his power would be unparalleled.

“Could he be another Sunrise Sword Emperor?” West Paradise Emperor asked in a trembling voice.

Ape Celestial Master and South Emperor’s bodies shook as fear crept up to them.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor?”

That was a freak of nature that they would rather die than provoke. Jian Wushuang’s ability and potential now could match up to that freak.

While they were trapped in their worries, Ape Celestial Master’s face suddenly lit up.

“What’s wrong?” West Paradise Emperor and South Emperor turned to look at him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Good news. Dao Master Gu Ji’s Junior Brother, Master Ku, one of the 18 masters of Void Temple, is rushing over after hearing about his death. He’s scheduled to arrive tomorrow,” Ape Celestial Master explained.
