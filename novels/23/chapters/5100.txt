Chapter 5101 ¬†Bricklaying in the Great Desolate Wilderness (1)

Following that, he changed his tone, saying, "If you still won't speak, I have many ways to make you suffer a thousand, ten thousand times more than staying in that tiny bone armor!"

However, the black-robed figure paid no heed to his words, stubbornly repeating the same phrase, "One who gazes upon the Secret Text shall perish!"

Zhen Wuyang grew furious and directly swung his arm, instantly unleashing chains formed from the Emperor's aura, which lashed viciously at the black-robed figure.

With a single lash, a menacing crack appeared all around the black-robed figure.

Then, nine chains simultaneously struck down.

The overwhelming dark purple brilliance dispersed as the black-robed figure's body visibly vanished at an incredible speed.

"It's of no benefit to you to remain silent. Speaking might bring you some relief," Zhen Wuyang said calmly.

Even on the brink of life and death, the black-robed figure repeated the same phrase as before.

"One who gazes upon the Secret Text shall perish!"

"You seek death!" Zhen Wuyang shouted, and all nine chains lashed down together!

It was evident that once all the chains descended, the black-robed figure would undoubtedly disappear.

Jian Wushuang's heart sank, wanting to save the black-robed figure.

However, Yu Chang acted first, raising his hand to stop the nine chains of the Emperor's fate energy, standing in front of Zhen However, Yu Chang acted first, raising his hand to stop the nine chains of the Emperor's fate energy, standing in front of Zhen Wuyang.

"Yu Chang, what are you doing?" Zhen Wuyang furrowed his brow, puzzled.

Yu Chang cupped his hands and said, "My Lord, he cannot die. This involves many matters, and acting recklessly may be detrimental to many things."

Zhen Wuyang frowned, contemplating the meaning behind Yu Chang's words. After a moment, he said, "Very well, imprison him."

Upon hearing this, Yu Chang nodded, then turned to look at the black-robed figure. He extended his hand, and layers of dark ink-like auras appeared. Afterward, he enveloped the black-robed figure and tucked it back into his sleeve.

With the disappearance of the black-robed figure, the indescribable oppressive atmosphere vanished completely.

The entire SkySide Cloud Platform returned to its usual state of calm and tranquility.

Unable to extract any useful information from the black-robed figure, Zhen Wuyang was left feeling frustrated.

He then turned to Jian Wushuang, his eyes filled only with resentment.

"..."

"What Secret Text were inside those bone armor pieces that we couldn't even extract information from?"

"Well... it's not much. Just when we were about to figure out something, that figure in the black-robed figure burst out and destroyed the bone armor."

The voice of Zhen Wuyang rose abruptly. "So, after all this trouble and nearly destroying half of my Great Mi Heaven, we ended up with nothing?"

Jian Wushuang felt rather embarrassed. "...You could say that."

Zhen Wuyang was furious, turning to look at the Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo. "Xu Tuo, I demand the truth. What were the hidden messages on the bone armor?"

The divine craftsman Xu Tuo slowly opened his eyes. "Your Majesty, as Young Friend Jian has said, Xu Tuo truly knows nothing about it."

Upon hearing this, Zhen Wuyang felt speechless.

At this moment, Yu Chang spoke, "In this Great Si Region, every speck of dust and every Heavenly Region has gone through countless trials and tribulations to reach its current prosperity."

"The purpose of the Heavenly Court is to shelter countless Heavenly Regions, to ensure their eternal prosperity, and to guide innumerable prodigies towards their own paths."

"However, this unnecessary conflict has turned nearly a hundred Heavenly Regions, along with countless sentient beings, into dust, obliterating everything."

"This has exceeded what the Heavenly Court can tolerate. The previous Grand Yan Immortal who wiped out nearly ten Heavenly Regions was already sealed within the Endless Sea, enduring endless emptiness."

"And now, the extent of destruction you've caused to the heavenly realms far exceeds any previous conflict. Punishment is inevitable."

Yu Chang passed judgment and looked at Zhen Wuyang.

At this moment, the disciples of the Sancun Mountain, Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo, Nan Xuan, and Prince Jiu were all extremely nervous.

Punishment from the Endless Sea, the Emperor's punishment, was the most severe of all.

Once these punishments were imposed, it was almost equivalent to a death sentence.

At this point, Jian Wushuang stepped forward, cupping his hands and said, "This conflict was caused entirely by me. They are all victims and have nothing to do with it. I will take full responsibility."

"Who said anything about punishing them?" Zhen Wuyang looked at him and said in a deep voice, "Today, I will only punish you, and it will be a severe punishment!"

"I am willing to accept it," Jian Wushuang said firmly, cupping his hands in response.

Jian Wushuang had been sentenced to a rather unusual punishment. The Zhen Wuyang spoke in a stern tone, "Tell me, what kind of punishment do you desire?"

"Any punishment will do," Jian Wushuang replied.

"Very well, you spirited lad! Then, I, as your Emperor, decree that you shall go to the Great Desolate Wilderness and labor as a bricklayer for 10,000 years!"

"...Bricklaying?!" Jian Wushuang was left speechless.

"Yes, off to the Great Desolate Wilderness with you, and you shall serve your sentence for a full 10,000 years!"

...

The intense and warm energy dissipated, the rolling clouds gradually disappeared, replaced by a gloomy overcast sky. Massive thunderstorms, as formidable as dragons, brewed within the dark clouds, accompanied by colossal whirlwinds, creating an apocalyptic scene.

Amidst this treacherous void, even Yan Immortals dared not linger, and yet, a colossal bird soared through the tumultuous sky.

This enormous bird was as dark as ink, and its wingspan was so vast that it could cover several heavenly realms beneath its feathers. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

It was so massive that even the dragon-like lightning within the stormy clouds seemed minuscule in comparison.

Seated upon the back of this giant avian creature were two figures: one was Yu Chang, and the other was Jian Wushuang.

Even the frozen gusts of cosmic energy could be devoured within this void, and even Jian Wushuang felt a bone-chilling cold.

This was a void unlike any they had ever seen before. There were no heavenly realms, no trace of Yan power, only desolation and emptiness.

This was an intensely dark void, devoid of stars, and aside from the occasional bursts of lightning, there was no other color.

Perched on the bird's head, Jian Wushuang had no idea where he was anymore.

The giant bird could traverse thousands of Heavenly Regions with a single flap of its wings, indicating they had ventured far from the central region of the Great Si Region.

'Could it be that the so-called Great Desolate Wilderness is the border of the Great Si Region?' Jian Wushuang thought with a shiver.

At that moment, Yu Chang suddenly turned around, his gentle face looking at him. "You guessed right; the so-called Great Desolate Wilderness is indeed the border of the Great Si Region."

Jian Wushuang was taken aback. "How did you know what I was thinking?"

Yu Chang smiled faintly. "I simply guessed. It would be strange if you weren't pondering this question."

Jian Wushuang fell silent, still puzzled about how these Emperors always seemed to know what other Yan Immortals were thinking.

After a moment, Yu Chang spoke again, "We are now far from the central region of the Great Si Region and heading toward the border."

He was slightly stunned. Over 20,000 years had passed since his ascension to the Divine Power Universe, and he had spent nearly that entire time revolving around the Great Si Region.
