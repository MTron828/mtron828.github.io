In the main hall, Chu Yong was silent for a moment before he spoke, “Mr. Jian Yi, although Young Phoenix is only a disciple of our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, she is very special in our pavilion and her status is extremely high. Although I am an Elder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I have no way of instructing her to do anything and I have no way of getting her to meet you.”

“But since you are so eager to meet me, I can ask Elder Qin to send a message to Xiaofeng for you. If she agrees to meet you, then it will be easy. But if she doesn’t agree, then I have no choice.”

“In that case, I will have to trouble Elder Chu Yong to send a message for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sure, but I have to ask you to wait here for a while,” Chu Yong said with a faint smile, then left the palace to send a message.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the hall and waited quietly.

…

In an inconspicuous corner of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, although it was inconspicuous, many proud sons of heaven of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were lingering here. They stopped here because this corner was where the Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion lived.

It was a wonderful manor with a vast atmosphere.

The red-haired older man, Chu Yong, came to the void outside the manor. Then, he slightly revealed his divine power aura.

Swoosh!

A figure rushed out of the manor. It was the Master of the Young Phoenix and the second known Immortal Saint of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Elder Qin.

“Chu Yong, the people over there shouldn’t have arrived so soon. So why are you here now?” Elder Qin asked.

“That Jian Yi is here.” Chu Yong replied.

“Jian Yi?” Elder Qin’s expression changed as he frowned. “Why is he here?”

“On the surface, he said that he just became the Realm Lord of the Heavenly Curve World not long ago and came to greet our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. First, however, he requested to meet with the Young Phoenix.” Chu Yong said.

“He wants to meet Leng Er?” Elder Qin’s expression turned cold. “Chu Yong, you should know what will happen today. At this time, how can Leng Er meet outsiders?”

“Of course I know. However, Jian Yi’s strength isn’t weak, and his talent is extremely high. Now that he has become the Realm Lord of the Heavenly Curve World, it’s inevitable for him to interact with our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion in the future. Now that he has personally come to pay a visit, I have no choice but to give him some face. However, I disagreed with it directly. Instead, I said that I would pass on a message to him. If the Young Phoenix is willing to meet him, I’ll meet him. If she disagrees, there’s nothing I can do.” Chu Yong spoke.

“Is that so?” Elder Qin mused for a moment before he said, “In that case, wait here. I will go and ask Leng Er.”

Elder Qin turned around and walked into the manor.

In an exquisite pavilion in the middle of the manor, a peerless beauty was seated. In her hand, she was flipping through a jade slip.

“Leng Er.” Elder Qin walked in.

“Master, is Elder Chu Yong looking for you?” Leng Rushuang asked.

“It’s a person called Jian Yi who is currently in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. He wants to see you. So Elder Chu Yong came over to ask if you would like to see him,” Elder Qin said.

“Jian Yi?” Leng Rushuang was puzzled. “Who is that?”

“That’s the person who appeared in front of you when the Dragon-phoenix list was opened, and you took the initiative to ask for his name,” Elder Qin said.

“It’s him?” Leng Rushuang’s expression changed, and she stopped what she was doing. A sentence immediately came to her mind.

“In my previous life, I chased after you for 100,000 years. My heart was broken, and I missed you. Then, I entered the reincarnation with you.

“In this life, I promise you 100 million years, and we will be together until death. So when we meet today, you will be my companion, and we will be proud of each other.”

The name of that person was Jian Wushuang.

Leng Rushuang had a deep impression of Jian Wushuang.

Because the name Jian Wushuang was very familiar to her.

And the words that Jian Wushuang gave her also touched her heart.

“Leng Er, if you don’t want to meet Jian Yi, I will directly refuse for you,” Elder Qin said.

“Let him come over,” Leng Rushuang said.

Elder Qin was shocked.

Young Phoenix was famous in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the entire Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

Like her master, she knew everything.

Many people wanted to see Young Phoenix, including some proud sons of heaven, some people with noble statuses, and even some experts. She rejected them without even thinking.

But now, Jian Yi came to ask for an audience, and she agreed?

“Leng Er, this is the first time she agreed to someone else’s request, right?” Elder Qin sighed in her heart, but she had already sent a message to Chu Yong outside the manor, asking him to bring Jian Yi over.

Soon, Jian Yi was led by Chu Yong to the outside of the manor.

And Elder Qin was already waiting there.

“Jian Yi!” Elder Qin glanced at Jian Wushuang with a strange expression.

“Jian Yi greets Elder Qin,” Jian Wushuang said humbly.

His humility came from the bottom of his heart. No matter what, Elder Qin was Leng Rushuang’s master. For the sake of Leng Rushuang, Jian Wushuang naturally had to be humble.

“Mr. Jian Yi, you are too kind. Leng Er is already waiting at the stone table in the manor,” Elder Qin said.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang smiled gratefully and then went straight to the manor.

Elder Qin followed him immediately.

After entering the manor, Jian Wushuang soon saw Leng Rushuang.

The latter was sitting at the table, very quiet.

“Elder Qin, I want to talk to Miss Leng Er alone. Is that okay?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Mr. Jian Yi, your request is a bit too much.” Elder Qin frowned.

“Master, you go outside first. I also want to ask him some questions alone,” Leng Rushuang said.

Even Leng Rushuang said so. Although Elder Qin was reluctant, she still turned around and left.

But she did not go far. She just watched from the void.

After all, Leng Rushuang was too important to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. As her master, she had to ensure Leng Rushuang’s safety.

Seeing Elder Qin leave, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and immediately set up a layer of restriction around him.

This restriction layer was only to prevent the conversation between Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang from being heard. It did not contain any power, and Elder Qin did not stop it.

Only Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang were left in the manor, staring at each other from a distance of only a few meters.

Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Rushuang with tenderness in his eyes.

This tenderness was not an act but a genuine passion and love from the heart.

As for Leng Rushuang, she looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange look, but more than that, she was puzzled. The two were completely different.
