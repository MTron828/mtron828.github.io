“Red Snow King escaped?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“It’s my fault,” the Master of Void Temple said, taking the blame for what happened. “The cunning Red Snow King immediately fled when he saw that the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness wasn’t going to last. Even though I managed to react in time and worked together with Red Lotus to stop him, he still managed to run.”

“Red Snow King possesses the battle strength of a peak Universe Master. It’s normal that you fail to stop him,” the Master of Samsara Temple said.

Jian Wushuang gave a small nod. “Whatever the case, we’ve fulfilled our objective of our war this time.”

“You’re right! We did it!”

The five Palace Masters began to smile.

Even though they were still under immense pressure, they had still successfully destroyed the plans of the former capital of the Jin Kingdom. Their objective was essentially fulfilled. This was a great victory for them.

With this great victory, they could still put up a struggle against the main Jin army.

If the Green Fire Palace lost this war, then it would truly be the arrival of Judgment Day for them.

“The former capital of the Jin Kingdom is now destroyed. Even though there are still surviving experts on this battlefield, all of them except for Red Snow King are insignificant for us. We can now destroy their foundation here without worries. Before the army arrives, they wouldn’t have any way of resisting us,” the Master of Samsara Temple said.

“Emperor of Tang, Rising Sun, Red Lotus, I’ll leave the task of destroying the foundation of Jin Kingdom to you three. You must work quickly.”

“No problem.” The three of them nodded.

The former capital of the Jin Kingdom was already destroyed. Eradicating their foundation would be as easy as blowing off dust.

“Void, Jian Wushuang, the three of us will immediately return to the Green Fire Palace and prepare for the upcoming war. Moreover, we must announce the news of this decisive battle,” the Master of Samsara Temple continued.

Jian Wushuang and the Master of Void Temple wore solemn expressions.

They were well aware that the upcoming war would dictate the life and death of the Green Fire Palace and all the experts must be gathered for it.

The only way for them to resist the offensive forces of the Jin Kingdom, and perhaps even prevail, was to gather and unite all the high-level forces of the Green Fire World.

“Red Lotus, did you record the scene of the battle today with your Mirror Image Token?” the Master of Samsara Temple asked, turning toward Red Lotus.

“I did.” Red Lotus nodded. He took out a token and handed it to the Master of Samsara Temple.

“This is great. The Jin Kingdom is too strong. If we just announce the news just like that, the experts of our Green Fire World will certainly be alarmed. But after this battle today, we can certainly lift their morale!” the Master of Samsara Temple said solemnly.

Morale was a crucial point looking at how imminent the war was.

The Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace did not simply wage wage today just to destroy the foundation of the Jin Kingdom in this battlefield. They wanted to boost the morale of the entire Green Fire World at the same time.

They wanted to give the Green Fire World hope of a victory as only then would the experts unite and display their full strength

“Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang and the other six Palace Masters immediately separated to go about their respective tasks.

Emperor of Tang, Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword, and Red Lotus destroyed the foundation of Jin Kingdom in this battlefield.

Jian Wushuang, Master of the Samsara Temple, and Master of the Void Temple returned to the Green Fire Palace using the shortest time possible, where they immediately began gathering the experts of the palace.

…

In the dark and boundless Void over on the edge of the enormous battlefield.

There was a large tunnel carved into the dark and boundless Void and at the end of it was an ancient and immense spaceship slowly traveling along it. There was an impressively vast hall in the center of the spaceship.

Inside, a devilishly handsome young man dressed in a luxurious golden robe reclined on a golden throne.

Faint golden lights were glinting in his pupils. He was currently wearing a strange smile.

“Jian Wushuang…”

“Interesting. I never thought there’d be such an exceptional talent residing in the tiny Green Fire World!”

“He’s only a Dao Master but possesses the unparalleled battle strength of a Universe Master. I’ve never even heard of something like this. This youngster’s potential is certainly unpredictable.”

“What a pity that he’s unwilling to be my disciple. If that’s the case, I must eliminate such an exceptional talent like him at the roots.”

The handsome young man’s eyes gradually turned cold.

“Jiu Xi,” the man called.

The cool and elegant woman standing quietly at the end of the hall looked over. “Lord Jin Feng,” she answered.

The handsome man in a golden robe was the Monarch of Jin Kingdom. His real name was Jin Feng.

Most experts of the Jin Kingdom addressed him as Lord Monarch. Jiu Xi was the only one to call him Lord Jin Feng. This showed that she did not belong to the kingdom.

“How much longer will it take for my spaceship to arrive to that battlefield?” the Monarch of Jin Kingdom asked.

“The Void here is rather strange. Moreover, the Green Fire World can use this Void to arrange formations. In fact, their people are currently using their grand formation to obstruct the speed of the spaceship. There’s nothing I can do but to steer the spaceship slowly through this tunnel.”

“I think it’ll take us at least another eighty years to reach there,” Jiu Xi said.

“Eighty years is a pretty long time,” the Monarch of Jin Kingdom said, frowning.

He had spent a whopping five million years to enter that battlefield, so eight short years ought to be nothing to him.

He was only this anxious after seeing an existence in the Green Fire World that would pose a great threat to him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This existence was none other than Jian Wushuang!

“That Jian Wushaung is extraordinarily talented. He now possesses the unparalleled battle strength of a Universe Master but once he makes yet another breakthrough to the Holy Master level, his strength would rise significantly. He might be able to contend with me then and that would make my task of destroying the Green Fire World a lot more difficult.”

“Eighty years seem like a short time but a talent like him might be able to find a breakthrough opportunity in that time!”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom sighed. He then asked Jiu Xi, “Can’t we use the speed of the spaceship to forcefully pass through this tunnel?”

“No.” Jiu Xi shook her head. “It took me a bit of luck to create this tunnel itself for it’s not an easy task. I can’t guarantee that this tunnel is stable. If we force our way through, this tunnel might collapse on us and all our efforts will be in vain.”

“If there’s nothing we can do, then so be it.” The Monarch of Jin Kingdom shook his head before looking at Jiu Xi again. “Have you prepared what I told you to prepare?”

“Of course. The preparations are finally ready after spending hundreds of thousands of years and sacrificing much,” Jiu Xi answered with a laugh.

“Very well. Then we’ll allow the Green Fire World to exist for another eight years. Eighty years later, no one will be able to stop me!”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s evil aura rose sharply.
