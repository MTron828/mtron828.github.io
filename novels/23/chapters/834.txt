Chapter 835: I Lost

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Upon hearing the captain’s answer, Jian Wushuang showed a meaningful smile.

“Blood Mountain.”

Ouyang Xu, standing next to Jian Wushuang, and the other new recruits all looked at him.

“Don’t worry.” Jian Wushuang smiled at them and went forward.

On the open ground, Jian Wushuang and the captain stood several meters apart, facing each other. Jian Wushuang held the Emperor Sword in his hands. The captain had a long gold spear in his hand. He was radiating a powerful aura.

“Make your move.” Jian Wushuang looked at ease.

“Humph! You’re being too arrogant.”

He snorted before stomping hard on the ground.

Boom!

Immediately, there was a crack where he had stomped. He approached Jian Wushuang and thrust at him with his spear. The spear spiraled under the strong force.

The wager was too high. He dared not to take Jian Wushuang slightly. When he shot, he used all his strength.

“The second level of the Spear Heart? He should have displayed a secret technique to improve his strike to the third level.”?Jian Wushuang smiled when he saw the man’s strike.

As a captain of a 10-soldier squad, it was admirable that he had gained the power of Step Three of the Eternal Realm.

Among the Divine Realm experts, few could gain the power of Step Three. Talented as Asura was, he had only gained the power of Step Four.

However, for Jian Wushuang, such a power was nothing to fear.

The long gold spear struck out like a snake coming at its prey, with a strong strangling power behind it. It was a meter away from Jian Wushuang.

“Why didn’t he make his move?”?

The captain stared at Jian Wushuang, surprised that he seemed to have no intention of fighting back.

He even thought Jian Wushuang was too scared to move or that he had no time to react. He was about to draw his spear back.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s sword struck out.

It seemed an ordinary strike, simple and neat, slashing toward the man.

The sword collided with the spear. There was a crashing sound and sparks in the air.

Jian Wushuang twisted both his hands, sending his sword forward in a strange way.

Clang!

Another crashing sound, and the captain’s spear was knocked out of his hand.

“How is this possible?”?The captain’s eyes were full of horror.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Casually, he tapped him with his sword. The captain was immediately thrown dozens of meters backwards before regaining his balance.

He had a rather complicated look on his face when he rose to his feet.

Everyone stared at Jian Wushuang in horror.

The captain had lost.

Lost in less than a minute.

“You lost.”

Jian Wushuang smiled at the captain. “You lost. Give me eight million Divine Gems and return the gems the three of you won from the new recruits.”

“I…” The captain trembled, biting his teeth. He took out an Interspatial Ring and threw it at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang caught the ring and nodded after a simple check. He turned to the triangular-eyed man. “Where are the gems you two won?”

Both the triangular-eyed man and Xie Zi had an unwilling look, but, thinking of Jian Wushuang’s formidable power, they surrendered.

They gave all the Divine Gems they had won from the new recruits to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang returned them to Ouyang Xu and the other recruits.

“Blood Mountain, thank you!”

“Thank you!”

The recruits thanked Jian Wushuang from the bottom of their hearts.

After all, those Divine Gems had been half of everything they possessed. They would have been heart-broken if they really lost them. Luckily, Jian Wushuang had won the Divine Gems back for them.

Jian Wushuang showed a casual smile at their gratitude. The next moment, he suddenly looked toward the void beside them.

“Sir, you have been watching us for a while, it’s time to show yourself.” Jian Wushuang’s voice echoed away.

Ouyang Xu and the others immediately looked in the same direction following Jian Wushuang’s voice.

A figure immediately rushed out the void and landed in front of them.

“It’s him!”

Seeing the newcomer, Ouyang Xu and the other recruits were surprised.

Anyone who had participated in the selection of the Royal Guard would not forget this face.

Asura!

The most impressive expert in the selection.

“Is that Asura?” The captain and two old soldiers also looked at the newcomer.

Dressed in a red robe, with a huge axe on his back, Asura stared at Jian Wushuang with a ferocious aura. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“It seems that I’m right,” Asura spoke up.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang looked at him in confusion.

“The last time we met was in the selection battle. You were the only one who managed to take my blow. Ever since, I knew that you’re just as powerful as me. And I just watched how you battled your captain and I’m even more certain,” Asura explained.

“So what?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I am a born warrior. My favorite thing is to challenge strong experts, especially geniuses who are at the same level as me.” Asura’s voice was indifferent. “My biggest wish has been to defeat Xia Yan, the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World. But, several days ago, I heard that he was killed outside the Cercis Island.”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but touch his nose.

He had been the one to kill Xia Yan!

“Asura, you want to fight with me?” Jian Wushuang then asked.

“Yes, but I wonder if you are willing to accept my challenge?” Asura answered.

“Well, as you wish, let’s fight.” Jian Wushuang remained impassive.

It was normal for warlike people to challenge the top talents or strong people at the same level as themselves.

Jian Wushuang was the same.

Moreover, Asura was really powerful. Jian Wushuang was not sure he could defeat him unless he transformed into an Ancient God and used his Blood Mountain Sword.

Despite this, he decided not to do so in the following battle.

“I want to know how strong I can be without transforming into an Ancient God,”Jian Wushuang murmured in secret.

As Jian Wushuang accepted Asura’s challenge, Asura’s eyes became sharp and an overwhelming battle intent shot up high from inside him.

Jian Wushuang was also filled with battle intent.
