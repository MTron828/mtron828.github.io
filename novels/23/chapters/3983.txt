Chapter 3987: Had Won!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hua!

The heaven-shaking sword beam that was imbued with the rich principles of the universe and the might of a brand new will slashed down.

The moment the sword beam appeared and mercilessly slashed down, even Star Demon Ancestor could not help but shudder.

An unprecedented sense of danger enveloped Star Demon Ancestor’s heart.

Star Demon Ancestor gave it his all. The vast black divine power in his body swept up crazily. He had already exerted the special power he had mastered to the maximum, and he had also exerted his current battle strength to the best of his ability.

Boom! A huge universe black hole appeared out of thin air. The universe black hole occupied half of the battlefield like an open mouth, wanting to swallow the incoming sword light.

In terms of size, the sword light that Jian Wushuang displayed was on a completely different level compared to the universe black hole.

However, the moment the sword light came into contact with the universe black hole, a terrifying power instantly erupted.

Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!

The huge universe black hole was mercilessly slashed, and a large amount of special black divine power frantically retreated in all directions like a tide.

Behind the universe black hole, Star Demon Ancestor’s figure appeared. However, at this moment, his face was full of fear. After the shocking sword light with the power of will cut through the universe black hole, it directly cut into his body.

In an instant, Star Demon Ancestor’s divine body directly collapsed.

Although his divine body collapsed, the most important core of Star Demon Ancestor was his soul, which was his foundation. Logically, after his divine body collapsed, his soul still had a chance to escape.

However, to Star Demon Ancestor’s horror, Jian Wushuang’s terrifying sword light contained an extremely special power. When the sword light slashed and destroyed his divine body, the sword light also instantly cut through his soul.

“I, I…”

Star Demon Ancestor was completely dumbfounded. He felt that his soul had collapsed, and even his consciousness had begun to blur.

“No, no!”

“I can’t die, how can I die!?”

“I can’t accept this, I can’t accept this!”

“Jian Wushuang, if it weren’t for the fact that I haven’t recovered to my peak condition and that I lost many of my supreme treasures when I escaped from the eternal dark prison, how could you kill me?!”

“No!”

The divine body of Star Demon Ancestor let out a series of hysterical roars. These roars were filled with unprecedented fear and hatred, but the voice had gradually weakened.

Star Demon Ancestor’s entire soul body had been cut in half. It was impossible for him to survive such an injury.

“You’re right. If you have recovered to your peak condition, or if you haven’t lost all your treasures, with your skills and trump cards, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to kill you even if I use all my trump cards. Unfortunately, there is no medicine for regret. You can only blame your bad luck,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He had to admit that Star Demon Ancestor was indeed terrifying.

His methods were too incredible. If he had not lost all his treasures in the space passage in order to escape from the eternal dark prison, with Star Demon Ancestor’s battle strength and the many treasures in his hands…Jian Wushuang was not absolutely sure that he could kill him.

Even now, Jian Wushuang was able to kill Star Demon Ancestor so cleanly because of the new power of the will given by the universal principle.

The new power of the will given by the universal principle was completely different from the previous one.

Not only was the power of the will ten times stronger, but the most important thing was that the power of the will contained some special things that could directly attack Star Demon Ancestor’s soul through his divine body.

The sword attack just now had destroyed Star Demon Ancestor’s divine body and destroyed his soul.

Jian Wushuang estimated that if Star Demon Ancestor’s soul was too split, his split soul would also be destroyed.

This special power was like karma.

It could kill Star Demon Ancestor’s soul through his divine body, and it could also kill all his split souls through one of his souls.

What Jian Wushuang did not know was that the Star Demon Ancestor did have a split soul body.

The split soul body was deliberately left behind by the Star Demon Ancestor before the outbreak of the war. He had prepared a way out for himself. If something unexpected happened during the war, his plan would fail, on the contrary, if he was killed by the star master or Jian Wushuang, at least he would not die. There was still a split soul body to survive and there was still a chance for him to rise up in the future.

But now, when Jian Wushuang’s sword slashed down, the split soul that he had hidden in the universe void was also destroyed.

Star Demon Ancestor was truly dead.

“Although I don’t know what the special power contained in the power of the will is, no matter what, Star Demon Ancestor is really dead and the crisis in the Divine Beginning Realm has been resolved.”

“Master, I’ve protected what you asked me to protect.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes shining with a strange light.

Then, Jian Wushuang suddenly smiled. He was very happy and willful.

He was not the only one. The experts of the primordial divine realm were ecstatic and excited.

“He’s dead! Star Demon Ancestor is really dead!”

“Even his soul has been destroyed. He couldn’t be more dead. Haha, the crisis of our Divine Beginning Realm has finally been resolved!”

“We won! Our Divine Beginning Realm Camp has won this war!”

“We won! Haha!”

The experts who had been invited to the Divine Beginning Realm camp were fine, but the cultivators who had come from the Divine Beginning Realm were overjoyed.

Daoist Xuan God, the Temporal Temple Master, and the others even had misty eyes.

They were so happy that they wept. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

There was nothing they could do. Ever since Devil Cloud Star Master had taken over the Divine Beginning Realm, the Divine Beginning Realm had always been on the edge of a cliff. They had also been working hard for the Divine Beginning Realm.

They had once thought that the Divine Beginning Realm would one day resolve its crisis and become like an ordinary astral world. However, this step had always been extremely far away.

Even before the outbreak of the war, although they had made ample preparations, they still did not have much confidence in winning, especially after the appearance of Star Demon Ancestor and his terrifying devouring ability, it made them almost despair.

However, they did not expect that Jian Wushuang would be able to stand up and kill Star Demon Ancestor in such a situation and turn the tide by himself!
