Chapter 5318 - 5318: Elder Jiu Jian’s Determination

Translator: Endlessæantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After a loud muffled sound, Zhuifeng on the stage was smashed and sent flying tens of thousands of miles away.

His entire body began to crack.

He was too careless!

The Grand Elder’s expression changed slightly.

Even Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but shake his head in front of everyone. This Zhuifeng was too reckless. He constantly provoked with his agility.

Originally intending to find weaknesses in Zhu Bachi, he ended up exposing his own vulnerability, heavily injured by a sword, even his divine body shattered.

It was evident that things were about to end.

“Annihilate!” Zhu Bachi’s demonic body, towering and mighty, descended with a forceful charge.

Zhuifeng drew his sword again, and his aura kept rising, but halfway through, it weakened, indicating that his origin source was also damaged.

“Stop!’

Before Elder Jiu Jian could shout to stop, the Grand Elder stood up first, waving his hand to directly pull Zhuifeng out of the arena.

Elder Jiu Jian’s face changed, showing some anger.

He now doubted whether Zhuifeng was the Grand Elder’s illegitimate child. Did it really have to be handled this way?

Even if that sword truly struck down, Zhuifeng wouldn’t have perished, at most severely injured, entering a period of deep sleep.

That would be beneficial, allowing him to mend his own flaws.

Daoist Liuyangs expression wasn’t pleasant either. If it weren’t for the presence of the Shangqing Palace Master here, he would have burst out in anger.

Was there a need for such a fierce struggle among the younger generation?

Even if he wanted to stop the losses, it would be Elder Jiu Jian who would make a move!

ould it be that Elder Jiu Jian would watch the fall of the Tai’a Sword from Shangqing Palace without taking action?

Although some other Emperors were somewhat dissatisfied, they dared not show it openly, only turning to congratulate Daoist Liuyang.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuangs expression finally improved somewhat.

These people obviously didn’t care about the treasures.

But Jian Wushuang cared!

In his view, the strengths of the two were comparable, and the intervention of the Grand Elder was within his expectations. That’s why he bet on a draw.

Now, it turned out that Zhuifeng was too useless. His strength had not been fully revealed, and there was a good chance for a draw. He insisted on hiding a move, waiting for the opponent’s flaw.

In the end, he lost.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang cursed inwardly. He didn’t gain any treasures, and in the end, he even lost the Zhuxian Divine Stone.

“Zhu Bachi’s victory!” Elder Jiu Jian shouted, and the other 12 Tai t a Sword disciples all revealed surprised expressions.

According to what the elders said, they shouldn’t be the strongest. Originally, they confidently vowed to defend all the arenas without a single defeat.

Who would have thought that after just a few rounds, they would lose a match?

They also heard that a Dao Lord had come to from Grave God Mountain, with strength even surpassing that of an Emperor. Even before that person had made a move, they had lost one disciple.

A pile of treasures and godstones fell in front of Zhu Bachi.

“All of these are yours!”

Upon hearing this, Zhu Bachi thought that the golden sword was not giving it to him. Immediately, a hesitant expression appeared on his face. He didn’t dare to accept them and instead turned his gaze to Daoist Liuyang. “Take it! These treasures have nothing to do with the golden sword!”

Only when Daoist Liuyang spoke did Zhu Bachi dare to accept so many treasures.

“Hurry up and thank these Seniors!” Daoist Liuyang said sarcastically.

Zhu Bachi seemed to understand and immediately bowed to express his gratitude.

The people from the demonic sects were fine, but the expressions of the righteous Emperors didn’t look good.

Especially Elder Jiu Jian, he didn’t mind losing, nor did he bear any grudges. He just couldn’t stand the actions of the Grand Elder.

“Next round, continue!” Elder Jiu Jian’s voice resonated like a tolling bell.

Elder Nine Blade’s voice was like a great bell.

Zhu Bachi had set the precedent for sword snatching this time, and the remaining Princes also entered the stage.

The Dao Lords sitting in the second row were all powerful figures comparable to Emperors. They came here for the golden sword to gain fame.

They were all figures on the verge of achieving the Dao. Winning this battle would fulfill their Dao Hearts, propelling them into the realm of Emperors, becoming powerful individuals.

“Sharuo City, Broly!” A burly man with a bare upper body, white wax-like eyes, and long, black hair tied up like a wild man stood up.

He sat in the fifth row, inconspicuous!

His aura was ordinary, and he had a full head of pitch-black long hair, bound by a headband, resembling a savage.

A Dao Lord sitting in the third row couldn’t help but sneer, “At this point, someone is still daydreaming!’

In the previous rounds, most participants were wandering cultivators without any sects or schools. When they announced their names, nobody recognized them, so they had to add the name of their city in front.

“Qingyang Sect, Five Scatters!”

“Jingguang City, Zhou Shang!’

Jian Wushuang didn’t want to continue watching. There wasn’t much to see,

All in all, he was very interested in supreme techniques and treasures.

However, these people were not that impressive. It was no wonder that the Qishen Temple would recruit inheritors from the outside world.

It seemed that the cultivators of the Four Great Secret Realms were all trash. No matter how powerful the legacy treasures were, they could not make up for the flaws in their origin source.

Yang Sanrnu had known about this long ago, but he did not mind. This was also the reason why he had kept a straight face.

These people were really not worthy of sitting with him.

He would rather trust the puppets of the Black Turtle Temple than these trash left behind from ancient times.

“Grave God Mountain, Jian Wushuang, let’s exchange pointers!”

Jian Wushuangs figure was like a sharp blade, breaking through the air and landing directly on the last vacant arena.

Thirteen Tai’a Sword of Shangqing, the twelfth sword, ‘Dream Sword Fairy’!

This name resembled that of someone he used to know, and Jian Wushuang didn’t like it.

His appearance caused a slight change in the expression of the Elder Jiu Jian.

Today, they lost at least two golden swords, and he couldn’t quite fathom Jian Wushuangs strength. Winning against Dream Sword Fairy seemed like a fantasy.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuangs entrance caught the attention of many among the younger generation.

The mysterious Dao Lord on Grave God Mountain was even more inscrutable to them. However, some still felt that it was exaggerated. Even if he was strong, he was just a Dao Lord.

With the Four Great Secret Realms being so vast, who would be afraid of a Dao Lord coming from a mountain?

Originally, these people thought that someone of Jian Wushuangs status should challenge the Sword Leader, but unexpectedly, he chose to fight a woman.

It truly lowered his status.

Having taken the first row, he was now on the same level as those tier 5 Emperors,         such a lack of ambition.

Nie Yuan didn’t find anything inappropriate about Jian Wushuang. As a master of swordsmanship, he could decipher many things from every move of the sword cultivator.

“Martial Uncle Nie, is he very strong?” the young girl Qingluo asked cautiously.

Nie Yuan nodded and said, “Very strong, at least a level higher than that Dream Sword Fairy!’

“Can he defeat Tai’a Sword Leader?” The girl had many questions in her mind and quickly followed up on Nie l s response.

Nie Yuan turned his head, his eyes affectionate, and said, “We’ll only know once they’ve fought! Pay attention, it’ll be beneficial for you.”

An Emperor sitting in the fourth row couldn’t help but snort, mocking,

“What’s this? Just hugged the thigh, and now you’re already singing praises.”

This Emperor’s strength was average, but his background was strong enough for him to dare to provoke Nie Yuan.

The young girl Qingluo, upon hearing this remark, was infuriated. She wanted to retort but was suppressed by Nie Yuan.

Humph!

Emperors were incredibly powerful, yet they couldn’t see through Jian Wushuang. As for those Dao Lords, they were even less capable..
