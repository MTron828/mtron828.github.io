“As expected, people are selfish.” Jian Wushuang praised in his heart, but the strength in his hands did not weaken at all.

Blood Eagle’s situation was also becoming more and more dangerous.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’m afraid you don’t know that I have a deep relationship with Master Xiaoyao. He gave me a magic array to cultivate. It can be said that I’m extremely important to him. If I die, Master Xiaoyao will definitely be furious!” Blood Eagle shouted again.

“Master Xiaoyao?” Jian Wushuang looked strange.

He did not know whether Blood Eagle was telling the truth or not, but he did not care.

Because, Master Xiaoyao…he did not know him, nor had he heard of him.

“You talk too much nonsense.”

Jian Wushuang did not give Blood Eagle any chance to live. Sword skills rushed toward him crazily.

Under the absolute suppression of the realm, Blood Eagle could no longer block Jian Wushuang’s sword skills.

“No!!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, if you dare to kill me, Master Xiaoyao will definitely kill you!!”

“Absolutely!”

With a series of shrill roars, Blood Eagle’s divine body was finally completely destroyed by Jian Wushuang. Then, with the help of the void subjugation technique, he finally killed Blood Eagle.

Since then, the 13 axes, which had occupied the Nine Wolf Mountain Range for hundreds of thousands of years and was an absolute nightmare for many countries and sects in the surrounding area, were killed by Jian Wushuang alone!

All 13 axes were killed!

Not a single person was left.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void coldly and waved his hand to take away the interspatial ring left by Blood Eagle and the Giant Axe.

He only glanced at the interspatial ring left behind by Blood Eagle, but his heart was already shocked.

“As expected of an expert who is infinitely close to the Invincible Saint. Moreover, the 13 axes have been in the Nine Wolf Mountain Range for so many years, and they have been crazily exploiting the surrounding countries and sects. Over the years, the wealth accumulated by the 13 axes is very shocking, and the wealth in Blood Eagle’s hands is an astronomical figure.” Jian Wushuang praised.

However, even though he was amazed by the wealth, it did not cause him much of a stir.

After all, when one’s strength reached his level, the holy elixirs were only a number. He simply could not use that many holy elixirs.

And when he became stronger in the future and reached the level of a Principles Master, he would not even look at the so-called wealth anymore, because, at the level of a Principles Master, the holy elixirs were completely useless.

For Principles Masters, they used divine power to trade with each other.

Of course, some special and valuable treasures could also be exchanged for divine power, but unfortunately, Blood Eagle and the others did not have treasures of this level.

“Before he died, Blood Eagle threatened me with that Young Master Xiaoyao, thinking that I would spare his life because I was afraid of him. Unfortunately, I don’t even know who this Young Master Xiaoyao is. But since he brought him out before he died, I’m afraid that Young Master Xiaoyao is not too weak.” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly, in the next moment, he moved.

Green Flame Mountain was the lair of Blood Eagle. Not only did Blood Eagle live here, but there were also many experts under his command, including several rank seven True Saints. These experts had been hiding in the void, watching from afar, they did not dare to get involved in this level of battle.

When they saw that Blood Eagle and the leaders of the 13 axes were killed by Jian Wushuang alone, their hearts surged.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was rushing toward them.

“He’s coming toward us!”

“Is Heavenly Sword Marquis going to kill all of us here after killing the leaders?”

“I don’t think so. After all, we’re not a threat to him.”

These experts, who were almost at the True Saint Realm, were very nervous at this moment.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang could sweep 13 axes by himself and kill 13 leaders, including Blood Eagle and Violent Bear, so he could kill all of them here alone, moreover, they did not even have a chance to escape.

“You, come here!”

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of these people and pointed at the rank seven True Saint with the strongest aura with his right hand.

“My lord.” The rank seven True Saint walked to Jian Wushuang, trembling. He immediately bowed to Jian Wushuang with great respect.

“Let me ask you, do you know the Young Master Xiaoyao that Blood Eagle mentioned before he died?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Young Master Xiaoyao?” The rank seven True Saint was stunned and then nodded. “I do know about Young Master Xiaoyao. A few decades ago, an expert came to our door. That expert seemed to be called Gui Yi. He was a very powerful Immortal Saint and seemed to be slightly stronger than leader Blood Eagle.”

“This Saint Gui Yi was sent by Master Xiaoyao. It seems that leader Blood Eagle comprehended the rule of death and was qualified to comprehend a special magic array, which was specially prepared by Master Xiaoyao to go to a place called the Blood Wave Realm.”

“Blood Wave Realm?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

The reason why he came to the Nine Wolf Mountain Range and killed 13 axes was also to go to the Blood Wave Realm.

As for Master Xiaoyao…

“What happened after that?” Jian Wushuang continued to ask.

“After that, leader Blood Eagle had been studying the magic array and it seemed to be very effective. Saint Guiyi even came here twice. In the end, leader Blood Eagle made an agreement with Master Xiaoyao. Master Xiaoyao must have promised some benefits to leader Blood Eagle, and leader Blood Eagle agreed to follow Master Xiaoyao to the Blood Wave Realm when the time came.” The rank seven True Saint told him everything he knew.

After hearing what the rank seven True Saint said, Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

It seemed that Blood Eagle was telling the truth. He did have some relationship with the carefree young masters, and the fact that the carefree young master took him seriously did not seem to be a lie.

“Let me ask you again. Do you know about the carefree young master?” Jian Wushuang looked down.

“Sir, we only know his name and that he comes from a big force. As for other things, I don’t know,” the rank seven True Saint said truthfully.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, not surprised.

“From today on, there will be no more thirteen axes in the Divine Beginning Realm.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the cultivators in front of him, then moved and teleported away. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was not until Jian Wushuang completely left that the rank seven True Saint who answered Jian Wushuang’s question and all the cultivators on Green Flame Mountain heaved a sigh of relief.
