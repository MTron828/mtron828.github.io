“Full-foot Plenilune?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

From Thousand-foot Plenilune to Full-foot Plenilune, it was obvious that there was a huge elevation.

Then, the five Sir Gods stood together in the void. They looked at the huge figure before them and their faces grew solemn.

“The information didn’t say that there is such a fierce worm following Jian Wushuang.”

“Judging by the looks of the worm, it should be Plenilune that is a parasite on Ancient God but it has so many cirri.”

“Humph, it’s just a Plenilune. What’s there to be afraid of? Let’s go!”

The five Sir Gods moved again.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s go too,” King of Venomous Worms’ deep voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head. At the very next moment, its huge body quivered.

“Cry!”

A shrill cry resonated through the universe. Then, countless ferocious cirri covered the five Sir Gods instantly.

The cirri were like arrows that shot out. They contained terrifying powers of destruction.

The five Sir Gods moved one after another. They shuttled to and fro the cirri like ghosts. Occasionally, they would attack and press with force. In an instant, they shattered more than hundreds of cirri.

However, even though the cirri were shattered, King of Venomous Worm’s recovery ability grew them back in the next moment. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The five Sir Gods jostled and elbowed their ways. The cirri couldn’t stop them at all.

But then, in King of Venomous Worms’ huge, bloodshot eyes, there was boundless blood light that flowed out.

“Secret skill of Plenilune, Scarlet Light!”

Swoosh!

The two rays of scarlet light burst out of King of Venomous Worm’s two huge eyes. The two rays of light contained the power to destroy heaven and earth. Everywhere that they swept past, the void collapsed.

The two rays of scarlet light shot the two Sir Gods at the front at the first instant.

The two Sir Gods’ bodies shook but continued to pound forward the next moment.

“They live up to their name as Almighties. Although I have transformed into Full-foot Plenilune, you are still a Six-star Ancient God after all. The power of Scarlet Light isn’t enough to affect them,” King of Venomous Worms said coldly.

“Let me take care of them,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn as boundless divine power billowed in madness.

“Ancient God unique skill, Universal Laws.”

There were brawny figures that substantiated behind Jian Wushuang one after another. The figures were all in substantial form and every single one of them gave out a fierce aura.

There was a total of a thousand figures.

“Destroy!”

Jian Wushuang wielded a long sword and the Ancient God shadows behind him wielded their swords simultaneously.

Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

Countless sword lights were swung out at the same time.

The sword lights covered heaven and earth, and all living things in the universe were visibly moved.

If one had the support of boundless divine power, the power of the unique skill, Universal Laws, would become extremely terrifying.

For instance, even if an ordinary Ancient God used Universal Laws, they could at most perform simple attacks like a wave and a punch. Even so, it would drain a huge amount of divine power.

But if Sword Principle were to be performed with the embodiment of Universal Laws, the required divine power would be even higher. Naturally, the power was far beyond simple hits and punches.

The Ultimate Divine Power Droplet in Jian Wushuang’s body had already accumulated ninety-nine drops. Hence, his divine power was as vast as an ocean and he wasn’t afraid to use them.

He had utilized Universal Laws and performed a Sword Principle directly. The power was earth-shattering.

The five Sir Gods who were pounding at him saw the pressing sword light flooded and their faces changed.

The sword light wasn’t like the cirri earlier that could be scattered or dodged easily. Not only did the sword light cover a wide range, the power was also shocking.

Hong!

The terrifying whistle rang and the power of the sword light exploded.

The five Sir Gods had performed many tricks too. They smashed and blocked the sword light and it quickly dispersed.

But suddenly, there were two rays of resplendent golden lights. They appeared before a Sir God flexibly.

The Sir God who was holding a saber had got a shock. He immediately wielded the saber in his hand and swung out two blade shadows.?Then, the two Hong Jun Golden Sword flew out.

“This young man has quite a bit of a trick in his sleeve!”

“According to the information, it only said that he manipulates two golden swords that are extremely fast in speed. He could attack and pressure opponents over and over again so that his opponent has no chance to counter-attack. However, from what it seems, his other skills are very impressive too.”

“Let’s not waste time. Let’s kill him with that one move!”

The five Sir Gods exchanged a few comments and immediately came to a mutual agreement.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The five figures suddenly appeared magically altogether. Then, they stood in five corners surrounding Jian Wushuang. They flicked their wrists and took out a fiery red flag each.

“That is… formation flag?”

Jian Wushuang saw the five fiery red flags and his face instantly changed.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were many ferocious formations. These formations required a lot of time to prepare before performing and had to be set up meticulously.

However, there were also some other unique formations, especially trap formations, killing formations and that sort of formation, that were rather easy to set up. Some formations could even be hidden in tokens or unique treasures. When required, it could be taken out from the token or unique treasure directly.

As the five Sir Gods raised up their flags, it was obvious that they were setting up a formation.

“Formation, the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts!”

The five Sir Gods’ gazes were cold and they dripped fresh blood into the fiery red flags. Suddenly, the fiery red flags grew tremendously and blended into the surrounding universe. There was an instant explosion of solemnity.

Jian Wushuang was still standing on King of Venomous Worms’ head and he looked around. He saw that there was an extra layer of crimson shield in the surrounding void.

The crimson shield engulfed him within and he had no chance of escaping.

“I’m in big trouble,” Jian Wushuang’s looked troubled.

“Such an imposing, austere manner. The formation should be an impressive killing formation and it is designed to kill you,” King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Killing formation was a powerful killer move and it was performed by five Sir Gods.

Jian Wushuang felt extremely pressured.

“Jian Wushuang, you made us five Sir Gods team up to set up the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts to kill you. Even if you die, you should be proud,” it was the ugly looking lady’s, Mo Ying’s, cold voice.

“D*mn it, it’s the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts!” King of Venomous Worms shouted. He obviously knew the origins of the killing formation.

“Move, kill him.”

Mo Ying’s gaze was cold. In a corner of the void, the Sir God who was using a saber raised his saber and swung it in the direction of Jian Wushuang.
