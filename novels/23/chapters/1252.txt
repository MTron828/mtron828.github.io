“Gu King, around when would that Inverse Cultivation Disaster arrive?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“If it were for normal cultivators who have just managed to attain the level of Universe Master, it will likely take a long time for the Disaster to strike. Given that you are an Inverse Cultivator, I am not sure exactly when then it will strike but when it does, you will definitely feel it. Since you do not sense anything right now, this means that there is still some time before it strikes!”

“Of course, even so, you can start your preparation for the Inverse Cultivation now.” Gu King commented.

“Okay, I got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Soon enough, Jian Wushuang continued to probe Gu King with more questions regarding the God Disaster and Inverse Cultivation Disaster while they hurried on their journey.

He had no choice but to pay attention with the Inverse Cultivation Disaster being one of the greatest hurdles to pass. It was not in his place to turn away from it.

Time flies, three years passed in a blink of an eye.

The Spaceship travelled across the boundless and endless void for a total of three years. At last, on this day, Jian Wushuang’s Strength of Soul sees a floating vast land at a far distance.

That piece of vast land seemed to extend endlessly. In comparison with the Green Fire World, it was unsure how far the land expanded.

“Have we finally arrived at the place where cultivators reside in?” Jian Wushuang stared at the distant land, secretly amazed inside.

One have to acknowledge that he spent a good three years in the Spaceship to rush down to the place even with the incredulous speed of the Spaceship.

Without the Spaceship, it would take him no lesser than a few hundred years to rush here by feet.

Upon approaching the vast land, Jian Wushuang has already placed the Spaceship back into?the Interspatial Ring before advancing onto the floating land. Without long, a city on the land appeared.

The city was heavily guarded by a magical force field. Unable to trespass with his powers, Jian Wushuang can only enter through the city gate.

When he arrived at the gate, he found several long queues waiting to enter the city. Each queue had at least thousands of people waiting in line.

“There are so many people, and they are all so powerful.”

Jian Wushuang’s Strength of Soul has since curled out and detect all of those people’s aura clearly.

Most of the people in line were at the level of a Holy Master and the amount of those who were Universe Masters were comparable. As for those in line who were Dao Masters, they were the least, only several of them.

Those beneath the level of a Dao Master were in fact none.

“Of course, even so, you can start your preparation for the Inverse Cultivation now.” Gu King commented.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang realised.

“Just wait in line. The Eternal Chaotic World pay more attention to rankings in terms of power. If you were a powerful Universe God, perhaps you would not need to follow the rules of this city but you are only a mere Universe Master as of now.” Gu King advised.

Jian Wushuang shrugged. Guess he had no choice but to simply wait in line.

The Eternal Chaotic World’s efficiency was extremely high. In less than an hour, it was soon Jian Wushuang’s turn.

“One Chaos Gem to enter the city.” The city guard said coldly.

“One Chaos Gem?” Jian Wushuang startled.

In Green Fire World, the value of a Chaos Gem was nearly all a Rank Three Dao Master had owned. Here, it was just a fee to enter the city.

“That sure is expensive. There must be at least ten thousand people entering the city every day, a Chaos Gem for a person, that would be ten thousand Chaos Gem in a day. The master of the city sure is evil enough.” Jian Wushuang sighed before giving the city guard a Chaos Gem to enter the gate.

Inside of the city,?the streets were bustling with people, filled with a lively atmosphere.

Just like what Gu King has said, most of the city people were Holy Masters. In terms of ranking, he almost couldn’t find any Dao Master.

As for Universe Gods, in the words of Gu King, even in the Normal Realm, the Universe God is already the highest ranking warrior which was already rare to be seen. As such, it would also be rare here.

This city was actually similar to the one inside Green Fire World. They both had a variety of shops, except the scale for those here was obviously bigger.

Jian Wushuang aimlessly walked around the city for a while and entered some of the shops. The treasures sold in the shops were apparently of a higher grade compared to those in Green Fire World.

After half a day, Jian Wushuang sat inside a bar.

He held up his wine glass and thoughtlessly sipped on the wine. After just two sips, he began to frown.

“The wine in the Eternal Chaotic World is uncomparable to that of my hometown.” Jian Wushuang shook his head before turning to a waitress at the side and asked, “Does your house bar sell information?”

“Of course.” The waitress who was at the level of a Holy Master smiled, “Not sure what kind of information do you need, Sir?”

“I want information about this realm, as detailed as possible. Best if the information includes the forces of the parties here, and who are the stronger ones to take note of.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“The most detailed information, we do have but the price is rather expensive, it would take 500 Chaos Gems.” Eyes in the shape of crescent moons, the waitress smiled.

A usual Holy Master would have owned a wholly of around 20 Chaos Gems.

Even a Universe Master would typically have several hundred Gems. Those who actually can give out 500 Chaos Gems were extremely rare.

“Here’s 500 Chaos Gems, you can count them.” Jian Wushuang tossed an Interspatial Ring over.

The waitress’s eyes lit up. After going over them carefully for a bit, she reverently said, “Please wait a minute, Sir.”

Not long after, the waitress offered Jian Wushuang the most detailed information about the city in no time. While continuing to drink, Jian Wushuangs leafed through the document.

“The Dayu World belongs to Snow Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang let out an expression filled with confusion.

At this moment, Gu King spoked again, “Jian Wushuang, the structure of the Eternal Chaotic World overall can be classified into four levels.”

“The first level which is also the lowest, are the countless Eternal World, just like the Green Fire World which you have lived in. It is just that its geographical location is a little unique, that’s all.”

“The second level would be the Realm Domain!”

“The Realm Domain refers to an extensive field which exists numerous Eternal Worlds with their land gathering people who come from all over the world. Generally speaking, every Realm Domain is controlled by one strong warrior or by a large force.”

“The third level would then be the God Kingdom!”

“The God Kingdom is made up of hundreds of the Realm Domains. A God Kingdom, by itself is extremely massive, yet in the vast Eternal Chaotic World, there still exists many of them.”
