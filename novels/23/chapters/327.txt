Chapter 328: The Wedding Ceremony

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Or what?” Jian Wushuang stared at Nie Wuxin with a calm face.

If he had been threatening someone else, it might have worked. But it didn’t work on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stopped Chi Mei on the street before because he didn’t want to draw attention. In fact, both he and Chi Mei looked down upon Nie Wuxin.

Even if it was the whole Magic Cloud Sect, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t care.

“Kid, I wouldn’t mind killing you!” Nie Wuxin said coldly.

“Oh? Do you plan to kill us inside Ice Nether Valley?” Jian Wushuang said. He had nothing to fear and didn’t worry about drawing Ice Nether Valley’s attention.

After all, they were inside Ice Nether Valley. They were all guests. He wouldn’t do it unless he was out of mind. Therefore, Jian Wushuang didn’t worry at all.

“Fine.” Nie Wuxin smiled coldly and said, “You’re right. We’re inside Ice Nether Valley right now, so I can’t do anything. But you can’t stay here forever, can you? After tomorrow’s wedding, you have to leave, and then there will be no one to help you.”

After saying that, Nie Wuxin snorted and left with the strong man with purple hair.

“Swordsman, how could you not be angry? If I were you, I would have killed him,” Chi Mei stood beside Jian Wushuang and said with an interesting smile.

“He’s a contemptible scoundrel, why should I care?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “We should pay more attention to tomorrow’s wedding, Ye Chen, and Ice Nether Valley.”

After coming back to the room, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on his bed and took out the leaf.

“You cost me over 2,000 purple gems. Don’t let me down.”

Jian Wushuang had a slight expectation.

...

Early the next morning, before the sun had even risen over the horizon.

After sitting on the bed for the whole night, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and took a breath as a smile spread across his face.

“It really is a treasure for comprehending World Origin. A leaf which seems plain but contains the power of a whole world, as steady as the Nanyang Continent.”

“Unbelievable!”

“Mysterious.”

Jian Wushuang was happy. After meditating with the leaf for one night, he had a greater understanding of World Origin.

The world in the leaf inspired him a lot.

It’s just one leaf. Jian Wushuang couldn’t help wondering, what about the whole World Tree?

At this moment…

Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!

One by one, the bells tolled in a deep and resonant voice, reverberating through the Ice Nether Valley.

“Is the wedding beginning?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head with a firm and cold light sparkling in his eyes.

When the bell tolled, the experts of all forces, sects, and solitary experts, who had come to Ice Nether Valley, began gathering toward the huge platform at the center of Ice Nether Valley.

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei went there as well.

Lots of people had gathered there, but they were separated into two groups.

One was for experts from forces and sects of the Nanyang Continent.

Almost all the famous sects of the Nanyang Continent had sent representatives. Those who stood at the foremost were from Holy Emperor Palace and Alchemy School, followed by the Two Valleys, Four Temples, and Eight Sects.

Among the eight sects, the Daluo Heaven Sect had replaced the Wilderness Sword Sect as one of the top eight sects after the fight half a year ago.

Those who stood behind them were from old sects of some renown on the Nanyang Continent.

Compared with the top sects, those old sects were much weaker. Magic Cloud Sect was one of the old sects, and Master Wuxin led the representatives from the Magic Cloud Sect.

The other group was the place where solitary experts gathered.

The wedding in the Ice Nether Valley attracted lots of solitary experts. Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei stood with them. However, the people surrounding them stared at them from time to time.

“Are they the men who bought the leaf from the World Tree at the Treasure Auction last night?”

“I heard that Master Wuxin asked to buy the leaf for 1,000 purple gems after the Treasure Auction, but they refused.”

“If I were him, I would refuse too. The leaf is valuable and he paid 2,200 purple gems for it. However, Master Wuxin wants to buy it for only 1,000 purple gems. He must be kidding.”

“No, that was a threat. Wait and see, Master Wuxin can do nothing to them while they are in the Ice Nether Valley, but once they leave, Master Wuxin will go after them.”

Many people were secretly discussing Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei while looking at them with pity in their eyes.

However, Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei were calm and unruffled.

Jian Wushuang looked directly at the place where the experts from those powerful sects gathered.

First, he looked at Holy Emperor Palace.

Holy Emperor Palace had sent three men to attend the wedding. The leader was a strong elder, who seemed like an ordinary man, but he was actually an expert of the Saint Realm. The two others were just Half-saints.

It was normal.

Experts of the Saint Realm had a high-ranking and were core warriors in a sect. Holy Emperor Palace and Alchemy School only had a few of them. It was quite an honor for Holy Emperor Palace to send one to attend the wedding.

The people standing next to them were from the Alchemy School. They were led by Wang Yuan. Jian Wushuang didn’t know the two others, but he could tell that they had already reached Divine Transcendence with a single glance!

Except for Holy Emperor Palace and Alchemy School, Jian Wushuang only glanced at the other sects, paying little attention to them.

Then his eyes turned towards the area with the solitary experts. His eyes immediately focused on a man with a cold face, wearing a blood-red saber on his back.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
