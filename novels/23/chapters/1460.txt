Chapter 1461: Flowing Light Shadow

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang wandered in Sky Sword Prison for a hundred and seventy years. Although he exchanged blows with a large number of experts, he was mostly using the experts to train his swordsmanship and close combat power. He had never thought of putting his opponent to death. He thought it wasn’t time for him to massacre yet.

However, looking at Universe God Long Xiu that day, he took action without hesitation and gave full play to many trump cards to kill Universe God Long Xiu.

He only had one goal in his head, which was to get the secret skill in his hands then.

“Universe God Long Xiu, widely recognized as the first in Sky Sword Prison. His martial art motion was really terrifying. If my Soul Power couldn’t target where his real body was, he could totally use that technique to suppress me and torture me,” Jian Wushuang complimented in silence.

Universe God Long Xiu, he was only at the standard of the third level but he was listed at the top of the third level because of his martial art motion.

Jian Wushuang, of course, cast greedy eyes over Universe God Long Xiu’s martial art motion.

Then, he killed Universe God Long Xiu and obtained the secret skill of martial art motion from the latter, as expected.

“Flowing Light Phantom is a secret skill of martial art motion where one turned into shadow in the void and went shuttling to and fro at terrifying speed. There is a total of five stages.”

“The first stage, one could cast three shadows at once.”

“The second stage, nine shadows!”

“The third stage, eighteen shadows!”

“The fourth stage, ninety-nine shadows!”

“At the fifth stage, also the highest stage, with full power, one could form up to billions of shadows in the void simultaneously.”

Looking at the description of Flowing Light Phantom, Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He knew the secret skill of martial art motion that Universe God Long Xiu possessed was impressive but he didn’t know it was that powerful.

“Universe God Long Xiu depended on this secret skill and got recognized as the top martial art motion in Sky Sword Prison. But in actual fact, he only cultivated to the second stage of the secret skill,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

The second stage of secret skill, which was to cast nine shadows at once.

Previously, when he was fighting a ferocious battle with Universe God Long Xiu, he had only cast nine shadows.

“If the second stage of secret skill is so impressive, just how scary will the following third, fourth and the highest fifth stage be?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

However, he also knew that although the secret skill was impressive, it wouldn’t be easy to cultivate.

If it was merely the first and second stage, it would be easy. He only needed constant practice and continuous mastery to become better.

However, there was a rather high prerequisite for the third stage onwards.

The secret skill of Flowing Light Phantom was a martial art motion that focused on space. From the third stage onwards, it would need to rely on the power of spacetime. Hence, to reach the third stage to perform eighteen shadows, he had to comprehend one of the Supreme Four Doctrines, the Spacetime Doctrine.

It was also the reason why Universe God Long Xiu couldn’t reach the third stage of the secret skill.

After all, he had never once understood Spacetime Doctrine.

“The secret skill of martial art doctrine isn’t ordinary. If I were to successfully cultivate it, I only need to reach the first or the second stage and it’d increased my power tremendously,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

Then, he immediately found a secluded area and started studying the secret skill of Flowing Light Phantom.

Jian Wushuang was a person of quick comprehension and the secret skill of Flowing Light Phantom only had a high prerequisite for the third stage onwards.

As for the first and second stage, it was rather easy, especially the first stage.

Thirty years’ time passed in the blink of an eye. In the thirty years, Jian Wushuang reached the first stage of the secret skill of Flowing Light Phantom through continuous study and practice.

In an empty void, Jian Wushuang stood there. His figure moved suddenly and the three shadows were casted simultaneously.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang instantly appeared in the void ten miles away and immediately plunged again.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Along with Jian Wushuang’s figure moving, the three shadows that he cast continued to plunge as well. The speed was so fast and creepily flexible. No one could tell which was real and which was fake.

Soon, Jian Wushuang’s figure finally stopped and the three shadows vanished into thin air.

“This martial art motion is pretty sick!” There was a glimpse of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Not only did his traveling speed increase terrifyingly and become more flexible after mastering the martial art motion, he also caused his opponent to be deluded by the three shadows.

In the massacre, it would put him at advantage.

“Although it is only the first stage, it has already increased my overall power tremendously, especially in terms of close combat skills. As for the second stage… It took me a total of thirty years to study for the first stage and the second stage will be extremely difficult. I shouldn’t dream of mastering it without a few hundred or a few thousand years. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“A thousand years. It isn’t short. I can only train while I slowly master it.”

Jian Wushuang smiled then he continued his journey of wandering in Sky Sword Prison.

Before that, when Jian Wushuang was wandering, he would rely on his Soul Power to avoid some experts. For example, the Real Gods on the third level. When Jian Wushuang crossed paths with them, he would normally detour to avoid them.

But then, Jian Wushuang was dying to fight against the Real Gods in the third level.

In a barren, dark land, there was a purple palace on the mountainside.

Swoosh!

A young man in a crimson robe carrying a sword on his back appeared before the purple palace directly.

“Real God Peng Yu!”

A bright, clear voice was heard from Jian Wushuang’s mouth. It traveled and naturally spread into the purple palace.

Very quickly, a middle-aged man walked out from the purple place barefoot.

“You are Jian Wushuang?” The middle-aged man, Real God Peng Yu looked at Jian Wushuang, “You look like you want to fight a battle with me?”

Jian Wushuang smiled, “I have to thank Sky Sword Prison. If I were to be outside, I wouldn’t dare to fight against any Real God but now… Real God Peng Yu, you’re the first Real God that I will fight against since I started cultivating. I’d like to see just how strong a Real God expert is!”

“If so, let’s fight,” Real God Peng Yu didn’t waste time and took out a black rod.

The two of them started exchanging blows very quickly.

The moment they started the fight, Jian Wushuang let his power to full play directly. Along with his close combat skill that he had obtained in the recent years, as well as the secret skill of Flowing Light Phantom, his swordsmanship was performed with his all too. However, he didn’t use his Soul Power still.

The battle was extremely ferocious.

Under the situation where his Soul Power was used, although Jian Wushuang was at an advantage with his comprehension of Power of Reincarnation, his unique skill was weaker after all.

Although Real God Peng Yu had never once comprehended Power of Heaven Way, he had created multiple Real God unique skills. Some were even close to intermediate level of Real God unique skill. Relying on his fierce unique skill, Real God Peng Yu could still suppress Jian Wushuang, but he couldn’t kill him.
