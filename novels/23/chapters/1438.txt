Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There was a total of ten destroying lights spurting over.

Jian Wushuang looked calm. He wielded his Blood Mountain Sword and there was a sudden eruption of terrifying divine power.

Rumble. The boundless divine power with the slight bit of Power of Reincarnation that Jian Wushuang had comprehended instantly substantiated and formed a huge, lofty mountain before Jian Wushuang.

The mountain was a few hundred zhang long. It blocked Jian Wushuang himself and the spaceship behind him entirely.

Those destroying lights spurted over and hit on the lofty mountain. In an instant, the mountain shattered and crumbled but the power of the destroying lights dispersed as well.

“What?”

The head of Hei Longshan’s face grew grave.

On the spaceship, the Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group were delighted as they escaped from the disaster. At the same time, they looked at Jian Wushuang, who was outside the spaceship.

“It’s Jian Ke!”

“It’s the helper that Mister Su Hong hired?”

“He blocked the God Slayer Guard’s arrows for us?”

The Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group were shocked.

There was a flash of murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and his ghostly figure plunged.

The scene shocked all the Universe Gods from Hei Longshan.

Hei Longshan was made of tens of thousands of Universe Gods. The Universe God in the Third Heaven before their eyes had charged towards them alone?

“I wonder where this idiot came from. Kill him!” The bald man roared.

Among the crowd from Hei Longshan, there was a large cloud of figures that charged towards Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang humphed and his Soul Power swept out and instantly became a huge crimson phoenix.

The crimson phoenix wailed and its feathers turned into flowing light as it plundered. Without any hindrance, they immersed into the bodies of the experts from Hei Longshan.

In silence, a few hundred figures fell directly.

The scene shocked all Universe Gods from Hei Longshan, as well as from Hong Ri Mercenary Group.

In Hei Longshan camp, the purple-haired young man, Mu Tao, who stood next to the bald man, stared.

The scene before his eyes was too familiar.

Back then, he had seen the exact scene on Ancient Moon Island.

Exactly the same!

Not only was the outcome the same, the movement and pattern was the same too.

Mu Tao’s eyes were locked dead on the ghostly figure in the void before.

He saw clearly. He finally saw the face of the ghostly figure clearly.

In that instant, Mu Tao was frightened out of his wits!

“It’s him!”

“It’s really him!”

Mu Tao stared with his wide-open eyes and his face was filled with terror and fear.

He would never forget the scene on Ancient Moon Island. He would also never forget the person who swept out of Ancient Moon Island alone.

“Run, hurry up and run!”

Mu Tao muttered. His voice was extremely soft, as though he had no strength.

The bald man next to him heard his voice and he looked over, “Mu Tao, what are you talking about?”

“It’s him, the demon!” Mu Tao muttered.

“Demon?” The bald man’s face grew grave but immediately responded, “Would this be the Universe God who destroyed Ancient Moon Island?”

Mu Tao didn’t reply but the bald man got his answer through his expression.

“I see. No wonder he could destroy Ancient Moon Island alone. It turned out that he was an expert who was good at consciousness attacks. Before an expert who was good at consciousness attacks, the amount wouldn’t matter,” the bald man squinted his eyes, then he smiled coldly, “It’s a pity that we Hei Longshan is different from Ancient Moon Island!”

“Ten Kings, come and kill this boy for me!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Ten piercing noises were suddenly heard. Among the crowd, there were ten figures that plunged forward.

The ten of them were wearing bronze armor and they had soaring murderous intentions. They stood in a line before Jian Wushuang as their boundless auras pressured Jian Wushuang.

“It’s the ten Kings!”

“The ten Kings are launching attacks altogether?”

“This boy is going to die.”

The Universe Gods from Hei Longshan saw the ten figures and there was immediately a commotion being stirred up among the crowd.

The ten Kings were second to the few heads of Hei Longshan.

The ten of them were Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven who were extremely powerful and the head of Hei Longshan had paid a huge price to build them up. The divine weapons that they were using and the armor that they were wearing were outstanding. The ten of them had even cultivated a war formation especially to join their forces to fight against their enemy.

With the ten of them joining forces, besides the experts on Universe God ranking list, there shouldn’t be any other Universe God who could win against them.

“Die!”

The ten Kings were extremely quick to action. They appeared before Jian Wushuang instantly.

Then, there were attacks from all directions that landed on Jian Wushuang one after another.

Jian Wushuang looked calm and composed while he wielded his Blood Mountain Sword with a light bit of Power of Transformation.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

The ten attacks were blocked by Jian Wushuang and Jian Wushuang merely took one step back. Then, Blood Mountain Sword slid through the void like a snack and hit the body of two Kings. The two Kings were protected by the bronze armor but they flew backwards when they were hit by the sword light.

“Huh?”

“He could easily block our attacks and instantly counterattack!”

“This boy has strong swordsmanship!”

“One-on-one, none of us is his match. Let’s use war formation!”

The ten Kings discussed and reached a mutual attack style.

Hong!

A terrifying aura soared up. A demonic dragon knight who was a hundred zhang tall and covered under bronze armor appeared in the void.

The demonic dragon knight had soaring murderous intention that struck fear into the surrounding people.

“Formation?” Jian Wushuang looked.

He knew about war formation long ago when he was in Green Fire World. He knew the advantage of the war formation.

Although the individual power of the ten Kings wasn’t strong, when the ten of them joined forces and moved into a war formation, it brought significant pressure to Jian Wushuang.

“Interesting.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and in the next moment, his figure suddenly magnified and became a hundred zhang tall too. His body gave out a dark gold luster and there were five four-angled stars in between his eyebrows, which were shimmering.

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang laughed and his huge divine God body took a huge stride forward. Then, Blood Mountain Sword in his hand that had increased in size too gave out terrifying power.

The demonic dragon rider shook, and the demonic dragon let out a shrill roar. Suddenly, the two huge figures collided together.
