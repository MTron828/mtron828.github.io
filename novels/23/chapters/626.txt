Chapter 627: Skyward Pavillion

“The Ancient Sect?”

Those words caught his eye, so he continued reading.

According to the file, even though this sect was only one of the top sects, it had won as much fame as the three magnates.

“The Master of the Ancient Sect is acknowledged as the number one expert in Firmament Territory, and Xuan Yi from this sect is the best among those in the Eternal Realm. In addition to the Sect Master, there were also three Dao Masters in its long history.”

The information caused Jian Wushuang to have a strange expression on his face.

He was almost lost in those words about the brilliant achievements of the Ancient Sect, which, based on the file, seemed to be more impressive than the three magnates.

The fact that the number one expert in the Firmament Territory was not from the three supreme magnates had been totally beyond his expectation.

What had surprised him even more was that, while there was only one Dao Master in each magnate, there were three in the Ancient Sect.

Three Dao Masters in one sect!

There was no doubt that the Ancient Sect could outshine the three magnates.

“The Ancient Sect.”?

Jian Wushuang repeated the name in secret.

“If the author of this file is not from the Ancient Sect and has not over glorified it, the only logical reason to justify such a magnificent description is that this sect in quite unusual!”

With this assumption, Jian Wushuang continued reading about the other sects.

The rest of the nine sects were actually very normal and not up to par with the three magnates.

Following the nine sects, were many middle-sized and small sects. However, as powerful as they might be, they were no match for the top nine.

After reading through all the information, Jian Wushuang finally understood the general knowledge related to all the sects.

“If I want to gain more benefits, I will have to do my best to join a more powerful sect. The three magnates and the Ancient Sect should be my best choices. If that doesn’t work out, there are the other top sects. As for the middle-sized and small sects, they would be about as helpful to me as adventuring on my own.”

Jian Wushuang was determined to at least join one of the top nine sects.

Of course, he knew it would all be up to the sects.

On the Drill Ground, all one thousand geniuses were waiting in silence.

Three days later, they heard a series of booming sounds and felt a mighty power descending.

“What’s happening?”

They immediately looked up only to see a towering pavilion floating in the sky above them.

The pavilion was as huge as a mountain and had two golden words that seemed to be carved at the center of it—Skyward Pavilion.

“A pavilion?”

“A floating pavilion?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“This pavilion has such an overbearing aura.”

The geniuses all studied it with astonishment and awe in their eyes.

They could feel the aura very clearly.

At the same time, they also noticed that the pavilion had four floors with several rooms on each floor. However, the top floor only had three big rooms. Judging from the awe-inspiring aura that was coming from them, they guessed that those rooms were for the three magnates.

On the third floor, there were nine rooms, representing the top nine sects.

As for the rooms on the first and second floor, they belonged to the small and middle-sized sects.

Inside the center room on the top floor, were the people from Cloud Sea Asgard.

“Your Excellency, the details of the geniuses who have survived the first round are in those two files. This one is for the 900 people from the Eternal World and that one is for the 100 people from the Ancient World.” In the room, a man dressed in white handed two files to an elder.

The elder, who was sitting in a wooden chair, looked like an immortal with black hair. His milky eyes glanced over the man before he accepted the file with the information on geniuses from the Eternal World and began to read it.

As for the other file, he did not even spare it a glance.

The elder quickly finished reading.

“The geniuses this year seem to be more outstanding than in the previous years.” The elder murmured. “We planned to accept three new disciples from them, but it looks like we will have to increase it to five.”

“Your Excellency, do you want to take a look at the information of those geniuses from Ancient World?” The man in white asked gingerly.

“From the Ancient World?”

The elder raised his eyebrows and sneered while saying, “Hell no! They are no match for those from the Eternal World.

“Because of their limited resources, they were born to be inferior to those in the Eternal World regardless of their talent or insight. In addition, their foundations are also inferior. The further they go after reaching the Skyscraping Realm, the nearer they draw to their limitations.

So, I don’t actually think they should be considered geniuses because of their disadvantages and useless cultivation.

“I reckon that less than five among them will survive the second round of the genius battle. I don’t want to waste my time on them.”

Obviously, the elder thought little of those geniuses from the Ancient World.

“On the contrary, I’d love to pay more attention to the shining stars among the geniuses from the Eternal World,” the elder added with a smile.

“Your Excellency, do you need me to send them an invitation now?”

“No, not yet.” The elder continued speaking with an expression of pride, “We can’t make it too easy for them. If they want to be one of our disciples, they will have to show us more of their talent.”

The elder showed his pride as a member of the top sect among the three magnates.
