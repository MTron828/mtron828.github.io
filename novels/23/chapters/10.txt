“I am not wrong. That’s Anonymous Sword Art, Anonymous Sword Art from Sword Marquis Mansion! ” The middle-aged man in a purple robe was astonished and couldn’t help recalling the movements Jian Wushuang had demonstrated earlier.

His movements were too fast. Though Jian Wushuang’s strength was too weak to be a threat, he might not be able to fend off such an attack if it was made by someone on par with him.

It was not his first time witnessing such terrifying swordsmanship.

More than a decade ago, a powerful enemy had attacked the Sword Marquis Mansion and defeated many of its Warriors. The Sword Pavilion Master, Jian Nantian, was the only exception. He alone killed the enemy, using precisely this sword art!

Anonymous Sword Art!

The supreme sword art of Sword Marquis Mansion! It existed only in legends even within Sword Marquis Mansion.

Anonymous sword art was simply too profound and mysterious, such that few could use it even after decades of intensive study, much less master it.

Furthermore, this sword art was a non-inheritable top secret in Sword Pavilion. Only Sword Pavilion Masters had access to study it, with only three of them in history being able to use it.

The Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion may be mighty and extraordinary, but they were nothing compared to the legendary Anonymous sword art.

“This young man actually managed to use the Anonymous Sword Art. Though it was only the First Move, it’s nevertheless incredible. ” The middle-aged man in a purple robe stared at Jian Wushuang.” The one he used before was the Fallen Leaf Sword Art. He has already reached great heights. As for Anonymous Sword Art, it is the lifeblood of Sword Pavilion. Ordinary people completely don’t have the chance to learn it. ”

“He’s so young and only at the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path, but he’s already capable of using so many sword arts of Sword Pavilion. He can even use the legendary Anonymous Sword Art. He must be… ” The middle-aged man seemed to have already guessed Jian Wushuang’s identity and the corners of his mouth lifted. “Interesting! ”

Following the end of the life-or-death battle.

“Mr. Nan, here are your prizes. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The black-robed servant of Gladiator Arena handed Jian Wushuang a wooden box. When he opened it, he saw 11 fragrant ivory pills lying inside, including the one that originally belonged to him.

The odds of the life-or-death battle between Warriors of the Gladiator Arena within the same rank was one to one, but the rank-skipping challenge was ten to one. That was why he chose it.

The greater the risk, the better the harvest.

Jian Wushuang examined the wooden box thoroughly. When he was satisfied, he nodded and was ready to leave.

The black-robed servant stopped him. “Mr. Nan, please wait for a moment. ”

“Is there anything else? ” Jian Wushuang asked, eyes narrowed.

The Gladiator Arena had an exceedingly strong status in the entire Tianzong Dynasty and enjoyed great prestige. Though he didn’t worry about what they would do to him just for a mere 11 First-class Spirit-Cultivating pills, he kept his guard up.

“Our Supervisor watched your duel against Spear Devil and became interested in you, so he’d like to meet you, ” the black-robed servant said.

“Oh? ” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Just then, the middle-aged man in a loose purple robe, flanked by a couple of golden-robed servants, entered slowly.

“Haha. Mr. Nan, isn’t it? I’m Supervisor Bai Chong of the Gladiator Arena. You can call me Sir Bai Chong, ” the man said in a clear and bright voice.

Surprised, Jian Wushuang immediately bowed. “Sir Bai Chong! ”

This man’s status was nearly on par with the Sword Marquis Mansion Master, perhaps higher. Jian Wushuang had to show reverence.

“You can leave now, ” Bai Chong told the black-robed servant, waving a hand. The servant bowed and excused himself.

“Mr. Nan, I suppose the swordsmanship you used to kill Spear Devil is the Anonymous Sword Art of Sword Pavilion? ” Bai Chong smiled faintly at Jian Wushuang and said, “As far as I know, that’s the top secret of Sword Pavilion that only successive Sword Pavilion Masters are allowed to study. Now, the only person in the entire Sword Pavilion who can possibly understand it is Jian Wushuang, the son of the missing Master, Jian Nantian. He’s the only one who has a chance of learning the Anonymous Sword Art due to their relationship. So I’m wondering if you have anything to do with Jian Wushuang. ”

Jian Wushuang’s heart thumped, eyes revealing a hint of panic.

Obviously, Bai Chong was already aware of his identity.

“I was discovered even though I only fought once. ” Jian Wushuang sighed helplessly.

Truthfully, he had inherited the Anonymous Sword Art from his father. This sword art was indeed the top sword art of Sword Pavilion. He had hidden it so well all this while that not even Jian Meng’er was aware of it.

And he had chosen the rank-skipping challenge to get all the First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills he needed in one go because he was worried someone would recognize him if he showed up too much in the Gladiator Arena. Participating in one battle lowered those chances.

Yet he was forced to use his strongest skill, Anonymous Sword Art, against Spear Devil. He didn’t expect a sharp-eyed man to be watching him among the crowd.

“I’m just kidding. ” Noticing the surprise in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, Bai Chong immediately understood the situation and faked a laugh. “From the looks of it, you seem to urgently need First-class Spirit-cultivating Pills. Is that right, Mr. Nan? ”

“Yes. ” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Well, these First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills are beneficial to Spirit Path Warriors but they require a long time to be absorbed. You may have 11 First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills now but you’ll need at least a year to take in all of them, ” Bai Chong said.

“You’re right. ” Jian Wushuang nodded but was disagreeing with him internally.

It was true that other people would need at least a year to take in 11 First-class Spirit-cultivating Pills. But he was different…

He was a Deviant Cultivator who cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill!

Thanks to the amazing power of the Heavenly Creation Skill, he could absorb these First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills very quickly. It wouldn’t even take him a month to absorb all of them!

“It’s too time-consuming to absorb all these First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills. If you want to boost your strength in a short amount of time, it doesn’t seem realistic to merely rely on them, ” Bai Chong said.

“Sir Bai Chong, what are you trying to say? ” Jian Wushuang asked, frowning.

Bai Chong smiled at him. “Mr. Nan, have you heard of Primordial Spiritual Liquid? ”
