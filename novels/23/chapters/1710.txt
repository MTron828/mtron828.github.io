Chapter 1711: Fly Into A Rage

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

This was a crimson world.

The sky contained a crimson sun. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

At the center of the crimson world, there was a bloody hole.

It was a lofty hall. On the walls of the big hall, there were many gigantic and hideous faces. The eyes of the faces were so sinister and vicious that they made people fearful of them.

The three Sir God experts, the gloomy old man, God Qi and God Ba were in the big hall. However, at present, the three of them no longer had the airs of superiority of a Sir God expert. On the contrary, they were on their knees and bowing down. It was to the extent that they knelt down straight away and they were trembling in fear.

There was no other reason. The only reason was that His Highness Mu Hong had died.

“Died. Hong’er has actually died?”

A golden-robed figure was sitting down at the highest position of the big hall. He wore a crimson ghost mask and his looks could not be seen clearly. However, the gloomy, shocking murderous intent that he was currently releasing had caused the three Sir Gods below to shiver in fear.

“The mission this time around is not considered too difficult. By my logic, if we were to send two Sir God experts over, as long as they were careful, they would also be able to complete the mission. However, I sent the three of you and Hong’er there. Do you know why I did that?” the strange eyes that the golden-robed figure revealed were looking down at the three people.

The three of them was shaking in fear. Of course, they knew the reason why the Lord in front of them had sent them there.

It was naturally to protect and assist His Highness Mu Hong. However, in the end…

“Although Hong’er has died, the three of them survived,” the golden-robed figure struck the seat with his hands and an invisible power spread across the area.

“Puff!””Puff!””Puff!”

At that moment, the three Sir Gods who were kneeling down in the big hall spit out blood at the same time and their expressions turned deathly-pale immediately.

However, such a situation did not cause the three of them to tremble in fear. Instead, they were quite happy.

Because, they were still alive.

“Thank you Lord, for sparing us,” the three of them kowtowed and said gratefully.

“If not for now being a critical period and the fact that I lack people, the three of you would have died!” an ice-cold voice could be heard from the golden-robed figure. “The person who killed Hong’er… was that Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s him,” the gloomy old man who was kneeling down on the ground continued speaking: “This Jian Wushuang is a lot stronger than what the Real God ranking list has introduced him to be. It is obvious that his abilities have risen again during this short hundreds of years of time and the current him is probably considered extremely strong among the Sir Gods!”

“Haha, Jian Wushuang. When I heard his name last time, it was when his identity as an Inverse Cultivator was exposed. At that time, he had merely achieved the fighting capabilities of an Eternal Real God. From then to now, how long has it been? He has actually gotten himself established among the Sir Gods. If we were to give him another period of time, wouldn’t I be unable to do anything against him as well?”

“What about the Acheron Palace? Could it be that the Acheron Palace is sitting by and doing nothing? With such a huge threat present, they have still not gotten rid of it. Could it be that they really want to wait for him to become a Great Emperor who is an extremely high level before taking action?”

The golden-robed figure was roaring. His voice was so loud that it echoed within the big hall continuously.

“Please go and send a message to the Acheron Palace. If the Acheron Palace is really that useless, then they can simply become the Holocaust Sect’s underling and take orders from us. The Holocaust Sect shall then be the one to deal with Jian Wushuang.”

“If the Acheron Palace is still of some use, they had better kill Jian Wushuang while it’s still early. I will only give them one thousand years of time. Within one thousand years, if Jian Wushuang were to not die, I shall cut the connections between the Holocaust Sect and the Acheron Palace!”

…

In the dark starry sky, there was a dark land floating about.

Many lofty mountains stood tall and upright on the land. The mountains were a million feet tall. Even the smallest one was more than a hundred thousand feet tall.

At the center of the mountains, there was a dark divine hall which was floating quietly in the air.

Within the vast hall, guards who were covered by dim light were standing tall and upright. Under the eyes of those guards, a black-robed figure came to the big hall and reported some information.

“Oh, the son of the Holocaust Sect’s Seventh Palace Master has died? And he was killed by Jian Wushuang?”

A deep, hoarse voice reverberated within the big hall. Although the voice seemed to come from all directions, the speaker had never shown himself.

“Hmph, his son has always been a piece of trash. If he is dead, it means that he has really died. However, the Seventh Palace Master actually unleashed his fury on the Acheron Palace. What a joke.”

“However, this matter has also given us a reminder. Jian Wushuang… his speed of improvement is too fast!”

“Hundreds of years ago, he merely wounded Sir God Qian Lan fatally in the Eighth Lair. However, at that time, Sir God Qian Lan did not go all-out, nor did he fight with all his might. Comparing abilities, he was not weaker than Jian Wushuang. However, now, in just a short few hundreds of years, he killed a Sir God. Moreover, he killed the Sir God while he was under the protection of three Sir Gods.”

“With such a fast speed of improvement, if the Acheron Palace wishes to kill him, it will soon be too late. Looks like we can no longer place our hopes on the Soaring Heaven King Palace. We have to be the ones to do it ourselves. Moreover, we have to do it immediately.

The Acheron Palace had always been hidden extremely deeply within the darkness and they would not take action easily. Moreover, they would not take action unless there was a need to.

Previously, they had thought that since Jian Wushuang was fighting with the Soaring Heaven King Palace, they would leave them to continue fighting and let the Soaring Heaven King Palace kill Jian Wushuang.

However, at that time, they had to do it themselves.

“Devise a plan to assassinate Jian Wushuang immediately. Moreover, for the devised plan, there must be more than a ninety-percent chance of assassinating him successfully. Within one thousand years, we must complete the assassination of Jian Wushuang. The Acheron Palace will not allow such a top genius to continue living even for another one thousand years!” the hoarse, deep voice ordered.

“Alright,” the respectful black-robed man who was awaiting his orders nodded his head. After that, he started to make preparations.

The Acheron Palace was definitely a dark powerhouse that the Sanctuary Alliance was most worried about.

Its level of threat was even higher than that of the Holocaust Sect.

After all, although the Holocaust Sect was evil and they would massacre wantonly, the people who they massacred were mostly weaklings. However, the Acheron Palace focused on assassinating higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance as well as geniuses.

Furthermore, as soon as the Acheron Palace set themselves to killing a person and devised an assassination plan in detail, the probability of the expert surviving the assassination would definitely be less than ten percent.

At that moment, the Acheron Palace had started to devise the assassination plan to assassinate Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was completely clueless about it.

He knew that the talents and potential that he had revealed would definitely attract the attention of some dark powerhouses. However, he did not know that the dark powerhouses would think so highly of him. Moreover, he did not have a very good understanding of the techniques and abilities of the dark powerhouses. However, as he had made ample preparations and was vigilant, he was not that afraid of them.
