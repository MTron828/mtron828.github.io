Chapter 874: Opportunity

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Boom!

A powerful aura rolled up an overwhelming hurricane and engulfed Jian Wushuang.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang’s face turned pale since he found it was too late to contend against if he regrouped the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. He had to exert his strongest move with the Blood Mountain Sword.

This was the fourth move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art that he studied carefully for years.

As for Boundless Heaven Sword Art, one move was stronger than another. The fourth move was stronger than the third one.

The high-class Blood Demon slashed out his outrageous saber.

Bang!

The power exploded with a thud.

An incredible power sprayed to Jian Wushuang and made his hands quivered. Thereupon his Blood Mountain Sword was compelled to fly off from his hand.

Whereafter, the high-class Blood Demon brandished the saber and chopped Jian Wushuang to death only in one second.

But because of the special restriction, nobody would lose his life on Star Island. Therefore, Jian Wushuang quickly repaired his body and appeared outside the black tower.

Stood at the foot of the black tower, Jian Wushuang looked up at it and still felt a little scared.

“Too powerful!”

“The high-class Blood Demon was dozens of times stronger than the low-grade Blood Demon at least.”

“He smashed my Ninth-heaven Sword Formation just by one blow and vibrated my longsword away by another blow, and finally he killed me. So horrible!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“He is much more stronger than me!”

Jian Wushuang showed a startled expression.

He had thought that few people could overcome him since his current strength was at the peak of the Eternal Realm.

But now, only a special Puppet Fighter easily triumphed over him.

He could recognize that the Puppet Fighter was only in the Eternal Realm, far away from the realm of Dao Master, but outclassed him so much.

“This high-class Blood Demon is more powerful than me. I have to reach the fifth level on Sword Heart if I want to contend against him. Furthermore, I need master the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation better.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

There were much room for his improvement in strength.

He had reached the peak of Level Four on Sword Heart, only one step away from Level Five.

His strength would skyrocket as soon as he reached the Level Five.

In addition, he was unable to give full play to the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation in that he only mastered it at the preliminary stage.

The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation contained three formations. The first sword formation, Traceless Sword, had costed him much time and energy to study.

Jian Wushuang just started to master this heavy sword formation. His achievement was only in the Intial Realm according to the division of realm. There was a long way to go before he reached the Profound Realm, let alone the Exceptional Realm.

With regard to the Second Sword Formation, it was totally vain for him.

If he reached the Level Five on Sword Heart and the Profound Realm on the first step of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, he was qualified to battle with the high-class Blood Demon. Of course, it was still hard to say whether he could defeat his opponent.

“However, I still have the chance to break through the Level Two test.” Jian Wushuang was confident of himself.

“Blood Mountain.”

As a voice emerged, the bald teenager, Qian Yu, who had talked to Jian Wushuang a lot, walked towards him, “How’s it going?”

“Not bad. I broke through the Level One, but get killed in the Level Two.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Broke through the Level One?” Qian Yu looked at Jian Wushuang in amazement and then he laughed, “Haha! Only 12 Kings on Star Island passed the Level One. You’re the thirteenth! 12 kings has become the 13 kings.”

“Let’s go! Let me take you around the Star Island. Just let them envy.”

Qian Yu was going to take Jian Wushuang away in excitement.

It was so fevered for them to flaunt something since they had been trapped on Star Island for so many years.

But Jian Wushuang shook his head, “There’s no need. Qian Yu. You told me there is some opportunity on Star Island?”

“That’s for sure.”

Qian Yu nodded, “These opportunities are unusual. Just because of them, people like me who are locked up here have a little hope to leave. Without them, it’s impossible for us to pass the tests in black tower if only depends on our efforts.”

Jian Wushuang agreed.

Only the Level Two of black tower was too difficult to break through, much less the Level Three.

Without the assistance of opportunity, it was hopeless to pass the test only by virtue of their aimless and individual studying.

“There are two kinds of opportunities on Star Island, Star Jade Wall and Nine Secret Skills.” Qian Yu began to narrate.

“Everyone can possess Star Jade Wall. People like us who have nothing important to do will go to cultivate under the Star Jade Wall.”

“As for the other opportunity, Nine Secret Skills, it has many limitations.”

“The Lord Spirit Sound made a rule that only those who have broken the Level One test are qualified to cultivate the Nine Secret Skills. That means only 12 kings are eligible to cultivate. But they are only allowed to select one Secret Skill to cultivate.”

“And Dao Masters are also able to select one Secret Skill to cultivate.”

“Like the five Dao Masters on Star Island, they all cultivate one Secret Skill. There is few chance to pass the test when they were in the Eternal Realm. So four of them chose to reach the Dao Master Realm when occasion served in order to get a chance to leave by virtue of the cultivation of Nine Secret Skills.”

“Get a chance?”Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Blood Mountain. Let me tell you. Although the test to Eternal Realm is hard enough, there is still a little hope. The strongest king among the 12 kings already passed the Level Two test, not far away from getting through the Level Three test.”

“But the test to Dao Masters is much more difficult than that to the Eternal Realm. Even the five Dao Masters on Star Island, who have cultivated one of the Nine Secret Skills, failed to pass the Level One test. So you can image how difficult it is.”Qian Yu said.
