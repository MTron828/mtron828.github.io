Chapter 3577: Supreme Lingyun

“Little guy, let me introduce myself first. I’m from Planet Lingyun, and I’m Wind Demon, the fourth among the Seven Devils under Planet Lingyun!” The Golden War God said grandly, “My master is the Star Master of Planet Lingyun, Supreme Lingyun.”

“Planet Lingyun? Supreme Lingyun?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

In his eyes, this Golden War God was terrifyingly powerful. He did not expect that he had a master behind him?

“Supreme? Above the Ruler Realm is the Supreme Realm?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Yes, above the Ruler Realm is the Supreme Realm.” The Golden War God smiled faintly. “Among them, the Ruler Realm cultivators are indeed top experts in some barren places in the universe. However, in the deepest part of the universe, they are nothing. Unless they are some of the top Rulers, they can be considered as a figure in the deepest part of the universe. In the deepest part of the universe, the Supreme Realm is the expert who stands at the top of the pyramid!”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang was shocked, but he quickly calmed down. He looked at the Golden War God in surprise. “If I’m not wrong, you’re also a supreme-being, aren’t you?”

“Yes, I’m also a supreme-being.” The Golden War God nodded. “I’m not the only one. The other six demons who are as famous as me are also experts at the Supreme Realm. Although they are also supreme-beings, there are still differences in strength. For example, as one of the seven demons of Lingyun Star, my strength is extremely strong even among supreme-beings!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“However, even if we join hands, we are still nothing in front of my master. He had reached the top of the Supreme Realm many years ago. Later, he became even more powerful and became invincible among the supreme-beings. Even in the deepest part of the universe, where there are as many experts as clouds, my master is definitely an overlord. With a stomp of his foot, the entire universe will tremble. As for a supreme-being like me, he can destroy it with a wave of his hand.”

Hearing the Golden War God’s words, Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked.

The Golden War God in front of him was a super existence that terrified him. How could he be annihilated with a wave of his hand in front of his master, Star Master Lingyun? It was obvious how powerful Star Master Lingyun was.

“Little guy, I’m not telling you this for other reasons. I just want to tell you that the special space you’re in now was left behind by my master. The eighteen-ultimate formation you just passed on the high platform was also a test left behind by my master. According to the rules of Planet Lingyun, anyone who can pass the eighteen-ultimate formation can become a disciple of Planet Lingyun. He or she is an inner star disciple, and his or her status is no lower than mine.” The Golden War God stared at Jian Wushuang with his golden eyes.

“Become a disciple of Planet Lingyun?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He was not too surprised. He was very clear about the difficulty of the eighteen ultimate formations. It could be said that he was indeed heaven-defying. If it were any other cultivator…it was simply impossible for him to create an advanced level seven skill at the level of an Immortal Saint.

With the tyrannical strength and status of the Star Master of Planet Lingyun, it was impossible for him to set up such a difficult test for no reason. It was very likely that the test was to select disciples for Planet Lingyun.

The Golden War God had not shown up when Jian Wushuang was trapped in the 18-ultimate formation. He only told him this when Jian Wushuang passed the test.

“Little guy, I ask you, do you want to join Planet Lingyun and become an inner disciple of Planet Lingyun?” The Golden War God asked seriously.

“Well...” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and did not answer immediately, instead, he asked, “Lord Wind Demon, you mentioned just now that Star Master Lingyun is an extraordinary supreme-being. Even in the deepest part of the universe, he is an overlord. But if I’m not wrong, it must have been many years ago, right?”

Jian Wushuang was not stupid. If Star Master Lingyun had always been like that, how could this special space-time come to this territory, moreover, it had existed in the deepest unexplored area of Devil Smoke Valley for so many years.

“You’re right. What I just said was a long time ago. It has been more than 100 chaos cycles since then,” the Golden War God said.

“More than 100 chaos cycles?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He knew that it was only one chaos cycle when a grade-3 Earth Star was born and completely annihilated.

What was the concept of hundreds of chaos cycles?

Jian Wushuang could not even calculate how many years it had been.

“At that time, our Planet Lingyun was indeed an overlord in the deepest part of the universe. My master’s strength was enough to intimidate countless experts. However, there was an accident that led to a great change in our Planet Lingyun. Our experts died and were injured. Many people escaped from the depths of the universe and fled to every corner of the universe. For example, I fled here with this space-time. Because of my heavy injuries, I have been sleeping for a long time. This time, I woke up because of you,” the Golden War God said, his expression darkened.

However, he continued, “Even though that incident caused Planet Lingyun to be on the verge of collapse, there are still many experts from the Lingyun lineage scattered throughout the universe. There’s also master!”

“Master, although he was heavily injured in that battle, I know that he didn’t die. His strength has reached his level. It’s too difficult for anyone in this universe to kill him!”

“As long as master doesn’t die, Planet Lingyun will have a chance to rise again. My brothers and I are waiting here quietly. We will recover our strength and return to the deepest part of the universe when master gives the order!”

“So, don’t underestimate Planet Lingyun.”

Jian Wushuang was speechless.

He did not mean to underestimate Planet Lingyun. He just wanted to have a deeper understanding of Planet Lingyun.

But now, he understood almost everything.

Planet Lingyun used to be an overlord in the deepest part of the universe. However, hundreds of chaos cycles ago, the entire planet collapsed and countless experts fled in all directions. However, Star Master Lingyun did not die, it was entirely possible for Planet Lingyun to rise again.

“Little fellow, I’ve said so much. I’ve told you everything you need to know. Now, you can answer me. Are you willing to join our Lingyun lineage or not?” The Golden War God said.
