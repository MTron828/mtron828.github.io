Chapter 1611: Betting On A Match!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Real God Tian Ming’s voice could be heard from the Fighting Space and many Real Gods looked at Jian Wushuang at once.

“Seems like this Real God Tian Ming still remembers the training time of mine in the Fairy Palace,” Jian Wushuang laughed and he leaped onto the Fighting Space.

Real God Tian Ming was sneering at Jian Wushuang. He had originally thought that Jian Wushuang would not dare to fight with him. At that very moment, he merely spoke so that he would make Jian Wushuang lose face. However, he did not expect Jian Wushuang to actually come to the Fighting Space.

“This little kid has actually come in,” Real God Tian Ming’s smile froze at once and he became elated after that, “Jian Wushuang, are we still going to bet on the training time in the Fairy Palace?”

“How many years do you wish to bet on?” Jian Wushuang walked over slowly and he appeared in front of Real God Tian Ming in the blink of an eye.

“Last time, when you had only just come to the Thunderbolt Island, you still had a lot of training time in the Fairy Palace. Hence, I wanted to bet fifty years’ time with you. However, you have stayed in the Thunderbolt Island for quite some time now and you have definitely used up a considerable amount of training time in the Fairy Palace. Thus, we shall not bet fifty years this time around. How about just twenty years?” Real God Tian Ming said.

In actual fact, he really wanted to bet fifty years with Jian Wushuang.

However, he was worried that Jian Wushuang would be like the previous time when he was ‘stunned.’ As such, he said twenty years instead.

“Twenty years? No problem.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head straight away.

“Haha, great!” Real God Tian Ming laughed loudly.

The Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hands and sword essence rose from his body.

“When Real God Tian Ming bet a match with me one-thousand-five-hundred years ago, I had no confidence at all and I could only decline. But now… my abilities have already reached the maximum that I could attain as a Universe God of the Third Heaven. Thus, as of the current moment, I am not afraid of Real God Tian Ming in the slightest bit.”

“The most important thing now is that I’m still lacking an opportunity to make a breakthrough. Since someone wants to bet on a match with me, how can I reject him?”

Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically and his eyes were overflowing with coldness.

The whole Fighting Space became completely dead silent.

Outside the Fighting Space, many experts were observing the match closely.

All of a sudden… Swish!

Jian Wushuang moved right away.

A total of one hundred shadows burst forth at once. Every shadow was as fast as a ghost and they were shuttling back and forth in the space.

In a split second, the whole Fighting Space was filled with shadows that were moving around crazily.

“This is…”

“What a strange martial art motion. Its speed is extremely fast!”

“In order to execute such a kind of martial art motion, it would minimally require one’s comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine to be able to clear the third level of the Doctrine Palace.”

The Real Gods who were observing the match from outside the Fighting Space were surprised.

As they were all quite experienced, they were all certain as to what an impressive level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine Jian Wushuang must be at in order for his shadows to have such a speed.

When Real God Tian Ming saw so many shadows which could cover the sky, he laughed coldly.

“This is nothing.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, Real God Tian Ming held the silver long rod in his hands tightly and swung it in front of him fiercely.

Rumble~~~ Rays of silver light appeared. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Initially, there was only one long rod. However, at that very moment, thousands upon thousands of rays of silver, glittering light that were formed by the silver long rod had appeared abruptly and they covered the whole space completely. They then headed toward Jian Wushuang’s shadows and covered them, causing every shadow to be pierced and dissipate straight after. In the end, only Jian Wushuang’s real body alone was left.

However, Jian Wushuang simply took a few simple strides and he easily avoided the rays of silver, glittering light that were heading toward him just like fish which were escaping hurriedly. His body then appeared in front of Real God Tian Ming.

The Blood Mountain Sword was swung out instantly.

The stroke contained a Real God’s Divine Power that Jian Wushuang could unleash at that very moment as well as Reincarnation Power.

Real God Tian Ming also held his rod with both his hands and he swung it abruptly.

Bam!

Jian Wushuang and Real God Tian Ming’s body were forced to retreat by quite a number of steps due to the impact.

“Reincarnation Doctrine?” Real God Tian Ming frowned and glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“Haha. Time to try this move,” Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically. With a swing of his big hands, mighty Reincarnation Power appeared and changed into a grey air current. The grey air current was then combined and changed into a big grey world.

Straight away after that, the grey world headed toward Real God Tian Ming.

“That’s… Reincarnation World?”

“What a guy. This is only something an expert can execute when his comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine is able to clear the third level of the Doctrine Palace!”

“This Jian Wushuang is merely a Universe God. However, his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine and Reincarnation Doctrine has achieved the standards to clear the third level of the Doctrine Palace?”

“Impressive!”

The experts who were observing the match from outside the Fighting Space could not help but be shocked.

When Real God Tian Ming saw such a scene, his eyes shrank.

“Power of All Creation!”

“Break!”

As Real God Tian Ming shouted, within the Fighting Space, buzz~~~ Green mist which could cover the sky burst forth. At the same time, vegetation appeared in the sky out of thin air with many tall and strong trees rising upward. In particular, the most humongous tree was at least over ten-thousand feet tall.

At that very moment, the whole Fighting Space became full of life and blocked off the grey world completely.

“This is… Life Doctrine?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned grave.

The vast Heaven Way was split into the Supreme Four Doctrines and the Nine Heaven God Doctrines.

Within the Supreme Four Doctrines, apart from the Reincarnation Doctrine, Spacetime Doctrine and Extermination Doctrine, the last remaining doctrine was the Life Doctrine.

For the Life Doctrine, life would grow and multiply endlessly.

At that very moment, the move that Real God Tian Ming had unleashed was one of the techniques of the Life Doctrine known as Power of All Creation.

“Jian Wushuang, I admit that your abilities are stronger than what I have expected. However, the end result will still be the same,” Real God Tian Ming was surrounded by endless vegetation and he had a huge amount of aura. With a swing of the silver long rod in his hands, rumble~~~ An enormous amount of vegetation around him stretched outward crazily and headed toward Jian Wushuang like spiritual snakes.

Jian Wushuang’s body was shrouded in sword essence. The sword essence then changed into numerous rays of sword lights in a split second and headed toward the ‘spiritual snakes’ which were charging toward him.

The spiritual snakes were torn apart by the rays of sword light into pieces. However, many spiritual snakes continued to attack and it was endless as it seemed that they were growing and multiplying endlessly.

“It’s useless.”

“This is the Life Realm that Real God Tian Ming’s Power of All Creation created. The vegetation within the realm will grow and multiply endlessly. Even if they are cut off, they will grow again. Unless one is able to use brute force to destroy the whole Life Realm, Real God Tian Ming will be invincible!”

“Real God Tian Ming’s comprehension of the Life Doctrine is too high and it is probably very close to being able to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace. Among the twenty-seven picture scrolls of the Life Fairy Palace, he has most probably comprehended the eleventh picture scroll completely already.”
