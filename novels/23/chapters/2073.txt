2074 Outrageously Unreasonable

“King Chen Xing, do you submit!?”

The voice of Jian Wushuang was so loud that it could be heard above cloud nine. It was as though his voice represented the will of Heaven Way as it reverberated through heaven and earth.

Upon witnessing this sight, the surrounding Ancient Gods respected Jian Wushuang even more.

Within the ditch, King Chen Xing stood and looked up. Two thin rays of light burst forth.

“Jokes!”

King Chen Xing bellowed and tried to move.

Jian Wushuang stood tall in the void. Four of his hands gripped his Blood Mountain Sword tightly.

He used Blast Rainstorm from Sword Principle Xuan Luo again.

“Get Down!!!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed. King Chen Xing, who was trying to fly out of the ditch, was once again flooded by sword lights. He dropped back into the ditch again.

“Do you submit!?” Jian Wushuang yelled once again.

“Bastard!” King Chen Xing cursed.

Jian Wushuang swung his sword once again.

Boom! The entire earth shook.

“Do you submit!?” Jian Wushuang yelled again.

“You wish!” King Chen Xing replied.

Boom! Another wave of sword light came.

“Do you submit!?”

“You…”

Boom!

“Do you submit!?”

“Never!”

Boom!

“Do you submit!?”

...

The Ancient Gods watching this battle were dumbfounded.

Their eyes widened as they saw the scene.

They saw that Jian Wushuang kept on swinging his sword and kept on asking if King Chen Xing would submit. When King Chen Xing refused to submit, he would be met with another wave of sword light from Jian Wushuang.

King Chen Xing was obviously a punching bag and had no chance to fight back.

This method Jian Wushuang was using to get King Chen Xing to submit shocked the remaining Ancient Gods present.

It was domineering and unreasonable!

Yes. Jian Wushaung was like a gangster, utterly unreasonable and domineering.

He did not waste any time with King Chen Xing by trying to persuade him to submit.

He simply asked a simple question: ‘Do you submit?’

If the reply was no, he would attack.

Jian Wushuang would attack until King Chen Xing decided to submit even though he was already buried in the ground.

King Chen Xing was one of the most powerful Nine-star Ancient Gods. His fighting power had reached stage two but he still was no match for Jian Wushuang.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Jian Wushuang used the fuller to perform his sword skills. Each impact made a loud sound that could be heard clearly. Clearly, he was using power to suppress King Chen Xing.

King Chen Xing had no chance to recover himself as the endless waves of sword skills collided with his back.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang attacked numerous times. Each time he attacked he asked King Chen Xing to submit.

Initially, King Chen Xing would struggle madly and had wanted to fight back. After a while, he stopped.

Boom!

Another collision occurred, and King Chen Xing was completely buried underground.

“Do you submit!?” Jian Wushuang bellowed once more.

At the bottom of the crater, King Chen Xing kept quiet. He thought for a while before he growled, “I will only submit if you can be recognized by my father.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrow as he stopped his sword in mid-air.

King Chen Xing could finally catch his breath before he rose from the crater.

King Chen Xing was in a bad state; his hair was messy, there were blood stains on his lips and his silver armor had several gashes left by a sword. He stood there with anger in his eyes.

However, there was fear too.

Yes, fear.

During the brief battle, he had become fearful of Jian Wushuang

Jian Wushuang had given him a mental scar from his unreasonable actions and his terrifying fighting power.

Since his birth in the first era till now, he had never met a person so unreasonable. To make matters worse, this person was stronger than him.

“King Chen Xing, you just said that if I could be recognized by your father, you would submit to me. Your father is the first Ancient God Emperor, how can I get his recognition?” Jian Wushuang asked.

King Chen Xing took a deep breath before he spoke. “My father was one of the strongest men alive back in the first era. Even though my father died when the first era ended, he left behind a conscience within an old grave. This grave is located within the within the Ancient God Sanctuary.”

“All you need to do is to enter the Ancient Emperor Grave and gain the recognition of my father’s conscience. If you can do so, I will support you in becoming our new emperor. I will listen to your orders without fail. However, if you cannot, I will never listen to you even if everyone else does.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Ancient Emperor Grave?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Master, within the Ancient God Sanctuary, there is an Ancient Emperor Grave. According to legend, the Ancient God Emperor did leave a consciousness within. King Chen Xing is not lying,” The King of Venomous Worms whispered to Jian Wushang.

Jian Wushuang nodded his head lightly before looking at King Luo Yu.

“King Luo Yu!” The voice reverberated in the air.

Beside the pile of ruins of what used to be the estate, King Luo Yu and the other Ancient Gods were waiting patiently. They saw what had just happened with their own eyes.

At that point in time, King Luo Yu, King Gu You, King Gu Tong and the remaining Ancient Gods were dumbfounded.

They came back to their senses after Jian Wushuang shouted for King Luo Yu. They started walking towards Jian Wushuang.

Those who supported King Chen Xing did not stop them.

“Sword Emperor”

King Luo Yu walked beside Jian Wushuang and saluted him. It was obvious that he respected the Sword Emperor even more than he had before.

This was normal as the only reason he supported Jian Wushuang in being the new emperor was because he had the bloodline of emperors.

He had not considered the fighting power of the Sword Emperor.

Now... King Chen Xing, who was a Nine-star Ancient God and had the fighting power of a stage two great emperor, had been crushed in a battle against the Sword Emperor.

This fighting power alone surprised him as he was fully convinced that the Sword Emperor had the ability to be the new emperor.

Everyone else who had just watched the battle was convinced too.

Even though bloodline power was supreme in the Ancient God Clan, they would still respect the people who were powerful.

Jian Wushuang not only had the bloodline of emperors, he also had the strongest fighting power in the clan.

To get the right to become the new emperor of the Ancient God Clan, one had to possess both qualities.
