Chapter 2109 Emperor God Jue Xian

“Soul attack secret skill?”Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen looked at each other helplessly.

“Among the great emperors within the Sanctuary Alliance, no one excels in soul attacks. There are such secret skills within the library inside the alliance, but their level is too low for you.” Emperor Bai frowned. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That’s right. A great emperor who excels in soul attacks, especially you who can use the Soul Swallowing Pearl, is very valuable in the battle against the Three Emperors World. However, the Sanctuary Alliance is lacking in soul attack secret skills of the top-tier level.” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded his head in agreement.

Sanctuary Alliance had many powerful secret skills, many of which originated from the first era or even the Ancient Past.

However, their soul attack secret skills…

First of all, a soul attack secret skill was extremely rare and much more valuable compared to a normal secret skill, much less a top tier soul attack secret skill.

Even though the soul attack secret skills within the alliance could elevate his soul attack to a high level, it would still be far from the maximum possible power level.

They hoped that Jian Wushuang could use his soul attack to create a big advantage in the upcoming battle.

“I might know of one set of secret skills that can perfectly bring out your soul power to create collateral damage among the experts from the Three Emperor World,” Ancestor Tian Chen said suddenly.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai both looked over.

“Emperor God Jue Xian!” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Him? Yes, the soul attack secret skill he has is very powerful.” Emperor Bai nodded his head in agreement.

“Who is this Emperor God Jue Xian?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

He had not heard of this expert before.

“Sword Emperor, as you know, the Eternal Chaotic World is facing grave danger. Hence, many experts who were unheard of previously emerged from hiding. Emperor God Jue Xian is one such expert. He is ranked highly on the emperor god Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.” Ancestor Tian Chen smiled.

“Oh? It has been a long time since I last looked at this list.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Indeed. You probably don’t even know your own ranking on the ranking list.” Ancestor Tian Chen teased.

“That is true. What is my ranking?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Second to only Emperor Bai. Abysmal Saint Master is third, Red Dragon King is fourth and I am ranked fifth.” Ancestor Tian Chen smiled.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He was not surprised that he was ranked second.

Within the Sanctuary Alliance, only Emperor Bai could beat him in a battle.

He was surprised at the ranking of the Abysmal Saint Master.

Abysmal Saint Master was a top tier stage one great emperor. He was still far from a stage two great emperor, unlike the Red Dragon King who was a legit stage two great emperor.

However, now, the Abysmal Saint Master was ranked higher than the Red Dragon King.

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s confusion, Ancestor Tian Chen continued to explain, “Abysmal Saint Master was already very powerful. He had been cultivating a secret skill from the ancient past for the longest of time and was at a bottleneck for a very long time without improving. When he came back from the Three Emperor World, he had some inspiration and managed to break through soon after you left for the Special Tribes. Once there was a breakthrough in that secret skill, his power level skyrocketed and he became a stage two great emperor.”

“After the breakthrough, the Abysmal Saint Master went to look for the Red Dragon King and they had a skirmish. The result was that the Abysmal Saint Master won by a small margin. After that skirmish, the ranking changed.”

“Is that the case?” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and felt happy for the Abysmal Saint Master.

They had had some resentment before. Now that they had made peace with each other, they had a pretty good relationship.

“Sword Emperor, you know his character. He does not like being inferior to others, that’s why he went to challenge the Red Dragon King. I think he will come and challenge you next.” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Haha, let him come then.” Jian Wushuang laughed as he did not mind it at all.

“We are getting off topic. Let’s continue talking about this Emperor God Jue Xian. His strength and understanding of Dao is not top tier among the emperor gods. However, just because of the terrifying soul attack secret skill he has, he can threaten even a top tier emperor god.” Ancestor Tian Chen continued.

“During the battle that made him well known, he fought two top tier emperor gods. However, once his soul attack was cast, the two emperor gods experienced a short blank in their consciousness. Even though they were well prepared, they still suffered under the effect of the soul attack.”

“Furthermore, according to the intel the Sanctuary Alliance gathered, the soul power of this Emperor God Jue Xian have yet to reach the level of a top tier emperor god.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was interested.

An emperor god whose soul power who had yet to reach the level of a top tier emperor god could affect two such experts with a soul attack, even when the two were well prepared?

The soul attack that this emperor god had must be…

“The intel department went to dig deeper into his history and found out this: he does not have any soul attack treasures; he obtained a soul attack secret skill which originated from the ancient past within the ancient battlefield which surrounded the Green Fire World.”

“The soul attack secret skill was incredibly powerful. Not only in the aspect of a single target soul attack, it could cause collateral damage as well. He cast the soul attack against a group of twenty almighties, in which there were a few emperor gods. Once his soul attack was cast, five sir gods died immediately while the remaining almighty, including the emperor gods, experienced a blank in their consciousness.”

“Hence, we can confirm that the soul attack secret skill he has can target groups of people.” Ancestor Tian Chen explained.

After hearing Ancestor Tian Chen’s explanation, Jian Wushuang had a better idea of the soul attack secret skill.

The secret skill could target multiple people and had incredible power.

This soul attack secret skill was very suitable for Jian Wushuang.
