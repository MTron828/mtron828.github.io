Chapter 1112: Second Battle!

“Bang!”

The golden-armored man swung the massive hammers with his four arms. The hammers promptly turned into four golden lights. The lights converged and formed a straight line that aimed at Jian Wushuang one after another. Each of the Flowing Lights carried a strong momentum, making them seem impossible to block.

“You almost outdid me in terms of offensive power the last time but it might not be the same this time.”

Jian Wushuang stared emotionlessly at the golden lights that were flying toward him. His Blood Mountain Sword began to react.

Ancient God Power poured into the sword, causing it to explode with a mighty power. Jian Wushuang then swiftly thrust it at the man.

Just then, the golden thunderbolt on the Level Three of Divine Yin Thunder poured into his sword.

“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!”

Following the noise of collisions, Jian Wushuang and the man almost flew backward at the same time.

The man was shocked.?“To think that he managed to rival me in a direct collision!”

“Once again!” Jian Wushuang was eager to fight again. He charged at the man as soon as he regained firm footing.

“Humph! I’m not afraid of you!” the man cried. His pupils appeared to be turning red as he threw himself at Jian Wushuang as well.

They fought against each other again. Jian Wushuang demonstrated his swordsmanship while the man used his giant hammer.

They spared no effort to exercise their powers.

“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!”

Horrifying explosions resounded one after another, sending shockwaves through the air. The world began to shake, impacting the endless mountains. Some mountains were split into several parts, while others were reduced to dust.

“Haha! How exciting!”

Jian Wushuang growled, looking incredibly excited.

On the other hand, the man became more frightened as the battle progressed.

“How is this possible? When we fought 10 years ago, we were equal in speed but he was much weaker than I was. But now… How did he become strong enough to rival me in just a short time?” the man murmured.

Most of their battle had revolved around the confrontations between their power and might, with minimal displays of killing moves. Even so, he had collided with Jian Wushuang so many times. How was it that he still did not manage to gain the upper hand in their battle?

“It’s only been a short 10 years! It’s not unlike he has become a Dao Master, so how did he achieve such great progress?”?The man was trembling with fear deep inside.

Once one arrived at the Celestial Master level, every improvement in strength was the result of an arduous process. He was one such example, for he had barely improved even after tens of thousands of years.

However, Jian Wushuang’s offensive power had been greatly enhanced in just 10 years.

To make things worse, Jian Wushuang was a mere Eternal Realm expert.

“What a monster.”?Though the man looked at Jian Wushuang coldly, he was already making plans to escape.

He abruptly waved his four arms and produced an amazing power, strong enough to throw Jian Wushuang backward. He then took the opportunity to retreat and run. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“He ran?”

Jian Wushuang stood in place, watching the golden-armored man leave.

He had yet to use all of his tricks. For example, he had not completely exercised his speed. However, he knew that he would not be able to kill the man even if he tried his best.

“In terms of strength, the man has reached the top level among all advanced Celestial Masters. However, I’ve reached the Level Three of Divine Yin Thunder, and therefore am stronger in overall strength. Therefore, I can defeat many advanced Celestial Masters.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly to himself.

He never once thought of fighting the golden-armored man to death.

He merely wanted a real battle with the man to get an idea of his own strength.

He had fought against a burly man with purple hair, an advanced Holy Master with weak battle strength, but that man escaped soon after the battle began. That left him unsatisfied.

However, he was very happy with this battle.

“Let’s keep going!”

Jian Wushuang continued to fly around the mountains in search of Life Elixirs.

“Whoosh!”

A golden Flowing Light flitted across the air before stopping on the top of a mountain. It was the man who fought Jian Wushuang earlier.

That man was Qu Yang, a famed Celestial Master of the Jin Kingdom.

Out of the many advanced Celestial Masters in the kingdom, he was strong enough to place fifth. He was absolutely one of the advanced Celestial Masters in terms of strength.

However, his current expression was grave. “Jian Wushuang… How did his strength increase so sharply in such a short time?”

“If he continues improving at such a rate, won’t he be the next Sunrise Sword Emperor?”

“We must keep a close eye on Jian Wushuang in the future!”

Therefore, Qu Yang immediately reported this to the high-level experts of the Jin Kingdom.

“I met a peerless genius from the Green Fire Palace called Jian Wushuang. He seems like a mere Eternal Realm expert but he’s talented indeed. Perhaps he’s using some kind of Secret Skill to hide his aura. When I met him last time, he used all sorts of skills to fight me but barely escaped with his life intact. Back then, his offensive power was much weaker than mine!”

“10 years later, when I meet him again today, his offensive power is on par with mine. He has greatly improved his strength.”

“We must kill someone this talented as soon as possible. Otherwise, he might turn out to be a formidable force of the Green Fire Palace.”

The high-level experts of the Jin Kingdom soon received the news.

Concerned as they were, they immediately ordered their experts hiding in the Green Fire World to investigate Jian Wushuang.

However, those experts faced a lot of limitations in the Green Fire World. Some of them might have information on Jian Wushuang but they had few opportunities to deliver their messages as they could not show up in public.

Therefore, those high-level experts could not get details of Jian Wushuang so soon.

Still, they sent messages to the other experts on the battlefield, requesting them to look out for a Sword Principle expert in the Eternal Realm and kill him if a chance presented itself.
