Chapter 520: Earth Core Palace Token

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Shock!

The people on the street were stupefied and stared at Jian Wushuang.

They had tried to predict Jian Wushuang’s reaction and could understand both his decision and arguments.

Because these two reactions were basic human instincts.

However, they didn’t expect that Jian Wushuang would say things like that.

Who was Emperor Golden Snake? Never heard of him?

Emperor Golden Snake, one of the 108 Divine Emperors, was very famous in the human race. It was unbelievable that Jian Wushuang had never heard of him.

His reaction completely offended Emperor Golden Snake.

But in fact, Jian Wushuang had indeed not heard of Emperor Golden Snake.

He wasn’t from the Monster Continent and had arrived here only a few days ago. It was normal that he did not know of Emperor Golden Snake.

“Good, great.”

Jin Ling was apoplectic with fury. He grinned at Jian Wushuang, stared at him and said, “Jian Wushuang, I will remember you. The world is small and I will definitely meet you one day!”

He turned away and then left with a snort.

After witnessing this, the bystanders stared at Jian Wushuang for a while and then left.

“Goodness, he said he had never heard of Emperor Golden Snake. This Divine General really has guts.”

“Yes, he does. However, he has really upset Emperor Golden Snake.”

“I heard that Emperor Golden Snake is vengeful. I’m afraid this Divine General is already in trouble.”

People sighed, even the sergeants in the guard army looked at Jian Wushuang with pity. After that, they all left.

“Well, you are really in trouble now.”

Qing Huo frowned and then looked at Jian Wushuang, “My friend, you just arrived in the Monster Continent so you haven’t heard of the Emperor Golden Snake yet. But I know he is monstrous even among the 108 Divine Emperors.”

“He is called Emperor Golden Snake because he is as malevolent as a viper. Besides, he is known as the one who always takes revenge for offenses.”

“All the people in the Monster-exterminating League know that whoever offends Emperor Golden Snake, would definitely suffer a lot.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t really care.

Qing Huo was shocked.

He explained it so seriously but Jian Wushuang didn’t seem to care about it.

However, he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang wasn’t worried about Emperor Golden Snake at all.

He has been cultivating till now and had already upset numerous people. Thousands of people even wanted to kill him, but he was still alive and well.

Like in Divine Land, he became the enemy of the world and his opponents were all at the Three Ancestors Level. He was able to handle them, not to mention?Emperor Golden Snake who had just reached the Cloud Realm.

“My current strength might not be able to confront a Divine Emperor. However, it is also not easy for him to kill me if I try my best to defend.”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

He was confident with his current strength.

“OK, forget about Emperor Golden Snake. Let’s talk about Emperor Fengxiao,” Qing Huo looked at him again, “Jin Ling just mentioned that you received a Jade Slip as a gift from the Emperor Fengxiao, what happened to it?”

“I don’t really know,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “While I was performing the assessment of Divine Generals, Emperor Fengxiao was nearby. When I finished, someone gave me a Jade Slip and said it was a gift from the Emperor Fengxiao who thought I did a good job in the assessment.”

“Oh, really?” Qing Huo was surprised and said, “I would like to have a look at that Jade Slip.”

Without hesitating, Jian Wushuang showed him the golden Jade Slip.

“This is...” Qing Huo was shocked when he saw it.

“Qing Huo, do you know this Jade Slip?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course. This is the Earth Core Palace token. Besides, it is a golden one which means that whoever has it can enter the Fourth Level of the Earth Core Palace. The number in this token represents the number of days that the holder can stay in the palace.” Qing Huo stared at the number which showed ‘ten’.

“Ten days, I can stay in the Fourth Level of the Earth Core Palace for ten days.”

“Psst...”

Qing Huo could not help feeling very envious or even a bit jealous. He looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “My friend, now I know why Jin Ling has been trying so hard to get this Jade Slip.”

“Is this Jade Slip very precious?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Precious? More than that!” Qing Huo answered, “My friend, I should say this token can easily make numerous Divine Generals in the Monster-exterminating League go crazy. Not to mention ten days, even one day, many Divine Generals would fight to the death for it.”

“This Jade Slip is very precious not only for the Divine Generals, but also for Divine Emperors. Like Jin Ling’s father who is called Emperor Golden Snake, although he is one of 108 Divine Emperors, it would take him about ten years to get one Jade Slip.”

“It takes about ten years for Emperor Golden Snake to get one Jade Slip?” Jian Wushuang was shocked and asked, “Does it mean that this Jade Slip is also very important for the Emperor Fengxiao?”

“Of course.”

Qing Huo nodded and said, “Although the Emperor Fengxiao is a superior emperor and his strength is much stronger than the Emperor Golden Snake’s, it’s still not that easy for him to get one Jade Slip. To my great surprise, he gave it to you. It is like a meat pie falling from the sky!”

Jian Wushuang looked solemn.

He was also confused why Emperor Fengxiao gave such a precious thing to him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t know that his Sword Skill had helped Emperor Fengxiao comprehend a sword movement which had bothered him for a long time. So compared to the Jade Slip, this sword movement was much more important. In Emperor Fengxiao’s mind, even if he could get another three or four Jade Slips, he might still be unable to comprehend the sword movement.

That was why the Emperor Fengxiao gave the Jade Slip to Jian Wushuang as a gift since he was happy to understand the sword movement.

“Qing Huo, just now you mentioned that the Jade Slip was related to the Earth Core Palace, so what is that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Earth Core Palace is the biggest opportunity in the Holy Place. No point for you to ask more details because we are going to the Holy Place now, and later you can figure it out for yourself. You will realize the value of this Jade Slip,” Qing Huo answered.

“Great, then let’s go to the Holy Place.” Jian Wushuang smiled with high expectations.
