Chapter 5264 - 5264: This Is a Rebellion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This was something they had never considered before. The Four Great Temples were the core subordinates of the Qishen Temple, much like those top-ranking individuals with A-rank; most of them were the essential existence within these halls.

Now that they were being revived, others should also be revived. That guy was removing these people from the Four Great Temples and recruiting them all into the Elder Palace‚Ä¶

Was he breaking up the once-core layer?

The purity of True Spirit‚Äôs intentions was questionable.

They were never the core figures to begin with, but now, by being recruited into the Elder Palace, they had become the core. It was like aligning themselves with the controllers of the Qishen Temple.

At the same time, on the Bloodthirst Continent, the true core members of the Four Great Temples, over a thousand True Elders, who used to enjoy welcoming drinks in the Azure Dragon Temple and indulging in the unique delicacies of the Bloodthirst Continent, were suddenly driven out by Long Yi. He banished them into the void.

The situation with the Black Tortoise Temple was relatively stable. Xuanwu Yi‚Äôs temperament had always been calm. Although he showed no movement on the surface, he had secretly mobilized an army of puppets, firmly controlling the third major world.

Even he felt that True Spirit was about to rebel.

Fortunately, he didn‚Äôt tell True Spirit everything.

Among the Four Great Temples, only his Black Tortoise Temple had the ability to construct puppets, and there was a secret behind this. Thankfully, he hadn‚Äôt revealed everything.

As for the White Tiger Temple, they were fighting everywhere, clearing the Four Great Secret Realms. True Spirit had once come to help them clean up, awakening so many elders at once, which deeply moved the people of the White Tiger Temple.

They thought True Spirit was quite reasonable. However, he then pulled off something inhuman.

Luckily, there were no such elders in his hall. Even if they were kept, their strength was too weak to be of any use.

‚ÄúTraitor!‚Äù Zhu Yi glared down at the crowd, suppressing her impulse to act, her face darkening.

This glare sent shivers down everyone‚Äôs spine!

Zhu Yi was the head of the Vermilion Bird Temple. When the Qishen Temple forged the Four Great Leaders, a lot of effort was put into her. Her power was not limited to being a tier 6 Emperor.

Such a powerful individual, let alone the current them, even at their peak, could be easily overpowered.

Both sides stood in a standoff. Qiuhuangs small eyes were as sharp as green beans.

The sudden announcement caught him off guard, causing him to spit out the wine he had just sipped.

‚ÄúHmph!‚Äù Zhu Yi snorted coldly and disappeared from the main hall in a flash.

What was she up to, consulting True Spirit? Splitting the family? The authority of True Spirit was already paramount, and now it seemed they intended to completely dismantle the once-central four temples and rebuild the Qishen Temple from scratch.

This news sent shockwaves throughout the Qishen Temple!

However, it had no effect on the brutality unfolding on the Original Planet!

Thousands of Devouring Demons stood in formation, ready for battle. The formation was set, and outside the city, there was only Jian Wushuang. On the city walls, tens of thousands of eyes watched everything unfold.

Today‚Äôs atmosphere was unusually tense; even the silent sky bore a hint of gloom.

Jian Wushuang stood tall in the air, without a sword in his hands.

At this moment, he hadn‚Äôt employed any treasures; instead, his Thought power was continuously condensing, filling the space for millions of miles

around him.

Every strand of his Thought power was akin to a longsword, and billions of strands of Thought power were like billions of longswords.

‚ÄúMy heart is the only thing that‚Äôs real!‚Äù Jian Wushuang secretly marveled.

The fifth level of Heart power was indeed not so simple!

Currently, his Heart power, Thought power, and Sword Dao were all bottlenecked, making him extremely anxious. The fusion of these three was the only path, and the only remaining point was Sword Dao.

Although Sword Dao seemed to encompass everything, in reality, his Sword Dao had contracted to its utmost limit, akin to a person‚Äôs pupils. Breaking through seemed incredibly difficult.

Thousands of Devouring Demons rushed out in unison from the black mist. After this army surged out, the black mist dissipated considerably. It appeared that most of the Devouring Demons had already emerged, leaving behind only those at the 4-Star and even 5-Star levels.

Of course, there were also 6-Star, and even ‚ÄòI-Star existences.

‚ÄúTranscendent Immortal!‚Äù Jian Wushuang roared in anger.

Before the Devouring Demon could attack, 18 longswords instantly condensed around him!

The 18 longswords turned into rainbow streaks piercing through heaven and earth!

The Transcendent Immortal Formation unleashed by the Ultimate Sword Dao, unparalleled throughout antiquity, pierced through everything.

The flowing light formed by the longswords kept dividing, from 18 to 36, 72, all the way to the final 3,600 swords.

Currently, Jian Wushuang was using his strongest Transcendent Immortal Formation, the 18 Phantom Swords.

However, dealing with these 3-Star Devouring Demons, the most potent Transcendent Immortal Formation seemed somewhat overkill, and it was extremely strenuous.

It would be better to divide and expand it, to maximize the Transcendent Immortal Formation. Although the overall power would weaken, it would be the most effective against these Devouring Demons.

3,600 phantom swords, covering the sky and earth, formed a massive sword formation.

Swish! Swish! Swish!!!

The sword formation first intersected, shattering tens of thousands of Devouring Demons. They stood upright one after another, forming a hexagram from above.

‚ÄúThis formation, Transcendent Immortal. Today, we eradicate the demons!‚Äù Jian Wushuang multiplied into three thousand, stepping into the formation!

Presiding over the top like a monarch, he activated the Transcendent Immortal Formation!

Boom!

3,600 swords fell into the midst of the Devouring Demon Army, transforming into a massive star sword atlas.

The atlas spun ceaselessly, emanating a power that caused the Devouring Demon above to fall one by one.

This was the Immortal Trapping Trial within the Transcendent Immortal Formation!

Once the millions of Devouring Demons entered the array, their feet involuntarily landed on the array, and their entire bodies began to sink continuously.

For a moment, the foremost two rows of Devouring Demons, a total of 400,000, were all caught in the array and ruthlessly annihilated!

This made the people on the city wall involuntarily gasp in shock.

‚ÄúHe still has hidden cards!‚Äù Si Tian couldn‚Äôt help but exclaim.

MO Long stood on the city wall, leading the people behind him.

In his eyes, there was excitement and fear. He couldn‚Äôt forget the Illusory Sword Technique displayed by Jian Wushuang, which had once driven him into a desperate situation.

Back then, Jian Wushuangs strength was comparable to his. Now, in just three years, the gap in strength had become so vast.

If he were among the millions of Devouring Demons, he wouldn‚Äôt even have a chance to turn the tables. He would be besieged and killed. Yet, Jian Wushuang could stand alone against millions.

Such terrifying combat power, demonstrating such immense strength, was something they couldn‚Äôt possibly contend with.

They could see that the strength of the sword formation posed the greatest threat to the extreme-level Grand Yan Immortal. However, to maintain such a massive sword formation and also annihilate 3-Star Devouring Demons, no one among them could accomplish it.

The Yan power required by this grand array every moment was astronomical.Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

Jian Wushuang calculated that it would consume the Yan power stored by a

Dao Lord in a single breath. They couldn‚Äôt perceive it, but they could sense it.

Puff!

Jian Wushuang maintained it for only a few breaths, and his own Yan power rapidly declined. His limit was the time it took for an incense stick to burn. If he reached that point, he would be finished.

‚ÄúPrepare to face the enemy!‚Äù Jian Wushuang reminded, then retracted the grand array. The 3,600 swords instantly merged, forming 960 swords.

In just this short amount of time, he had slain nearly two million Devouring Demons with the Transcendent Immortal Formation. Now, after shrinking it by half, he could still withstand four million, but the remaining four million couldn‚Äôt be held off..
