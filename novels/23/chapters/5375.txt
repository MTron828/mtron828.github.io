Chapter 5374: Wuliang Buddhas Strength

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Wuliang!

His hands joined together, eyes wide with anger!

Hum!

With just one glance, the incoming giant palm began to falter.

The mysterious Emperors gaze was astonished, then he strengthened his divine power once again, launching a full-force attack.

In an instant, tens of thousands of palms were swung.

But in the next moment, the figure of the Wuliang Buddha seemed to vanish, only to reappear, engulfing the entire celestial world in his boundless form.

Countless Wuliang Buddhas slowly raised a finger, and with a gentle touch, a burst of brilliance shot out.

Piercing through all those giant palms, it even penetrated the body of the mysterious Emperor.

The finger was ordinary, nothing spectacular.

Just the power of a tier 5 peak, but the technique belonged to a tier 4 Emperor!bender

If this didnt prove anything, the technique of spatial transformation was undoubtedly at the tier 5 peak level, a skill many tier 5 Emperors couldnt execute.

The body of the mysterious Emperor was pierced, his divine body destroyed, and even his origin source shook, clearly suppressed.Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

With just one move, his divine body was injured. In a real battle, he probably wouldnt withstand a few more moves. The fact that the opponent possessed peak-tier strength was undeniable.

Hes actually injured! A tier 6 Emperor with a higher level of insight immediately noticed the damage to the mysterious Emperors divine body and the trembling suppression of his origin source.

The mysterious Emperor harbored some unwillingness in his heart. Even if it turned out to be true, challenging across tiers shouldnt be so exaggerated!

Could it be that those inheritors specifically choose peak Emperors to challenge?

His speculation was correct. Inheritors did indeed challenge those peak Emperors, and they specifically targeted opponents who were a whole level stronger than themselves.

The mysterious Emperors eyes showed fear, hastily saying, Inheritors are indeed extraordinary. Lets leave it at that!

Hmph!t

Ever since the Boundless Buddha entered the Qishen Temple, especially after traversing the Demon Sound Mountain, a tremendous change had occurred.

Previously suppressed by Tongtian, he now erupted again. Although he didnt catch up to Tongtian, there was hope. His actions were no longer as hesitant as before.

Countless figures gathered, surrounding the mysterious Emperor, and then they struck.

A massive Buddha figure condensed, containing a power that terrified the mysterious Emperor!

You! The mysterious Emperor didnt expect these inheritors to be so vengeful.

Didnt he just question a few things? There was no need to be so ruthless!

Rumble!

Ill return the favor with a palm, let you see what true Dao is! Wuliang Buddha struck, radiating Buddha light that filled the sky, with a power that shook the heavens.

This statement reminded Jian Wushuang of the phrase, I understand the heavens better than you do!

The transformation of the Wuliang Buddha caused a subtle change in Hu Qings expression!

The former Buddha Lord, with his supreme radiance, had now turned into what he appeared to be at present.

It was truly unclear whether the appearance of the Qishen Temple was a blessing or a curse.

He felt a sense of nostalgia for the time spent with several masters, the thoughts of venturing into the Great Desolate Wilderness to guide sentient beings still lingered, but the people from those days were either dead or changed beyond recognition.

As a palm descended, the mysterious Emperors divine body disintegrated, leaving only the precarious origin source to support it, on the brink of collapse.

If it werent for that tier 6 Emperor intervening, Wuliang Buddha would have truly slain this mysterious Emperor.

Swish!

Without waiting for Nalan Ci to speak, he directly sealed off the cave.

Now, any objections? Wuliang Buddha said, sweeping a glance at the crowd, then looking up at those tier 5 individuals.

Inheritor!

With a high status related to the temple, if a tier 6 Emperor were to take action, it would undoubtedly bring disaster.

There had been incidents of heirs being abducted in the heavenly realm before.

In the end, the newly rising power, the Elder Palace took action, suppressing all Emperors involved in the matter, wiping out the Heavenly Demon Sect.

The Sword Dao Holy Land, the Shangqing Palace, was disbanded, and the Shangqing Patriarch was sent to guard the Elder Palace, while all the Emperors under the door were sent to the far north for mining!

This incident was still vivid in memory. Anyone who dared to touch this sensitive matter, despite being in the earthly realm where the influence of the temple was moderate, should not forget the recent events in the Forest of Eternal Secrets.

Seeing no one responding, Wuliang Buddha flicked his sleeve, not even sparing a glance at Nalan Ci, and left alone.

He, with such arrogance, would never have willingly taken the position of Royal Teacher in Great Xia if it werent for the task given by the Grave God

Mountain.

That map was merely a bargaining chip for today!

He assisted Great Xia in securing the rejected land for this auction, and Great Xia went to war against the MO Luo Nation under the guise of business.

Never underestimate the value this auction brings to Great Xia.

Midway through the auction, Xia Niang Yuxing successfully persuaded several tier 5 Emperors, offering over a trillion godstones. These tier 5 Emperors would play a crucial role when Great Xia and MO Luo went to war.

If the Great Xia was unstoppable, they would join in, dealing a collective blow to the enemy.

If Great Xia and MO Luo were deadlocked, they would guard the four major cities on the border for a thousand years, avoiding the need for a desperate battle.

For these tier 5 Emperors, this deal was too easy.

Not much danger, just 50 billion godstones earned over a thousand years.

Xia Mang Yuxings method was similar to Jian Wushuangs, only the former was much wealthier.

Trillions of godstones were nothing; the mobilization and war efforts of millions of cultivators were the real significant expenses.

Weakening those families, whether in victory or defeat, the Great Xia royal family wouldnt lose.

If they won, he would have merit; if they lost, the borders several major cities wouldnt be lost either, with over 20 tier 5 Emperor forces, suppressing for a thousand years would be easy.

After a millennium, he still had other means.

Emperors had countless methods; they were extraordinary individuals.

When Wuliang Buddha returned to his room and restored his appearance, Xia Mang Yuxing quickly stood up, Brother Wuliang, your strength has improved again. The inheritors are indeed extraordinary.

This statement was not a compliment; it was a fact.

The first time he met Wuliang Buddha, he could still contend with him, but now, he probably couldnt.

Xia Mang Yuxings strength was average, not much stronger than that mysterious Emperor.

With the proof of the inheritor, the credibility of this map increased.

But the number of people who needed it was scarce.

However, the Heavenly Court, which had already anticipated this, secretly informed many tier 6 Emperors. They all arrived this time with their strengths hidden, making it impossible for outsiders to detect.

In the VIP room above, there were at least 10 tier 6 old monsters. Now, they spoke together, and the price began to soar.

Their bidding was no longer in the billions but in the trillions.

The price quickly rose to a trillion.

Xia Mang Yuxing watched all this with some doubt. If this map was a treasure, why didnt the patriarch buy it privately in the first place?

His status was extraordinary, and he knew a lot about the Gods Tomb. Only tier 6 Emperors could navigate inside, and although it had the richest resources, the time and space inside were chaotic.

Tier 6 Emperors would get lost easily, and once inside, they either died at the hands of Special Life Forms or were sealed by those guarding spirits..
