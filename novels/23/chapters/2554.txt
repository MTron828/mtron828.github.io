“I heard that Mr. Jian Yi sought trouble from quite a few clans and forced them to provide him with a lot of Primordial Stones.”

“I’ve heard about that too. Moreover, I heard his tactics aren’t so honorable.”

“Hmph! The world respects ability above all else. What’s this honorable nonsense?”

The void was filled with discussions with some even heard by Jian Wushuang, but he ignored them.

At that moment, his eyes were focused on the center of the Combat Ring toward the motionless green-clad middle-aged man standing with a battle blade on his back with his cold expression.

“Is he the Earth Ultimate God who challenged the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?” Jian Wushuang squinted slightly.

Although there was a certain distance on top of a restrictive shield layer between them, Jian Wushuang could still feel an incredible amount of pressure from the green-clad middle-aged man.

His pressure was many times stronger than the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s who had opened up a Sword World. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“So this is an Earth Ultimate God?”

Jian Wushuang started looking forward to the battle.

The various clans and countless cultivators were all quietly waiting.

They did not wait long as... Boom! A huge wave of divine power suddenly swept open.

A figure gradually emerging from the distant void.

It was a big man who was clad in beast skin. His skin was dark while his face and arms were hairy, just like a brown bear.

A violent aura was covering every inch of his being.

His far above Peak Ultimate God’s immense divine power aura had already recklessly pressed forward before his physical body’s arrival.

The divine power aura pressed against the entire Combat Ring including the countless audiences around it. Every cultivator who was below the Ultimate God Realm turned pale and trembling under the repression. Some of them could not even stand still and immediately crouched or knelt.

Among those Ultimate Gods, Primary-Level Ultimate Gods were trembling while High-Level Ultimate Gods held on better with only their faces turned slightly pale. Only Peak Ultimate Gods could more or less withstand the divine power aura’s repression, but even they showed a solemn expression.

“Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord!”

“It’s His Excellency the Territorial Lord. He’s here!”

“So he is the undisputed first-ranked expert of the Northern Darkstar Territory!”

Countless eyes looked on with utmost respect and fear at the bear-like man who slowly walked over.

Jian Wushuang squinted when he stared at him. The latter’s aura of chaos and violence even made him slightly fearful.

As for Xiao Tiexin who was next to Jian Wushuang, her body began to tremble when she saw the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord’s appearance.

She did not tremble because of his divine power aura but from her immense hatred!

An absolute hatred.

“Tiexin.” Jian Wushuang slightly gazed at Xiao Tiexin.

Xiao Tiexin paused and forced herself to immediately calm down.

They were after all right there under the Territorial Lord’s nose not to mention the many surrounding people and experts. Xiao Tiexin’s hatred would be easily detected if she was being too obvious.

At that moment, the bear-like man had appeared standing right in front of the green-clad middle-aged man in the Combat Ring.

The green-clad man opened his eyes as killing intent began to beam in his eyes and swept into the heavens.

“San Shouwang, I finally met you again!!!” The green-clad man’s voice was ice-cold.

“San Shouwang?” The countless audiences around were stunned.

Some who knew said, “The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is only his title and anyone who becomes the future Territorial Lord will also be addressed as such. However, San Shouwang is the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord’s real name.”

“I heard our Territorial Lord used to be a thief, hence his extremely wild personality and cruel tactics. I wonder if it’s true.”

“Looks like this green-clad gentleman has some beef with His Excellency.”

Everyone began to discuss.

In the center of the Combat Ring, the bear-like Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord who was also known as San Shouwang looked surprisingly at the green-clad middle-aged man. “Looks like we do share a history if you know my real name. Who are you?”

The green-clad man frostily said, “I’m Pei Qi!”

“Pei Qi?” San Shouwang’s expression twitched before immediately shook his head. “Never heard of you.”

“Of course, but you surely remembered the Pei Clan?” Pei Qi shouted.

“The Pei Clan?” San Shouwang immediately understood. “You’re from the Pei Clan?”

“Pei Clan?”

Many clans around the ring immediately began to exclaim.

“So he is from the Pei Clan. No wonder he has such deep hatred against the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.” Situ Yuan nodded to himself.

“Clan Leader Situ, what’s the deal with the Pei Clan?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Situ Yuan explained, “You see. The Pei Clan used to be a very powerful mid-tier clan in the Northern Darkstar Continent in terms of capabilities and foundation. They were one of the most powerful clans among the continent’s many mid-tier clans and were not too far behind when compared to top-tier clans like us. However, Forty thousand years ago the Pei Clan unintentionally crossed the Territorial Lord. The furious Territorial Lord slaughtered the entire Pei Clan, and only a few escaped the killing among a large number of clansmen while the rest were killed.

“The Territorial Lord issued an order to track them down and kill the ones who escaped. The Official Army mobilized its personnel in grandeur to search of the remaining Pei clansmen and killed them. The Pei Clan was finally considered destroyed with their end comparable to the Xiao Clan. Unexpectedly, there’s someone from the Pei Clan who survived the killings, made a breakthrough to become an Earth Ultimate God, and came back to seek revenge.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang finally understood.

“San Shouwang!”

Pei Qi’s hateful voice resonated between Heaven and Earth. “You slaughtered the Pei Clan, dispatched the Official Army to track and kill all remaining Pei clansmen forty thousand years ago. I was able to survive that pursuit by sheer luck and went through hell to stay alive. For forty thousand years, there was never a moment I’ve ever forgotten these deep grudges!

“I’ve finally stepped into the Earth Ultimate God Realm and possess the ability to challenge you now!

“Today, I’ll avenge the whole Pei Clan! Only one of us will live in this fight!!!”

Pei Qi’s roar could shake the Heavens.

Anybody could feel the boundless hatred and killing intent from his words.

They could also understand how he felt.

It was the grudge of his entire clan’s annihilation after all.

“Haha, one of us will live? Sounds grand but a pity though. Do you think you have such capabilities?” San Shouwang’s beast-like eyes stared at Pei Qi while his face beamed with a mysterious grin.
