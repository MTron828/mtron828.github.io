Chapter 2132 Setting Ou

“Now this, is true Third Stage fighting power,” Jian Wushuang smiled.Although he could go head-on against Demon King Chen Yu back at the Heaven Repairing Palace without fear of suppression thanks to his impressive survival abilities, in terms of true power, Jian Wushuang was still slightly lagging behind.

Now, Jian Wushuang was almost stronger than Demon King Chen Yu, and did not lose out at all when it came to secret skills. Jian Wushuang was confident he could take Demon King Chen Yu head-on once again, and perhaps even suppress him if he played the right cards.

This fighting power was of a true Third Stage Great Emperor.

“If I could make some further improvements to reach the Third Stage, or get the hang of some Rules of Order, my fighting powers would increase…” Jian Wushuang shook his head and laughed. “The time I’ve taken cultivating has simply been too short, I could not ask for more.” With the Immemorial Celestial Body’s second scroll successfully cultivated, Jian Wushuang was ready to take off.

This time, he took Jian Yi.

…

Thunderbolt Island, within the great hall, Emperor Bai sat at the top, while Abysmal Saint Master, Underworld God, King Chen Xing, Black Dragon Emperor, and Lei Yuan stood at the centre.

These six emperors rushed over upon Emperor Bai’s transmission.

Xiu!

A figure appeared within the hall, it was Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor!” “Ancient Emperor!” Abysmal Saint Master, King Chen Xing and the others all called out.

Jian Wushuang nodded and looked towards Emperor Bai.

When he refined the Immemorial Celestial Body’s second scroll, he made sure Emperor Bai knew, who then summoned the experts.

“Everyone, I have gathered you all here for a special assignment. I require your collected strength, are you all willing to join me?” Emperor Bai asked the six.

Abysmal Saint Master and others looked at each other and all nodded.

Seeing this, Emperor Bai continued. “The task is extraordinary, so Jian Wushuang will lead it personally. Throughout the mission, you must follow his orders, is that understood?” The six were taken aback but had no objections as it was Jian Wushuang leading them.

Needless to say, the three experts from the special tribes followed their leader, Jian Wushuang.

The three Sanctuary Alliance members had no objections either, even Emperor God Tian Ling.

Because, regardless of strength or status, no one could beat Jian Wushuang, so of course he should lead them.

Seeing the expressions of the six emperors, Jian Wushuang smiled, then solemnly said, “For special reasons, I cannot tell you the specific task content for the time being. There is another thing. I’ll need to put the six of you in an uncomfortable position. You all may be slightly aggrieved by it.”

“Aggrieved?” The six emperors were all surprised, but all were fine except the Abysmal Saint Master.

He had already guessed what Jian Wushuang had wanted to do because Jian Wushuang had said the same thing to him before entering the Imperial City back at the Three-Emperors World.

Sure enough, Jian Wushuang spoked. “The divine weapon I hold is a suppressive treasure. I will need to suppress all six of you within this divine weapon to facilitate movement, are you all willing?” The expressions of all six people changed, except the Abysmal Saint Master.

After all, being suppressed meant handing their lives over to another person.

“I’m okay with that,” Abysmal Saint Master was the first that spoke.

He had stayed in Jian Wushuang’s divine weapon for years previously at the Three-Emperors World. With that experience, he had no fear.

King Chen Xing came from the Ancient God Clan and had pledged allegiance to Jian Wushuang. Naturally, he did not hesitate too much and directly agreed.

“Haha, it’s only for a short period of time, it means nothing. Whatever the Ancient Emperor commands, I will never refuse,” the Black Dragon Emperor smiled.

Jian Wushuang had saved her life and clan in the past.

She had already developed feelings for Jian Wushuang long before the request; she would never reject Jian Wushuang’s request to stay within the divine weapon.

Three of the six had agreed. Underworld God and Lei Yuan hesitated for a while but eventually agreed.

One person was left, and it was Emperor God Tian Ling.

“Emperor God Tian Ling, no, Great Emperor Tian Ling,” Emperor Bai’s voice resonated. “I know what your concerns are. Rest assured, Jian Wushuang will not take his personal revenge against you. Abysmal Saint Master was in the same situation as you previously.” Emperor God Tian Ling flinched and took a glance at Abysmal Saint Master. Eventually, he agreed.

Like that, all six Great Emperors agreed.

“Since you all have agreed, please do not resist.” Jian Wushuang smiled, as his Blood Mountain Sword turned into a huge mountain, and suppressed the six Great Emperors.

If it had been under other circumstances, it would not have been easy these six Great Emperors. It was much easier to do it when they did not resist.

Soon all six of them were suppressed within Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword.

For Jian Yi, he was long within the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Jian Wushuang, take care and do not be reckless. This is a life-and-death situation for the Eternal Chaotic World,” Emperor Bai instructed.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded and made his way.

Within the boundless dark Void, the Dark Millstone the size of a few kingdoms floated there quietly. It had long stopped moving.

Within the Dark Millstone, lie the Three Emperors World.

Jian Wushuang had arrived at the edge of the Dark Millstone.

Before arriving at the Dark Millstone, Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh. “The Supreme Emperor Stone had not been destroyed the previous time I was here. There was such a huge formation then. The Sanctuary Alliance took great measures to send my team of four in the Three Emperors World. But now… the temporary seals around the Dark Millstone do not stop me from entering without a trace.”

They encountered several seals along the way, but Jian Wushuang had managed to make his way around it. Soon, he was within Three Emperors World territory.
