Chapter 2105 Cultivation

‚ÄúWant to Cultivate Our Holy Object? Dream on!‚Äù Ba Su Sneered. ‚ÄúThat Holy Object Has Been in Our Possession for So Many Years, Yet I Have Only Managed to Realise the Fourth Skill After All This Time. Even I Myself Am So Far Away From Completing All Nine Skills, How is Jian Wushuang Going to Catch Up?‚Äù

‚ÄúHngh, Let Him Cultivate if He Wishes. The Battle Will Break Out Within This Millennium Anyway, Let Him Waste His Time on That Treasure,‚Äù the Eerie Elder Sneered Along.

‚Äúa Millennium? Haha, I‚Äôm Afraid He Won‚Äôt Even Reach the First Skill,‚Äù Ba Su Laughed.

They Were in No Rush.

In Their Eyes, Jian Wushuang Could Never Fully Master It Within a Thousand Years.

No Way.

Even Ba Su Thought That Jian Wushuang Would Need at Least a Thousand Years to Master the First Skill.

But in Reality... Jian Wushuang Had Only Used Two Weeks.

Naturally, Ba Su Did Not Know That at That Time.

Time Passed...

Within the Special Tribes Domain, Many Special Tribes Had Already Learnt About the Sky Swallowing Clan Colluding With the Archleon Palace, and Its Attempts to Erase the Black Dragon Clan.

While Shocked, the Clans Began to Hate the Archelon Palace and Three Emperors World Even More, and Saw Working Together With the Sanctuary Alliance as a Definite Must, and Made the Necessary Preparations.

Within a Short Span of Time, Almost All the Experts From Various Clans Had Finished Their Preparations.

Now They Had to Wait for Jian Wushuang to Surface.

By This Time, Jian Wushuang Had Been in the Dungeon for Eighteen Years. Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates

Eighteen Years to a Normal Cultivator Was Nothing More Than a Blink of an Eye. For Jian Wushuang, These Eighteen Years Have Been Fully Dedicated to the Realisation of the Soul Swallowing Pearl‚Äôs Nine Skills. He Had Mastered His First, Then His Second, Then His Third... All Without Resistance.

The Skills Were Supposed to Be Increasingly Hard to Master, but Jian Wushuang Had Found the Opposite. The Nine Skills Were All Similar, Combined to Form a Complete Secret Skill, Therefore After Jian Wushuang Had Realised the First Few, Mastering the Rest Had Been No Big Deal.

After Eighteen Years, Jian Wushuang Had Finally Mastered All Nine Skills.

And With That, a Complete Activation Skill.

‚ÄúNow for the Cultivation.‚Äù

With a Tinge of Excitement, He Began to Cultivate the Soul Swallowing Pearl.

With the Complete Activation Skills by His Side, the Cultivation Was Single. Within Moments the Pearl ‚Äì Surrounded by Boundless Aura ‚Äì Gradually Floated Towards Jian Wushuang, and Entered His Body.

As the Pearl Was Being Completely Cultivated, Hong Long Long~~~~ a Boundless Soul Power Instantly Rose From the Pearl, and Landed Straight in His Substantive Soul.

The Soul Power That Rose Was Powerful Beyond Jian Wushuang‚Äôs Imagination.

The Soul Power, So Pure.

As He Absorbed It, Jian Wushuang Could Feel His Soul Power Increasing at Terrifying Speeds.

‚ÄúThis... This...‚Äù Jian Wushuang Was Completely Shocked.

The Speed Was Simply Too Astonishing.

The Last Time His Soul Power Had Increased by So Much Was When He Had Made It Through the Seventh Step of Inverse Cultivation Onto the Second Stage, but There Was Still a Long Way to Go to Reach Pinnacle Emperor God Levels.

His Soul Power Levels Were a Weakness in His Opinion, in Comparison to His Overall Fighting Power.

Thankfully His Soul Was Strong Enough to Defend Against Average Soul Attacks, With the Help of Defensive Treasures Like the Five Gem Armour.

But Now, as the Billowing Soul Power From the Soul Swallowing Pearl Was Being Absorbed, His Substantive Soul Increased Exponentially, Reaching Pinnacle Emperor God Levels in Moments, and It Did Not Stop There.

Before Long, His Substantive Soul Accumulated to a Certain Level, and Started Reaching Great Emperor Levels.

There Was Little Resistance, as His Soul Then Started to Change Substantively, Finally Reaching Average Great Emperor Levels.

Yet, It Did Not Stop There. His Soul Power Continued to Increase.

The Size of His Substantive Soul Was Also Increasing Exponentially.

After a While, Not Until the Pure Soul Power From the Pearl Had Been Fully Cultivated and Absorbed Into His Substantive Soul, the Soul Quietened Down.

Jian Wushuang Remained Seated, but He Could Feel the Change in His Substantive Soul. He Could Feel That Strong Soul Power.

‚ÄúThis Soul Power... Pinnacle First Stage Great Emperor Levels!‚Äù

Jian Wushuang Clenched His Fist, Eyes Glimmering With Joy, Causing Waves in His Heart.

From a Normal Emperor God, He Had Jumped to First Stage Great Emperor Levels in Moments?

In Such a Short Period of Time, His Soul Had Grown So Much Stronger.

‚ÄúIncredible, This Pearl... Unbelievable,‚Äù Jian Wushuang Muttered. As He Cultivated the Soul Swallowing Pearl, He Understood Where Its Pure Soul Power Came From. It Had Been Accumulated by the Pearl Across a Long Period of Time.

A Powerful Treasure Without an Owner for an Extended Period of Time Could See Its Power Diminished.

Others Continued to Absorb Power From Its Surroundings Even Without an Owner, to Ensure It Did Not Diminish in Strength, but Instead Increased It.

The Pearl Belonged to the Latter Category. It Had Collected Tremendous Amounts of Power Across the Long Period of Time Without an Owner, and Had Converted the Power Into Pure Soul Power.

The Accumulation of Pure Soul Power Was Astonishing.

After Recognising Jian Wushuang as Its Owner, the Soul Power the Pearl Had Accumulated for Years Was Passed Directly to Him.

This Allowed His Soul to Strengthen at Such Amazing Speeds.
