Chapter 2861: Netherworld Fire Phoenix

——

Young Master Qu looked at Leng Rushuang in front of him. There was a burning desire in his heart, but on the surface, he was trying his best to maintain the appearance of an elegant Young Master.

Leng Rushuang glanced at Young Master Qu and nodded slightly.

Young Master Qu was immediately overjoyed and said, “This time, I heard that Miss Leng Er is going to be listed on the Dragon-phoenix list. I specially prepared a generous gift for you. I hope Miss Leng Er won’t mind.”

After saying that, Young Master Qu waved his hand.

In an instant, a silver-white stream of light streaked across the sky. The stream of light dissipated and a silver-white robe with a round collar that was clearly exquisitely carved appeared in front of the many experts.

At a glance, this robe was incomparably luxurious, dignified, and grand.

On the surface of the robe, there were two phoenixes embedded. These two phoenixes were lifelike and intertwined together as if they were competing for beauty.

It was beautiful, so beautiful that it made people intoxicated.

Most of the experts present could not help but exclaim in admiration the moment they saw the clothes.

Young Master Qu smiled and said, “The name of this clothes is heavenly phoenix silver snow garment. It is also a top-tier heavenly treasure with extremely great power. Moreover, these clothes can be said to be the most beautiful ones I have ever seen. As soon as I saw it, I immediately paid a great price to buy it. This time, I specially sent it over. Because in my opinion, in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, no one other than Miss Leng Er has the qualifications to own such a beautiful dress.”

Young Master Qu’s words were very pleasant to hear, and the surrounding people couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration. The gift Young Master Qu had prepared was indeed very special and unique.

This heavenly phoenix silver snow dress was indeed very beautiful.

As the saying goes, good wine goes with beauty.

Beautiful clothes could only be worn by real beauty.

No matter how talented Leng Rushuang was, she was still a woman. Moreover, she had only cultivated for a short period of time and did not have much experience. It was possible for her to be moved by some beautiful things.

But at this moment…

“Haha, Young Master Qu is really tactful.” A voice that clearly carried a hint of hostility sounded.

Everyone immediately looked towards the source of the voice and saw a handsome young man slowly walking forward.

Seeing this person, many people present revealed playful smiles.

This young man was the Young Master of the Star Point Pavilion, Chi Ming.

Chi Ming and Young Master Qu were both pursuers of the Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Moreover, they were the two most fanatical people. This matter had long been known by everyone.

Now that Young Master Qu had brought out the gift that he had meticulously prepared in front of everyone, Chi Ming naturally could not fall behind.

“Chi Ming, what do you mean by me being tactful?” Young Master Qu looked at Chi Ming with a slightly cold gaze.

“Isn’t it?” As far as I know, this heavenly phoenix silver snow garment was clearly refined by Young Master Qu after you spent ten years and hired more than ten refiners. I even heard that Young Master Qu even went to the Fire Cloud Castle to ask Lord Mo to personally take care of it. Unfortunately, Lord Mo rejected it. But even so, this garment still cost you a lot of energy and price.”

“Yet, you are telling Miss Leng Er that you just happened to come across this dress and bought it. isn’t this a euphemism?” Chi Ming sneered.

“Humph, so what if it’s like this? I just don’t want Miss Leng Er to have too many worries.” Young Master Qu snorted coldly, immediately after, he shouted in a low voice, “Chi Ming, don’t say such sarcastic words. I know that you must have prepared a gift. Take it out for everyone to see.”

“Haha, today is a great day for Miss Leng Ru to enter the Dragon-phoenix list. Naturally, I have prepared a gift as well. Miss Leng Er, please take a look.” Chi Ming directly pointed to the empty space beside him.

Everyone immediately looked in the direction Chi Ming pointed to and immediately saw a red dot that appeared at the end of that direction.

That red dot was still continuously magnifying. When it really appeared on this training ground, it had already turned into a huge object.

It was a phoenix that was completely bathed in black flames!

“Fire Phoenix?”

“Black flames. Could it be one of the top-tier beast bloodlines, the Immortal Phoenix?”

“No, that’s not right. This Fire Phoenix’s black flames aren’t very pure. It’s not an Immortal Phoenix, but the Netherworld Fire Phoenix.”

“Right, it’s the Netherworld Fire Phoenix, and its strength has already reached the level of a high-level Great Divine Master.”

The martial arts practice field was already in an uproar.

Countless experts were discussing animatedly.

These experts were all extremely knowledgeable and had already recognized this Fire Phoenix. They were all extremely shocked in their hearts.

The Netherworld Fire Phoenix was a branch of the Immortal Phoenix. Although it did not belong to the top-tier mutant beast bloodline, it was still considered extremely outstanding among the mutant beasts. At least in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms… it was absolutely not easy to find a mutant beast bloodline of the Netherworld Fire Phoenix’s level. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

And now, this Chi Ming had actually brought a high-level Great Divine Master level Netherworld Fire Phoenix to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

Moreover, looking at the Netherworld Fire Phoenix’s appearance, it was obvious that it had already been tamed and had become incomparably docile.

“Heavenly phoenix silver snow dress, Hehe, no matter what, it is only a piece of clothing. How can it compare to a real Phoenix?” The corners of Chi Ming’s mouth carried a trace of a sneer. However, his gaze turned towards Leng Rushuang, “Miss Leng Er is a Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, a phoenix among men, and this Netherworld Fire Phoenix can be your mount.”

Hearing Chi Ming’s words, many experts on the martial arts practice field secretly exclaimed.

“Big spending, really big spending!”

“A Netherworld Fire Phoenix at the Senior Great Divine Master level, I wonder how the Star Pavilion obtained it and tamed it.”

“This scarlet nether is really willing to spend a lot of money to win the smile of a beauty.”

Whether in terms of value or rarity, the Netherworld Fire Phoenix Mount of a high-level Great Divine Master was naturally far from what heavenly phoenix silver snow garment could compare to.

After all, in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, other than this Netherworld Fire Phoenix, it was likely that there would not be a second exotic beast that possessed the bloodline of the Immortal Phoenix.

“Bastard, that damned Chi Ming!”

Young Master Qu’s expression had already become incomparably gloomy.

It was very obvious that he was once again inferior to Chi Ming.

“Miss Leng Er, this Netherworld Fire Phoenix has already been completely tamed. You just need to make it acknowledge its master.” Chi Ming said with a smile.

However, Leng Rushuang’s expression had always been cold. She glanced at the Netherworld Fire Phoenix and shook her head slightly. “A phoenix is the empress of all beasts. It should be high and mighty, comparable to a true dragon. However, this Phoenix has completely lost its dignity and pride. Such a Phoenix can no longer be called a phoenix. Calling it an ordinary bird is more like it.”

“I appreciate Young Master Chi Ming and Young Master Qu’s good intentions. However, you should bring the Heavenly Phoenix, Yin Xue Shang, and the Netherworld Fire Phoenix back yourself.”

After saying that, Leng Rushuang directly flew to the side of the void.
