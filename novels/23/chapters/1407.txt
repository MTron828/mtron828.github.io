Chapter 1408: Gold Divine Ape

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Three Strongest Sword Principle? Isn’t that the same as me?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He became Universe God because he had merged three Strongest Sword Principles. Hence, his explosion of divine power was stronger by a hundred times than those at the same rank.

Although Ling Feibai wasn’t an inverse cultivator, if he were to really became Universe God because he merged three Strongest Sword Principle, his explosion of divine power would still be dozens of times stronger than those at the same rank.

In other words, as a Universe God in the Second Heaven, he could be evenly matched with an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven in terms of the explosion of divine power.

On top of that, including the secret skill that he had cultivated, treasures that he possessed and unique skill that he had created…

“No wonder he could be evenly matched with a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven a thousand years ago. Now that a thousand years had passed, he must be even stronger!” Jian Wushuang was shocked, “With such a strong power, it seems that if I don’t perform any tricks, I might not even qualify to be his opponent.”

“I’d better give it my all!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were twinkling with brightness. A tremendous momentum of Soul Power surged the very next moment.

The level of Soul Power was much higher than when he pulled off Soul Attack earlier.

Vroom vroom vroom! His Soul Power churned in madness and it became a huge, gold divine ape that was more than three hundred meters tall before all the disciples. There was golden light spurting out from the divine ape’s eyes. The moment it appeared, it bellowed in anger. Its roar shook heaven and earth and its imposing force spread in all directions.

Suddenly, the universe changed color!

Outside of Titanic Star, the disciples who were watching the battle noticed the power that the gold divine ape gave out. They looked frightened.

Above the boundless Milky Way, the deacon elderlies too were shocked.

“That… That’s Divine Ape?”

“First, Black Tortoise. Then, Demonic Dragon. Now, even the strongest Divine Ape appeared. Could the manipulation method of consciousness that Jian Wushuang cultivated be Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack?”

“Yes, definitely. Black Tortoise, Demonic Dragon and Divine Ape are exactly the same. As for Purple Tiger and Crimson Phoenix, he has never performed it yet.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“This young man possesses such a profound manipulation method of Soul?”

Those deacon elderlies were experienced. Previously, when there was only demonic dragon and black tortoise, they let it be. Then, when the Divine Ape appeared, they immediately recognized the origin of the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

Of course, they could recognize that, but they couldn’t tell that Jian Wushuang had been using Soul Power – not consciousness.

“The Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack, I gave it to him,” Hall Master Yuan suddenly said.

The surrounding deacon elderlies looked towards Hall Master Yuan.

“This young man is very good at consciousness attacks. However, he was inexperienced in the manipulation of consciousness. So I told Lei Chao to get the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack for him. Of course, I didn’t just give it to him. He paid a huge price for it,” Hall Master Yuan smiled. The price that he was referring to was actually the fact that Jian Wushuang had had to pretend to be a Universe God in the Second Heaven and received unfair treatment in Lineage of Star.

Hearing Hall Master Yuan’s explanation, the deacon elderlies understood.

“Tsk tsk. To be able to perform Divine Ape not only represents that Jian Wushuang’s consciousness has reached the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, but it also meant that he already reached the level of great achievement in the mastery of Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. Now that Divine Ape is out, he could definitely be evenly matched with a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven in terms of power. From what it seems, it won’t be too easy for Ling Feibai to win first place in this rotation battle,” a deacon elderlies sighed.

On Titanic Star, the gold Divine Ape that was three hundred meters tall appeared in the universe while Jian Wushuang stood right in the middle of the gold Divine Ape with his faint gold eyes. He fixed his gaze at Ling Baifei before him. There was a surge of murderous intention that soared up!

“This is fun.”

There was a flash of light twinkling in Ling Feibai’s eyes too. The very next moment, he moved and appeared before the gold Divine Ape. He wielded the purple soft sword in his hand.

A ray of purple sword light shot out and the power and size continuously increased during the process when it swept across the void. It finally reached the gold Divine Ape.

Looking at the approaching purple sword light, Jian Wushuang, who was in the gold Divine Ape, held Blood Mountain Sword and swung.

Along with the swing, there was a gold sword that appeared in the gold Divine Ape’s hand. It then imitated Jian Wushuang’s action.

Bang!

A terrifying gold sword light collided with the long purple sword shadow. After a shocking clash, the two sword lights dispersed.

“Oh?”

Ling Feibai raised his eyebrows and smirked, “Not bad. In terms of power, it’s not weaker than a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven that I once fought. I wonder how the other aspects are, too.”

Swoosh!

Ling Feibai plunged forward. As he was charging forward, a boundless purple mist began spreading.

“Meteor Shower!”

Wah!

In the purple mist, the rays of purple sword light were like meteorites. They showered down towards the gold Divine Ape’s body.

“So fast!”

Jian Wushuang revealed a face of terror and he quickly waved his sword to block the purple sword light.

However, it was impossible for the gold Divine Ape’s huge body to block off those fine meteor-like purple sword light. It most likely only blocked one-third of them.

The rest of the two-thirds of the sword lights hit the gold Divine Ape’s huge body, unfiltered.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Some parts of the Divine Ape’s body were pierced by purple sword lights and there were holes all over.

However, these holes were filled back instantly by Soul Power. Hence, the gold Divine Ape wasn’t affected at all.

“A Divine Ape formed by consciousness…. even when it was pierced, it could recover immediately?” Ling Feibai squinted his eyes and then smiled, “How about this then…”

Swoosh!

Ling Feibai’s body suddenly moved and appeared by the side of the gold Divine Ape. He swung his purple soft sword.

The sword light wasn’t hindered and instantly penetrated the gold Divine Ape’s throat. The gold Divine Ape’s huge skull then flew off.

However, although the gold Divine Ape was cut off, it was only a short while before it recovered.

“The skull could be recovered too?”

Ling Feibai creased his eyebrows, then he quickly loosened them again, “Although it could be recovered, it would require an enormous amount of consciousness. Although your consciousness is strong, how long could you stand for if you kept using it?”

Ling Feibai’s voice spread and Jian Wushuang, who was in the gold Divine Ape, suddenly felt strange.
