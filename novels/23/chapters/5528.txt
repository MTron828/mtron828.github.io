Chapter 5528 ¬†The Big Wedding

As Jian Wushuang left, the demonic sound also retreated from a distance.

Deputy Hall Master Zhong frowned slightly; everyone was assisting Jian Wushuang, but only he made a move to intercept.

"Master Zhong, we'll meet again another day!" Wang Han and the others didn't care much. After completing their mission, they headed straight to the central hall, where Qiuhuang's resistance allowed them to escape directly.

Heading to the northern territory to lay low was a wise choice. The matter of raiding the prison was significant, neither too small nor too large.

If Lu Hua couldn't hold on, they would have to keep fleeing.

However, Lu Hua had promised them. While there would be definite life-threatening situations, it was just a matter of carrying some infamy. Upon returning to the Elder Palace in the future, he would compensate them.

Wang Han and the others left calmly, and Deputy Hall Master Zhong didn't pursue them. Instead, he stared intently at the supreme-peak expert.

"Li Mizhou, you are truly confused. Wang Han and the others have Lu Hua's support, but who supports you?" There was a hint of killing intent in Deputy Hall Master Zhong's eyes.

Letting Wang Han go was acceptable, with Lu Hua providing cover. But who supported Li Mizhou and his group?

That was hard to say, so these people must not be allowed to escape.

By now, Jian Wushuang had already fled. Li Mizhou and the others had come to raid the prison to take away Jian Wushuang, but now he hadn't been captured and was being stopped by the Law Enforcement Hall.

Although the attack by Divine General Moyin showed some mercy and didn't have the intent to kill, it still caused Li Mizhou severe injuries.

Facing Deputy Hall Master Zhong again, it was somewhat difficult to leave.

"Charge out first! Once other powerful beings arrive, we're done for!" Li Mizhou's face turned grim.

This time, in their planning, they were careless.

They didn't anticipate someone would come to rescue Jian Wushuang. If they had known, they would have stayed outside to guard.

Boom!

In the distance, Jian Wushuang turned around, glanced, but found nothing amiss. He just felt that the commotion was a bit too much.

But that was fine. Some powerful individuals in Longevity Hall had already been distracted, and he could take advantage of the opportunity to go and seize the bride.

Another terrifying aura erupted behind him, and a great battle swept through all the nearby waters for millions of miles. Jian Wushuang struggled to fly out and headed straight for Longevity Hall.

Longevity Hall.

Although it was far from the Enforcement Hall, one could still sense the clearly visible terrifying aura. That direction was the Hall of Enforcement, where Jian Wushuang was still suppressed.

This made many people furrow their brows.

At this moment, the guests had already taken their seats. Many wanted to go out and take a look but were stopped by Wu Zuo.

"Continue drinking, continue dancing!" Wu Zuo calmly raised his wine cup and said coldly, "Do you all not believe in the strength of my Enforcement?"

Buzz!

An aura emanated from him, directly suppressing everyone present.

Those who wanted to go out and see what was happening also halted their steps.

Some people were on par with Wu Zuo, as they were all Hall Masters. However, the difference in strength was significant.

Wu Zuo was the pinnacle existence among the supreme-peak experts.

Even the three Hall Masters could only contend with him.

Moreover, he was the only living disciple under the Qishen, not only terrifying in strength but also possessing the secret technique bestowed by the Qishen.

It was a secret technique created by the Qishen.

Once activated, no one in the Elder Palace could stop Wu Zuo except for Divine General Moyin and others.

After suppressing the scene, Wu Zuo revealed a cold smile.

In the back hall, Tie San, however, noticed that something was wrong but was currently in a dilemma.

Was it the right time to intervene? It couldn't be delayed any longer!

"Hall Master, I've already ordered people to set up around Longevity Hall. Ten tier 6 Emperor experts are stationed there. Even if Jian Wushuang dares to come, he won't leave alive!"

Tie San's eyelid twitched, feeling uneasy. He spoke, "Have Brother Qiuqian personally guard the entrance. Mobilize some native Emperors from the Four Great Secret Realms. As long as we can get through today peacefully, I'll offer 5,000 cubic universe crystals freely to them!"

He had invested heavily, and his manpower was insufficient. Even the native Emperors were sent out.

"Yes!"

After everything was arranged, Tie San turned and entered the inner chamber.

"Miaoyi, it's time. Come with me to the main hall!" Tie San spoke gently.

Gong Miaoyi wore a red ceremonial dress. On this day, she didn't conceal her beauty but displayed it openly, stunning Tie San.

Although it wasn't the first time they met, the feeling of soon possessing each other, that sense of instant control, overwhelmed him.

The beauty that made even tier 6 peak-level Emperors moved, was truly peerless.

Gong Miaoyi had a cold expression as she approached, gently linking arms with Tie San. The two of them tore through space and instantly arrived at the main hall.

Their appearance instantly broke the somewhat awkward atmosphere.

Tie San and Gong Miaoyi stood in the main positions.

"Today, I, Tie San, am getting married. Thank you all for coming. If you need anything in the future, feel free to ask!" After saying this, they each bowed.

Even Emperor Si Tian standing beside them was excited. Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates

Speaking of which, he was the one who introduced Gong Miaoyi to his master. Their union was a credit he would remember!

However, just as the two of them were about to rise and lift their wine cups to toast everyone, a terrifying aura descended.

"Tie San!!!"

Boom!

Jian Wushuang, like a towering giant, descended from the sky, directly shattering the dome above the main hall.

At this moment, the external sky became somewhat gloomy.

Tie San's expression changed, knowing that he couldn't mess up his formation at this moment. He hastily shouted, "Someone, get him out of here!"

"Hmph!" Jian Wushuang sneered, "Stop yelling. I've already dealt with those country bumpkins outside!"

"How is that possible!" Tie San's face darkened.

If the local Emperors outside couldn't stop him, that would be understandable.

But Qiuqian, his elder brother's capable assistant, was stronger than him only by a hair. How could he be defeated by Jian Wushuang?

Little did he know that the people he had arranged outside had already been personally taken care of by Emperor Lu Hua.

They were all completely suppressed.

Everything was done silently, after all, by a supreme-peak powerhouse.

How could it be possible for others to find out?

"Jian Wushuang, today is my big wedding day. I advise you not to cause trouble!" Tie San's aura changed, ready to take action at any moment.

This time, he wouldn't endure it again.

At the same time, he transmitted to Wu Zuo in anger, "Brother Wu Zuo, didn't we agree to release him only after today?"

Tie San was increasingly suspicious that Wu Zuo was playing him.

Originally, they had discussed waiting until after today to release Jian Wushuang.

By then, Tie San would take Miaoyi and leave for the Northern Territory, without worrying about Jian Wushuang causing trouble.

Wu Zuo just casually transmitted, "Don't worry, what waves can a Dao Lord stir up? Besides, he's now a fugitive. You can take action against him. With my guarantee, everything will be fine!"

With these words, Tie San's mood finally stabilized.

The Destruction Origin Source within Jian Wushuang began to be released, and it instantly fell into the great hall.
