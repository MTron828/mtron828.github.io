Chapter 5602 ¬†Death Comes

However, even now, without a physical body, it was impossible to stop him relying solely on the divine body.

"Slash!"

Jian Wushuang once again exerted all his strength, changing direction and charging towards Broly's divine body.

The towering divine body was not bound by the constraints of time.

Broly also understood that without the support of a physical body, he was currently very fragile and needed to break the restrictions of this place as soon as possible.

Although only the divine body remained, the power of each punch still possessed the supreme-peak strength. With each punch, the void continued to shatter.

In front of Broly, the frozen void seemed like a series of mirrors.

Jian Wushuang's eye sockets contracted. At this rate, he couldn't attack Broly at all. Moreover, the strength consumed by this sword move was too great, and he couldn't afford to drag on with his opponent.

"Broly, can you only hide?" Jian Wushuang, in desperation, could only try to provoke the other verbally, angrily shouting, "You're not worthy of being a cultivator, nor a qualified warrior. Have you forgotten Bukun's teachings?"

"Show me your full strength and face me in a direct battle!"

In a head-on confrontation, he was invincible!

This sword strike was invincible.

Broly's eyes turned from white to blood-red, and the white arcs on his body turned blood-colored.

His aura surged once again!

This aura made Jian Wushuang feel somewhat familiar and fearful. He had considerable knowledge of Tribulation realm experts and had faced several Six Tribulation realm superpowers such as Fuego.

That aura, he was too familiar with it.

Broly could still erupt, which he hadn't anticipated. This time, the aura could rival that of a Tribulation realm.

The sword was drawn, and he couldn't care less. Even if Qishen bowed to Broly at this moment, he would charge forward and cut him down.

This was the only chance.

Whenever there was only one chance left, he would always ask himself deep down: If this were his last opportunity in life, how would he unleash strength beyond himself to defeat the opponent?

If he couldn't succeed, it would be his downfall.

So, he had to win.

The Jueyun Sword froze the void and time.

Now, in this void, only he and Broly's divine body could move.

Broly transformed again after entering another realm. Gone was the previous ferocity, replaced by a hint of composure.

Facing his strongest strike, Broly didn't dodge but confronted it head-on.

This played right into his hands.

The Jueyun Sword instantly descended, transforming into a size of billions of miles, facing Broly directly.

There was no chance for him to dodge now. Jian Wushuang seemed to have seen what Broly would look like after his fall through time.

However, at this moment, in the headquarters of the Earth Realm Divine Temple, Zhen Ling suddenly sensed something amiss. Shouting in alarm, he hurriedly rushed towards Jian Wushuang's direction.

Zhen Ling freely traversed the Four Great Secret Realms, needing only a breath to reach Jian Wushuang's location.

But for peak-level experts, even a breath was somewhat slow.

The first strike!

Success!

Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

This time, with a complete execution, he gained profound insights. The first strike could be considered truly perfected to a state of perfection.

The space within a million miles in all directions transformed into a painting, leaving only him as a vibrant life.

Broly's presence could no longer be sensed.

In the painting, Broly, with his red hair and shimmering red arcs, extended one hand, pinching Jian Wushuang's Jueyun Sword with two fingers.

"How arrogant!" Jian Wushuang looked at the scene, disdainful in his heart.

Attempting to block him with just two fingers? That was underestimating the power of the Starry Sky too much!

Lowering his head to admire his masterpiece, Jian Wushuang felt satisfied.

However, his Jueyun Sword also fell into the painting this time, turning into an inanimate object.

But it wasn't a big deal; he could retrieve it using the power of Life.

It wasn't difficult.

Just as he was about to separate the painting and prepare to take it, the space captured in the painting began to tremble.

"Huh?" Jian Wushuang scanned the surroundings in surprise.

The next moment, his chest burst open, and a giant hand appeared before him.

Before he could react, trying to mobilize the power of Life to replenish himself, Death had already arrived, firmly suppressing his Life force within the Origin Source.

That frenzied power of Death continued to devour his Life power.

Jian Wushuang stared wide-eyed with his mouth agape.

Life was constantly slipping away.

It was Broly!

Or rather, it was Mie Sheng.

Mie Sheng controlled Broly, suddenly shattering his Starry Sky Chronicles, seizing the opportunity to launch a sneak attack, and piercing through his chest in one strike.

The Candle Dragon Armor shattered completely, turning into fragments.

Without the intact Beast God Origin Source, the Beast God Weapon could easily be shattered by a Tribulation realm expert.

Resisting the supreme-peak was easy, but he was facing Mie Sheng!

A super being capable of directly confronting Zhen Ling.

He found himself unable to communicate with Zhen Ling.

This time, it was his turn to be completely desperate.

The force of Death, in a relentless manner, devoured his Life.

In a trance, he also came to understand.

No wonder he had evolved from the power of All Things into the power of Life; there was indeed a relative strength.

Now, he had become someone else's stepping stone.

Space combined with time could form a temporal structure.

Life combined with Death could also form reincarnation.

This wasn't a simple cycle; like Hu Qing mastering the essence of Zen, what he practiced was true reincarnation.

Now, he had taken a step to comprehend the true essence of reincarnation.

It was a complete cycle.

On par with the level of time and space.

It was a power surpassing the realm of Tribulation.

A shortcut!

A path to step into a higher level.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang realized it.

However, he found that the force of Death, although it could suppress him, did not contain a power as formidable as Mie Sheng's true form.

It was relative, an interaction.

If the Death power of the Six Tribulation realm eroded the power of Life, it would probably be like drawing water with a bamboo basket‚Äîfutile. The opponent was just a mass of Death power at the supreme-peak level.

He still had hope.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang summoned the last strand of Thought power and traveled to his own Origin Source Sea, condensing it into an incarnation. Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for ùíèew ùíèovels

At this moment, his Origin Source Sea was churning with waves.

When his incarnation appeared, it coincidentally faced the mass of Death power.

The incarnation formed by the condensation of Life force had the same appearance as his main body, but emitted a green aura.

Upon discovering Jian Wushuang's incarnation, the Death power twisted and transformed into a figure resembling Jian Wushuang, only in black.

"Hehe, you can't stop me!" the black Jian Wushuang sneered.

Jian Wushuang directly made a move. This place was his Origin Source Sea; could he be threatened by an outsider?

"Just with your scraps, you still dare to attempt devouring me?!" Jian Wushuang shouted angrily and directly attacked.

The two engaged in a simple battle, using their pure strength, without resorting to the desperate and secret techniques used by the main bodies.
