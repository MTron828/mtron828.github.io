Chapter 3592: The Strongest!

“Oh no!”

Nine Sword Demon Master’s expression changed drastically. He had already seen Jian Wushuang appear beside him. At the same time, a cold sword light lit up again.

It was the Peerless Sword Manual, Star Dream!

“Another Ruler Realm secret technique?” Nine Sword Demon Master was in despair.

There was no room for him to struggle. As the sword light passed by, his voice and breath were cut off. His godly sword at the level of top-tier true treasure, the true treasure armor on his body, and his universe ring…they all fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

“No wonder it’s a top-tier universe treasure. It has a strong murderous aura. It’s much stronger than my Absolute Shadow Divine Sword.” Jian Wushuang looked at the pitch-black divine sword in his hand with interest. After a long while, he raised his head again.

However, when he raised his head, he found that Blood Spirit King, Blood Saber Emperor, and Thunder Blaze Master had gathered together again. The three of them kept a distance from him and looked at him from afar. In the depths of their eyes, there was a trace of shock and fear.

Not only the three of them, but also the Principles Masters who were watching the battle in the surrounding void were completely silent at this moment.

Silence!

The whole world was terrifyingly silent!

After a while, Blood Saber Emperor was the first to speak, breaking the silence.

“Blood Sword Master, have you been hiding your strength?” Blood Saber Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course, if I didn’t hide my strength, why would you all come to me to kill me? Unfortunately, I’m not strong enough to kill you, so I can only kill two of you.” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

Hearing this, Blood Saber Emperor fell silent again.

At this moment, the hearts of the experts present had already been set ablaze.

It should be known that when the five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm joined hands to kill Jian Wushuang, almost everyone thought that they could most likely take him down. Even if they could not kill him, they could at least force him into a desperate situation, they asked him to honestly tell them everything about his encounter.

But the final result completely overturned everyone’s understanding.

The five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm attacked at the same time and revealed their strongest strength. But in the end...in the blink of an eye, two of the five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm were killed by Jian Wushuang on the spot, the remaining three were also severely injured.

The strength that Jian Wushuang displayed in just a moment was too terrifying!

“His strength and power are obviously stronger than ours. Among the Principles Masters of the pinnacle of the six realm, I’m also good at head-on collisions and competing in power. However, the power that he released in an instant can definitely crush me!” Blood Spirit King said in a low voice.

“And his protective ability is even more terrifying. He completely ignored the strongest attacks of Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Devil Master, and Kun Master, who were at the pinnacle of the six realm. Even when the three attacks landed on his body, his body did not even tremble. What kind of terrifying protective ability was this?

“The true treasure armor on his body is definitely of an extraordinary level!”

“What?!”

“It’s fine if his power and protective ability are strong, but the key is his absolute art. He actually created a seventh-level, which is an absolute art at the Ruler Realm, and not just one. This is too terrifying!” Thunder Blaze Master’s body was trembling.

“An absolute art at the level of a seventh-level Ruler is on a completely different level from a sixth-level absolute art. Its power is tens of times or nearly a hundred times stronger than an ultimate art at the sixth-level. Its basic power is already stronger than ours, and he even created a seventh-level absolute art. The power he unleashed in an instant...even if the five of us join forces and clash head-on with him, we will definitely be completely crushed by him,” Blood Blade Emperor exclaimed.

“In this territory, many of the experts at the pinnacle of the six realm are only one step away from becoming a Ruler. However, this step is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. As for the absolute arts at the Ruler Realm, they are still unattainable by many experts at the pinnacle of the six realm. As far as I know, among the many experts at the pinnacle of the six realm in this territory, there is only one who has created a level seven absolute art. Moreover, that person has already disappeared without a trace for three million years. It is unknown whether he is still in this territory.”

“However, even the one who created the seven realm absolute art is only as powerful as us. In other words, if he were to fight against the Blood Sword Master, he would still be no match for the Blood Sword Master!”

Blood Spirit King, Blood Blade Emperor, and Thunder Blaze Master looked at each other with a hint of shock in their eyes.

The power of his basic strength was much stronger than that of an ordinary expert at the pinnacle of the six realm. Moreover, he had created an absolute art at the level of a rank seven Ruler. Not only that, but his strength...

“He’s the strongest!”

“Blood Sword Master is definitely qualified to be called the strongest among the many Principles Masters in our territory!”

“Yes, he is indeed the strongest Principles Master. At least among the countless Principles Masters in this territory, no one is his match. Even those monsters who were supposed to be at the top of the Principles Masters are no match for him. The only one who is stronger than him is a Ruler!”

Blood Spirit King, Blood Saber Emperor, and Thunder Blaze Master did not try to hide their voices. Jian Wushuang was not the only one who heard their words. The many experts who were watching the battle in the surrounding void had also heard them.

In an instant, the surrounding void was filled with exclamations. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The strongest...the strongest among the Principles Masters was also the strongest Principles Master.

This title was not something that just anyone could have. It was not something that anyone could be sure of. To get the full title, one had to have an incredible battle record.

Now, Jian Wushuang had fought alone against five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm. He had killed two of them and severely injured three of them. This battle record was indeed shocking, and he was qualified to be called the strongest Principles Master.

In addition to the comments made by Blood Spirit King, Blood Saber Emperor, and Thunder Blaze Master, many Principles Masters who had lost their lives nodded in agreement.

As for Jian Wushuang, he smiled when he heard their conversation. “You three, do you want to continue?”

“Continue?”

Blood Spirit King, Blood Saber Emperor, and Thunder Blaze Master were shocked, and their bodies also trembled.

Previously, the five of them were instantly killed by two people, and now there were only three of them, how could they have the courage to continue attacking.

“Blood Sword Master, your strength surpasses us, far beyond us. Not to mention the three of us now, even if a few more experts at the pinnacle of the six realm came, they would only be completely crushed by you. Since that’s the case, then why are we still fighting for it?” Blood Spirit King said directly.

“Right, the opportunity treasure is originally for those with ability. Since you are so powerful, we naturally don’t dare to covet it.” Blood Blade Emperor also nodded.
