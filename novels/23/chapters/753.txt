Chapter 754: Yun Fan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Yun Fan, who had turned into a Silver-armored Ancient God, had blue veins bulging out of his skin. This meant he was also pulling out all the stops.

The powerful starry Sword River finally crashed into the Yun Fan’s staff shadow.

“Bang!”

A deafening bang sounded. A frightening shock wave spread out and swept across the area with overwhelming momentum.

On the ground below, numerous pits appeared. The entire earth started trembling like mad.

The sky was falling and the earth was opening up. It looked like doomsday had arrived.

The two Eternal Realm experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard, who were still quite far from Jian Wushuang and Yun Fan, were also influenced by the shock wave. They let out a muffled yell and quickly retreated in disorder.

When they finally came to a halt and regained their balance, they found blood trickling down the corners of their mouths.

In the center of the battlefield, the energy collision was still causing explosions.

But the fierce collisions only lasted a few minutes before two huge bodies were thrown into the air.

Blood spilled from the corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth. His 15-meter long body flew back several thousand meters and then came to a halt.

As for Yun Fan, he was not much better off than Jian Wushuang.

“I’ve spared no effort but still failed to get the upper hand?”

Jets of dazzling light burst out from Jian Wushuang’s eyes. His giant body broke into a run at an amazing speed and charged at Yun Fan again. He laughed heartily. “Another round!”

Yun Fan’s face was expressionless. He clutched the black Stone Staff more tightly and stepped forward.

The two crossed swords again.

This time, they were in close combat. Jian Wushuang displayed his real swordsmanship.

Yun Fan also gave a full play of his Staff Technique.

“Clank! Clank! Clank! Boom—”

Fearful roars could be heard incessantly. Each rumble was thunderous and expansive, spreading in all directions.

Though Palace Master Destruction, Palace Master Mo Tao, and Palace Master Ming Xin had long since fled far away, they noticed what was happening behind them. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Seeing the horrible power created by the close combat between Jian Wushuang and Yun Fan was extremely nerve-racking.

“How powerful!” Palace Master Ming Xin exclaimed, clasping both hands.

“Stop dawdling, let’s get out of here!” Palace Master Destruction growled.

“Yes.” Palace Master Ming Xin and Palace Master Mo Tao nodded. They took off.

But before they left, Palace Master Destruction cast a significant look at Jian Wushuang. The look was slightly peculiar.

“Bang!”

Two strikes crashed into each other again.

“He is only a One-star Demon God. How can his battle strength be so overbearing? He didn’t even suffer when he crashed into me head-on!” Yun Fan thought, his face quite grim. “To defeat him, I will have to resort to my trump card. But the most I can do is defeat him. Killing him, I’m afraid, is impossible.”

Yun Fan grumbled. All of a sudden, he realized that Palace Master Destruction and his lot were already out of his vision.

“Damn it! They got away!” Yun Fan cursed, but he could do nothing about it.

The only thing he could blame was his luck. He was just unlucky to come across such a fearful Demon God who deliberately picked on him.

“Let’s go!”

In spite of his defiance, Yun Fan still chose to give up and take off.

He had no way of killing Jian Wushuang. Considering the large number of Demon Gods in the Tianqi Mountains and the commotion he had caused in the fight, there were probably several Demon Gods in the vicinity already coming this way. He had to leave now.

When Yun Fan attempted to leave, Jian Wushuang showed no intention of stopping him. He just watched Yun Fan take his departure.

When Yun Fan left, Jian Wushuang’s body shrank and he returned to his human appearance. He put his silver mask on, but you could still see his dismal eyes through the two holes in the mask.

“Yun Fan really is a Great Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard. He is way too strong.”

“I turned into a Gold-armored Ancient God and gave a full play of my strength. My battle strength must have reached Step Four of the Eternal Realm. And yet I still couldn’t finish him!”

“Plus, he’s a Great Elder from the Cloud Sea Asgard, he must have some trump cards or awesome Secret Skills that he could but didn’t use.”

Jian Wushuang murmured.

He knew that to break through any of the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm would require a real metamorphosis of strength.

Although the Eternal Realm was divided into six steps, most of the Eternal Realm experts in the Firmament Territory were stuck at Step One or Step Two. Some experts could not even reach Step One. Only a handful of experts could bring their battle strength to Step Three.

You could count the Eternal Realm experts who were equipped with a Step Three battle strength on two hands. Even if you counted in solitary experts as well, there were still less than 20.

As for the number of experts at Step Four, it would be even less.

Currently, the only Eternal Realm expert who had reached beyond Step Four in the entire Firmament Territory was Xuan Yi.

Yun Fan had the potential to reach Step Four, but no one had verified it. After all, ever since he became a Great Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard, people seldom saw him strike.

But after this fight, Jian Wushuang was certain that Yun Fan had a battle strength at Step Four.

“He used a Long Staff as his weapon, and he also produced the Staff Heart. Like my Sword Heart, his Staff Heart is also at the peak of Level Two. However, he can turn into a Silver-armored Ancient God. Once he transformed, his strength soared up, which could probably match someone at the peak of Step Three. In addition, he has practiced the Star-river Secret Skill!”

He had clearly sensed the power of the Star-river Secret Skill Yun Fan cast.

“Level Five. His Star-river Secret Skill has already reached Level Five. He can unleash an offensive power 15 times more than his original power, which is five times stronger than normal Eternal Realm experts. In light of this sole advantage, I’m sure his battle strength has already passed Step Three of the Eternal Realm and entered Step Four.”

“If he also uses one of his trump cards or another Secret Skill, he can never lose to other experts at Step Four.”

As for Jian Wushuang, when he was not an Ancient God, his battle strength was at the peak of Step Two.

But once he transformed into an Ancient God… It should be noted that he was a Gold-armored Ancient God with part of the Imperial Bloodline, much tougher than the Silver-armored Ancient God Yun Fan could turn into. When he assumed the form of an Ancient God, his battle strength could reach Step Four as well.

“My overall strength is very close to his. If we actually get into a life or death battle, the result will likely depend on whose trump cards are more imposing.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, eyes glinting.

He had been holding a grudge against the three magnates for a long time.

Among the three magnates, the one he resented most was the Boundless Demon Sect. After all, it was an expert from the Boundless Demon Sect that had incurred the death of Gu Qiong.

Nevertheless, the one he favored least was the Cloud Sea Asgard.

Now that Yun Fan was a Great Elder, if Jian Wushuang could murder him, it would certainly be a huge blow to the Cloud Sea Asgard!
