Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Can I escape?”

Heartless King smirked coldly in the sky high above as she spread a boundless consciousness. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The entire universe grew dark.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang plunged out of the underground and looked at a black wall blockage formed entirely with consciousness that had appeared before him. His face grew grave.

“Break!”

Wow!

There was a sharp glimpse of sword light. Jian Wushuang erupted his divine power to his limit and performed the Real God unique skill that he had invented, Crimson Light.

Although the sword light made a huge crack on the black wall blockage, it didn’t slash the black wall blockage apart. The crack immediately recovered too.

“What?” Jian Wushuang looked to be in a fix.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two figures suddenly appeared in the black space. They were Heartless King and Blood Emperor.

“Blood Emperor, according to our deal, I found Jian Wushuang for you and locked him up in this consciousness prison. As for if you can kill him, it depends on yourself,” Heartless King smiled faintly.

“Mm, this is the remaining two Evil Soul Pearls,” Blood Emperor threw a Qian Kun ring to Heartless King as he moved towards Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, you made it so troublesome for me to find you!” Blood Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang coldly and his eyes filled with a surging murderous intention.

“We are in big trouble!”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows tightly as he looked around, “This should be one of the measures that made Heartless King famous, Consciousness Prison. It is said that in the consciousness prison, even a Real God on the top of the second level can barely escape.”

“However, just because Real God on the top of the second level couldn’t escape, doesn’t mean that I can’t.”

Jian Wushuang thought to himself quietly, he swept out his Soul Power wantonly and covered the consciousness prison surrounding him.

“The consciousness prison is really sturdy but there’s weak point. The weak point is there!” Jian Wushuang locked towards the direction. He could feel that the consciousness wall blockage from that direction was obviously much weaker than the others.

“With my ability, if I were to perform all my techniques, maybe I could explode the weak point. Then, I’d have a chance to escape!”

Jian Wushuang thought and already made up his mind.

Blood Emperor had already taken action. There was a flash of murderous intention in his eyes.

Rumble. A fierce aura soared and his body immediately grew three meters high and was covered in crimson red, as though he were a living blood person.

“Jian Wushuang, die!”

A loud shrill and the statue of the three-meter-tall blood person suddenly appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Wow!

Blood Emperor only briefly lifted his hand and immediately, there was a blade shadow that crystallized in the void, covered in crimson light.

The blade shadows that overlapped one another contained boundless power. Suddenly, they slashed at Jain Wushuang with anger.

Hong!

It was as though the entire universe was slashed in half.

“Such strong power.”

Jian Wushuang was frightened and his Soul Power instantly flowed out.

“Roar!”

A deafening roar was suddenly heard and there was golden light that erupted from Jian Wushuang’s body and formed a huge golden divine ape.

The divine ape was wielding a sword as it swept out fiercely with a boundless, unyielding manner.

“Oh?”

Heartless King, who had already moved to the border of consciousness prison, couldn’t help but rais his eyebrows, “Jian Wushuang is also good at consciousness attacks. He seems to be quite good at it too.”

Bang!

There was a loud thud and the entire universe shook madly. However, the consciousness prison was still as sturdy as a rock.

The huge divine ape became a golden, flowing light and flew out. It landed on the consciousness wall blockage behind and shook from the hit. Then, the golden divine ape took another huge stride forward.

“After taking a hit of mine, not only did you not die, but your aura didn’t even weaken. Jian Wushuang, your power is not too shabby,” the blood person that Blood Emperor had transformed into fixed its gaze on Jian Wushuang with its bloodshot eyes.

“Hehe, if Blood Emperor were to let out your fighting power of a true Real God, it would be easy-peasy to kill me. However, it won’t be that easy now,” Jian Wushuang sounded extremely arrogant.

Although he was only a Universe God, his divine body could be compared favorably with a Real God’s. On top of that, with Blood-killing plate armor, even though Blood Emperor’s abilities were much stronger than his, it wouldn’t be that easy to really kill him.

“I’d like to see just how long you can endure for?”

Blood Emperor launched another attack but he intended to fight Jian Wushuang in close combat.

Wow! Wow! Wow!

Blood Emperor was like a crimson ghost that constantly appeared around Jian Wushuang. A fierce, ferocious hit was launched one after another at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang cast three shadows simultaneously and gave full play to Flowing Light Phantom technique. At the same time, he erupted the close combat power that he had trained for the past thousand years in Sky Sword Prison entirely.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Every ferocious hit and collision made a vigorous roar.

After one thousand and three hundred years of training, Jian Wushuang’s close combat skill was definitely much stronger than before. However, compared to Blood Emperor, who became an overlord in Sky Sword Prison long ago, he was still a notch lower.

Most importantly, Blood Emperor’s comprehension of Heaven Way was sufficient to pass through the first level of Doctrine Palace.

In terms of unique skill, he was also much stronger than Jian Wushuang.

That also led to the one-sided situation in the battle.

Jian Wushuang was suppressed by Blood Emperor entirely. Luckily, his defense power was extremely strong. After he took a few hits from Blood Emperor, although he was wounded, it wasn’t to the state where he would die.

“Humph, if you were to be outside Sky Sword Prison, you’d be dead long ago!”

Blood Emperor’s gaze grew cold and continuously damaged Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang tried his best to fight back, his condition went from bad to worse due to the difference in their power.

During the vigorous fight, Jian Wushuang intentionally moved towards the weakest point of the consciousness prison.

“Soon, very soon.”

There was hope in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

He knew clearly that he was merely fighting a losing battle desperately, like a cornered wild beast, as he continued to fight against Blood Emperor.

His real intention was there but his goal was to aim at the weakest point of consciousness prison.

Just as Jian Wushuang and Blood Emperor were fighting against each other in the consciousness prison, in a place near to consciousness prison…

Swoosh!

A figure that was showered in flames appeared in the void.

He had just appeared and he could sense the boundless consciousness power nearby.

“Why would Heartless’s consciousness prison be here?”

The brawny man with fiery-red hair creased his eyebrows and instantly plunged in the direction of the consciousness prison was at.

Very quickly, he arrived before the consciousness prison. Then, he overlooked the huge consciousness prison before him.
