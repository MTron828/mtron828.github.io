4689 The Young Emperor (1)

Jian Wushuang turned around slowly. The thousands of strands of confinement power that spread from his neck glowed with a dark blue luster and almost covered half of his face.

Chun Qiu took in a deep breath. The chains on each prisoner’s neck contained an extremely terrifying sealing power. Even Yan Immortals could not bear the pain.

He had never seen the confinement power that Jian Wushuang had triggered.

How strong must one’s willpower be to endure such pain?

After taking one last look at him, Jian Wushuang passed out.

Chun Qiu rushed over and held Jian Wushuang up. Just as he was about to escape, he saw the small pile of treasures scattered in the void from the corner of his eye. He waved his sleeves and took them away.

He dodged the falling rocks and carried Jian Wushuang on their back. Like an agile mountain ape, they shuttled through the layers of rocks.

…

As the entire black mountain collapsed too quickly, the remaining 10,000 prisoners fell into the abyss along with the broken mine tunnel.

The black-robed warden was already scared out of his wits when he saw this. He turned around and fled almost at the same time the black mountain completely collapsed.

“Hey, are you just going to leave like this?”

A faint voice came from behind him, and the warden slowly turned around.

At the end of the collapsed tunnel, two figures stood side by side. One of them had half of his face covered in dark blue runes. He raised his hand and directly pulled him over.

Chun Qiu raised a dagger and stabbed it into the warden’s heart.

The two’s coordination was simple and neat to the extreme, everything was completed in an instant. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Then, Jian Wushuang raised his hand and threw the dead warden into the abyss as if he was throwing garbage, ” Lt’s go.”

Chun Qiu agreed and carried him on his back as he shuttled through the shattered mine.

Rumble…

The most magnificent and towering black mountain collapsed from the inside.

Almost at the same time, in a vast hall, a figure leaning on a magnificent bed quietly opened his eyes, and an unparalleled golden light burst out.

“Reporting to the Young Emperor, the black mountains of the Lower Three Heavens have collapsed.”

…

The joy of seeing the light and surviving a disaster lasted for a long time. Hundreds of black-robed wardens directly rushed over from all directions.

Seeing more and more wardens, Chun Qiu rolled his eyes and pretended to faint.

However, no one cared about the two prisoners. They all rushed to the ruins of the collapsed black mountains, not knowing what to do.

“Damn it, why did the black mountains collapse?!” one of the oldest wardens shouted in anger.

“With Lord Shan Ling’s protection, there’s no way the black mountains will collapse. Could it be that Lord Shan Ling has already…”

“That’s impossible. Lord Shan Ling is a Yan Immortal. Even the Young Emperor would not be able to injure him.”

A clamor of voices resounded, and the nearly thousand black-robed wardens were helpless.

“The collapse of the black mountains is not a small matter. If the Young Emperor blames us, no one will be able to bear it.” The older man frowned and looked past the crowd at the two figures on the ground.

“Take him away and interrogate him carefully!”

Chun Qiu’s eyes opened slightly, and then he continued to pretend to be unconscious.

In a daze, the two of them were thrown into a prison cell.

After they left, Chun Qiu sat up from the ground and started to take care of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were tightly shut. His sweat turned into mist and rose from his body. The sealing power that covered half of his face started to fade.

Chun Qiu hesitated for a moment, then took out a dark purple crystal the size of a thumb and tried to stuff it into Jian Wushuang’s mouth.

Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang, who was in a coma, opened his eyes quietly. His gaze was heavy and majestic. Chun Qiu was so frightened that his hands trembled and he almost threw the crystal away.

“Y-you’re fine?” Chun Qiu continued.

Jian Wushuang did not speak. He took the crystal from him and put it into his mouth without thinking.

The moment the crystal entered his mouth, it immediately turned into pure and surging Yan power, rapidly repairing his broken meridians.

Seeing that he was recovering, Chun Qiu heaved a sigh of relief. “That’s good, that’s good.”

“What is this place?” Jian Wushuang turned his head and asked.

“This prison is a place where prisoners who have committed crimes are temporarily locked up. We will be out soon.” Chun Qiu seemed to be familiar with this.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then looked at the chain iron medal on his neck. Somehow, he felt that the lines on the iron medalions were familiar, but he could not figure out where he had seen them.

“I advise you not to use brute force to destroy this thing, even Yan Immortal can’t do anything about it,” Chun Qiu reminded him kindly.

Jian Wushuang suddenly recalled that when he had accidentally entered the Great Yan Domain, the giant beast Ah Zi and the lady in green armor had the same metal plate on their necks.

Could these metal plates be the same?

Jian Wushuang’s thoughts were a mess and he was speechless.

The first time he entered the Great Yan Domain, he had laid in the Desolate Land for nearly 600,000 years. This time, he had made full preparations, but he had instead become a prisoner.

What kind of bullsh*t place this Great Yan Domain is? It was really unfriendly…

In order to make sure that he had not come to the wrong place, Jian Wushuang asked Chun Qiu again.

When Chun Qiu heard this, he looked at him with a stifled smile and said, “I say, Big Brother, if we’re not in the Great Yan Domain, are we in the void? To be exact, we’re in the lower three heavens of the Great Si Region.”

“The Lower Three Heavens of the Great Si Region?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

Looking at the confusion in his eyes, even Chun Qiu felt a little helpless. He explained, “The so-called Great Si Region is just one of the countless realms. It doesn’t have any special meaning. You only need to know that you are now a prisoner.”

“Speaking of which, I don’t believe that they could capture you after you killed that Yan Immortal in the black mountains.” Chun Qiu’s face was filled with curiosity. “Are you an Emperor from some realm?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. From the moment he entered the Great Yan Domain and opened his eyes, he had become like this. Then, he went into some random mountain to mine and even killed Yan Immortals without stopping.

After this series of events, it was as if there was a pair of big hands in the dark, pushing him forward.

“How do I get rid of my prisoner status, and this?” Jian Wushuang pointed at the chain on his neck and said.

“Very simple.” Chun Qiu grinned. “Escape from here, or kill the Young Emperor.”

“Kill the Young Emperor.” Jian Wushuang repeated softly. Just as he was about to ask again, Chun Qiu spoke again.

“If you were once an Emperor like me, then you can only leave this place after killing the Emperor of the Great Si Region.”
