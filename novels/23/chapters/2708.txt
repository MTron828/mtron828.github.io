Chapter 2709: Star Armor Domain

Jian Wushuang and Fo Yi were separated by a certain distance in the void as they held each other with their gazes.

“Why? Are you thinking of making me stay here forever?” Fo Yi stared indignantly at Jian Wushuang.

“I do think so.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. “Fo Yi, I’ve just learned a powerful method not too long ago and never performed it in front of anyone. I guess I’ll try it out on you today.”

Fo Yi’s pupils constricted in horror.

Jian Wushuang’s lips curled as dark golden light shone from the dark golden armor on his body and permeated in all directions with just a thought. It filled the entire place in the blink of an eye.

“This is...a domain-type method?” Fo Yi’s expression changed as he could tell the dark golden light covering the entire area was a domain-like method.

Jian Wushuang was quietly feeling the dark golden domain’s power.

“Is this the Star Armor Domain? It looks good, but I don’t know how powerful it is?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Star Armor Domain was a method that came with the Nine Sparkle Star Armor secret technique.

It was the same as Prison of Punishment and Divine Extermination of Punishment that came along with the Divine God of Punishment. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang could only display the Star Armor Domain method when achieving mastery over the Precious Armor Chapter. Jian Wushuang had just cultivated the Precious Armor Chapter of Nine Sparkle Star Armor not too long ago, hence the domain-type method was still new to him.

He had then fully displayed the Star Armor Domain.

“What can this domain do to me?” Fo Yi’s divine body remained in a golden shade as he looked like a golden Buddha. He observed the dark golden domain around him but did not take it seriously.

“Hehe, let’s give it a try.” Jian Wushuang smiled before waving his hand. “Star Armor Domain, Oppression!”

Rumbling!

A terrifying oppressive force suddenly erupted from the dark golden domain and exerted its effect on Fo Yi.

Fo Yi was not bothered at first, but his face drastically changed when the domain began oppressing him.

“This domain is so powerful!” Fo Yi was horrified.

Fo Yi had no idea the Star Armor Domain was from one of the five powerful secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sect—Nine Sparkle Star Armor. It was incomparable to any ordinary domain secret techniques. In addition, Jian Wushuang’s divine power was extremely powerful at that time when he displayed the Star Armor Domain, causing the oppressive force to be terrifying.

Fo Yi felt his divine body was strapped on with a heavy chain while his strength was greatly restricted.

It was just the beginning.

A large amount of golden divine power erupted from Jian Wushuang’s body after unfolding the Star Armor Domain. The divine power instantly turned into a vast golden divine power ocean that swept around in a frenzied manner. The golden divine power ocean also covered most parts of the void before a huge golden prison soon took shape.

The golden prison was none other than the Prison of Punishment from the Divine God of Punishment.

Not only did the Prison of Punishment form a golden prison and sealed the world, but a powerful domain power had also erupted from within the prison.

The two domain-type methods—Prison of Punishment and Star Armor Domain overlapped.

In the end, an appalling sword intent rose as Jian Wushuang displayed his 100,000 miles Perfect Sword World.

Jian Wushuang’s Sword World did not give much of an oppressive effect on Fo Yi as his Sword World was still at the Profound Achievement level, whereas Grand Ultimate God Fo Yi had a Perfect Principle World.

However, the double domain-type oppression of Prison of Punishment and Star Armor Domain were enough to make Fo Yi cringed.

“My strength...was suppressed by a good forty percent!”

Fo Yi opened his eyes wide in shock.

It was true that his combat power was top-tier even among Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods, but with his strength being suppressed by a good 40 percent by the double domain-type oppressive method he was only left with 60 percent of his strength. His combat prowess dropped sharply and was only able to display strength estimated to only be at the level of an ordinary Primary-level Grand Ultimate God.

Even Strange Old Snake could easily subdue Fo Yi with a single move under such circumstances.

It was unfortunate that Fo Yi was facing Jian Wushuang who was much more powerful than Strange Old Snake!

“Fo Yi, I told you before that Sword Alliance isn’t a place where people can come and go as they wish!”

“You and your men should stay here forever since you’ve made the trip!”

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang shouted sternly and the Transmigration Sword Formation suspended in the void suddenly rose in power and shot out again.

Its strength was extremely fast and powerful and was indeed much stronger than before with the help of those domain-type methods.

Rumbling!

Though the black divine sword had not yet reached Fo Yi, its terrifying power had been propagated and shocked Fo Yi.

Fo Yi wanted to wield the golden spear in his hand and tried his best to resist the attack. However, Jian Wushuang who stood in the void before Fo Yi slowly raised his palm and pointed his finger in Fo Yi’s direction at that critical moment.

Space-time Divine Technique—A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!

Buzz... The vast power of Space-time Law permeated.

The Space-time where Fo Yi became completely stagnated without any warning.

Fo Yi stood frozen—unable to make the slightest movement.

Although Jian Wushuang had made a breakthrough in his cultivation realm, he did not make much improvement in the perception of Space-time Law despite the power displayed when he executed that move was much stronger than before. It would not be a problem had he used the same move against a Heaven Ultimate God, but its effect was not the same against a genuine Grand Ultimate God—Fo Yi.

Therefore, Fo Yi quickly recovered after falling into stagnation for a very short time. The black divine sword was right in front of him when the space-time around Fo Yi reverted to normal.

Fo Yi was stunned and immediately swung his spear to resist the sword attack. However, his speed was a little slower due to the double domain-type oppressive method that had restricted his strength.

Although he managed to place his spear in front of him and block the black divine sword, the spear was immediately crushed by the black divine sword.

The black divine sword carried heaven-shattering power and bombarded Fo Yi’s divine body.

“Puff!”

Fo Yi’s divine body began to tremble violently before his body flew away like a cannonball after coughing out a big mouthful of blood. He had suffered heavy injuries.

“Not dead yet? Then, let’s do it again.”

The indifferent Jian Wushuang pointed his finger again. Buzz!

The same trick occurred once again as the space-time around Fo Yi fell into a state of temporary stagnation.

The black divine sword soon appeared in front of him again when he recovered.

At that time, he no longer could swing his spear to resist the sword attack as his divine body was again bombarded by the black divine sword.

There was still a great deal of power that penetrated Fo Yi’s divine body despite the blow being weakened by Fo Yi’s defensive armor. The horrifying power then permeated through Fo Yi’s divine body with the impact shattering his internal organs—instantly cutting off his life!
