Chapter 91: Who Is the Prey?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the bumpy Earth, Jian Wushuang was vehemently fighting with a Moon-fire Lion who was in the Initial Gold Core Realm.

If he wanted to, Jian Wushuang could have easily killed the Moon-fire Lion. But, it was obvious that he did not intend to do so.

“It’s the third time that I’ve had a fierce fight with a Spirit Beast and deliberately made tremendous noises. Are there any Dark Silver Guards around that will be attracted by it?” Jian Wushuang was not sure because only other Spirit Beasts had been attracted the last two times.

The intense battle continued for a while, and then Jian Wushuang “very fiercely” killed the Moon-fire Lion.

A silver-haired man, standing behind a nearby tree, watched this scene silently. At the moment, he concentrated his attention and then quietly rushed out.

“Beat the air again?” Jian Wushuang felt pity as he went to pick up the Core of the Moon-fire Lion.

At that moment, a slight wind came suddenly.

Common warriors, even the Warriors in the Profound Gold Core Realm might not have been able to sense such a light sound, but Jian Wushuang could hear the sound clearly because he had comprehended the Sword Essense of Gale.

“He’s finally come.” Jian Wushuang felt happy, and in the next moment, he turned around and looked over.

That warrior in silver was worthy of being a professional killer of the Dark Silver Guard. He picked a very good time for assassination, as Jian Wushuang had his back toward him.

When he burst out, he directly stabbed at Jian Wushuang’s neck with a Purple Soft Sword.

The sword was so fast, and the warrior in silver was full of confidence with this move.

“How wonderful the opportunity is! And what a perfect assassination! Even if he is a real expert in the Profound Gold Core Realm, he could not withstand my sword. There is no doubt that this guy is going to die, and the 17th Golden-dragon Ring will be had.” The warrior in silver smiled to himself, along with the smile on his face.

But unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang, who had his back toward him the entire time, suddenly turned around with a pair of cold eyes. And then, Jian Wushuang grinned at him.

That smile gave a sudden scare to the warrior in silver.

Damn.

As a Dark Silver Guard, years of experience told him that he had fallen into a trap.

Sure enough, Jian Wushuang directly fought back.

“Shua!”

A beautiful scarlet sword light blazed out and instantly confronted the Purple Soft Sword of the warrior in silver directly. However, in the next moment, that scarlet sword light disappeared like an unreal image. When it appeared again, the sword had arrived at his chest.

“What?” The warrior in silver was shocked. He was violently beaten back the first time.

The scarlet sword light flashed across his chest. His silver cape was torn and a long wound appeared on his chest.

“How powerful!” The warrior in silver was intimidated.

He was not good at face-to-face slaughtering, he was in the Profound Gold Core Realm at least. However, when he fought with Jian Wushuang, he felt that he had gone through Gate of Hell after just one encounter.

At this moment, the strength that was revealed by Jian Wushuang even horrified him.

He should have had the self-confidence to take Jian Wushuang as prey just now, with the purpose of taking that Golden-dragon Ring that was in his hand. But now it seemed…

Out of the two of them, who was the hunter, and who was the prey?

“You are a Dark Silver Guard, right?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.

“Huh?” The warrior in silver looked up at Jian Wushuang with astonishment. How could he know his identity?

“I have taken your Purple Soft Sword.” A grin spread over Jian Wushuang’s face. Then, as he moved, the Spiritual Power in his body broke out while sword essence violently rushed into sky simultaneously.

“Shua!”

As it stabbed, the sword shadow made people feel that it was slow, but in fact, its true speed was so fast that it was scary.

The fourth move of Formless Swordsmanship… A Hundred Variations!

The warrior in silver was scared and had intended to stop it, but that sword was too fast. When he just raised the Purple Soft Sword in his hand, that “slow” sword had appeared in front of his throat and then pierced his throat directly.

Jian Wushuang picked up the Purple Soft Sword from the warrior in silver, and looked at the engraving “9” on its Sword Hilt.

“Two Purple Soft Swords .” Jian Wushuang smiled, and then he checked the Ring of Heaven and Earth left by the man in silver.

“As expected, like that Dark Silver Guard from before, both of them had collected a lot of Golden-dragon Rings. This time, there are 16 in total, which means that he had killed 16 Golden-dragon Guards.” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

The true strength of these Dark Silver Guards was actually not frightening, but their ability of assassination was indeed so strong that people in the Profound Gold Core Realm might be directly killed if they were careless.

“Keep moving…”

Jian Wushuang continued to go further in the Innumerable Huge Mountains. Just like before, he stopped at each section of the road to find a Spirit Beast in the Initial Gold Core Realm and impetuously fight with them. He deliberately made it a big scene so he could attract the Dark Silver Guards that came on their own initiative.

But unfortunately, his luck seemed to have completely run out. Over the next three days, Jian Wushuang did not come across a third Dark Silver Guard.

In the Innumerable Huge Mountains, a breeze blew with a mild bloody odor.

“Be careful. Buck up,” a man said in a low voice. And a small team with a dozen people slowly moved ahead in the jungle. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Most of them in this small team looked pale, even some of their eyes were full of terror.

Suddenly, the grass in the front shook.

“Who is it?”

A sudden shout was raised, and all the people in the team looked over at the grass.

“Crash!” The grass then parted to two sides. A black-robed youth wearing a Long Sword slowly appeared in front of these people—it was Jian Wushuang.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked up at this small team of a dozen people without any astonishment in his eyes.

The Innumerable Huge Mountains were boundless. There were a lot of Nature Treasures and countless Spirit Beasts. It was a perfect place for Warriors to cultivate themselves, so it was common to encounter other people occasionally.

When seeing Jian Wushuang, the whole team felt nervous. But soon after, they perceived that Jian Wushuang was only a warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea, so they relaxed.

“Where does this reckless dude come from? Get out now!” the team’s leader, who had Birdeyes, immediately shouted.

“Someone in the Spiritual Sea Realm dares to adventure in the Innumerable Huge Mountains alone? You are really heading for death.” The rest of the team members also laughed at him, which lightened the tense atmosphere at that moment.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. He was not angry about their words, but their expressions attracted his attention.

“These people obviously feel some degree of fear,” Jian Wushuang thought.

“People who dare to adventure in the Innumerable Huge Mountains generally have experienced life and death, so it’s impossible for common things to make them feel scared. Unless…” Jian Wushuang glanced at their hands quickly, and there surely were four people whose wore Golden-dragon Rings on their fingers.
