“Captain Xiao,” addressed Jian Wushuang.

“Your Excellency, please don’t call me Captain Xiao. You can just call me Tiexin. Oh yes, I didn’t get your name,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“My name’s Jian Yi.” Jian Wushuang introduced his pseudonym.

“Mr. Jian Yi, what do you want to ask?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“I want to know what happened to that treasure Xiao clan had,” said Jian Wushuang in a deep voice.

“That treasure?” Xiao Tiexin pondered for a moment before saying, “In fact, that incident is no secret. I can tell you everything you want to know about it.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and was keen to hear about it.

“Our clan got that treasure not long ago. It is only a little more than twenty years ago. At that time, an Ultimate God Elder from our clan was engaged in a duel. Out of a sudden, the void around him shattered and a treasure flitted from the void which the elder then caught,” explained Xiao Tiexin.

“Around twenty years ago... Did you say it flitted from a broken void?” Jian Wushuang’s heart quivered.

It had only been a little more than 20 years since he was reborn in his current life. The timing seemed to coincide exactly as his Blood Mountain Sword was also a treasure descended from the Heavens.

“That treasure is a picture scroll. After the Elder got the picture scroll, he immediately took it back to the Xiao clan’s residence and studied it with other Xiao clan’s elders. Unfortunately, the picture scroll is very mysterious and weird that those elders failed miserably to open it up after exhausting every idea they had, hence they had no way to claim and meditate upon it. However, during their many attempts, one of the clan Elders discovered the picture scroll’s name was The Stately Painting!” Xiao Tiexin said.

Jian Wushuang remained calm.

It was no surprise that Xiao clan’s experts were unable to cultivate using the picture scroll. How could any ordinary individual claim ownership over such a precious treasure, especially when it’s indeed The Stately Panting? It was a treasure that belonged to the Seven Stars Black Sect after all. One would naturally be unable to unseal the picture scroll without first gaining ownership over it.

“Tiexin, what else do you know besides the picture scroll’s name?” Jian Wushuang asked. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“There is another message which I vividly remembered.” Xiao Tiexin paused before reciting, “The Stately Painting. The endless mountains and streams, dividing the world...”

Xiao Tiexin had just started the first half of the sentence when Jian Wushuang finished the remaining by saying, “Mountains and rivers were the palms and the land was the seal which created the world!”

“Mr. Jian Yi, do you know this message?” Xiao Tiexin looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Haha.” Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly. There was not much change in his expression, but his heart was deeply moved.

‘The Stately Printing is indeed mine!’ Jian Wushuang was overwhelmed with excitement.

He knew the Xiao clan had gotten hold of The Stately Painting but he was not sure if it was the genuine article.

He was now sure it was indeed the genuine article when he heard Xiao Tiexin’s words.

It was indeed The Stately Painting!

That was the most powerful treasure he had in his previous life and one of Seven Star Black Sect’s most powerful treasures!

‘I thought it would take a long time to recover The Stately Painting which went missing but I didn’t expect I would’ve found it so fast.” Jian Wushuang was stoked, but tried his very best to pull a straight face before continuing to ask, “What happened after that?”

“The events which happened later were widely known. The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord learned of the fact our Xiao clan acquired such a treasure and he has his heart set on it. Although neither our Xiao clan nor the Lord knew where the treasure came from, we’re certain it was an extremely high-level treasure of at least a Heavenly Treasure,” said Xiao Tiexin with anger flashing in her eyes.

“In fact, there are long-standing conflicts between our Xiao clan and the Lord. He has been wanting to take down our clan for a while now since our clan used to be a rather influential and prominent clan after all. Even though he’s a Territorial Lord, our presence still perturbed him. The Stately Painting was the last straw which broke the camel’s back.”

He attacked our Xiao clan without warning with his amazing feats of strength and decimated our clan in a very short time. No one else except I survived!”

Xiao Tiexin was trembling in anger.

Jian Wushuang was able to understand her feelings!

The hatred she had for someone who wiped her entire clan out must be unimaginable.

Jian Wushuang continued to ask after Xiao Tiexin simmered down a little, “Did the Territorial Lord get his hands on The Stately Painting in the end?”

Xiao Tiexin nodded, “Yes, he did. Not only The Stately Painting but also our clan’s wealth which had been accumulated over the years. Many treasures and resources have fallen into the despicable Territorial Lord’s hands. I’ve no idea if he managed to cultivate with the picture scroll or just gave it away.”

“An Earth Ultimate God like him will not be able to cultivate with the picture scroll.” Jian Wushuang firmly shook his head.

He knew for certain that even a remarkable Undying Saint would not be able to cultivate with The Stately Painting.

There were very few in the world who possessed the capability. Jian Wushuang was able to do so in his previous life with the help of his master. In addition, he had managed to claim ownership due to his Renegade Cultivation method.

‘I believe The Stately Painting is still with the Territorial Lord since this happened only about twenty years ago.’ Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly with his unprecedentedly chilly and sharp gaze.

He initially had no apparent conflict with the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

Although he thought of challenging the Territorial Lord to a duel and replace him, he was just thinking without any real intentions to realize it.

Besides, there were countless star territories in the Ancient God Domain. There were hundreds of star territories in a single domain with many domains in each. There was no need for him to target solely the Territorial Lord.

However, things had changed.

He had to do it now because The Stately Painting was in the Territorial Lord’s hand. In order to regain his treasure, Jian Wushuang must confront the Territorial Lord.

“The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is an Earth Ultimate God. I’ve no idea where his level of strength is among Earth Ultimate Gods. I might not be able to compete against him with my current strength and must find ways to improve myself as soon as possible. I’ll need a large number of Primordial Stones for that!”

Jian Wushuang tightly clenched his fists.
