Chapter 2991: Kill Without Mercy

——

“What did you say?”

The Blood Blade Island Master’s voice suddenly became excited. He looked at the thin and weak old man in surprise.

“Our people did say so,” the thin and weak old man said immediately.

“Divine Master? Are you sure he saw clearly that the extra Heaven-cleaving Alliance expert is just a Divine Master?” The Blood Blade Island Master said in disbelief.

“He’s very sure, but it’s also possible that that person intentionally concealed his aura, and our people can’t see through it,” the thin and weak elder said.

“It’s possible.” The Island Master nodded. “But no matter what, since we’ve already found Qin Dong’s location, for the sake of that huge bounty, regardless of whether the Heaven-cleaving Alliance person concealed his strength or not, we have to give it a try!”

“Pass down the order. Everyone set off immediately!”

With the order of the Blood Blade Island Master, the experts of the Blood Blade Island immediately moved.

…

In the void above the vast sea, Jian Wushuang and his group were still moving forward without any fear.

But at this moment… Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Dozens of figures rushed over at an extremely fast speed.

In the blink of an eye, they had arrived in front of Jian Wushuang and the others.

After the dozens of figures stopped, their powerful auras immediately pressed down on Jian Wushuang and the others.

Looking at the group of experts, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were still cold, but Qin Dong, Uncle Lei, and the guards of their team looked extremely gloomy.

“Blood Blade Island is one of the four overlords. The leader of the people of Blood Blade Island is Blood Blade Island Master!”

“My God, half of the 30 people are Immortal Saints. Even the Blood Blade Island Master came here personally. How can we resist such a lineup?”

“Blood Blade Island Master is said to be a True Saint at the peak of rank one.”

The guards were all filled with fear.

Uncle Lei and Qin Dong were also very nervous.

“Haha, the boy of the Qin family finally let me find you.” The Blood Blade Island Lord had a cold smile on his face and his voice shook the sky. He glanced at the people in front of him and when he saw Qin Dong, his eyes immediately lit up.

Of course, he also saw Jian Wushuang.

“Is this the expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?”

The Blood Blade Island Lord also took a careful look at Jian Wushuang. He looked left and right and finally came to a conclusion.

“Divine Master, he is indeed just a Divine Master.” The smile on the Blood Blade Island Master’s face grew wider.

“Uncle Lei, what should we do?” Qin Dong was so nervous that he was trembling.

“Don’t be anxious. Let’s look at the Heavenly Sword Marquis first. Since he is so confident, he must have some tricks up his sleeves. Maybe he can really stop the Blood Blade Island Master. As long as he can stop the Blood Blade Island Master for a moment, I can take you away, young master.” Uncle Lei said in a deep voice.

He was a Peak False Saint, and among the Peak False Saints, he was an extremely powerful existence.

As long as he did not meet a True Saint, he was not afraid at all.

Although there were more than a dozen Immortal Saints in front of him, the Blood Blade Island Master was the only True Saint expert.

If the Blood Blade Island Master was stopped by Jian Wushuang and could not free his hands, he was sure to take Qin Dong away.

Under everyone’s gaze, Jian Wushuang finally raised his eyes.

“I want to take this man away. Anyone who stands in my way will be killed without mercy!”

Jian Wushuang pointed at Qin Dong with one hand, and his cold voice came out of his mouth, wantonly spilling out in the vast sea.

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, not only the Blood Blade Island but also Qin Dong and the others were stunned.

They had never expected Jian Wushuang to say such words as soon as he opened his mouth.

He would kill anyone who stood in his way without mercy?

Was he not too domineering?

Do not forget, the people standing in front of him were all the top experts of Blood Blade Island. There were more than ten False Saints and a True Saint at the peak of rank one.

How could he dare to say that he would kill anyone who stood in his way?

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang shouted angrily again, his voice rolling like thunder.

“You’re courting death!”

The experts of Blood Blade Island were all furious.

They were not frightened by a mere Divine Master. In an instant, many figures burst out. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this scene, killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. “If you don’t get lost, you’ll die!”

Boom!

Jian Wushuang suddenly stepped on the void and shot out like a cannonball.

As he shot out, a large amount of golden divine power began to roll out from his body.

Seven star secret skill, divine punishment, and nine luminaries star armor had been used at the same time.

He slowly raised the longsword in his hand, and sword essence burst out.

Whoosh!

He directly slashed out.

This sword seemed calm, but in fact, the moment it was slashed out, it had already brought Jian Wushuang’s sword essence and the power of the 33,000-meter-tall boundless sword tree to the maximum, buzz, buzz, buzz. A large amount of space-time rules condensed together with the sword essence, forming one space-time blade after another.

Countless space-time blades fused with the sword essence.

Space-time rules and swordsmanship were perfectly combined!

Boom!

A huge storm rose out of thin air.

This storm was like the wrath of heaven and earth. After it swept out, it immediately set off a world-destroying tsunami on the surface of the sea.

It was the ninth move of the space-time swordsmanship, storm!

“This sword move!”

The experts of Blood Blade Island, who were full of killing intent and wanted to kill Jian Wushuang on the spot, changed their expressions when they saw the terrifying sword-edge storm.

Even the Master of Blood Blade Island was shocked.

Such a terrifying sword attack made his heart palpitate.

Buzz, buzz, buzz!

The huge blade storm covered all the experts of Blood Blade Island, and then endless sword essence burst out at the same time.

This power was extremely terrifying. Even if it covered all the experts of Blood Blade Island and faced more than 30 people at the same time, the power was not something an ordinary expert could withstand.

Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!

A large number of sounds that sounded like the tip of a sword entering one’s body rang out continuously, like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves.

In an instant, nearly half of the more than 30 experts of Blood Blade Island were killed on the spot. The weaker ones were killed on the spot.

Although the remaining people survived this sword blade storm, most of them suffered a portion of the power and did not feel good.

But at this moment…

“Be careful!”

A mournful roar suddenly sounded. A ghostly voice appeared behind a False Saint of Blood Blade Island at some point in time. Then, a sword light lit up.

The False Saint did not have time to react. The sword light had already passed through his neck, and his entire head was thrown away.

Whoosh!

A strange figure flashed and appeared next to the second False Saint. With the same sword attack, the second head was sent flying again.
