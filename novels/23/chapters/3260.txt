“The soul attack of the nine temples Saintess is widely recognized as the number one among the Immortal Saints. Now that she has a soul attack treasure...I’m afraid that Emperor Ming and Tie Ta are in trouble,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Indeed, after the Nine Temples Saintess took out her soul attack treasure, the expressions of Emperor Ming and Tie Ta had changed.

Especially the Underworld Emperor.

Although he was strong, his soul defense was not that great. The soul attack of the Nine Temples Saintess was enough to affect him, but now...

“Underworld Emperor, you asked for it!” The Nine Temples Saintess’ face was as cold as ice. Green light burst out from the green lamp between her eyebrows. This green light was extremely dense as if the energy in the sky was gathering crazily.

Buzz!

The dense green light finally gathered in the eyes of the Nine Temples Saintess, making her look like two giant green suns. Looking at these two ‘green suns’, everyone around the battlefield could feel the trembling of their souls, almost everyone could feel the trembling of their souls.

“It’s this move again!” Jian Wushuang, who was in the distance, also narrowed his eyes.

He knew this move. Nine Temples Saintess had once used it on him. It was her most powerful move.

Once, Nine Temples Saintess used this move to kill an Invincible Saint. At that time, she had not used her soul attack supreme treasure.

Now, with the addition of the soul attack supreme treasure, the two green suns became even more dazzling and terrifying.

And these two ‘green suns’ were targeted at the soul!

“Destroy!”

The Nine Temples Saintess gritted her teeth and spat out these two words. The two ‘green suns’ in her eyes instantly turned into two green arcs of light and shot toward the Underworld Emperor.

These two green arcs of light were too fast. Even the Underworld Emperor could not dodge them.

“Not good!”

The expression of the Underworld Emperor changed greatly. He immediately used his soul defense technique to the limit and tried his best to block these two green arcs of light.

In the end...with a bang, the Underworld Emperor’s body twitched slightly. His face turned pale and the aura on his body became weak.

However, although his aura was weak, it did not completely disappear.

Clearly, under this attack, the Underworld Emperor’s soul was severely injured, but it was not completely destroyed.

The Underworld Emperor raised his head again. His eyes were filled with anger when he looked at the Nine Temples Saintess, but at the same time, there was a trace of fear.

A serious injury to the soul was not a serious injury to the divine body. It only needed some god power to recover.

It was extremely difficult to recover from a serious injury to the soul. Moreover, the soul was the foundation of a cultivator. If the soul was damaged, it would have a huge impact on strength. At least for the current Underworld Emperor, with a serious injury to the soul...he could only display 60% of his current strength. It could be said that he was quite miserable.

As for Tie Ta, the Nine Temples Saintess did not use her strongest move to deal with him. After all, Tie Ta’s soul defense was indestructible and much stronger than the Underworld Emperor. She could severely injure the Underworld Emperor’s soul, however, it was very difficult to severely injure Tie Ta’s soul.

However, because of the soul attack treasure, the power of the three cyclopes who had been fighting tie ta all this time instantly rose to a whole new level, almost any one of the cyclops could fight with Tie Ta head-on. The three of them joined hands and suppressed Tie Ta to an extremely miserable state.

“Underworld Emperor, do you still dare to take the Blood Wave Token in my hand?” The Nine Temples Saintess stared at Underworld Emperor with a cold expression.

The expression on Underworld Emperor’s face was uncertain.

He had an incomparable desire for the Blood Wave Token, especially now that he only had three Blood Wave Tokens including the one in the Nine Temples Saintess’ hand. However, the Nine Temples Saintess’ methods could not help but make him afraid.

His soul was already heavily injured. If the Nine Temples Saintess used the same soul attack as before, his soul would be extremely weak. If the Nine Temples Saintess could use it a third time...his soul would be destroyed here.

“Nine Temples Saintess, you are ruthless. I underestimated you.” The Underworld Emperor’s voice was low. He then glanced at Tie Ta. “Brother Tie Ta, stop.”

Tie Ta immediately stopped and came to the side of the Underworld Emperor. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Hmph, at least the two of you are tactful.” The Nine Temples Saintess snorted. With a thought, the three cyclopes dissipated. At the same time, the green lamp between her brows slowly disappeared.

“The two of you, farewell.”

The Nine Temples Saintess said and directly flew to the side.

Emperor Ming and Tie Ta still stood there and had no intention of chasing after her.

However, just as Nine Temples Saintess was about to leave, she immediately stopped.

A figure had already blocked in front of Nine Temples Saintess.

This figure was Jian Wushuang, who had been watching the battle.

“Nine Temples Saintess, where are you going in such a hurry?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Nine Temples Saintess glanced at Jian Wushuang and smiled coldly. “If you could break my illusion from the beginning, you might be able to stop me from taking the Blood Wave Token. But now that the Blood Wave Token has fallen into my hands, even Emperor Ming and Tie Ta can’t do anything to me. What can you do?”

“You’re right. You have a soul attack treasure, which even Emperor Ming is afraid of. But unfortunately, your soul attack is useless to me. Emperor Ming and Tie Ta can’t take the Blood Wave Token from you, but I might be able to.” Jian Wushuang smiled strangely.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, are you trying to waste time?” Nine Temples Saintess did not take Jian Wushuang seriously at all.

“Waste time? I don’t think so. Nine Temples Saintess, if I’m not mistaken, you don’t have much divine power left, right?” Jian Wushuang stared at Nine Temples Saintess. “When you fought with Emperor Ming, you lost nearly 30% of your divine power after taking two blows from him. At the same time, you have to use your soul power to form three cyclopes to fight Tie Ta. These three cyclopes must have consumed a lot of your divine power.

“Most importantly, you used your soul attack supreme treasure to perform your most powerful move!”

After a pause, Jian Wushuang continued, “I don’t know how much divine power your most powerful move requires, but I do know that it takes a lot of divine power to use a supreme treasure.”

Supreme treasures were usually controlled by Principles Masters.

Although the Immortal Saint could use some of the power of a supreme treasure, it required a lot of divine power to activate it.

Jian Wushuang knew this very well. After all, he had the supreme treasure, ice-fire swimming dragon ruler, which consumed a lot of divine power to activate the ice-fire domain. However, Jian Wushuang was a perfect chaos god, so his divine power was boundless, naturally, he did not care.

But the Nine Temples Saintess was different.
