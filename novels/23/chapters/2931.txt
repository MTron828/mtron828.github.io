Chapter 2932: Approval

——

“Xue Dong King, Let’s fight again.”

Jian Wushuang laughed and suddenly waved his hand, causing streams of black light to appear in the void in front of him.

These streams of black light were 18 underworld blood divine swords with astonishing auras!

As soon as the 18 dark-blood divine swords appeared, under Jian Wushuang’s control, they immediately fused together perfectly at the fastest speed.

Buzz!

A faint humming sound, like the sound of a sword, slowly sounded in the world.

Although the sound was not loud, it was extremely strange. In an instant, it overshadowed the roar of the sea below.

In the void, a brand new black divine sword that was only two meters long but extremely wide appeared out of thin air.

The moment this two-meter-long black divine sword appeared… the world around it suddenly turned gray.

This gray-white seemed to have sunk into an endless sea of snow. There was a vast expanse of whiteness everywhere, and the only black color in this vast expanse of whiteness was the black divine sword in the center of the Void.

The black magic sword had become the sole focus of the world.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang spat out a word, and the black magic sword instantly turned into a bolt of lightning and shot toward the direction of Xue Dong King.

The black magic sword pierced through the void, but before it could get close, the violent sound of wind breaking caused Xue Dong King’s expression to change.

Xue Dong King did not have the time to think too much. He instantly brandished the long blade in his hand.

This long blade was like a river of stars hanging in the sky, forcefully tearing a path through the vast white world.

The void trembled.

In the blink of an eye, the black divine sword collided with Xue Dong King’s long blade.

The power of the fourth stage of the reincarnation sword formation, the world of ice and snow, also completely erupted at this moment.

Boom! Boom!

Xue Dong King felt his arm go slightly numb, and he immediately retreated. As for the black magic sword, although it was not far away, it only shook slightly before it continued to shoot out, at the same time, Jian Wushuang’s body also flew out in a strange manner.

Boom! Boom!

The black magic sword flew toward Xue Dong King again and again in an extremely tyrannical manner.

Jian Wushuang also displayed his swordsmanship, displaying it around Xue Dong King again and again. The speed of his swordsmanship was extremely fast, and the power was also extremely powerful.

With the combination of the two, Xue Dongwang was completely suppressed.

In just a moment…

“Stop, stop!” Xue Dong King hurriedly shouted to stop.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and stopped what he was doing.

Seeing this, Xue Dong King let out a sigh of relief. Then he looked at Jian Wushuang with a burning gaze, “It’s incredible that a Divine Master can be so powerful. Jian Yuan, I rarely admire you, but I have to admire you today. It’s amazing that a Divine Master can fight with me to this extent.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He knew that although Xue Dong King had asked him to stop, it did not mean that he had won.

He could see that Xue Dong King had held back. Some of his powerful secret skills and trump cards should not have been used.

If he went all out, his battle strength should be comparable to an ordinary first rank True Saint.

However, it was clear that although Xue Dong King liked to fight, he would not use his trump card to fight with others for no reason.

“Xue Dong King, I’m here to ask you something,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

He had already proven his strength, and it was obvious that Xue Dong King had approved of him. Therefore, Jian Wushuang could state his purpose of coming here directly.

“You must be asking about the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, right?” Xue Dong King looked at Jian Wushuang.

“You know?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He had come for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, but he had not told Xue Dong King before.

He had only told the Evergreen Realm Lord. Could it be that the Evergreen Realm Lord had sent him a message before?

“I don’t know, but I guessed it.” Xue Dong King smiled, “I, Xue Dong King, have a bad temper and don’t have a good relationship with people. Usually, those who come to see me have more or less asked for my help. But with your strength, you don’t need me to do anything for you. Besides, you’re only a Divine Master, but a Divine Master is so powerful. You’re a monster. A monster like you came to see me only because of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

“Indeed, I’m here for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.” Jian Wushuang nodded and admitted directly. “I’ve just arrived in the Inkstone Realm. I don’t know if there is a nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance around the Inkstone Realm, so I came to ask.”

“There is a nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance nearby.” Xue Dong King nodded slightly. “This nest is not too far from the Inkstone Realm. If you want to go, I can show you the way. However, not everyone can enter the nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Only the official members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance or you have a Heaven-cleaving token.”

“I have a Heaven-cleaving token.” Jian Wushuang took out his Heaven-cleaving token.

Seeing the Heaven-cleaving token, Xue Dong King raised his eyebrows.

“It’s easy with the Heaven-cleaving token. I can take you there directly. When do you plan to go?” Xue Dong King asked.

“Let’s go now.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay, let’s go. I haven’t been to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair for a long time. I don’t know if there are any missions suitable for me.” Xue Dong King smiled and led the way.

Jian Wushuang naturally followed.

On the way, Xue Dong King and Jian Wushuang chatted casually.

“Brother Jian, you’re a Divine Master, but your battle strength is so amazing. You should be very famous, but I’ve explored the surrounding territories of the Inkstone Realm, but I’ve never heard of your name. Why?” Xue Dong King asked.

“To tell you the truth, I don’t come from the border. My hometown is quite far from here, so of course, you don’t know,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Is that so?” Xue Dong King understood. “Since you have the Heaven-cleaving token, it should be easy for you to pass the assessment of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance with your strength. However, you still have to be careful. After all, everything is in case. The assessment of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is usually very harsh and even a little unusual.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xue Dong King was an official member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and had really participated in the assessment of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Since he said so, Jian Wushuang naturally would not be careless.

“By the way, brother Jian, when you arrive at the Heaven-cleaving Alliance later, before you participate in the assessment, someone will ask you if you have been recommended. When that time comes…” Xue Dong King had not finished his words.

Jian Wushuang said directly, “Xue Dong King, I’m sorry. Not long ago, I promised someone that I would treat him as a referral. That’s why he gave me the Heaven-cleaving token.”
