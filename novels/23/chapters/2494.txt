Chapter 2495: Crazy Old Man

The city was huge, hence Jian Wushuang’s soul power could only cover a small area and did not manage to find any aura of an Ultimate God expert.

“Strange Old Feng has a strange way with things. I’ve just inquired and it seems like he’s currently in a fighting arena,” said Yun Zhen.

Jian Wushuang got slightly excited before nodding and said, “A fighting arena? Lord Yun, I would like you to wait here while I’ll go meet him. If he’s willing to exchange the Purple Shimmer with me, it will save a lot of effort. If he’s not... I’ll have to ask you to fight alongside me and force him to hand it over with our overwhelming abilities.”

“No problem,” answered Yun Zhen very heartily.

Helping Jian Wushuang to obtain the second drop of Purple Shimmer was to honor their agreement, Yun Zhen naturally had to help.

Jian Wushuang entered the city and soon arrived at a gigantic fighting arena in the city center.

The arena was so wide and looked boundless enough to fit a million audiences. There was a big gymnasium in the center with two Chaotic Divine Demons engaging in an intense fight.

The fights in Luogu Territory’s fighting arenas did not stop until death occurred. It was insane as the fight would only end if one of the experts died.

It was because of that the fighting arena attracted a lot of experts to attend.

There were countless experts sitting around the gymnasium while shouting and growling in a frenzy.

Among them was one especially passionate person.

It was a dirty old man who was clad in torn black robes, incredibly messy hair, and dirt-covered body as if he was a beggar.

“Haha! My disciple, go! Kill him off!!”

Don’t mess around with him, just twist his head off!”

Press him down, press him down! Don’t make me lose face!”

The dirty old man’s voice was the loudest and most piercing one, making a lot of people look at him.

Jian Wushuang spotted the dirty old man immediately the moment he entered the fighting arena.

“Is he Strange Old Feng?”

Jian Wushuang squinted slightly. Judging from his looks and actions, the dirty old man did not look like an expert at all. However, Jian Wushuang’s senses were clearly telling him that among those cultivators in the arena, that dirty old man was the only one who possessed an incomparably strong aura. He was obviously an Ultimate God.

As for those two people fighting in the gymnasium, the one who was tall and muscular seemed like Strange Old Feng’s disciple.

“He sends his disciple to fight to his death in an arena. Doesn’t he worry about his disciple getting killed?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He could tell that Strange Old Feng’s disciple was only a Second-Class Divine Demon. His battle strength was normal and not considered strong. His opponent was also a Second-Class Divine Demon. At the moment, it was hard to predict who would survive the fight.

However, luck seemed to side with Strange Old Feng’s disciple as he narrowly won.

His opponent’s head was blasted open, but his shoulder was pierced through by a three-finger attack, leaving behind three bloody holes and a very pale face.

“Haha, you won! You won again!” Strange Old Feng was overjoyed and looked extremely crazy.

At one corner of the arena, the face of a chubby and greasy middle-aged man turned gloomy.

“Supervisor, this guy has won three games consecutively and those who lost to him are our resident Divine Demons. That crazy old fart who screams like a banshee is probably his master. He bet a lot of Ancient God Divine Powers on his disciple before every game. We’re suffering a big loss with just these three games,” said an assistant in black respectfully to the supervisor.

“How much did we lose?” asked the supervisor coldly.

“The crazy old fart bet a thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Powers during the first game. After he won, he bet another two thousand drops for the second game, then four thousand for the third. We’ve lost seven thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power to this crazy old man alone, and that doesn’t include the other bets,” said the assistant in black.

The supervisor was not happy. “Seven thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power. Doesn’t that equate to the entire savings of a lesser Peak Divine Demon? Watch them both, kill them right away as soon as they leave the arena. Bring back all the Ancient God Divine Powers which we lost and their Interspatial Ring.”

“Yes.” The assistant in black went on to oversee the arrangement immediately.

Running a huge fighting arena in one of Luogu Territory’s Nine Cities meant terrifyingly high profit.

However, the high profit did not just come from obvious gains. It also included some shady businesses in the dark.

For example, the seven thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power was enough of a reason to do said shady business.

Soon after, Strange Old Feng left the fighting arena with his disciple.

Not long after exiting the fighting area, on the streets...

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

More than 20 figures surrounded them.

“Master.”

The disciple was startled. He was only a Second-Class Divine Demon while those who appeared before them were Divine Demon experts. Among them, there were six Second-Class Divine Demons and a First-Class Divine Demon.

“Old fart, you’d better give up all the Ancient God Divine Power you have won and your Interspatial Rings, then we’ll let you live,” ordered the First-Class Divine Demon.

“Haha, isn’t it true that there’s no such thing as free lunch? However, you’re very foolish to rob me.” Strange Old Feng scoffed.

Whoosh!

His black figure flashed and disappeared.

A second later, he was back to where he stood.

The disciple looked around confused as he found around 20 people which included those six Second-Class and a First-Class Divine Demon collapsed together on the ground.

Their blood spilled everywhere.

The disciple was shocked at first but became overjoyed right after.

He knew that he had studied under the right teacher. His master was absolutely an earth-shattering super expert who was perhaps a Peak Divine Demon. No, probably even stronger!

“Let’s go kid,” said Strange Old Feng.

The disciple nodded and followed his master.

However, Strange Old Feng stopped once again after taking two steps.

“Hm?” Strange Old Feng raised his head and saw a young man carrying a sword on his back standing on the streets ahead with his arms crossed and walked toward them.

“There’s more of them?”

Strange Old Feng felt slightly surprised.

His soul power briefly scanned their surroundings but did not find another person’s existence.

Moreover, this person before him looked very young, but he could not see through him.

That surprised Strange Old Feng even more.

Finally, the young man went up to him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Greetings, Senior Feng.”

Jian Wushuang greeted humbly.
