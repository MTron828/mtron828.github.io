Chapter 2198 Days of Slumber

After the war was over, peace quickly returned to the Eternal Chaotic World.The various forces settled down as well.

They continued their normal daily activities.

The experts from the Special Tribes Alliance returned to the Special Tribes Territory and back into their own tribes.

King Luo Yu was the only one who stayed back and awaited Jian Wushuang’s awakeninv.

As for the Black Dragon Emperor, she was the leader of her clan. Even though she had feelings for Jian Wushaung, she could not stay and had to return to settle important matters within her own clan. She could only come and visit him occasionally.

It was a pity that Jian Wushuang remained asleep and did not awaken.

Time flew…

In the blink of an eye, seven thousand years passed.

The Eternal Chaotic World returned to normal. The cultivators here continued their failed lives: they continued to venture out for opportunities, sparring with others as the competition continued.

Within Wushuang City in the Green Fire World.

The fat Wang Yuan sat in the middle of an open patch of ground and drank his wine happily.

Whoosh!

A beautiful girl in black clothes suddenly appeared beside Wang Yuan.

“Congratulations on your breakthrough, Su Rou! You are the sixth almighty the Green Fire World has had.”

“What is there to congratulate about being the sixth almighty?” Su Rou said.

Green Fire World was a sanctuary filled with geniuses.

The cultivating conditions here were far superior, hence the rate of growth of numbers of experts was incredibly fast as well.

Before the battle against the Three Emperors World, the Green Fire World had only had one almighty: Jian Nantian. The other experts were only in the realm of sir god.

After merely seven thousand years after the Great War, five almighties had been born and Su Rou was one of them.

“Two of the few who broke through earlier than me have cultivated for less than twenty thousand years. How can I compare myself to them?” Su Rou smiled.

“They are different from us. They were only born after the cultivating conditions of the Green Fire World changed for the better. They have had a much bigger advantage since birth. How can you compare yourself to them?” Wang Yuan added.

“What about Jian Wushuang? He came from the same era as us,” Su Rou continued.

“Pfft! Are you alright Su Rou? Did you just try to compare yourself to him?” Wang Yuan choked on his alcohol when he heard what Su Rou said.

“That is true,” Su Rou said as she shrugged her shoulders.

Jian Wushuang indeed came from the same era as them and was like a brother to them.

His talent and potential was on another level.

“How can you be so free to be drinking here? Shouldn’t you be making the Ice Soul Elixir? Or has Jian Wushuang awakened from his slumber?” Su Rou asked.

“Jian Wushuang… He is still in deep slumber. I have no idea when he can awaken from his slumber. There is no hurry in making the Ice Soul Elixir as I have already made so much that there is some in reserve. It should suffice for a period of time,” Wang Yuan continued.

After Jian Wushuang fell into a deep slumber, Wang Yuan started to make Ice Soul Elixir at a crazy rate. He did not rest and gave it his all in making them.

Wang Yuan was talented in the area of alchemy. During the process of making the Ice Soul Elixir, his alchemy skills were constantly improving.

It became increasingly easy for him to make the Ice Soul Elixir as he was constantly making them at a crazy rate.

Now, he could make several Ice Soul Elixir every year. Given the incredible amount of time he had taken to make the elixir, there were sufficient reserves for Jian Wushuang for a period of time.

When the elixir was about to be used up, he would then continue to make the elixir.

Wang Yuan and Su Rou chatted casually.

Right then, Jian Nantian transmitted a message to them.

“Wait, Emperor Bai is here? Come, let’s head to the spiritual pool,” Wang Quan raised his eyebrows and said.

There were numerous guards constantly protecting the spiritual pool. They were led by Jian Wushuang’s servant, Jian Yi. This was to ensure that no one would get in the way of Jian Wushuang’s recovery.

Emperor Bai, Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, Su Rou and Hall Master Yuan stood in front of the Spiritual Pool.

Emperor Bai was looking at Jian Wushuang, who lay motionless and peaceful in the spiritual pool. A small amount of spiritual power swept towards Jian Wushuang as it was used to scan his consciousness sea.

This spiritual power was not destructive nor invasive. It simply scanned Jian Wushuang’s consciousness sea before dissipating.

“Emperor Bai, how is he?” Jian Nantian asked,

“If I’m not wrong, his soul has completely recovered,” Emperor Bai said.

“Recovered?” Jian Nantian was elated.

“Awesome!” Wang Yuan and Su Rou were all excited.

“Since his soul has completely recovered, why is he still asleep?” Su Rou asked.

“His soul will only fall into a deep slumber once it has been injured like never before. This state is extremely dangerous as any small accidents could cause him to remain in slumber for all eternity. Even though his soul has completely recovered, we never know when he will regain consciousness. It might take a year or two.”

“However, it might even take a hundred thousand years, or even a million.”

“Is that the case?” Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan and the rest turned pale.

They had underestimated how dangerous it was for one’s soul to fall into deep slumber.

The experts who were in deep slumber from the ancient past would have awakened long ago if all it took for an expert in slumber to awaken was for their soul to recover completely.

“Let us wait a little more. Continue to feed him the Ice Soul Elixir and let him remain within the Spiritual pool. Even though we do not know for sure when he will awaken, his soul power will definitely become much more powerful once he awakens. These things will only benefit him,” Emperor Bai said before he left.

Jian Nantian and the rest were disappointed. All they could do now was wait.

As time passed, the quality and quantity of the resources within the Green Fire World increased and became better. The cultivating atmosphere was also optimal, and hence numerous experts were born.

There were originally six almighties. Soon after, the seventh and eighth almighty came about.

In the ten thousand’s year Jian Wushuang was in slumber, there were a total of twelve almighties within the Green Fire World. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In the next one thousand years, there was another leap in numbers.

Within this one thousand years, there were a total of five new almighties. Among the five were two who had unique constitutions. They were very talented and it seemed likely that they could reach the Emperor God realm, or even the Great Emperor Realm.

During the same one thousand years, one man managed to break through to the realm of emperor god.

This man was Jian Nantian.

He was the second man to reach the emperor god realm, the first being Jian Wushuang. Everyone thought that it would take longer for him to break through into this realm. No one expected him to break through again within twenty thousand years.
