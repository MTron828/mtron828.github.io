Chapter 2459: Recruit Disciples

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the tomb, the remaining genius disciples no longer dared to ​​attack Jian Wushuang after witnessing the defeat of Huan Chen, Long Zishan, and the others.

They knew full well that they were incapable.

After all, there were less than 20 First-Class Divine Demons left in the tomb. Though there were still a large number of Second-Class Divine Demons, they were harmless to Jian Wushuang without a strong formation technique.

In turn, they began to leave the space, keeping out of Jian Wushuang’s way.

On the hill that had been stained with blood, Jian Wushuang sat there alone with his legs folded underneath him on the ground covered with potholes. No one dared to stay within the range of his soul power.

The continuous killing in the Saint’s Tomb had earned Jian Wushuang the killer and demon title.

No one dared to rub on the wrong way.

Right at that moment...

“Jian Wushuang.”

Elder Wujian sent him a message. With a trace of guilt, he related to Jian Wushuang the decision Narcissus Island made.

“So, they kicked me out of the sect?”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, but his complexion did not change much from beginning to end.

He was not surprised by the decision.

He knew he had wreaked havoc in the Saint’s Tomb after killing so many genius disciples and angered so many sects.

Narcissus Island was one of the top sects in the Wusha Wasteland. Then again, they were afraid to have a falling out with so many sects at once.

What was worse was he knew the higher-ups of Narcissus Island probably figured he did not have much sense of belonging to Narcissus Island.

That being the case, why would Narcissus Island risk offend so many sects to protect him?

Only by expelling him from the sect and allowing the various sects to deal with Jian Wushuang would Narcissus Island be able to stay out of the troubles.

Not only did Jian Wushuang not complain about Narcissus Island’s decision, he even thought that it was a good thing. Once again, he did not belong to any sect and would no longer be subjected to any restrictions.

“Jian Wushuang, Narcissus Island is wrong to do that, but...” Elder Wujian was feeling guilty.

Jian Wushuang interrupted. “Elder Wujian, I can understand this. I will not hate Narcissus Island for what has been decided. From now on, I no longer have any relationship with Narcissus Island. However, between you and I, we can still be friends.”

Elder Wujian was startled before slowly nodding.

“By the way, where are my parents?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Don’t worry. Although you are no longer a disciple of Narcissus Island, I can still do some things for you as an Elder of Narcissus Island. I can’t bring your parents to Narcissus Island, but I’ll definitely make sure that they are safe,” said Elder Wujian reassuringly.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

They soon ended the conversation and broke off contact. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Right then...

Hum! A faint black air current condensed in front of Jian Wushuang and a blurred figure slowly appeared in front of him.

The aura of the vague figure was unique. The figure was studying Jian Wushuang with interest through his strange-looking eyes.

“Old man, you finally show up?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head with a sword-light glowing in his eyes that instantly turned into a violent bolt of lightning, aiming directly at the blurred figure.

The blurred figure raised his hand slightly, grabbing the lightning with his bare hand and squeezed it. The shot of lightning burst in his hand.

“Young man, don’t be so grumpy. Let’s talk nicely.”

A faint laughter peal came out from the corner of the blurred figure’s mouth which sounded old.

“What’s there to talk between you and me?” Jian Wushuang was indifferent.

Although it was the first time that he saw that blurred figure, he knew the identity of the latter.

Crimson Stone Saint!

He was the owner of the tomb who remained in the tomb. He had been controlling the consciousness of Crimson Stone Saints.

Jian Wushuang had long speculated that Crimson Stone Saint’s consciousness was hiding somewhere in the tomb, secretly observing everything that happened.

The Crimson Stone Saint probably had already been eyeing him when he passed the eighth trial bridge’s test at the Abyss of Trials.

In the ensuing position token battles, three seat tokens appeared at the same time in an area with two of them delivered directly to him. Jian Wushuang knew there and then that it was a deliberate act of Crimson Stone Saint so that those genius disciples would attack him.

It led to the subsequent killings and madness which he had offended all the sects within Wusha Wilderness.

After Jian Wushuang crushed all threats in the tomb and proved his strength to those genius disciples, the Crimson Stone Saint finally appeared in front of him.

“Boy, you were born in Wusha Wilderness and I’ve done quite a fair bit in Wusha Wilderness. In any case, I am your senior. You don’t talk very nicely to an elder, do you?” Crimson Stone Saint commented.

“Sorry, I can’t be nice to someone who plots against me,” said Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Plot? I’ve just given you the position tokens which all of you yearned for. That was obviously a good intention. How can you say that I’ve plotted against you?” The Crimson Stone Saint gave a weak smile.

“I don’t have time to argue with you. Just tell me, what do you want from me now?” Jian Wushuang asked impatiently.

He obviously did not like Crimson Stone Saint.

“Well, I’ll be straight forward. It’s very simple. I see that you are extremely talented and have great potential, so I would like to take you as my personal disciple. I wonder if you would agree?” Crimson Stone Saint said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang was stirred as he said, “Take me as your personal disciple? Well, you ought to know that I am good with the swords.”

“Of course, I know. It’s not necessarily for disciples to follow the same path as their masters. I’m not proficient in sword techniques, but I have a good knowledge of the Space-time Law. I can teach you a lot,” said Crimson Stone Saint.

He was right, an Undying Saint expert must have known a lot of things.

Even if he was not good with sword principles, he was still qualified to teach the sword principle geniuses.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was not merely a genius.

He was simply a monster, a big monster.

Even Crimson Stone Saint had never come across such a terrifying monster in his life before.

That was why he wanted to take Jian Wushuang as his personal disciple.

He believed that he was not the only one. Many Undying Saint experts would not hesitate to take Jian Wushuang as their disciples if they saw Jian Wushuang’s capabilities with their own eyes.
