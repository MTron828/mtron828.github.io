Chapter 2805: Compromise!

(The first one is here!)

——

“In other words, do you want the four top forces to submit?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not only do you want them to submit, but you also need to make them pay a huge price and teach them a big lesson. You can squeeze their resources and the many territories and industries they control.”

“In addition, we have to restrict their experts. Coincidentally, there are too many experts who have fallen during the war in our Crimson Rock Castle, especially the Crimson Rock Legion. They don’t even have a commander at the level of a great divine master. Therefore, every force has to send some great divine masters to serve our Crimson Rock Castle so that we can allow them to continue living in the Pill Sun Sacred World,” Yin Su’er said coldly.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He already knew what Yin Su’er meant.

“Let’s go directly to the four top forces. The Divine Demon sect should be the weakest now, and the East God has been killed. In terms of battle strength, they are not much stronger than a first-rate force. However, they still have their heritage. How about we trouble Elder Tong of the Sword Union to visit the Divine Demon Sect?” Yin Su’er said.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

As for Elder Tong, he did not have any objections.

“Palace Master Nan Wu’s greatest reliance has also fallen. I guess Nan Wu Palace is now a pile of loose sand. Uncle Yun Shan, I’ll let you take some people to go there in person.” Yin Su’er said.

“Yes.” Yun Shan nodded slightly.

“The remaining life and death Tower and Dongfang family still have their strongest battle strength, and their overall strength is still well preserved. Therefore, you and I will go to them in person. But, which one do you choose, Mr. Jian Yi?” Yin Su’er looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Leave the life and death Tower to me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, in that case, let’s do it.”

After saying that, Yin Su’er and Yun Shan each led a group of experts to the Nangong and Dongfang families.

“Jue Xin, follow Elder Tong to the Divine Demon sect. As for the life and death Tower, I will go alone,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Alone?”

Elder Tong and Great Divine Master Jue Xin were stunned, but then they felt relieved.

They did not dare to underestimate Jian Wushuang’s strength alone.

Elder Tong, Great Divine Master Jue Xin, and the others immediately headed toward the Divine Demon sect.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, flew toward the nest of the Tower of life and death alone.

...

The Tower of life and death, as one of the top forces in the Pill Sun Continent, had accumulated an extraordinary foundation over countless years. Its nest was also magnificent and majestic.

It was a giant city, which was the lair of the Tower of life and death.

In the center of the city stood a towering tower that was hundreds of meters tall.

The tower was hundreds of stories tall and extremely magnificent.

Jian Wushuang appeared outside the giant city and looked down at everything inside the city through the heavy array around the city.

Then, a huge surge of divine power swept up and directly covered the giant city in front of him.

Rumble...

The divine power was so strong that it crushed everything. Even the array around the city seemed to tremble under the pressure of the divine power.

The experts of the life and death Tower in the city were immediately alarmed.

At the top of the towering Tower of life and death, the tower lord, whose eyes were slightly closed, immediately sensed something and couldn’t help but open his eyes.

“Tower Lord!” A senior great deity walked in anxiously.

“Are they here?” The Tower Lord’s voice was low as he asked, “Are they from Crimson Rock Castle or the Sword Union? How many are there?”

“There’s only one person,” the senior great deity said.

“One person?” The Tower Master’s expression changed.

“Although there’s only one person, this person, he, he is Sword One!” The senior great divine master said with a trace of shock.

The Tower Master could not help but be startled, but he also smiled bitterly.

“Let’s go and see Sword One together.” The Tower Master sighed and immediately stood up and rushed out of the city, accompanied by the great divine masters of the Tower of life and death.

Most of the great divine masters had participated in the previous battle and had witnessed Jian Wushuang defeating the allied forces of the four forces alone. Now, they followed the tower to the outside of the city, they were all shocked to see Jian Wushuang standing proudly in the void.

It was true that Jian Wushuang was the only one standing in front of them.

However, this one person had brought them unprecedented pressure. The pressure was so great that even if all the people of the life and death Tower worked together, they would not be able to withstand it. He alone could make the entire Tower of life and death suffocate.

Moreover, they all knew that Jian Wushuang carried several corpse puppets with him. There were even golden-armored corpse puppets.

“Greetings, Mr. Jian Yi,” the Tower Master said humbly. He stood in front of Jian Wushuang and bowed slightly.

“Tower Master, you should know the purpose of my trip, right?” Jian Wushuang stared at the Tower Master coldly.

“I know.” The Tower Master nodded, but his expression was a little sad.

“In a word, submit or die,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Mr. Jian Yi, the Tower of life and death is willing to submit and will follow the lead of Crimson Rock Castle from now on,” the life and death Tower Master said directly.

He had long been prepared to submit to Crimson Rock Castle.

Not only him but also the great divine masters behind him.

“Submission is not something that can be said with words,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“I don’t know what request Mr. Jian Yi has, but I can agree to anything that the life and death Tower can agree to,” the life and death Tower Master said.

“With your attitude, I can save a lot of time on this trip.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Listen, three conditions!”

“First, hand over 50,000 sacred elixirs.”

The first condition Jian Wushuang mentioned made the experts from the Tower of life and death gasp.

50,000 sacred elixirs?

The average first-grade divine master on the Danyang continent was only worth about 1,000 to 2,000 sacred elixirs.

50,000 sacred elixirs were too much.

“The Tower of life and death has such a deep foundation and has been recuperating for a long time. Unlike Crimson Rock Castle, which is constantly fighting among itself, it should have plenty of resources. You should be able to afford 50,000 sacred elixirs,” Jian Wushuang said.

“The Tower of life and death has agreed to provide 50,000 sacred elixirs, but they are too difficult to obtain. The Tower of life and death can not provide 50,000 ready-made sacred elixirs. At most, we can only provide 30,000 sacred elixirs. The rest can only be replaced with treasures or resources of equal value,” the Tower Master said directly, however, as he spoke, the corners of his mouth obviously twitched.

The Tower of life and death could indeed provide 50,000 sacred elixirs, but that was about 80% of the resources of the Tower of life and death.
