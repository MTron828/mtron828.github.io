Chapter 447: Blood Fire Ring

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Blood Fire Domain crumbled and Wu Ming felt like he was carrying a mountain on his back, moving as slowly as a snail.

Jian Wushuang shuttled through the air, straight towards Wu Ming. He quickly appeared in front of Wu Ming and launched a punch.

Wu Ming raised his Giant Axe and crazily fended against it.

Boom!

The heavy hit knocked Wu Ming’s Giant Axe away and Jian Wushuang’s fist continued on its path towards Wu Ming’s head.

Wu Ming’s head was smashed, instantly bringing about his death.

After killing Wu Ming, Jian Wushuang took both his Interspatial Ring and scarlet ring.

While holding the scarlet ring, Jian Wushuang used a drop of his blood to bind it. The next moment, he felt a rush of information surge into his mind.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Now he understood why the scarlet ring was able to display a Realm Technique.

The scarlet ring, called the Blood Fire Ring, was not a magic weapon because both the material and refining method used to create it were common. But it contained a Formation.

This formation allowed the Blood Fire Ring to simulate a Realm.

“Unique, strong, nice.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. With only a thought, the Blood Fire Domain swept out and began mixing with the boundless Blood River, causing the power of the Blood River to instantly skyrocket.

“Road to the Underworld, Hundredfold Realm, and the Blood Fire Ring. With such a strong combination, I’m afraid that even lords will be suppressed by it.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of excitement.

His battle strength had improved once again.

It was only due to luck that Jian Wushuang met Wu Ming on the way to the marquis’ cave mansion and acquired the Blood Fire Ring.

He continued on his way for another half day before finally arriving at the entrance to the cave mansion.

At a giant rift in the middle of a barren area, two mountains stood facing each other. On the mountains, there were two temporarily-built camps stationed, in which many experts had gathered.

Among the experts, the weakest was at Stage Three. Many were at the Peak of Stage Three and a few of them were even lords.

Jian Wushuang’s arrival at the Marquis Piaoxue campsite attracted a lot of attention.

“Is that …Master Swordsman?”

“It’s him!”

“He disappeared right after he killed Deng Huo two years ago. It seems like Swordsman has finally returned today.”

Inside a tent, Jian Wushuang greeted Spirit Lord, who was currently in charge this time.

As one of the Four Lords in charge of the Marquis Piaoxue camp’s business, Spirit Lord held a high status and many lords had to obey him.

“Swordsman, did you just return the Bei Mo Marquis cave mansion?” Spirit Lord looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“I expect you must have improved a lot since you remained there for over two years,” Spirit Lord said in a teasing manner, then he continued somewhat sternly, “Alright, no more nonsense. It’s good that you were able to arrive here in time. I will tell you some of the details about this cave mansion.”

“The cave mansion that lies beneath us is quite unusual!”

“Regardless of the inner layer, which is the battlefield of lords, the outer layer is a vast and boundless maze that contains many opportunities!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“The experts of our camp and the Marquis Cangyue camp have both searched through many areas in the outer layer over these last few days. But we haven’t explored it thoroughly. The two camps have fought many times over opportunities and treasures, but we have always been able to gain the upper hand.”

“I believe your arrival will increase our advantage even more.”

“Outer layer? Maze?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked, “Spirit Lord, do you have a map of the cave mansion?”

“Yes.” Spirit Lord nodded and proceeded to say, “Every two hours we update the map according to the searches currently taking place. As of now, the map is still incomplete, but something is better than nothing.”

At this point, Spirit Lord gave Jian Wushuang a map.

After taking a glance at it, Jian Wushuang understood the basic information.

“Both the inner layer and the outer layer are mazes? And it’s such a big mansion.” Jian Wushuang marveled at it.

The experts of both camps had explored the cave mansion every day since it had been found, but they still hadn’t completely explored it yet. Therefore, it’s easy to imagine how large it must be.

“When are you going inside?” Spirit Lord asked.

“Now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Be careful, there should be no danger for you as long as your luck isn’t bad,” said Spirit Lord.

Jian Wushuang nodded while thinking of a plan.

Jian Wushuang quickly arrived at the entrance of the cave mansion and directly entered without hesitation.

Nobody knew that there was a magnificent hall at the bottom of the cave mansion, nor did they know about the humongous ancient stone pillar that stood at the center of the hall.

A skinny elder sat cross-legged in the hall, so quietly that it seemed as if he was dead.

As soon as Jian Wushuang entered the cave mansion, the skinny elder suddenly raised his head, revealing a pair of eyes that seemed to glow.

“This aura...”

“Young master, it’s the young master’s aura!”

“Who? Who has come here?”

The skinny elder’s roar echoed throughout the hall.
