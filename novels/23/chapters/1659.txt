1660 Peng Huo“s Invitation

Real God Peng Huo was a top expert who was suspected to have fighting capabilities equivalent to experts in the Real God ranking list.

Not only were his abilities strong, his relations with other people and his popularity were also not too bad. Moreover, he also treated other people in a friendly way and was easy to approach. On top of that, he had never taken the initiative to provoke other people. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ever since he had become famous, after so many years, there was only news of other people making trouble for him and news of him taking the initiative to make trouble for others was unheard of.

Moreover, there was one more point and it was Real God Peng Huo not having much ambition. He was even unconcerned as to whether he would be able to become an Almighty. What he wanted was simply to live freely and comfortably.

Take the Eight Lairs as an example. With his abilities, he could absolutely travel in the Seventh Lair. However, he had always stayed in the Eighth Lair.

As he was an expert with strong abilities and a good reputation, Jian Wushuang respected him.

“Little friend, are you the one who killed the Three-Horned Star Demon behind you?” Real God Peng Huo asked.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“It was done by you alone?” Real God Peng Huo questioned closely.

Jian Wushuang nodded his head again.

“Haha, that’s great,” Real God Peng Huo laughed loudly and he looked at Jian Wushuang after that, “Little friend, I wish for you to help me with a matter. May I know if you are willing to do so?”

“What does Real God Peng Huo want me to do?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Please follow me. When we reach the place, you will know,” Real God Peng Huo said.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and he followed Real God Peng Huo to a faraway void immediately.

For Real God Peng Huo, Jian Wushuang only remained vigilant in the deepest part of his mind. Apart from that, he did not need to take too much precaution. After all, Real God Peng Huo had a good reputation.

Moreover, even if Real God Peng Huo were to really have other motives, Jian Wushuang would not be afraid.

Under Real God Peng Huo’s guidance, Jian Wushuang came to a black void after a short while.

“Little friend, look over there, in that direction,” Real God Peng Huo was pointing in a direction.

Jian Wushuang spread his Soul Power at once. After taking a look, his eyes shrank fiercely.

Within the detection range of his Soul Power, he detected the existence of two Star Demons. The two Star Demons were Grade Three Star Demons and they were together.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had realized that the two Three-Horned Star Demons within the detection range of his Soul Power were not the normal Black Star Demons. Instead, they were Green Star Demons!

They were two Three-Horned Green Star Demons. Furthermore, a portion of the skin of one of them was blood-red in color. It was obvious that that Three-Horned Green Star Demon had already begun to transform into a Crimson Star Demon.

“A normal Three-Horned Green Star Demon possesses the fighting capabilities of a top Chaotic Real God. As for the other Star Demon with a portion of its skin in a blood-red color… it is probably stronger than a top Chaotic Real God and it is extremely close to experts of the Real God ranking list. For these two kinds of Star Demons to be together…” Jian Wushuang clicked his tongue in admiration.

Previously, he had killed Grade Three Star Demons as well. Moreover, he had killed a total of two of them.

However, the Grade Three Star Demons that had he killed were both normal Black Star Demons which were equivalent to normal Chaotic Real Gods of the human beings and they were completely incomparable to the two Star Demons in front of him.

“Real God Peng Huo, could it be that you want me to team up with you to kill those two Star Demons?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“That’s right. That’s my plan,” Real God Peng Huo laughed.

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang forced a smile at once, “Real God Peng Huo, aren’t you thinking too highly of me? For those two Star Demons, I am unable to do anything against either of them. Even if I were to team up with you, wouldn’t it still be impossible to kill those two Star Demons?”

“Little friend, you need not worry. I have already fought with those two Star Demons just now and I have a clear understanding of their abilities. If those two Star Demons were to team up, even I would be unable to do anything against them. However, if we were to separate them and deal with them one by one, it would be much easier to handle them.” Real God Peng Huo continued to laugh, “Previously, I had been travelling around in this vicinity to find a top Chaotic Real God who I could team up with, and it just so happened that I saw you.”

“Little friend, I only wish for you to keep the Star Demon with slightly weaker abilities busy for a period of time so that I can use my full power to deal with the stronger Star Demon. As long as the stronger Star Demon is killed, it will naturally be easier to deal with the remaining one.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. He also knew what Real God Peng Huo wanted and his eyes turned toward the weaker Three-Horned Green Star Demon.

“This Three-Horned Star Demon has not begun to transform into a Crimson Star Demon yet. Hence, its abilities should be around a top Chaotic Real God. With my abilities, it will not be too difficult to keep it busy for a period of time. How about this? When we attack later on, I will keep the weaker Three-Horned Green Star Demon busy for fifteen minutes. After fifteen minutes, if you have yet to kill the stronger Star Demon, I will leave.”

“Haha, no problem. Also, I will not need fifteen minutes. Within one eighth of an hour, I will definitely kill the stronger Star Demon,” Real God Peng Huo laughed heartily. After that, with a flip of his hands, he took out a Black Force Core, “Little friend, I will not let you help me for free. Instead, I will reward you. For the rewards, it will be two normal Grade Three Demon Cores and I will give you one of them first. As for the remaining Grade Three Demon Core, I will give it to you after this matter is settled.”

Real God Peng Huo tossed the Black Force Core in his hands to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang extended his hand to receive it. When he used his Soul Power to check it, his eyes glowed brilliantly at once.

Real God Peng Huo was really generous. He only needed Jian Wushuang to keep the weaker Green Star Demon busy for a period of time and he would give Jian Wushuang two normal Grade Three Demon Cores as a reward.

It should be known that during the many years that Jian Wushuang had been in the Eighth Lair, he had only obtained a total of two Grade Three Demon Cores. Moreover, he had also used quite a bit of effort to obtain them.

However, this time around, he would obtain them easily.

“Let’s get started,” Real God Peng Huo said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

Their bodies then changed into two rays of flittering light and headed toward the positions of the two Star Demons at once.

When they were about to get close to the two Star Demons, the two Three-Horned Green Star Demons reacted instantly.

“Human cultivators!”

“Kill them!”

A great amount of destructive aura burst forth from the bodies of the two Star Demons instantly. The bodies of the two Star Demons then changed into green shadows and headed over with lightning speed.

“Little friend, I will leave the weaker Star Demon to you,” Real God Peng Huo glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“No problem,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. When his body turned vague, thousands upon thousands of shadows appeared at the same time straight away.

The great number of shadows then whizzed past the area and covered the weaker Three-Horned Green Star Demon completely.

“Oh? His comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine is not too bad,” Real God Peng Huo looked at Jian Wushuang with surprise. After that, his eyes turned grave.

Rumble~~~

A great amount of flames which could cover the sky appeared and changed into a giant sea of fire instantly. The sea of fire which was burning madly then came from all directions and formed a giant Flame Prison.
