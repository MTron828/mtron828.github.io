Chapter 1007: The First Sword Principle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The old senile has left, Governor. There is no longer any need for your friend to come.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Indeed. I’ve sent him a message.” The Dragon Wing Governor replied and eyed Jian Wushuang strangely, “Jian Wushuang… A-Are… are you truly of the Eternal Realm level?”

“About this… ” Jian Wushuang rubbed his nose awkwardly before he muttered, “Let’s have this conversation when we reach the city.”

“Agreed.” The Dragon Wing Governor assented with a nod.

With that, Jian Wushuang immediately set off for the Dragon Wing City with the Dragon Wing Governor.

Back at the Governor’s mansion of the Dragon Wing City, Jian Wushuang and the Dragon Wing Governor sat together and began their talk. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Unless I am very much mistaken, Jian Wushuang, you’re not a native of the Samsara Continent, no” The Dragon Wing Governor spoke with a thoughtful smile.

“Why do you think so?” Jian Wushuang asked with surprise.

“It would have been impossible for a person of your potential to remain unknown in the Samsara Continent. This would only mean that you must be from the outside of the Continent. You are a warrior from the Void Continent, I wager?” The Dragon Wing Governor hazarded a guess.

“You are quite perceptive, Master Governor.” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help grinning and admitted truthfully, “Indeed, I come from the Void Continent. I am here only to seek for the close kin of mine.”

“It is as I expected.” The Dragon Wing Governor remarked with a smile, “That is why I have been communicating with others to help you ascertain the matter. Jin Yu had spoken the truth. His failure of securing information about your kin would mean that your close kin could either have risen above Rank Seven; or, he might already be dead!”

“Then again, I daresay there is no way you would readily accept the second result. That leaves you with only one option: you will have to find a Rank Eight Reincarnator of the Samsara Temple.”

“Rank Eight Reincarnators are Dao Masters at the pinnacle of Rank Three. Even amongst the horde of warriors that throngs the Samsara Temple, there are but only a handful of warriors of such caliber. One would hardly expect to be able to even catch a glimpse of such elusive individuals. Even with my extensive influence, I am afraid I will not be able to help you in this errand. You have much to delve on your own from this point now.” The Dragon Wing Governor acknowledged his regret for his inability to assist Jian Wushuang.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded gently, then he said, “Nevertheless, there is no longer need for hurry since my father is not among the Reincarnators below Rank Seven. The large and wide Samsara Continent teems with numerous warriors. I can travel around while looking for him.”

Reincarnators of the Samsara Temple did not have to worry much about their own safety once they had reached the level of Rank Six. Rank-Seven Reincarnators were at an even higher level, which made it more difficult to kill them.

His father would surely be safe if he has surpassed Rank Seven. Thus, there would be hardly any need for haste.

“Where’re you going next?” The Dragon Wing Governor asked.

“Well… I did liberate the warrior slave from the gladiator’s arena who is of the Rock Demon Clan. I was once indebted to another great warrior of their clan. I intend to go there first.” Jian Wushuang said.

“When do you intend to set off?” The Governor pressed on.

“Now.” Jian Wushuang said.

“I see. In that case, I will delay you no longer.” The Governor smiled, waving his hand as he conjured two magical tokens, “Here are two tokens. One of them is my Message Token. Send word to me at need. I will do my utmost to have you as best I can.”

“The other token is the most detailed Star Map of the Samsara Continent available. Nine-tenths of the territories of the Samsara Continent is mapped upon it. I think it would be useful to you.”

“Thank you very much, Master Governor.” Jian Wushuang replied. He accepted gladly the two tokens and bid his farewell to the Dragon Wing Governor.

“I shall hope that we will be able to meet again, Master Governor.”

On the same day, Jian Wushuang began his journey to the bastion of the Rock Demon Clan with Qing Bin with him.

Gliding over the swards of a broad and wide plain, Jian Wushuang pored over the Star Map that was given to him by the Dragon Wing Governor.

“It is still a great distance between here and the region of the dwellings of the Rock Demon Clan. With hardly any usable wormholes on the Samsara Continent, we will have to traverse over the entire stretch on foot. Given our traveling speed, it’ll take Qing Bin and me at least five years to complete the journey.” Jian Wushuang murmured to himself.

Five years was hardly a long time for Jian Wushuang now.

“In the coming days, I will delve into the studies of Sword Principles during my journey.” Jian Wushuang said, smiling cheerfully. He cast a look to his companion behind him and beckoned, “Let us continue then, Qing Bin.”

“Yes, Master.” Qing Bin said, nodding with respect.

Together, they slowly glided towards the lands of the Rock Demon Clan.

And so their journey began. Jian Wushuang would often continue his studies on Sword Principles during their journey. For the past three years at the Governor’s mansion, he had greatly improved his grasp on swordsmanship. It would not be long until he created his own Sword Principle.

He was rapidly making good progress, devoting himself to intense research of Sword Principles with the 19 Sword Principles from the scroll as invaluable reference materials.

During the journey, Wushuang would occasionally stop to find a quiet place to meditate and assimilate the things that he learned.

There were times when he would join in with fights against other warriors when they stumbled upon duels or battles, using only his skills with the sword as a means of training by deliberately suppressing his might.

He would sometimes look for a place to sleep, where he would slumber for days or even months.

Thus, with the odd behaviors of Jian Wushuang making sporadic stops and delays during his journey, what was at first a five-year journey, had turned into a fifteen-year pilgrimage before he reached the lands of the Rock Demon Clan’s dwelling.

It was midnight, where the same blood-red moon he once saw shone eerily from the sky.

Jian Wushuang was practicing his skills with the sword alone in a forest.

The strokes he performed looked odd and peculiar.

Indeed, “peculiar” would be an apt way of describing him.

At times, his strokes were swift like lightning and yet at times, they seemed slow and frail before turning furious again like an angry serpent, intense and vicious.

The strokes he demonstrated were all similar in nature, yet they were displayed in various different styles, merged together as one unique Sword Principle.

The Principle was a bizarre amalgam of different styles and philosophy, a wild and audacious blend of differing Principles unified into one morbidly coalesced Sword Principle.

At length, Jian Wushuang finally stopped.

“My applause, Jian Wushuang. You’ve finally created the first Sword Principle of your own.” The Gu King’s approving voice came.

“Hahaha…” Jian Wushuang grinned brightly.

He had been studying extensively the 19 Sword Principles from the scroll and the acumen of creating the strongest Sword Principle.

He continued studying and buried himself in profound study and training.

At long last, after 15 years, he had finally created a Sword Principle of his own.

The Sword Principle might look crude and simple, it was, nonetheless, a beginning for him.

“What do you make of my newly-created Sword Principle, Gu King?” Jian Wushuang asked, beaming with delight.

“This Sword Principle… ” The Gu King’s voice faltered. After a moment’s hesitation, he continued, “Well… How can I say… It seems odd and peculiar.”
