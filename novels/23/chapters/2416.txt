Chapter 2417: Sword Principle Insights

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was a temporary shock and the nine disciples gradually calmed down.

However, the way they looked at Jian Wushuang was filled with envy with a hint of jealousy mixed in it!

Yes, it was jealousy!

There were nine trials left in Saint’s Tomb and each came with an enormous opportunity.

Those opportunities were something strongly desired by everyone, but the opportunity on the eighth trial bridge had been obtained by Jian Wushuang.

“It’s Junior Brother Wushuang’s own ability to live up to the challenges on the eighth trial bridge and receive the opportunity in it. It’s useless for us to feel envious.” Zhong Yi waved his hand and became composed again. “However, any of the trial bridges’ opportunities could make countless experts drool over it. It makes sense to assume that the opportunity Junior Brother Wushuang acquired is something many people are dying to have, so we should be extra careful from now on.”

The core disciples’ faces each turned serious upon hearing that.

“Yes, the sin falls not on the man, but the possession of the jade1.”

There were no guarantees that none would come to pursue after such a precious opportunity from the trial bridge out of greed.

“Fortunately, we arrived early at the inner area. Now that we’re here, the only ones around are us from Narcissus Island. So only we who witnessed the trial bridge’s collapse and knew that Junior Brother Wushuang was the one who broke through it. As long as we don’t say anything, the genius disciples from other sects wouldn’t come to pursue us even if they realized the trial bridge has vanished.”

“True.” All the core disciples’ eyes lit up.

It was only the tenth day since the opening of Saint’s Tomb.

At the moment, genius disciples from various sects probably just started moving towards the inner area, hence Narcissus Island disciples were the only ones there.

What happened a while back was naturally known only by Narcissus Island disciples and no one else.

“Let’s go somewhere else since we have tried out all the trials around and there is nothing in the abyss for us anymore,” said Zhong Yi.

Narcissus Island disciples immediately left the abyss and stopped at a corner of the inner area.

After that, it was uneventful as everyone was going about their own businesses.

Jian Wushuang sat down on a rock by himself, turning over his palm and took out a piece of jade slip.

The jade slip he took out was the sword principle insights left behind by Purple Blood Saint, which he obtained on the eighth trial bridge.

Purple Blood Saint was the peak expert among Undying Saints. He specialized in sword principles, hence his insights were extremely profound.

Jian Wushuang really looked forward to looking at the sword principle insights he had left behind.

“I hope the insights recorded by Purple Blood Saint don’t disappoint.”

After murmuring to himself, Jian Wushuang started browsing through the jade slip’s contents.

‘The Sword is the leader of all arms, emperor of all weapons!’

The Sword principles are the principles of offense and slaughter!’

The Sword... shatters the void on the other shore and witnesses all dimensions!’

One word of disagreement, unsheathe, and kill.’

No surrender, no cowardice, no tolerance!’

The only part that matters is the will to not look back and not hold back!’

This is the cultivation of The Sword!’

Only a few simple sentences, but it was enough to instantly make Jian Wushuang’s blood boil.

There was even an obscure sword essence within Jian Wushuang that was beyond his suppression, ready to take flight.

“Purple Blood Saint saw the sword essence, sword principles, and even sword cultivation. But, he went to the extreme because of that.” Jian Wushuang told himself.

He indeed went to the extreme. However, to be more accurate, sword cultivation itself was an extremist act.

One word of disagreement, unsheathe, and kill!

No surrender, no cowardice, no tolerance!

There was only the will of not looking and holding back!

That was extreme!

However, Jian Wushuang’s understanding of sword cultivation was different.

A great man to him is able to give and take. When it was time not to look back, he would do exactly that. However, when the time came to take a step back, he must do so as well. Only then, could one live longer and walk further in this merciless world!

As for Purple Blood Saint, he had seen the sword cultivation’s essence and truths, but he also understood the way of the world!

That was why he died.

Hence, becoming an Undying Saint was his final destination.

However, for Jian Wushuang who was the second Perfect Chaotic Creature in the world, he had his own mission. In addition, he was the only hope of that sealed off-world, so he absolutely could not die.

He had to go further and become stronger!

Hence, he could not agree with Purple Blood Saint’s sword cultivation way.

Of course, that was only his personal understanding and perception. Jian Wushuang had no obligation to take it to heart as every man has his own path.

What interested Jian Wushuang was Purple Blood Saint’s understanding of sword principles!

He continued reading.

Jian Wushuang quickly sunk into it.

Although Purple Blood Saint’s understanding of sword cultivation was rather extreme, his understanding of sword principles was also terrifyingly profound.

He had a very detailed explanation of every sword principle realm, the crucial points of every level, the way to break through them, and etc.

Sword principles proceeded from Insignificance to Introductory, Merit, Profound Achievement, and all the way to Completion! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After that, it was the Real Sword Principle Realm!

For Real Sword Principle Realm, according to Purple Blood Saint, there were three major levels.

The first level was Sword World!

Sword World required a very high level of understanding of sword principles. With the understanding, one could develop his own Sword World.

Which was to develop a world with one’s sword principles.

As soon as Sword World was completed, one could utilize it to suppress his opponents.

Practitioners who were on the same level, if one party had formed his Sword World and the other did not, the suppression from the Sword World could cut down their opponent’s ability by half. If both parties had comprehended sword principles, the party that did not form his Sword World would have almost no chance to fight back. However strong his sword skills were, as soon as the Sword World’s suppression began, any sword skill would almost immediately crumble.

Sword World was also the symbol of a Sword Principle Expert.

A practitioner who was good at sword principles could only be considered a true Sword Principle Expert after he had developed his own Sword World.

For example, Jian Wushuang who had achieved the Complete Sword Principle Realm but had not yet developed his Sword World could not be considered a Sword Principle Expert. He could only be considered a pretty good sword cultivator.

“Sword World..” Jian Wushuang squinted.

He recalled the fight to eliminate the Blood Emperor in his previous life. He fought side-by-side with Emperor Thirteen, the most terrifying sword cultivator he had encountered. The emperor displayed one of the forms from his Heaven Shaking Sword Principle.

That sword principle was also considered a Sword World.

However, Emperor Thirteen was purely performing the masterstroke form, totally different from the sword principle state that Purple Blood Saint had described in his insights.
