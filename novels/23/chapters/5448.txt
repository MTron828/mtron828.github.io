Chapter 5447 Meeting Xuan Yi Again!

Jian Wushuang initially thought that this ancient ship was already a part of the river of time and space, so he wasn't overly surprised.

However, Grandmaster was stunned. As the owner of this treasure, he had never known that, besides this reef, there was something else in this river.

Jian Wushuang, standing beside him, also sensed something unusual and noticed the change in Grandmaster's expression. He quickly stepped back.

"Little one!" An old man on the ancient boat, facing away from them, stood at the bow, his simple robe accentuating his somewhat frail figure.

This voice?

Jian Wushuang, upon hearing the voice, revealed a shocked expression. He was too familiar with this voice.

"Is it you? Master Xuan Yi!" Jian Wushuang could hardly believe it.

Grandmaster was also stunned.

That figure!

He was familiar with it, despite only having ten days of contact. He remembered it for a lifetime. From the mundane to the peak, he had never forgotten his benefactor, his mentor.

A game of chess that benefited him for a lifetime.

A supreme treasure that propelled him to the peak.

Jian Wushuang seemed to understand. The ancient one was indeed Master Xuan Yi, and today's meeting had probably been planned since ancient times.

Neither Zhen Ling nor Shen Ling knew. A great being was also plotting in this place.

Thud!

The First True King of the Three Kings Court, Grandmaster, knelt directly on the ground, respectfully bowing to the old man on the ancient boat.

"Master Xuan Yi!" Jian Wushuang also bowed.

The old man on the ancient boat turned slowly, revealing that familiar face, elegant and refined.

"Don't be surprised. This is just one of my spiritual incarnations. My true self is not in this time and space. I left this chessboard in the Moro space-time, waiting for today. It seems you are indeed the chosen one!" Master Xuan Yi's words left Jian Wushuang somewhat puzzled. The chosen one, a plan from ancient times?Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

Kneeling on the ground, Grandmaster dared not lift his head, prostrating himself with deep respect.

Jian Wushuang harbored many questions in his heart, eager to ask, yet unsure where to begin.

"Everything, when you encounter my true form, you will understand. This chessboard is the only treasure I left in this place, originally prepared for you!" Xuan Yi spoke calmly.

Everything!

From nurturing him since childhood to another cycle.

Jian Wushuang took in a sharp breath, feeling somewhat dazed.

Recollections of various events flooded his mind.

The imposing figure and the past incidents.

Now everything seemed to be clear.

In the end, he was just a pawn.

However, it was mutual; he needed treasures to enhance himself, and others needed him as a potentially powerful pawn.

This chessboard was remarkable!

It represented everything.

"Master Xuan Yi, where should I go to find you?" Jian Wushuang couldn't help but ask.

"I am no longer within the space. If you wish to find me, let time pursue me!"

With these words, Xuan Yi left, and the ancient ship began to faintly disappear.

Jian Wushuang felt a sense of reluctance. Though he was a pawn, he never forgot the great favor bestowed upon him.

Seeing Xuan Yi vanish, a mix of emotions stirred within him.

There was bitterness, driven by the dissatisfaction of his weak strength, the gap between him and the strong. To bridge it, he had to become stronger.

A sense of sorrow lingered in his heart-a feeling tied to past memories.

Since his strength had grown and his position elevated, he had distanced himself from emotions.

He no longer distinguished right from wrong, only weighing the pros and cons, adhering to the path of the king-the way of the strong. However, over the years, he found himself somewhat repelled by his own actions.

Perhaps it was time for a change.

Gratitude was gratitude, emotions were emotions; everything had to be compartmentalized.

Time!

It could change everything, but it couldn't alter the obsession deep within Jian Wushuang's heart-the path of the strong.

If time were to be measured, he didn't wish to encounter Xuan Yi at the endpoint but rather preferred a passing encounter midway.

"Gone already!" Jian Wushuang sighed and looked down at the once-kneeling First True King.

To his surprise, the opponent had already lost consciousness. The Grandmaster who knelt on the ground had become an empty shell.

It seemed he had been taken away by Teacher Xuan Yi or perished on his own. For someone already fallen, his departure was inconsequential.

Now, only he remained, an unprecedented tranquility enveloping him.

Seated cross-legged in the pavilion, he closed his eyes to rejuvenate.

Within his Origin Source, a chessboard appeared.

"Skysight Heavenly Chessboard!"

In the center of the miniature chessboard, above the river of time and space, were three large characters-Skysight Heavenly Chessboard.

Numerous chess pieces had been placed on this miniature board.

Among them was a piece quite similar to Jian Wushuang, formed by a Sword Qi, containing the essence of the Ultimate Sword Dao.

This delighted Jian Wushuang.

Attempting to join in, he found that he couldn't interact with it.

"It should be because I don't have control!" Jian Wushuang realized.

Although he held the chessboard, it was another matter to use it. As a Dao Lord, it was challenging to drive the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard.

He couldn't even use the pieces on it.

Apart from the Sword Dao, there were other chess pieces.

Choosing one with the weakest aura, though not the

Ultimate Dao, it contained a profound earth and wood essence.

Swish!

Upon contact, he involuntarily entered into the chess piece.

Inside the chess piece, as he comprehended the Dao of earth and wood, the power of insight increased 1,000-fold, even allowing him to control some of the Origin Source within.

These chess pieces contained myriad things and Daos. If each one could be entered, wouldn't that be a great fortune?

The breakthrough to the Extreme Dao was right in front of him.

If he hadn't thought of what the First True King had said, that this place would collapse into spatial turbulence, he would have wanted to cultivate right here until the Extreme Dao was perfected.

"Still, it's better to leave first!"

Jian Wushuang's avatar entered the chess piece for comprehension. At the same time, he released countless mental forces, probing each chess piece. In the end, he truly entered a few of them.

He couldn't enter the extremely powerful ones, but he could enter the weaker ones to enhance his other Origin Sources.

This chessboard was simply a treasure for cultivation.

Besides this point, the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard had an even more powerful function.

However, his current strength was too weak, and he couldn't comprehend its mysteries.

To use it, he needed to become an Emperor at least.

For now, he could only look with envy.

He remembered the move Grandmaster used to accelerate time just now, which was simply unimaginable.

If used in battle against enemies, this move could probably instantly reverse the situation.

Whew!

Jian Wushuang slowly stood up. With a thought, he left this place.

The Skysight Heavenly Chessboard gradually disappeared, without Jian Wushuang needing to collect it. It returned to the Origin Source on its own.

Returning to the hall, it was exceptionally quiet at this moment.

Before he could react, he suddenly rose, and before his eyes turned black, he vaguely saw many figures standing in front of him.

Crack!

Jian Wushuang felt his arms extremely heavy, and his movements were stiff. His soul had merged with physical flesh.

This time, he had completely recovered. After the soul entered the flesh, this situation would occur.

After he fully recovered, a white jade scroll also entered his mind.
