Chapter 495: Cause of Death

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Dragon King Arrow had only pierced the phantom Su Ming created, so it did not hurt him.

The combination of swordsmanship and illusion formed the Illusory Sword Principle that Su Ming comprehended.

Blind Emperor saw through it, so he knew where the real Su Ming was hiding.

Su Ming turned pale. He barely deflected the attack and immediately drew back.

After regaining his balance, Su Ming looked at Blind Emperor with a flicker of coldness in his eyes. “Blind man, it’s been a long time since we last met. Your strength has improved greatly. I knew that you had been studying Heart Sword Principle. It seems that you have finally achieved something.”

“I’m blind, but my heart is not. Your illusion is useless against me. As long as I’m here, you won’t be able to hurt this boy,” Blind Emperor said indifferently.

Su Ming’s face fell.

His Illusory Sword Principle did not work against those who possessed a strong mind.

The Heart Sword Principle focused on one’s heart and could counteract the effect from the Illusory Sword Principle.

Therefore, Su Ming could not find an opportunity to kill the boy.

“Blind man, you really think you can stop me?” Su Ming coldly looked at Blind Emperor.

“Nonsense,” Blind Emperor said in a low tone.

“Well.”

Su Ming wore cold expressions as his eyes blazed with fury, but he remained silent for a while. As his lips tilted upwards slightly at the corners, he gave a wicked smile and said, “Blind man, you think that because you’re here I can’t kill this boy?”

Blind Emperor had an indifferent expression.

“Haha, hahaha...”

Su Ming broke into demented laughter. After a while, he calmed down and looked at his opponents with a cold expression.

“I didn’t want to, but you’ve forced me to do it!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang had a bad feeling.

“Su Ming, what are you going to do?” Blind Emperor spoke in a cold voice.

“What shall I do? Haha...”

Su Ming said with a big laugh, “Old man, thousands of years ago, Sword Ancestor died and his Bloodline collapsed. You, one of the seven Sword Emperors, narrowly escaped, but you still don’t know the cause of that fight, right?”

Blind Emperor was shocked. He began shivering.

Thousands of years ago, the fight started suddenly and ended quickly.

The Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor was so powerful that no one dared to piss them off. Even the other Three Ancestors held them in awe. However, a fight erupted, causing Sword Ancestor to die and his Bloodline to collapse within a day. Other than Blind Emperor, the other six Sword Emperors had all been killed.

It had been an absolute nightmare for Blind Emperor.

Thousands of years had passed, but Blind Emperor still knew nothing about the cause of the fight.

He was not clear on why it started and why Sword Ancestor died.

He had not found the answer even now.

“Su Ming, what do you mean?” Blind Emperor said in a tremulous tone.

Su Ming said with a grim smile, casting his gaze on Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, if I guessed right, you’re a descendant from the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor, right?

“When you came to Sword-suppression Valley, I knew because you had the Triple-kill Sword.

“The Triple-kill Sword is a token of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor. It was modeled after the Heart-killing Sword. The Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor refined five Triple-kill Swords and gave them to five personal disciples. I’m one of the five, so I also have one.”

Then Su Ming turned his hand over and a longsword appeared. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This sword was the same as Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword and Blind Emperor’s longsword.

“You not only have the Triple-kill Sword, but you have also mastered many Sword Skills from the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor, such as Mind’s Eye Sword Technique and Multifold Realm, which was famous because of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor. In addition, you know how to perform the Heart-killing Sword Technique.” Su Ming sneered.

As Sword Ancestor’s personal disciple, Su Ming remembered all nine moves of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, so he knew it well.

He recognized it when Jian Wushuang performed Heart-killing Sword Technique.

“I’m the descendant of Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor. So what?” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.

Since Su Ming knew it, Jian Wushuang admitted his identity openly.

Su Ming sneered. “It doesn’t matter that you’re the descendant of Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor, but you’ve mastered the Heart-killing Sword Technique. That’s different.

“Both of us have grasped the Heart-killing Sword Technique, so you must know how marvelous the Sword Skill is. We can keep this skill in mind and freely perform it, but we can’t teach it to others.

“Sword Ancestor’s personal disciples, who mastered the Heart-killing Sword Technique, can’t teach it to anyone.

“You mastered this skill after the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor collapsed. There’s only one possibility. You found the location of the cave mansion Sword Ancestor left and you’ve been there!”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly and his grim sense of foreboding continued to increase.

Su Ming continued, “Hey hey, blind man, don’t you want to know how the old guy died? I’ll tell you now. He died because he had something related to a big secret!

“This secret is so big that all the other experts who were as strong as him would pay any price to acquire it.

“Sometimes, just possessing a treasure is enough to cause trouble for its owner!

“Because of that thing, he died. However, the old guy was clever and hid it in his cave mansion. As we all know, the mansion’s location remains a mystery.

“The experts who killed the old guy searched the whole Divine Land, but they could not find the cave mansion. But now... if they received the news that Jian Wushuang knows its location and has practiced the Heart-killing Sword Technique in there, say, what would they do?”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s and Blind Emperor’s faces fell.
