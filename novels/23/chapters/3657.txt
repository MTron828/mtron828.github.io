Chapter 3662: The Original Universe

“Double my power?” Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“For example, although I’m only a Principles Master, my divine power is no weaker than that of an ordinary primary Ruler because of my perfect life level. If I use my secret skill and heaven-cleaving skill, my divine power will be three times stronger than that of a primary Ruler!”

“But now, with the power of the will given by the universal principles, my divine power will be twice as strong as that of a primary Ruler, which is six times stronger than that of a senior Ruler,” Jian Wushuang said.

The difference in divine power between a primary Ruler and a senior Ruler was not too big. Previously, Jian Wushuang could release three times the power of a primary Ruler, which was close to that of a senior Ruler.

However, the power of the will given by the universal principles could double his divine power, which was equivalent to six times the power of a primary Ruler. Among senior Rulers, this divine power was indeed very powerful, it was indeed very powerful.

“Yes, it is indeed the power of the will given by the universal principles. It is much stronger than ordinary will power,” Xuan Yi said with a smile.

“Yes, it’s very strong. Moreover, the power of the will is changed according to my own divine power. In other words, as my strength increases, the power of the divine power will continue to increase. However, the power of the will will not weaken my overall strength at all,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“What about the power of the will? Did the universal principles give you anything else?” Xuan Yi looked at him again.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily. “In addition to the power of the will, the universal principles also gave me a unique secret skill. To be exact, it’s an innate divine power.”

“Innate divine power?” Xuan Yi’s eyes lit up and he smiled. “It’s indeed an innate divine power.”

“Master, you’ve guessed it?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“It’s not a guess. When I was adventuring in the three battlefields, I entered a Secret Realm by chance and obtained part of the memory of an ancient supreme-being in that Secret Realm. In that part of the memory, there were some things about the arrival of the universal principles.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After a pause…Xuan Yi continued, “In the vast universe, the universal principles rarely descend. However, as long as it descends and descends on a certain cultivator, that cultivator will receive enormous benefits. Most of the time, the universal principles will bestow a unique innate divine ability to the other party. This innate divine ability is also based on the special conditions that the cultivator has reached.”

“For example, now that you have refined a Heaven and Earth Secret Realm that is comparable to a small astral world, the innate divine power bestowed upon you by the universal principles must have a lot to do with this small astral world.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “The innate divine power bestowed upon me by the universal principles is called the original universe. It uses the small astral world that I have refined as the core to form the original universe that covers everything around it. In this original universe, my strength will be greatly enhanced.”

“However, there is a limit to the use of this innate divine power. It can only be used once every 12 hours, which means that it can only be used once a day. Each time it is used, it can only last for 10 breaths at most.”

After being bestowed by the universal principles, Jian Wushuang already had a certain understanding of this innate divine power that he had obtained.

The original universe was undoubtedly an extremely powerful innate divine power. However, because it was powerful, it had many limitations.

“There are some limitations to any innate divine power, let alone an innate divine power given by the universal principles. Although your innate divine power is powerful, the universal principles will not allow you to use it without restraint,” Xuan Yi said.

“That’s right.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“In any case, you’ve earned a lot from the arrival of the universal principles,” Xuan Yi said.

“It’s all thanks to my master.” Jian Wushuang was extremely grateful.

Indeed, Xuan Yi had specially prepared this small astral world for him.

And the universal principles had come because he had refined this small astral world into his own Secret Realm.

In other words, the arrival of the universal principles, including the bestowment, was largely thanks to his master.

“I’m already dead. The only thing I can do now is to give you as many opportunities as possible. But there’s really not much I can give you now. Other than this small astral world, the only thing I have left is the heaven-suppression tablet!”

“However, the heaven-suppression tablet is an ultimate treasure that is superior to the most powerful supreme treasure. Even a supreme expert might be envious of such a treasure. Although I got one, it took me a long time and effort to refine it. I can’t help you with the refinement of the heaven-suppression tablet. You can only work hard on it yourself,” Xuan Yi said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Well, you’ve already refined this small astral world. I’ve given you everything I can, so there’s no need for my remnant soul to exist. Little guy, you’re the only hope in the Divine Beginning Realm. I’ve prepared so much for you, so you must succeed in the last step.”

Xuan Yi took a deep look at Jian Wushuang, but his body had already begun to slowly disappear.

“Farewell, Master!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold as he watched his master’s last remnant soul disappear. Although there was grief in his heart, it was more of determination.

He knew that his master had given him too much, and he could not repay his great kindness.

The only thing he could do to make his master rest in peace was to complete what his master had failed to do in the past and take back the Divine Beginning Realm from the hands of the Star Master!

He had to reach that step.

Finally, Xuan Yi’s figure disappeared completely, but Jian Wushuang still stood there. He looked at the place where his master had disappeared and exhaled heavily after a long while.

“Since I’ve refined the seal formation, the Seven Star Divine Realm in the seal formation will naturally be under my control.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly and moved his mind, in an instant, he saw the entire Seven Star Divine Realm through the will of the Heavenly Dao that was automatically nurtured in the small astral world.

“As expected, the evolution process of the Seven Star Divine Realm is completely modeled after the universe,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The Seven Star Divine Realm used to be a complete continent in the Divine Beginning Realm, but now it was completely different.
