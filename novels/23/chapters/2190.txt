Chapter 2191 Last Hi

Back in the Ancient Past, Blood Emperor was one of the top-tier experts. Even though he could not be compared to a man like Emperor Thirteen, he had still heard of the techniques Emperor Thirteen had.Emperor Thirteen had created three strongest sword skills. World of Swords was the weakest among them.

Even this weakest sword skill could have severely injured or even killed him back in the ancient past.

The legendary World of Sword had everything inside: mountains, seas and forests made up of swords.

However, the World of Swords that Emperor Thirteen had cast only barely formed an incomplete sea of swords.

“Haha!!!”

Blood Emperor laughed crazily. “Mountain River Map, the seventh seal of the Nine province seal together with the World of Sword…”

“Haha. Come!!”

“Why would I be afraid?”

Blood Emperor looked like he had turned crazy under the suppression of the seventh seal and the surrounding sea of swords.

Blood Emperor felt that his life was in danger when targeted by the seventh seal.

It was as though in the next moment he was about to be crushed into nothing by the seventh seal.

However, the Blood Emperor was not afraid at all!

He was the emperor of the Blood Clan and had been one of the top-tier experts back in the ancient past. He had been through the Great Battle of the Ancient Past and survived. What could be more dangerous and terrifying than that battle itself?

“Taboo secret skill, Blood Slash!!”

“First slash!”

Blood Emperor’s voice boomed as the divine power around him boiled and roared.

Blood Emperor shuddered as his face turned pale.

“Second slash!”

His voice could be heard again as the surrounding sea of crimson red split apart.

The spirits and skeletons under the sea of crimson red crumbled.

Blood Emperor felt something get stuck in his throat, before he spouted out blood.

“Third slash!!”

Boom~~~ Heaven and Earth froze for a second. Blood Emperor was covered in blood.

One of his army exploded and turned into a mist of blood.

“Blood Clan Taboo secret skill?” Emperor Thirteen’s irises constricted with shock.

Even though Blood Emperor looked like he was severely injured, Emperor thirteen clearly knew he was not.

Blood Emperor was in that state due to the price he had to pay to cast the taboo secret skill.

Even though the cost was huge, Blood Emperor had turned even stronger.

“Opposing Blood Formation, form!!”

Under the influence of the taboo secret skill, Blood Emperor, who was in the Divine Demon Realm, had turned even stronger. His terrifying aura had become twice as powerful.

The Opposing Blood Formation that encompassed the entire Three Emperors World started to run.

A limitless amount of blood qi gathered in front of the Blood Emperor and formed a crimson shield.

This shield looked as though it could not be destroyed!!

“Haha, come!!”

Blood Emperor laughed crazily. He stood behind the large shield as a gigantic crimson exotic beast rose and roared.

High up in the air, the province formed from the seventh seal came down with incredible might.

It collided with the crimson red shield.

Boom~~~ Large amounts of momentum gushed out in all directions.

The seventh seal…

Jian Wushuang gave all he had, crumbling nine ancient god stars and even casting soul ignition to bet on this one attack.

This was Jian Wushuang’s last attack.

After this attack, he would definitely die.

Blood Emperor had paid a heavy price by casting the taboo secret skill just to defend against the seventh seal.

He knew that this was the last attack by Jian Wushuang.

This was the last chance for Jian Wushuang to kill him.

As long as Blood Emperor survived the attack, he could return back to his prime with the help of the Opposing Blood Formation.

The plan he had carefully planned for a long time could continue. No one could stop him.

“He must die!”

Jian Wushuang had gone crazy long ago.

As soul ignition continued, his consciousness slowly started to fade as he turned into a mad demon. He would die eventually as all living energy would be sucked out of him.

He told himself he had a mission, and he had to complete it before he died.

That was to kill Blood Emperor!

The Eternal Chaotic World would only be safe if he died.

That was his hometown. His friends and families were there.

He could not afford to fail!

“I carefully schemed for so many years and finally got to where I am today. How can I lose to a mere Chaotic Realm scum? No, that will not happen. That cannot happen. I will not die!” Blood Emperor was equally crazy.

Jian Wushuang had his reason to kill the Blood Emperor.

Blood Emperor also had his reasons to live.

Both of them fought head on.

Who would live? Who would die?

Or would both of them die?

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World held their breath as they saw this scene unfold before their eyes. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They saw the majestic province crashing into the crimson shield.

These two terrifying and devastating forces were fighting against each other.

At that moment, everyone clenched their firsts.

“Kill him! He must die!”

“Sword Emperor, our fate lies in your hands!”

“The Sword Emperor has never disappointed us. This time, he too will not disappoint us!”

These were thoughts that were screaming in the minds of the experts.

They knew that Jian Wushuang was their last hope.

This attack was Jian Wushuang’s last attempt.

If Blood Emperor survived this attack, the Eternal Chaotic World would be done for!

At the centre of the battlefield, the two terrifying forces were still battling it out. During the collision, the power of both forces got weaker.

One second, two seconds, three seconds…

This collision lasted for five seconds.

Finally… Crack!

A soft sound was heard. The eyes of the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World lit up with elation. They saw cracks forming on the seemingly indestructible crimson-red shield.

Finally, the crimson red shield shattered with a boom!

The crimson red shield that Blood Emperor form using the Opposing Blood Formation was gone.
