The third path was a compromise between the first two paths.

First, they had to spend 100 million sacred pills to reach the edge of the endless territories through the spatial passage. Then, they had to rely on their own strength to pass through the region of bones.

As long as they passed through the region of bones, they would be in the range of the third heaven.

According to the information, the bone region was a place where all kinds of people gathered. It was chaotic and full of killing intent.

“I just became an Immortal Saint not long ago, and I just created the Wushuang Sword Manual. Now, I need to practice my swordsmanship in a lot of battles. Experts in the bone region are everywhere, and there are many of them. Before I step into the third heaven, I can go there to practice.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused, he had already made up his mind.

Ten days later, someone handed the second volume to Jian Wushuang.

Just like the first volume, the second volume was still a detailed dissection of the space-time principles, but it was more than the third stage of the space-time principles, and even included part of the fourth stage, this was naturally very useful to Jian Wushuang.

“My comprehension of the space-time principles has just reached the third stage. This is already the comprehension level of many rank four True Saints, and the limit of the third stage is estimated that many rank six True Saints can’t reach it. Those who can reach that level must be those rank seven True Saints who have already reached the peak!”

“As for the fourth stage of the space-time principles…”

The fourth stage, mastering teleportation!

That level was even more profound.

According to Jian Wushuang’s guess, the one who could master teleportation was definitely the top Immortal Saint. He was even invincible among the Immortal Saints.

In other words, the second volume of the space-time principles should be enough for him to comprehend at the level of the Immortal Saint.

After obtaining the second volume of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual, Jian Wushuang did not delay in the endless territory. Instead, he directly set off and rushed toward the third heaven.

Buzz!

With a burst of dazzling light, Jian Wushuang appeared on a very strange island.

There was also a secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance on this island.

“Is this the edge of the endless territory? That direction should be where the bone region is.” Jian Wushuang stood on the island, looking at the distant void. Soon, he set off.

The white bone region was the closest territory to the third heaven.

There was endless killing here. For many people, it was a paradise, but also a hell.

Because of their yearning for the third heaven, many experts from the endless territory were left here forever on their way through the white bone region.

This territory could be said to be a test that the cultivators of the endless territory had to pass before entering the third heaven.

Three days later.

In a vast void.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A team of more than ten people was rapidly flying through the void.

These ten people all wore different clothes, but the auras they emitted were all extremely powerful.

These ten people were all immortal saints, but most of them were only at the False Saint level. As for True Saints, there were only two people on this team.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, you must be new to the third heaven from the endless territory, right?” A burst of hearty laughter came from the side. The speaker was a slightly fat bald youth, the bald youth carried a saber on his back.

It was a blood saber, exuding an astonishing murderous aura.

“Yes, what about you?” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“Of course it’s my first time too.” The bald youth smiled. “Actually, I’ve wanted to go to the third heaven for a long time, but something happened in my hometown, so I was delayed for a while. By the way, which territory is your hometown in?”

“The Nine Realms of the Golden Crow,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“The Nine Realms of the Golden Crow? I’ve never heard of it.” The bald youth shook his head. “My hometown is the Nine Seas Star Kingdom, the Great Divine Kingdom created by a rank five True Saint.”

“Nine Seas Star Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He had actually heard of the Nine Seas Star Kingdom. It was one of the most powerful divine kingdoms in the endless territories. The king of the nine seas had long reached the peak of the rank five True Saint realm, and his battle strength was even close to that of a rank six True Saint. In the endless territories, he was definitely a supreme super expert.

Three days ago, Jian Wushuang joined this team and passed through the bone region together with many Immortal Saints who were heading to the third heaven.

This bald young man was called Jiu Luo, the only True Saint in the team besides him.

They were the only two True Saints in the team, and Jiu Luo was a very enthusiastic person, so he naturally chatted with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had nothing to do anyway, so he did not dislike Jiu Luo.

“The third heaven. I heard from my master that as the true core of the Divine Beginning World, there are many experts there. True Saints like us are definitely top experts in the endless territories, but they are everywhere in the third heaven. Even some of the fifth and sixth level True Saints are very low-key in the third heaven. They don’t dare to be too presumptuous because they might offend some of the real experts and kill them directly,” Jiu Luo explained.

“You seem to be very good at the Third Heaven?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“Of course!” Jiu Luo said, “But before we reach the Third Heaven, we have to go through the white bone field. It’s very dangerous here.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked very strange.

Jiu Luo seemed to be talking casually with him, but Jian Wushuang could hear a lot of information from his words.

The most important thing was that Jiu Luo was not ordinary. He was definitely not an ordinary first rank True Saint, but at least he had some background.

At this moment…buzz buzz.

A strong divine power aura suddenly came from the void in front of them.

“Well?”

Jian Wushuang, Jiu Luo, and more than a dozen False Saints in the team all looked up.

As soon as they looked up, they saw more than a dozen figures rushing toward them.

There were 15 of them, 11 of whom were fleeing crazily in front, while the other four were chasing after them.

The four chasing after them were True Saints, while the 11 people fleeing were only False Saints. Facing the pursuit of the four True Saints, these False Saints could not resist at all and could only flee.

“Haha, if you want to run, where can you run to?”

Hearty laughter reverberated in the air. The four True Saints were extremely fast and easily caught up to the fleeing people. Then, they began to kill.

“No!”

“Spare me!”

“Why? We’ve never provoked you before. We don’t have any grudges!”

Shrill screams sounded one after another.
