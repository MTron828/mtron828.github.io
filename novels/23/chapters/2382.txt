Chapter 2383: Mu Clan

It was late at night, the moonlight dimmed.

In a jungle far away from Qingxiao City, Xiao Heng and the four core disciples of Narcissus Island sat on the ground, convalescing their divine power after the fight. They all looked tired.

It was nothing to break into Hundred Flowers Tower, fight against the experts, and save Miss Xiao then escaping from the tower. However, they were chased after by a huge group of pursuant who wanted their lives.

They fled from Qingxiao City all the way to where they were while having gone through several obstacles and hard battles along the way. They even fought against Second-Class Divine Demons, but fortunately, they managed to escape.

“Finally, we have dumped those people.”

There was a glimmer of hope on Xiao Heng’s face as he instinctively darted a look at the veiled woman beside him.

Miss Xiao was wearing an ordinary tight-fitting robe that accentuated her perfect figure. The moonlight created a mysterious effect on her which made her appear even more attractive.

She stood there quietly, not saying a word. Xiao Heng involuntarily swallowed a gulp of saliva and at the same time was relieved.

Although they encountered a lot of troubles today, they succeeded in rescuing the beauty.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Suddenly…a slight cracking sound emerged.

“Who was that?”

All five of the Xiao Heng’s party abruptly stood up in vigilance.

“Brothers, it’s me.” Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared in front of the five along with his laughter.

“Jian Wushuang?”

Xiao Heng glanced over at Jian Wushuang. Back at Qingxiao City, the five of them took Miss Xiao and fled the scene. They had sent a message to Jian Wushuang and told him to leave quickly, but did not travel together. Little had they expected that Jian Wushuang would catch up with them.

“Miss Xiao.” Jian Wushuang peeked at Miss Xiao.

“That is very polite of you.” Miss Xiao was being lovely as usual.

“Well, now that we have rescued Miss Xiao and escaped from the charging parties, let us all get some rest and recuperate before returning to Narcissus Island,” said Xiao Heng.

The four core disciples became relaxed.

However, Jian Wushuang shook his head in disagreement. “Brothers, I’m afraid that things aren’t as simple as what you think.”

“What do you mean?” Xiao Heng questioned in a deep voice that was seemingly unhappy.

“Don’t you think that things were progressing too smoothly?” asked Jian Wushuang while still smiling.

Xiao Heng sneered. “Too smooth? You weren’t with us and had no idea how dangerous the situations were just then. Of course, you thought that it went on smoothly.”

“That’s right. It was easy for you to say. If you were with us just now, I’m afraid you would’ve died.” A core disciple next to him jeered.

Jian Wushuang raised his brows.

In fact, he was close behind Xiao Heng and the others and saw what they had been through. They were in a fair bit of trouble, but it was a far cry from real danger as things were going rather smoothly.

Then again, he had done his part to remind them. He could not be bothered if Xiao Heng and the rest took his words lightly.

“Someone is coming,” Jian Wushuang suddenly announced.

“Huh?” Xiao Heng and the others were on their toes. At the same time, their soul powers had allowed them to sense the massive aura appearing in the void near them.

“There are a lot of people and they’re here for us.” Xiao Heng’s expression changed almost instantly. Just as he wanted to retreat, the opponents were already moving at top speeds and appeared in front of them in the blink of an eye.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were more than a dozen figures appeared before them.

Those people’s auras and powers were intimidating.

Among the dozen people, there were powerhouses beyond the Divine Demon Realm with four being Second-Class Divine Demons!

“Damn it!”

“We’re in deep sh*t!”

“How could this be? Haven’t we dumped those pursuing troops from Hundred Flowers Tower?”

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples’ faces became extremely ugly.

The five of them were powerful nonetheless, but they had no chance against the strong lineup of four Second-Class Divine Demons and a dozen of Third-Class Divine Demons.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes as he studied the group of experts surrounding them.

“These people are not from the Hundred Flowers Tower.”

Jian Wushuang was tailing the Xiao Heng’s group. He knew for sure that they had escaped the pursuing troops from Hundred Flowers Tower.

The ones that appeared before them…

“Fellow friends from Narcissus Island, don’t worry. We’re from the Mu Clan.” A clear and crisp voice came from the mouth of a Second-Class Divine Demon.

He was an elder with white hair. The old man had a raddled look with seemingly cloudy eyes and a gentle smile.

“Mu Clan?”

Xiao Heng was relieved and was soon overcome with joy.

“We came with orders from the Mu Clan head to bring the Second Miss home. This is a token from the Mu Clan. You can have a look at it.” The white-haired old man threw a token toward their direction.

Xiao Heng took it and examined it carefully before nodding. “It’s indeed a token from the Mu Clan. Why do you need Narcissus Island to carry out the rescue mission if the Mu Clan had sent such a strong party over?”

“I’m unable to explain the reasons to you. In short, now that we are here, we’ll be responsible for the safety of the Second Miss. All of you can return to Narcissus Island,” said the white-haired old man.

“Err…” Xiao Heng and the other core disciples exchanged looks of hesitation.

If they had rescued an ordinary person, they would happily hand that person to the Mu Clan and return to Narcissus Island. However, the one that they had just rescued was none other than the beautiful Miss Xiao, who had completely captured the hearts of Xiao Heng and the four core disciples.

The group of five were reluctant to leave Miss Xiao.

“Your Excellency, how about this? Let us join your group to the Mu’s Residence. My brothers and I’ll leave as soon as we see that Miss Xiao had safely stepped into the Mu’s Residence.” Xiao Heng suggested.

“That might not be feasible. I think you should just return to Narcissus Island.” The white-haired old man kept a smile on his face.

Xiao Heng could sense that something was wrong.

Not only did those people from the Mu Clan appear strangely out of nowhere, they even insisted on escorting Miss Xiao and refused the company of Xiao Heng’s group, hence raising his suspicions.

“You are not from the Mu Clan!” Xiao Heng roared.

The four core disciples immediately took out their weapons and stood ready.

Jian Wushuang shook his head when he heard Xiao Heng. “I think you are wrong. These people are indeed from the Mu Clan. However, if I’m not wrong, they aren’t here to bring Miss Xiao home. Instead, they’re here to make sure Miss Xiao will never return to the Mu’s Residence.”

“What?” Xiao Heng’s face changed.

‘Are they here to kill Miss Xiao?’

Jian Wushuang glanced at Miss Xiao who was next to him and was certain that he got it right when he noticed the chilliness in her eyes.
