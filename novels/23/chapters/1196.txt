Chapter 1197: The Scene

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Look at your faces! Look at how you’re behaving!”

There was anger concealed in the voice of the Master of Samsara Temple as his voice reverberated in the ears of the Holy Masters gathered like the booming of thunder.

“Useless fools!” the Master of Void Temple roared furiously.

The Holy Masters were thunderstruck.

The Master of Samsara Temple continued, “If you’re this fearful before the forces of the Jin Kingdom arrive, the people of our Green Fire World can just sit and wait for our deaths when they truly descend on us.”

“Humph!”

The Master of Void Temple once again snorted coldly, the sound like a harsh rap on the hearts of the Holy Masters.

“Listen up, all of you!”

“Even though the forces of the Jin Kingdom are formidable, we aren’t the same Green Fire World of five million years ago!”

“If we unite and work together, there’s still hope of survival!”

“Moreover, so what if we can’t block the attacks of the Jin Kingdom and get annihilated?”

“Even a beast that has no intelligence will bare its fangs and launch a final attack in the face of certain death! It will strive to break its enemy’s jaw even at the cost of its life!”

“But look at you all. Have you all lived for so long that you have lost even this bit of enthusiasm?”

“Do we not even have the most basic courage to fight even when we are facing formidable enemies?”

The words of the Master of Void Temple reverberated in the hearts of the Holy Masters, many of whom who appeared sheepish. There were also those who looked fired up.

Enthusiasm!

It was something that existed in everyone!

Even though these Holy Masters had lived very long lives until they were all wizened, the passion rooted in their bones never once dissipated with age.

“Even if your passion is all but gone due to your age, you still have your pride, don’t you?” the Master of Void Temple continued, his gaze sweeping the Holy Masters. “I’ll now show you another scene. I want you to look carefully.”

He then waved his hand and a scene immediately appeared in the Void.

The first scene surprisingly depicted the area that was shrouded in the purple mist.

“That’s… That’s the former capital of the Jin Kingdom?”

Recognizing the area shrouded in purple mist at once, the Holy Masters all wore expressions of confusion over the intentions of the Master of Void Temple.

Just then, a streak of light was immediately thrown into the purple mist. An earth-shattering explosion followed and the purple mist promptly dissipated. The four Palace Masters—the Master of Samsara Temple, the Master of Void Temple, Emperor of Tang, and Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword—immediately charged at a Puppet Fighter.

The Holy Masters on the empty ground looked astonished.

“The former capital of the Jin Kingdom… The four Palace Masters attacked the former capital of the Jin Kingdom?”

“Those Puppet Fighters were of the Universe Master level?”

“T-This…”

The scene of the experts from the Jin Kingdom and the Green Fire Palace waring played. The Master of Samsara Temple had immediately demonstrated his overwhelming strength to suppress Red Snow King.

Red Lotus had unleashed his Nine Serenities World that unveiled pressure over the entire battlefield and killed a large number of Holy Masters from the Jin Kingdom.

“The Master of Samsara Temple is so powerful!”

“That’s Red Lotus’ Nine Serenities World? The five great Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace had gone all out!”

Emotional sighs and exclamations resounded throughout the empty ground.

“Open your eyes wide for the next scene,” the Master of Void Temple suddenly said, giving them a reminder.

The Holy Masters stared carefully at the unfolding scene and as expected, they saw a great shift in the battle.

They saw a cold sword light rising from a corner of the battlefield and exterminating King Golden Rock of the Jin Kingdom at lightning speed.

“Oh my God, King Golden Rock is killed!”

“What speed! Who is it?”

“Who’s the one responsible for that swordsmanship?”

Amid the sea of exclamations, the scene depicted a silhouette charging toward King Fantastical Heaven and killed him at a similarly terrifying swordsmanship and speed. It was only then that they got a clear look at the figure.

“That’s…”

The Holy Masters stared fixedly at the figure depicted on the scene. Then, a commotion broke out.

“Jian Wushuang! That’s Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang! How could it be Jian Wushuang?”

“Jian Wushuang didn’t die?”

They were all shocked.

It was the five Palace Masters who personally announced Jian Wushuang’s death 1,800 years ago. It had been a collective loss for them.

Yet they saw Jian Wushuang once again, who now slaughtered Holy Masters like he was slaughtering chickens.

The following scene was akin to a great massacre as Jian Wushuang killed another Universe Master of the Jin Kingdom.

He alone had killed three great Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom.

Then, they saw Red Snow King using his soul-luring skill to bring the descent of the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom upon them. Even the Master of Samsara Temple suffered defeat in the hands of the manifestation of the Monarch’s consciousness.

Their hearts thumped furiously as they watched. Many of them even wore expressions of fear, conveying their dread of the might of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang once again made his move.

The Holy Masters once again made a ruckus when they saw Jian Wushuang making his move.

“What a joke! The Monarch defeated even the Master of Samsara Temple. What’s Jian Wushuang doing, going up to him alone like that?”

“Reckless! He’s too reckless!”

“This Jian Wushuang! He ought to be teaming up with the Palace Masters and fight the manifestation of the Monarch’s consciousness!”

Quite a few people bristled.

However, the following scene silenced them.

They watched as Jian Wushuang unleashed his gleaming sword and exchanged blows with the Monarch of Jin Kingdom. The outcome was surprisingly an equaled match!

It was a true equaled match!

“H-He…”

“Not even the Master of Samsara Temple is a match for the Monarch, but Jian Wushuang… He’s capable of contending with the Monarch?”

“How could he be that strong?”

“He’s far too strong!”

These Holy Masters were all dumbfounded.

Then, the scene showed them how Jian Wushuang demonstrated the entirety of his strength and how he and his doppelganger worked with the Master of Samsara Temple to finally crush the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness.

The scene also showed how the Jin Kingdom experts were massacred.

The scene kept going for a while before finally ending.

The Holy Masters gathered on the ground stood there speechlessly, looking stupefied.

Emotions surged violently within them.

The Master of Samsara Temple and the Master of Void Temple silently took in the expressions of the Holy Masters. After a while, the former finally opened his mouth to speak in a chilly voice.

“Have you taken a good look?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Silence fell over the Holy Masters.

“Humph!”

The voice of the Master of Samsara Temple was icy-cold.

“How many years have you all been living? How many thousands and hundreds of thousands have it been? There are those among you who have lived for millions of years! Even the youngest of you lot are hundred thousands or even million years old!”

“Yet look at Jian Wushuang.”
