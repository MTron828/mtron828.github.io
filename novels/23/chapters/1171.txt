Blood Mountain!

When Jian Wushuang lived on the Star Island, he used the pseudonym Blood Mountain.

“Blood Mountain!”

His three friends Ling Long, Zi Dong, and Qian Yu were all present.

“All of you, I haven’t seen you in ages, you’re doing alright?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Blood Mountain, I knew you will come back. You came to take us away, right?” Qian Yu sounded excited.

“Well, I planned to, but I don’t know if I can.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Blood Mountain, you’ve grown stronger than before, right?” Zi Dong’s eyes flashed with excitement.

There had been 12 Kings on the island, among whom Zi Dong always ranked the first, and he was the only one that passed the second test of the three tests of the Black Tower.

Later, Jian Wushuang became the first one to pass three test and left the Star Island. However, Zi Dong was still stuck in the Level Two, Zi Dong naturally felt a little disheartened.

“Your strength must have improved and can pass the third test, right?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I am still far away from that.” Zi Dong shrugged.

Jian Wushuang spent some time chatting with his three friends.

“Blood Mountain.”

A deep voice rang, and a middle-aged man wearing a cyan gown and a stubble came over.

“Oh, Dao Master Kong Ming?” Jian Wushuang grinned.

Dao Master Kong Ming stopped in front of Jian Wushuang and looked him up and down. Finally, he nodded slightly and said, “My agreement with you is that you return to this Star Island within 100,000 years, but now it has been less than 2,000 years, and you already returned?” Have you already obtained the strength to overcome the ultimate test? ”

“I can’t know for sure, but I can try.” Jian Wushuang said.

He didn’t know what the ultimate test was, and naturally, he didn’t dare to guarantee.

“Oh?” Dao Master Kong Ming cocked an eyebrow. “It looks like you’re quite confident.”

“You might say so.” Jian Wushuang smiled and nodded.

If he was not confident, he would not have come to the Star Island so soon.

However, just as Jian Wuhsuang finished…

“Since my friend is so confident, I wonder if I can have a friendly competition with you.” A gentle voice suddenly sounded. It was an old man in a gray robe, standing next to him were three people whose aura had reached the level of Dao Master.

The five Dao Masters on the Star Island were all present.

“This is…?” Jian Wushuang looked at the grey-robed elder.

“This is Dao Master Thousand Water, who is the oldest and the most capable of the five Dao Masters on our Star Island.” Dao Master Kong Ming introduced.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang cocked one eyebrow.

“Indeed, I’m the strongest of the five. However, I’m still not qualified for the ultimate test yet.” The grey-robed elder Thousand Water Dao said, “Since my friend aims at the ultimate test, then you have to be stronger than me in strength. I wonder if you’re capable enough?”

“Since Dao Master Thousand Water is interested, then it’ll be disrespectful to decline, please.” Jian Wushuang smiled in reply.

“My friend, be careful.”

Dao Master Thousand Water reminded, and then a strong Spiritual Power surging on him. The pure power was far more powerful than an ordinary Rank Three Peak Dao Master’s. However, he still failed to compare with a Holy Master.

Under the surging mighty Spiritual Power, Dao Master Thousand Water stretched to slap Jian Wushuang lightning fast.

In an instant, a vast mountain aimed directly at Jian Wushuang.

The power had definitely reached the level of Holy Master.

“He’s only a Dao Master, but has the strength of a Holy Master. Dao Master Thousand Water is not weak.” Jian Wushuang faintly smiled, and when the Majestic Mountain was about to hit him, he slowly stretched and gently stroked. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It was such a casual and slow stroke that it seemed not to contain even the slightest power.

But the Majestic Mountain had already been torn apart, a lot of Spiritual Power rushed around.

Dao Master Thousand Water’s eyes narrowed; a sword light had already penetrated his body directly.

Clang! His body quickly returned to normal.

He stood there, staring at Jian Wushuang, with a hint of horror.

The people around watching the battle were also wearing an incredible expression.

Dao Master Thousand Water had let out all his strength, and Jian Wushuang just stroked to beat him without even drawing his sword?

The special part about the Star Island was that you would not die here, otherwise Dao Master Thousand Water would have been dead.

Was there such a gap between them?

“Dao Master Thousand Water, thank you.” Jian Wushuagn was smiling.

“Hope, you’re our hope to pass the ultimate test!” The old Dao Master Thousand Water trembled.

Though defeated by Jian Wushuang, he was not angry, and was actually extremely happy.

Everyone watching the battle had become fanatical.

Jian Wushuang had come to challenge the ultimate test on the Star Island, the stronger he was, the greater chance they had.

Now that he had beaten Dao Master Thousand Water so easily, they all recognized his strength.

Jian Wushuang was definitely promising to pass the ultimate test.

“Great, great!”

“After so many years, have we finally seen a glimmer of hope?”

“This Blood Mountain is definitely promising to pass the ultimate test and control the entire Star Island. In time, he can release us all if he’d like.”

Everyone on the Star Island was excited.

“Blood Mountain.” An indifferent voice sounded.

Everyone turned their heads and saw a beautiful and enchanting red-robed woman standing in the Void.

The people on the Star Island all looked in awe.

“Lord Spirit Sound.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Come with me.” Lord Spirit Sound finished her words, then turned around and left.

Jian Wushuang immediately followed.

Not long after, he followed Lord Spirit Sound into a palace.

“Sit down.”

Lord Spirit Sound waved, and Jian Wushuang sat down beside the table.

“I didn’t expect this. In less than 2,000 years, you have already broken through to reach the Dao Master level and returned to the Star Island.” You’re fast enough.” Lord Spirit Sound looked very surprised.

“It’s just good luck.” Jian Wushuang laughed modestly.

“It doesn’t take good luck to break through to the Dao Master level, not to mention you’re an Inverse Cultivator.” Lord Spirit Sound said calmly, “Well, where’s Gu King? Let it out, I really want to see what that old guy becomes after following you.”

Jian Wushuang urged, and immediately Gu King transformed into a Plenilune worm beast and climbed out of him.
