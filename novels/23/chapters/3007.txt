Chapter 3008: Dragon-Imprisoning Compass

——

“It’s been a while since we left the Gold Mountain Sect. The experts of the Gold Mountain Sect and the Magic Note Divine Kingdom should have known that it was just a corpse puppet that was destroyed.” Jian Wushuang sat in the grass, a wicked smile appeared on his face.

Through the conversations of the surrounding disciples, he also knew that he had just gone to the Golden Mountain Sect.

In the Golden Mountain Sect, he had put on a good show to escape.

He had gotten the corpse puppet with the battle strength of an Invincible Divine Master from the secret realm a long time ago. It was wearing his gray robe and gray mask to attract everyone’s attention, and he had fled with the disciples of the Golden Mountain Sect, he quietly left the Gold Mountain Sect and left everyone’s sight.

“It’s all thanks to the special gray robe and gray mask of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, which can change the aura emitted by people. Otherwise, those Immortal Saints would have been able to tell that it was a corpse puppet at a glance,” Jian Wushuang said with a chuckle.

He believed that he should be out of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom’s sight by now. He would naturally be able to go wherever he wanted.

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought.

Suddenly…

“Senior brother.” A gentle voice suddenly sounded. A female disciple in a white robe next to Jian Wushuang looked at him and said, “Senior brother, you look unfamiliar. Which peak do you come from?”

The female disciple in a white robe asked casually, but Jian Wushuang could not help smiling bitterly at her words.

He could understand that there should be several peaks in the Golden Mountain Sect that represented different sects. However, he was not a disciple of the Golden Mountain Sect, so he did not know what peaks there were.

“As for me, I’m from Beiming Peak,” Jian Wushuang said casually.

The white-robed female disciple was stunned, and the surrounding disciples immediately looked at him in unison.

“Haha, it seems that I’ve been exposed. I’d better leave first,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. His figure instantly floated out and left the place at the fastest speed. The remaining disciples of the Golden Mountain Sect were still standing there in a daze.

It took them a long time to realize what had happened. Then, they immediately sent a message to the elders of the Golden Mountain Sect.

…

Due to the wanton destruction of the corpse puppet, more than one-third of the entire Golden Mountain Sect had been turned into ruins.

In the void above the ruins, many experts were standing there.

In addition to the Immortal Saints of the Golden Mountain Sect, the True Saint experts who had besieged Jian Wushuang had also arrived.

Not long after, Lord Wu came in person.

The Sect Master of the Golden Mountain Sect recounted what had just happened in detail.

After saying that, he said in a low voice, “Lord Wu, I’m incompetent. I’ve let down the king!”

Lord Wu glanced at the Sect Master of the Golden Mountain Sect and waved his hand after a long while. “It’s not entirely your fault. First of all, the man of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance concealed his aura so well that no one could see his specific realm, which gave him a chance to escape. Secondly, that man was too cunning. Who would have thought that he would use such a move?”

The people around nodded.

Indeed, to be able to use the golden transcendence shell right under the noses of a large group of Immortal Saints without being discovered, it could not be said that these Immortal Saints were stupid. It could only be said that the other party was too cunning and his methods were too powerful.

“Lord Wu, that person has already completely escaped our sight. It will be difficult for us to find him again,” said a True Saint beside him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hmph, so what if he has escaped our sight? As long as he is still in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, he will definitely not be able to escape.” Lord Wu’s gaze was cold, but his words carried absolute confidence. “Everyone, you might not know this, but I came out this time to take precautions. I brought out the monarch’s imprisoning dragon compass as well.”

“Imprisoning dragon compass?” Everyone present, including the Golden Mountain Sect Master, was greatly shocked.

The dragon imprisoning compass was a treasure that the Magic Note King had paid a huge price to specially hire someone to refine.

It was an extremely unique array-type treasure.

The compass contained an enormous array formation that was indestructible. It could be large or small, and it could be freely controlled.

Back then, when the dragon imprisoning compass was in the Magic Note King’s hands, the Magic Note King could even use the compass to cast an array formation that covered the entire endless territories of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

And now, even if the person who possessed the dragon imprisoning compass was Lord Wu, in Lord Wu’s hands, the power that the compass could unleash was definitely not small.

“Bring me the star map of this realm,” Lord Wu instructed.

Immediately, a gigantic star map appeared in front of everyone.

“Previously, when I received a message from the Golden Mountain Sect Master and learned that that person had escaped, I immediately gave the order to seal off all spatial passageways in this realm. In other words, that person did not have the chance to use spatial passageways and could only rely on his own strength to fly.”

“And back then, when he relied on the strength of his feet to fly, even though his speed was extremely fast, I treated him as a third level true saint who specialized in speed…less than two hours had passed since he disappeared from our sight. In these two hours, the area that he could fly to was from here to here. At most, he would be in this area.”

Lord Wu then used his divine power to draw a region on the star map.

This region was a region around the Golden Mountain Sect.

This region was nothing compared to a large region. However, just this region covered over a thousand cities, and it also included all sorts of tall mountains and dense forests.

It was too easy to hide a person in such a vast place.

Lord Wu’s gaze was cold. After locking onto this area, he waved his hand and a golden compass immediately appeared in his hand.

There was also a golden dragon pattern on this compass.

As Lord Wu’s divine power flowed into the compass, the compass immediately burst out with resplendent golden light. In the next moment, it roared!

A gigantic Golden Dragon Phantom rose up from the compass out of thin air. A layer of majestic golden light rose straight into the void at the highest point. After that, the golden light spread out in all directions at a terrifying speed.

The speed of its spread was far beyond imagination.

In just a short moment, the golden light had already crossed hundreds of millions of miles and covered the area that Lord Wu had pointed out on the star map, including the many cities.

After doing all this, Lord Wu put away the compass and a cold smile appeared on his face.

“I’ve already used the magic formation of the dragon imprisoning compass to completely seal off this area. From today onward, this area can only be entered and can not be exited. As for that person from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he has naturally been completely sealed off in this area by me. Next, we just need to think of a way to find him in this area!” Lord Wu said coldly.
