Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

According to Jian Wushuang’s guess, his Ruler Xuan Yi in the Divine Beginning Realm was probably an avatar of a mighty expert in the universe.

Xuan Yi in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy was probably also an avatar. Otherwise, he would not have come to his death so calmly.

“Thunder God Palace Master, since Xuan Yi died in your hands, the treasures he left behind should also be in your hands, right?”Jian Wushuang asked.

“His interspatial ring is here. I checked it before and found that he has an extraordinary family background and some special treasures, but that’s all.” Thunder God Palace Master waved his hand and directly threw an interspatial ring to Jian Wushuang.

After taking it, Jian Wushuang briefly scanned it with his consciousness. The many treasures in the interspatial ring were comparable to that of a fifth-level Ruler. It even had a principle supreme treasure, but there were no real treasures.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Thunder God Palace Master and did not doubt it.

“There’s one more thing. Since your Thunder God Palace has already killed Xuan Yi, why didn’t you announce it to the public? Instead, you quietly withdrew the reward. Moreover, the entire Thunder God Palace kept this matter a secret. Only a few people at the highest level know about it?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, the sky-high bounty offered by the Thunder God Palace was to kill his Ruler Xuan Yi. Now that the Thunder God Palace had killed Xuan Yi, it was only natural that it should announce it to the public.

However, the performance of the Thunder God Palace was obviously not like this.

“Humph, Blood Sword Ruler, what do you think my Thunder God Palace is? Do you think my Thunder God Palace doesn’t have any face?” The Palace Master snorted coldly.

“Shameless?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Xuan Yi is only a third-level Ruler. It’s embarrassing that my palace failed to find him and kill him after 100,000 years. If the outside world knows that my palace failed to find Xuan Yi and that Xuan Yi came to my palace to seek his death, my palace will become a joke.” Thunder God Palace Master’s voice was cold.

“Is that why the Thunder God Palace quietly withdrew the bounty? Do you want to let this matter rest?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, that’s right.” Thunder God Palace Master nodded. “Of course, there’s another reason. Although Xuan Yi is only a third-level Ruler, I can’t see through him at all. I once doubted whether he had a great background or background, and Xuan Yi died by my hand in the end. Naturally, I was worried that the person behind Xuan Yi would come looking for me, so I tried my best to cover it up. I didn’t expect that you would come looking for me so soon.”

There was obviously a hint of helplessness in Thunder God Palace Master’s words.

After hearing what Thunder God Palace Master said, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had already understood.

When Xuan Yi killed Lei Yi, the number one genius of Thunder God Palace, Thunder God Palace was extremely furious. At that time, they did not think much about it. They just issued a reward and caused such a big commotion

However, after the Thunder God Palace came into contact with Xuan Yi, the Thunder God Palace felt that Xuan Yi was extraordinary.

Especially after Xuan Yi went to the sect and begged for death. When the Thunder God Palace Master came into contact with Xuan Yi, the Thunder God Palace Master could not see through Xuan Yi at all. This made the Thunder God Palace Master wary. He felt that Xuan Yi had a huge background and status.

At that time, the Thunder God Palace Master already regretted making such a huge commotion and putting a bounty on Xuan Yi. However, he had no choice but to shoot the arrow at the bowstring. The Thunder God Palace Master still killed Xuan Yi, however, the next step was to cover up the matter. Firstly, it was for his own face. Secondly, he did not want the news to spread and alert the forces or backgrounds behind Xuan Yi.

Jian Wushuang could accept Thunder God Palace Master’s explanation.

“Thunder God Palace Master.” Jian Wushuang looked at Thunder God Palace Master again. “I can tell you now that Xuan Yi was my Ruler. To be exact, he was a clone of my Ruler.”

“Ruler?” Thunder God Palace Master was stunned, but his heart was twitching, “This Blood Sword is only a third-level Ruler, but his battle strength is comparable to that of an Ultimate Ruler. Moreover, his comprehension of the universe principles is terrifyingly high. He is definitely one of the top and most terrifying super monsters in the vast universe. Such a monster is already shocking enough. How terrifying would it be to be able to teach such a monster?”

At this moment, Thunder God Palace Master was truly terrified.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang also noticed his fear.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, he said, “Thunder God Palace Master, what kind of person is my Ruler? Although the avatar you killed is not important to him, his identity and strength are obvious. Tell me, how should I end this matter?”

“What do you want?” Thunder God Palace Master took a deep breath.

“It’s simple. Take out 30,000 universe origin stones to apologize, and this matter will end here,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay, sure.” Thunder God Palace Master nodded without hesitation.

“So straightforward?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

In fact, Xuan Yi was his Ruler, but Jian Wushuang did not know whether it was really a avatar or some special reason. Moreover, whether Xuan Yi really had a great background and background was a mystery.

However, Jian Wushuang could see that Thunder God Palace Master was terrified of his Ruler’s identity, so he naturally wanted to avenge his Ruler and extort him. Therefore, he directly offered 30,000 universe origin stones as an apology, he thought that this price was high enough and that Thunder God Palace Master should at least haggle over it, but in the end, Thunder God Palace Master agreed so readily.

He agreed to 30,000 universe origin stones immediately.

“As expected of the Overlord who has been standing in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy for so many years. The Thunder God Palace is really rich. It seems that my price of 30,000 universe origin stones is still a little low,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Hearing this, the corner of the Palace Master’s mouth twitched.

30,000 universe origin stones —

It must be known that the total wealth of an ordinary Ultimate Ruler was only around 10,000 universe origin stones. 30,000 universe origin stones was equivalent to the total wealth of the three Ultimate Rulers.

But Thunder God Palace Master was, after all, a top-tier existence among the Ultimate Rulers, and his wealth was much richer than that of an ordinary Ultimate Ruler. In addition, Thunder God Palace had been standing in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy for so many years, and it had a deep foundation. So, 30,000 universe origin stones…he was still able to afford it.

Of course, even if he could afford it, it was still an incomparably large sum of money to Thunder God Palace.

Thunder God Palace Master had no other choice. He really thought that Xuan Yi’s background was very huge and had a great background. After all, just a third level Ruler level disciple was already enough to make Thunder God Palace helpless, if someone else appeared behind Xuan Yi, the Thunder God Palace would not be able to resist.

Therefore, he could only compromise.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
