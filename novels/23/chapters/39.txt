Chapter 40: The Dark Forest

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Dark Forest, spirit beasts were everywhere—it was a time of crisis. If Jian Wushuang wanted to go to Tiannan Province, he had to go through the Dark Forest.

The first day after setting foot in the Dark Forest—

Deep in the thick jungle—

“Howl!”

After roaring, a blue shadow jumped out as if it was a Ghost, rushing at Jian Wushuang and Sima Bu directly. Both of them responded quickly, and they easily moved away from the beast.

“It’s a Scarlet Leopard, no wonder it moved so fast,” said Sima Bu with a low voice, looking at the spirit beast which suddenly attacked them.

“Leave it to me,” Jian Wushuang said with piercing eyesight. He pulled his Triple-kill Sword from behind, and the sword light moved straight toward the Scarlet Leopard.

“Be careful, this Scarlet Leopard has reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm…” Sima Bu had only just reminded him, then Jian Wushuang showed off his unparalleled sword light the next moment.

The sword light was like snow, and on such a boundless ground, broke out its Spiritual Power all of a sudden.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

After a series of three swords split out, each sword light looked so beautiful. At that time, the Scarlet Leopard also charged forward—its four hooves, trampling heavily on the ground, then turned into lightning, rushing toward Jian Wushuang fiercely.

“Chi!”

At that moment, the brilliant sword light easily ripped a huge hole in the Scarlet Leopard’s body, and the Scarlet Leopard’s belly began to bleed as all its internal organs began falling out everywhere, which lead to its immediate death.

“Too weak.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the body of the Scarlet Leopard, and sympathetically shook his head.

Compared with humans, spirit beasts at the same level were indeed more powerful. However, when it was under the condition of slaughtering, it entirely depended on the instinct of the spirit beast, which was far less than a cultivating Human Warrior with Martial Arts Techniques.

“I have broken through the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path. My Spiritual Power could be compared to the highest Level of Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, but by virtue of my swordsmanship, spirit beasts in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm are not a threat to me at all. If it was a Spirit Beast in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, there may have been some pressure on me,” Jian Wushuang said, with a glimmer of anticipation in his eyes.

There were not many things in the Dark Forest, but there were many spirit beasts.

Here, there were countless spirit beasts in the Spiritual Sea Realm, and there were even quite a few spirit beasts in the Gold Core Realm. With so many strong Spirit Beasts, it could serve as an excellent cultivating place as well as a dangerous spot at the same time.

“Ah! Excellent swordsmanship, boy!” Sima Bu came over, glancing at Jian Wushuang with astonishment. “In addition, your Cultivation is not bad as well. How did you kill that Scarlet Leopard, in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, in an instant? Also, how old are you this year?”

“Sixteen.” Jian Wushuang told him his true age.

Sima Bu stared at him.

“Brother Bu, from now on, if it’s not necessary, you do not have to fight. I can take charge of killing the spirit beasts on the way through the Dark Forest,” Jian Wushuang solemnly said.

“No problem. Sounds good to me.” Sima Bu nodded with a smile, with no need to explain more since he knew Jian Wushuang’s purpose.

Half a day later— Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Boy, be cautious. What you are facing now is a Spurting Mouse in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. It is not only fast but also has a body that’s extremely hard, except for its eyes. But its means of attack are very simple. And that is its teeth, which are very sharp and can easily crunch rigid bluestones. Therefore, you’d better protect yourself from being bitten.” Sima Bu reminded him off to the side.

Jian Wushuang stared at the Spurting Mouse in front of him, a small but oppressive figure that had eyes blazing with ferocity.

“Frizzle!”

The Spurting Mouse made a whinny sound, then its body immediately burst out in the form of a Flowing Light.

“Purple Fire Sword Art!”

Jian Wushuang, who became hot-tempered, used the Triple-kill Sword with a baking-hot Sword Edge, and instantaneously slaughtered the Spurting Mouse.

Such a fierce fight.

Because the body of the Spurting Mouse was so stiff, it was not hurt too much by Jian Wushuang, either by his Long Sword or the straight stab. The only vulnerability of the Spurting Mouse was its eyes. However, the target was too small and moved so fast. It was actually quite difficult to attack it. At last, Jian Wushuang was forced to use the First Move of Anonymous Sword Art, Blood Shadow. He swept his sword toward the Spurting Mouse with an astonishing speed. With this move, he successfully killed it.

Unfortunately, the Spurting Mouse had also bitten off a large piece of flesh from his shoulder. It was such a painful wound.

“Carry on!”

Simply bandaging the wound on his shoulder, Jian Wushuang recovered his Spiritual Power and he continued on his way.

That night, the moonlight was so bright but it did not reach into the forest. The complete darkness in the Dark Forest was horrible.

Later, in the treetops of a large tree lay Sima Bu, dangling a weed and laying on his hands while his eyes looked at Jian Wushuang, who was cultivating under the tree from time to time.

“How hardworking this little guy is. He is so strict with himself.” Sima Bu laughed secretly.

Although he had entered the Dark Forest only one day ago, Sima Bu felt the instinctive madness in Jian Wushuang.

In just one day’s time, Jian Wushuang had gone through a full eight battles, of which six opponents were spirit beasts in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm, while the other two were in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.

With Jian Wushuang’s present strength, it would be extremely fierce to fight with spirit beasts in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm without using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill. Like today, when fighting with a spirit beast in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, although Jian Wushuang had successfully killed one of them, he himself did not escape unharmed.

A large chunk of flesh was bitten off his shoulder, and another spirit beast in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm scratched him above his chest with its sharp claws, leaving a very clear bloody paw print.

In fact, as extremely numerous as spirit beasts were in the Dark Forest, it was impossible to encounter so many spirit beasts in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm on the first day. This occurred because Jian Wushuang deliberately searched for those spirit beasts.

As for other Warriors, they tended to avoid meeting spirit beasts that had mighty strength. However, Jian Wushuang was deliberately looking for these powerful spirit beasts to battle with them.

“Although it’s a bit crazy, he has improved through these experiences. What’s more, his swordsmanship is really good,” Sima Bu said to himself.

“Swordsmanship?” Sima Bu was suddenly a little touched, but he became absorbed in thought the next moment.

Early the next morning, Jian Wushuang gradually opened his eyes with a trace of joy.

After one night, his Spiritual Power was refined a bit, and although his overall strength had not improved, at least he was making progress every day. The life-or-death fights in the Dark Forest with Spirit Beasts had also greatly promoted his swordsmanship.

“Carry on today…” Jian Wushuang gripped his hands tightly. A madness shined deep in his eyes that had not even slightly weakened. Instead, it had become a little more powerful.
