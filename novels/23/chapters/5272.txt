Chapter 5271 - 5271: Was Being Weak a Sin?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

With skeletal hands trembling, Jian Wushuang struggled to rise, gripping the railing for support as he gazed outside the city.

The wind continued to howl!

Most of the people on the city walls chose to retire. Before leaving, they bid farewell to Jian Wushuang one by one, expressing their gratitude for saving their lives.

Jian Wushuang remained silent, only nodding in acknowledgment.

After the 9th wave, the identity tokens did not indicate when the next wave would begin, nor did they announce the number of Devouring Demons for the next round.

Jian Wushuang speculated silently.

“It can’t be the same as before, right?”

If it was the same as before, he would have to retire in the eleventh wave. Handling a million 4- Star Devouring Demons was truly beyond his capabilities. Handling 100,000 might give him some hope.

For that origin source, he was willing to go all out once again!

A million 4- Star Devouring Demons might not be insurmountable.

Of course, this was just speculation. With the identity tokens not displaying any information, he couldn’t be sure.

According to convention, there should be a day of rest this time. He needed to exchange for a Time Chamber this time, at least to seclude himself for tens of thousands of years.

Chambers of this level required an astronomical number of treasure points. In the outside world, they might not be worth much. However, at this moment, on the eve of the trial, wanting to seclude oneself for tens of thousands of years came at a tremendous cost.

At the very least, he had to spend a considerable amount of treasure points to first restore his strength. Then he needed to exchange for treasures that enhanced his basic divine body. If possible, he also had to refine his physical body to perfection.

After catching his breath, he descended from the city wall.

He still had one more thing to do: negotiate with Si Tian about acquiring the Candle Dragon Treasures to the best of his abilities.

Which treasure it was, was most likely the Dragon Candle Claw. Even though he didn’t specialize in claw techniques, he possessed an Extreme Dao origin source, making it possible for him to cultivate various techniques.

Moreover, his cultivation speed was incredibly fast. He had absorbed many claw technique origin sources before, especially some unique understandings of claw techniques from the Emperor’s memories.

If he utilized claw techniques and once the three parts of the Beast God Weapons were integrated, the power might surpass that of the replicated Eternal Treasure.

In that case, his strength would increase significantly.

At least, after the amplification of his divine body, it could soar to 10,000 times its original power.

“10,000 times!” Jian Wushuangs eyes lit up, and a daring speculation appeared in his mind.

If the speculation was true, his strength could probably increase even further.

Walking down the stairs, Dao Lord Si Tian had been waiting for him on the city wall for a long time.

The two stood side by side on the city wall, both gazing outside the city.

“What’s the plan for the next step?” Si Tian asked calmly.

Jian Wushuang took out two flasks of strong liquor from his mustard seed ring.

The liquor didn’t affect him much, except for the burning sensation in his throat. It did, however, bring a slight calmness to his restless mind, along with a unique flavor.

Si Tian wiped his mouth with his sleeve, took the flask handed to him, and gulped down a mouthful.

“What else can we do? Let’s continue fighting. There aren’t many good options now,” Jian Wushuang said, taking another sip. He leaned against the city wall, staring at the outside.

Through the dust, slanting rays of sunlight illuminated the two figures.

They were like old friends, recounting their past, present, and future as if they had known each other for many years.

“Have you made a decision about the Beast God Weapons?” Jian Wushuang asked casually, a faint smile on his lips.

“l have, but I’m missing one thing,” replied Si Tian, the doubt evident on his face.

“What is it?”

“Take a guess!”

“Is it something on me?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head!

Si Tian’s expression turned perplexed, then curious. “Could it be that the old man with the goat horns still has some parts of the Beast God Weapons?”

“No, he doesn’t. There wouldn’t be so many benefits left for me if he did,” Jian Wushuang responded, shaking his head again.

If there were, he would have to question his own luck. Considering his aura at the Qishen Temple, it wasn’t likely. Hu Qing might have had a chance if he were still around.

Si Tian nodded, realizing he had overthought the situation. He sighed and said, “So, it’s the item on me, then.’

“No, it’s not that easy for the Beast God Weapons to merge. If it were, we wouldn’t get our hands on them,” Jian Wushuang offered his insight.

“What is it, then?”

“You’ll find out later, at least after the 11th wave,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“The 11th wave?”

“Yes.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“For now, let’s talk about the item on you. Have you considered it? The treasure points I have are enough to tempt you,” Jian Wushuang said, placing his identity token on the city wall.

Si Tian reached out to take it. After weighing it in his hands, he nodded, his brows furrowing in what seemed to be a mix of amusement and annoyance.

“It’s quite a lot. 1 possess some valuable items too.”

His tone changed as he continued, “But it’s just tempting, nothing more.”

With that, he tossed the identity token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t surprised by this.

If Si Tian didn’t know about the Beast God Weapon, there might have been a chance for them to make a deal. But now that he was aware of it, there was no reason for him to back down.

He couldn’t just admit defeat and hand it over to Jian Wushuang, could he?

Jian Wushuang remained silent as he took the token back into his body.

“As for the matter of the Beast God Weapons, only the two of us are aware of it. You can rest assured; I won’t speak a word about it to anyone,” Dao Lord Si Tian said, gazing up at the sky, lamenting his unfortunate fate.

“It’s a pity. With you here, I might have had a chance to become an Emperor on my own without anyone’s help.”

Indeed, without Jian Wushuang, there would have been no one to compete with him for the Candle Dragon Wings. At this moment, the four origin sources might have been in Si Tian’s hands.

With his strength, although the 11th wave was challenging, with the Candle Dragon Wings, he could enhance his speed and elevate his claw techniques to a level comparable to a half-step Emperor. Once the Beast God Weapon was integrated, Si Tian wouldn’t just be advancing to a half-step Emperor; he would be able to rival an Emperor.

After perfecting his cultivation of the origin source, succeeding in merging with the Qishen Temple, and possessing the incomplete Beast God Weapon, his combat power would soar.

He would rise steadily at tier 4, he could step into tier 5, aspiring to be a tier 6 Emperor.

This was a tremendous opportunity, but it had been intercepted by Jian Wushuang. Si Tian felt bitter about it, but he couldn’t voice his complaints.

Opportunities were meant to be contested; he had no way to compete.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t agree with him. He retorted, “Your luck has already been quite good. Compared to those Great Yan Immortals who died tragically or those who retired, you can still challenge the tenth and even the eleventh waves now. Your journey has already taken you far enough.”

“That’s because they were too weak, it has nothing to do with me,” Si Tian’s expression changed, his voice sinister.

A cold glint flashed in Jian Wushuangs eyes. She replied, “Since you are aware of it, you should understand that your regretful tone is just a feeble excuse for your weakness. If you were truly powerful, how could you stand idly by and watch me exchange away the Candle Dragon Wings?”

Upon hearing these words, Si Tian felt a pang in his heart, unsure of how to respond for a moment.

The words were true; being weak was indeed a fault, a fact he had come to accept.

But when this truth applied to him personally, he was unwilling to acknowledge it.

“Thanks for the reminder!” Si Tian stood to the side, his expression easing, his voice neither humble nor arrogant.

“Have you made up your mind?” Jian Wushuang stared at him. If spending money could quickly resolve this, he couldn’t be bothered with any tricks or schemes.

Half of the treasure points were already a considerable amount—around six million or so. This would be enough to elevate Si Tian’s foundation to the level of a half- step Emperor, significantly stronger than he was now..
