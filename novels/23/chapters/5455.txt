Chapter 5454 ¬†Luxury

Ordinary Inheritors may not care much, but beings like Jian Wushuang, with the talent to rival a tier 4 Emperor while still in the Dao Lord realm, had the potential to reach the level of an invincible Emperor in the future.

Especially Hu Qing, who had successfully merged with the Dao, had now directly reached the peak of the tier 5 Emperor. His strength was comparable to that of an ordinary tier 6 Emperor. In a blink of an eye, he was catching up with individuals like them.

In the battle in the Earth Realm, Shang had solidified his position as the number one Inheritor. Although Fuego had not fully recovered his strength, he was still the shell of a Universe Master. The fact that he could fight against someone like Fuego showcased Shang's immense potential.

Fuego was a figure who had destroyed the Three Kings Courts, an unparalleled powerhouse who emerged from the starry sky.

He had been suppressed in the ruins, and only with the personal intervention of Qishen was he subdued.

Others were simply not Fuego's match.

Now that Fuego had escaped from the ruins, he had probably reunited with Shen Ling.

The identity of Shen Ling had always been a mystery, but Jian Wushuang had a faint guess.

The infant hatched from the giant egg was likely Shen Ling!

Fuego came from the stars to save Shen Ling and was ultimately suppressed in the Three Kings Courts.

Now that the two had reunited, it was unclear what kind of disturbance would unfold in the future.

Whether it was the Shadow Sect or the Kui Organization, both were minions of the Shen Ling.

However, Jian Wushuang couldn't intervene in these matters. Let Zhen Ling deal with it alone!

Caught between Guangmu and Wu Zuo, Jian Wushuang could only tread carefully, not daring to offend either side. In the end, he followed Wu Zuo out of the temple.

After another teleportation, they had arrived at the Elder's Palace.

Guarding the teleportation hall was none other than Qiuhuang.

"Haha! I heard that you, kid, are still alive. I didn't expect to meet so soon!" Qiuhuang's face was filled with a smile.

Since his recovery, entering the Elder's Palace, and regaining his strength, Qiuhuang had gained significant benefits. He now controlled the teleportation hall and oversaw the entire teleportation array in the North Region. Qiuhuang also held a considerable amount of power and was a well-known follower of Wu Zuo.

In this venture, Wu Zuo had achieved great merit in the Earth Realm, and he might soon be promoted to Palace Master.

At that time, Situ Nan would ascend to Hall Master, and Wu Zuo could be transferred to the more prestigious Law Enforcement Hall, perhaps becoming the captain of the enforcement team, reaping even greater benefits.

Facing this familiar face, Jian Wushuang felt an unprecedented ease.

"Senior Qiuhuang, we'll talk later!" Jian Wushuang lightly smiled. He still had to pay a visit to the Palace Master later.

This was the Elder Palace, and it was natural to pay a visit. He planned to cultivate here for some time after gaining a lot from the Three Kings Court. Especially on the Transformation Dao steps, where he imitated All Things and All Daos, this time, he could reach the pinnacle of the eighth level in one go.

There was also the soul; the advancement of the soul level was crucial.

Next was the divine body. Currently, his basic divine body was too low, but with the treasure given by Hu Qing, his divine body would see a significant improvement.

Everything needed improvement, including understanding the Ultimate Dao within Gong Miao Yi's body and exploring the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard.

The chessboard was the strongest treasure he obtained, without a doubt. Even in ancient times, it could rank in the top three treasures, especially with its connection to Xuan Yi. He couldn't be careless.

Jian Wushuang had already planned each step of his cultivation in his heart. Once everything was settled, he would begin seclusion.

"You wait here for now; I'll follow Hall Master Wu Zuo to pay respects to the Palace Master!" Jian Wushuang instructed Palace Miao Yi, then followed Wu Zuo to the core island of Yuanyang Lake.

During the flight, he could see the Demon Sound Mountain from afar, bringing to mind Shan Jun.

Upon entering the Qishen Temple, he encountered many important figures.

From the beginning with the old man with the sheep horns, Qiuhuang, to later encounters with Shan Jun, and even Bai Junwang.

Bai Junwang had also helped him a lot, especially in terms of knowledge, giving him a clear understanding of ancient times.

Although the two had once plotted against each other, now that Bai Junwang had fallen, everything had turned into flowing water.

As they passed by the Demon Sound Mountain, he noticed numerous palaces and caves constructed on the mountain, with many people stationed there for cultivation.

The Elder Palace, at present, not only housed the former elders but also several Emperors from the Original Universe.

It had been 100,000 years since the Qishen Temple opened.

The tier 5 Emperors from the Original Realm had returned from the River of Time, successively entering the Qishen Temple.

Upon entering, Zhen Ling didn't rush them to the Grave God Mountain. Instead, he had them stay at the Elder Palace.

According to Wu Zuo's explanation, this was to comprehend a secret technique. Only tier 5 Emperors who reached the threshold would be arranged to go to the Grave God Mountain. V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

Moreover, to go to the Grave God Mountain, they had to find it themselves and couldn't use a teleportation array.

The super teleportation array leading to the Grave God Mountain couldn't be used without the inheritance token distributed on the mountain.

So, those tier 5 Emperors were now desperately comprehending the secret technique.

Knowing that to go to the Grave God Mountain, one needed at least tier 6 strength, they pushed themselves even harder. Fortunately, Zhen Ling wasn't stingy and bestowed many treasures and inheritances. The deeper they comprehended the secret technique, the more treasures and inheritances they could obtain to help them advance in cultivation.

Although it couldn't compare to the cultivation resources on the Grave God Mountain, it was still better than not coming at all.

Swish!

In no time, the two of them arrived at the central island of the Yuanyang Palace.

The last time they were here, it was still relatively ancient. But now, after merely 100,000 years, the changes here were nothing short of earth-shattering.

Stepping on the green stone slabs on the island, Jian Wushuang felt a sudden relaxation in his body. He instantly sensed a refreshing feeling, and his Origin Source became more active, making him exceptionally alert.

Not only was the construction extraordinary here, but the formations were also of the highest level, serving as both assistance and defense in an equal measure.

Walking ahead, Wu Zuo smiled lightly, "When constructing this place, it was based on the Dao Arena of a Divine Master. Every green stone slab you're stepping on was transported from the Extreme North Nine-Headed Dragon Mountain. Each of these slabs is more precious than treasures, valued at over 10,000 godstones!"

"10,000 godstones?" Jian Wushuang was stunned; this was incredibly extravagant.

A single green stone slab, just enough to accommodate an ordinary person, cost 10,000 godstones.

This small island wasn't small at all.

It spanned billions of miles in circumference.

How many green stone slabs must there be? Thinking about it, Jian Wushuang involuntarily took in a sharp breath.

Infinite in value!

No wonder the Guangmu Tianzun ridiculed; this was too luxurious.

Even the White Tiger Temple didn't indulge in such extravagance.

It made sense, though. The White Tiger Temple governed the Four Great Secret Realms, requiring substantial expenditures. The Elder Palace, on the other hand, received many resources tilted by Zhen Ling, and the North Region, this back garden, allowed for unrestricted harvesting. It served the several thousand Emperors, making it appropriately luxurious!

Though somewhat wasteful, upon reaching the main hall of a certain Palace Master, Jian Wushuang discovered that the trees planted outside the hall were ancient plants left by antiquity. They emitted an aura that could bring joy to one's Origin Source. If auctioned in the Four Great Secret Realms, they might not go for less than 10 billion godstones.
