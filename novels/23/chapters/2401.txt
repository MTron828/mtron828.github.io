Chapter 2402: Purple Amulet

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Inside the Saint’s Tomb, there was a deep yellow completely desolate land.

There was a flash of light before ten disciples of Narcissus Island appeared on the land.

“Is this the Saint’s Tomb?”

Jian Wushuang stood on the ground and looked around. He could feel the difference between where he was and the outside world.

The area was lifeless and lacked vitality.

“We have just entered the tomb. This is the outer area of the tomb. The Purple Amulets that are required to enter the Divine Power Ocean exist in every corner of the outer area, so we will stay in the outer area for a while to collect those Purple Amulets before going into the inner area for more opportunities,” said Zhong Yi.

“Senior Brother Zhong Yi, this outer layer is the largest area in this tomb. If we stay together all the time, chances of finding the Purple Amulets will be much smaller and even if we find them, it will be difficult for us ten disciples to share them all, so I think we should spread out for the time being,” said Su Tong, who stood next to Zhong Yi.

Zhong Yi nodded slightly. “Well, I think so too. However, the outer layer is also very dangerous and disciples of the other sects could come close to us. If ten of us are scattered out, we might be unable to face the dangers coming our way alone. It’s better to go in pairs so that we can take care of each other. As for the Purple Amulets, they found in pairs, they could share it among themselves.”

“Yes.” Su Tong nodded.

The other eight disciples also agreed, including Jian Wushuang.

In the outer area, it was wise for ten disciples to go out in pairs.

“Let’s start assigning the group now, Jian Wushuang.” Zhong Yi looked at Jian Wushuang directly. “You can come with me.”

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

The other core disciples all looked at Jian Wushuang.

They immediately understood that Zhong Yi’s move was to even out the strength of teams and at the same time, he was also taking care of Jian Wushuang.

Everyone knew that Jian Wushuang was only a Chaotic Realm. In the eyes of those core disciples, he was a burden. If he was paired with ordinary disciples of Second-Class Divine Demons their combat power would be weakened.

Zhong Yi was the strongest among them. If he was in the same team as Jian Wushuang, it’s possible for them to handle any risks or dangers that were thrown their way.

“Senior Brother Zhong Yi, I appreciate your kindness but I think I should still be with another senior brother. Brother Xiao Heng, how about you and me together?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Xiao Heng was startled, but he nodded without hesitation. “Of course, it is my honor to be paired with you, Junior Brother Wushuang.”

“Senior Brother Zhong Yi, I have joined Senior Brother Xiao Heng,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Xiao Heng, is it okay for you to be with him?” Zhong Yi frowned.

“Senior brother, don’t worry. I’m very confident that there will be no problems with Junior Brother Wushuang,” Xiao Heng answered confidently.

He was confident. He knew how capable Jian Wushuang was. It was indeed his honor to be in the same group as Jian Wushuang.

“In that case, alright. For the sake of safety, we shall still exchange our message tokens with each other and keep a close distance between groups. If there is a danger, I will immediately send help to the group. Understand?” Zhong Yi gave his advice.

“Yes.” Those disciples nodded one by one.

The five teams were sorted out quickly and they all exchanged their message tokens. The five teams then moved in separate ways.

Several core disciples gave Jian Wushuang and Xiao Heng a mocking glance before moving away.

“Jian Wushuang is really stupid. Senior Brother Zhong Yi gave him a chance, but he just let it go. How funny that he went off with Xiao Heng?”

“The same goes for Xiao Heng. He actually blindly agreed. He’s a Second-Cass Divine Demon who has just broken through, yet he went along with a Chaotic Realm. If they were in danger, who among them could ward it off?”

“Let them be. Anyway, they made their own choices. Even if they drop dead facing the dangers, it has nothing to do with us.”

Those core disciples were brothers of the same sect, but they were not very close to each other. If they could help, they would try their best. But if the other party was seeking death, they could not be bothered.

Just like the team of Jian Wushuang and Xiao Heng, they were obviously seeking death.

Little did they know that Xiao Heng was sneering after separating from them. “These idiots, they still don’t know how strong Junior Brother Wushuang is. They might regret it as soon as they found out!”

After everyone went their separate ways, Jian Wushuang and Xiao Heng chose one direction and went straight ahead.

On the way, Xiao Heng glanced at Jian Wushuang and asked somewhat restrainedly. “Junior Brother Wushuang, your divine power seems to be much stronger than before am I right?”

“Well, I broke through to the Peak Stage Chaotic Realm,” answered Jian Wushuang.

Xiao Heng mumbled to himself. “Sure enough. In the beginning, he was only in the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, yet his combat power was enough to match First-Class Divine Demons. Now that he has reached the Peak Chaotic Realm, his combat power must have skyrocketed. How strong is his power now? I am afraid that even Senior Brother Zhong Yi might not stand a chance if he fights against him. I wonder if he can fight head-on with the Twelve Minor Kings?”

Xiao Heng was speculating about Jian Wushuang’s real level of power, but he did not dare to probe further.

The two skimmed along the way and kept in touch with the other four groups. The distance between those five groups was not too far apart.

Half an hour passed in just a blink of an eye.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang stopped dead in his tracks.

“What’s wrong?” Xiao Heng looked over immediately.

“I can feel two types of special auras right over there. Let’s go.” Jian Wushuang turned swiftly and headed towards the void. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xiao Heng followed closely behind. Soon, both of them arrived at a barren mountain. As soon as they were there, Xiao Heng had also noticed the two types of auras.

At the same time, they also saw two streams of faint purple lights flashing from the top of the barren mountain.

“Haha, it seems like we are lucky.” Jian Wushuang smiled heartily.

“Yes.” Xiao Heng also showed a hint of joy.

The two advanced to the top of the barren mountain where two Purple Amulets were floating around.

Jian Wushuang sensed that those two Purple Amulets had a unique aura and went towards them.

“Purple Amulets. There are two of them.” Jian Wushuang smiled and with a wave of his hand, the two Purple Amulets fell right into his palm.

“Here, this is yours.” Jian Wushuang gave one of the Purple Amulets to Xiao Heng.

“Err... Junior Brother Wushuang, you discovered these two Purple Amulets.” Xiao Heng hesitated.
