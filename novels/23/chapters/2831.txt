Chapter 2832: Yin Su’er’s Ecstasy!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

After the battle ended, Yin Su’er held a huge banquet in Crimson Rock Castle.

The number of experts participating in the banquet was extremely large, and it was extremely lively and noisy.

And the main character of this banquet, apart from Crimson Rock Castle, was naturally the Sword Alliance.

In fact, during the banquet, the Sword Alliance’s limelight had completely overshadowed Crimson Rock Castle.

Everyone had already noticed this, but they were not surprised.

This was because everyone knew that the current Pill Sun Sacred World still seemed to be under the control of Crimson Rock Castle. All the factions had already submitted to Crimson Rock Castle.

But in reality, there was another faction in the Pill Sun Sacred World that was even stronger than Crimson Rock Castle.. This faction was the Sword Alliance!

Everyone who participated in the battle with the Heavenly Void World knew this.

However, the experts of the Sacred Sundan World could not figure out what Jian Wushuang had done.

After all, the Sword Alliance was now stronger than the Crimson Rock Castle. Jian Wushuang alone was enough to sweep across the entire Sacred Sundan World.

Under such circumstances, the Sword Alliance could completely replace the Crimson Rock Castle and become the new ruler of the Pill Sun Sacred World. However, judging from their previous performance, the Sword Alliance did not seem to have such a plan. To be exact... it was Jian Wushuang who did not have such a plan.

At the banquet, countless experts toasted Jian Wushuang, and at the same time, there were all kinds of compliments.

Jian Wushuang only responded with a few words.

After a day and a night, the banquet finally ended, and everyone dispersed.

In an exquisite attic, there were two tables facing each other. Jian Wushuang and Yin Su’er sat there, and on the tables were wine and fruits.

Besides the two of them, there was no third person in the attic, and the entire attic was covered by a restriction.

“Mr. Sword One, you helped me to eliminate the internal strife in Crimson Rock Castle and the threat brought by the four top forces, allowing Crimson Rock Castle to regain control of the Sacred Sundan World. This time, you helped me defeat the Army of the Heavenly Void World, allowing the Sacred Sundan World and Crimson Rock Castle to be preserved. I, Yin Su’er, will definitely remember this great favor. Let me toast to you.” Yin Su’er raised her wine glass.

“Alliance Master Su’er, you are too kind. I was just entrusted by someone to be loyal to him.” Jian Wushuang smiled, “In Saint Tomb, I promised Saint Crimson Rock that I would help you solve your predicament. Naturally, I will do my best to help you.”

“Father’s vision is indeed unparalleled. At that time, I could see that you have great strength and will definitely be able to help me in the future.” Yin Su’er smiled and said.

“In fact, I have agreed to two conditions of Saint Crimson Stone to help you solve the crisis that Crimson Stone Castle is facing,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“Oh, what is the other condition?” Yin Su’er asked.

“The other condition is that I will try my best to help you break through to the Immortal Saint realm,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What?” Yin Su’er was stunned for a moment, but then she smiled bitterly. “Father, you think too much. It’s very difficult for an Immortal Saint to be born in a saint world. Father was able to break through because of great opportunities and good fortune. Although I have some potential, it’s not easy for me to break through to become an Immortal Saint.”

“Besides, if you want to break through from a Peak Great Divine Master to an Immortal Saint, you have to rely on your own efforts. Mr. Sword One, although you are strong and powerful, it’s difficult for you to help me.”

“Your father asked me to try my best to think of a way for you. After all, without a real Immortal Saint in the vast holy world, it won’t last long,” Jian Wushuang said.

Upon hearing this, Yin Su’er nodded secretly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It was true that there was an Immortal Saint in each of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

It was because there was no Immortal Saint that the Pill Sun Sacred World became the weakest and faced the danger of being destroyed.

If there was an Immortal Saint, as long as the Immortal Saint did not die, the Pill Sun Sacred World would not be so weak.

“The condition of Saint Crimson Rock is indeed a bit harsh for me, but I still agreed to it. Moreover, I was lucky. I just got something recently that will be of great help to me in breaking through to the Immortal Saint realm,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What is it?” Yin Su’er immediately looked over.

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand, and a cyan elixir the size of an adult thumb appeared in his hand.

“This is...” Yin Su’er looked at the cyan elixir in confusion.

She had seen many elixirs in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, but she did not recognize this cyan elixir.

“This elixir is called the saint-opening elixir. Have you heard of it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Saint-opening Elixir?” Yin Su’er frowned, apparently thinking. After a while, she suddenly raised her head and looked at the cyan elixir in astonishment.

“Saint Ascension Elixir! Is this the legendary Saint Ascension Elixir?” Yin Su’er’s voice became extremely excited.

There was nothing she could do. This Saint Ascension Elixir was too shocking to her.

It was true that she had never seen the Saint Ascension Elixir before, but she had heard of it before.

It was a legendary elixir that could help those Peak Great Divine Masters who had been stuck at a bottleneck for a very long time breakthrough to the level of the Immortal Saint!

It was said that as long as a Peak Great Divine Master who was well-prepared had a little bit of potential, the chances of breaking through to the level of the Immortal Saint after consuming this Saint Ascension Elixir would be 30%.

A 30% chance of breaking through was enough to drive any Great Divine Master, including those Invincible Divine Masters who stood at the top, crazy.

Unfortunately, the level of this Saint Ascension Elixir was too high, and it was too difficult to refine it.

At the very least, no one in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow could refine such an elixir.

Not to mention the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, even in the surrounding areas of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, there was probably no one who could refine such an elixir.

Those who were qualified to refine the Saint Ascension Elixir were definitely top-grade alchemists. Alchemists of that level could only be found in the core third heaven of the absolute beginning divine realm. As for those outside the third heaven, they were almost impossible to find.

Therefore, the Saint Ascension Elixir was definitely legendary outside the third heaven. It was extremely difficult to see one on a normal day.

Even in the third heaven, the Saint Ascension Elixir was also very difficult to obtain.

But now, Jian Wushuang actually took out a Saint Ascension Elixir and placed it in front of her.

“Mr. Sword One, is this really the Saint Ascension Elixir?” Yin Su’er’s voice was trembling.

“It’s the real one.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

In fact, he did not know the Saint Ascension Elixir before, but since it came from Elder Gu in the secret realm, it must be true.
