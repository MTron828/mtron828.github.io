Chapter 138: The Leech

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang dragged An Ying into a cave.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang tossed him and his body hit the ground. An Ying immediately came out of the coma because of the pain. As soon as he woke up, he burst out, howling because of the pain.

Jian Wushuang walked to An Ying with a light golden elixir in one of his hands.

“This elixir is worth 200 points in the Secret Pavilion of Dragon Palace, now it’s a favor to you.” Waving his hand, Jian Wushuang made An Ying swallow it.

It was a panacea in Secret Pavilion of Dragon Palace. After taking it, An Ying would not die any time soon.

“Tell me, where are my father and aunt?” Jian Wushuang asked.

His father and his aunt, whom he cared about most, were taken away by Blood Feather Tower.

An Ying remained alive till now because Jian Wushuang needed his help to find his father and aunt.

“Your father? I don’t know,” An Ying?answered and shook his head.

Squinting his eyes, Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

His father was the first one who awakened his Sword Soul. Blood Feather Tower had sent lots of experts and slaughtered the whole Ji Clan in order to catch him.

In the eyes of Blood Feather Tower, his father was much more important than his aunt. Therefore, his father should be locked up in an even more secretive place.

“As for your aunt, hehe, you mean Ji Wuyue, right? I caught her three years ago and I do know where she is now. But, do you think I will tell you?” said An Ying, looking at Jian Wushuang with a sneer.

“I know you will not easily tell me, so I prepared something for you,” Having said that, Jian Wushuang turned his hand over, revealing a light yellow worm egg. It seemed that it was going to hatch a baby worm.

“An Ying, I heard that you are good with poison. Since the Heart-biting Poison in my aunt’s body was from you, you must know what this is in my hand, right?” Jian Wushuang said.

Seeing that light yellow worm egg in Jian Wushuang’s hand, An Ying changed his facial expression immediately and shouted, “A leech!”

“You are right,” Jian Wushuang replied with a slight smile. Then, he quickly shoved it in An Ying’s mouth without giving him a chance to speak.

An Ying struggled violently, but it didn’t work at all since his Dantian had been disabled.

After swallowing the light yellow worm egg, his face turned red and he desperately tried to vomit.

However, the leech egg had already melted in his body.

“The leech lives in the blood. Once it enters your body, it will immediately hatch, then begin sucking your blood. The first leech will turn into two, then two turn to four, and in the end it will hatch thousands of leeches.”

“They will swallow your blood bite by bite, then your flesh. Your body will be totally swallowed in several days.”

“That’s the real Body-devouring by Ten-Thousand Worms. Speaking of the pain, my aunt who was struck by your Heart-biting Poison should be suffering more than you.”

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s cold voice, An Ying’s face was suddenly pale.

Both the leech and Heart-biting Poison were ways of torturing people.

The leech was more horrible with regards to the pain, while Heart-biting Poison was crueler.

After all, Heart-biting Poison worked in the body step by step. It might last for years or even decades. It not only tortured the physical body but also the mind.

While the leech worked faster and more fiercely, only lasting one to two days for death to occur.

Before Jian Wushuang decided to attack the stronghold, he asked the woman who was in charge of Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace to prepare him a leech egg. This was the moment he had been waiting for.

“Damn it!”

An Ying’s face was still red and distorted. Apparently, the leech in his body had started swallowing his flesh and blood. The pain was strong and it didn’t take long for the leech to reproduce.

One turned into two, and two turned into four.

The pain he was suffering was increased by several times.

“Ahhhhh!”

A sharp pain he had never suffered before spread through his body, so painful that An Ying could not stand it. So he raised his left hand and tried to hit his head. However, Jian Wushuang stood beside him staring at him.

When he saw An Ying trying to hit his head with his left hand, a sword light flashed and An Ying’s left hand was instantly cut off, falling to the ground.

After which, Jian Wushuang slapped him in the face. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was a slap effectively controlled by Spiritual Power. Immediately An Ying spit out a mouthful of blood containing pieces of his teeth.

Jian Wushuang had slapped him and destroyed all his teeth in case he tried to commit suicide by biting off his own tongue.

“Don’t even dream about dying with me here these two days. Enjoy it!” Jian Wushuang smiled and sat down leisurely beside him, then he brought out a bottle of wine. He was just drinking.

However, An Ying lay sprawled out on the ground with his hands and feet waving, and his face was extremely distorted.

“Kill me!”

“Please, kill me!”

An Ying desperately implored him. But he said it unclearly because all of his teeth were destroyed.

Watching him coldly, Jian Wushuang did offer him any mercy.

He knew clearly that the pain caused by the leech was nothing compared with the pain caused by the Heart-biting Poison in his aunt’s body over the years.

What’s more, it was he who poisoned his aunt with Heart-biting Poison.

Nearly half an hour later, the leech in An Ying’s body had turned into eight.

The pain had already increased by eight times!

“Ahhhhh!”

An Ying roared crazily while suffering such great pain. He almost lost his mind. He couldn’t bear the extreme suffering anymore.

“I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you where Ji Wuyue is!” An Ying growled and said.

Then Jian Wushuang, who was drinking, turned over and looked at him.

“I will tell you. After that, please kill me.”

An Ying roared. He didn’t want to live anymore. He just wanted to die. However, he was not even able to kill himself since his hands were cut off and his teeth were knocked out.

“Tell me.” Jian Wushuang didn’t want to waste time.

“Ji Wuyue, she was locked up by the Situ family,” An Ying said unclearly.

“Situ family? Which one?” Jian Wushuang asked and frowned.

“The Situ family in Bashui Commandery, Situ Qingyue is their Master! Ji Wuyue is locked up in the mansion of the Situ family,” An Ying growled.

“Situ Qingyue?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression suddenly changed.

Situ Qingyue, he knew him and he also met him before!
