Chapter 1017: Retreat

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Numerous experts of the Black Python Clan retreated.

They retreated reluctantly with the bodies of the eight Dao Masters.

At the sight of this, the Rock Demon Clan cheered for the victory in great excitement.

“Jian Wushuang.”

God Hong led numerous experts of the Rock Demon Clan coming up to Jian Wushuang with tremendous gratitude and respect in their eyes.

In this world, people always respected the strong.

For people of the Rock Demon Clan, obviously, Jian Wushuang was such a strong expert.

“Thanks a lot!” God Hong said in a solemn voice.

He was quite clear that if it were not for Jian Wushuang’s help, his clan would probably have been exterminated today.

“Back then in the Ancient World, I was indebted to you. Besides, You’ve taken good care of me during these years. Certainly, I should pay you back for your favor.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “But it’s a pity that I couldn’t kill the Clan Leader of the Black Python Clan for avoiding later trouble, because he kept hiding behind, in a distance from me.”

“Now the Black Python Clan has retreated, but I’m afraid that they won’t let go easily.”

This time, the Rock Demon Clan suffered a great loss, but obviously, the Black Python Clan suffered more.

Eight Dao Masters had been killed by Jian Wushuang, which was enough to distress the Black Python Clan greatly.

The Black Python Clan would definitely take frenzied revenge if they were capable of doing so.

God Hong and numerous experts of the Rock Demon Clan all looked solemn. They also knew that the crisis had just been resolved temporarily today.

“Elder God Hong, the nine sword scars left by Sunrise Sword Emperor is of great use to me. Can I stay in the rift for another period?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Certainly.” God Hong nodded repeatedly and said, “You can stay in the rift, no matter how long you want. I’ve told them not to disturb you. By the way, since you are more powerful than me, it’s unnecessary for you to keep calling me elder, you can directly call me by my name or call me Big Brother Hong like Qing Bin.”

“Then thank you for your treat, Big Brother Hong.” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. Then he floated out of there and directly headed for the rift where the nine sword scars were located without talking to those experts of the Rock Demon Clan.

On his way, Jian Wushuang heard Gu King say, “Jian Wushuang, you’ve created the Aurora Sword Principle and the Death Shadow. The nine sword scars should be of little use to you now, but you said that you still needed to stay in the rift for meditation for some time. You do it for the Rock Demon Clan, right?”

“Gu King, you know me better and better after parasitizing in my body for so long.”

Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “I should help them through. The Rock Demon Clan has just suffered from a great loss, and the Black Python Clan won’t let go easily. If I leave at this moment, I’m afraid that the Rock Demon Clan will still be exterminated. In that case, I might as well stay in the residence of the Rock Demon Clan for another period. It won’t be too late to leave after the Rock Demon Clan completely recovered.”

“What’s more, although the nine sword scars are less useful to me than before, they are still of some use.”

Gu King groaned slightly without saying anything else.

Jian Wushuang returned to the rift again and continued his meditation upon Sword Principle.

Numerous clansmen of the Rock Demon Clan were uncommonly grateful and respectful to Jian Wushuang. If there were still very few Sword Principle Warriors who had complained that Jian Wushuang kept occupying the rift, now these clansmen expected him to stay there all the time.

It brought their clan much more confidence and benefits to have such an incredible expert in their residence.

In a grand hall on the territory of the Black Python Clan.

“Asshole! Damned bastard!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“We were so close to exterminating the Rock Demon Clan. Just at this moment, a Sword Principle expert showed up.”

“Where does the brat come from?”

Mo Lin, the Clan Leader, started to roar insanely from the moment he stepped into the hall. On hearing these roars, the experts of the Black Python Clan who stepped into the hall at the same time fell into silence, their expressions extremely unpleasant.

This time their clan had indeed suffered a double loss.

They didn’t exterminate the Rock Demon Clan. Instead, eight of their Dao Masters had been killed!

“Master Di Yan, I heard the conversation between you and the brat. You’ve known him long before?” Mo Lin asked, looking toward Di Yan.

Di Yan slowly sat down on a throne and began to talk after the hall became silent, “I met the brat before indeed. His name is Jian Wushuang. Although he’s just an Eternal Realm expert, his battle strength is comparable to that of a Rank Three Dao Master due to his bloodline or something else.”

“Over 20 years ago, I used to fight with him. Back then, he could barely survive in the fight.”

Di Yan described the fight with Jian Wushuang like this. But actually, Jian Wushuang survived in the fight with great ease.

He just could do nothing to Jian Wushuang at that time.

“Over 20 years ago, his strength was close to Rank Three Peak at most, but today…”

Speaking of this, Di Yan’s face suddenly darkened. He said, “Today he showed the strength which is definitely at the Peak Level of Rank Three. Even I was at a disadvantage in the fight with him. He has made an unimaginably rapid progress indeed.”

“Bastard!” Mo Lin said, clenching his teeth, “Our Black Python Clan has prepared for so many years and paid such a high price for it. We must not waste all our previous efforts because of him. We must think of a way to kill him or drive him away. Master Di Yan, do you have any idea?”

Di Yan narrowed his eye and said, “Jian Wushuang has tremendous strength as well as incredible defensive capability. It’s impossible for me to kill him by myself, but…”

On hearing the word ‘but’, Mo Lin immediately raised his eyebrows and said, “Master Di Yan, tell me whatever idea you got. As long as we can kill the brat and exterminate the Rock Demon Clan, we can negotiate no matter what price we need to pay.”

Di Yan forced a smile and said, “It’s not that we can do nothing about it if we really want to kill him. As far as I know, Jian Wushuang killed a Gold-clothed Deacon of the Samsara Temple before.”

“A Gold-clothed Deacon?” Mo Lin was stunned.

“Gold-clothed Deacons can be considered as higher-ups of the Samsara Temple. There are just a few of them. If any of them dies, it will be a great loss for the Samsara Temple. Since Jian Wushuang killed a Gold-clothed Deacon, the Samsara Temple won’t pretend that nothing has happened no matter why he did that.” Di Yan said with a faint smile.
