Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After coming out of the palace, Wang Yuan wanted to have a drink with his brother.

However, Jian Wushuang’s Message Token rang out at this moment.

He received a message from his senior brother, Xue Lingtian!

“Junior Brother, where are you now?” asked Xue Lingtian.

Jian Wushuang immediately answered, “I am in the imperial palace of the Tang of the East.”

“In the imperial palace? Haha, I am currently in the Secluded Rainbow Prefecture’s Silver City. There’s a huge auction here that will last for a few days. If you have nothing to do, then come here. I will give you your present, it’s something that will be auctioned here,” Xue Lingtian said.

“A present?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

In the Firmament Territory, each of his three senior brothers had prepared a present for their first meeting.

However, he had only received the gifts from Third Senior Brother Bai Hu and Second Senior Brother Purple Mountain because his Big Senior Brother Xue Lingtian had not obtained the item yet.

“The gift Senior Brother has prepared for me is in the auction?”?Jian Wushuang thought with some expectation.

His Big Senior Brother was powerful and distinguished, so a present that he prepared for ahead of time would be brilliant.

Jian Wushuang instantly refused the invitation from Wang Yuan and immediately headed for Silver City.

After passing through the wormhole in the Tang of the East, Jian Wushuang quickly arrived at his destination.

Silver City was originally very prosperous in the Secluded Rainbow Prefecture. At this moment, Silver City was hosting a large-scale auction which opened every thousand years. It was said that countless treasures would be auctioned, which attracted a lot of experts.

Some of the treasures at the auction even aroused the attention of Dao Masters, so Dao Masters would attend it.

The spectacular auction was crowded with people.

When Jian Wushuang arrived, the auction had already been in progress for two days.

Over the past two days, no less than 1,000 treasures had been auctioned, but the experts’ enthusiasm had not been dampened.

The auction site was divided into two layers. The exhibition platform was on the first floor, surrounded by lots of seats.

Most of the people who bid for treasures on the first floor were ordinary warriors. Perhaps a few powerful experts would hide in there.

The second floor was equipped with luxurious VIP rooms. The cost of renting one of these was 10 million Divine Gems per day.

Ordinary experts were simply not eligible to enter the VIP rooms.

Those who had an independent VIP room at the auction were usually supreme experts like Dao Masters or experts with a strong background.

Jian Wushuang appeared on the first floor while watching the black-robed host auction off a Secret Skill on the exhibition platform.

The Secret Skill was used for escape. Many warriors on the first floor yearned for it and eagerly bid, so it didn’t take long for the price of the Secret Skill to rise to 13 million Divine Gems.

Jian Wushuang took a seat on the first floor while thinking about the VIP rooms on the second floor.

“Senior Brother should also be in one of the VIP rooms, but I do not know which one.”?Jian Wushuang was deep in thought.

He was eager to know what Xue Lingtian had prepared for him.

The auction was still going on.

Treasures were presented one by one.

There were all kinds of treasures, such as magic weapons, Secret Skills, elixirs, and Natural Treasures, all of a high level.

Some treasures were extremely rare, so much so that they even attracted experts from the VIP rooms.

However, none of the treasures were useful to Jian Wushuang.

Even if there was something he needed, he was able to trade points for it in the Treasure Vault of the Blood Eagle Guard.

Time passed by. Jian Wushuang had been sitting there calmly and had not bid for anything.

In the blink of an eye, the remaining 10 days had almost completely passed.

Many treasures had been auctioned with only the last three treasures remaining.

Naturally, the value of the final treasures would be superior to the previous treasures.

Many Warriors’ eyes sparkled with eagerness.

The experts in the VIP rooms had also prepared for it.

The first treasure was taken out.

It turned out to be a rusty iron token with an ancient aura.

At first glance, this token looked ordinary.

However, when the experts in the VIP rooms saw the word “Heartless” carved in the iron token, their eyes lit up.

“This is… a token from the Heartless Palace?”

“Yes, it is, it can’t be wrong!”

“It’s said that there are nine tokens from the Heartless Divine Palace spread throughout the Eternal World. I did not expect to see one here today.”

“Haha, the Heartless Divine Palace has many great opportunities, so this token is quite valuable!”

“The first piece is this token?”

The experts who learned about this item were ready to bid.

The black-robed elder began to introduce the treasure. “Everyone, the first treasure is this token. It’s a token from the Heartless Divine Palace. With this token, you can enter the Heartless Divine Palace and obtain some great opportunities.

“Now, the auction begins. We’ll start at 100 million Divine Gems!”

The moment the black-robed elder announced it, the experts who coveted this token didn’t waste any time before bidding on it.

“100 million Divine Gems!”

“200 million Divine Gems!”

“500 million Divine Gems!”

…

After a while, someone bid 800 million Divine Gems, which was almost equal to all the possession of a Dao Master.

That price was soaring at an alarming speed.

“Heartless Divine Palace?”

Jian Wushuang frowned as he had never heard of it. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, since this token was great enough to make powerful experts bid for it, the Heartless Divine Palace should be extremely extraordinary.

The price of the token quickly reached 2.4 billion Divine Gems.

Once it reached this price, no one was willing to bid higher.

In the end, the token was bought by a person in the VIP room at a price of 2.4 billion Divine Gems.
