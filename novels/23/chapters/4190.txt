“Leave? Does your Blood Sky Palace not care about the past?”

“Hahahaha, who do you think I, the Ninth Kalpa King, am? A piece of trash that you can do whatever you want? What a joke!”

After saying that, the Ninth Kalpa King’s expression turned into one of ridicule as he said, “Blood Nether Emissary, I’m telling you, none of you are going to leave today. I’ll flatten the Blood Sky Palace one day!”

“How audacious!”

!!

“Impudent!”

In an instant, the nine Blood Nether Emissaries flew into a rage and shouted.

“All of you, come in!”

The Ninth Kalpa King sneered and put his hands together. In an instant, more than ten black chains shot out from the One Thought Divine Kingdom, rolling up the nine blood underworld envoys and the Ruler Silver Roc, and pulling them into the realm of the One Thought Divine Kingdom.

…

As time slowly passed, the most intense and spectacular battle in the Tarot Ruins suddenly became extremely quiet.

After about half an incense’s time.

Kacha kacha kacha.

The Ninth Kalpa King’s divine Kingdom shattered into pieces. Immediately after, six figures shot out from the boundary of the divine kingdom.

These six people were the Ninth Kalpa King, the Ruler Silver Roc, and the four Blood Nether Emissaries!

In the time it took for half an incense stick to burn, the Ninth Kalpa King had killed five Blood Nether Emissaries in succession under the suppression of the One Thought Divine Kingdom!

The remaining Ruler Silver Roc and the five blood messengers were in a sorry state. The Ruler Silver Roc only had 12 of his 36 golden spears left, while the five blood messengers’ black robes were torn apart, revealing five ugly and bloody faces.

“Run!”

The Ruler Silver Roc’s expression was extremely ugly. Just now, he had almost died at the hands of the Ninth Kalpa King. If he had not made a prompt decision to destroy the 24 golden spears, he would have died at the hands of the Ninth Kalpa King, just like the five unlucky blood underworld envoys.

This caused him to completely lose the courage to continue fighting.

With a wave of his hand, he released a red poisonous mist, and his figure quickly swept toward a place.

“You want to escape again this time?”

The Ninth Kalpa King had long hated the Ruler Silver Roc to the core. He was someone he wanted to kill, so how could he let him escape?

The Ninth Kalpa King took a step forward and was about to chase after the Ruler Silver Roc when he saw the four Blood Nether Emissaries charge at him with venomous eyes, blocking his way!

“You don’t know your place!”

The Ninth Kalpa King was furious. These Blood Nether Emissaries were like dog-skin plaster. They did not know life and death and did not know fear, which made him extremely disgusted.

Ruler Silver Roc turned his head around to take note of what was happening, and he could not help but gloat.

“Hmph, as expected, the heavens didn’t want to kill me, the Silver Roc!” He laughed proudly.

However, he did not notice that the direction he was rushing in was where Jian Wushuang was!

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes.

As Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, the darkness in his eyes gradually faded and he regained his clarity.

The huge black ball crumbled into pieces and turned into the black fog sword Qi, which rushed toward Jian Wushuang from all directions.

The Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince had already become two dried corpses!

Their eyes were wide open and their mouths were wide open. Their faces were filled with fear as if they had experienced something extremely terrifying before they died.

With ‘eternal night’, Jian Wushuang had killed two Ultimate Rulers at the unrivaled level!

Once this news spread, it would be enough to cause an uproar in the entire universe!

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

The snake-like black mist gathered in front of Jian Wushuang and finally turned into the blood-red Wuqi Divine Sword!

Jian Wushuang’s face was a little pale. He grabbed the pancake of divine weeping sword and panted slightly.

Instantly, his originally pale face seemed to have received some kind of replenishment, and a demonic flush surged up.

it was still too difficult for me to use this sword. However, its power is truly extraordinary. Jian Wushuang could not help but smile. He had only comprehended a little bit of ‘eternal night’, but he had already killed Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince. If he really comprehended ‘eternal night’ completely, how powerful would he be?

As Jian Wushuang was thinking, he slowly turned around and looked at the Ninth Kalpa King.

He saw a figure running toward him with all his might, his head lowered.

“Eh? Silver Roc?”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile sarcastically.

…

“Hmph, the Ninth Kalpa King is really terrifying. It seems that if I want to take revenge, I’ll have to wait until I break through to the Supreme martial artist level. the Ruler Silver Roc lowered his head and continued to fly forward as he pondered his next step.

“He definitely couldn’t stay in the Tarot Ruins anymore. the first thing he had to do was to leave the Tarot Ruins, find a remote corner in the universe, and stay there for 80000 to 100000 years. After this storm had passed, he would come out and look for a chance to take revenge.

“Victory was already in my grasp. If it weren’t for the Third Prince and Lord Zhennan, those two idiots, who couldn’t even take care of a fourth stage great Ruler, I wouldn’t have to run away now. A flash of hatred appeared in the Silver Roc’s eyes.”

Originally, he had already felt that victory was in his hands. according to his plan, even if the Ninth Kalpa King did not die, he would probably only be left with one breath. In the end, the guy who dominated the fourth stage came out of nowhere and reversed the entire battle situation with his own power.

Just as he lowered his head and was thinking about putting Jian Wushuang on his must-kill list the next time he came out to seek revenge, he suddenly staggered and stopped.

“What?” He looked up in confusion.

“Hello, Ruler Silver Roc.”

Before he could raise his head, a cold voice suddenly sounded in his ear.

Jian Wushuang looked expressionlessly at the Ruler Silver Roc, who had taken the initiative to come to him. The corners of his mouth pulled up into an indifferent arc.

“It’s you?”

The Ruler Silver Roc was shocked. He turned around to look at the Ninth Kalpa King, who was being pestered by the four blood messengers. Then, he turned to Jian Wushuang and sneered, “Good, I didn’t expect to see you again before I leave! Go to hell!”

Boom!

The Ruler Silver Roc took out a golden spear and shot it at Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Idiot.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. he did not even bother to use the Wuqi Divine Sword. Instead, he reached out to grab the Ruler Silver Roc.

The Ruler Silver Roc’s power was weaker than Lord Zhennan and the others. in addition, his divine power was almost exhausted after fighting with the Ninth Kalpa King. How could he be Jian Wushuang’s opponent?

In just a short while, Jian Wushuang grabbed the Ruler Silver Roc by the neck as if he was a little chick. The Ruler Silver Roc’s hands and feet were flailing wildly in the air as he roared in anger.
