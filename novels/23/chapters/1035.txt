Chapter 1036: Those Words at that Time

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Long time no see, Jiu Xiu!”

An extremely beautiful ray of sword light suddenly shone as Jian Wushuang finished speaking.

It looked extremely perfect as it sliced easily through the Void and appeared in front of Jiu Xiu.

Not only did it travel with amazing speed, the instant it shone, there was also a strong consciousness attack rushing toward Jiu Xiu.

Even so, Jiu Xiu’s expression just changed slightly as he met the attack face on; a gold ray of sword light came rushing forth.

“Why did my consciousness attack have no effect on him? And how did he manage to block my Death Shadow when it traveled so quickly?”?thought Jian Wushuang, feeling surprised.

Clash!

The sound of metal striking against metal rang out, as Jian Wushuang’s Death Shadow was blocked. Jiu Xiu’s figure had merely been knocked back; he did not suffer any serious wound.

“Jiu Xiu’s strength is much greater than what was described in the research material,”?thought Jian Wushuang, a serious expression on his face.?“Is my plan actually failing?”

He had long known that Jiu Xiu was the precious treasure of the Ancient Monster Clan and that he would have some moves up his sleeve. As such, Jian Wushuang had come up with a plan when he struck.

It was to disguise himself as a clansman of the Bone Clan who had been driven insane and was looking to fight Jiu Xiu to the death. He would first draw near him and then sprang into action, using his Death Shadow to behead Jiu Xiu when he was unprepared before subduing him.

As a Dao Master, even if Jiu Xiu had lost his head, he would still be alive as long as Jian Wushuang kept the Life Core in his body from completely disintegrating.

Everything had gone according to Jian Wushuang’s plan at first. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He had purposely exposed the aura of an Eternal Realm expert when charging toward Jiu Xiu, and as Jiu Xiu was unaware of his true identity at first, it gave him the prime opportunity to strike; what he did not expect was that Jiu Xiu’s strength was much greater than described. Most importantly, Jiu Xiu had been unaffected by his consciousness attack, resulting in his inability to behead Jiu Xiu at the very first instant.

“Since my plan has failed, I can only… use the most simple and violent method of resolving this conflict,”?Jian Wushuang thought as a glow burst forth from his eyes and his Killing Intent skyrocketed. He then immediately charged forward.

Since his sneak attack had failed, he would have to use brute force.

“Are you… Jian Wushuang?”

Jiu Xiu was first surprised and angry, but he felt more bewildered than anything else later. He steadied himself and fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang, however, was in no mood for idle talk. He brandished the Blood Mountain Sword with one hand, causing it to expand to a length of about 3 meters, before swinging.

An extremely ferocious sword light descended upon Jiu Xiu.

Not only was it ferocious, but it also seemed as though it could destroy everything in its path.

This move was a swordsmanship created by Jian Wushuang himself based on the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle.

It was different from the Death Shadow in nature. The move was forceful and mighty, destroying everything in its path. As such, Jian Wushuang named it the Heaven’s Bane.

Like its name suggested, its force was enough to split heaven and earth into two.

“This move…” muttered Jiu Xiu as he observed the strike. There was a flash of surprise in his eyes before the golden longsword in his hand began expanding quickly as well.

Whoosh!

He swung his sword too, the frightening sword light tearing a hole about 300 meters long in the surrounding Void.

Soon, there was spatial turbulence around the opening, and combined with the devastating Sword Essence, a huge storm began to form all of a sudden and it started to expand in all directions.

Both Jiu Xiu and Jian Wushuang were killed in Sword Principles.

Furthermore, both of them had unleashed their strongest attacks in a head-on clash.

Just as the two sword lights hit each other…

“Pfft!”

Jiu Xiu coughed out a large mouthful of blood and he began turning pale.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, had not experienced any impact; it was as if nothing had happened to him.

“Humph, your strength may have been greater than described in the material I acquired, but you’re at most close to Peak Rank Three Level. You’re still far away from being able to take me on directly,” scoffed Jian Wushuang, his tone icy cold. His voice reverberated throughout the space around them.

His figure had once again turned into a sharp sword and it forcefully teared through the rampaging storm, unexpectedly striking at Jiu Xiu again. Evidently, he did not wish to give his opponent any respite.

“How is this possible?

“How could Jian Wushuang be so powerful?”?Jiu Xiu thought.

He felt that it was incredible.

When they had met in the Ancient World, Jian Wushuang was as insignificant as an ant or even worse to him.

Then, he could have killed Jian Wushuang over and over again with just one finger if he did not have any scruples.

“But what about now?”?Jiu Xiu thought.

They had clashed head on and unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang had completely crushed him; evidently, his opponent was much stronger.

“How many years have passed?

“It was only 2,000 years, right?

“It just took 2,000 years for him to progress to such a level?”?thought Jiu Xiu as he opened his eyes wide.

At the same time, he could not help thinking about what Jian Wushuang told him at the Holy Emperor Palace in the Ancient World.

“Every dog has its day, so don’t look down on me just because I’m weak now!”

It was very simple and he had brushed it aside as immature and laughable, but now, it had a huge impact on him.

“It took him, an aborigine of the Ancient World, just 2,000 years to catch up with and even surpass me?” muttered Jiu Xiu.

“Jiu Xiu, I told you in the Ancient World that I’ll hunt you down and destroy you some day. Today, I’m going to make my promise come true,” said Jian Wushuang, his voice loud enough to cause the heavens to shake. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand came swinging again.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

One move came after another at an incredible speed; Jian Wushuang was displaying the entire range of his swordsmanships.

“You? You think you can do that?” retorted Jiu Xiu, his eyes turning red as well. There was also a hint of craziness in his eyes.

He did not have any intention of blocking Jian Wushuang’s attack, as he was very clear that he was no match for his opponent in terms of strength.

He was, however, not anxious at all.

He fished out a token just as the strike was about to hit him. He then immediately crushed it.

“Jian Wushuang, you’ll die no matter how you managed to improve your strength!” growled Jiu Xiu.

His face had turned extraordinarily sinister, and it even began to distort.

A bone-chilling power was unleashed the instant the token was destroyed.

“That’s not good,” said Jian Wushuang as his expression changed suddenly.

“Quick, retreat now!” Gu King’s growl rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang had retreated the instant he sensed the power being released, but it was guided by Jiu Xiu and had turned into a blood-red giant hand in an instant. It gave immense pressure to every living thing in the vicinity.

The skies changed color the moment the giant hand formed, and the Void collapsed in an instant.

It then began crushing down on Jian Wushuang’s position.
