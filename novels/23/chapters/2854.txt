Chapter 2855: The Great Divine Master

——

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the same spot, looking at the scene in front of him, but his mind was in a daze.

“This, this power is too strong!” Jian Wushuang’s body began to tremble.

The same sword move just now had only directly cut down dozens of towering trees.

But after activating the sword essence, it swept across and cut down hundreds of trees!

The difference in power between the two was more than ten times!

“I only activated less than one-thousandth of the sword essence, but it has increased the power of my swordsmanship so much. This…” Jian Wushuang was so shocked that he could not speak, but at the same time, he was ecstatic.

Of course, he was ecstatic. After activating the sword essence, the power of his swordsmanship increased tenfold, which meant that his overall strength had also increased by nearly tenfold, his battle strength had been at the level of Invincible Divine Master. After the Blood Mountain Sword was reforged, its power had increased dramatically, which had greatly increased his battle strength.

Now, because of the supreme sword essence, his overall strength had increased by nearly ten times!

With the addition of the two, his battle strength was much stronger than when he had fought the Marquis of Three Yin in the Pill Sun Sacred World.

“If I go all out and activate this sword essence, I’ll definitely be able to crush the Marquis of Three Yin easily!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

After a long while, he finally calmed down.

Suddenly, he raised his head again.

“The Blood Mountain Sword has changed a lot since it merged with my blood essence, and it has greatly improved my overall strength. However, I didn’t only get the Blood Mountain Sword, but I also got two million saint elixirs from brother Mo…”

“Two million saint elixirs. Such a large amount is enough for me to advance from a Peak Divine Master to something even higher. In this way, my strength will soar again.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone brightly.

Then, he returned to the cave mansion.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with an interspatial ring floating in front of him.

There were two million saint elixirs in the interspatial ring.

The average Immortal Saint was only worth about 500,000 to 600,000 saint elixirs. Only a rich Immortal Saint like Mo Tao could afford a million saint elixirs, the Immortal Saint, who was also the number one blacksmith, could afford so many saint elixirs.

These saint elixirs were of great help to Jian Wushuang.

“I’ve already swallowed a large number of saint elixirs, and I’ve already accumulated more than half of my divine power. I only need to absorb another 200,000 saint elixirs to make a breakthrough. These two million saint elixirs will not only allow me to smoothly make a breakthrough to become an Advanced Divine Master but also allow me to accumulate more than half of my divine power. I’ll be very close to becoming an Advanced Divine Master,” Jian Wushuang muttered, his eyes were filled with anticipation.

“Let’s begin…”

Without much hesitation, Jian Wushuang began to absorb the saint elixirs.

Two million saint elixirs was a huge amount. Even with Jian Wushuang’s terrifying refining speed, it took him nearly ten years to absorb all two million saint elixirs.

As Jian Wushuang had expected, after absorbing two million saint elixirs, not only did he break through to the level of a Junior Great Divine Master, but he also accumulated a great amount of divine power at the level of a Junior Great Divine Master. He was not far from a Senior Great Divine Master, it was not too far away.

There was a huge barrier between the Divine Master and the Great Divine Master. At this level, his divine power was nearly ten times stronger.

Now, if he used all his secret skills and fully activated the sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword, no one among the Divine Masters would be able to compete with him in terms of power alone. Even the Invincible Divine Masters would probably be far inferior to him.

Jian Wushuang was curious about the gap between his full power and that of the Immortal Saint.

Of course, he was just curious. He could not solve this problem until he fought with the Immortal Saint.

After reaching the great divine master level, his strength had reached a whole new level. However, Jian Wushuang regretted that his secret skills had already reached a higher level. It was almost impossible for him to improve himself as a Divine Master, therefore, even though he had made a breakthrough, the secret skills still did not change anything.

“It’s a pity that brother Mo had spent a lot of mind and energy to activate the Holy Heavenly Furnace in order to fuse the Blood Mountain Sword with my blood essence. He hasn’t recovered yet, and he hasn’t started to refine domain-type holy treasures. If I can get the domain-type holy treasure that brother Mo has refined, the power of my domain will soar again, and my strength will be even stronger,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

However, he was not in a hurry.

With his current strength, as long as he did not meet a real Immortal Saint, he could do whatever he wanted.

“There are still six years before the Dragon-phoenix list opens. I have nothing to do in these six years. Let’s continue cultivating.” Jian Wushuang quickly closed his eyes.

Six years passed in a flash, and Jian Wushuang set off for the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was located in the core of the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. It was located in a huge ancient mountain range and occupied an extremely vast territory.

The entire Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was enveloped by a huge formation, which was set up by several blacksmiths above the seventh-grade at great cost, as well as several Immortal Saint experts. It was extremely powerful. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This array formation was also one of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s strongest pillars. With the existence of this array formation, even the number one expert of the Golden Crow Nine Realms, the Bone Emperor, would not be able to break through this array formation.

With the protection of this array formation, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had been able to rest peacefully for a long time.

The huge mountain gate was majestic and magnificent. This was the only way to enter the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

Beside the mountain gate stood a huge stone tablet. The words ‘Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’ was engraved on the stone tablet. There was a Golden Dragon and a fire phoenix sculpture around the stone tablet, which looked majestic.

In front of the mountain gate, dozens of people from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were standing there, welcoming the experts who came to observe.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had arrived at the foot of the mountain.

Standing at the foot of the mountain, he looked at the ancient and towering mountain gate at the top. He could clearly see the sculptures of the Golden Dragon and the Fire Phoenix, and he could not help but feel a surge of emotion in his heart.

“As expected of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, one of the four pavilions in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. It’s really majestic and magnificent.”

Jian Wushuang smiled lightly and immediately walked up.
