Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The battle between Jian Wushuang and Tan Feng was striking and had attracted the attention of many warriors surrounding the Ninth Heaven Mansion.

When those warriors saw Tan Feng lose his life, and watched as his body slowly fell down, they all felt astonished. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After the astonishment, loud shouts were heard.

“Tan Feng actually died?”

“Nan killed Tan Feng!”

“It’s a big event, a big event.”

The numerous surrounding warriors were extremely excited.

However, Jian Wushuang appeared very calm.

A month ago, in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, Tan Feng was so strong that Jian Wushuang was unable to counter him even with his full strength and the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill.

But a month later, his strength had made major progress.

Once his cultivation reached the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, Jian Wushuang was no longer weaker than an average Saint Realm expert, regarding the sheer power he could release.

The combination of Road to the Underworld, Slaughter Domain, and Sword Sea suppressed Tan Feng and routed his Domain. Tan Feng could only display 40 percent of his strength, but Jian Wushuang was actually strengthened by the power of Road to the Underworld.

Tan Feng’s loss and Jian Wushuang’s gain.

In addition, as a first-grade magic weapon, how incredible was the power released by the Triple-kill Sword?

All those resulted in... Tan Feng being overpowered by Jian Wushuang, even though his Domain was at the second stage, which was a powerful skill that concentrated the power of the whole Domain.

Tan Feng was overpowered, surrounded by Road to the Underworld with no chance to escape, and then he was killed by Jian Wushuang in the end.

...

After killing Tan Feng, Jian Wushuang discontinued Road to the Underworld. After all, the skill consumed too much Spiritual Power. After which, he donned the wicked blood-red mask again before appearing beside Tan Feng’s body.

With only a wave of his hand, Tan Feng’s Interspatial Ring floated toward Jian Wushuang. He skimmed through the contents and smiled.

A month ago, he had no choice but to discard all his treasures and his second body, to gain a sliver of a chance to live.

But now, after killing Tan Feng, he not only regained his treasures, he also gained plenty of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid and treasure that Tan Feng spent his whole life collecting.

Tan Feng’s corpse was also stored in the Interspatial Ring by Jian Wushuang.

After all, it was the corpse of a Saint Realm expert. Tan Feng had already formed a saintly body, so his body would not be rot after he died. Jian Wushuang might have a use for it in the future.

After completing those, Jian Wushuang turned around and headed towards the Ninth Heaven Mansion.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A mass of experts from the Ninth Heaven Mansion appeared beside Jian Wushuang. One of them, a black-clothed woman at the Half-saint level, said, “I am Hei Lin, Mansion Master. We will go to great lengths to do whatever you order.”

The other experts from the Ninth Heaven Mansion were all kneeling in front of Jian Wushuang.

Tan Feng was the Ninth Heaven Mansion master. Now, Jian Wushuang killed him, so he was the new Ninth Heaven Mansion master. Those experts from the Ninth Heaven Mansion would follow his commands.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and waved his hands, gesturing for them to disperse. Then he entered into a secret chamber in the Ninth Heaven Mansion alone and Hei Lin stood guard outside respectfully.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat with legs crossed. A black long spear and a manual appeared in his hands.

He got Tan Feng’s Interspatial Ring, which contained many treasures, including Cultivation Methods, manuals, and elixirs.

Several of the treasures were so valuable that Saint Realm experts would be willing to battle for them.

But Jian Wushuang did not care for those treasures. What he valued were the two things in his hands.

This black long spear was a superior third-grade magic weapon with great power.

As for the manual, it was a superior second-grade manual.

“Those two things should be the reward from Holy Emperor Palace that Tan Feng received for handing over my second body.”?Jian Wushuang smiled secretly. Not only Tan Feng, even the Holy Emperor Palace believed he had been killed. But, he was still alive.

Now, the two treasures had become his for such a cheap price.

“Though the long spear is powerful, it’s useless to me, so I will swap it for other treasures.”?

Jian Wushuang looked at the black long spear. After waving his hands, Jian Wushuang placed the spear into his Interspatial Ring.

Then, Jian Wushuang looked at the manual.

Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt?

Jian Wushuang was startled.

It was a superior second-grade manual, which was appealing enough to make many experts of the Saint Realm crazy in the Nanyang Continent.

Then Jian Wushuang began to flip through the manual. One hour later, he had an astonished expression after closing the manual.

The manual contained a body skill called Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt. When it was used, the Force of Gale and Thunderbolt were combined, and its speed was like lightning.

“The lightning Tan Feng displayed should be from the manual.”?Jian Wushuang secretly thought.

The speed of the thunder light Tan Feng formed when escaping was so fast that it surprised Jian Wushuang.

Most importantly, when Tan Feng was being suppressed by the Blood River formed from Road to the Underworld, his speed could only reach 30 percent at most. However, the speed of the thunder light form was still astonishing.

If the skill was used while not being restricted, how fast would it be?

“The manual is really nice, but I don’t quite meet the requirements.”?Jian Wushuang frowned.

After carefully reading through it, he understood that Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt was most suitable for experts who comprehended Gale Origin or Thunderbolt Origin. If not satiate one of them, it was hard to master the manual unless the assistance of Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt.

Jian Wushuang had comprehended both World Origin and Slaughter Origin, with World Origin including everything between Heaven and Earth. However, it was not the same as comprehending Gale Origin and Thunderbolt Origin.

“If I want to cultivate this skill, I will have to get a Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt.”?Jian Wushuang secretly thought.

Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt was a really rare Natural Treasure that was highly valued.

Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt was the only treasure that could help an expert who comprehended other Origins learn Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt.

“Hei Lin,” Jian Wushuang said, spreading his voice over the area.

Hei Lin stopped guarding outside and came into the secret chamber. She said respectfully, “Master, what can I do for you?”

“Did Tan Feng order you to search for information regarding Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt?” Hei Lin nodded slightly and said, “A half month ago, Tan Feng asked us to find some Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt.”

“Have you uncovered anything?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“Yes.”

Hei Lin replied, “It’s said that the Lord of Ditian Prefecture found a Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt many years ago. After hearing that, Tan Feng met the Lord of Ditian Prefecture and attempted to trade for it. But something went wrong and Tan Feng failed to get it. He was even thrown out by the Lord of Ditian Prefecture.”
