Chapter 1783: Little kid?

After just a short while, an ancient spaceship descended in the Snow Sacred Land.

After descending, Jian Wushuang’s frightening Soul Power spread through the area right away and almost the whole Snow Sacred Land was covered by it.

At the same time, many higher-ups of the Snow Sacred Land became alarmed straight away.

A great number of figures then flew over from all directions and came to the edge of the Snow Sacred Land.

Among the people who had come, there were many experts from the Snow Dojo and Universe God Palace where many geniuses were gathered. Moreover, there were some experts from the top clans in the Snow Sacred Land. In addition, quite a number of the Snow Kingdom’s imperial family had come.

At that moment, the large number of cultivators raised their heads and they were looking at the ancient silver spaceship in front of them with a great amount of shock.

“Too frightening. This spaceship is really too frightening.”

“What a frightening aura. I feel that if this spaceship were to collide with something, many seals of the Snow Sacred Land would probably be useless.”

“Whose spaceship is this?”

Many cultivators present were gasping in admiration.

They had gotten information that a strong spaceship had descended. Hence, they hurried over right away.

“Master, your abilities are powerful. Have you seen such a frightening spaceship before?”

Among the crowd of people, a Golden Deacon from the Snow Dojo questioned the Master of Silence Gloriette.

“I have never seen this before,” the Master of Silence Gloriette shook his head and he was extremely terrified.

In actual fact, this silver spaceship had been obtained by Jian Wushuang from the Qian Kun Ring of the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s Sir God Chi Xing after killing him.

To date, this was the best spaceship that Jian Wushuang had come into contact with and it was worth no less than ten thousand Doctrine Gems.

Not only was the spaceship’s speed of travelling in the dark void shocking, it had powerful attack moves. Even if it were a simple collision, a Chaotic Real God would not be able to bear the impact. Hence, this spaceship could turn a mere Snow Sacred Land into pieces by crashing into it.

At that moment…

A big group of people was rushing over from afar and the person in front was a golden-robed man who was two meters tall.

“It’s the Monarch!”

“Even the Monarch is alarmed.”

Many cultivators present revealed a respectful expression.

When the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom came to the crowd, he saw the ancient silver spaceship which was floating in front right away.

“This spaceship…” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom revealed a fearful expression. After that, he cupped one of his hands in the other before his chest and his loud voice resounded across the universe, “I am the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom. I am not sure which friend of mine has come but I request to have an audience with you.”

The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom got off his high horse.

After his words spread, three shadows floated down from the ancient spaceship.

Among the three of them, the person standing to the left was a cold youth who was carrying a sharp sword on his back. The eyes of the cold youth were penetrating. Although the aura that he emitted was extremely rare among the Universe Gods of the Third Heaven, no one in the Snow Sacred Land was too concerned about it.

As for the person standing on the right, she was a woman with a beautiful, bewitching face. This woman had a humble expression and she was standing to the side respectfully. As such, she should have just been a maid. However, this maid was a genuine Real God.

As for the person in the middle surrounded by these two people with one on the left and the other on the right, he was a crimson-robed man.

Similarly, the crimson-robed youth was carrying a sword on his back. He had a gentle expression and he wore an indifferent smile. He was different from the two people beside him and he was not emitting any aura at all.

There was no aura at all and he was just like a normal person.

However, if everyone were to close their eyes, they would absolutely not discover the existence of this crimson-robed man. Instead, they could only feel a vast constellation.

It was as if he possessed everything in the universe.

Everyone’s eyes could not help but be fixed onto the crimson-robed man in the middle. It was the same for the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom.

Since the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom was able to become the Monarch of a Holy Kingdom, his abilities should have achieved the level of a Chaotic Real God. However, the instant he saw the crimson-robed man, he seemed to have seen an illusion. It was as if with a thought, the other party could kill him countless times.

Such a feeling had only been felt by the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom from one person before.

“Greetings to Lord,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom greeted respectfully right away. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Greetings to Lord,” many cultivators from the Snow Sacred Land greeted the person who had come.

Upon seeing everyone in front of him, Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically. However, all of a sudden, when he swept his eyes past everyone, he saw a person in the crowd.

“Oh, Master of Silence Gloriette? Long time no see,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“You, you are…” the Master of Silence Gloriette opened his eyes widely and stared at Jian Wushuang unrelentingly. A figure then appeared in his mind at once. It was a little kid from forty thousand years ago. That little kid had looked for him for the map to go to the Ten Sanctuaries.

In no time, the two figures were superimposed onto one another.

“You are that little kid from back then?” the Master of Silence Gloriette cried out in alarm.

“Little kid?” Jian Wushuang stroked his nose and he had a puzzled expression.

“How impudent!” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom berated immediately.

The Master of Silence Gloriette noticed that he had made an indiscreet remark and he asked for forgiveness at once.

“It’s alright,” Jian Wushuang waved his hands and he was not concerned at all.

At that moment, a figure floated over.

“She has come?” Jian Wushuang placed both his hands behind him and looked over.

The person who had come was a Taoist-robed married woman. As she walked over, every step contained special magic power.

The moment she appeared at the void, many cultivators in that piece of universe became completely stunned, as if they had become idiots.

After a long time, the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom was the first person to react and he shouted with respect right away: “Lord Tian Yuan!”

“Lord Tian Yuan!” Everyone in the area was dumbfounded.

The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom was the Master of a Holy Kingdom. In just a short amount of time, he had actually shouted “Lord” twice in succession?

Jian Wushuang should be a super expert from outside the Snow Kingdom. Hence, it was very normal for the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom to address him as Lord.

What about Lord Tian Yuan? Didn’t she come from inside the Snow Sacred Land?

“Tian Yuan? Tian Yuan Mystery Land?” the Master of Silence Gloriette’s eyes shrank abruptly. “It is rumored that the cave of a Lord is in the Tuan Yuan Mystery Land and even the Monarch needed to treat her with respect. Could she be this person in front?”

Without caring about the reactions of anyone in the area, after the Taoist-robed married woman appeared, she looked at Jian Wushuang immediately.

“You should be the little friend Jian Wushuang who has gotten into the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, right?” the Taoist-robed married woman laughed gently and modestly.

“I am Jian Wushuang. Greetings to Sir God Tian Yuan,” Jian Wushuang greeted.

“Little friend, you are being too modest.” The Taoist-robed married woman said right away. “Little friend has gotten into the sixty-first position of the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. With such abilities, even if there were three of me, we would still be defeated with a flip of your palm, so how could I accept a greeting from you?”
