Chapter 838: Investigation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Anyone who has been against the Tang of the East or is in conflict with the royal families, such as experts from the other three countries, will be excluded first.

“Those who come from the clans or have a close relationship with the clans will be excluded next.

“And finally, those whose identities remain unknown and can’t be tracked will be excluded as well.

“Any of the above can’t join the Blood Eagle Guard.”

After saying that, Asura was silent. He looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang also pondered silently.

He understood that the Blood Eagle Guard dealt with the royal families’ secret matters and the clans might be their targets.

As a result, no one from the clans could join.

It was the same for experts from other countries.

As for the last type, the unidentifiable people…

Jian Wushuang belonged to this group of excluded people. Blood Mountain was an alias. If they actually checked into it, they would find that this person did not exist.

“That’s to say, if I want to join the Blood Eagle Guard, I have to tell them my real name?”?

Jian Wushuang’s brow furrowed slightly.

“Blood Mountain, you looked worried. Are you one of the three types of people?” Asura spotted Jian Wushuang’s worry.

“To tell you the truth,” Jian Wushuang replied, “I’m not from the clans nor the three big countries. But, I have a grudge against a large force in the Tang of the East, so, I can’t tell others my real name or it might cause trouble.”

“Well,” Asura looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile. “Don’t worry about that. As long as what you have done will not endanger the royal families, the Blood Eagle Guard will not care about it. Moreover, they will keep your secret from others.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“I’m sure of this because I have a feud against a big clan in the Tang of the East as well. But as long as I will not endanger the royal family, the Blood Eagle Guard will accept me all the same. They will definitely keep secrets for me and will never let it out. This is a rule that has continued since its creation.

“This rule is as unshakable as iron, and no one can change it, not even His Majesty.” Asura smiled.

“If that’s the case, I don’t need to worry anymore.” Jian Wushuang was relieved.

He had been worried that if he told the Blood Eagle Guard his real name, the Xia Clan would find out and come to take revenge. Now, it seemed that his concern was unnecessary.

Just as Asura had said, not long after Jian Wushuang passed through the tenth floor of the Military Pagoda, a scarlet-robed elder came to find him.

The elder held a token from the Blood Eagle Guard, which confirmed his identity.

“Blood Mountain, I just learned that you have passed through the tenth floor of the Military Pagoda, so I came here to ask you if you’re willing to join the Blood Eagle Guard,” the elder asked indifferently.

“Of course, I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Record your name, background, and experiences in this token, and I will bring it back to the commander for investigation. If you pass the investigation, I will come to take you to the Blood Eagle Guard’s camp in person.” The elder handed him a token.

Jian Wushuang did what he had been told. Before he gave the token back to the elder, a Restriction appeared on the token, locking his information.

“The Blood Eagle Guard really does do a good job in guarding secrets.”?Jian Wushuang nodded secretly and felt more assured.

“Please wait in your camp. You will receive our answer in a few days.” After saying this, the elder left with the token.

For the next few days, Jian Wushuang stayed in his camp waiting.

Meanwhile, the elder submitted the information on Jian Wushuang and Asura to the supreme commander.

There were several commanders in the Dragon Guard, and all of them were top Step Six of the Eternal Realm experts.

In the Blood Eagle Guard, however, there was only one commander, and he was a Dao Master.

The Dao Master’s last name was Hong, therefore, the experts in the Tang of the East addressed him as Commander Hong or Master Hong.

Blood Eagle Guard was the royal families’ sharpest weapon, and each of its one thousand members was a rare talent.

Most importantly, to join the Blood Eagle Guard, one’s information had to be reviewed by this commander first.

After receiving the applications from Jian Wushuang and Asura, Commander Hong had some people track both of their backgrounds in person.

It only took a day.

In a scarlet palace, a handsome and indifferent, two-meter tall man wearing a red cloak was carefully reading the two reports he had just received.

The first report was about Asura.

“It turns out that Asura is the survivor of the evil Bei Clan, the man the Dongyan Clan has been hunting for.

“The Dongyan clan has a deep background in the Tang of the East. They were very well prepared when they wiped the Bei Clan from this country. However, Asura somehow still escaped from their hands.

“Over the years, the Dongyan clan has tried hard to kill him, but he, on the contrary, has grown stronger through the hardships. He has now become a Step Four expert and applied to join the Blood Eagle Guard?”

Commander Hong sighed in secret as he read the report.

A moment later, he turned to read the information on Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang…” As soon as he started reading the report, he could not help but widen his eyes.

“This boy is even more amazing. He is the guy the deadly Xia Clan is looking for?

“In the Blood Battle Arena of the Cercis Island, he wounded Xia Yan with three strikes. Then when he was on his way back, alone, Xia Yan tracked him with two guards at Step Six of the Eternal Realm all the way to the sea.

“There, they had a secret fight. The others only knew that Xia Yan and his two guards were killed!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
