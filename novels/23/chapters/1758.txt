Chapter 1759: Fearlessness

Ten days later, the Vientiane Tower’s Treasure Auction began as scheduled.

Just like the past, the Treasure Auction this time around had attracted many powerful, big powerhouses from the Sea Continent. Moreover, as the overlord of the Sea Continent, the Soaring Heaven King Palace had also sent experts over. Furthermore, the experts that it had sent over did not have low positions.

“Real God Xue Kong, I did not expect you to actually come to the Treasure Auction personally this time around.”

“Haha, Brother Xue Kong, long time no see. I trust that you have been well since we parted?”

“Greetings to Real God Xue Kong.”

At the site of the Vientiane Tower’s Treasure Auction, the person who was flattered and escorted by everyone was a gray-robed old man.

The gray-robed old man was Real God Xue Kong from the Soaring Heaven King Palace. He was not just an Elder who had a lot of power in the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Instead, his abilities were shocking as well and it was rumored that he could compete with experts in the Real God ranking list. Among the experts from the Soaring Heaven King Palace who came to participate in the Treasure Auction this time around, he was their leader.

While being flattered by everyone, Real God Xue Kong and some experts from the Soaring Heaven King Palace went to their independent rooms.

When they sat inside their independent rooms, they could see everything that was occurring outside clearly. At the same time, they could also see the treasure exhibition stage.

“The auctioned treasures in the Treasure Auction of the Vientiane Tower have always been outstanding. However, I wonder what treasures will be auctioned off this time around.”

“It’s a pity that the Vientiane Tower’s Treasure Auction has always had tight security. Even the Soaring Heaven King Palace has no prior knowledge on the treasures.”

Two Real Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace were having a random conversation. However, at that time, Real God Xue Kong snorted coldly, “No matter what treasures are being auctioned off by the Vientiane Tower, as long as it is something that catches the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s eyes, it shall be ours.”

Upon hearing that, the other experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace around him laughed.

Indeed, with the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s power and high-handedness, if a treasure were to catch their eyes during the Treasure Action, they would definitely be able to obtain it.

In no time, the Treasure Auction began and the first treasure was up for bidding.

The first treasure was a Real God-level Chaos Divine Weapon. Although it was armor used for defense, it did not catch the attention of the Soaring Heaven King Palace at all. On the contrary, experts from other powerhouses fought for the treasure for quite a period of time.

Time passed by and many treasures went up for bidding.

At the start, the Soaring Heaven King Palace was silent. Only the first twenty treasures had come out.

“Humongous White Sun Elixir. It’s something that is quite rare,” Real God Xue Kong muttered to himself and he spoke loudly: “One thousand Doctrine Gems.”

Real God Xue Kong’s voice spread across the area from the independent room that he was in and the whole Treasure Action became quiet at once.

The Humongous White Sun Elixir was valuable and it would be of some help to top Chaotic Real Gods. For its price, not to mention one thousand Doctrine Gems, if one were to come across someone who really needed it, even two thousand Doctrine Gems would not be considered a lot. If it were someone normal who gave the price of a thousand Doctrine Gems, someone else would definitely compete with him.

However, at that time, the Soaring Heaven King Palace was the one who gave the price.

In the Treasure Auction, many experts from each and every powerhouse or sect could not help but look at the independent room that Real God Xue Kong was in. However, they shook their heads immediately and it was obvious that they had already decided to give up on competing.

“One thousand Doctrine Gems, calling once!”

“One thousand Doctrine Gems, calling twice!”

The expert from the Vientiane Tower who was hosting the bidding competition was shouting loudly.

However, just as he was about to call for the third time…

“One thousand one hundred Doctrine Gems!” A deep voice could be heard abruptly.

“Eh?” Experts from many powerhouses and sects in the auction looked for the source of the voice immediately.

They saw that the voice also came from an independent room.

“The people in that independent room should be the people from the Thunder Rolls Palace.”

“The Thunder Rolls Palace? A mere Thunder Rolls Palace actually dares to compete with the Soaring Heaven King Palace?”

“Who knows. Perhaps there is someone in the Thunder Rolls Palace who really is in need of the Humongous White Sun Elixir badly?”

Some experts started to discuss it.

Although the Thunder Rolls Palace was a big powerhouse within the Sea Continent, there were sects which could rival, or were even stronger than, the Thunder Rolls Palace. Moreover, those sects were also interested in the Humongous White Sun Elixir. However, since the Soaring Heaven King Palace had given a price, they naturally gave up.

However, for the Thunder Rolls Palace to do this, everyone could only come to the conclusion that the Thunder Rolls Palace indeed had someone who needed the Humongous White Sun Palace badly.

In the independent room where everyone in the Soaring Heaven King Palace was, Real God Xue Kong looked in the direction that the Thunder Rolls Palace was and laughed apathetically, “The Thunder Rolls Palace has always revered the Soaring Heaven King Palace and they would absolutely not dare to oppose us. Forget it. It’s only one Humongous White Sun Palace. Since they need it, we shall give it to them.”

Real God Xue Kong did not lose his temper and he stopped bidding for the Humongous White Sun Elixir.

With that, the Humongous White Sun Elixir fell into the hands of the Thunder Rolls Palace at a price of one thousand one hundred Doctrine Gems.

The Treasure Auction continued.

In no time, another treasure caught the attention of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“Two thousand five hundred Doctrine gems,” Real God Xue Kong said right away.

All the powerhouses and sects in the auction came to a mutual understanding and gave up on competing immediately. However, from the independent room that the Thunder Rolls Palace was in, a deep voice could be heard again, “Two thousand six hundred Doctrine Gems!”

With that, Real God Xue Kong’s eyes squinted.

As for the experts of all the powerhouses in the Treasure Action, all of them were extremely surprised.

For the Humongous White Sun Elixir previously, perhaps someone in the Thunder Rolls Palace had really needed it. Hence, they had bid for it even though there was a risk of them offending the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

However, at that moment, for the second treasure that had caught the attention of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, the Thunder Rolls Palace still wanted to compete for it?

Would it be so much of a confidence for the Thunder Rolls Palace to happen to need both treasures that had caught the attention of the Soaring Heaven King Palace?

“Two thousand eight hundred Doctrine Gems,” Real God Xue Kong spoke again. However, that time around, his voice was a bit deep and low. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Three thousand Doctrine Gems,” a deep voice could be heard again from the independent room of the Thunder Rolls Palace.

Real God Xue Kong’s eyes finally turned ice-cold.

“Thunder Rolls Palace… interesting,” Real God Xue Kong murmured and he stopped competing.

As for the other experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace around him, their expressions were a bit cold as well.

The Treasure Auction continued.

The Treasure Auction was indeed held by the Vientiane Tower. The prices of all the treasures that they had taken out were extremely shocking and quite a number of treasures had caught the attention of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Moreover, every time Real God Xue Kong of the Soaring Heaven King Palace gave a price, the Thunder Rolls Palace would compete with him by giving another price. Moreover, no matter how high the price that Real God Xue Kong gave was, the Thunder Rolls Palace would always give a price that was higher than his.

The Treasure Auction was halfway done. During this period of time, there was a total of twelve treasures that had caught the eyes of the Soaring Heaven King Palace and they had also bid for them. However, for these twelve treasures, none of them fell into the hands of the Soaring Heaven King Palace in the end. Instead, all of them were obtained by the Thunder Rolls Palace.

The Thunder Rolls Palace had only obtained those twelve treasures.

In other words, the Thunder Rolls Palace would only bid for treasures that had caught the eyes of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. As for treasures that had caught the eyes of other powerhouses or sects, the Thunder Rolls Palace would not be concerned with them.

What were they doing?

In the Treasure Auction, the experts from all the powerhouses and sects were all extremely stunned. Some of them even cried out in alarm, “The Thunder Rolls Palace is really fearless!!!”
