Chapter 3207: True Saint Ranking

——

“Many forces and sects in the Third Heaven enter the Blood Wave Realm through the spatial passage in the Third Heaven. The spacetime where our Temporal Temple is located is extremely special and is not within the Third Heaven. Therefore, every time our Temporal Temple enters the Blood Wave Realm through the spatial passage on the Mirror Moon Cliff.”

“Most of the cultivators on the Mirror Moon Cliff are from the boundless sea and some of the major forces around the third heaven. Many of them are solitary experts,” Hunyuan Master said.

Jian Wushuang understood.

He had noticed that the hundreds of cultivators gathered on the Mirror Moon Cliff all had extraordinary auras. Most of them were at the peak of the Saint Realm, and there were even three Invincible Saints.

“This is just a space passage beyond the Third Heaven. The core of the Divine Beginning Realm is the Third Heaven. There are nine space passages in the Third Heaven, so there must be more experts gathered there. The quality will also be higher. Conservatively speaking, there should be thousands of experts entering the Blood Wave Realm this time.” Jian Wushuang was secretly amazed.

When Jian Wushuang and the others appeared on the Mirror Moon Cliff, there was a commotion among the cultivators on the Mirror Moon Cliff.

“It’s the Temporal Temple!”

“The people from the Temporal Temple are here. I don’t know the Principles Master, but I know the six people behind him and the cold man with a giant axe on his back. He’s Di Hao, who’s on the true Saint list!”

“Doesn’t the Temporal Temple only have five slots to enter the Blood Wave Realm? Why are there six people here? What’s the rank six True Saint doing here?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“A rank six True Saint wants to enter the Blood Wave Realm? Are you kidding me?”

“Humph, why not? The Temporal Temple is one of the three Freedom Alliances. Although only five people have entered the Blood Wave Realm in the past, if the Temporal Temple is willing to send six people in, so what? Who dares to say anything?”

“That’s true.”

Whispers rang out in the crowd.

Many experts in the crowd looked at Jian Wushuang and the others with awe and envy.

The Temporal Temple was a behemoth in the Divine Beginning Realm. Many people yearned for it to become an expert under such a behemoth.

“The space passage hasn’t been opened yet. Let’s wait here first,” said the Hunyuan Master.

Jian Wushuang and the others immediately stopped where they were.

Jian Wushuang was listening to the discussions of the surrounding cultivators. He could hear some of the discussions clearly. Most of them were aimed at Di Hao and Jian Wushuang.

They were talking about Di Hao because his name was big.

They were talking about Jian Wushuang because Jian Wushuang was only at the sixth level True Saint Realm. He was too conspicuous in the crowd.

“Haha, it seems that Di Hao has stolen our limelight.” Yue Yu laughed loudly.

“Nonsense, who told you that we are not as famous as Di Hao?” Qian Hongzi rolled his eyes at Yue Yu.

“Guys,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said, “I heard that they mentioned Di Hao many times and said that he was on the True Saint list. What is the True Saint list?”

“You even know about the True Saint list?” Yue Yu looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, you haven’t cultivated for long and improved so fast. It’s normal that you don’t know about it.” Qian Hongzi smiled, he continued, “Brother Heavenly Marquis, I have a piece of information about some famous Immortal Saints in this era. Take a closer look and you’ll know.”

Qian Hongzi waved his hand and handed a thick piece of information to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it and immediately began to read it.

“So many people.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed after a short while.

The piece of information Qian Hongzi gave him was hundreds of pages long. As he read it, he found that almost half a page of the information had introduced an expert. Adding up the hundreds of pages…it was equivalent to mentioning nearly 1,000 experts!

These nearly 1,000 experts were well-known in the Divine Beginning Realm, and their strength was astonishing. They were at least at the peak of the Saint Realm.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed. “This is…Dao Long?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the information in his hand. The first half of the page that he was looking at was the introduction of Dao Long.

Dao Long had helped Jian Wushuang in solving a siege by the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Of course, Jian Wushuang had paid a huge price to invite Dao Long because he had issued an emperor-level mission to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

The strength that Dao Long had displayed at that time was indeed very impressive. Now that Jian Wushuang saw the information on the report, he immediately understood.

“No wonder the Purple Cloud Pavilion could not do anything to Dao Dragon without the Principles Master. It turns out that Dao Dragon has already reached the Peak Saint Realm.” Jian wushuang smiled.

The Information Qian Hongzi gave him was obtained from the Temporal Temple and was extremely accurate.

Dao Dragon had reached the Peak Saint Realm 30,000 years ago, and his life-saving methods were very strong. He had lost to the Invincible Saint more than once. For example, the Purple Cloud Pavilion had sent the Invincible Saint to hunt down Dao Dragon, however, Dao Long had easily escaped.

In the Divine Beginning Realm, Dao Long was indeed very famous.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, you’ve been reading Dao Long’s information for so long. Could it be that you’ve had dealings with him before?” Qian Hongzi looked over.

“Yes, we have.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“No wonder,” Qian Hongzi said calmly, “I’ve also skimmed through Dao Long’s information. His strength is only average and he’s at the bottom among the Peak Saints. However, his life-saving skills are not bad.”

“At the bottom?” Jian Wushuang was speechless, but he was not surprised.

Then, Jian Wushuang continued to read.

The information of experts, including powerful Peak Saints and even Invincible Saints, appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

After an hour, Jian Wushuang finally saw the last part of the information, which was the True Saint list!

There were 60 pages of the True Saint List, with only 30 names recorded on every two pages!

“There are only 30 people on the True Saint list?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“There are 30 people. No matter which era, there will only be 30 names on the True Saint list. These 30 names should be the strongest 30 Immortal Saints of this era, and they are ranked according to their strength,” Qian Hongzi said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and then looked forward from the bottom of the list.

“The 30th on the True Saint List is….An Luo from the Void Heaven Sect!”
