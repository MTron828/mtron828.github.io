Chapter 1508: Fight A Pitched Battle

Wow!

A total of eighteen shadows and every one of them was as swift as a ghost. Jian Wushuang’s figure instantly appeared before Universe God Xiong Fu and a crimson sword light slashed at his skull.

The speed was really too fast.

One who was as strong as Universe God Xiong Fu could only swing out the huge ax in a flurry to block.

Dang!

A loud noise and the eighteen shadows were cast out again. Jian Wushuang appeared behind Universe God Xiong Fu again and wielded his sword at lightning speed again.

Jian Wushuang’s speed and martial art motion exploded. He moved around Universe God Xiong Fu and constantly performed Sword Principles to attack Universe God Xiong Fu’s vital parts.

Although Universe God Xiong Fu was powerful, dealing with such creepy martial art motion at such speed, he could only think of ways to block Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principle attack for the time being. He looked like he was in a fix.

“Bastard!”

There was an angry roar and there was fire churning in Universe God Xiong Fu’s eyes. However, there was a soaring rage that flowed from his body suddenly. He was like a living beast. An enormous amount of divine power concentrated in the huge ax in his hands. Suddenly, the two huge axes swung out and the surrounding void was covered in the ax shadow.

He only wanted to pressure me with force!

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold and he wielded Blood Mountain Sword suddenly. It collided with the two axe’s shadows. Under the attack of the divine power, he took a few steps back. However, the moment he steadied himself, the figure plunged out again.

“Want to suppress me by relying on force itself? You must be dreaming!” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold.

He used the Power of Spacetime and burst his martial art motion entirely. Universe God Xiong Fu couldn’t catch up to his speed at all. Hence, Universe God Xiong Fu wanted to rely on his strength to forcefully fight him off till he became heavily injured. Just like the saying, one force loses ten strokes.

However, Universe God Xiong Fu didn’t know that Jian Wushuang might not be able to compare favorably with him in terms of power but they weren’t too far apart. Merely a small difference in power and he intended to suppress Jian Wushuang, it was impossible. Plus, even if Jian Wushuang were to be fought off, he would plunge forward again the very next moment.

“Your martial art motion, speed, and even close combat power, are far behind me. You are only slightly stronger in terms of strength. How dare you behave so recklessly before me? Just stand here and be my living target!” Jian Wushuang roared. His figure moved creepily and then appeared by Universe God Xiong Fu’s side. Blood Mountain Sword turned into a flowing light and stabbed into Universe God Xiong Fu’s chest.

Such a creepy martial art motion, such a tricky angle, Universe God Xiong Fu couldn’t wield his huge axe to block, but the black armor covered his whole body and the black armor let out a dim light. Blood Mountain Sword stabbed the black armor and it only left a white mark on the black armor which disappeared really quickly.

“Real God Chaos Unique Treasure?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He was a disciple of Star Palace from Lineage of Star. He had completed the Ultimate Disciple Task and he received Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor as a bonus reward.

On the other hand, Universe God Xiong Fu was Heaven Axe Divine Palace’s most outstanding disciple. Heaven Axe Divine Palace wasn’t much weaker compared to Lineage of Star. It was only right and proper that he had a Real God Chaos Unique Treasure on him.

However, even with the black armor protecting his body, part of the force contained in Jian Wushuang’s stroke spread to Universe God Xiong Fu’s divine body and caused him some damage.

Swoosh!

Universe God Xiong Fu retreated at high speed due to the impact. As he retreated, he looked over at Jian Wushuang with eyes full of rage.

“Jian Wushuang, I belittled you. You already have the fighting power to be listed in the top ten of Universe God ranking list, that’s really impressive,” Universe God Xiong Fu roared, “You and I have not much difference in power. If we were to continue to fight, it’d be meaningless. Excuse me for not keeping you company.”

As he spoke, Universe God Xiong Fu turned into a cloud of black light and prepared to leave.

But he had yet to move and he saw an enormous amount of blazing quicksand coming towards him. Although the formed realm wouldn’t have much effect on him, his speed was affected.

“Jian Wushuang, you want to waste time?” Universe God Xiong Fu had anger boiling in him.

“Waste time? I don’t think so,” Jian Wushuang’s murderous intention soared.

“You have guts. You really thought I was afraid of you?!”

Universe God Xiong Fu bellowed and his figure shook. Suddenly, he grew to three meters tall. A boundless divine power soared in madness. Universe God Xiong Fu kept one of his huge axes and held another axe with both his hands. He raised it up.

The moment he raised it up, there was immediately an imposing black axe shadow in the void above.

The black axes formed one after another. With one glance, there were more than a hundred of them.

Hundreds of black axe shadows floated. Along with a chilly gleam from Universe God Xiong Fu, the hundreds of black axe shadows gathered. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Serene Divine Axe!”

Hualala.

An earth-shattering stroke suddenly swung out.

The moment the axe shadow appeared, the entire void quivered. There were cracks that formed on the ground from nowhere, just like a spreading spiderweb.

Jian Wushuang could feel the power that the ax contained and he didn’t dare to act recklessly.

“Ninth Heaven Stroke!”

Both were eruptions of strongest divine power but Jian Wusahung was performing the most powerful Ninth Heaven Stroke out of the three Real God unique skill that he had created.

A supreme Sword Intention soared and Nemesis Sword from above Ninth Heaven appeared in the air. It then collided with the ferocious black ax shadow directly.

Rumble!

There was a loud rumble, as though the sky was collapsing and the earth was shattering.

The black axe shadow contained a terrifying force, obviously a notch stronger than the Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang had cast, Nemesis Sword.

“Humph, to be able to die by my strongest unique skill, you should be proud,” Universe God Xiong Fu looked a little pale. It was obvious that it wasn’t easy for him to perform the technique.

But then… Swoosh! The black divine storm was suddenly pierced. A ghastly figure plunged out and suddenly charged before Universe God Xiong Fu in an instant again.

“How is it possible?”

Universe God Xiong Fu was shocked.

He already saw the ghastly figure belonged to Jian Wushuang but he never thought that Jian Wushuang would be able to do such a thing.

“He wasn’t injured at all?” Universe God Xiong Fu looked on in disbelief.

But he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang also had a Real God Chaos Unique Treasure protecting his body and he had cultivated one of the secret skills of Lineage of Star, Xuan Mie Golden Body. His divine body could be compared favorably with a Real God’s.

After the earlier axe stroke broke Ninth Heaven Stroke, it had already expended half of its power. The remaining power pounded against Jian Wushuang’s body. After the tremendous weakening via Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor, there was only a very slight bit of power left. Jian Wushuang blocked it easily with his divine body alone.
