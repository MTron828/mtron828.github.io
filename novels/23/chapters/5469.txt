Chapter 5468 ¬†Easily Breaking the Enemy

"Ah, it's not surprising. After all, he is a master of the Shadow Dao. In his spatial domain, the Origin Source of the Shadow Dao thrives, making him faster than others, which is normal."

From the words of these people, Jian Wushuang learned about the Myriad Domain Shadow Slaughter Formation, the supreme technique of a super sect in the river of time and space.

After the sect's destruction, its legacy remained in the river of time and space.

Discovered countless epochs ago, it was considered a super inheritance. Though not as grand as the Qishen Temple, it contained a technique that was truly extraordinary.

It was the 'Domain'.

Domains were divided into two types: Shadow and Escape. n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

The man named Wanyan cultivated the inheritance of the Shadow lineage.

Reaching the level of Myriad Shadows was already a Great Accomplishment realm.

No wonder he dared to challenge the Demon Sound Hall.

Countless shadowy figures besieged a silver-armored guard, quickly shattering it. Following the same method, they broke through one after another.

If it were at the level of a thousand shadows, it probably wouldn't have broken through one, and he himself wouldn't have held up. But reaching the level of Myriad Shadows was a qualitative change.

His success also enlightened others. Instead of trying to break through the realms, it was better to cultivate their own supreme techniques or secret arts to perfection or the Great Accomplishment realm. That way, they could also overcome the challenges.

Splash!

This time, a bubble emerged from the Demon Sound Hall, enveloping Wanyan as he entered it.

Many people watched with envy. Just as they were discussing, Jian Wushuang also approached the entrance of the Demon Sound Hall.

"Hmm?"

"He's also going to challenge it?"

"Jian Wushuang? A poor little guy who got the token early, but it doesn't represent his strength!"

Many people just took a glance and then closed their eyes to continue cultivation.

None of them believed that Jian Wushuang could make it through.

Not to mention them, even Jian Wushuang himself had no confidence. However, since he had come, he couldn't just stand by. Indeed, shortly after his arrival, he witnessed two people successfully breaking through.

He felt an itch in his hands as he watched. Casually tossing the token, Jian Wushuang waited quietly for the guards to revive.

Buzz!

His aura began to rise, and his divine body, originally at 49,000-fold, soared directly to 50,000-fold.

With the current Beast God Weapon, the maximum amplification was up to 50,000-fold, even though his basic divine body was already 49,000-fold.

The current limit of the Beast God Weapon was 50,000-fold, and in order to further increase it, he needed to restore its previous power.

As for the divine techniques of the divine body, they were even rarer. Some of the divine techniques circulating in the Four Great Secret Realms could reach a maximum of 50,000-fold.

Those exceeding 50,000-fold were rare supreme techniques that he couldn't buy.

If only Bai Junwang were still alive. Bai Junwang's divine body alone had 68,000-fold, and his divine techniques were probably between 70,000-fold to 80,000-fold, enough for him to cultivate to the supreme-peak l evel.

Unfortunately, Bai Junwang had fallen.

Facing tier 6 Emperors, and six of them at that, Jian Wushuang's greatest reliance was his divine body.

A 50,000-fold divine body allowed him to contend with tier 6 Emperors, but only at the level of contention.

"Hmm!" Jian Wushuang hesitated. He noticed that these puppets were still not reviving, and it had been about three breaths.

Could it be that Just now, Wanyan damaged them?

It didn't seem likely!

These puppets looked new, and before their revival, although he couldn't sense their aura, they showed no change from their appearance compared to the past.

On the silver armor, there was still an ancient inscription 'Xuan'.

It should be forged by Xuanwu (Black Tortoise) Temple.

The quality should not be bad.

Swish!

The six silver shadows disappeared instantly, precisely the silver-armored guards standing in front of the door.

Jian Wushuang almost took action but found that these guards returned to the Demon Sound Hall.

This scene puzzled him. What was going on?

Did the silver-armored guards just leave like that?

Was it because they didn't let him proceed?

Or was it because his strength was too low, and they thought it was a waste of time?

Jian Wushuang's current combat power was indeed average. He could match an ordinary tier 6 Emperor in the Four Great Secret Realms, but in terms of true strength, any of these old guys on the mountaintop could easily defeat him.

However, he possessed a divine body with a power 50,000-fold that of an ordinary being. Regardless, they shouldn't underestimate him like this.

For a moment, Jian Wushuang felt awkward, standing in place, unsure whether to leave or stay.

The token was still inside; he couldn't just leave like this!

At least return the token to him!

Inside, there was even a strand of the universe's Origin Source.

Just as Jian Wushuang hesitated, the six silver figures appeared again, fully restored.

Phew!

Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief.

Now that they were restored, he didn't feel too worried. He raised his hand, and the sky was filled with Sword Qi. His divine body also swelled, increasing over 10,000 feet.

Crack!

Just as he started, before the Sword Qi could even fill the air, those silver-armored puppets had already shattered.

Looking at the scattered fragments, Jian Wushuang was stunned!

Is this it?

Weren't these puppets tier 6 in strength?

How did they become so weak that they couldn't withstand a single blow? He didn't even sense a strong aura, and yet these puppets shattered.

Not waiting for him to think too much, a bubble enveloped him, directly entering the interior of the Demon Sound Hall.

On the mountaintop.

Originally paying no attention, everyone opened their eyes one after another. When they saw the Demon Sound Hall, there were only fragments outside the door, and there was no trace of Jian Wushuang!

"This... how is this possible?"

Everyone gasped in shock, getting up one after another.

Emperor Zhutian walked to the forefront. Looking at the fragments all over the ground, he couldn't believe that Jian Wushuang had actually broken through.

The impression Jian Wushuang gave him was clearly only at the peak-level tier 5. In terms of cultivation realm, he was not stronger than them at all. His divine body was only somewhat special, reaching 50,000-fold, and they just thought Jian Wushuang entered the Qishen Temple early and got more treasures.

But in terms of cultivation realm, it was a fact.

Their cultivation realm was almost reaching the power of the black hole realm, at 90 percent.

Jian Wushuang was only around 80 percent, a significant difference. As for profound and supreme techniques, he hadn't seen anything, and yet, Jian Wushuang was gone.

Strange!

Not only were these people shocked, but Jian Wushuang was also surprised. He passed through with just a lift of his hand; this was too easy.

Whoosh!

Back to Jian Wushuang.

The void tore, and he entered the Demon Sound Hall.

He was very familiar with this space. Wasn't this the Demon-Sealing Space?

Dark, pitch-black, desolate.

Entering slowly, Jian Wushuang's mind was stirred. The place was the same, but there had been significant changes, changes in the aura, giving him a cold and indifferent feeling.

In the dark space, only one place had light.

In the light and shadow, a figure sat cross-legged. The face couldn't be seen clearly, but Jian Wushuang saw the universe from that figure‚Äîa unique temperament of the universe realm.

This person was formidable enough to reach the universe realm, and Jian Wushuang couldn't see through him. This person should be the Demon Sound Divine General.

"For a Dao Lord like you to easily gain the recognition of the Origin Source of the universe is impressive!"

A long and narrow voice accompanied the Demon Sound transmission. Jian Wushuang listened carefully and quickly bowed.

This guy was indeed a big shot.
