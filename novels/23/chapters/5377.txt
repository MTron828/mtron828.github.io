Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hu Qing had become acquainted with Long Yi’s teachings on Wuliang

Mountain, and their relationship with Zhen Ling made them quite familiar.

Jian Wushuang, also an inheritor like Hu Qing, was unfamiliar with the Lord Long Yi.

It was only through Bai Junwangs reminder that Jian Wushuang became aware of the identity of the person in question.

“Azure Dragon Temple Master, Lord Long Yi!” Jian Wushuang murmured to himself, then thought of Lord Zhu Yi and Lord Bai Yi.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Black Tortoise Temple Master!

Jian Wushuangs gaze changed dramatically.

“Xuanwu Yi… Xuan Yi!”

How could this be possible?

After Xuan Yi t s disappearance, he had entered the Great Domain to search for clues about his teacher, Xuan Yi. However, the clues left on the turtle shell were sealed, and they were later destroyed in the Great Desolate Wilderness. He completely lost the trail.

Now, thinking of this name again, his expression changed drastically.

Unexpectedly, Teacher Xuan Yi was actually one of the Temple Masters in the Qishen Temple.

Of course, this was just speculation, and he couldn’t guarantee if they shared the same name.

When he first learned about Temple Masters Zhu Yi and Bai Yi, he had considered this possibility, but he didn’t dare to confirm. What if the Azure Dragon, Lord Qinglong was named Qing Yi, and the Black Tortoise, Lord Xuanwu was called Wu Yi?

“What is his strength like? Is he here in his true form or his avatar form?” Jian Wushuang was curious. Back then, the avatar form of Lord Bai Yi could almost match Bai Junwang and had nearly won.

If it was his true form, Bai Junwang would probably be in trouble.

Bai Junwang held his breath at this moment and answered cautiously, “It’s his true form, and I’ve heard from the spirits that he is the leader of the four temples. I’m afraid I wouldn’t last more than three moves against him at my peak! ”

“So strong!” Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised.

Or perhaps, Bai Junwang was too weak?

Back then, the divine envoy ‘Guangmu Tianzun’ was one of the 108 envoys under the Qishen Temple, ranking in the top few hundred among the tier 6 Emperors in the ancient river of time. He was not even a match for Bai Junwang.

It could be imagined how powerful Bai Junwangs peak was.

He couldn’t even withstand three moves in the hands of Lord Long Yi; one could only imagine how formidable Long Yi had become.

He had heard of the most extraordinary Emperor, the legendary Emperor Jueyun, a figure standing at the end of time. Perhaps only that person could be compared to Long Yi.

Outside the city, the winds howled, and clouds surged!

Before Patriarch Xia Mang could speak, Lord Long Yi across from him couldn’t help but praise the grand formation of the imperial city.

“This formation is quite interesting. I almost feel embarrassed to destroy it!” He spoke arrogantly.

Patriarch Xia Mang remained serious, but the eunuch on his side chuckled strangely, his voice eerie.

Patriarch Xia Mangs gaze was steady, his aura hidden but formidable. He calmly said, “Friend, I wonder what brings you to our Great Xia. If you need assistance, feel free to speak!”

“Quite easygoing, actually. It has nothing to do with you. I’m just here to find a group of people and take back the treasures they shouldn’t have.” Long Yi spoke casually, causing a change in Xia Mangs expression.

He thought Long Yi was referring to the map. If it was about retrieving the map, then the other party’s identity must be related to Grave God Mountain.

At this thought, Xia Mang couldn’t afford to be careless.

He had long known that the map was a hot potato and dared not acquire it. Now, someone had come looking for it, but he also couldn’t afford to let them in. If they made a move within the imperial city, the capital of Great Xia would be in jeopardy.

“Sir, can you give me face and leave the city? I won’t interfere once you’re outside! ”

However, Longyi shook his head. “No, there are too many people outside the city. It’s too troublesome to catch them one by one!”

Xia Mang felt a bit at a loss. Although he was confident in the grand formation, he didn’t want to offend the other party. In the realm, he might not fear the temple’s people, but if the other party was from Grave God Mountain, he couldn’t afford to offend them.

People unafraid of the Qishen Temple are mostly solitary tier 6 Emperors, unburdened and fearless.

But for him and his family, they dare not confront it head-on.

With wolves in front and tigers behind!

He was momentarily at a loss.

“This makes it difficult for me!” Patriarch Xia Mang finally shook his head, evidently unwilling to let the other party in.

Long Yi, however, was full of confidence, his gaze becoming sharp. He spoke in a low voice, “If it’s difficult, then don’t bother!”

Boom!

The next moment, he directly took action.

Xia Niang wanted to intervene but found that he couldn’t even move his body.

The old eunuch also revealed a surprised expression.

With the appearance of the Azure Dragon, a deafening roar shook the surroundings. A massive Azure Dragon instantly shattered the imperial city’s formation.

The tier 6 Emperors who were watching the show had a drastic change in expression. Even Nalan Ci was greatly shocked. She had a considerable understanding of the formations of Great Xia, and even if her father came, breaking them would not be so easy. The person in front of her did it so quickly.

Breaking the formation in one move, yet not laying a hand on Xia Mang and the old eunuch, everything was too bizarre.

The tier 6 Emperors watching the spectacle immediately scattered to escape.

Too powerful, this person is either a hidden old monster or someone from the Divine Temple. If they don’t escape now, there won’t be another chance.

Long Yi broke the formation, took a step, and entered the imperial city. He looked at the fleeing Emperors and calmly snapped his fingers.

“Freeze! ”

Buzz!

The space trembled, and all the cultivators in the entire Great Xia Imperial City were frozen in place.

Hu Qing and Wuliang Buddha recognized Long Yi, so they did not escape and slowly flew over at this moment.

“Hu Qing and Wuliang greet Temple Master Long Yi!” The two bowed in respect.

The formation shattered, and Xia Mang Yunxing did not escape. Seeing that Hu Qing and Wuliang both knew each other, he breathed a sigh of relief.

He was shrewd enough to understand the current situation. The fact that Lord Long Yi didn’t act against the Patriarch clearly indicated that he hadn’t come for the Great Xia Empire.

Lord Long Yi revealed a smile and boomed, “Nephew Hu Qing, don’t be so formal!”

Then, he glanced at Wuliang and just nodded.

Hu Qing felt a bit awkward. On Grave God Mountain, Zhen Ling gave sermons, and due to the favor from the Original Planet, he was treated somewhat differently.

The Four Temple Masters and even the Spirit Keepers could tell that among the current inheritors, aside from the Ultimate Emperor, Hu Qing was the most favored by Zhen Ling.

Inheritor!

That was a rule established by Qishen Temple back in the day.

It meant inheriting the Qishen Temple.

If one inherited the Qishen Temple, these Temple Masters would naturally have to follow the new master. Currently, there was a high possibility that Hu Qing would inherit the Qishen Temple.

It wasn’t that Hu Qings potential surpassed the Ultimate Emperor’s by much. It was more about the fact that the Ultimate Emperor wasn’t quite suitable to inherit the Qishen Temple; he was better suited for the position of the Divine

Master.

So, their expectations for Hu Qing were very high.

“Temple Master, may I ask the purpose of your visit to the Great Xia?” Hu Qing looked at Lord Long Yi with curiosity.

Long Yi pointed upward and casually said, “Just a small matter. Killing some people, capturing some others!”

These seemingly ruthless words sounded nonchalant coming from Lord Long Yi’s mouth.

He had been stationed on the Bloodthirst Continent for years, and he never regarded these indigenous Emperors as equals.

This was also why there were so few powerful beings on the Bloodthirst Continent – those who resisted were all annihilated by him, leaving only those who obeyed.
