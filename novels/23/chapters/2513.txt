Chapter 2514: Reality

“It’s the Demonic Moon Prefecture, it must be them!”

“Goddammit! Why did they lock on to us in the first place?”

Many cultivators in the Xueya Escort Team began to cry in disbelief.

They knew the Demonic Moon Prefecture had made a move when they noticed the Restrictive Shield surging around them.

Only the Demonic Moon Prefecture had the capabilities to decorate those mountains with such powerful Restrictive Shields.

Furthermore, one could clearly differentiate between a normal group of thieves and the Eighteen Prefectures by merely observing their Restrictive Shield.

For example, the Celestial Beast Alliance who attacked the Xueya Escort Team a while ago would pour all the manpower and attack as a whole group the moment they started with no strategy whatsoever.

However, when the Demonic Moon Prefecture used Restrictive Shield formation to seal up the surrounding Space-time before attacking just to ensure no one from the escort team could run away.

This was the evidence of Demonic Moon Prefecture’s foundation and absolute strength.

Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew!

Seven figures charged over at the same time from the void ahead.

They were so fast, appearing before the Xueya Escort Team in no time.

Although there were only the seven of them, everyone’s face in the escort team turned shockingly pale.

The seven figures stood side-by-side in a straight line with their overpowering aura swept out—that was a total of seven Ultimate God experts!

In addition, the red-robed bald old man standing in the middle of those seven was probably their leader and projected an aura which surpassed a Low-Level Ultimate God’s. He was an actual High-Level Ultimate God!!! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If a fight were to break out against such a lineup consisting of six low-level Ultimate Gods and a high-level Ultimate God... Hopelessness—the members of the Xueya Escort Team almost completely lost hope.

Even Xiao Tiexin was secretly gritting her teeth while looking at the red-robed old man. She asked with a deep voice, “I assume you are the Governor of the Demonic Moon Prefecture?”

“That’s me.” The old man nodded a little.

“We wonder if the Xueya Escort Team has offended Demonic Moon Prefecture in any way such that you are carrying out such drastic measures?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“Your escort team did not offend us in any way. The reason we came to you was because of one person. You!” The red-robed old man pointed straight at Xiao Tiexin.

“Me?” Xiao Tiexin was surprised.

“The captain of Xueya Escort Team, Xiao Tiexin. We know you’re the Xiao clan’s eldest daughter and also the only survivor from the Xiao clan massacre. We’ve come here just for you,” said the red-robed old man with a resonant voice.

There was a huge stir among the clients of Xueya Escort Team as soon as he made this statement.

“The Demonic Moon Prefecture is here for the escort team’s captain?”

“That’s what I’d thought. All of us have pretty regular backgrounds. How would they target us with such theatrics? The person they want is the escort team’s captain of course. If I’d known this before, I won’t be so stupid to spend such an amount of money to hire their team to escort me!”

“This Xueya Escort Team has been hired to protect us but became the reason we got into trouble. What the hell!”

A number of the cultivators who were still glad they were being protected by the Xueya Escort Team started to blame the escort team instead.

Not only they were blaming, they even felt a deep hatred and began cursing them.

They were all blaming the Xueya Escort Team for getting them in trouble.

All of that was clear in the red-robed old man’s eyes as he mysteriously smiled. “Looks like you’re all panicking, huh? Actually, there’s no need. We are only here for Xiao Tiexin. As for the rest of you, you’re not our target. I’ve already ordered my people to leave a few gaps on the Restrictive Shield. There’s still time if you want to leave right now.”

“We can go?”

The cultivators’ expression changed with some of them downright joyful, but not without a slight worry.

However, the red-robed old man coldly continued. “If you want to go, you better do it soon. The gaps will completely seal up within ten breaths. Anyone who stays in this Restrictive Shield formation except for those from the Demonic Moon Prefecture will die by then!”

The cultivators who were previously protected by the Xueya Escort Team let go of all their hesitations upon hearing that.

“Quick, run!”

“Ten breaths is enough for us to escape from the Restrictive Shield. Although we won’t be protected by the Xueya Escort Team anymore and the rest of the journey would be extremely dangerous, it’s still better than dying here.”

“This is clearly the Xueya Escort Team’s fault. Why would I die with them here?”

They began to shout.

The escorted cultivators began running toward the Restrictive Shield’s edge from all directions.

There were even a few Peak Divine Demons who just joined the Xueya Escort Team escaped without any hesitation since they had neither feelings nor emotional connections with the team and Xiao Tiexin.

The remaining escort team members who chose to stay saw that and gritted their teeth in agitation.

“You maggots. All of you stop! Stop right now!”

“A bunch of bastards! Idiots!”

The two deputy captains were also shouting angrily.

“No.2 and No.3, leave them alone. Just let them run if they feel like it.” Xiao Tiexin’s demeanor appeared to be very calm—aloof would be more accurate.

She had experienced such a scene before.

Countless clans and sects bowed at them when the Xiao clan was at its peak and seriously took every word they said.

However, all the clans and sects immediately disappeared without a trace when the Xiao clan experienced destruction from the Territorial Lord’s personal attacks. None of them was willing to offer even a wee bit of help.

That was reality.

Cruel reality.

Xiao Tiexin had a clear view of reality and did not feel surprised by the action of those people.

‘Hmph, they really believe the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s Governor would let them live within ten breaths? Naive!’ Xiao Tiexin thought sarcastically.

The Dark Thunder Territory’s Eighteen Prefectures were infamous.

The reason for their infamy was built on nothing but endless killings which caused the shrouding crimson fog!

It was true the Eighteen Prefectures did not easily attack, but when they did everyone within their sight would be killed without showing the least bit of mercy.

It was nice to hear the red-robed old man’s words which promised to let them live. However, perhaps he did not feel like wasting so much energy and was reluctant to suffer any additional loss on the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s side.

If her predictions were correct, those who scattered and ran out of those gaps would probably be killed immediately and mercilessly right after they left.

In the end, perhaps not many would survive.

Of course, Xiao Tiexin knew that but had no desire to waste her words on those fleeing from battle.
