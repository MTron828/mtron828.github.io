Chapter 5494 ¬†The Gentle Divine General Moyin

Later, Jian Wushuang suppressed this thought because Divine General Moyin had arrived.

This time, the true body came. The vast aura emanating from the Divine General of Mo Yin made them both yearn and feel fear.

The space trembled; this was the Ultimate Emperor, standing at the peak of the Emperor realm.

"Congratulations, you've successfully passed the three bridges!" Divine General Moyin spoke gently.

The three were quite surprised. In the past, the voice of Divine General Moyin was either icy or imposing. Why was he so amiable this time?

Could it be because they passed the test?

But they didn't think much about it. They couldn't imagine that Divine General Moyin couldn't fulfill his promise to them initially.

Divine General Moyin looked at the three, their eyes full of hope. He felt a bit reluctant deep down, but there was no other way. He had just recovered, and his treasures were limited.

"Do you know what these three bridges represent?" Divine General Moyin didn't mention rewards and began to explain the origin of these three bridges.

The three were clueless, but they weren't in a hurry either.

Because they were also curious about it.

Divine General Moyin carefully explained the origin of the three bridges to them.

It turned out that this place was once a testing ground for potential Envoys.

As long as they passed, they could become Envoys under the command of Qishen Temple.

Each examinee had to be at least a tier 6 Emperor.

Once they passed, they could become Envoys, and with a series of training, they had the chance to become one of the 108 Envoys.

Of course, besides the core 108 Envoys, there was also a position of Stewards. These Envoys would carry the identity of Stewards of Qishen Temple while traversing the vast expanse of time and space.

The status was lofty, but all were deputy Envoys, destined to be by the side of the Qishen in the future.

So, when the three bridges were set up initially, many tier 6 Emperors under the Universe Master came to challenge.

However, at that time, the difficulty was higher than it is now, after all, this place had been abandoned for too long, and some tests had lost their effectiveness.

After the explanation from Divine General Moyin, he asked, "Are you willing to become the most core members of the Qishen Temple?"

Upon hearing this, the three were momentarily stunned.

Especially Dongshen and Wanyan, almost nodding simultaneously.

"I, Dongshen, am willing!"

"I, Wanyan, am willing!"

Both of them were very excited, the true core of the Qishen Temple!

Who wouldn't be willing?

Jian Wushuang stood on the side, watching these two, sighing inwardly.

They didn't know, but Jian Wushuang knew.

The Qishen Temple didn't really have a core force. Divine General Moyin was probably just fooling the two of them.

Now, in the entire Qishen Temple, the only person who dared to claim to be the core was Zhen Ling.

Back then, when they talked about building the Elder Palace, they directly broke away from the control of the Four Great Temples.

Now it had evolved into the fifth force. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

As for the so-called core mentioned by Divine General Moyin, in ancient times, the Envoys and Divine Generals were indeed the core, but that was with the backing of the Qishen and three Divine Masters.

Now there's only Divine General Moyin and Lord Yun Zhong.

With just these two, Jian Wushuang didn't look down on them. Even if they worked together, they weren't even enough to beat the Temple Master of the Azure Dragon Temple, yet they dared to claim to be the core of Qishen Temple.

The most crucial thing was power.

The power within the Qishen Temple.

Outside the Azure Dragon Temple, it was currently ineffective in dealing with external matters, and naturally, almost no one sought refuge in the Azure Dragon Temple.

Inside the White Tiger Temple, many pledged allegiance to the White Tiger Temple, flaunting their prowess in the Four Great Secret Realms because of the significant influence of the White Tiger Temple!

The Vermilion Bird Temple, responsible for selecting trial participants and external plunder missions, held considerable power. Although it might not be explicitly stated, the Inheritors of the Grave God Mountain, apart from those who were originally powerful Emperors, mostly came from the Vermilion Bird Temple.

They still harbored some goodwill towards the Vermilion Bird Temple. Those who joined voluntarily were often bestowed with many treasures. After all, the Vermilion Bird Temple controlled the Original Realm, where 90 percent of the treasures from the Qishen Temple were stored.

The remaining 10 percent was split, with half in the hands of Zhen Ling and the other half in the hands of the White Tiger Temple.

Although Zhu Yi was somewhat rigid, she treated her subordinates fairly well, attracting many Inheritors.

As for the Xuanwu Temple, no comments could be made as they hadn't made an appearance.

If we consider only the Four Temples, most people would choose either the White Tiger Temple or the Vermilion Bird Temple.

The new power, Elders Palace, located in the northern border of the Heavenly Realm, had the strongest control, and there were also numerous treasures. Many Inheritors sought refuge there, but their strength was somewhat average, mainly consisting of individuals with mediocre aptitude.

This was also due to the accumulation of profound treasures provided by Zhen Ling, attracting elites.

As for Divine General Moyin, relying solely on the empty words of being a core force, trying to deceive people.

Only newcomers like Dongshen and Wanyan might believe such nonsense.

Jian Wushuang, however, was not so easily fooled.

Divine General Moyin also noticed Jian Wushuang and asked, "And you, Jian Wushuang?"

"Divine General, Lord Wu Zuo has shown me favor, and I have promised to stay in the Elders Palace!" Jian Wushuang respectfully replied.

Divine General Moyin gave a faint smile and said, "Almost forgot, you do have some connection with Lord Wu Zuo!"

Since Jian Wushuang showed no intention to go with him, Divine General Moyin didn't insist.

And that's because Jian Wushuang's benefits lay with Wu Zuo!

"Since you two have agreed, carry these two tokens with you. I have avatars spread across the Four Great Secret Realms. If you have any needs, you can contact me at any time. Now I will send you out of this place!"

"Yes!"

Dongshen and Wanyan were very pleased; they had found a backing.

The thoughts of the older generation were simple: no matter where you go, without a backing, you never feel secure. Now that they had support, they felt more confident.

The three of them saw darkness before their eyes, and when they appeared again, they were in the Demon-Sealing Space.

"Dongshen and Wanyan, stay here. Jian Wushuang can leave now. Brother Wuz Zo is waiting for you in the outside world!"

"Yes!"

Finally, they left.

It had probably been at least tens of thousands of years in this place.

After leaving the Demon Sound Hall.

They arrived at the top of the Demon Sound Mountain.

Many people sensed Jian Wushuang's presence and gathered around.

"Fellow Daoist Wushuang, why did you come out so quickly?" asked Emperor Zhutian with some surprise.

Jian Wushuang was startled for a moment. In fact, tens of thousands of years were considered a short time.

Someone interjected from the side, "There must be time acceleration in the Demon Sound Hall!"

In reality, time acceleration was rare.

When crossing the narrow bridge, Jian Wushuang didn't pay attention to time. There might have been time acceleration at that moment.

The rest of the time, he wasted a lot of time on the dim path when crossing the first bridge.

People were discussing, eager to know what happened inside.

It wasn't that Jian Wushuang was unwilling to talk. It was that he couldn't.

Just then, Wu Zuo walked over.

"Hmph, if you want to know, go in and see for yourselves!"

Wu Zuo's expression was somewhat indifferent. Ignoring the others, he came to Jian Wushuang and said in a slightly softened tone, "Jian Wushuang, come with me!"

"Yes!"

Seeing Wu Zuo's expression, the others dared not approach, and they could only leave dejectedly, finding a place to continue their cultivation.
