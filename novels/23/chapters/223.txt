Chapter 224: The Illusory Realm of Slaughter (Part Two)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What on earth happened?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the crowd while frowning.

Among the crowd, there were many people who had treated him enthusiastically, such as the humpbacked elder with grey hair, the stout man who wore an animal skin, and the young girl who praised his handsomeness. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Now they were gazing at him with killing intent.

“Die! Die!”

“Go to hell!”

“Kill him!”

Low growls sounded from the crowd and then people crazily dashed toward Jian Wushuang.

Kitchen knives, hoes, sickles, and even butcher’s knives were thrown at Jian Wushuang.

“Shit.” After noticing it, Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

Ordinarily, he would walk on the air to leave when encountering such a situation. But now, he was unable to use any spiritual power, so he could not Voidwalk.

Seeing the crowd dashing toward him, Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold and he abruptly drew his Triple-kill Sword.

Biu... After being drawn out of the sheath, the longsword transformed into a flowing light, instantly sweeping through six people who were rushing toward Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang now was unable to use his spiritual power, his swordsmanship and comprehension of the sword essence could be used.

Now Jian Wushuang faced the situation his father had encountered. When trapped in the Nine Emperors Sect, his father didn’t possess any spiritual power because of his broken Dantian, but he killed an expert of the Initial Yin Void Realm with merely one stroke.

Without using spiritual power, Jian Wushuang could easily deal with those ordinary men by means of his swordsmanship and comprehension of the sword essence.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

Six sounds sounded out simultaneously. At that moment, the six men’s wrists were pushed away by Jian Wushuang.

Despite all this, those six men still crazily pounced on him and violently attacked him.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned dark. He realized that he should absolutely show them no mercy, otherwise, he would be killed eventually.

After thinking carefully, Jian Wushuang no longer hesitated.

“Go to hell!”

The Triple-kill Sword was wielded and instantly, the sharp sword light cut through the throats of several people around him.

Slaughter. Crazy slaughter!

Only streaks of Unbridled Sword Shadow could be seen. These ordinary people didn’t have any ability to resist and were thus killed one by one.

While Jian Wushuang was slaughtering crazily wielding his longsword in the palace, the absolute beauty and the strong man retreated to the corner and looked straight ahead at Jian Wushuang.

Streaks of sword light actually chopped through the Void.

But for Jian Wushuang, every sword wielded by him was stained with blood.

“He has totally sunk into the Illusory Realm of Slaughter,” the strong man said in a low voice.

The absolute beauty said seriously, “The Illusory Realm of Slaughter is an endless slaughter. Whoever he meets in the illusory will be desperate to kill him and he has to force himself to keep slaughtering. The more people he slaughters, the stronger his killing intent will be. In the end, he will be numb in slaughter.

“Once he is numb, his mentality will change.

“It depends on whether he is able to follow his heart to carry on.”

In this world, killing was not a big deal.

It was tough to change one’s mentality by killing one, 10, or even 100 people.

However, when one killed thousands of people or even more who just were ordinary people, regardless of who they were, their mentality would change or become distorted.

As for the Illusory Realm, there were two kinds of trials.

One was changing mentality. If under the circumstances of being forced to slaughter, Jian Wushuang changed his mentality to one of a great devil who was addicted to slaughtering and was indifferent to others’ lives, he would have failed in the trial.

Unless he retained his original mentality and carried on bravely from the beginning to the end, he would then be able to arrive at the end of the Illusory Realm of Slaughter.

There was a long way to go. It all depended on Jian Wushuang himself.

...

Within the Illusory Realm, the tranquility and quietness of the original village had disappeared.

The whole village was covered in blood like it was an entire sea of blood. Numbers of corpses lay in a state of disarray in the street, including the elderly, children, and women. All of them were ordinary people.

To Jian Wushuang, an expert of the Sword Principle, they were physically weak.

But now, they were all killed by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was standing up in blood, while trembling slightly.

Even though he knew that everything merely was illusory, he felt unnatural.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang managed to calm himself down as he looked around.

“Previously, the village made me feel peace and warmth. Shortly afterward, all of the villagers began attacking me ferociously...” Jian Wushuang shook his head slightly. “What on earth is the first trial of the Ancestor’s Land?”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t understand it.

He followed his original mentality.

The same as in the Illusory Realm.

In the beginning, he showed mercy to those villagers who were proactive in trying to kill him. He didn’t kill them until he found that it was useless to show them mercy.

What he did shook him, but he soon calmed himself.

He didn’t feel remorse.

After he left the village, Jian Wushuang kept moving forward.

He didn’t know where to go, but he was guided by a will of the unseen world, which led him to keep moving forward.

...

As time went by, Jian Wushuang had no idea how far he had already traveled in the Illusory Realm.

Similarly, he couldn’t remember how many people he had killed.

In short, whoever saw Jian Wushuang pass by would dash toward him crazily to kill him, while he reacted against them with slaughter; he had to protect himself.

Going so far and killing thousands of people, Jian Wushuang had already become numb.

Momentarily, he arrived at the edge of a majestic mountaintop with a bottomless cliff at the front.

Beside the edge of the cliff a stone tablet was erected, which had three scratched words carved into it.

“Cliff of Repentance!”

Jian Wushuang stopped to look at the three words on the stone tablet.

“In repentance, there is a salvation.” A resonating voice sounded suddenly. When Jian Wushuang turned his head, he saw a green-clothed elder who wore a straw hat, standing barefoot beside a huge stone.

The green-clothed elder was covered with dirt but his eyes were sparkling, staring at Jian Wushuang.

Seeing him, Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

“Warrior!”

Jian Wushuang felt spiritual power from the green-clothed elder. Although his spiritual power was not so strong and only reached Primordial Gold Core Realm, he was the first warrior who Jian Wushuang had met after arriving in the Illusory Realm.
