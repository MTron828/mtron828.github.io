Chapter 2462: Deducement

“Deduced...”

In the swordsmanship test on the eighth trial bridge, I had a breakthrough in my understanding of sword principle and achieved Profound Sword Principle Realm. My sword skills have improved. I have created ‘Heaven and Earth Aligned’ during the battle with those genius disciples, but that was not all I’m capable of. Fengtian Scroll is a great tool for me to deduce swordsmanship using the mysterious Cosmic Mysteries.”

The third style of Space-time Sword Technique...”

The third style of Transmigration Sword Principle...”

Among the two major laws of Space-time and Transmigration, my Space-time Law level is infinitely close to reaching the first stage. Perhaps through this enlightenment, I would be able to progress and achieve a breakthrough in my apparition techniques. I’m very close to reaching the first stage for Transmigration Law as well...” Jian Wushuang murmured.

His consciousness was divided into three at that moment!

He was using his consciousnesses to respectively deduce Swordsmanship, Space-time Law, and Transmigration Law.

It was not an easy task dividing one’s consciousness into three and using them separately to deduce three types of knowledge. For this to be done, not only must he have an extremely tenacious and powerful consciousness, but also amazing comprehension capabilities.

After all, his comprehension capabilities would be reduced to only one-third of his usual with his consciousness divided into three. Under such circumstances, it would normally be less effective compared to concentrating on deducing only one type of knowledge.

Therefore, many cultivators including many geniuses would not dare go down that road.

Yet, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate.

As a Perfect Chaotic Creature, he had excellent comprehension capabilities.

Jian Wushuang was in full concentration mode and indulged himself in Fengtian Scroll’s enlightenment process.

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, and Zhong Yi who were next to him also did the same. No one would be willing to waste this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They would seize this time to improve their powers as much as possible.

In the hidden and independent space, Crimson Stone Saint casually stood there but cast his eyes on Jian Wushuang from time to time.

He did not bother giving his attention to the other geniuses.

“I went through a lot to get hold of just this one scroll and was miserably hunted down such that even my death was related to this Fengtian Scroll. What an advantage to this brat,” murmured Crimson Stone Saint.

He knew very well the merits of Fengtian Scroll.

A single scroll may be of little use to him who had reached the level of Undying Saint, but the Fengtian Scroll would be of tremendous help for gods who were below the Undying Saint cultivation level, especially for those Divine Demons who were in Saint’s Tomb.

The tomb was opened many times in the past and many disciples had gained a lot of benefit through the process of enlightenment when they looked at the Fengtian Scroll every single time.

“Jian Wushuang is so talented. I wonder how much improvement he will have after meditating upon this Fengtian Scroll?” Crimson Stone Saint had very high expectations for Jian Wushuang.

Time very slowly went by as Jian Wushuang and the rest meditated.

Fengtian Scroll was only available for ten days each time it was opened up and those ten days slipped away in the blink of an eye.

Hum...

As soon as the time was up, the huge scroll in the void above immediately folded up, melted away, and disappeared.

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, and Zhong Yi had also regained their consciousness on that hill.

“Huh!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ling Dan let out a breath as he opened up his eyes which were filled with happiness. It was obvious that he had gained a lot during his ten days of meditation.

“Junior Sister, have you gained a lot?” Ling Dan walked up to Zhuo Bing.

“I’ve benefited a lot. It was comparable to about 10 years or even decades of hard work. Most importantly, I’ll no longer have any obstacles on my path to achieve Peak Divine Demon Realm. After absorbing the divine powers from the Divine Power Ocean, I should be able to make a breakthrough to the Peak Divine Demon Realm after returning to Ancient Star Temple,” said Zhuo Bing with a wide grin.

“Really? Congratulations, Junior Sister.” Ling Dan congratulated Zhuo Bing.

“Both of you seemed to have gained a lot.” Zhong Yi who joined them was also beaming widely.

“Brother Zhong Yi, I’m sure that you have gained no less than us,” said Ling Dan with a smile.

The three of them exchanged brief greetings before all of them looked at Jian Wushuang who was next to them.

“That Fengtian Scroll is gone, yet Junior Brother Wushuang is still meditating?” Zhong Yi exclaimed in surprise.

“Brother Wushuang should’ve gotten some enlightenment. Let’s just wait here and not disturb him,” said Ling Dan.

The three of them waited until Jian Wushuang, who had been sitting cross-legged finally opened his eyes.

Jian Wushuang soon joined the three of them.

“Little Brother, how do you feel?” Zhuo Bing asked.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Of course, he was just being modest.

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, and Zhong Yi had tremendous gains after ten days of meditation. Jian Wushuang should have gotten a lot more since he had stronger comprehension capabilities compared to the three of them.

Besides, he was deducing three types of knowledge—Swordsmanship, Space-time Law and Transmigration Law—at the same time.

The insights he gained after ten days in those three aspects exceeded his expectations.

He had made advancements by leaps and bounds.

‘I understand now, why those genius disciples paid so much attention to the Fengtian Scroll viewing position tokens and even fought for it with their lives,’ Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Even he had to admit that the Fengtian Scroll had greatly helped him to an extent that tantamounts to a great deal of luck.

Luck and opportunities were greatly sought after by the masses.

“After Fengtian Scroll, Divine Power Ocean should be next,” Jian Wushuang murmured with his eyes gleaming with excitement.

Divine Power Ocean was the most common opportunity available in Saint’s Tomb.

The purple amulets needed to enter the Divine Power Ocean were easier to obtain, hence almost everyone could get into the Ocean and spent time there.

However, Jian Wushuang’s expectation towards the Divine Power Ocean was only second to the enlightenment of the Fengtian Scroll.

That opportunity came on time, especially when he was being targeted by those experts from other sects outside the tomb.

It was likely those experts would dash up to him once he exited the tomb. Besides First-Class Divine Demons, there were also a large number of Peak Divine Demons, Jian Wushuang could not handle the mob with his current strength.

Therefore, there was only one way out if Jian Wushuang hoped to survive this crisis on his own!

That was to get into the Divine Power Ocean and absorb the divine powers in there to enhance the divine powers within his body and breakthrough to the Divine Demon Realm.

Once he achieved the Divine Demon Realm, he would be a truly complete Perfect Chaotic Creature which would help him fend off the crisis that was waiting for him outside!

“Fengtian Scroll didn’t disappoint me. I hope that the Divine Power Ocean will also not let me down!” Jian Wushuang was electrified and had unconsciously clasped his hands together.
