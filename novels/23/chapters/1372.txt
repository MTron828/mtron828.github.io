Chapter 1373: Unfair!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On the Sword Star, a new round of the ongoing battle was happening.

Bang!

A giant axe hit Jian Wushuang directly, blasting at both him and his sword. It took Jian Wushuang quite a while to regain his stability.

“Is he worth his identity as a disciple from the Star Palace?! Ridiculous!”

The man using the axe glanced at Jian Wushuang with contempt and left.

Outside of the Sword Star, many disciples were watching the battle.

“Jian Wushuang has already lost twelve battles consecutively. Thirteen, if we count the battle with Luo Quan.”

“It is the first time that I have seen such a weak disciple from the Star Palace.”

Many disciples were gossiping about Jian Wushuang.

“He just joined the Star Palace by luck.”

“Still, he is quite resilient and never gave up, even though he was defeated by multiple times.”

“Resilient? I think he is stupid!”

He may step down in eight hundred years. I would be meaningless to waste time discussing him.

Many disciples left.

They had gradually lost interest in Jian Wushuang and no one challenged him any more.

Amongst those who were still watching Jian Wushuang were two particular figures.

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao.

Hall Master Yuan sighed, “He is having a difficult time.”

“Of course. How can it be easy to pretend to be a Universe God in the Second Heaven when he is only in the First Heaven?” Lei Chao said.

“Recently, many disciples as well as many Real Gods have complained to me that it is unfair to let Jian Wushuang in.”

“Nonsense. It is only unfair to Jian Wushuang, not them.” Lei Chao murmured.

“But they don’t know the truth, so we can’t blame them either. Let’s just see what will happen in the future. Obstacles are good for him.”

“But if Jian Wushuang becomes an ordinary disciple, he will lose many resources.” Lei Chao said.

“Maybe we won’t have to worry about this just now. Just wait.” Hall Master Yuan said smilingly and left.

Lei Chao also left.

After ordinary disciples lost interest in Jian Wushuang, he finally had time to devote himself to cultivation.

He was now in the Reset Palace.

He was sitting in the palace with a strong consciousness attack around him.

Under the attack, Jian Wushuang slowly increased his soul resilience.

At the same time, he was consuming the power captured by the four Meta Beasts, which facilitated his soul power.

“With the help of the beasts’ power, I can increase my soul power faster!”

Jian Wushuang felt satisfied.

After he had run out of all the Meta Beast power, he chose to leave the Reset Palace and started to travel around the Nine Shrines.

Although the Nine Shrines were not as valuable as the Real God Hall and the Reset Palace, they could still help cultivators a lot.

Especially the Shrine of Myriad Swords.

The Shrine of Myriad Swords was used for cultivating swordsmanship. It was home to countless secret skills, the procedures of which could be demonstrated through screens.

There were so many high-level secret skills that were convenient to learn.

The Shrine of Myriad Swords could definitely help Jian Wushuang improve his swordsmanship.

“Now my cultivation of swordsmanship is going through a bottleneck and I need a breakthrough. Maybe I could draw some inspiration and make a breakthrough here!” Jian Wushuang was delighted.

From then on, Jian Wushuang went to the Shrine of Myriad Swords and the Reset Palace every day.

The Reset Palace forced Jian Wushuang to strengthen his consciousness.

But he needed to relax after spending time under too much pressure. He chose to go to the Shrine of Myriad Swords to learn swordsmanship and occasionally caught Meta Beasts to absorb energy.

Time passed quickly.

Jian Wushuang had been in the Lineage of Star for thirty years

In the Shrine of Myriad Swords.

With a harsh sound, a bright flash of light burst out from Jian Wushuang’s sword.

The light transformed into a scarlet phoenix which could generate overwhelming power.

As the light dissipated, the phoenix also disappeared.

Jian Wushuang had succeeded!

“Finally, I have made a breakthrough in the past thirty years and created a Peak Rank Two Secret Skill.” Jian Wushuang was satisfied.

Without resources in the Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang would have had to spend much more time. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But, inspired by resources from the Shrine of Myriad Swords, he had made a breakthrough within only thirty years.

It would take a long time to create a Rank Three Secret Skill.

“Jian Wushuang, you should integrate the Peak Rank Two Secret Skill into your Blood Mountain Sword to make it more powerful,” King of Venomous Worms commented.

“You are right!” Jian Wushuang was inspired.
