Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang and Feng stood in the air, hundreds of feet apart.

When Feng sensed Jian Wushuangs aura and realized it was as powerful as before, he frowned and said, You’re the first person who managed to take my blow on this battlefield. You’re much more powerful than any of my previous opponents.

“How flattering. You’re quite powerful as well.” Jian Wushuang praised him from the bottom of his heart.

He was not sure if he could beat Feng, even with his World Body.

“With your current power, you can make it to the end of this round. I expect to meet you in round two,” Feng added.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows when he heard those words.?“He doesn’t want to fight me now.”

After all, it was just the first round of genius battle in the Ancient World.

Therefore, they did not have to battle each other at that moment.

“I expect to see you in the following rounds as well.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with battle intent.

Feng shot him a serious glance and nodded at him before leaving.

After Feng left, the hidden experts were in a sudden uproar.

This battle would bring Jian Wushuang’s name to every corner of the battlefield as a person who had been able to push Feng back.

In the next few days, the battle continued in a less fierce way since there were fewer people still fighting on the battlefield.

After the battles with Xue Feng and Feng, Jian Wushuang encountered another expert ranked within the top 30. This opponent was even stronger than Xue Feng, but Jian Wushuang still killed him with his Superior Secret Skill—Cataclysm Skill.

As time went by, the fifth day finally arrived, signaling the end of the first round of the genius battle. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom! A mighty power swept over the whole battlefield and caused everyone there to cease what they were doing. The very next moment, they saw their token explode in a flash of light and they were brought back to the Drill Ground.

All the warriors from the Ancient World had been gathered there again.

The whole area was clamorous as the experts looked towards the people who had performed well during the battle.

“Look, he is Feng!”

“He is a frightening guy. I heard that he killed countless opponents during the last five days, including some of the people in the top 30, with only a single strike. Very few managed to take his blow.”

“This guy is terrifying!”

“The man there is Huo Ying and he’s as famous as Feng. It’s impossible to tell who is more powerful between the two unless they battle each other.”

“That guy is Xuan Ying. He has battled Huo Ying.”

“Can you see that black-robed youth with a sword on his back? He is Sword Emperor, one of those who managed to survive Feng’s attack. He might not be a match for Feng and Huo Ying, but he is not weak at all.”

Quite a lot of people were discussing the results with each other.

They had talked very little at the beginning when everyone had yet to show their power, but now, after the first round, they had enough information to have discussions about the powerful experts.

On the other side of the Drill Ground, the geniuses from the Eternal World were talking to each other as well.

“I really want to know whether we have made it to round two or not.”

The results were a worrisome issue to most of them except for those who had absolute confidence in themselves, such as Jian Wushuang, Feng, and Huo Ying.

Everyone waited in silence.

By the time the elders finished calculating all the results, a half hour had passed and the list of those who could get into the next round was decided.

“Here are the details on the first round of the genius battle. Send it to all the sects right now,” the leader of the elders ordered.

“Understood.” Someone went to send the files.

Not many sects currently had their men watching the battle in Firmament Territory Feast. They did not care about the results of the first round because it would not be enough to determine who the most excellent talents were.

That’s why the elders had to send the results to them.

However, when it came to the second round, the sects would be more concerned.

“The list of the winners of the first round is settled. Go announce it.”

Immediately, a white-robed man took the list to the Drill Ground and handed it to the host of the battle.

After a careful glance, the host nodded and went to the Drill Ground where the geniuses from the Eternal World were.

“We’re ready to announce the names of those who make it to the second round. I’ll read them to you, one by one.” The host started to read the names on the list before the warriors could react.

“Gu Qing.”

“Mu Zhan.

“Ouyang Xuan.

“Ling Hu.”

Those whose names were called all beamed with joy while the others remained anxious.

The host read out 900 names without pausing.

“The above 900 people are eligible for the second round of the genius battle. As for the rest of you, you all failed,” The host said indifferently.

Feelings of happiness and sadness encompassed the area.
