Chapter 5598 ¬†Power of the Starry Sky

Maybe he had already reached the Mahayana realm, but he couldn't feel it now. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

After all, he possessed terrifying secret techniques imbued with time.

As for the cosmic space, he had the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard to observe, and his cultivation speed was unknown times faster than others.

A full Universe Origin Source probably surpassed even the one in the Qishen Temple.

This was the Temporal Treasure Xuan Yi left for him.

Not even the First True King fully understood it; it was far more complicated than what the First True King had described.

With such a treasure, his achievements in the cosmic space became too straightforward.

During the time as Dao Lord, he could condense a 99 percent black hole in space across realms.

Once he successfully integrated the Dao, he might directly reach the realm of black hole.

Successful Dao Merge would cause a massive surge in his body.

The Emperor-level cultivation was just a transition; his goal was to transcend to the Tribulation realm!

Having seen and heard so much, his vision had become broader.

He had witnessed the power of the Sixth Tribulation realm, which was his ultimate goal.

Those gods he once admired were just fleeting clouds.

After Fuego recovered his peak, he consulted him about the power of the Tribulation realm.

That was what he aimed to pursue.

Even though Mie Sheng was powerful, Zhen Ling was currently capable of restraining Mie Sheng. Moreover, Mie Sheng had left the Qishen Temple, giving him time to cultivate and surpass.

This chess game wasn't just a match between opposing players; he, too, was transforming from a mere piece into a player.

Even in the future, he would possess the power to overturn the chessboard.

"Just wait!" Jian Wushuang's gaze had never been so resolute.

Staring down at Broly below, witnessing the constant fluctuations in the opponent's strength, he felt neither surprise nor intimidation.

The Eight-Armed Beast Emperor, on the other hand, seemed a bit unsettled!

Broly's aura gradually surged, the ferocious beast's power breaking through its confines and instantly enveloping Broly's entire body.

Raising his head slowly, Broly's hair surged instantly. The disheveled strands turned white and scattered directly.

With a head full of white hair, Broly's divine form suddenly condensed, and his physical body restored.

Then, gritting his teeth, he let out a roar that directly shattered the Eight-Armed Beast Emperor's restraints.

Broly, standing in the air, revealed a hint of a sinister smile.

This scene sent shivers down the spines of the temple powerhouses who had considered retreating.

The Eight-Armed Beast Emperor felt all eight of its tentacles tingle, the aura too overpowering.

Broly subtly moved his wrist, as if sensing the power within him at this moment.

Jian Wushuang discerned something and immediately roared, "Don't just stand there, you fool!"

At this moment, Broly hadn't fully mastered the power within him. The Eight-Armed Beast Emperor still had a chance.

Once Broly gained control of the power within him, the Eight-Armed Beast Emperor would undoubtedly meet its end.

Upon hearing the reminder, even the Eight-Armed Beast Emperor, foolish as he was, understood.

There must be some kind of restriction hidden within Broly's body. Now that the restriction was broken, his strength skyrocketed, yet he hadn't fully absorbed or controlled it.

If he didn't act now, he would have no chance.

When Broly slowly raised his hand, Jian Wushuang understood ‚Äì there was no chance left.

A grasp in the void!

A tremendously massive black sphere of power gathered in Broly's palm. The force dispersed across the four seas, forcing Emperors who were spectating to retreat countless miles, their breaths shaken.

"Die!" A simple word carried an immensely mad and domineering aura.

Boom!!!

A colossal beam indiscriminately swept across the entire western coast, reducing the mundane mortal world to dust. Countless mountains and rivers turned into ashes.

Jian Wushuang now understood how the ruins in the Human Realm had come into existence.

At the moment the beam erupted, he had already evaded it. The true form of the Eight-Armed Beast Emperor was enormous, and moving it was inherently difficult. There was no way to dodge; he could only withstand it.

Within the beam, the Eight-Armed Beast Emperor's eight limbs broke one after another, turning into dust.

As it was about to completely fall, Jian Wushuang felt a sense of panic.

Inside the Eight-Armed Beast Emperor's body, there still existed the Beast God's bloodline he needed. He couldn't afford to waste it like this.

With the Jueyun Sword in hand, he made a simple and unremarkable slash!

Though not the first sword in the Starry Sky Chronicles, with his current strength, this slash was more than sufficient.

The mystique of swordsmanship was just that marvelous.

Even though his cultivation realm was merely at the beginning of the supreme-peak, his combat power was enough to stop Broly, a supreme-peak expert.

The beam split into two in an instant.

Now, with only half of the beam, the Eight-Armed Beast Emperor was left half-dead, trembling continuously. All eight tentacles were severed!

He never expected Broly to become so powerful!

Nor did he anticipate that Jian Wushuang would come to his rescue!

"Cultivator, I and you..." Seeing Jian Wushuang take action, the Eight-Arm Beast Emperor thought they were going to join forces against Broly, but he didn't expect Jian Wushuang to unleash another sword strike.

Though the power of this sword strike couldn't match Broly's power, the purity of the sword's strength surpassed it. There was no grandiose destruction like Broly's.

The Eight-Arm Beast Emperor was only split in half.

Even in death, the Eight-Arm Beast Emperor didn't understand why Jian Wushuang chose to kill him first.

Thump, thump!

A tremendously large heart continued to beat.

However, the demonic core of the Eight-Arm Beast Emperor had dimmed.

Jian Wushuang was swift; one hand reached for the heart of the Beast Emperor, directly using Devouring techniques to absorb all the bloodline power within.

Soon, a trembling blood clot appeared within his Origin Source.

He had skillfully absorbed only the essence of the blood into his body.

As for refining it into the heart's blood that would become the Beast God Blood, it was still far from enough.

In the Qishen Temple now, the only powerful figure capable of helping him refine the heart's blood was one person.

The Master of Black Tortoise Temple!

The one named Xuan Yi, the same as his master!

Not only was he a puppet master, but also a formidable alchemy expert.

Much stronger than a divine craftsman like Qiuhuang.

Not even Shen Ling Frolasa could compare.

But that was something to prepare for later; for now, he had to deal with Broly.

This formidable enemy was likely a pawn in the scheme of Mie Sheng.

He had already communicated with Wu Zuo, instructing him to verify with the Zhen Ling.

If it was indeed a scheme by Mie Sheng, he would have to eliminate Broly.

Broly stared at the figure in front of him, someone he found somewhat familiar, and his fighting spirit surged.

In his eyes, there were no companions.

Apart from his father, Bukun, there was only a formidable opponent left to battle.

The warlike blood boiled within him.

In the past, he could still restrain it to some extent, but now, with the restrictions lifted, it was challenging to quell that overwhelming battle intent.

"You want to be my enemy!" Broly, a battle maniac, was very sensitive to battle intent and noticed the same aura on Jian Wushuang. This delighted him!

Battle!

Born for battle!

Fight to the death!

Jian Wushuang stared at Broly, carefully observing the significant changes in him. His physique had become more robust, with white hair standing on end, as if electrified. His body was enveloped in white flames.

The power of the Transformation Dao was formidable, and he had witnessed it with his own eyes.
