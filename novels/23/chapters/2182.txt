Chapter 2183 Leader of the Seven Stars.

Under the horrified looks of everyone around, the weak but eternal sword light collided head on with the blood red spear.Boom! ~~

A deafening sound was heard.

The entire Three Emperors World trembled and threatened to collapse under the pressure.

At the edge of the sky, the sea of blood red dimmed as the souls in the sea of crimson red fell silent.

Sword light started to disperse in all directions.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

A figure appeared far in the distance as he steadied himself.

This red figure was Blood Emperor.

As for Emperor Thirteen, he stood there coldly with an ordinary and dim sword in his hands.

“Emperor Thirteen has the upper hand!” Emperor Bai raised his eyebrows in relief.

“That is right.” Jian Wushuang clenched his fist and replied.

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were elated.

After the short exchange of blows, the sword light from Emperor Thirteen dispersed the sea of crimson red and forced Blood Emperor back.

Everyone knew that Emperor Thirteen had the absolute advantage.

“Back then, Emperor Thirteen only used his consciousness embodiment to fight me and I felt he was strong beyond belief. He was the reason why I believed that stage four great emperors existed. Now, it looks like he is much stronger than even I had imagined.” Emperor Bai said seriously.

“Even though this is the case, it is still too early to be happy.” Jian Wushuang said.

It was true that during the short exchange just now, Emperor Thirteen had had the upper hand.

One exchange was not sufficient to conclude the power level of Emperor Thirteen and Blood Emperor.

Most importantly, even though Blood Emperor had been suppressed during that fight, he was smiling in an elated manner.

His smile got wider and wider.

At the end, he burst out laughing, “Hahaha~~~”

His laughter reverberated in the battlefield.

Experts from the Eternal Chaotic World could not understand why he was laughing as he was obviously at a disadvantage during the battle just now.

Only Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai had a bad feeling of what was about to happen.

After Blood Emperor stopped laughing, the way he looked at Emperor Thirteen was completely different.

He had had a serious and fearful expression before.

After all, Emperor Thirteen had been far too terrifying back in the ancient past.

He had no confidence in going up against Emperor Thirteen after all those years of living fearfully about Emperor Thirteen.

After that short exchange of blows, he had gained the confidence to fight Emperor Thirteen head on.

“Emperor Thirteen, I thought that you were still that leader of the Seven Stars back in the ancient past, the man who could force experts to submit to you and have the power to stand up to even the Master of the Holy Land.”

“If it was back then, I would have retreated without hesitation if I ever ran into you.”

“But now, under the restriction by the Heaven and Earth, you are only in the Chaotic Realm. Even if you have incredible techniques, you can’t use them. Under these circumstances, what are you going to beat me with?”

At this point, the fear that Blood Emperor had was gone. In its place was desire!

The desire to… kill Emperor Thirteen!

Emperor Thirteen was a high and almighty man.

To Blood Emperor, what else could be more exciting than to kill Emperor Thirteen with his own hands?

Hearing what Blood Emperor had said, Emperor Thirteen was still emotionless and had no changes at all.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were stunned.

From what Blood Emperor had said, they picked out a lot of information.

First and foremost, Emperor Thirteen was one of the peak superpowers back in the ancient past.

Second, Emperor Thirteen was a member of the Seven Star Black Sect.

“Seven Star Black Sect, leader of the Seven Stars?”

“A man who can make everyone else submit, and even challenge the Master of Holy Land?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He did not understand what it meant to be the Leader of the Seven Stars.

Nor did he understand how powerful Master of Holy Land was. But he could deduce that Emperor Thirteen had been one of the superpowers back in the Ancient past.

At least in front of the Emperor Thirteen, the Blood Emperor was nothing.

Even the Blood Emperor admitted that he had no courage to stand up against Emperor Thirteen and would retreat whenever he saw him.

“Haha. Die, Emperor Thirteen!” Blood Emperor roared with laughter and excitement.

Blood Emperor attacked.

He took a casual step out, but that step was so fast that no one from the Eternal Chaotic World could see it that clearly.

An endless sea of crimson red spread out once again,

Before this, the sea of crimson red had only appeared behind the Blood Emperor. Now, it covered the entire heaven and earth.

Everyone could feel the strong killing intent coming from the sea of crimson red.

Emperor Thirteen stood at the centre of the sea of crimson red, indifferent as ever.

He slashed out with his sword once more.

The same casual movement, but this time, it was a sweeping action.

The sword light created had no aura at all.

However, the sword light created a large hole in the sea of crimson red. This hole started to enlarge as it tore the entire sea of crimson red, revealing the endless dark void.

Emperor Thirteen then flicked his wrist.

He thrust his sword forward again.

A sword light burst forth.

This sword light was not dim and weak. On the contrary, it shone brightly.

It was so bright that most people could not even open their eyes.

In the move before, the move had been extremely dim, now it was extremely bright.

They were on the opposite ends of the spectrum.

Far in the distance, the experts were shocked and curious at the bright sword light.

There was no one in the direction that Emperor Thirteen had slashed his swords towards.

Who was he targeting with this slash?

Right when this question popped up in the heads of the experts, a blood-red figure appeared under the illumination of the bright sword light.

This figure became the target for the bright sword light.

“This…” Everyone around took a cold breath as they were all amazed by the incredible techniques Emperor Thirteen had.
