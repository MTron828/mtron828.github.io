Chapter 2915: Is Here

——

“Thank you!”

Jian Wushuang looked at Saint Hong gratefully, then he turned around and went to the manor where Leng Rushuang lived.

“Grand uncle-master!” Long Xingzi was anxious.

Saint Hong waved his hand and said, “Let him go. He can’t take Xiaofeng away. After all, the people over there are coming.”

“So fast?” Long Xingzi was shocked.

Of course, he knew who Saint Hong was talking about.

Without the experts from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion blocking him, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at the beautiful manor.

In the attic corridor of the manor, Jian Wushuang saw Leng Rushuang again.

Leng Rushuang had been standing there. She had seen what had happened on the battlefield, but her expression became very complicated when she saw Jian Wushuang again.

“Shuang Er, come with me, okay?” Jian Wushuang stretched out his hand and stared at Leng Rushuang with deep affection.

Leng Rushuang’s expression changed slightly. She disagreed, but she did not refuse immediately. It was evident that she was hesitating.

Yes, Leng Rushuang was hesitating.

She could not remember Jian Wushuang, but he gave her a hot and reliable feeling.

When Jian Wushuang said he wanted to take her away, she did not resist at all.

But at the same time, she also had a lot of concerns.

Leng Rushuang had not made a decision, but at this time…

Buzz!

A vast aura suddenly came from the surrounding void.

In the void outside, the enormous sect-protecting formation of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was activated again, and then a space passage appeared in the middle of it.

A group of white-robed figures slowly walked in from the spatial tunnel.

There were a total of nine of these white-robed figures, a total of nine people.

Eight of these nine people were women, and only one was a man. Moreover, all of their expressions were ice-cold and did not contain the slightest emotion.

Nine extremely powerful auras immediately spread within the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion when they stepped into the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion from the spatial tunnel.

Sensing these nine auras, the experts and disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were all shocked!

“The Immortal Saints are all Immortal Saints!”

“Where… where did these people come from?”

“There are nine Immortal Saints. Which force is this?”

Exclamations immediately sounded in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

However, the ordinary experts and disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had limited strength, so they could not sense it.

However, Immortal Saints like Saint Hong and Long Xingzi could sense it.

The nine people who came were Immortal Saints, but all of them had auras that far surpassed ordinary Immortal Saints. Even the weakest one seemed to be no more vulnerable than Saint Hong or even more vital. In other words! These nine people were all True Immortal Saints who had mastered the immortal body!

“The previous Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Hong, greets all of you from the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley!”

Even Saint Hong appeared extremely humble in front of these nine True Saints, and he did not dare to put on any airs.

Among the nine True Saints, the leader was an ordinary-looking woman with a hint of coldness and arrogance. This cold and arrogant woman glanced around, and her cold voice slowly sounded, “Pavilion Master Hong, we’ve traveled tens of thousands of miles to come here, but there’s not even a single person outside to welcome us? Isn’t your Dragon-phoenix Pavilion too disregarding the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The cold-looking woman was obviously not happy.

“I’m very sorry. Something happened in my Dragon-phoenix Pavilion today, so I was unable to welcome you from afar. I hope everyone can atone for your sins,” Saint Hong apologized.

“Something happened?” The cold-arrogant woman frowned and looked up. A majestic soul power swept out and instantly covered the entire Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

The cold-arrogant woman also saw Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang standing side by side in the distant manor. Her eyes turned slightly cold.

“What’s going on? Who’s the kid next to the Young Phoenix?” The cold-arrogant woman asked.

“His name is Jian Yi, and he’s a top-notch genius in our Golden Crow Nine Realms. He came to our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to pay a visit this time, but we didn’t expect him to fight in our pavilion and want to take the Young Phoenix away. The experts of our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion have tried their best to stop him, but he’s so powerful that we can’t do anything to him,” Saint Hong said bitterly.

“Your Dragon-phoenix Pavilion has a few Immortal Saints, and you, a True Saint, can’t do anything to a little Divine Master?” The cold-prideful woman glanced at Saint Hong.

Saint Hong looked bitter.

“Humph!”

The cold-arrogant woman snorted and said, “Junior brother Zi Yi, go and bring your new junior sister here.”

“Yes.”

Beside the cold-arrogant woman was a young man with long purple hair. He was the only man among the nine.

After hearing the cold-arrogant woman’s words, a purple demonic light flashed in his eyes. Then he turned into a purple rainbow and rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the attic, saw Zi Yi’s arrival and his face darkened.

Although he was far away, he had already sensed the auras of the nine people. Now that Zi Yi had attacked him, the pressure on him was enormous.

“You can go!” Leng Rushuang’s voice suddenly sounded.

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “If you want to go, let’s go together. In my previous life, because I asked you to leave, I have been searching for you for 100,000 years. Now that I finally see you again in this life, how can I let you go?”

“Why are you doing this?” Leng Rushuang looked at Jian Wushuang and sighed softly.

Jian Wushuang just smiled gently and did not answer.

Buzz!

Zi Yi’s figure had already appeared in the void in front of Jian Wushuang, and a strange purple spear appeared in his hand.

As Zi Yi moved his wrist, divine power burst out, and the long spear immediately stabbed toward Jian Wushuang.

This stab was just a normal stab, but it gave Jian Wushuang an illusion. It was as if no matter how he tried to block or dodge, the spear would stab him directly.

“What a strange spear technique.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised, but he immediately attacked.

The supreme sword essence was still unbridled, and Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was raised to the limit. The Blood Mountain Sword coldly faced it.

Clang!

The purple demonic long spear collided with the Blood Mountain Sword. A metallic sound rang out, but Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank.

The power contained in the purple demonic long spear was too strong. The moment it collided with the sword, it actually caused the Blood Mountain Sword to slightly change its direction, and then the long spear continued to stab at him.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted and immediately retreated. While retreating, he slashed three times with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.
