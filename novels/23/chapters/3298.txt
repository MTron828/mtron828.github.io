Swish!

The dazzling blood light was incredibly fast.

Seven Leaves could only barely swing his axe backward, barely colliding with the blood light. After a sound of collision, Seven Leaves directly retreated to the nearby void.

Jian Wushuang and seven leaf master had a head-on confrontation. In a short moment, Seven Leaves was sent flying.

However, before Jian Wushuang could be happy, Calamity appeared in front of him with a golden long staff in his hand. It was so powerful...an aura that was even stronger than Seven Leaves came pressing down from the Calamity’s body. The power of the golden long staff in his hand suddenly soared.

Like a golden thunderbolt, it crushed everything in front of it and smashed toward Jian Wushuang’s head.

“The third realm of the Void Realm?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and glanced at Calamity.

If it was just the second realm of the Void Realm, he could easily deal with it with his own strength and life divine power. However, the third realm of the Void Realm was enough for Jian Wushuang to show his trump card.

“Heaven-cleaving skill!”

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang immediately performed the heaven-cleaving skill.

In an instant, the supreme life pressure, which came from a perfect life form, swept out from Jian Wushuang’s body and swept in all directions.

This supreme life pressure immediately pressed on the body of Calamity.

“What is this?” Calamity’s expression suddenly changed. He had already performed the golden long staff, but its power was greatly weakened in an instant.

Jian Wushuang had also attacked.

“Peerless sword technique, Emperor’s blood kill!”

Whoosh!

A shocking blood-red sword shadow, with the power of Jian Wushuang’s two wills and the monstrous power of the heaven-cleaving skill, directly attacked. As soon as the Sword Shadow appeared...all of a sudden, the surrounding space-time froze. Then, endless space-time pressure crazily pressed toward Calamity.

The pressure of space-time and the pressure of an ultimate life form were superimposed on each other!

Calamity felt as if a huge mountain weighing hundreds of millions of kilograms had suddenly appeared on his body, causing his movements to slow down. Meanwhile, the golden long rod that he used was already weakened to a certain extent, at this moment, it actually weakened quite a bit.

In the end, that shocking blood-colored sword shadow finally collided head-on with the ‘golden thunderbolt’ that he used.

The Principles Master of the three realms of the void was supposed to crush the Immortal Saint in a head-on collision, but...bang!

After the loud sound, Calamity’s body shook violently.

“How is this possible?”

Calamity roared, but then he felt a sweet taste in his throat. He spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated backward.

Calamity and Jian Wushuang collided head-on, but Calamity was crushed and spat out blood?

“How could this be?”

“Impossible, this is impossible!”

“My God, what did I see?”

“An Immortal Saint sent Seven Leaves of the void second realm flying, but now he’s beaten Calamity of the void third realm into vomiting blood with one sword strike? Are you kidding me?”

“Is Heavenly Sword Marquis really just an Immortal Saint?”

The experts watching the battle outside the Saha Island were in a daze. Their eyes were wide open in disbelief.

They were already very shocked when they found out that Jian Wushuang had defeated Silver Wolf in the Blood Wave Realm.

However, although Silver Wolf was also a Principles Master, he had just made a breakthrough and had only grasped one part of the power of his will. When they thought of Jian Wushuang’s heaven-defying ability to cross realms, they could barely accept it.

But now...Calamity was a Principles Master in the three realms of the void. He had grasped three parts of the power of his will at the same time, which was far beyond Silver Wolf’s ability. However, Calamity was struck by Jian Wushuang’s sword until he vomited blood?

How strong was Heavenly Sword Marquis?

Everyone was in a state of shock, but at this moment, a sudden change occurred!

“Look, look at the sky!”

A sudden exclamation exploded in the void, causing many experts present to raise their heads.

Jian Wushuang also sensed something and looked up at the void above.

In the void above, the scroll world created by the Mountain River Map still existed, but in the center of the scroll world, or more accurately, in the upper part of the scroll world, a vast and surging power began to condense.

This power contained a supreme aura, as if it wanted to dominate everything in the world!

A supreme will had also descended!

When they sensed this will’s power, countless experts present were stunned!

“Heavenly Dao! It’s the Heavenly Dao!”

“The power of the Heavenly Dao’s will?”

“The supreme power of the Heavenly Dao’s will has actually descended?”

The hearts of many experts surged with great waves.

In the Divine Beginning Realm, the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao had always been an extremely special existence. It represented the Heavenly Dao and ruled over everything.

For example, behind the three great Saint Realms, there were figures with the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao.

And in the Divine Beginning Realm, whenever an existence that the Heavenly Dao could not tolerate appeared, the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao would appear and wipe them out. However, there were too few existences that the Heavenly Dao could not tolerate, therefore, the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao rarely took the initiative to condense.

However, now that the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao had arrived, and the power condensed was unprecedented, it was clear that there was an existence on the battlefield that the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao could not tolerate and had to be eliminated.

And this existence was undoubtedly Jian Wushuang!

Boom! Crack!

A deafening sound reverberated in the void. The experts present felt as if their eardrums were about to burst completely. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Heaven and earth had also been forcefully cracked open. A giant electric snake with a diameter of 100 meters descended from the nine heavens.

This electric snake was born for destruction.

It represented the supreme will of the Heavenly Dao!

It represented the power to wipe out everything!

It also represented the heavenly punishment!

Boom!

The void shattered and collapsed crazily. Jian Wushuang stood at the center of the battlefield while the destructive electric snake directly rushed toward him.

“The power of the will of heaven...”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with an endless cold light. When the electric snake appeared above his head, he smiled coldly, and an indomitable fighting spirit soared into the sky.

Jian Wushuang raised the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands at the same time, and endless divine power gathered crazily in his hands.

At this moment, he felt an unprecedented calmness in his heart.

It was not the first time he faced the power of the will of heaven. Previously, he could only escape in a sorry state, but this time, he would not escape!

“Since heaven wants to kill me, I will kill this heaven!”
