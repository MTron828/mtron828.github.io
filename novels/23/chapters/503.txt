In the early morning of the third day after Jian Wushuang woke up, Wu Yuan came to visit the young man.

In the tent, “Little Brother Wushuang, you look good. You’re getting better, right?” Wu Yuan stood in front of the young man.

“Thanks to Little Yu’s care, I’ll make a full recovery soon,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, that’s good. I’ve already told the other elders that you will join the guard, so we will be teammates,” Wu Yuan said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang also broke into a smile.

Jian Wushuang had found that the people here were warm and friendly, and Wu Yuan had invited him to join the guard of Wu Yan Tribe the day before yesterday.

“Father, Elder Brother Qing Hu said you would go out with Uncle Dragon?” Wu Yu asked while looking at his father.

“Yep.”

Wu Yuan nodded. “We received news that a monster spy was in the nearby Green Hillock Tribe, but they found out too late and he escaped. So, the leaders from the nearby tribes will lead their people through the surrounding area in hopes that they can find and kill him!”

A surge of killing intent gushed from his eyes.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was lost in thought.

He had learned a bit about this world after spending three days in this tribe.

He knew it was called the Monster Continent!

This world was different from those plane worlds, such as the Divine Land and the Ancient World because it was famous for its Demonic Beasts.

The Monster Continent was much larger than the Divine Land. Most of the territory was occupied by Demonic Beasts, so there was less than 10 percent of the territory left for Human Warriors to settle in.

Demonic Beasts and Human Warriors were born to be deadly enemies.

The monster groups, who possessed 90 percent of the territory, were more powerful than the Human Warriors, so they desired to destroy all the humans and conquer the entire continent, turning it into a paradise for Demonic Beasts.

The humans tried their best to resist and even built the Monster-exterminating League.

It consisted of the supreme commanders from human tribes. But, with only this amount of strength, the humans could barely guard the last 10 percent of the territory.

The monsters realized that they were unable to overthrow the humans by brute force, so they sent numerous monster spies and planned to destroy them from the inside.

These monster spies looked the same as Human Warriors and only Monster Discriminators could tell whether they were human beings or monsters.

Once a monster spy was found, Human Warriors would kill him without showing any mercy.

“Father, be careful,” Wu Yu said.

“Don’t worry, I’m powerful.”

After saying that, Wu Yuan left.

Looking at Wu Yuan’s back, Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Wu Yuan was powerful indeed.

He was at the Six-cloud Realm, which was equivalent to the level of superior lords from the Divine Land.

However, Human Warriors from the Monster Continent were more powerful than Warriors from the Divine Land.

Cultivating in the Monster Continent was superior to that in the Divine Land. Furthermore, as they were born to fight Demonic Beasts, Human Warriors had a hint of Demonic Beast Bloodlines.

Therefore, Human Warriors were born strong and more powerful than Warriors from the Divine Land.

Among the lords Jian Wushuang had met so far, Black Yuan Lord’s body was considered to be extremely heaven-defying, but in the Monster Continent, every lord was stronger than Black Yuan Lord.

As the tribe leader, Wu Yuan’s body was even more terrifying.

“The experts from the Divine Land are nothing when compared to the experts from the Monster Continent,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He also knew that the Wu Yan Tribe was one of the countless ordinary tribes.

There were many tribes more powerful than the Wu Yan Tribe.

The Wu Yan Tribe had more than 10,000 clansmen. They all started cultivating at 12 years old, but they improved faster than warriors from the Divine Land. In a normal case, even the most untalented clansman would be able to reach the Primordial Gold Core Realm.

Even the ordinary ones would reach the Yin-Yang Void Realm at the age of 40 or 50.

The more powerful would reach Divine Transcendence.

Even the weakest Human Warriors who reached Divine Transcendence could make it to the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. With their powerful bodies, their battle strength was Stage Two or even Stage Three.

Therefore, the Warriors from the Monster Continent were more powerful than the Divine Land.

An ordinary tribe like the Wu Yan Tribe had hundreds of Saint Realm experts and six lords.

There were countless tribes like that, so the number of such powerful experts among the entire human population was amazing. It was said that there were 33 Temple Masters in the Monster-exterminating League.

The 33 Temple Masters held supreme positions among the humans.

Jian Wushuang estimated that those Temple Masters might have broken through the Cloud Realm, which would make them as strong as the Three Ancestors.

If that was true, it was really terrifying, because they could still be so powerful under the oppression of the Demonic Beasts.

The sun sank and the night approached.

In the tent, Jian Wushuang sat with his legs crossed as he took out a beige elixir and ate it.

“This Vitality Elixir is nice. I thought that it will take me 10 days or half a month to recover, but I will have recovered in two days at most because of this Vitality Elixir,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

The Vitality Elixir was a superior second-grade pill.

Jian Wushuang found a dozen elixirs in Marquis Nanyu’s Interspatial Ring. He had been taking them these last few days and they were really helpful for his recovery.

At this moment, an uproar rose outside the tent.

“What’s happening?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised and instantly walked out.
