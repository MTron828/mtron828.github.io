Chapter 2551: Situ Clan

“Indeed, I’ve recently been seeking opportunities to gain Primordial Stones from those clans. I admit I’ve been using some lame excuses to do so. However, no matter how powerful I am, I won’t be coming after the Situ Clan so you should not need to be bothered by this at all. The Shi Clan and Wu Clan are unfazed by my actions so why did you even make the effort to seek me out?” Jian Wushuang curiously asked.

“I’ll be frank with you.” Situ Yuan was momentarily silent before slowly continued, “Although the Situ Clan is one of the three top-tier clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent, we just appeared glamorous on the outside but are actually in a deadlock with them. We’re not as wealthy as the Shi Clan and Wu Clan. Most importantly, we don’t have an Earth Ultimate God to manage the clan.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “I know of this.”

He heard about the Situ Clan’s situation from Xiao Tiexin. There would have been four top-tier clans if the Xiao Clan was not exterminated in the Northern Darkstar Continent.

These four top-tier clans were managed by the Earth Ultimate Gods but unfortunately, the Xiao Clan and Situ Clan’s Earth Ultimate Gods were long dead. On the other hand, the Earth Ultimate Gods of the Shi and Wu Clan were still alive.

“Although the overall Situ Clan isn’t weak, we aren’t that strong either. This is unlike the fearless Shi and Wu Clan even when facing the Territorial Lord. They remained respectful but were never intimidated and with their Earth Ultimate God still alive, the Territorial Lord is hesitant to go against them and would only pass on a light punishment even if they had done something wrong!”

“The Situ Clan don’t enjoy such similar treatments.”

Situ Yuan sighed before continuing, “Mr. Jian Yi has been here for a while. I’m sure you’ve heard about the Xiao Clan, right?”

“The Xiao Clan?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Xiao Tiexin who was standing next to Jian Wushuang was not as composed.

“The Xiao Clan’s situation was the same as the Situ Clan. They had a strong foundation and an extraordinary background but lacked an Earth Ultimate God protector, hence the Territorial Lord didn’t need to be mindful of accidentally irritating them. Although the Xiao Clan was sufficiently cautious to rarely provoke the Territorial Lord, I noticed his interest in the Xiao Clan’s assets and thus the Territorial Lord started maliciously making plans against the Xiao Clan. He has been holding back quite well until one day when the Xiao Clan obtained an extraordinary Heavenly Treasure. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The Territorial Lord could no longer endure and ended up exterminating the Xiao Clan who were unable to resist.

“The Xiao Clan and Situ Clan practically lived in each other’s shoes. We’re no better off compared to them and there’s a high possibility the Territorial Lord will do the same to us,” said Situ Yuan.

Jian Wushuang understood.

He understood Situ Yuan’s worries.

It was wise of the Situ Clan to stay on guard and be prepared for the worst.

“Clan Leader, I understand what you’re trying to say. The Territorial Lord has no intentions to launch an attack on your clan from the way I see it. Even if he did, I won’t be of much help. Why waste these Primordial Stones on me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Mr. Jian Yi, you’ve misunderstood my intentions.” Situ Yuan smiled faintly. “I don’t expect protection from you when the Situ Clan is in trouble. What we want is just to befriend you. We’ve been doing that with many parties in the Northern Darkstar Continent!

“Many experts in the Northern Darkstar Continent including two Official Army Commanders have received gifts from the Situ Clan. We do this not because we’re expecting protection in return, but to create an impression of having many allies.

“After these people received Situ Clan’s gifts, they became more easy-going and fostered a bond with us. If the Territorial Lord attacks us, he has to be mindful of our allies. If the Territorial Lord decides to take action on us we’ll also probably end up like the Xiao Clan. Although we’re not expecting our friends to avenge us, we hope they’ll at least be disgusted by the Territorial Lord’s unscrupulous actions.

“That’s the impression we want to build. Though it might seem like much, we’re still willing to do our best.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded after Situ Yuan finished speaking. “By doing so, the Situ Clan will seem to have made many friends while causing the Territorial Lord to hesitate when dealing with the Situ Clan.”

“Yes. The Xiao Clan had also done this but weren’t as generous and persistent as us,” said Situ Yuan.

Jian Wushuang was processing all the information provided to him.

The Situ Clan had forked out 100,000 Primordial Stones just to befriend him. The Xiao Clan Leader probably had not done the same.

“Is Mr. Jian Yi willing to accept Situ Clan’s gift?” Situ Yuan smiled.

“I’ll take it of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “I won’t decline such good intentions.”

Jian Wushuang took the Interspatial Ring without hesitation.

The reason he needed so many Primordial Stones was for his Ultimate God Real breakthrough to then challenge the Territorial Lord and take over his position.

Once he succeeded, the Situ Clan’s current plans would come to fruition.

“By the way, could I ask you for a favor if you don’t mind, Clan Leader?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.

“Mr. Jian Yi, please tell me what your desires are.” Situ Yuan was very humble.

Jian Wushuang explained, “I urgently need more Primordial Stones. What you’ve sent me is still not enough. I have plenty of resources taken from the Dark Thunder Territory. Its estimated value is approximately one hundred seventy thousand Primordial Stones. In addition to the gifts given by those many Clans in the past few days, the treasures I’ve accumulated should be worth more than two hundred thousand Primordial Stones. I wonder if the Clan Leader could figure out a way to exchange these resources into Primordial Stones?”
