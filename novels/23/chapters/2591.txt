Chapter 2592: Wiping Out the Soul

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Zhong Hun was hesitating.

He was a genuine Heaven Ultimate God and good at soul attacks. He had many techniques but yet to fully recover his soul power which was merely at the Peak Earth Ultimate God realm. Therefore, most of his techniques’ full strength could not be displayed.

For example, the Soul Devil Hell which he displayed did not harm Jian Wushuang.

Based on his current strength, there was only one technique he was able to display confidently to kill the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

The only concern remains in the extreme difficulty of using that technique at his current strength level, hence his hesitation.

“The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is only a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God, but his combat power is very impressive. Especially in the Principle World, he has opened up the ultimate Sword World. Such a genius must have previously obtained some useful and valuable opportunities with the opportunities probably being kept in his Interspatial Ring. I suspect his armor has also reached the Heavenly Treasure level...” Zhong Hun was secretly groaning.

“Although using that technique is very taxing when I’m already in such a serious injury state and my not completely recovered strength, I can always absorb more cultivators’ soul power!

“Let’s do it!”

Zhong Hun decided with a sharp light shone in his eyes.

The surging soul power rose in an instant and very obviously became as vast as the sea. It immediately began to compress at an astonishing speed after its emergence and formed a black halo in the blink of an eye. He then violently slapped his forehead between his eyebrows and spat out two drops of bright red blood essence.

The two drops of blood essence integrated into the black halo and instantly skyrocketed his divine power breath.

“Secret technique, God’s Punishment!”

Zhong Hun screamed in his heart as a dark soul beam burst out from the black halo.

The soul power contained in the soul beam was terrifying.

After the beam was unleashed, Zhong Hun’s complexion instantly turned pale but a glimpse of a grin could be seen in his eyes.

Zhong Hun had to pay a huge price to unleash that blow. It was the strongest move he could use at that time with its power comparable to a soul attack he could display at his peak. It also meant that the blow was an attack of the Heaven Ultimate God level!

“I don’t believe you can survive this blow!” Zhong Hun was confident.

The soul beam zoomed across the void. The surrounding became quiet as though there were no movements at all.

Jian Wushuang had been combating the three huge demon shadows which did not harm him.

At the same time, he had been vigilantly keeping an eye on the surrounding void and knew the hiding Zhong Hun in the surrounding void might cast a soul attack on him at any time.

The soul beam swept toward Jian Wushuang as expected.

Jian Wushuang was startled with no techniques he could use to ward off the soul attack. He could only depend on the Exquisite Pagoda in his sea of consciousness to withstand the attack.

Boom!

The terrifying soul beam blasted fiercely on the Exquisite Pagoda as the pagoda wildly shook and almost gave way.

The soul beam suddenly evolved. It was originally a beam but quickly turned into a soul spear that was so sharp it pierced a hole through the Exquisite Pagoda. A hole that exposed Jian Wushuang’s soul to the soul spear.

“Oops!” Jian Wushaung’s expression drastically changed.

Boom!

The soul spear carried a shocking power and bombarded Jian Wushuang’s soul.

Jian Wushuang’s soul was not strong without the Exquisite Pagoda’s protection. His cultivation period in that lifetime was too short and his cultivation realm was too low after all. He was only a High-level Ultimate God and so was his soul power level. His soul was only stronger and more tenacious than a similarly leveled cultivator because he was a Perfect Chaotic Creature.

However, no matter how tough his soul was, it was only a High-level Ultimate God’s soul. How could he possibly withstand a Heaven Ultimate God’s soul attack?

Jian Wushuang’s entire soul was instantly penetrated by the soul spear which exuded a monstrous power and completely crushed Jian Wushuang’s soul.

Jian Wushuang’s tangible soul was completely crushed and obliterated. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang’s figure completely stopped and suspended there.

Zhong Hun who was watching the entire scene in the surrounding dark void wore a wide grin on his face.

“Indeed, he’s just a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God after all.” Zhong Hun laughed and he wanted to move forward.

He sensed Jian Wushuang’s soul had been completely wiped out and it was impossible for one who was dead to die again.

He had no scruples since Jian Wushuang was dead.

As his figure was about to move, he halted once again.

He noticed Jian Wushuang who was dead with his soul completely wiped out in the void up front opened his eyes again and looked straight at Zhong Hun with his cold eyes.

“What?” Zhong Hun was stunned.

“Are you there?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he instantly applied the Secret Star Technique. As soon as he used the secret technique, the divine power breath on his body instantly soared as his aura leaped from the Primary-level Earth Ultimate God to High-level Earth Ultimate God under the black stone’s disguise.

At the same time, an infinite golden divine power swept out crazily before the 3,000-feet-tall Golden God Shadow suddenly formed behind him.

Hum!

Jian Wushuang made a move.

A total of 300 apparitions were created at the same time with that single move that was located everywhere. The three demon shadows which were surrounding him could not tell which was the real Jian Wushuang as they could only frantically wave those black soul chains around and tried their best to attack the real Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s real self went past those three demon shadows and aimed straight at Zhong Hun.

“This is impossible!”

Zhong Hun was flabbergasted as he did not expect that to happen.

Based on his knowledge, it was impossible for the situation before to happen.

The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord in front of him was dead with his soul completely penetrated, crushed, and obliterated.

His soul was completely wiped out. Not even an Undying Saint with an immortal body was able to survive under those circumstances.

However... He was alive!

Jian Wushuang was still alive!

His soul was obliterated, yet he was still alive and could still carry on attacking with his combat power barely affected.
