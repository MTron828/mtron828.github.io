4725 Ascending to the Heavenly Court

Jian Wushuang’s face was full of black lines. Looking at the magnificent posture of the Heavenly Court in the Heavenly Realm, he was afraid that even if he really wanted to attack the lair of Zhen Wuyang, he would not be able to.

“I’m not thinking of doing anything. You’ve misunderstood.” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly and then told the whole story.

In the end, there was silence in the Boyang Bottle, which was then followed by a burst of excitement that could not be suppressed.

“That’s great! Young Friend, you can continue to maintain your relationship with that troublesome Young Emperor and gain his trust. When the three of us recover, we can come and destroy Zhen Wuyang’s old nest. It’s so convenient and fast!”

“T-that’s not very good.” Jian Wushuang’s mouth twitched.

“Young Friend, don’t feel too much psychological pressure. Just act as usual and make your presence known. Leave the rest to us!”

“…”

“This really saved us a lot of effort. This old man Zhen Wuyang would never have thought that we are right beside him!”

“Shush, keep quiet. We must not reveal our aura. We’ll leave everything to our Young Friend.”

“Little Friend, you have to take care of yourself from now on. Don’t call us out unless you have no choice. We’ll recharge our energy.”

Jian Wushuang still wanted to speak, but the cork of the Boyang Bottle was directly closed, not giving him any chance.

He smiled bitterly.

At this moment, Cheng Qing’s voice came from outside the carriage. “Brother Jian, we should get off the carriage.”

Jian Wushuang responded and then left the Imperial chariot with Chun Qiu.

Stepping on the vast clouds, Cheng Qing took the lead and ran over. He laughed and said, “Brother Jian, how do you feel?”

Looking around, Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “Not bad.”

As they conversed, figures that were either riding on cranes, flying swords, or riding carriages gathered in front of the heavenly gate.

Looking around, without exception, they were all in the Yan Immortal stage.

Countless seven-colored lotus peaks shone in the sky. In the center of the nine boundless Heavenly Realms, there was a Great Road paved by the clouds.

There were already close to a hundred figures gathered outside the Heavenly Gate.

Under the guidance of the thin purple robe, the Young Emperor, who was wearing a bloodstained court dress, slowly walked down the Imperial carriage.

The hundreds of Yan Immortals who were also waiting looked at each other when they saw the Young Emperor in a sorry state. They then cupped their hands unwillingly and said, “Greetings, Young Emperor.”

Without even looking at the perfunctory Yan Immortals, the Young Emperor walked toward Jian Wushuang with light steps.

“Brother Jian, follow me.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. After looking around again, he stood behind the Young Emperor.

There were only six Yan Immortals left, with one Ancestor level following by his side. He did not even have a guard of honor. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Looking at the Young Emperor’s slightly embarrassed figure, the hundreds of Yan Immortals all had different thoughts.

The guards of the Heavenly Gate were tens of Yan Immortals in silver helmets.

The two Yan Immortals in the front split their axes and stepped forward, cupping their hands. “Greetings, Young Emperor. The Emperor has ordered that before the time is up, you are not to…”

Before he could finish, the Young Emperor suddenly raised his leg without any warning and kicked the two Yan Immortals.

“Get lost!” the Young Emperor said gloomily, then strode into the Heavenly Gate. No one dared to stop him

The two Yan Immortals who were kicked away were covered in dust and dirt, standing in a daze.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and threw the axes at the two of them. Then, he followed the Young Emperor and stepped on the Great Road.

The figures waiting outside the Heavenly Gate began to discuss in low voices.

One of the Elders with white hair and beard held a horsetail whisk and snorted coldly. “He’s getting more and more arrogant. In my opinion, after this banquet, the position of the Young Emperor should belong to Prince Jiu!”

“Fujie, aren’t you afraid that the wind will cut your tongue? If your words were to reach the Young Emperor’s ears, you’ll probably be stabbed twice before you can even leave the Heavenly Court.”

One of the middle-aged men with an extraordinary temperament seemed to be at odds with the white-haired Elder and sneered in response.

The expression of the Elder named Fujie changed slightly as if he had recalled something. He no longer spoke and closed his eyes in deep thought.

At this moment, more and more Imperial carriages gathered in front of the Heavenly Gate.

On these Imperial banners, there were different words.

In front of the ten Imperial chariots, the ‘Ji’ flag fluttered in the wind.

Then, a figure wearing a white court dress stepped out of the carriage.

Seeing this, the group of Yan Immortals who were standing on their own hurriedly stepped forward and cupped their hands, “Greetings, Second Young Master.”

The handsome young man, who was dressed in a plain court robe, raised his eyebrows when he saw the carriage, which had the ‘Yan’ flag on the back. He then looked at the Yan Immortals who had come to greet him and smiled. “Immortals, please follow Prince Jiu to the Heavenly Court.”

“Yes.” The group of Yan Immortals agreed with smiles on their faces.

As the Prince strode into the Heavenly Realm, dozens of Imperial carriages gathered in succession.

And in front of these Imperial carriages, there were their own words.

Yu, Qian, Mo, Hua, Lin.

The figures who were dressed in court attire and walked out of the carriage slowly had different expressions. After smiling at each other, they followed their respective companions and stepped into the Heavenly Gate.

As he walked on the Great Road, Jian Wushuang felt that Yan power in his body was changing at a perceivable speed.

At the same time, a majestic voice resounded throughout the entire Heavenly Realm.

“The Heavenly Court is open. Immortals, please take your seats.”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the front. At the very front of the Great Road was the magnificent Heavenly Court.

Ever since the Young Emperor woke up, his face had been extremely gloomy, and his hostility was so dense that it seemed to have materialized. It was as if he was not going to a banquet, but to kill.

On the way here, after being intercepted and killed, the clothes of Jian Wushuang and the others were more or less damaged and stained with blood. They looked very fierce.

They did not know how much time had passed as they strolled forward. When the Heavenly Court with thousands of waterfalls appeared in front of them, a rainbow bridge connected the heaven from the Heavenly Realm to the Heavenly Court, which was magnificent and bold.

More than 100 children came over on the rainbow bridge, their red lips and white teeth. No one would have thought that these children were all extremely powerful top cultivators.

“Amy greets the Young Emperor.” A little girl in the lead flew into the Young Emperor’s arms and grinned.

Only then did the Young Emperor’s hostility subside.

“Little Amy, have you been slacking off in your cultivation all these years when I wasn’t around?” His expression softened a little, which was a rare sight. He carried the little girl and slowly walked forward.

The little girl tilted her head and said in embarrassment, “Amy is a little lazy. After all, cultivation is very boring. Look, I’ve lost a lot of hair because of this.”
