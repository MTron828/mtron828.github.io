Di Xi continued and said, “Even if you compete for a better ranking in the second stage, it will not matter much!”

“After all, the experts from the old sects don’t care about your current strength, only your potential.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You just need to show your talent and potential in Sky Valley. It doesn’t matter if you enter the top 10 of the Ranking. As long as your talent and potential are high, the experts from those old sects will naturally come to you.”

After hearing this, the eyes of Jian Wushuang and the others brightened.

Indeed, they did not have to compete for the top 10 ranks in the Point Battle. After all, they attached more importance to the old sects rather than the Rankings.

As long as those old sects paid attention to them and accepted them as disciples, that was enough.

“Tomorrow, there will be a lot of old sects that come to watch the battle. There will also be a top sect called the Wilderness Sword Sect,” said Di Xi with a smile, then he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Wilderness Sword Sect? ” Jian Wushuang asked and raised his eyebrows.

He was a warrior that focused on Sword Principle. He was naturally eager to join a sect that excelled in Sword Principle.

Obviously, the Wilderness Sword Sect was most suitable for him.

“Jian Wushuang, With your talent, as long as you perform well in the Point Battle, you will attract the experts from the Wilderness Sword Sect,” Di Xi said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded seriously and a glimmer of desire emerged in his eyes.

“By the way, there is one more thing,” Di Xi said as he looked around again.

“The Point Battle will be launched among teams of warriors from the same dynasty.”

“The twelve dynasties should have 12 teams, but the two large empires have more geniuses participating in the Point Battle since their overall strength is better. Therefore, they will be separated into four teams. Altogether, there should be 14 teams competing in the Point Battle.”

“You six are naturally a team. But since you are a team, you need a leader. The team leader must be chosen by you!”

“I think it should be based on strength. Jian Wushuang’s strength is the best among us, so the leader should him,” Feng Yutian said without hesitation.

“I agree.” Baili Chen raised his brows.

“I agree, too.” Mu Yingying nodded.

Naturally, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou also agreed.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang touched his nose and gave a faint smile.

“In that case, it has been determined,” Di Xi also smiled and said, “Jian Wushuang, the next two weeks are up to you.”

“I’ll warn you again...”

“When you leave tomorrow, you will each be given a token. If you find yourself at your limit, you must immediately crumple the token. This is equivalent to giving up the battle. Someone will come and take you away from Sky Valley. In any case, staying alive is more important.”

“Yes. ” Jian Wushuang and the others nodded.

“From here on,?you can only rely on yourselves. I wish you all good luck,” Di Xi said, and then he immediately left.

Jian Wushuang and the others looked towards the huge valley in front of them with great enthusiasm.

Tomorrow, in that valley, they would finally meet with the geniuses from the other 11 dynasties.

...

In the morning, as dawn was just breaking.

As the sun began rising above the vast plains with the first red rays, gusts of battle intent were also rising.

At the 12 entrances to Sky Valley, numerous talented geniuses from the 12 dynasties had already begun gearing up. They were waiting to enter the valley and begin their most intense battles.

At one of the entrances to Sky Valley, the remaining six geniuses of the Tianzong Dynasty were waiting together.

“This is the token representing your identity. Each of you has only one token. After entering Sky Valley, you must always wear this token on a conspicuous place of your body, so that the geniuses of the other dynasties can recognize you,” That purple-robed elder said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang and others felt it was quite strange but did not ask more.

Soon after, a huge bell sounded and the whole Sky Valley suddenly became turbulent.

“It’s time. Enter!” the purple-robed elder said and waved.

There was a hint of excitement in the six people’s eyes as they moved directly along the entrance to the dense valley.

At the same time, the geniuses of the other dynasties were also entering Sky Valley.

The Easternmost Hunt was held every ten years, and its climax was the Point Battle in Sky Valley. Now the game had begun.

While the geniuses of the 12 dynasties rushed into Sky Valley, there was something in the air above the highest point in Sky Valley.

Rumbled ~~~ Figures radiating an oppressive atmosphere were standing there.

Some of their auras were hot, some were cold, some were violent, and some were easy-going.

The Monarchs of the 12 dynasties were all here, with guards separating them from the experts. In addition, the most noticeable experts were from the old sects.

The experts from the old sects had arrived early this morning.

At a glance, there were no fewer than 10 old sects, and the most striking sect was definitely the Wilderness Sword Sect.

A total of three people came from the Wilderness Sword Sect.

The leader of the three people was a middle-aged man with birdeyes. He was carrying a long sword and sitting on a suspended seat, with a towering aura. His entire body gave off the impression of a sword.

This middle-aged man was followed by two other people. They were also carrying long swords and their auras were cold. Both of them had obviously entered the Yang Void Realm.

Warriors of Yang Void Realm were naturally the most supreme experts in the Tianzong Dynasty.

However, in the old sects on the Nanyang Continent, there were many warriors in the Yang Void Realm.

“Mr. Lingtian, I never expected you to come in person this time.”

“Mr. Lingtian, I haven’t seen you for many years. How are you?”

“Haha, Brother Lingtian, I did not realize that the Wilderness Sword Sect was also interested in the Easternmost Hunt.”

Many of the surrounding experts and monarchs had greeted the middle-aged man with birdeyes.

This middle-aged man, named Mo Lingtian, was a Law-enforcement Elder in the Wilderness Sword Sect. He had an extremely high status in the Wilderness Sword Sect, so it was normal for so many people to attempt to flatter him.

However, Mo Lingtian seemed very cold and indifferent to these people. To the people who called out to him, he just casually responded with a word.

At the bottom of his heart, Mo Lingtian was full of disdain towards these people, including the two monarchs of the large empires. He never cared for them at all.

“Just a small northwest district that can be neglected in the entire Nanyang continent! What kind of geniuses can be born in such a small place? What was the Sect Master thinking when he made me come here?”

Mo Lingtian was very reluctant.

He did not want to come here, he was only following the Sect Master’s order.

As for the 12 dynasties in the northwest, he looked down on them from the bottom of his heart. The so-called geniuses of the 12 dynasties in the northwest were negligible at best.

Coming here was only a pretense. He did not plan to bring any disciples with him to the Wilderness Sword Sect.
