Chapter 1673:

A Presumptuous Request

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Comprehending that Seven Star Pattern has indeed caused my abilities to skyrocket. However, even with that, I am still not confident that I can leave safely,” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave.

“I have already given you the opportunity. As for whether you can leave this place alive, that’s none of my business.” Long Qi said indifferently, “Of course, if you really have no confidence, you can continue training in this palace for a period of time and leave when you are powerful enough.”

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang frowned.

He was sure that outside the standalone space, there were a huge number of Star Demons. As soon as he went out, he would definitely be hunted down by the Star Demons crazily. Moreover, with his current abilities, it was totally impossible for him to escape from the Dark Region with those Star Demons besieging him.

It would only be possible if he could make a breakthrough and become a Stage Two Ultimate Real God.

However, to reach that stage, he would need to accumulate a huge amount of Divine Power. Furthermore, it would take a long time for the Divine Power to accumulate.

By just relying on his own training, he would still be unable to make a breakthrough even after a hundred thousand years’ time.

Moreover, to him, a hundred thousand years’ time was too long.

“The space and time of the Dark Region is special. Hence, I cannot send a message out. With that, I am also unable to request for help from the Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Even the Lineage of Star did not know that he had chased Real God Zi Ye to the Dark Region. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At that moment, the Lineage of Star was probably looking for his whereabouts anxiously. However, it was near to impossible for the Lineage of Star to expand their search all the way into the Dark Region.

Since he was unable to rely on the Lineage of Star, he could only rely on himself.

“Just relying blindly on my own training to accumulate Divine Power will waste too much time. The only shortcut is to find a way to get more Demon Cores,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

He was in the Dark Region which was the place that was most concentrated with Star Demons as well as the place with the most powerful Star Demons. Hence, it would be extremely difficult to go on a killing spree wantonly in such a place to obtain Demon Cores. However, it was not impossible.

“Lord Long Qi, I would like to make a presumptuous request,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

“Tell me your request,” Long Qi shot a glance at Jian Wushuang.

“For the next period of time, I will try to go outside and hunt for Star Demons. Thus, I would like to have the right to enter this standalone space freely,” Jian Wushuang felt a bit nervous.

After all, there were no friendly relations between him and Lord Long Qi. Previously, Long Qi had only saved him as he had cultivated the Secret Skill of Seven Star as well. Moreover, Long Qi also gave him an opportunity. All these actions were just Long Qi being kind. However, at that moment, he still requested Long Qi to give him the right to enter the standalone space freely.

The standalone space was the sleeping place of Long Qi’s Master, who was the black-robed man lying in the coffin.

“I can agree to this. However, it will be limited to one thousand years. After one thousand years, you have to leave,” Long Qi said.

“One thousand years?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and he nodded his head immediately, “That’s more than enough.”

“Alright. I will create a space passage that links this place to the outside world. For the next one thousand years, you can use that space passage to enter and exit this place freely,” Long Qi said.

“Lord, thank you very much,” Jian Wushuang was delighted.

“You can take your time and train here.” After talking, Long Qi’s body disappeared with a flash.

After Long Qi left, Jian Wushaung sat down with his legs crossed right away.

“If I wish to leave this place quickly, I have to obtain a huge number of Demon Cores so that I can make a breakthrough. As for the way to obtain Demon Cores…” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly. He already had a plan in his mind.

“There’s no rush. Let me first absorb the pure power from the Demon Cores that I currently have.”

Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically. With a wave of his big hands, a huge number of Demon Cores appeared in front of him.

Those Demon Cores were obtained by Jian Wushuang from Real God Zi Ye’s Qian Kun Ring.

Real God Zi Ye had been travelling in the core area of the Eighth Lair throughout the years and he had been doing so for more than thousands of years. Thus, during the thousands of years, he had naturally obtained many Demon Cores from hunting Star Demons. However, after Jian Wushuang had killed him, those Demon Cores had naturally landed in the hands of Jian Wushuang and there were hundreds of them.

Of course, among the hundreds of Demon Cores, most of them were Grade One Demon Cores and Grade Two Demon Cores. As for Grade Three Demon Cores, there were very few of them.

Moreover, among the Demon Cores, the highest-grade Demon Core was a Crimson Core.

This Demon Core was obtained by Jian Wushuang after using his trump card to kill a Three-Horned Crimson Star Demon.

The amount of pure power that the Crimson Core contained was extremely shocking.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang started to absorb the pure power from the Demon Cores with great concentration immediately.

However, he did not know that Lord Long Qi was secretly observing him from somewhere within the Crystal Palace.

He was observing each and every action of Jian Wushuang.

“This little kid is absorbing the power within the Demon Cores?” Long Qi frowned, “The power within the Demon Cores are exceptionally pure and it is a great idea to absorb them. However, the Divine Power that this little kid possesses is extremely strange!”

Jian Wushuang possessed the Ultimate Divine Power, which was completely different from the Divine Power of a normal Real God.

The only thing was that normal experts would not be able to tell such a kind of special Divine Power apart. Within the Eternal Chaotic World, even many Almighties would be unable to tell it apart. They would at most think that Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power was many times stronger than someone else who was of a similar realm to him.

As for Long Qi… as an expert from the Ancient Past, he could tell that Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power was not normal.

“Even though he has just entered the Pure Sun Realm, his Divine Power is so strong. The cultivation techniques that this little kid cultivates are not normal. Moreover, I can also feel a very peculiar treasure from him. What will this treasure be?”

…

It would require time to absorb the Demon Cores.

The higher the level of the Demon Core, the slower the absorption speed.

With hundreds of Demon Cores and even a Crimson Core, Jian Wushuang only finished absorbing all the pure power from the Demon Cores after a total of eleven years.

Moreover, after he was done with the absorption, his body, which had originally contained five droplets of Ultimate Divine Power, had managed to form the sixth droplet at that moment. Furthermore, he was very close to forming the seventh Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet.

“A little bit more, just a little bit more and the seventh Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet will be formed.”

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and his eyes were glowing brilliantly.

He could feel very clearly that he was getting closer and closer to Stage Two Ultimate Real God.

“I have finished absorbing all the Demon Cores that I have obtained from Real God Zi Ye. Next, it’s about time for me to execute my plan,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. At the next moment, he stood up slowly, stretched his body and headed out of the palace immediately.

After walking out of the Crystal Palace, what Jian Wushuang saw was still the giant standalone space and, at the end of his field of vision, there was a space passage.

Without much hesitation, Jian Wushuang’s body turned vague and he entered the space passage straight away.
