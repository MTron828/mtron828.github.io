Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You will soon find out why I killed him.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch smiled faintly. “I’ll first get Blood Rain Demon Monarch, who is controlling the array formation, to come out.”

“Blood Rain.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch shouted loudly.

Blood Rain Demon Monarch immediately walked out of the array formation.

“Thousand-edge, this must be the famous Thousand Kills Emperor Lord by your side.” Blood Rain Demon Monarch smiled.

“Blood Rain Demon Monarch, it is rumored that you are good at arrays. In terms of arrays alone, there aren’t many people in the entire Demon Dragon Region who can compare to you. I’ve finally met you today.” Thousand Kills Emperor Lord said.

He did not dare to be arrogant. Although in terms of strength, he was slightly stronger than Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, there were not many who were stronger.

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch could fight him head-on, and Blood Rain Demon Monarch’s array formation was impressive, so he was not afraid of him.

The three met and exchanged greetings.

“Blood Rain, how is Blood Sword Master now?” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch asked.

“Don’t worry. For the past 600 years, he has been trapped in this array formation, but he has not taken a single step out,” Blood Rain Demon Monarch said with a smile.

“That’s good.” Thousand Edge Demon Monarch was delighted. “He has been trapped for 600 years. Has he been impatient?”

“No.” Blood Rain Demon Monarch shook his head. “This Blood Sword Master is very strange. He has been trapped in my array formation for 600 years, but he is not anxious at all. Furthermore, from his actions over the years, it feels like he has been cultivating.”

“Cultivating?” Thousand Edge Demon Monarch was taken aback.

“Yes, he seems to be cultivating, but I don’t know what he is cultivating.” Blood Rain Demon Monarch said.

“Haha, it seems that this Blood Sword Master’s attitude is really good. After being trapped within the array for 600 years, he isn’t in a hurry at all, yet he is in the mood to cultivate.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch laughed coldly, “But that’s right. With such a powerful life-saving technique, he indeed has nothing to fear. It’s just that he has yet to witness how powerful Thousand Kills Emperor Lord is.”

“You two, let’s enter the formation first. Let me see who you want to kill,” the Emperor Lord said.

“Okay, let’s enter the formation first.” The Demon Monarch nodded.

Blood Rain Demon Monarch immediately opened the entrance of the formation and the three of them entered the formation together.

As soon as they entered the formation, the demon master saw Jian Wushuang sitting cross-legged somewhere in the void, surrounded by black flames.

Although he forced his eyes to open, he still casually attacked the black flames.

“Huh?”

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch also noticed Jian Wushuang, but when he saw him, his pupils shrank. “Principles Master? Thousand-edge, the person you want to kill is just a Principles Master?”

“I’m ashamed. Blood Sword Master is indeed a Principles Master. There’s no doubt about that. However, his battle strength is very strong, and he’s comparable to an ordinary third-level Ruler. What’s truly terrifying is his life-saving skills. Blood Rain and I have used all our skills, but we can’t do anything to him. We can only let Blood Rain set up the formation and trap him here,” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch said.

“Is that so?” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch understood and did not look down on Thousand-edge Demon Monarch.

He also understood that a Principles Master must be extraordinary to be able to survive in the Eternal Dark Prison until now.

“Now I finally know why you, thousand-edge, are so desperate to ask me to kill him.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch glanced at the Wu Qi Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand with a strange look in his eyes, obviously, he had already seen through the Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand and even the principle supreme treasure.

“Tsk, tsk, the Principle Supreme Treasure Divine Sword. If you, Thousand-edge, can get this Principle Supreme Treasure Divine Sword, your strength will definitely increase greatly. You might even be able to match the ten kings. If I had known earlier, I would have offered a higher price.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch sighed softly.

“Thousand-edge, we have already agreed,” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch said.

“Don’t worry. I, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, won’t go so far as to raise the price. Since I’ve already promised you, I won’t go back on my word.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch smiled faintly. “You two will be by my side later. Watch how I kill him.”

“Then Blood Rain and I will wait and see.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch also smiled.

When Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, Thousand Kills Emperor Lord, and Blood Rain Demon Monarch entered the formation, Jian Wushuang immediately sensed their arrival. He immediately stopped what he was doing and looked up at them.

“Finally, you’ve invited helpers?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Thousand-edge Demon Monarch with a faint smile. Then, his eyes focused on the majestic middle-aged Thousand Kills Emperor Lord. “May I know who you are?”

“Blood Sword Master, let me introduce you. This is Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, the publicly acknowledged number one expert in the 87th dark zone,” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch said.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed as he quickly recalled the information he had obtained from Demon Monarch Ancient Night.

However, it was clear that there was no such expert in the information given by Demon Monarch Ancient Night.

However, this was very normal. Demon Monarch Ancient Night was only a Ruler at the peak of the second level. He could not be considered a peak expert in the first level of the Eternal Prison. The information he knew about the experts was mostly from the ninth dark zone, as for the entire Demon Dragon Region, although he knew of the existence of some experts, there were many things he did not know.

For example, Demon Monarch Ancient Night did not know about the current Thousand-edge Demon Monarch.

“The 87th dark area?”

Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh, “The 108 dark areas of the Magic Dragon region are extremely vast. From the 9th dark area to the 87th dark area, there is an unknown distance between them. You, Thousand Kills Emperor Lord, actually went to the 87th dark area and personally invited this Thousand-edge Demon Monarch over. It seems that you are very confident that he can kill me.”

“Hmph, Thousand Kills Emperor Lord’s strength is ranked in the top ten in the entire Demon Dragon Region, and his strongest technique is incomparably tyrannical. If he can’t kill you, then in the entire first level of the Eternal Dark Prison, only the ten supreme monarchs can do anything to you. No matter what, you are only a Principles Masters. I don’t believe that your life-saving techniques are truly that amazing.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s gaze was cold.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, please make your move.”

A majestic killing intent instantly rose from Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s body. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The intensity of this killing intent was shocking.

Even the killing intent emitted by Thousand-edge Demon Monarch when he used the heaven-punishing sword was not as strong as Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s own killing intent.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s name is Thousand-edge, and his killing intent alone is shocking. I really want to know how many people he has killed in the Eternal Dark Prison.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, his expression had become extremely solemn.
