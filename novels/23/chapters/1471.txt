Chapter 1472: Hopeless

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“To be able to see a junior from the Lineage of Scarlet in my remaining years and know that Lineage of Scarlet still exists in Eternal Chaotic World, I, Fiery King can die with no regrets,” Fiery King smiled and said.

Jian Wushuang could understand Fiery King’s feelings.

Over the years, he had been imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison and he was cut off from the outside world.

He wasn’t sure how Lineage of Scarlet was doing and whether if it was destroyed. He had been worried.

Then, when he finally met Jian Wushuang, he found out that Lineage of Scarlet still existed and had already steadied their foundation in Snow Kingdom. Fiery King could finally feel at ease.

“Mister Fiery King, don’t worry. With your ability, there will definitely be a day when you can leave Sky Sword Prison,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Leave?” Fiery King shook his head slowly, “It isn’t that easy to leave Sky Sword Prison. I’m afraid there won’t be a day where I leave here.”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

From Jian Wushuang’s point of view, Fiery King was widely recognized as the top expert.

Even the other three Kings had to bow down before him.

Such an expert, if he were to carry out a major massacre, should be able to kill many experts. Through accumulation over the years, it would just be a matter of time until he fulfilled the criteria to leave the prison.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re only a Universe God. To a Universe God, as long as you kill a hundred of Universe God of the same level or ten Real Gods, you can leave. However, for a Real God, the criteria is different!” Fiery King smiled faintly as he explained.

“A Real God who wants to leave Sky Sword Prison has to kill a thousand experts and they must not take their levels into consideration. In other words, even if you kill Real Gods of the same level, it will be counted as one. You know everyone’s defense power in Sky Sword Prison is very high, they aren’t that easy to kill. Plus, there are not many experts in Sky Sword Prison. It is too difficult for a Real God to kill a thousand experts in the prison!”

“It’s really difficult, but there’s a string of hope,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes, there’s a string of hope. The hope is to accumulate over the years. Even if I only kill one expert every ten thousand years, I’d be able to fulfill the criteria in ten million years. However, the mentioned criteria was for ordinary Real God but I am one of the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison!”

“As Kings, our criteria to leave is even tougher!” Fiery King said.

“Tougher? Could it be that they ask you to kill ten thousand experts?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Ten thousand? No, as Kings, we have to kill a thousand, but the one thousand that we kill have to be Real Gods!” Fiery King said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Kill Real Gods!

Kill a thousand Real Gods, then he could leave Sky Sword Prison?

How could Real Gods be killed so easily? Plus, comparing Real Gods to Universe Gods, the numbers were much less. Since the birth of Sky Sword Prison, including all Real Gods that had died and left, he reckoned there weren’t more than three hundred of them!

There weren’t even more than three hundred Real Gods who had been imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, how could the four Kings kill a thousand Real Gods?

“Jian Wushuang, now you know why I felt hopeless about leaving Sky Sword Prison?” Fiery King smiled faintly but Jian Wushuang saw the smile and found it extremely sad.

Jian Wushuang grew distressed.

At the same time, he pitied Fiery King and the other three Kings.

The four Kings in Sky Sword Prison looked so enchanting and were treated as overlords in Sky Sword Prison.

But, in actual fact, the four Kings were much sadder than any other experts in Sky Sword Prison.

After all, although it was dangerous for the other experts to stay in Sky Sword Prison and the probability of them falling wasn’t low, they stood a chance to leave Sky Sword Prison after all.

However, the four Kings seemed to not stand a chance at all.

To kill a thousand Real Gods…

Even Jian Wushuang himself reckoned that it would be hopeless.

“Of course, if we four Kings want to leave Sky Sword Prison, there is another possibility,” Fiery King said.

“How?” Jian Wushuang turned to look at Fiery King.

“Breakthrough, breakthrough and become the second stage of Real God!” Fiery God explained, “The stage is second to Almighty. It is far stronger than ordinary first stage Real God. Experts at that stage, even Sky Sword Prison can’t imprison them. Hence, the owner of Sky Sword Mountain once said that if we were to breakthrough to that stage, we could leave as well.”

“It’s a pity that it isn’t that easy to break through to that stage.”

“Eternal Chaotic World, there are so many Real God experts. But just how many of them could really take that leap? At least, from what I know, I am hopeless in this life. Not only myself, but the other three Kings don’t have any hope either.”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave as he nodded in agreement.

“Alright, forget about that. Let’s talk about you,” Fiery King looked at Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, why are you imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison? Why are you chased after by Blood Emperor and Heartless King?”

“Er… This…” Jian Wushuang thought for a while and briefly told Fiery King the story.

“Oh, Lineage of Star? You are a disciple of Star Palace?” Fiery King looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise. He had once wandered in ten Cultivation Sanctuaries alone. He had heard of Lineage of Star and disciple of Star Palace before.

“Haha, your higher up in Lineage of Star is quite interesting. He sent you to murder in Sky Sword Mountain. It was obviously to provoke the owner of Sky Sword Mountain,” Fiery King laughed.

“No one denied it,” Jian Wushuang pouted, then briefly explained why Blood Emperor was after him.

“Holocaust Sect?”

“You mean Blood Emperor is Holocaust Sect’s man?”

Fiery King’s gaze turned cold as he stood up.

“I am only guessing, but it should be that,” Jian Wushuang answered.

He believed in King of Venomous Worms’ judgement.

Plus, from his viewpoint, that was the only reason for Blood Emperor to come after him.

“Humph, the bastard from Holocaust Sect!”

Fiery King’s voice was cold, “Previously when I was wandering in Eternal Chaotic World, I once saw Holocaust Sect’s doings. Their vicious formation refined all living things in twenty-one Worlds in less than a thousand years. Back then, in the Holy Kingdom, it stirred up a great commotion and even got the owner of Sky Sword Mountain involved.”

“It is said that the owner of Sky Sword Prison personally investigated the case. However, the people from Holocaust Sect ran away too quickly and didn’t fall in the hands of the owner of Sky Sword Mountain.”

“I never thought that the Sky Sword Mountain that we are currently in had people from Holocaust Sect too, and that he would be one of the four Kings!”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
