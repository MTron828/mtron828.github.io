Chapter 3541: Master Dragonhawk

Hong!

Suddenly, an aura fluctuated, and the black spear that everyone was staring at finally rose up from the ground.

The moment the spear rose up, the surrounding Principles Masters instantly moved.

One by one, figures rushed down at the fastest speed. Everyone wanted to rush to the front of the spear and put it into their interspatial rings.

But right at this moment...weng!

A layer of space-time principles energy suddenly spread out. As soon as this layer of spacetime principles energy appeared, it instantly covered the entire void. In the blink of an eye, it formed a massive spacetime domain, the numerous Principles Masters who had rushed toward the spear at the first moment also immediately fell into this spacetime domain, their speed drastically decreasing.

“What’s going on?”

“A spacetime treasure?”

“What a powerful spacetime domain. My speed has been suppressed by so much?”

These Principles Masters were all secretly shocked.

After the spacetime domain appeared and suppressed the speed of all the Principles Masters present, a figure appeared in front of the black long spear. With a simple wave of his hand, he put the black spear into his interspatial ring.

After that, he slowly turned around.

“What a strange escape art. We didn’t notice that someone was beside us.”

“This person is Blood Sword Master!”

“It’s him. It’s rumored that he has a space-time domain and an extremely strange escape art that can hide from the soul detection of cultivators. It seems that it’s true.”

The surrounding Principles Masters had already recognized Jian Wushuang.

However, after knowing that the long spear had fallen into Jian Wushuang’s hands, the Principles Masters immediately gave up the idea of fighting for it.

In the past 50 years, Jian Wushuang had roamed the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley and constantly challenged experts from all over the place. This challenge had made him extremely famous, among the experts he had challenged, there were at least 10 experts at the peak of the fifth void realm. However, after the fierce battle with Jian Wushuang, these experts all admitted that Jian Wushuang had not displayed his strongest strength, during the time he had fought with them, he had not displayed his strongest strength.

Even so, Jian Wushuang could still slightly suppress them.

This led to the judgment that Jian Wushuang should be able to fight against experts of the six void realms.

Such an expert had a strong life-saving ability. If the long spear fell into his hands, who would be qualified to fight for it with the surrounding Principles Masters?

Moreover, the long spear was only an elementary universe supreme treasure. It would be unwise to snatch it from Blood Sword Master for such a Supreme Treasure.

“Everyone, I’m sorry to have made you wait in vain.” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked around at the Principles Masters.

“Blood Sword Master, you’re too kind. If we had known you were here, we would have left long ago. Everyone knows that you, Blood Sword Master, have a powerful space-time domain, and your speed and movement techniques are very strange. It’s simply asking for trouble to snatch the treasure from you,” a purple-haired man said with a smile.

“Yes, with you here, Blood Sword Master, how can we compete for the treasure?” Another man also smiled.

Jian Wushuang also smiled. He could see that the Principles Masters present were very good to him.

After all, in the 50 years he had been wandering in Devil Smoke Valley, although he had challenged countless experts, Jian Wushuang had never killed any of them, regardless of whether they were strong or weak, in the fierce battle, he had even made friends with many experts. Among them, there were experts from various star worlds and forces. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In addition, Jian Wushuang was very strong, which made people respect him. Naturally, the Principles Masters treated him better.

“Blood Sword Master, you’ve already got the long spear. You don’t want us to stay and fight you one by one, do you?” The stronger expert of the five void realms among the Principles Masters said.

“That’s not necessary. If you want to leave, you can leave now. But...Master Dragonhawk is an exception.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes locked on one of the Principles Masters in the crowd.

“Me?” Master Dragonhawk, who was wearing cyan armor and had eagle-like eyes, looked surprised, but then he smiled and said, “Blood Sword Master, are you going to spar with me?”

“Yes, it’s you.” Jian Wushuang nodded. His eyes looked calm, but there was a hidden killing intent in the depths of his eyes.

Master Dragonhawk did not notice this killing intent,

the surrounding Principles Masters also looked at each other with strange expressions.

There were no less than ten Principles Masters present. Master Dragonhawk’s cultivation was only at the peak of the fourth realm. Among these Principles Masters, he was definitely not the best and was stronger than him, obviously, there were two experts of the fifth realm of the void.

Generally, experts who liked to fight would definitely challenge the experts. Why would they challenge the weaker ones?

Therefore, they initially thought that Jian Wushuang would only challenge two experts of the fifth realm of the void. They did not expect that Jian Wushuang would challenge Master Dragonhawk.

Although it was strange, they did not pay much attention to Jian Wushuang as he had never killed anyone in the past 50 years.

Master Dragonhawk still greeted them with a smile. “It’s rare for Blood Sword Master to think highly of me. I, dragonhawk, will have to risk my life to accompany you.”

“Master Dragonhawk, show me your strongest strength.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold as the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

“Be careful.” Master Dragonhawk reminded him as a hook-type magic weapon appeared in his hand. His body swayed slightly and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. The hook also strangely bypassed the special curve, it went straight for Jian Wushuang’s throat.

The moment Master Dragonhawk made his move, Jian Wushuang’s expression turned completely cold as he activated the life divine power in his body.

During the past 50 years, when he sparred with others, even if he needed an ordinary expert of the void five realms, he would not easily activate the life divine power in the beginning, Master Dragonhawk was only at the peak of the void four realms, but Jian Wushuang had already used the life divine power in the beginning.

Not only that, his power had also reached its peak at this moment.

The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand, with an unprecedented violent aura, drew a beautiful blood-red mark in the void and suddenly slashed out furiously.

Peerless Sword Manual, Xi Xiang!

Boom!

The sword light swept out with earth-shaking power.

In addition to the heaven-splitting skill, Jian Wushuang had already used his strongest power and strength.
