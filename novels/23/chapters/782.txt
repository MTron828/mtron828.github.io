Chapter 783: The Return!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Hearing Xuan Yi’s words, Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su exchanged looks and then nodded.

“All right then,” Tian Yunzi said. “You’re Jian Wushuang’s master. It’s reasonable that you should be the first one to hear his stories in the Eternal Zone. But I hope in the end you can make the right choice. Otherwise…”

Xuan Yi smiled and flicked his sleeves. Jian Wushuang followed him to a piece of nearby empty Void and the two started to talk.

Meanwhile, the rest of the experts, including Tian Yunzi and the other two Dao Masters, waited patiently on the scene.

“Master.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Xuan Yi. He thought Xuan Yi would immediately ask him about his life in the Eternal Zone, so he had already started to think about what to say./

But Xuan Yi just beamed at him and said, “Kid, over the past hundred years you spent in the Eternal Zone, you really made some progress.”

“Er…” Jian Wushuang was taken aback by this, but he then nodded and said humbly, “Just a little progress.”

“You’ve already impressed me by turning into a Gold-armored Ancient God. If I’m not mistaken, your Sword Heart has also reached Level Two, right? And it has stayed at Level Two for a long time.” Xuan Yi smiled.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded again. But he did not notice that Xuan Yi had just said “Gold-armored Ancient God”, instead of “Gold-armored Demon God”.? ?

It should be noted that all the experts in the Firmament Territory called the Ancient God Clansmen “Demon Gods”. They did not know that the Demon God Clan’s true name was the Ancient God Clan.

But Xuan Yi had said “Gold-armored Ancient God”!

Apparently, Xuan Yi knew the real name of the Demon God Clan.

“Your swordsmanship has also improved quite a lot. Have you ever come across any problems with the Sword Principle over the past hundred years?” Xuan Yi asked again.

Jian Wushuang became even more bemused. He could not help but ask, “Master, don’t you want to know what happened to me during the past hundred years?”

“What happened to you is your own business. Why would I want to know?” Xuan Yi grinned. “I said this to Tian Yunzi and his lot because I want to play for some time.”

“Play for some time?” Jian Wushuang was nonplussed.

Xuan Yi clearly had no interest in hearing his stories in the Eternal Zone. This was just an excuse to play for some time.

“But… why do you want to play for time? What use will it serve?” Jian Wushuang blurted out.

“Be patient. You’ll know when the time comes.” Xuan Yi gave a mysterious smile and went on, “You and I finally had a reunion after a hundred years. If you have any problem relevant to the Sword Principle, quickly ask. Don’t miss this opportunity.”

“Oh, yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded hastily.

Although Jian Wushuang did not know what kind of plan Xuan Yi had, he did not ask more questions out of his trust for his master. Instead, he immediately told Xuan Yi those little problems that had confused him in the Sword Principle study, and Xuan Yi also unreservedly gave his answers and explanations.

Meanwhile, the experts of various sects, including the three renowned Dao Masters Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su, were all patiently waiting for Xuan Yi’s reply.

But none of them realized that Xuan Yi was not questioning Jian Wushuang about his life in the Eternal Zone at all. He was teaching him the Sword Principle.

Half of a day fleeted by.

Tian Yunzi finally ran out of patience.

“Xuan Yi, you’ve questioned him for so long. Did you get all the details? Have you come to an answer?” Tian Yunzi bellowed.

Xuan Yi, who was in the middle of teaching Jian Wushuang, looked back at Tian Yunzi and gave him a playful smile. “It’s about time. I think we’re done.”

Emperor Tu and Demon Master Su instantly turned to look at Xuan Yi.

“Xuan Yi, let your disciple tell us his stories,” Emperor Tu said candidly.

“My disciple? No, no!”

Xuan Yi shook his head. His voice grew colder. “Whatever my disciple went through in the Eternal Zone, that’s his business. I, his master, will never ask about it. Likewise, whatever opportunities or secrets he attained in the Eternal Zone, that’s his business, and any other man had better stay out of it!”

Xuan Yi stressed the last few words, making him sound more awe-inspiring.

“Xuan Yi, you fooled us, didn’t you?” Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su all looked gloomy.? ?

They had given Xuan Yi enough respect, but Xuan Yi clearly failed to appreciate their kindness.

“I did fool you, so what?”

“Do you guys really want to learn the hard way?”

“Well—”

Xuan Yi smiled weakly. His penetrating eyes shifted towards Tian Yunzi and the other two. His freezing voice rang throughout the area.

“Today I, Xuan Yi, proclaim for everyone to hear…”

“You three can use whatever means or skills you have to fight. But I can tell you the result beforehand. In the end, I, and my disciple will go through this battle safe and sound, while you three will pay a great price for getting out of this fight alive.”

“These words are spoken by me, Xuan Yi.”

The experts of assorted sects all looked bemused.

They did not know why Xuan Yi was so confident.

“Very well. I really want to see how you’re gonna make the three of us pay such a great price.” Tian Yunzi said, his eyes extremely cold.

“I want to see as well.” Emperor Tu said nonchalantly. A heavy sword had already appeared in his hands.

“Xuan Yi, you’re so thickheaded. Don’t blame us for going hard on you.” Demon Master Su’s eyes shone with excitement.

In the next second, a bang blasted out! Three streams of formidable aura burst out in an instant.

The three Dao Masters representing the top authority in the Firmament Territory launched attacks at the same time.

“Xuan Yi!”

Tian Yunzi charged furiously at the front. There was a glint of fierceness in his expression, his eyes staring at Xuan Yi unblinkingly. As he leaped forward, the Void behind him cracked open bit by bit.

The three Dao Masters struck out simultaneously, astonishing every expert of all the sects.

“Master!” Jian Wushuang was also shocked by what he saw.

Xuan Yi was the only one still wearing a vague smile. Even when he saw the three Dao Masters attacking together, he made no move at all to fend them off.

However, at this moment, something shocking happened.

“Hmph!”

A snort resounded like a clap of thunder, suddenly descending from a cloudless sky and spreading outwards.

“Dare to attack my master, how audacious you are!”

As the voice faded, a blast of astounding power broke out.

Not far in the Void, a scarlet Giant Axe at least 1,000 feet high suddenly appeared, covering half the sky. It split open all the barriers ahead of it with an overwhelming power. A second ago, it was still in the far end of the Void, but in the blink of an eye, it had already approached Tian Yunzi and was hacking at him.

“What?”

The drastic change startled Tian Yunzi. But, he was a Dao Master, after all. So he quickly came to his senses and reacted quickly. He gathered all his power in his right hand, on which he was wearing a boxing glove. A fit of bright red energy shot straight out.

“Boom!”

A huge hole was blasted into the Void. Tian Yunzi let out a muffled snort and zoomed backward like a detonated bomb. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Then, with a swoosh, a robust figure materialized in front of Xuan Yi.

He was more than two meters high, as sturdy as a brown bear. He was goggling at Tian Yunzi and the other two with two dreadful eyes as large as plates, grinding his teeth in fury.

When the brown-bear man appeared, a raw wind suddenly blew in from the nearby Void. Everyone narrowed their eyes and turned to look at the source of this vile wind.

From that direction, a colossal purple figure emerged. A monstrous creature covered in purple scales was scurrying towards them at an incredible speed.

When this huge creature came closer, everyone saw it clearly. It was… a giant dragon covered in purple scales.

Yes, it was a giant dragon, a real giant dragon.

This dragon’s body was about 10,000 feet in length. The pressure it exerted was overbearing.

On the head of this Amethyst Giant Dragon stood a purple-armored man holding an amethyst long spear like a War God. His pupils were also purple, and he shot bolts of purple lightning at Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su.

“Boom!”

The earth suddenly trembled as though it was going to crack. In the next second, a corner of the sky suddenly turned scarlet.

This scarlet corner expanded and finally turned into a boundless blood sea which engulfed the whole area. On the edge of the boundless blood sea, a wicked young man was strolling. He had long blood-red hair, wore a bloody robe and carried a blood-red saber.

He looked like an Asura who had just returned from hell. He did not make any strike or send forth any aura. But once he appeared, Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, Demon Master Su all felt their blood run cold.

Finally, this bloody demonic youth walked up to Xuan Yi.

Then, as everyone on the scene was still dumbstruck, the man as robust as a brown bear, the Amethyst War God riding an Amethyst Giant Dragon, and the demonic youth in full blood-red clothing, the last to come, suddenly got down to their knees before Xuan Yi and spoke in one voice with great respect.

“We disciples hereby pay our tribute to Master Xuan Yi!”

These thunderous words reverberated throughout the area. As they spoke, three whiffs of extremely terrifying aura instantly swept across.

Anyone of these three whiffs of aura was much more powerful than that of Tian Yunzi, Emperor Tu, and Demon Master Su.

The three men were obviously Dao Master-level supreme experts!

The three personal disciples, the three peerless geniuses, the three most powerful Dao Masters that Xuan Yi recruited before he took in Jian Wushuang… had returned!
