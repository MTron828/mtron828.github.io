Chapter 929: The Result

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Emperor Leng, I hope you make the right choice. Otherwise…”?Jian Wushuang stared at Emperor Leng as he stood on the drill ground.

“Mother.” Leng Rushuang was also looking at Emperor Leng. “I hope you can keep your promise!”

“Your Highness, our agreement is dependant on the marriage alliance between the Xia Clan and the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land. The agreement between us is invalid without it.” Xia Yu also stared at Emperor Leng as he secretly conveyed his message to her.

Silence fell over the drill ground.

Everyone waited for Emperor Leng to announce the final result.

Who would be the Princess’ husband?

Would it be Jian Wushuang or Xia Mang?

All eyes were on Emperor Leng, who was frowning as she sat on the throne at the center of the audience. Her expression was grave.

“To think that Jian Wushuang would be that skillful…”

“Xia Mang is such a good-for-nothing to be defeated by an Eternal Realm expert!”

“What a headache…”

She hesitated.

Yet, she promptly made her decision.

“Whoosh!”

Emperor Leng stood up and cast the audience a cold look.

“Only one person will be the Emperor’s son-in-law of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land. That is…” Emperor Leng pointed to a direction.

“Xia Mang of the Xia clan!” she said.

Her voice echoed all over the drill ground.

Everyone, including those on the drill ground and those seated in the audience, heard her.

Everyone was surprised at this result.

“How can it be Xia Mang?”

“What a joke! Does she think we’re all blind?”

“Jian Wushuang defeated Xia Mang in the two contests of the Selection Ceremony. Jian Wushuang is the winner and he should be the Princess’s husband. How could it be Xia Mang?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Humph, Emperor Leng is so shameless. If she has decided that Xia Mang would be the Princess’s husband, why bother holding this Selection Ceremony?”

“She’s deceiving herself.”

Voices that carried anger and indignation came from all directions.

There were tens of millions of audiences around the drill ground and everyone was a clear witness. They knew that Jian Wushuang was the rightful winner of this Selection Ceremony and could not believe that Xia Mang would be the Emperor’s son-in-law.

The audiences could not calm down as they felt such indignance for Jian Wushuang!

They could not be convinced.

Many experts on the stand sighed with emotion.

“To think that Emperor Leng would dare to do this!”

“She’d even sacrifice her reputation and that of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land for this marriage alliance. What’s the benefit of her doing this?”

“Is it so important to form the marriage alliance with the Xia Clan?”

The experts were all confused.

Some experts even frowned with dissatisfaction.

“So Emperor Leng has long decided that Xia Mang would be the Princess’s husband. Had I known this in advance, we wouldn’t have gotten involved,” Deep Sea Palace Master said angrily.

Elder Deadwood also snorted. “I heard that Emperor Leng would do anything to achieve her goal. I see that it’s true!”

Both of them came from places beyond the territory of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land and possessed extremely powerful strength. Therefore they dared to speak up without fearing Emperor Leng’s subsequent retaliation/

Some other experts were also dissatisfied with Emperor Leng’s decision but endured it after considering her title and strength.

Of course, there was another one who dared to speak out. That person was Xue Lingtian.

“Emperor Leng, do you know what you’re doing now?” Xue Lingtian asked with a sullen face. There was anger in his eyes.

“I surely know what I’m doing now. It’s not your concern. The result of the Selection Ceremony is up to me and I’m entitled to choose the right person to be my daughter’s husband. What does this have to do with you?” Emperor Leng’s voice was cold.

“Emperor Leng…” Xue Lingtian became even angrier but had to hold his temper. After all, he had to respect Emperor Leng’s strength and title.

“Mother, you… you’ve broken your promise,” Leng Rushuang said in a faint voice. She stood up from her seat and looked at Emperor Leng.

“Keep quiet. You’re not speaking here.”

Emperor Leng turned around after reprimanding her daughter and said nothing more. Leng Rushuang’s disappointment gradually turned into despair.

Leng Rushuang had previously harbored expectations about her mother.

However, everything had now shattered.

The way she looked at Emperor Leng changed. It became colder and more distant.

The drill ground turned tumultuous.

Shock and terror seized the crowd.

Xia Mang looked at Jian Wushuang in triumph and deliberately sent the latter a secret message while laughing. “Jian Wushuang, what’s the use of winning the contests?”

“So what if you have better wedding gifts and strength?”

“In the end, I’ll be the Emperor’s son-in-law and Leng Rushuang will finally be my woman.”

“As for you…”

“You’re just a countryman from a remote world with a little bit of luck. Yet you wish to compete with me?”

“How ridiculous!”

“Who are you to compete with me?”

“Do you see the outcome now?”

“Haha! Aren’t you angry and unsatisfied? But what can you do?”

“It’s useless. Emperor Leng has long decided that I’ll be her son-in-law. You’re just a contemptible scoundrel.”

“Just enjoy your moment at the Selection Ceremony. When it’s over, my clan will kill you immediately!”

“That’s your ultimate result!”

“Haha!”

Xia Mang’s voice continuously came into Jian Wushuang’s ears. There was a hint of arrogance, madness,and triumph in his voice.

These were the words from a winner to a loser.

They were like silver needles that pierced Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Jian Wushuang kept his head down.

“Why?”

“I’ve presented the best wedding gifts and talent. Why wouldn’t she choose me?”

Jian Wushuang roared in his heart. He clasped his hands so hard that his fingers dug into his flesh and caused it to bleed.

He gritted his teeth and trembled.

“I can’t accept this outcome!”

“I definitely can’t accept this outcome!”

“I won the Selection Ceremony but Emperor Leng chose Xia Mang.”

“Just because Xia Mang is from the Xia Clan!”

“Emperor Leng, you’re so cruel!”

Jian Wushuang roared, sending sound waves echoing in the air. He then raised his head as horrible killing intent erupted from his body.
