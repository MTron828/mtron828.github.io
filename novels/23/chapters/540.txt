Chapter 541: Fighting with Emperor Golden Snake

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This stroke!”

“How dazzling!”

The sergeants around the battlefield looked at the sword stroke in shock, but the sword shadow was so dazzling that they couldn’t help closing their eyes.

Emperor Golden Snake also narrowed his eyes.

The power of Jian Wushuang’s sword stroke was far beyond that of a Divine General. It was nearly comparable to that of a Divine Emperor.

The only thing missing was a Dao.

When the sword shadow glided past him, Emperor Golden Snake avoided it easily by simply shifting his body slightly.

The immense power of the sword shadow glided right in front of Emperor Golden Snake and shot directly toward the ground below.

Boom... Clang!

With a loud boom, the sword shadow sliced a huge sword scar in the ground so wide and deep that no one could see the bottom of it.

As the sword shadow chopped down, the numerous Demonic Beast corpses on the ground were all crushed into dust by the strong sword light.

Hundreds of Demonic Beast corpses completely disappeared.

“How frightening!”

“Was, was this really done by a Divine General?”

“He’s too strong!”

The sergeants who were watching the battle were all very excited and they looked at Jian Wushuang with worship in their eyes.

They had thought that Jian Wushuang would definitely be defeated by Emperor Golden Snake. Therefore, they fell into a daze when they saw what was happening.

Jian Wushuang had faced-off against Emperor Golden Snake in one-on-one combat.

But it actually ended in a draw.

“Emperor Golden Snake, is this your full strength?”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice echoed throughout the area, then a light flashed in the eyes of the Golden Sword Soul Phantom behind Jian Wushuang.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang took a step forward while simultaneously releasing a burst of Supreme Sword Essence, which materialized unexpectedly and shot through the air in the shape of tiny swords, rushing toward Emperor Golden Snake at an alarming speed.

“Funny,” Emperor Golden Snake glanced at Jian Wushuang and said in a low voice, “Can a bug like you understand a Divine Emperor’s means?”

A shining grey light glinted from the black scimitar in Emperor Golden Snake’s hand as a terrible power gathered around it.

All the sergeants held their breath as they watched.

They knew that Emperor Golden Snake was going to use a killing blow.

But, even before Emperor Golden Snake could begin...

“Stop!”

A sudden cry was heard from a nearby area, after which a thin black-clothed elder appeared out of nowhere, standing between Jian Wushuang and Emperor Golden Snake.

Boom... A majestic aura emanated from the black-clothed elder, indicating that he was also a Divine Emperor.

“It’s him?”?Jian Wushuang changed his expression when he recognized the black-clothed elder.

Previously, when Jian Wushuang fought with Fang Han in the camp, this black-clothed elder appeared to settle the conflict and seemed to be partial toward him.

“Golden Snake, what are you doing?” The black-clothed elder turned to Emperor Golden Snake and asked.

He had sensed the rising killing intent in Emperor Golden Snake even when he was on the front battlefield, so he followed Emperor Golden Snake in case something happened. He had witnessed Emperor Golden Snake’s fight with Jian Wushuang.

“Xiying, are you going to stop me?” Emperor Golden Snake stared at the black-clothed elder with scarlet eyes.

The black-clothed elder was Emperor Xiying, one of the 108 Divine Emperors in the Monster-exterminating League. Upon feeling the immense killing intent radiating from Emperor Golden Snake, his complexion darkened slightly.

“What’s wrong?” Emperor Xiying frowned and asked, “Golden Snake, you’re a Divine Emperor, how can you fight with a Divine General without a special reason? Have you forgotten your position?”

“Reason? Hehe, Ling’er died because of him. Is this reason sufficient?”

“Ling’er?” Emperor Xiying changed his expression slightly. He naturally knew that Ling’er was Jin Ling.

At the same time, he also knew how much Emperor Golden Snake doted on Jin Ling.

Emperor Golden Snake had lived for a long time, so all of his relatives were dead and his tribe was long gone. Jin Ling was his last remaining family member in the world, so it was not difficult to imagine the importance Jin Ling held in his heart.

It was rumored that Emperor Golden Snake liked to shield the mistakes for him men, but in fact, he only did this for his son.

Since Jin Ling was dead, it was natural for Golden Snake to go mad. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Golden Snake, wasn’t your son killed by the Demonic Beasts? What’s the matter with Jian Wushuang?” Emperor Xiying said in a low voice.

“I say it matters. Xiying, get out of my way,” Emperor Golden Snake’s eyes sparkled with an angry light.

He would have been more polite to Emperor Xiying ordinarily, but right now he only wanted to avenge Jin Ling and was being stopped by Emperor Xiying, so he raged against him.

“Golden Snake...” Emperor Xiying wanted to say something.

“Get out of the way!” Emperor Golden Snake growled, “If you don’t get out of the way, I swear that I’ll apply to the Temple Masters for a Life-death Duel with you after this!”

“A Life-death Duel?” Emperor Xiying was shocked and his expression darkened.

Right at this moment...

“What happened? Why did you two decide to have a Life-death Duel?” The crowd suddenly heard a gentle voice and then felt a dense warmth surround them.

The warmth immediately eased the tense situation as everyone felt a warm?sensation in their hearts, which quieted them down.

Under the watch of everyone, a tender figure slowly landed.

She had a beautiful face, a curvaceous figure, and an enchanting smile on her face, with a dense warmth emanating from her as if she bathed in the sun like a goddess.

Seeing her, Emperor Xiying immediately bowed and said, “I pay my respects to Your Excellency.”

Although Emperor Golden Snake was in a rage, he respectfully saluted, “Temple Master Pure Moon!”

“Temple Master?”

The sergeants as well as Jian Wushuang were shocked for an instant and immediately saluted towards her.

A Temple Master... was a supreme being in the Monster-exterminating League and a super expert above the Cloud Realm.

The 33 Temple Masters of the Monster-exterminating League made up the highest battle strength of the human population on the Monster Continent.

Temple Master Pure Moon was one of the 33 Temple Masters. She had been in the East Camp all year round, but today she even came to the battlefield and killed many Demonic Beasts.
