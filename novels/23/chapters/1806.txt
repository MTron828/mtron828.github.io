Chapter 1807: Wushuang City

“What do you mean by saying that Ancient Gods were just a small Bloodline of Ancient Clan?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“First I will explain the Ancient Clan. I mentioned that in the battle in the ancient times, there were many powerful clans uniting against Seven-star Ancient Gods and Ancient Clan was one of them. ”

“The inherent advantages of the Ancient Clan were much greater than those of the same level.”

“Because the inherent advantages were so great, the clan was the most powerful one among the four Great Clans at that time, despite its relatively low number of members.”

“And the Ancient Blood Lineage that you have also derives from the Ancient Clan.”

After a pause, Dao Yuanzi continued: “Besides, as Ancient Gods, the Ancient Clan also had the blood lineage of ancient demons and the ancient devils. Only the combination of these three different bloods can compose a complete Lineage of the Ancient Clan!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang asked, “That is to say, my blood line of the ancient gods is not comparable to the blood of the ancient clan?”

“Of course not. Even if you grow into the Ten-star Ancient God, your blood will still not be less powerful than that of strong talents of the Ancient Clan. ” Dao Yuanzi said.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Ten-star ancient god… Wasn’t that the legendary Ancient God Emperor? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Ancient God Emperor was supreme and incomparable among Ancient Gods. But… he was still far weaker than members of the Ancient Clan?”

“My Lord, I once told you that in the ancient battlefield, there is a corpse of a strongman from the Ancient Clan, with the lineage of the Ancient Clan. You can inherit that lineage, which is far better than yours, if you go there.” Dao Yuanzi said.

“Where is the corpse exactly?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Of course I know,” Dao Yuanzi nodded. “If you want to go, I can take you there at any time.”

“Fine. I will decide later.” Then Jian Wushuang put away the Blood Mountain Sword.

“My lord…”

The Dao Yuanzi was upset. He thought, “I have told Jian Wushuang so much but he still distrusts me. A waste of time for me!”

Of course, Dao Yuanzi only dared to say that in the bottom of his heart.

Jian Wushuang was sitting in the secret room.

“Hey, what do you think?” Jian Wushuang asked King of Venomous Worms.

“I have never heard of the Ancient Clan before, but from the Blood essence you got from Dao Yuanzi’s place, I can see that the power of the blood is truly more powerful than yours, so I think he is not lying.”

“As for the corpse he mentioned, he also told the truth because now you can decide his life but he never mentioned the danger of seeking the corpse. So it is clear that he is hiding some secrets.” King of Venomous Worms smiled coldly.

“Of course, I can see his mind. But don’t worry, when I finish the matter in the Green Fire World, I will go to the place he mentioned. If it’s dangerous, I will leave directly.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

King of Venomous Worms nodded.

Then Jian Wushuang looked at the blood essence in his hands.

“I will see how strong this blood is.” Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and began to slowly absorb this drop of blood.

Dao Yuanzi could not absorb the power of this drop of blood because he had no connection with the clan, but Jian Wushuang could.

After all, Ancient Gods derived from the Ancient Clan.

One month soon passed.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, and a fierce blast exploded.

“Dao Yuanzi was right. The blood lineage of the Ancient Clan is truly more powerful than Ancient Gods. After absorbing the blood, I feel my Ancient God Power has become greater!”

In addition, the two Ancient God Stars between his eyebrows that had been broken in the battle with Dao Yuan zi, were repaired.

“But it is just a drop of blood essence. It is not of great use for me. What is really useful is the blood inheritance from the Ancient Clan.” Jian Wushuang felt a desire to get it.

But he didn’t hurry.

After that, Jian Wushuang mobilized many resources and combined them with his own power to establish a cultivation sacred place in Green Fire World.

He located the place in a floating city.

Jian Wushuang had put a lot of cultivation resources, including some peculiar treasures, all in the great city and built it with a lot of time and energy.

This process took five hundred years.

“Finally finished.”

Jian Wushuang was satisfied when he saw the splendid building.

“From now on, this city will be a holy place that many geniuses in the green fire world will yearn for. It has countless cultivation resources. Though they are far from being comparable to the Thunder Island of the Holy League or the Star Lineage, they can still be compared with those top places in the Eternal Chaotic World. In the future I can continue to perfect this city and attract geniuses in the green world and give them the best training.”

“As for the name of this city… let’s call it Wushuang City.”

Also on this day, the Green Fire World completed the reformation. A large number of talents who belonged to the Green Fire Palace started their own establishments, but at the same time they still belonged to the Green Fire Palace. The leadership structure also changed. There were five new palace masters and on top of them, a top master.

Of course, it was Jian Wushuang.

After the reform, the Green Fire World gradually grew into a power that could challenge the ten Great Cultivation Sacred Places or the Holy League.
