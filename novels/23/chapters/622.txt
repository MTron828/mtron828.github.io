Chapter 623: I’m Feng

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Since I can’t expose my flawless foundation to them, I’ll have to use something else.”?Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

However, before he could make that move, a deep voice interrupted his plan.

“The both of you, not bad!”

A man’s voice echoed throughout the area with a suppressing force, which drew the attention of the two people who were fighting as well as the Skyscraping Realm experts hidden in the surroundings.

Looking towards the voice, they saw a man clothed in a heavy armor walking towards them with a saber in his hand. The man was strong-built and in his middle years.

As he drew near, the experts could feel the suppressing force that surrounded them become stronger.

When the man finally stopped walking, he looked toward Jian Wushuang and Xue Feng with battle intent in his eyes while loudly saying, “I’m Feng.”

“Feng?”

The name caused the hidden experts to change their looks.

Xue Feng also showed a grave expression upon hearing this name.

As for Jian Wushuang, he only looked slightly serious at that moment.

During the last three days on the battlefield, they had heard many famous names, most of which were of the top 30 experts, but none had frightened them so much as Feng had.

It was all because many Skyscraping Realm experts had died in this person’s hand, including some people as powerful as Xue Feng. Even more terrifying, those poor guys had been killed in a single strike before they could even struggle.

In light of this, Feng was considered as one of the top three experts among everyone who was still on the battlefield.

“Two days ago, when I first heard this name, I thought I would meet him in the second round, but it looks like he came sooner than I expected.”?

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly at Feng, not frightened at all.

He was not as famous as Feng, but that did not mean that he was weaker.

After all, he had not used his full power yet.

“Sword Emperor, Xue Feng.”

Feng called their names while looking at them. “You two are powerful, so you qualify to be my opponents.

“Now, accept my blow.”

After saying this, Feng swung his saber at Jian Wushuang and Xue Feng.

Looking at this move, Jian Wushuang could tell the man had reached an extremely high level in the Destruction Dao and had comprehended all the key points at his current level.

Besides the move, Feng also displayed a powerful secret skill. His saber surged toward its target like a rolling river.

However, the target was only Xue Feng.

Xue Feng had a grave expression while facing this blow. Without hesitation, she met the saber with her scarlet scythe and all her Dao power.

When the two weapons collided together, the saber overpowered the scythe and cut through Xue Feng’s body in an instant, while she stared ahead in amazement.

Weng! A dazzling light flashed out of the Drill Ground.

It was Xue Feng being sent out of the battlefield.

“How is this possible?

“He defeated me with a single strike!

Am I really so powerless when compared with him?”?She stood there quietly, her eyes filled with disbelief.

She had been confident in her power before this, so it never occurred to her that she would lose to someone at the same level as her in one strike.

The only reason had to be that Feng was just too strong.

“His power lives up to his fame. He should be ranked number one among us.” She sighed, staring at the wormhole in front of her.

“Since he’s not any stronger than me, Sword Emperor will be defeated by Feng with one strike as well.”

With this thought, She waited for Jian Wushuang to exit the battlefield and appear here as well.

The hidden Skyscraping Realm experts were still in shock after seeing Xue Feng’s failure.

Even Jian Wushuang couldn’t help narrowing his eyes.

“It’s your turn.” Feng turned towards Jian Wushuang and launched a ruthless attack.

It was a blow as powerful as the previous one.

The hidden experts started to take pity on Jian Wushuang because they thought that he could not survive it. They believed that Jian Wushuang was at the same level as Xue Feng. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When he saw the move coming towards him, Jian Wushuang took action as well.

He decided to continue relying solely on his Slaughter Body. The Heart-killing Sword quivered along with his surging killing intent.

“Cataclysm Skill!”

As Jian Wushuang growled, killing intent began to radiate from him.

“Buzz!”

The moment he displayed this skill, the whole area became dark.

Only his sword shone brightly in the darkness.

“Boom!”

With a fierce sound of metal on metal, a Blast Wave surged out towards the surroundings.

Jian Wushuang was thrown back hundreds of meters like a cannon ball.

Meanwhile, Feng was only forced to take one step backwards.

However, it still surprised him.

The scene rocked all the hidden experts, so they started talking about it. “Jian Wushuang is alive?”

“He didn’t get killed and he even forced Feng to retreat a step.”

“It was a brilliant move!”

The experts who were responsible for recording the battle results witnessed the fight through the Mirror Image.

“Superior Secret Skill of the first level!”

“The skill Jian Wushuang displayed is of the first level!”

“Write it down now. Jian Wushuang has survived Feng’s attack with his Superior Secret Skill. He even forced Feng to take a step backwards. Therefore, he is qualified for the second round and even the third round of the following battle.”
