Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Disciple.”

The grey-robed middle-aged man shouted toward the outside.

A figure who had been cultivating at the other end of the castle dashed out like a Flowing Light and immediately appeared in front of the grey-robed man.

This young man had an arrogant look on his face and a blood-red saber on his back.

“Master.” the young man responded respectfully.

“Go pick up this little guy,” the grey-robed man ordered.

“Okay,” the young man replied with a flicker of delight in his eyes.

He quickly set out, accompanied by dozens of colossal figures.

Those colossal figures were giant Bone Dragons!

On the fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace, Jian Wushuang was feeling really good.

His body, from his skin, muscles, blood, bones, and organs, to each and every cell, began to metamorphosis.

This metamorphosis was like a worm changing into a butterfly.

The giant Golden Sword Soul Phantom behind him soared crazily, going from 240 feet to 330 feet.

However, it seemed that the Golden Sword Soul Phantom had finally reached its limit.

“This feeling is really amazing!”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes with a smile while he sensed the changes that had taken place.

It took him a long period of time to finish the metamorphosis.

His terrifying aura finally dissipated as the Golden Sword Soul Phantom slowly disappeared.

Calm was restored to the area.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes as a streak of light flashed in them.

“Flying to the Ninth Heaven, I made it!”

“Finally, I made a breakthrough.”

Jian Wushuang tingled with unprecedented excitement. He was over the moon.

He had been stuck in the Saint Realm for such a long period of time.

When traveling through the Divine Land and the Monster Continent, his strength had been continually improving, to the point where he could even match up to a superior emperor, but he was still in the Saint Realm.

There was a huge gap between his realm and his real strength. Even Jian Wushuang himself felt it was strange.

Now, he had finally bypassed the bottleneck.

He had made it to the Cloud Realm and his nine Origin Marks had changed into nine Clouds. He was a Nine-cloud Realm expert now.

His Heavenly Creation Skill truly was heaven-defying at each level.

Flying to the Ninth Heaven was on the same level as the Cloud Realm, but it should be far more extraordinary.

Jian Wushuang quickly understood what was so extraordinary about it.

“Superb, absolutely superb!” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes.

He could sense that Flying to the Ninth Heaven was different from the preceding realms.

If someone reached Flying to the Ninth Heaven, he would be able to display the special parts of the previous levels to their greatest extent.

Ordinary warriors followed this cultivating path: Seven Steps of the Spirit Path, Spiritual Sea Realm, Primordial Gold Core Realm, Yin-Yang Void Realm, and Divine Transcendence!

However, Jian Wushuang had cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, so he followed a different path: Nine Heavens of the Divine Path, Ultimate Spiritual Sea, Supreme Gold Core Realm, Yin and Yang Breaking, and Venerable Master.

Nine Heavens of the Divine Path provided him with a more powerful Martial Arts foundation than ordinary Warriors.

As for the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, it gave him more Spiritual Power.

With Supreme Gold Core, his outburst of Spiritual Power was far superior to ordinary Warriors at the same level.

Yin-Yang Breaking provided him with a Slaughter Doppelganger.

As a Venerable Master, he had a supreme body.

At every stage, Jian Wushuang was more powerful than ordinary warriors at the same level.

And now, Flying to the Ninth Heaven was a perfect combination of the special powers at each of the previous stages.

His Martial Arts foundation, the amount of Spiritual Power, the outburst of Spiritual Power, and his body, all became perfect.

As for that doppelganger...

He used his mind, causing his Slaughter Doppelganger to instantly appeared by his side. At this point, he realized that his Doppelganger had also changed and become a duplicate of his Original Body.

Two Original Bodies were able to work separately and combine into one. Most importantly, they were connected to each other. No matter which one died, one Original Body was able to remake the other.

Even his Sword Soul reached a superb level.

“Incredible!”

“It’s really incredible!”

“Flying to the Ninth Heaven didn’t give me any other special abilities, but this perfect combination will be more helpful to me.”

He clenched his hands, but he could not hold back his surprise and delight.

At that moment, the broken finger’s arrogant voice rang out again. “Little boy, I’m God Hong. Remember my name and visit me when you come to my world.”

The voice became faint and eventually disappeared.

“God Hong?” Jian Wushuang remembered this name and replied with gratitude, “Thanks for your help. If I have an opportunity to meet you, I’ll repay you for this favor.”

The broken finger gave no response.

Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief, calmed himself down, and then slowly stood up.

“This trip to the fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace was a very fortunate occurrence. I?really gained a lot,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

He had inherited the Immortality Secret Skill, improved his body to its limit with Enhanced Magic Thunderbolt, and made a breakthrough to the realm of Flying to the Ninth Heaven!

It was very fortunate indeed.

Without this opportunity, he did not know when he would have made a breakthrough. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I’m satisfied, so I should leave now.” Jian Wushuang left.

After he walked out of Earth Core Palace, Jian Wushuang took out several tokens.

“What’s wrong? Why did so many people send me messages?” Jian Wushuang wondered. “I’ve only been here for two days. Is it really so long that they would need to look for me?”

Jian Wushuang frowned and began to check those tokens.
