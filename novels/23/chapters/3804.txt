Chapter 3806: Dark Magic Region

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in the open space next to the Heaven Suppression Tablet. He did not emit any aura, and there was not even a trace of divine power circulating on his body, it looked as if his divine power had been exhausted, but in fact, it was just Jian Wushuang’s perfect control of divine power.

In the past 12 years, after practicing the dragon-exterminating secret skill, he was indeed much stronger than before.

“I wonder how much my strength will increase if I use the first volume of the dragon-exterminating secret skill with all my strength.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

“Let’s try it!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang immediately activated the dragon-exterminating secret skill.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang felt a burst of heat in his body, and then his divine power began to burn crazily, like dry wood encountering a raging fire.

The burning of divine power made Jian Wushuang’s expression a little painful.

“This burning of divine power is really painful. Fortunately, my consciousness is strong enough, so I won’t be affected too much. However, the speed at which my divine power is being consumed is indeed a little frightening.” Jian Wushuang could feel the rapid consumption of divine power in his body.

It was very normal. The secret skill of divine power burning was something that would make many fourth-and fifth-level Rulers change their expressions.

Such a secret skill was an absolute trump card for many experts in the universe. They would never use it unless they were in a life-and-death situation.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power was as vast as the sea because of his perfect life. It was thousands of times more than that of an ordinary Principles Master, so he could barely withstand the speed at which his divine power was being consumed.

“However, after burning my divine power, my power has increased a lot.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and felt the terrifying power contained in them.

The crazy burning of his divine power had greatly compressed his divine power and made it a hundred times stronger than before.

After all, Jian Wushuang’s own divine power was comparable to that of a Primary Ruler. The sudden increase of his divine power by a hundred times made his basic divine power comparable to or even better than that of an ordinary Superior Ruler.

Jian Wushuang had several secret skills, which would greatly increase his strength.

For example, the life divine power and Heaven-cleaving skill would greatly increase his divine power.

Most importantly, Jian Wushuang also had the power of the will given by the universal laws, which could double the original power of Jian Wushuang!

All in all, Jian Wushuang’s sudden burst of power had completely surpassed the level of the first-level Ruler.

“The power of my basic divine power is much stronger than that of an ordinary Superior Ruler. If my secret skills are used at the same time and the power given by the universal law is superimposed on each other, my strongest burst of power should be comparable to that of an Advanced Ruler of the second-level,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He had never met or exchanged blows with a second-tier, high-level Ruler before.

However, he had judged the difference between the first-tier Rulers. If he used the dragon destruction secret technique at full strength, he could barely reach that level of power.

“The power of a second-tier, high-level Ruler, and my understanding of Sword Dao has long surpassed that of a second-tier Ruler. I can even match a third-tier Ruler. In addition, I have many True Treasures, including the mystic light sky-escaping wings, the Triple Magic Light Mirror, the Mountain River Map, the Netherworld Divine Sword, and the Dark Gold Magic Dragon Armor...my current combat power has reached the peak of this Star Field!”

“I’m afraid that very few of the top experts in the history of this Star Field are as good as me.”

Jian Wushuang was not boasting, but he was right.

After all, this Star Field was a remote place in the universe. There were not many Rulers here. The Rulers at the top of the first level were almost the strongest, and it was rare to see a Ruler at the second level, Ruler Kun Yu, who had passed the test at the foot of the Heaven-Treading Mountain, was relatively rare.

Moreover, in this Star Field, once those Rulers reached the second level, they would not stay here for too long. They would soon choose to leave for other Star Fields in the universe. After all, second level Rulers…they were absolutely invincible in this Star Field. As the saying went, experts were lonely. If they stayed in this Star Field long enough, they would choose to leave.

It would not take long for Master Kun Yu to leave this Star Field.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang’s current battle strength was among the top experts in the history of this Star Field. It was not empty words.

In fact, with his current battle strength, he could also prepare to explore other Star Fields in the universe. However, he had too many responsibilities and the crisis of the Divine Beginning Realm, so he could not leave.

“With my current strength, it’s difficult for me to improve in a short time. It’s time for me to explore the Dark Magic Region.”

“Of course, before I leave, I’ll stay with my parents for a while.”

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief and then set off.

The Dark Magic Region was too dangerous. Although Jian Wushuang was very confident in his current strength and life-saving methods, he was not absolutely sure that he could walk out of it alive. Therefore, before he set off…he naturally had to spend time with his parents, relatives, and friends. However, he did not stay too long because of the time constraint.

He set off after only three years.

When he left, he did not mention the danger to his parents. He did not want his parents and his many relatives and friends to worry about him.

Star Palace.

“My young friend, over the past ten years, my Star Palace has tried to collect some information about the Dark Magic Region for you. The information here is either true or false. We can’t explain it clearly. You should go and find out for yourself. In short, the Dark Magic Region is not like other places. It is full of dangers. You must be careful when you travel alone,” Daoist Xuan God exhorted.

“I understand.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and took the report from Daoist Xuan God. He took a quick glance at it and nodded slightly.

There were some valuable things in the report, but there were still many things that could not be confirmed. He could only go on his own to explore and distinguish between them.

“Everyone, I’ll be going now. Please take care of my relatives in the Divine Beginning Realm for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, come back soon.”

Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and Heaven Ancestor watched Jian Wushuang leave.

They knew that Jian Wushuang was going to fight for more life in the Divine Beginning Realm.
