Chapter 1775: Recall

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“This Jian Wushuang, not only is he extremely talented, he killed with great resolve and he is no different from old bastards like us who have lived for many years.”

“The path of the strong has always been full of ups and downs and every one of them was born from endless massacres. Now, the Soaring Heaven King Palace has become Jian Wushuang’s stepping stone. I reckon that Jian Wushuang wants to use the Soaring Heaven King Palace to warn everyone of the consequences of provoking him!”

“This time around, the Soaring Heaven King Palace has provoked a malignant star and it will be really miserable for them!”

“Hmph, the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s way of doing things has always been unreasonable. If not for them having such great backgrounds, they would have been destroyed a long time ago. This time around, they have finally suffered losses from someone who they thought was weak.”

“Jian Wushuang has already been massacring to his heart’s content for ten years. The Soaring Heaven King Palace’s Emperor God Tian Xiao has taken action many times. However, he was unable to do anything against him. If Jian Wushuang were to continue his massacre, no matter how many experts the Soaring Heaven King Palace had, the Soaring Heaven King Palace would run out of them eventually.”

“I wonder what the Soaring Heaven King Palace will do next? Could it be that they would get Emperor God Tian Ling, who has always been travelling in the Second Lair, to return personally?”

“Apart from that, there seems to be no other way.”

In the whole Sanctuary Alliance, countless experts were having a discussion enthusiastically.

They were all discussing Jian Wushuang as well as the clash between Jian Wushuang and the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

The past ten years of massacre had allowed everyone to really know what kind of person Jian Wushuang was. As such, innumerable experts started to respect him.

At the same time that they were shocked and exclaiming with admiration, all of them were guessing the next move of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

…

In a lofty palace in the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Emperor God Tian Xiao was sitting down on a throne which was three meters tall. Below him was a large number of high-level experts which included the few Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“Has the large number of Real Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace been recalled?” Emperor God Tian God was looking down at one of the people below him.

This person was Sir God Qing Fu.

“Palace Master, ninety-nine percent of the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s Real Gods who were in the Soaring Heaven Land and Sea Continent have already returned. Only a few Real Gods are still on their way back,” Sir God Qing Fu said respectfully. However, he was still filled with dissatisfaction, “Palace Master, do we really have to recall all the Real Gods back to our base just because of this Jian Wushuang?”

“Hmph, even though things have already reached this stage, you are still underestimating him?” Emperor God Tian Xiao gave a cold snort, “Don’t forget. Jian Wushuang has now gotten into the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list and he is already one of the Heaven and Earth Supremes of the Eternal Chaotic World. Even if I were to take action, I would be unable to do anything against him. Currently, he has gone on a crazy killing spree in the Soaring Heaven Land and Sea Continent. If I were to not call back all those Real Gods, wouldn’t that mean I am waiting for all of them to be killed by Jian Wushuang?”

As soon as Emperor God Tian Xiao’s words left his mouth, the whole hall went silent immediately.

At the start, the Soaring Heaven King Palace did not care about Jian Wushuang at all and they had thought that with their abilities, killing Jian Wushuang would be the same as stepping on an ant and killing it.

As for Jian Wushuang provoking the Soaring Heaven King Palace, it was just the weak attacking the strong.

However, no one had expected Jian Wushuang’s abilities to rise to such an extent in such a short period of time. Even with Emperor God Tian Xiao taking action personally, he was still unable to do anything against him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

To date, Jian Wushuang had gotten into the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list and he was already standing at the very top of the pyramid in the Eternal Chaotic World.

No one dared to disregard such an expert.

“Even though that’s the case, we are merely tackling the problem on the surface by recalling all the Real Gods. After all, the large number of experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace cannot possibly hide in the base all the time and not go out, right?” Sir God Qing Fu said with a deep voice, “We have to think of a way to kill Jian Wushuang. With this, we will be able to avoid any trouble in the future!”

Everyone around him nodded their heads in succession.

However, they knew that it would not be easy to kill Jian Wushuang.

“Palace Master, why not get Lord Tian Ling to take action…” Sir God Qing Fu only managed to say a few words.

“Big brother cannot take action temporarily.” Emperor God Tian Xiao waved his hands, “Not long ago, big brother sent me a message and told me that he had found an opportunity in the Second Lair. This opportunity was exceptional and if he were to be able to obtain it, his abilities would skyrocket. Although he would not be able to become a Great Emperor, he would be able to reach a level similar to that of the Underworld God!”

“The Underworld God?” the few Sir Gods below were all shocked.

The Underworld God… the person recognized as the number one among the Emperor Gods by the Eternal Chaotic World.

He was a super existence who could kill top Emperor Gods easily. Moreover, his position among the Emperor Gods was just like the position of Emperor Bai among the Great Emperors.

If Emperor God Tian Ling were to be able to reach a level similar to that of the Underworld God, it would be a very delightful thing to the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“Big brother has been thinking of ways to obtain that opportunity. Now, he is at the critical moment, so how can he be interrupted by Jian Wushuang like this?” Emperor God Tian Xiao said.

“Since Lord Tian Ling is unable to take action, what about the high-level experts in the Sanctuary Alliance? After all, our Soaring Heaven King Palace is a member of the Sanctuary Alliance. If we were to get them to come…” Sir God Qing Fu said.

“Forget about the Sanctuary Alliance.” Emperor God Tian Ling shook his head again, “This Jian Wushuang is different from the others.”

“He is an Inverse Cultivator who is extremely talented with unlimited potential. If he were to continue growing, there is even the hope of him achieving a level similar to that of Emperor Bai in the future. At the least, he will become a new Great Emperor. An expert like him with such potential is valued highly by the Sanctuary Alliance. If there is no need to, the old bastards in the Sanctuary Alliance will definitely not take action against Jian Wushuang.”

“For example, although he is currently massacring Real Gods wantonly, he himself is still a Real God. A Real God massacring Real Gods. Moreover, he is only massacring the Real Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Furthermore, the grudge acts as an appropriate reason for him to do so. As such, no matter how many Real God he kills, the high-level experts in the Sanctuary Alliance will naturally not care about it.”

“Moreover, there is another point. This Jian Wushuang has always been acting alone. From start to finish, the Lineage of Star behind him has never shown themselves.”

Emperor God Tian Xiao’s expression turned gloomy.

Jian Wushuang alone was already very difficult to deal with. According to logic, if there were the Lineage of Star on top of that, there would be even more pressure on the Soaring Heaven King Palace. However, in actual fact, that was not the case.

After all, the Lineage of Star was a big powerhouse and there were many Real God and Universe God disciples under them.

If the Lineage of Star were to be involved, they could absolutely give them a taste of their own medicine. For example, if Emperor God Tian Xiao were to charge into the Star Land and massacre the Real Gods of the Lineage of Star wantonly, the Lineage of Star might not be able to stop him. With that, there would be a balance and the actions of both of them would be restricted. As such, Jian Wushuang would definitely not dare to continue his massacre.

However, at that time… Jian Wushuang had always been acting alone and the Lineage of Star had never shown themselves before. Hence, the clash this time around was Jian Wushuang’s own personal matter and it was unrelated to the Lineage of Star.

Under such circumstances, if the Soaring Heaven King Palace were to fight all the way to the Lineage of Star, they would start a great battle right away. Moreover, for this great battle, the Soaring Heaven King Palace would be in the wrong and probably none of the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance would stand on their side.
