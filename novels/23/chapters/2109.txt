Chapter 2110 Conditions

“Since we know that this soul attack secret skill is useful?to Jian Wushuang, lets ask the emperor god to give us this secret skill.”“There might be some problems with this,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“How so?” Emperor Bai looked over and asked.

“From what I know, Emperor God Jue Xian is a very selfish person. It took a lot of effort to get that soul attack secret skill and it is one of his strongest moves. He won’t be willing to give it away for free.” Ancestor Tian Chen smiled.

“Dumbass. The Eternal Chaotic World might cease to exist. He still cares about his secret skills?” Emperor Bai face turned dark.

Now that the Eternal Chaotic World was under threat, experts were sharing their most powerful secret skills and techniques selflessly.

Just like the Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang shared the Secret Skills of Star Palace, which was crazily sought after by everyone participating in the battle.

This was not suggested by Emperor Bai. It was initiated by Jian Wushuang and the experts from the Lineage of Star.

They knew that the Secret Skills of Star Palace could raise the fighting power of the experts within Eternal Chaotic World. This gave them a high chance of winning the war.

This was a selfless act of commitment by the Lineage of Star for the upcoming war.

After all, it was no longer a peaceful era like before.

Before the Eternal Chaotic World faced danger, the Secret Skills of Star Palace was unique to the Lineage Of Star.

Now, they would do anything and everything to increase their chances of winning.

If the Eternal Chaotic World lost the war, every sect and clan would be destroyed, many experts would die. What was the point of selfishly hiding one’s secret skill if that happened?

Everyone understood this.

But this Emperor God Jue Xian…

“We have yet to ask him whether he will share the secret skill. Let us not judge the situation. I shall go to him personally and ask for it. Where is he now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“He is within the Red Dragon Sanctuary. You need not go down personally, just ask Red Dragon King to pass on the message,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

…

Within one of the ten sanctuaries, the Red Dragon Sanctuary.

Within this sanctuary, Red Dragon King was the leader.

In this territory, there was a large island where Emperor God Jue Xian stayed.

On the island, there were many servants. There were even two sir gods there who took orders from Emperor God Jue Xian.

Whoosh!

A figure appeared on the island. It was the Red Dragon King.

“Humph. This Emperor God Jue Xian is really relaxed.” The Red Dragon King looked down and felt the presence of the Emperor God Jue Xian.

Emperor God Jue Xian sat in the middle of a palace. He was admiring the dance of several beautiful ladies. There were many servants serving him.

Hum!!

A powerful aura was felt as it isolated the spacetime within the island.

The Red Dragon King teleported in front of Emperor God Jue Xian in the middle of the palace.

When he appeared, everyone apart from Emperor God Jue Xian fainted.

“Red Dragon King?”

Emperor God Jue Xian was shocked. He stood up and greeted, “Greetings, Red Dragon Emperor. I am Jue Xian.”

The Red Dragon King looked at Emperor God Jue Xian. Without a word, he took out a token and broke it. When the token broke, a hazy figure appeared in the middle of the palace.

This figure was a consciousness incarnation of Jian Wushuang.

“Emperor God Jue Xian.” Jian Wushuang looked down on Emperor God Jue Xian indifferently.

“This is… Greeting, Sword Emperor! I am Jue Xian.” Emperor God Jue Xian said when looked up and recognized the figure.

Emperor God Jue Xian became even more respectful. He was perturbed.

The two men who appeared in front of him were one of the strongest men in the Eternal Chaotic World.

One of them was ranked second on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, while the other was ranked third.

Two of these superpowers had appeared in front of him at the same time? It was obvious they were looking for him.

How could he not be perturbed?

“Relax. I am here to ask for your help. I got news that you’ve got a very powerful soul attack secret skill from the ancient battlefield. This secret skill is very crucial for the Sanctuary Alliance in the battle against the Three Emperor World. I hope you can give us a copy of the secret skill.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Soul attack secret skill?” Emperor God Jue Xian turned pale. It was obvious that he was unwilling.

This was normal. He had been through all that trouble to get the soul attack secret skill and it became one of his most powerful techniques. How would he be willing to submit the secret skill?

Jian Wushuang took note of his expressions and was not surprised. He continued, “The Sanctuary Alliance must have this secret skill. I know that it’s not easy to get this secret skill. You can give your conditions.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Jue Xian, Sword Emperor made himself clear. I’m sure you know what he means.” The Red Dragon King said as he looked at Emperor God Jue Xian.

If it were the Red Dragon King, he would not waste time speaking to Emperor God Jue Xian. Since the Sanctuary Alliance needed this, he would just force him to submit a copy of the secret skill. Unless Emperor God Jue Xian would rather die, he would have no choice but to submit a copy.

Emperor God Jue Xian took a deep breath. He could deduce that the Sanctuary Alliance would not give up until they had the secret skill. He had no chance against such a powerful organization.

Jian Wushuang had already allowed Emperor God Jue Xian to give his conditions. This was the biggest act of kindness the alliance could give. If he still refused to comply, he knew that he would die.

“Sword Emperor, I am willing to comply. I do have one condition that I hope that you can approve.” Emperor God Jue Xian said.

“Name it.’ Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I want to have the right to enter Heaven Repairing Palace.” Emperor God Jue Xian said seriously.

“Heaven Repairing Palace?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. He was confused.

The Red Dragon King stared at Emperor God Jue Xian and yelled, “How dare you make such a demand! You dare bargain for the right to enter the Heaven Repairing Palace?”

At the same time, an overbearing aura exploded from the Red Dragon King.

Emperor God Jue Xian felt the aura and trembled. He was sweating profusely. He gritted his teeth and tried his best to resist the aura.
