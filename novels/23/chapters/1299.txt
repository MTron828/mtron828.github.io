Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the wait of one year’s time, half had passed by in the blink of an eye.

In the spacious secret room, Jian Wushuang, who was originally seated, stood up. However, he never opened his eyes.

Blood Mountain Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand and he started wielding the sword in the secret room.

The flashes of sword light swung out from his hand. The flashes of sword light became faster and faster while the power became stronger and stronger.

Swoosh!

There were sharp whistles as the tip of the blade cut through the air. The continuous noise got sharper too.

He had been swinging the sword for three days straight.

Three days later, Jian Wushuang stopped his action and the entire secret room became silent.

It was so quiet that even space and time froze.

Right at that moment, Jian Wushuang, who had kept his eyes shut the whole time, suddenly opened his eyes. The glow in his eyes beamed as though they were spurting out from his sockets.

Jian Wushuang was holding the Blood Mountain Sword and he started swinging his sword again.

Vroom.

A clear and melodious sword whistle was heard and there was a swift and violent stab.

In that instance, there was a lustrous brilliance that looked extremely beautiful.

The moment it appeared, the universe lost its color in comparison..

Too beautiful!

That brilliance was too beautiful.

It was just like a beautiful rainbow, a trace that drew across the void and didn’t go away for a long time.

So enchanting!

Everything in the universe was enchanted!

In the void before the brilliance, everything was twisted.

After the swordsmanship was put fully into play, Jian Wushuang slowly retrieved his Blood Mountain Sword. However, the beautiful brilliance was still there and became part of eternity.

Looking at the beautiful brilliance, Jian Wushuang revealed a surprised smile.

“Ten years of accumulation from the Little Scattered Stars Game, half a year of digestion, I finally created a brand new unique skill in swordsmanship!”

“This move, the brilliance won’t go away for so long, almost as though it is eternal. Its name will be… Eternal Light!”

Jian Wushuang was inspired to create a brand new unique skill, Eternal Light. It was derived from the accumulation of resolving Little Scattered Stars Game for ten years!

Jian Wushuang wasn’t sure which level was the unique skill at but he knew that the power was much stronger than Nirvana and the Chant of Disturbance that he had created back then, even though the two unique skills were already peak, rank one unique skills.

“Jian Wushuang, try to integrate your swordsmanship into your Blood Mountain Sword,” King of Venomous Worms’s voice was suddenly heard.

“Integrate it into Blood Mountain Sword?” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy.

His Blood Mountain Sword was a precious embryo sword, the highest grade of embryo sword.

Embryo sword could integrate with a unique skill to enhance its power, and the highest grade of embryo sword had an extremely high threshold.

Jian Wushuang spread quite a few unique skills before. He had even created peak rank one unique skills like Nirvana and Chant of Disturbance. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, the two unique skills couldn’t be integrated into Blood Mountain Sword.

Until Jian Wushuang created Eternal Light.

“Let’s give it a try, I hope it will succeed,” Jian Wushuang started trying with excitement.

He tried and was quickly rewarded with a result.

“I succeeded!”

There was thrill twinkling in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He could feel that there was a unique skill in Blood Mountain Sword.

The unique skill was Eternal Light, which he had created, and the existence of the unique skill was bizarre. It was just like an inborn secret skill power of Blood Mountain sword.

It was just like Blood-killing Plate Armor.

Blood-killing Plate Armor carried three layers of power. Now, Jian Wushuang could trigger the second layer of power. In other words, his power increased tremendously.

“Jian Wushuang, try to swing your sword,” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate, swinging sword casually in the secret room.

He didn’t put his swordsmanship to play and he used a normal strength but with just one swung, hong! The terrifying power erupted directly. Jian Wushuang obviously felt that the power of the swing was not any weaker compared to a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven.

“This?”

There was terror that flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes but he swung his sword again the very next moment.

Then, he erupted his power entirely along with the second layer of power in Blood-killing Plate Armor.

Wow!

Jian Wushuang performed the Dawn Light technique, which was the most ordinary rank one unique skill. However, the stroke tore the void before him easily and the erupted power was very strong, Even those Peak Universe Gods in the First Heaven would have been terrified if they could have seen it.

“How was it?”

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

This is too impressive!

After integrating Eternal Light into the Blood Mountain Sword, the power that the Blood Mountain Sword displayed was extremely powerful.

His personal strength along with the second layer of power in Blood-killing Plate Armor could, theoretically, reach the power level of advanced Universe God in the First Heaven, but far from peak Universe God in the First Heaven. However, he was still full of energy. His power could be compared favorably with peak Universe God in the First Heaven, or even be considered slightly superior!

The difference in power between an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven and a peak Universe God in the First Heaven was extremely vast. However, it was made up for entirely by Blood Mountain Sword.

In other words, Jian Wushuang could be even-handed with a peak Universe God in the First Heaven a merely with the eruption of his power. He might even be stronger by one notch.

“This is so unbelievable.” Jian Wushuang mumbled.

“Unbelievable? What’s so unbelievable?” King of Venomous Worms thought otherwise, “Jian Wushuang, you are too inexperienced. You have no idea how valuable the Blood Mountain Sword is. It is the highest grade of embryo sword, which is sufficient for countless experts to fight with. Once the highest grade of embryo sword is integrated with a unique skill, the power would be displayed constantly. When you were just performing swordsmanship, you already triggered the power of Eternal Light in the Blood Mountain Sword.”

“In other words, a simple swing of Blood Mountain Sword equals the power of Eternal Light when you performed it with all your strength. If you were to put your unique skill into play, it would be like stacking two unique skills together. How scary is that?”

“Stacking two unique skills together?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and suddenly understood. He felt delighted, “Compared to a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven, my only downfall was that the erupted power is too weak. Even if I trigger the second layer of power in Blood-killing Plate Armor, I could only be compared favorably with an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven. But now, it’s a different story!”

It’s really different!

After Eternal Light integrated into Blood Mountain Sword, his power could reach the level of Peak Universe God in the First Heaven if he were to fully erupt his power with the aid of the Blood Mountain Sword. He could be evenly matched with a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven or even slightly stronger.

His overall power had increased tremendously!
