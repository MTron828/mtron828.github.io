Chapter 1612: Defeat

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Real Gods who were watching the battle from outside of Fighting Space were exclaiming in surprise.

They also knew how impressive Real God Tian Ming’s technique was.

As long as the life realm existed, he would secure an invincible position.

Vroom!

A fierce sword light swept and directly tore the soul snakes that swarmed over him into pieces but at the next moment, there were more soul snakes that came straight ahead again.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang harrumphed coldly and there were crimson flames soaring up surrounding him. Suddenly, it formed a vast sea of fire.

And he was the emperor in the sea of fire.

The life realm was engulfed among the sea of fire but it didn’t weaken it at all.

“This is never-ending,” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “It seems that I have to break his realm entirely.”

Then, Jian Wushuang held Blood Mountain Sword with both his hands and raised them up.

The moment he raised the sword, there were sword shadows that crystallized one after another in the Fighting Space.

The sword shadows were extremely huge. They were formed by a combination of Jian Wushuang’s sword intention and his Power of Heaven Way. Along with Jian Wushuang’s tremendous enhancement in comprehension towards Heaven Way, the size of the sword shadows grew a lot bigger and the power became a lot stronger.

At that very moment, there were sixteen sword shadows that appeared in the Fighting Space simultaneously.

One should know that when Jian Wushuang first came to Thunderbolt Island, even if he gave his all, not only could he crystallize just ten sword shadows, but their size and power also wasn’t that huge.

The sixteen sword shadows floated in the air. Every single one of the sword shadows possessed the power to destroy heaven and earth. It was sufficient for an ordinary Eternal Real God to deal with it solemnly. However, the next moment, the sixteen sword shadows superposed at a terrifying speed.

Jian Wushuang performed the power superposition skill.

Hong!

A brand new sword shadow appeared in the universe.

The size of the sword shadow was a few times bigger than the sixteen sword shadows and the power… when the ten sword shadows had superposed previously, the power had increased by thirty times. But then, when the sixteen sword shadows superposed, the power had increased by forty eight times impressively.

Rumble. The moment the sword shadow appeared, the terrifying pressured pressed over wantonly.

In the Fighting Space, Real God Tian Ming, who was at the core of life realm, his pupils contracted at the sight of the sword shadow.

Outside the Fighting Space, the Real Gods who were watching the battle revealed a shocked expression

“This power, is it a rank two Real God strongest unique skill?”

“The level of unique skill is undetermined but, in terms of power, it has already reached rank two strongest!”

“My goodness, a Universe God has created a rank two Real God strongest unique skill?”

The Real Gods who were watching the battle were dumbfounded.

Plus, almost all of them were Eternal Real Gods. Even among them, there were very few who had created rank-two Real God strongest unique skills.

After all, rank two Real God strongest unique skill was normally created by the Eternal Real Gods on top.

But then…

They didn’t know that the unique skill that Jian Wushuang had yet to reach the level in the actual face. It was power superposition skill that had enabled him to perform Myriad Waves and enhanced the power to be compared favorably with a rank-two Real God strongest unique skill.

“Be gone!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold and the sword shadow that gave out terrifying pressure charged towards the life realm where Real God Tian Ming was.

There was a harsh gale and Real God Tian Ming’s teeth were shivering.

“Bastard. Don’t expect to defeat me!”

The entire Fighting Space shook vigorously and Real God Tian Ming in the life realm saw the flowers and plants that filled the sky suddenly grew luxuriantly and gathered at a terrifying speed. In the end, it gathered into a strong hand of life.

The hand contained boundless vigor and under the manipulation of Real God Tian Ming, it clawed the sword shadow that was slashing at lightning speed.

At the same time, Real God Tian Ming wielded a silver club in his hand. Under a flash of silver light, a huge club that seemed to extend from the ancient times suddenly shook heaven and earth and swung out.

Very soon, both parties collided.

The hand of life immediately caught the sword shadow that Jian Wushuang had thrown but it didn’t withstand it for long. Then, there was a cracking noise. The hand cracked from the middle and in a short instance, the hand that gathered the power of life realm shattered.

Then, the sword shadow continued to clash against the huge club that Real God Tian Ming wielded.

There was a loud bang as though there were two worlds that clashed against each other ferociously.

The huge club instantly collapsed along with the life realm, along with Real God Tian Ming’s body. They were pressed down by the sword shadow.

Vroom!!!

Everything in the Fighting Space suddenly quieted down.

Jian Wushuang was still standing there without damage and he slowly put Blood Mountain Sword into its scabbard.

Before him, Real God Tian Ming stood there and his aura didn’t weaken, but his face grew grave.

“Real God Tian Ming, you lost!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was calm.

Real God Tian Ming heard what he said and his body quivered.

Lost, he had really lost.

Jian Wushuang pressed him down with just one stroke. The reason why he was standing there without damage was due to the Fighting Space.

However, Real God Tian Ming found it hard to accept the result.

He couldn’t imagine that in merely one thousand and five hundred years, Jian Wushuang’s power had increased to such a level.

“Similarly, on Thunderbolt Island, I also went to Fairy Palace for comprehension. My improvement in the past one thousand and five hundred years wasn’t small either. However, his improvement is obviously much greater than mine,” Real God Tian Ming glared at Jian Wushuang.

Sometimes, between people, there was really no comparison required.

Real God Tian Ming thought he was a top genius. He was a Void Real God who reached the threshold of Chaotic Real God in comprehension of Life Doctrine, which was outstanding.

However, Jian Wushuang was obviously more impressive than he was.

“I agreed to bet and I accept loss. Twenty years of cultivation time in Fairy Palace, here you go!” Real God Tian Ming said.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Real God Tian Ming didn’t speak again but turned to walk out of the Fighting Space.

He had yet to leave the Fighting Space entirely but he had noticed that there was a figure that had plunged into the Fighting Space from the corner of the battlefield.

“This is… Monster King?” Real God Tian Ming was stunned and he stopped his steps instantly.

The person was in a black robe and his face was cold. The most eye-catching part was his right cheek. It was covered in a black, secretive pattern, which was ferocious-looking.

He came before Real God Tian Ming and glanced at him, “Top genius in Four Symbol Mansion lost to a Universe God. Tian Ming, you’re useless!”
