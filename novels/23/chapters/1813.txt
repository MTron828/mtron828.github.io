Chapter 1814: Communication

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In an hour’s time, the Dao soldiers surrounding Wu Hun’s dead body submitted..

“Haha, a total of one hundred and thirty-two Dao soldiers. Among them there were a hundred and twenty-eight bronze-armored Dao soldiers and four silver-armored Dao soldiers. Although they don’t have consciousness, they only knew to follow their owner’s command blindly but don’t know how to fight at close quarters, they should be able to fight evenly with a Sir God as long as there are ten bronze-armored Dao soldiers. With so many Dao soldiers, they could totally fight with over ten Sir Gods. With the four silver-armored Dao soldiers, they could fight evenly with an Emperor God!” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had gained a bountiful harvest from the trip to Crimson Lightning Region.

Not only had he received an ancient tribe bloodline inheritance and his power had increased tremendously, he had also gotten himself Immemorial Celestial Body and Five Gem Armor.

At the same time, he had soul-controlled an expert, Jian Yi. He had also reduced the Dao soldiers to submission…

“Ancient battlefield!”

“This is the ancient battlefield with endless opportunities!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shimmering with hope.

He finally understood why the experts in Eternal Chaotic World desired Ancient Mystery Land so badly.

However, although Ancient Mystery Land was also an ancient battlefield, it had been opened many times and every time it had opened, a large number of experts had flooded in. Many opportunities were already taken. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The ancient battlefield surrounding Green Fire World was different.

On the battlefield, besides the ancient experts who were in a deep sleep, only Jian Wushuang who possessed the power of an Almighty could wander there.

In other words, he had conquered the huge ancient battlefield alone.

If the experts in Eternal Chaotic World were to find out, they would definitely be green with envy.

“The ancient battlefield has endless opportunities. Fifty thousand years ago, I was too weak and I couldn’t find anything. But now, I can wander and search through this place,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“There’s no hurry, let me return to Green Fire World for now.”

Jian Wushuang immediately returned to Green Fire World.

When he passed by the ocean of crimson lightning again, he heard from Jian Yi about the threat hidden in the ocean of crimson lightning.

“Humph. As expected, Dao Yuanzi did hide things from me. He knew that ocean of crimson lightning contained Sacred Thunder of Extermination but he didn’t mention it to me. He wanted me to be killed by the Sacred Thunder of Extermination so that he could escape my control,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

After he found out, he was naturally extra cautious when he passed through the ocean of crimson lightning, but he didn’t encounter any Sacred Thunder of Extermination.

Jian Wushuang finally returned to Green Fire World after some time.

The supreme sanctuary of Green Fire World, Wushuang City.

After the filtration of the genius assembly by Green Fire World, there were only a hundred geniuses who received the chance to cultivate in Wushuang City. The cultivation time was limited to one thousand years.

Besides the geniuses, there were some higher-ups in Green Fire World that had paid a great price to cultivate in Wushuang City as well.

By then, Wushuang City had been built for a hundred years. The geniuses and experts who cultivated in the city had realized the benefits of cultivating there. Hence, they were naturally dying to enter.

However, Jian Wushuang understood that Green Fire World had just settled down and Wushuang City had been built not too long ago. It wouldn’t be realistic if he hoped to see results so quickly.

The result would only show itself in another few thousand years.

“Wushuang City is where spiritual energy concentrated the most in Green Fire World. Jian Yi, from today, you shall stay in Wushuang City. I will provide you with resources to recover your power. I hope your power can be recovered in the shortest time possible,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes,” Jian Yi nodded politely.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had yet to take control of Dao Yuanzi entirely. Hence, he kept his guard up and didn’t dare to give him any chance to recover his power.

But then, it was entirely different.

Dao Yuanzi’s consciousness had been wiped off. There was only Jian Yi, who was loyal to Jian Wushuang. Naturally, the greater Jian Yi’s power, the better.

If Jian Yi’s power could recover to his peak, he would be a Peak Chaotic Realm, which equaled to a Great Emperor. Also, as an ancient expert, his skills and power would be extraordinary. Even among Great Emperors, he should be an absolute expert as well. Among Great Emperors in Eternal Chaotic World, only Emperor Bai, who was widely recognized as the strongest, would be able to place himself above Jian Yi.

However, Jian Wushuang also knew that it wouldn’t be that easy to fully recover Jian Yi’s power.

Besides Jian Yi, Jian Wushuang had also left a hundred bronze-armored Dao soldiers in Wushuang City. These Dao soldiers obeyed Jian Wushuang’s command to safeguard Wushuang City.

The rest of the twenty-eight bronze-armored Dao soldier and four silver-armored Dao soldiers, Jian Wushuang took with him.

After all, he was going to wander at the surrounding ancient battlefield. The ancient battlefield was filled with danger and many mysterious places. Jian Wushuang didn’t dare to probe hastily but he could utilize the Dao soldiers. If there were to be danger, it would be nothing to lose a few Dao soldiers.

After making arrangements for Jian Yi and the Dao soldiers, Jian Wushuang called for his disciple, He Xiu.

“Master,” He Xiu stood before Jian Wushuang with respect.

“You have cultivated in Wushuang City for over a hundred years. How do you feel?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Although Wushuang City’s cultivation resources couldn’t be compared favorably with Lineage of Star’s, it isn’t far behind, especially the spiritual energy here. It is so intense and there are many opportunities in Wushuang City that are aimed at sword cultivators. Hence, to me, cultivation in Wushuang City is of greater help than cultivation in Lineage of Star,” He Xiu replied honestly.

“How about your senior?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“She improved quite well and she has reached the limit of Universe Master. Her first God’s test will be coming soon,” He Xiu answered.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly and commanded, “I came here today to tell you that I reckon I will stay in my hometown for quite some time. It is not necessary for you to stay here. If you want to wander outside, go ahead. I only ask that you do not share any information about this place after you leave.”

“I understand,” He Xiu nodded heavily and smiled,” Hall Master Yuan happened to send me a message a while back. He said that he needed me to take care of some errands. I was going to inform you.”

“Hall Master Yuan sent a message to you?”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “You have been in Wushuang City all this while. You never left, so how did Hall Master Yuan send you a message? Could it be…”

With confusion, Jian Wushuang took out a communication token.

In a short while, the other side of the token responded.

“As expected!”

Jian Wushuang was surprised, “This battlefield can communicate with the outside world now?”
