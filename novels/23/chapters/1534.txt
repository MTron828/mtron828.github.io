Chapter 1535: The Winner

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the blink of an eye, eighty years passed.

Many Universe Gods were gathered in the open space and the God Destroying King was sitting down with his legs crossed in the center of the crowd. On the chess set in front of him, the six-hundredth black chess piece was dissipating slowly.

“The six-hundredth move!”

“As expected of the God Destroying King. Out of so many Universe Gods, he is the first one to solve the six-hundredth move.”

“I am also an expert of the Universe God ranking list. However, until now, I have only managed to solve the five-hundred-and-twenty-first move. The gap is really huge!”

Many Universe Gods at the open space were all gasping.

Among the Universe Gods, many of them had lost their confidence and gave up on the test a long time ago. At that moment, they were not solving their chess sets. Instead, they were observing other people’s performances.

Of course, they were only observing and dared not disturb them.

Afte rall, Real God Wu Bei had already said. In the third level of cave, if anyone dared to make a move or disturb other people during their test, they would be killed instantly.

Inside the vast hall outside the cave.

Many experts were having a conversation.

“The God Destroying King has already solved the six-hundredth move and he is the first to do so. I wonder how many more people will be able to achieve this feat.”

“There are still twenty years, so there should be a few more.”

The five-hundredth move of the Scattered Stars Game is a big threshold. Similarly, the six-hundredth move is also a big threshold.

The God Destroying King was the only person who had passed the six-hundredth move so far. However, there were a few people following closely behind him.

Seven months later, Duan Lingfeng caught up with the God Destroying King and resolved the six-hundredth move as well.

After that, another three years passed and Jian Wushuang also achieved the same feat.

The first test had gone on for ninety years and there were only ten years remaining in the time limit of a hundred years.

Out of the Universe Gods, there were three people who had resolved the greatest number of moves.

The three people were the God Destroying King, Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang. All of them were currently on the six-hundred-and-third move and it seemed that all of them were stuck there.

“For the Scattered Stars Game, the more moves that are resolved, the harder it gets. For a Universe God to solve five hundred moves within a hundred years, he can already be considered a top genius. As for those who are able to solve six-hundred moves, they are definitely monster-level existences. Such monsters only come by once every million years. However, in this generation, three of them actually appeared at the same time?”

“These three people are true geniuses. The first White Blaze Fruit tree will definitely fall into one of their hands. However, I wonder who that person will be?”

“It should be the God Destroying King. He has the strongest abilities. Moreover, compared to Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang, he was the first person to solve the six-hundredth move.”

“That might not be the case.”

“No matter what, we will be able to see the outcome soon. If I’m not wrong, among the three of them, whoever solves the six-hundred-and-third move first should be able to obtain the White Blaze Fruit tree.”

“I agree.”

Many experts were having a conversation with one another. However, Jian Wushuang, who was in the center of the open space, opened his eyes, and on the chessboard in front of him, the six-hundred-and-third black chess piece had already started to dissipate.

“It’s Jian Wushuang!”

“He has solved the six-hundred-and-third move!”

“It’s actually him?”

Many Almighties in the big hall revealed a surprised expression.

Previously, they had thought that it was possible for either Jian Wushuang, the God Destroying King or Duan Lingfeng to win.

However, they felt that the God Destroying King had the highest probability, followed by Duan Lingfeng and finally Jian Wushuang.

However, who could expect that Jian Wushuang, who they thought had the lowest probability, would actually solve the six-hundred-and third move faster than the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng?

“This little kid. If my guess is not wrong, he only started to use his strength after solving the six-hundredth move!” the red-haired old man with a horn on his forehead said in a low voice.

“That’s highly possible,” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain also nodded his head and his eyes glowed brilliantly, “Be it the God Destroying King or Duan Lingfeng, both of them only started to use their strength at the five-hundred-and-ninetieth move and they stopped advancing steadily. As such, Jian Wushuang was three years slower than them in solving the six-hundredth move. However, Jian Wushuang’s reserved strength is obviously greater!”

“The outcome is decided!”

“For the first test, the most outstanding person is Jian Wushuang!”

“The first White Blaze Fruit tree is his!”

The other Almighties also nodded their heads.

For the remaining ten years, as per what the Almighties had said, Jian Wushuang had reserved a lot of strength. After taking the lead from the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng, he continued leading. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng had solved the six-hundred-and-third move, he had solved the six-hundred-and-fourth move.

While the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng were still at the six-hundred-and-fourth move, he had solved the six-hundred-and-fifth move.

Finally, the time limit of one hundred years was up.

In the end, Jian Wushuang solved a total of six-hundred-and-seven moves. As for the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng, both of them solved six-hundred-and-four moves.

Jian Wushuang had actually taken three years longer than the two of them to solve the six-hundredth move. However, the end result was Jian Wushuang leading the two of them by three moves.

As such, it could be said that Jian Wushuang’s level of comprehension was not really a lot higher than theirs. Instead, it could be said that his understanding of the Scattered Stars Game was a lot greater than theirs.

After all, he had analyzed with great concentration and solved the Small Scattered Stars Game before. As for the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng, it was the first time that both of them had come across the Scattered Stars Game. Therefore, Jian Wushuang naturally had an advantage.

If it were his first time coming across the Scattered Stars Game, his performance would probably be about the same as the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng’s. At best, it would only be slightly better. If he could solve another move, it would already be impressive. After all, the God Destroying King and Duan Lingfeng were the kind of super geniuses that appeared once every million years.

Buzz!

When the time limit was up, the giant chessboard that was floating in the void as well as the chessboards in front of the Universe Gods all started to dissipate.

The Universe Gods who were sitting n the open space with their legs crossed stood up in succession. Their scorching-hot eyes then looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“The first White Blaze Fruit tree is his!”

“He actually managed to solve six hundred and seven steps of the Scattered Stars Game within a hundred years. That’s really impressive.”

The Universe Gods were gasping in admiration. However, there was nothing that they could do.

The test was a fair competition and Jian Wushuang had used his own abilities to outperform everyone. Hence, the first White Blaze Fruit tree naturally belonged to him.

“I have already done my best. However, the number of moves that I solved is still less than him?” the God Destroying King also glanced at Jian Wushuang and he shook his head after that.

At the open space, apart from Jian Wushuang, there was one more person who attracted a lot of attention.

This person was Zi Dongwang.

However, Zi Dongang was a complete joke in the eyes of many Universe Gods who were present at the open space.
