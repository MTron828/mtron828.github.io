Chapter 2448: Subdued

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Too fast. He was just too fast!”

“We must impede his speed, otherwise our attacks will not reach him at all,” said a First-Class Divine Demon from the Great Compassion Sect.

Long Zishan looked at Yu Aoqing. “Junior Sister Aoqing.”

“Let me handle him.” Yu Aoqing’s face was cold. A grey gem that was exuding a strange aura miraculously appeared in her hand.

The grey gem was filled with surging grey energies and Yu Aoqing’s divine power brought those grey mist out from the grey gem.

The grey mist in a speedy manner covered the area far and wide. In just a blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang was instantly engulfed in the mist.

He could feel a strong force oppressing his movements.

“Is this the power of a Domain Treasure?” Jian Wushuang stole a look at the grey gem before shaking his head thereafter.

“It’s Indeed a Domain Treasure, but a very low level one. It’s probably just an ordinary Domain Treasure,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Domain Treasures were extremely rare, both in the Eternal Chaotic World of his previous life and the Ancient God Domain of his current life.

Such treasures were scarce. Although Yu Aoqing was the top genius in the Wusha Wilderness, she was still only a Divine Demon. It was hard enough for her to come up with such a rare Domain Treasure, let alone bringing out some extremely precious Domain Treasures.

“I’m afraid you can’t limit my speed with just a Domain Treasure,” sneered Jian Wushuang.

“A single Domain Treasure is of course not enough, but how about adding this?” Yu Aoqing grunted and a stream of black current flowed from her.

It soon filled the area and combined perfectly with the grey mist.

The pressures on Jian Wushuang’s body greatly increased the moment both of them coalesced.

“Oh, a domain secret technique?” Jian Wushuang’s expression flickered.

The grey mist was released from that grey gem treasure.

Whereas, the black current erupting from Yu Aoqing’s divine power was obviously a remarkable domain secret technique.

The perfect combination of both had increased the domain’s effect by multiple folds.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang tried moving around but his expression turned grim after just two simple movements.

“My speed had been reduced by nearly 50 percent?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The reduction of his speed by half was equivalent to one fold.

“Hmph, you can only blame yourself for being in a lowly realm and your insufficiently strong divine power. If you are as strong as a First-Class Divine Demon, I might only be able to suppress 30 percent of your speed at most.” Yu Aoqing stared at Jian Wushuang and scoffed.

“His speed has been limited, which is equivalent to breaking his wings. He’ll die for sure. Attack!” Long Zishan’s expression turned ferocious as his killing intent intensified. Purple lights erupted from his body while the purple cyclone got bigger under his feet.

Boom! A fascinating bright purple light descended.

Long Zishan appeared in front of Jian Wufang like a formidable god with his gleamingly dazzling purple light spear at hand.

“It’s the Purple Thunder Divine Light Spear!”

Long Zishan’s spear pierced forward.

Even the sky seemed to be perforated.

Jian Wushuang frowned as his speed had been restricted and he could not avoid the attack with only his current speed. He could only attempt to parry it with his sword.

A head-on collision happened... Boom!

Jian Wushuang fell backward.

“Haha, that’s for sure. No matter how good you are, you’re just a Chaotic Realm. Your divine power is after all far inferior to First-Class Divine Demons. As long as your speed is restricted, you won’t be able to display your sword techniques. In that case, you are not my match at all.” Long Zishan let out a hearty laugh.

An excited look appeared on the faces of Yu Aoqing and the four First-Class Divine Demons who formed the Four Elephant Formation. They lunged forward to Jian Wushuang without wasting any time.

Under the extreme speed limitations, Jian Wushuang was unable to perform his strange and terrifying sword techniques. He was completely subdued by those few people from the Great Compassion Sect.

Boom! boom! Boom!

The war began.

A large number of various sects’ genius disciples gathered somewhere near the battlefield as witnesses. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Among the crowd was an extremely weak looking girl in red who squatted there.

“Hong Luo.”

The girl heard a noise, turned towards the void’s direction, and saw two figures rushing towards her.

“Oh, Huan Chen and Huo Yang. It’s the two of you. What’s the matter?” The girl in red had a strange expression.

“Of course we have something to bring up.” The young man in a white robe replied with a polite smile.

That young man was called Huan Chen. Just like Huo Yang and Hong Luo, he was also one of the Twelve Minor Kings.

Huo Yang was ranked tenth among them.

Hong Luo was ranked fifth.

Huan Chen, who ranked even higher than Long Zishan was ranked second. He was the most powerful and terrifying among all of them.

In Wusha Wilderness, Huan Chen had always been regarded as the ultimate expert who was second only to Tu Qiancheng.

Tu Qiancheng had not entered the Saint’s Tomb because he had broken through and reached the Peak Divine Demon Realm. Due to that, Huan Chen should be the strongest among the disciples in the tomb. Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang had taken away his limelight.

“Hong Luo, don’t tell me you’re just going to stay here all this time and watch the Great Compassionate Sect disciples behead Jian Wushuang, bagging both his position token and the rewards on his head,” said Huan Chen with a smile.

“Well, that’s my plan. Can’t I do that?” Hong Luo gave an insouciant reply.

“Well, you can. It’s just a pity in this case as Jian Wushuang has caused too much trouble in the tomb and offended countless sects. Those sects have put a bounty on his head which has since increased. It seems that killing him will reap much greater benefits than getting a position token,” commented Huan Chen.

“Huan Chen, just be frank and tell me what’s on your mind. Don’t go beating around the bush like this,” said Hong Luo impatiently.

Huan Chen was taken aback momentarily and then smiled. “Then I’ll be straightforward. I’ve already discussed this with Huo Yang. Later, when those Great Compassion Sect’s people push Jian Wushuang to dead ends, we’ll immediately take action before them and finish him off so that the position token in his hand and the bounty on his head would be ours. However, this is a heist against the Great Compassion, after all. Huo Yang and I are outnumbered.”

That’s why we’re here for you.”
