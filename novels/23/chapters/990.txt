Chapter 991: The Bystander

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This is madness!”

Jian Wushuang brow grimaced with an inexplicable pain that seemed to stem from his heart as he witnessed with own eyes the massacre taking place before him.

“Uncle Xiao had mentioned of the brutality and carnage between different tribes and races as they slaughter one another. To think that I am witnessing the very same myself.”

The gap between the two different races was so apparent that the losing side could barely defend themselves from the merciless butchery of the aggressing faction.

There was hardly any ounce of mercy for even the children and women were also butchered like the dying warriors fighting to defend them.

“A race of ten thousand decimated to the brink of utter annihilation. So terrible that there might not even be more than a handful left of the remnants who manage to survive.” Jian Wushuang muttered as he heaved a heavy sigh.

Just then…

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang turned with astonishment as he saw a figure speeding at him suddenly.

It was a middle-aged man whose skin was of a copper-bronze complexion. Bristles of unkempt hairs were visible upon the man’s chin as he cradled a child not more than ten years of age tightly in his arms.

“Father.” The child whimpered as he looked upon his father, his cheeks red with anxiety. “Mother, Uncle, and Third Uncle.. they…”

His whole body shaking with intense grief, the middle-aged man spoke through gritted teeth. “They are all dead! They have all perished! Our entire tribe is no more!”

Hearing the words that confirmed his dread, the child fell into silence, his little hand balled into a tightly-clenched fist with rage as he suppressed his urge to break into tears.

“After them! Leave none alive!” A deep roar came from behind. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The middle-aged man turned pale as he heard the loud cries behind him. Turning to his back, he saw four figures chasing after him.

The four pursuers who came radiated powerful aurae of their own; all of which was on a par with the levels of the Eternal Realm.

“Curse our fortunes. We have been noticed!”

The middle-aged man swore under his breath and increased his speed. But he had barely run far when he noticed the figure of a young male in crimson robes who had a sword carried over his back.

It did not take long for the four pursuers to also notice Jian Wushuang’s presence.

“Hahaha! It seems that we have overlooked one here. Finish him off, Brothers!” The man with purple hair exclaimed heartily with a laugh.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened with displeasure as he heard the cries of the men about him. Replying with a growl, Jian Wushuang spoke, “I am but an innocent bystander.”

“A bystander? Hahaha! Do you expect me to take you for your words?” The purple-haired man sneered coldly, “None of the Heavenly Ape Clan will be allowed to live past this day. We will eliminate anyone around here to prevent any possibilities of any survivors!”

A strong bloodthirstiness rose in the air as the four men readied themselves to satiate their craving for blood.

Even though they were hardly the strongest tribe in the Samsara Continent, they were nonetheless the strongest in the nearby regions. Hence, they had tormented the weaker tribes nearby with their malice and cruelty.

The annihilation of the Heavenly Ape Clan on this day was but a mere instance of the mediocrity of terror and destruction these people have inflicted upon other. Sensing that Jian Wushuang was of the Eternal Realm, the purple-hair man regarded him as nothing but a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

“You are willing to kill anyone just to prevent from sparing any survivors?” Jian Wushuang murmured as his eyes glinted with cold fury when the four men charged towards him.

Just when the four men were but tens of meters away from him…

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang barked a thunderous roar that was imbued with the Ancient God Power.

“Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu!”

The four men felt their bodies shuddered, followed by agonizing pain that forced them to spat out mouthfuls of blood as they recoiled from the blasts of force that hammered them.

“What was that?” The purple-haired man looked at Jian Wushuang incredulous once he regained his steadiness.

“Despite his level of the Eternal Realm, the young man possesses unusual strengths, or at least he has remarkable aptitude in using methods of sonic attacks!” The purple-haired man’s brows furrowed with doubt. With only one loud cry, the young man was able to inflict upon them serious injuries. This was hardly a strength that the four of them could easily defeat.

The purple-haired man immediately relayed a message using telepathy, “We have encountered a strong enemy with powers possibly at the pinnacle of the Eternal Realm. He could be the strongest warrior that the Heavenly Ape Clan had been hiding all along.”

Shortly after the message was relayed, the four stood quietly and observed Jian Wushuang, showing no signs of attacking once more.

The middle-aged man who was escaping with his child, stopped in his tracks not far away.

He shouted to Jian Wushuang, “Run for your life, young man! The rest of the powerful warriors of the Bone Devil Clan will be arriving soon!”

“The Bone Devil Clan?” Jian Wushuang heard the warning and felt surprised with the name. He looked up suddenly, murmuring softly, “It is too late, they are here.”

He had barely finished his sentence when the figure of a large man with a wide girth, clothed in red, landed before Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was standing at a little less than a thousand miles away from the site of the massacre. But it had merely taken the man, an elderly person clothed in crimson red, to arrive in the blink of an eye after he had received the message of the purple-haired man.

“This is terrible. Of all evil monsters, it had to be him to had come!” The middle-aged man screamed with horror, breaking into a run as he tried to carry his child and escape.

“There are still powerful warriors of the Heavenly Ape Clan that still draws breath?” The elder in red asked as he surveyed his surrounding with a hateful glare, the strange runic mark on the left of his forehead visibly standing out to all that had seen him.

“It was him, Elder Scorpion!” The purple-haired man pointed at Jian Wushuang and spoke to the elder. “It was he who had injured us grievously when we encountered him during our chase for the remnants of the Heavenly Ape Clan. He had released a sound wave attack with a loud cry that struck us hard.”

“Oh? A sound wave attack?” The eyes of the red-robed elder narrowed slightly with suspicion. “None of the warriors of the Heavenly Ape Clan were adept in the methods of sound wave attacks. Who are you?”

“As I have mentioned to your kinsmen earlier, I am but a mere innocent bystander. It was the four of your kinsmen who have mistaken me as an enemy and tried to attack me. I have no choice but to defend myself in addition to allowing them a taste of their own medicine.” Jian Wushuang replied indifferently.

“A bystander, you say?” The red-robed elder’s brows rose with apparent doubt. With an arrogant snort, he spoke, “Us of the Bone Devil Clan have proclaimed our intentions to annihilate the Heavenly Ape Clan ten days ago. As such, the various warriors and practitioners of the other clans and tribes nearby have all withdrawn from this vicinity. This begs the question: why are you here if you are not one of the Heavenly Ape Clan, as you so claim?”

“Clearly, you were lying!”

Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He has just arrived at the Samsara Continent from the Void Continent. It was by a stroke of woeful fortune that he emerged here.

His appearance here was purely coincidental as he had hardly any ties with the Heavenly Ape Clan.

“Hmph! Moreover, only one of the Bone Devil Clan may enact judgment upon one of our own. Who are you, a mere warrior of the Eternal Realm, to dispense punishment to us?” The red-robed elder growled furiously.

“And for that reason, no matter who you are, you shall pay the price of insolence” The red-robed elder hurled himself at Jian Wushuang as he spoke, his aura rapidly rising with an overwhelming and terrible intensity.
