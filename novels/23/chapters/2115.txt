Chapter 2116 Day of Activation

“Oh?” Lord Fen frowned.He had not exposed himself to the outside world for many years, it was natural he had not heard of the name Jian Wushuang.

Kaiser Blood started mumbling, “To recreate a cultivation system that goes against natural law… it was definitely not done by experts from this Era. If anyone had the skills to this, it must have been a super expert from my Era, the strong few. But who did it, and why did he create this? I do not know.”

Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu fell quiet upon hearing that.

They may have been impressive in the current era, but place them in the Ancient Era amongst the few super experts of that time? They were nothing more than ants, easily squashed.

If they ever encountered such an expert in their lifetimes, they would all need to get down on their knees.

“Enough of this, I just received news from the Archelon Palace. The Sanctuary Alliance intends to activate the Heaven Repairing Palace once again. They want to increase their Great Emperor numbers before the fight,” Kaiser Blood said,

“Great Emperor levels are the best this Era can reach. We have made preparations for so many years, but we still do not have enough Great Emperors. Along with the various mistakes we made previously, we no longer have an advantage against them. Our fighting power is almost equal to theirs as of now, but if they gain a few more Great Emperors…”

Kaiser Blood looked at Demon King Chen Yu.

Demon King Chen Yu’s face darkened.

He knew, the advantage the Three Emperors World had previously had had been lost by the Archelon Palace under his lead.

He had infiltrated both human and special tribes from the Archelon Palace for so many years, but he had lost everything in moments.

Years of effort, gone.

“Relax, the Heaven Repairing Palace lies within the Ancient Mystery Land. We have laid our traps over there for so many years, with me in charge this time I guarantee there will be no more mistakes, but that Emperor Bai…” Demon King Chen Yu frowned. Recalling the previous fight with him, he knew he was not his opponent.

If Emperor Bai were to appear, he would not stand a chance.

“I’ll pressure Emperor Bai on my side, giving him no time to clone himself,” Kaiser Blood said.

“That’ll do. As long as Emperor Bai doesn’t appear, no one in the Sanctuary Alliance can stop me. I’ll kill all that enter the Heaven Repairing Palace, and maybe a Great Emperor or two,” Demon King Chen Yu said.

Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen looked at one another and nodded.

Indeed, regardless of Sanctuary Alliance or Special Tribes Alliance, Emperor Bai was the only terrifying person around. No one else was a Third Stage Great Emperor.

As long as Emperor Bai did not surface, Demon King Chen Yu could crush anyone who stood in his way.

“Another thing,” Demon King Chen Yu said. “We brought back some experts from the Sky Swallowing Clan from the Special Tribes domain. Ba Su from that clan wishes to enter our land of opportunity, and try to master some Rules of Order.”

“Ba Su?” Kaiser Blood squinted, and said, “Ba Su was not able to complete our mission, but he has the ability. As a pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor, he would be strongest within the Three Emperors World, excluding us. If he can really master just a bit of Rules of Order and ascend to Third Stage levels… that’ll be good for us.”

“His chances are slim, but he can try,” Lord Fen nodded.

“In that case, we’ll let him try once. But before he goes in, preparations must be made,” Kaiser Blood said.

“Of course, if he wants to enter, he’ll have to listen to our orders from now on,” Demon King Chen Yu laughed.

…

In the Eternal Chaotic World, near Thunderbolt Island, was a huge floating plateau.

This piece of land was built by Sanctuary Alliance experts at a cost. The people that resided on the plateau were the experts from the Special Tribes Alliance.

In a huge hall.

Jian Wushuang sat there, watching over King Chen Yu, Black Dragon Emperor, and An Quan.

“I’ll leave the Alliance matters to the three of you during my period of absence,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Rest assured Ancient Emperor, the human Sanctuary Alliance is sincere. During this period of time, they have not clashed with us. Nothing will happen while you are at the Palace,” King Chen Xing said.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded and left.

At the Void outside the plateau, Abysmal Saint Master had been waiting.

“Abysmal, you’re making the rounds personally?” Jian Wushuang laughed at him.

“Not just me, East Royal’s already waiting outside the Heaven Repairing Palace.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“What can I say, the Palace lies within Ancient Mystery Land, not under Sanctuary Alliance control. Furthermore, this is important. East Royal and I will guard the Palace till you all leave,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

He knew that the Sanctuary Alliance dared not be reckless after spending much to activate the Palace.

They did not just send two Great Emperors to guard the Palace, but placed multiple Sealing Formations at the Ancient Mystery Land’s entrances, with guards to protect them as well. This was to ensure no one from the Three Emperors World would come to interfere.

Furthermore, Emperor Bai personally deployed himself to the Void outside the Three Emperors World. If any experts were to come out, he would block them.

The Sanctuary Alliance made their fair share of preparations.

“Let’s go,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang replied. Using a wormhole, they arrived at one of the entrances.

Jian Wushuang immediately discovered the multiple Sealing Formations. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Tight security.”

With that, the both of them stepped into the Ancient Mystery Land.
