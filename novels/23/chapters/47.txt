“Boss Yin, this is brother Swordsman. He will work with us later.” Ling Tianhao smiled at the playful girl.

“Swordsman?” The girl looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “I know that you fought with Dongfang Yu here three days ago, and you didn’t last three strikes.”

“Yes, that is true.” Jian Wushuang touched his nose without denying it.

“I am Yin Min. You can call me Boss Yin, like Mouse does. From now on, if you work with me, I can guarantee that no one will dare to bully you,” said the playful girl, Yin Min, patting her chest.

Jian Wushuang thought that Yin Min was just boasting, but he still called out, “Boss Yin.”

“Yeah.” Yin Min nodded without saying anything further.

At that moment, Ling Tianhao said to Jian Wushuang quietly, “Brother Swordsman, we are so lucky to have the backup of Boss Yin. Of course, this is because of our relationship with Dongfang Yu. Otherwise, I am afraid that Boss Yin would not help us.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Oh? What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang asked quickly.

“Well, maybe you don’t know, but that Dongfang Yu is the sworn enemy of Boss Yin. They both also fought each other once. I quickly came to ask for her help after hearing that, and she agreed without any hesitation after knowing about the hatred between me and Dongfang Yu. As for you, Boss Yin would allow you to work with us because many people know that you were defeated by Dongfang Yu in only three strikes,” Ling Tianhao said.

“Is there any animosity between you and Dongfang Yu?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ling Tianhao.

“It’s just a trivial matter, but I just really don’t like Dongfang Yu,” Ling Tianhao said.

Jian Wushuang was doubtful and asked, “Is Boss Yin’s strength very powerful?”

“Of course, she would not even lose a fight with Dongfang Yu. She is the strongest, aside from Dongfang Yu, among all the people who accepted the task for One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard,” Ling Tianhao said.

“Is that true? It seems that we have found a good backer.” Jian Wushuang smiled mysteriously and showed his interest.

At that moment, the grey-robed elder in front of the counter, Mr. Huo, came out.

“Time’s up. Now follow me, everyone,” Mr. Huo said, leading everyone directly out of the city.

After they were out of Qingdong City, Mr. Huo continued to lead everyone, walking in one direction for most of the day without stopping.

“Mouse, since you have accepted the task for One-clawed Golden Dragon Guard twice, do you know where he is leading us to?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know.” Ling Tianhao shook his head, then continued speaking, “The task from the Golden Dragon Palace is different every time. Only after we arrive at the designated place will we be informed of what the task is. So, we have no choice but to follow him now.”

“What were your previous two tasks?” Jian Wushuang continued his questioning.

“I’m sorry. I can’t tell you about the previous tasks,” Ling Tianhao said.

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“Because that is the rule of Golden Dragon Palace. Any task from the Golden Dragon Palace is prohibited from being leaked out, and anyone who is found leaking it would likely be executed immediately.” Ling Tianhao said seriously, “But I can tell you that those two tasks were extremely dangerous. It was only with good luck that I was able to survive because most of the people were dead by the time the tasks were completed.”

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang wore a serious expression.

They continued walking for two hours before they arrived at a big valley, where Mr. Huo stopped.

“Have we arrived?” Jian Wushuang and the others looked around, but all they could see was the vast landscape surrounding them and the huge valley. They could not clearly see what was in the valley.

“Mr. Huo, you are really slow.”

A cold voice was heard as a lofty shadow appeared in front of them.

It came from a middle-aged man who had a long red robe and a cold expression. His eyebrows were able to display majesty without losing his temperament. While holding his hands behind his back, he looked over at everyone present with profound eyes.

Everything and everyone fell into complete silence when that man appeared.

Jian Wushuang, Dongfang Yu, Yin Min, and everyone else who had accepted the One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard task opened their eyes wide, looking at the man in great shock. Not because of how powerful and awesome his aura was, but because the man was floating in front of them.

Yes, floating. Floating in the air!

“Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“It’s a supreme expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“A legendary existence!”

All the people intently stared at him as he walked through the air. It was evident that the man was a supreme expert who had entered the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

“The Yin-Yang Void Realm?” Jian Wushuang pressed his hands tightly together as his eyes shined brilliantly.

The Yin-Yang Void Realm had always been a legend. There were not many experts like him, and it was the first time for Jian Wushuang to see an expert at this level.

“Golden Dragon Ambassador.”

Even the enigmatic Mr. Huo showed respect to the man and kept a low profile.

“Since you are finally here, we can start working,” the man standing in the air said in a low voice.

“As you wish, Sir.” Mr. Huo nodded continuously.

Upon hearing this, the old man turned around and suddenly disappeared from everyone’s sight.

“What speed is that?”

All these people who had not even reached the Primordial Gold Core Realm were stunned when they saw this scene.

“So fast! Although I am also very fast due to my understanding of the Sword Essence of Gale, I am just like a snail compared to this Golden Dragon Ambassador,”Wushuang thought.

A few loud voices came out from the vast valley as soon as the Golden Dragon Ambassador disappeared.

“Who is that?”

“This is the land of our Tianhuan Sect. Who are you? You should leave now!”

“Which Expert has come to our Tianhuan Sect?”

The vast valley was the base of the Sect. When the Golden Dragon Ambassador was seen intruding into it, a loud warning came out from the valley. But after the expert in that Sect learned that the man was a Yin-Yang Void Realm expert who could Voidwalk, his tone became very respectful.

At this time, a deafening sound was heard in that vast valley.

“Tianhuan Sect? How dare you plot against the Golden Dragon Ambassador from our Golden Dragon Palace. Today is the end of your Tianhuan Sect!”
