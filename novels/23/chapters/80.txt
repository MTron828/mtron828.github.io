Chapter 81: Mission Assigned

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Ranked the 100th on the Earthly Dragon List, Fire Fairy was a solo powerhouse who had achieved the peak of Fulfillment Realm of Jindan. She is eccentric and has many enemies. She also excels at marksmanship and has a comprehension of Raging Fire.

“A half year ago, by herself, she killed five opponents who had achieved the Exceptional Gold Core Realm at Sunset Ridge over the body of a Spiritual Beast. Two months ago, she beat Mount, the former 100th expert on the List, and replaced him.”

“The 99th on the list is Luo Ao…”

Jian Wushuang carefully read the introductions and combat abilities of every expert.

“The person who was 94th on the list was surprisingly the Tyrant Su Lie.”

“Su Lie.” Jian Wushuang said with surprise.

Yang Zaixuan, Wang Yuan and Su Rou beside him came closer.

“Su Lie, a bad-tempered disciple of Dragon Palace, was known for his aggression and excellence at Exceptional Gold Core Realm, Raging Fire and brutal Fist Position.”

“He once fought against 13 Gold Core warriors among which 8 achieved the Exceptional Gold Core Realm and killed 11 of them including 7 of the 8. Two survived and he only had a minor injury….”

What Jian Wushuang saw really shocked him.

Su Lie by himself could unexpectedly kill 11 of the 13 Primordial Gold Core with only two surviving and escaping. It was no wonder that there was a saying that any powerhouse on the list is able to beat a large group of people of Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

“Su Lie is really tough,” said Yang Zaixuan seriously.

“It made sense that Bai Cheng dare not fight him,” said Wang Yuan.

Jian Wushuang kept reading.

The list revealed all the names of powerhouses and their achievements. Jian Wushuang soon read the top five.

“The person who ranked the fifth was Barbarian King Qing Cang, a disciple of Dragon Palace, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!”

“The fourth was Feng Yutian, who belonged to Gladiator arena, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!”

“The third was Mu Yingying, a member of the Mu clan, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!”

“The second was Bai Lichen, a disciple of Dragon Palace, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!”

“The first was Xue Yun from Blood Feather Tower who achieved the Profound Gold Core Realm!”

“Xue Yun from Blood Feather Tower,” said Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

“How could Xue Yun rank first on the list by merely achieving the Profound Gold Core Realm.” Yang Zaixuan and other people wondered.

“Check his combat achievements.”

Jian Wushuang also saw his achievements.

The list read, “a year ago, Bai Lichen, the second on the list, and Barbarian King Qing Cang, the fifth, joined hands to fight Xue Yun outside the imperial palace and this only ended in a draw.”

The description of this was simple but shocked all of them,

because the top five on the list could even contend against Yin-Yang Void Realm and yet the two of them against him could only end in a draw.

Meanwhile Xue Yun had merely achieved Profound Gold Core Realm.

“I now understand why Dragon Palace is reputed as the Cultivation Sanctuary,” said Yang Zaixuan suddenly.

“Exactly,” nodded Jian Wushuang. 16 of 100 Primordial Gold Core on Earthly Dragon List were Disciples of Dragon Palace and there were even 3 in the top 10.

Jian Wushuang could not help but admire how outstanding Dragon Palace was.

Among 100 people on the list, there were 16 of Disciples of Dragon Palace, 9 from Gladiator arena and 3 from Blood Feather Tower.

Although there were 3 people from Blood Feather Tower on the list, this did not mean that these experts were inferior to those from Gladiator arena. As the tower was an assassins organization, members in it seldom exposed their true abilities and nobody knew if they were able to be placed on the list.

Apart from the Three Hegemons, the seven ancient clans of Tianzong Dynasty were home to various talents and more than 10 of them were named on the list.

There were also many solitary experts.

Among 100 experts on the list were nearly 40 solitary experts.

“I have never seen any disciple of Dragon Palace named on the list with the exception of Su Lie.” said Jian Wushuang.

“Me neither.” said Wang Yuan.

“As those disciples left the palace long time ago, it is rare to meet them. The palace, however, held regular annual meetings, during which many strong disciples on or off the list would be back.” said Su Rou.

“Really?” asked Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Right about that time, whoosh, a person in a white robe appeared in the manor.

Jian Wushuang and his companions hurried to stand up.

“Palace Master White!”

The four people gave a salute to him.

“Swordsman and Yang Zaixuan, an expert in the world could only emerge from countless trials and tribulations. As we know this, we assign missions to our disciples at intervals to train them.” said Palace Master White with his hands behind his back.

“You two have been here for 3 months and it is time to receive your first mission.”

Saying that, the master produced two beams of light with his hands.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan took them and saw three minor scrolls.

“As you two are at different stages–one in the Spiritual Sea Realm and the other at Primordial Gold Core, I have assigned you two different missions. But both of your missions have three stages which are already on your scrolls. You’d only see the next one after completing the former one.” the Master said.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang directly opened up the first scroll.

“My first objective is to become a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard by finishing the guard mission.”

“Perform it in the Innumerable Huge Mountains.”

“The reward for completion of the task was to get two thousand points.”

Jian Wushuang’s complexion immediately turned strange as soon as he saw the introduction of the task,

as there were many Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard tasks including those of any Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace of Tianzong Dynasty, but the Master appointed me to complete the mission in the Innumerable Huge Mountains…”

After that, Jian Wushuang came to understand that his second and third assignments were likely to be finished in the Mountains.

“Tasks are now assigned and you may set off as soon as possible. You can only return to the palace after completion of the assignments.”

said the master with a light smile and left.
