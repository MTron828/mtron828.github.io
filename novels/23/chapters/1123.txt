Chapter 1124: Heaven Shadow King

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Universe Master… was a level above both Dao Master and Celestial Master.

Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, and Tang Emperor were all at this level.

Heaven Shadow King in front of them was a very Universe Master.

“Jian Wushuang, your defense ability is incomparably good, few Celestial Masters are able to kill you. However, a Celestial Master can’t compare with a Universe Master. You should be careful.” Gu King said solemnly.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang looked grave, and with a flick of the wrist, he was holding a drop of golden water in his hand, ready to escape at any time.

Wearing a black robe, with a lean face and a pair of eagle-like eyes, Heaven Shadow King appeared in the Jin Kingdom camp. He glanced at the Celestial Master Jin Yi and asked, “How’s everything going?”

“My lord, everything has been going smooth, but because of Jian Wushuang, we lost a lot, and acquired only two Nirvana Elixirs. He alone got three Elixirs.” Celestial Master Jin Yi said coldly.

“Oh?” Heaven Shadow King squinted, but at the next moment, he fixed his vicious eyes upon Jian Wushuang.

“An Eternal Realm? You’re Jian Wushuang, right?” Heaven Shadow King was sneering coolly. “I heard that you’ve got three Nirvana Elixirs?”

“Yes, I do.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Hand over the three Nirvana Elixirs, and I will spare you.” Heaven Shadow King sounded indifferent.

“Hand over the elixirs, and you spare me? You wish!” Jian Wushuang snorted.

“You don’t? Then prepare to die.” Heaven Shadow King still sounded indifferent. As he finished his threats, his swung his giant hand.

With the twist of his hand, immediately, a long black whip rushed out lightning fast like a giant python!

“Be careful!”

“Jian Wushuang, run!”

The Green Fire Palace experts roared.

When Jian Wushuang saw Heaven Shadow King waved, he immediately consumed the golden drop of water in his hand to make his aura soar. He waved the long sword and released his mighty power. He was ready to go to any length to fend off the long black whip.

But the black long whip was weirdly flexible, it directly bypassed Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship, and slammed onto him hard like a soaring dragon.

“This whip…”

There was a trace of horror in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He had done his best, but his swordsmanship’s speed fell short of the dark and long whip’s. Now he could only watch the black and long whip slamming on him.

Snap!

A crisp sound rang, faintly accompanied by cracklings of bones.

Jian Wushuang directly spat a large mouthful of blood and grew pale. He was slammed into beneath the ground, but at the next moment, he rose up again. And this time he did not hesitate to escape.

“He didn’t die? Is it because of the Ancient God Power?” Heaven Shadow King looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

He just saw that Jian Wushuang had absorbed the Ancient God Power.

Absorbing the Ancient God Power could make people’s strength soar in a short period of time, not only in the attacking power but also in one’s defensive ability.

Heaven Shadow King was quite confident in his own strength. Although he did not display an all-out attack, he believed it was enough to end a Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm. Now that Jian Wushuang survived, he could only blame it on the Ancient God Power.

“It’ll just take a little more effort.”

Looking at the escaping Jian Wushuang, Heaven Shadow King stayed indifferent and then vanished into black smoke.

“It’s too strong, a Universe Master is too strong!”

As Jian Wushuang escaped, he looked terrified.

At the moment Heaven Shadow King acted, he absorbed the Ancient God Power to improve his attack power and defensive ability. However, he was still seriously injured.

One must know that his defensive ability was extremely good. Celestial Master Jin Yi had displayed an all-out assault, and Jian Wushuang stayed unharmed.

“Jian Wushuang, I will heal you as soon as possible. Your combat power won’t be influenced for now. But you must not let Heaven Shadow King catch up with you, otherwise, such an attack… A whip can’t kill you, but a few more whips will definitely crumble you.” Gu King warned solemnly.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily. As he was escaping, he looked back to check.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang’s countenance changed because he saw that Heaven Shadow King was constantly approaching him. Heaven Shadow King was much faster than him.

“How can it be?”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

You must know that at this moment, he had already tried his best to display the second Dragon Blood Secret Skill. The spiritual power in his body was burning wildly, and his speed had skyrocketed by a hundred times. However, he still failed to get rid of Heaven Shadow King? And they were getting closer and closer?

“Damn, Heaven Shadow King must be very fast. An ordinary Universe Master will never be fast like this.” Gu King guessed.

He was right. Among the nine kings of Jin Kingdom, Heaven Shadow King was much faster than the ordinary ones.

Even though Jian Wushuang burnt immense Spiritual Power to display Dragon Blood Secret Skill, he still failed to escape Heaven Shadow King’s long whip.

“Jian Wushuang, you have to die!”

Heaven Shadow King’s eyes were cold, and then, he immediately appeared behind Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he whipped the giant python-like black whip.

It was still so weird that Jian Wushuang could not ward it off.

The dark long whip once again slammed on Jian Wushuang, this time, Heaven Shadow King did not hold back his strength.

Snap! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

With a crisp sound, Jian Wushuang felt a burning pain on his back. His internal organs and bones were being squeezed as if they were going to explode. He was spitting blood again.

“Is this whip even stronger than before?”?Jian Wushuang’s expression change dramatically. “I can’t stand another whip, I can only take one last strike!”

However, when Heaven Shadow King found Jian Wushuang was still alive, his face fell.

He was a Universal Master and actually personally dealt with Jian Wushuang who was in Eternal Realm. He had confronted the latter two times, and still failed to kill Jian Wushuang? He found it embarrassing.

No matter what, the third whip must kill Jian Wushuang!
