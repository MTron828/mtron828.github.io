4832 Head Held High

That stout Yan Immortal was obviously one of the 17 Mountain Lords. His small eyes were constantly looking at the clothes on his body, and from there, he said what he had just said.

The clothes that Wei Liujia was wearing at the moment were also given to him by Jian Wushuang.

The tunic was given to Jian Wushuang by the Young Emperor, Prince Yan, earlier on. Every single thread had taken the effort of countless embroiderers. It was a rare treasure, and he had given it to Wei Liujia.

The stout Yan Immortal could also see the extraordinary clothes on his body, his eyes rolled. “Eh, Brother Wei, where is the True Sword that you always carry around? Don’t tell me you sold it to buy this outfit?”

As his voice fell, the remaining 10 or so luxurious figures roared with laughter, making the hall extremely lively.

Wei Liujia’s face flushed red, and he was about to rush forward to argue.

However, Jian Wushuang, who was beside him, pulled him back and said in an undetectable voice, “Why would you want to argue with a barking dog?”

“Kid, what did you say?!”

Jian Wushuang did not hide his voice, so the Yan Immortal could hear him clearly. The Yan Immortal’s expression changed.

Wei Liujia felt an inexplicable peace of mind, and his mentality had also changed without him realizing it. Facing the incoming stout Yan Immortal, he fearlessly faced him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Wei Liujia, get lost! I’m going to destroy that Kid’s Life Source!” the stout Yan Immortal said angrily.

When Wei Liujia heard this, the corners of his lips slowly curled up. “Ding Chunshan, have I always been too kind, allowing you to ride on my head and sh*t all the time? Don’t forget that I’m also a Mountain Lord!”

The stout Yan Immortal was stunned, looking at Wei Liujia in disbelief.

The area outside the Heavenly Palace fell silent.

“What a Mountain Lord,” Yan Immortal sneered. “Are you going to make a great contribution to the entire Great Mi Heaven? I’m afraid you can’t even afford the court tributes. Isn’t it because of your father that you got your position?”

“Why do you care how many contributions I’ve made? Even if I lie down and sleep every day, I’m still the Mountain Lord,” Wei Liujia sneered as well. “How about we make a bet? I’ll win the court tribute this time. How about you take off my shoes and massage my legs?”

“As long as you can beat me, I’ll even lick your shoes, let alone rub your legs!” the stout Yan Immortal said coldly. “If you’re not as good as me, then you’ll automatically remove yourself from the position of Mountain Lord and run three laps around the Heavenly Palace naked. What do you think?”

“I’ll agree to that.” Wei Liujia gave him a sidelong glance before turning around and striding into the Heavenly Palace.

Having suffered such a loss, Yan Immortal, who knew that he had lost face, wanted to swallow him alive.

“Wei Liujia, just you wait!”

In the vast scaling ladder, Wei Liujia’s face was flushed with excitement. “Damn it, I’ve never felt so good before. I’ve returned all the humiliation I’ve suffered in the past. I didn’t know it was so satisfying!”

After he finished speaking, he looked at Jian Wushuang and said sincerely, “It’s all thanks to you that I can hold my head high today. I thank you.”

Jian Wushuang smiled, “Actually, even without the foundation I gave you, you can still hold your head high.”

“You’ve always been stuck in your own opinion. You don’t know that to deal with that kind of person, you have to return the favor ruthlessly.”

“Destroying him physically is far inferior to destroying him mentally and physically.” After Jian Wushuang said this calmly, he did not speak again.

Wei Liujia was also mulling over the meaning of his words, and for a moment, he was even more in awe of him.

There were 9990 steps on the steps, and the magnificent gate of the Heavenly Palace only appeared when he stepped on the last step.

The Heavenly Palace that Prince Jiu was in was grand and magnificent, filled with a sense of majesty. Compared to the palace in the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture of the late Prince Mo, it was less mysterious and ingenious, and more majestic.

This made Jian Wushuang feel that Prince Jiu was the real Young Emperor.

After the Heavenly Court’s grand banquet, the Prince had set up the rules for the opening of the court offering every one Hua Year. It was meant to firmly rope in the Mountain Lords of Great Mi Heaven and the Lords of the Blessed Landss to prevent disloyalty.

The door of the Heavenly Palace had been opened for a long time, and a fragrant scent drifted out of the palace, calming the mind of those who smelled it.

A peak cultivator guard walked out of the hall and led them in.

In order to show off their appearance and style, every Mountain Lord who came to the Heavenly Palace was followed by five or six top cultivation subordinates. Each of them was hugging a huge box, which was obviously a gift from the court.

This was especially so for the stout Yan immortal who was confronting Wei Liujia outside the Heavenly Palace. He was followed by eight top cultivation subordinates, and there were no less than twenty boxes in his arms.

Wei Liujia, on the other hand, was very straightforward. He took his seat with a palm-sized Supreme Jade Tree Glazed Tile in his hand.

This scene was taken in by the stout Yan Immortal and he almost laughed out loud. He had read countless treasures and naturally could see that the Supreme Jade Tree Glazed Tile in Wei Liujia’s hand was not even as good as the clothes he was wearing.

“I’d like to see how you’re going to compete with me. Just wait for your butt to be naked and run three laps around the palace!” the stout Yan Immortal glared at him and sat down.

Long before the Mountain Lords entered the hall, Jian Wushuang had already noticed that there were six Elders sitting at the lower end of the throne. They were all peak Yan Immortals with rather mature looks and should be the Lords of the Blessed Land.

Sitting beside Wei Liujia, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were fixed on the empty throne.

He was hoping, hoping that the figure with the Heaven-patterned Bone Armor would appear in the next moment.

“My Lord, are you waiting for the Second Prince to appear?” Seeing the fluctuation in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, Wei Liujia lowered his voice and said. “The Second Prince will only move from the Immortal Platform to the Heavenly Palace after the morning bell rings three times.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and waited with great concentration.

When the sound of the bell, which seemed to have come from an ancient distance, reverberated, the entire Heavenly Palace fell silent in an instant. All the Mountain Lords sat upright and still. Even the Lords of the Blessed Lands, who had closed their eyes to rest, opened their eyes.

Outside the hall, there were the cries of Immortal cranes and at the same time, thousands of Immortal clouds rose.

Under the guidance of hundreds of cranes, a figure dressed in the son of the Emperor’s court uniform slowly walked into the Heavenly Palace with his hands behind his back.

At this moment, the 17 Mountain Lords , the 6 Lords of the Blessed Lands, many Yan immortals and top level cultivators all cupped their hands and said, “Your humble servant greets the Second Prince!”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at his back. Compared to the grand banquet in the Heavenly Court a few years ago, Prince Jiu had a more subtle calmness. It was as if he knew everything in his heart. He gave off a feeling that he was as calm as water.

This was a very strong opponent, and you would never be able to guess his thoughts.

Up until now, Jian Wushuang still did not think that what he had seen in the fight for the Peach was Prince Jiu’s true strength.
