Chapter 46: Dongfang Yu

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Fight with you?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and felt a little worried.

Sima Bu said in a low voice, “Zhu Tao has a history with me and holds a grudge. His strength is not as good as mine, so he does not dare to come to me in person, only sending his disciple to make trouble for you. Just ignore him. ”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang knew the reason. While glancing at Dongfang Yu, he shook his head and said, “Sorry, I’m not interested.”

“How come? Could it be said that the person Mr. Bu brought here is a coward?” Dongfang Yu said with a cold smile and a loud voice, attracting the attention of the Gold-dragon Guards in the loft.

The Gold-dragon Guards looked in their direction and immediately revealed a look of interest.

As so many people stared at Jian Wushuang suddenly, he pressed down his conical straw hat with a grim face.

“Zhu Tao, what do you mean by this?” Sima Bu shouted with a cold voice.

“Nothing. I just did not expect that the person Mr. Bu brought here was so arrogant. Whatever the outcome is, we are going to complete the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard together three days from now. He is too supercilious to even greet me,” replied Zhu Tao, with a sneer.

“Well, do you mean that no matter who challenge us, we must take it? In that case, I challenge you now. I wonder if you have the courage to fight with me?” Sima Bu said with a deep voice.

“Ha-ha, Mr. Bu is making a fun of me. Everyone knows your strength. I dare not fight with you,” Zhu Tao said casually.

Joking? Sima Bu comprehended a glimmer of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire. He was even a Three-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard and he was at the peak of the Primordial Gold Core Realm. Sima Bu was obviously much stronger than Zhu Tao.

“Swordsman, will you always hide behind Mr. Bu? Being such a coward, what qualification do you have to complete the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard?” Dongfang Yu said with a sneering smile.

“You’re right.” Jian Wushuang suddenly looked up with a slight smile. “If it is just a greeting, I have no reason to refuse. Please.”

“Jian Wushuang.” Sima Bu looked over in surprise.

“Don’t worry. I know what to do,” Jian Wushuang said with a quieter voice.

Jian Wushuang accepted the challenge and it was decided the fighting area would just be the open space of the central hall.

In the area with a coverage of dozens of square meters, stood Jian Wushuang and Dongfang Yu, with a large number of Gold-dragon Guards nearby, happily watching.

While standing there, with a long black stick in his hand, Dongfang Yu exuded a soaring aura.

“Long Staff?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed as he drew the Triple-kill Sword.

“Boy, be careful.” Dongfang Yu smiled, followed by a quick move, then he instantly rushed over. At this moment, the long stick in his hands turned into a shinning black light.

“So slow.”

Jian Wushuang saw Dongfang Yu rushing straight over, but he didn’t take it seriously.

In fact, Dongfang Yu’s burst of speed from the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm was very fast, but compared with Jian Wushuang who comprehended a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, it was indeed a bit too slow.

Though it was slow, the power was not weak.

“I’ll use him to put on a good show.” Jian Wushuang faintly smiled and suddenly swung the Triple-kill Sword, releasing a whistling sword light that divided the air.

Clang!

The Triple-kill Sword directly collided with that shinning black light, making a low-pitched percussion sound. And then the dark light turned into a huge snake, twisting in the air before instantly changing back into the form of a stick, aiming to hit him.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang seemed to panic as he hurriedly waved the sword to block. But he was still hit by the stick, causing his body and knees to bow. What’s more, the serpent form lengthened unexpectedly, as if a large fierce-looking mouth was ferociously opening to bite Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang placed the Triple-kill Sword horizontally across his chest with great effort.

Peng!

A low noise was heard as Jian Wushuang was knocked back, retreating directly to the edge of the open space to keep his balance. Moreover, a trace of blood spilled from his mouth at this moment.

“What a piece of trash you are!”

Dongfang Yu placed the stick upright and said with an indifferent look, “You can’t even take three attacks from my stick, yet you want to complete the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard. Ridiculous!

After he finished talking, Dongfang Yu did not bother to glance at Jian Wushuang. Instead, he went toward his Great Master, Zhu Tao, both looking at each other with a subtle smile.

“Zhu Tao, your disciple is really good!”

“His stick technique is very strong. Besides, his cultivation has also reached the peak of the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm. Also, his Cultivation Method seems unusual and his release of Spiritual Power was obviously much stronger than the average warrior in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.

“Where did you find such a good disciple?”

Gold-dragon Guards acquainted with Zhu Tao were talking with their sights focused on him and Dongfang Yu, but no one even glanced at Jian Wushuang.

After all, in this world, the strong will always be honored. Since Jian Wushuang was defeated and could not even ward off three strokes, naturally he could not attract the attention of these Gold-dragon Guards.

“Ha-ha. I’m telling you guys the truth, my disciple is the son of my old friend, and he indeed has a bit of talent. I would like to seize the opportunity to send him to Dragon Palace, but no one recommended him,” Zhu Tao said with a laugh.

“Dragon Palace?”

“You Intend to send him to Dragon Palace, but no one will recommend him?”

“Ha-ha. Zhu Tao, your disciple is really good!”

The Gold-dragon Palace was very noisy because many of the Gold-dragon Guards were talking about topics related to “Dragon Palace”.

Jian Wushuang, whom no one noticed, left the crowd’s attention quietly, coming to Sima Bu.

Sima Bu, who was drinking alone by the table, threw the wine pot to Jian Wushuang when he saw him coming over.

“Take a sip,” Sima Bu said.

Jian Wushuang caught the wine flask and took a drink without hesitation. He had learned to drink from Sima Bu in the Dark Forest during the last four months. Now, when drinking, he felt comfortable tasting the tangy and piquant flavor.

“Refreshing,” Jian Wushuang could not help commenting.

“You could have beaten him head-on, so why lose deliberately?” Sima Bu laughed with a lowered voice.

Though others did not know the strength of Jian Wushuang, Sima Bu was fully aware of it. Apparently, Jian Wushuang lost the fight on purpose.

“This is, after all, a branch palace of the Gold-dragon Palace. The more people, the more interference. Hence, there may be some spies from Blood Feather Tower. I have to keep a low-profile. As it is now, everyone will focus their attention on Dongfang Yu, so no one will pay attention to me. Isn’t that good?” Jian Wushuang said and laughed.

“Ha-ha, I understand your intention. But, don’t you feel embarrassed being defeated by Dongfang Yu in front of so many people, with only three strokes?” Sima Bu asked again.

“Compared with my life, losing face is of little significance!” Jian Wushuang said, grinning and continuing to drink with his head raised.
