Chapter 2516: Making a Deal

A terrifying momentum swept over with a huge bang as Xiao Tiexin lowered her body while feeling a little stunned.

The Governor of Demonic Moon Prefecture took another step forward before turning the stone staff in his hand into a thunderbolt and lashed out.

The purple light gushed out of Xiao Tiexin’s body as her bewitching purple sickle drew an arch before she dashed forward.

Twang!

After another collision, her purple sickle’s momentum was knocked away from its original direction, causing both her hands to suddenly feel numb while the insides of her body were throbbing.

“Haha, go to hell!”

The Governor laughed as he sent his stone staff forward which penetrated a hole in the void before continuing to pierce toward Xiao Tiexin.

“No!” Xiao Tiexin panicked.

She still felt numbness in her hand and was not able to defend against the incoming attack. In the nick of time, a strange flash of light shone before her eyes.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three light beams appeared out of the blue at the void she was in and Xiao Tiexin retreated to the one side of the void with a flash.

She dodged the staff attack, but its momentum had not vanished. On the contrary, it turned into a bright red light beam which continued on with its attack. Coincidentally, Jian Wushuang was located not far behind Xiao Tiexin. She may have avoided that attack, but not Jian Wushuang.

“Ah...” Xiao Tiexin was shocked but could not do anything.

In such situations, she could not even guarantee her own safety let alone the safety of Jian Wushuang.

Boom!!!

Violent energies burst outwards from the void where Jian Wushuang was.

The void fell into a humongous storm of energy with nobody being able to see what had happened inside it.

“A secret technique?”

The Governor looked at Xiao Tiexin with his face blooming in a grin. “So it’s true that you did not only bring six thousand pieces of Primordial Stones from the Xiao clan. The secret technique which you used to dodge my attack is probably a lot more valuable than the six thousand Primordial Stones!”

Xiao Tiexin looked at him coldly without uttering a word.

“Eldest Miss Xiao, I have a suggestion. Why don’t you come to Demonic Moon Prefecture and become my wife and teach me all the secret techniques you know in one go? What do you say?” The Governor sneered.

However, as soon as he finished speaking...

“Phew, that was close! My double-horned Thunderous Star Beast which costs ten thousand drops of Ancient God Divine Power almost died.” A light voice suddenly spoke from afar.

On the battlefield, the experts from both the Demonic Moon Prefecture and Xueya Escort Team were caught by surprise.

All their eyes immediately moved over to the side void and looked at the energy storm.

The Governor and Xiao Tiexin both looked over as well.

The energy storm began to gradually die down and unveiled its insides.

They saw a three-meter tall double-horned Thunderous Star Beast standing trembling there. On its back was a golden-robed man sitting cross-legged and carrying a long sword behind.

It was clear the Governor’s staff energy had exploded in that part of the void, but how did both the beast and golden-robed man escape unscattered under such immense energies?

“He’s actually still alive?”

Xiao Tiexin and her men were shocked.

That powerful staff strike required Xiao Tiexin to dodge with a secret technique. Otherwise, a low-level Ultimate God could only greet death when facing it head-on.

However, not only did the golden-robed man before their eyes survived, so did his double-horned Thunderous Star Beast.

Jian Wushuang looked at the beast he was riding on under everyone’s stare and said, “Little Ray, don’t be scared. Come, let’s get over there.”

‘Little Ray’ was a pet name Jian Wushuang gave to his double-horned Thunderous Star Beast.

However, Little Ray did not even move a hair no matter how much motivation he directed toward the beast. It was already frightened to near death.

Jian Wushuang could do nothing but got down from its back and walked on his own.

The Governor closely stared at Jian Wushuang and slowly squinted his eyes at the same time. “Looks like our intelligence has made some mistakes. There’s an expert among those being escorted.”

Previously, he did not notice Jian Wushuang at all, but now... As Jian Wushuang slowly closed in, he realized he could not see through Jian Wushuang’s true abilities and cultivation level which started to make him slightly alarmed.

He was a High-Level Ultimate God after all. If an Ultimate God could not see through his opponent, it was either an opponent at the same cultivation level or a Low-Level Ultimate God good at hiding his aura.

He was most probably an expert regardless which was true. Otherwise, it would not be possible for him to safely survive his staff strike.

Jian Wushuang finally arrived at the battlefield’s center and stood next to Xiao Tiexin.

Xiao Tiexin and her men were a little surprised.

Jian Wushuang was a client who hired their escort team to protect himself and had been traveling with them for more than four months. Although Jian Wushuang’s aura felt a little strange to them with nobody able to see through him, they had never taken note of him let alone suspected that he was a hidden expert.

The reason for their point of view was that, would it not be pointless for him to hire them for protection if he was that powerful?

Why would he need to pay them escorting fees? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Any escort team would love to have an expert at the level of Ultimate God or above among them.

However, to be able to survive the staff strike and remain unscathed probably meant the golden-robed man’s abilities were quite high.

“Xiao Tiexin, Oh great Captain Xiao.” Jian Wushuang smiled mysteriously at Xiao Tiexin next to him. “What if we make a deal?”

Xiao Tiexin was surprised. “A deal? What kind of a deal?”

“It’s very simple, I’ll get rid of these people from Demonic Moon Prefecture, but you’ll have to be honest with me when I ask you a question later,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Sure.” Xiao Tiexin agreed without hesitation.

If it was only one question. It should not be anything serious, at the very least not comparable with everyone’s lives.

However, the bigger question was whether this unknown man who traveled with them would really be able to get rid of the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s people?

The Xueya Escort Team including Xiao Tiexin herself felt slightly doubtful.

However, Jian Wushuang did not care much and turned his gaze toward those people from Demonic Moon Prefecture.

“Demonic Moon Prefecture, yes? Do you want to leave on your own or do you want me to kick you home?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly with his absolutely confident tone.

They could not tell what Jian Wushuang was up to, hence nobody dared to move. They looked at the Governor instead.

The Governor’s face turned a little gloomy before saying, “Sir, perhaps you’re being too arrogant if you think you could convince us to leave with just a few words.”

“Well, there’s no other way but to fight in that case.” Jian Wushuang smiled while his divine powers began to surge.

His aura was naturally in full display as soon as he activated his divine powers.

Everyone on the battlefield was instantly shocked!
