4184 One Against a Hundred (Part 2)

In the surrounding void.

Divine Marquis Qingfeng, Ruler Spear River, and the other Omega Rulers all stared at the scene in front of them in shock.

“I…what did i just see? A single fourth-stage chief Ruler is suppressing a group of ultimate chief Rulers?”

“This…isn’t this a little too fierce?”

!!

“My God, what kind of terrifying battle strength is this? I’ve never heard of anyone in the entire universe who can suppress a group of Ultimate Rulers as a fourth-stage great Ruler!”

“Heaven-defying! His combat strength is simply heaven-defying.”

Divine Marquis Qingfeng and the others rubbed their eyes and gulped in disbelief.

Originally, when they saw the sudden appearance of nearly a hundred Ultimate Rulers, they had been in despair and had almost given up.

However, Jian Wushuang’s attack instantly caused a storm in their hearts!

Jian Wushuang was like a peerless sword God who had descended to the world. With an invincible posture, he had destroyed nearly a hundred Ultimate Rulers!

“Divine Marquis, we…should we go up and help Jian Wushuang?” An Ultimate Ruler swallowed and whispered.

“Do you think he needs to?” Divine Marquis Qingfeng shook his head with a bitter smile. “All we need to do is keep an eye on our surroundings and make sure the Omega Rulers don’t escape.”

After saying that, he raised his head again and looked at Jian Wushuang, who was fighting against the hundred Ultimate Rulers. A complicated look flashed in his eyes.

When they first arrived at the Tarot Ruins, Divine Marquis Qingfeng had acted as a senior and guided Jian Wushuang. He knew that Jian Wushuang was strong, but he thought that Jian Wushuang’s strength came from his talent and potential, not his current strength.

Even after Jian Wushuang and Qing Xuzi were evenly matched, Divine Marquis Qingfeng did not think that Jian Wushuang’s strength had surpassed his.

But now, he had no choice but to admit that he…he was definitely not Jian Wushuang’s match!

He even thought that Jian Wushuang was already an invincible existence among the Ultimate Rulers in terms of power!

In the whole world, as long as the Supreme martial artist did not appear, only the Ninth Kalpa King could suppress Jian Wushuang.

“This is a shockingly talented demon.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng sighed.

He looked at Jian Wushuang with envy.

He was a veteran Ultimate Ruler who had cultivated for longer than the Ninth Kalpa King.

However, in terms of cultivation base, he was not even a match for the almost invincible existences among the Ultimate Rulers, let alone the Ninth Kalpa King.

Jian Wushuang will definitely become a top-notch giant arm in the universe in the future! Divine Marquis Qingfeng mumbled to himself, his tone confident.

…

On the other side, the battle was still ongoing.

“Satisfying!”

Jian Wushuang fought in the crowd. He activated the Dragon-destroying secret skill and activated the Wuqi Divine Sword to the extreme. No one could block his sword.

It had been a long time since Jian Wushuang had such an enjoyable battle. He felt so carefree that he could not help but laugh out loud.

The surrounding Ultimate Rulers, seeing this, could not help but feel terrified.

A monster!

This person was simply a monster. Whether it was his boundless and vigorous divine power or his comprehension of the principles of the universe, they had all reached a level that they could not reach!

Bang! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

With a loud explosion, the spear in the divine armor Guard’s hand was cut in half by Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword!

The divine armor guards were forced back 2000 feet by Jian Wushuang’s sword again. They were extremely frightened.

At that moment, his high-grade divine armor was on the verge of breaking and the vast divine power in his body was almost depleted. He knew that he was on the verge of collapse and he could not take another sword from Jian Wushuang.

How can a stage four great Ruler be so strong?!

The divine armor guard’s fighting spirit was replaced by fear. Jian Wushuang’s power had far exceeded his expectations. He could not help but think that even if his master, Lord Zhennan, came, he might not be able to defeat this fourth stage Ruler.

“The person I want to kill can’t escape.” Jian Wushuang looked at the divine armor guards. He took another step and rushed toward them.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this, the divine armor guards’ expressions changed drastically. They immediately turned to a burly man in an iron skirt and shouted, “Horned Flame! Don’t forget, we’re on the same side now. If I die, how good will you be?”

This muscular man was none other than the number one general under the Third Prince, Ruler Horned Flame!

Ruler Horned Flame’s expression wavered upon hearing this.

The divine armor guards were right. The moment the Third Prince agreed to work with the Ruler Silver Roc and the Lord Zhennan, they were already in the same boat. If the divine armor guards died, their camp would not have an easy time.

“They’re here!”

Ruler Horned Flame took a deep breath, and a determined look appeared in his eyes. He flipped his right hand over, and a massive black saber instantly appeared in it!

Chi!

The next moment, a terrifying flame shot out from the black blade, burning the air.

Then, divine power burst forth from the Ruler Horned Flame’s body. He took a step forward, roared, and jumped toward Jian Wushuang.

“Go to hell!”

The divine armor guards also performed a powerful secret skill that burned their divine power and blood essence. They changed their dejected state and stabbed at Jian Wushuang with their broken spears!

“What?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ruler Horned Flame and raised his eyebrows.

He could sense that this Ruler Horned Flame was far from ordinary.

“Now this is interesting.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. He unleashed his thirteen thousand five hundred times divine power and charged toward Ruler Horned Flame.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword collided with Ruler Horned Flame’s flaming divine saber.

A loud explosion rang out, and the shockwaves from their clash created a terrifying white wave of air that forced the surrounding Ultimate Rulers back several hundred yards.

Then, Jian Wushuang felt a burning force coming from the hilt of the flaming divine saber.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. This Ruler was much stronger than the divine armor guards. He was probably the strongest expert among the hundred Ultimate Rulers. Although he was not invincible among Rulers, he was at least very close to that level.

Then, he waved his hand and the heat was immediately suppressed.

Jian Wushuang was surprised, but he did not know how shocked Ruler Horned Flame, who had retreated three steps, was.

“What a terrifying power!”

Ruler Horned Flame lowered his head to look at the saber in his right hand, which was trembling from the numbness, and his heart filled with shock.

One should know that he was an Ultimate Ruler who had proven his Dao with his strength. His strength was enough to grab a hundred mountains and crush the Earth Star. However, he was forced to take three steps back by Jian Wushuang’s sword!
