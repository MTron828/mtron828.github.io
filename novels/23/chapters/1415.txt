Chapter 1416: The Four Hundredth Step

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“If I’m not mistaken, he should be here for the mind test, right?” Su Rou looked at Lei Chao.

The scariest mind test in God’s Test was aimed at the state of mind.

It was normal for geniuses like Jian Wushuang to come across a mind test in God’s Test.

“Guess as you wish,” Lei Chao didn’t answer directly.

On Mind Cliff, Jian Wushuang continued to proceed step by step. In the beginning, he was rather relaxed.

However, when he reached the three hundredth step, he slowed down in speed and he didn’t look as relaxed as before. There was a hidden misery in his facial expression.

“There are nine hundred and ninety-nine steps to the peak of the Mind Cliff and he already felt a slight pressure on the three hundredth step. The following steps will be an obstacle for him and it will train his state of mind,” Su Rou smiled and stole a glance at Lei Chao next to her. She said, “If there’s no accident, the young man will spend another few years around this range of steps. Lei Chao, do you want to stay here or leave?”

“I’ll wait for him here,” Lei Chao replied coldly.

“Up to you. I have business to take care of. I will not keep you company. Please do as you like.”

Su Rou turned around and left. Lei Chao was left alone as he waited in silence.

The time flew past…

Jian Wushuang had been on Mind Cliff all this while. With the aid of phantasmagoria on Mind Cliff, he continued to train his state of mind.

Then, he was standing on the third-hundred-and-thirty-first step when he suddenly opened his eyes. Then, he took a step forward and reached the third-hundred-and-thirty-first step.

“The third-hundred-and-thirty-second step. That’s impressive!”

There were a few disciples of Dark Phoenix Pavilion gathered around Mind Cliff. They were astonished by Jian Wushuang’s performance on Mind Cliff.

“I remembered when Senior Qiu Ling were challenging Mind Cliff back then, she only reached the third-hundred-and-twenty-eighth step.”

“Senior Qiu Ling, among the disciples of Dark Phoenix Pavilion, regardless of power or state of mind, she was the strongest. Plus, she had trained many times on Mind Cliff. But she only reached the third hundred and twenty eighth step. Her result can’t be compared favorably with Jian Wushuang’s, even though he is here for the first time.”

“Jian Wushuang is really terrifyingly powerful and his state of mind is even scarier!”

The disciples were amazed.

Stepping foot on the third hundred and thirty second step represented the fact that Jian Wushuang’s state of mind was strong.

One should know that even Universe Gods on the peak to the minority of Real Gods who weren’t strong in a state of mind might not even step foot on the third hundredth step.

Jian Wushuang was still continuing his journey up.

In the blink of an eye, five years passed.

On Mind Cliff, Jian Wushuang had already laid foot on the third hundred and eighty ninth step.

“The third hundred and eighty-ninth step, mm, no, the third hundred and ninetieth step.”

In the void next to Mind Cliff, Qiu Ling and Liu Shaer stood side by side. They could see Jian Wushuang stepping foot on the third hundred and ninetieth step of Mind Cliff clearly.

“Senior, it has been three hundred years since you were last on Mind Cliff. You should have improved tremendously for the past three hundred years. If you were to go on Mind Cliff again, would you be able to catch up with Jian Wushuang?” Liu Shaer looked at Qiu Ling and asked.

“No way,” Qiu Ling shook her head directly, “With my current power, I could only try to pass the three hundred and thirtieth step. Among Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, it is considered rather impressive. But Jian Wushuang… he is so much more outstanding than we are!”

“The three-hundred-and-ninetieth step! According to master, there are many Real Gods of Dark Phoenix Pavilion who stopped at the three-hundred-and-ninetieth step. In terms of state of mind, Jian Wushuang is no weaker than those Real Gods.”

“Monster. I wonder how he got his state of mind?” Liu Shaer sighed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“How?” Qiu Ling smiled faintly, “Repeated failure and lots of training!”

“Some geniuses are like that. The bigger the failure, the tougher the training, so they get to be even more brilliant. On the contrary, if a genius were to lack experience of failure and training, his gifted talent would be wasted. Jian Wushuang is that kind of genius.”

“If I guess correctly, he should have experienced countless obstacles since he started cultivation. The obstacles that he has been through are not something either of us could compare to.”

“He grew up through the obstacles and became who he is today. He is an impressive genius… I can’t be compared favorably with him!”

Qiu Ling was a true genius too and she was confident in her personal talent. She was not someone who would admit defeat easily.

Even when she had lost to Jian Wushuang previously, she never thought that she was weaker than Jian Wushuang but merely lacking time and chances.

But then, looking at Jian Wushuang’s performance on Mind Cliff, especially after Jian Wushuang had stepped foot on the three hundred and ninetieth step, she decided not to challenge Jian Wushuang anymore.

She knew clearly that Jian Wushuang didn’t get that strong out of nowhere.

“I heard from the Pavilion Tower that Jian Wushuang is going to stay in Dark Phoenix Tower for ten years. Five years have passed and he has stepped foot on the three hundred and ninetieth step. There are five years left. I wonder if he could step foot on the four hundredth step,” Liu Shaer said.

“The four hundredth step?” Qiu Ling’s pupils contracted, “I heard from Master that there are nine hundred and ninety-nine steps on Mind Cliff and the four hundredth step is a huge threshold. It isn’t that easy to pass. The Real Gods of Dark Phoenix Pavilion mostly stopped below four hundred steps. There is hardly anyone who has stepped foot on four hundred steps or above. If Jian Wushuang were to step foot on the four hundredth step within the remaining five years, it would be… really impressive!”

“I hope he doesn’t. Otherwise, our difference will be too vast,” Liu Shaer muttered.

“Let’s go.”

Qiu Ling and Liu Shaer left shortly afterwards.

Jian Wushuang who was by then on the three hundred and ninetieth step of Mind Cliff was suffering indefinitely in the dreamland.

As he reached the three hundred and ninetieth step, it was rather difficult for him to pass through even if it was his dreamland.

A month later, he finally stepped foot on the three hundred and ninety-first step. Three months later, he had gotten to the three hundred and ninety-second step.

The time continued to fly past.

Out of the ten years time, there was only one last year left and it passed in the blink of an eye. The second Inverse Cultivation Test was ascending in a month’s time.

Dark Phoenix Pavilion, in the void by Mind Cliff, Lei Chao had been guarding Mind Cliff for the past ten years. He had never once left.

“One last month left.”

Lei Chao was calculating the time quietly while his gaze was fixed on Jian Wushuang on Mind Cliff.

But then, on Mind Cliff, Jian Wushuang, who was stuck on the three hundred and ninety-ninth step for a year, suddenly took a leap and stepped onto the four hundredth step firmly.

As his foot touched the step, his figure shivered and his aura experienced a tremendous change.
