Chapter 2408: Tough

“Zhuo Bing, what are you doing here?” Tang Xiao said frostily.

“Oh nothing much, just passing by. You guys go ahead.” The green-armored lady, Zhuo Bing smiled mildly.

“Passing by?” Tang Xiao and Na Shiyu both frowned.

“Miss Zhuo Bing, could you please give us a hand? Narcissus Island will show gratitude handsomely afterward,” said Zhong Yi right after.

He did not have any friendship with Zhuo Bing and that could even be considered their first encounter. Furthermore, Narcissus Island and Ancient Star Temple usually did not have much interaction. However, they had no hatred for each other either, hence his desire to seek a helping hand from Zhuo Bing.

“I’m sorry, I have no intention to be mixed up in your issues.” Zhuo Bing rejected straight away.

Zhong Yi could not do anything after she said so.

On the other hand, Tang Xiao and Shiyu felt relieved.

Although Zhuo Bing’s group appeared unexpectedly, the outcome would still be the same as long as she did not take action.

However, right at that moment...

“Big Sister!”

A resonant voice suddenly filled the entire battlefield. Even Zhuo Bing, who was outside of the battlefield could hear it.

“Big Sister?” Zhuo Bing was slightly surprised and looked over to the source of the voice, spotting Jian Wushuang right away.

However, she did not look surprised when she saw him.

“Big Sister, it’s me. I’m Jian Wushuang,” said Jian Wushuang again.

Zhuo Bing’s expression finally changed when Jian Wushuang mentioned his own name. She looked surprised at him, “Jian Wushuang? You’re Little Brother?”

“Yes, yes. It’s me!” Jian Wushuang nodded nonstop, wearing a smile on his face.

He was born in the Zhuo Clan in his current life. His father, Zhuo Yunfeng had one daughter and two sons.

The eldest daughter was Zhuo Bing, the second was Zhuo Peng, and Jian Wushuang was the youngest child.

Over a hundred years ago, Jian Wushuang’s elder sister Zhuo Bing joined a certain sect and had been cultivating in the sect, hence she seldom returned to Anjiu Commandery.

Therefore, from the moment he was born into his current life, Jian Wushuang had never really met this Big Sister.

What he did not expect was he could actually meet his unknown Big Sister in the Saint’s Tomb!

After identifying Jian Wushuang, Zhuo Bing lifted her jesting spectator’s expression and replaced it with a frosty face.

“Take out your weapons and follow me!”

Zhuo Bing let out a low growl and a bright red staff appeared in her hands.

“Senior Sister Zhuo Bing, which side are we helping?” asked a Second-Class Divine Demon.

“Nonsense, of course we’re helping Narcissus Island.”

Zhuo Bing said coldly as her body had already charged forward in an instant.

In the blink of an eye, Zhuo Bing was already on the battlefield, arriving at the side of the strong blonde man who was just fighting with Jian Wushuang.

“Scram!”

Zhuo Bing’s shout resonated as her bright red staff viciously lashed out.

“What?”

The strong blonde man was startled but managed to react. His body once again glowed with surging golden electric currents and hacked forward with his thunderbolt-turned giant axe.

With a loud boom, the golden thunderbolt instantly fell apart. The strong blonde man’s giant axe flew out of his hands due to the impact.

Puke!

The strong blonde man threw up a big gulp of blood and flew out like a cannonball.

The sudden change of scenario brought the entire battlefield into a short momentary silence.

“Little Brother, are you hurt?” After fighting off the strong blonde man, Zhuo Bing’s figure blurred and appeared next to Jian Wushuang.

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Good then.” Zhuo Bing was relieved.

Everyone on the battlefield looked over at Zhuo Bing.

“Zhuo Bing, what do you think you’re doing?” Tang Xiao shouted in anger.

“Miss Zhuo Bing, I thought you said you wouldn’t join the fight?” Na Shiyu frowned as well.

The Narcissus Island disciples, however, all looked delighted.

“Hmph, you dare bully my younger blood brother and expect me not to get involved?” Zhuo Bing’s face turned very cold.

“Younger blood brother?”

Everybody was dumbfounded and looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was the Ice Queen’s younger brother?

They did not even share the same surname, let alone their facial features.

“Zhuo Bing, perhaps there is some kind of misunderstanding,” said Tang Xiao.

“Misunderstanding? None whatsoever. You have the guts to bully my young brother, if I don’t beat your teeth out and make you look for them all over the floor, I don’t deserve the ‘Ice Queen’ title! Eat this!”

Zhuo Bing was not in the mood to explain anything to Tang Xiao. Her figure blurred, appearing in front of Tang Xiao after a flash.

The staff in her hands suddenly turned bigger and formed a skyscraping shadow staff in a split second, slamming down directly at Tang Xiao. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Damn it!”

Tang Xiao was extremely angry and frightened. He had no time to suppress Zhong Yi anymore and turned around to start battling Zhuo Bing.

Zhuo Bing and he were both First-Class Divine Demons with both being geniuses as well. Theoretically, their ability should have been similar, however...

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Blow by blow, the vicious shadow staff perpetually slammed over without any fanciness.

The power was frighteningly strong while its speed was extremely fast. The continuous frenzy and angry blows did not give Tang Xiao any opportunity to catch his breath.

Almost immediately, Tang Xiao was being suppressed by the frightening shadow staff.

“That’s so powerful!”

The surrounding disciples who witnessed it could not help but to exclaim.

It was truly incredibly powerful. At least for those disciples, the shadow staff was too scary.

Most importantly, the shadow staff perpetually attacked blow by blow. It was extremely terrifying.

Even Jian Wushuang could not hide his shock, as he watched Zhuo Bing’s continuous staff’s shadows.

“This Big Sister of mine, she’s THIS tough?” Jian Wushuang murmured to himself.

Tough!

Exactly. At that moment, Zhuo Bing could really be described as ‘tough’.

Her attack method was extremely simple, barbarous, and vicious.

It could also be extended to the way she carried herself—extremely overbearing.

No wonder she gained the nickname ‘Ice Queen’

However, what Jian Wushuang did not expect was that his Big Sister had such strong capabilities.

Even Tang Xiao was instantly being suppressed to the point where he could not fight back. That kind of battle strength was even a bit stronger than Zhong Yi. She was probably almost comparable to the last few Twelve Minor Kings.

However, according to what he knew, his Big Sister’s abilities were not that strong.

He remembered that his father, Zhuo Yunfeng mentioned to him that his Big Sister did return home once not long before Jian Wushuang was born. According to Zhuo Yunfeng’s account, his Big Sister had already broken through to Chaotic Realm.

If it took her twenty over years to reach the Chaotic Realm, then it was impossible that Zhuo Bing could become First-Class Divine Demon within another twenty-odd year, let alone possessing such a level of ability.

After all, Zhuo Bing was not reincarnated, hence her cultivation speed should not be so fast.

Obviously, Zhuo Bing had probably achieved Divine Demon Realm a lot earlier. She probably had even been a First-Class Divine Demon for a long time. Perhaps Zhuo Yunfeng’s abilities were not strong enough to tell, thinking that she was only in the Chaotic Realm.

“Looks like this Big Sister of mine is a lot stronger than I had imagined.” Jian Wushuang was secretly exclaiming in surprise.
