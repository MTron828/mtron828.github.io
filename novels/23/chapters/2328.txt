Chapter 2329: Lin Tao, Thunder Sound Sect

“Haha, Brother Zhuo,” Lin Tiefeng smiled broadly as he greeted his guests.

“Brother Lin, it’s been a few years. How have you been?” Zhuo Yunfeng smiled as well.

“Thank you for coming this time,” Lin Tiefeng said solemnly.

“We are brothers, why the formalities?” Zhuo Yunfeng complained.

Lin Tiefeng was left speechless and smiled. He looked at Luo Xinqin and Jian Wushuang at the side. “Both of them have decided to come too?”

“Yes,” Zhuo Yunfeng replied. “The Zhuge Family tried to kill Shuang before. I could not leave them back at the mansion without fears of an assassination.”

“Is that so?” Lin Tiefeng nodded and said, “Rest assured, Brother Zhuo. Even if the Lin Family was at the brink of extinction, I would do whatever I could to make sure they escape safely.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Thank you.” Zhuo Yunfeng heaved a sigh of relief.

“Brother Zhuo, over here.” Lin Tiefeng waved his hand.

The Zhuo family headed inside the Lin Mansion.

Many Lin Mansion experts around them were talking amongst themselves.

“That’s the Governor of the Incineration Moon City?”

“I have heard of the good relations between Governor Zhuo and our Head. I guess that was true!”

“Those experts who are on good terms with the Lin Family all refused to help us, but now Governor Zhuo is the first one here, with his entire family as well! Looks like they are ready to fight and die alongside us!”

“Oh, did you notice the young man beside him, Jian Wushuang?”

“Of course. He crushed Zhuge Hong’s divine weapon three years ago with his fingers, saving face for the Lin Family.”

The experts had nothing but respect and admiration for Zhuo Yunfeng and Jian Wushuang.

A friend in need was a friend indeed.

There was no doubt regarding Zhuo Yunfeng’s intentions.

Once they had settled down in the Lin Mansion, Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Tiefeng went into discussion.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the courtyard that he had lived in before. Soon, two figures rushed over.

They were Lin Yan and Lin Qingqing.

“Haha, Brother Wushuang!”

Jian Wushuang could hear Lin Yan’s hearty laughter from far and walked out of the room with a smile.

“Young Lord Wushuang,” Lin Qingqing said, her eyes full of respect for Jian Wushuang.

In the past three years, Jian Wushuang had stayed at the Lin Mansion, he had impressed many with his proficiency with the Sword Principle.

After Jian Wushuang had defeated Zhuge Hong, countless more Lin Mansion disciples had looked at him in admiration.

Three years had passed, but that sense of admiration had never subsided.

“Young Lord Yan, Young Qingqing, it’s been some time,” Jian Wushuang greeted them with a smile.

“Haha, Brother Wushuang. have you changed much these past three years?” Lin Yan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Same as you, not at all,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Lin Yan was considered his first friend in his current life.

His character was similar to that of his best buddy Wang Yuan – loud, straightforward, and carefree.

Jian Wushuang was pleased to make such friends.

“Are you prepared for what’s to come?” Jian Wushuang smiled as he asked Lin Yan.

“Of course, I’ve improved quite a bit these past three years, you know. If the Zhuge Family dares to come, I’ll let them have it,” Lin Yan replied coldly.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang lifted his brow. He could tell that Lin Yan’s abilities had improved, but he was not at Pure Sun Realm yet, a mere pinnacle Transformed God. He was nothing in the war between the Zhuge Family.

Of course, its good to have such fighting ambitions.

As Jian Wushuang, Lin Yan and Lin Qingqing were talking casually, a Lin Mansion disciple ran in hurriedly.

“Brother Yan, I knew you would be here.” The disciple’s eyes lit up the moment he saw Lin Yan.

“I’m reminiscing with Brother Wushuang, what’s the matter?” Lin Yan frowned.

“Brother Tao’s back,” the disciple replied.

“Oh?” Lin Yan flinched, then immediately displayed great joy.

So did Lin Qingqing.

“Brother Tao?”

“Lin Tao?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He had learned a bit about the Lin Mansion people in the three years he stayed there.

He had not met Lin Tao personally, but Jian Wushuang had heard of him.

Lin Tao was supposedly the best genius the Lin Mansion had had in centuries.

He made the breakthrough to Pure Sun Realm by the age of twenty – better than that Zhuge Hong. He had then entered the Chaotic Realm at the age of 27, and entered a sect called the Thunder Sound Sect, and never returned since.

But Lin Tao was back this time.

“Brother Tao is back?”

“Come, let’s go see.”

Lin Yan was obviously excited and even dragged Jian Wushuang along towards the Lin Mansion gates.

Soon they arrived.

Sure enough, a few figures stood surrounded by crowds of Lin Mansion disciples and some experts.

The man that stood in the centre, the handsome young man, was Lin Tao, Lin Mansion’s first genius.

He smiled and greeted the Lin Mansion experts as the disciples looked at him with admiration.

That kind of admiration was different to how they had looked at Jian Wushuang. Their admiration now had frenzy added to the mix.

Jian Wushuang was gifted and had defeated Zhuge Hong, but he did not belong to the Lin Mansion in the end.

But not for Lin Tao. He was the young disciples’ idol.

“Is that Lin Tao?” Jian Wushuang gaze Lin Tao a slight glance, but what he really noticed were the four behind him.

Three males, one female, all young.

Jian Wushuang could tell that the three men were already at Half Step Divine Demon levels.

The woman was stronger – a real Chaotic Divine Demon.

“One Chaotic Divine Demon, three Half Step Divine Demon experts. Not only did he rush back himself, he even got help,” Jian Wushuang smiled.
