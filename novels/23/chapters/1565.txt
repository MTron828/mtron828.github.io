Chapter 1566: Spear Demon, Chen Hu!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the gorge of a luxuriant forest, Jian Wushuang, who had grey hair and looked as though he was going to die any minute, was sitting in silence.

On the top of the mountain before Jian Wushuang, vroom! A sudden flowing light dove down.

One should know that the mountain was about a hundred zhang high and the person who dove down obviously didn’t know how to travel in the air. But as he fell…

Bang! Bang! Bang!

His palm or feet would tap the mountain wall by the side and continuously unload the force. In the end, he landed flawlessly on the ground.

“Master,” Chen Hu walked before Jian Wushuang.

After ten years, Chen Hu had grown up into a brawny good looking young man.

He carried a purple spear on his back.

“Hu Zi, you’re eighteen this year, right?” Jian Wushuang lifted his head to look at Jian Wushuang.

Although Chen Hu had already grown up and become an adult, Jian Wushuang still called him Hu Zi, but Chen Hu wasn’t unhappy about it.

“Yes,” Chen Hu said.

“Eighteen years old. It’s about time. We should leave,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Leave?” Chen Hu stunned.

“Why? Didn’t you say that you want to take revenge? Unless you don’t want to anymore?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Of course not. Even when I sleep, I dream about taking revenge!” Chen Hu clenched his fists and there was a terrifying, murderous intention shimmering in his eyes.

“Then, let’s go.

Jian Wushuang and Chen Hu, who had stayed in the forest for ten years, were finally leaving.

In the rolling hills, although it was only ten years, to a mortal world, there was already a drastic change.

In the past ten years, the originally different gangs of mounted gangsters only had one left, which was Baisha Gang.

Ever since Baisha Gang was founded, they had cleaned out all the other mounted gangsters and unified them in a few years time.

Until then, there was only Baisha gang. It was said that they had more than twenty warriors and more than a hundred villages around the mountain had to pay them yearly fees. Otherwise, the village would have vanished into thin air like Chen Village ten years ago.

But then, that day, a young man who held a purple long spear, who looked less than twenty years old, barged into Baisha Gang’s lair alone.

He called himself Chen Hu from Chen Village and he had come to take revenge on behalf of Chen Village, which was destroyed ten years ago.

Then, there was a ferocious battle.

In an hour. The battle ended in merely an hour.

An hour later, the three leaders of Baisha Gang died. The twenty warriors were all killed.

As for the remaining mounted gangsters, Chen Hu killed ninety percent of them!

One should know that Baisha Gang had thousands of men since they formed. It also meant that Chen Hu had killed more than thousands of mounted gangsters.

His fierce power and terrifying massacre spread across. It instantly stirred a great commotion among the hundreds of villages at the mountain, and also the cities outside the mountain.

After the battle, Chen Hu was also given the name Spear Demon.

Of course, Chen Hu didn’t care about the reputation and fame from being Spear Demon. He only cared about the fact that he had finally taken revenge.

Chen Hu knew clearly that his work had played a factor but mostly, it was because of his Master Wu Chen’s guidance.

“Master, where should we go now?” Chen Hu followed behind Jian Wushuang as he asked politely.

“I don’t know,” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “Wherever we want to walk to I guess. Why? You’re not willing to follow the old man any more?”

“No, Hu Zi is willing to be by Master’s side forever,” Chen Hu said.

“Forever? That’s not necessary,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Then, Jian Wushuang brought Chen Hu out from the mountain and started wandering around the world.

Jian Wushuang was still in the process of passing his inverse cultivation test. He had no idea how long it would be until the test would be over, but he was only a commoner then and he would naturally live like a commoner.

Trekking through difficult terrains and rivers, walking on foot.

It was what Jian Wushuang wanted to do.

Chen Hu followed him. With Jian Wushuang’s guidance, his power was continuously improving at a shocking speed.

Actually, Chen Hu had potential. Through the years he stayed by Jian Wushuang, he had never noticed but Jian Wushuang had built up his strong constitution using Natural Treasure.

With the resources that Jian Wushuang had on hand, he could totally be the most powerful Universe God in Qing Tian Mystery Land anytime but he didn’t do that.

He only wanted to teach Chen Hu some basics but didn’t want to decide on Chen Hu’s growth.

Even though Chen Hu might not become a Universe God all his life, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t bother.

As time flew past, Chen Hu’s power constantly improved at a shocking speed. Sometimes, he would launch an attack and his fame as Demon Spear naturally grew more prominent.

In the blink of an eye, it had been twenty years.

At a steep lofty mountain, Jian Wushuang held a wooden staff as he walked upwards with great difficulty. It seemed like he wanted to trek over the mountain.

“Master, let me carry you?” Chen Hu asked.

“No need,” Jian Wushuang waved and wanted to go forward using his own strength.

Just then, swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures that suddenly plunged through from the void from afar. They quickly landed before Jian Wushuang and Chen Hu.

Chen Hu squinted his eyes and the purple longspear appeared in his hand. He looked at the two people before him solemnly.

He could tell that the two people before him were extremely strong.

“Mister, you should be Demon Spear, Chen Hu?” One of the men in a white robe smiled and asked.

“It’s me. Who are you? What’s the matter?” Chen Hu sounded cold and he gave out a faint glower.

“Don’t misunderstand. We are not here to look for trouble with you,” The man in a white robe smiled, “To be frank with you, we are from Rising Sun Palace. We are here under orders to invite you to join Rising Sun Palace. With your power and your swordsmanship, you definitely could be one of the twelve Deputy Palace Masters in Rising Sun Palace.”

“Rising Sun Palace?” Chen Hu was shocked.

Jian Wushuang, who had never spoken, suddenly lifted his head.

He came to Qing Tian Mystery Land for thirty years. He couldn’t fly during the thirty years and he had been traveling on foot. He never walks too far of a distance and he was still in one of the dynasties in Qing Tian Mystery Land. The dynasty was known as Divine Light Dynasty and there were some sects with impressive cultivators in Divine Light Dynasty.

Rising Sun Palace was one of the top sects.

In Divine Light Dynasty, there were many warriors who were dreaming of entering Rising Sun Palace.

Plus, a Deputy Palace Masters in Rising Sun Palace was definitely considered to be a higher-up in Rising Sun Palace.
