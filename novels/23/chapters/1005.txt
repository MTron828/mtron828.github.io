Chapter 1006: Consider Yourself Fortunate

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Not even the grey-robed elder could resist a creeping fear slinking into him at the notion of “that” very race.

They were one of the most powerful races of populations on the Samsara Continent.

“You can never hope to match my powers, brat. Leave now while you can.” The elder uttered as he cast a cold glance at Jian Wushuang.

“Ridiculous. You seem to imply that you can easily kill me like how you raise a finger. Show me if you dare.” Jian Wushuang taunted without fear, a faint smile lined across his face.

“Very well… It is you who seeks Death on your own volition, I am not to be blamed.” The elder hissed as his eyes flared murderously.

The elder knew that he would only have to ensure no loose ends were left and he would not have to worry of vengeful reprisals from “that” very race.

“Hmph!”

With a furious and contemptuous snort, the mysterious runic symbols on the face of the grey-robed elder began to shine with a dark, glowy luster. The evil and sinister illumination grew, slowly enveloping him awhole, bathing him fully in the faint brightness. The elder spread his bat-like wings to their entirety, his figure too growing in size.

In mere seconds, the grey-robed elder had morphed into a hulking giant, bearing an uncanny resemblance to that of a monstrous bat.

“Ah” Jian Wushuan looked with his eyes wide at the spectacle of the bat-like giant before him.

“Hahaha… Remarkable. His Secret Skill allows him to manifest the primeval form of his Bloodline.” The Gu King said.

The blood-red eyes of the giant black bat flashed with malice and it took into the sky with tremendous speed like a lightning bolt.

“Screech!”

The gigantic bat emitted a cry that shook all heaven and earth.

With the fierce and shrilling cry, came a powerful sonic wave with effects that would disorient foes and enemies rushed and swept towards Jian Wushuang.

“Ah… This is vexing…” Jian Wushuang muttered, his face turning gloomy as even he was discombobulated himself.

Suddenly, the huge black bat reappeared over Jian Wushuang with the intensity of a lightning strike, baring its fangs ravenously at him. So fast was its blitzing assault that its jaws snapped and its fangs sank deep into Jian Wushuang’s chest as the bat clenched him in its vice-like grip before he could recover himself.

The giant bat mustered its strength for a fatal bite… unleashing a powerful and terrifying force!

“Jian Wushuang!”?The Dragon Wing Governor cried with distress and great astonishment.

“Crack!”

There came an abrupt groan from between its jaws. The pupils of the black bat contracted fiercely all of a sudden, laced with horror and panic. Immediately, from its throat, the bat spat out Jian Wushuang and lurched backward.

The figure of Jian Wushuang was belched out violently, along with a broken half of one of the bat’s fang.

The fang, without no doubt, belonged to the giant bat. But it was broken when it was thrown out of the monster’s mouth.

“The monster morphed by the elder had attempted to clamp its jaws upon Jian Wushuang, but only to have its fang broken instead? “The Dragon Wing Governor stammered, dazed and bewildered.

The giant bat had retreated some distance away to safety. It shrank and returned into the form of the elder in grey robes, whose eyes regarded Jian Wushuang with fear and horror.

“I, I…” The grey-robed elder grimaced with agony and paid as well as the panic that now gripped him.

He had morphed into his strongest form, used his greatest might and had used his most powerful attack. It was an attack which would have even shredded a true Rank Three Dao Master into nothing but globs of lifeless flesh, viscera, and blood.

With great effort he had exerted great force, yet, not only Jian Wushuang was hardly hurt, it was the elder himself who had got injured.

“This is impossible. Not even a powerful Dao Master of ‘that’ race would be able to withstand the force of my bite, much less damaging my fangs! Unless…” The grey-robed elder stared with at Jian Wushuang, finally noticing his blood-red robes.

Twice he had struck, most notably his recent attack in the form of a monstrous bat. Nonetheless, the Jian Wushuang’s blood-red robes remained intact, creaseless and wrinkleless.

“The blood-red robes he wears must be a treasure. It’s a potent treasure of protection.” The grey-robed elder muttered, understanding finally.

Jian Wushuang taunted him with a sneer, “I see your fangs are no less softer than even my body, old man?”

“Jian Wushuang,” The Dragon Wing Governor approached him and spoke to him, “I’ve sent a word to a friend of mine. He’ll come to our help.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang remarked, his brows twitching dramatically. He turned to the grey-robed elder and shouted, “Did you not hear, you old senile? Why are you still here? Do you intend to bite me again? Come if you will, we will see how many more fangs you can afford to lose.”

The older man’s face grew dark with suppressed rage, but there was nothing he could say to retort.

Never would he dare to venture another bite on Jian Wushuang once more.

“The young knave’s strong defensive capabilities makes it impossible for me to kill him. More so, with his remarkable strength. It’s impossible for me to kill the Dragon Wing Governor, now that he is here.” The old man deliberated over his decision, finally relenting and gave up.

“What a pity. It seems that today I won’t have the chance to relish the taste of Essence Blood of Winged Dragon Clan.”

“Consider yourself fortunate, you young knave!”

The grey-robed elder licked his lips and shot a hateful glance at Jian Wushuang. “But don’t be conceited. Jin Yu is a Rank Seven Reincarnator of the Samsara Temple with considerable influence and allies. With his death, many will hunt for your blood to avenge him.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Not even your race will be able to defend you!”

“Just you wait!”

With a final look at Jian Wushuang, the grey-robed elder snorted furiously and vanished into thin air with a swing of his sleeves.

Jian Wushuang and the Dragon Wing Governor watched as the older man vanished, showing no intentions of pursuing him.

They both knew full well that the grey-robed elder wielded greater strength over them both. They would never be able to prevent his flight.

“Finally he’s left.” The Dragon Wing Governor breathed heavily, relieved.

It was not until the old man had fully disappeared that the panic that throbbed at his heart began to calm and subside.

“Thank you, Jian Wushuang. It was by your help that I was able to survive this ordeal.” The Governor expressed his gratitude sincerely.

“It is my pleasure, Master Governor. I have enjoyed your hospitality and your advice for the three years of my stay at your residence.” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

The Dragon Wing Governor was instead faintly surprised before he continued weakly. “Nay. I’ve been conceited and vain. You have great strength; much greater than mine, yet I tried to give you instructions and advise you. This is…”

The Dragon Wing Governor’s voice faltered as he could only sigh with somberly.

Feeling that he owe Jian Wushuang for his gift, he had tried to return the favor by giving him instructions and advice to help him improve his swordsmanship.

Trying to advise Jian Wushuang as an elder, he under the impression that Jian Wushuang was indeed a mere youngling of the Eternal Realm, believing himself to be qualified to counsel, instruct and advise the young warrior.

It was not until today that he finally realized that the young warrior was, in fact, a stronger warrior that he was.
