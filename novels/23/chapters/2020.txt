2021 The Bar Figh

“It’s a pity that we were in a rush when we interrogated Silver-Winged Mansion Master. We didn’t find out the requirements to enter Imperial Peak,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“It’s okay. We can ask around,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and his gaze was fixed on a bar in front of him.

There were bars in any city and the same applied in Imperial City.

The brawny man that Jian Wushuang took the form of had already walked to the bar.

Jian Wushuang casually sat at a table after he entered the bar. He didn’t care if there was anyone else there but shouted, “Waiter!”

“Mister!” A waiter in black working in the bar quickly came next to Jian Wushuang. The waiter in black was also a Chaotic Real God.

“Give me your best alcohol,” Jian Wushuang demanded.

“Yes,” the waiter in black waved and there was a pot of alcohol that appeared on Jian Wushuang’s table, “Enjoy, mister.”

Then, the waiter in black turned to leave.

“Don’t be in a hurry to leave. I have something to ask you,” Jian Wushuang stopped the waiter in black from leaving.

“Mister, how can I help you?” The waiter in black behaved rather humbly. He could tell that Jian Wushuang was an expert above Chaotic Realm. Naturally, Jian Wushuang wasn’t someone he could afford to offend.

“It is my first time here in Imperial City. I heard that there’s this place called Imperial Peak in Imperial City. It is a cultivation sanctuary. I want to get there. I wonder what the prerequisites are?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Oh, just about this?” The waiter in black raised his eyebrows and answered, “Mister, there are two ways to get to Imperial Peak. First, reach a certain level in power and become a deacon in Imperial Cabinet. However, the deacon in Imperial Cabinet is normally taken charge of by experts above the middle stage chaotic realm.”

“Tell me the second way,” Jian Wushuang waved.

He was merely in early stage Chaotic Realm. If he were to display the fighting power of one in middle stage Chaotic Realm, it would catch people’s attention.

“The second way is easier. Every century, the Imperial City will have a ranking competition. The competition is carried out on two levels. One is Chaotic Real God level and the other is for experts like yourself, early stage Chaotic Realm. Regardless of who you are, as long as you can be in the top five in the ranking competition that is held every one hundred years, you will be qualified to enter Imperial Peak for cultivation. As for how long you can stay in there, it depends on your performance in Imperial Peak.”

“For example, geniuses who are extremely gifted, they could stay and cultivate in Imperial Peak. When they leave, they will already have joined Imperial Cabinet and became the top experts in Imperial Cabinet,” the waiter in black said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang was tempted.

The second way to enter via ranking competition was extremely workable for him.

“Let me ask you. How long is it until the next ranking competition?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s close! It has been ninety-five years since the previous ranking competition. There are only five years left until the next ranking competition begins,” the waiter in black answered.

“Five years?” Jian Wushuang nodded in silence.

It the ranking competition had just ended not long ago and it required another hundred years until the competition came, he definitely wouldn’t wait for it.

However, he could afford to wait if it was only five years away. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Then, Jian Wushuang broke into a smile. He grabbed the waiter in black by his collar and spoke into his ear, “You, I am going to give you a reward. There are many cultivation resources in this Qian Kun ring. I’m giving them to you. Go and prepare everything for me. I want to join the ranking competition in five years’ time!”

“Yes, thank you, Mister!” The waiter in black was thrilled in excitement after he took the Qian Kun ring. He nodded politely and asked, “How do I address you, Mister?”

“I’m Ah Shou, which represents a beast!” Jian Wushuang roared and his voice resounded in the bar.

There were many other cultivators in the bar. They heard Jian Wushuang roar and many creased their eyebrows but they didn’t bother.

On the table next to him, there was a lady in green that scoffed, “Ah Shou? What kind of a silly man would name himself that?”

There was a handsome young man in a white robe who sat opposite the lady in green. He chuckled and replied, “Should be someone who came in from some remote areas. Look at him. He has no experience in life. He didn’t even know the prerequisites to enter Imperial Peak.”

The two of them chatted casually. Although they lowered their voices, how could Jian Wushuang not hear it with his power?

Jian Wushuang immediately put on a savage look and stared at the two of them, “You two sons of a b*tches, what are you talking about? Do you think I can’t hear you?”

The faces of the young man and the lady in green changed.

‘Son of a b*tch’ had obviously offended them.

“Ah Shou, right?” The handsome young man stood up and he stared at Jian Wushuang with his malicious gaze, “I am from Lin Family in Prefecture Tong, Lin Tianhao. This is my god-sister, from Si Tu Family in Prefecture Tong. What you said earlier… If you were to kowtow and apologize now, the two of us would let you off the hook. Otherwise…”

“Otherwise? Otherwise what?” Jian Wushuang smirked. His smirk was as cold as a sharp blade, “Whatever Lin Family, Si Tu Family, I have never heard of them. Don’t bring up all these family names to scare me. None of these family names matter to me.”

“You have guts! If so, don’t blame me,” the handsome young man, Lin Tianhao, immediately turned illusionary.

Lin Tianhao took action in the bar straight away.

Hong!

Lin Tianhao’s aura was churning. He was an expert in Chaotic Realm and also only in early stage Chaotic Realm. His aura was intense and his divine power was pure. He was obviously much stronger than an ordinary cultivator in Early Stage Chaotic Realm.

Just as his figure grew illusionary, his right hand stretched forth his palm and waved. The divine power instantly burst out.

“Haha, just in time!”

Jian Wushuang let out a burst of hearty laughter. He was fearless but he took a step forward and raised his hand to punch ferociously.

Jian Wushuang, of course, intentionally reserved some strength. Even so, the power of the punch was enough for a top Sir God to take him seriously.

Bang!

The collision of both parties caused a deep thud.

As they were in the bar and they were in Imperial City, both parties controlled their divine power during the attack. They didn’t let the divine power spread, nor did they destroy the bar. They didn’t even break any tables or chairs.

“Humph!”

Lin Tianhao humphed and his palm suddenly became red.
