Chapter 3765: The Devil Flame of Domination

“Now you know how to beg for mercy?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “What do you mean by saying that you will only be offended in a moment of excitement? Is this just an offense?

“If I wasn’t a cultivator with a perfect life, I would have died long ago. Humph, if you want me to spare your life, you have to hand over your soul origin. Otherwise, you will die.”

“Soul origin?” The soul turned pale with fright.

The soul origin was the core material of the soul, which could control its life and death.

Except for a perfect life like Jian Wushuang, anyone would attach great importance to the soul origin.

To hand over the soul origin voluntarily?

That was equivalent to leaving their life and death in the other party’s control. Therefore, many people would rather die than hand over their soul origin.

But now…

“Okay, I’ll hand it over. I’ll hand over the soul origin.”

The Soul Body only hesitated for a moment before agreeing.

“You agreed so quickly?” Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised.

He was sure that this Soul Body must have been an extremely powerful expert, or even a supreme expert.

Would such a super expert really hand over the soul origin to him?

......

Jian Wushuang immediately had some doubts.

However, the Soul Body was very decisive. It directly forced his soul origin out of the Soul Body and sent it to Jian Wushuang.

“This aura is indeed the soul origin, and it was forced out of the Soul Body. It should be his soul origin. That’s right.” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly, but he still controlled this soul origin at once.

After controlling it, Jian Wushuang immediately obtained the connection between this soul origin and this Soul Body.

Jian Wushuang had a feeling that he had already controlled the life and death of this Soul Body.

“He really gave his soul origin to me?” Jian Wushuang was very strange.

“Master, can I return to the gourd now?” The Soul Body begged.

The soul origin was under Jian Wushuang’s control. It could be said that his life and death depended on Jian Wushuang’s thoughts. The Soul Body was straightforward enough to address Jian Wushuang as master.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang did not stop it.

Without Jian Wushuang’s hindrance, the Soul Body quickly returned to the Blood-Red Gourd.

However, even if he returned to the Blood-Red Gourd, Jian Wushuang still had absolute control over it through the soul origin.

Neither the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master nor the Temporal Temple Master knew what had happened in Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

They only sensed that an extremely powerful soul had entered Jian Wushuang’s body from the Blood-Red Gourd, and then Jian Wushuang’s soul power dissipated temporarily.

This shocked both Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master.

Fortunately, it did not take long for Jian Wushuang’s soul power to recover.

Finally, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what happened?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master asked.

“Heavenly Marquis, did something happen?” Temporal Temple Master looked over.

“Don’t be nervous.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said with a smile, “Something happened just now.”

Then, Jian Wushuang told them about the process of the Soul Body possession.

“Good lord, the Soul Body in the Blood-Red Gourd wants to take your house? How dare you!” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said with a hint of anger in his eyes.

Temporal Temple Master chuckled, “This soul is really unlucky. He could have taken anyone’s body, but he chose to take your body. You are at the perfect life level, and your soul origin and divine power are completely fused together. You are absolutely invincible in terms of soul. I’m afraid that even a Supreme Being at his peak would not be able to take your body.”

“He’s really unlucky. Now his soul origin is in my hands,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Soul origin?” The eyes of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and the Temporal Temple Master lit up.

“My young friend, do you mean that the Soul Body has given its soul origin to you?” The Temporal Temple Master asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “If he doesn’t give it to me, I will kill his Soul Body in my divine body. He has no choice but to give it to me.”

“Haha, that’s great.” Temporal Temple Master smiled and said, “This Soul Body is so powerful, so it must have a powerful origin. My young friend, please ask quickly.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang understood and immediately covered the Blood-Red Gourd with his consciousness.

“Who are you?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

“Master, my name is Devil Flame. I come from the nether world and am a Chaos Ruler who has reached the ultimate level.” The Soul Body in the gourd said respectfully.

“Devil Flame?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He remembered that Pupil had summoned the Devil Flame Body with the Blood-Red Gourd. The Devil Flame Body must have been the work of Devil Flame.

He had never heard of the nether world, so it must not be an astral world in this Star Field.

“An ultimate level Chaos Ruler?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had thought that the soul was an autarch, but he did not expect it to be just a Chaos Ruler.

However, the Chaos Ruler he knew was only at the elementary, advanced, and top levels. As for the so-called ultimate level, he did not know about it.

“What is the ultimate level?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Master, you don’t know about the ultimate level?” The Devil Flame Soul Body was obviously a little surprised.

“The Star Field we are in now should be at the edge of the universe. The strongest one here is only at the Superior Ruler level. There is no Ultimate Ruler,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Is that so?” The Devil Flame Soul Body understood, but then said seriously, “Master, how many principles have the Superior Rulers in your Star Field fused?”

“This…” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He did not know the answer to this question, so he could only ask the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master.

“In our Star Field, as long as you fuse four rules, you can become a Ruler. As far as I know, most Rulers only fuse four rules. The Superior Rulers usually understand five rules, but they can’t fuse all five rules together. As for the Superior Rulers, I don’t know if anyone has fused five rules,” the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said.

“My young friend, you’ve fought with a Superior Ruler before, can’t you feel it?” Temporal Temple Master asked.

“When I fought with Master Qing, I didn’t see that she had fused five rules into her attack. I think she hasn’t reached this level. As for Master Heaven Roc, although he fought with me, he didn’t use his full strength at that time. I don’t know whether he has reached it or not.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Devil Flame, is it true that only a Ruler who combines five rules is the Ultimate Ruler?” Jian Wushuang asked.
