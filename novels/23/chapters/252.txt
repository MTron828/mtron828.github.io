Chapter 253: The Might of the Three Fingers

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Every one of the countless experts in the Heartless Island couldn’t help but be stunned at Qi Luosheng’s words.

Merely 30 percent power?

That move just then, which struck fear deep in everyone’s hearts, had only consisted of 30 percent of his strength?

“30 percent power?” Jian Wushuang shrunk his eyes.

It seemed that the Divine Transcendence expert was much more frightening than he had imagined.

He had used every ounce of his strength implementing his Blood Rupturing Movement to fend off that move just then. And yet he was still at an enormous disadvantage.

With only one finger, Qi Luosheng had used 30 percent of his strength.

If a move with 30 percent of strength was so powerful, then what about 60 percent?

“Alright boy, get ready for the second finger. I’m coming.” Qi Luosheng laughed dully. Immediately, he extended a finger of his right hand.

Rumble... Once again the void in front of Jian Wushuang was split open.

An enormous finger came, which was extruding power that felt as if it came from ancients times. In terms of strength, this was undoubtedly much stronger than the previous one. When it appeared, the power surrounding it seemed to have silenced both heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang concentrated his vision, preparing for the next attack. The next moment, his Triple-kill Sword suddenly emitted dazzling light.

The power of the inferior second-grade magic weapon broke out. The moment he held up the long sword. its power reached its limit. Then he violently thrust downwards.

The sixth move of the Selfless Sword Technique!

The Selfless Sword Technique attached the most importance to Origin of the World and made each other stronger.

Before, in the Ancestor’s Land, passing through the Rainstorm Palace in contemplation, he had come to know the fourth and fifth move of Selfless Sword Technique in succession and was only a small step from the sixth move. In the month after leaving the Ancestor’s Land, at the same time as he massacred the Blood Feather Tower’s stronghold, he finally grasped the sixth move.

Now, he finally was able to put the sixth move to full use.

The sword dazzled with incomparable brilliance.

With one slash of the sword, it seemed as if it could cleave any living thing and the heavens themselves.

However, despite the awesomeness of this mighty sword, when faced with the oncoming attack of the ancient giant finger as they collided, there was a terrible rumble. In merely a flash this incomparable and brilliant sword was summarily defeated.

Bang!

As the gigantic blast came forward, Jian Wushuang once more withdrew himself. This time, as he fell back, he spat a mouthful of fresh blood out.

Under the attack of the finger with 60 percent of strength, Jian Wushuang was already seriously injured.

“Still one finger left.”

Qi Luosheng’s gaze was indifferent as he glanced at Jian Wushuang. “With this final finger, I’ll use 90 percent of my strength. You should take it well.”

As Qi Luosheng’s words trailed off, his third finger immediately came out.

Boom!

The void atop Jian Wushuang suddenly had a large hole split in it. Then a giant finger stretched through that hole and moved toward Jian Wushuang.

The power of the finger was much more frightening than the two that had come before.

When this finger came forward, countless experts in the arena could not help but suck in a breath of cold air.

Such a finger was able to kill more than 10 experts at the Peak of Yang Void Realm in an instant.

Watching this finger, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Merely 60 percent of strength had caused him to be injured, now 90 percent... The power of the finger was nearly more than he could bear.

“No matter what, I need to do my best.” Jian Wushuang lifted up his head, and in a split second ferociously burst forward with killing intent.

Slaughter Origin enveloped his whole body, causing him to look like a peerless Shura that had come from Hell.

He lifted the Triple-kill Sword once again. The moment he raised up the Long Sword, the Sword Soul in his sea of consciousness madly trembled. Then a giant spectral image appeared behind his back.

This spectral image was more than 100 feet tall, like a giant. His body stood straight and tall, coming into view with an ice cold-stare devoid of any emotion, staring straight at the heavens.

This gaze seemed full of disdain for everything in the entire world. He stood behind Jian Wushuang, as if he was an unmatched God of War.

This giant raised a huge sword, and slashed downwards as Jian Wushuang did.

“Blood Emptying Technique, the First Move, All-smashing Stroke!”

The Unmatched Sword!

Sword of Killing!

There was an immediate explosion.

When it comes to offensive power, Slaughter Origin was stronger than World Origin.

This Blood Emptying Technique was also Jian Wushuang’s strongest move at present. Giving all that he had, his Slaughter Origin exploded with immense power.

Even Qi Luosheng couldn’t help but be stunned when he saw the stroke. However, he still sneered like before. “Your swordsmanship is better than I thought. It’s a shame that the difference in strength is so great. In the face of absolute power, it all means nothing.”

As his voice drifted off, the ancient giant finger that came from atop the void descended and slammed directly into the Sword of Killing.

Boom!

The Heavens fell and the earth split asunder!

A blast wave seemingly capable of destroying everything formed in the spot where the two of them collided with each other, madly spreading out.

This blast wave swept out and reached many of the experts on the periphery. The Yin Void and even the Yang Void experts were shocked, and their bodies were involuntarily slammed back.

“Go to hell,” Qi Luosheng said softly with cold eyes.

Snap! Jian Wushuang’s expression immediately changed as the giant behind him dissipated. The giant finger had pulverized his swordsmanship, and afterwards the merciless attacks on his body continued downwards. Finally, it violently hit the ground of the Heartless Island.

Boom!

The entire Heartless Island swayed, which had never happened before. After everything had settled, everyone couldn’t help but look at the direct center of the Heartless Island. There appeared a giant circular pit more than dozens of meters in diameter. It was so deep that you could not see the bottom.

Jian Wushuang fell into the lowest part of that pit. No one knew whether he was alive or dead.

“How terrible!”

“This, this is the strength of a Divine Transcendence expert?”

“No, he still hasn’t used all of his abilities, just then he only used 90 percent, but the results...”

For all of the countless experts inside and out of the Heartless Island, this moment shook them to their core.

The Divine Transcendence expert was so powerful and unbelievable!

He was strong enough to make people choke in desperation! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Is Jian Wushuang dead?”

The experts of each side were shaken, and they all simultaneously one after the other?stared towards the bottom of the pit. Everyone was curious about whether Jian Wushuang?could survive such a terrible attack.

“Brother!”

“Brother!”

Wang Yuan and Su Rou had a worried look.

At the same time, Jian Nantian, who had been lying on the Drill Ground and casually drinking, narrowed his eyes as he looked towards the pit.

Qi Luosheng stood above the pit and coldly looked downward.

“Such a little expert of the?Initial Yang Void Realm could make me use 90 percent of my strength. Even though you’re dead, you should be proud.” Qi Luosheng laughed coldly, but suddenly his laughter was cut off.
