Chapter 5477 ¬†Dine and Dash

Crack!

In a dim alley, a short and thin man dragged a struggling woman. The woman resisted relentlessly.

A slap echoed as the short and thin man fiercely declared, "It's all because of you, my streak of bad luck! If I lose money, blame it on you. Today, I'll sell you off!"

Jian Wushuang squatted at the alley entrance, watching the scene unfold without any intention of intervening. Mainly because he thought that dealing with a woman should be no problem for this short and thin guy.

"No, something's not right!" Jian Wushuang shook his head; his thoughts had taken a twisted turn.

The short and thin man, gripping the woman's hair, dragged her through the snowy path.

As he passed by, Jian Wushuang silently extended the stick in his hand and tripped the short and thin man, sending him face-first into the snow.

"Ouch!" The short and thin man's head hit the ground, and his teeth were knocked out.

Nosebleed streamed from his nose, and he released his hold on the woman, covering his nose. He turned to see a beggar laughing at him. Enraged, he cursed, "You beggar dared to trip me!"

Saying this, he swung his fist towards Jian Wushuang.

Although nearly exhausted from hunger, Jian Wushuang had experiences from his mundane past, and his swordsmanship was quite agile.

Even without a sword in hand, a seven-foot-long stick could serve as a substitute.

A strike, not particularly forceful, hit the opponent's vital point, knocking the short and thin man unconscious on the ground.

Finally standing up, Jian Wushuang looked at the woman sobbing on the ground. He spoke gently, "Madam, is your home nearby?"

The woman didn't lift her head to look at him but pointed weakly down the alley.

"It's cold outside; let's go back," Jian Wushuang said, one hand grabbing the hair of the unconscious man and the other supporting the woman.

On the ground, there were two distinct trails left behind.

Having escorted the woman home, Jian Wushuang surveyed the dilapidated house before glancing at the short and skinny man he had in tow.

"Is there clean clothing available?" Jian Wushuang inquired.

The woman, now ceasing her tears, shifted her attention from her sobbing to the unconscious, scrawny man. The thought of him waking up tomorrow only to sell her again filled her heart with despair.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang's request for clothing, a flicker of hope crossed her mind. She retrieved a set of clean and tidy clothes from the worn-out wardrobe. Although patched in many places, the garments were remarkably soft, far superior to what Jian Wushuang was currently wearing.

"Here!" The woman handed the clothes to Jian Wushuang, and as she observed his appearance‚Äîthe towering stature, broad shoulders, and sharply defined features‚Äîshe couldn't help but feel a sense of lament. How could such a fine man be reduced to a beggar?

After changing into the fresh attire, Jian Wushuang took the opportunity to wash his grimy face. Finally resembling a presentable individual, he turned to the woman and spoke, "I'll take care of this man for you. Consider it payment for these clothes!"

It was evident that the two were a married couple. The skinny man's gambling habits had left them in destitution, and it was truly a hardship for them to end up in such a state while residing in what used to be an affluent neighborhood in the east of the city.

To prevent further harm caused by the gambler, Jian Wushuang had no choice but to mete out righteous punishment. It had been a while since he had taken matters into his own hands in such a manner.

Without waiting for a response, he dragged the unconscious man toward the exit.

The woman on the other side, how could she possibly harbor murderous intentions? It's not good to say too much about it.

Jian Wushuang dragged the man along, contemplating how to deal with this scum.

Killing a person, that's too simple.

But to kill someone and make others believe it's a suicide, that's crucial.

As they reached the corner, they noticed an abandoned ancient well along the wall.

Having an idea in mind, Jian Wushuang thought, it's normal for a drunkard to fall into a well on his way home late at night!

To prevent the man from waking up and falling in again, Jian Wushuang hoisted the thin man to the edge of the well. With a sudden force under his armpit, there was a crisp cracking sound, and he tossed the man down.

Splash!

The well had no water!

But it didn't matter; let's consider it a fatal fall.

Jian Wushuang clapped the snow off his hands, momentarily unsure of where to go next, shaking the three copper coins he had obtained from the thin man.

In the mundane world, three copper coins could buy a few steamed buns, but this late at night, besides some taverns, there were hardly any places selling anything.

Yet, with three copper coins, even a hot water drink in a tavern was unaffordable.

Jian Wushuang glanced at his own attire, covering the patches; he could pass for a normal person.

Thinking of this, he headed towards the tavern they had just passed.

Outside the house, heavy snowflakes were falling, and the biting cold wind pierced through the air.

Inside, however, it was warm as spring, accompanied by the aroma of delicious dishes.

Jian Wushuang crossed his arms, covering the patch on his chest with both hands. As soon as he entered, a quick-witted waiter approached.

"Sir, please come in!" The waiter bowed respectfully.

If the waiter knew that Jian Wushuang only had three copper coins on him, he might not have been so polite.

This time, he came for a free meal.

"This will do!" Jian Wushuang deliberately chose a seat near the window for easy escape.

The waiter didn't say much, wiped the chair, and after inviting Jian Wushuang to sit down, he respectfully asked, "Sir, what would you like to eat?"

"I'll have three pounds of cooked beef to eat here, cut another three pounds for takeout, and two pots of wine!"

Not only did he want to eat his fill this time, but he also had to plan for the next meal.

After the waiter left, Jian Wushuang put down his hands, glanced at the window, tapped it lightly; the paper and wood paste didn't seem very sturdy, but it should be fine.

The beef arrived quickly, freshly taken from the braising pot, emitting steam. Although Jian Wushuang was very hungry, he didn't devour the food to avoid arousing suspicion.

After taking a sip of wine, making sure no one was paying attention, he began to use his chopsticks, enjoying the oily feast.

With this in mind, he walked towards the restaurant he had just passed by.

Three catties of beef, an amount most people couldn't finish, but Jian Wushuang managed to eat to about 70 percent full.

Just as he finished, the waiter showed tactfulness and brought over a neatly packed portion wrapped in oil paper.

"Get me a bowl of beef soup too!" Jian Wushuang took the packed beef, wiped his mouth, and instructed.

The waiter didn't question and replied, "Sure thing!"

As the waiter disappeared from his sight, Jian Wushuang stuffed the packed beef into his arms, lifted it onto the table, and kicked it towards the window.

Although he was unmistakably an ordinary person, after eating his fill, his strength was not to be underestimated. With one kick, the window bore a hole, and through it, Jian Wushuang leaped out.

This commotion attracted the attention of many. All eyes turned towards the broken window, leaving only a chilly breeze whistling through the gap.

The innkeeper, dozing off behind the counter, was awakened by the loud noise, but Jian Wushuang was long gone.

The waiter who served Jian Wushuang, carrying a hot soup from the kitchen, stood still in shock.

It took a while for them to realize: someone had dined and dashed!

A few catties of beef were worth little, but with the broken window, the cost to repair it could buy ten catties of beef.
