Chapter 2672: Another Bet?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“That’s the... Evolving Sky Godly Staff?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen squinted his eyes as he recognized the staff.

There were all sorts of mystical weapons that suited various laws in the Ancient God Domain. The Hongjun Golden Sword that Jian Wushuang once controlled was a weapon suitable to be used with Space-time Law.

The Evolving Sky Godly Staff Wu Xin presented at this moment was also suitable for Space-time Law and was as well-known as the Hongjun Golden Sword.

The Evolving Sky Godly Staff immediately changed into a ray of golden-purple light under Wu Xin’s control as it travelled through the void toward Jian Wushuang.

That ray of golden-purple light travelled extremely fast, but the most crucial point was its equally strong power.

Jian Wushuang waved his Blood Mountain Sword and collided with the golden-purple light twice which forced his body to move slightly backwards after the collision.

“You are losing!” Wu Xin said with his cold voice as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

He admitted that Jian Wushuang’s laws perception was much stronger than himself. However, it was still within the manageable range.

Hum!

The golden-purple ray once again attacked Jian Wushuang with even more power than before.

“This is interesting.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently before also waving his hand.

A total of nine black-coloured Infernal Crimson Divine Swords appeared at the void in front of him and quietly floated.

“Go.” Those nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords turned into nine huge black holes upon Jian Wushuang’s finger-pointing before shockingly attacking the golden-purple ray. They met the golden-purple ray head-on within the blink of an eye and caused loud booming sounds.

Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!

Several muffled clunking noises were heard. Although the nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords had the number advantage, it was still repeatedly sent flying over by the golden-purple ray upon knocking into each other.

“It’s useless. Although your nine divine swords are quite powerful, their strength is too dispersed and not fast enough. Although I only have one Yantian Godly Staff, it’s enough to entirely crush you,” Wu Xin said.

“Really?” A playful smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face before he pointed his right hand again. “Swords, combine!”

Hum!!

The black holes formed from the nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords immediately overlapped each other as a vast Reincarnation Passage appeared out of nowhere. At the end of the Reincarnation Passage, a black divine sword covered in infinite Samsara Strength abruptly travelled outward.

This black divine sword had a sky-high aura and was extremely fast. It once again knocked into the golden-purple ray of light in the blink of an eye.

Clank!

It resulted in another huge explosive noise. However, the golden-purple light on the Evolving Sky Godly Staff had immediately turned dull upon that collision. The golden-purple light ray abruptly flew outward due to the collision while the black divine sword once again travelled outward as though it was unaffected.

Clank! Clank!

After another two head-on collisions, the light on the Evolving Sky Godly Staff was almost gone as its power was reduced to almost nothing.

“How’s this possible?” Wu Xin was shocked.

He had no idea that despite his Evolving Sky Godly Staff being strong, it was just a standard weapon generally found in the Ancient God Domain.

However, the extremely strong Transmigration Sword Formation shown by Jian Wushuang was created by Sword Lord Tong Xin. In addition, Jian Wushuang had an extremely high Transmigration Law understanding of having already reached the peak of the first stage and was not lower than Wu Xin’s Space-time Law understanding.

Both were law understanding where the Space-time Law was faster but its power fell short when being compared with Transmigration Law.

The most important point was Jian Wushuang’s Transmigration Sword Formation mastery being higher with frequent usage than Wu Xin’s Evolving Sky Godly Staff mastery.

It was natural for Jian Wushuang’s Transmigration Sword Formation to easily crush Wu Xin’s Evolving Sky Godly Staff with the combination of all those three points.

“Time for you to lose.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently before the black divine sword formed from the Transmigration Sword Formation once again exploded outward and directly hit Wu Xin’s divine body this time.

Jian Wushuang naturally did not use any strength as the black divine sword did not even break Wu Xin’s divine body defence.

However, the results of this battle had been decided upon arriving at this point.

“He... He’s lost?”

“Senior Brother Wu Xin lost?” The three Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples stood there in disbelief. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wu Xin was one of the publicly recognized top geniuses in the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion after all. His talents were sufficient for him to be in the top ten among all those Dragon Phoenix Pavilion geniuses. In addition, his realm was one level higher than Jian Wushuang. How could Wu Xin still lose under such circumstances when both parties were competing in the understanding of laws and principles?

“Transmigration Sword Formation. What Jian Yi just used should be the Transmigration Sword Formation, right?” The black-robed elder stared at Jian Wushuang with electrified eyes.

“Yes.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen nodded as he also recognized it.

“Congratulations to you, Brother Si Zhen. It’s been some time since such a clever genius appeared in your Sacred Palace,” said the black-robed elder.

“I’m just lucky... Just lucky.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen could only laugh.

Wu Xin gritted his teeth as he stared at Jian Wushuang somberly in the void in front of them. “Transmigration Law... Who knew you’ll have such a high understanding of the Transmigration Law apart from your Space-time Law understanding that has reached the peak of the first stage. In addition, you have such a powerful sword formation. My loss in this battle isn’t an injustice.”

Wu Xin was not a narrow-minded person.

He admitted both his defeat and also his law understanding not being as good as Jian Wushuang even though Jian Wushuang’s cultivation realm was a whole level lower than himself.

“Here’s five hundred Divine Elixir Pills.” Wu Xin flipped his hand and gave Jian Wushuang an Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang scanned the ring after receiving it as a calculative look flashed through his eyes.

He only received less than 200 Divine Elixir Pills. Although he made bets and won against the Ancient Witch and Leng Xing during the previous two battles, he only received 300 pieces of Divine Elixir Pills as the rest were replaced with precious items of the same value.

However, the five hundred Divine Elixir Pills he received from Wu Xin were ready-made Divine Elixir Pills as Wu Xin did not use any same-valued precious items to replace them. This made Jian Wushuang quite happy.

“Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples are really rich,” mumbled Jian Wushuang and suddenly rolled his eyes as an idea emerged from the bottom of his heart.

“Your name is Wu Xin, right?” Jian Wushuang once again looked towards Wu Xin.

“Yes.” Wu Xin nodded.

“You have an extremely high understanding of the law and are really talented. You must be one of the top geniuses in the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. You must be unreconciled with your loss today as we did only competed on laws and principles understanding without showing any of our other skills after all. Why don’t we make another bet?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Another bet?” Wu Xin turned and stared at Jian Wushuang.

The people around them also looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.
