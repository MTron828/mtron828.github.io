4623 Another Wave (2)

After listening to Supreme Xue Bo’s description, Jian Wushuang nodded. The army of Void Warriors that fled in panic should be the army that he had destroyed in the Rodu Star Field of the Qilin clan with one move.

After some small talk outside the base camp, everyone entered the camp.

The monstrous void power from before was no longer there. What replaced it was a quiet and ethereal divine power cloud.

Outside the deserted giant hall, the beautiful female disciples of the Divine Life Palace had planted all kinds of ancient grass and divine flowers, which made it look a little elegant in the solemn atmosphere. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang could only sit down after being welcomed by Supreme Xue Bo and the others.

At this point, the hundred people in the hall had been talking for nearly ten days.

Lu Ting and Lu Gong also gradually blended into the atmosphere.

They had a common goal, and they worked hard to achieve it, which made Lu Ting’s prejudice begin to blur.

It seemed that these guys could really die for the Divine Power Universe.

‘What a bunch of stupid guys,’ Lu Ting shook his head and sighed in his heart.

The discussion lasted for nearly 15 days, until Jian Wushuang finished his deployment.

He waved his hand and put away the scroll of divine power. After everyone began to walk to their respective chambers, the hall was already empty.

Jian Wushuang rubbed his eyes tiredly. In another day, the Divine Life Palace would start its counterattack and purge the remaining Void Warriors in the Divine Power Universe.

It had been tens of thousands of years since the Divine Power Universe had been declared fallen, and more than half of the Star Fields and Divine Kingdoms had been infiltrated by the Void Warriors.

It would also take a long time to get rid of them. Fortunately, the void power required by the Void Warriors could not be obtained in the Divine Power Universe, and their strength was also more or less affected.

The reason why Jian Wushuang had eliminated them first was that he was worried about Void God who had yet to return. He wanted to organize the Divine Power Universe as soon as possible before Void God broke through the seal.

“Husband, you must be tired. Quickly rest for a moment.” Leng Rushuang, who was dressed in a snow-white robe, walked out of the bedroom slowly with a bowl of medicine in her hand.

Jian Wushuang hurriedly got up and took the medicine. “It’s been hard on you, my love.”

Leng Rushuang shook her head gently and smiled. “As long as it’s for my husband, It’s not hard on me. Drink it while it’s hot.”

Jian Wushuang was slightly dazzled as he looked at the medicine in his hand that was emitting smoke.

“What’s wrong, husband? Do you feel uncomfortable somewhere? Quickly drink some medicinal soup to nourish your body,” Leng Rushuang said anxiously.

Jian Wushuang did not say much. He sat down with the medicine in his hand and did not rush to drink it.

“Aren’t you a little too impatient?” Jian Wushuang suddenly said indifferently.

Leng Rushuang was startled, but she still forced a smile. “What’s wrong, Husband?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head slowly, his eyes cold. “Who are you? how dare you pretend to be my wife?”

Leng Rushuang’s expression changed. She smiled eerily and ran away!

A vast amount of divine power surged like a huge wave and wrapped around the figure that was pretending to be Leng Rushuang.

Jian Wushuang send out a thought, and the divine power captured Leng Rushuang immediately.

Leng Rushuang, who had been captured, smiled eerily and said in a hoarse voice, “We meet again.”

As if the ice and snow had melted, he was the only one left in the vast hall, as if everything that had just happened was an illusion.

“There’s an enemy attack–”

Extremely miserable cries resounded from the battlefield and then stopped.

Jian Wushuang flew into a rage and his body instantly dashed out of the giant hall.

He saw that the dark, chaotic, and unordered battlefield outside the Offworld Battlefield had been completely occupied by the army of Void Warriors.

It was like a huge wave that rose up from the sky, mighty and intimidating!

With just a glance, Jian Wushuang knew that the number of Void Warriors surrounding the base camp was several times more than the number of Void Warriors surrounding Rodu, who was attacking the Qilin clan!

The sky-high void power suppressed the rules of divine power. Countless Void Masters had red eyes, waiting for an order to tear the base camp in the Offworld Battlefield into pieces.

Several divine power lights shot down to Jian Wushuang’s side, and they all looked solemn.

“Dammit! When did these bastards come, and where are the patrolling disciples?” Supreme Xue Bo bellowed in rage.

Jian Wushuang shook his head slowly. The disciples of the Divine Life Palace who were in charge of patrolling the periphery were at most at the Intermediate Supreme realm. In this long-planned battle, there were many Void Masters of the Six Scar level. How could they have prevented it?

At the front of the army, two figures in black robes appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Based on his intuition, Jian Wushuang felt that the figure who had pretended to be Leng Rushuang in the palace was one of the two mysterious figures.

“All disciples of the Divine Life Palace, hear my order.” Jian Wushuang’s deep voice reverberated throughout the entire base camp. “All of you who are at the Supreme realm, come forward with me to face the enemy. Disciples below the Supreme realm, retreat to the great hall, and fight to the death!”

Jian Wushuang was already determined to die!

All the disciples of the Divine Life Palace answered in unison. Those below the Supreme realm retreated to guard the great hall, while those above the Supreme realm followed Jian Wushuang to face the Offworld Battlefield together!

Lu Ting felt that he was very unlucky, and his resolute face was full of anger.

He had not even had time to drink a mouthful of hot tea when he encountered the invasion of the Void Universe. He was so anxious that he wanted to curse.

As the Second Prince of the Qilin clan, he was not going to die in his own clan’s battlefield. Instead, he was going to die in this desolate Offworld Battlefield?

He was unwilling, but his Sixth Brother’s eager expression made him even more depressed.

‘What should we do? Should we run now?’ This was what he thought, but he quickly rejected it.

Fleeing at the last minute, he probably would not even be able to take a single step before that Half Ancestor from his own camp would kill him.

There was no way out, so Lu Ting gritted his teeth and risked his life to catch up with Jian Wushuang.

A total of nearly 500 Supreme experts were suspended in the air. Facing the army of nearly 200,000 Void Warriors that covered the sky, they felt a little sad.

The chaotic astral wind was raging and Jian Wushuang’s hair was fluttering.

Old Master, who was wearing a black water robe, stood quietly behind Jian Wushuang like a statue.

Ninth Kalpa King was expressionless as before, but the divine power aura belonging to a Half Invincible Supreme was already at its peak.

Jun Fu, Tian Yi, Lan Lan, and Leng Rushuang pushed their divine power to the limit, ready to fight to the death!

The aura of a Half Ancestor began to surge around Supreme Xue Bo’s body, and this genuine aura made Lu Ting feel a little more at ease. After all, a Half Ancestor was an existence that had transcended the shackles of the world, and he could suppress an Invincible Supreme with a wave of his hand.

Lu Ting had already made up his mind. Once the battle started, he would pull Lu Gong along and follow behind Supreme Xue Bo.

Just as Lu Ting made up his mind, two vast void powers suddenly gushed out in front of the army of Void Warriors, causing his entire face to turn green.

It was the aura of two Half Ancestors!

Since when did Half Ancestors appear so easily everywhere?
