Chapter 1801: Give Me A Reason

For the battle in the Buddhist Demon Sea back then, Jian Wushuang had used all his tricks and also destroyed all his six stars. In the end, even with the King of Venomous Worms helping him to recover with its full power, he had still used a total of close to eight thousand years to recover completely.

This time around, although only two stars were destroyed, his abilities as a whole still increased greatly at once.

The moment two of his Ancient God Stars were destroyed, Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God Power skyrocketed. As for the lofty continent which was descending with a rumbling sound, its power also rose greatly.

Upon seeing the changes in the lofty continent, even Dao Yuanzi’s expression changed slightly.

“Looks like he has prepared to give his all. However, this is still not enough,” Dao Yuanzi laughed indifferently.

“Not enough? Then how about this?” Jian Wushuang’s voice turned heavy and an unusual power appeared from his body instantly.

This power was the Star Power!

Jian Wushuang’s strongest trump card, the Secret Skill of Star Palace, was unleashed abruptly at this moment.

Boom!

The universe shook. With the addition of the Star Power, the power of the lofty continent which was already extremely powerful to begin with rose a hundred times instantly!

The Third Move of the Nine-province Seal with a hundred times more power!

It was Jian Wushuang’s strongest attack. For this attack, Jian Wushuang even had the confidence that it could kill a top Emperor God!

As for Dao Yuanzi, who had always been extremely calm and collected, when he realized that the power of the lofty continent above him had increased by a hundred times, his expression finally changed.

“The Secret Skill of Seven Star!!”

“This is the Secret Skill of Seven Star of the Seven Star Black Sect!!”

“How is this possible?”

Dao Yuanzi was gasping with astonishment.

He had absolute confidence in his own abilities. Even if Jian Wushuang were stronger than him in terms of power, he did not care at all.

Even when Jian Wushuang took out the Mountain River Map and unleashed a powerful killing move, he could still be unconcerned as he could block it easily.

For example, he had blocked the Second Move of the Nine-province Seal easily.

As for the Third Move, it was still within his abilities to block it. However, if the power of such a move were to rise by a hundred times, it would be completely different.

He was no doubt an expert from the Ancient Past. However, in the end, his abilities had not recovered yet and there was a huge gap between them in terms of power. As for Jian Wushuang’s current attack, it relied completely on power to suppress him.

Moreover, such a power had also caused Dao Yuanzi to be terrified.

“I will be unable to guard against this attack!!!” Dao Yuanzi had already had such a thought.

“Jian Wushuang, please stop quickly. We shall call it a day here and from now on, we shall mind our own business; I will not kill anyone from your Green Fire World again!”

Dao Yuanzi’s voice, which was obviously filled with anxiety, resounded across the universe.

“What a joke!” Jian Wushuang was filled with murderous intent.

“If you were to really force me, after my abilities have recovered, I will definitely turn all the living beings in your Green Fire World into power!!” Dao Yuanzi continued shouting.

“Hmph, why not say that after you survive this attack of mine?” Jian Wushuang ignored him.

“Damn it!”

Dao Yuanzi’s expression changed greatly. As the lofty continent got closer and closer, he became even more frightened. Moreover, he had a strong feeling of death due to the incoming danger.

“Devil’s Heavenly Hand.”

With cracking sounds, a scarlet giant arm appeared from Dao Yuanzi’s body. The arm contained an enormous amount of demonic energy and it attacked with lightning speed with the intention of smashing the lofty continent which was descending into pieces.

Bam!

With a loud sound, the two attacks finally clashed head-on.

As soon as they clashed, a tremendous Divine Power storm was generated and it covered a range of a million miles.

Vast black holes then appeared continuously and they destroyed everything in the surrounding mercilessly.

As for the ground below them, it caved in completely.

It was the end of the world!

In a void which was extremely far away from the battlefield, many experts from the Green Fire Palace were looking at the scene in front of them with an unprecedented amount of shock.

The scene in front of them was really too frightening.

Within the range of a million miles, a huge amount of Divine Power was jumping about madly. The large number of experts from the Green Fire Palace all felt that if they were to step into the one million miles range, they would be sliced by the boundless Divine Power storm into pieces.

Such a shocking battle had completely exceeded the standards that the Green Fire World could achieve.

“Is Dao Yuanzi dead?”

Countless people were murmuring and they were all waiting for the results.

After a long time, the Divine Power storm which covered a range of a million miles finally subsided and everything dissipated.

On the battlefield, there were still two figures standing.

However, the only difference was that one of the figures still stood in the void while the other one had fallen into the underground and he was barely standing deep inside the underground.

“Damn it!”

Dao Yuanzi’s expression was ghastly pale and his body was filled with blood. He was in an extremely miserable state. At that moment, he was gritting his teeth tightly and his body was also shaking madly.

Swoosh!

The shadow in the void floated over slowly. Jian Wushuang’s ice-cold eyes were staring at Dao Yuanzi.

“Under such a kind of attack, you are still able to remain alive. As expected of an expert from the Ancient Past,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was ice-cold.

“Damn it. If not for me being seriously injured to begin with and the fact that I had only recovered to Early Stage Chaotic Realm, do you think that you would be able to defeat me?” Dao Yuanzi shouted furiously.

“Indeed, if you were at your peak where your abilities had recovered to the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm that you mentioned, in a situation where our powers are equally powerful, I would definitely be unable to do anything against you even if I were to use all my trump cards. However, it’s a pity as you will not have that opportunity,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. He then moved his legs and moved toward Dao Yuanzi slowly.

A shocking murderous intent also appeared from Jian Wushuang’s body slowly.

Upon seeing that, Dao Yuanzi’s eyes shrank violently. At the same time, he was also terrified.

During the clash moments ago, he was seriously injured by Jian Wushuang again. With him getting more injuries on top of his previous injuries, at that time, he was totally unable to unleash any more fighting capabilities. As for Jian Wushuang, although he had used his trump card, he still had an abundance of fighting capabilities. Hence, at that moment, it would be easy for Jian Wushuang to kill him.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s have a discussion,” Dao Yuanzi said immediately.

Jian Wushuang did not stop moving and his ice-cold voice spread to him, “Are you begging me to spare your life? Haha, give me a reason to not kill you.”

“A reason?” Dao Yuanzi was stunned. After thinking quickly, he said right away: “I am willing to surrender to you. In the future, I will follow all your orders. No matter what you want me to do, I will not say no to you. If you are not confident in me, you can leave a seal or a soul stamp in my body. In the future, I will absolutely not dare to go against you again.”

Jian Wushuang’s face was indifferent and he did not stop walking.

“Jian Wushuang, you should know that when I was at my peak, I reached the limit of the Chaotic Realm. If my abilities were to recover completely, I could definitely be of great help to you. In addition, I could even help you to govern this era so that you will be able to become this era’s strongest expert,” Dao Yuanzi said pressingly.

“Haha, even though you have stayed in the battlefield nearby for so many years and have also used so much energy as well as time to treat your wounds, you have merely recovered to Early Stage Chaotic Realm. Thus, who knows how long you will need to recover to your peak. If a day comes when your abilities have really recovered, then, even without you, I would still be able to stand at the peak of this era.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and his murderous intent did not decrease in the slightest.
