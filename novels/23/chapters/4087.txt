Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although it was unbelievable, Jian Wushuang did not doubt the authenticity of the news.

After all, he was ranked on the Nine Emperor List and had an extraordinary status. Director Feixue did not dare to lie to him, so there was no need for her to lie to him. The reason why she could send him a message to warn him was because he was ranked on the Nine Emperor List.

After understanding this, Jian Wushuang did not dare to think too much. He did not have the time to figure out what was going on.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and the pitch-black universe boat immediately appeared in the void in front of him.

“Shuang ‘er, Devil Flame, quickly enter the universe boat,” Jian Wushuang said.

!!

“Husband, what’s wrong?” Leng Rushuang looked over in confusion.

“Don’t ask so many questions. Go in quickly,” Jian Wushuang urged.

Leng Rushuang did not ask any more questions. She immediately entered the universe boat with Devil Flame.

“Eighth, you should go in as well,” Jian Wushuang said.

Eighth nodded slightly and entered the universe boat.

When the three of them entered the universe boat, Jian Wushuang willed the universe boat in front of him to shrink again and put it into his arms.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang immediately got up and prepared to escape.

But just as he was about to move…

Boom!

The world shook and a suffocating and terrifying power was transmitted from the void above.

“Oh no!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed drastically. He subconsciously looked up and saw that the entire world had become completely dark. Endless darkness was slowly crushing down. If one looked carefully, there were huge gullies in the darkness, it was as if they were the lines of a palm.

“Could this endless darkness be a palm?” Jian Wushuang thought in horror.

It was indeed the case.

Jian Wushuang was now in the Dusty Rain Star World, so he naturally could not see clearly what the endless darkness that covered the top void was.

However, if he was in the cosmic void outside the Dusty Rain Star World, he could see that what covered the Dusty Rain Star World was a hand, a huge, endless black hand.

This gigantic black hand had already completely covered the entire Dusty Rain Star World, and it held the Dusty Rain Star World in its palm.

Immediately after, this gigantic black hand exerted a slight force, and just like crushing a bean, a level two Star World was directly crushed and exploded.

The Dusty Rain Star World instantly exploded, and the countless mountains and rivers within the Star World were all crushed and crushed into pieces. Countless living beings were instantly buried, and they did not have any chance to struggle at all.

In the void outside the Star World, a cold man with a pitch-black saber on his back stood there coldly. He stared at the void in front of him and watched the Star World explode and turn into cosmic dust.

The giant hand just now was cast by the cold man.

The cold man was called Devour Nine. He was one of the three supreme-beings who had arrived in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy and was on a killing spree. He was the supreme-being who had come to capture Jian Wushuang.

“Huh?”

The cold man’s expression suddenly changed. As a supreme-being expert, his soul perception was far superior to that of a Ruler. After the Dusty Rain Star World collapsed, he immediately sensed that all the living beings in the Dusty Rain Star World had been annihilated.

However, only one person had survived, and the aura he emitted was that of a third-level Ruler.

“Is he the target?” The cold man’s eyes turned cold, and he dashed forward.

In the void in front of the cold man, an ancient universe boat had appeared. Jian Wushuang was in the universe boat, and he was controlling the universe boat to flee as fast as he could. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As he fled, Jian Wushuang saw the cold man chasing after him, and his eyes were full of fear and shock.

“Supreme!”

“The supreme is here!”

Jian Wushuang never thought that he would meet a supreme-level expert so early.

And apparently, this supreme did not just happen to meet him. He probably came straight for him.

After all, when Supervisor Feixue sent the message just now, he also said that the group of people who started a massacre in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy and wanted to completely destroy the Nine Luminaries Galaxy might have many experts, but those at the paragon level…there were only a few supreme-level experts.

However, the Nine Luminaries Galaxy was huge, and there were many Star Worlds. There should be at least a hundred second-level Star Worlds, not to mention others?

How could there be a supreme-level expert who happened to come to his Star World?

Therefore, Jian Wushuang guessed that the supreme-level expert’s target was him.

As for the reason…Jian Wushuang could only think of one possibility from the way these people acted. It was related to his Ruler, Xuan Yi!

“These people should be here for my Ruler. They destroyed the Thunder God Palace. They must have learned of my existence from the palace, so they also came to deal with me.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, his expression was extremely grave.

“Darling, are you okay?” Leng Rushuang looked at Jian Wushuang with worry because she saw that Jian Wushuang’s body was covered in blood and his aura was much weaker than before.

“I’m fine.” Jian Wushuang shook his head, but he was very shocked.

Just now, the cold man had crushed the Dusty Rain Star World, killing countless creatures in it.

Jian Wushuang was also in the Dusty Rain Star World, so the cold man’s attack had also affected him. Although it only slightly affected a part of his power, the one who had attacked was a supreme expert. In that instant..! Even though Jian Wushuang had an incredible protective ability, his divine body was immediately severely injured, and nearly 30 percent of his divine power was destroyed!

Nearly 30 percent of his divine power barely affected him.

In other words, if the supreme expert had only attacked him, he would have been killed in one move.

“This is the strength of a supreme expert. It’s indeed terrifying.” Jian Wushuang was shocked, and his eyes were fixed on the cold man who was chasing after him.

The cold man did not take out his universe boat, but he was an supreme-level expert. Even if he flew by himself, his speed in the universe void was not much slower than that of universe boat.

Jian Wushuang would not be very worried if he continued to chase and escape. However, universe boat did not travel far before Jian Wushuang sensed an extremely powerful aura ahead of him.

Although this aura was not that of an supreme-being, it was definitely at the level of an Ultimate Ruler.

“Oh no.” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

When he sensed the aura of an Ultimate Ruler in front of the universe boat, Jian Wushuang immediately understood that the other party had long planned to encircle and kill him.

The supreme-being who had attacked him must have thought that he had escaped from the Dusty Rain Star World, so he had already arranged for an Ultimate Ruler to intercept him in the surrounding void.

“I have no choice but to fight.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. The Wuqi Divine Sword had already appeared in his hand.
