Chapter 354: Sword Scar

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

News of the outstanding fight between Jian Wushuang and Second Holy Master raged throughout the whole Nanyang Continent.

Everyone had heard the story of Jian Wushuang’s rise.

However, the hero had not returned to Tianzong Dynasty after he defeated Second Holy Master.

Instead, he went to the abyss in the Innumerable Huge Mountains, near Tianzong Dynasty.

At the abyss in the Innumerable Huge Mountains, which was known as the forbidden area. Few went there, so they didn’t know that there was a secret hidden there.

Jian Wushuang jumped directly towards the bottom of the abyss.

After arriving at the Ancestor’s Land again, Jian Wushuang immediately saw Jin Ling and Mu Shan.

“Jian Wushuang, here you are again.” Jin Ling looked at Jian Wushuang coldly, then her expression changed as she said, “Divine Transcendence?”

She noticed his tranquil breath, which only a Saint Realm expert could have.

“How long has it been?” Both Jin Ling and Mu Shan were shocked.

It had been less than two years since he left Ancestor’s Land last time.

At that time, Jian Wushuang had just reached the Peak of the Yin Void Realm with the help of the Ancestor’s Land. However, now he had reached Divine Transcendence.

What a terrifying level of improvement!

“I came here to take the second trial of the Ancestor’s Land,” Jian Wushuang said openly.

Jin Ling took a deep look at Jian Wushuang, nodded, then said, “Follow me.”

She led Jian Wushuang to a small one-story loft.

“The second trial is inside, go in,” Jin Ling said.

Jian Wushuang stepped inside without a second thought.

It was an open space, with a stone tablet and a statue standing at the center.

Jian Wushuang once saw a similar stone tablet in the Sword Tomb, and there was also a sword scar on it.

The sword scar was smooth and flat.

Seeing the sword scar, Jian Wushuang felt how extraordinary it was.

The statue seemed ordinary and lifeless, but Jian Wushuang knew it was a powerful Puppet Fighter.

Suddenly, Jin Ling’s voice reverberated.

“Jian Wushuang, have you seen the sword scar on the stone tablet? It was left by Sword Ancestor, and it contains a Sword Skill. What you need to do is master it in one month.”

“One month!”

“The time started counting when you stepped inside. The door has closed and will not open until you master it.”

“There is also a Puppet Fighter near the stone tablet. It will wake up in a month, and if you haven’t come out by the time it wakes up, you will definitely be killed.”

After saying that, Jin Ling’s voice vanished from the loft.

Looking at the sword scar, Jian Wushuang’s eyes began glittering with excitement.

“Is there a Sword Skill in it?”

Jian Wushuang carefully looked at the sword scar with a flicker of curiosity.

Such an abstruse scar. Jian Wushuang understood most of it, but he could not fully understand it for now.

“This is a tyrannical and mysterious Sword Skill!” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He understood why Jin Ling said that he couldn’t pass the second trial if he hadn’t reached Divine Transcendence.

It’s because the Sword Skill was too hard to understand for an ordinary Yin-Yang Void Realm warrior. If one forced himself to study it, they would probably go mad.

Only Saint Realm experts were qualified to study it.

Jian Wushuang sat down immediately and started meditating on the Sword Skill.

Outside the loft, Jin Ling and Mu Shan stood together, side by side.

“One month is neither long nor short. Do you think he can pass it?” Mu Shan said.

“Hard to say.” Jin Ling shook his head secretly.

They knew clearly how tough the second trial was. It was much tougher than the first one.

Both of them were tests for martial talent. The first trial offered guidance while the second one could only be understood by oneself.

Most importantly, it was the work of the Sword Ancestor!

Who was he! He created it himself, and even though it might not be the most powerful, it was still a strong Sword Skill.

Even many Saint Realm experts who had good swordsmanship couldn’t fully master it after studying for decades. Jian Wushuang only had one month. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Wait and see. He is no less talented than his father, so it’s possible for him to pass,” Jin Ling said.

They could do nothing for Jian Wushuang, they could only wait outside.

Time passed...

Kuang! The door opened and Jian Wushuang walked out slowly.

Jin Ling and Mu Shan turned to Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

“How it could be?”

“It’s only been three days!”

Jin Ling and Mu Shan were shocked.

Three days!

Yes, they had only waited outside for three days.

He could leave the loft after he mastered the Sword Skill and passed the second trial.

Only three days?

“Sorry to have kept you waiting,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, then walked over to Jin Ling and Mu Shan.

“How, how could you?” Jin Ling stared at Jian Wushuang in astonishment, “It was created by the Sword Ancestor. A normal Saint Realm warrior could spend their whole life trying to master it. Even though you have awakened Sword Soul and have a high degree of talent, it’s impossible for you to master it in only three days.”

“Em...”

Jian Wushuang touched his nose shyly. The Sword Skill was abstruse, but he had smoothly mastered it in only three days.

“Maybe I should thank my Sword Souls.”

While he was busy speaking, the two Sword Souls from his sea of consciousness surged behind Jian Wushuang.
