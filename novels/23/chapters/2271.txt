2272 Invincible!

Invincible!

“It’s happening,” Bing Shan’s pupils shrank as he sensed the change at Heaven’s Horizon. He roared, “The link passage is about to open, don’t waste any more time!”

The surrounding Ancient Era experts could sense the change at Heaven’s Horizon as well.

After listening to Bing Shan’s roar, the Ancient Era experts’ gazes became more fierce.

“Use all your trump cards to take him down!”

“Give it your all!”

Ancient Era experts had no intention to hold back anymore.

Those Absolute Beginning Divine World Ancient Era experts had all been very strong during their pinnacle and had many tricks behind their sleeve.

They may not have gone that far if they were fighting normally under the restrictions. But things were different now that they had decided to give it their all.

The remaining Ancient Era experts had started giving it their all.

Strong auras started emerging – many Ancient Era experts had started using secret skills.

Some even spewed blood essence to boost their powers.

Trump cards were being used one by one.

Soon, the Ancient Era experts made their move.

One by one, they displayed their trump cards.

“Solidifying Blood Divine Finger!

“God Slayer Spear!”

“Nanyin Divine Light!”

“Sanguis, Daemon Interfectum!”

Terrifying attacks were coming in from all directions.

They were all so much stronger than the ones Jian Wushuang had endured.

This was the Ancient Era experts trying their very best. Every attack was outrageously strong.

Jian Wushuang stood at the centre of the Void as he felt the waves of attack heading towards him. He could only block a few, but the rest swallowed him like a tsunami.

Hong long long ~~

A terrifying roar resonated across the earth, along with a strong Divine Power storm.

The vast Void along the Heaven’s Horizon was completely surrounded by the Divine Power storm.

Far from the battlefield, the Eternal Chaotic World Great Emperors were all dumbfounded by the sight.

“That’s too terrifying!”

“Those Ancient Era experts could all demonstrate Third Stage Great Emperor abilities if they all use their trump card.”

“Sword Emperor, will he make it?”

The Eternal Chaotic World Great Emperors had full confidence in the Sword Emperor and Emperor Bai.

Based on their understanding, they were invincible.

But now, they were not so sure.

At that moment... they could still see a figure at the centre of the battlefield.

It was Jian Wushuang, and he was dissipating.

He had collapsed!

Jian Wushuang’s holy body had completely collapsed.

“This...” Eternal Chaotic World Great Emperors were all stunned.

The Ancient Era experts were all elated.

“Is he dead?” The Ancient Era experts heaved a sigh of relief. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Jian Wushuang was only a Chaotic Realm expert, but they had stressed out the Ancient Era experts pretty well.

But now, after the Ancient Era experts had all teamed up and given it their best, Jian Wushuang had finally succumbed to the attacks.

“Looks like he’s dead.” Bing Shan held his hands together as he stared at the battlefield.

“Don’t get too excited.” Leng Ruxue smiled.

“Huh?” Bing Shan was confused.

Jian Wushuang’s holy body had already collapsed, what else could happen?

As the Divine Power storm dissipated, the earth slowly calmed down.

Jian Wushuang was no longer in the spot where he had used to be. He must have collapsed under the attack of all the Ancient Era experts.

And that was the case. Under the attack of so many experts, collapsing was the only way it would end.

But did it mean that Jian Wushuang was dead?

The next moment, Weng~~~~

Large amounts of Divine Power was condensing at that Void.

After a moment, a perfectly intact figure reappeared.

Jian Wushuang was still holding his sword, his aura unhindered.

“How is that possible?”

“We destroyed his holy body.”

The Ancient Era experts were dumbfounded.

They saw his body collapse, but at the very next moment, his body reformed.

And he was still uninjured.

This ability...

“He has the Body of Undying!”

Chen Qi, who had fought against Jian Wushuang once, said, “I searched through Emperor Bai and Sword Emperor’s information. Both of them are Inverse Cultivators and had their holy bodies collapse before. Now it is apparent – they are undying!”

“Body of Undying?”

The Ancient Era experts froze.

Body of Undying was a power only Undying Saints could attain in the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

It was a terrifying ability, the best life-saving means around.

They had all witnessed Undying Saints collapsing then reforming.

But those were Undying Saints. Jian Wushuang was only a Chaotic Realm, how could he have possessed Undying Saint abilities?

How was that possible?

“Body of Undying!” Bing Shan froze as well.

He knew how terrifying the Body of Undying was – he had it himself. Unfortunately, under the restrictions, he could not use it at all. But Jian Wushuang, a Chaotic Realm rascal, had the Body of Undying and was restricted by the formation that bound the earth at all.

“Now I know why you said those Chaotic Divine Demons would not kill Sword Emperor,” Bing Shan looked deep into Leng Ruxue’s eyes.

The latter smiled.

She had witnessed Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai reforming before. She knew they had the Body of Undying.

With superb skills and Bodies of Undying, Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang were invincible in those lands!
