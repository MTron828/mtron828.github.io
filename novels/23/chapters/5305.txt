Karma cycles, following the will of heaven.

Fruits of karma, evil consequences, causal relationships.

He had taken control of what he could, and the causal relationships were manageable. Shan Jun had assisted him without demanding much, and back when Xuan Yi and Old Master had helped, they also had few requirements.

However, the power of karmic fruits was continuously growing, and it had to be eradicated before advancing in the Dao.

As for evil consequences!

This was related to his strength. Once he broke through to the seventh level of the Extreme Dao, mastering the power of all things, he would be able to escape the evil consequences of the power of Devour.

All three had solutions, yet they were extremely difficult.

Jian Wushuang shook his head silently, deciding not to dwell on it for now. Returning was the priority.

From Yang Sanmu, he had gained a rough understanding of the Four Major Secret Realms. He couldn’t help but feel excited. He hadn’t expected that an ancient continent still existed. After the trials ended and he entered the core, he vowed to explore it thoroughly.

“Senior, how many experts are there in these secret realms?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but ask.

According to Yang Sanmu, the Four Major Secret Realms were vast, comparable to half the size of the universe. Their existence spanned longer than the birth of the universe itself, with the oldest inheritances and various geniuses and treasures.

The experts here were likely several times more powerful than those born in the Original Universe.

Jian Wushuang had seen the list of gods and demons in the universe. The original universe alone had tens of thousands of Emperors, and even though the tier 5 Emperors had mostly gone to the River of Time, there were still dozens remaining.

That didn’t even account for the missing ones.

The old man with horns seemed visibly stunned at the question.

Since settling in the Elderly Palace, he hadn’t had the chance to review the records sent by the White Tiger Temple about powerful individuals. However, based on his past experiences in the Four Major Secret Realms, he made a rough estimate.

Just the experts in the Northern Region of the Heaven Secret Realmalone were much stronger than those in the Original Rniverse. There might be a numerical difference, but in terms of quality, they undoubtedly held the advantage.

The Original Universe had countless Grand Yan Immortals, surpassing even the Northern Region or the entire Heaven Secret Realm.

However, it lacked in terms of Emperors. The tier 6 Emperors, mentioned by the old man with the goat’s horns, were numerous, a luxury the Original Universe did not possess—a universe without a single tier 6 Emperor.

Certainly, in the Original Universe, there was an Ultimate Emperor, and the entire Qishen Temple lacked such an Ultimate Emperor.

If there was one, it was probably slumbering in the Divine Tomb.

An Ultimate Emperor was more crucial than several tier 6 Emperors combined!

Especially that Ultimate Emperor, who was on the verge of reaching the peak. Crossing the tier 6 was just a matter of time, with Zhen Ling personally guiding the way.

Martial prowess wasn’t the urgent matter; the critical aspects were the secrets of the universe and one’s own origin source. Once these two breakthroughs occurred, reaching the pinnacle would only be a matter of time.

After hearing the explanation from the old man with goat horns, Jian Wushuang nodded.

The Qishen Temple was much more formidable than he had imagined, but he still had a question.

Why did the Qishen Temple have so many powerful beings, yet they went through such great lengths to recruit inheritors from the Original Universe?

In his opinion, recruiting an ultimate Emperor would have sufficed. Casting a wide net to catch few fish seemed wasteful.

“Haha!”

Goat Three-Eyes laughed upon hearing Jian Wushuangs confusion.

“Youngster, it’s a bit challenging for you. There are some things you don’t understand now, but you will in the future. Remember, innate talent can never

surpass predestination. The cultivators in the Qishen Temple are all born with postnatal advantages.”

Jian Wushuang found the explanation a bit confusing, but the last sentence stuck with him.

Was his postnatal physical body truly weaker than those innate beings?

Maybe not now, but it might not be the case in the future.

Aren’t the Beast Gods strong enough? Yet, they were still killed by the Qishen, refined into treasures.

Who dares to say that Qishen is not powerful?

After chatting for a while, a middle-aged man in a yellow Daoist robe, with a tall crown and a wax-yellow complexion, walked out of a spatial crack.

The moment he emerged, Jian Wushuang felt a powerful pressure, rendering his entire body immobile.

“Are you Jian Wushuang?” The newcomer was Wu Zuo, who had just seen off Shan Jun.

“Jian Wushuang pays respects to Senior,” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly.

Wuz Zo eased the pressure. Zhen Ling instructed that this guy must be safely returned to the Original Planet, and he didn’t dare to bully the small.

Now, among the Qishen Temple, the most valued were these inheritors. Although he felt somewhat dissatisfied, he didn’t dare to act recklessly.

Cultivating in peace, those days had just passed, and now he had to be honest.

Moreover, when he sent Shan Jun into the Second Prison, Shan Jun instructed him to take care of the little guy on Demon Sound Mountain.

Although their relationship was ordinary, the five Demon Lords had once been glorious together, a united front.

Giving face to Shan Jun was giving face to the other four.

He knew that besides Shan Jun and the Heart Demon being sent to prison, the remaining ones had done well in the Qishen Temple, especially that Wind

Demon and Myriad Demon. They had become prominent figures by Zhen Lings side.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t be so nervous. The trial on the Original Planet still has two days left. Are you planning to go back now or stay here on Yuanyang Lake?” Wu Zuo asked.

Jian Wushuang was relieved to hear that he could stay and look around.

On the side, Yang Sanmu patted his shoulder, gave him a look, and said, “Thank you, Brother Wu Zuo!”

“Thank you, Lord Wuzuo!”

“Don’t thank me. These two days, Brother Yang will take Jian Wushuang to explore Yuanyang Lake. I will personally send you back when you leave,” Wu Zuo said.

As soon as he finished speaking, a snake as thick as a water tank shot out. Wu Zuo stood on the snake’s head, glanced at Jian Wushuang, especially at the faint green board on Jian Wushuangs thumb. His eyes narrowed to a point, but he didn’t dare to ask more. He disappeared in the same place.

Jian Wushuang, who stood up straight, had a strange look in his eyes.

He could feel that his luck seemed to have changed. Shan Jun helped him because they were of the same kind.

Wu Zuo took great care of him, probably because of the board.

The overflow of this board’s power might be showing now, and he had underestimated it before.

The person just now must have seen the board, recognized it as an artifact of Qishen, and thus took care of him and allowed him to stay here.

Yang Sanmu, standing on the side, was also somewhat surprised. Usually arrogant Wu Zuo, this time, was unexpectedly approachable, even letting Jian Wushuang stay here.

It seemed that the Zhen Ling hadn’t specifically instructed anything!

He only said to send Jian Wushuang back to the Original Realm intact.

Perhaps Wu Zuo was too cautious, Yang Sanmu speculated.

“Senior Yang, who was that Lord Wu Zuo just now?” Jian Wushuang cautiously inquired now that the threat had completely receded.

The strength of the person just now was formidable, at least stronger than any Emperor he had encountered, and not inferior to Shan Jun.

“Him?” Yang Sanmu!s eyes carried a reminiscing color, slowly saying, “He is a disciple of Qishen, the only disciple still alive, a tier 6 powerhouse!”

Disciple of Qishen?

Jian Wushuang was greatly shocked!

No wonder he recognized the board on his thumb. Even Yang Sanmu, the old man with horns, was unaware of this treasure.
