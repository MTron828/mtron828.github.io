4267 The Battle of All Sides

The 16th city had been completely reduced to a battlefield.

Explosions kept coming from the void, and the earth was in a mess. From time to time, one could see the Ultimate Rulers fall.

This scene was extremely spectacular. The Ultimate Ruler, who could dominate a region in the outside world, was like a cabbage on the street in the sixteenth city, worthless.

Jian Wushuang and Moluo Yangu stood opposite each other while the other members of the Moluo clan guarded the side. They seemed to have a tacit understanding to prevent the flames of war from spreading over and affecting the battle between Jian Wushuang and Moluo Yangu.

Jian Wushuang could feel that the aura of Moluo Yangu was much stronger than when he was in the Eighth City. The boy, Hei Teng, who was sitting on his shoulder, had changed from his pale face to a solemn one. He was like a reincarnated Buddha, full of holy intent.

“Split open the sky!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and no longer concealed his aura. The aura of the fourth level origin of sword principle burst out and the sharp sword essence shot up to the sky, as if it could break the sky!

A blood-red sword light condensed on the Wuqi Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand. It drew a beautiful arc in the air and slashed toward Moluo Yangu!

What rang out were the wails of gods and devils, and the low groans of Buddhas!

“Good!”

A glint flashed across Moluo Yangu’s eyes. He roared in anger and stomped his right foot heavily on the ground!

“Moluo trampling!!!”

Boom!

Immediately, an extremely violent force gushed out, and the entire earth began to tremble and split. A vibrating light wave spread out like a halo.

At this moment, countless Ultimate Rulers who were fighting around the two of them could not help but spring up. Some of the weaker ones even had their divine bodies instantly collapse.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the middle of the light wave, could not help but frown. This move was once again used by Moluo Yangu and it was several times stronger than before.

“Suppress!”

Jian Wushuang stomped his right foot heavily and the divine power in his entire body instantly gushed out. He resisted the waves of shock waves that swept over wave after wave.

At the same time, the heaven-opening sword light that Jian Wushuang had released earlier had already landed on Moluo Yangu’s body.

In the past few years, not only had Moluo become stronger, but Jian Wushuang had also not wasted any time. His power had also improved greatly.

Bang!

The sky-opening sword radiance instantly slashed down on the right arm of Moluo Yangu, forcing him to take a few steps back. A trace of dark golden blood seeped out from his arm.

He looked down at his arm and then looked up at Jian Wushuang with a touch of admiration in his eyes. He said, “Blood Sword, I have to say that you’re the most powerful Sword Master I’ve ever met. If it wasn’t for Heavenly Snake, you would have become the best friend of my Moluo clan.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. From the bottom of his heart, he had a good impression of this Moluo Yangu. Although he was his enemy, he did things in an open and aboveboard manner. He did not take advantage of the fact that there were other Moluo clansmen here to bully others.

“Enough nonsense, let’s fight to our heart’s content!”

Universe law, tenfold willpower!

Jian Wushuang laughed loudly. He did not hold back his divine power and released it all. Along with the tenfold will power given to him by the laws of the universe, he slashed out thousands of sword Qi like a splash of ink.

Seeing this, Moluo Yangu laughed out loud. A huge force gathered in his arms and he punched Jian Wushuang!

“Alright, Blood Sword! After this battle, if you and I can both survive, I’ll definitely invite you to drink to your heart’s content!”

The two of them instantly engaged in battle. Waves of destructive power and sword intent that tore the sky intertwined and collided, exploding into brilliant sparks on the battlefield of the 16th city!

Jian Wushuang felt extremely carefree and his attacks became fiercer.

At this moment, the entire battlefield of the 16th city was already in a state of chaos. gradually, as the Ultimate Ruler fell, some people began to stand out! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Almsgiver, the Buddha is merciful. Please do not commit the sin of murder again.”

There was a strange Rabbit Buddha with a rabbit head in a blood-red cassock. His expression was solemn, and his eyes were filled with compassion, as if he was pitying the people of the world.

In the next moment, he waved the Buddhist staff in his hand and directly smashed the head of an expert who was close to an invincible Ruler!

“Sigh, this poor monk has saved another killing sin. Buddha is merciful.” He let out a soft sigh and continued to walk toward the other Ultimate Ruler.

The surrounding Ultimate Rulers’ eyes began to twitch.

This guy was telling them to kill less while he was smashing other people’s divine bodies. In just a few minutes, the number of Ultimate Rulers that had died at his hands could not be counted with two hands.

“Where did this abnormal person come from?” Everyone was terrified.

On the other side, a handsome young man wearing a snow-white robe and a snow-white vest on his left shoulder with a pale blue crescent moon between his eyebrows slashed out with a thin blade in his hand. Waves of blade light flashed continuously, and the area within a hundred feet of him had been completely turned into a dead land.

“He…I think he’s The Fiend Blade, Moonslayer!”

“Moonslayer? The god of death who once slaughtered the three major galaxies?”

“Why is he here!”

Further away.

It was extremely close to the center of the God Sealing Tablet area.

The Golden Crow Prince and the dark devil’s descendant continued to fight!

The Golden Crow Prince’s eyes had already turned into golden flames. As he swung the two tridents in his hands, they brought with them the power to burn the world. One after another, apocalyptic fire dragons roared out from the tridents, burning the void.

“A dirty and pitiful worm that only deserves to live in the abyss. You are so lowly. Do you think you are worthy of stopping me?” The Golden Crow Prince looked down at the dark demon descendant with an indifferent expression.

The dark demon descendant waved his giant axe in the air and hacked the fire dragon into pieces. He had a pair of huge blood wings on his back and a river of blood flowed under his feet.

The next moment.

He twisted his neck, making a cracking sound, and then laughed in a low voice, “Put away your disgusting sense of superiority and obediently die!”

“Roar!”

He stomped his right foot heavily and his entire body shot up into the sky. The giant axe in his hand instantly glowed brightly as he hacked down toward Emperor Golden Crow!

“Hmph,” he snorted.

The Golden Crow Prince snorted coldly, squinted his eyes and shouted, “Innate divine ability, eye of the burning flame!”

Whoosh!

At the center of his brows, a golden vertical eye suddenly opened!

…

The battle was getting more and more intense, and the dark mass of Ultimate Rulers that had blotted out the sky was rapidly being reduced in number.

Those who were still fighting on the battlefield were all supreme Ultimate Rulers.

Han Feng, Mountain Shaker, and the other five commanders attacked bloodrein together. Bloodrein was not at a disadvantage even though he was facing five people.

“The Blood Sword…”

After the battle, Commander Mountain Shaker turned to look at Jian Wushuang, who was fighting with Moluo Yangu, and a hint of worry flashed in his eyes.
