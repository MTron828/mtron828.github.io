Chapter 3084: Full Power

___________________________

“Stop immediately? No need, just show me whatever you have. I hope you can give me a surprise.” Jian Wushuang looked at Xiong Tao expectantly.

Until now, he was really excited and excited.

This kind of excitement rarely appeared on cultivators of the same level.

This was the first time in his life!

“As you wish.”

Xiong Tao spoke softly, but his eyes turned completely cold in the next moment.

“Golden mountain staff!”

Boom!

Xiong Tao struck out with the staff.

It was a golden long staff, but at this moment, the golden long staff was wildly enlarged. In the blink of an eye, it formed a towering golden mountain.

This golden mountain contained a terrifying power. The moment it was smashed out, the surrounding people, including Bai Xiao, were all shocked.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and burst out his divine power. The Blood Mountain Sword turned into a blood-red thunderbolt.

Bang!

With a loud sound, the golden mountain was sent flying.

“It’s not over yet. The second strike!”

Xiong Tao shouted in a low voice, and the ‘lofty’ golden mountain, which was sent flying, struck fiercely again.

In terms of speed and power, it was much stronger than the first strike.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “Interesting!”

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The golden long stick turned into a towering golden mountain and smashed at Jian Wushuang again and again.

The power of the long stick became stronger and stronger each time.

When it reached the seventh stick, the power contained in the towering golden mountain had definitely reached the level of a rank four True Saint.

However, as the long staff struck out again, the power continued to surge.

“Haha, awesome, awesome, again!”

Jian Wushuang let out a wanton laugh. The strength in his hand continued to increase as he collided with the golden long staff again and again.

The eighth staff, the ninth staff, the tenth staff!

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao had collided 13 times, and Xiong Tao had also used the 13th staff.

The power contained in the golden long staff had long frightened Bai Xiao and the others. Even the two rank four True Saints behind Duan Yu were shocked.

“Is this really the power of a rank one True Saint?”

A purple-haired elder among the two rank four True Saints could not help exclaiming.

“Yes, it was indeed unleashed by a rank one True Saint. However, this power is too strong, too strong! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“The other rank four True Saint…it was a thin and weak-looking woman dressed in black. The eyes of this woman also flickered with thick shock.

“I am a genuine rank four True Saint after all. Moreover, I came from the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion, so my techniques aren’t weak. However, the staff technique that Xiong Tao is using right now actually makes me feel like I can’t resist it!”

“I have the same feeling.” The purple-haired elder nodded heavily. “Xiong Tao’s staff technique is continuously accumulating power over and over again. When he collides head-on with his opponent, he can also continuously increase the power of his staff technique. The first staff technique that he used previously and the thirteenth staff technique that he’s using now are two completely different concepts. I can easily block that first staff technique, but when it comes to the thirteenth staff technique…”

“Even if I use all my strength to display my strongest move, I might not be able to match this power. However, if I were to really fight with him, I would definitely not give him the chance to display the thirteenth staff.”

“Yes, although his staff technique is powerful, if he had observed the characteristics of the staff technique in advance and used brute force to break his staff technique earlier, he would not have been able to display the thirteenth staff. However, the Heavenly Sword Marquis who is fighting with him…”

“The Heavenly Sword Marquis should have also noticed the uniqueness of Xiong Tao’s staff technique. However, he didn’t do that from the beginning to the end. Instead, he allowed Xiong Tao’s staff technique to gather strength and increase its power. The most terrifying thing is that even though Xiong Tao’s staff technique has already gathered the strength to the thirteenth staff technique, and even we couldn’t block it, he was able to block it head-on?”

The two rank four True Saints looked at each other in shock.

They were shocked by Xiong Tao’s staff skills, but they were even more shocked by Jian Wushuang!

Even they did not dare to let Xiong Tao continue accumulating strength, but Jian Wushuang dared to block it head-on?

How terrifying was this?

“Look, Xiong Tao has used the 14th staff skill again!” The purple-haired elder suddenly exclaimed.

In the center of the battlefield, after Jian Wushuang received Xiong Tao’s 13th move, Xiong Tao immediately used the 14th move again.

Boom! Boom!

The heaven and earth began to shake wildly as if they could not withstand the power contained in the golden long stick.

Boom!

With a loud sound, the golden long stick fell down instantly.

Endless power surged toward Jian Wushuang in an instant.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled. With a whoosh, the Blood Mountain Sword slashed out in anger.

Bang!

It was another fierce confrontation, and this time, Jian Wushuang was sent flying from the front.

After a while, he stopped again, but his aura was still very stable.

“Haha, awesome, again!” Jian Wushuang shouted excitedly.

Xiong Tao’s aura had reached the extreme of violence.

His eyes were bloodshot. At the same time, golden veins bulged on his body, and his huge body looked terrifying.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. Endless divine power, accompanied by a violent aura, gathered again toward the golden long staff in his hand.

“15th!”

Xiong Tao roared hysterically.

Boom!!

The void between heaven and earth was blasted open, and a large amount of air retreated to both sides.

A golden staff shadow fell mercilessly.

Everything in the world trembled under this strike.

Even the two rank four True Saints of fatty Zhou had a trace of fear in their eyes when they saw this strike.

Seeing this strike, Jian Wushuang’s excitement had reached its peak, and he did not hold back any of his powerful divine power.

As a perfect chaotic creature, although he was only a rank one True Saint, his divine power was already comparable to or even stronger than that of a peak rank three True Saint, at this moment, the terrifying divine power surged toward the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Jian Wushuang struck out with his sword.

Hua!

The sword light slashed furiously, and in an instant, a thick beast roar sounded in heaven and earth.

It was the Peerless Sword Manual, Xi Xiang!

It was the most powerful sword skill among the seven moves of the Peerless Sword Manual that Jian Wushuang had created.

In the blink of an eye, the shocking sword shadow came into direct contact with the golden long staff.

Bang!

The world shook.

At the moment of contact, Jian Wushuang felt a strong power passing through his arm, causing his divine body to tremble. Then, his entire body fell down uncontrollably.

With this fall, a big hole immediately appeared in the ground.
