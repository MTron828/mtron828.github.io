Chapter 2890: World Shock (1)

——

Jian Wushuang had left, and the battle had come to an end.

The cultivators in the market who had witnessed the battle from beginning to end were completely stunned.

They were all shocked, or rather, frightened.

“A reverent god fought against three Immortal Saints at the same time. In the end, Realm Lord Tian Qu and Elder Su were killed on the spot, and the Heavenly Void Palace master fled in Panic!”

“A reverent god killed the Immortal Saint easily?”

“This reverent god is called Jian Yi!”

These cultivators murmured.

In less than an hour, this news swept across the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms like a huge storm.

For a time, countless cultivators in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, including the top Immortal Saints, were shocked.

Shocked!

Yes, the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms was completely shocked!

Star Point Sacred City was also one of the four great holy cities of the Golden Crow Nine Realms. Star Point Sacred City was completely under the control of Star Point Pavilion.

Star Point Pavilion was publicly acknowledged as the number one chamber of Commerce in the Golden Crow Nine Realms. Its foundation among the four pavilions was not inferior to the dragon-phoenix pavilion, and its strength was abnormally tyrannical.

At this moment, in the deepest part of the Star Point Pavilion’s lair, two figures were sitting upright in a pavilion. Their expressions were extremely unsightly.

Among these two people, one of them was a white-haired old man who wore gray clothes and looked extremely plain.

This white-haired old man was the Elder Meng who had personally gone to the Pill Sun Sacred World and participated in the auction of the Mountain River Map.

As for the other person, he was a long-browed Elder with a thin and frail body.

This long-browed Elder was the biggest reliance of the Star Point Pavilion, an extremely terrifying Immortal Saint.

“Su Zhen is dead, and he was killed by a Divine Master on the spot?”

When they first received the news, the long-browed Elder and Elder Meng both felt incredulous.

If they had not asked him personally and obtained the mirror image of the battle, they would never have believed it when they saw Elder Su being killed by Jian Wushuang.

“This Divine Master is very terrifying!” Elder Meng could not help exclaiming, “I have lived for so many years, not only in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow but also in the surrounding great territories. I have seen countless Divine Masters, but I have never seen such a powerful Divine Master. I’m afraid that even in the vast third heaven, there are not many Divine Masters like him.”

“It is very heaven-defying.” The long-browed old man had to admit, “His own strength is very impressive. The treasures he has in his hands and the secret techniques he uses are also very impressive. For example, the divine sword in his hands and the treasures he has thrown into the void, which can change the world, are all extraordinary items. In addition, Jian Yi is clearly only a supreme divinity, but he has an undying body. It’s simply inconceivable!”

Unbelievable!

This is the evaluation of Jian Wushuang made by the long-browed Elder and Elder Meng.

“Long brows, the absolute beginning divine realm is vast and boundless. There are countless kinds of geniuses, and some of them are even heaven-defying monsters. And now, we’ve encountered a monster that killed Su Zhen. What should we do now?” Elder Meng frowned.

In the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, the Immortal Saints were the pillars of support. Even among the four pavilions, there were only a few Immortal Saints who stayed in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Each loss was a great loss to any one of the four pavilions.

This time, the death of Elder Su made the Star Point Pavilion’s heartache to death.

However, no matter how much it hurt, the Star Point Pavilion still faced a difficult problem.

That was whether or not they should take revenge for Elder Su.

After all, the person who killed Elder Su was a monster.

“There’s no other way.” That long-browed old man slowly shook his head, “Su Zhen’s death has dealt a huge blow to our Point Star Pavilion. However, that sword one is too terrifying. However, from the mirror image, his strength has already completely surpassed that of an ordinary Immortal Saint. Even with the strength of Realm Lord Tian Qu, he is unable to take his sword head-on. His strength has already surpassed mine. In the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, there are only two people who can defeat him.”

“Two?” Elder Meng’s expression changed, and he asked doubtfully, “Other than Lord Bone Emperor, who else can defeat him?”

“The one from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion,” said the long-browed Elder.

“You mean…” Elder Meng frowned, “Hasn’t that person’s strength always been about the same as yours?”

“No, it might have been about the same in the past, but I saw him a thousand years ago. Although we didn’t exchange blows, I could already sense that he had already taken that step, and he had already mastered the immortal body. His strength is already far above mine. If he makes a move, he should be able to fight this Jian Yi head-on, and his chances of winning should be quite high.”

The long-browed Elder spoke in a deep voice, but suddenly, he changed the topic. “However, even if that person from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, or even the Bone Emperor, personally makes a move, he might be able to defeat Jian Yi head-on. However, it is impossible to kill Jian Yi.

“Since sword one has an immortal body, it is almost impossible to find someone who can kill him in the Golden Crow Nine Realms. The Bone Emperor is also unable to kill a Divine Master who has an immortal body and is so powerful. Moreover, there are no Immortal Saints who specialize in soul attacks in the Golden Crow Nine Realms. It is true that no one can kill him.”

Hearing this, Elder Meng nodded slightly.

“Since our Star Point Pavilion has no way of killing him, our Star Point Pavilion has no choice but to endure this hatred.” The long-browed Elder sighed, “Give the order to say that Su Zhen’s death was a treasure in the hands of his greedy sword. Now that he has been killed by Jian Yi, it is his own fault. It has nothing to do with our Star Point Pavilion. From now on, no one in our Star Point Pavilion is allowed to speak of taking revenge on Jian Yi. Anyone who disobeys will be expelled from the Star Point Pavilion.”

Elder Meng frowned slightly. His emotions were a bit complicated, but he still nodded after a long while.

He knew that the long-browed Elder chose to endure patiently because he wanted the enmity between the Star Point Pavilion and Jian Yi to be put to an end so that both sides would not continue to carry on.

Although this was somewhat aggrieved, it was also the wisest and most helpless choice.

After all, he was a Divine Master who could not be killed by the Star Point Pavilion at all, but who was extremely powerful and could easily kill saints. If he really wanted to fight with the Star Point Pavilion, it would definitely be a disaster for the Star Point Pavilion.

“There is one more thing. From today onwards, I will also be in closed-door cultivation. I will only come out when I have truly taken that step and am able to stand shoulder to shoulder with that person from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. As for the matters in the Star Point Pavilion, I will leave them to you,” said the long-browed Elder.

“Mm.” Elder Meng responded and left immediately.
