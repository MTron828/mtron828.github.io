Chapter 2205 There can only be one

Emperor Bai left soon after.Within the garden, Jian Wushuang held the transmission token in his hands.

“Emperor Thirteen... It is time we have a good talk. Let’s not rush into this. Let me handle my other things first,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Jian Wushuang left the garden.

On an empty ground within the Wushuang City, many figures were waiting. Some were standing while others sat cross-legged.

Most of them came from the Ancient God Clan.

Whoosh! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of these people.

“Ancient God Emperor!”

“Greetings, Ancient God Emperor!”

The experts from the Special Tribes Alliance greeted Jian Wushuang with fanaticism.

Many people were not convinced that Jian Wushuang was a competent leader initially. It could be because of his human bloodline. However, after the great battle, everyone within the Special Tribes Alliance and Sanctuary Alliance trusted him fully.

This was especially the case for the Special Tribes Alliance. They only listened to someone very powerful. Jian Wushuang was definitely an incredibly powerful expert.

Jian Wushuang looked at everyone and said, “I want to speak to Black Dragon Emperor personally. Can all of you please give us some space?”

King Chen Xin, King Luo Yu and the rest were stunned. They looked at Jian Wushuang oddly before they walked off.

Jian Wushuang and Black Dragon Emperor were left alone on the empty ground.

“Ancient God Emperor,” Black Dragon Emperor smiled at Jian Wushuang.

She was in black clothes and was stunning. Her crystal clear skin was showing under her black clothes, which attracted the attention of many males. She also had an extremely cold aura.

Without a doubt, she was extremely beautiful and attractive.

Attractive to the point where even great emperors would fall for her.

“Black Dragon Emperor, I have heard that you visited me frequently during the time I was in slumber. I know of your feelings and I thank you for that,” Jian Wushuang looked at Black Dragon Emperor and said.

Black Dragon Emperor trembled slightly when she heard of this.

Most people could have deduced that she had feelings for Jian Wushuang given how she had acted over the years.

Black Dragon Emperor admired Jian Wushuang greatly.

She believed that Jian Wushuang knew about it. However, Jian Wushuang did not speak about it at all. Now, he was talking about it.

Black Dragon Emperor took a deep breath and looked at Jian Wushuang fondly and in anticipation.

Her admiration for him was very clear. She was waiting for his reply.

“Black Dragon Emperor, you should know that I already have a wife,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes. But from what I heard, she left a long time ago,” Black Dragon Emperor said.

During the time Jian Wushuang had been in slumber, she had gone and inquired about everything related to Jian Wushuang, including the fact that Jian Wushuang had a wife.

“She only left, but is not dead. I will find her sooner or later and bring her back,” Jian Wushuang said firmly.

“I don’t mind,” Black Dragon Emperor smiled.

Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows. He did not expect Black Dragon Emperor to be so persistent.

He looked at Black Dragon Emperor in the eye and said, “I will not love a second person in my life. Hence... Sorry!”

When the word sorry came out of Jian Wushuang’s mouth, Black Dragon Emperor trembled and she turned pale.

After a while, she looked up at Jian Wushuang. Her expression was not of pain or disappointment. She smiled at Jian Wushuang and said, “I understand. Sorry for all the trouble, Ancient God Emperor. I will not trouble you anymore after today.”

She bowed slightly to Jian Wushuang before leaving.

She left very quickly, as though she was running away from Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stood there, looking at the back view of the Black Dragon Emperor. Even though he did not want to do this, all he could do was to shake his head.

There was no way a forced relationship would work.

Jian Wushuang already had someone in his heart. It was his wife: Leng Rushuang

Even if his wife died, she would forever be his wife. Furthermore, his wife was still alive and there was still a chance he could reunite with her.

There was no way Jian Wushuang could see himself having two wives at the same time.

After the Black Dragon Emperor left, the other experts from the Special Tribes Alliance walked up to him.

They could figure out what had happened after they saw Black Dragon Emperor leaving the place. They could only sigh at the bottom of their hearts.

“Ancient God Emperor, isn’t it a little too... cruel to reject her so directly?” King Chen Xin asked.

“Curel? It might be cruel, but it’s for the best,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and said.

Hearing this, the experts all nodded their heads.

“Alright everyone. Go back to your own tribes. As for the Green Fire World, the experts from the Special Tribes Alliance too can come here as long as they obey the rules,” Jian Wushuang said.

“King Chen Xin, I will not return to the Ancient God Clan for the time being. Please handle the internal matters together with King Luo Yu. If anything serious happens, you always can transmit a message to me.”

“Yes.”

King Chen Xin and the other experts nodded their heads and left.

Jian Wushuang was alone on the empty ground.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and sighed, “Things will get messy if I drag it out. It is better if it is settled now.”

After shaking his head, Jian Wushuang whipped out the transmission token Emperor Bai had passed to him.

“Lord Emperor Thirteen.”

Jian Wushuang transmitted a message over.

“You awakened?” Emperor Thirteen asked calmly, or rather, coldly.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang replied as he nodded his head.

“Come to the place where we first met. I will wait for you there,” Emperor Thirteen said and stopped the transmission.

“The place where we first met? Chillywind Valley?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows as he smiled.

He explained his plans to Wang Yuan and Jian Nantian before he left.

Chillywind Valley, one of the special places on the ancient battlefield. Jian Wushuang was the first person to discover this place.

He had come to explore this place several times but he could never figure this place out.

When he had explored the place after he had attained the battle power of an almighty, he had met Emperor Thirteen.

He had gotten a shock back then when Emperor Thirteen had appeared out of nowhere.

Soon, Jian Wushuang reached the outskirts of Chillywind Valley.
