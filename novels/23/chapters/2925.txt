Chapter 2926: The Dust Has Settled

——

In the void far away from the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

“Jian Wushuang, as you instructed, I asked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to move your loved ones as quickly as possible. Now, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has sent news that your loved ones have gone to a very distant territory. I’ve also sent people to bring them here. I can guarantee that they won’t be in danger.” On the other end of the transmission token, a cold but heart-stirring voice was heard.

“Thank you, Miss Xiao’er,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“You don’t have to thank me. Just remember my favor. You and I are allies. In order to help you, I have paid a lot of money to get the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to act as quickly as possible so that you can move your relatives in time. But in the future, the things I want you to do for me will be much more difficult than this,” Xiao’er said.

“As long as I have enough strength, I will do my best,” Jian Wushuang said.

After breaking off the communication with Xiao’er, Jian Wushuang was relieved to know that Zhuo Yunfeng and the others had been safely transferred. At the same time, he was secretly glad.

He was glad that he had made an ally in the witch desert region, Xiao’er!

Xiao’er had also experienced reincarnation. Her origin was a mystery and her background was huge. The key was that she was a friend and not an enemy of the Seven-star Mysterious Sect. That was why Jian Wushuang agreed to form an alliance with her.

Although the Alliance was formed, neither side had encountered any difficulties before, so there was no communication.

But this time, Jian Wushuang had to ask for help from this ally.

And this Miss Xiao’er did not disappoint him. Although Xiao’er could not move his close relatives in a short period of time, she had asked the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

In this way, he could move his family members to a safe place in time.

“Father and mother have been moved. I have also sent a message to Xiao’er to tell her to be careful. As long as those who are close to me are able to hide, for the time being, they should be fine.” Jian Wushuang sighed lightly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This matter happened so suddenly that he had not been fully prepared.

Therefore, it was somewhat urgent, but fortunately, there were no major changes.

Now that everyone close to him in the Nine Realms had been transferred and hidden, he was much more relieved.

Next, he would certainly be ready to leave.

But before he left…

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang suddenly waved his hand, and a figure appeared in the void in front of him.

This figure was Leng Rushuang’s master, Elder Qin.

“Jian Yi, are you finally willing to let me out?” Elder Qin stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold face.

Jian Wushuang smiled.

In the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, he had been fighting with people and even fighting against the Heavenly Dao because of the urgent situation. At that time, he had put all his attention on his opponent, he had forgotten that Elder Qin had been suppressed in his Blood Mountain Sword.

It was not until he had completely left the battlefield and arrived in the void that Jian Wushuang remembered.

“Elder Qin, I’m sorry to have made you suffer,” Jian Wushuang said apologetically.

“Humph!” Elder Qin snorted, but she looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange look.

Although she had been suppressed in the Blood Mountain Sword, she had clearly seen the scene outside. She had witnessed Jian Wushuang’s battle strength at the True Saint level. Even the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s biggest reliance, Saint Hong, could not stop him.

This was just a small matter.

Later, when facing nine experts at the True Saint-level from the Supreme Emotion Valley, their divine bodies collapsed and their souls were completely destroyed under the attacks of the nine True Saints. However, they did not die. In the end, they even used shocking techniques, they swept the nine True Saints with one sword and killed eight of them on the spot.

The terrifying strength and techniques completely frightened her.

In the end, the consciousness avatar of the rule master appeared, and the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao descended to perform the power of destruction. These were completely beyond what she could bear.

Until now, Elder Qin still had not completely reacted, and her mind was still in a daze.

She was very curious about what kind of secret Jian Wushuang had that caused the power of the will of heaven to descend!

However, she did not intend to ask about it, and Jian Wushuang could not tell her.

“Elder Qin, there is one small thing I want to ask you,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“Speak.” Elder Qin’s voice was still cold.

“You are Shuang Er, the Master of Little Phoenix. You must know her background, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He was indeed curious about Leng Rushuang’s background in this life.

It could not be helped. Leng Rushuang’s talent in this life was too high.

Moreover, Leng Rushuang could not recognize him in this life. This made Jian Wushuang wonder if something had happened to her during the reincarnation process.

“Leng Er’s background…”

Elder Qin frowned slightly, he said, “I don’t know her background either. When I first met her, she was just a baby. She was just born not long ago in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. I happened to pass by a remote territory and found a large-scale heaven and earth phenomenon in that territory. I looked for the phenomenon and found her when she was a baby. At that time, there was no one around her. She just floated quietly in the void without crying.

“I saw that she was extraordinary, so I sent her back to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and let her grow up there.”

“The phenomenon of heaven and earth?” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised.

If what Elder Qin said was true, then the Leng Rushuang in this life seemed to be born from heaven and earth!

Yes, just like those unique special life forms in the divine beginning world, they were born naturally from heaven and earth.

However, most of those special life forms had been polished and evolved over a long period of time before they gradually gained some intelligence and finally became alive.

But Leng Rushuang… was she reincarnated?

In addition, the special life forms in the absolute beginning divine world had extremely strong bloodlines and physiques. However, apart from her high comprehension ability and the fact that it was as easy as eating and drinking, Leng Rushuang did not have anything special about her bloodline?

“Forget it. Since Shuang Er has already gone to the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, I won’t be able to see her for a while. I’ll wait until I become stronger, then I’ll slowly find the answer.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. “Elder Qin, I’ll see you again.”

After saying this, Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

Moreover, the direction he went in was clearly the opposite of the Nine Worlds of the Golden Crow!
