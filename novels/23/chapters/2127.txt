Chapter 2128 Double Loss

The complete Moon Picking Skill was absolutely formidable.The only question Jian Wushuang had was whether the Skill could suppress seven people at the same time – Third Stage Great Emperor Demon King Chen Yu included. Desperate, he had to crush two Ancient God stars to increase his Bloodline Power, amplifying the Skill’s powers.

Wong~~ Heaven and earth, space and time were all being suppressed.

The seven people – Demon King Chen Yu included – who were about to jump into the wormhole, instantly stopped.

“What is this?” They were all frightened, except Demon King Chen Yu.

“Die!”

The experts from the Sanctuary Alliance took this opportunity, while the seven were being suppressed, to make their way towards them.

All of them made their moves in a frenzy.

The Great Emperors who were being suppressed could not block the attacks.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

A terrifying roar resonated sequentially, and boundless power was being dispersed.

The suppression only lasted for a moment before it disappeared.

“Run!”

A Great Emperor from the Archelon Palace gave a loud roar. They had no intention of getting into an intense fight with the Sanctuary Alliance experts, and all made a run for the wormhole.

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!

Four figures jumped into the wormhole. Finally, it was quiet.

The wormhole was already activated. In front of it, Jian Wushuang levitated without a word.

“It’s a pity, a few of them got away,” the Abysmal Saint Master snorted.

“There’s nothing we can do about it. Those Great Emperors had impressive skills up their sleeves. Without the Sword Emperor’s Timespace suppression and constriction, they would all have run away,” East Royal Emperor said.

Indeed.

If a Great Emperor wanted to escape, it would be extremely difficult to take him down.

But with Jian Wushuang’s Moon Picking Skill constricting the heavens, earth, space and time itself, and with such intensity, even a Great Emperor could not resist.

It was also because of that Skill that the Archelon Palace suffered its own fair share of losses at the last minute.

“Regardless, we of Sanctuary Alliance did not suffer too much of a loss this time. On the contrary, this was our victory,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Our victory?”

The surrounding Great Emperors looked at each other, all smiles.

Even the cold and indifferent Emperor God Tian Ling had a smile on his face.

In front of them were three cold corpses floating. From the looks of it, they were all Great Emperor level experts from the Archelon Palace!

Counting Demon King Chen Yu, there were seven Great Emperors. But now, they had taken down three, all thanks to Jian Wushuang’s Moon Plucking Skill, leaving them vulnerable when they were cut down.

The Archelon Palace had poured their resources into this battle with the intention of destroying the Heaven Repairing Palace and killing Sanctuary Alliance experts.

But in the end, the Palace had not been destroyed, and the Sanctuary Alliance had only lost a few Sir Gods and Emperor Gods, but the Archelon Palace had lost all their Emperor Gods, and three Great Emperors!

This battle was definitely the Sanctuary Alliance’s victory.

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!~~~

Experts from the Sanctuary Alliance and Special Tribes Alliance all started pouring in, along with six Great Emperors and many Almighties.

Soon after, Emperor Bai came down personally.

When those experts saw the three corpses, they were all stunned but immensely glad.

Three Great Emperors! The entire Three Emperors World, along with the Archelon Palace, only had a handful of Great Emperors.

This was definitely a major setback for them. Not only did they fail in their mission, but they had lost so many people as well during the battle.

“The Ancient Mystery Land was always in Sanctuary Alliance’s control, we never expected the Archelon Palace to place such a formation without a trace.” Emperor Bai waved his hand, and soon the formation the Archelon Palace had left behind started to fall apart.

“Come, let’s go to the Heaven Repairing Palace,” Emperor Bai said.

The Heaven Repairing Palace was on the verge of collapsing after the destruction Demon King Chen Yu had caused, but soon it was restored to its previous position.

The Emperor Gods were still cultivating within the Palace. They were not affected by what had happened outside.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang, Underworld God, and Emperor God Tian Ling were no longer able to re-enter the Palace.

The Underworld God and Emperor God Tian Ling were fine with that, having already reached their objective of reaching Great Emperor levels, but Jian Wushuang….

“It’s a shame, give me more time and I could have finished the second scroll of the Immortal Celestial Body,” Jian Wushuang had some regrets, but he could do nothing about it. He had to protect the Heaven Repairing Palace.

Although he had only been inside for half a month, his skills had already improved tremendously.

For the Immortal Celestial Body’s second scroll, he was certain he could master it, it was simply a matter of time.

Jian Wushuang and the others waited outside the Palace.

Another fortnight passed within the blink of an eye. The Emperor Gods started to exit the Palace. “I wonder how many managed to become Great Emperors out of the nine of them,” Jian Wushuang and the other experts waited in anticipation.

At this juncture, every extra Great Emperor would influence the upcoming battle significantly.

Soon, all nine remaining experts walked out of the Palace, and the Palace returned to its dilapidated facade.

Jian Wushuang watched the nine people closely.

After a moment, he beamed.

“Not bad,” even Emperor Bai nodded.

The other experts were surprised as well.

They all knew that amongst the nine people, six of them were at pinnacle Emperor God level. Three of them were already at Great Emperor level.
