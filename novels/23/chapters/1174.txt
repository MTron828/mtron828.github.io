To promote either the Speed Sword Principle or the Yin-Yang Sword Principle to the most powerful level.

Then to boost the Ancient God Power to break through to the Four-star Ancient God Level.

Among these two steps, the second step was relatively simple. The Ancient God Power in Jian Wushuang’s body already reached a limitation and it wouldn’t take long before it to break through to the next level.

The key was the first step; the improvement of his Sword Principles.

“The Star Jade Walls!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly lit up.

He was aware that there were two treasures on Star Island, with one of them being the Star Jade Walls.

When he had been trapped on this island a long time ago, he had carefully studied the Star Jade Walls. At that time, they helped him immensely, however, he could not figure out the real mysteries in them because he was too weak.

Now, however, his strength had already been improved a lot, so he probably could learn more things from them.

He immediately came to the place where the Star Jade Walls were at.

He directly walked into the pavilion of Sword Principle among those densely dotted pavilions.

As soon as he entered the pavilion, he saw the jade walls on both sides of the hall.

There were lifelike patterns carved on the jade walls. Each of them showed a person wielding a longsword to perform a kind of swordsmanship. To the naked eye, the patterns were identical.

As a matter of fact, each of them contained an amazing swordsmanship.

There were a total of 16 patterns on the jade walls.

“When I first saw the swordsmanships on the patterns, I felt they were extremely recondite. I wonder how will I feel now?”?Jian Wushuang smiled. He immediately sat cross-legged in front of one jade wall and began to study the first pattern.

There was a middle-aged man who wore a straw rain cape and a bamboo hat on the first pattern. He wielded a longsword and cut a huge lake in half.

Surprisingly, though his sword light had split the lake into two, the lake did not ripple.

It seemed that there was no force acting on the lake.

“The greatest benevolence is like water that tackles complicated problems in a very easy manner. His control of this power is really incredible.”?Jian Wushuang secretly exclaimed.

When he saw this picture many years ago, he only felt that this swordsmanship was unfathomable. Without a doubt, it was still abstruse presently. Nonetheless, he could figure out some mysteries from it.

Then he began to observe the second pattern.

The more patterns he observed, the more shocked he would be.

Today, his understanding of Sword Principles was much deeper than he used to be, so the things he was able to perceive from the swordsmanships increased. That was why he felt so astonished.

“This swordsmanship’s effect is equal to the act of splitting the heavens. One can only perform it after mastering the most powerful Sword Principle.”

“It’s dreamlike and difficult to tell whether it is real or not. How weird it is!”

Jian Wushuang marvelled at it while studying it.

Each one of the 16 swordsmanships was so unfathomable that he simply could not master it.

Even though he had mastered one most powerful Sword Principle, he was absolutely unable to display such a horrible swordsmanship.

At this point, he shifted his gaze at the ninth pattern.

The protagonist of this pattern was also the middle-aged man who wore a straw rain cape and a bamboo hat. He stood at the end of the dark Void and in front of him were several black-robed men. They sent forth an unfathomable aura that Jian Wushuang could not fathom out.

The middle-aged man acted at this moment.

He wielded his sword with a single hand at a great distance.

There was no sword light or sword shadow, but the heads of those black-robed men flew outward quietly.

The pattern disappeared immediately.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank suddenly.

“That swordsmanship…”

He immediately began to recall that sword movement.

It gave him an unusually odd feeling.

“It’s too fast for me to catch the sword light. Why did those black-robed men die?”

“The middle-aged man just stood where he was without any sign of moving.”

“How could it be so fast?”

Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

It was indeed too fast.

It was fast beyond belief.

Jian Wushuang had created the Speed Sword Principle and was skilled at speed. If he wielded his sword with all his might, he was confident that common Dao Masters were unable to catch his sword light, but he must move close to them.

Nevertheless, the middle-aged man in the pattern wielded his sword toward those men in black from a great distance.

He killed his opponents at a distance of tens of thousands of miles, but Jian Wushuang could not capture his sword light!

“How could there be such a swift swordsmanship in the world?”?Jian Wushuang frowned and was astounded.

He continued to observe the ninth pattern.

He had carefully studied the previous eight patterns. Although the swordsmanships on these patterns amazed him, he had not observed them a second time. However, he began to observe the ninth pattern a second time.

He still could not figure out anything about it after that, so he watched it a third time.

The fourth time, and the fifth time…

In just a short moment, he had observed the ninth pattern for a dozen times.

Only then did he find something special about it.

“Spacetime! It’s the spacetime!”

Jian Wushuang looked up suddenly and roared deep in his heart.

After carefully watching the ninth pattern for quite a few times, he finally found a slight difference.

This difference lied in the spacetime.

“It appeared to be an ordinary swordsmanship, but it affected the entire spacetime when the sword was struck outward!”

“To be precise, it kept the spacetime from influencing the sword!”

“That’s exactly what makes that swordsmanship incredible!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were wide open and his body trembled violently.

“I understand! I understand! “

“I finally understand what overrides speed. It’s the spacetime!”

“Speed, be it fast or slow, is restricted by the spacetime. The higher level of the Speed Sword Principle should be the Spacetime Sword Principle!”

“It’s not constrained by the spacetime and can exert the speed to the extreme!”

A flicker of excitement flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

He never understood why the Speed Sword Principle was merely at the Creation Level although it was very arcane.

He did not know what other power overrode the speed.

Nevertheless, when he saw the ninth pattern on the Star Jade Wall, he finally understood that it was the spacetime!

The real perfect speed could only be achieved when it got rid of the restrictions of time and space. That was the most powerful Sword Principle… Spacetime Sword Principle!
