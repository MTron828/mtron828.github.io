Chapter 523: Three Methods

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The ninth Origin Mark was a legend not only in the Divine Land, but also in the Monster Continent, and even in the whole Ancient World.

In the Ancient World, there were lots of Seven-cloud Realms and Eight-cloud Realms, but it was very rare to find a Nine-cloud Realm.

Like the 72 Marquis in the Divine Land, including the Nine Sovereigns, the highest level that they could comprehend was the Eight-cloud Realm of Origin.

So far, there was not even one Nine-cloud Realm expert among the humans in the Monster Continent. Although Divine Emperors already reached the requirement of the Nine-cloud Realm and their strength was much stronger than the Eight-cloud Realm Divine Generals’, they still couldn’t enter the realm.

Even the Temple Masters, the Peak expert above the Cloud Realm, could only break through the Eight-cloud Realm.

It seemed the Nine-cloud Realm was practically extinct in the Ancient World.

But now, Jian Wushuang already condensed the eighth Origin Mark of the World Origin and Slaughter Origin, if he tried hard to get the ninth Origin Mark and break through the Cloud Realm, then he would be a Nine-cloud Realm.

“Nine-cloud Realm, Flying to the Ninth Heaven...” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He had been in the Saint Realm for a long time.

Based on his Realm, he was already beyond the Saint Realm.

As an ordinary Saint Realm expert, he should have broken through the Cloud Realm after condensing three Origin Marks.

But because Jian Wushuang cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, it made him completely different from an ordinary warrior. That’s why although he already had eight Origin Marks, he was still in the Saint Realm.

All the movements of the Heavenly Creation Skill were unbelievable and different.

As an ordinary warrior, it was a step into the Cloud Realm after breaking through the Saint Realm.

But for Jian Wushuang who was above the Venerable Master, it was flying to the Ninth Heaven!

Flying to the Ninth Heaven had a significant meaning.

“Perhaps, I need to condense the ninth Origin Mark before I can break through.”?Jian Wushuang thought quietly.

But that was only what he thought. He didn’t really know the details.

As he had stepped on the path of Inverse Cultivation, the future was already full of unknowns.

“Unfortunately I can only stay here for ten days. If I had more time, maybe I could condense the ninth Origin Mark.”?Jian Wushuang thought with regret.

Ten days passed so he had to leave the Fourth Level. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

When he arrived at the First Level, he could sense the difference of the Origin Energy. Jian Wushuang shook his head,?“Compared to the Fourth Level, the First Level is much weaker.”

Qing Huo had been waiting for him on the First Level. When he saw Jian Wushuang...

“My friend Wushuang, how is the Fourth Level, any achievements?” Qing Huo asked.

“A lot, but sadly I only had ten days,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Ten days already means a lot, you should be satisfied with it. For me, I could not dream of entering the Fourth Level. Even if you let me stay on the Third Level for a couple days, I would already be laughing aloud as if my dreams had come true,” Qing Huo answered with a bit envy.

“Haha!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help laughing.

Indeed, he should be satisfied. After all, it was the Fourth Level which was not easy even for Divine Emperors to access.

He should thank Emperor Fengxiao for giving him a chance to enter it.

“Oh, Qing Huo, before you mentioned that the requirement of going to the Second Level of the Earth Core Palace or exchanging the treasure in the Monster-exterminating Pagoda was Monster Cores of Demonic Beasts. However, where are the Monster Cores from, or where can we kill Demonic Beasts?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Roughly, there are three methods to get Monster Elixirs,” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang and explained to him carefully.

“First, you can do simple tasks for the Monster-exterminating League, such as being a guard of the Eight Cities in the Holy Place or sending messages to others. All these tasks give you Monster Cores as the payment. They are easy and not dangerous, but you won’t get much.”

“As for the second method, you can join the military!”

Pausing a couple seconds, Qing Huo continued the conversation, “There are four military camps in the Monster-exterminating League. These four separately guard the north, south, east and west sides of Human Territory. Apart from the Human Territory, the rest is occupied by Demonic Beasts. Those Demonic Beasts often attack our Huaman Territory, so the mission of these four military camps are to defend and even wipe out the Demonic Beasts!”

“The scale of the attacks from the Demonic Beasts are both big and small. Usually there are some small attacks but sometimes we face brutal ones. Everytime, we humans try our best to fight against them. Many experts have died in this war, but of course they also have greater opportunity to obtain Monster Cores.”

“So, the second method is full of danger but also easier to get Monster Cores!”

While talking to this point, Qing Huo paused and looked at Jian Wushuang, and then he continued, “Before, I stayed in a military camp for a while and I only could get enough Monster Elixirs to exchange the Bone Fusion Technique of the Fifth and Sixth Level, but that’s because my strength was weak. However, my friend Wushuang, you are a Second-grade Divine General, if you could stay in a military camp like me for a few days, you would absolutely get more Monster Elixirs than me.”

“So what about the third method?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The third way is to slaughter the Demonic Beasts in a territory which is already occupied by them,” Qing Huo answered.

“But, the territory is vast and there are thousands of Demonic Beasts in it. The ordinary Divine Generals will surely be killed if they get into the Monster Territory. Only those Divine Emperors and few Divine Generals whose strengths are on par with the Divine Emperors’ are brave enough to do that.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

In the Monster Continent, 90% of the territory were occupied by Demonic Beasts. Humanity was limited to only 10%. That meant the monster group was really strong, so the ones who went to the territory was like entering the tigers’ cave, that would be super dangerous.

If a person whose battle strength was not as strong as the Divine Emperor’s went to the Demonic Beast’s territory alone, he would definitely be killed.

“I’ve decided to go to the military camp,” Jian Wushuang said.

Qing Huo smiled slightly, it seemed he already knew it.

“If you want to join the military camp, you need to apply first and then the league will arrange for you. Follow me.” Qing Huo said.

Soon, Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo left the Earth Core Palace.

Qing Huo had stayed in a military camp for a while, so he knew how to apply for it. Soon, they both applied to join a military camp.

Two days later, the Monster-exterminating League offered a place for them.

“Jian Wushuang, the Second-grade Divine General, will be in the Seventh Army of the East Camp and be a leader of a 100-soldier squad!”

“Qing Huo, the First-grade Divine General, will be in the Seventh Army of the East Camp and be a leader of a ten-soldier squad!”
