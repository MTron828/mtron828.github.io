Chapter 671: Violet Devastation Sword Skill

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang is excellent when it comes to sword skill, but it doesn’t mean his comprehension of the Dao is good.”

Palace Master Ming Xin poured out her words, but when she saw Jian Wushuang quickly break through the 17th, 18th, and 19th floor in an instant, she was struck dumb and the others were astonished as well.

“He… he is…”

“So fast.”

“He was stuck on the 17th floor for a long time, wasn’t he? How was he suddenly able to break through the 18th and 19th floor in the blink of an eye?”

The masters could not understand the sudden change.

With only a strike on each floor, all the Puppet Fighters were defeated.

“Look at his sword!” One of the Vice Palace Masters suddenly cried out.

The others immediately reacted to the voice and looked at the sword.

They could see that all 10 Puppet Fighters on the 20th floor were diving towards Jian Wushuang aggressively. Then, almost at the same moment, Jian Wushuang made his move, which was followed by the release of an enormous amount of World Energy.

The floors that Jian Wushuang had passed were filled with dazzling sword light as his sword passed through the bodies of all the Puppet Fighters.

He also cleared this floor with a single strike.

“How could this be… possible?” Palace Master Ming Xin’s eyes were open wide and there was a look of horror on her face.

“His swordsmanship is so terrifying!”

“From his strike, I can tell that he has comprehended up to the third Occult and is only a step away from reaching the fourth Occult.”

“His comprehension of the World Dao is surprisingly high!”

“There’s still more. Look!”

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Under their watchful gazes, Jian Wushuang made it to the 21st floor, on which the Puppet Fighters were much more powerful than those on the 20th floor.

This time, he could not end the battle as quickly as before, but he was still able to overpower his opponents.

His sword rushed, surrounded by sword light and carrying an air of killing intent. The mighty power of the World Dao and Slaughter Dao were being completely demonstrated by his swordsmanship. Under such powerful attacks, the 10 Puppet Fighters were forced to retreat.

“Oh my God, his comprehension of the Slaughter Dao is no less than that of the World Dao.”

“Luo Yong and Dong’er may have reached a higher level in the Dao than Jian Wushuang, but that is just in a single Dao. Jian Wushuang has comprehended the third Occult in both the World Dao and Slaughter Dao. What’s more, his talent in Sword Principle is really impressive.”

“I agree. Overall, I think he is more powerful than Luo Yong and Dong’er.”

These masters were experienced and knowledgeable, so they had a general idea of how powerful Jian Wushuang was. Because of that, they could not deny that in terms of cultivation in Sword Principle and the Dao, Jian Wushuang was the best among all 20 of the challengers.

They believed that Jian Wushuang would actually be able to make it past the 25th floor, while Luo Yong and Dong’er would probably have to stop on the 25th floor.

“Monster!”

“This boy has greatly advanced in his comprehension of the Dao over the last two years after entering our sect.”

“He is a real super genius. Previously, we thought that he was being conceited, but it seems like we misunderstood him.”

Complex feelings overwhelmed the masters.

Even up till this moment, Xuan Yi had remained silent. Jian Wushuang’s performance on the Ninth Heaven Road was within his expectations, so it was not that surprising.

Jian Wushuang continued to break through and challenge higher floors.

Just as the masters had expected, it did not take him much time to pass these floors and reach the 25th floor.

At a glance, Jian Wushuang could tell that every Puppet Fighter on that floor was as powerful as the weakest Divine Realm experts.

After exchanging several moves with them, he realized that the Puppet Fighters’ attacks were more skillful and fierce than before.

The Puppet Fighters surrounded him from all directions.

Shoop! Shoop! Shoop! Shoop!

A net of spear shadows moved towards him and completely surrounded him

He exerted the power of his Sword Soul to the extreme and moved forward as if he had become a sword himself. Meanwhile, his Heart-killing Sword struck out continuously, causing countless sword shadows to sweep through the surroundings. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He easily deflected all the spear attacks that were directed towards him.

“The Puppet Fighters on this floor are superior to all the ones I’ve fought before, regardless of whether it’s in power, speed, or skill. Not only that, they have good teamwork. It seems like I’ll have to rely on some special methods to defeat them.

“I’ll break through with pure power.”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

The very next moment, he withdrew the Heart-killing Sword, took a step backwards, and held the sword with both hands. An overwhelming Sword Essence continued gathering in the blade as he released a burst of killing intent.

The entire space seemed to completely freeze at that moment.

“Violet Devastation Sword Skill!”
