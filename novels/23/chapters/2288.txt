2289 Escort to Samsara

The earth fell quiet.

Dead quiet.

The pinnacle experts of the Seven Star Black Sect were all looking at Xuan Yan on the golden Dragon Turtle.

Xuan Yan pondered for a long time before finally saying, “Xuan Yi, I’ll trust you one last time.”

“Thank you.” Xuan Yi heaved a sigh of relief, and slowly stood up.

Xuan Yan on the golden Dragon Turtle shifted his gaze towards the three Masters of Holy Land.

“You three can scram now!” Xuan Yan’s cold cry reverberated across the lands.

“Insolence!” The two-metre tall beauty, the white-robed bald man, and the crimson-robed woman were instantly furious.

Scram?

Simple words were enough to display how much he looked down on them.

When had the three Masters of Holy Land ever been looked down upon?

“Xuan Yan, you think things are still the same?” the white-robed bald man asked coldly.

“You were stronger than us in the beginning, but not by a lot. So many years have passed since, and you were only sleeping, whereas the three of us have improved immensely. Under these conditions, you dare ask us to scram?” the crimson-robed woman said as well.

“If you all don’t scram, I’ll simply destroy the consciousness embodiment of yours.” Xuan Yan was determined. “Long Qi, let’s go!”

An angry roar was made by the Golden Dragon Turtle. Long Qi was only but a mount under Xuan Yan, his power was enough to go against a Divine Punisher Elder.

Its large body pounced with great might towards the three Masters of Holy Land.

The elite experts of the Seven Star Black Sect followed right behind Xuan Yan.

“Go as well,” Xuan Yi said.

“Understood,” Emperor Thirteen and One-Star Man nodded.

The two of them moved out at once.

War broke out.

The three Masters of Holy Land looked unsightly upon realising what was coming for them.

They may have been highly reputable Masters of Holy Land, but they were going against the Seven Star Black Sect experts, two of them with Master of Holy Land fighting powers, the rest close to that. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If it had been at their pinnacle period, they would not have feared them at all, but under the restrictions, they were still stronger, but not by much.

Their fighting power had decreased immensely.

Hong!

Hong!

Hong!

An earth-shattering force exploded upon impact from both sides, leaving the Eternal Chaotic World Great Emperors dumbfounded.

To those Great Emperors, the Chaotic Divine Demon Ancient Era experts were already extremely terrifying, but now they were nothing against those elite experts.

Upon contact, the three Masters of Holy Land were immediately put at a disadvantage and suppressed.

Under those circumstances, Xuan Yi made his move.

He gradually stepped out towards the reincarnation passage.

The Master of Holy Land trio sensed Xuan Yi making his move, but had no way to intervene with the Seven Star Black Sect experts in the way.

There was no way they could get help from Absolute Beginning Divine World experts either.

They had already paid too high a price for their consciousness embodiments to come down. If they sent experts over, they would have to sacrifice their own lives.

That obviously would not happen.

They could stare at Xuan Yi approaching the reincarnation passage.

Xuan Yi opened his palm and revealed two intact souls floating, but neither awakened.

Xuan Yi stared at Jian Wushuang’s soul peacefully and stretched out his index finger, allowing for boundless information to enter Jian Wushuang’s soul.

Xuan Yi smiled and tossed his hand out.

“Go, little guy!”

With Xuan Yi’s guidance, Jian Wushuang’s soul made its way towards the reincarnation passage and disappeared.

He threw the Mountain River Map and Blood Mountain Sword along as well.

Afterwards, Xuan Yi looked at Leng Rushuang’s soul.

“Might as well send the other. I hope you both can find each other on the other side,” Xuan Yi said as he tossed Leng Rushuang’s soul into the reincarnation passage as well.

In the blink of an eye, both souls entered the reincarnation passage.

Xuan Yi finally revealed a relieved smile.

The reincarnation passage began to slowly dissipate.

Within a moment, the large reincarnation passage had disappeared as well.

“Did we do it?” Emperor Thirteen, One-Star Man and the others were overjoyed.

The Master of Holy Land trio’s faces, on the other hand, turned extremely ugly.

“We let him succeed. What was the reason behind Xuan Yi doing all of this, sacrificing so much just to send him into the tunnel?” the two-metre tall beauty asked.

“Who knows, but the kid has secrets. It’s a pity we did not block it,” the white-robed bald man said.

“Forget it, there is no point staying here anymore, let’s go,” the crimson-robed woman said.

The Master of Holy Land trio reached an agreement.

Without hesitation, the three consciousness embodiments went straight for the link passage and left.

Xuan Yan, Emperor Thirteen and the rest did not stop Bing Shan, Leng Ruxue and the others from leaving either.

As the Ancient Era experts left, the link passage disappeared.

The peace at Heaven’s Horizon was restored.

In the dark Void in front of the Heaven’s Horizon, the Seven Star Black Sect experts gathered in front of Xuan Yi.

Xuan Yi’s figure was gradually turning transparent.

“After so many years, your will is finally collapsing?” Emperor Thirteen asked Xuan Yi calmly.

Xuan Yi smiled.

He knew his condition.

He had died a long time ago, back at that Ancient battlefield. Only his willpower was left.

His willpower had survived for so many years, and after completing his purpose, he was now finally collapsing.

The super-existence that had stirred heavens and multiple worlds was about to meet its end!
