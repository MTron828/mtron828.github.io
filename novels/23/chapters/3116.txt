Chapter 3117: Arrived

——

After a month of traveling, Jian Wushuang and the others returned to the True Martial Kingdom and the mansion where the Sixth Prince lived.

The Sixth Prince was already waiting there.

“Sixth Brother.” Mu Qing came to the front of the Sixth Prince.

“Qing, are you okay?” The Sixth Prince asked.

“I’m fine.” Mu Qing shook his head. Then, he began to introduce, “Sixth Brother, let me introduce you. These two are Elder Zi Xing from the Holy Feather Sect and Lord Xin Zong. They were personally sent by Sect Master Ying Yue to help us.”

The Sixth Prince immediately looked at Elder Zi Xing and Xin Zong.

Elder Zi Xing and Xin Zong did not conceal their auras either. The Sixth Prince could clearly sense the auras of those rank five and rank six Peak True Saints.

“Zhen Wu Kingdom’s Mu Yun greets the two lords.” The Sixth Prince immediately bowed respectfully.

Elder Zi Xing glanced at the Sixth Prince and waved his hand. However, he did not say anything. Xin Zong also appeared very cold.

The reason why they had come to Zhen Wu Country was that they had received the orders of the Moon Reflection Sect Master. As for Mu Yun’s so-called identity as the Sixth Prince of Zhen Wu Country, they did not care about it at all.

“And these two are the two geniuses from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palace original palace, the Evil Master and the Mirage Water.” Mu Qing said again. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces?” The Sixth Prince’s expression immediately changed.

He had also heard of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. It was said that geniuses were as numerous as the clouds there. Any one of them would be a favored son of heaven. Their status was also not something that a mere prince from an ordinary kingdom like him could compare to.

“Greetings,” The Sixth Prince also bowed humbly.

“Yes.” The Evil Master nodded slightly in response.

“Sixth Brother, and this is Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis. He was invited by you before. The reason why I was able to arrive at the Holy Feather Sect smoothly and even asked the Moon Reflection Sect Master to send experts to help is because of Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Mu Qing said.

“Oh?” The Sixth Prince raised his eyebrows and looked at Jian Wushuang with a humble smile.

Jian Wushuang did not care at all.

“Everyone, I have arranged a banquet to welcome you. Come with me,” the Sixth Prince said with a smile.

Immediately, everyone followed the Sixth Prince into the mansion below.

In a magnificent hall, singing and dancing were very lively.

The Sixth Prince sat at the top of the hall with a wine cup in his hand and said, “Mu Yun is very grateful that all of you have come to help me this time. Here’s a toast to all of you.”

With that, the Sixth Prince drank the wine in his hand.

After drinking it, he wiped his mouth and looked down. He found that the people sitting on both sides of the table, whether it was Elder Zi Xing, Xin Zong, Evil Master, or Mirage Water, did not pay any attention to him at all, they did not pay any attention to him at all.

Elder Zi Xing and Xin Zong looked extremely cold. The former closed his eyes directly, and even if he opened his eyes slightly, he would look in Jian Wushuang’s direction.

Meanwhile, Evil Master and Mirage Water had been looking at Jian Wushuang with an embarrassed smile. Evil Master had been toasting Jian Wushuang.

This scene inevitably made Sixth Prince feel a little awkward.

With a sigh, the Sixth Prince put down the wine cup in his hand and asked in a low voice, “Ah Qing, what’s going on? Why do I feel that this banquet has nothing to do with it? Is the main character of the banquet Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“Sixth Brother, I’ve told you before that although Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis was invited by you, his identity and ability are extraordinary. I don’t know the details, but I can tell you that even the Sect Master of the Holy Feather Sect, Ying Yue, seems to want to curry favor with Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Mu Qing said softly.

“Even Sect Master Moon Reflection wants to curry favor with him?” The Sixth Prince was stunned. He glanced at Evil Master and Mirage Water and nodded slightly. “I can see that Evil Master and Mirage Water are genius disciples of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces’ original palace. Their status is very high, but they are obviously full of respect for Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis and very respectful. This Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis’ background is really extraordinary.”

“That’s right,” Mu Qing said.

After knowing this, the Sixth Prince did not feel uncomfortable. He calmed down and completely gave the main character to Jian Wushuang.

However, the banquet did not last long.

Whoosh!

A figure hurriedly walked in from outside the hall, walked to the Sixth Prince’s side, and whispered something in his ear.

The Sixth Prince stood up and his eyes sharpened.

“Everyone.”

The Sixth Prince looked around and said, “I’m afraid this is the end of the banquet. I’ve received news that the Third Prince has gathered all his experts and is coming to kill us.”

“He’s coming? He’s going to kill us so soon?” Mu Qing was stunned.

Jian Wushuang and the others in the hall also looked up at the Sixth Prince.

“He must have heard that the Holy Feather Sect is on my side and sent two experts. He had no choice but to act immediately. I also heard that the Third Prince also asked for help,” the Sixth Prince said.

The Third Prince had many spies around him. Of course, he also sent some experts to infiltrate the Third Prince’s subordinates.

Therefore, when the powerhouses under the Third Prince’s command came out in full force, he had also received the news immediately.

“Elder Zi Xing, Lord Xin Zong, I’m afraid we will have to trouble the two of you with this big battle.” The Sixth Prince said.

“The two of us have come under the order of the Sect Master to settle the dispute in the Zhen Wu Country. Naturally, we will take action.” Elder Zi Xing said in a low voice.

“Then I will have to trouble the two of you.” The Sixth Prince let out a light breath.

In terms of strength, the power controlled by the Third Prince was indeed much stronger than his.

If the Third Prince had gone all out to attack him previously, he would not have had much confidence. But now, with the existence of Elder Zi Xing and the Xin Sect, the two experts of the Holy Feather Sect…especially since Elder Zi Xing was a genuine rank six True Saint, this made him very confident.

“Yuan Chong, immediately send the order to gather all the experts under my command. Also, inform Xing gang to get the Purple Blood Camp ready,” the Sixth Prince ordered.

“Yes.” Yuan Chong nodded and immediately went to send the order.

Following the Sixth Prince’s order, the experts under his command, including those who had been loyal to him since a long time ago, as well as the many experts he had invited with great rewards…all began to gather quickly.

In less than two hours, the many experts had already gathered.

In this huge mansion, there were already over 200 people standing together, and almost all of them were at least a rank two True Saint. There were not even many rank two True Saints, and most of them were rank three True Saints, and there were also some rank four True Saints.

There was also an army of more than 40 people in purple armor in the air.
