Chapter 3538: Distribution

“Blood Sword Master, our Star Palace actually has some rules about the distribution of treasures,” Heavy Master said.

“Oh, tell me about it.” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“First of all, the first expert who finds a true treasure and sends the news must take a share. Under normal circumstances, the first one to find a true treasure can take 10 to 20 percent of the share. Secondly, during the treasure competition, the rest of the share will be distributed according to each person’s contribution,” Heavy Master said.

“And this time, Saber Python Master was the first to see the Poluo God parts, and he passed the news to us. Only then could we rush over in time to fight for them. Saber Python Master would definitely get a share. In addition, during the fight, Saber Python Master had more or less put in some effort, so it shouldn’t be too much to get a 20% share.”

“As for Purple Sound Master and I, we only gave those cultivators some hindrance during the fight. The others basically didn’t do anything. In the end, it was almost all thanks to you, Blood Sword Master, that we were able to get the Poluo God parts. Therefore, it’s already pretty good that Purple Sound Master and I can get a 10% share together. The remaining 70% will all go to you, Blood Sword Master.”

“Blood Sword Master, Saber Python Master, what do you think of the distribution?”

Heavy Master knew his own limits.

He and Purple Sound Master did not put in much effort in this competition. They would be satisfied if they could get 10% of the shares.

“I don’t have any objections. After all, I didn’t put in much effort in the competition. I only found the Poluo God component and passed the news to you. It’s already a lot to get 20% of the shares. Blood Sword Master, what do you think?” Saber Python Master looked at Jian Wushuang.

In fact, the distribution was just their wishful thinking. They mainly had to see if Jian Wushuang would accept the distribution.

If Jian Wushuang did not accept it, of course, they would make some concessions.

However, Jian Wushuang gave a forthright smile and said, “As long as the three of you are satisfied, of course I won’t have any objections.”

“Well, it’s settled then.” Saber Python Master smiled.

“Blood Sword Master, you can send a message to Axe One Master. He controls the true treasure vault of our Star Palace. The experts of our Star Palace need his permission to exchange for treasures in the true treasure vault. At the same time, if we get any treasures, we can go to the true treasure vault and exchange them for contribution points. The Poluo God parts are useless to us. In the end, we must exchange them for contribution points.”

“Ask him how many contribution points he will exchange for the Poluo God parts, and then we will distribute them according to our respective shares,” Heavy Master said.

“Okay, I’ll ask him now.” Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and immediately sent a message to Axe One Master.

“My young friend, you said you got the Poluo God parts?” Axe One Master could not help being surprised when he received Jian Wushuang’s message.

After all, the Poluo God component was quite famous in the Universe Battlefield, and its value was extremely precious. Jian Wushuang had obtained a Poluo God component not long after he set off for Devil Smoke Valley. It was truly a rare stroke of luck.

“Axe One Master, this Poluo God component was obtained by me, Saber Python Master, and Heavy Master together. Now, I want to ask how many contribution points this Poluo God component can be exchanged for in the true treasure vault, so that we can share it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well...” Axe One Master pondered for a moment, then he said, “Although there have been a lot of Poluo God parts in the universe, not many of them have been spread in the Universe Battlefield. There are also people who are eager to get a Poluo God part. As far as I know, two of them have obtained two Poluo God parts and are eager to get a third one. Their prices are also very high, so the Poluo God part is naturally very valuable.”

“If you want to exchange it for contribution points, you can get 350 contribution points.”

“350 contribution points?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and cut off the communication.

“Blood Sword Master, what do you think?” The Heavy Master and the Saber Python Master looked at Jian Wushuang eagerly, especially the Saber Python Master.

After all, he could get 20% of the total contribution points. In his opinion, 20% should be a significant amount of contribution points. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Ladies and gentlemen, the contribution points given by Axe One Master are 350 points,” Jian Wushuang said.

“350 points?”

Upon hearing this number, Saber Python Master and Heavy Master were stunned at first, but then they were overjoyed.

“Haha, I knew it. The value of the Poluo God parts is very shocking. It must be higher than the value of an ordinary advanced universe true treasure. Now it seems that it is true!” Saber Python Master laughed loudly.

“350 contribution points. That’s close to the value of an advanced universe true treasure armor. Haha, we really made a profit this time,” Heavy Master said with a laugh.

Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face. After all, he had never been to the Star Palace true treasure vault, so he had no idea about these contribution points. He had thought that 350 contribution points was not a big number, however, judging from the expressions of Saber Python Master and Heavy Master, the contribution points should be quite a lot.

“Gentlemen, are 350 contribution points a lot?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, of course.” Saber Python Master nodded. “Blood Sword Master, let me put it this way. In the Star Palace’s true treasure vault, ordinary offensive magic weapons at the level of elementary universe true treasures can only be exchanged for 10 contribution points, while offensive magic weapons at the level of advanced universe true treasures can only be exchanged for 100 contribution points. As for the Poluo God parts, they are directly exchanged for 350 contribution points, which is equivalent to the price of three and a half advanced universe true treasures.”

“That’s right. Purple Sound Master and I can only get 10% of the total, but that’s still 35 contribution points, which is equivalent to three and a half low-level universe true treasure attack weapons. I exchanged my true treasure armor for Purple Sound Master, and that true treasure armor was only worth 42 contribution points.”

“This time, Purple Sound and I came to Devil Smoke Valley to find a way to get more contribution points to exchange for the true treasure armor, and now, almost all of them have returned. The point is, I didn’t take any risks when I got these contribution points,” Heavy Master said with a laugh, his face was full of surprise and joy.

Purple Sound Master, who was beside him, was also smiling.
