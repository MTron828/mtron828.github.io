They were too close indeed! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

With such close distance, although Jian Wushuang had just performed the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, and Lei Xin only paused for a moment in shock, Jian Wushuang’s Twilight move had already attacked him.

Splash!

The sword light momentarily pierced Lei Xin’s head and shattered his Life Core.

Lei Xin, an expert at Step Five of the Enteral Realm, had died!

After slaying Lei Xin, Jian Wushuang took away his Interspatial Ring and treasures, and then stood there, looking at the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand with his eyes blazing.

“It’s at Step Six!”

“Previously, I did my best but my battle strength could only reach the top of Step Five. But with the Blood Mountain Sword, my battle strength soared to Step Six.”

“Moreover, this sword is so powerful that with only five blows, it shattered Lei Xin’s Eternal Weapon.”

“This sword is… so terrifying!”

Terrifying!

That was what Jian Wushuang really thought about the Blood Mountain Sword.

“It is indeed a sword that Xuan Yi refined himself. It is worthy of being a supreme magic weapon that is above the Eternal Realm!” Jian Wushuang marveled at the Blood Mountain Sword in his heart.

The power of this sword was far beyond his imagination.

“Unfortunately, I am too weak to urge its full power now. But a small fraction of the power that I could urge is enough to make me much more powerful. When I break through to the Eternal Realm and even become a Dao Master, I should be able to exert all its power. How formidable will I be then?”

Jian Wushuang secretly looked forward to it.

In fact, he still had a slight distance from the Eternal Realm, let alone to become a Dao Master.

In a short period of time, it was impossible for him to fully exert the power of Blood Mountain Sword.

Jian Wushuang regained his composure after a moment.

“Lei Xin is dead, then… ” Jian Wushuang murmured, and looked far away at the other battlefield with a chill in his eyes.

In another battlefield, his Puppet Fighter of the Eternal Realm was fighting against Mr. Wu furiously.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had ordered the Puppet Fighter to pester Mr. Wu so that he wouldn’t have a chance to interfere with Jian Wushuang’s fight with Lei Xin. Thus, the Puppet Fighter didn’t do his best, but he still crushed Mr. Wu.

Mr. Wu’s panic increased when he saw Jian Wushuang in the battlefield.

“What happened?” Mr. Wu looked around blankly, and asked, “Why are you here alone? Where’s Lei Xin?”

He had just been overwhelmed by the Puppet Fighter. Moreover, the two battlefields were far apart, so he did not witness Jian Wushuang killing Lei Xin.

“Lei Xin?” Jian Wushuang looked at Mr. Wu with a thin smile, and answered, “He’s dead. If you want to find him, I can send you to see him.”

“Lei Xin is dead?” Mr. Wu glared at him, but then shook his head and said, “That’s impossible. You’re just a Divine Realm expert. How can you kill Lei Xin?”

“You’ll know in a minute whether I can kill him or not, because you’ll die too!” Jian Wushuang said fiercely, the viciousness in his eyes raging.

Now he had killed Lei Xin and suppressed Su Ming. Actually, the goal had been achieved.

But because of Mr. Wu’s appearance, he had to have his Puppet Fighter to fight against him. You knew, every strike the Puppet Fighter of the Eternal Realm made would cost a great deal of Divine Gems.

The fierce battle between Jian Wushuang and Lei Xin lasted for a long time, during which the Puppet Fighter kept fighting with Mr. Wu and consumed more than 10 million Divine Gems.

The cost was too great that Jian Wushuang had to kill Mr. Wu to cover it.

“Kill him now!” Jian Wushuang ordered without hesitation.

Upon hearing the command, the three-meter-high Puppet Fighter exerted his real power. At the same time, millions of Divine Gems in Jian Wushuang’s Interspatial Ring were immediately consumed, and he darted towards Mr. Wu at an alarming speed.

He was going too fast!

It was far beyond what an expert at Step Five of the Eternal Realm could do, even the average experts at Step Six of the Eternal Realm could not move so fast.

“Why is he so fast?” Mr. Wu looked terrified. In the meanwhile, he also noticed that Jian Wushuang was coming to him.

“Damn it!”

He tried to flee, but the Eternal Realm Puppet Fighter had caught up.

As the Puppet Fighter held his right hand, his fist condensed terrifying power, and then burst out at Mr. Wu.

The power contained in this fist was much more powerful than that of the previous one.

It was an earth-shaking blow with the power that had reached the peak of Step Six of the Eternal Realm, and Mr. Wu had sensed it clearly.

His eyes were blank and his heart was filled with despair.

But at this moment…

“Humph!”

A cold snort like a sudden explosion of thunder from the calm void suddenly sounded on the sea.

This cold hum also carried a terrifying power, which hit the Puppet Fighter immediately.

The Puppet Fighter’s attack was immediately resolved, and his three-meter-high figure retreated like a cannonball. He rolled over continuously and only regained his position after a long while.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The Puppet Fighter had gone all out, and burst the battle strength of the peak of Step Six. Generally speaking, he could compete with an expert at the peak of Step Six of the Eternal Realm.

But now, he had not even seen the opponent, but was blasted out by a cold snort.

“How strong!”?Jian Wushuang wondered.

With a burst of buzzing, a tall figure suddenly came.

He was a bald man in a holy white robe. He looked cold and his eyes were filled with faint anger.

A suffocating horrifying pressure came out of him. As soon as Jian Wushuang noticed the pressure, he frowned and his heart tightened.

This coercion was definitely by no means from an Eternal Realm expert.

Thus, the strength of this bald man was beyond doubt.

He was a Dao Master!

Here came a Dao Master!

Seeing the sudden appearance of the bald man, desperate Mr. Wu instantly revealed a look of surprise. He looked at the man with enthusiasm in his eyes and bowed low to him.

“Pavilion Master!”

“Pay?respects to Pavilion Master!”

Mr. Wu called out excitedly.

“Pavilion Master?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

Like Lei Xin, Mr. Wu was also a man of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. Thus, the bald man was the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master!

He was one magnate of the six biggest forces on Cercis Island.

He was a real Dao Master.

“Did the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master come here because I killed Lei Xin?” Jian Wushuang wondered, knitting his brows. Then he looked at the bald man, feeling bitter and puzzled.

“This is outside of Cercis Island. Why did the Pavilion Master of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion come here?”
