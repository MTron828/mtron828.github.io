“A very big territory? How big is it?” Yin Su’er asked.

“A world,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Yin Su’er was stunned and said in surprise, “Mr. Sword One, do you mean to lead the sword union to attack a world?”

“Yes, I do, but I don’t know if it can be realized,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Knowing what Jian Wushuang was thinking, Yin Su’er could not help but sigh in her heart.

There were nine realms in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. In addition to the Pill Sun Sacred World, the other eight realms had the Immortal Saint personally overseeing them. Their overall strength was also very strong.

.

Although the Sword Alliance now had the ability to wipe out the entire Pill Sun Sacred World, it was just an extravagant hope to attack other realms, right?

However, Yin Su’er had witnessed Jian Wushuang’s growth. She had seen him rise from a Peak Great Divine Master to the strongest expert in the Pill Sun Sacred World, and he had the terrifying power to wipe out the entire Pill Sun Sacred World, it had only taken him less than 100 years.

It was incredible.

He had achieved this in less than 100 years. If he was given another 100 years... he might still have the ability to conquer the next realm.

“Let’s not talk about this for now.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “Castle Lord Su’er, I once asked you to sell the blood wilderness emperor essence, which weighed 230 kilograms. I heard from Palace Master Si Zhen that you sold it to Lord Mo, who is said to be the number one blacksmith in the Golden Crow Nine Realms?”

“Yes.” Yin Su’er nodded. “It’s true that Master Mo is the number one blacksmith in the nine realms of the Golden Crow. His refining level is at least at the top of the seventh grade. No one in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow can compare to him, and he has a good reputation. When I sold the Blood Wilderness Emperor essence to him, I sold it at a very good price, which made me a big profit.”

“In that case, you must know how to contact Master Mo. Can you contact him for me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Why? Does Mr. Sword One need Lord Mo for something?” Yin Su’er looked at him.

“To tell you the truth, it’s my magic weapon. I need Lord Mo to help me refine it again,” Jian Wushuang said.

Naturally, he was looking for Lord Mo for the blood mountain sword!

The blood mountain sword was his natal magic weapon. As his strength increased, the power of the blood mountain sword also increased.

However, the blood mountain sword was given to him by his Master Xuan. When it was forged, it did not contain the blood essence of his perfect chaotic lifeform, so the huge potential hidden in the blood mountain sword had not been fully unleashed yet.

Back in the sorcerer desert region, he had asked that fourth-grade blacksmith Master Kun to help him forge the golden armor, but it was a pity that Master Kun did not have the ability to reforge the blood mountain sword. Moreover, he had told him at the time that he had to be at least a seventh-grade blacksmith, only then did he have the qualification to refine the blood mountain sword again.

He had been paying attention to Master Mo ever since he had heard about him from Palace Master Si Zhen.

Now there was no conflict within the Pill Sun Sacred World. As for the Heavenly Void World... because of some restrictions in the Golden Crow Nine Worlds, the Heavenly Void Palace Master could not personally come to the Pill Sun Sacred World. After the defeat of the army he had sent, it would not be easy to stop the second war.

In other words, the Pill Sun Sacred World had basically settled down, and Jian Wushuang’s strength was enough to travel in the Golden Crow Nine Worlds. Naturally, he wanted to look for Lord Mo and ask him to help him refine the blood mountain sword again.

“Look for Lord Mo to refine a magic weapon?” Yin Su’er frowned slightly. “Mr. Sword One, you don’t know this. Although Lord Mo has a good reputation, he is an extremely arrogant person. His identity is also very honorable. Not only is he the number one artifact master in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, but he is also an extremely powerful Immortal Saint.

“Because of this, it is very difficult to see him on a daily basis. There are many powerful Great Divine Masters in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. It is said that there are even Immortal Saints who go to visit him. However, most of them will not see him unless it is something that benefits them greatly.

“For example, someone paid a great price to ask him to refine a holy treasure or some treasures that interested him. Last time, when I went to visit him with the blood wilderness emperor essence, although I sold it to him, Lord Mo never came to see me.”

“You didn’t see Lord Mo last time?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Yes.” Yin Su’er smiled bitterly. “It’s so difficult just to see him. As for asking him to help you refine the divine weapon again... it’s even more difficult and the price to pay is ridiculously high.”

“How much?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Under normal circumstances, this Lord Mo can help you refine 300,000 saint elixirs once,” Yin Su’er said.

“300,000 saint elixirs?” Jian Wushuang could not help but be shocked.

300,000 saint elixirs were too much.

After all, they had defeated the four top forces last time. They had only obtained 200,000 saint elixirs from the four top forces and the experts he had killed, this was almost 70% of the resources of the four top forces.

But now, Lord Mo needed 300,000 sacred elixirs just to refine it once?

“That’s not right. Even a ready-made holy treasure magic weapon doesn’t need 100,000 sacred elixirs. He asked for 300,000 right away. Who would ask him to refine a holy treasure?” Jian Wushuang asked. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“No, no, Mr. Sword One, I’m afraid you’re mistaken.” Yin Su’er shook her head and said, “The Holy Treasure Saber you gave me last time is indeed of low value and not worth 100,000 sacred treasures. But this holy treasure saber is completely different from the holy treasure that Lord Mo refined personally.”

“The Holy Treasure Saber refined by Lord Mo is a natal magic weapon. It can be connected to the essence blood of the Immortal Saint and continuously grow. The value of such a natal magic weapon at the level of a holy treasure is far beyond that of an ordinary holy treasure.”

“Natal Magic Weapon?” Jian Wushuang suddenly understood.

If Lord Mo had refined a natal magic weapon at the level of a holy treasure, then it was indeed worth the price.

Because a life-bound divine weapon at the level of a holy treasure was definitely worth more than a million holy elixirs, or even more.

Unfortunately, the life-bound divine weapon was only effective on the master who was connected to him by blood and sweat. But if it fell into the hands of others, it would only be an ordinary holy treasure divine weapon.

“300,000 holy elixirs is not a small amount. I Can’t afford so many holy elixirs now.”

“However, even if I take out the existing sacred elixirs, I should still have treasures of equal value.” Jian Wushuang secretly smiled.
