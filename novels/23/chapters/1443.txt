Pak!

Pang Bo charged forward and the deck broke as a terrifying aura swept in all directions.

“Ninth Thunder Sword!”

Pang Bo was raging with a fierce aura as the green saber in his hand was engulfed in green bolts of thunder. He suddenly appeared before Jian Wushuang and slashed with the green saber. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

There was a total of nine sword lights and everyone had a boundless power of thunder.

Most importantly, not only were the nine sword lights getting stronger with every stroke, their speed grew with every stroke.

Jian Wushuang concentrated and Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand. He erupted his divine power and greeted his opponent.

The clashing of blades was heard. The nine continuous clashes caused great impact and Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but retreat.

On the other hand, Pang Bo looked even more triggered.

There was an armor made of green thunder protecting his body out of nowhere.

He wore a thunder armor and held a green thunder saber. Pang Bo then looked like he had transformed into a thunder God.

“Twelve Thunder Sword!”

Pang Bo again wielded his saber fiercely, but by then it was a total of twelve sword lights.

“This sword technique is quite impressive. Although it isn’t on the level of Real God, from the continuous overlapping of accumulated power, the last one could barely be comparable with Real God unique skill. No wonder he was said to be close to the standard of one on Universe God ranking list,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He could tell that Pang Bo’s power couldn’t be much weaker than the top genius of Dark Phoenix Pavilion who was a Universe God in the Third Heaven, Lin Xue.

The twelve sword lights descended one after another.

Jian Wushuang immediately raised his sword to block. He blocked eleven sword lights in an instant.

When the last sword light had descended, Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, the Bleeding Technique!”

Rumble!

A terrifying crimson light suddenly exploded and the entire void drowned in a crimson ocean.

In the crimson ocean, a scarlet sword light soared along with boundless power, including the slight bit of Power of Reincarnation that Jian Wushuang comprehended.

The scarlet sword light collided with the last sword light that Pang Bo had performed directly.

Bang!

There was a loud, vigorous noise before the entire spaceship broke entirely. The terrifying divine power shattered it while the people on the spaceship fall and dispersed into all directions from the impact.

In the midst of the divine storm, a figure suddenly retreated and finally regained his stability. The person was Pang Bo.

“So strong. Such strength!”

Pang Bo was still engulfed in the green thunder but his palm started shivering. Both arms were going numb.

Jian Wushuang gradually revealed his figure among the divine storm. His face turned cold as he stared at Pang Bo, “No wonder experts on Universe God ranking list couldn’t kill you, your defense power is not bad. However, with you alone, you’re not qualified to be my opponent yet. Let the person behind come forth.”

“The person behind?”

Su Hong and the people from Hong Ri Mercenary Group were stunned.

“Haha, very well. You could identify my existence.”

A malicious laughter suddenly burst out. Then, there was a figure in crimson robe that floated out from the delicate crimson spaceship and appeared before everyone.

He looked cold but he was wearing a creepy smile as he measured Jian Wushuang up and down. Although he looked calm, every Universe God from Hong Ri Mercenary Group stiffened at the sight of him.

Jian Wushuang’s face also grew grave when he see the approaching person.

“Expert!”

“He is at least ten times stronger than Pang Bo, Lin Xue from Dark Phoenix Pavilion, or even Hou Yi who defeated Lim Xue and declared that he was going to challenge an expert on Universe God ranking list!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

He lit up his Soul Power and he could clearly sense the boundless pressure that the other person was giving him.

“Zhao Han, number seventy-six on Universe God ranking list!” The man in the crimson robe, Zhao Han, smiled faintly.

Hearing what he had said, everyone from Hong Ri Mercenary Group were shocked.

“An expert on the Universe God ranking list?”

Shocking!

To people from Hong Ri Mercenary Group, Pang Bo, who was close to the standard of one on Universe God ranking list, was already an existence that was beyond reach.

Let alone Zhao Han who was truly an expert on Universe God ranking list.

“As expected.”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t surprised.

To be able to place such great pressure on him, only experts on Universe God ranking list could do so.

On the Universe God ranking list, there was a total of a hundred top experts. Although Zhao Han was only on the seventy-sixth, even the strongest Universe God in the Third Heaven in Lineage of Star was only on the fifty-first on Universe God ranking list, which was not much stronger than Zhao Han.

“I do not kill any nobody. Tell me your real name. Don’t try to fool me with a pseudonym like Jian Ke,” Zhao Han spoke in a cool tone.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and replied, “Star Palace, Jian Wushuang!”

“I see. A genius disciple of Star Palace from Lineage of Star. No wonder you have such power,” Zhao Han said, “Lineage of Star, overlord of Purple Moon Sanctuary in Star land. Such great power, normally no one has the guts to provoke them while disciples of Star Palace are Lineage of Star’s precious. Whoever kills disciples of Star Palace will definitely trigger Lineage of Star. However, I, Zhao Han, happen to be the kind of person who isn’t afraid of anything.”

“If you intend to kill me, you can’t do it with words,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Of course.”

Zhao Han’s smile turned cold and there was suddenly a terrifying aura soaring from his body. Simultaneously, boundless divine power flowed out and formed an illusionary image of a huge golden bear in an instant.

“Jian Wushuang, let me see just how capable are you as a disciple of Star Palace.”

Zhao Han fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang and his figure shook the next moment.

The void before Jian Wushuang shattered while Zhao Han appeared from the shattered void. He swung his palm that was covered in faint gold light.

Then, the huge golden bear too swung its paw ferociously.

Hong!

The golden paw continuously grew and suddenly covered a range of more than a hundred miles. The void within the range shattered and collapsed.

The terrifying force locked Jian Wushuang within.

“Such power?” Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

“Jian Wushuang, be careful. Zhao Han is just like you. He has already comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heavenway and he has grasped the Myriad Beasts Doctrine in the Nine Heaven God Doctrine. This scariest part about the doctrine is its attack power. Not only is it strong, it is also extremely ferocious,” King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Myriad Beasts Doctrine?” Jian Wushuang smirked, “We shall see if his Myriad Beasts Doctrine is stronger or if my Reincarnation Doctrine is more powerful!”
