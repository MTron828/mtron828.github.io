5064 The Arrival of Uncle Yu

However, he quickly rejected this idea. The form of the Heaven-patterned Bone Armor was very simple. It used some unknown bone piece as a carrier to engrave unknown words.

Moreover, judging from the Heaven-patterned Bone Armor in his hand, each one of them had existed for too long and was barren.

Jian Wushuang guessed that these bone armors had existed for a long time, probably longer than the Ancient Era.

It was also because of the fact that the form of the Heaven-patterned Bone Armor was too simple that he was certain that the crystal in his hand could not be a carrier of words.

“But what’s with this inexplicable sense of familiarity?” Jian Wushuang frowned and kept rubbing the six-sided crystal.

It was not until this moment that he discovered that when viewed from a certain angle, there was actually a vertical pupil in the center of the six-sided crystal! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The vertical pupil was incredibly vivid, as if it contained life, and when Jian Wushuang looked at it, it seemed to make eye contact with him!

Almost at the same time as their eye contact, he felt a rapidly encroaching and enticing power that he couldn’t resist, quickly eroding his Divine Sense.

Jian Wushuang was shocked. He used Perfected Divine Sense to cancel out the bewitching power.

At this moment, Cui Jing’s anxious voice sounded.

“Big Brother Jian, are you alright?”

He raised his head and saw Cui Jing, Feng Shan, and the others surrounding him. They were all looking at him anxiously.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief. “I’m fine. It’s good that you’re all here.”

“You gave us a scare, Boss. You’ve been standing here for two or three hours. We thought you were about to have a breakthrough,” Feng Shan said casually. “It wasn’t until we saw your pale face that we realized something was wrong.”

“Two, two or three hours?” Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled, clearly understanding the significance of this.

What had been completed in an instant had somehow passed two or three hours in the blink of an eye. There was only one possibility.

When he locked eyes with the Vertical Pupil within the Ling Crystal, he had inadvertently been drawn into an illusion. However, because his Divine Sense had already reached a perfected state, the vertical pupil could not further entice him.

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief. He had a vague understanding of the Prism Crystal True Eye in his palm.

It was impossible for Qin Tuo or even the Shangjun Sect to have such a thing. It was too treacherous.

For some reason, Jian Wushuang felt a strong sense of familiarity.

But other than that, he knew nothing else.

After hesitating for a moment, Jian Wushuang put the Prism Crystal True Eye into his bosom.

“It’s really unexpected that the entire sect would self-destruct into extinction,” Chen Qing sighed. “Well, at least we don’t have to do the dirty work ourselves.”

With one last glance at the now-ruined Heavenly Region plane, Jian Wushuang and Chen Qing turned away.

As one of the top super forces in the Great Si region, Shangjun Sect’s sphere of influence already included nearly 15 Heavenly Regions, and the disciples they cultivated were spread all over the Heavenly Regions.

However, after this battle, the core of the sect was reduced to ruins, and the Sect Master and Elders were all dead.

The Shangjun Sect had declined from then on.

Cui Jing, Feng Shan, Wei Liujia, and the others were safe and sound. They returned to the Six Heavens Realm.

To Jian Wushuang, this was just a small interlude after he woke up. There was no earth-shaking battle.

Only the Prism Crystal True Eye left him feeling uneasy.

After returning to Little Lonely Heaven, just as Jian Wushuang was about to carefully examine the Prism Crystal True Eyes, the Young Emperor arrived at Little Lonely Heaven.

“No… Brother Jian, prepare well. Uncle Yu has come from the Heavenly Court to see you.”

Walking into the hall and finding everyone gathered there, the Young Emperor straightened his clothing and spoke seriously.

The others exchanged glances and then looked at Jian Wushuang together.

Jian Wushuang was also slightly surprised. He did not know why Uncle Yu had come to find him.

After pondering for a moment, he nodded and stood up.

“Big brother, we’ll go with you,” Cui Jing stood up and said.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, “No need. I’ll be back soon. It’s not a big problem.”

“Let’s go, Uncle Yu has been waiting for a long time.” The Young Emperor raised his eyebrows and smiled.

Then, the two stepped into the air and disappeared.

“Big brother Jian, are you sure there won’t be any problems on this trip?” Cui Jing stood in front of the hall, expressing some concern.

“What could go wrong? Even if Emperor Zhen Wuyuang himself came, Brother Jian would handle it with ease,” Chen Qing said confidently. “Let’s continue our diligent practice and catch up to Brother Jian’s pace.”

Since entering the Great Solitude Sky, Jian Wushuang had been frowning as if he were reminiscing about something.

He found that his memory seemed to have some gaps, with a certain period of it being blurry, no matter how hard he tried to remember what had happened.

He only vaguely remembered that Uncle Yu was abnormally powerful. At the end of the Endless Sea, it was Uncle Yu who appeared and brought him out of the Endless Sea.

However, the memories after the Endless Sea became exceptionally fuzzy, and he couldn’t recall them no matter how hard he tried.

“Could some of these memories be related to Uncle Yu?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brow, naturally associating his missing memories with Uncle Yu.

Perhaps he could see the worry in his heart, the Young Emperor smiled and comforted him, “Don’t worry too much. Uncle Yu is here this time to return something you left with him.”

“I hope so,” Jian Wushuang replied.

At the same time, he felt a little uneasy. After all, not only were the True Souls of the three Emperors stored in the Boyang Bottle, but more than half of his fortuitous encounters and trump cards were also inside.

Regardless of what was inside, if Uncle Yu or Zhen Wuyang discovered it, the consequences would be dire.

So, Jian Wushuang’s heart was still heavy.

When he entered the Heavenly Palace where the Young Emperor resided, a black-robed elder seemed to have been waiting there for a while. He smiled and said, “Young Friend, long time no see.”

Jian Wushuang cupped his hands in return. “Greetings, Uncle Yu.”

“There’s no need to be so formal. Let’s sit down and have a chat.” Uncle Yu smiled and pulled him to his seat.

The Young Emperor sat down next to Uncle Yu and said with a smile, “What a rare guest, Uncle Yu. How could you bear to leave the Heavenly Court and come to my place?”

Uncle Yu chuckled, “Of course, there’s an important matter to discuss, or else I wouldn’t have the leisure to travel through the Heavenly Realms.”

“Get to the point, I want to hear if it benefits me,” he winked, showing some excitement.

Uncle Yu shook his head with a smile. “This time, you won’t get a share. I’m here mainly to return some things to my Young Friend, something he left with me.”

Saying that, Uncle Yu reached into his waist and placed a small jade bottle, green and white intertwined, on the table.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed, and his heartbeat quickened.

This green and white jade bottle was no ordinary item; it was the Boyang Bottle.
