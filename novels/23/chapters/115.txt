Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Near Quiet Moon Lake, a charcoal fire was burning brightly and the area was filled with noise.

It was near nightfall when the fight for the Black Water Lotus finished. Therefore, most of the warriors were still here.

A number of warriors in the Gold Core Realm gathered together in twos or threes, busy talking about the magnificent battle between Jian Wushuang and Xiao Mang.

“Who is the black-robed swordsman? How does a warrior in the Initial Gold Core Realm have such terrifying battle strength?”

“His name seems to be Swordsman. It is said that he is a disciple of Dragon Palace.”

“A disciple of Dragon Palace? So that is why he is powerful.”

Those warriors of the Gold Core Realm glanced, from time to time, towards the black-robed adolescent who was practicing his sword skills.

The black-robed adolescent brandished his long sword, slowly practising his sword skills.

Seeing one slash followed by another one, people suffered from a delusion that his sword chopping into a pall of cotton instead of the air.

Extremely weird.

The experts with relatively sharp eyes immediately recognized what was happening.

“Essence of the Waterdop!”

“It’s Essence of the Waterdrop!”

“Swordsman comprehended Essence of the Waterdrop!”

“He had already comprehended the Sword Essences of Gale, Earth, and Raging Fire sword before. Now, he has comprehended Sword Essence of the Waterdrop. He has comprehended four different Essences!”

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang with surprise.

“Exceptional genius!”

“Monster!”

“Four different Sword Essences at the same time. Quite brave isn’t he?”

After a round of loud exclamation, everyone present was astonished.

The expressions of the experts from the Earthly Dragon List were also complex.

A man who comprehending four essences at the same time, should be regarded as crazy rather than corageous.

Jian Wushuang actually dared to do it.

But it was not impossible for him to comprehend four essences at the same time after the awakening of Sword Soul.

The two assassin teams, called Blood Shadow, were hiding on the top of a big tree near Jian Wushuang while he was practicing. The leader, Darkblader, stared at Jian Wushuang with his dark eyes.

“Sword Essence of the Waterdrop” Darkblader was also surprised. After all, he was informed that Jian Wushuang had comprehended three different Sword-Essences, Gale, Earth, and Raging Fire.

“It’s very brave for Jian Wushuang to comprehend four Sword-Essences at the same time,” Darkblader mocked. “He’s concentrating right now as he practices his swordsmanship. The possibility of a sneak attack succeeding is very low if I attack now. The best time would be the instant he puts his sword away after finishing his practice. At that moment, his attention and concentration will wander.”

Those golden-masked assassins were waiting silently.

“Hum~~~!”

The sword light was fleeting like a wave, soft but tough.

One move after another. They looked slow, but ever move contained a mighty power.

The sword light suddenly stabbed toward the void and engendered a stream of a substantial wave.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and slightly smiled. “It’s the indeed the Black Water Lotus Seed which induced such a bloody fight. I easily comprehended Sword-Essence of the Waterdrop soon after swallowing it. And my comprehension has even reached the Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate.”

To normal warriors of the Gold Core Realm, comprehension that reached the Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate was very high. Even Jian Wushuang barely squeaked through the Fourth Level by earnestly cultivating for three months before joining Dragon Palace.

But now his comprehension in Sword-Essence of the Waterdrop easily reached this level because of the Black Water Lotus Seed.

Hoo!

Exhaling a breath, Jian Wushuang put away his sword without realizing the hidden peril that surrounded him.

At the same time he was putting away his sword…

“Now is our chance!” The hidden Darkblader silently floated down, like a phantom, towards Jian Wushuang.

At this time, Jian Wushuang’s expression relaxed.

“Third brother.” Su Rou, who had been watching Jian Wushuang, walked toward him and said, “Congratulations! You have comprehended another Sword-Essence.”

After congratulating Jian Wushuang on his breakthrough, she suddenly sensed a hint of crisis from her heart.

Even the target, Jian Wushuang, didn’t sense it, but Su Ro sensed it.

“Third brother. Watch out!” Su Rou shouted suddenly.

“What?” Jian Wushuang became alarmed and all his pores opened in an instant.

A sense of unprecedented crisis filled Jian Wushuang. Then a black light emerged silently behind Jian Wushuang with a cold and dark luster.

“This…”

It was so fast that Jian Wushuang did not have time to respond.

“Heh. Comprehend four sword essences. So what? Defeated Xiao Mang. So what?”

“You finished your practice just now. Your previous concentration of sense and spirit are wandering. Right now is when you are the most vulnerable. With the darkness as cover, this is the perfect opportunity to assassinate you.”

“It will be a perfect assassination. Even experts ranked in the top ten on the Earthly Dragon List would not be able to escape.”

“You will die!”

Darkblader smiled coldly. At this time, he could see the image of Jian Wushuang being killed by him.

However, a swift gust of wind rushed forward, followed by two streams of wind passed through the space and appeared in front of him. His black light, which nearly stabbed into Jian Wushuang, was parried by the wind. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“How could that be?” Darkblader was surprised.

He had been confident in this assassination. Jian Wushuang was not able to react and was going to die. The truth was that Jian Wushuang didn’t react. However, Su Rou made it.

Su Ro not only perceived but even parried this killing attack. He realized that terrifying burst of power came from Su Rou.

“This woman.” Darkblader looked at Su Rou in shock.

How could she react?

Such a perfect assassination. Only an expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm should have been able to respond, so how did she react in time?

That cold and dark black light was parried by two jets of wind. However, the power of the black light was much stronger, so the wind was easily destroyed. Subsequently, the black light still stabbed toward Jian Wushuang.

Thanks to the wind hindering the black light for a while, Jian Wushuang was able to swerve drastically. Watching as this black light approached his body to within less than half a centimeter, his pores immediately opened and cold sweat ran down his back.

But in the next moment, an endless anger erupted.

“Blood Feather Tower!”

Seeing this gold-masked figure, killing intent poured out from Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Go to hell!”

Boom!

After a swift and violent explosion of sword essence, a foggy sword shadow which was extremely aggressive headed for Darkblader.

“Not good.” Darkblader felt a sense of fear in his heart. He was well versed in assassination, he was much weaker in direct combat. Then he quickly parried with the black light.

BANG!

The terrifying foggy sword shadow pounded on the black light, which was a cold black dagger. But, the terrifying power of the attack caused the black dagger to slide out of Darkblader’s hand.

Many figures rushed towards Jian Wushuang as he attacked Darkblader again, trying to kill him directly.
