Chapter 3042: Xue Bei

_________

“In any case, since you have passed the Di Mountain test I left behind, what I left behind in this secret realm will naturally belong to you.”

Hearing the handsome man’s words, Jian Wushuang was also delighted.

This handsome man was a genuine principles master, and he was also a principles master who had opened a secret realm.

As far as Jian Wushuang knew, principles masters were superior, but there were differences in strength.

Most principles masters who were weaker could not open a secret realm of heaven and earth.

Those who could open a secret realm of heaven and earth were definitely the best among principles masters.

Moreover, on the way to the depths of the secret realm, he saw a lot of sarcophagi. In addition to many top-notch and Invincible Immortal Saints, there were two principles master sarcophagi, the handsome man had also killed the two principles masters.

To be able to kill principles masters and two principles masters at that, one could imagine the strength of the handsome man.

Jian Wushuang was naturally eager to get the things left in the secret realm by such a super existence.

“Before you get what I Left, you must remember my name. My name is Xue Bei and I come from the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, the bloodline of the blood ancestor.” The handsome man’s voice sounded again.

“Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect? The bloodline of the blood ancestor?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He had never heard of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect or the bloodline of the blood ancestor.

He had only heard of the Blood Clan, which was one of the four great divine clans of the Divine Beginning World.

However, the Blood Clan and the bloodline of the blood ancestor were clearly two different things.

Seeing the confusion on Jian Wushuang’s face, Xue bei asked, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, you haven’t left the endless territory, have you?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had been born in the endless territory. Although he was full of longing and yearning for the vast third heaven, he had never been there before because he was not strong enough.

“That’s right. Born in the endless territory, you haven’t really explored the third heaven, so your horizons are limited. It’s normal that you haven’t heard of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect.” Xue Bei said, “Although you haven’t heard of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, you can still come into contact with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance with your strength.”

“I know about the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. I’m now a heaven-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Heaven-level?” Xue Bei glanced at Jian Wushuang and nodded slightly. “The Heaven-cleaving Alliance is recognized as the most powerful freedom alliance in the Divine Beginning World. However, there are many powerful freedom alliances in the Divine Beginning World. There are three of them, and the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is only one of them.”

“Three freedom alliances?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “The Heaven-cleaving Alliance is only one of the three freedom alliances? Then the other two freedom alliances are…”

“The remaining two freedom alliances are the Spacetime Temple and the Divine ancestor Daoist sect,” Xue Bei said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He knew about the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the three freedom alliances.

He also knew about the Spacetime Temple, and it must be related.

After all, the two spacetime divine skills he had obtained from the golden stone came from the Spacetime Temple!

According to the information in the golden stone, he had already entered the Spacetime Gate, so he was a member of the Spacetime Temple.

“The Spacetime Temple is one of the three strongest freedom alliances in the Divine Beginning World?” Jian Wushuang was a little shocked.

He had guessed that the Spacetime Temple must be extremely powerful and that the Temple Master who created it must be unfathomable. Now it seemed that it was true.

One of the three freedom alliances in the Divine Beginning World was on par with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Although the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was ranked first and recognized as the strongest, the fact that the Spacetime Temple was on par with it was enough to show how terrifying the Spacetime Temple was.

This was the case for the Temporal Temple as well as for the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Of the three great freedom alliances, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is the strongest and has the largest number of branches. It is not an exaggeration to say that it has spread to every corner of the Divine Beginning World. However, the Temporal Temple is different from the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. The Temporal Temple is the most mysterious and its methods are also very impressive. Most of the powerful warriors within the temple have comprehended the principles of time and space. And these powerful warriors who are proficient in the principles of time and space have used their most powerful methods to create a special patch of time and space, making it difficult for others to find them.”

“Especially the mysterious Temple Master of the Spacetime Temple. His comprehension of the principles of spacetime is widely recognized as the number one person in the Divine Beginning World. His ability to use spacetime is unparalleled, and he is definitely one of the best among the countless cultivators in the entire Divine Beginning World.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked, but he was not surprised.

The Temple Master of the spacetime temple had created the spacetime divine skill himself. Jian Wushuang had already experienced how powerful the spacetime divine skill was.

“Finally, it’s the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect. The Divine Ancestor Daoist sect is not as extensive. Most of its power is concentrated in the third heaven. Although the Divine Ancestor is the leader of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, it has many factions under its command. My Blood Ancestor faction is one of them,” Xue Bei said.

“Senior, with your strength, you should be at the top of the Blood Ancestor faction, right?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

Xue Bei was a powerful Principles Master who could open a secret realm of heaven and earth. Such a rule master was a peak expert in the entire Divine Beginning World. Among the factions under the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, he should be ranked among the top.

“You can say that.” Xue Bei nodded slightly. “I belong to the blood ancestor’s lineage. There are more than ten masters of principles, but there are only two who can match my strength. Back then, I was a great general in the blood ancestor’s lineage!”

As Xue Bei spoke, his gaze became Misty. It was as if he had recalled everything he had experienced over the long years.

“I once fought my way into a sect alone, killed four rule masters, and left unhurriedly!”

“I was lucky enough to accept the invitation to participate in the Heaven Lake Banquet where the top experts gathered!”

“I once participated in the world-ending war with the experts of the blood ancestor’s bloodline!”

“I was even lucky enough to go to the universe battlefield with the blood ancestor!”

Xue Bei’s voice was rather ethereal.

Hearing his words, Jian Wushuang’s expression was very strange.

“The Heaven Lake Feast? The world-ending war from countless years ago? The Universe Battlefield?” Jian Wushuang murmured. He was very unfamiliar with these things.

However, he also knew that he was only an Immortal Saint and had stayed in the endless territories. He had not been to the third heaven, the core of the Divine Beginning World. It was normal that he did not know many things.

However, Xue Bei’s words still made Jian Wushuang’s blood boil and his heart filled with yearning.

After a long time, Xue Bei seemed to calm down.

“Forget it, it’s all in the past.”

His voice also became low.
