1923 It“s Him!

“Palace Master!!!”

Among the crowd, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun and Hall Master Yuan, who were far away, clenched their hands as their eyes shimmered with light.

Lineage of Star, since its establishment, had had two palace masters.

Both the palace masters were shocking.

It was Master of Star Palace previously and then, it was Jian Wushuang!

They were the mainstays of Lineage of Star, also the God in all experts and disciples’ hearts of Lineage of Star!!

Even though they were defeated before, they had never yielded nor lowered their heads!

No matter how powerful their opponents were, they swore to fight a beautiful battle!

They were their palace masters!!!

At the core of the boundless void, Abysmal Saint Master glanced at the lofty continent that had descended from the sky and looked shocked.

Then, he humphed coldly and waved his sleeve. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Instantly, there were countless black lights that burst out. These lights could kill an Emperor God easily and there were more than a dozen of them.

It was almost instantly that the lights hit the lofty continent.

Rumble. There were instantly a few bangs within the descending lofty continent. The corners of the continent that were pierced by the black lights had a few holes, while boundless divine power swept out to the surroundings.

“Break!!!”

The low roar was like anger that reverberated in the sky.

Even though the lofty continent was pierced with a dozen holes, it was still sturdily held together but never broke. The lofty continent continued to press down.

Until then, it had covered Abysmal saint Master entirely.

Vroom. The terrifying power finally exploded.

The power exploded and the surrounding billion miles of void instantly became barren.

The terrifying power made everyone on the spot, including the Peak Emperor Gods, gulp.

Just like Emperor God Tian Ling, his face was extremely solemn.

Such power was totally impossible to withstand if one didn’t possess the fighting power of a Great Emperor.

Previously, he had wanted to kill Jian Wushuang, but it had only looked like a joke then.

But just then... boundless darkness swept out madly and formed a huge darkness whirlpool.

The darkness whirlpool swallowed everything in the universe mercilessly. It had also swallowed up the power that was given out from the lofty continent.

In a short while, the entire universe had resumed its tranquility and the divine power was swallowed up. The remaining huge darkness whirlpool was still spinning in madness. In the core of the darkness whirlpool, there was a figure in a black robe standing. It was Abysmal Saint Master.

“As expected!”

Looking at the sight, no one at the scene was surprised.

They knew clearly that Jian Wushuang was fighting his last battle and performing his strongest, last hit. Although it was powerful enough to move a Great Emperor move.

However, Abysmal Saint Master was the third superb existence on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, after all.

Among Great Emperors, Red Dragon King on the second place was as powerful as he was. Only the supreme Emperor Bai could be above him.

Such a powerful Emperor Bai was naturally impossible for Jian Wushuang to kill with one hit. It would be extremely difficult just to hurt him.

In the huge whirlpool, Abysmal Saint Master patted the dust on his clothes and looked at Jian Wushuang with a pair of cold eyes and a tinge of disdain.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re quite capable. After you perform the Secret Skill of Star Palace, you can still perform a hit that matches evenly with a Great Emperor’s hit. If you hadn’t used the Secret Skill of Star Palace earlier to kill Almighties Alliance but had used it the third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace in support of the technique just now to kill me... I’d be severely injured.”

What Abysmal Saint Master had said was the truth.

Jian Wushuang was giving his all to launch the final hit, which reached the level of a Great Emperor.

If he were to use the third volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace… That’d be a thousand times his current power. Even though he was an expert among the Great Emperors, he would definitely be severely injured, even if he survived under that kind of attack.

“It’s a pity that you have exhausted your limited abilities. You don’t stand a chance. Now, let me give you a ride,” Abysmal Saint Master smirked and there was black light that instantly burst out.

Although the size of the black light wasn’t big, the power contained was enough to kill any Great Emperor easily.

Because of the hit that he had performed earlier, he had used up his power of ancient tribe bloodline after he had broken seven stars all together. Jian Wushuang then had a certain level of fighting power, but it was impossible for him to withstand the hit.

“It’s going to end?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but mutter.

But suddenly...

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang stared.

He could instantly feel the unique mark that someone had left on his body suddenly become scorching hot.

A strange power swept out from the mark.

Vroom!

The black light that burst out at Jian Wushuang suddenly dispersed into thin air without any trace.

It vanished into thin air as though it didn’t exist.

A figure suddenly appeared before Jian Wushuang.

With the appearance of the figure, the surrounding universe became quiet again.

It was silent.

No one spoke anymore.

Everyone’s attention was on the figure that had suddenly appeared.

Even Jian Wushuang opened his eyes wide and he stared at the person in front of him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s him?” Jian Wushuang was shocked and terrified.

He was in a snow-white robe that wasn’t tainted with any dust.

He was icy with a tinge of arrogance. Both his hands were behind his body as he towered in the void with his slender body. There was no aura that was given out from his body, as though he was just air.

However, such a person, his eye could see nothing worthwhile all around. He looked down on every living thing in the universe. He overlooked?even heaven and earth, with his deep eyes.

He stood there without any action, without speaking, but everything in the universe lost its shine.

Just like Abysmal Saint Master, he stood erect in the core of the boundless darkness, just like the ruler of the darkness. However, when the person appeared, the surrounding darkness immediately yielded to him.

In front of the person was Abysmal Saint Master. He didn’t seem to be an expert of Great Emperor level. He couldn’t even be seen as an ordinary cultivator. It was as though he was just a nonentity.

Yes, a nonentity.

He saw nothing worthwhile.

Even though Abysmal Saint Master was only a nonentity in front of him.

Hong!

There was a sudden bang that resounded. It was from the surrounding darkness and there was a hole in the darkness prison. Then, there was a figure that plunged in at high speed.

That person was Purple Moon Emperor.

His original body had arrived at the battlefield. However, no one had noticed his arrival.

Everyone was attracted by the arrogant man in the Snow White robe in front of Jian Wushuang.
