Chapter 2149 All the Trump Cards

The ballistae were usually only found in the mortal world. Its presence was extremely rare in the Eternal Chaotic World.But the four ballistae above the Void were from the Ancient Era.

The four ballistae needed a dozen Almighties to draw the bow alone, which explained the many Almighties manning the devices.

Now, the four bows were completely drawn with the use of the Almighties’ power.

But the most precious part of the ballista was not its bow, but the black arrow on it.

The four arrows were called Heaven Piercing Arrows!

“Loose!” An Almighty shouted.

The four crossbows were released at the same time. Four black flowing lights exploded out.

It was too fast.

So fast, even a Great Emperor could not react in time.

The four ballistae were aiming for the four Great Emperors of the Three Emperors World.

The four were only First Stage Great Emperors trapped in the Dragon Imprisoning Formation, still figuring out a way to escape.

When the four black flowing lights were released, the four Great Emperors had an unprecedented sense of impending crisis.

They did not know where the sense of impending crisis came from, but by the time they had reacted, the four black flowing lights had already penetrated them.

“This is…” The four Great Emperors looked at the black arrows in shock. They could feel the devastating power the arrows had, leading them to despair.

Chi!

Chi!

Chi!

Chi!

Four black flowing lights penetrated their protective armour, going through their bodies.

Wong!

Four corpses fell straight down to the ground.

The Heaven Piercing Arrow was known for its deadliness, even during the Ancient Era.

In fact, the four ballistae could not fully bring out the power of the arrows.

But it was enough to take down a Great Emperor easily.

The Sanctuary Alliance had only managed to collect nine of such arrows since its founding. Now, they had used four in one shot.

“Star God Puppets, roll out!” Ancestor Tian Chen led out a roar.

From the front of the crowd, boom!

Hong!

Hong!

Hong!

Several violent auras erupted.

Six great beings appeared on the battlefield. They were all over ten metres tall, but not a single trace of life could be felt from within them. It was obvious that they were puppets.

However, the aura radiated by those puppets was enough to scare countless Almighties.

Star God Puppets!

They were unique puppets obtained from ancient battlefields. Each puppet required a lot of resources and divine power to operate.

But the moment they were activated, they were at pinnacle First Stage fighting power.

Now, operated by the Sanctuary Alliance at a high price, the puppets headed straight for the Three Emperors World experts.

In an instant, the Eternal Chaotic World army collided with the Three Emperors World experts.

“Die! Die!” Every single Eternal Chaotic World expert was driven by bloodlust. Most of them were in their battle formations.

Some powerful formations, like the one driven by three Emperor Gods and twelve pinnacle Sir Gods, fought directly against a Three Emperors World Great Emperor.

“Get lost!” The Great Emperor’s stone rod in his hands skyrocketed in the Void to form a huge mountain.

The mountain went straight for the formation.

With a loud bang, the formation had to retreat, but it did not collapse.

“A Great Emperor indeed. Three Emperor Gods and twelve Sir Gods working together were still forced out by him. I guess there is only one method left,” an Emperor God within the formation said solemnly.

The others understood what he meant.

Wong!

Wong!

Wong!

A peculiar force rose from the three Emperor Gods and twelve Sir Gods. It was Star Power!

At that moment, they had used the Secret Skills of Star Palace simultaneously.

Although they had only read up the Secret Skills of Star Palace’s first scroll, it was enough to increase their powers tenfold!

With their powers increased substantially, the battle formation reached a whole new level.

“We have ten breaths’ worth of time to take him down. We must at least wound him!” the leading Emperor God said, and with that, the battle formation charged towards the Great Emperor.

Both sides began their brawl once again.

In a rage, the Great Emperor raised his stone rod with much more strength.

The giant that had been formed by the battle formation threw a heavy punch.

Hong!

A loud explosion could be heard from the battlefield. The giant did not retreat at all, while the Three Emperors World Great Emperor was left wide-eyed, trembling. Blood was flowing from his mouth. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“How could this be possible?” the Great Emperor was astonished.

But the giant did not stop and seized all the remaining time it had left. Master Wu of the Eternal Chaotic World had his eyes fixed on the Great Emperor as well. Together, they had completely suppressed that Great Emperor.

One breath, two breaths… nine breaths passed in the blink of an eye.

“Last breath,” the leading Emperor God said. As the giant threw out his last punch, three flowing lights burst out of the giant’s body.

The three streaks of flowing light were in fact three purple beads. It was another trump card of the Sanctuary Alliance: the Blood Thunder Pearl.

The Blood Thunder Pearl was so strong that it was almost comparable to the blow of a Great Emperor.

Now, three of the pearls were headed towards that Great Emperor, along with Master Wu’s sword suppressing him.
