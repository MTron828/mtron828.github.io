“Double?”

Jian Wushuang and Asura were astonished.

They didn’t know how strong the third-rank armor was, but wearing the first-rank armor now, they already felt that their strength had improved significantly.

The scarlet-robed elder said, “Only Blood Eagle Guards have Blood Eagle Armor.

“The special Restriction on a piece of blood eagle armor only allows one person to bind it. That is to say, even if an outsider were to kill a Blood Eagle Guard and gain his blood eagle armor, they would be unable to bind it again. It’s useless for them.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang and Asura looked at each other with a flicker of surprise in their eyes.

“Well, now I will take you to the Treasure Vault of the Blood Eagle Guard, which is the second type of special treatment,” the elder said. After a while, they arrived in front of a pavilion.

The pavilion looked ordinary, but it was heavily guarded.

“There are countless treasures in the Treasure Vault!

“The Royal Guard has a Treasure Vault as well, but it is not comparable to ours.

“Many treasures in the Treasure Vault belong to the Imperial House’s collection. As for treasure quality, few in the Eternal World can match this Treasure Vault. Go have a look,” the elder said.

Jian Wushuang and Asura stepped into the pavilion without hesitation.

However, at first glance, Jian Wushuang did not see any treasure. All he saw was darkness.

As he was wondering about it, a strange voice suddenly echoed.

“Blood Mountain, I’m the spirit of the Treasure Vault. There are countless treasures here. You can tell me what you need, and I will give you a list of treasures that meet your requirements.”

The voice sounded like a baby.

“Spirit?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He did not expect that the Treasure Vault itself was a treasure with intelligence.

Jian Wushuang asked, “I want to know, how do we pay for treasures? Divine Gems?”

“You can use Divine Gems, but the value will be much higher. In normal cases, the treasures in the Treasure Vault are traded for points which can be obtained by completing tasks. You’ve just entered the Blood Eagle Guard and haven’t accepted any tasks yet, so your current points level is zero. You can only pay with Divine Gems,” the spirit of the Treasure Vault replied.

Jian Wushuang shrugged and said, “I need a treasure or Secret Skill that can help me hide my aura, so that even powerful Eternal Realm experts or Dao Masters can’t see through my real Realm.”

Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Realm expert, but he was very powerful. If his strength erupted, he was strong enough to challenge experts at Step Six of the Eternal Realm.

Furthermore, he was still far from reaching his limit, so he would be stronger in the future.

For a Divine Realm expert to have such a strength was incredible.

Xia Yan had been known as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, but his battle strength had barely reached Step Five, far inferior to Jian Wushuang.

Being powerful was a good thing.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang was so strong that he might inevitably attract others’ attention, or even be targeted by wicked people.

Therefore, he needed a treasure or Secret Skill that hid his aura completely.

“There are five treasures that meet your requirements. This is a list of the five treasures with detailed information.”

The spirit of the Treasure Vault’s voice sounded in his heart before a streak of Flowing Light rushed toward him. A list of treasures appeared in his hand.

Jian Wushuang immediately read it.

The five treasures were comprised of three specially-made magic tools and two high-level Secret Skills that could hide aura perfectly.

“Wow, the five treasures can really hide the aura,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a hint of joy in his eyes. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“This Secret Skill is nice. It has the lowest price among the five treasures and is relatively easy to learn, but it could only fool an ordinary Dao Master at most. More powerful experts will see through it.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head slightly and started to read the information on the second one.

“This treasure has the same function as the first one.”

Jian Wushuang scrutinized the information on the first three treasures, but he was not satisfied.

When he saw the fourth treasure, his eyes lit up.

The fourth one was called the Yin-Yang Mirror. It could transform its owner’s aura, like their spiritual power aura or bloodline aura.

It could help a Divine Realm expert disguise himself as an Eternal Realm expert.

Aided by a Yin-Yang Mirror, an Eternal Realm expert could disguise himself as a Divine Realm expert perfectly.

After the transformation, even a top Dao Master could not see through it if he did not check carefully.

“Perfect transformation of the aura?” Jian Wushuang was delighted. The Yin-Yang Mirror could not only hide his Realm, but also his bloodline aura.

When he turned into an Ancient God, he had to activate the Bloodline Power. It produced a dense bloodline aura that others could recognize easily.

With the Yin-Yang Mirror, his Ancient God Bloodline would not be exposed.

“Even a superior Dao Master is unable to see through it if he doesn’t look carefully?” Jian Wushuang gripped his hands. He looked at the required points.

“10,000 points?”

“Too expensive!”

Jian Wushuang sucked in a breath of cold air.

The most expensive of the first three treasures was only valued at 2,000 points.

However, the Yin-Yang Mirror required 10,000 points.

“10,000 points, how many Divine Gems would I have to pay?” he asked.

“You can exchange 10,000 Divine Gems for one point. For 10,000 points, you need 100 million Divine Gems,” the Treasure Vault Spirit replied.

“100 million?” Jian Wushuang touched his nose.

100 million Divine Gems was not a small sum, but Jian Wushuang was clear that the Yin-Yang Mirror was of great importance to him.

He took a deep breath before nodding solemnly. “100 million Divine Gems, I’ll take the Yin-Yang Mirror.”
