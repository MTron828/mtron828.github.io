Chapter 1556: The Third Inverse Cultivation Test Is Here!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Inverse Cultivation Test!

It was the biggest test that Jian Wushuang had to pass as an inverse cultivator.

He had experienced two inverse cultivation tests previously and passed them in extreme danger.

Among the two inverse cultivation tests, when the first inverse cultivation test had descended, there were signs a hundred and twenty years before that had allowed him to prepare for a hundred and twenty years.

For the second inverse cultivation test, the signs had come ten years before the test. He at least got to prepare for ten years.

But then, the third inverse cultivation test… There wasn’t any sign, nor did it give any time for Jian Wushuang to prepare himself. It didn’t even worry about what kind of situation Jian Wushuang was in and descended directly.

It suddenly descended as he was fighting against His Highness Mu Hong.

“Why now!”

“Why didn’t even give me any time to prepare!”

“I don’t need much. One day, it’d be great even if it was only two hours!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang roared from the bottom of his heart. Leng Ruxue was within a stone’s throw away from him. He only needed a little bit of time and he’d be able to see Leng Ruxue. He then would figure a way to suppress her. But, out of all moments, the third inverse cultivation test had descended at this critical time.

However, the inverse cultivation test was different from the previous two. There weren’t any clouds. From the outside, Jian Wushuang didn’t see changes but only he knew that he was in the process of going through the test.

“Jian Wushuang, die!”

His Highness Mu Hong’s eyes were cold with a tinge of murderous intention, he raised the green sickle high.

Wow!

A huge blade light appeared, then the air burst from the pressure and became a luxurious blade river.

Jian Wushuang’s face dimmed as he saw the luxurious blade river flowing towards him. Blood Mountain Sword in his hand immediately became a bolt of crimson lightning and suddenly swept out.

Just as the sword light swept out, Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted.

“My divine power… is weakening?”

There was a loud bang and Jian Wushuang retreated from the impact.

“Haha.”

His Highness Mu Hong laughed as he wielded his sickle and charged towards Jian Wushuang ferociously.

The blade lights swung out from his hand. He obviously wanted to crush Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately wielded his sword to block with all his strength.

However, during the process…

Jian Wushuang could clearly feel that his divine power was constantly weakening.

Not only in terms of divine power, it included his Soul Power, his comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine, Spacetime Doctrine and even Sword Principle that he had created, but they were also all weakening tremendously.

“How could it be?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked and angry.

If he were to be at his tip-top condition, when he collaborates his divine power with soul power to give full play to his power, he could totally defeat His Highness Mu Hong easily. He could even kill him.

But then, his power was deteriorating at a terrifying speed. From fighting forcefully with His Highness Mu Hong, to barely evenly matching, to being at a disadvantage, it only took an instant. Then, Jian Wushuang was almost losing.

Regardless of speed or strength, he was far behind His Highness Mu Hong.

Looking at His Highness wielding his sickle again and again, even though Jian Wushuang had blocked the blade light, Jian Wushuang was retreating at every collision due to the fierce impact.

Crushing him. It was almost torture.

“The genius in the top ten on Universe God ranking list, your ability is just like this?”

“Weak, too weak!”

“Jian Wushuang, I overestimated your power!”

His Highness Mu Hong was holding his green sickle with one hand as he overlooked Jian Wushuang coldly. There was disdain in his eyes, “I previously wondered just how amazing a top genius in Universe God ranking list could be, but from what I see now, you’re only rubbish!”

“Your kind is not worth my attention. Die!”

His Highness Mu Hong let out a green glow and the murderous intention suddenly surfaced from his body.

Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

Just then…

Hong!

A terrifying loud roar was suddenly heard from a corner of Red Stone Prison. Then, the originally sturdy Red Stone Prison that even Jian Wushuang at his peak could damage, started trembling. The surrounding red stone walls started cracking.

In a short while, hualala. The Red Stone Prison collapsed.

“Humph!”

“Your prison is pretty impressive, but it’s not enough to trap me, Long Qing!”

A cold harrumph suddenly exploded in the universe.

Then, they immediately saw a fierce divine power explode in a corner of the void and fly in all directions. The old lady in a black robe who was dealing with Real God Long Qing with her all looked terrified.

At the moment when Real God Long Qing broke Red Stone Prison apart.

“Hurry up and run!”

The old lady in a black robe let out a low roar and her figure instantly retreated.

“Your Highness, let’s hurry up and leave,” the chubby, middle-aged man appeared before His Highness Mu Hong.

“But Jian Wushuang…” His Highness Mu Hong glance at Jian Wushuang. He wanted to kill Jian Wushuang before he left.

“Hurry up and run. Otherwise, we won’t escape in time,” the chubby, middle-aged man immediately grabbed His Highness Mu Hong by his hand. Then, the two of them instantly fled.

Rumble.

A terrifying divine power pressed from all directions and the ruins of the collapsed Red Stone Prison were crushed into pieces. Then, there was a figure that soared up into the sky. It was Real God Long Qing and he was raging with imposing aura.

Looking at the few people fleeing hastily in the void, he wanted to chase but he suddenly noticed Jian Wushuang’s existence.

“Jian Wushuang, you are…” Real God Long Qing looked at Jian Wushuang with his eyebrows tightly knitted.

He could tell that Jian Wushuang was in very bad condition.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power and aura were already weakened to an extreme low and it was constantly weakening still. Jian Wushuang felt that all his strength was vanishing. He sat on the ground with his body slightly shivering. He couldn’t move an inch. But suddenly, Jian Wushuang lifted his head and roared, “Real God Long Qing, don’t bother about me. Hurry, hurry up and chase after them!”

“Remember, you must catch the lady in Ancient Demon Mountain alive. Catch her alive!!!”

Real God Long Qing creased his eyebrows and nodded heavily.

Then, just as Real God Long Qing plunged out and almost stepped foot on Ancient Demon Mountain.

Vroom. A boundless black fog suddenly soared up from Ancient Demon Mountain, just like a black ocean. It instantly swept across heaven and earth and covered the entire universe.

Wow! Wow! Wow!

From the black ocean, an enormous amount of black fog formed into creepy black waves and lapped at Real God Long Qing from all directions.

Although Real God Long Qing was a Chaotic Real God, he seemed to be in a fix from the attack of the creepy black waves.

“What the hell is this?”

Real God Long Qing’s gaze turned cold and he constantly stabbed with his spear as he let out an imposing power to break the black waves. However, the moment it broke, more black waves ravaged over.
