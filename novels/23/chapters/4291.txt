4293 Dragon Slaying (Part One)

The sword light came as fast as lightning. It was not obvious at first, but as it got closer, it instantly covered the sky and ground, tearing the clouds into pieces.

The Blood God’s expression turned cold. Even though he was still a thousand miles away, he could already feel the sharp sword Qi scraping his divine body.

“So powerful.” The Scion thought to himself.

“It’s finally here!”

On the other hand, Qiu Long’s eyes flickered with excitement as he stood up from his throne.

Bang!

The sword light that Jian Wushuang had turned into did not have any intention of stopping and charged straight at Qiu Long!

“Hahaha, good!”

Qiu Long stomped heavily on the void and created two big pits. his body turned into a black light and collided with Jian Wushuang!

Bang!

A loud bang exploded!

At the center of their collision, a massive shockwave spread out, creating white waves in the air.

In the next moment, Qiu Long’s figure was seen flying backward and crashing into a mountain, causing the mountain to collapse.

The sword light gradually dissipated, revealing a thin figure in black.

He was Jian Wushuang, who had conquered 18 cities with one sword!

The stroke had accumulated Jian Wushuang’s endless divine power. It kept on accumulating and only exploded when it hit Qiu Long! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Cough, cough, cough. Jian Wushuang, you’ve broken through to the level of Ultimate Ruler?”

Qiu Long walked out of the mountain and wiped the divine blood from the corner of his mouth. He looked up at Jian Wushuang without any fear on his face. Instead, his eyes were full of excitement.

“Not bad. Thanks to you, I’ve broken through,” Jian Wushuang nodded lightly.

Qiu Long laughed and said, “That’s good too. It’ll only be interesting if I kill you again like this.”

Jian Wushuang ignored him. Instead, he turned to look at Ruler Hao Jin with a pained look in his eyes.

Two chains had pierced through Ruler Hao Jin’s shoulder blades. His face was sallow, and he was extremely weak. His eyes were filled with decay.

However, when he saw Jian Wushuang, his hopeless eyes gradually lit up.

He looked at Jian Wushuang and opened his mouth with difficulty. He forced a smile and said, “Lord, Lord Blood Sword, I knew you would come to save me.”

When Qiu Long saw this, he let out a sinister laugh and said mischievously, “Jian Wushuang, Speaking of which, this guy who followed you is really loyal. For the past ten thousand years, I have crushed his bones again and again. Every day, I have burned his divine soul with divine fire, causing his divine body to collapse and regenerate continuously. In the end, even so, he is still unwilling to rely on me.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s expression gradually turned cold. He turned to look at him and said calmly, “Don’t worry, I will also crush every bone in your body inch by inch, pull out your tendons and strip your bones, and torture you day and night!”

“Hahaha, Jian Wushuang, let’s see if you have the ability to do so! Hahahaha!” Qiu Long laughed arrogantly and countless black chains surged out from behind him, flying toward Jian Wushuang like missiles!

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He had a deep impression of the black chains. Each of them was as heavy as Mount Tai!

Jian Wushuang had been helpless against this move and could only take a beating. But now, the situation was different.

Looking at the thousands of chains that were coming at him, Jian Wushuang said two words.

“Sundering stars.”

Whoosh!

A silver sword rainbow condensed in Jian Wushuang’s hand like thousands of lights in the world. With the power of thousands of troops, it slashed at the thousands of chains!

As Jian Wushuang broke through to the Ultimate Ruler Realm, the star slashing sword also had a world-shaking difference!

The star slashing sword actually formed countless illusionary stars. The silver sword rainbow was more like a magnificent galaxy. When the sword smashed down, it was as if it had absorbed a surging galaxy. The power was terrifying to the extreme.

Ding!

A series of crisp explosions rang out as the powerful black chains were shattered one by one at an extremely fast speed by the silver sword rainbow!

It did not stop there. After the silver sword rainbow cut through the countless black chains, it continued forward. Under the surprised gaze of Qiu Long, the sword slashed his body!

Bang!

Qiu Long smashed down, and a sword mark appeared on his divine body, spurting out black divine blood.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and stomped heavily on the ground with his right foot. Suddenly, like a hurricane, he leaped and appeared above Qiu Long’s head. Before Qiu Long could react, Jian Wushuang stretched out his fingers and grabbed his face. Then, he smashed Qiu Long’s face onto the ground!

“Qiu Long, you deserve to die!”

Bang!

The ground cracked open and Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold. He grabbed Qiu Long’s face and smashed it into the ground continuously. His actions were extremely violent!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Again and again!

Waves of terrifying sword essence exploded in Jian Wushuang’s hands!

Jian Wushuang grabbed Qiu Long’s head and smashed it into the ground of the 18th city, creating a huge pit. Countless cracks spread out from the pit.

“Jian Wushuang, who gave you the right to hurt me?!” A low and ferocious voice came out of Qiu Long’s mouth.

Taking advantage of the gap, Qiu Long stretched out his hand and pushed Jian Wushuang hard!

In an instant, an extremely strong pushing force rushed toward Jian Wushuang. It was as if heaven and earth were rejecting him and pushing Jian Wushuang away!

In the next moment, Qiu Long’s hands were on the ground, and he pulled his head out of the deep pit.

He looked extremely miserable. His face was covered with divine blood. Jian Wushuang’s sword essence kept exploding between his fingers, covering his face with sword marks.

Huchi huchi huchi.

...

Qiu Long panted heavily, but there was no fear on his face. Instead, he licked the divine blood on the corner of his mouth and said with a deep and ferocious smile, “Is this the feeling of being injured? I’m getting more and more excited!”

Bang!

Before he could finish his words, he had already stepped on his right foot and shot out like a cannonball. His right hand formed a fist and once again smashed toward Jian Wushuang!

Pitch-black dragon scales began to cover his arm.

The entire void became distorted because of this punch.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold. He slashed his right hand on the Wuqi Divine Sword and also raised his sword to attack Qiu Long!

The speed of the two was extremely fast, and they exchanged thousands of moves in an instant. They fought from the ground to the nine heavens, and then from the nine heavens to the ground.

Every time the two of them clashed, the void trembled continuously. The 18 cities seemed to have fallen into an apocalyptic disaster. The stars shifted and the divine Lands sank within a radius of a million miles!

“Is this…is this still a battle between Ultimate Rulers?”

When the Scion of the Blood God saw this, a look of shock flashed across his face.

Just by standing at the edge of the battle between Jian Wushuang and Qiu Long, he could feel the violent pressure from the two of them, forcing him to step back.
