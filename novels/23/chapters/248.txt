Chapter 249: Making a Path by Splitting the Mountains and Lakes!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Everybody watched in shock.

It was unbelievable that a lofty mountain was split in half by a single sword stroke!

Then, numerous people looked towards the far end of the path that was just created, where a figure with a longsword on the back suddenly appeared.

“Jian Wushuang! ”

“With a sword in hand, no one is his match!”

“He is the most peerless genius in the history of our Tianzong Dynasty!”

The entire Heartless Island began to see the all at once.

Although some of the participants in the meeting were young warriors, not just mentioning the young warriors, even experts who reached Yin Void or higher were excited.

The young warriors were brought here by their elders to gain experience. Seeing Jian Wushuang, they were extremely excited. After all, Jian Wushuang was a real myth to them.

Numerous young warriors were full of blind fanaticism and worship for Jian Wushuang!

Thinking about it, who else could lead a small dynasty, like the Tianzong Dynasty, to defeat all the other northwest dynasties in the Easternmost Hunt?

Who else could achieve the Peak of the Yin Void Realm before the age of 20? Except, now he had already reached the Yang Void Realm.

Who else could force Blood Feather Tower, an overlord in the Tianzong Dynasty, to set up such an unbelievable trap?

No one!

He was truly the strongest in the history of the Tianzong Dynasty!

“Jian Wushuang! ”

In the corner of the Drill Ground, there was a handsome man who was holding his hands tightly. He was extremely excited, and his eyes were full of fanaticism.

However, seeing the handsome man in such a state, Jian Meng’er, who was standing beside him, felt even worse.

The Gladiator Arena gathered a great number of experts, with Bai Chong among them. He looked out towards Jian Wushuang, with his hand touching the left sleeve that was missing an arm. He smiled and muttered, “It was worth supporting the birth of such a peerless genius, even at the cost of an arm!”

Jian Xinhong stood in the field where the solitary experts gathered. He was already looking at Jian Wushuang as well, with an extremely mixed expression that was excited, pleasantly surprised and satisfied, but most of all, worried.

”?Be sure to survive this fight no matter what!?” Jian Xinhong snarled deep in his heart.

“Third Bro.”

Wang Yuan and Su Rou were hiding somewhere in the surroundings of Heartless Island. After seeing Jian Wushuang, their eyes began to glisten.

Jian Wushuang stole all the spotlight.

Everybody present had fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang, who had appeared at the far end of this path.

Jian Wushuang slightly lifted his head as a surging killing intent began to rush out and fill the area. He looked around and took in everything that was happening on Heartless Island.

Then, he began moving forward.

Dung!

As soon as he stepped forward and placed his foot on the ground, an intangible wave instantly rippled out. At the same time, a light sound was heard. However, that sound quickly became louder and louder.

Dung! Dung! Dung! Dung!

Jian Wushuang walked forward, one step after another, at a fairly slow pace. Every time he took a step, his killing intent grew a little stronger.

Jian Wushuang attracted the attention of all the people on Heartless Island.

Soon, he passed through the path and made his way to the lakeside. But he didn’t stop there. Instead, he directly stepped on the lake without any hesitation.

The instant his foot touched the surface, a rumbling sound was heard and the whole lake instantly became turbulent. It looked like the water was being crazily engulfed by its surroundings. Within a minute, only a huge ravine, with no visible bottom, remained where the lake was previously. It was as if the whole lake had been cut away.

The ravine was several dozen?meters wide, and even though water was surging into the ravine from the lake, it was obvious that this ravine would not be filled in a short amount of time.

Seeing this, the experts on Heartless Island couldn’t help squinting.

At this moment, everybody was reminded of a saying.

“The mountains will split asunder, the rivers will run dry, and the skies will be stained with blood as swords point towards the demon horde.”

Among them, the first two already occurred, so the next step should be staining the sky with blood!

Jian Wushuang didn’t stop after he cut through the lake. He continued walking slowly towards Heartless Island.

At this exact moment, dozens of figures violently glided close from the nearby area.

“Ha-ha, Third Bro, I am here to help you!”

Bubbling laughter reverberated throughout the area as a heavily built fat guy appeared at Jian Wushuang’s side, followed by more than 20 purple-robed figures that landed behind the fat man in succession. All of them radiated a monstrous aura.

Among the purple-robed figures, more than 10 were experts in the Yang Void Realm, while the rest were at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

In the Tianzong Dynasty, this battle formation could only be called horrifying!

“Are they from the Alchemy School?”

Qi Luosheng was standing on a raised platform on the Heartless Island. After watching Wang Yuan and his comrades’ appear, he slightly squinted his eyes, then he smirked and said, “The Alchemy School and Holy Emperor Palace restrain each other, so it’s impossible for them to bring in their top experts. They are just some ordinary experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. What can they do?”

However, as soon as Qi Luosheng uttered these words, 10 more figures glided close and landed behind Jian Wushuang.

“Third Bro,” Su Rou lightly said to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Ice Nether Valley?” Seeing this, Qi Luosheng felt a little bit shocked, but it was still not enough to make him feel fear.

“Jian Wushuang, we are here to support you!”

A deep roar suddenly reverberated throughout the area, followed by six people gliding close to Jian Wushuang.

It was a group led by a white-robed lady. After she appeared, the entire Heartless Island began seething.

“Palace Master White?”

“Palace Master White from Dragon Palace?”

“Palace Master White came in person, does Dragon Palace intend to get involved?”

The people present were all top experts from various sects, so one glance was enough for them to recognize Palace Master White.

“Bai Ling.” Qi Luosheng’s face instantly darkened and he asked, “Does Dragon Palace want to join this fight?”

“Ha-ha.” Palace Master Black, who had arrived a long time ago, responded to Qi Luosheng with a light smile. “Tower Master Qi, you misunderstood. Bai Ling and the four previous Temple Masters of Dragon Palace announced their resignation yesterday. Now they are just Golden Dragon Ambassadors of Golden-dragon Palace. They have little relationship with our Dragon Palace.”

“Oh?” Qi Luosheng frowned.

At this point, many experts had an odd look on their faces.

Palace Master White resigned from Dragon Palace? Unbelievable!

“It seems like everyone is here. The young master of the Alchemy School, people from Ice Nether Valley, and Bai Ling from Dragon Palace. Whatever, you guys saved me the time of looking for you later,” Qi Luosheng said with a cold look in his eyes.

By now, Palace Master White and her comrades had already moved behind Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Palace Master White gave Jian Wushuang a deep glance. She was followed by the four previous Temple Masters from Dragon Palace and Jian Wushuang’s good friend, Ye Rufeng.

Jian Wushuang had not said a word since he appeared. He just stared at the Heartless Island in front of him and kept walking ahead without a pause on his steps. At the same time, the killing intent continued to surge out of his body, growing stronger and stronger. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang passed through the lake and stepped onto Heartless Island, slowly walking towards the Drill Ground center. Finally, he appeared in front of Qi Luosheng and the experts of Blood Feather Tower.

At this point, Jian Wushuang stopped walking, then lifted his head and slowly scanned the crowd with a cold look in his eyes.

“When I was chased by Blood Feather Tower and forced to jump into the Abyss three years ago, I said...The day I return is the day all you demons die!”

“And today is the day Blood Feather Tower is destroyed!”
