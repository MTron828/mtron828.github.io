Chapter 1523: Real God Level!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Halfway up a mountain, inside a provisional cave which had been opened up.

Jian Wushuang was sitting down alone with his legs crossed. On the surface, he looked impervious to desires and passions. However, within the sea of consciousness, his Soul Fire was burning furiously.

The soul and consciousness were different from a cultivator’s realm.

A cultivator could be in the realm of a Universe God. However, his consciousness could have reached the level of a Real God’s.

As for Jian Wushuang just then, his Force of Soul was trying to break past the bottleneck to the Real God’s level.

During his early days in the Sky Sword Prison, his Force of Soul had reached the limit of a Universe God’s. After honing it for another thousand years, his soul had achieved the critical stage of making a breakthrough. However, he lacked an opportunity to make a breakthrough. However, a few days ago, during the match between Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying…

The strongest attack, Nine Weight Destruction, that Xin Zhu had used, had given his soul an impact that he had never felt before.

This impact had caused his Soul Fire to almost fall apart. However, it was such an instant of life and death that gave rise to an opportunity for him to make a breakthrough.

After that fight subsided, he immediately started to meditate in seclusion in the provisional cave that had opened up.

After a few days, he reached the critical moment.

“Whether I fail or succeed will depend on this moment!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with a brilliant light. The Soul Fire in his sea of consciousness was also burning furiously and the Soul Power that had accumulated to the limit a long time ago started to try to go past its limit.

Boom!

With a fierce impact, the bottleneck was destroyed. With that, the Soul Fire in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness started to increase madly at once.

“I have made a breakthrough!”

Jian Wushuang was extremely delighted. The flowing Soul Power in his sea of consciousness also started to rise at an amazing speed.

In no time, his transformation ended.

“Force of Soul, Real God level!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

It was not just the Force of Soul that had risen. It should be known that Jian Wushuang had always been proficient in soul attacks.

When he had used his soul attacks previously, his consciousness had not achieved the level of a Real God’s. However, almost no one could block them.

At that very moment, his Force of Soul had achieved the level of a Real God’s. If he were to unleash soul attacks again…

“Let’s try it.”

Jian Wushuang laughed nonchalantly and his Soul Power surged at once.

Roar!

A furious roar that seemed to appear from an Abysmal Hell could be heard. A black and big Demonic Dragon, which released shocking murderous aura, appeared fiercely. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This Demonic Dragon was very powerful. When its body flew past the void, it ripped open the void easily.

“This power…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed brilliantly, “Haha. That Xin Zhu can use his consciousness to create headless soldiers which have the fighting capabilities of Real Gods. However, the power of the Demonic Dragon that I can create using my Soul Power now is also similar to that of a Real God!”

“As for the soul attacks, I have the Eighteen Asura Hell and Secret Skill of Tian Yuan. In particular, if I use the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan with my full power, the soul attack would definitely not be weaker than Xin Zhu’s Nine Weight Destruction. It might even be slightly stronger.”

Jian Wushuang was over the moon.

Among the Universe Gods, Xin Zhu was recognized by the Eternal Chaotic World as the Universe God with the strongest consciousness attacks.

However, at that very moment, Jian Wushuang believed that his own soul attacks were not weaker than Xin Zhu’s. In fact, they might even be stronger.

Moreover, among his soul attacks, if he were to use the Divine Ape from the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack, he could combine his Soul Power with his Divine Power beautifully.

Real God-level Soul Power combined with his Divine Power. Jian Wushuang’s abilities had definitely increased greatly compared to the past.

“If I were to fight against Xin Zhu and Universe God Liu Ying again, I would definitely not be in a difficult situation. Moreover, I might even be able to break both of them one by one!” Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically.

…

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were sitting by a stone table and drinking wine.

“Duan Lingfeng, what is the power of this black armor?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“Not bad. With this armor, my abilities have risen considerably compared to the past. Especially in the aspect of my Divine Power,” Duan Lingfeng said.

The black armor that Duan Lingfeng had obtained was a Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasure and it was similar to Jian Wushuang’s Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor. It also contained a secret skill which could allow one’s Divine Power to rise.

“Previously, you were able to push back Zi Dongwang even without this piece of armor. But now… I am curious as to whether you have the right to compete with the God Destroying King who is ranked first in the Universe God ranking list,” Jian Wushuang jeered.

“No idea,” Duan Lingfeng shook his head, “I have heard that there is a huge gap between the first and second of the Universe God ranking list. However, I have never come across the God Destroying King. If I don’t fight with him personally, I will be unable to judge.”

“That’s true,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently and he lifted his wine cup up.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang frowned abruptly. He had already sensed the three shadows which were within the range of his Soul Power.

“Duan Lingfeng, our old friend is here,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“Old friend? Zi Dongwang?” Duan Lingfeng shot a glance toward Jian Wushuang. He then had a dull expression.

Duan Lingfeng could no longer feel interested in Zi Dongwang just then.

“It’s him. However, he has brought us a big surprise this time round,” Jian Wushuang chuckled. His Soul Power had already locked on to one person.

That was a pale-looking young man who looked fragile.

However, it was this young man that had given Jian Wushuang a great amount of pressure.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng plunged out from the cave immediately. They then appeared in the void on the upper end.

In front of them, three shadows descended.

Among the three shadows, there was Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu, who Jian Wushuang was familiar with.

There was also that fragile young man… God Destroying King!

“Both of us were still talking about the God Destroying King just now. However, who would expect him to appear in front of us straight away,” Jian Wushuang had an indifferent expression and he?glanced at Duan Lingfeng, “Looks like you have an opportunity to fight him.”

“Yes,” Duan Lingfeng nodded his head and his eyes shone brilliantly like never before.

He had come to Wu Bei’s cave in order to fight against experts.

At the beginning, he had defeated Demon Girl Ling Luo, who was ranked third in the Universe God ranking list. Previously, he had also fought with Zi Dongwang and managed to push him back.

At that very moment, he had obtained a Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasure and his abilities rose again. Hence, what he yearned for at the moment was to fight with the God Destroying King, the Universe God who had been recognized as the number one among Universe Gods!

Duan Lingfeng was filled with fighting intention.

Jian Wushuang was the same as well.

“My Force of Soul has just made a breakthrough and my abilities have increased greatly. Thus, I am just about to find someone to test out my abilities. Just then, the three of you came. What a coincidence,” Jian Wushuang stuck his tongue out and licked his lips. His eyes were also unusually cold.

On the battlefield, swords were drawn and the battle was about to begin!
