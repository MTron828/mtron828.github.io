Chapter 3139: Dark Dragon Spike

——

“Peak of rank six!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused.

He could easily crush Long Lu, who was only at the initial stage of rank six, with his powerful divine power and the help of the peerless sword technique.

However, the peerless sword technique alone was not enough to defeat a True Saint at the peak of rank six.

“Condense!”

Jian Wushuang spat out a word.

In an instant, streams of demonic purple light rose up.

These demonic purple lights were actually purple sharp swords. Under Jian Wushuang’s control, a total of 18 purple sharp swords were instantly assembled together.

Buzz…a terrifying reincarnation wave slowly spread out from the void.

A black divine sword that looked like an awl condensed into form.

The black divine sword emitted a dazzling dark light, which was intoxicating. The surface of the dark light was faintly surrounded by layers of black air currents, it was as if a giant dragon was circling around the dark light.

The eighth level of the reincarnation sword formation…Dark Dragon Spike!

Ninety years ago, after coming out of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the reincarnation principles had already reached a very high level. It had already surpassed his comprehension of space-time principles, at that time, he was able to display the ultimate power of the seventh level of the Samsara sword formation, one emotion thread.

During these ninety years, Jian Wushuang had made rapid progress in the space-time principles with the help of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual.

However, in the Samsara principles, he also had the nine serenities Samsara strategy, which had also carried out a detailed analysis of the Samsara principles. His comprehension of the Samsara principles had also made great progress.

Now, he could perform the eighth level of the reincarnation sword formation.

Jian Wushuang had already determined that the power of the eighth level of the reincarnation sword formation should not be weaker than a peak level six secret skill!

“With the same divine power, let’s see if your ax skill is better or my reincarnation sword formation is better.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a fierce light.

The dark light that was like a dragon instantly turned into lightning and shot out.

The short elder appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and slashed down with the giant ax in his hand.

The moment he slashed down, countless lightning bolts appeared.

In an instant, the giant ax collided with the dark light.

Clang!

With a loud sound, the void suddenly shook.

The short elder’s face darkened and his body became unstable. He took three steps back, and each step almost caused the void under his feet to explode.

As for the dim light surrounding the dragon, it was immediately sent flying by the ax.

However, it was only sent flying, and it did not cause the sword array to collapse.

From the scene before him, it was clear that this clash was evenly matched.

“This kid…” The short elder’s face was ashen.

The spectators were all shocked.

“Evenly matched?”

“He is a rank four Peak True Saint, but he is evenly matched with a rank six Peak True Saint?”

“How is this possible?”

“The gap between the True Saint Realm is getting bigger and bigger. Even the super-geniuses of the three palaces and Dao Palace can’t challenge a rank six Peak True Saint at the level of a rank four Peak True Saint, right?”

Everyone was shocked.

Jian Wushuang stared at the short elder with a cold face. “It’s just as I expected. The eighth level of the Samsara Sword Formation is as powerful as the pinnacle of rank six. In my current state, I can fight against a True Saint at the peak of rank six. Even if I have to face him head-on, I won’t be afraid!”

“Again!”

With a shout, Jian Wushuang controlled the dark light and continued to shoot toward the short elder.

“Why should I be afraid of you?”

The short elder’s eyes were filled with raging anger. A large number of purple thunderbolts were rolling on his body, and his strength reached its peak at this moment.

In the void, the two collided again.

To be exact, the short elder’s big ax collided with the reincarnation sword formation controlled by Jian Wushuang.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Only to hear a low sound of metal constantly ringing throughout the void.

Every time the sound is heard, there is an invisible shock wave, wantonly swept out in all directions.

And in this collision, it is clear that the two sides have been evenly matched.

In a void around, the Purple Cloud Pavilion that a few strong standing together, see the scene in front, these people are not good-looking.

“This kid’s battle strength is so strong that even Deacon Qi can’t do anything to him,” Long Lu said.

“In terms of strength, Deacon Qi is already the strongest among us. If even he can’t do anything to this kid, we naturally can’t,” a True Saint at the peak of rank six said.

Jian Wushuang’s strength was indeed beyond their expectations.

They had never thought that a True Saint at the peak of rank four could reach such a level of battle strength.

“What are you waiting for? Hurry up and kill that kid!”

A low shout suddenly came from another battlefield.

Long Lu and the others were stunned and immediately looked at the source of the voice.

It was naturally the heart witch who had fought Dao Dragon from the beginning.

It was a fact that the heart shaman was very difficult to deal with.

Although he was not a rank seven Peak True Saint, many rank seven Peak True Saints were not willing to fight him.

However, Dao Dragon was not one of those rank seven Peak True Saints.

Dao Dragon was a super expert who dared to clash head-on with the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Even an Invincible Immortal Saint would not be able to do anything to him. His battle prowess far surpassed that of a normal rank seven Peak True Saint.

Therefore, the battle between the mind witch and Dao Dragon began with the mind witch being at an absolute disadvantage.

Now, the mind witch was in an extremely difficult situation. However, he was also trying his best to hold on. He wanted to buy time for these rank six True Saints so that they could kill Jian Wushuang.

But who would have thought that these rank six True Saints would be so slow to kill Jian Wushuang.

Of course, the heart witch was angry and anxious.

Seeing the situation of the heart witch, the rank six True Saints of Purple Cloud Pavilion narrowed their eyes. They looked at each other and made a decision immediately.

“Let’s kill him together!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The three rank six Peak True Saints, together with Long Lu, the initial rank six True Saint, moved at this moment.

Together with Deacon Qi, who had been fighting with Jian Wushuang, there were five rank six True Saints attacking at the same time.

This scene made the experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance who were watching the fight cry out in surprise.

“Wow, the rank six True Saints of the Purple Cloud Pavilion all attacked!”

“Now, Heavenly Sword Marquis is in danger.”

“Humph, a rank six Peak True Saint is going against a rank four True Saint. How dare they bully him with numbers?”

Many experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were secretly disdainful.

However, it was a fact that the rank six True Saints of the Purple Cloud Pavilion had all attacked. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
