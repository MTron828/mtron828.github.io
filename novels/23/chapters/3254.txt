Chapter 3257: Return the Favor

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

____________

To be able to kill the Invincible Saint on his own, although the Invincible Saint was not in his peak state, it was still very impressive.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had killed an Invincible Saint, Blue Eagle, but it was not seen by outsiders and did not spread out.

All in all, he was much more terrifying than an ordinary expert on the True Saint List.

“With my life-saving ability and assassination ability, I’m now really famous in the Divine Beginning Realm.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

At this moment...

“Jian Wushuang!” A message suddenly came.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In this life, except for the first time when he was born in the Sorceror God Realm, he used an alias. Especially after reaching the Third Heaven, almost no one knew his real name.

But now, the message was addressed to him by his real name.

“So it’s Miss Xiao’er. Long time no see. I wonder how my family is doing at your place?” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

Miss Xiao’er...was Jian Wushuang’s most mysterious woman in this life. She was also a reincarnated person with a mysterious identity. Jian Wushuang did not know her real origin, however, he learned from Xuan Shen Daoist that Miss Xiao’er was not his friend or enemy, so they had formed an alliance before.

Later, when the people from the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley wanted to take his wife, Leng Rushuang, away, Jian Wushuang used his life-level power and Heaven-cleaving skill at all costs, which alerted the power of the will of heaven, even the experts from the three Saint Realms came in person.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to ask his ally to help. Miss Xiao’er did have the means to move all his family members in this life in the shortest time possible, including his parents in this life, he also had a sister and a brother.

Over the years, Jian Wushuang would occasionally ask Miss Xiao’er about the situation of his relatives, but this was the first time Miss Xiao’er took the initiative to look for him.

“Don’t worry. Your relatives are doing very well, and I have used resources to force your parents to reach the level of Immortal Saint. As for your brothers and sisters, they are more competitive and want to rely on their own strength to grow, but their talent is limited and their growth is not satisfactory, but in general, there is no problem,” Xiao’er said.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “May I know why Miss Xiao’er is looking for me?”

“Jian Wushuang, I have just received news that there is a man named Heavenly Sword Marquis in the Blood Wave Realm. He is very skilled. His life-saving ability and assassination ability are ranked first among the Immortal Saints. This person should be you, right?” Xiao’er asked.

“It’s me.” Jian Wushuang did not deny it.

He had fought several times in the Blood Wave Realm, and someone had recorded his battle with a mirror image. He did not deliberately disguise his appearance, so Xiao’er could naturally recognize him at a glance.

“When I met you before, you were not even in the Heavenly Demon Realm. Now, in less than a thousand years, you have already made a name for yourself in the Divine Beginning Realm. It seems that I did not misjudge you when I chose to form an alliance with you,” Xiao’er said.

“Miss Xiao’er, you didn’t come here to tell me this, did you?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“Of course not,” Xiao’er said, “I came to find you because of someone...the Nine Temples Saintess!”

“It’s really her. It seems that Miss Xiao’er must have had a good relationship with the Nine Temples Saintess.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently, not surprised at all.

He had met the Nine Temples Saintess before, and she had used the charm on him.

Xiao’er had used that special charm on him before. Jian Wushuang felt it was very familiar at that time, and he had guessed that there might be a special relationship between the Nine Temples Saintess and the mysterious Miss Xiao’er.

“I did have some relationship with her before, and I’m looking for you this time to ask you to help me kill the Nine Temples Saintess in the Blood Wave Realm,” Xiao’er said seriously.

“Kill her?” Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised, but then he shook his head. “Miss Xiao’er, don’t you think too highly of me?

“Yes, my assassination skills are the best among the Immortal Saints, but no matter how good my assassination skills are, I can barely kill an ordinary Invincible Saint. But the Nine Temples Saintess is one of the top five experts on the True Saint List, and she was ranked third before!”

“It’s impossible for me to kill Nine Temples Saintess with my assassination ability!”

Jian Wushuang was telling the truth.

His assassination ability could threaten an ordinary Invincible Saint, but it definitely could not threaten an expert ranked in the top five on the True Saint List like Nine Temples Saintess.

Even if he used his strongest trump card, the Heaven-cleaving skill, he was not confident that he could kill Nine Temples Saintess.

“Can’t do it?” Xiao’er was silent for a moment and then said, “Well, since you are not sure that you can kill her, then forget it. But if you can, I want you to try to stop her from getting the opportunity in the Blood Wave Realm. Is that okay?”

“Just stop her. If she doesn’t get the Blood Wave Token, I can give it a try,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, if you don’t let her get the opportunity in the Blood Wave Realm, then you can pay me back for saving your family, how about that?” Xiao’er said.

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Well, I’ll wait for your good news.” Xiao’er said and then cut off the communication.

On the hill, Jian Wushuang put the communication token into his interspatial ring and then exhaled heavily.

“I had guessed that the Nine Temples Saintess was related to Miss Xiao’er, but I didn’t expect them to be enemies. I didn’t expect Miss Xiao’er to come to me and ask me to kill her for her.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

The Nine Temples Saintess had helped the three Saint Realms to kill him, which was already a grudge between them.

But now, the mysterious Miss Xiao’er asked him to find a way to kill the Nine Temples Saintess or prevent her from getting the opportunity in the Blood Wave Realm...

“Nine Temples Saintess, it’s not that I’m calculative, but right now, I do have a reason to attack you,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He owed Miss Xiao’er a favor, and he owed her more than one.

Since it was a favor, of course, he had to pay it back.
