Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Lineage of Star would charge to Deluge Fortress within ten years. The news spread like wildfire.

Eternal Chaotic World was instantly bubbling over with enthusiasm.

After Jian Wushuang left Thunderbolt Island, his face was cold.

At first, he thought the earlier massacre had already killed many experts who harbored grudges against Lineage of Star but he had never expected that there would be so many left.

A total of thirteen Almighties combined was not a weak team formation.

But Jian Wushuang had to kill all of them.

“Palace Master,” Hall Master Yuan sent a message. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hall Master Yuan, you have received the news, right?” Jian Wushuang assumed.

“Yes, I have,” Hall Master Yuan replied, “Palace Master made the right decision. If it was during normal times, it’d be okay for Lineage of Star to take a step back when Fortress Master Hong Tian and the others united and were willing to take a step back. But now… Lineage of Star is caught between life and death. The abyss is right behind us and we can’t even take a step back. Fortress Master Hong Tian and the rest have to be exterminated before the danger explodes. Otherwise, they will become a sharp blade that is pointed at the heart of Lineage of Star.”

“It seems like you agree with my course of action,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Of course I do. It’s just that they are a group of thirteen Almighties. It won’t be easy to kill all of them,” Hall Master Yuan sighed.

“Don’t worry. As I said, I will head to Deluge Fortress within ten years, I naturally am confident in killing them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Mm,” Hall Master Yuan nodded too. “Yeah, Palace Master, do you want Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun to come over and help you?”

“It’s okay. Let them continue to chase after Real Gods who hold grudges against Lineage of Star. I’ll take care of things here,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I understand,” Hall Master Yuan didn’t ask further.

An ancient spaceship continued to travel forward at a high speed in the dark void. Half a year later, he arrived at a piece of floating land.

The land wasn’t huge in size but there were mountains and rivers. It was a painting-like scenery.

Jian Wushuang had just landed on the land when there were immediately two flowing lights that flew over.

“Who is this?”

The two flowing lights were two silver-armored soldiers. They were looking at Jian Wushuang with their guards up.

Although they were only soldiers, their auras were already at the level of Real God.

“Please notify your betters that Sword Emperor from Lineage of Star has come to visit,” Jian Wushuang smiled as he let out his divine might.

Feeling Jian Wushuang’s divine might, the two soldiers immediately realized that the visitor was an Almighty. They didn’t dare to delay and immediately reported.

In the middle of the land, there was an ancient palace. In the palace, there was a golden-robed lady that sat on a cattail hassock. The golden-robed lady had a lightning mark in-between her eyebrows.

Suddenly, a maidservant came in and bowed politely.

The golden-robed lady fluttered her eyelids and opened her eyes.

“What is it?” The golden-robed lady’s voice was cold.

“Master, there’s a visitor. He said that he is Sword Emperor from Lineage of Star. He said that he has come to visit you,” the maidservant said politely.

“Sword Emperor from Lineage of Star?” The golden-robed lady looked shocked, “I do not have anything to do with Lineage of Star. Not too long ago, Jian Wushuang said that he wanted to barge into Deluge Fortress in ten years time, why did he come to look for me now?”

Although the golden-robed lady was confused, she waved and said, “Let him in.”

“Yes,” the maidservant left.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang came to the palace under the lead of the maidservant.

“Jian Wushuang greets Emperor God Liu Guang,” Jian Wushuang was polite but he wasn’t fearful.

Emperor God Liu Guang was a peak expert in the twenty-seventh place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. In terms of power, she was one notch stronger than the Master of Star Palace. She was definitely considered a terrifying existence.

However, Jian Wushuang also possessed fighting power of a Peak Emperor God. Hence, they were not far apart in power, they naturally could speak on even ground.

“I wonder why the famous Sword Emperor has come to my place?” Emperor God Liu Guang stared at Jian Wushuang with her pair of eyes that were giving out faint golden light. It was as though she was trying to see through Jian Wushuang but she couldn’t see anything.

“I think Emperor God Liu Guang also knew that Lineage of Star would barge into Deluge Emperor within ten years, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor God Liu Guang.

“Yes,” Emperor God Liu Guang nodded. She wasn’t cultivating in seclusion so she pretty much knew what had happened within Eternal Chaotic World, especially about that incident. It had been a great scene and it would be difficult for Emperor God Liu Guang to not know about it.

“If so, I will not beat around the bush. Deluge Fortress has a total of thirteen Almighties. To kill all thirteen Almighties is easier said than done. So, I’d like to ask Emperor God Liu Guang for help,” Jian Wushuang said straightforwardly.

“You want me to help you?” Emperor God Liu Guang looked cold, “Jian Wushuang, no matter if it is you or Lineage of Star behind you, we share no relations. Plus, Fortress Master Hong Tian and the others have never offended me before. Under such circumstances, why would I want to help you?”

“Because of this,” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and there was a strange-looking jade sword.

Emperor God Liu Guang, who looked originally cold, her eyes dilated in shock when she saw the jade sword. There was also a glimpse of light in her eyes but she instantly concealed it.

“Jian Wushuang, where did you get this jade sword?” Emperor God Liu Guang looked at him.

“Regardless of where I got this from, this jade sword is in my hands and Emperor God Liu Guang has been wanting to get this jade sword,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The jade sword had been given to Jian Wushuang many years ago when he took He Xiu in as his disciple and He Xiu gave it to him, along with the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.

The jade sword and Taiqing Ancient Panaceas were from Sir God Dan Hong’s cave dwelling who had passed away long ago.

Back then, Jian Wushuang didn’t know what the purpose of the jade sword was, but when he returned to Lineage of Star and asked Hall Master Yuan, he had found out that the jade sword was a token to enter the third most famous dangerous place in the Third Lair, Blood Cloud Palace!

There was a total of ten tokens to enter Blood Cloud Palace, which were ten jade swords. Only one with a jade sword could enter Blood Cloud Palace.

It was a pity that it still required a long time until Blood Cloud Palace open again. Hence, there wasn’t any use of the jade sword in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

However, Jian Wushuang knew that Emperor God Liu Guang had been looking for the jade sword over the years.

“Emperor God Liu Guang, I heard that the last time when Blood Cloud Palace was open, your husband went in to explore with one of the jade swords, but in the end, he never came out. For all these years, you have been looking for a new jade sword. You should be thinking of entering Blood Cloud Palace the next time it opens again, to look for your husband. It’s a pity that you have yet to find one,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.
