Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

You Ming Pub was still busy and crowded. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang sat in the corner of the pub and drank on his own. No one dared to disturb him.

Just then, the maiden dressed in the green at the counter shouted, “Everyone, I just received the latest update. You might be interested.”

The pub was suddenly noisy and everyone went to the counter to pay one hundred thousand God Gems in exchange for the update.

As for Jian Wushuang, he didn’t move but the maiden in green took the initiative to pass him the message without taking a single cent.

Jian Wushuang browsed through the update carefully.

“He has disguised himself with a sneaky look and concealed his power. He hid his weapon and hid in a thief lair. As there was an internal fight, he displayed his true power and killed over ten Universe Gods with one stroke, including five Universe Gods in the Third Heaven,” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

According to the information, he was eighty to ninety percent certain that it was He Xiu.

“Xue He… His name had the word ‘Xue’ as well. Plus, he used a sword and he is powerful. There were three Real Gods among the thieves but he escaped.”

Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t hesitate and plunged in the direction of Xue He.

Then, as the news spread in You Ming Mountain, countless experts in You Ming Mountain immediately departed too.

…

You Ming Mountain, in the sunny void.

Swoosh!

A flowing light pierced at a shocking speed while it was followed by densely dotted rainbow lights that were swift in speed too.

“He Xiu, you can’t run away!”

“Give us Taiqing Ancient Panacea. Otherwise, you have to die!”

There was a roar followed by another and the sound shook the earth.

Besides the people chasing behind, there were a large number of experts besieging He Xiu from all directions.

Among the experts, there were Real Gods, even Eternal Real Gods and Chaotic Real Gods.

He was only a Universe God. Under such circumstances, it could be said that he was inescapable!

“My divine power is almost exhausted. I can’t escape!”

He Xiu’s face was pale and he felt helpless.

It wasn’t that he had never thought of consuming Taiqing Ancient Panacea. It could let his divine power recover quickly. However, looking at the situation before his eyes, there wasn’t any use if he were to recover his divine power.

“As I can’t escape, let’s bet!” There was an unprecedented madness in He Xiu’s eyes.

Swoosh!

He who was originally running away, suddenly stopped in the air.

“Haha, you’re going to stop running away?”

“Offer no resistance!”

The experts hemming him in from all directions had fire churning in their eyes.

The nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas, whoever got them would receive a bounty reward from Sir God Liu Yin.

He was an Almighty!

Any random reward that was given by an Almighty was enough for Real Gods that had no background to go crazy.

Just as the experts were getting closer to He Xiu to kill him and take away the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.

“Don’t come any closer. Otherwise… I will break them all into pieces. None of you will get them.”

A low bellow was heard from He Xiu. He extended his hand and gripped a green jade bottle tightly in his hand. He squeezed and the jade bottle, made of an unknown material, suddenly cracked a little.

The sight made the surrounding experts’ faces change and all of them stopped.

There were many experts among them. There were even a few Chaotic Real God. They really could kill He Xiu easily. However, if He Xiu were to break the jade bottle into pieces before he died and shatter all the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas in it, their efforts would all go to waste.

Not only would their efforts go to waste, but Sir God Liu Yin would also be pissed too, right?

“He Xiu, why are you still struggling now?”

There was a sudden cold humph that spread across heaven and earth. Everyone looked at the source and they saw six figures gathered there.

Among the six of them, there were two Chaotic Real Gods and the other four were the top Eternal Real Gods. The leader was recognized in the first instant.

“It’s Di Lei!”

“It’s him?”

The surrounding experts looked on in concern.

Di Lei was not only famous in Holy Kingdom of Real God, but he was also famous in the sixteen Holy Kingdoms and he was very powerful. On top of that, he wasn’t alone but there were many experts behind him.

“Haha, even a beast would know what is called a desperate fight, let alone humans. Although I, He Xiu, am only a Universe God, if I could be chased after by so many experts from the surrounding sixteen Holy Kingdoms, I didn’t live in vain.” He Xiu laughed. There was madness in his laughter, “However, even if I die, I will not let you gain a petty advantage.”

“Don’t all you want the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas? I will not give to you! I can be burnt to death with the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.”

Everyone’s faces grew grave when they heard what He Xiu said.

Suddenly…

“Go away!”

He Xiu suddenly roared and he clenched his right hand. The jade bottle that was in it cracked.

Vroom!

A ghostly figure substantiated about a hundred meters away from He Xiu. The ghostly figure was a cold-looking woman.

“Young man, you are only a Universe God, but you’re quite quick to respond, huh?” The woman glanced at He Xiu with a tinge of discontent.

She was good at assassination. She had originally intended to get closer to He Xiu, kill him and take away the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas, but she had never expected He Xiu to notice her.

“You want to assassinate me?” He Xiu’s gaze grew cold. He looked around with soaring murderous intention, “I’ll give you a choice now. Either kill this person who tried to surprise attack me or I will squash the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas!”

“What?” The cold-looking woman who surprise-attacked He Xiu was shocked. He noticed the surrounding murderous gazes fixed upon her.

“For Taiqing Ancient Panacea, you have to die,” Di Lei turned into lightning and struck.

“Run!” The cold looking woman realized that she had become the public target and she couldn’t be bothered with the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas. She instantly started running away.

However, not long after she started running, a huge hand descended from the sky.

The huge hand covered the cold-looking woman and pinched the cold-looking woman like she was an ant. The huge hand exerted strength and crushed her into pieces before everyone, including He Xiu.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

A large crowd plunged over. Their leader was a white-robed man. The white-robed man gave out gentle aura and made one feel as though they were showering in sunlight.

The one who launched an attack at the cold-looking woman was this person.
