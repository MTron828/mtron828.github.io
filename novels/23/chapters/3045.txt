Chapter 3046: Bodhi World

——

“Another universe battlefield?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was strange. “Senior, what is this universe battlefield?”

“The universe battlefield…I don’t know exactly what it is or where it came from, but I know that there are countless opportunities. As long as you have the strength and good luck, you can get unexpected things from it,” Xue Bei said, his expression was obviously a little excited.

But soon, he became serious. “Little guy, your strength is still weak, but you can pass my test, and you have a big secret on you. The space for you to grow in the future will be huge. In the future, as long as you grow carefully, it shouldn’t be difficult to become a top-tier warrior. And if one day you can breakthrough to become a Principles Master, when your strength reaches or surpasses mine, you can break this restriction and get the star map hidden in the token.”

“Through the star map, you can go to the universe battlefield and find the special space-time that I found. I have a feeling that there is a great opportunity hidden in that special space-time. I didn’t have the strength and courage to go there, but you did!

“If your strength is limited in the future and you can’t break through to become a Principles Master, you can give this token and the interspatial ring that I gave you to the blood ancestor, the leader of the blood ancestor’s bloodline.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and then carefully put the token into the interspatial ring.

He understood that the star map hidden in the token was related to a great opportunity in the universe battlefield, and its value was immeasurable.

Xue Bei gave the star map to him in the hope that when he grew to a certain level, he would go to the space-time where the star map was located and find the opportunities inside.

Three of the four opportunities had been given to him, and there was only one left.

“Little guy, the last opportunity I left you is a good fortune,” Xue Bei said directly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Good fortune?

Three opportunities. The first opportunity was three priceless treasures.

The second opportunity was the incredible Emperor’s Order skill.

The third opportunity was related to a star map of a great opportunity in the universe battlefield.

The fourth opportunity was finally a good fortune.

“This good fortune also comes from the universe battlefield.” Xue Bei smiled. Then he flipped his hand and took out a stone.

Yes, it was an ordinary-looking stone.

At first glance, the stone seemed to have been picked up on the ground.

However, Jian Wushuang’s perception was extremely sharp. When he carefully examined the stone with his soul power, his pupils secretly shrank.

“Life!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled.

He actually felt a vigorous vitality from the ordinary stone in front of him.

It seemed that this stone was a complete life.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang looked at Xue Bei curiously.

Xue Bei smiled and said, “I just told you that I found that special space-time when I was adventuring in the universe battlefield. Although I only stayed in that special space-time for a short while, I also obtained a treasure, which is the stone in my hand.”

“A flower, a tree, and a bodhi. This seemingly ordinary stone contains a complete Bodhi World.”

“A Bodhi World?” Jian wushuang was stunned. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It’s okay if you don’t understand. When you’re ready, I’ll let you enter the Bodhi World. You can stay there for a full 100 years. In 100 years, the Bodhi World will directly collapse, and the stone in my hand will also shatter. You will also come out of the Bodhi World. As for how much you can gain in these 100 years, it’s up to you,” Xue Bei said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Although he did not know what kind of fortune was contained in the Bodhi World, the stone alone gave him an extraordinary feeling.

Moreover, since Xue Bei treated this as his last opportunity, it was certainly not bad.

“Little guy, you can prepare yourself first,” Xue Bei said.

“There’s no need to prepare. I’m already at the peak of my condition,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, let’s go in.” Xue Bei clenched his hand, and the stone in his hand immediately burst out with a dazzling light. The dazzling light shone on Jian Wushuang, and his body began to shrink involuntarily, then he slowly floated up like a piece of paper and finally completely disappeared into the stone.

…

Inside the stone, in the Bodhi World.

When Jian Wushuang appeared, he found that he had arrived at an otherworldly paradise.

Here, the birds sang and the flowers were fragrant, and the land was full of vitality.

There were lush trees, all kinds of flowers all over the mountains and plains, and much green grass under the ground.

It was a scene of prosperity.

In the middle of the land, there was a cottage. The cottage was small but exquisite. In front of the cottage, there was a clear river, and in the middle of the river, there was a wooden bridge.

At first glance, it looked like a secluded place for an unworldly expert.

“Is this the Bodhi World?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. “Is there anything different about this world except that it’s full of vitality?”

With a heart full of doubts, Jian Wushuang began to carefully explore the surroundings.

At first, Jian Wushuang did not find anything different. He even searched the entire world, but he did not see anything different.

However, when his consciousness simply swept past the woodpecker on a big tree, his expression suddenly changed.

“That bird…” Jian Wushuang stared at the bird, or to be exact, every feather on the woodpecker’s body.

He first focused on one of the feathers, and in an instant…boom!

He saw a person holding a sword and waving it.

Yes, it was just a feather of a woodpecker, but he saw a man waving his sword.

Moreover, the sword was light and casual. It looked ordinary, but there was an indescribable desolation in it.

Jian Wushuang was stunned by the sword. He was completely stunned.

Because he could not understand that sword. He could not see through it!

He could not even see the slightest bit of profoundness or sword principle, let alone understand it.

But he could clearly sense that the sword move was many times more profound than the violent elephant and star dream moves that he had created!

It was a complete difference between heaven and earth.

The reason why he could not sense any profoundness or sword principle was that the sword move was too high-level!

“It’s obviously a bird’s feather, but in the blink of an eye, it has evolved into a sword skill that is so unfathomable,” Jian Wushuang murmured. After a long while, he looked at the second feather of the woodpecker.

Buzz, buzz, the same scene appeared.

It was still a person holding a sword and waving it, but this sword seemed to be chopping wood…
