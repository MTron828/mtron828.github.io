1939 Abnormal

In the ancient silver spaceship, it was dead silent.

The disciples of the Luo royal family were astonished.

Even Luo Feng and Luo Tianhong, who were the two leading figures, were shocked.

Although they were in the cabin, they could see what happened outside clearly.

At first, they knew that the people who could drive such a spaceship were definitely experts. However, they were fighting against Soul Snatching Palace!

Especially the five masked men. Back then, the five masked men had attacked and wiped out the Luo royal family.

Hence, they were terrified.

But in the end, everyone else from Soul Snatching Palace had been killed besides the masked man, who appeared to be the leader. He was captured alive.

Even Jian Wushuang and the rest had yet to reveal themselves. Merely a war puppet and a golden light, it took care of everything easily.

“They... who are they?”

It stirred up a great commotion in the hearts of the Luo royal family members.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t care about them. His eyes were cold as he looked at the masked man in the black robe in front of him.

Although the masked man in the black robe was covered by the mask, he could tell from his eyes that he was extremely terrified.

“The golden light is too scary. Chaotic Real Gods didn’t even stand a chance to struggle before they were instantly killed. The person who performed the golden light is definitely an Almighty!” The masked man in the black robe shivered in fear.

He had never expected that he would come across an Almighty when he was after the remaining members of the Luo royal family.

“Tell me. What’s the relationship between Holocaust Sect and Soul Snatching Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked in a peaceful tone.

The masked man in the black robe felt his heart skip a beat. He replied without many expressions, “I offended mister by accident. Please forgive me. As for the Holocaust Sect that mister mentioned, I have no idea what you are talking about.”

“No idea?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “It was the Cruor Formation by Holocaust Sect. Do you think I don’t recognize it?”

The masked man in the black robe quivered and didn’t dare to quibble further.

The Cruor Formation was exclusively owned by Holocaust Sect.

Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to see through the formation. Even out of Almighties, only those who were more knowledgeable could recognize it.

The masked man in the black robe had trusted in luck and thought Jian Wushuang might not know the origins of the formation. But then…

However, as his identity was recognized, the masked man in the black robe didn’t intend to say much.

“You don’t want to say? It’s okay.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and suddenly lifted his head, “Look at me.”

The masked man in the black robe looked at Jian Wushuang subconsciously. Just as his gaze met Jian Wushuang’s… Vroom. There was a boundless soul power that surged.

The soul power instantly immersed itself into the mask man’s head and violated his consciousness.

Soul control!

Jian Wushuang was going to soul control him.

With his current soul power, it wasn’t difficult to soul control a Real God.

The masked man in the black robe struggled for a while but he resumed tranquility very quickly.

“Master,” the masked man in the black robe bowed to Jian Wushuang politely and there was passion in his eyes.

“I’ll ask you something,” Jian Wushuang immediately questioned.

The masked man in the black robe was soul controlled and he naturally wouldn’t keep any secrets from Jian Wushuang.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang had got the answers that he wanted.

“Soul Snatching Palace is really involved with Holocaust Sect,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

According to the masked man in the black robe’s information, Soul Snatching Palace had managed to wipe out Luo royal family and conquered the entire Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo thanks to full support from Holocaust Sect.

Then, Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo looked as though they were ruled by Soul Snatching Palace. But in actual fact, Holocaust Sect was fully controlled by Holocaust Sect.

In Soul Snatching Palace’s old lair, there were many experts from Holocaust Sect. Among them, not only were there Real God experts in masks, there were even people of Blood Demon level from Holocaust Sect.

Blood demon from Holocaust Sect was only a title. It represented experts of Sir God level.

In Soul Snatching Palace, there were Sir Gods from Holocaust Sect, more than one of them!

Of course, the masked man in the black robe that Jian Wushuang had soul controlled couldn’t be considered a higher-up of Holocaust Sect. Hence, he didn’t know how many experts from Holocaust Sect were in Soul Snatching Palace.

“That’s strange. Holocaust Sect has been in the dark all this while. Even though they control many forces in the dark, they have been extremely careful in their actions. Even if they need to refine treasures and improve their power to massacre, they would massacre the entire territory with thunderous measures and leave immediately. But now, Holocaust Sect has helped Soul Snatching Palace in action and conquered the Holy Kingdom?”

“Although they are still careful and never reveal their identity as Holocaust Sect. They obviously came into the light after all.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He found the behavior of Holocaust Sect fishy.

“Regardless, as Holy Kingdom of Celestial Fountain is controlled by Holocaust Sect, I can’t just ignore it,” Jian Wushuang muttered and immediately took out a token.

The token belonged to Purple Moon Emperor.

Jian Wushuang sent Purple Moon Emperor a message directly.

“Jian Wushuang, you said that you met people from Holocaust Sect and Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo who were already conquered by Holocaust Sect?” Purple Moon Emperor was shocked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“I find this fishy,” Purple Moon Emperor muttered, “Hold on for a while.”

Jian Wushuang waited. Then, Purple Moon Emperor sent another message soon after.

“Jian Wushuang, I just spoke to Ancestor Tian Chen. He also thought that Holocaust Sect behaved unusually this time. Sanctuary Alliance has been dealing with Holocaust Sect for so many years and they have never been so high-profile. There is definitely a reason behind it,” Purple Moon Emperor said.

“I thought so too,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ancestor Tian Chen said that you are also one of the members from Sanctuary Alliance. As you happen to come across this affair, he wishes for you to clarify this and wipe off all experts from Holocaust Sect,” Purple Moon Emperor said.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded and agreed straight away.

Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace, the two dark forces were Sanctuary Alliance’s biggest enemies.

Jian Wushuang was also a member from Sanctuary Alliance. He naturally wouldn’t refuse.

Plus, as for the reason why Jian Wushuang agreed so heartily, besides the fact that he was a member of Sanctuary Alliance, there was also another reason.

It was Leng Ruxue!

Leng Ruxue, Lord Leng, was also a member of Holocaust Sect. He wanted to know the whereabouts of Leng Ruxue. It would be best to start with the experts in Holocaust Sect.

He happened to run into one and he naturally wouldn’t miss it. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If you were to run into any problem or trouble, drop me a message. And, be careful. Holocaust isn’t an easy opponent.”

Purple Moon Emperor exhorted and then cut off their communication.
