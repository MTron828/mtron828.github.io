Chapter 1142: Strength of Soul

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Of course! Strength of Soul is indeed a formidable force,” said Gu King.

“It’s versatile. It’ll even become the focus of your cultivation once your levels are as high as those of King Luo Zhen or the founder of the Star Bloodline. Every expert is willing to try all means to improve his or her Strength of Soul.

“In the beginning, almost every expert is just barely able to ignite his or her Fire of Soul. At that time, it’ll look like a tiny spark. With the advancing of your cultivation, it’ll gradually grow strong and powerful.

“That said, it’s extremely difficult to turn the tiny spark into a formidable force. In Eternal Chaotic World, almost every expert made an arduous effort to cultivate his or her consciousness, but most of them could not succeed in gaining this formidable Strength of Soul. However, you, a person who adapt an Inverse Cultivation method and have just become a Dao Master… are able to ignite your Fire of Soul. That’s incredible!”

Gu King exclaimed while thinking in astonishment,?“The probability of someone igniting his or her Fire of Soul is extremely low. How come this Jian Wushuang, a practioner of Inverse Cultivation could manage to do that when he reached just the fourth level of his cultivation? That’s really enviable.”

“I’m happy to hear you say so. Well, I’m lucky to ignite this Fire of Soul, but I really want to know what it can do for me right now, when I’m still far below the levels of King Luo Zhen.” asked Jian Wushuang.

“What it can do for you right now? It can help you a lot, way beyond your imagination,” said Gu King. “For example, in the past, if you wanted to make a thorough search of this battlefield in front of you, you could only rely on your Scarlet Eye Secret Skill, namely your eyes and your extremely weak psychic ability. However, now you can use your Strength of Soul to do that.”

“Are you saying that I can use my Strength of Soul to search an area?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise and then quickly activated his Strength of Soul contained in his Fire of Soul.

He found it easy to manipulate this Strength of Soul. It was just like controling his consciousness.

The next moment, he felt his Strength of Soul gradually spreading out, and in the meantime, he discovered that a detailed map of the battlefield somehow formed in his mind. All the details about his surroundings were depicted on this map, including those that he could never detect with just his eyes and psychic ability.

For instance, with the help of his Strength of Soul, he suddenly found out that there was something special about a piece of red rock which he had come across before.

Now he knew for sure that this piece of red rock contained very valuable minerals.

“Wow, I can see everything this clearly!?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in amazement and wonder.

“Take it easy. There are more surprises ahead. Continue to spread out your Strength of Soul,” said Gu King.

Upon hearing Gu King’s remarks, Jian Wushuang further diffused his Strength of Soul, trying to cover a larger area. The next moment, he got shocked.

“What? This Strength of Soul can extend to several million kilometers and it still keeps extending?” exclaimed Jian Wushuang.

“It can extend to fifteen million kilometers!” said Gu King.

Jian Wushuang widened his eyes in astonishment.

“A Dao Master, no, even a Holy Master, is only able to see things at most 500,000 kilometers away with the help of his or her psychic ability.

“However, with the help of Strength of Soul, now I can see things 15,000,000 kilometers away. That’s amazing,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“Now, Jian Wushuang, try your consciousness attack again,” Gu King said smilingly.

“A consciousness attack?” Jian Wushuang asked surprisedly. He quickly activated his Strength of Soul again to display his Mind-controlling Secret Skill.

The next moment, his black-colored Strength of Soul rushed out into the air and cohered into a spine.

Although it did not hit any target since he had not aimed at anything, he still noticed the remarkable ferocity and momentum in the spine.

This consciousness attack fueled by his Strength of Soul was more than 10 times stronger than his regular consciousness attack.

“This…” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Strength of Soul is a multipurpose miracle force, but now all you can do with your Strength of Soul is searching and attacking, since you’ve just ignited your Fire of Soul and you strength is still weak. When your Strength of Soul grows stronger, you’ll find out more about it.

“Anyway, you really impressed me by igniting your Fire of Soul as a Dao Master. Remember to keep nourishing your soul in the future. When your cultivation levels are as high as those of King Luo Zhen. Your Strength of Soul is definitely going to amaze the world,” said Gu King, solemnly.

Jian Wushuang put a smile on his face upon hearing that.

Although he was not sure what was going to happen in the future, he was really pleased with his recent progress. At least, his consciousness attack was much stronger than before. That meant the ferocity of his Sheer Shadow strike and even his battle strength would also be increased.

“I’ve made huge leaps in my cultivation by creating the strongest Sword Principle and becoming a Dao Master. Considering my current powers, I’ll definitely be able to summon a much stronger Blaze Quicksand Realm. And now, I’m even bestowed with this amazing Strength of Soul… I’ve never imagined that I can be so powerful,”?Jian Wushuang thought while clenching his fists in excitement.

“Unfortunately, although I’ve reached the levels of a Dao Master, I’ve not yet increased my Ancient God Power or mastered more advanced Blood-killing Plate Armor Secret Skills other than the most elementary ones. Worse still, after reaching the fourth stage of my Inverse Cultivation, I’m no longer in Eternal Realm. That means I’m going to lose the ability to make my life everlasting.”

With this in mind, Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh.

There were three stages of mastering Blood-killing Plate Armor Secret Skills. By mastering only the stage-one skills, Jian Wushuang had drastically increased his offensive power by ten times. If he had mastered the stage-two skills by now, his powers would have been further increased.

Compared to that, leaving Eternal Real caused a more realistic problem to Jian Wushuang: he could no longer keep his life everlasting.

In the past, he had been capable of incorporating his Life Core into all the cells in his body. As such, he had always been able to come back to life even if there was only one drop of his blood left in this world.

However, he could not do that any more after becoming a Dao Master, since his Life Core was pushed out of his cells now. Fortunately, he became more resilient in physiological responses to recurrent damage.

“Well, my gains and losses seem to offset each other, but my current level of battle strength is several notches above my original level.”

With this in mind, he gradually calmed down. Before long he arrived at the Chillywind Valley.

Jian Wushuang stared in rapture at a seemingly bottomless sinkhole at the bottom of the valley.

“There must be a treasure lying at the bottom of the hole. Let me try my newly-gained Strength of Soul. Maybe I’ll be able to see the inside of the hole,” he said as he started to diffuse his Strength of Soul.

With a buzzing sound, his strength dived into the hole.

After a moment, when his strength went several thousands kilometers down into the hole, he clearly felt that there was an extremely cold energy hindering the advancement of his strength.

He worked up his Strength of Soul, his face becoming solemn from the exertion, but he only managed to push his strength another 500 kilometers forward.

He frowned and said, “What a strange thing. My Strength of Soul seems to be blocked by something down there.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“There’s indeed a treasure placed at the bottom of the Cillywind Valley. It’s extremely cold and has abundant Yin energy. It’s not surprising that it’s able to stop your Strength of Soul from getting into the depths of the hole. After all, your reservoir of strength is still feeble,” said Gu King.
