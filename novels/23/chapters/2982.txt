Chapter 2983: Higher-Ups

——

“He killed a Peak False Saint in the assessment? Why didn’t you say so earlier? You didn’t mention him in the report you gave me.” Prince Qian Chen said in a low voice.

“Your Highness, we only found out after careful investigation. During the assessment, Heavenly Sword Marquis did kill a Peak False Saint in the supreme divinity realm. His combat strength was comparable to a normal True Saint. At that time, Princess Long Yun and Princess Xue Yu, who also came from the Heaven and Earth Palace, saw it with their own eyes.” The man in the triangular helmet said.

“Long Yun and Xue Yu, the two of them?” Prince Qian Chen’s expression changed.

He was also a genius from the Heaven and Earth Palace, so he naturally knew about Long Yun and Xue Yu.

“At that time, Prince Long Yun and Prince Xue Yu were also shocked by the talent of Heavenly Sword Marquis. They decided on the spot that Heavenly Sword Marquis could definitely enter the primitive palace and even had a chance to enter the Primal Chaos Palace. Therefore, the two of them immediately went to invite Heavenly Sword Marquis, but he rejected them.”

“Royal Highness Long Yun and Royal Highness Xue Yu had no choice but to report this matter to the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. For some unknown reason, the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance have yet to make any movements. However, they have concealed quite a bit of information about Heavenly Sword Marquis. We only found out about this matter because this mission concerns you, Royal Highness Qian Chen,” said the man in the triangular helmet.

“Is that so?” His Highness Qian Chen raised his eyebrows and asked, “How long has it been since the last test?”

“80 years,” the man in the triangular helmet said.

Hearing this, His Highness Qian Chen’s pupils shrank, “In other words, during these 80 years, Heavenly Sword Marquis still hasn’t broken through to the Immortal Saint level, but his battle strength has soared again. Before, he only had the battle strength of a first-level True Saint, but now he has the battle strength of a second-level True Saint. Is it enough to fight with me?”

“That’s right, but it doesn’t exclude the fact that he had hidden his strength 80 years ago,” the triangular-shaped battle-helmet man said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hmph, no matter what, Heavenly Sword Marquis is an out-and-out super genius. Long Yun and Xue Yu were right. If he really is just a Divine Master, then with the battle prowess he has displayed now, he can easily join the Primal Palace. It’s not even a problem for him to join the Primal Chaos Palace. I just didn’t think that my luck would be so good.”

“In the entire Beginning Divine World, there are billions of geniuses in a single era. Only a dozen or so are qualified to join the Primal Chaos Palace. But this time, I actually met one?” Prince Qian Chen sighed inwardly.

The Heaven Earth Palace and the Primal Chaos Palace were both places where geniuses gathered, but the difference between the two was like heaven and earth.

The Primal Chaos Palace’s super-genius was definitely more than a hundred times stronger than him, and it was even more than that.

Such a genius was rare in the entire Beginning Divine Realm. He was lucky to have met one.

“Your Highness Qian Chen, we have reported the matter of Heavenly Marquis Sword in detail. I believe that the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will know how to handle it properly,” said the man in the triangular helmet.

“How else can we get out?”

“Such a super genius is coveted by every major force in the Beginning Divine World. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance is no exception. If I’m not wrong, those old fellows of the three palaces of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance are already thinking of ways to rope in the Heavenly Sword Marquis,” said His Highness Qian Chen with a strange smile.

“Forget it, I’ve already completed my mission. The rest of the matters have nothing to do with me. I’ll let those old fellows handle it themselves. As for Heavenly Sword Marquis, although I admire his talent, the competition among the three palaces is already very intense. There’s even a limited number of spots in the Chaos Palace. If he were to take another spot, the competition among us would be even greater. Therefore, it’s best if he doesn’t join us.”

After saying a few words, Prince Qian Chen left.

…

The vast Beginning Divine World was vast and boundless.

And there were many places in the Beginning Divine World that were still in a state of chaos.

At this moment, in a chaotic void, three ancient and powerful existences were gathered together.

Any one of these three existences was enough to intimidate an entire region. Any one of them was enough to make the Immortal Saint kneel and tremble.

“This just came from the endless territory. Take a look.” A three-eyed man over three meters tall with bronze skin casually threw out a token.

As soon as the token was thrown out, a huge mirror image immediately appeared.

In the image, it was the fierce battle between Jian Wushuang and Prince Qian Chen in the Dragon Flame World.

The three super existences looked at the scene in the mirror image with great interest.

“I know this little guy. His name is Qian Chen, and he comes from the Heaven and Earth Palace of our Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Although he’s not the best among the many little guys in the Heaven and Earth Palace, he’s still very outstanding. Moreover, he just broke through to the Immortal Saint not long ago. Logically speaking, he should have completed the experiential learning mission by now,” a green-haired woman said, her voice was soft and gentle, making people feel as refreshing as a breeze.

“He is indeed on a training mission. The content of this mission is rather simple…” the three-eyed man briefly recounted the contents of Princess Qian Chen’s mission, then, he continued, “Originally, this training mission didn’t have much pressure on him. As long as he is careful not to let those who possess the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse escape, he will be able to complete the 100% mission. However, it is clear that his luck isn’t that good.”

“Haha, I can see that.” An old man with white hair smiled, “The 12 teams were originally made up of several Peak False Saints and two or three first rank True Saints. But now, he has encountered an extremely powerful little guy in this team.”

The old man had already seen the scene in which Jian Wushuang used the reincarnation sword formation and his own swordsmanship to fight head-on with Princess Qian Chen, and he faintly gained the upper hand.

“This little guy with a sword is comprehending both the reincarnation rule and the space-time rule at the same time, and he is using his own swordsmanship and sword formation to perfectly combine the two rules. Not bad,” the green-haired woman said in surprise.

“You should pay attention to the aura that the little guy is emitting,” the three-eyed man said.

“This aura…Divine Master?” The green-haired woman and the vicissitudes of life elder were both surprised.

“It can’t be. He fought Qian Chen head-on and didn’t lose at all. In the end, he’s just a reverent-god level expert?” The green-haired woman immediately looked at the three-eyed man. “Is this little guy’s realm certain?”

“He was certain before, but now, he’s a little uncertain.” The three-eyed man shook his head and began to explain, “Previously, when this little guy participated in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment, he displayed extraordinary talent. He killed a Peak False Saint with his Divine Master level cultivation. At that time, we thought that he should be a Peak Genius.”

“But now…”
