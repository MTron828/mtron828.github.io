“Why can he use Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack?” Bei Xiu was curious.

“Few talents here knows this knack. I want to meet this guy.” Bei Xiu told his surbordinate.

“OK. I will arrange it.” His subordinate in a purple robe said.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang’s battle with three level-three Soul Masters had also came to the last phase.

No matter how hard the three Soul Masters tried, they couldn’t penetrate the Black Tortoise that Jian Wushuang wore. Instead, they got beaten severely by his Demonic Dragon.

Jian Wushuang won!

After the battle, Jian Wushuang chose to have a rest and recover his soul power.

“After over ten battles, my soul power has been almost exhausted.” Jian Wushuang thought.

At that moment, the elder in a purple robe came to him.

“Master Jian Wushuang.”

As he was only a Primary Level-three Soul Master and Jian Wushuang was a peak one, he should indeed called Wushuang “Master” to show respect.

“You are?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I was asked by Master Bei Xiu to come here to invite you. He wants to meet you.”

“Master Bei Xiu?”

“He is at the top among all Level-three Soul Masters, only second to Real Gods. Even Real Gods have to respect him for his extraordinary background.” Huo Yi said.

“Yes, but he is sometimes too proud.” Feng Tao seemed to dislike Bei Xiu.

“Whatever. I will go.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Please follow me.” The elder in a purple robe said.

Soon they arrived at a brilliant palace.

It was a golden palace, in which there were two luxurious tables. In front of a table sat a young man.

At the center of the palaces, many beautiful ladies were dancing.

“Master Bei Xiu, this is Master Jian Wushuang.” The elder in a purple robe told the young man.

Then Bei Xiu welcomed Jian Wushuang smilingly, “Brother Jian Wushuang? Hello! Just call me Bei Xiu!”

“Brother Bei Xiu.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Have a seat please.”

The Jian Wushuang sat in front of the other table face to face with Bei Xiu.

“I have watched your battle with other soul masters. I admire your power so much. Could I be friends with you?” Bei Xiu lifted a cup of wine.

Jian Wushuang had to accept such generosity.

They drank several cups of wine.

Then Bei Xiu asked all the subordinates and dancers to leave.

Only he and Jian Wushuang were in the palace now.

Jian Wushuang continued to drink and said nothing. He knew clearly that Bei Xiu’s intention was more than making friends with him.

“Brother Wushuang.”

Bei Xiu started to say, “I saw that in the battle you used a very powerful consciousness attack. I have a hobby of collecting those powerful tricks. Could you please show me that skill?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He didn’t expect that Bei Xiu coveted his Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack was indeed extraordinary.

“Brother Bei Xiu, to be honest, my knack looks powerful but actually, its level is just mediocre. And what’s more, I learned the knack from my master, who told me not to teach anyone, including my own son. So I think I have to refuse you.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t hurry to refuse.”

Bei Xiu smiled and took out a token, telling Jian Wushuang, “I have a reward for you. This token is the well-known Feng Ling Knack, one of the top five consciousness knacks in the Tian Ling Mystery Land. I think it’s powerful enough for an exchange.”

Jian Wushuang took a glance without any interest.

Being famous in the Tian Ling Mystery Land meant nothing to Jian Wushuang.

Feng Lin Knack was only for controlling consciousness. But Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack was for controlling the soul, surpassing hundreds of Feng Lin Knacks combined.

Jian Wushuang would accept only if he was foolish.

When Jian Wushuang showed no interest. Bei Xiu took out another treasure.

It was an ancient bronze mirror, looking shabby but actually having extraordinary power.

“It’s a high-level treasure for consciousness attack. Generally, it can double the power of users.”

“I don’t think you have one.”

“That’s true.”

“Do you want to exchange these two things with me? You can be at the top of all level-three Soul Masters with them!”

But Jian Wushuang remained indifferent.

“Thank you for you generosity. But I have to follow my teacher who taught me the knack.”

Jian Wushuang said indifferently.
