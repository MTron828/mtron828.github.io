Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Five Sir Gods teamed up and set up the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts but couldn’t kill you. On the contrary, you killed one of us instead. Jian Wushuang, you are much stronger than we, Acheron Palace, imagined.”

“Luckily, we of Acheron Palace have prepared room for a maneuver.”

A creepy and hoarse voice was heard from the person in the crimson robe.

As his voice reverberated, the person in the crimson robe flipped his palm and took out a crimson token.

The crimson token gave out a strange aura. As the person in the crimson robe clenched, pak! The token broke and a billowing strength covered Jian Wushuang instantly.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes fixed and his consciousness slowly immersed. It was as though he almost fell asleep.

“Jian Wushuang, quickly, wake up. This is a soul control trick!”

“Quickly wake up!”

King of Venomous Worms’s roar of fear and anger rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

The vigorous soul fire in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness was burning and there was a sharp ache that suddenly hit him.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated with horror and his features turned ferocious.

“You want to conduct soul control on me?”

“Dream!!!”

Jian Wushuang was roaring in madness as he tried to shake off the unique situation.

After a while, everything settled down.

Jian Wushuang continued to stand there as he panted. His face grew unusually solemn.

“It seems like I failed,” the person in the crimson robe glanced at Jian Wushuang and he sneered, “but that’s right. After all, he’s an inverse cultivator. He nurtured his soul fire long ago. He naturally wouldn’t be as easy to control as Lei Chao.”

“B*stard,” There was billowing murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

He could tell that Lei Chao was soul controlled by the person in the crimson robe before him. However,?soul control wasn’t something he could perform and it was only contained in the token. The person in the crimson robe only played a guiding role.

“To be able to save a soul attack in a token and activate it by another person, and it still could control Lei Chao who is an expert on Real God ranking list… The person who performed the soul control is much stronger than I imagined,” King of Venomous Worms said.

Previously, King of Venomous Worms had thought the expert who performed soul control would be an Emperor God who was good at soul attacks. However, from the looks of it, he wouldn’t be an ordinary Emperor God.

“As I couldn’t soul control you, I have to kill you personally,” the person in the crimson smiled leisurely and there was another crimson trident in his hand.

“Go!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The person in the crimson robe waved his hand and the crimson trident quivered suddenly and charged at Jian Wushuang.

The stab brought about boundless power of the universe and crimson light flooded in. It was terrifyingly dark.

Jian Wushuang felt that he was locked in on by the trident. No matter how he dodged, even if he ran to the end of the world, he wouldn’t be able to dodge the trident’s attack.

In particular, the terrifying power that the trident contained made Jian Wushuang’s hair stand.

“Ancient God unique skill, Eight Divine Mountains!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and the divine power in his body flowed out. He broke three Ancient God stars and the increased boundless Ancient God power had yet to disperse.

But then, it was venting out like a tsunami.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Eight lofty golden sacred mountains appeared from nowhere. Every sacred mountain was lofty and far bigger than before. It formed eight layers of barriers in front of Jian Wushuang.

It was the strongest defense unique skill of Ancient God tribe. It was performed by Jian Wushuang after he broke three stars. It was powerful enough for a Sir God to feel hopeless.

However, the crimson trident hit the eight golden sacred mountains directly. Bang! Bang! Bang!

Eight continuous bangs and the eight lofty sacred mountains only hindered the trident for a while before it pierced them.

The crimson trident that contained shocking power flew at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s face changed. Then, there was cirri that shot out like lightning. King of Venomous Worms’ body reappeared again and instantly formed a huge net.

Hong!

The huge net shattered and countless cirri strangled into pieces. There were parts of King of Venomous Worms’ body that were torn apart as well. However, the trident’s power remained as it flew at Jian Wushuang.

There was a chilly gleam in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He gripped Blood Mountain Sword in his hand tightly, then a boundless divine power flowed out and he slashed.

Dang!

There was a loud thud and Jian Wushuang’s body shook vigorously. Blood Mountain Sword nearly fell out of his hand as he moved backwards from the impact. He took a dozen steps back before he steadied himself again. After he stopped, there was blood flowing out of the corner of his mouth.

“He’s too strong. This is the power of an Emperor God?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He gave his all and broke three stars to perform Eight Divine Mountains. However, they were instantly pierced while the defense skill that King of Venomous Worms had performed was broken down directly as well.

Then, the stroke that he had cast with full force flew off as well and he was injured. It was merely a casual hit by the person in the crimson robe.

His one hit was so powerful?

“No way. An ordinary Emperor God won’t be this powerful. He is definitely an expert among Emperor Gods!” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head and his voice was solemn.

“Experts among Emperor Gods?” Jian Wushuang muttered. He subconsciously looked at the crimson trident in the person in the crimson robe’s hand. Then, his eyes dilated with shock.

“An Emperor God using a crimson trident? And it is so powerful…”

“Xue Gu!”

“You are Emperor God Xue Gu!”

Jian Wushuang shouted.

“Hehe, it seems like you recognized me,” the person in the crimson robe let out a burst of strange laughter but didn’t deny it.

“It’s really him,” Jian Wushuang’s face immediately grew grave.

He had been in Sanctuary Alliance for so long and he had a simple understanding of the Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World. He did that so that when he was wandering outside, he could identify those who were more powerful and make a move earlier, in order to minimize the possibility of having a conflict.

Among the Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World, there was Emperor God Xue Gu.

Emperor Xue Gu kept himself to himself and he was evil in disposition. He was truly a devil but he happened to be terrifyingly powerful. Among Emperor Gods, he wasn’t at the top, but he was in the middle-upper range.

The divine weapon that Emperor God Xue Gu was using was the crimson trident. He was the only one among Emperor Gods in Eternal Chaotic World that used a strange divine weapon like the crimson trident.

Hence, when Jian Wushuang saw the crimson trident, he recognized him immediately.

“No wonder Emperor God Xue Gu rejected Sanctuary Alliance’s invitation so many times and he was even too lazy to bother with Sanctuary Alliance. He turned out to be Acheron Palace’s man,” Jian Wushuang was terrified and angry.
