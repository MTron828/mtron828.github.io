Chapter 1106: Sinkhole

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In a flash, eight years passed by.

“Haha, I’ve succeeded!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and there was a gold thunderbolt flashing past his eyes. He had shut himself in the cave mansion for eight years.

He had finally reached Level Three of the Divine Yin Thunder Secret Skill.

At the first level of the skill, he could produce the most ordinary black thunderbolts.

At Level Two, they turned scarlet.

And now, at Level Three of the skill, he could produce gold thunderbolts.

They contained extremely ferocious power which was at least 10 times more than that of the Scarlet Thunderbolts produced at Level Two of the skill.

“When this Secret Skill reached Level Two, it had little impact on my overall strength. Now that it has reached Level Three, it’ll help increase the power of my swordsmanships once I learn to combine both together. My overall power could even reach a new level!”?he thought.

“Currently, I’m faster than the advanced Celestial Masters, but in terms of power, I’m much weaker than them. Now that I have reached a higher level of proficiency in Divine Yin Thunder, the power of my swordsmanships will increase, thereby solving the issue of my power shortage.

“I’m definitely much stronger than before.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists together. He was feeling somewhat expectant.

He wanted to test his strength against an opponent to see how much he had improved.

He had no luck finding any expert from the Jin Kingdom in the vast battlefield, however.

In fact, he had only encountered one after wandering for so many years.

“I can only wait for the next opportunity,”?Jian Wushuang thought, trying hard to suppress his desire to fight.

After successfully achieving Level Three proficiency in Divine Yin Thunder, Jian Wushuang left the cave mansion and resumed his journey, casually wandering about in the battlefield.

It seemed boundless; it was huge. Also, it was fraught with many natural perilous places.

They were so dangerous that even any of the five Green Fire Palace Masters could die if they stepped into the traps by accident. Needless to say, the probability of an ordinary Celestial Master dying from falling into the traps was even higher.

Five years after he achieved a breakthrough in the Divine Yin Thunder Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang came to a place that had an extremely peculiar landscape.

“This is…”

Jian Wushuang studied the ground in front of him, looking a little awestruck.

As far as he could see, there was a pitch black bottomless sinkhole on the ground.

Jian Wushuang’s eyesight was extremely sharp now, and the sinkhole had to be at least more than 33 kilometers if he could not see its bottom, even after utilizing the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill.

Furthermore, it was much, much too wide.

All Jian Wushuang could see was the sinkhole; it stretched for at least 3,000 kilometers.

“How was such a huge sinkhole formed? Could it be also created by a fight between experts?” uttered Jian Wushuang in awe.

“That’s highly possible,” nodded Gu King solemnly inside Jian Wushuang. “There are countless experts in the Eternal Chaotic World, and some of them, like the creator of the Star Bloodline and King Luo Zhen, the Eight-star Imperial God, are so powerful that they can easily destroy an Eternal World with a simple move. The sinkhole in front of you could very possibly be created by one punch of such an expert,” he continued.

“From one punch?” Jian Wushuang asked. He cleared his throat and took in a deep, cold breath.

Just at this moment…

“Jian Wushuang, look quickly toward your left,” Gu King said hurriedly.

Jian Wushuang did as told, his pupils immediately shrinking.

Using the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill, he could clearly see a golden glow less than 30 kilometers far away from his left. Even though it was extremely faint and hard for even an ordinary Celestial Master to spot, Jian Wushuang still managed to notice it.

He immediately dashed toward the glow without hesitation.

He covered the distance between the glow and himself in an instant, appearing in front of it.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang said, looking pleasantly surprised as he saw the true color of the golden glow.

“Ancient God Power!” he exclaimed.

Jian Wushuang kept his gaze fixed squarely on the four golden droplets of water; he knew very clearly what sort of power they contained.

Before he had left the Green Fire Palace, Tang Emperor had given him a similar droplet—it turned out to be the Ancient God Power.

“Four droplets of Ancient God Power?” asked Jian Wushuang, pleasantly surprised. He then kept them in his Interspatial Ring. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“You’re in luck, aren’t you, Jian Wushuang?” teased Gu King.

“Haha,” laughed Jian Wushuang readily.

Indeed, he was in luck.

There were many uses for the Ancient God Power, especially for Jian Wushuang.

At the Fire Point Exchange Office, one droplet of Ancient God Power was worth exactly 5,000 Fire Points.

As such, the four droplets he just collected was worth 20,000 Fire Points. They were worth as much as the valuable giant axe obtained by Celestial Master Yi much earlier.

Soon, however, Jian Wushuang began to look doubtful.

“How did four droplets of Ancient God Power come to be suspended above the sinkhole?”?he thought.

He turned his gaze toward the pitch black, bottomless sinkhole below him subconsciously. At this moment…

A booming sound suddenly came from the bottom of the sinkhole. Jian Wushuang then felt the land around him starting to shake violently.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang asked, frowning.

“Jian Wushuang, I have a bad feeling about this. You had better leave while you can,” said Gu King solemnly.

“I feel the same way,” Jian Wushuang replied, squinting. He then dashed toward the Void at some distance away, not daring to stay for even a little while.

Not long after he began to move, however, the booming sound grew louder, before something exploded out of the sinkhole.

A bone-chilling force was rising out.

It looked like a long-dormant volcano erupting.

It was terrible!

A terrible force!

The moment the force rose out from the sinkhole, the Void above it began to disintegrate like paper.

The force contained huge shearing power, and it destroyed the area and everything around it.

“That’s not good!” exclaimed Jian Wushuang, his expression changing.

“Flee, Jian Wushuang. Flee quickly!” roared Gu King.

Jian Wushuang had reacted extremely swiftly. The moment he could sense the booming sound, he immediately dashed toward the Void at the edge of the sinkhole, but the twisting force was still moving too quickly for him.

He had just reached the border of the sinkhole and had yet to escape from it, when the force caught up with him.
