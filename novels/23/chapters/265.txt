Chapter 266: Questioning

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It’s quite easy to find an excuse.” Ling Han said with a smile, “In three days, Wilderness Sword Sect and Daluo Heaven Sect and many other old sects in Northern Region will hold a competition for disciples.”

“It’s held every year, and disciples of these sects under 30 years old are qualified. This year, the best genius of Wilderness Sword Sect is called Chen Feng, son of Wilderness Sword Sect Master.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang realized what Daluo Heaven Sect needed him to do.

“Wilderness Sword Sect Master is strong and steady, but his Achilles’ heel is his son. Once his son dies, he will go mad.” said Ling Han.

Jian Wushuang asked, “So you want me to kill him in the competition?”

“Yes,” Ling Han nodded, “it happened in the past that some disciples were killed during battles, they didn’t mind too much. Therefore, if you kill Chen Feng accidentally, you will not be blamed.”

“Don’t worry about your identity. There are so many disciples in Daluo, it’s normal for a genius appears. What we only worry about is Chen Feng’s strength.”

Ling Han stopped, then he continued, “Chen Feng has great talent and his Cultivation of Spiritual Power has reached Peak of the Yang Void Realm. Only one in Daluo Heaven Sect could be a match for him, but he is incapable of killing him, that’s why we sought help from Alchemy School.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Daluo Heaven Sect needed an excuse to deal with Wilderness Sword Sect. If Chen Feng was killed in the competition, Wilderness Sword Sect Master would go mad and do something crazy. Therefore, Daluo Heaven Sect would have a good excuse to fight back.

“Do you agree?” Ling Han looked over at him.

“I have one condition,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“What is it?” Ling Han didn’t turn a hair.

“On my way here, I was curious about a Sword Skill called Sword Realm which Jun Yi brandished when we fought with each other. I study Sword Principle, so I want to have a look, could I?” Jian Wushuang said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang was curious about it and at the same time he looked forward to it.

“Sword Realm?” Ling Han raised his eyebrows, “it is an extraordinary Sword Skill of high third grade and even could be a match for a low second grade, which is a high level Sword Skill in Daluo Heaven Sect. In general, outsiders could not get it, but...”

In the next breath, Ling Han said, “you are not an outsider strictly, if you promise to help us kill Chen Feng in the competition, what will a Sword Skill of third grade be?”

“Okay, no problem.” Jian Wushuang agreed.

Ling Han smiled, and then he asked in an intentional way, “by the way, you look very young, how old are you?”

“My age... 21 years old.” answered Jian Wushuang.

He was over 20, certainly he could say he is 21 years old.

“21?” Ling Han frowned.

How strong could he be at such a young age?

“May I know your Cultivation of Spiritual Power level...” Ling Han asked.

Though Ling Han was the Ninth Elder of Daluo Heaven Sect, his Cultivation was at Half-saint and did not reach the Saint Realm yet. Besides, Jian Wushuang was good at hiding his level because he cultivated Heavenly Creation Skill. So he couldn’t tell which level Jian Wushuang was at.

Jian Wushuang didn’t answer him, but his spiritual power spread after a quick action.

As soon as his power was unleashed, Ling Han perceived it.

“Initial Yang Void Realm?” Ling Han frowned more.

Chen Feng was at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm!

“Does Elder Ling Han think I am not strong enough?” Jian Wushuang looked over at him with a smile.

“No,” Ling Han shook his head, smiling, “since you are recommended by Alchemy School, there must be a reason.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang smiled and didn’t say more.

“Friend, let me take you to the place you shall live in.” Ling Han brought Jian Wushuang to a courtyard.

...

In the night there was a full moon.

The main meeting hall of Daluo Heaven Sect was closed. Daluo Heaven Sect’s Master and many Elders gathered here, among whom four were experts of the Saint Realm.

“Everything is ready and experts of the Saint Realm of Alchemy School will arrive in two days, waiting for the start.” Daluo Heaven Sect’s Master, a handsome middle-aged man said in a deep voice.

Elders in the hall were all excited at hearing that.

They had waited for this day for so long.

“Elder Ling Han, did the genius sent by Alchemy School arrive?” the middle-aged man looked over at Ling Han.

“He has come, but...” though Ling Han nodded, his expression was strange.

“What?” the middle-aged man asked.

“The genius called Swordsman, he is only 21 years old, more importantly, his Cultivation of Spiritual Power is at Initial Yang Void Realm.” Ling Han said.

“Initial Yang Void Realm?” the middle-aged man’s eyes turned cold.

Most of the Daluo Heaven Sect?Elders presented were also dissatisfied with it.

“What the hell is Alchemy School is doing, sending one of Initial Yang Void Realm?”

“There are many of Initial Yang Void Realm in Daluo Heaven Sect, why would we seek for one more from them?”

“Initial Yang Void Realm, no matter how strong he is, how could he kill an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm?”

Hearing their questioning, Ling Han frowned because he also doubted Jian Wushuang’s strength.

A powerhouse in Initial Yang Void Realm, even if he is an exceptional genius, how strong could he be?

While Chen Feng, not only was he is in Peak of the Yang Void Realm, but he was also a nurtured genius in Wilderness Sword Sect.

“We have prepared so much for this day, any failure is not allowed in the final push.” the handsome middle-aged man said with a cold voice, “Elder Ling Han, try to figure out his real strength, you can send some geniuses to test him, openly or secretly.”

“Figure out whether he is really in defiance of the natural order, otherwise, we have to make other plans as soon as possible.”

“Yes.” Ling Han nodded and left immediately.
