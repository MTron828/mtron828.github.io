Chapter 2005: Expert Troop

Danger!

A danger where Eternal Chaotic World’s existence was at stake!

The Great Emperors on the spot and were extremely sure of that.

“Emperor Bai,” a purple-haired woman stood up.

The purple-haired woman was Great Emperor Zhi Luo in the eleventh place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. She was also a master of a sanctuary.

“As the great formation outside the dark millstone is so powerful and even Emperor Bai can’t have any effect on it, there is only one way to resolve the great formation and to destroy the dark millstone completely. We have to gather all Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World and Sanctuary Alliance. It’d be best if we could have a complete war formation or unique formation to break formation with formation. We could stand a chance to fight against the dark millstone,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo suggested.

“Mm, I was thinking the same,” Emperor Bai nodded faintly. “But it isn’t easy to gather all forces in the entire Eternal Chaotic World at such short notice. On top of that, we have to form a war formation. On the other hand, the dark millstone is getting stronger too quickly and its travel speed is not slow either. Looking at its travel track, it is aiming at where the ten sanctuaries are.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“At most, it would take a few thousand years for the dark millstone to appear in the ten sanctuaries.

“But most importantly, we didn’t even have time for a few thousand years because the size of the dark millstone would be at least a few dozen times bigger after a few thousand years. By then, we won’t be able to have any effect on it even if we gather all Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World.”

“A thousand years. A thousand years at most!”

“Within a thousand years, if we don’t destroy the dark millstone or stop it, Eternal Chaotic World will definitely be exterminated.

Everyone was shocked.

A thousand years?

To Great Emperors, a thousand years passed like a blink of an eye.

However, they had to figure out a way to destroy the dark millstone within a thousand years.

“A thousand years, a thousand years’ time is too short. I’m afraid Sanctuary Alliance won’t be able to prepare much within such a short period of time,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said.

“That’s right. Hence, Red Dragon King, Tian Chen and I discussed it and we plan to send out an expert troop to barge into the dark millstone. Then, Sanctuary Alliance will figure out a way to collaborate from within with forces from without. Then, Sanctuary Alliance won’t need to prepare much but is only required to prepare some experts to form a great formation. That should be sufficient to influence the dark millstone,” Emperor Bai said.

“Expert troop?”

The Great Emperors exchanged a look and nodded.

It was naturally difficult to break a powerful formation with an external attack. However, if it was carried out from within, it would be much easier.

“Emperor Bai, didn’t you say the great formation was extremely tough? It is hard to affect it even when you attacked it personally. Under such circumstances, it wouldn’t be easy for us to break an opening on the great formation and send our experts in, right?” Great Emperor Zhi Luo creased her eyebrows and asked.

“It wouldn’t happen if we forcefully barged in by force, but Sanctuary Alliance’s foundation was solid after being established for so many years. If we were to play some tricks, we would still be able to break an opening to get in. However, the opening wouldn’t last for long. It would only be a split second and we could only send four people at most. Hence, there will only be four people in the expert troop. As for the four people, Red Dragon, Tian Chen and I already discussed it,” Emperor Bai said.

Then, the Great Emperors looked at Emperor Bai.

They knew that there might be a large number of experts from Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace in the dark millstone. It might even be their base camp or lair.

It would be extremely dangerous to barge inside, even if one were a Great Emperor.

Hence, these four members of expert troop definitely couldn’t be reckless.

“Abysmal Saint Master,” Emperor Bai looked at Abysmal Saint Master by his side.

“Mister Emperor Bai,” Although Abysmal Saint Master was arrogant and ambitious, and had been dying to stand on par with Emperor Bai or even above him, he would maintain an appropriate reverence when he was in front of Emperor Bai as he wasn’t powerful enough yet.

“Among the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance, you and Red Dragon are the strongest besides myself. But Red Dragon has got other matters to attend to and couldn’t take up this task. So, you will be the leader of the four-member expert troop to barge into the dark millstone. Will you?” Emperor Bai said.

“Yes,” Abysmal Saint Master nodded in agreement without hesitation.

Although he was arrogant and jealous, he understood right and wrong.

The crisis concerned the life and death of Eternal Chaotic World. As one of the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance, Abysmal Saint Master was naturally obligated.

“Zhi Luo,” Emperor Bai then looked at Great Emperor Zhi Luo. “Although you’re not the strongest of the Great Emperors, your manipulation power of spacetime power is the best amongst all Great Emperors. Especially when you have the few secret skills of spacetime, you would be extremely important at crucial times. Among the four members, all you need to do is to assist the other three, including yourself, to flee.”

“Yes,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo nodded heavily.

“Emperor Jiu Qiao!” Emperor Bai spoke again.

“Mister Emperor Bai,” an elder in a grey robe stood up. He was scrawny and he had a crescent moon mark in between his eyebrows. The aura that he gave out was unique too.

Emperor Jiu Qiao was in ninth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

In terms of power, he was stronger than Great Emperor Zhi Luo by one notch, but he wasn’t that much stronger either.

“No one knows what is inside the dark millstone, especially the spacetime within. If the four-member expert troop from Sanctuary Alliance enters the dark millstone and can’t connect to the outside world using a communication token, we will need your doppelg?nger,” Emperor Bai explained.

“Yes,” Emperor Jiu Qiao didn’t refuse.

When Emperor Bai said that he was going to send a four-member expert troop, he already foresaw himself being one of the members.

Because he was the only one who had a doppelg?nger. It was very useful to send messages between the dark millstone and Sanctuary Alliance.

“The last person.”

Emperor Bai paused and looked at all the surrounding Great Emperors.

The Great Emperors looked solemn.

In the end, Emperor Bai’s gaze stopped on a young man with a sword on his back.

“Jian Wushuang,” Emperor Bai said.

“Me?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He wasn’t nervous, nor was he afraid to go into the dark millstone. But he was shocked.

Not only him, all the surrounding Great Emperors were shocked too.

One should know that the three Great Emperors that Emperor Bai mentioned…

Abysmal Saint Master was strongest in power. Hence, it would require his fighting power to deal with some danger when they entered the dark millstone.

Emperor God Zhi Luo was an expert in spacetime. She could help the members of expert troop to flee at a critical moment.

Emperor Jiu Qiao had a doppelg?nger. In other words, he had a soul that shared two bodies. No matter what happened to his original body, his doppelg?nger would immediately know.

In short, the three of them were extremely useful to the expert troop.

However, what could Jian Wushuang bring to the table?

…
