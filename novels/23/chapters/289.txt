Chapter 290: Fight with a Half-saint Expert

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Heartless Sect had previously gained the upper hand with the help of Jian Wushuang. However, after Xue Ying showed up and killed two of their Protectors, the whole situation had changed.

Xue Ying was rushing toward the third Protector, Leng Yang.

“Leng Yang, run!” Bei Mu, who was busy fighting, cried out.

“Damn it,” Leng Yang said while looking toward Xue Ying with a dark expression.

He wanted to escape, but he could not find a chance because he was tangled up with a Devil of Demons Island. Not far from him, Xue Ying’s eagle-like sharp claw was lashing towards him like lightning.

Leng Yang’s expression changed.

Suddenly...

Boom!

Suddenly, the surrounding area surged and a huge whirlpool appeared. In the center of it, there was a dazzling streak of sword light that was directly slashing towards Xue Ying. If he did not block it, the attack would cut Xue Ying in two.

“Hum?” Xue Ying frowned slightly before immediately blocking the streak of light with his sharp claw.

Clang!

The hits collided with each other, letting out a metallic clash.

Xue Ying raised his head in astonishment, wanting to see the attacker clearly. At this moment, the attacker’s leg seemed to take the form of a long whip as it smashed toward him, with a harsh sound. Xue Ying immediately retreated. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Leng Yang, are you all right?” Jian Wushuang moved towards Leng Yang.

“Swordsman.” Joy flashed across his face as Leng Yang instantly expressed his gratitude. “Thanks.”

“You’re welcome. Let me deal with him.” Jian Wushuang looked toward Xue Ying with a smile.

“OK, just be careful,” Leng Yang said while nodding heavily.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Ying stared at each other.

“Hum, you reckless dude, go to hell,” Xue Ying said with a sneer.

He looked like a flowing red light as he rushed forward, launching another attack with his sharp claw. This time, five scratches emerged from the space in front of him.

“Demonic Claw!”

Because it was being performed by a Half-saint expert like Xue Ying, the scary claw attack was even more terrifying.

However, Jian Wushuang just smiled coldly. He took a step forward, wielding his Triple-kill Sword to collide with the space in question.

“Selfless Sword Technique, sixth move!”

This brilliant stroke collided with the sharp red claw marks that had suddenly appeared.

With a huge booming sound, the scary power exploded. An instant later, the power from the streak of sword light and the flowing red light spread out in all directions.

Dozens of experts were affected by it. Some of them experienced cuts to their chest or shots to their legs. The most unlucky ones had their heads cut off.

The power was so fierce and intense that dozens of corpses within a 100-meter radius began falling down.

“What?”

“What, what happened?”

The experts who were currently locked in a fierce fight became completely stunned. All of them looked toward Jian Wushuang and Xue Ying with a terrified expression.

“Swordsman, it’s him.”

“He blocked the Half-saint expert Xue Ying?”

Many experts of the Heartless Sect immediately recognized Jian Wushuang.

“This guy...” Xue Ying was shocked. Even as a Half-saint expert, he had not gained the upper hand when fighting with a young boy who had only reached the Initial Yang Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang wore a cold smile at this moment. Then his roaring sword essence spread out like the rising tide and lashed against Xue Ying.

“What?”

Xue Ying felt as if he was stuck in mud, which affected his speed and strength. Earlier, he was able to fight evenly against Jian Wushuang, but now he was losing ground.

Boom!

Xue Ying was forced to retreat.

“I tried my best, but still lost ground?”?Xue Ying was surprised.

Jian Wushuang smile.?“I have the upper hand in a head-on confrontation.”

“Since I can’t fight against him in a head-on confrontation, I’ll kill him using my speed.”?Xue Ying thought.

With cold eyes, Xue Ying suddenly disappeared and a red streak of flowing light flashed through the air. In the next moment, he appeared by Jian Wushuang’s side, reaching toward his opponent’s head with his cold, sharp claw.

Shua!

The sharp claw directly glanced off the boy’s head, but it didn’t leave a drop of blood.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang suddenly appeared behind Xue Ying. His Triple-kill Sword took on the appearance of a thunderbolt and lightning as it lashed out.

“How fast!”?Xue Ying thought in shock, turning around to block it.

Jian Wushuang’s powerful swordsmanship erupted.

Streaks of sword light spread out at an amazing speed, shaking the surrounding area. World Origin also erupted, instantly causing Xue Ying to fall into the sea of sword shadows.

Xue Ying widened his eyes and struck out with his sharp claws. He barely blocked those attacks, but could not find a chance to fight back.

More importantly, he was besieged by the flowing tide of sword essence, which restricted his strength and speed, so he could not catch up with Jian Wushuang.

“I’m not his match.”?Xue Ying’s face fell. Though he was reluctant to admit it, that was the truth.

“This guy is terrifying!”

“If I continue to fight with him, I will die!”

After a while, Xue Ying lost his will to fight.

“Lord of Demons Island, you never mentioned that the Heartless Sect had such a powerful expert!” Xue Ying yelled with a snarl, while crazily blocking the blows.

The forlorn roar was so loud that all the experts in the battlefield could hear it clearly. In the next moment, they all felt surprised.

“Lord of Demons Island, I promised to help you sweep out the Heartless Sect, but I have to protect myself first. Now that my life is threatened, I can’t keep my promise. See you!” Xue Ying roared in a low voice. Then he turned to run away.

Xue Ying, who was a Half-saint expert, ranked 131st on the Bloodmoon List, was escaping?
