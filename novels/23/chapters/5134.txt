Swoosh!

Heaven-Reaching Buddha was also moving toward Jian Wushuang and the other man at an extremely fast speed. Every time he moved, they would cross the diameter of an ordinary territory.

With their speed, they would be able to meet Jian Wushuang in less than an incense stick’s time. In that time, they would be able to reach the outside of the Disambiguation Temple.

The smile on the Heaven -Reaching Lord Buddha’s face grew wider as he turned his head to look behind him.

“Wuliang, is there someone ahead who has a great karma with you?”

The Wulliang Lord Buddha was also an Emperor-level existence. He was the controller of the Wuliang Great World among the 3,000 Great Worlds. He was also the most powerful Lord Buddha other than the Heaven-Reaching Buddha. He had the strength of a peak tier 3 expert.

The few Monks who had crossed the Great Desolate Wilderness to enter the Great Si Region were his fourth-generation disciples, and most of the Monks who had gone to the Great Si Region were his disciples. The bold words of ‘I’m willing to spend all my time in the Great Si Region to become Yan Immortals’ were said by the Great Wuliang Buddha himself.

It was precisely this sentence that caused the Monks in the Wuliang Great World to rush forward and rush into the endless Great Desolate Wilderness, crossing half of the Great Desolate Wilderness and crossing the regional wall to enter the Great Si Region.

“It’s my disciple. He seems to be facing a deadly karmic calamity, ” the Wuliang Buddha replied indifferently.

He only mentioned the young samanera and not Jian Wushuang.

After all, he had given the Bodhi Heartwood to Jian Wushuang not long ago. How could he not sense Jian Wushuang’s existence?

Furthermore, he was the Wuliang Lord Buddha who was famous for his deductions. The Great Dao he grasped when he became an Emperor was the Heavenly Dao. Although his grasp of the Dao was only at the intermediate level, he still had the strength of a tier-three Emperor.

“Then let’s save them on the way! It shouldn’t take much time.” Heaven-Reaching Buddha glanced at Emperor Dongyan beside him, then looked at Wuliang Buddha with a meaningful look.

The three of them were considered the strongest existences in the Heaven Realm. When they were born, the Heaven Realm had yet to shatter. They were all princes of their respective sects. Naturally, there were many battles, but in the end, he won.

Dongyan was still alright. He controlled the Land Realm and formed his own faction. He had always been in a competitive relationship with him.

Wuliang entered the Buddhist Sect halfway and became his right-hand man. However, he could sense that Wuliang’s thoughts had never entered the Buddhist Sect.

This meaningful glance made Wuliang feel a little uncomfortable. After suppressing some of the things in his heart, he calmed down and replied, “Of course.”

Heaven-Reaching Buddha retracted his gaze and did not say anything else.

This time, the Qishen Temple had suddenly appeared in the Great Desolate Wilderness. As half of the master of the Great Desolate Wilderness, he did not know about such a secret at all. He actually did not know about it at all.

All these years, Wuliang had been advocating to spread his religion into the Great Si Region, which made him even more puzzled. Now, it seemed that all of this had been premeditated.

Jian Wushuang was fleeing with all his might, but at the same time, he had to be on guard against Xiang Bingyun. He had already reached the point of mental breakdown.

Fortunately, his Heart power was extremely strong due to his Ultimate Dao, comparable to an Emperor. With such a state of mind, he could persist until now. If it was an ordinary Grand Yan Immortal, even a Nine Revolutions would have died several times.

“Kind Sir, hold on. I can feel that life force is right in front of us,” the little Monk said as he played with the prayer beads in his hand.

He was a novice monk from the Wuliang Great World. He grew up on the Wuliang Mountain, which was the Dao Arena of the Wuliang Buddha. He was the sixth-generation disciple of the mountain and had never left the mountain for thousands of years. Now, as soon as he left the mountain, he followed his masters to the most dangerous Great Desolate Wilderness. He passed through half of the Great Desolate Wilderness and arrived outside the regional wall with great difficulty. He was about to enter the Great Si Region that he had always dreamed of. However, he didn’t expect that he would run right into trouble in an instant.

This calamity was a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand times more dangerous than any other calamity he had encountered.

All of his masters had fallen in the Great Desolate Wilderness, and they had not even entered the Great Si Region. They had not even converted a single Great Si Region’s Yan Immortal, and now they were being chased. After a day of wandering, he felt as if he had cultivated for billions of years. “Not good!” Jian Wushuang’s tense body suddenly trembled.

Swish!!!

A sharp claw pierced through Jian Wushuang’s chest. Golden blood flowed

down the claw and dripped onto the young samanera’s face.

“Kind Sir!” The little Monk’s eyes were red. The Grandmaster was dead, the Second Master had self-destructed his Great Dao for him, and the Third Master had abandoned everything to let them live. Everything they did was to let him live, regardless of life and death.

Was the Kind Sir who had been protecting him going to die too?

‘Why?”

The young Monk let go of Jian Wushuang’s hand and the Buddha Beads on his other hand was crushed by him.

“Why is this? We just want to live.” The young samanera’s eyes turned red. The moment he let go of his hand, he dashed out and stood in front of Jian Wushuang.

The young samanera clenched his fists tightly and his face was filled with killing intent. Even his thick eyebrows were trembling. At this moment, he stood in front of Jian Wushuang and looked straight at Xiang Bingyun, the Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

“Get out of the way!” Jian Wushuang endured his injuries. All the treasures on him had been used up while he was escaping. His armor had long been broken, and even the indestructible Wushuang Divine Sword had long been damaged.

Jian Wushuang desperately swung his sword several times and used up the last bit of Thought power to stop Xiang Bingyun. Then he reached out to pull the little Monk, “Hurry up and go!”

“No!” The young Monk opened Jian Wushuang’s arm. Despite his meager strength, he burst out with an immovable power.

It only took a moment for Xiang Bingyun to arrive in front of the little Monk.

“You reckless thing!” The phantom behind Xiang Bingyun disappeared, revealing his original appearance. His height had shrunk a little, and the green scales on his body fluttered in the wind.

“Go to hell!” After chasing for so long, Xiang Bingyun was already extremely angry. He attacked with a deadly hand as his huge palm directly slapped at the little Monk.

Even Jian Wushuang, who was at his peak, did not dare to take the claw of a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal head-on. The little Monk was also fearless. He stood there without blinking, wanting to take it head-on.

It was too late for Jian Wushuang to stop all of this. He did not want to die. He had just mastered the Ultimate Dao and his Ultimate Dao was only at the fifth level. He still had an endless future. He did not want to die here.

“Forget it, I won’t escape.” Jian Wushuang touched the broken Wushuang Divine Sword in his hand. His broken body was floating in the air. He looked at the little Monk who was trying to stop Xiang Bingyun with his hands and smiled.

The young Monk opened his arms and let out a breath.

He had vented all of his 30 million years of cultivation.

At this moment, he suddenly understood. There was zen in his eyes, and his heart opened up.

This broad traceless path was as white as jade. There was zen in his eyes, zen in his heart, and only in his heart. His life was extraordinary. In an instant, the novice Monk, Hu Qing, stepped into the Dao.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
