Chapter 1730: Ask for help

“Breakthrough?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Previously, Qiu Yue went out for training in order to break through and become Real God. Then, she really broke through.

In actual fact, it was fortunate that Qiu Yue broke through and became a Real God and that Parting Hatred Island had scruples. If Qiu Yue were to only be a Universe God and as she was only a maidservant, Parting Hatred Island would have killed her long ago.

“There’s an elixir here. Eat it and rest up by the side,” Jian Wushuang waved and passed her an elixir.

The elixir wasn’t cheap and it was for a Sir God to recover from injury.

Qiu Yue took the elixir and consumed it immediately. Then, she walked to the side obediently. There were immediately experts from Parting Hatred Island who gave her a seat.

“Master of Parting Hatred Island, how many of your disciples did my maidservant kill?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“Li Yun,” the master of Parting Hatred Island looked at Li Yun.

“Island Master, there were six disciples from Parting Hatred Island that had died at the hands of the lady. However, they were all ordinary disciples and they were all Universe Gods,” Li Yun answered.

“Six deaths,” Jian Wushuang heard and he took out a Qian Kun ring, “I am not strict in discipline. There are treasures in Qian Kun ring. Consider it an apology to Parting Hatred Island.”

“How could we accept your apology?” the master of Parting Hatred Island stood up hastily but didn’t dare to take the Qian Kun ring.

“I told you to take it. Just take it,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Yes,” the master of Parting Hatred Island nodded politely as he accepted the Qian Kun ring.

However, with no surprise…

“I, Jian Wushuang, have always been a clear-cut person. My maidservant killed your men in Parting Hatred Island and I should apologize. Now that I have apologized, we should talk about the resentment between my maidservant and the disciples of Parting Hatred Island,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew cold.

Every expert of Parting Hatred Island at the scene was stunned.

They knew that Jian Wushuang wouldn’t just let it slip and take the initiative to apologize. They guessed it.

Then, Jian Wushuang wanted to clear the debt.

“Mister Jian Wushuang, Mo Tao is here. You can go ahead and bring him along,” the master of Parting Hatred Island said.

The surrounding experts of Parting Hatred Island didn’t hesitate either.

At such a crucial moment, pushing their disciple just like that might not be appropriate. However, regardless of where one was in the world, they look at one’s power.

Jian Wushuang’s power was proven. Forget about taking away one disciple who was only a Universe God, even if he were to kill two Real Gods on the spot, he definitely wouldn’t dare to utter a single world.

“It’s unnecessary for me to bring him straight away. It is merely a fight between the juniors. Lineage of Star isn’t as barbaric as Soaring Heaven King Palace,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “How about this? As the two of them harbor deep hatred against one another, let them fight a life and death battle in Parting Hatred Island.”

“Life and death battle?” The experts in Parting Hatred Island were stunned.

“A life and death battle must be determined by life and death. As for who will be dead and who will be alive, that depends on their capabilities. Although Qiu Yue is my maidservant, I will have nothing to say but I’d leave if she were to die at the hands of your disciple in Parting Hatred Island,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I understand. Let’s do as mister has suggested,” the master of Parting Hatred Island nodded with a smile.

However, Mo Tao, who was lying prostrate on the ground, was terrified. He shouted, “No, no, Island Master. You can’t let me fight a life and death battle with her!”

“I am only a Universe God but she already broke through and became Real God. This is unfair. This is an unfair battle!”

Mo Tao roared but the surrounding crowd didn’t do anything. They looked at him with pity.

Unfair?

Yes, the battle was really unfair. So what?

In the world, where was absolute fairness? Everything was decided with power.

Plus, Jian Wushuang was nice enough to give him a chance. If it was someone else, he would have been killed with one slap.

The life and death battle started before long.

Parting Hatred Island was at a disadvantageous position in the battle after all. So, the higher up in Parting Hatred Island didn’t breathe a word of it to anyone, nor did many disciples watch the battle.

The end result was that naturally there was no suspense.

Qiu Yue’s injury recovered after consuming the elixir that Jian Wushuang had given. She took out about seventy percent of her power. As for Mo Tao, he was only an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven, so he was naturally killed easily.

When the dispute was settled…

“Mister Jian Wushuang, I have already arranged a banquet for you. Would you like to stay and have a drink?” The master of Parting Hatred Island was polite.

“Banquet?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

In front of the experts in Parting Hatred Island, she had killed the disciple of Parting Hatred Island. Not only did the experts on Parting Hatred Island not get angry, they were also courteous to him. They had even prepared a banquet for him. They obviously wanted to curry favor with him.

“Power,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

He knew clearly that it was because of his power.

At first, Jian Wushuang didn’t intend to reject him, but suddenly…

“Jian Wushuang, hurry up and come back. Something happened!” Hall Master Yuan sent an urgent message.

Jian Wushuang’s face instantly grew grave.

“I appreciate Island Master’s kindness but I have other matters to attend to and I shall not stay back.”

Jian Wushuang said, then he didn’t bother with the experts on Parting Hatred Island and he immediately took Qiu Yue with him and left.

They didn’t talk much on the way and sped through the journey. Jian Wushuang arrived at Lineage of Star very soon.

After he settled Qiu Yue, Jian Wushuang immediately came to Hall Master Yuan’s cave dwelling. He saw Hall Master Yuan as well as Hall Master Gu Xin.

“Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, what happened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

From the message that Hall Master Yuan sent, he could tell that there must be something major happening in Lineage of Star.

“Jian Wushuang, go through the message in this token,” Hall Master Yuan passed Jian Wushuang a token.

Jian Wushuang took it and briefly skimmed through it. Then, his eyes shot wide open.

The message in the token was a message asking for help.

The message was sent by the one who had been wandering in the Sixth Lair all this while… Lei Chao!

Back then, Lei Chao had guided Jian Wushuang to Lineage of Star personally. He had also taken care of Jian Wushuang when Jian Wushuang wasn’t that powerful.

Lei Chao was asking for help!

“Lei Chao, he is stuck in Buddhist Demon Sea?” Jian Wushuang looked terrified.

He was familiar with the Eight Lair to a certain extent. He knew that there were places that were more dangerous and required more attention in every lair.

Just like the dark regions in the Eighth Lair and the dark ravine in the Seventh Lair. He had looked into them carefully before.

As for the Sixth Lair, he knew quite a bit about it.

In the core of the Sixth Lair, even an expert on Real God ranking list stood the possibility of passing when he wandered there. Besides, there were a few places that were full of danger that a Real God definitely would die in if he barged in. Even to an Almighty, it was dangerous. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Among the few places, the one with the greatest reputation was Buddhist Demon Sea.
