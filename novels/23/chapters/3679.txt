Chapter 3680: Brothers Gather

In the manor of the Wushuang Saint Realm.

Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou were sitting together, drinking and chatting.

“Haha, that’s great. It’s been a long time since we’ve sat together and drank like this.” Wang Yuan kept drinking and laughing.

It had been a long time since he had been so happy.

Ever since Yang Zaixuan died and Jian Wushuang left the Eternal Chaotic World, Wang Yuan could not be happy even if he wanted to.

“It’s all thanks to third brother for reviving me. Third brother, here’s a toast to you.” Yang Zaixuan raised his glass and looked at Jian Wushuang with gratitude.

“There’s no need for us to treat each other as strangers. Just drink.” Jian Wushuang was completely relaxed and drank with his brothers. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The four of them drank happily.

“By the way, third brother, I just heard from you that in ten years, you will open a passage to the Divine Beginning Realm in the Eternal Chaotic World?

“Many top experts in our world, including Wang Yuan and fourth brother, will go to the Divine Beginning Realm?” Yang Zaixuan suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Why? Do you want to go with us?”

Yang Zaixuan frowned slightly, then he shook his head slowly. “Forget about me. I’ve been dead for more than ten million years, and my current strength is still at a very low level. My strength is pitifully weak in the current Green Fire World or the Eternal Chaotic World. If I go to the larger Divine Beginning Realm, I’m afraid I won’t even have room to live. At the very least, I have to break through to the Chaos Realm, which is the Divine Emperor Realm. I’ll go to the Divine Beginning Realm again.”

When Yang Zaixuan died, he had just broken through to become stronger.

Now, tens of millions of years had passed. Although Jian Wushuang had resurrected him from the river of time, he could not change Yang Zaixuan’s strength.

He was still an ordinary Divine Master.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, Divine Masters were everywhere. Even true gods were nothing.

In other words, he still had a long way to go in the Eternal Chaotic World. If he went to the Divine Beginning Realm now, he could, but in the beginning, he had to rely on Jian Wushuang’s protection and care. Otherwise, the risk would be too great.

However, Yang Zaixuan was not the kind of person who would rely on the protection of others, even if he was his brother.

Another thing was that Yang Zaixuan had stayed in the Green Fire World when he was alive. He had not lived for a long time, so he could continue to wander in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Unlike Wang Yuan and Su Rou, they had lived in the Eternal Chaotic World for tens of millions of years and had always been in high positions. They had long been bored here, so they definitely wanted to go to the Divine Beginning Realm.

“In that case, the three of us will wait for you in the Divine Beginning Realm. I believe that with your talent, you will soon reach the Divine Emperor Realm,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang knew Yang Zaixuan’s talent.

In the entire Eternal Chaotic World, he was definitely a top genius. Moreover, he had once obtained an extraordinary opportunity on the ancient battlefield and had a special physique. Under such circumstances…he would definitely make rapid progress when he cultivated in the Green Fire World.

It would not take long for him to become a Divine Emperor.

“Come on, let’s continue drinking.”

The four of them continued to chat.

The four of them drank for three days and three nights before they ended.

After that, Jian Wushuang went to see Emperor Xiao again.

“Uncle Xiao, Shuang ‘er is inside the star-moon agarwood.” Jian Wushuang took out the star-moon agarwood.

Although Emperor Xiao’s strength was only at the Divine Master Realm, he could not sense anything if he did not touch the star-moon agarwood. However, when he touched the star-moon agarwood with his hands…he immediately sensed the sleeping soul inside the star-moon agarwood.

“It’s Shuang ‘er, it’s her!” Emperor Xiao’s body trembled as he asked, “Wushuang, how did Shuang ‘er become like this?”

“I failed to protect her, but don’t worry, Uncle Xiao. It won’t be long before I take back her divine body and wake her up completely,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, I believe you.” Emperor Xiao nodded.

He had absolute trust in Jian Wushuang.

After all, he had watched Jian Wushuang grow step by step, so he knew Jian Wushuang’s character and ability very well.

“In ten years, the passage to the Divine Beginning Realm will be opened. Uncle Xiao, do you want to go to the Divine Beginning Realm with me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“What about Yang Zaixuan? How did he decide?” Emperor Xiao asked.

As Yang Zaixuan’s master, Emperor Xiao wanted to know his disciple’s decision.

“Second brother will continue to stay in the Eternal Chaotic World. He will go to the Divine Beginning Realm when he reaches the Divine Emperor Realm,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, I knew he would choose this.” Emperor Xiao smiled. “This kid is just like that. As long as it’s something he can do through hard work, he will never ask for help from others. He doesn’t want to go to the Divine Beginning Realm now because he doesn’t want to rely on your strength. He wants to test his strength and slowly grow up, just like you did in the past.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Since Yang Zaixuan chose to stay, I’ll stay too. After some time, when my strength grows up with him, we can barely protect ourselves in the Divine Beginning Realm. Then we’ll leave,” Emperor Xiao said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang did not force him.

Time passed quickly.

Countless experts in the Eternal Chaotic World were quietly preparing because of Jian Wushuang’s previous announcement. Once ten years had passed and Jian Wushuang opened the passage to the Divine Beginning Realm, they would leave the Eternal Chaotic World, they would travel to the even more vast Divine Beginning Realm.

In the eighth year...something happened in the Green Fire World.

Although it was not a big event, it still caused some waves.

It originated from Purple Emperor of the Blue Sea Cloud Pavilion. More than 10 years ago, he destroyed a big family, the Ye family, for some benefits. The entire Ye family was uprooted by purple emperor, it was said that all the cultivators in the Ye family were exterminated. Only a ten-year-old boy, Ye Chen, was lucky enough to escape.

It was said that Ye Chen was a trash who was born unable to cultivate. But in the end, it was this trash who obtained a great opportunity from God knows where. Not only did he recover his physique…he also used only a dozen years to break through to the Divine Master Realm. More importantly, he had a set of unparalleled sword techniques.

In that year, Ye Chen, who was at the Divine Master Realm, single-handedly charged into the Green Sea Cloud Pavilion. With just one strike, he had penetrated through the sect-protecting array of the Green Sea Cloud Pavilion. Then, he began a massacre in the Green Sea Cloud Pavilion.
