Chapter 1158: Trap

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“A Secret Land! It’s a Secret Land!”?Golden Axe Holy Master thought with surprise and excitement.

The Green Fire Palace had been built on this battlefield forty million years ago, and the experts of the palace had discovered only three Secret Lands since its foundation.

The three Secret Lands full of Occult had been of great help to the Green Fire Palace.

For instance, Time Secret Land could change the speed of time, and Sword Realm was a big fortune for Sword Principle cultivators.

As for the Jin Kingdom, it had not occupied any Secret Land on this battlefield up til now. It was jealous of what the Green Fire Palace had but it could not do anything except accept this fact. After all, the experts of the Jin Kingdom had migrated to this battlefield much later than those of the Green Fire Palace, and the discovery of a Secret Land relied upon time and opportunity.

Now, Sunrise Sword Emperor claimed that he had found another Secret Land. The three Holy Master were astonished.

“I’m fortunate to enter this Secret Land once. I just stayed inside it for one day, but I had a very great harvest. In my eyes, perhaps its value is less than that of our Time Secret Land, but it is much more valuable than Sword Realm,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said with a smile.

“We Green Fire Palace must think of a plan to hold this amazing Secret Land.

“But now there’s a Restriction around the Secret Land. To occupy this land, we have to break the Restriction. That’s why I invited you here.”

After a pause, Sunrise Sword Emperor continued, “You three are Formation masters. I hope you work together to break this Restriction, and I’ll have your back.

“Besides, this Secret Land is important to us. You must keep this Secret Land to yourselves before we entirely take it. Do you understand me?”

“Yes, Palace Master,” Bai Feng Holy Master and Celestial Master Feng nodded immediately.

Golden Axe Holy Master agreed too. Now the excitement had overwhelmed him.

“Haha, god bless our Jin Kingdom. Sunrise Sword Emperor discovered the fourth Secret Land and asked me to help with breaking the Restriction. Most importantly, only Sunrise Sword Emperor is here…

“The Green Fire Palace has only five Palace Masters in total, and they perform their respective duties. If all of them had flocked here, they would’ve alerted the Jin Kingdom and this place would’ve been exposed soon. That’s why Sunrise Sword Emperor took us here to break the Restriction. In this way, they can hold this Secret Land privately.

“What a perfect plan. However, you’re doomed to fail.

“This Secret Land is bound to be the Jin Kingdom’s property. As for Sunrise Sword Emperor, he’s likely to be the leader of the Green Fire Palace. We have been planning to take his life all this time and now we finally get a perfect opportunity.”

Golden Axe Holy Master thought as a hint of ferocity flashed across his eyes. The next moment, he secretly sent the news to the experts of the Jin Kingdom.

When the high-ranking experts of the Jin Kingdom received the news, they were overjoyed and wasted no time sending experts to the Secret Land.

“Let get started!” Sunrise Sword Emperor ordered.

Golden Axe Holy Master and the other two Holy Masters walked up to the entrance of the Secret Land and began to work on the Restriction, but Golden Axe Holy Master just pretended to do so.

He did not know that the other Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace were keeping a close watch on him.

This place covered by the Restriction was not a Secret Land at all. In fact, it was a trap that the Green Fire Palace had set a long time ago.

At this moment, Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master and Red Lotus gathered in a palace in the center of the Restriction,

They utilized this palace to hide their aura. Meanwhile, they observed what was happening outside the palace.

“If everything goes smoothly, the Jin Kingdom must’ve received the news by now, and their experts will arrive here soon.” Void Temple Master sneered.

“I selected this area on purpose. This place is not far from an Opportunity Land with space wormhole, and that land is under the Jin Kingdom’s control. It’ll take the experts of the Jin Kingdom just a couple of days to reach here,” Red Lotus said in a cold voice.

“We just need to wait here. Once those experts arrive, we’ll give them a big surprise and expose Golden Axe’s identity by the way,” Samsara Temple Master said with a strong Killing Intent.

They had planned to not only reveal Golden Axe’s identity but most importantly give a blow to the Jin Kingdom.

The four Palace Masters would work together to eliminate the experts from the Jin Kingdom when they broke into this trap.

Not to arouse Golden Axe’s suspicion, they had brought Holy Master Bai Feng and Celestial Master Feng here.

The two Holy Masters were ignorant of their plan, but they could be trusted.

They could never be spies of the Jin Kingdom. They were elders who had lived for tens of millions of years and joined the Green Fire Palace long before the Jin Kingdom had moved here.

Several days later, experts of the Jin Kingdom arrived.

What happened next went as the Green Fire Palace had planned.

The experts of the Jin Kingdom broke into the Restriction as they had been told that there was a Secret Land under it. As soon as they entered the place, they were ambushed. As four Palace Master took action together, these experts suffered a great loss.

Jian Wushuang and Tang Emperor were sitting inside a secret chamber of the Green Fire Palace. They were drinking their tea and waiting for the results.

After a while, they received a message from Samsara Temple Master. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“My guess is right. Golden Axe Holy Master is a spy of the Jin Kingdom!” Jian Wushuang stood up, his eyes full of anger.

“I never believe that there’s such a good-tempered man in the world. It’s not surprising that he’s a spy of the Jin Kingdom,” Gu King snorted inside Jian Wushuang’s body.

Tang Emperor took a sip of his tea and said smilingly, “Last time when the four kings of the Jin Kingdom plotted to assassinate you, you managed to kill their Tianying King. Even Red Snow King has been missing since then. No one knew whether he’s still alive. This time, we’ve not only tricked the Jin Kingdom into a trap but also killed one of their Universe Masters and badly hurt another two.”

“Haha, losing two Universe Masters within several decades is a blow even to the Jin Kingdom,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Of course it is. Boy, it’s all your credit,” said Tang Emperor.

“Well…” Jian Wushuang smiled for he did not dare to take this credit.

“Now the four Palace Masters are on their way back. Besides, they haven’t killed Golden Axe. They’ve taken him alive. Do you want to meet him when they come back?” Tang Emperor asked.

“Yes,” replied Jian Wushuang.

With the fury in his eyes, he continued coldly, “A man who concealed his real identity for years pretended to be a good man and made me lose an Original Body. Of course, I have to meet him.”

Tang Emperor furrowed his brows.

The four Palace Masters brought Golden Axe Holy Master back to Green Fire Palace soon.
