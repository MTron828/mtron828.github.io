Chapter 3185: Blood Eagle

——

“You must be Blood Eagle, right?”

Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at the man in a blood-red robe. “I’ve long heard that among the 13 axes, Blood Eagle is the strongest. He’s not much weaker than a real Invincible Saint. Second brother, Violent Bear, is also close to the level of an Invincible Saint. Today, I want to have a good experience. You guys…come at me together!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was full of absolute confidence and shocking boldness.

“Together?” Blood Eagle sneered, “We don’t need to work together to kill you. I’m enough to kill you alone.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

When he came here, he was ready to face the remaining nine leaders of the 13 axes at the same time. He planned to fight against nine of them alone, but he did not expect that Blood Eagle did not seem to plan to work together with his brothers, instead, he wanted to fight against him alone?

Was this not giving him a chance?

“Big brother?” Violet Bear also looked at Blood Eagle in surprise.

“Don’t worry, I know what to do,” Blood Eagle said lightly, but he suddenly glanced at a person beside him and gave him a look.

The person Blood Eagle was looking at was a purple-haired elder, who ranked fourth among the 13 axes. When he saw the look in Blood Eagle’s eyes, the purple-haired elder immediately understood Blood Eagle’s plan, he nodded without changing his expression.

Blood Eagle took a step forward and appeared less than 30 meters in front of Jian Wushuang. A terrifying aura of death began to spread from his body.

“Boy, today I will avenge my four brothers!” Blood Eagle shouted sternly.

“If you want to take revenge, you have to see if you have the strength. If you don’t, all of you here will follow in the footsteps of your four brothers and die.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and said, “Make your move.”

“Humph!”

Blood Eagle snorted and a black axe appeared in his hand. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The black axe was also filled with a strong aura of death. As Blood Eagle raised the axe, it fell straight down.

“Crash!” The whole world suddenly became dead silent.

The air of death was heavy everywhere.

The pitch-black and mighty axe shadow slashed directly at Jian Wushuang. The aura of death contained in the axe shadow was extremely strong.

Under this terrifying aura of death, an ordinary sixth or seventh rank True Saint would probably be trembling in fear. However, this aura of death had no effect on Jian Wushuang at all.

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand. Then, a blood-red bolt of lightning suddenly flashed out.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

Clang!

When the two forces came into contact, the two terrifying forces collided.

Jian Wushuang moved slightly and retreated backward. Blood Eagle also retreated a few steps.

When he stopped, Blood Eagle raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of seriousness.

“No wonder Heavenly Sword Marquis could easily kill sixth brother and eighth brother. His divine power is really powerful. He is only a rank six True Saint, but his divine power seems to be slightly stronger than mine.” Blood Eagle glanced at the giant axe in his hand, the huge black axe was still slightly trembling.

“Boy, die!”

Blood Eagle took another step forward, and the death aura of the huge black axe in his hand suddenly soared.

“Nine axes of demonic arrival!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

One after another, axe shadows that seemed to be able to split the heaven and earth with a strong death aura suddenly slashed out.

Jian Wushuang also came up to him directly. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! The same sword shadow swept out suddenly.

Peerless sword code, Fantasy Sword Nine Heavens!

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

A low sound of impact echoed throughout the void.

Two people in the void in the crazy collision, swinging a huge axe, and the speed of swordplay is incredible so that the surrounding leaders can not see clearly.

After nine consecutive clashing sounds, the two separated again.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void with a sword in one hand and looked at Blood Eagle with a faint smile in his eyes. “Blood Eagle, is that all you’ve got?”

“This kid…” Blood Eagle’s face was gloomy. Previously, when he saw the mirror image of Jian Wushuang killing the Tranquil Cloud King, he thought that he was stronger than Jian Wushuang, but now, when he fought with Jian Wushuang and felt his swordsmanship and strength, he knew that Jian Wushuang was not weaker than him. In fact, Jian Wushuang was slightly stronger than him in terms of strength and power.

“Kid, don’t be complacent. Lend me another axe!”

Blood Eagle’s cold voice echoed in the world. At this time, he raised the giant ax in his hands.

A majestic aura of death began to gather crazily in the axe shadow.

“Is he going to use his strongest move?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with anticipation.

Boom!

The axe, which contained a majestic aura of death, finally swung out.

In an instant, a towering axe shadow covered half of the sky and directly covered Jian Wushuang with a shocking power.

However, when Jian Wushuang saw this axe shadow, he frowned.

“No, this is definitely not his strongest move!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly focused.

At the moment when the baby woman used it, Blood Eagle suddenly let out a low cry, “Fourth brother!”

Around the battlefield, the purple-haired elder who had been prepared by Blood Eagle immediately snorted, and then an invisible force came, in the blink of an eye, it formed a soul spike that could not be seen by the naked eye and directly attacked Jian Wushuang.

“Soul attack?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He finally understood why Blood Eagle wanted to fight him one-on-one.

It was because he was drunk.

“On the surface, he fought me one-on-one, but in fact, he ordered his brother to prepare a soul attack and give me a fatal blow at the critical moment. Blood Eagle is so cunning!” Jian Wushuang cursed in his heart.

“However, even if he suddenly used a soul attack, Blood Eagle could not defeat my divine body with this axe skill alone. He must have prepared other methods.”

Jian Wushuang immediately looked over.

Sure enough, when the purple-haired elder used the soul spike, Blood Eagle also waved his hand. A pitch-black, extremely terrifying black light, which contained a thick aura of death, shot toward Jian Wushuang like a shooting star, it directly shot toward Jian Wushuang.

“The axe skill is just to confuse me. The soul attack is to affect me. This black light is the real killer move!” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.
