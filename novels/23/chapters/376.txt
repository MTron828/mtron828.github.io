Chapter 377: Let’s Compete!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help sighing.

A peerless genius, with unlimited potential, could not improve her strength, and even became weaker, just because of this Witch Poison. No matter who it was, they would not accept this destiny.

“Two years ago, when Miss Lan’er was still the top genius, the Lin family regarded her as a treasure. But in the past two years, her position in the family has become lower and lower. Even the Master slowly became indifferent to her. Not long ago, in order to make a connection with the Luo family, the Lin family even decided to marry Miss Lan’er to Luo Hai,” Lei Yun continued.

“That Luo Hai, however, is a famous playboy, who acts in a tyrannical manner by virtue of his father’s position as the Great Elder of the Luo Family. He is notorious in the entire Iron Saber Territory, and I’ve heard that he already has three wives and nine concubines. It will really be a tragedy if Miss Lan’er has to marry him.”

“Your lady, even if her strength has regressed, is still your Lord’s daughter. Is your Lord willing to marry her to Luo Hai?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“Why wouldn’t he be willing?” Lei Yuan shook his head and smiled bitterly. “Our Master cultivates throughout the year. Most family affairs are decided by the First Madam, who is not Miss Lan’er’s natural mother, so she treats her badly. Lin Yu, the other lady in the Lin family, who is the First Madam’s natural daughter, has always regarded Miss Lan’er as a thorn in her side.”

“That pair of mother and daughter are eager to see Miss Lan’er die.”

“Miss Lan’er was hunted last time, probably because this pair ordered it. Two years ago, Miss Lan’er fell victim to the Witch Poison by a black-robed man. I’m afraid it also had something to do with the mother and daughter.”

When Lei Yun said this, his face became extremely cold.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“It’s no wonder that when I first entered the Lin family, there was something wrong with Lin Zong’s expression. It seems that Lin Zong belongs to the First Madam’s side, doesn’t he??” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, that Lin Zong has followed the lead of the First Madam for a long time,” said Lei Yun, with a heavy nod.

“Anyway, they belong to the same family, and they are even half-sisters. How could she acted so cruelly?” Jian Wushuang asked and sighed.

“Jealousy.” Lei Yun looked up and said,” Miss Lan’er is very talented, so she is seen as the real phoenix among the people. Although Lin Yu has good talent, she is inferior to Miss Lan’er. Since childhood, Lin Yu has been consistently crushed by Miss Lan’er in all aspects. Naturally, she became very jealous.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“In three days, there will be a hunt within the family, after which the Master should formally announce Miss Lan’er’s marriage,” said Lei Yun.

After hearing Lei Yun’s story, Jian Wushuang also secretly felt sorry.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned odd. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Witch Poison?”

“My Heavenly Creation Skill is incredible. It was able to swallow and refine Leng Rushuang’s Icy Heart Poison, which can be called the strongest poison known to man. As for the Witch Poison, could I refine it as well?”

The night was as black as ink.

Inside the huge courtyard, Lin Lan, dressed in a blue robe, was practicing her swordsmanship alone, with a longsword in her hand.

Following the path of her long sword, one bright sword light after another flew out into the dark night. These sword lights were extremely fast and unusually powerful.

Up above the courtyard stood Jian Wushuang, with a longsword on his back, quietly watching Lin Lan, yet the other did not notice his existence at all.

Watching Lin Lan practice her swordsmanship over and over again, Jian Wushuang could feel a sense of stubbornness forming between her eyebrows.

“She a lot like me,” Jian Wushuang murmured softly.

He lost himself while watching Lin Lan.

He could see his past self in Lin Lan.

Many years ago, when he was even younger, he suffered humiliation due to his inability to condense Spiritual Power in the Marquis’ Mansion...

At that time, he was just like Lin Lan. He refused to be belittled or give up. He desperately wanted to condense Spiritual Power. For this goal, he put in countless times more effort than ordinary people. Finally, he succeeded.

Lin Lan’s experience was similar to his, yet it was even more miserable and desperate, but she also refused to give up.

“She’s a good girl. Her talent in Sword Principle is also very good.”?

Jian Wushuang secretly nodded, and then the corners of his mouth slightly warped.

Inside the courtyard, Lin Lan was still practicing her swordsmanship, but at this moment a light voice came from her side, “Practicing alone here is a bit too boring.”

“Eh?” Lin Lan’s face turned solemn. She stopped and looked at the source of the voice, where she immediately found Jian Wushuang.

“Mr. Swordsman.” Lin Lan’s expression became softer.

Jian Wushuang smiled, then waved his hand. He took a branch from the tree beside him, pointed it at Lin Lan, and said, “Your swordsmanship is not bad, how about competing with me?”

“Compete with you?” Lin Lan was stunned. Then she glanced at the branch in Jian Wushuang’s hand, heavily nodded, and said, “Then, please instruct me, Mr. swordsman.”

“Begin!” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Chuu!”

Lin Lan’s body suddenly shot forward like a sharp arrow, followed by a thrilling howling sound, while a cold sword light stabbed towards Jian Wushuang. At the same time, Lin Lan’s Spirit Power reaching its pinnacle, causing the attack to become faster.

“Her swordsmanship is really good, and she has comprehended the Origin. What’s more, is it the World Origin?”?Even though Jian Wushuang was surprised, he slowly swung his branch.

“You lost!”

An indifferent voice was heard!

Lin Lan was shocked and looked at the branch in front of her, it was pointing at her chest.

“This…”

Lin Lan’s reaction speed was extremely fast, so she clearly remembered what happened just now. She had just attacked, but Jian Wushuang easily side-stepped her attack. Then he just stepped forward, drawing closer to her, followed by a stabbing motion.

A simple move, but it was too fast for Lin Lan to dodge!

What was even more marvelous was that Jian Wushuang didn’t use any Spiritual Power, yet he still beat her easily.

“That sword move...” Lin Lan recalled the sword move that Jian Wushuang just displayed.

A very ordinary and simple sword move, but it gave her the feeling that it contained the whole world. It was incomparably abstruse and far beyond her comprehension.

“Your understanding of Sword Principle is not weak either. In addition, your comprehension of World Origin is very high. You could have definitely avoided my attack.” Jian Wushuang threw the branch aside and said lightly, “Unfortunately, you are too discomposed!”

“It should either be because of the experiences over these last two years, or the fact that you will marry Luo Hai as soon as the family hunt ends in three days. But it has made your heart anxious.”

“Mr. Swordsman knows about my past?” Lin Lan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Lei Yun told me.” Jian Wushuang nodded, “As for the Witch Poison, I might be able to resolve it.”
