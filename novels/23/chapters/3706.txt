Chapter 3709: Excitement

North Sea Palace.

As one of the top three forces in the entire Starfield, the North Sea Palace knew about the Red Cloud Mist Tide at Crimson Stone Mountain.

In the Grand Palace, almost all the top experts of the North Sea Palace had arrived. Even those who had been adventuring in the three battlefields had their incarnations gathered here.

The three Rulers of the North Sea Palace were seated at the very top. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It has only been 120 million years since the last time the Red Cloud Mist Tide appeared. It actually appeared again?”

“The time it appeared this time is indeed a bit too early.”

“That’s normal. The Red Cloud Mist Tide didn’t appear at a regular time, and the longest time it appeared was 800 million years ago. This time, it has been 120 million years, which isn’t too short.”“Please reading on >”

The high-level experts of the North Sea Palace were all discussing.

“After the Red Cloud Mist Sea appears, the Red Cloud World should also appear.” A peak level six Principles Master suddenly said.

At the mention of the Red Cloud World, smiles appeared on the faces of the many experts of the North Sea Palace.

Clearly, the reason why they were so excited when they heard that the Red Cloud Mist Sea appeared was because of the Red Cloud World.

At this moment, the Sky Roc Ruler, who was the strongest and had the highest status among the three Rulers, personally spoke out, “After the Red Cloud Sea appears, the Red Cloud World will immediately appear. Every time the Red Cloud World appears, it will be a great opportunity. This time, it will be no exception.”

“Therefore, the experts under the North Sea Palace can make preparations now. In ten days, all of you will follow me to Crimson Stone Mountain. I will personally go to the Red Cloud World this time. Longyuan, you will go with me. As for Xing Kang, you will stay in the North Sea Palace to keep watch.”

......

Sky Roc Ruler glanced at the two Rulers.

Although they were both Rulers, the two clearly followed Sky Roc Ruler’s lead.

“Yes.” Ruler Longyuan and Ruler Xing Kang both nodded.

Ruler Longyuan’s eyes were clearly filled with a hint of excitement. As for Ruler Xing Kang, although he felt a bit regretful, he didn’t complain.

Ruler Xing Kang was the weakest of the three Rulers in terms of power, after all. It made sense for him to stay behind to keep watch. As for the opportunities within the Red Cloud World, Sky Roc Ruler and Ruler Longyuan would have to fight over them.

Ten days later, the people of the North Sea Palace set off.

…

In the vast void of the universe, a triangular gray palace quietly floated there.

In this palace were Elder Dark Bone and Life Fall King.

Although these two had stayed in this palace for a long time, they knew clearly about the major events that had happened in this star field.

The two had immediately learned of the appearance of the Red Cloud Mist Tide at Crimson Stone Mountain.

“The Red Cloud Mist Tide has appeared. It seems that the Red Cloud World will soon see the light of day again.” Elder Dark Bone laughed calmly.

Elder Dark Bone had lived for an incomparably long time. He was someone who had lived in the same era as the Temporal Temple lord. He had experienced the Red Cloud Mist Tide many times, so he naturally knew of it.

“I’ve heard of the Red Cloud World as well. It is said to be a great opportunity. Many Rulers in this region are extremely excited about this opportunity. They definitely won’t miss it.” Life Fall King said.

“I see.” Elder Dark Bone nodded. He then asked, “Life Fall, you are a Ruler Realm expert as well. This time, the Red Cloud World has appeared. Don’t you want to go take a look and try your luck?”

“Of course I want to go. If I miss such an opportunity, who knows how long it will take next time?” Life Fall King smiled. “Elder Dark Bone, what about you?”

“As for me...” Elder Dark Bone pondered for a moment, then smiled. “I have nothing to do these few years anyway. Let’s go take a look.”

“Then let’s go together.” Life Fall King smiled.

Soon, Elder Dark Bone and Life Fall King headed toward Crimson Stone Mountain.

…

The Star Palace was a fairly famous power in this starfield. There were quite a few cultivators in the Star Palace who had been adventuring within Crimson Stone Mountain.

When the dramatic changes occurred within Crimson Stone Mountain, the Star Palace received the news as well.

Upon receiving the news, Daoist Xuan God immediately summoned the many experts of the highest level of the Star Palace.

Within the towering palace, more than ten figures were seated.

These ten figures were all the most powerful experts of the six realms within the starpalace.

“The appearance of the Red Cloud Mist Tide means that the Red Cloud World will immediately reappear in the mortal world. If any of you are interested in the opportunities within the Red Cloud World, you can head to Crimson Stone Mountain as soon as possible and enter the Red Cloud World to search for opportunities. I have only one request for you.” Daoist Xuan God looked downwards.

“When we arrive at the Red Cloud World, you must unite as much as possible so that we can obtain the greatest benefits for our Star Palace.”

“Yes.”

The ten or so Principles Masters nodded solemnly and quickly left.

After these Principles Masters left...buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Four figures appeared around Daoist Xuan God.

They were Jian Wushuang, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, the Temporal Temple Master, and the Heaven Ancestor.

Among them, Jian Wushuang, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and the Temporal Temple Master were all in the Divine Beginning Realm. Only their consciousness avatars appeared here.

“Xuan God, why did you summon us here?” The Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master asked.

Jian Wushuang also looked at Daoist Xuan God.

He was meditating under the Heaven Suppression Tablet in the Eternal Chaotic World when Xuan God suddenly sent him a message, asking him to be aware of it.

Xuan God knew that Jian Wushuang had been cultivating all these years. Under normal circumstances, Xuan God would not disturb him unless there was something important.

“Yes, there is. Three days ago, red clouds covered the sky at Crimson Stone Mountain. As expected, the Red Cloud Mist Tide appeared again,” said Xuan God.

“Red Cloud Mist Tide?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master were stunned when they heard this, and then they were pleasantly surprised.

Only Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

He had not cultivated for a long time, and he did not spend much time in the Universe Battlefield. He had never been to Crimson Stone Mountain, so he did not know many things.

He did not know what the so-called Red Cloud Mist Tide was.

Daoist Xuan God, who was standing beside him, naturally noticed Jian Wushuang’s confusion, he could not help laughing and said, “The Red Cloud Mist Tide is a unique phenomenon in Crimson Stone Mountain. When it appears, the red clouds cover the sky and almost cover the entire Crimson Stone Mountain. The terrifying corrosive power contained in the red clouds is enough to easily kill the Principles Master. Therefore, the Red Cloud Mist Tide is equivalent to a disaster for Crimson Stone Mountain.”

This explanation made Jian Wushuang even more confused.

“Since it’s a disaster, why are you so surprised?” Jian Wushuang asked in puzzlement.
