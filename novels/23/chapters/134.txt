Chapter 135: Attacking and Killing in the Heavy Rain (Part One)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Swoosh... The heavy rain relentlessly poured onto the ground.

At the center of a rift, there was a large courtyard consisting of an inner court and an outer court.

Under the roof of the outer court, many figures in black robes were standing or sitting on the ground. All of them wore masks, in which most of them were copper masks. There was only a small number of silver masks and four gold masks.

There was no sound in the outer court except for the rain. Even the assassins of Blood Feather Tower that gathered there remained quiet.

While behind the gate, right in the front of the courtyard, a silver-masked assassin was standing with folded arms. He raised his head and looked up at the dim void.

“When will the rain stop?” The silver-masked assassin murmured.

Suddenly...

Boom!

The door behind him was blown open and flew straight ahead.

“What the hell?” The silver-masked assassin standing behind the door was the first to be attacked. It was because he was so close to the door that he couldn’t get away from it when it came flying at him.

BANG!

The big and heavy door hit him, which heavily injured him. He instantly spat out blood as he flew back, landing in the center of the courtyard.

“What?”

The whole courtyard stirred. The assassins of Blood Feather Tower stood up as they all looked toward the gate.

A figure, wearing a bamboo hat and straw rain cape, stood at the door with a Long Sword on his back.

Seeing him, all the assassins’ breath turned cold.

“Who is it?” An assassin shouted.

Jian Wushuang ignored him. He walked slowly to the courtyard, one step at a time. Each step was firm and steady as if it contained magic power.

“Buzz...”

The raindrops gathered on the ground and rippled. The waves changed constantly, which made the assassins of Blood Feather Tower feel like the world was disappearing. They could only see the changing waves, the slowly walking Jian Wushuang, and the powerful sword essence radiating from him.

“What’s that?”

“What kind of trick is this?”

All of them were astonished.

They didn’t know that it was just an extreme use of the Sword Essence of Waterdrop.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang stopped and slightly raised his head, showing a bright and handsome face under the bamboo hat. However, his face was cold and his dark eyes were full of killing intent, as if a sharp weapon was aiming towards them.

Whoosh!

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang swiftly arrived in front of the dozens of killers who were closest to him.

Chu! Ice-cold sword light flashed at once.

At first sight, the sword light was more like a single drop of heavy rain.

“What’s this?”

“Waterdrop?”

“Such a big waterdrop?”

Some of the weaker assassins didn’t even react.

“Be careful!”

“Get out of the way!”

The assassins who had reacted shouted at them.

But it was already too late.

Cold sword light flashed and swept past their throats. Regardless of whether they were copper-masked assassins or silver-masked assassins.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! ...

A total of 13 assassins, among whom eight were copper-masked assassins and five were silver-masked assassins, were killed in a split second.

Then, Jian Wushuang swiftly moved again. The cold “waterdrops” swept to five nearby assassins. Five Sword Edges hit five killers at the same time, instantly killing them.

At this point, they finally realized what was happening.

“Damn it. Kill him!”

“Kill!”

There were nearly a hundred assassins in the outer courtyard. Though Jian Wushuang had killed 18 in one breath, there were still many assassins coming to kill Jian Wushuang. Among the approaching crowd, the strongest, the four gold-masked assassins were at the front.

Gold-masked assassins were experts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

At this moment, the four gold-masked assassins closed in on him simultaneously. However, a fierce wind suddenly blew and those falling raindrops swept over the four gold-masked assassins.

All of their eyes were filled with terror, then they all fell at the same time.

The strongest, the four gold-masked assassins, were killed by one movement of his sword.

“How can this be possible?”

“How could four gold-masked assassins be killed with a single move?”

“What’s with this strength?”

Out of the assassins who were still alive in the area, a lot of silver-masked and copper-masked assassins looked at this in shock.

“Gold-masked assassins?”?Jian Wushuang would not spare a glance at them.

He could already kill a gold-masked assassin in one move two years ago. Now his strength was much better than two years ago, so he could obviously kill several gold-masked assassins with a single move now.

“Next, it is your turn.”

Jian Wushuang looked around at those silver-masked and copper-masked assassins. The killing intent in his eyes was more intense.

“Everyone belonging to Blood Feather Tower has to die!”

Chuu!

Jian Wushuang moved again. The terrifying “waterdrops” in the heavy rain could not be seen clearly, and they easily swept over those assassins.

A massacre!

A total massacre!

Even the four strongest gold-masked assassins were killed. The remaining silver-masked and copper-masked assassins had no chance to even defend...

While Jian Wushuang was massacring everyone in the outer courtyard, dozens of figures gathered inside a room of the inner courtyard.

There were eight gold-masked assassins and two purple-masked assassins. Besides them, there was a purple-robed person who didn’t wear a mask, but his status was no lower than the purple-masked assassins. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He was An Ying!

“This time our target is her.”

An Ying opened a scroll. Detailed information on an expert was written on it.

“One of the Upper Elders in Tianyuan Sword Sect, Guu Qinghan.” An Ying’s voice was cold as he continued, “The mole we put in Tianyuan Sword Sect has a high position now, and it is possible for him to take charge of the Tianyuan Sword Sect as the new head of the Tianyuan Sword Sect. However, Guu Qinghan has always gone against him these years. So...”

“She has to die!”

Hearing that, the gold-masked assassins and two purple-masked assassins didn’t change their expressions.

Upper Elders of Tianyuan Sword Sect, though they were supreme experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm, it was not difficult to kill them silently.

“There are many experts in the Tianyuan Sword Sect, several of them have even reached the Yin-Yang Void Realm. It’s impossible to kill her in the Tianyuan Sword Sect, so we have to wait until she comes out of the Tianyuan Sword Sect...”

An Ying and the two purple-masked assassins were discussing how to secretly kill Guu Qinghan.

However, suddenly... they sensed a strong wave of Spiritual Power and heard many death howls from the outer courtyard.
