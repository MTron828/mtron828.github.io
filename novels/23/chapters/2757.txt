Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A humongous Golden Prison also appeared out of thin air and sealed up the entire void.

Both the Golden Light Domain and Prison of Punishment had superimposed!

Rumble~~~

The three Heavenly Blood Alliance experts who frenziedly escaped immediately felt a strong suppression.

Around 20 percent to 30 percent of their power had been directly suppressed with the most crucial point being a huge decrease in their speed.

“This domain...”

“D*mn it!”

“We’re in huge trouble.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Those three’s facial expressions were extremely dark as they immediately tried every means to escape from the domain.

However, they were stuck in the extremely strong Golden Prison and it was almost impossible for them to break the Golden Prison.

Therefore, those three did not even have any opportunities to escape before all five of them—Old Tong, Jue Xin, Old Snake, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu attacked them.

“Leave the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master to me,” said Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin coldly as he directly went after the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master.

The remaining four glanced at each other speechlessly.

Moments later, both Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods were killed by those four people.

As for the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master, he had a heated fight with Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin which resulted in him being completely crushed by Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin from the beginning of the fight.

He was originally not as strong as Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin and could not even use 80 percent of his power as he had been suppressed by the domains, hence he naturally did not have any strength to fight back and soon enough, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin found his opportunity to directly kill him.

“Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, how does it feel to personally kill a High-level Grand Ultimate God?” Jian Wushuang looked toward Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin with interest.

“The Heavenly Blood Alliance is really weak as they were suppressed by the domains. They don’t even qualify for me to take action. What feelings should I have for killing him?” Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin had a cold expression on his face.

Jian Wushuang could not help but smile when he heard that.

He could see that Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin had just become a High-level Grand Ultimate God and that was the reason he rushed to fight against the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master as he wanted to test his strength by going against an opponent. However, the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master was too weak and failed to achieve his requirements.

“Alliance Master Su Han, all three Grand Ultimate Gods, and the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s upper echelons had been wiped out. The remaining Heaven Ultimate Gods had started escaping. I don’t think you need me to chase after them, right?” Old Tong looked over.

The Grand Ultimate Gods present had lofty positions.

It was nothing for them to kill those Grand Ultimate Gods including those part of the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s core. However, they normally would not lower themselves to chasing after ordinary Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“No need for that. Leave the remaining issues to the Divine Sword Army.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “What we need to do now is prepare to withstand the Divine Demon Sect’s wrath.”

Old Tong, Jue Xin, and the others had serious expressions on their faces when they heard that.

Although wiping out the Heavenly Blood Alliance was nothing, was different when it came to the Divine Demon Sect.

“It’s public knowledge that the Heavenly Blood Alliance was secretly supported by the Divine Demon Sect and considered as the Divine Demon Sect’s assistant. Now that the Heavenly Blood Alliance had been wiped out and we’ve killed all three Grand Ultimate Gods, this meant we’ve wiped out the Divine Demon Sect’s support. The Divine Demon Sect will be furious and take revenge against us in a crazed manner,” said Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

“Alliance Master Su Han, are you really sure you can contend against the Divine Demon Sect?” An Ying could not help but look over.

“Sure, how could I dare take action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance if I didn’t have absolute confidence? Won’t that be suicidal?” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at the people around him. “Don’t worry, all of you can leave at any time if we can’t fight against the Divine Demon Sect by then.”

After Jian Wushuang said those words only then did those Grand Ultimate Gods nodded in relief.

“If there aren’t any accidents, the Divine Demon Sect will immediately take action. They might even come at us with all they have and we’ll be waiting for them here.” Jian Wushuang smiled with absolute confidence on his face.

At that very moment in the Divine Demon Sect.

Just as Jian Wushuang anticipated, the Divine Demon Sect was in a wave of rage when they caught the news that the Sword Alliance had taken action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance and killed all three Grand Ultimate Gods including the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master.

“Sword Alliance! What an alliance!!” A middle-aged man in purplish golden armor had a cold expression on his face as he slapped his hand down and turned the throne into powder with his strong divine power. The middle-aged man stood up with a flame of anger burning crazily in his eyes.

The middle-aged man in purplish gold armor was none other than the Sect Master of the Divine Demon Sect, Dong Shen!

As the Divine Demon Sect Master, Dong Shen was also a powerful Peak Grand Ultimate God.

In front of Dong Shen, several figures with a strong aura were standing there. They were the Divine Demon Sect’s pinnacle experts but their expressions were extremely cold at that moment.

“The Sword Alliance dared take action when they knew we supported the Heavenly Blood Alliance! They are so daring that they wiped out the entire alliance!”

“The Heavenly Blood Alliance was built from us spending lots of resources on them. All three Grand Ultimate Gods including the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master originated from our Divine Demon Sect who had always been the Divine Demon Sect’s main strength. It’s a huge loss to us now that they are dead and the Heavenly Blood Alliance has been destroyed. If we don’t do anything after suffering such losses, our Divine Demon Sect will become a joke in the eyes of every force in the Danyang Continent!”

“That’s right! We should directly take action and destroy the entire Sword Alliance. We shall shred Su Han into pieces! We shall not let go of those who were involved, Jue Xin, Strange Old Tong, An Ying, Lan Junzhu, and Old Snake!”

“Kill! Kill! Kill!” Every pinnacle expert of the Divine Demon Sect was filled with killing intent.

The majority of the Divine Demon Sect’s experts in the Divine Demon Sect were personally brought up individually and had an extremely strong sense of belonging toward the Divine Demon Sect. Those experts in the Divine Demon Sect had deep feelings of camaraderie among one another with some were even fellow disciples of the same teacher.

All three Grand Ultimate Gods including the Heavenly Blood Alliance Master that Jian Wushuang and the others killed had many close friends in the Divine Demon Sect.

The Divine Demon Sect Master had an overpowering killing intent surging through his body at that moment.

“Where are Su Han and the others?” Dong Shen asked.

“Based on the news we received, they stayed in the Heavenly Blood City and did not leave. It looks like they are waiting for those from the Sword Alliance to come and take over the Heavenly Blood City,” answered a Grand Ultimate God standing beneath him.
