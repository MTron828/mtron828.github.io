Chapter 2560: Visit from an Old Friend

The Sword World had to be developed within oneself. It was a world that belonged to that individual.

However, what he displayed was merely a forcefully built frame using sword essences. Just like building a house, what good would it do if there was only a wooden outline without bricks and clay to fill it up?

“I’ve been pondering a lot about Sword World, but I’m still missing something that allows me to really develop one. If I keep cultivating as such, I’ll probably need a long time to truly understand and develop a real Sword World. Looks like I’ll need some external help.” Jian Wushuang squinted as he thought of someone.

Dark Thunder Territory’s first-ranked expert—the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor!

The Governor was the first expert Jian Wushuang met who was able to form a complete Sword World. Jian Wushuang deliberately stayed back in the Dark Thunder Territory to fight him just so he could grasp the sense of a Sword World.

Unfortunately, his ability was too weak at that time and he was not a compatible opponent for the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor. Furthermore, he was a bit worried about consequences as it was after all the Eighteen Prefectures’ turf, hence he did not dare stay long and could not get a very good grasp.

However, he was at a bottleneck trying to form Sword World at that moment and he could finally seek the Governor and force him to fight once again.

Perhaps he still could not grasp a complete ideal of the Sword World the second time to form his own, but he had a feeling it would at least help his Sword Principle by quite a bit.

Jian Wushuang broke out of his seclusion with that thought in mind.

“Tiexin, I need to go back to Dark Thunder Territory again. It won’t take long so just stay here in the Northern Darkstar Continent and wait for me,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Aye.” Xiao Tiexin nodded.

Jian Wushuang then set off to the Dark Thunder Territory.

A month later, Jian Wushuang arrived at Dark Thunder Territory’s central area.

It was a place infested with thieves and criminals.

Although the thieves in the Dark Thunder Territory were shocked by the annihilation of Demonic Moon, Heaven Poison, and Underworld Prefectures, they were not in fear.

Dark Thunder Territory was still a paradise for thieves and criminals.

The rest of the 15 prefectures were still the territory’s overlords.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture’s headquarters was located within a titanic mountain and since their governor was the undisputed first-ranked expert in Dark Thunder Territory, they were the strongest prefecture among the Fifteen Prefectures under his leadership.

Countless palace chambers and penthouses were erected on the mountainside. At the mountain peak were a few large halls and the voices of many thieves resonating from within.

A golden-robed young man with a longsword on his back appeared in the void in front of this mountain.

Jian Wushuang looked down at the Infernal Heart Prefecture’s quarters with his arms folded and said, “Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor, your old friend is here.”

His voice resonated—bounced back and forth between mountains—and transmitted into the ears of the thieves at the peak.

The entire prefecture’s quarters was quickly stirred.

“The Governor’s old friend? Who could that be?”

“Who’s here?”

Many figures flew into the void above.

Countless pairs of eyes looked at Jian Wushuang.

“This guy...looks familiar...”

“Golden robe with a longsword on his back? That’s right! The portrait, I’ve seen his portrait!”

“Jian Yi, it’s him! The expert Jian Yi who single-handedly destroyed Demonic Moon, Heaven Poison, and Underworld Prefecture!!!”

Jian Wushuang had enjoyed quite a bit of fame in the Northern Darkstar Continent. All the Fifteen Prefectures had their respective tightly organized intelligence network and they naturally had his portrait as well as knew of his name.

His identity caused a big stir in the entire Infernal Heart Prefecture.

It was understandable, as Jian Yi was the terrifying existence that brought them down to 15 prefectures.

Moreover, he was being pursued by the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor before leaving the Dark Thunder Territory and his return to the prefecture was not a visitation but for revenge.

“Jian Yi, what are you doing in our prefecture’s quarters?”

Someone growled. It was a High-Level Ultimate God’s voice with an extremely strong aura who ranked right below the Governor in the prefecture.

“I’m here to look for the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor and have a gathering for old time’s sake. Why isn’t he at home?” Jian Wushuang scanned the thieves before him and could not see the Governor among them.

The Governor would perhaps have come out to meet him instead of sending a High-Level Ultimate God representative if he was at the quarter.

“Our governor has gone to Green Flame Prefecture not long ago and hasn’t returned yet,” said the High-Level Ultimate God.

“Green Flame Prefecture, huh?” Jian Wushuang answered.

Green Flame Prefecture was the second strongest among the Eighteen Prefectures after Infernal Heart Prefecture who also had a Peak Ultimate God governor.

Jian Wushuang answered, “That’s alright, I’ll wait for him here.”

“Our governor went for a gathering with the Green Flame Prefecture Governor and looks like he’ll stay there for quite a while. It could be up to a year if he’s in the mood. Why don’t you come back again? Or maybe you can go find him at Green Flame Prefecture,” said the High-Level Ultimate God.

“No need, send him a message and ask him to come back right away. Just say that I’ll wait three days for him. If he doesn’t show up in three days, the Infernal Heart Prefecture will cease to exist,” said Jian Wushuang leisurely.

Although he said it leisurely, thieves gasped in fear when they heard his words.

They did not doubt the abilities and audacity of this Jian Yi who was standing before them.

That Jian Yi person was only a Primary-Stage Ultimate God back then, but he annihilated three prefectures in one go.

They had since been hearing his reputation spreading within the Northern Darkstar Continent such that a lot of major clans on the continent could do nothing with some even bowing down to him.

At that moment, the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was not at the prefecture and Jian Yi could easily annihilate them.

“Remember, only three days.” Jian Wushuang reminded him again on purpose before shutting his eyes straight away and quietly waited.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture’s thieves dared not waste any time as they immediately reported the incident to their governor.

The thieves did not lie as their governor was indeed at the Green Flame Prefecture.

When Jian Wushuang appeared at the Infernal Heart Prefecture’s quarters, he was happily eating and drinking with the two governors from Green Flame Prefecture Governor and Mysterious Shade Prefectures.

Right at that moment, his face immediately changed upon receiving a message from his assistant—the High-Level Ultimate God.
