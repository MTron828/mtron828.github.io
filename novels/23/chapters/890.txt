Chapter 891: The Seventh Step

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Shoo!

The scarlet longsword shuttled through the void with terrible strength, and stabbed at the Blood Demon again and again.

As Jian Wushuang became more skilled in controlling the sword formation, he could use it to hack, chop and even swipe, not just simply stabbing.

The longsword was fast and flexible, making it difficult for the Blood Demon to resist.

“So quick!”

“Too quick!”

“Not only fast, but also so flexible.”

The audience cannot stop marveling at the scenes.

“Blood Mountain’s sword formation is indeed formidable. He was not that agiIe the last time we practised. As he became more skilled with the sword formation, his sword control grew more and more flexible. The power of this sword formation has been upgraded to a whole new level.” Zi Dong gasped in admiration.

“His sword formation is impressive. But this alone is not enough to pass the third level.” The woman beside him said.

As expected, the Blood Demon finally erupted completely.

The Blood Demon suddenly waved his saber and rushed forward. Majestic power burst out from the saber and beat off the scarlet longsword over and over again. He quickly approached Jian Wushuang, and was right in front of him in no time.

Swoosh!

The Blood Demon hacked with the saber. So swift and violent, like a thunderbolt in the clear sky.

At such a sight, all the audience sighed pitifully, thinking that Jian Wushuang was about to lose.

After all, the sword formation was his most powerful weapon. With the protection from it, he could fight with the Blood Demon face to face, but once the Blood Demon approached him...

Two hundred years ago, when Jian Wushuang was fighting Zi Dong, he lost tragically because his sword formation was invisible and didn’t work for Zi Dong at all. He was then easily approached and defeated.

Now he was approached by the Blood Demon.

Once close, Jian Wushuang could not use the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. His offensive power would be greatly reduced.

However, these people did not know he was not what he used to be two hundred years ago.

Now his Sword Heart had reached the top of Level Six, and his Divine Yin Thunder had entered the second Level. His body was extraordinarily strong, strong enough to resist the Blood Demon even without the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

When the Blood Demon appeared in front of him and held up the saber, Jian Wushuang immediately waved his Blood Mountain Sword.

Once the Blood Mountain Sword’s ultimate power was triggered, Jian Wushuang instantly performed the fourth move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

Bang!

With a loud noise, a terrible roar shook the entire Black Tower.

After that, Jian Wushuang staggered and dropped back several steps, but his aura remained strong and intact.

“He survived?”

“How could he survive?”

“Did he survive the Blood Demon’s attack without the sword formation?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This...”

The audiences were all stunned.

In terms of attack, he had such a violent, yet nimble sword formation.

In defense, he could resist the Blood Demon from nearby.

Then, this battle...

Just as when everyone was still shocked by what they saw, Jian Wushuang suddenly snorted, and his body split into half in mid-air.

Yes, it is split into two.

“Doppelganger!”

“It is the doppelganger!”

Everyone was shouting under the Black Tower.

Jian Wushuang, who was still in the third level, revealed his two Original Bodies at this moment, his eyes cold and solemn.

The World Body stepped back toward the edge, and the Slaughter Body, with the Blood Mountain Sword and a monstrous aura, directly rushed out toward the Blood Demon.

The World Body controlled the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation and attacked the Blood Demon in a frenzy again and again.

The Slaughter Body performed the swordsmanship and fought with the Blood Demon face to face.

On the battlefield, streams of violent sword light roared out one after another, accompanied by the harsh noise from the six-meter-long scarlet longsword, which was shuttling back and forth in the air.

The two are perfectly matched.

Facing such an attack of two different offensives, the Blood Demon appeared a little confounded and kept moving backward.

At this sight, the audience all stood in amazement.

“Is the Blood Demon suppressed by him?”

“This is the Blood Demon in the third level! The last anchor of the Black Tower. Yet he is suppressed?”

“Too strong. The Blood Mountain is too strong. His Original Body controls the sword formation, while the doppelganger fights. Both are terrible! The Blood Demon cannot withstand the attack from the two.”

“Is the Blood Demon going to lose?”

Countless screaming rang in succession.

Among the crowd, Zi Dong also stared at the image with wide eyes, appearing astonished.

“This Blood Mountain... His strength is beyond the Eternal Realm. I’m sure he is able to fight with a real Dao Master right now.” Zi Dong said in his deep voice.

He did not disguise his words, so the people around him heard and were all shocked.

To fight with a Dao Master?

In the Eternal World, it is a wild wish for people in the Eternal Realm to confront with a Dao Master fair and square!

“Is this the legendary seventh step?” The woman beside Zi Dong murmured.

The seventh step?

The crowd was silenced at the sound of these three words.

Within the Eternal World, there were only six steps in the Eternal Realm.

The Six Steps of the Eternal Realm was divided according to the six levels of the Sword Heart. The top of level six represented the highest level in the Eternal Realm.

However, there was a rumor in the Eternal World, saying that a seventh step existed.

It was said that a long time ago, before the Tang of the Eastern Land was created, there was an extraordinary Eternal Realm in the Eternal World.

This Eternal Realm was able to fight with Dao Master! The entire Eternal World was shocked by his strength.

Just because his power was too strong to go beyond the Eternal Realm, someone defined him as the seventh step of the Eternal Realm.

Only that one person had achieved the supreme seventh step during the entire history of the Eternal World.

In addition, four million years ago, the Star King, who had passed the Level Three test of Star Island and left Stellar Fog Sea, also reached the seventh step.

But this Star King kept a low profile and had little fame in the Eternal World.

Now, the strength Jian Wushuang had revealed exceeded the sixth step and reached the seventh!

This step was enough to confront ordinary Dao Masters!

Moreover, no one knew that Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Realm expert, except the Lord Spirit Sound and Ling Long!

Of course, although he was a Divine Realm expert, he was still an Inverse Cultivator. He couldn’t be judged based on ordinary Realms.

Lord Spirit Sound once said that top experts on this land had a better understanding about Inverse Cultivators.

They regarded Inverse Cultivators as cultivators of a higher level.

Therefore, Inverse Cultivators on the Divine Realm expert Level were actually no different from normal Eternal Realm cultivators.
