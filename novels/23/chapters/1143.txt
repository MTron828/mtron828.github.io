Chapter 1144: Seven Stars Pagoda

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The emergence of a treasure like Seven Stars Pagoda would naturally cause a huge impact on the surrounding environment, especially when Tianhuan King was deliberately enhancing its impact.

As such, Jian Wushuang, who still remained in this region, immediately felt the impact the moment the treasure emerged.

“Wow, that’s impressive. Is it caused by the emergence of a treasure?”??Jian Wushuang thought excitedly, his eyes brightened.

As there were countless treasures that might pop out randomly on this battlefield, he thought that it was not surprising that he could come across some treasures that had just emerged.

“I have to hurry up!” he said to himself and set off.

Several days later, he discovered an aquamarine pagoda which had an aura of dominance.

Standing in front of the pagoda, he exclaimed, “What a strong aura field. Only a Chaos Magic Treasure can have such an aura. Yes, it must be a Chaos Magic Treasure!” Exicitement flickered in his eyes.

“Yes, it’s a Chaos Magic Treasure and the kind with special powers. It’s much more valuable than those Chaos Magic Treasures which can only be used as weapons during a fight,” Gu King observed.

“Wow, such a precious thing emerged, and I happened to be the first one who discovered it. What a coincidence,” said Jian Wushuang, surprisedly. “Did all the experts from the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom happen to wander in the other regions of the battlefield? Am I the only one here in this region right now?”

“Well, probably,” said Gu King. “Jian Wushuang, go enter the pagoda. Maybe you’ll be able to make it recognize you as its owner.”

Before entering the aquamarine pagoda, Jian Wushuang searched it with his Strength of Soul to make sure that everything was alright

The moment he stepped into it, Tianhuan King, Tianying King and Golden Rock King, who were hiding inside the pagoda, revealed sinister smiles on their faces.

“That brat is quite cautious. Fortunately, we chose to hide inside the pagoda. Protected by the pagoda, he’ll never discover us,” said Tianhuan King.

“Jian Wushuang has already been lured into our trap. You can go finish him off right now, Tianhuan King.” Golden Rock King urged.

“Don’t rush. Trust me, this brat won’t be able to come out of the pagoda alive.” Tianhuan King said while smiling confidently. “Look, he has already fallen into my trap…”

Jian Wushuang found himself surrounded by numerous treasures upon entering this pagoda. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He felt as if he had entered a large treasure vault.

He glanced around and saw countless shelves filled with treasures. This place seemed to have just about every treasure he could wish for.

More importantly, these treasures also appeared to be highly valuable.

“It this one… a Chaos Magic Treasure?”?Jian Wushuang thought in disbelief.

“Yes, it is, and it’s not the only Chaos Magic Treasure here. This place has 10 Chaos Magic Treasures.

“And the bracelet over there, its aura field is much stronger than that of a Chaos Magic Treasure. Is it a Chaos Divine Treasure?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the treasures in this large house one by one.

All of them were of high value, which made Jian Wushang feel somewhat overwhelmed.

He continued to look at those treasures and gasped in admiration from now and then. However, he did not look overjoyed, and his eyes were calm and unwavering.

Faced with such a treasure vault filled with priceless treasures, an ordinary person would be extremely excited or ecstatically happy.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang still managed to remain calm.

“Hur Hur, a few Chaos Magic Treasures would be enough, and the Chaos Divine Treasure is really too much. Do you really believe that I’m such a fool? You’re really naive enough to think that you can deceive me with such an illusion.”?With this in mind, Jian Wushuang sneered and then widely opened the red eye between his eyebrows, while diffusing his Strength of Soul.

“Swoosh—” The next moment, the treasure vault shattered and disappeared.

Jian Wushuang found himself standing on a glittering ground; now he was on the bottom floor of Seven Stars Pagoda. When he looked up, he could see all the six floors above himself and a luminous aquamarine pearl at the top of the pagoda.

That pearl was as large as an adult’s head and giving off a strange glow.

Jian Wushuang was standing on the bottom floor with his longsword on his back and a faint smile on his face.

Upon seeing that, Tianhuan King’s pupils constricted. “This brat has seen through the illusion I’ve created in my Seven Stars Pagoda! Well, he’s really something,” said Tianhuan King.

“What happened? Tianhuan King,” Tianying King and Golden Rock King looked at her and asked.

“It’s just a little accident,” Tianhuan King replied plainly. “That brat must’ve mastered some special Secret Skill, which enables him to see through the illusion I created.”

With these words, she cast a glance at the red eye located between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows.

She believed it to be the reason for Jian Wushuang being able to smash the illusion she had created.

“The illusion is gone, but it’s not a big deal. I’ll crush him with a fierce consciousness attack,” said Tianhuan King.

She launched the second round of attacks on Jian Wushuang while looking coldly at him. The luminous aquamarine pearl began to spin and then shot out a beam of aquamarine light at Jian Wushuang.

At the bottom floor of Seven Stars Pagoda, Jian Wushuang quickly noticed that a beam of light was dashing toward him at an amazingly high speed, but he did not dodge, since he knew that it was impossible to escape from the light.

He stayed in the same place until the beam of aquamarine light hit him.

“Boom——!!!”

It turned out to be a formidable consciousness attack.

With great ferocity and destructive powers, this consciousness attack was far more intense than all the previous ones that Jian Wushuang had suffered.

It was strong enough to destroy a person’s consciousness. Even Jian Wushuang himself could not do that. He was only able to use his consciousness attacks to make his target lose his or her mind temporarily.

“Someone wants to annihilate my consciousness with this beam of aquamarine light,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

He snorted, his countenance grew grim, and then he suddenly lifted up his head to stare at the luminous aquamarine pearl.

“What?”

Tianhuan King exclaimed in astonishment.

“I’ve used Seven Stars Pagoda’s powers to launch this consciousness attack. No one below the levels of a Universe Master is able to resist it. However, this brat fended it off. Why?”?Tianhuan King thought in disbelief.

She had thought that it would have been just a piece of cake for her to kill this Jian Wushuang before.

However, now Jian Wushuang was still alive and well even when he was trapped in her Seven Stars Pagoda and had suffered two rounds of attacks from her.

“Humph, I don’t believe it.

“No matter how strong you are, you’re now trapped in my Seven Stars Pagoda and completely under my control. Even if I can’t kill you with a consciousness attack, I can directly crush you with my powers here!”

With this in mind, Tianhuan King groaned and swished her hands.

Suddenly, the entire Seven Stars Pagoda began to shake. Jian Wushuang saw two dreadful forces become solid in the void in front of himself. They looked like two giant hands, and these two hands obviously intended to trap and crumble him.
