Chapter 2765: Almighty Rise

The Divine Demon Sect was definitely in a disadvantageous position when they encountered the Sword Alliance even during their prime. On the contrary, they would be directly struck down.

After that huge battle, the Divine Demon Sect alone had lost six Grand Ultimate Gods and when combined with those three from the Heavenly Blood Alliance that the Sword Alliance killed—they had lost a total of nine Grand Ultimate Gods. It could be said that they suffered a great loss.

They would have to consider themselves fortunate if the Sword Alliance did not continue taking action against the Divine Demon Sect under such circumstances. It was a joke for the Divine Demon Sect to think of retaliating against the Sword Alliance to snatch back the territories that once belonged to the Heavenly Blood Alliance and avenge their fallen experts.

He even understood that if Nanwu Palace Master did not take action in time, the Divine Demon Sect would have lost even more experts.

“Alliance Master Su Han, I’ll make a move first since everything has been resolved,” said Nanwu Palace Master before turning to leave.

Dong Shen and the Divine Demon Sect’s remaining Grand Ultimate Gods had dark expressions on their faces—especially Dong Shen who was glancing at Jian Wushuang and the others coldly. Although he did not speak, Jian Wushuang could spot the torrential grudge in his look.

After a few moments upon Nanwu Palace Master and the others’ departure.

“Everybody, has anybody suffered losses?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Grand Ultimate Gods around him.

Old Tong, Jue Xin, Old Snake, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu looked at each other with smiles on their faces.

“Alliance Master Su Han, there aren’t many people who I admire throughout my entire life but you have my admiration today. The Divine Demon Sect had been dominating the Danyang Continent for so many years and never suffered any losses even during their head-on fights against either the Crimson Stone Fort or Nanwu Palace. However, the Divine Demon Sect had suffered such tremendous losses in the hands of Alliance Master Su Han and lost nine Grand Ultimate Gods. I really admire your abilities,” said Old Tong.

Previously, he had a huge fallout with the Divine Demon Sect, hence he was the happiest upon seeing the Divine Demon Sect suffering great losses.

“Apart from holding such strong suppressing domains, you also had a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets. No wonder the Alliance Master was so confident to go into a head-on fight against the Divine Demon Sect. It turns out you really can go against the Divine Demon Sect.” Jue Xin, An Ying, Lan Junzhu, and the others were happily chit-chatting among themselves.

They were truly quite nervous and worried before their fight with the Divine Demon Sect. It was the Divine Demon Sect who had never been overthrown for years after all.

However, they had never expected they would defeat the Divine Demon Sect head-on with such overwhelming means.

They never even dared to think about it before that moment.

Jian Wushuang only smiled gently when he heard that.

“Alliance Master, I don’t think Dong Shen will just let this go based on his facial expression when he left,” said Old Snake with a deep voice. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang slightly smiled. “I know. Although the Divine Demon Sect is one of the Danyang Continent’s pinnacle forces with quite a stable foundation with many Grand Ultimate Gods, we killed nine of them. How can the Divine Demon Sect put down such a great loss?

“However, the Sword Alliance isn’t afraid of them regardless of the grudges the Divine Demon Sect bears against us. In addition, the losses they suffer this time are so great that it’s enough to affect their foundation and position. The Divine Demon Sect will be struggling after this and might even fall into a position with no hope of making a comeback if they aren’t careful. In the end, there are many forces and experts who lust after the Divine Demon Sect’s position or have grudges against them.”

Jian Wushuang knew clearly that the Divine Demon Sect must have accumulated quite many grudges throughout the years as one of the pinnacle forces.

For example, Old Tong previously had a great grudge against the Divine Demon Sect. There were certainly many experts like Old Tong in the Danyang Continent who had grudges against the Divine Demon Sect.

Despite the many experts’ grudges, the Divine Demon Sect did not suffer any losses to their strength as they had many experts on top of also having Dong Shen personally overlooking matters which was enough to shock everyone.

However, the Divine Demon Sect had lost nine Grand Ultimate Gods all at one once that day. It was not easy to recover from such a great loss.

It was a great opportunity for those experts or forces that held grudges against the Divine Demon Sect to overturn them.

‘It’s a waste we did not completely stop Dong Shen in this battle or the Divine Demon Sect would’ve been done for,’ thought Jian Wushuang to himself.

Dong Shen was the backbone and stabilizing force of the Divine Demon Sect.

Even though the Divine Demon Sect lost a huge number of Grand Ultimate Gods, they were still qualified to be considered as a pinnacle force as long as Dong Shen was still alive.

However, the Divine Demon Sect would be easily overturned if Dong Shen died as they would lack the highest combat power deterrence.

However, Jian Wushuang also understood it was not so easy to kill a Peak Grand Ultimate God—at least he knew that he was unable to do so at the moment.

In the battle just moments ago, he only managed to control the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet to do its best at pestering Dong Shen under the suppressive assistance of the domains.

“It’s normal for the Divine Demon Sect to be unhappy but the appearance of Nanwu Palace Master is beyond my expectation,” said Jian Wushuang with a frown.

He was prepared to face the Divine Demon Sect but did not expect to face Nanwu Palace.

Nanwu Palace Master’s appearance was indeed unexpected.

“Luckily the Nanwu Palace did not directly take action against the Sword Alliance and only asked us to stop to protect the Danyang Continent’s balance. It looks like Nanwu Palace doesn’t want to cause a big stir and place high importance toward the balance of forces in the Danyang Continent.”

Jian Wushuang slightly narrowed his eyes and smirked weirdly. “However, Nanwu Palace Master isn’t aware that even without the Sword Alliance continuing our actions, it’ll be difficult for the Divine Demon Sect to stabilize their current situation based on the losses they suffered. The situation between forces in the Danyang Continent will still enter a chaotic period.

“It isn’t only because the Divine Demon Sect is unable to stabilize their current situation with the losses they suffered, but the most important matter is the strong uprising of the Sword Alliance!!

“The Sword Alliance is having a strong uprising this time and we’ll surely turn the Danyang Continent upside down. The messier the Danyang Continent becomes, the better it is for me!!”

Old Tong, Jue Xin, and the others who stood beside Jian Wushuang glanced at each other.

They did not know Jian Wushuang’s true aim but had their pride as they had promised to fight for the Sword Alliance for a thousand years. They would do their best no matter which forces the Sword Alliance went against during that period.

The Sword Alliance had a great victory in the battle that day as they had wiped out the Divine Demon Sect in a face-to-face battle and killed nine of their Grand Ultimate Gods.

Once that news spread, they believed it would shake the entire Danyang Continent and cause a wave of perilous reaction.

The Sword Alliance’s prestige would reach new heights within a short time!!

Unsurprisingly, it would lead to the birth of a new pinnacle force!
