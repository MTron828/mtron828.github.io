Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Damn it.”

He Ling’s countenance greatly changed. He hastily retreated, giving up the Black Water Lotus.

A large number of horrible attacks lost their target, instantly bombarding the surface of the lake. boom!

The whole Quiet Moon Lake was abruptly shaken. The massive lake water lifted up like a tsunami, generating a water curtain more than several meters tall. The water curtain kept rising, which blocked everyone’s vision.

“Get in.”

“Go!”

A lot of Gold Core warriors with great strength directly rushed into the water curtain without any hesitation, while those Gold Core warriors with weaker strength wavered because they couldn’t see the Black Water Lotus through the huge water curtain.

“Hurry up! Attack! Attack!”

“Even if you can’t see anyone, just attack! Regardless of whether people are hit or not.”

Although a great many Gold Core warriors didn’t rush into the water curtain, they were busy attacking toward the water curtain.

All of the attacks were definitely launched at random without any targets. They didn’t know whether it would hit someone or not. But they didn’t care either way.

If they could not have it, then they would not let those experts in water curtain have it either.

They didn’t even worry about whether or not they would destroy the Black Water Lotus.

After all, the seven seeds were the most valuable. The Black Water Lotus itself was useless. Besides, Black Water Lotus Seeds was less likely to be hit because of their small size. Even if the Black Water Lotus was totally destroyed in the attack, it was unimportant.

Almost a hundred experts rushed into the water curtain, including Jian Wushuang and Su Rou.

They all approached the Black Water Lotus at their fastest speed. Therefore, there were six people closing in on the Black Water Lotus.

Respectively, they were Magic Spear Gu Tao, Ling Mubai, Butcher, Zi Yang, Jian Wushuang, and Su Rou.

Gu Tao stared at the seven Black Water Lotus Seeds with great intensity.

“The Black Water Lotus Seeds belong to me,” Gu Tao directly growled.

“Gu Tao, you are strong. But if you think you can keep all seven Black Water Lotus Seeds by yourself, you’re really looking down on us, ” The coquettish and gracious lady said in a cold tone.

“Hum. How dare you bastards compete with me? Get out!” Gu Tao thundered. The blood-red spear in his hand released a great amount of power as it was instantly thrust out.

The blood-red spear flickered out like a viper sticking out its tongue.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

He instantly pierced five times at the same time, piercing towards the five people near him. What’s more, he did it at an amazingly fast speed.

When seeing the bloody spear shadow piercing toward them, Ling Mubai, Butcher, and Zi Yang immediately blocked it without any hesitation. However, after the power of the bloody spear shadow exploded, their expressions changed color and they instantly retreated several steps.

The blood-red spear also pierced toward Jian Wushuang and Su Rou.

“This move, ” Jian Wushuang suddenly felt shocked and said, “It would be enough to pass the Ninth Level of the Dragon Gate.”

At that moment, Jian Wushuang immediately became serious, wielding his Triple-kill Sword with powerful Sword Essence of Earth.

Clang!

When the Sword Edge clashed with the blood-red spear, Jian Wushuang used his power to directly knock back the blood-red spear.

Once the long spear was knocked back, Gu Tao’s offensive disintegrated. He was unable to pierce toward Su Rou with the fifth move.

“Huh?” Gu Tao raised his head, looking at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

Although it was not his strongest strike, the blood-red spear was strong enough to hold back three experts of the Earthly Dragon List like Ling Mubai. However, this obscure person in the Initial Gold Core Realm withstood it?

Not only did Jian Wushuang succeed in withstanding it, he instantly pierced toward Gu Tao’s throat with the flash of a cold sword light.

It was so fast that Gu Tao’s face couldn’t help changing color. He immediately stepped back.

Gu Tao was forced back by Jian Wushuang, while Ling Mubai and other two men were forced back by Gu Tao. Now, Jian Wushuang felt delighted because he and Su Rou were the closest to Black Water Lotus. However, before he could pick up the Black Water Lotus, he found that a massive attack was heading towards them.

“Shit.” After noticing it, Jian Wushuang’s face changed color.

All these attacks, launched by Warriors in the Gold Core Realm who were staying outside the water curtain, were driftless and random. However, the direction of all attacks pointed to where the Black Water Lotus was.

Under normal circumstance, Jian Wushuang could easily avoid those attacks. But right now, he could not retreat.

He knew that the Black Water Lotus was behind him!

In order to get the Black Lotus Seeds, those ordinary warriors could destroy Black Lotus because they did not care about the lotus itself. But Jian Wushuang could not let it happen.

What Su Rou wanted was Black Water Lotus itself.

“Fourth Sister, take the Black Water Lotus and leave this to me,” Jian Wushuang said with a growl.

“Okay,” Su Rou replied without hesitation. She knew that she wasn’t allowed to hesitate in this situation.

Seeing the massive attack heading towards them, a sharp light quickly flashed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Then, a powerful Sword Essence of Earth was released.

“Reincarnation Sword Skill.”

Swoosh!

Sword shadows slashed out in rapid succession. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

When massive attacks were about to land…

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

A succession of impacts sounded out with hardly any pause. Although every attack wasn’t very strong, the number of attacks was too great. Jian Wushuang had to make perfect use of the Reincarnation Sword Skill, trying his best to withstand them.

Fortunately, he had perfect control of the Reincarnation Sword Skill. When wielding this Sword Skill, he created a rainbow sword flash which seemed to be a barrier of sword essence to keep out of all the attacks.

Finally, Jian Wushuang was merely forced to step back several meters by the impact force.

“Well, those people can’t clearly see what is in the water curtain. They are just randomly attacking, so I can withstand them. Otherwise…” Jian Wushuang rejoiced and looked toward Su Rou.

At that time, Su Rou had been reaching out to pick up the Black Water Lotus.

“Stop!” Gu Tao thundered with rage in his eyes.

“Leave the Black Lotus Seeds!”

Ling Mubai, Tu Xin, Zi Yang, and many other experts in the Gold Core Realm were very frightened and angry.

Although they were raging, they couldn’t stop Su Rou from such a long distance.

Su Rou was going to successfully pluck the Black Water Lotus.

Suddenly…

A cold sword light directly chopped toward Su Rou.

The blade flash was ice-cold and dazzling, with overwhelming power. Where it passed, there was nothing.

When the ice-cold blade flash appeared, many experts in the water curtain greatly changed color and became panicky.

Even experts of the Earthly Dragon List like Gu Tao and Ling Mubai were flustered and filled with dread. Their pupils suddenly shrunk while looking at the incoming blade light.
