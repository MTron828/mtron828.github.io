Chapter 1265: Jian Wushuang’s Disappointment!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was surprised by the elder’s lack of strength; on the other hand, the elder had a look of total disbelief on his face.

“How could this happen?”

“I’ve passed the God Test only recently and even though it was not long enough to enable me to transform all my powers into Divine Power, I should still be much more powerful than ordinary Universe Masters. How could this kid overpower me?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The elder stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Kid, go to hell!”

The elder turned into a flowing stream of light and charged directly at Jian Wushuang. This time, he exerted all his transformed Divine Power to the extreme and displayed a unique skill with his black saber.

Woosh!

A black shadow in the shape of a saber which covered half of the void, appeared and slashed at Jian Wushuang.

The saber shadow had not reached Jian Wushuang yet, but its powerful saber essence could be felt as it swept over the area.

When he saw the saber shadow, Jian Wushuang frowned.

This was because, in his eyes, this strike was too weak.

“It’s indeed a unique move, but its lacking in power.”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes were icy.?“A Universe God who has just passed the God Test and whose power has just started to transform into Divine Power. Even his unique skill is weak.”

JJian Wushuang secretly shook his head, wanting to end the fight quickly.

Whoosh!

His Sword Essence shot into the air, filled with a dazzling light of hope and life.

He struck out with his sword, using all his power and might.

He displayed his unique skill—Nirvana.

Boom!

The terrifying sword light immediately reduced the saber shadow to pieces. It continued to flash and engulfed the elder totally.

“Impossible!”

The elder let out a desperate scream before he was overwhelmed by the sword light and was killed.

The Universe God who had terrified everyone who was present; even Lin Dong and Mo You were trying to escape from him, had just been killed by Jian Wushuang.

Silence!

The entire Red Water City was in utter silence.

The people who were fighting all over the city paused and watched incredulously at the scene before their eyes

The Young Master of Red Water Alliance, Gu Nan, was stunned.

After killing the elder, Jian Wushuang paused for a moment in the void. He frowned as he gazed at the elder’s fragmented body and had a serious expression on his face. He roared silently in his mind.

“Weak!

“Too weak!

…”I just exerted the power of the first step of the Blood-killing Plate Armor and managed to kill him so easily. I still have so many skills to display and I did not even use the power of the second step of the Blood-killing Armor…

“This Universe God turned out to be a disappointing opponent.”

Disappointing!

When he first encountered the elder, Jian Wushuang had hoped that the elder would be the first person who could bring out his best fighting ability after he came to the Eternal Chaotic World.

However… he was disappointed at the elder’s power or lack of it.

Even the monarch of Jin Kingdom could have killed the elder without any effort, let alone Jian Wushuang, who was the one who had killed the monarch.

“Few Universe Gods in the Eternal Chaotic World are as weak as this elder. Given that a whole lot of power is required to pass the God Test, weak as the elder was, he must have had someone help him to pass it.” Gu King’s voice suddenly echoed in his mind.

“Had someone help him? “Can a person help another to pass the God Test?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Of course, in the case of some small God Test, but a price must be paid. Don’t think about it, Jian Wushuang. As an Inverse Cultivator, you can only rely on yourself to pass your Inverse Cultivation Test,” said Gu King.

For a moment, Jian Wushuang was speechless

What the king said was true.

The black-robed elder was very lucky. It was Gu Nan’s father, the master of Red Water Alliance, who had helped him pass the Universe God.

In return, the elder had stood by the alliance when it was in danger. He had supported Gu Nan, out of his gratitude and loyalty to the master.

Unfortunately, he had encountered Jian Wushuang.

As a result, he was dead!

…

Jian Wushuang thought it a pity that the elder was not a worthwhile opponent, but what happened had happened.

Next…

“The Young Master of Red Water Alliance.” Jian Wushuang looked at Gu Nan with an imperceptible smile.

“This, this…”

At that moment, Gu Nan was frightened out of his wits. He stood there for some time, unable to utter a single word.

His plan was to let the elder kill the three Divine Generals after drawing them into the city. He could not believe that it had failed and that his last supporter, Elder Li, had also been killed.

A Universe Master killing the elder on his own?

It must be a joke!

Without a word, Jian Wushuang drew closer to Gu Nan in an instant.

An icy sword light flashed in the air as a Soul Attack broke into Gu Nan’s consciousness.

Gu Nan immediately felt dazed, but before he could react, Jian Wushuang’s sword pierced through his head.

The deaths of Elder Li and Gu Nan, especially the way Jian Wushuang had killed the elder, shattered the confidence of the remaining experts of Red Water Alliance so greatly that the Seventh Army did not meet much resistance from them. They were all slain in a short while.

Lin Dong and Mo You, who had fled from the city, returned to the void above the city and came up to Jian Wushuang.

“Jian… Jian Wushuang.”

Lin Dong and Mo You stared at Jian Wushuang in amazement.

At first when they ran away from the elder and failed to get Jian Wushuang to join them, they had thought he was too arrogant and proud. However, now, Jian Wushuang had killed that elder.

A Universe Master killing a Universe God?

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would never have believed it.

“What’s the matter with you two?” Jian Wushuang looked at Lin Dong and Mo You with a smile.

The two of them remained in deep shock for some time.

Lin Dong finally spoke after a long while. “Jian Wushuang, you killed a Universe God!”
