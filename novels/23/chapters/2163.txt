Chapter 2164 Final Battle!

At the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, the three thousand-odd experts held red elixirs in their hands.The pill was given to them by Kaiser Blood. Each of them had one.

Kaiser Blood had only mentioned that it would be effective during the upcoming battle but did not describe the exact effects.

As the battle was about to begin, they hesitated as Kaiser Blood commanded them to consume the elixir.

“What are you waiting for? Consume it now!” A low roar came from Demon King Chen Yu, along with a terrifying aura.

The Three Emperors World’s experts froze.

They were not sure what the elixir would do exactly, but some consumed the elixir immediately out of worship and trust of the Three Emperors.

The rest followed.

Even the twenty-odd Great Emperors consumed the elixirs one by one.

Seeing this, Kaiser Blood and Demon King Chen Yu smiled with satisfaction.

Hong!

An unprecedented roar could be heard.

The surrounding array around the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds was extremely solid. Even a Third Stage Great Emperor would have difficulty bringing it down.

But now, there were more than four thousand Eternal Chaotic World experts attacking at the same time.

Even without an attack superposition formation, a simple attack was already extremely formidable.

After two waves, the array was about to collapse. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Immediately, the third wave of attacks began!

Peng!

The array finally fell apart.

“Charge!” Emperor Bai’s grand voice echoed.

“Charge!”

“Charge!” The Eternal Chaotic World experts charged in like bees.

The three thousand-odd Three Emperors World experts that had just consumed the elixir charged out as well under the leadership of the Great Emperors.

There were a total of seven thousand-odd Almighties in the battle, of which more than fifty of them were Great Emperors.

They had collided head-on in the blink of an eye.

The final battle that determined the life and death of each other’s worlds had finally broken out!

“Haha, die!”

Abysmal Saint Master had morphed into a dark beast, his boundless darkness covered nearly one-fifth of the battlefield. The endless darkness formed several sharp spikes and pierced almost ten experts, killing them instantly.

At the final battle, Abysmal Saint Master and the other Great Emperors no longer cared for their statuses and used their full power. They killed everyone in their way, regardless of if they were Sir Gods, Emperor Gods, or Great Emperors.

The same was true of the Three Emperors World Great Emperor experts.

Those Great Emperors tended to stick together on the battlefield.

Not long after the Abysmal Saint Master charged into the battlefield, a beast-like bald man appeared in front of him. It was one of the Second Stage Great Emperors of the Three Emperors World – Ling Zong.

“You?” Abysmal Saint Master’s eyes were fixated on Ling Zong and smiled coldly. “When I first saw you, I was only but a First Stage Great Emperor. Now, I have reached the Second Stage, let’s see how’ll you handle me!”

After saying that, Abysmal Saint Master made his move.

Suddenly, he was engaged in fierce combat with Ling Zong.

On other battlefields, Underworld God, Red Dragon King, King Chen Xing, Black Dragon Emperor and other Second Stage Great Emperors, along with many First Stage Eternal Chaotic World Great Emperors, were engaged in similar combat with the enemy Great Emperors.

For the ordinary Sir Gods and Emperor Gods, their battle was even fiercer.

“Prepare the Heaven Piercing Arrows!” Ancestor Tian Chen suddenly issued the order.

Three ballistae appeared at the edge of the battlefields, along with ten-odd Almighties to load the arrows.

In an instant, the three Heaven Piercing Arrows were launched.

At an incredible speed, the arrows struck three Three Emperors World Great Emperors.

Two Great Emperors were destroyed immediately. The other Great Emperor was left severely injured.

“Activate the Star God Puppets!”

“Prepare the Dragon Imprisoning Formation!”

With Ancestor Tian Chen’s command, the Eternal Chaotic World’s trump cards were all used with the purpose of striking the Three Emperors World where it would hurt the most.

Of course, the Three Emperors World forces had their own set of trump cards.

They simply had no time to prepare during the previous battle.

Now was different.

“Blood Bone Dragon, go!”

Howl!

Howl!

Howl!

Howl!

A chain of ear-shattering roars could be heard from afar. Ten gigantic crimson dragons appeared, but only their exoskeletons could be seen.

Then ten gigantic crimson dragons each had a strong aura and had the fighting power of a great emperor.

There were ten dragons there.

“Destruction Divine Weapon, go!”

Hong!

There were three loud bangs on the battlefield, and three behemoths descended from above.

The three behemoths were in full black. They were human in black armour holding black spears. They were extremely large, and thousands of feet tall.

An aura so strong it could destroy the heavens exuded from the trio.

The Destruction Divine Weapon was a weapon from the Ancient Era.

Although the three divine weapons were of a low level, they minimally needed an Early Stage Chaotic Realm expert to control it.

Once controlled, the three Destruction Divine Weapons possessed the Second Stage Great Emperor powers, therefore able to counter Jian Wushuang!

Blood Bone Dragon, Destruction Divine Weapon… The Three Emperors World were throwing out their trump cards as well.

In fact, they had had more trump cards, but they had lost them at the previous battle. They were no longer able to retrieve them from the Imperial City.

The decisive battle was fought intensely for days.

The entire Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds was in ruin.

Even the Ancient Blood Tribe’s territory was affected.

The aura released by many experts had already reached the Ancient Blood Tribe’s grounds.

Fortunately, most of the tribe under the Ancient Blood Emperor’s lead were brought to the edge of the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds, so they were not involved in that dark war.

“The internal battles of humans can get really intense.”

Ancient Blood Emperor stood there, sensing the aura and might that came from the battlefield. Even he was taken aback.
