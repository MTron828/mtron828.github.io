Chapter 2745: Finally Killed

The effects of the pill had started to fade away half an hour later with the aura on Saber Master’s body starting to weaken crazily.

“Su Han! Su Han!!” Saber Master stared at Jian Wushuang as his heart was filled with unprecedented unwillingness.

He was unwilling to die in such a way but had indeed reached his limits.

He wanted to escape into the surrounding dark void or out of the area but was not given the chance to do so. Jian Wushuang was so much faster than him and had easily stopped him.

There was no way for him to escape as his strength started to crazily fade away. The pill’s side effects had even started to show.

“Saber Master, didn’t you ask me to fight you head-on just now? I will now fulfill your wishes.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

The 10,000-foot-tall Golden Emperor Shadow exploded in a brilliant golden light behind him.

Jian Wushuang made the huge Golden God Shadow wave both its hands with his thoughts.

Those two golden hands expanded at a shocking speed without limits until they covered the sky and the sun. One of the palms was enough to cover half the world while both palms were able to completely cover the surrounding void.

Both palms slowly closed in toward the void Saber Master was located.

“Punishment, Divine Destruction!!!” Jian Wushuang also shouted out.

The terrifying power came exploding from both palms of the Golden Emperor Shadow.

At the moment the palms slowly closed up, the void Saber Master was located had been completely imprisoned.

Although Saber Master had reached his limit, he had not given up as the Purple Clock once again appeared engulfing his body’s outer layer.

The Purple Clock was originally a strong defensive treasure but needed a period of time to reconsolidate its energy when the protective barrier formed by the Purple Clock was previously defeated by the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. The protection barrier of the Purple Clock had recovered during the period Jian Wushuang and Saber Master was fighting furiously.

However, the Purple Clock’s appearance only enabled Saber Master to be alive for a short moment under the current circumstances.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The noise of divine power’s crazy impact and extrusion could be heard throughout Heaven and Earth.

The skill Divine Destruction was extremely powerful under Jian Wushuang’s full force when he used it.

The horrendous divine power suppression directly crushed the Purple Clock’s barrier but the golden divine power had also been completely used up.

Jian Wushuang simply skimmed forward and arrived beside Saber Master with his Blood Mountain Sword sliding past Saber Master’s neck.

Saber Master was unable to withstand the attack as his head was sent flying outward.

Saber Master’s mouth was still open even though his head had already been sent flying. “Su Han, who knew you’ll be the one still smiling in the end.”

Hum!

Saber Master was completely dead.

In the dark void, the beautiful scroll painting world disappeared with a wave of Jian Wushuang’s hand as a strand of flowing light returned to his body. Jian Wushuang then looked down at Saber Master’s body with a cold expression on his face as a hint of shrewdness surged from his eyes.

‘Saber Master was really strong and a top-tier existence among High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. Apart from that, he had two precious items—the Holy Treasure and Purple Clock—a combination of offensive and defensive with him and would’ve still been invincible had he not bump into Peak Grand Ultimate Gods. Unfortunately... He’s really unlucky!’

‘He was first plotted by Devilish Wind King before bumping into me after being badly wounded by Devilish Wind King’s Gold-armored Corpse Puppet.’ Jian Wushuang secretly sighed.

Jian Wushuang’s total strength had increased by leaps and folds after 30 years of concentrated training under the assistance of both Fengtian Scrolls.

His realm had also been improved along with his soaring divine power. He was not any weaker compared to Saber Master at his peak when coupled together with all sorts of means he was capable of if he gave his all. However, he was also not that much stronger.

Jian Wushuang might not be able to kill Saber Master were they to carry out a face-to-face fight.

However, Saber Master was really unlucky as he was plotted by Devilish Wind King, allowing Jian Wushuang the opportunity to defeat him.

Only Jian Wushuang was left alive among the six Grand Ultimate Gods who came into this secret realm with Saber Master’s death.

‘Oh yes, the treasures once belonged to them...’ Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly lit up.

The six of them—apart from Yi Shen who died in the cemetery and lost all his items—the precious treasures that belonged to the others were in that dark void.

The death of Saber Master, Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Devilish Wind King obviously meant that the precious treasures once belonging to the four of them naturally became his.

For example, the Holy Treasure Battle Saber and Purple Clock that once belonged to Saber Master...

The bronze mirror that once belonged to Long Xianzi.

The Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure defensive armor Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen wore and his two remaining Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets—since two were destroyed.

In addition, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and Silver-armored Corpse Puppet that Devilish Wind King previously controlled also stood intact in the void.

The most important item was the Interspatial Ring—the last blessing Old Gu provided. It originally belonged to Saber Master but all of those things belonged to him from that moment on.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang was already standing in the void with two steps and kept the stagnant Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppet into his Interspatial Ring.

Those corpse puppets were non-living items like war puppets and could be stored in the Interspatial Ring.

Saber Master’s Interspatial Ring and the precious items he was carrying were also taken by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt extremely excited after finishing everything but did not have time to calculate his gains yet.

Suddenly... Hum!

A figure appeared beside Jian Wushuang without any warnings.

The person had on a gray robe and was the spirit of the secret realm, Old Gu.

“Young man, you have really good means.” Old Gu had a devilish smile on his face as he looked at Jian Wushuang as though he could see through Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you for your praises, Old Gu.” Jian Wushuang seemed extremely humble but was secretly alert.

Jian Wushuang was extremely fearful toward Old Gu.

His fear was not only because Old Gu was the secret realm’s spirit of the secret realm who had absolute means and strength in the secret realm.

The most important matter was Old Gu’s weird behavior which seemed like he wanted them to personally search for the Interspatial Ring when he took it out and threw it into the dark void. However, his true motive was to pit the five of them against each other to snatch the ring. In addition, Old Gu said he would only give them three hours but he previously did not appear even though the three hours deadline had long passed. On the contrary, Old Gu only appeared after their fight for the ring had concluded with him being the only survivor.

He was taking their fight purely as his entertainment.

In addition, Jian Wushuang was worried because he used some means to kill Saber Master just moments ago and had even used The Stately Painting.

The Stately Painting was one of Seven Stars Black Sect’s Pinnacle Premier Treasure. Although ordinary experts could not recognize it, Old Gu’s master was a strong Law Lord who might recognize The Stately Painting.

Would Old Gu not take action against him if he recognized it?
