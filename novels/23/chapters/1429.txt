Then, there were another hundred treasures up for auction before it ended.

In the secret room.

“Mister, this is your Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.”

The elderly in a purple robe, Tian Shi, sent the scroll painting to Jian Wushuang, “Mister, the blood that you needed, Star Pavilion has prepared them. You can come and collect them tomorrow.”

“Very good,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. He was delighted.

He could finally complete the first volume of Xuan Mie Golden Body and possess a divine body of a Real God after he got the blood.

With the aid of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation, his power could definitely be improved to another level before the Ultimate Disciple Task.

Just then, Tian Shi suddenly moved and smiled, “Mister, I have just received news. There will be a battle on the battlefield of Snake Soul City. If you have time, you can come and take a look.”

“Whose battle?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Two Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. One of them is Lin Xue, an extremely famous Universe God in the Third Heaven on Star land. She’s also one of the most outstanding disciples among disciples who are Universe God in the Third Heaven from Dark Phoenix Pavilion. Hou Yi, who she is challenging, isn’t famous. He seems to have popped out from nowhere. However, he is very powerful. He defeated Lin Xue’s junior with just two slashes of his axe,” Tian Shi said.

“Dark Phoenix Pavilion, Lin Xue?” Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows.

He had dealt with Dark Phoenix Pavilion before and he had also fought a few geniuses there before. But he had only visited Dark Phoenix Pavilion as Universe God in the Second Heaven back then. Hence, he had only fought the disciples who were Universe Gods in the Second Heaven from Dark Phoenix Pavilion. As for disciples who were Universe God in the Third Heaven, he didn’t know them.

However, judging by geniuses like Qiu Ling and Liu Shaer who had fought with him, the disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven from Dark Phoenix Pavilion were outstanding. They were all true geniuses.

A battle among geniuses. Jian Wushuang was, of course, interested.

“Let’s go and take a look,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Under the guidance of Tian Shi, Jian Wushuang came to the biggest battlefield in Snake Soul City.

The battlefield then was crowded. There were many cultivators in the city who were attracted by the battle.

Jian Wushuang and Tian Shi found a seat and sat. They were looking at the two figures who had appeared on the battlefield.

Among the two of them, the beautiful lady in a snow-white robe should be Lin Xue who was a Universe God in the Third Heaven from Dark Phoenix Pavilion.

The one who stood opposite was a purple-haired young man in a crimson robe and he looked cold. The purple-haired young man was carrying an axe on his back.

“That’s Hou Yi. He wasn’t famous at all previously, but the moment he appeared, he defeated a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven easily,” Tian Shi said.

During the fight, Jian Wushuang watched attentively.

Vroom!

There was a strong force of Sword intention that flurried. There was suddenly snow falling on the battlefield. The snowflakes gathered and formed a huge snow dragon at one end.

The snow dragon was terrifying.

Then, Hou Yi slammed his axe. The moment the axe was revealed, the sky changed color and it was extremely imposing.

“These two…”

Jian Wushuang squinted the moment the two of them started the fight.

“Real God unique skills. The two of them created Real God unique skills!”Jian Wushuang exclaimed in silence.

Unique skills. Above rank three Strongest Unique Skill was Real God unique skill. Real God unique skill was similar to Universe God unique skill and there were a few levels to it.

Then, although Lin Xue and Hou Yi were only performing an ordinary Real God unique skill, it was much stronger than a Universe God unique skill.

“They created a Real God unique skill. They live up to their reputation,” Jian Wushuang complimented.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The two of them on the battlefield were becoming white-hot.

In terms of power, the two of them were obviously evenly matched. Their battle was naturally ferocious.

Just then… Rumble! A terrifying aura soared up from Lin Xue.

“Lin Xue is going to use her trump card!”

“After all, as the core disciple of Dark Phoenix Pavilion, she, of course, has a trump card.”

“Hou Yi is going to be in trouble.”

On the battlefields, everyone was in discussion.

Just as everyone thought Hou Yi was going to lose.

Wow!!

Something eye-catching suddenly appeared and Hou Yi took out two axes and wielded them crazily. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“My God.”

“This Axe Principle…”

“Such a terrifying Axe Principle!”

Everyone was shocked at Hou Yi’s Axe Principle. Even Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“It’s so strong! The Axe Principle is so strong!” Jian Wushuang’s hands were tightly clenched.

He knew clearly that his Sword Principle was far behind Hou Yi’s Axe Principle.

Too amazing. Although he had only created Real God unique skill, his understand of Axe Principle was beyond everyone’s imagination.

After the shocking Axe Principle, although Lin Xue gave full play to her trump card, she couldn’t resist and lost very quickly.

“You lost!”

Hou Yi held a huge axe with both of his hands as he looked at Lin Xue with soaring murderous intention.

Lin Xue clenched her teeth, obviously unhappy with the result.

“Don’t be upset with the result. You made me play the double axes trick and you did well. You could be considered the top among Universe Gods in the Third Heaven in Dark Phoenix Pavilion.” Hou Yi sounded cold, “I’ve made a deal with Leng Jun that we will have a fight ten years later. Until I defeat him, you’ll understand that it isn’t shameful to lose to me.”

Hou Yi didn’t lower his voice when he spoke. The people on the battlefield could hear him clearly.

Suddenly, it stirred a commotion.

“Leng Jun?”

“Did he say Leng Jun just now?”

“The super genius who is famous in Purple Moon Sanctuary, the expert on Universe God ranking list, Leng Jun?”

Countless cultivators were astonished.

“You wanted to challenge the Universe God ranking list?

“Of course,” Hou Yi tightly gripped his hands as his eyes twinkled with joy.

Then, Lin Xue didn’t look unhappy anymore.

She knew that the person before her had the guts to challenge the Universe God ranking list. He definitely had absolute power to support him. His power naturally could easily defeat her.

After the battle, Hou Yi and Lin Xue left, one after another.

The battlefield was still in astonishment.

In one of the corners of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang sat side by side with Tian Shi.

“The Universe God ranking list!”

There was light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as he muttered.

He came to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries for eight hundred years so he sort of knew bits and pieces about the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

He naturally knew about the Universe God ranking list and Real God ranking list that was spread through the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.
