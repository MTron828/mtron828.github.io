Chapter 1901: Bear Patiently

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In Star Land, the forces continued to roll on dramatically.

However, the war had temporarily stopped.

Outside Universe Galaxy, there were four figures standing there.

The four of them were only Real Gods. They were originally under the command of Lineage of Star but as Star Extermination Alliance had wiped out Star Land, the four Real Gods had turned and fought against Lineage of Star without hesitation. Then, the four Real Gods were standing in front of Lineage of Star as they were humiliated.

“Haha, men from Lineage of Star are a bunch of ostriches. Do you intend to hide in there forever?”

“Sword Emperor, Jian Wushuang, I admired you before, but from what it seems now, you are only a coward. After losing the Master of Star Palace attending garrison duty, Lineage of Star didn’t even have dignity. If I were to be the Master of Star Palace, I would die again from anger in hell.”

“Doomed. Lineage of Star is really doomed.”

“Hehe, I never expected Lineage of Star would fall to such a level. I am only a Real God and you cowards from Lineage of Star don’t have anyone who dares to fight a battle with me? Sword Emperor, didn’t the outside world call you the number one genius in Eternal Chaotic World? I am here to challenge you today, do you dare to accept the challenge?”

“Haha, Sword Emperor is terrified. He didn’t have the guts to fight with you.”

The four Sir Gods laughed heartily. Under the intentional spread via divine power, their voices reverberated in the sky.

In the galaxy formation, Hall Master Yuan pulled some tricks to prevent the sounds from outside the galaxy to travel in. The four Real Gods’ humiliating speech wasn’t heard by any experts from Lineage of Star.

However, the experts from Lineage of Star felt aggrieved.

Although they couldn’t hear what the four Real Gods said, they could guess what they said through their lip movements. Hence, they were naturally angry.

Plus, if Star Extermination Alliance were to send Almighties to taunt them, it’d be fine. They had sent four Real Gods instead.

Real Gods… To the Almighties in Lineage of Star, they were only nonentities.

Normally, they wouldn’t even care about them.

But then, the four Real Gods were blocking the galaxy as they pointed and ridiculed.

Who wasn’t aggrieved? Who wasn’t angry?”

“A bunch of b*stards. I really want to head out to kill those four small potatoes!!!” Hall Master Nie Yun’s face was red and there was rage in his eyes.

“Don’t act on impulse,” Hall Master Yuan waved and squinted his eyes when he said, “Star Extermination is trying to make us angry. Once our experts head out, we will be granting their wish.”

“Bear with them for a bit. Don’t forget about Palace Master’s plan,” Hall Master Gu Xin looked too.

“Of course I know that. I just feel aggrieved,” Hall Master Nie Yun said unhappily.

“Aggrieved? Who isn’t?” Hall Master Gu Xin rolled his eyes at Hall Master Nie Yun, “No matter how aggrieved we feel, it isn’t time for us to attack yet. Bear with it for a little longer. Palace Master said before that we have to suffer for a while. But in no time, we will be able to make them sorry!”

“Mm, I believe in Palace Master,” Hall Master Nie Yun nodded heavily, “Oh yeah, where is Palace Master?”

“He is cultivating in seclusion. If it isn’t anything important, don’t disturb him,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“At such a crucial moment, he still has the mood to cultivate in seclusion?” Hall Master Nie Yun rolled his eyes.

Jian Wushuang was really cultivating in seclusion.

After they had fought with Star Extermination Alliance and returned to the galaxy, he had gone to cultivate in seclusion immediately.

On Sword Star, in a secret room.

Jian Wushuang was sitting alone but his eyes were filled with excitement.

“Almost there, almost there!”

“In no time, I can master this. By then, I will have another extremely powerful trump card!”

“Once I master this trump card, Lineage of Star’s winning chance will definitely heighten tremendously!”

Jian Wushuang was extremely excited.

The reason why he would tell Hall Master Yuan to activate the galaxy formation and urge the experts from Lineage of Star to stay within galaxy formation, and not rise to any challenge.

Firstly, was to show the first feather, in order to create an opportunity for the final battle that was going to take place later on.

Secondly, was to give himself more time to master the trump card.

“Very soon. It won’t take long,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Time flew past.

In the blink of an eye, two hundred and fifty years had passed.

In the two hundred and fifty years, Star Extermination Alliance never once gave up on humiliating Lineage of Star.

Every day, there would be someone cursing before the galaxy. As for the experts who were good at formations, they had been looking for ways to break the galaxy formation, but there was not much progress.

As for power superposition skill, there was no news at all.

Star Extermination Alliance couldn’t do anything about it as well but they could only continue to besiege them.

The forces and experts in Eternal Chaotic World had been paying attention to Lineage of Star for the past two hundred and fifty years. Although there wasn’t much movement in these years, their gazes had never redirected. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

They also wanted to know just how long Lineage of Star could hold back for.

Besides, in the peaceful two hundred and fifty years, there had been two major incidents. Another two alliances had formed.

Lineage of Star had too many enemies.

Especially back when the Master of Star Palace had massacred wantonly, he had offended many forces and experts.

Then, as the Master of Star Palace, those who eyed Lineage of Star weren’t just Abysmal Palace, but also Soaring Heaven King Palace, Divine King Island, Real Martial Art Divine Church and Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion.

Star Extermination Alliance, formed by five forces, was merely the first that took action. Lineage of Star had many enemies. Their speed wasn’t as fast as Star Extermination Alliance but their hatred of Lineage of Star wasn’t weaker than the five forces’.

As Star Extermination Alliance and Lineage of Star were in a stalemate situation, the forces and experts took action one after another. First, they intended to join Star Extermination Alliance and work together so the possibility of destroying Lineage of Star would be higher.

However, they wanted to join but Star Extermination wasn’t willing to accept them.

One should know that Star Extermination Alliance had gathered five top major forces. Their team formation was strong. When they fought with Lineage of Star, they had already displayed the difference in power between both parties.

Five forces working together in Star Extermination Alliance was enough. They didn’t need to accept other forces and experts.

The five forces weren’t willing to share the benefits that they were going to reap after they destroyed Lineage of Star.

Hence, any forces and experts who wanted to join Star Extermination Alliance were rejected by Star Extermination Alliance.

They had no choice but to quickly form a new alliance with other forces and experts who harbored deep-seated resentment with Lineage of Star. The alliance had a total of ten major forces, hence the name Supreme Ten Alliance.
