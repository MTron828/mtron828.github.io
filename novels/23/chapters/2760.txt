Chapter 2761: Counting On You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Su Han, go to hell!”

Dong Shen’s eyes glow with murderous intent.

Boom!

Dong Shen’s killing intent exploded alongside his terrifying aura as he charged forward at Jian Wushuang.

His power violently shook the void that he went past.

He passed through the center of the battlefield to the other side. The two parties that were fighting fiercely retreated to the side in horror. Even the strongest fighter of all— Strange Old Tong— was extremely terrified of Dong Shen. Strange Old Tong saw Dong Shen skim past and he dared not to stop it.

Dong Shen was not hindered in any way so he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in just a blink of an eye.

Dong Shen knew very well that Jian Wushuang was the Sword Alliance Leader and the mastermind of the event. Strange Old Tong, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin and the others were only taking orders from him. Even the corpse puppets were under Jian Wushuang’s control. Dong Shen believed that as long as he defeated and killed Jian Wushuang, the nasty situation could be resolved easily.

However, when Dong Shen waved the giant axe in his hand to halve Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang responded with a wave.

Buzz!

A dazzling stream of golden light lit up. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A tall and burly figure emerged instantly. The tall and burly figure was holding a battle saber, he emanated a shocking wave of aura as his sword thrust forward for a brutal slash. The battle saber collided with Dong Shen’s giant axe.

Boom!

The tall and burly figure was thrash far away and Dong Shen too was slightly shaken up by the momentum. He regained his footing after staggered three steps back.

Dong Shen raised his head to check out who the opponent was after he stabilized himself.

“Is that a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet?” Dong Shen’s eyes shrank sharply in astonishment.

The experts from the two camps that were engaged in a brawl around the battlefield were in a state of frenzy.

“That’s a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. It turned out to be a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet!”

“Oh gosh, not only is he controlling a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets, but he is also controlling a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet!”

“A Gold-armored Corpse Puppet is equivalent to the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God!”

The experts from both camps were amazed.

Peak Grand Ultimate Gods were scarce in Danyang Continent. Each of the top forces had only one whereby Crimson Stone Fort had Yin Su’er and Yun Shan.

Who would have thought Jian Wushuang, a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God would have a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet at his beck and call?

The experts finally knew why Jian Wushuang had so much confidence and that he dared to make an onslaught upon Divine Demon Sect.

“You have a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet?” Dong Shen stared wide-eyed at Jian Wushuang.

“Dong Shen, do you think I’m a fool? If I don’t have any confidence in battling against you, I would never launch an attack on Divine Demon Sect. I got the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet by chance a while ago. He happens to have reached the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God, so I shall let him be your opponent.” Jian Wushuang sneered and immediately commanded the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet next to him, “Kill him!”

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet did not hesitate. He instantly turned into a golden stream of light and attacked Dong Shen.

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet perfectly displayed the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God.

Dong Shen’s expression was cold, his body rose and his breath of aura soared to a whole new level. Initially, he only had a giant axe in one of his hands but then, a giant axe appeared in his other hand.

Each of his hands holding a giant axe, his combat power climbed to its limit.

“Attack!”

Dong Shen bellowed and strode out for a strike.

An overwhelming gush of divine aura dispersed in the void and fought fiercely with the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet.

The fierce battle only took a moment and the two sides only collided several times.

Swoosh!

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was smashed miserably. Then again, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet had a tough corpse puppet figure. Though its divine body was smashed, it did not suffer much damage. The message was clear though that the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was no match for Dong Shen.

“Haha, you think a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet can compete with me head-on? What a joke!”

Dong Shen laughed arrogantly, his breath of aura was horrifying. He was violent like a peerless brutish beast.

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet had no wisdom and after pulling himself up to his feet, he launched another attack on Dong Shen. It did not take long before he was smashed again.

“The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was just a corpse puppet indeed. Although he has the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God and he knows how to use some of the techniques he practiced during his lifetime, his true combat power is only average among the Peak Grand Ultimate Gods. Whereas, Dong Shen... he has been a Peak Grand Ultimate God for years. His divine power, techniques, and even his treasures and divine weapons are above the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. I’m not surprised that the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet is not his match.”

Jian Wushuang squinted slightly while his gaze traveled around the battlefield.

Dong Shen was temporarily occupied by the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and he could not extend help to his people. The Sword Alliance had an absolute advantage over the fight between the rest of the Grand Ultimate Gods, but it did not seem to be a huge advantage. The Sword Alliance’s Grand Ultimate Gods faced difficulties to nab a chance to kill several of the Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods.

The situation would be nasty for Sword Alliance when Dong Shen defeated the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and joined the rest of the battle. The situation could in fact be very awful for Sword Alliance.

“It seems that I have to help them out.”

Jian Wushuang murmured as he roused the Seven Stars Secret Technique.

As soon as the Seven Stars Secret Technique was performed, his realm moved up by another level and his divine power soared.

Buzz...

An immense amount of golden divine power began to condense behind him, and in the blink of an eye, a Golden Emperor who was 10,000 feet tall had appeared behind him.

The Golden Emperor was extremely domineering, he stood tall and overlooked everything in the world down below. He was terrorizing.

At the same time, on the surface of his body, a layer of dark golden armor slowly emerged.

Seven Stars Secret Technique, Divine God of Punishment and Nine Sparkle Star Armor had been performed at the same time, Jian Wushuang’s combat power had risen to its limit.

However, he did not immediately make a move. Instead, he flipped his hand and took out a bronze mirror.

The bronze mirror was the Golden Feather Phantom Mirror.

Jian Wushuang was using his mind to control, buzz... A large amount of golden light instantly diffused and covered the entire battlefield in front of him in a jiffy.

In addition, the surging golden divine power ocean swept frantically, and on Jian Wushuang’s dark golden armor over his body, a domain formed.

A sky-shattering sword intent was produced when his 100,000 miles of Perfect Sword World came into place.

Golden light domain, Prison of Punishment, Star Armor Domain, Sword World... the four domain oppression methods had been put to use all at one go.

Jian Wushuang stood right at the core of the golden divine power while the Golden Emperor behind him overlooked everything in the world.

Then, Jian Wushuang slowly stretched out his palm and pumped his fist at the void ahead.

“Four domain oppression methods superimposed. Oppression!”
