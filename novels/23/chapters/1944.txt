1945 Taking In A Disciple

Without Almighties, the remaining experts from Holocaust Sect and Soul Snatching Palace naturally had no space to struggle when they were fighting against Jian Wushuang and his troop.

In a short while, the entire Soul Snatching Palace was exterminated. Only some extremely weak disciples managed to escape.

In the vast void.

“Your name is Luo Tianhong, right?” Duan Lingfeng’s gaze was cold as he stared at the purple-haired young man in front of him.

“Yes,” Luo Tianhong nodded solemnly as his eyes filled with enthusiasm.

“I arranged an opponent for you. If you can defeat him, I will take you in as a registered disciple. However, if you can’t kill your opponent, you can only blame yourself. I will not help you,’ Duan Lingfeng said coldly.

“Registered disciple?” Luo Tianhong licked his lips. He had already seen Duan Lingdeng’s power. Although he wasn’t as scary as Jian Wushuang, he was still a superb existence that made him passionate.

To be able to be formally apprenticed to a superb existence, even though he was just a registered disciple, it was worthy for Luo Tianhong to fight for it.

“He is my opponent?” Luo Tianhong looked at the brawny man in front of him.

The brawny man’s face was like a grave, covered in hopelessness. However, the aura he carried reached the level of a peak Void Real God.

A Universe God had to fight with a top Void Real God and had to kill him, that was quite challenging.

However, for a true top genius, it was doable.

Forget about the others, at least Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng could do that when they were Universe Gods.

“Listen up,” Duan Lingfeng looked at the brawny man, “I’ll give you a string of hope. Fight with your all. As long as you can kill your opponent, you can live. If not, die!”

The brawny man from Soul Snatching Palace originally felt hopeless. However, when he heard what Duan Lingfeng had said, his eyes glowed.

He stared at Luo Tianhong and an unprecedented murderous intention and hope of life soared.

The power that a person had during his final crucial moment was the scariest.

“Let’s begin,” Duan Lingfeng said coldly.

The two of them immediately fought in the void.

One of them wanted to be formally apprenticed to Duan Lingfeng.

The other merely wanted to survive.

Both exploded their strongest fighting power.

At the border of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng stood side by side.

“To have this young man fight with a top Void Real God and the match will be called with life and death. Only you could think of such an idea,” Jian Wushuang said.

“He wants to be my disciple. How could it be so simple? Plus, the opponent that I assigned to him is evenly matched after all. It couldn’t be considered as unfair,” Duan Lingfeng said coldly.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows but didn’t say much.

After all, it was Duan Lingfeng picking his disciple, not him.

In the void, the battle between a Universe God and a Real God lasted for very long.

Both parties have firm beliefs and were extremely mad in the fight. In the end, it became a competition of will power and endurance.

Finally, the outcome of the match was out.

The one who survived until the end was Luo Tianhong!

He stood in the void as his figure quivered. He was covered in blood and his face was pale but his eyes were shimmering with joy. In front of him was the dead body of the brawny man.

“I won!” Luo Tianhong was excited. The blood in his body was boiling too.

“The battle could be considered as a transformation to this young man,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly as he watched.

“Not too shabby,” Duan Lingfeng nodded faintly.

Luo Tianhong defeated his opponent. According to what Duan Lingfeng had said earlier, he had taken him in as his registered disciple.

Then, Luo Tianhong left with Duan Lingfeng.

As for Jian Wushuang and his troop, they left Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo as well.

On their way out, Jian Wushuang sent a message to Purple Moon Emperor and informed him about the ins and outs. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jian Wushuang didn’t intend to hide anything but he kept the relationship between himself and the Holocaust Sect Master, Leng Ruxue, a secret.

“It seems that the news that Sanctuary Alliance got isn’t false,” Purple Moon Emperor exclaimed, “Not long ago, although Holocaust Sect Master united Holocaust Sect using thunderous measures, there are still many within Holocaust Sect that aren’t willing to follow their Sect Master’s command. They are considered betrayers. Holocaust Sect has been wiping out these traitors all this while.”

“As for the seventh Palace Master, Sanctuary Alliance knew about him. Previously, Holocaust Sect held great power and an eminent position. It’s a pity that he wasn’t on the same side with Holocaust Sect Master. Hence, after Holocaust Sect Master attacked, he brought a bunch of experts and fled. At the same time, he seemed to have brought along some treasures that Holocaust Sect collected.”

“It’s a pity that these treasures didn’t fall into your hands but were taken away by Holocaust Sect Master.”

Jian Wushuang clearly understood when he heard that.

“Jian Wushuang, Eternal Chaotic World isn’t peaceful. Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace are preparing to launch an attack. I reckon it wouldn’t be long until they make a big movement again. Before that, you have to focus on cultivation and seize the time to break through and become an Almighty. You are an inverse cultivator. As soon as you become an Almighty, you will be compared to a Great Emperor favorably. By then, you can be one of the highest fighting powers of Sanctuary Alliance.”

“This is the most important task for you now,” Purple Moon Emperor said.

“Mm, I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He also knew what was most important to him then.

To step foot on the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, breakthrough and become an Almighty should be the most important task on hand.

“Return to Green Fire World. The spiritual power is the most intense there. I will get the best result if I cultivate there,” Jian Wushuang decided.

An ancient silver spaceship immediately flew in the direction of Green Fire World.

They passed through some spacetime wormholes along the way. Jian Wushuang then arrived at Green Fire World in no time.

Jian Wushuang had only left Green Fire World for a few thousand years.

But in the few thousand years, there had been a drastic change in Green Fire World.

Firstly, the spiritual influence of heaven and earth.

A few thousand years ago, before Jian Wushuang left, the spiritual influence of heaven and earth in Green Fire World already far beyond Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Then… after a few thousand years of evolution, the spiritual influence of heaven and earth in Green Fire World and the overall cultivation environment was at least tens of times stronger than Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries!

It was merely a conservative estimation that Jian Wushuang did.

Jian Wushuang even thought the cultivation environment in Green Fire World could compare favorably with the first era.

Even though there was a distance, it wasn’t big.

In such an outstanding cultivation environment, Green Fire World’s cultivators naturally improved rather quickly under Jian Wushuang’s guidance.

Then, the number of Universe Gods in Green Fire World had more than tens of thousands of people. There was even more than ten Real Gods.
