Chapter 3668: Wushuang City Lord

Looking at the two figures rolling out from the shattered void, the green-haired old man was completely stunned.

He did not recognize one of the two figures, but he was very familiar with the other person. That was his backer, the Purple Emperor that he had just mentioned!

And the aura emitted by the person whom he did not recognize was even stronger than the Purple Emperor. This instantly made the green-haired old man guess that that person was most likely the Purple Emperor’s master, the Magic Water Emperor!

The two people whom he had mentioned earlier were obviously deliberately brought out. In the blink of an eye, they had appeared in front of him. Moreover, these two people had clearly been captured and brought here.

“Where is this place?”

“Master, you are here too? What on Earth is going on?”

The Purple Emperor and the Magic Water Emperor, who had rolled out from the shattered void, were currently in a daze.

They did not know what had happened at all. They only knew that they were originally fine when a large hand suddenly grabbed them. Following that, the two of them appeared here, it was obvious that they were very far from where they had been before.

They had broken through the void and caught them from a very far place. Such a method was enough to shock the Purple Emperor and the Magic Water Emperor.

“I, the Great Ruler, was caught here without any resistance. This is unbelievable. Even the most powerful expert in the Eternal Chaotic World, Lord White Emperor, could not do this. Who is it? Who is it?”

Magic Water Emperor immediately looked around.

Soon, he saw Jian Wushuang, who was on the ground, and Jian Nantian.

When he saw Jian Nantian, Magic Water Emperor’s pupils constricted.

As one of the Rulers of the Green Fire World, Jian Nantian was also a superior Ruler, so Magic Water Emperor knew him.

Magic Water Emperor was a little respectful toward Jian Nantian, but he was only respectful. He was not too afraid. Moreover, he knew Jian Nantian’s strength more or less. He was much stronger than him, but compared to the White Emperor…he might be slightly weaker, so it was impossible for him to catch Jian Nantian in an instant.

Then he saw Jian Wushuang.

When he saw Jian Wushuang, Magic Water Emperor immediately frowned.

At first, he felt that Jian Wushuang looked familiar, but he could not remember when he had seen him. Although Jian Wushuang did not emit any aura, he looked like an ordinary person at first glance, however, it was this ordinary feeling that made Magic Water Emperor’s heart heavy.

“My name is Jian Wushuang, you may have heard of it,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“Jian Wushuang?” Magic Water Emperor’s expression changed, but then he turned pale with fright, ‘Jian Wushuang’? Thousands of years ago, the leader of the Eternal Chaotic World was equal to, or even better than, the White Emperor, Sword Ruler Wushuang? “The Savior of the Eternal Chaotic World, the creator of the unparalleled Saint Realm in the Green Fire World, and the Wushuang City Governor?”

“Sword Ruler Wushuang? Savior? City Governor Wushuang?” Jian Wushuang smiled. “When did I get so many titles?”

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s admission, Magic Water Emperor could not help but take a deep breath.

He was, after all, an expert at the level of an Ruler. As one of the top experts of the Eternal Chaotic World, he was well aware of some things that happened tens of millions of years ago. Tens of millions of years ago, the Eternal Chaotic World once fell into a desperate situation, in that desperate situation, a genius expert named Jian Wushuang had turned the tide and helped the Eternal Chaotic World tide over the crisis.

Jian Wushuang was also called the savior of the Eternal Chaotic World by the later generations of cultivators. Now, tens of thousands of years had passed, and his name had long become a legend and a myth, however, many cultivators who had been left behind tens of thousands of years ago still remembered this super existence.

Therefore, when Magic Water’s eldest brother learned that the person in front of him was the legendary Jian Wushuang, he was shocked beyond words.

In addition to shock, Magic Water Emperor was also shocked!

He knew that since the person in front of him was the legendary castellan wushuang, he must have caught him and brought him here. If nothing had happened to such a super existence…why would he forcefully catch him and bring him here for no reason? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Magic Water and his disciple, Zi Tian, pay their respects to Jian Wushuang. I wonder, castellan, what can I do for you?

“As long as we can help you, we will not refuse.” Magic Water Emperor looked extremely respectful.

Beside Magic Water Emperor, Purple Emperor did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Although he did not know much about Jian Wushuang’s name, he knew from the terrifying strength that Jian Wushuang had just displayed and the respectful look on his master’s face that the person in front of him…was not someone they could afford to provoke.

“Magic Water Emperor, I have no enmity with you and your disciple. However, just now, this person said that he was ordered by your disciple, Purple Emperor, to kill everyone in this town, including my parents. After I stepped in to stop him, he even brought your names out to threaten me. What do you think I should do?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was calm.

Although Jian Wushuang did not show any anger or killing intent, his words were like a bolt from the blue in the ears of Magic Water Emperor and Purple Emperor.

“You want to kill the parents of City Governor Wushuang?” Magic Water Emperor felt a little dizzy.

“Idiots, these damn idiots!” Purple Emperor roared and looked at the green-haired elder and the others with killing intent.

He wanted the green-haired elder and the others to go after Ye Chen and ordered them to kill everyone who was related to Ye Chen, but he did not ask them to provoke Jian Wushuang.

He also wanted to kill Jian Wushuang’s parents? This was a big joke.

In fact, the green-haired elder and the others were innocent. They did follow Purple Emperor’s orders, but they did not expect that there were a few big Buddhas hidden in the town that they could not afford to offend.

They wanted to cry but had no tears.

At this moment, the Magic Water Emperor spoke again, “City Lord, don’t worry. I will definitely give you a satisfactory explanation.”

“Really? Then I’ll wait.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Magic Water Emperor’s eyes turned cold, but in the next moment, he attacked as fast as lightning.

He naturally did not dare to attack Jian Wushuang, including the residents of the town. At this moment, he was dealing with the green-haired elder and nearly a hundred True Saints.
