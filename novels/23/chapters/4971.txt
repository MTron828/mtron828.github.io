4974 Chaotic Origin Sealess Domain

After learning that the so-called Chaos Origin Sealess Fruit was born in a place called Sealess Domain, Yan Fan became very interested.

After getting the real address of the Sealess Domain, he hurriedly took Jian Wushuang and prepared to go to the Sealess Domain.

“Remember, the Sealess Domain is a little strange. When I brought my disciple in, I was almost trapped. However, with the two of you Sword Immortals as my guarantor, there should be no major problems.”

Cang Ting’s gaze was solemn as he instructed.

Yan Fan waved his hand. “Got it. I’ll definitely be careful.”

Just as he was about to leave this Gui Yue Immortal Palace, a figure suddenly ran out of the palace, his expression nervous and determined.

Looking at the figure that was about to leave, the young man in black said in a clear voice, “May I ask your name? I want to remember it and fight you again in the future!”

Jian Wushuang stopped where he was and the corners of his mouth curled up. “Jian Wushuang.”

The three figures were like stars flowing in the sky. They came and left in a hurry, and in the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the boundless Endless Sea.

“Jian Wushuang… I’ll remember it,” the black-robed youth murmured. His gaze was firm.

Cang Ting put away his disappointed expression and looked at his disciple, his pride revealed without any concealment.

“My disciples aren’t any worse. I really want to see how far they’ll grow!’

At this moment, the hazy moonlight that could not be looked at directly on the body of the Vast Moon Immortal Lord was gone, and there was a sense of loneliness. Her thoughts seemed to have returned to the ancient times.

Sometimes, endless lifespan was not necessarily a good thing for the Yan Immortal. After experiencing countless ancient wars and the void, they began to think about the ultimate meaning of their existence.

…

There had been no news about Di Qing since he left the Gui Yue Immortal Palace. Although it had only been a short time, Jian Wushuang became even more worried.

One had to know that the longer the timeline was, the greater the possibility of finding Di Qing.

This was because the entire Boundless Ocean had no boundaries and was almost equivalent to a universe. The difficulty of finding a Grand Yan Immortal in such a universe filled with fatal dangers could be imagined.

Originally, Jian Wushuang wanted to continue searching for Di Qing aimlessly, but Yan Fan led him directly to the Sealess Domain.

“Good disciple, just follow us. I spent a lot of money to get this information from that old brat Cang Ting. I guarantee that you will become a Grand Yan Immortal after eating that Chaos Origin Sealess Fruit!”

Jian Wushuang felt helpless as he looked at Yan Fan, who was beaming with joy and excitement.

From the Yan Immortal stage to the Grand Yan Immortal stage, it was an extremely difficult and almost impossible task.

How could there be some kind of fruit that contained great fate energy that could have such an unimaginable heaven-defying effect?

One had to know that even Emperor Liu Ya’s imperial treasures did not have such a supreme treasure.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang did not have much hope and confidence.

“Sealess Domain, there’s actually a place in the Endless Sea that isn’t a sea area. Could it be that this old brat is fooling me again?”

As he continued to move forward, Yan Fan began to doubt the true location that Cang Ting had given him.

“Of course,” Jiang Li said. “You have to know that there is something in the Endless Sea that won’t sink into the sea and won’t be devoured by any Yan power.”

“You mean the corpse of the Yan Immortal?” Yan Fan touched his chin. “If that’s the case, then the Chaos Origin Sealess Fruit might really be born in that place. ”

“What kind of name is that?” Jiang Li pouted. “What a weird name!”

Yan Fan touched his nose. “I think it’s quite weird too, but as long as I can advance to the Grand Yan Immortal stage, it’ll be a good outcome!”

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly when he heard that. He knew his own situation the best. He had long realized that without the Immortal Source, it was almost impossible for him to reach the Grand Yan Immortal stage.

This was also the reason why he was unable to advance to the Grand Yan Immortal stage even though he was extremely proficient in using the Immortal Style and had comprehended the strongest sword technique.

Without the Immortal Source, Jian Wushuang’s path of advancement was completely blocked.

However, he still held onto the last glimmer of hope. If the Chaos Origin Sealess Fruit could really allow him to ascend to the Grand Yan Immortal stage, he would be able to easily crush a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal!

Therefore, he was looking forward to it.

With two true sword immortals following them, they traveled 10,000 miles in an instant. They traveled at a speed that could cross an entire Heavenly Region in a few breaths.

Even so, it still took a long time to reach the Sealess Domain.

When the endless black sea area was replaced by a gray-white land plane, even Jian Wushuang could not help but be surprised.

What formed the grayish-white land plane was a mess of bones!

The endless skeletons were shrouded in a unique desolate and deathly aura that made one’s heart palpitate involuntarily.

This was simply a scene that could only be left behind after a great battle. The land plane formed by the endless skeletons of the Yan Immortals was even vaster than the Heavenly Continent plane that Bian Ziyuan was in.

When Yan Fan saw this scene, he could not help but click his tongue. “Good heavens, how many Yan Immortals died to form this place? It’s really magnificent.”

“Be careful. I’m afraid there are living things here.” Jiang Li frowned. “Are you sure the Chaos Origin Sealess Fruit is here?”

Yan Fan nodded affirmatively and pointed ahead. “It’s definitely here. Look here, there’s no longer any restraint of the Order Heavenly Dao. The Yan power is in a chaotic and unknown state, which is quite in line with the meaning of the Origin. That old boy Cang Ting’s summary is not bad.”

Looking around, Jian Wushuang soon felt that what Yan Fan said was reasonable. The land formed by the bones of countless Yan Immortals was a land of chaos without the order of Heavenly Dao.

“Let’s go. Let’s find that fruit first. This small corpse ground is nothing.” Yan Fan said and flew toward the Sealess Domain. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Walk behind me. No matter what danger you encounter, don’t make a move.” Let’s go, ” Jiang Li said and walked ahead.

Jian Wushuang nodded and covered his body with his Yan power before stepping into the Sealess Domain.

As soon as he stepped into it, an unknown and chaotic Yan power came over.

The saber-like Yan power kept cutting the derivative energy on the surface of his Immortal body, making Jian Wushuang feel slightly uncomfortable.

Jiang Li noticed his discomfort, so she dispelled the chaotic Yan power around Jian Wushuang and formed a barrier around him with his Sword Intent.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang thanked him solemnly.

Jiang Li raised his eyebrows and smiled. “Remember to call me Mistress from today onwards.”
