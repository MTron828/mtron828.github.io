Chapter 948: Seething in Anger

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The icy-cold saber shadow hissed as it crossed the Ninth Heaven!

Xue Lingtian stood amidst the storm with a bloodied face and a pair of eyes brimming with madness and determination.

This move was his best. He had placed all of his energy into it without regarding the consequences.

This was also the best he could do for his Junior Brother.

The blade light seemed capable of piercing all the sharp aura. Even Xia Yong was forced to move.

“Not bad.”

Xia Yong nodded but subsequently extended his hands to reveal the dry and somewhat yellowed skin on his palms. Two strange powers were fusing on his palms.

One was a raging and scorching power while the other was calm and stately.

The two distinctive powers were perfectly combined in Xia Yong’s palms.

“Open!”

Xia Yong struck at the Void in front of him.

This move sent tremor down the whole world and the cracked space began to rapidly spread.

Before Xue Lingtian’s strong blade light could get close to Xia Yong, a giant palm print that harbored two distinct powers appeared out of thin air. The palm print that seemed to harbor all the force of the world struck the blade light.

“Boom!”

A fierce roar sounded, accompanied by a horrifying power that spread in all directions.

Xue Lingtian, who stood in the core of this power, felt his hands shaking. Then, at the next moment, his saber was instantly flung away.

“Scram!”

Xia Yong waved his sleeves and his horrible power immediately formed a huge palm print that bombarded Xue Lingtian.

Xue Lingtian trembled violently as he coughed up blood thrice. His body was thrown backward like a cannonball being fired.

“Senior Brother!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“I’m sorry, Junior Brother... I tried my best...” When Xue Lingtian’s sad laughter reached Jian Wushuang’s ears, he saw the former’s body crashing onto a heap of rubble. For a moment, there was no vitality coming from Xue Lingtian.

Rage swept Jian Wushuang.

Before he could dwell on it, however, he saw an elegant figure dressed in a white robe appearing in front of him.

“Leng Rushuang,” he said, a little stunned.

White airflow wrapped Leng Rushuang’s entire body and she emitted a freezing aura. This was the consequence of the complete unraveling of the seal in her body.

“I’ll never allow anyone to hurt him!”

Her voice carried unprecedented firmness and determination. The white airflow bounced on her right hand like white flames but these flames were freezing cold.

When Xia Yong had seriously injured Xue Lingtian and once again pounced on Jian Wushuang, Leng Rushuang’s eyes glinted as she unleashed her freezing aura.

“Die!”

Following her scream, the white airflow around her condensed into an adult-sized white flame in the shape of a sword. It flew out as soon as it took shape.

The sword left a trail of white sprays as it made a sudden appearance in front of Xia Yong.

Xia Yong could feel the terrifying freezing aura of the sword as it aimed for him. He swung his dry and yellow palms and blocked the sword with his perfectly-fused twin powers.

“Boom!”

The sword snapped into two, leaking a mass of white flames.

“What?”

When Xia Yong looked at his right palm, he could see a hint of whiteness on it. More importantly, the speck of whiteness was rapidly spreading all over his palm at an incredible speed.

“What a horrible poison.”

Though he was shocked, he quickly gathered himself and shook his palms. His twin powers then charged toward the white area and took only a short moment to disperse it.

Leng Rushuang’s Icy Heart Poison was indeed dreadful and could be considered the top poison through the ages. However, Xia Yong was a Celestial Master. He could still dispell the little amount of it with ease.

“You’re Emperor Leng’s daughter?” Xia Yong was cold and brusque. “You should’ve married Xia Mang. Since he’s now dead, you should join him in the afterlife.”

Xia Yong wasn’t at all concerned about the fact that she was Emperor Leng’s daughter.

He gripped his right hand, once again melding the two distinct powers. He made another move all of a sudden.

“Stop, Leng Rushuang! Retreat now!”

“Now!”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t far behind her and began shouting at her like a madman when he noticed Xia Yong’s killing intent.

However, there was a touch of determination on Leng Rushuang’s pretty face.

She heard Jian Wushuang’s warning but had no intention of retreating.

After all, Jian Wushuang was... not far behind her.

“Buzz!” The endless white airflow took the shape of a light cocoon around her.

“Bang!”

Xia Yong landed a palm attack on the white light cocoon and his horrible power instantly erupted.

The white light cocoon managed to put a resistance due to its uncommon power but it was fleeting.

“Crack!”

The light cocoon cracked open to reveal Leng Rushuang. Xia Yong’s powerful palm print continued to charge ahead and ended up hitting her directly.

“Jian Wushuang!” Leng Rushuang uttered a shrill scream. “Run!”

“Boom!”

Xia Yong’s palm landed on Leng Rushuang.

She felt a jolt running through her body and coughed up blood, the blood staining her white robe and beautiful hair.

She fell down like a kite that was cut loose. On her way down, she turned ever so slightly to look in Jian Wushuang’s direction and opened her mouth a little.

She didn’t make any sound and merely mouthed the words.

Jian Wushuang could read her lips as she mouthed the words: “I don’t regret it!”

He watched her body fall down in the Void with an empty gaze until he read her lips.

“Boom!” It felt as if thousands of thunderbolts struck his mind.

His expression immediately turned crazed.

“Arghhhhh!”

“Xia Yong, I’m going to kill you!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned bloody as his hair danced crazily around his head. He let out a bellow that could tear apart the Ninth Heaven and destroy the firmament.

This bellow contained his madness and wrath. It contained his determination to avenge his loved ones even if it meant destroying the world and sacrificing everything including his life.

This was the most furious bellow Jian Wushuang had made since he was born. His sorrow and rage were so apparent in his voice that it was enough to make the world tremble.

This time, Jian Wushuang was truly seething in anger.
