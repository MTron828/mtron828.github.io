Chapter 5458 ¬†Ten Million Inheritors

Over the years in the Elder Palace, they not only extorted many treasures from the White Tiger Temple but also obtained quite a few from the Vermilion Bird Temple.

Various special items from the Northern Region, acquired through robbery or deception, all ended up in Yuanyang Lake.

In the realm of cultivation environments, only the Grave God Mountain was missing.

"There aren't really any that suit a Dao Lord; you know, although the Elder Palace has started recruiting experts from the Four Great Secret Realms, we initially recruit internal members who are at least at tier 3. Peripheral members do not have the qualification to enter the Yuanyang Lake, and even if they do, they don't have the right to reside."

This practice is the same for both the Elder Palace and the White Tiger Temple.

Internal members can enjoy some resources, but external members have to spend money, or they don't even need to pay anything‚Äîthey just find someone to rely on and not contribute to the Elder Palace. That's considered acceptable.

Qiuhuang paused for a moment and continued, "However, I can see that your strength is not weak. There are some places that suit your cultivation, and some that don't. You're not an ordinary Dao Lord; your strength is probably comparable to a peak-level tier 4."

Qiuhuang paused for a moment and continued, "However, I can see that your strength is not weak. There are some places that suit your cultivation, and some that don't. You're not an ordinary Dao Lord; your strength is probably comparable to a peak-level tier 4."

"More or less!" Jian Wushuang was modest.

He feared that revealing his true strength might attract jealousy.

Qiuhuang nodded and analyzed, "With your strength, I can roughly offer you a few suggestions. There are three main training grounds in Yuanyang Lake suitable for you.

"Fenyang Island, where you can meditate and nourish your soul. Before you break through in seclusion, you can spend some time there."

"The second is the Demon Sound Mountain, which you should be familiar with. Go and feel the universe Origin Source at the top of the mountain, a prime choice for tempering your Origin Source."

Qiuhuang's tone changed, and his expression became serious, "This last one not only suits you but also everyone. On the core island of Yuanyang Lake, there is a Beiwang Tower. It was personally brought here by Lord Zhen Ling and is a Universe Treasure. Inside, there is also a complete Universe Origin Source."

"Complete Universe Origin Source!" At first, Jian Wushuang didn't pay much attention.

He even had a Temporal Treasure, so the Universe Treasure seemed somewhat unimpressive. However, upon hearing it was the complete Universe Origin Source, his interest was piqued.

On the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard, he couldn't even understand the pieces, so for now, it didn't seem very helpful to him. The Universe Origin Source, on the other hand, was more intuitive.

Seeing his astonishment, Qiuhuang smiled triumphantly. "Yes, the complete Universe Origin Source. I suggest you follow the order I mentioned and visit these three places; it will be very beneficial for you."

"Alright!" Jian Wushuang nodded.

"There's one more thing I need to remind you of. The Elder Palace is a bit different from before. If you have acquaintances in the White Tiger Temple, try to reduce contact in the future, especially within the Elder Palace."

Jian Wushuang was momentarily puzzled.

He didn't have many acquaintances in the White Tiger Temple. But since Qiuhuang had given the warning, he wouldn't willingly invite trouble.

"This is for external matters. You'll understand in the future. For internal affairs, you need to be aware of some things. The three Palace Masters of the Elder Palace‚Äîyou know them. I, along with Yang Sanmu, belong to the side of Palace Master Qingniu. Wu Zuo and Lu Hua are in the same group. Palace Master Changfeng and the people from the Longevity Hall belong to another faction. You must distinguish these people; otherwise, even if you are an Inheritor, you might suffer in secret."

Jian Wushuang could relate to this advice.

Qiuhuang continued with a hint of a smile, "Do you know that many Inheritors from the Grave God Mountain, those Dao Lords from your batch, have entered the Elder Palace after successfully merging Dao? Now, a large number have gone to the Elder Palace, while only a few went to the Four Great Halls."

The reason was self-evident. With the support of Zhen Ling, the Emperor level cultivators cultivated on the Grave God Mountain were originally supposed to enter the Azure Dragon Temple according to the process.

However, they all ended up in the Elder Palace. Without the backing of Zhen Ling, who would dare to be so audacious?

The crucial point was the skewed distribution of resources.

The Bloodthirst Continent, where the Azure Dragon Temple is located, serves as the backyard for the hall, incomparable to the Four Great Secret Realms. While the Bloodthirst Continent is indeed vast, it lacks the ancient atmosphere of other ancient lands, and its heritage is scarce. Going to the Bloodthirst Continent is essentially retiring.

It might be better to choose the White Tiger Temple or the Vermilion Bird Temple.

Both temples imply expansion, and their rules have been broken‚Äîthey are open to all, regardless of background. The Vermilion Bird Temple is currently short of people, and it won't take long to select a trial participant from the universe. They need to go to other universes to plunder the Yan Immortals and Grand Yan Immortals.

If it weren't for other universes rejecting the Qishen Temple, Zhen Ling would have plundered the Ultimate Dao Lords from each universe long ago.

The breaking of the rules by the Elders' Palace is due to the tilted resources and the great potential for development.

Being a laborer in the White Tiger Temple brings few benefits.

The Elders Palace is different; few people mean abundant resources.

There was an infusion of resources from the Northern Territory. As long as an Emperor, who is an Inheritor coming down from the Grave God Mountain, arrives at the Elders Palace, they will ascend another level.

How could this not be attractive?

Just like when Si Tian became a disciple of the Hall Master of the Longevity Hall. After breaking through, Si Tian was only at the peak-level tier 3. Upon arriving at the Elders' Palace, he became a top-level tier 4.

On the Grave God Mountain, there were mostly individuals like her, with mediocre aptitude.

Initially, in just 30 years, over 10,000 Inheritors were chosen. Even if the quantity decreased later on, after 100,000 thousand years, the Grave God Mountain probably had millions of Inheritors.

There were only a bit over 2,000 Ultimate Dao Lords, and only a few became Emperors.

Those who practiced the Myriad Dao path, followed the divine body path, and some with special Grand Dao routes were even rarer than the Ultimate Dao.

In addition to these, there were over ten million second-grade Origin Dao Lords, individuals who had rapidly advanced, and now, it was estimated that thousands of them had successfully integrated their Daos.

Especially among the first batch of Inheritors, there were already over 1,000 who had succeeded in integrating the Dao.

During the trial period, 1,000 individuals became Dao Lords, and the weakest among those who merged their paths were tier 3 Emperors. Becoming tier 4 Emperors was only a matter of time.

If one couldn't even reach tier 4 Emperor level, most of them were eliminated through the selection process.

For those with mediocre aptitude, even if they became Emperors, they wouldn't thrive in the Qishen Temple.

It was indeed unjustifiable to invest so many resources and not reach tier 4.

Of course, as some became Emperors, there were others who perished due to failed the Dao Merge.

Although the Grave God Mountain had a complete Dao Merge inheritance, for those whose Origin Source Dao was exceptionally outstanding, it only provided some assistance.

Among 100 Dao Lords, having a success rate of 20 percent in Dao Merge was considered good.

In the Ultimate Dao, over 90 Dao Lords attempted the Dao Merge, and the final successful few were considered high.

After becoming Emperors, unless they followed the Ultimate Dao or belonged to those special Origin Source Dao, most would descend to the temples in the Earth Realm or the Elders Palace in the Heavenly Realm. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

They would seek a powerful Emperor as their mentor. With a powerful backer, they could roam freely in the Four Great Secret Realms, plundering resources from all directions.
