Chapter 842: Soaring Strength

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

To say that cultivation in the Divine Sea yielded twice the result with half the effort was an understatement. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jian Wushang’s two Original Bodies worked separately. The World Body concentrated on the Three Secret Skills of the Ancient God while the Slaughter Body studied the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

Soaking in the scalding energy, his sword heart and body were naturally elevated.

At the other end of the Divine Sea, Asura was also completely immersed in his cultivation.

The seconds and minutes passed by.

For Jian Wushuang and his silently increasing strength, the one-month cultivation finished in the blink of an eye.

When his time ran out, a huge wave emerged in the Divine Sea and instantly swallowed him before he had time to react.

When he opened his eyes again, he had already appeared outside the wormhole.

“One month, did it pass so soon?” Jian Wushuang sighed with regret, but at the same time, he was delighted.

The one-month cultivation was a great fortune for Jian Wushuang.

He had made great progress.

His Sword Heart had reached the Peak of Level Three under the one-month nourishment, and he was just a step away from reaching Level Four.

Notably, Jian Wushuang had not long entered Level Three, either.

He had thought that it would take him dozens of years to reach the peak, but in the Divine Sea, it only took him one month.

The Sword Heart had greatly improved, so he was able to activate more of its power. His swordsmanship had also improved.

His body had also strengthened massively, and he became tougher and more powerful. The effect was just like that of the Immortality Secret Skill he had continuously used to cultivate his physical strength. Within a month, he had reached the peak of Armor Technique, and his body was now superior to that of most Eternal Realm experts.

If he turned into an Ancient God, his body would be more terrifying.

Over the past month, he had not spent too much time on Dao Enlightenment, so his World Dao and Slaughter Dao did not make a big improvement.

Jian Wushuang’s greatest progress was that he had mastered more Secret Skills.

Like the Star-river Secret Skill, he had reached Level 13 and 14 over the past month, so now if he used his full strength, his strength would increase by 42 times!

42 times!

Compared with ordinary warriors, whose strength was improved by 10 times, his strength was improved 32 times more than theirs. What a huge advantage!

He also made a new breakthrough in the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

In just one month, he had truly made amazing progress in the Divine Sea.

His strength soared!

“Before entering the Divine Sea, even though I turned into an ancient god and tried my best to activate the Blood Mountain Sword, I was only able to grapple with ordinary experts at Step Six of the Eternal Realm. But now my strength has improved greatly. Even without my Blood Mountain Sword, I could now defeat them with ease.”

“If I use the Blood Mountain Sword, very few experts at Step Six of the Eternal Realm could match me.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and sensed his strength with a flicker of joy in his eyes.

“Blood Mountain.”

A frosty voice was heard before Asura was seen approaching. He had just come out of the Divine Sea.

Jian Wushuang was shocked at the sight of him.

He could see that Asura had undergone great changes, particularly in the aura emanating from his body.

His previously recognizable Divine Realm aura had turned into an overwhelming Eternal Realm aura.

Obviously, Asura had made a breakthrough in the Divine Sea.

“Congratulations.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Haha, the same as you.” Asura shrugged and said with a smile on his face.

“Hrm, right.” Jian Wushuang touched his nose.

Since he left the Divine Sea, he had activated the Yin-Yang Mirror to transform his aura. Now he was exuding Eternal Realm aura, and had also reached the Eternal Realm Level.

Therefore, Asura thought that Jian Wushuang had broken into the Eternal Realm, just as he did.

In fact, Jian Wushuang was still just a Divine Realm expert.

“Have both of you come out?”

A voice rang out, and the scarlet-robed elder landed in front of them.

The elder smiled at the two boys and asked, “How do you feel?”

“I feel very good. I thought that it would take some time for me to make it to the Eternal Realm, but aided by the Divine Sea, I’ve made a breakthrough and improved greatly in many respects,” Asura said earnestly.

“So did I.” Jian Wushuang responded with a faint smile.

“Both of you can go to the Divine Sea once for free, but it will be difficult to enter it again,” the elder sighed.

“What do I need to do if I want to go there again?” asked Jian Wushuang.

Indeed, he wanted to spend another stint in a place like the Divine Sea.

“100,000 points, and it can only be paid in points, not Divine Gems,” the elder replied.

“100,000?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

In the treasure volt, he only needed to exchange 10,000 points for the unique Yin-Yang Mirror.

100,000 points could be exchanged for 10 treasures equivalent to the Yin-Yang Mirror. It was equal to one billion Divine Gems, almost comparable to the Dao Master’s entire possessions.

“In the Blood Eagle Guard, to complete a relatively simple task, you can get 1,000 or 2,000 points. For more difficult tasks, you can receive 4,000 or 5,000 points. But for most Blood Eagle Guards, even if they saved for tens of thousands of years, they could not afford 100,000 points.” The elder shook his head with a smile. “But there is another way.”

“The Divine Sea is exotic but it also has some flaws.”

“Firstly, it costs too much.”

“An ordinary Blood Eagle Guard would have to spend an astronomical sum to spend one month cultivating in there.”
