Chapter 2928: Inquiry

——

Evergreen Island was vast and majestic, with countless towering palaces and courtyards.

Many cultivators gathered in front of the main gate of the island. Most of them had reached the Great Divine Master level and were waiting there. They were here to see the Evergreen Realm Lord.

“Please inform him that Jian Yuan is here to pay a visit,” Jian Wushuang said politely.

“Jian Yuan?” The guard guarding the gate looked Jian Wushuang up and down.

Jian Wushuang smiled and slightly revealed his divine power aura.

His realm had reached the Advanced Great Divine Master level. Under the cover of black rock, his divine power aura had reached the limit of a Divine Master, but he could not reach the Immortal Saint level.

When Xuan Shen Daoist gave him the black rock, he said that the black rock could only cover the aura of Immortal Saint and below.

Jian Wushuang gave the name ‘Jian Yuan’ at the last minute.

Even though the Inkstone Realm was far away from the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, Jian Wushuang still did not dare to be careless. He did not dare to use his real name or even the two aliases he used in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. ‘Jian Yi’ and ‘Su Han’, he did not dare to use them.

Therefore, he could only choose another one.

The guard also sensed Jian Wushuang’s aura and was immediately startled. “Wait a moment. I’ll immediately report it.”

The guard immediately reported this matter to the butler, who was usually in charge of Evergreen Island. But, unfortunately, he was also a Peak Great Divine Master.

“Jian Yuan? I’ve never heard of this name. I don’t know where it came from.”

“The Realm Lord is busy these days. He doesn’t have time to see this and that. Go and tell him to wait outside for a few decades.” The butler ordered.

The guard immediately returned and conveyed the butler’s message. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could not help smiling bitterly, but then his body shook.

Boom!

A terrifying divine power directly covered the entire Evergreen Island.

This divine power was earth-shaking and suppressed everything. In an instant, countless cultivators in Evergreen Island began to tremble.

At the island’s main entrance, the experts who were waiting quietly looked at Jian Wushuang in horror.

The guard and the housekeeper who had walked out of the island were also terrified.

Jian Wushuang could not be bothered with them. He just calmly looked at the place not far away.

There, an aura slowly rose.

“May I know which friend has come to my Evergreen Island?” A gentle voice slowly spread. A middle-aged man in a green robe with stubble slowly appeared in the void above.

Seeing this middle-aged man in a green robe, many experts in Evergreen Island immediately showed respect.

This middle-aged man in a green robe was the Realm Lord of Evergreen Island. He was also one of the four Realm Lords of the Inkstone Realm, the Evergreen Realm Lord.

“Jian Yuan greets the Evergreen Realm Lord,” Jian Wushuang said politely.

“Yes, a Divine Master?” The Evergreen Realm Lord looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

He had sensed the divine power, which was why he had shown himself.

But he had never expected that it was only a Divine Master who was emitting the divine power?

Although Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master, his casual standing gave the Evergreen Realm Lord great pressure. As a result, the Evergreen Realm Lord did not dare to underestimate him.

“This Divine Master is not simple.” This was the first thought that came to the Evergreen Realm Lord’s mind.

“My friend, let’s have a chat on the island.” The Evergreen Realm Lord invited him.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang thanked him and immediately followed the Evergreen Realm Lord to the center of the island.

In the center of a magnificent palace, the Evergreen Realm Lord ordered some delicacies and wine for Jian Wushuang to enjoy.

“You are not from the Inkstone Realm, are you?” The Evergreen Realm Lord asked casually.

“Have you noticed, Realm Lord?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Of course. I know many powerful Divine Masters in the Inkstone Realm, many of them have been accepted by me. You are so powerful, but I have never heard of you. So, naturally, you are not from the Inkstone Realm,” the Evergreen Realm Lord said with a smile.

“Indeed, I’m from another realm. As for why I came to the Inkstone Realm today, I have something to ask you, Evergreen Realm Lord,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You can tell me, my young friend.” The Evergreen Realm Lord looked at him.

“You’ve been famous for so many years and are very knowledgeable. Have you ever heard of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The Evergreen Realm Lord was stunned, but his expression immediately turned solemn. “I have naturally heard of the famous Heaven-cleaving Alliance in the divine beginning world. I even yearn for it. However, it’s not easy to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

“If that’s the case, do you know where the nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is located in the nearby territories, your excellency?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance was recognized as the number one Alliance in the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

Its power was spread over every territory and every corner of the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

To achieve this, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance needed to have a spatial channel to connect the corners of each territory and had to have secret strongholds in those territories.

These strongholds were known as nests in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!

For example, there was a secret nest around the territory of the Golden Crow Nine Realms. All the members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance in the Golden Crow Nine Realms and the surrounding territories would go to that secret nest if they wanted to take on missions.

Of course, this was also what Bone Emperor told him.

He had a Heaven-cleaving token, and he was powerful enough. So he wanted to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Although originally, he wanted to wait for Leng Rushuang’s matter to come to an end before he went to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s nest in the surrounding territories of the Golden Crow Nine Realms, after passing the Heaven-cleaving token to participate in the assessment of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he officially became a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

However, he had to flee from the territory of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and come to the Inkstone realm, which was an unknown distance away from the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

Here, Jian Wushuang did not know where the secret nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was, so he could only invite people to inquire about it.

That was the main reason why he came to look for the Evergreen Realm Master.

“The Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair…” The Evergreen Realm Lord frowned slightly. “My young friend, as far as I know, there is no Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair in the Inkstone Realm. However, I have vaguely heard that there is one in the territory near the Inkstone Realm. However, I don’t know the exact location of the lair. After all, I have never really dealt with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

“You don’t know?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly, but he was not surprised.

“However, although I don’t know the location of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s secret nest, someone in my Inkstone Realm does.” The Evergreen Realm Lord suddenly changed the topic.
