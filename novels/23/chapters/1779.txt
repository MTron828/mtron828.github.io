Chapter 1780: Great Opportunity

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the cave dwelling, the Master of Star Palace continued casually.

“Of course, no matter if it is Buddhist Demon Sea or other places, they are only miniature territories that broke from the true ancient battlefield, just like a drop of ocean water from a boundless ocean. In Eternal Chaotic World, there are two known boundless ancient battlefields that are more complete.”

“First, there is the First Lair!”

“The First Lair is an ancient battlefield that contains boundless opportunity. However, the First Lair was conquered by the Star Demon tribe long ago and it is the Star Demon Tribe’s old lair. Even a Great Emperor would have scruples and not rush in easily. Over the years, Sanctuary Alliance has only searched through a small part of the territory in the First Lair.”

“Besides the First Lair, there’s another ancient battlefield, which is the Ancient Mystery Land that will only open every five million years!”

“Ancient Mystery Land is much bigger than the First Lair and the opportunities within are countless. Every time it opens, it will attract many experts to flood in. Same goes for this time.”

Then, the Master of Star Palace paused and overlooked.

Then, among the four Hall Masters, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun revealed passionate expressions, especially Hall Master Nie Yun. His eyes were bloodshot.

Ancient battlefield had a great attraction for Great Emperors, let alone Hall Master Nie Yun.

If the First Lair wasn’t conquered by Star Demons and was too dangerous, many Sir God would go into the First Lair to try their look without hesitation.

Ancient Mystery Land didn’t have any Star Demons and it was much bigger than the First Lair, and also had more opportunities.

The two Sir Gods were, of course, crazy about it.

However, in contrast to the two Hall Masters, Hall Master Yuan looked cold and remained aloof about Ancient Mystery Land. He wasn’t a Sir God, nor did he want to go to Ancient Mystery Land.

As for Jian Wushuang… he looked equally unmoved.

“Ancient Mystery Land isn’t as dangerous as the First Lair. Hence, even Sir Gods can head in. You might get a lot of opportunities if you are lucky. So, of the four of you, would anyone like to head into Ancient Mystery Land?” The Master of Star Palace asked.

“I,” Hall Master Nie Yun stood up without hesitation.

“I’d like to go too,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

As for Hall Master Yuan and Jian Wushuang, neither spoke.

To Hall Master Yuan, the Master of Star Palace didn’t ask much but he looked at Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, among Almighties in Lineage of Star, your power is second to mine. If you were to wander in Ancient Mystery Land, you would stand a higher possibility of getting an opportunity. Unless you are not interested in Ancient Mystery Land?”

“I’m definitely interested but not now. I have been fighting all this while and I am really tense. I want to relax and it has been very long since I left my hometown. I plan to return to my hometown to take a look. As for Ancient Mystery Land, let’s talk about it after I return from my hometown,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

“You were first besieged by Soaring Heaven King Palace in the Eighth Lair then Acheron Palace tried to assassinate you in Buddhist Demon Sea. Now, you have been fighting with Soaring Heaven King Palace. You really should relax for a bit,” the Master of Star Palace was understanding.

“Palace Master, you would go personally during this opening of Ancient Mystery Land, right?” Hall Master Yuan suddenly said.

“Mm,” the Master of Star Palace nodded, “I will wander personally during the opening of Ancient Mystery Land and I intend to explore the Seven Star Realm.”

“Seven Star Realm?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “It’s named after Seven Star. Could it be related to Seven Star Black Sect?”

Hall Master Nie Yun and Hall Master Gu Xin were confused too.

“Things have reached this stage so I shall not keep it a secret to all of you. Many years ago I received Secret Skill of Seven Star (Secret Skill of Star Palace) in Seven Star Realm and also a unique treasure,” the Master of Star Palace smiled.

Hall Master Nie Yun and Hall Master Gu Xin were surprised.

“Seven Star Realm was left behind by an ancient force called Seven Star Black Sect. The opportunities contained were far beyond Secret Skill of Seven Star. It’s a pity that Seven Star Black Sect set up a lot of prohibitions in Seven Star Realm, including many killing formations. I was already lucky enough to obtain Secret Skill of Seven Star and the unique treasure. All these years, although Seven Star Realm was opened many times and I went in to explore as well, I didn’t find much. Until five million years ago, which was the previous opening of the Ancient Mystery Land…”

“I finally found a new opportunity in Seven Star Realm and the opportunity was extraordinary. It’s a pity that there’s a prohibition outside the opportunity. Then, I didn’t prepare much so I didn’t get my hands onto the opportunity even until Ancient Mystery Land closed. However, it’s different this time.”

“In the past five million years, I have been well-prepared. If there’s no accident, I should be able to resolve the prohibition and obtain the opportunity within. By then, my overall power will definitely increase tremendously and I might even reach the level of Great Emperor!” The Master of Star Palace beamed with joy.

Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, and Hall Master Nie Yun looked surprised when they heard him.

An opportunity greater than the Secret Skill of Seven Star?

If the Master of Star Palace got his hands on it, he stood a chance to become a Great Emperor?

Great Emperor was one of the strongest people in Eternal Chaotic World. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

If there were to be another Great Emperor in Lineage of Star, the overall power would definitely reach another brand new level. They might even overtake forces like Soaring Heaven King Palace.

After all, although Soaring Heaven King Palace was strong, they were nothing in front of a Great Emperor. A Great Emperor could easily destroy the entire Soaring Heaven King Palace alone.

“Seven Star Realm is unusual. Palace Master has to be extremely cautious in his actions,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Don’t worry. I know,” the Master of Star Palace smiled and he was obviously confident in his trip.

“Gu Xin, Nie Yun and I will be heading to Ancient Mystery Land while Jian Wushuang will be returning to his hometown. You will have to take care of Lineage of Star alone for now,” the Master of Star Palace said.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

“Alright, we shall finish here. Gu Xin and Nie Yun, both of you get ready. Ten years later, head to Ancient Mystery Land with me,” the Master of Star Palace exhorted.

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun nodded simultaneously.

Then, the four of them left.

In the cave dwelling, there was only the Master of Star Palace left.

The Master of Star Palace then fixed his gaze in the distance and he pondered, in deep thought.

“Lineage of Star has too many enemies in Eternal Chaotic World, especially the possession of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, countless experts and forces hankered for it. Even experts at the level of Great Emperor have thoughts about it. In addition to that, Jian Wushuang’s sudden rise led to more people who have scruples about Lineage of Star!”

“In such a situation, only if I become a Great Emperor could Lineage of Star be safe and sound.”

“The opening of Ancient Mystery Land this time is a turning point. I definitely have to get the opportunity in Seven Star Realm!!”
