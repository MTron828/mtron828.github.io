Chapter 2684: Master Mo

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Palace Keeper Si Zhen frowned but did not press on with further questions.

“Royal Blood Gem is one of the main materials for refining Holy Treasures. It’s extremely valuable with many Undying Saints wanting to get their hands on it. The Royal Blood Gem weighs two hundred thirty catties so its value must be extravagant. However, it was just too expensive that many experts could not afford to buy it,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“That’s why I’ll hand this Royal Blood Gem to you so that Crimson Stone Fort can deal with it.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Jian Wushuang knew that only Star Picking Pavilion could afford to purchase the 230 catties of Royal Blood Gem in the entire Danyang Holy Domain.

Jian Wshuang had sold 10 catties Royal Blood Gem in the Wushui Territory at a way too low price. He had no choice but to sell it at a very low price to the Star Picking Pavilion at that time because he could not find someone else to buy it.

He did not want to suffer the same losses again.

In addition, he had nowhere else to sell the Royal Blood Gem with the only channel he could go through was the Crimson Stone Fort.

“The Fort Master must have a way to sell this off but I’m afraid it’ll take a while. How many resources are you asking in exchange for this Royal Blood Gem?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen asked.

“I only need ten thousand Divine Elixir Pills and one hundred billion Primordial Stones. This piece of Royal Blood Gem should be worth much more than that of course, hence I’ll give the extra to your Fort Master.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Well, I’ll go see the Fort Master now and ask her to decide.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen went to see Yin Su’er immediately with excitement.

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry and waited quietly in the hall.

...

“The Royal Blood Gem weighs two hundred thirty catties?”

Yin Su’er was also quite surprised when she heard about it.

“Yes, I saw it with my own eyes,” answered Palace Keeper Si Zhen solemnly.

“Jian Yi has such a large piece of Royal Blood Gem? Could it be from the Interspatial Ring Scorpion King gave him?” Yin Su’er squinted before immediately shook her head. “No, Scorpion King is loyal to me and told me exactly how many Blood Gems he received from that Blood Gem Mineral Vein with no Royal Blood Gems. The Scorpion King won’t lie to me.”

“If that’s the case, this Royal Blood Gem...must be as he said—he got it by chance. It’s that or he had probably hidden it in advance upon discovering the Royal Blood Gem when the Official Army guarded over the mineral vein. Regardless, he got it using his own ability in any case, so we can’t penalize him.”

“It’s true as Jian Yi is still somewhat conscientious and said that he only needs ten thousand Divine Elixir Pills and a hundred billion Primordial Stones after we sold the Royal Blood Gem. He’ll offer the rest of it to you,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“The price of the two hundred thirty catties of Royal Blood Gem is indeed more than what he asked for. Of course, It also depends on who it is sold to.” Yin Su’er had a cold expression.

“There are only those few among the Nine Realms of Golden Crow who can take up this Royal Blood Gem. The Star Picking Pavilion is the only Chamber of Commerce among those few. Do you want to sell it to the Star Picking Pavilion or—”

Yin Su’er waved and interrupted before Palace Keeper Si Zhen finished talking. “Although the Star Picking Pavilion is the first-ranked Chamber of Commerce, they are the worst choice. They won’t be able to sell the Royal Blood Gem for a high price unless they organize a large-scale auction by gathering various experts.

“Any treasure can only be sold at its greatest value to those people who really need it. The people who are most eager to get it are naturally those high-level refining masters since this Royal Blood Gem is a refining material after all.”

“Refining master?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was puzzled but immediately thought of someone. “Fort Master, are you talking about Master Mo?”

“Yes, it’s him.” A smile appeared on Yin Su’er’s face. “Master Mo isn’t only recognized as the number one refining master in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow, but also a powerful Undying Saint. His influence and resources are beyond my imagination. Even Father had a lot of respect for Master Mo when he was alive and didn’t dare to rub Master Mo in the wrong way.

“Master Mo’s reputation has always been good. Many people have taken the initiative to send him some precious refining materials. He’ll also pay a good matching price as long as the resources are precious and rare. On the other hand, the Star Picking Pavilion only cares about profit, so they’ll try to keep the price low while Master Mo won’t be bothered to do so.

“Besides, Master Mo should be quite happy to see the Royal Blood Gem.”

“Correct, Master Mo will never be greedy and snatch the Royal Blood Gem away. Fort Master can safely sell the Royal Blood Gem to him.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen nodded his approval as he had heard of Master Mo.

“I visit him, I can only find a way to get someone trustworthy and bring a message to Master Mo—tell him I have a Royal Blood Gem here. I don’t know how or when Master Mo will reply to me, so...” Yin Su’er narrowed her eyes.

“Go and ask Jian Yi to hand over the Royal Blood Gem to me. I’ll try my best to deal with it, but I’m unsure how much time it’ll take. He’ll have to wait. As for what he wants... I can’t give him much of the Divine Elixir Pills if he needs that cultivation resources urgently, but I can give him ten billion of Primordial Stones first. I’ll give the remaining Divine Elixir Pills and Primordial Stones to him after we sell the Royal Blood Gem.”

“Yes.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen responded and went back to the Sacred Palace. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yin Su’er stood with a wide beam on her face. “Two hundred thirty catties of Royal Blood Gem... Jian Yi, you’ve really helped me a lot.”

...

In a hall in the Sacred Palace, Palace Keeper Si Zhen had once again appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Fort Master requests that you give the Royal Blood Gem to her first, Jian Yi. She’ll find a way to deal with it, but it’ll take some time. Meanwhile, she can give you ten billion Primordial Stones first if you are in urgent need of resources.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen retold Jian Wushuang Yin Su’er’s words.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He understood that it would not be easy even if Yin Su’er personally wanted to deal with such a large piece of Royal Blood Gem. It was normal that she needed a certain amount of time.

Yin Su’er promised to give Jian Wushuang 10,000,000,000 Primordial Stones first which was enough for him to squander some time.

“Palace Keeper Si Zhen, there are two more matters that I need your help for,” said Jian Wushuang again.
