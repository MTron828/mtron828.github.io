“Second Holy Master!”

“He came here?”

“I thought Holy Emperor Palace would send Fourth Holy Master or Third Holy Master to handle this. I didn’t expect that Second Holy Master would turn up.”

Many experts were stunned.

“Second Holy Master, Bo Xi.” The Wine Master’s expression changed when he saw the slender black-robed elder.

“It’s over.” Wine Master sighed while shaking his head.

He had fought with Fourth Holy Master and Second Holy Master, so he knew Second Holy Master was very powerful.

He thought if Fourth Holy Master came, Jian Wushuang would have an opportunity to fight back against him.

If Third Holy Master showed up, Jian Wushuang might have a chance to survive.

But now it was Second Holy Master...

“He will die.”?Wine Master thought.

“Second Holy Master is personally fighting him. Jian Wushuang is doomed.”?The other experts also shared this thought.

While still at the peak of Skyward Mountain, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, raised his head, and stared at the slender black-robed elder.

The elder peacefully stood above the mountain, without emanating an aura. However, Jian Wushuang felt a great pressure.

“There are four Holy Masters in Holy Emperor Palace. I wonder who you are,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“I’m Second Holy Master, Bo Xi,” the slender black-robed elder replied.

“Second Holy Master?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed slightly.

“Since you know who I am, you should be clear about your ending. Now I will give you an opportunity. You can kill yourself.” Second Holy Master stood there with a cold, arrogant look.

He was definitely qualified to look down on Jian Wushuang.

“Kill myself?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “In this world, no one can make me kill myself. You? Are you qualified?”

“Since you’re so stubborn, I won’t show any mercy,” Second Holy Master said coldly. Then he took a step forwards. In that instant, his stride spanned hundreds of feet while radiating invisible waves.

Jian Wushuang felt a great power begin to suppress him from all directions. He was a bit surprised.

“Fight!” Jian Wushuang suddenly snarled.

As his thunderous voice reverberated, a roaring battle intent suddenly spread out. A terrifying power, which could devour everything, burst forth.

Soul-Devouring Secret Skill...

Normally, Jian Wushuang would wait, only displaying this skill when he had no choice. But this time, Jian Wushuang performed it without any hesitation.

The terrifying power devoured everything in the surroundings. A large amount of natural power flowed into his body, which made his aura soar.

“Very interesting tactic.” Second Holy Master quietly stood there and did not try to block it.

The battle intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes was powerful.

“Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!”

Hua... A vast Blood River directly flowed out. Instantly, it spread over a radius of more than 1,000 meters and covered the whole area. Second Holy Master was stuck in it.

Then, Jian Wushuang activated Slaughter Domain and Sword Sea.

The three skills combined and released their strength.

Immediately, the Blood River tumbled and turbulent water rushed toward Second Holy Master.

Second Holy Master was in the center of the Blood River, like a boat, swaying in the endless sea.

The Triple-kill Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hands. The power of the magic weapon erupted. A Phantom Giant suddenly appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

The Phantom Giant was larger than before. As Jian Wushuang wielded the Triple-kill Sword, the towering Phantom Giant slowly swung the longsword.

“Blood Emptying Technique, the First Move.”

Shua!

The moment the huge blood-red sword light directly lashed out, the heaven and earth seemed to be split in two.

Jian Wushuang had finished his first Killing Move: Road to the Underworld, Slaughter Domain, Sword Sea, the first move of Blood Emptying Technique, and the outburst of the Triple-kill Sword.

“The power of Blood River is great. You must have depended on this Blood River to kill our seven Saint Realm experts?” Second Holy Master said indifferently. He watched the huge stroke slash toward him, then casually waved his hand.

Then a forlorn, shrill howl rang out. The huge blood-red sword light seemed to be hampered as it suddenly stopped and then shattered completely.

Second Holy Master casually broke the first Killing Move.

Jian Wushuang remained composed. The moment the sword light was smashed, a stream of great blood-red power began to gather in his palm. Soon, it reached its limit and exuded a soaring blood-red light.

“The second move of Asura Secret Skill, Bridge of Helplessness!”

As Jian Wushuang let out a cry, the surrounding air seemed to suddenly tremble.

On the edge of the Blood River, a towering long blood-red bridge suddenly appeared and extended to the end of the river at an amazing speed. Jian Wushuang stood on the bridge and walked forward. A large amount of blood-red energy gathered around his body, as if he wore a blood-red armor.

His momentum improved to a new level. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When it reached its peak, the Phantom Giant waved its muscular arms and struck a blow. This stroke was much more powerful than the previous one.

After Bridge of Helplessness made his momentum reach the peak, Jian Wushuang displayed the second move of the Blood Emptying Technique, which was his second Killing Move.

“Ridiculous,” Second Holy Master sneered.

A terrifying power instantly gathered in his palm. Then he clenched his fist and threw a punch.

The punch was like a huge meteor as it violently collided with the sword shadow.

Then the powerful sword shadow was smashed again.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was surrounded by a Force of Gale and Thunderbolt. His body changed into lightning, easily flashing through the air to appear at Second Holy Master’s side. Then he threw two Golden Purple Light Beads at the elder.

The two Golden Purple Light Beads landed, less than two meters away from Second Holy Master.

“Demonic Grenade?”

Second Holy Master’s expression eventually changed.

“Explosion!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

The two Demonic Grenades directly exploded.
