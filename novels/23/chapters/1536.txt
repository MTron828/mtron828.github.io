Chapter 1537: Last Chance!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

As soon as Real God Wu Bei finished his speech, he destroyed the hopes of more than ninety-nine percent of the Universe Gods.

Afterall, although there were more than a hundred thousand Universe Gods present, there were only a hundred Universe Gods with the fighting capabilities to make it into the Universe God ranking list.

Of course, after knowing the content of the second test, those Universe Gods did not hold anymore hope.

“Let’s begin.”

Real God Wu Bei signaled the start of the test.

Boom!

Frightening, destructive aura burst forth abruptly. Under the observation of numerous eyes, the God Destroying King walked over slowly.

It was obvious that he planned to be the first one to take the test.

In no time, he entered one of the space passages.

Everyone in the open space was also waiting silently.

As for what the God Destroying King had come across in the space passage, only Real God Wu Bei knew about it.

After a long time, the God Destroying King finally emerged from the space passage.

After that, the Universe Gods in the Universe God ranking list entered the space passages in succession.

Even though they knew that did not have not much hope, they still did their best in the test. However, it was obvious that the time that they stayed in the space passage could hardly be compared to the God Destroying King.

In less than two hours’ time, most of the geniuses in the Universe God ranking list had gone into the space passage.

At that moment…

“Duan Lingfeng, it’s our turn now,” Jian Wushuang took a glance at Duan Lingfeng who was beside him.

“Give it your all,” Duan Lingfeng said indifferently.

“Definitely,” Jian Wushuang grinned and the both of the moved immediately.

When the two of them appeared in front of two separate space passages, it caused everyone at the open space to be in uproar.

“It’s Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng!”

“The two of them actually plan to go together. Could it be that they wish to use this test to have a showdown?”

“That’s highly possible!”

“They are second and third on the Universe God ranking list respectively. However, there is still a debate going on regarding their abilities. Now, are they finally going to challenge one another?”

The Universe Gods present were all filled with excitement.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng did not disappoint those Universe Gods and both of them entered their respective space passages.

Swoosh!

With a glowing light, Jian Wushuang appeared in a vast, dark void and in front of him stood ten ice figures.

When they saw the Jian Wushuang appearing, the ten ice figures opened their eyes instantly. With a flash of murderous intent, then headed toward Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Ten of them?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted slightly and his Soul Power burst forth at once, forming a giant, golden Divine Ape.

When Jian Wushuang activated his Divine Power, eighteen shadows appeared at the same time.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Jian Wushuang went all-out and fought the ten ice figures with lightning speed.

As he fought, he realized that the abilities of the ten figures were increasing continuously.

“The second test is quite similar to the Lineage of Star’s Supreme Tower. The only difference is that the Supreme Tower has some restrictions and I am unable to display my full fighting capabilities. For this test, I can unleash my full abilities,” Jian Wushuang giggled. By relying on his own martial art motion and Sword Principles, combined with his Soul Power, Jian Wushuang fought against the ten ice figures.

Time passed by…

In the open space, numerous Universe Gods were waiting quietly.

After some time, a shadow appeared from one of the space passages.

“It’s Duan Lingfeng!”

“Duan Lingfeng has come out. But Jian Wushuang is still inside the space passage?”

The Universe Gods present all started to have a puzzled expression.

Duan Lingfeng also raised his eyebrows.

However, in two breaths of time after Duan Lingfeng was sent out from the space passage, Jian Wushuang also left the space passage.

“Jian Wushuang, you have won,” Duan Lingfeng looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I have only stayed inside for two breaths of time longer than you. Moreover, I am only able stay inside slightly longer due to my martial art motion. In this test, my martial art motion has given me a lot of advantage while facing the ten battle puppets,” Jian Wushuang said.

What he had said was true. In a battle surrounded by enemies, martial art motion was indeed the most important.

Since he was the most proficient in martial art motion, he was able to last longer while besieged by the ten battle puppets. However, when comparing abilities, Jian Wushuang didn’t think that he was stronger than Duan Lingfeng.

“Perhaps so,” Duan Lingfeng nodded his head indifferently and did not say much.

In the blink of an eye, all the experts who were confident in their abilities had gone into the space passage to take the test.

However, the result was obvious.

The person who stayed in the space passage for the longest period of time for the second test was the God Destroying King. He had managed to stay a total of eight breaths’ time longer than Jian Wushuang, who came in second for the test.

Naturally, the God Destroying King obtained the White Blaze Fruit tree for the second test.

“Next is the third test. Since this is the last test, this also means that there is only one White Blaze Fruit tree remaining,” Real God Wu Bei chuckled. After his speech, the Universe Gods present became anxious.

The third test was their last chance!

If they were to miss this final opportunity, their journey in Wu Bei’s cave would come to an end.

“I must grasp this final opportunity!”

“This is the final White Blaze tree remaining and I must obtain it!”

A number of Universe Gods present because extremely fired up like never before.

At the very moment, even the Almighties and Real Gods from various powerhouses who were in the big hall outside the cave became anxious.

Among them, there were people who had obtained the White Blaze Fruit before. As for the three White Blaze Fruit trees, which were the most valuable treasures in Wu Bei’s cave, they had never obtained one before.

“Universe Gods, the third test is a bit special. Are all of you ready?” Real God Wu Bei looked down at the Universe Gods below him with interest.

Many Universe Gods in the open space clenched their fists tightly and their eyes were glowing brilliantly. They had already finished their preparations for the third test.

“Since all of you are ready, let the third test… begin.”

Real God Wu Bei laughed strangely. In the next moment, a thick white light appeared from the edge of the third level. The white light was extremely beautiful. It looked as if it possessed an infinite amount of magical power and it covered the open space quickly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Naturally, the Universe Gods in the open space were also shrouded by the white light.

“What… what is this?”

“Is this white light a spell?”

“It’s a spell. Furthermore, it’s a very wonderful spell.”

Quite a number of Universe Gods were muttering to themselves. However, in a split second, many of them realized that the scenery around them had started to change. At the same time, their eyes seemed to have become tired and they closed involuntarily as if they were about to sleep. However, their consciousness was still awake.

Swoosh! The universe changed.

When everyone opened their eyes again, they realized that they had appeared in an endless black corridor.
