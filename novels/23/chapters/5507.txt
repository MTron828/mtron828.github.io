Chapter 5506: What Wu Zuo Said Was True

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation       Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Now, having successfully integrated the complete state of harmony, he directly reached the peak-level of tier 5. It probably wouldn’t take much longer for him to advance to tier 6.

There were a series of inheritances awaiting him, and soon he would catch up to Shangs progress!

“Unconsciously, I have fallen behind so much!” Jian Wushuang, for a moment, wasn’t sure if he had fallen behind too much on his own, or if Hu Qings speed was too fast.

On the jade slip, besides the Dao Lord, there was another name that surprised him.

It was the name of Chishui, who had reached the 54th floor.

A tier 5 Emperor breaking through to the 54th floor represented breaking through four layers.

Among the rankings of tier 5 Emperors, the one who had broken through the most was not the Inheritor Chishui, but a tier 5 Emperor from within the Elder Palace.

As for tier 6 Emperors, there were very few who could achieve a breakthrough.

The strongest individual, having only broken through one layer, was Tie San, the mentor of Si Tian. He was also one of the people Jian Wushuang planned to kill this time.

Of course, he was not a match; he only needed to seriously injure the other party, and Wu Zuo would secretly arrange for the opponent’s demise.

Then, Jian Wushuang saw the list at the top.

It was the number of floors broken through by supreme-peak experts.

Surpassing the 60th floor already classified one as a supreme-peak expert.

However, since the Beiwang Tower was brought to the Elder Palace, only a few supreme-peak experts had managed to break through.

It wasn’t too surprising. Speaking of the Elder Palace, there were only four supreme-peak experts.

Even if the supreme-peak experts from the outside world were added, it would probably still be only a few.

What puzzled Jian Wushuang was that among the supreme-peak experts in the Elder Palace, only Wu Zuo appeared on the list, and he was ranked first.

Soon, Jian Wushuang understood.

Initially, when Wu Zuo dared to confront the formidable Chang Feng head-on, those words turned out to be true.

The three palace masters were quite cunning, knowingly weaker than Wu Zuo in strength, yet they let Wu Zuo alone challenge the trials.

Even if Wu Zuo successfully passed, he would still be just a Hall Master.

Invisibly, the three Palace Masters divided the awe-inspiring effect among themselves.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Even if a Hall Master was this powerful, how would those Inheritors and the native Emperors think?

74th floor.

Wu Zuo smoothly broke through four layers.

Some other supreme-peaks, let alone breaking through, were still on the 60th floor.

The further they went, the harder it was to break through!

Each step required a significant improvement in strength.

Truly, it was unknown how Emperor Jueyun accomplished it back then.

Jian Wushuang didnt dwell on those thoughts and proceeded directly.

He wanted to break all these rules and show those people who the future strong ones were.

Swish!

After entering the teleportation array, he directly activated the token and entered the first floor of the Beiwang Tower.

Jian Wushuangs figure seemed to traverse beyond a universe, reappearing on a desolate planet.

This desolate planet had a powerful gravity and was exceptionally tough, comparable to an Innate Treasure.

How many Innate Treasures could this entire planet exchange for?

Jian Wushuang was somewhat excited.

His old habit acted up again.

When he saw precious treasures, he couldn’t resist taking detours.

Splash!

On the opposite side, a shadow condensed from black mist appeared.

“Cultivator, defeat me to enter the next level of the tower! The powerful figure formed by the black mist seemed to be an ordinary Dao Lord.

Jian Wushuang didn’t pay any attention to it. He was more interested in this barren planet.

“Please enlighten me!”

Boom!

The dark mist expert wasted no time and charged forward.

The opponent wielded six sharp knives as their treasures, emitting a fierce aura.

For an ordinary Dao Lord, facing such a foe might not be easy.

However, for Jian Wushuang, the adversary was no different from an ant. “Too slow!” Jian Wushuangs words had just fallen when he vanished in an instant.

If he didn’t want to play around, he could have effortlessly claimed victory with just a glare.

Crack!

Jian Wushuangs swift chop shattered the black mist.

Afterward, his figure disappeared from the original spot.

Upon reappearing, it was the same location.

“No changes?” Jian Wushuang swept his gaze around. Since there were no apparent alterations, why teleport him away?

Was it a spatial transformation?

Jian Wushuang brushed through nine layers of space but found no issues, so he dismissed further thoughts.

The subsequent journey was a breeze, annihilating everything in his path.

For the first ten levels, he personally took action on the first, and thereafter, just a hint of his aura would overwhelm the opponents.

Next came the breakthrough.

Jian Wushuangs Thought power entered the token, adding 1,000 points and granting 10 opportunities to comprehend the Universe Origin Source.

He didn’t yet understand the purpose of those points, but the chance to comprehend the Universe Origin Source was extraordinary.

For Jian Wushuang, it was a significant temptation.

In the Skysight Heavenly Chessboard, though there were numerous chess pieces shaped by the Universe Origin Source, he lacked the strength to copy them.

He could only mimic those pieces marked with military ranks, which were not true manifestations of the Universe Origin Source or were pre-made versions.

Now, they didn’t provide much assistance to him anymore.

He was prepared to explore the Universe Origin Source within the Beiwang Tower, curious about its nature.

Buzz!

The desolate planet finally underwent some changes.

Above, it was no longer a barren expanse; instead, numerous peculiarly shaped stones emerged.

“Cultivator, encountering me means your strength surpasses that of a Dao Lord. You’re impressive!” The black mist once again condensed into a formidable figure.

However, in his hands, there were still six sharp knives.

“Now that you qualify, learn my title….”

Jian Wushuang, however, furrowed his brows and cut off the opponent with a Sword Qi.

Initially curious, he became pressed for time later on, eagerly wanting to explore the Universe Origin Source within Beiwang Tower.

Therefore, he didn’t give the other a chance to speak.

In the moment of defeating his opponent, all the strong individuals who had passed through Beiwang Tower received a message.

Dao Lord: Jian Wushuang, reached the 12th floor.

Inside the grand hall of the negative first floor of Beiwang Tower.

Not many paid attention. A Dao Lord breaking through the initial floors was normal, nothing to be astonished about.

However, one person stood up directly.

Then, he looked at a tier 5 Emperor sitting beside him, shocked, “Is he a Dao Lord?”

“What, couldn’t you tell?” Wanyan revealed a faint sneer.

The astonished person was Tianxi Emperor, a peak-level tier 4 expert.

When he first saw Jian Wushuang, he thought the latter was a weak tier 5 Emperor. He never expected Jian Wushuang to be a Dao Lord. That misunderstanding was quite significant.

A Dao Lord with the aura of a tier 5 Emperor, wouldn’t that mean…

“Brother Wanyan, why didn’t you say it earlier!” Tianxi regretted a bit.

Such a heaven-defying Dao Lord should have been known on the Grave God Mountain!

How come he had no recollection at all?

“Jian Wushuang?” Later, Tianxi thought of a name and exclaimed, “Is it him? Then it makes sense.”

With the increase of Inheritors, Jian Wushuangs name gradually faded on the Grave God Mountain. It was normal not to remember for a while..
