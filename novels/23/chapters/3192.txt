Chapter 3194: Unwilling Duan Lang

——

“Carefree mansion?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Carefree mansion is the overlord of the Second Heaven. It’s one of the most powerful sects in the Second Heaven. There are more than a dozen Principles Masters. It’s considered a top force even in the entire Divine Beginning Realm,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Overlord of the Second Heaven? I remember that the Supreme Emotion Valley is also an overlord of the Second Heaven. I wonder which is stronger, carefree mansion or the Supreme Emotion Valley?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“In terms of foundation, the Supreme Emotion Valley is deeper. However, in terms of overall strength in this era, Carefree mansion should be stronger than the Supreme Emotion Valley,” Temple Master Bai Xing replied.

“However, the Supreme Emotion Valley has an extremely special divine skill, and there is also an old valley master who has cultivated this divine skill. That old valley master is very difficult to deal with. If he really goes crazy, even in our Temporal Temple, only the temple master can suppress him. Therefore, because of this old valley master, the Supreme Emotion Valley is more terrifying than the Carefree mansion in many people’s eyes.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He had heard of the old valley master of the Supreme Emotion Valley.

It was said that even the three Saint Realms did not want to provoke the Supreme Emotion Valley, which showed how terrifying the old valley master was.

“Master Xiaoyao of the Carefree mansion should also go to the Blood Wave Realm. You might meet him there, but with your current strength, you should be able to deal with him. As for the Carefree mansion behind him, you don’t have to care about it. It may be powerful in the eyes of others, but it’s nothing in front of the Temporal Temple,” Temple Master Bai Xing said directly.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

Indeed, no matter how strong Xiaoyao Mansion was, it was only an overlord in the Second Heaven. If it was in the Third Heaven, it would probably be inferior to the four divine clans and the eight directions celestial sect. However, the Temporal Temple…it was one of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning Realm, and it had many experts and was extremely united.

Compared to a behemoth like the Temporal Temple, the Xiaoyao mansion was indeed nothing.

In terms of background, Jian Wushuang was obviously more powerful than Master Xiaoyao.

“I understand. In that case, I’ll go and make preparations.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After saying this, Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

After Jian Wushuang left, Temple Master Bai Xing immediately gave an order to give Jian Wushuang the last spot to enter the Blood Wave Realm.

…

In the northern area of the huge space-time island, there was a huge building complex.

This building complex was where many experts of the Temporal Temple lived, and it was located in one of the exquisite mansion secret skills.

Buzz buzz buzz! A large amount of dim light gathered together, and an extremely majestic destructive aura filled the entire secret room.

In the center of the secret room, a purple-haired youth sat cross-legged. Suddenly, his eyes opened, and a flash of light instantly burst out.

This bright light was like lightning, piercing through the void.

“It’s done!”

“Before the Blood Wave Realm opened, I finally cultivated that secret technique to the great success stage!”

“Haha, the heavens are really helping me!”

The purple-haired young man let out an ecstatic laugh that reverberated in the secret chamber. However, because the secret chamber was surrounded by magic arrays, the voice did not spread out.

After a long while, the purple-haired young man seemed to have calmed down slightly.

He was still sitting upright, but his hands were tightly clenched.

“This secret technique is powerful, but it is extremely difficult. I originally thought that unless I broke through to become a Principles Master, it would be impossible for me to cultivate it to great success. However, it seems that I have still underestimated myself!”

“Now that I’ve mastered this secret technique, my strength has skyrocketed. I’m afraid that I can face a True Invincible Saint head-on. Among the five people from the spacetime temple who are heading to the Blood Wave Realm this time, Di Hao is the most terrifying and the best among the Invincible Saints. Right now, I’m not qualified to challenge him. However, although Qian Hongzi is also an Invincible Saint, I’m not much weaker than him now!”

“As for the remaining two, they haven’t become Invincible Saints yet. Although they were slightly stronger than me before, now that I’ve mastered this secret technique, they’re definitely not my match!”

“In other words, my strength is no longer at the bottom of the five!”

The purple-haired young man was still extremely excited.

Right at this moment…

“Duan Lang!” A voice suddenly sounded out.

The purple-haired young man’s expression changed, and he immediately stood up and walked out.

In the void outside the estate, a black-clothed old man stood there calmly.

“Lord Hunyuan.” The purple-haired young man, which was Duan Lang, respectfully bowed to the black-clothed old man.

“Duan Lang, I’ve come this time with an order that palace master white star has just issued regarding the Blood Wave Realm,” the black-clothed old man said.

“Regarding the Blood Wave Realm? Have the five spots been given?” Duan Lang smiled.

The black-robed elder’s expression was very cold. “As usual, there are still five people from our Temporal Temple who have entered the Blood Wave Realm this time, but…”

“But what?” Duan Lang looked over.

“You’re not among the five spots,” the black-robed elder said.

“What?” Duan Lang’s expression immediately changed. “Lord Hunyuan, you’re joking, right?”

“Among the top Immortal Saints of our spacetime temple, there are only five who have enough potential and strength to head to the blood wave world. I should be one of them.”

“I’m not joking with you. You’re indeed not one of the five spots. This is the list given by Hall Master Bai Xing himself. Take a look for yourself.” The black-clothed elder waved his hand and took out a list.

Duan Lang immediately took it and began to read it.

There were five names on the name list. Duan Lang was very familiar with the first four names and was not surprised, but the last name…

“Heavenly Sword Marquis? Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Duan Lang widened his eyes. “Hall Master Bai Xing actually gave the spot that belongs to me to this Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“How can this be!”

Duan Lang immediately roared, “I refuse to accept this!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis was able to kill a rank seven True Saint in front of a rank four True Saint. I admire his talent and potential, and I’m ashamed to admit that I’m inferior to him. However, just his talent and potential are far from enough to enter the Blood Wave Realm. He also needs absolute strength. Heavenly Sword Marquis doesn’t have such strength. How can he enter the Blood Wave Realm?”

“Duan Lang, are you doubting Palace Master Bai Xing?” The black-clothed old man coldly glanced at Duan Lang.

“No, I don’t dare.” Duan Lang immediately shook his head, but his gaze still turned scarlet. “But this matter, Palace Master Bai Xing has indeed done unfairly!”
