Chapter 1044: Unleashing Full Speed

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What’s wrong, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory? Why haven’t you overtaken him yet?” Even Celestial Master Dong Ming of the Ancient Demon Clan had to contact him.

“I underestimated him. I didn’t think he’d be this good at running. He’s faster than ordinary Celestial Masters,” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory replied.

“I see. No wonder I’m increasingly falling behind Jiu Jian in my perception despite using all my strength.” Dong Ming felt relieved.

“Rest assured. He has some extraordinary tricks up his sleeve but he’s dreaming if he thinks he can outrun me.” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory snorted. Secret black patterns emerged all over his skin, engulfing him.

These patterns soon covered his entire body. With a flick of his sleeve, a pair of immense black wings burst forth from these patterns.

Even Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s body began to experience changes and he turned into a large bat in a flash.

The real form of both Empyrean Patriarch and Di Yan was Sky-devouring Bat.

Emperor of Flames could return to his original form with a secret skill but Patriarch of Empyrean Glory needed only to trigger his Bloodline Power to achieve the same. Once he returned to his original self, his speed would increase sharply.

“Swoosh!”

An ear-piercing neighing sound resounded in the air.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s large black wings abruptly clapped and his body turned into a black mirage in a violent manner.

He was now several times faster than before.

When Jian Wushuang used the first Dragon Blood Secret Skill, his speed was comparable to Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s. That was why, even after the latter had pursued him for four hours, their distance didn’t diminish at all.

But now, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was visibly closing in onto Jian Wushuang.

Suddenly, Gu King’s voice resounded. “Jian Wushuang!”

“Sky-devouring Bat?” Jian Wushuang’s expression abruptly changed after noticing that Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was increasingly close behind.

“The Sky-devouring Bat has the advantage in terms of speed. Patriarch of Empyrean Glory is also much stronger than his son. He relies solely on his Bloodline Power to maintain his true form. If his speed explodes, he’ll be so much faster than his son. He’ll catch up to you in no time if this continues,” Gu King said in a gloomy voice.

“Looks like I have no other choice.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed and in the next moment, his already raging Spiritual Power burned even more intensely.

Earlier, the burning rate of his Spiritual Power was still within acceptable limits. Coupled with Gu King’s recovering capability and elixirs that heal Spiritual Powers, he would be able to endure for a very long time.

His Spiritual Power now burned at a frantic speed.

This was the second level of his Dragon Blood Secret Skill!

Both levels required him to pay the price of burning his Spiritual Power, but the speed that the second level provided was tenfold that of the first level!

“Whoosh!”

Jian Wushuang streaked across the Void instantly. The naked eye wouldn’t be able to capture even his shadow.

The killing intent in Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s eyes surged dangerously high. He was so close to catching up to Jian Wushuang but all of a sudden… Jian Wushuang’s speed increased sharply, this time about tenfold! In a second, their distance was widened until they were several thousand miles apart. To make things worse, the distance was still widening at a terrifying speed.

In no time at all, Jian Wushuang had completely disappeared from his sight.

“Impossible!”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was truly startled this time.

He had been shocked when Jian Wushuang’s speed increased tenfold, but now there was another tenfold increase! What kind of development was this? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Hundredfold increase!

There was a whooping hundredfold increase in his speed!

What a formidable secret skill!

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory immediately called for Celestial Master Dong Ming. “Hurry up and tell me the brat’s location!”

Jian Wushuang had disappeared from his sight with such a simple show of tricks. Without Dong Ming showing him in the right direction, he would have been completely lost.

“What happened? Don’t tell me that Jian Wushuang shook you off?” Dong Ming asked doubtfully.

“Stop with the questions. Just tell me his location.” The eyes of Patriarch of Empyrean Glory were alarmingly red. He was unwilling to admit the truth.

“I am a Sky-devouring Bat at the Holy Master level. Although I exerted myself in the state of my original form, I still lost track of an Eternal Realm brat.

Everyone in the Samsara Continent would be laughing their heads off if they found it out.”

Dong Ming asked no further and faithfully relayed Jian Wushuang’s location.

“I refuse to believe he can use his incredible Secret Skill which boosts up his speed greatly without paying a steep price!”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s killing intent was so strong that it was overflowing. Under Dong Ming’s guidance, he continued to chase after Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang successfully threw Patriarch of Empyrean Glory off his trail, but he knew this situation wouldn’t last for long.

The price for invoking the second level of Dragon Blood Secret Skill was much steeper than the price for the first. He wouldn’t be able to soldier on for much longer.

“Jian Wushuang, your Spiritual Power is burning too quickly for my recovering capability to catch up,” Gu King said in a low voice.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a grim expression. “Even with Gu King’s help, I could at most exert the second level of Dragon Blood Secret Skill for an hour!”

One hour was sufficient in a close quarters combat.

Yet it was pathetically short for when he needed to run.

His Spiritual Power would be thoroughly exhausted in an hour and he would then lose all ability to fight back.

“So much time has passed but Jiu Xiu is still hanging on.” Jian Wushuang lamented.

His initial plan was to buy himself time to use the restriction methods of the Sword Mountain to torment Jiu Xiu and get the latter to reveal his mother’s whereabouts. Once he got the outcome he wanted, he would behead Jiu Xiu and escape using the Dragon Blood Secret Skill.

Once Jiu Xiu lost the mysterious crack for guidance, he could stand a good chance to escape successfully.

Who would have thought Jiu Xiu would have such exceptional endurance?

“Jiu Xiu has a strong consciousness, perhaps due to his reincarnation,” Gu King said solemnly.

Jian Wushuang’s expression shifted. “Strong consciousness?”

He had fully unleashed the might of his Sheer Shadow sword, which contained a strong consciousness attack, on Jiu Xiu earlier. However, Jiu Xiu remained unaffected clearly showed that he had exceptional consciousness.

The restriction methods of the Sword Mountain were terrifying but most were targeted at the consciousness, where they would cause a violent pain in the target’s mind.

Ordinary Dao Masters would have collapsed under such torment but Jiu Xiu had continued to soldier on.
