“Today, I’ll go through Ninth Kalpa to prove my Supreme great Dao!”

Under the endless celestial light, the Ninth Kalpa King, who was sitting cross-legged on the peak of the mountain, suddenly opened his eyes. In his eyes, countless divine patterns derived from the great Dao circulated. His aura and divine power suddenly began to transform. At a speed visible to the naked eye, it began to become stronger, and then he stepped toward a completely different place.

“Whoosh!”

A ray of golden light, with the Ninth Kalpa King as the center, suddenly shot out and connected the heaven and earth!

!!

At this moment, countless great Daos evolved, countless divine powers circulated, countless celestial halos descended, countless colorful clouds filled the air, and countless stars shone. It was as if an ancient Celestial King had descended.

“Supreme martial artist, complete!”

A low voice came out of the Ninth Kalpa King’s mouth.

The next moment, they saw the Ninth Kalpa King stand up in the endless immortal radiance.

Between heaven and earth, a roar that shook the nine heavens and ten lands was heard, as if the firmament was celebrating for the Ninth Kalpa King.

“You may leave.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Ninth Kalpa King shook his head. Suddenly, his words were followed by principles, and the strange phenomenon in the entire sky began to dissipate.

A moment later, the world returned to its clear state.

The Ninth Kalpa King stood on the peak of the mountain with his hands behind his back. His white clothes fluttered in the mountain wind, and he remained silent for a long time.

More than forty chaos cycles had passed!

He, the Ninth Kalpa King, had been stuck at the level of an Ultimate Ruler for more than forty chaos cycles!

No one could understand his feelings. What ‘number one Ruler’, what ‘comparable to a Supreme’, he, the Ninth Kalpa King, had never cared about these titles.

From the beginning to the end, what he wanted was to break through to the Supreme martial artist realm!

And today, the Ninth Kalpa King had finally fulfilled his long-cherished wish and achieved the supreme seat!

From then on, no matter how big the universe was, he, the Ninth Kalpa King, would be invincible and look down on all directions!

“Master…”

Looking at the Ninth Kalpa King, First Slave could not help but burst into tears. If there was only one person in the world who could feel the Ninth Kalpa King’s feelings, it would be First Slave.

He had accompanied the Ninth Kalpa King for as many years as the Ninth Kalpa King had been trapped at the Ruler level. He was filled with loyalty and had never changed.

Just as he was about to walk up and say something to the Ninth Kalpa King, he saw the Ruler Blood Wave pat his shoulder and smile. “First Slave, let your master calm down for now.”

Hearing this, first servant was stunned for a moment before he nodded.

After nearly half an incense’s time, the Ninth Kalpa King finally let out a breath of turbid air. His mood calmed down, and a smile hung on his face.

Ruler Blood Wave, Jian Wushuang, Divine Marquis Qingfeng…the Ninth Kalpa King glanced around and greeted everyone.

“Congratulations!”

“Congratulations!”

“Congratulations!”

Everyone responded with a smile.

Ninth Kalpa King nodded, then his eyes fell on Jian Wushuang’s face again. With a smile on his face, he strode toward Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, the Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes were bright and his body was surrounded by immortal radiance. He was like a piece of unpolished jade, and his whole person was filled with a sense of flawlessness.

“Jian Wushuang, I was thinking of fighting you after you reached the realm of the Ultimate Ruler. Now, it seems that I have to go first.” The Ninth Kalpa King said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang felt that it was a pity. The two of them were perfect-level creatures. Whether it was their super power or their comprehension of the universe principles, there was not much difference between them. If they could fight at the level of an Ultimate Ruler, it would definitely improve the two of them greatly.

“It’s fine. Wait for me. We’ll fulfill this promise after I reach the supremacy stage.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with determination as he replied.

“Alright!” The Ninth Kalpa King nodded with a smile.

Rumble!

At this moment, the sky suddenly changed, and a huge human face appeared.

The Daoist’s face was filled with wrinkles, and his eyes were turbid. This was none other than Supreme Gai Fu.

“Ninth Kalpa, come to the Supreme shrine quickly. Leave behind the Supreme mark and become the new Supreme of the Divine Life Palace.” An old and indifferent voice came from the giant face.

Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King nodded and replied respectfully, “Yes.”

In the Divine Life Palace, the person the Ninth Kalpa King respected the most was naturally Supreme Gai Fu, who had brought him to the Divine Life Palace from a remote part of the universe. The reason why he had been in such a hurry to break through and prove himself over the past 40-odd chaos cycles was mainly because he did not want to disappoint Supreme Gai Fu.

Fortunately, he had finally broken through to the supreme martial artist level, and all the past events had faded away with the wind.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll come to find you later. let’s go,” the Ninth Kalpa King said. He then took a step and turned into a golden light, disappearing from everyone’s sight.

After the Ninth Kalpa King left, the crowd gradually dispersed.

As Jian Wushuang flew toward the manor, a thoughtful look flashed in his eyes.

He had just become a fifth-stage Ruler, and he would not be able to become an Ultimate Ruler for a while. There was no point in staying in the Divine Life Palace, so he might as well go out and see if he could find some opportunities.

Back in the manor, Leng Rushuang was cultivating in seclusion. Although she did not say anything about Jian Wushuang’s continuous breakthroughs, she was under great pressure.

She did not want to see the gap between her and Jian Wushuang getting bigger and bigger.

A moment later, the Ninth Kalpa King arrived as promised.

He had changed into a white robe with golden threads, which was the symbol of a Ruler in the Divine Life Palace.

“Jian Wushuang.”

The two of them sat down by the lake, a pot of hot tea was boiling in the middle, and a faint steam was rising.

The Ninth Kalpa King picked up a cup of hot tea, took a sip, and asked, “Jian Wushuang, where do you plan to go next?”

“I don’t know,” Jian Wushuang replied, “maybe he’ll go to the ancient starry sky road.”

“Oh? The ancient path of stars?” The Ninth Kalpa King raised his eyebrows and replied, “Jian Wushuang, this is such a coincidence. Speaking of which, I was also preparing to go to the ancient starry sky road to gain experience.”

Jian Wushuang thought of something and asked, “Ninth Kalpa, are you also going for the Grand Tribe Gathering?”

The Ninth Kalpa King nodded and said, “Of course. Jian Wushuang, you may not know this, but the gathering of all the Supreme experts in the universe will be held there. If you can get an entrance ticket, the reward will be great. It’s enough to cover your hundreds of millions of years of hard cultivation. It can be said that in the depths of our universe, there’s no one who doesn’t want to participate in the gathering of all clans.”

He paused.

The Ninth Kalpa King continued, “And the only chance to participate in the myriad tribes meeting is to go to the ancient road of stars. The longer you walk on the ancient road and the further you walk, the more likely you are to be selected by that Lord to enter the myriad tribes meeting. If your performance is outstanding in the myriad tribes meeting, you may have the chance to become that Lord’s preaching boy.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and asked in surprise, “Ninth Kalpa, you also know about that Lord?”

Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King put down his teacup, pondered for a moment, and said, “Regarding that lord, I went to the supreme shrine just now after I broke through to the supreme being realm. The Supreme Gai Fu told me about that lord’s name, which is a taboo existence in the universe.”
