Chapter 3104: Prince Qing

___________

“Did you sense the aura of the experts in this mansion?” Yuan Chong looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“The Sixth Prince and the Third Prince have been fighting for a long time, and I’m afraid that the result will be decided soon. To put it bluntly, it’s a competition of fists. The Third Prince is very skillful and has gathered a large number of experts under his command. The Sixth Prince had no choice but to spend a great representative to invite many experts to help him,” Yuan Chong said.

“All the experts in the mansion were invited by the Sixth Prince from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked, puzzled.

“Nearly half of them were invited from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, some from other places, but some are loyal to the Sixth Prince, such as the Purple Blood Camp, the most elite force under the Sixth Prince, and me,” Yuan Chong added.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had so many experts under his command, but the Sixth Prince had paid a great price to invite so many experts to help him. It seemed that the battle between him and the Third Prince was indeed very fierce.

Soon, Yuan Chong brought Jian Wushuang to a separate courtyard.

“Your excellency, since you accepted the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s heaven-level task, you should know what to do. I don’t need to say more. This is my message token. If you have nothing to do, I hope you can stay in the mansion. As for what to do in the mansion, you can do as you please. But once I send a message to you, I hope you can immediately appear in front of me.” Yuan Chong handed a message token to Jian Wushuang.

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded, Yuan Chong soon left.

After Yuan Chong left, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and set up a layer of restriction around the courtyard where he lived. This layer of restriction was to prevent him from being disturbed while he was meditating and cultivating.

After that, he began to cultivate quietly in the courtyard.

His strength was now in a leap period. Even if he cultivated quietly, the speed of improvement was astonishing, especially in sword principle and swordsmanship.

His Peerless Sword Manual and seven sword moves had all reached the peak of level four, but his comprehension of space-time principles and swordsmanship was comparable to that of a rank five True Saint, naturally, he could think of a way to upgrade all seven sword moves to the level of a rank five absolute art!

Time passed.

Six years passed in a row.

During these six years, the mansion was very quiet and nothing happened. Most of the experts invited back by the Sixth Prince were still abiding by the rules in the mansion and no one messed around.

Until this day…

“Buzz!”

A message token in Jian Wushuang’s interspatial ring vibrated. It was from Yuan Chong.

“Finally, something happened?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, stood up and rushed to the drill ground in the center of the mansion.

On the drill ground, Jian Wushuang found that not only him, but all the experts invited by the Sixth Prince had arrived.

There were nearly 100 people at a glance.

Among the nearly 100 people, the lowest realm was a True Saint at the peak of rank two, and there were only two of them. Most of them were between rank three and rank four True Saints.

As for rank five True Saints, there was only one who was present. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This was easy to understand. Reaching rank five was considered a high-level True Saint. If one reached rank six, he could even be called a top True Saint.

In the True Martial Kingdom, even the strongest founder only had the cultivation of a rank six True Saint. There were only a few rank five True Saints in the entire True Martial Kingdom. Although the Sixth Prince offered a lot of rewards and costs, the rewards he offered were hard to tempt some rank five True Saints and above.

It was already his luck to have a rank five True Saint invited by him.

“So many people are gathered here. I wonder what they are going to do?” Jian Wushuang stood in the crowd. He was a rank three True Saint, so he did not stand out among the many True Saint experts on the drill ground.

Suddenly…

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three figures suddenly landed in the center of the drill ground.

The one on the left of the three was the red-robed elder, Yuan Chong. However, Yuan Chong was standing behind the other two respectfully.

The two people were a man and a woman.

The man was young but extremely handsome. He was wearing a luxurious long robe and had his hands behind his back. He gave off the aura of a superior.

As for the woman, she was dressed rather plainly. However, even her plain clothes could not hide her beautiful face. Moreover, her noble aura was enough to make people dream about her. This woman was indeed extremely mesmerizing.

When many people present saw that woman, they could not help but raise their throats.

“Everyone, let me introduce to you. These two are the Sixth Prince and the Qing Prince!” Yuan Chong opened his mouth to introduce.

“Qing Prince?”

“Is she Qing prince? Indeed, she lives up to her name.”

Immediately, a wave of whispers sounded around them.

Although they were all invited by the Sixth Prince, and the Sixth Prince was likely to be the next king of the Zhen Wu Kingdom, at this moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on the Sixth Prince Qing, no one cared about the Sixth Prince.

Jian Wushuang could not help glancing at the Sixth Prince Qing.

He had stayed in the mansion for six years. Although he rarely interacted with others, he knew that among the people who supported the Sixth Prince’s faction, there were many experts, as well as the princess of the Zhen Wu Kingdom, who was the Sixth Prince Qing, moreover, Prince Qing was also famous for her beauty in the Zhen Wu Country.

“Ah Qing, those powerful warriors who have been invited by me are all here. You can choose some yourself.” The Sixth Prince said.

“Yes.” Prince Qing nodded slightly. Immediately, she started to walk among the crowd.

The surrounding people looked at her with fervent eyes.

“You!”

“You!”

Princess Qing stretched out her hand and pointed at the cultivators in the crowd. She pointed at 10 people before she stopped.

“The 10 people I just pointed at, come out,” Princess Qing said coldly.

The 10 people she pointed at immediately stood out one after another. Among them, Jian Wushuang was surprisingly one of them.

Looking at the 10 people in front of him, the Sixth Prince frowned and said, “Ah Qing, let’s change the batch. The 10 people you picked are all too weak.”

What the Sixth Prince said was the truth, because the ten people chosen by Prince Qing, including Jian Wushuang, were only rank three True Saints, but there was not even a rank four True Saint.

Although most of the hundreds of experts on the drill ground were rank three True Saints, there were at least 20 rank four True Saints.

“No need. I didn’t go out this time to fight. These ten people are enough to escort me,” Prince Qing insisted.
