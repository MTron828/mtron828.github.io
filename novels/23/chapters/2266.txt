2267 Wounded

In the battlefield, before the eyes of many, Jian Wushuang was being pushed back.

Despite that, Jian Wushuang seemed relatively calm.

“I trained in the Sword Doctrine Trial Tower for a thousand years and reached Initial Success with my Sword Principle. But Bing Shan’s Saber Principle at his pinnacle period is unfathomable. Even with the restrictions placed on the earth, he is still so much stronger than I had expected. His Saber Principle should be at Great Achievement, maybe near Complete Satisfaction by now,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Sabre Principle, Great Achievement, was the level Bing Shan could demonstrate.

It may be slightly higher than Jian Wushuang, but Jian Wushuang knew deep inside that the small differences added up to a too big difference.

“His arrogant sabre skills have completely suppressed me, I can only block him, but that way I cannot find a way to fight back if that’s the case...” Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold.

“If resisting is not the way, I guess I need to fight fire with fire!”

Hua!

Jian Wushuang pulled out his sword at lightning speed as the Blood Mountain Sword cut a certain curvature across the Void, like a ghost moving in the air.

The sword was flexible and went straight for Bing Shan’s throat.

Jian Wushuang did not bother blocking Bing Shan’s arrogant sabre and let it strike at him.

Dang!

The sabre struck Jian Wushuang’s head, and a metallic sound could be heard.

Jian Wushuang was wearing the Five Gem Armor, greatly weakening the sabre’s power. Jian Wushuang let out a pained sound but recovered instantly.

His sword light went straight for Bing Shan’s throat.

But before it pierced his throat, Jian Wushuang felt a large force of resistance surrounding Bing Shan’s body. It was invisible, but Jian Wushuang felt it.

It was formed entirely from his sabre essence.

It formed an armour of sabre essence.

“His sword only knows how to attack, but that’s not his full potential. He has a powerful protection secret skill with him, and that is how he defends!” Jian Wushuang said.

If Bing Shan only had scary attack abilities, Jian Wushuang would not be too worried.

But he has an armour formed from sabre essence as his self-defence mechanism. That would prove tough to settle.

“Die!” Bing Shan’s eyes were bloodshot and cut down towards Jian Wushuang frenzied.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened and he retreated.

As he retreated, Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Nine streaks of golden light emerged.

Those were Jian Wushuang’s nine Hong Jun Golden Swords.

Not only were they powerful, but they were fast as well, and appeared in front of Bing Shan within an instant.

And they came for Bing Shan in all directions.

“Hong Jun Golden Swords?” Bing Shan seemed to be in a frenzy, but he had absolute clarity, recognising the swords immediately.

“Haha, if you could form the first formation with those swords, you could make a dent. But you can’t even do that, and you want to block me?” Bing Shan laughed disdainfully.

His sabre did not stop.

Endless sabre light was still heading towards Jian Wushuang, and he did not block the nine Hong Jun Golden Swords.

His sabre skills only know how to attack.

Dang!

Dang!

Dang!

Dang!

Dang!

The nine Hong Jun Golden Swords struck his sabre essence armour. Without piercing him, the swords were all deflected by his armour.

“What a scary self-defence secret skill, my Hong Jun Golden Swords did nothing to it?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“Boy, I told you, don’t get cocky. You don’t even know how big the world is, and you dare prevent Lord Leng from heading towards the Absolute Beginning Divine World?”

“A joke,” Bing Shan said. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Is it?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and rushed out like a ghost.

“Cut!” Bing Shan returned to his sabre and cut down.

The dark Void was instantly split into half.

Shimmering sabre light appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank at the sight of the sabre light, but he had no intention to defend.

If blocking meant being suppressed, he would rather take the blow.

“Looking for death?” Bing Shan was enraged.

“Looking for death?”

“Haha, you are the true myopic one. Your self defence mechanisms are strong, but mine is a thousandfold better!” Jian Wushuang bellowed and allowed the sabre to cut down at him. Jian Wushuang shuddered for a moment.

Soon his sword pierced out.

An ordinary, powerless blade, but as it pierced the Void an enormous Reincarnation Power started exuding outwards.

Sword Principle... Samsara!

Bing Shan did not block it either. He had absolute confidence in his sabre essence armour.

He believed Jian Wushuang could not hurt him in any way.

As the cold blade touched his sabre essence armour, the Reincarnation Power was exuded.

It was a strange power. The sabre essence where the sword tip touched the armour started transforming – the strong sword essence from before had reverted to the sabre principle origin.

Yes, the origin!

Sabre Essence had been formed with sabre principle origin.

Under the influence of the Reincarnation Power, that small area of sabre essence reverted back to the origin.

The armour disintegrated.

“What?” Bing Shan could feel something was not right, but it was too late.

Chi!

The cold blade struck Bing Shan’s body without interference.

A hole was made in his body. It only hurt his skin and bones, nothing vital, but without a doubt, Jian Wushuang had injured Bing Shan.
