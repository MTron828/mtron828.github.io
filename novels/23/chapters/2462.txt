Chapter 2463: Divine Power Ocean

Boom...

The earth trembled and suddenly cracked open.

The ground sank at an astonishing speed right in the middle of the tomb’s inner area as majestic divine powers surged out wildly from the sunken ground.

In just a few moments, an infinite ocean of divine powers was formed.

Many genius disciples who were still staying in the tomb noticed changes on the ground.

“Has it started?”

The disciples were thrilled.

For those disciples who were only at Second-Class Divine Demon Realm, they had limited opportunities in the tomb.

They had no hope of fighting for the position tokens. Likewise, their chances to pass through any of the tests at the Abyss of Trials were also slim.

Under those circumstances, they could only try their luck.

And the only opportunity achievable within their means was the Divine Power Ocean.

“That’s the Divine Power Ocean. Let’s go there quickly,” said Ling Dan.

Those people from Ancient Star Temple, Narcissus Island, and Jian Wushuang immediately went forth.

They soon arrived in the middle of the inner area and found the grounds of the huge area had disappeared only to be replaced by a vast Divine Power Ocean. They could sense the Ancient God Divine Power surging powerfully within the ocean.

“This is the Divine Power Ocean. Its divine power is immense.”

“How generous of Crimson Stone Saint!”

“I’ve never experienced such intense Ancient God Divine Power in my life.”

Ling Dan, Zhuo Bing, and the others expressed their admiration at the sight of the ocean.

Even Jian Wushuang was startled when he saw the Divine Power Ocean.

Every single drop of Ancient God Divine Power contained pure and authentic divine powers which were extremely useful to cultivators.

One of the bounty rewards for Jian Wushuang was 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power.

10,000 drops were not a small amount. Many powerful Peak Divine Demons were unable to deliver that much power.

However, that was merely a drop in an ocean compared to the Divine Power Ocean which laid in front of their eyes.

The Ancient God Divine Power drops within must be astronomical in such a huge ocean. This could only be delivered by Crimson Stone Saint who had reached the Undying Saint level. As for other people...even with hellacious efforts by several prominent sects in Wusha Wilderness like the Great Compassion Sect, it was unlikely for them to have accumulated even one percent of the Ocean’s divine powers!

“The rule of Saint’s Tomb states that whoever owns Purple Amulets can enter this Divine Power Ocean to absorb as much Ancient God Divine Power as possible. It depends on our abilities to absorb the powers within, but we are not allowed to take divine powers out from the tomb. No one dared to violate this rule. After all, Crimson Stone Saint’s consciousness might be secretly observing our behavior,” said Ling Dan.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly but immediately asked, “Do all of you have enough Purple Amulets? I have a lot here if you need them.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

With a simple wave of his hand, dozens of Purple Amulets appeared.

Jian Wushuang had fought many genius disciples. Whether those disciples were killed or fled the tomb with their Safety Tokens, they could not take those Purple Amulets with them. Naturally, those Purple Amulets were left behind and fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands. Although Jian Wushuang previously gave some of the Purple Amulets to Ice Fire God Palace disciples, he still had a lot left.

According to the rules, one Purple Amulet was equivalent to a pass to stay in the Divine Power Ocean for one month. Jian Wushuang had enough Purple Amulets for him to stay in the Ocean for several years or even up to a decade.

He certainly did not need so many of them.

The disciples of Ancient Star Temple and Narcissus Island were delighted by his offer. They did not hesitate to take some of those Purple Amulets from Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s get started,” said Zhong Yi.

They wasted no time and directly plunged into the vast ocean one after another.

As soon as they got into the Divine Power Ocean, they could feel the strong current of Ancient God Divine Powers approaching from all directions.

“That’s a lot of divine powers. It’s enough for all of us to take in as much as we can.”

Those disciples were excited as they got started and began absorbing and refining the Ancient God Divine Powers around them each working with different techniques.

Jian Wushuang was among those disciples in the Ocean.

He wore a smile on his face as he felt the inexhaustible Ancient God Divine Powers from his surroundings.

“In fact, I’ve achieved the Divine Demon Realm a long time ago. What’s lacking is the accumulation of divine powers and now I have such an immense Ancient God Divine Power in front of me...”

“Let’s start!”

Jian Wushuang also did not waste any more time.

The pores all over his body were completely opened as a terrifying suction force instantly emerged from him.

Wham!

The wild power surges swirled around Jian Wushuang in sloshing chaos.

An infinite amount of Ancient God Divine Powers closed in around Jian Wushuang under the influence of his suction power. Jian Wushuang absorbed and refined them at an astounding speed.

He was working at a speed that was ten times faster than any First or Second-Class Divine Demons that were present.

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, and the others who were around Jian Wushuang were also focusing on absorbing as much divine power as possible.

However, all of them looked over at Jian Wushuang and they noticed the rapid current movement around him.

“Th... The speed...”

“My goodness! What a terrifying speed!”

“Usually, the higher one’s cultivation level, the faster one could absorb and refine divine power. That doesn’t seem to be applicable to Brother Wushuang. Even though I am a First-Class Divine Demon, my speed is merely one-tenth of Brother Wushuang?”

“He must be a monster!”

The disciples of Ancient Star Temple and Narcissus Island were amazed by Jian Wushuang’s abilities.

They had been taken aback countless times by the abilities and performance of Jian Wushuang since entering Saint’s Tomb.

Therefore, they were not surprised by Jian Wushuang being able to absorb and refine divine power dozens of times faster than themselves.

“With the speed which he’s working with, we’ll only be distracted if we stay too close to him. Let’s go somewhere else and leave this area for Junior Brother Wushuang,” suggested Zhong Yi.

All of them nodded in unison.

The Divine Power Ocean was huge and they had only been in a small part of it. They would not be affected if everyone around them was absorbing at similar speeds. However, Jian Wushuang was absorbing so fast that none of them could match his pace.

The divine powers would be attracted over to his side which would greatly affect the other disciples around the area.

They had no choice but to move to other areas.
