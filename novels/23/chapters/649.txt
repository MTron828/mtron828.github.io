Chapter 650: Jian Wushuang’s Cultivation Time

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Gong Chao, as long as you join our Immortal Dynasty, we will try hard to train you and ensure that you reach the Eternal Realm within 10,000 years. With luck, you may be able to do it in 3,000 years!”

“We can do that for you too, Gong Chao. What’s more, our master has planned to accept a personal disciple. Because you are so talented, that lucky guy will probably be you.” Someone from the Boundless Demon Sect chimed in.

Those two sects tried to attract Gong Chao with their offerings as well.

“The two of you!” Seeing that there were two more competitors, Shi Qianhan shouted angrily.

“What? You have made your offer, so why can’t we?” the man from the Immortal Dynasty yelled back coldly.

“Fine, I’d love to see if your conditions are really more attractive than ours.” Shi Qianhan’s voice was icy yet confident.

The competition for Gong Chao between the three sects confused the onlookers.

The other experts in the Skyward Pavilion were surprised as well. They had never seen anyone before that was wanted by all three of the magnates.

At last, Cloud Sea Asgard was victorious over the other two sects due to its irresistible offerings. Then, Gong Chao became their disciple.

The two failed sects had to give up, however unwilling they might have been.

The test of the geniuses’ cultivation ages went on.

Finally, it was Jian Wushuang’s turn.

“Next up, Jian Wushuang!”

The moment that his name was called, many people began to look at him.

As the only one who had managed to force Gong Chao to go all out, it would have been hard for him to go unnoticed.

“Now, Jian Wushuang is going to take the test. How long do you think he has cultivated?” The voice of the man from the Immortal Dynasty again echoed in the Skyward Pavilion.

“I think at least more than 2,000 years!”

“That’s too talented for him. I think it must be longer than Huo Ying.”

“Maybe. But, considering that he has gotten some opportunities to gain the Doppelganger Secret Skill, he may have relied on something other than time to gain his current power.”

Those experts chatted with each other while watching Jian Wushuang take his test.

“Mr. Xuan Yi, Jian Wushuang is your disciple. Are you really not interested in his cultivation time?” the girl from the Boundless Demon Sect asked Xuan Yi.

Those sects had promised Xuan Yi that they would give up trying to recruit all the six geniuses from the Ancient World, so in their eyes, Jian Wushuang was already a member of the Ancient Sect.

Xuan Yi laughed at the girl’s words. “Since I’ve accepted him as our inner disciple, it doesn’t matter how long he has cultivated. Even if he is more than 4,000 years old and at the day of his doom, I won’t change my mind and I’ll help him go further.”

Shi Qianhan interrupted their talk with irony in his voice. “If he is really that old, he is indeed trash in view of his current power. Does he deserve your care and help? Hmph, I’ll just say it, you are just wasting your time and resources.”

“We have nothing but time and resources in our sect, so as long as I want, I can push him up to the Eternal Realm. That’s beyond your reach, isn’t?” Xuan Yi sneered and fought back.

On hearing this, Shi Qianhan’s face darkened slightly.

It would take so many resources to push a Skyscraping Realm expert up to the Eternal Realm that only the three magnates were able to do it. However, even if they were to do that, the cost would be too high. And being just one of the Elders in Cloud Sea Asgard, Shi Qianhan was in no position to try it.

He was different from Xuan Yi.

Xuan Yi was recognized as the number one Eternal Realm expert in the Firmament Territory, second only to his master in the Ancient Sect. In addition to that, he possessed many treasures himself, so it was easy for him to achieve that.

“Whatever, if you want to waste your money, go right ahead,” Shi Qianhan said coldly. “Let’s wait and see.”

On the Drill Ground, as Jian Wushuang walked over to Elder Qiu, everyone’s eyes were fixed on him. Even Gong Chao looked at him with sharp eyes.

“Jian Wushuang.”?

He watched him closely. Jian Wushuang was the only one in the Firmament Territory Feast that he regarded as his opponent. Though he had defeated him, he still thought that Jian Wushuang had restrained his power when battling him.

When Jian Wushuang walked up to Elder Qiu, the latter ordered him in an icy voice.

“Give me a drop of your blood.”

Jian Wushuang immediately squeezed a drop of blood out from his finger.

The elder put the blood into the container and started examining it.

After being calm for several moments, the elder suddenly had a shocked expression on his face.

“How could this be... possible?” he murmured. He could not believe his eyes and then looked up at Jian Wushuang. “Please give me one more drop of your blood.”

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded and did as he had been told.

This time, the elder examined the blood with more scrutiny, but to his surprise, the result was still the same.

“It can’t be...

“This, this…”

He stared at Jian Wushuang in horror as if he was staring at a ghost.

He opened his mouth and tried to say something, but for a while, not a sound escaped his mouth.

The host saw his unusual behavior and asked with concern, “What’s the matter, Elder Qiu?”

The elder hemmed and hawed, and after taking a deep breath, he turned over to face the Skyward Pavilion and bowed. Finally, he could speak again.

“Ladies and gentlemen, Jian Wushuang’s result has come out.” His voice betrayed his astonishment, echoing throughout the whole place.

“It has been less than... 40 years since he started cultivating.”

“What?!” Everyone was startled by those words.

“Less than 40 years?!”

“And he has been in the Skyscraping Realm for less than one year.” The elder’s voice echoed again.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
