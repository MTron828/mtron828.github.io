Chapter 3796: 10,000 Years

It could not be helped. If Jian Wushuang was told that he had passed the three trials of Heaven-Treading Mountain and entered the Second Heaven, it would definitely cause a huge wave in this Star Field, moreover, Jian Wushuang would definitely be targeted by many people with ulterior motives. Although Jian Wushuang did not need to fear anything in this Star Field with his current strength, it was still better to be cautious.

Now they said that Jian Wushuang had passed the first two trials of Heaven-Treading Mountain, but it was appropriate for him to be defeated in the third trial, which was the trial at the peak.

After all, until now, no one in this Star Field except Jian Wushuang could pass the trial at the mountainside. Many cultivators in this Star Field, as strong as Ruler Kun Yu, could only struggle a little in the trial at the mountainside, and they could not pass it at all. No one in this Star Field was sure whether there was a third test on the peak.

With Jian Wushuang’s heaven-defying strength, it was acceptable for him to pass the test at the foot of the mountain and the mountainside, but he could not pass the test on the peak.

Even if some people still did not believe it, there was no need to explain too much.

“My young friend, the Red Cloud World is about to close again, but you said that you would still stay in the Red Cloud World?” Daoist Xuan God suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “The Red Cloud World is not as simple as we thought. After passing the trial of Heaven-Treading Mountain, I am qualified to enter the Red Cloud World at any time. From now on, I can stay in the Second Heaven for a long time to cultivate. Therefore, you two can return to the Star Palace without waiting outside. When you return to the Star Palace, just announce to the public that I am in closed-door cultivation,” Jian Wushuang said. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Okay.” Temporal Temple Master nodded.

“In that case, Temporal and I won’t wait for you. We’ll go back first.” The Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master laughed heartily.

The two of them already knew that Jian Wushuang had gone to the Second Heaven, and they did not have the strength to go to the Second Heaven. Therefore, they did not even bother to go to Heaven-Treading Mountain and were ready to leave the Red Cloud World.

“My young friend, how long will you stay in the Red Cloud World?” The Heaven Ancestor suddenly asked.

“I don’t know, but I don’t think it will take too long.” Jian Wushuang said calmly, “By the way, when I return from the Red Cloud World, I will bring a surprise to everyone.”

“Surprise?”

Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and the Heaven Ancestor were all surprised.

“Haha, what? Did you not only get an opportunity in the Second Heaven, but also something we can use?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said with a smile.

“Can you bring us some Supreme Treasures from the Second Heaven?” Daoist Xuan God teased.

Jian Wushuang did not say much. After chatting for a while, he ended the communication.

In the Second Heaven, Jian Wushuang put away the transmission token and shook his head with a smile.

“I’m afraid Xuan God and the others don’t know. The surprise I’m going to give them is the strongest Supreme Treasure.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Lord Wu had promised him that he could pick some Supreme Treasures to bring back before he left.

The Supreme Treasures mentioned by Lord Wu, such as the supreme-grade Supreme Treasures like the Celestial Light Wings, might not be worth his time, but it was obvious that Lord Wu did not care about ordinary Supreme Treasures, he could bring a lot of them back.

After all, Xuan God and the others did not have many Supreme Treasures.

He only needed to bring some Supreme Treasures back and let them use them. Their strength could reach a new level.

The Divine Beginning Realm and Star Palace camp would naturally be stronger.

“Continue to meditate.”

Jian Wushuang soon calmed down and continued to cultivate and meditate with the opportunity on the island of the Second Heaven.

The last ten years in the Red Cloud World soon passed.

During these ten years, there were countless experts who went to Heaven-Treading Mountain. However, except for Jian Wushuang who passed at the beginning and the Ruler Kun Yu who passed later, there was no third person who passed the test at the foot of the mountain in this Star Field, master Kun Yu had only passed the trial at the foot of the mountain, but he was easily defeated by the gatekeeper at the halfway point.

When the last ten years were up, many cultivators of the Red Cloud World left the Red Cloud World. Even if they did not want to leave, they would be sent out by the experts of the Red Cloud World.

The entire Red Cloud World immediately fell silent. It would only reappear in front of the world after hundreds of millions of years when the next Red Cloud fog tide appeared.

At least, most of the cultivators in this Star Field thought so. However, only a few people knew that Jian Wushuang had appeared in the opening of the Red Cloud World. He had directly passed the test of Heaven-Treading Mountain and entered the Second Heaven, and he had been quietly meditating in the Second Heaven all these years.

Time passed quietly like flowing water.

In a flash, the Red Cloud World had been closed for 8,000 years.

Jian Wushuang had come to the Second Heaven about 2,000 years before the Red Cloud World closed.

In other words, he had stayed in the Second Heaven for more than 10,000 years.

Over the past 10,000 years, he had been improving his strength with the help of various opportunities on the island in the Second Heaven.

With the help of these opportunities, he had made great progress.

...

In the Second Heaven, there was an open space on the island that spanned hundreds of thousands of miles. However, there were layers of pale purple restrictions on the open space.

There were nearly 20 layers of restrictions, each of which emitted a sharp aura and was stronger than the last.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in front of the first restriction and closed his eyes slightly.

“Break!”

A soft moan suddenly sounded. A terrifying sword essence suddenly burst out from Jian Wushuang’s body and rushed into the restriction in front of him, rampaging inside the restriction.

Although this was only the first restriction, which was the weakest of all restrictions, it was difficult for even a second-level master to break this restriction.

But now, under the impact of Jian Wushuang’s sword essence, the restriction quickly began to collapse.

After a moment, the first restriction completely disappeared.

“It took me 4,000 years to finally break the first restriction of Sword Principle!” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, full of surprise and joy.

4,000 years.

That was right, Jian Wushuang had spent 4,000 thoughts on this restriction.

The restriction of sword principle was a great opportunity for sword principle on the island. Each of these restrictions required a certain level of comprehension of sword principle to be able to crack. When Jian Wushuang first arrived at the restriction of sword principle, he could only crack one-tenth of the restriction of sword principle.

Over the past 4,000 years, he had gradually studied and understood it step by step. Finally, he had completely broken the first complete restriction of sword principle. Naturally, his comprehension of sword principle had also been greatly improved.
