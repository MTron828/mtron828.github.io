Chapter 1051: Blood Asura Clan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Blood Asura Clan was located on towering mountains dotted with numerous palace lofts.

It was a pleasing sight that displayed just how majestic the clan was. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Is this the home to one of four great clans-Blood Asura Clan?”

Jian Wushuang followed Su Rou into the clan, his gaze darting around to take in his surroundings.

This clan, along with the Ancient Demon Clan, was the strongest out of the four great clans.

“Asura Lord!”

“Greetings, Asura Lord!”

They stumbled across numerous clansmen along the way, all of whom possessed great physical strength. But when they saw Su Rou, they would salute her, their absolute deference coming from the bottom of their hearts.

Asura Lord was essentially an existence equivalent to an Emperor in the Blood Asura Clan.

When Jian Wushuang arrived in front of a tall mountain, he heard a whooshing sound as multiple silhouettes flitted before him in a straight line. The leader was an elderly woman dressed in a grey robe. The woman had a wizened face and graying hair on the temples, but her eyes were bright and energetic.

“Celestial Master?” Jian Wushuang’s heart jolted. He thought to himself that this was indeed one of the great clans. Their strength as a clan was truly commendable.

It must be known that Su Rou relied on the Eye of Asura to get a Celestial Master expert under her control. The existence of this elderly woman meant the clan had at least two Celestial Master experts and might even have more.

“Asura Lord.” The elderly woman made a subtle salute at Su Rou.

“Great Elder Lin Li, did something happen?” Su Rou stared at her dully.

“I heard that you left with a group of experts earlier. I wonder what’s so important that you must personally make your move,” the elderly woman, Great Elder Lin Li, inquired.

“Something happened earlier but it’s already resolved. You can rest assured, Great Elder,” Su Rou replied emotionlessly.

“Oh?” Lin Li gave a small nod and refrained from asking any further. She couldn’t help glancing at Jian Wushuang behind Su Rou. “Asura Lord, who is this person next to you?”

“He’s my brother, Jian Wushuang,” Su Rou replied.

“Greetings, Great Elder Jin Li,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Jian Wushuang?” Lin Li’s pupils shrunk. “You’re Jian Wushuang? You’re the one whom Patriarch of Empyrean Glory offered a huge reward for and offended the entire Ancient Demon Clan not long after?”

“That’s me.” Jian Wushuang gave a helpless smile.

Lin Li’s face turned grave. “Asura Lord, Jian Wushuang’s head is wanted by Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan. It won’t do our clan any favors to bring him here.”

“You worry too much, Great Elder,” Su Rou replied. “The grudge between Third Brother and Patriarch of Empyrean Glory has already been solved. Third Brother has also confronted the Ancient Demon Clan and the situation isn’t as bad as you describe it to be.”

“Is that so?” Lin Li frowned.

She had only heard about Patriarch of Empyrean Glory hunting Jian Wushuang down, but not what happened afterward.

“If you don’t have anything to add, I’ll be leaving.”

Without bothering to engage in idle chatter with Lin Li, Su Rou continued moving forward with Jian Wushuang behind her.

The two of them trod upon the Void above the Blood Asura Clan side by side. The experts under Su Rou’s control had been dismissed.

“Fourth Sister, what’s up with that woman Lin Li? There’s something odd about the way she looked at you earlier,” Jian Wushuang asked.

Lin Li appeared to be harboring complex emotions while talking to Su Rou earlier. Though she hid it well, Jian Wushuang was still able to notice it.

“It’s normal.” Su Rou laughed, looking as if she was used to it.

“Third Brother, there’s something you don’t know about our clan. Here, there are three people with the top positions and influences.”

“The first is my Master, the Supreme Elder as well as the top expert of our clan. His word carries enormous weight here and no one dares go against him.”

“The second is the woman you met earlier, Great Elder Lin Li. Being a Great Elder, she naturally commands significant authority. Moreover, my Master typically doesn’t show interest in the clan’s affairs and she’s the one who’s responsible for most things.”

“The third and last one is me.”

Su Rou smiled faintly as she continued, “Our clan attaches greater importance to bloodline purity than other clans in the Samsara Continent. In fact, at our clan’s peak many years ago, our influence envelops the entire Green Fire World and even many parts of the Ancient World. This results in the Blood Asura bloodline being found in every corner of the Green Fire World.”

“Our clan typically doesn’t concern itself with those who inherited our bloodline, allowing them to live and die as they please. They’ve even forgotten that they’re our clansmen as well. But should there someone among them who has awakened an exceptionally pure bloodline, our clan will have a way of detecting it. We will then immediately retrieve this pure-blooded clansman.”

“I’m one of those people who live in the branch families of the clan. Back when I first awakened my bloodline in the Ancient World and the Eye of Asura, the clan had also immediately detected my existence.”

“Thus, my Master came personally to retrieve me.”

“The purity level of my awakened bloodline is so high that I’m considered the one and only with such bloodline in the clan. Coupled with the Eye of Asura, my Master easily made up his mind to make me Asura Lord.”

“Asura Lord is equivalent to the position of the Emperor of the Blood Asura Clan. Under ordinary circumstances, even my Master has to listen to my orders. Naturally, Lin Li has to follow my command as well.”

Su Rou hesitated momentarily before continuing, “Before this, Lin Li basically commanded an absolute authority over the clan. However, my existence robbed her off all of her power. Of course, she wouldn’t feel happy about it and bear grievances against me.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He finally understood why Su Rou had left all those years ago and why she had become Asura Lord in just a short span of two thousand years.

“Fourth Sister, it’s been two thousand years ago since we last met. Now you’re doing far better than us three older brothers,” he said, sighing with emotion.

“Did Eldest Brother and Second Brother come to the Green Fire World as well?” Su Rou asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said, nodding. He then chuckled. “They’re now in the Tang of the East of the Void Continent. Once I’ve clarified some of my personal affairs, I’ll take you there and we can finally reunite.”

“Great.” Su Rou smiled. “Oh right! Why did you come to the Samsara Continent and even get yourself into trouble with Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan?”

“Well… Here is the thing…” Jian Wushuang gave her a brief and simple explanation.
