Chapter 2219 Reinforcements

“Damn it.”Seeing the dead bodies around him, the man in crimson armour looked dark. He looked at the man entering the room coldly.

“Who are you?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Lineage of Stars, He Xiu,” He Xiu said coldly.

“You are from Lineage of Stars?” The man in crimson armour was first stunned, before breaking out in rage.

“How dare you appear here and kill so many experts from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church?”

“You speak too much.”

He Xiu did not want to waste time speaking and attacked.

Hum!

Sword essence turned into a brilliant crimson sword river.

The crimson sword river was very attractive. It appeared in front of the man in crimson armour in a flash.

“So fast.” The man in crimson armour was shocked as he instinctively raised the battle blade he was holding to block the attack.

Clang!

A loud collision was heard as a vast amount of energy exploded beside the right arm of the man in crimson armour. He backed off quickly.

“How is this possible?”

“We are both in the realm of Sir God, but why is he so much stronger than me?”

The man in crimson armour was in disbelief as he flipped out a transmission token and requested backup.

Seeing this, He Xiu squinted his eyes. He was not angry. Instead, he was elated.

He wanted the man in crimson to ask for help.

“Die!”

He Xiu roared as he continued to attack. A continuous stream of sword essence completely suppressed the man in crimson armour.

These two sir gods started to battle it out at the centre of the town.

The peaceful town became noisy as the two started to battle.

A large amount of cultivators rose to the air to watch the battle,

“This is... a battle between almighties?”

“I recognize the man using the battle blade. He is Sir God Mo Qiu from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church. I don’t recognize the other man. However, he is very powerful as he can completely suppress Sir God Mo Qiu.”

“Real Martial Arts Divine Church’s headquarters is right around the corner. He dares to attack Sir God Mo Qiu here?”

“The experts from Real Martial Arts Divine Church should be on their way.”

Many of the cultivators chattered.

Many of the cultivators from the tarvan walked out to watch the battle,

Jian Wushuang was the only one who sat there, smiling, holding a winning trophy in his hand.

Even though he was not looking at the battlefield, his Soul Power encompassed the entire area and he could see everything clearly.

“Haha, his sword skills have improved greatly over these years,” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

He knew clearly that He Xiu was definitely a top tier Sir God and could put up a fight against emperor gods.

As for Sir God Mo Qiu, he was just an ordinary sir god. By rights, He Xiu could have killed him easily.

Of course, He Xiu was holding back and had intentionally suppressed Sir God Mo Qiu.

His purpose was simple: attract more experts from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church to come over.

Emperor God Bai Xing, who was within the Real Martial Arts Divine Church, had received the message from Sir God Mo Qiu.

“He Xiu from the Lineage of Stars came to the territory controlled by the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and is fighting Mo Qiu right now?” Emperor God Bai Xing squinted his eyes as he had a cold look. “Humph. I knew that Lineage of Stars would definitely do something when Emperor God Ling Qu disappeared in my territory. I did not expect them to come so quickly.”

“Church Master. I have heard of He Xiu. Apparently, he is a lineal disciple of the Sword Emperor and has great fighting power. Even though he is only in the realm of sir god, he can go head to head with emperor gods. With his fighting power, Mo Qiu should be in a bad spot. We should go and reinforce him quickly,” a Sir God said.

“Of course we will go and reinforce him. However, the Lineage of Stars must have some trump cards if they dare to come all the way here. He Xiu will not be the only expert, there will definitely be other experts hidden somewhere,” Emperor God said in a low voice.

“This is what we will do. The few of you will go and reinforce Mo Qiu immediately. Bring along two Blood Slaves with you. If you run into trouble, let these two blood slaves go and settle it. If they can’t, message me and I will ask the lord to help us.”

“Yes.”

The few Sir Gods nodded their heads solemnly and set off.

He Xiu and Mo Qiu were still fighting in the large town.

Naturally, Sir God Mo Qiu kept retreating.

Right when Sir God Mo Qiu could not take it anymore, three figures appeared in the distance.

“How dare you, He Xiu!”

“Humph. Even if you are from the Lineage of Stars, we will not let you leave easily when you murder someone within the Real Martial Arts Divine Church territory.”

Two yells were heard.

The surrounding cultivators heard the two yells and they understood why He Qiu dared to attack.

“So that man is from the Lineage of Stars? No wonder he dared to attack.”

“I heard that the Lineage of Stars and the Real Martial Arts Divine Church were enemies.”

While the spectators were exclaiming, the three sir gods linked up with Mo Qiu as they looked at He Xiu angrily.

“Is that all that came?” He Xiu face darkened.

“The few of us are more than enough to take care of you. Attack now, suppress him. Then, ask his master, the Sword Emperor, to come personally to collect him,” One of the sir gods said.

There was an uproar from everyone in the town.

Suppress He Xu, then ask the Sword Emperor personally to get him?

Within the Eternal Chaotic World, those who were educated all knew who the Sword Emperor was.

He was one of the most powerful men within the Eternal Chaotic World. A mere Real Martial Arts Divine Church was not qualified for the Sword Emperor to come down personally.

“Haha. His tone is really demanding,” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

At the centre of the town, He Xiu started fighting against the four sir gods from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church

Even though he had been fighting four alone, he was not afraid at all. He no longer held back and fought with all his might.

He had fought four sir gods and was still at an advantage.

He Xiu flicked his sword up as a ghostly sword light pierced the chest of one of the sir gods. There was a large wound on his chest. He was severely injured.

The four sir gods were already at a disadvantage. With one of them getting injured, their disadvantage in battle grew bigger.
