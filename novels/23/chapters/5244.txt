Chapter 5246: Treasure Hall

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At that time, he could also break through the Ninth Revolution and become a Perfected Nine Revolutions expert.

His strength at that time was probably much stronger than an average half- step Emperor.

“Interesting!” Jian Wushuangs eyes gleamed.

Seemingly understanding Jian Wushuangs thoughts, Ji Chaoyang didn’t bother him anymore. He took Hu Qing back to the Northern City. They were assigned to a city wall, providing mutual support for each other.

After bidding farewell to the two, Jian Wushuang stepped on the black shining slabs and entered a palace.

In the City Lord’s Manor, there were four main halls.

The Treasure Hall was just one of them, storing a large number of treasures that were extremely useful for Grand Yan Immortals.

Upon entering the hall, a change occurred.

There were still a few Grand Yan Immortals passing by just now, but once they entered the interior, not a single person could be seen.

Jian Wushuang speculated that they had entered a spatial layer; this palace had been divided into countless layers.

It was impossible to encounter anyone else; each person entered a unique layer.

Jian Wushuang had seen this kind of method before. Such a peculiar palace could only be created when the origin source of space reached an extremely high level.

After entering the hall, he looked around.

Inside the grand hall, it was empty and didn’t look like it contained any treasures.

On the main position in the hall, there was only a green bottle, and nothing

Puff, puff-

Jian Wushuang had just taken a step forward when a green smoke emerged from the green bottle in front of him.

The fist- sized bottle eventually released a few feet worth of green smoke, ultimately transforming into a scale-armored exotic beast. However, looking

at its face, Jian Wushuang could tell that the creature was very old.

Its face had several wrinkles, and the scales on its neck were somewhat shedding.

“Tsk tsk, young man, I can sense that there are many treasure points on you!’

Jian Wushuang didn’t dare to be careless and respectfully said, “Senior, I am Jian Wushuang, a trial participant from the Qishen Temple. I have come to exchange for treasures.”

This elderly creature seemed to have lived for countless years, and Jian Wushuang dared not underestimate him.

“Not in a hurry, take your time. It’s been a long time since anyone talked to the old man. Let me know what treasure you want to exchange, and I’ll assess it for you,” the scaly old man said, remarkably amiable, appearing almost childlike. It put Jian Wushuang at ease.

“l don’t know the senior’s name!” Jian Wushuang revealed a hint of joy, smiling.

“Ah! You can call me Qiuhuang!” When the old man in scales revealed his name, his voice became incredibly authoritative. Upon hearing this name, Jian Wushuang trembled!

Qiuhuang?

Qiuhuang City?

Could this old fellow be the Lord of Qiuhuang City?

“Little one, don’t be afraid. The Qiuhuang City you’re in used to belong to me,” Qiuhuang said.

Jian Wushuangs facial muscles twitched.

“Come, let me see your origin source. I will list the treasures that suit you best,” Qiuhuang said as he floated closer.

“l can’t let him see it!” Jian Wushuang instinctively retreated, attempting to evade. But Qiuhuang still sensed a trace of his origin source power.

When Qiuhuang, who had just approached Jian Wushuang, first froze, then became shocked!

Finally, his body trembled violently. He swiftly moved behind the throne, leaving only his head exposed. His eyes stared fixedly at Jian Wushuang, fear evident in his gaze. “Who are you? How do you possess that guy’s aura?”

He had been found out. Jian Wushuang didn’t hide anymore and revealed everything. He had just learned of Qiuhuangs identity and realized it was bad news. His Sword Dao origin source contained the power of the Sword God that had destroyed Qiuhuang City.

Fortunately, after continuous explanations, Qiuhuang cautiously emerged from behind the throne, although his eyes still held a trace of dread.

One could only imagine how afraid he had been of that being back then.

“Cough, actually, I already belong to the same camp as him. I’m not afraid of him!”

Qiuhuang clenched his fist and coughed twice, covering his mouth. Then he remembered that this was the Qishen Universe; there was nothing to fear here,

“Elder, do you know about the past?” Jian Wushuang tried to probe. There were indeed many secrets within the Qishen Temple’s world. If he could learn some of them, it would be helpful for future preparations.

Qiuhuangs expression turned serious. He quickly waved his hand and said, “Young one, Zhu Yi has instructed that I cannot reveal anything about the Qishen Temple to you. Just focus on the trial honestly! When you leave the

Original Universe, everything you need to know will be told to you.”

Jian Wushuang hadn’t expected him to be so tight-lipped, but he still managed to glean a name from his words.

Zhu Yi!

And there was mention of the Original Universe.

So the world of the Original Planets was called the Original Universe. Jian Wushuang nodded to himself.

“Senior, what do you think about exchanging the treasure points in my hands for those treasures?” Jian Wushuang didn’t beat around the bush and went straight to the point.

Qiuhuang turned his body and sat on the throne, stroking his beard with one hand. With a wave of his other hand, countless treasures appeared, filling the entire hall.

“You cultivate the Ultimate Sword Dao. Judging by your Dao, you should be at about the sixth level, and your realm is only Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal. But the origin source inside you is exceptionally powerful; that’s quite strange,” Qiuhuang said, puzzled.

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief. It seemed that the other party hadn’t become powerful enough to see through his entire being.

At least, the old man could not discern his Extreme Dao.

What he didn’t know was that the Extreme Dao was a unique origin source Great Dao. Not to mention Qiuhuang, even if True Spirit were to examine him closely, he wouldn’t be able to discern it.

Although Jian Wushuang didn’t know much about Qiuhuangs past, he could tell that Qiuhuang had been at least a tier 5 Emperor, or he wouldn’t have been able to build such a magnificent city.

This was much stronger than the Heavenly Court of Zhen Wuyang. At least in the Great Si Region, he had never seen such a luxurious city, entirely constructed from the Black Radiant Stone.

The entire city was a treasure in itself. Combined, it was a broken Eternal Treasure.

Qiuhuang frowned and continued, “The Enlightenment Flower is indeed suitable for you, but the Ultimate origin source requires not only enlightenment but also tempering between life and death.”

Upon hearing this evaluation, Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement. It was true that he had only made rapid progress due to the tempering in life and death. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ever since he entered the Great Desolate Wilderness, he had been walking on the edge every time, confronting the Perfected Nine Revolutions head-on.

After breaking through to the Three Revolutions, he encountered Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals again.

Every time, he faced absolute suppression of his strength, leaving him breathless.

It was only after entering the Qishen Temple that things got a bit better.

When he reached the Six Revolutions, he killed the extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals and challenged the Dao Lord powerhouses at the Nine Revolutions-level strength.

Now, without that kind of tempering between life and death, his progress had indeed slowed down.

“Your origin source is undoubtedly powerful, but there are some areas where it falls behind, such as your divine body and soul realm. Your Heart power barely keeps up with your origin source.” Qiuhuang pointed out Jian Wushuangs shortcomings one by one.

He highlighted aspects that Jian Wushuang hadn’t noticed himself.

Especially the divine body, which he thought was already strong enough at 1,000 times the basic divine body..
