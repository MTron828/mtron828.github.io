Chapter 3036: Di Mountain

——

“Di Mountain is very special!”

Elder Gu’s leisurely voice came from the void next to him.

“This Di Mountain is completely covered by a special restriction. Cultivators, no matter who steps on the Di Mountain, will immediately be restricted by the restriction. The power they can use is at most at the level of an ordinary first level True Saint. Even if your realm has already surpassed that of a first level True Saint, or if you have secret techniques that can increase the power of your divine power or special techniques, once you reach the Di Mountain, these secret techniques will not be able to be used!”

“On Di Mountain, the only things you can use are the principles and Dao, as well as the various unique skills you created.”

“Di Mountain is divided into three levels, namely the foot of the mountain, the mountainside, and the mountaintop. Each level has three gatekeepers. What you need to do is to start from the foot of the mountain, then climb to the mountaintop and reach the top. That’s enough.”

After hearing Elder Gu’s words, Jian Wushuang moved.

“There are gatekeepers at the foot of the mountain, the mountainside, and the top of the mountain. Does this mean that I will experience three trials in total? And it seems that these three trials will become more difficult as time goes on,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Let’s begin.” After Elder Gu finished speaking, the rest was left to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and appeared at the foot of the mountain.

As soon as he arrived, he saw three figures standing quietly at the foot of the mountain.

They were a black-clothed woman, a cold-looking elder, and a middle-aged man with red hair.

Their expressions were cold and emotionless.

“Is this my opponent at the foot of the mountain?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused.

“Challenger, defeat us and you can go to the mountainside,” the red-haired middle-aged man said coldly.

As soon as he said this, the red-haired middle-aged man immediately moved.

He rushed toward Jian Wushuang like a ball of hot flame.

The red-haired middle-aged man wore a pair of red fists and his body was full of murderous aura. This murderous aura immediately swept toward Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, the black-clothed woman and the cold-faced elder also made corresponding movements.

The black-clothed woman directly merged into the surrounding void and completely disappeared.

As for the cold-faced elder, a strange light flashed in his eyes.

Buzz, buzz, buzz!

The world in front of Jian Wushuang completely changed.

He was originally taking the test at the foot of Di Mountain, but in the blink of an eye, he found himself in a dark void.

No, it was not a dark void. To be more precise, it was a dark prison.

The dark prison had completely imprisoned him. There were even huge chains that completely bound him, making him unable to move. There were people around him who held knives and swords and wanted to cut his flesh.

“Illusion?”

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold. “Break!”

His body only shook for a moment, and a terrifying willpower burst out. The surrounding dark space immediately collapsed.

“You actually broke my illusion in an instant?”

The cold elder looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise, and then snorted coldly. He pointed his right hand from afar, and six sharp dark spikes turned into six pitch-black beams of light, piercing through the void and shooting toward Jian Wushuang’s head.

Each of the six dark spikes contained a strong impact power.

Before the six dark spikes appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, the red-haired middle-aged man’s fist had already arrived.

His fist was hot and violent, like a raging flame, directly covering Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted and suddenly brandished his Blood Mountain Sword.

His divine power exploded the moment he brandished it, but at the same time, his face darkened.

“As expected, no matter how much I use my divine power, the power I can release is only at the level of a rank one True Saint. I can’t use any means to amplify the power. Even the boundless sword tree, which is 6,600 meters tall, can’t amplify the power of my swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

However, he could not use all his strength. The three people guarding at the foot of the mountain could only activate the power of a rank one True Saint.

Under the same power, Jian Wushuang was not afraid of them at all.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly let out a low shout, and a terrible evil aura suddenly burst out.

Space-time sword art…Evil Xiang!

It was the most terrifying move that Jian Wushuang had created.

Roar!

A deep, angry roar suddenly came from the heaven and earth.

The shocking sword light that Jian Wushuang waved turned into a complete and huge ancient exotic beast in the blink of an eye, and fiercely smashed into the red-haired middle-aged man’s fist.

Crack!

The sound of bones cracking was heard.

The red-haired middle-aged man let out a shrill scream, and his body was sent flying heavily.

Suddenly, a cold black light appeared behind Jian Wushuang without any warning. The black light was cold, dazzling, and full of killing intent.

However, Jian Wushuang only slightly moved his body, and silver light burst out.

Swish! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The dark dagger cut through the void, but it did not have the time to cut through the corner of Jian Wushuang’s clothes.

Jian Wushuang had already appeared beside the black-clothed woman. A sword light was extremely fast and directly slashed at the black-clothed woman. It was much faster and more violent than when the black-clothed woman stabbed out with the dagger.

Whoosh!

The sword light directly passed through the divine body of the black-clothed woman. Then, Jian Wushuang’s body burst forth again. He easily dodged the six dark spikes and chopped off the cold elder’s head.

In just a moment, two of the three people who surrounded Jian Wushuang were killed and one was injured.

Jian Wushuang naturally passed the test at the foot of the mountain.

After passing the test, Jian Wushuang immediately went to the mountainside. As for the black-clothed woman and the cold-faced elder, their divine bodies had recovered.

…

In the void not far from Di Mountain, the elder of the secret realm, Spirit Valley, had been standing there quietly watching.

He had witnessed everything that had happened at the foot of the mountain.

When he saw that Jian Wushuang had easily defeated the three people at the foot of the mountain, he could not help nodding slightly. “His comprehension of the space-time principle is not bad. He has reached the limit of the second stage, which is considered good among rank three true saints. The swordsmanship he created is at the peak of rank three. This kind of comprehension… it should not be difficult to pass the tests at the foot of the mountain or at the mountainside. What is difficult is the mountaintop!”

Elder Gu knew very well that the three tests of Di Mountain were more and more difficult.

Especially the trial on the mountain top, which was the most difficult of the three trials. In the primordial divine world, ordinary geniuses could not pass the trial on the mountain top. Only the top super geniuses could.

As for Jian Wushuang…Elder Gu did not think that Jian Wushuang could pass the trial on the mountain top.
