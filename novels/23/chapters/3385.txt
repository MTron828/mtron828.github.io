Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“There are many experts in the Divine Beginning Realm who are good at soul manipulation, but there are almost no experts who are absolutely confident in soul peeling and won’t cause any harm to the two souls. However, under normal circumstances, as long as an expert in the sixth realm of the Void

realm who is especially good at soul works with me, I’m at least 90% sure that I won’t harm the girl in the process of soul peeling,” said the old woman.

“An expert of the sixth realm of the void who specializes in the soul?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

It was not easy to find such an expert.

It must be known that there were too few experts of the sixth realm of the void in the Divine Beginning Realm. If the experts of the sixth realm of the Void who roamed the universe battlefield and stayed in the Divine Beginning Realm all year round were excluded…there were probably no more than 20 of

them. Among the less than 20 experts, there were even fewer who specialized in the soul.

“I know someone. Not only has she reached the sixth realm of the Void realm, but her attainments in the soul are also extremely high. It’s not an exaggeration to say that she’s the number one expert in the Divine Beginning Realm. Moreover, she has some friendship with me. I can think of a way to find

her,” the old woman said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “Please contact her immediately.”

“Don’t worry.” The old woman waved her hand. “As far as I know, this person has been in closed-door cultivation for a very important time. She didn’t even pay attention to her children who wanted to see her. I can’t contact her at the moment. However, as soon as she comes out, I will tell her about it and

ask her to help.”

“Thank you, senior,” Jian Wushuang said, “by the way, although I know you are the old Valley Master of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, I still don’t know your name…”

“Tam Ma Yi,” the old woman said.

“Ma Yi?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

This name was very strange. It was not her real name, but something like a nickname.

“My friend, since you and I have agreed, let’s leave now,” Ma Yi said.

Jian Wushuang looked deeply into the depths of the cave mansion and nodded slightly.

Soon, Jian Wushuang and Ma Yi walked out of Love Valley.

Outside Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, Demon Master Chenhuo and many Principles Masters of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley were still waiting quietly.

‘When Jian Wushuang and Ma Yi walked out of the peak, they immediately came forward to greet them.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, how is it? Did that old monster make things difficult for you?” Demon Master Chenhuo asked.

“I’s going well. I’ve already negotiated with Senior Ma Yi and made some concessions. The final result is acceptable to both of us,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Agreed?” Demon Master Chenhuo’s expression changed. He did not know what Jian Wushuang and the old woman Ma Yi had talked about, but he did not continue to ask when he saw Jian Wushuang’s expression.

On the other side, Ma Yi did not tell Longyu, Master Gorsch, and the others about the agreement with Jian Wushuang. Instead, he continued to look at Jian Wushuang. “My friend, I’m afraid it will take some time for my friend to go into seclusion. If you don’t mind, you can stay in my Supreme

Emotion-forgetting Valley. If you have other things to do, you can leave first. When my friend comes out of seclusion, I will send a message to you. This is my message token, keep it well.”

Ma Yi handed his message token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the token and pondered for a moment, then he said, “Most of the female disciples in the valley are female. It would be inconvenient for Chenhuo and I to stay here for a long time, so we’d better leave first. When you have a result, you can send me a message.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Twon’t send you off. But before you leave, I hope you can release Zhu Xin and Han Xin,” Ma Yi said with a smile.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled. With a flip of his palm, the blood-red tower appeared in his hand again. With a thought, he immediately released master Zhu Xin and Han Xin, who were suppressed in the tower.

“Senior Ma Yi, and everyone from Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, thank you for your trouble today. There are a lot of resources in this interspatial ring. I apologize to Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. Goodbye!” Jian Wushuang threw an interspatial ring at the Longyu, then, he turned around and

left with Demon Master Chenhuo.

After taking the interspatial ring and seeing Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo completely disappear in front of them, everyone from Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley heaved a sigh of relief.

Although the encounter with Jian Wushuang had caused the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley to lose many disciples, most of them were only at the saint level, which was still within the acceptable range of the Supreme Emotion Valley. Moreover, Jian Wushuang had also taken out the interspatial ring

as an apology, in terms of face, the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley had already gotten over it, so they naturally did not plan to pursue the matter any further.

However, if Jian Wushuang had killed both Master Zhu Xin and Han Xin, the matter would not have been resolved so easily.

Once the matter was resolved, the valley quickly regained its peace. The old woman, Mai Yi, returned to the mountain and continued to guide Leng Rushuang in her cultivation.

Jian Wushuang immediately took out his messaging token and asked Temple Master Bai Xing after leaving the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley with Demon Master Chenhuo.

He naturally asked about some things related to soul peeling.

Although he believed in what Ma Yi had said in the valley, he still carefully asked Temple Master Bai Xing about it. Temple Master Bai Xing was knowledgeable and answered all of them, the answer he got was almost the same as what Ma Yi had said.

First of all, as long as the soul was peeled off and stored on the hundred-million-year-old star-moon agarwood, the soul could be restored completely without any damage or defects. As for the hundred-million-year-old star-moon agarwood…there were indeed some in the Temporal Temple that could

be used.

Then there was the matter of the recovery of the body after the soul was peeled off, Without a doubt, it was the best and most flawless choice to use the iceheart glazed jade to build a glazed body. However, who exactly had the iceheart glazed jade, the Temporal Temple also spent some time to investigate.

Finally, there was an expert of the sixth realm in the Void who was good at soul. The Temporal Temple also gave him one. However, this expert came from the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect and was in the user’s Temporal Temple, there was no expert of the six void realms who specialized in the soul.

After receiving Temple Master Bai Xing’s reply, Jian Wushuang felt more or less at ease.
