Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The explosive eruption that soared into the sky made the entire star tremble.

The giant resembled a deity of ancient times, splitting open the heavens and the earth with a single strike.

The once thick and murky Qi had considerably lightened, but at a height of tens of millions of feet, it had already reached its limit. It had nowhere to hide, forced to withstand the giant‚Äôs axe head.

The brightness of the heavens and earth caused the giant to grin, and his eyes became much clearer, devoid of the previous murkiness.

However, as long as the murky Qi did not dissipate, he wouldn‚Äôt rest. He and the murky Qi were the only things that could remain on this star, a destiny that seemed to have accompanied him since birth.

Whoosh!

The giant once again swung his massive arm, and at that moment, his body underwent a transformation. A faint yellow radiance slowly appeared on his chest, and a powerful force gathered within him.

‚ÄúFourteen!‚Äù

As the roar echoed, a colossal axe shadow reduced the ancient forest to rubble, turning countless towering trees into splinters.

The axe shadow raced through the towering forest, flying toward the sky, like a true dragon roaring into the heavens.

Crackling!

Inside the murky Qi, thunder flickered. After taking this blow head-on, the murky Qi once again grew faint, now almost transparent.

Looking up at the sky from the earth, one could vaguely see several stars.

This sensation greatly excited the giant. His body trembled violently, and the exhaustion in his body erupted at this moment. The faint golden color on his chest burst forth, and golden patterns spread across his face like cracks.

The boundless mysterious yellow energy that was once within him had now completely depleted after that single strike.

Jian Wushuang‚Äôs figure was ethereal, standing in the distance, watching it all.

He could see that the giant was already running on fumes. In fact, the murky Qi had become uncontrollable after the eleventh strike. However, the giant had reached a point where he was willing to sacrifice his life to shatter the cage completely.

This left him somewhat puzzled, much like his feelings towards Xuan Yi and the others.

What were these people truly fighting for?

In the glorious era of the Great Si Region, the time of the ancient hopes, they shone brilliantly, with five great powerhouses coexisting, intimidating countless Heavenly Regions and dominating an entire era.

Yet, Zhen Wuyang shattered the glorious Ancient Era. In his quest to unify the Great Si Region, he had slaughtered countless brilliant and dazzling Grand Yan Immortals in the Great Desolate Wilderness.

Destroying the once revered Ancient Era had been Zhen Wuyang‚Äôs goal, all for the sake of unifying the Great Si Region, gaining control over the entire Great Si Region, and taking that next step forward.

That had been his purpose.

But what about Xuan Yi? What had been his aim?

Why hadn‚Äôt the five great powers of the Ancient Era taken that step forward?

For a moment, Jian Wushuang felt a bit bewildered.

He started to understand.

Zhen Wuyang‚Äôs path of cultivation had given him control over the Great Si Region, allowing him to suppress so many Great Primal Immortals of the ancient era. With the establishment of the Heavenly Court, Zhen Wuyang‚Äôs path had become utterly unassailable within the Great Si Region.

No one could contend with him. Even the revived entity posed no threat. In the Ancient Era, that entity had been suppressed by Zhen Wuyang, and even in its revived state, it would still be no match for him. On his home turf, it was still not his equal.

As for the Emperors of the Ancient Era, they could at best be considered beginners in the Entry Emperor realm, without a complete grasp of the Emperor‚Äôs Great Dao.

Much like Jian Wushuang himself today, although he had comprehended the supreme Dao, he still could not fully control it.

There was one crucial difference, though. He had failed to master the supreme Dao and had become trapped in this starry expanse.

The Ancient Era Emperors, on the other hand, were trapped within the Great Si Region.

The difference between one Dao and another was as vast as the heavens and the earth.

This starry expanse had given birth to countless universes, each containing numerous Celestial Realms.

The Great Si Region was nothing more than a speck of dust in comparison.

That was the supreme Dao, encompassing the entire starry expanse.

If one were to say that the Ultimate Sword Dao was the pinnacle of the world of swords, then the supreme Dao was the highest rule across the entire starry expanse.

Zhen Wuyang‚Äôs Dao was the pinnacle of the Great Si Region. If he wanted to progress further, he had two options: either master another Celestial Realm or comprehend the Dao of the universe itself, gaining control over the entire universe. Of course, the latter was highly impractical.

Jian Wushuang had realized how incredibly challenging it was to comprehend the Emperor‚Äôs Great Dao. To grasp an even more astonishing path required exceptional talent, but as for the Great Dao of the Universe, he didn‚Äôt even entertain the thought.

Based on Jian Wushuang‚Äôs current perception, only a handful of the constellations embedded in the starry sky were under human control. Countless universes existed within the vast expanse of the cosmos.

According to his sense of causality, the universe in which the Great Si Region resided remained untamed by any.

From the giant‚Äôs body, Jian Wushuang gleaned many insights, such as the scorching energy in the giant‚Äôs chest, which shone as brightly as the most dazzling stars in the night sky.

The faint golden lines represented the River of Time and Space, with several of these golden rivers present in the starry sky. These rivers were formed by numerous universes, with the widest being 9 in number, and 99 smaller ones, totaling 108.

Celestial Realms, Universes, the River of Time and Space, and the starry sky‚Äî all of it began to make sense to Jian Wushuang. The laws of space expanded at an astonishing rate, reaching the pinnacle of Yan Immortal that he had attained long ago, and at this moment, they began to shatter.

In the starry expanse, both he and the giant started to break through simultaneously.

It was as if they shared some kind of connection, with both of them breaking through their own limitations at this very moment.

One was the first life born within a star, and the other was the first to comprehend the Great Dao across the entire starry sky.

The giant, seated amidst the forest, grasped the handle of his axe, and fissures started turning into inscriptions on his arm. The power within his body surged at this moment.

This power was scorching, and his breath from his nostrils felt like torch flames.

The endless burning power caused his entire body to emit a golden light. These rays of light seeped through the cracks on his body, illuminating everything around him.

Though the pain was excruciating, the scorching energy was simultaneously repairing the cracks on his body.

At this moment, the giant felt an extreme dryness in his mouth. He staggered to his feet and began to run.

He charged out of the ruins in the towering forest, heading towards the largest river on the star.

In the starry sky.

Jian Wushuang‚Äôs breakthrough was considerably easier than the giant‚Äôs. His constitution was inherently unique within his universe.

As for the Great Dao of Grand Yan Immortal, he had comprehended it long ago in the Great Desolate Wilderness but had always struggled to master it completely.

Now, his breakthrough had increased the probability of mastering it entirely.

The Yan power within him rotated, and the incredibly pure power allowed him to directly ascend to the Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

The power within him was limitless, comparable to that of a Nine Revolutions

Grand Yan Immortal. Coupled with his Ultimate Sword Dao, he could rival a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

And that did not even account for the Great Dao he had yet to fully grasp. If he truly mastered it, he would become the most dominant figure among the Grand Yan Immortals. Except for the perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, he would have no equals.F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He clenched his palm, and the formidable force made the entire starry sky tremble.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, I still haven‚Äôt mastered the Grand Dao completely. I still can‚Äôt leave.. I‚Äôm truly envious of that big fellow!‚Äù
