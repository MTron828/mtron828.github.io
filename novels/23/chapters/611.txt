Chapter 612: Three Years

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Taking the Interspatial Ring from Emperor Xiao, Jian Wushuang looked slightly excited.

There were so many Secret Skills of Sword Principle... Even if these Secret Skills were created by Warriors of Sword Principle at the level of Skyscraping Realm and Divine Realm, any Secret Skill of Sword Principle was so mysterious to Jian Wushuang. After all, he could never create a Secret Skill himself.

These Secret Skills of Sword Principle were extremely useful to him.

“In addition to these Secret Skills of Sword Principle, I will give you ten opportunities to receive my instruction in the next three years. If you don’t have a clear understanding of World Dao or Secret Skills of Sword Principle, you can turn to me. However, you only have ten opportunities, so you should make good use of them.” Emperor Xiao said.

“I see. Thank you so much for your guidance.” Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised with deep feeling through his burning eyes.

Emperor Xiao was at the peak of the Eternal World. Now he promised Jian Wushuang to instruct him 10 times.

These ten opportunities that Emperor Xiao agreed to give him. Even if there was only one opportunity, countless geniuses and experts in the Eternal World would fight over it.

“Go ahead!” Emperor Xiao waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang gave a bow to Emperor Xiao, turned and headed to the World Prison.

Emperor Xiao looked at Jian Wushuang sweeping into the World Prison as a smile slowly grew on his face.

“This little fellow was born with a high aptitude. Also, he has built himself a perfect foundation by cultivating Heavenly Creation Skill, so his perception has been enhanced greatly.”

“Three years for others is just a passing moment, while it is enough for him to improve his strength. The only thing that I’m not sure about is how far he can go.” Emperor Xiao smiled slightly.

Emperor Xiao gave him so many resources and even personal advice. Such a rare opportunity could help ordinary people improve greatly in three years, let alone a super genius like Jian Wushuang.

In the World Prison, the giant hands entirely formed by World Energy flew wildly over Jian Wushuang. As Jian Wushuang gradually comprehended World Dao, these giant hands became more powerful at an increasingly faster speed, the attacks almost drove him to desperation.

“The respected Emperor Xiao was always good to me, and he offered me so many opportunities. These three years are absolutely a great chance for me. I will never waste a second of these three years, racking my brain to improve myself as much as possible. As for how far I can go eventually, it all depends three years later.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes twinkled with ambition.

From this day on, Jian Wushuang began working on his cultivation earnestly.

His cultivation of World Body was separated from that of Slaughter Body.

The World Body, staying at the World Prison, improved world Dao with the help of World Prison. At the same time, his Interspatial Ring inside possessed many manuals of Sword Principle concerning World Dao. He could meditate on the World Dao while studying those manuals. If he encountered some bottlenecks or had no way to proceed, he would get out from the World Prison to ask Emperor Xiao.

Emperor Xiao was the supreme being in the Eternal World, and he was also good at applying World Dao. Although Secret Skill of Sword Principle wasn’t the strong point of Emperor Xiao, it was more than enough to direct Jian Wushuang.

On the other hand, the Slaughter Body of Jian Wushuang was sent by Di Jing to a place called Slaughter Zone, where there were numerous minds and souls that had been slaughtered and invaded thoroughly?into experts of Sword Principle of Crazy Demon. These Crazy Demons began attacking him immediately when they saw him.

Jian Wushuang did nothing but put up a desperate fight. In the following days, his Slaughter Body which was inside the Slaughter Zone continued waging an intense fight with them nearly every day. What his Interspatial Ring possessed was also the Secret Skill of Sword Principle created by many Warriors of Sword Principle at the level of Cloud Realm and Divine Realm given by Emperor Xiao. These Secret Skills of Sword Principle were all aimed at Slaughter Dao.

Also, with the assistance of Six-story Pagoda, his Slaughter Dao enhanced at an extremely high speed.

The two Original Bodies, which stayed in different places, were inspired by different Daos and explored different Secret Skills of Sword Principle without being affected by each other.

With the combination of such a unique and rare cultivation environment and his talented perception, Jian Wushuang’s strength improved at an amazing rate.

As spring went and autumn came, time rolled on.

In a flash, three years passed.

In the huge garden, Emperor Xiao sat on a bamboo chair reading a thread-bound book alone. This thread-bound book was just a travel book written by a man at the level of Skyscraping Realm in the Ancient World, who traveled around the plane world. The book described some of his experiences in each plane world.

Logically, a man at the level of Skyscraping Realm was nothing but a worm to Emperor Xiao. But the travel book written by him was very appealing to Emperor Xiao.

One hour went by in a blink of an eye, Emperor Xiao finally closed the book and put it into his Interspatial Ring. Then his eyes couldn’t help but turn to the World Prison beside him.

“In these three years, the little guy has made much progress. He is a true successor of my old friend.” Emperor Xiao praised secretly.

In the past three years, he had witnessed every improvement Jian Wushuang made and clearly knew how much work he had put in.

“Unfortunately, he still can’t completely break the World Prison.” Emperor Xiao was slightly disappointed.

If Jian Wushuang could break his World Prison in this three-year period, it would be really perfect. But he knew that Jian Wushuang had to multitask to meditate the Secret Skill of Sword Principle within the three years. It was quite incredible for him to achieve what he had, so it was not necessary to require more of him.

Just then...

“Uhm?”

With a sudden change of his expression, Emperor Xiao immediately looked towards the Void, where the interspace began abruptly twisting and turning. Soon a gorgeous yet cold figure slowly walked out from the twisting interspace, showing up before Emperor Xiao. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was a white-robed woman.

She was elegantly beautiful with a breathing-taking coldness.

Also, she was very cold causing the surrounding environment to appear to freeze into chilly ice as long as she showed up.

“Father.” The white-robed woman looked at Emperor Xiao and leaned slightly.

She was Emperor Xiao’s daughter with such a gorgeous and cold vibe. Undoubtedly, this delicately beautiful woman was Leng Rushuang!

“You’re back.” Emperor Xiao looked at Leng Rushuang, apathetic.

“I have come to say goodbye to you, Father. I suppose I won’t come back again.” Leng Rushuang said, as her voice sounded steady.

Emperor Xiao’s face became abruptly severe, “Goodbye? Anything else?”

“Yes,” Leng Rushuang nodded smilingly. “It is Mother. She personally commanded me...”

Before Leng Rushuang had finished speaking, Emperor Xiao waved his hand and clapped the chair violently. The chair, which was obviously made of some unique materials, reduced into dust.

“Ms. Leng? That bitch?” Emperor Xiao’s voice sounded in anger.
