Chapter 330: A Bitter Scold!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The atmosphere of the whole Drill Ground gradually grew tense.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were surrounded by experts from Ice Nether Valley, who were all prepared to kill Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan as long as the Valley Master gave the order.

But Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan had a fearless look in their eyes, as if they didn’t care about those Ice Nether Valley experts at all.

“Wushuang, Zaixuan, what are you doing?” Su Rou asked from inside the Glazed Carriage while frowning.

“Just keep waiting,” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile, not explaining anything.

“You must be Su Rou’s sworn brothers, right? Su Rou has mentioned you.” Ye Chen took one step, looked at them and smiled, then said, “Please forgive me. It was because of my thoughtlessness that you were not invited to our wedding.”

“Em?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Ye Chen didn’t rage, even though Jian Wushuang had almost ruined the wedding.

The experts on the Drill Ground nodded their heads and admired him furtively.“He is worthy of the title as a Master Saint.”

Ye Chen was known as a Master Saint in the Nanyang Continent. It meant that he was perfect in behavior, character, dealing with affairs, and many other aspects, including generosity.

The way Ye Chen behaved now obviously displayed his generosity.

“Hum. He’s so hypocritical.”?Jian Wushuang laughed at him furtively.

“Gentlemen,” Ye Chen said again, “it’s my fault that I failed to invite you to attend our wedding in time. It is normal that you feel dissatisfied, but your way of appearing here is quite special.”

“Special?” Jian Wushuang grinned slightly and said, “You will see something even more special soon.”

Just as Jian Wushuang finished his sentence...

Boom!

A vigorous boom abruptly sounded from somewhere inside Ice Nether Valley, as if the sky was falling and the ground was cracking. Meanwhile, many violent auras were furiously radiating from the area where the booming sound came from.

“What happened?” The Ice Nether Valley experts were startled and looked in that direction.

A figure rushed forward at an amazing speed and flashily arrived in the air above the Drill Ground. This dirty man with shaggy hair was Old Weirdo Yunyang. After arriving at the Drill Ground, he directly looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman, I think I have done what you entrusted me to do,” Old Weirdo Yunyang smiled and said.

“Thank you so much, Senior.” Jian Wushuang showed a delightful expression.

Everyone on the Drill Ground was still startled.

“Old jerk!”

Suddenly, the sound of raging thunder echoed throughout the area. Immediately after that, a man and a woman hurriedly rushed out.

“Elder Ying, what the hell is going on?” The Ice Nether Valley Master instantly looked at the woman.

“Master...” Elder Ying had extreme rage in her eyes as she pointed at Old Weirdo Yunyang and said, in a low voice, “That old jerk caught me off-guard and ruined the Protective Array Core of our Ice Nether Valley!”

“What?” The complexion of the Ice Nether Valley Master greatly changed.

The Ice Nether Valley experts were also instantly filled with shock and anger.

The Drill Ground was suddenly in turmoil.

The Array Core had been ruined?

For a great Sect, the Protective Array was not only the strongest defense method, it was also their greatest trump card. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When there was a crisis, they depended on the Protective Array to protect them.

But now, someone had ruined Ice Nether Valley’s Protective Array Core without making a sound?

“What are they trying to do?”

“You’re quite bold!”

A vast and fierce aura radiated from the Ice Nether Valley Master. He seemed like a furious lion, with raging flame burning on his eyes, as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Bold?” Jian Wushuang sneered and then he said coldly, “You should be rejoicing. Su Rou hasn’t been hurt in your Ice Nether Valley, otherwise, there would be no need for Ice Nether Valley to continue to exist.”

There was no need for Ice Nether Valley to exist?

When the sentence sounded in their ears, everyone was shocked.

Countless eyes, filled with astonishment, were looking at Jian Wushuang.

Everyone was in disbelief.

“That man... is challenging Ice Nether Valley.”

“In the Ice Nether Valley, in front of all the Ice Nether Valley experts, he dares to say this. He really is bold!”

“He has ruined the Protective Array Core of Ice Nether Valley, and then said that. Is he purposely trying to make trouble for Ice Nether Valley?

“Who the hell is he?”

“He, is he?” Nie Wuxin was staring at Jian Wushuang at that moment.

He had conflicts with Jian Wushuang twice, so he was definitely able to recognize Jian Wushuang. He had planned to kill Jian Wushuang and grabbed his World Tree leaf after the great wedding. But now...

“Who the hell is he? How dare he say those things? Such a lunatic,” Nie Wuxin said furtively.

The whole Drill Ground was in a turmoil and everyone was discussing it.

However, inside Ice Nether Valley, many experts’ faces had become sullen.

Ye Chen stepped forward immediately and said coldly, “Sir, I respected you as Su Rou’s sworn brothers and treated you frankly and honestly. But what you have done is too excessive. You show no respect for our Ice Nether Valley. Everyone has witnessed what you have done. If our Ice Nether Valley is to kill you now, it’s also reasonable, right?”

“Master...” Hearing this, Su Rou immediately felt anxious.

But Jian Wushuang laughed coldly. “What you said sounds reasonable and just, but you are just a hypocrite. You’ve done so many bad things, but you still want to pretend you are a good person.”

“What are you talking about?” Ye Chen couldn’t help being shocked and angry.

“Want me to say it again?” Jian Wushuang coldly looked at Ye Chen and said, “Ye Chen of Ice Nether Valley, a perfect and famous Master Saint in the Nanyang Continent, is the meanest and most hypocritical man. What a shitty Master Saint!

“I have met so many shameless people in the world. But to be honest, it is my first time meeting a man as shameless as you.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t lower his voice at all. With the help of Spiritual Power, his voice spread out and kept echoing around the Drill Ground for a long time.

Many experts on the drill ground were astonished.

A bitter scolding!

In front of so many people, Ye Chen was scolded bitterly.

Hypocritical?

Shameless?

Ye Chen’s face grew dark and then pale; a cold light began crazily shining in his eyes.

“Hum. You are more than shameless...” Jian Wushuang’s voice was still cold, and it seemed like he was going to continue scolding Ye Chen.

At this moment…

“Third Bro, enough!”

Suddenly, he heard Su Rou’s voice.

Jian Wushuang turned towards Su Rou and glanced at her. When he saw Su Rou’s complex expression, Jian Wushuang was a bit shocked.

He could tell that Ye Chen occupied an extraordinary place on Su Rou’s heart.
