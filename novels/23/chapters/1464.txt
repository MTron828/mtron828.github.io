Chapter 1465: Blood Emperor Is Here!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang’s plan was great.

However, something unexpected always happens.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped in the void and his face grew solemn.

He could clearly feel the figure in a crimson robe with crimson hair within the coverage of his Soul Power.

“This look, and this aura… It’s Blood Emperor!” Jian Wushuang immediately realized the person’s identity.

In the void near Jian Wushuang, Blood Emperor had already noticed Jian Wushuang’s existence too.

“Haha, found you.”

With a slight smile, Blood Emperor’s figure plunged towards Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Emperor entrusted his people to pass me a message to invite me to his Crimson Castle but I didn’t go. Now, he has taken the initiative to look for me?” Jian Wushuang’s heart clenched. When he noticed Blood Emperor was plunging towards him, he didn’t hesitate but started running away at his top speed.

“Jian Wushuang, I didn’t say that I’m going to kill you. Why are you running away?”

In the void, Blood Emperor’s voice spread as he stopped.

Jian Wushuang then stopped running but he maintained a big distance from Blood Emperor.

“Although there are many experts in Sky Sword Prison, I reckon there shouldn’t be many that wouldn’t run away when they see Blood Emperor. I, Jian Wushuang, don’t have the guts to deal with Blood Emperor in person,” Jian Wushuang said and his voice spread from afar via divine power, into Blood Emperor’s ears.

“I told the others to invite you over on my behalf but you never came to Crimson Castle as a guest. Naturally, I could only come to find you in person,” Blood Emperor smiled faintly.

“I wonder what Blood Emperor would like me to do for him?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He was curious too. Why did Blood Emperor look for him?

“Actually, I looked for you because I needed your help,” Blood Emperor said, “I have been studying a formation for quite some time. However, the setup of the formation required a gemstone called Tian Sha Gem. I don’t have many of them so I wanted to borrow a few from you.”

“Tian Sha Gem?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “What’s a Tian Sha Gem? Where did Blood Emperor hear that I have Tian Sha Gems?”

“You don’t have Tian Sha Gems?” Blood Emperor frowned.

“I really don’t and I’ve never heard of Tian Sha Gems,” Jian Wushuang said straightforwardly.

“You’ve never even heard of them?” Blood Emperor squinted his eyes as he thought to himself, “He doesn’t even know about the Tian Sha Gems. In other words, it’s impossible that he belongs to my tribe even though he carried a treasure of my tribe.

Blood Emperor’s gaze turned cold and he instantly lifted his head again. He smiled and said, “Jian Wushuang, you should have Tian Sha Gem but you never knew. I have a Tian Sha Gem with me, take a look.”

Blood Emperor took out a crimson gem from Qian Kun ring and pretended to show Jian Wushuang as his figure moved towards Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, hurry up and run!”

King of Venomous Worms’ voice suddenly heard in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grim and turned around immediately to run without hesitation.

Just as he turned around, rumble, there was a soaring murderous intention which erupted from Blood Emperor.

Blood Emperor was originally moving closer to him. But then, he was traveling at a terrifying speed too, like a crimson, flowing light that flew through the void towards Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Emperor said he didn’t want to kill me?”

Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed. His Soul Power could sense that the distance between himself and Blood Emperor was getting smaller at a terrifying speed.

At that rate, he reckoned that Blood Emperor would catch up to him in a short time.

“Secret skill of Dragon Blood!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and the divine power in his body suddenly became a blazing inferno and churned at a terrifying speed.

Burning with the aid of divine power, Jian Wushuang’s speed instantly increased by a few hundred times!

The distance between Blood Emperor and Jian Wushuang wasn’t far but it instantly widened the gap at extremely terrifying speed.

“What?”

Looking at the scene, Blood Emperor’s face changed and he immediately sent a message to all the experts under his command within Darkness Mountain. He wanted them to stop Jian Wushuang from escaping.

There were quite a number of experts under Blood Emperor’s control and most of them had gathered at Darkness Mountain. The moment they received his order, they carried it out.

However, Blood Emperor belittled Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power spread. Hence, whenever there were to be any experts that appeared around him, he could notice them at the very moment. Then, he would dodge. The experts in Darkness Mountain that wanted to stop him couldn’t even see where he was.

The chase only continued for fifteen minutes and Blood Emperor had to stop. After all, Jian Wushuang was nowhere to be seen. The experts under his control also couldn’t see Jian Wushuang anywhere.

“He escaped?”

Blood Emperor looked embarrassed and, at the same time, he was shocked.

One must know that he was also good at speed. He took action personally but Jian Wushuang had run way under his watch.

Jian Wushuang’s skill of escape was extraordinary.

Blood Emperor stood in the void and waited for a while. He was waiting for the replies of the experts under his control.

Very soon, he came to a conclusion.

“Although the young man was very fast at running away, he should have yet to get out of Darkness Mountain. If I’m not mistaken, he must have found a place to hide. The place that he is hiding is definitely within a billion miles range of this region before me.”

Blood Emperor was clear that it was impossible for Jian Wushuang to run out from Darkness Mountain in such short period of time. Plus, the experts under his control didn’t notice Jian Wushuang’s existence. Hence, Jian Wushuang had definitely hidden.

There was a flash of a chilly gleam in Blood Emperor’s eyes. The next moment, he gave a command to the experts under his control, “Everyone, gather at this region, search using consciousness within a one billion mile range. We must find Jian Wushuang!”

The experts under Blood Emperor’s control immediately started to search within a one billion mile range.

A billion mile range was already extremely vast.

One must know that there was a limitation of cultivator’s consciousness coverage in Sky Sword Prison. A Real God could only cover an expanse of a thousand miles with his all. Relying on a Real God’s consciousness to search for a hidden expert within a billion mile range was really difficult. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Most importantly, within the one billion mile range, the underground was not included.

Taking the underground into account, the range became even wider. There was less than a hundred of them if the experts under Blood Emperor’s control were all added up. Even if everyone gathered to search through the one billion mile range, the difficulty level of the search was still considered high.
