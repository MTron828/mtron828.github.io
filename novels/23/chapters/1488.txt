Chapter 1489: Ling Dan

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Inside a cave that had been opened temporarily in the Heavenly Fire Summit.

Two shadows sat upright in front of a long narrow table. They were chatting and drinking wine.

“If nothing goes wrong, the disciple that the Lineage of Star has sent should be arriving soon,” a young man whose face emitted a slightly evil aura chuckled. This evil man was Ling Dan.

“Mister Ling Dan, the Lineage of Star contains countless geniuses. They even have two experts in the Universe God ranking list. Are you sure that you can take them on?” a bald-headed old man beside Ling Dan frowned. He was the master of the Seven Planet Sect. However, at that moment, he felt restless.

After all, Ling Dan stayed on purely because he was willing to do so and it had nothing to do the Seven Planet Palace.

Even in that duel between the Seven Planet Palace and Green Lightning Sect previously, it was Ling Dan who had invited himself in. He said that he would fight for the Seven Planet Palace and he would do so for no cost.

At that moment, the Seven Planet Palace Master (the same person as the Seven Planet Sect Master) felt extremely suspicious. However, when he thought about the benefits, he gave the green light. However, he had never thought that Ling Dan would actually provoke the Lineage of Star after the duel. They were in the Star Land and the Lineage of Star was the overlord. Who would be able to live a good life after offending the Lineage of Star?

However, things had already become as such. Even if the Seven Planet Palace Master were to regret it, it was too late.

“The Lineage of Star contains countless geniuses?” Ling Dan laughed loudly, “The Lineage of Star contains many geniuses. However, in this generation, there isn’t a genius who is very exceptional. Moreover, only two of them managed to make it into the Universe God ranking list. For the two of them, one of them ranked fifty-first on the Universe God ranking list while the other ranked eighty-second. Hence, I do not think anything of them!”

“In other words, among the disciples of the Lineage of Star of the current moment, there is no one who can fight against me!”

“That is what you think. However, that is the Lineage of Star. Mister Ling Dan, now you actually wish to use the Lineage of Star as a stepping stone to build your reputation. This would offend the Lineage of Star greatly and after that…” the Seven Planet Palace Master did not manage to finish his speech.

“After that? We shall talk about what happens after that another time,” Ling Dan grinned.

On the surface, Ling Dan looked as if he did not care. However, he knew everything clearly from the bottom of his heart.

“According to that great person’s agreement, as long as I can make the Lineage of Star lose their prestige and use my own abilities to make it into the Universe God ranking list, he will agree to take me on as his disciple,” Ling Dan’s eyes were glowing brilliantly, “He is an expert in the Real God ranking list. Moreover, he is an extraordinary existence that is in the top five of the Real God ranking list and is almost able to compete with an Almighty. If I could be under the supervision of such an expert, how lucky would that be? Now, the opportunity is right in front of me. Even though there is some risk involved, how is itsignificant?”

The Lineage of Star was one of the overloads of the Purple Moon Sanctuary. Hence, they were definitely one of the great forces in the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

However, the Lineage of Star also had its own enemies. Among the enemies, one of them was a Real God who was so frightening that he could get into the top five of the Real God ranking list.

Ling Dan had seen the Real God before and even had an agreement with him.

As such, he did not hesitate to spend a great amount of energy and use the duel between the disciples of Seven Planet Palace and the Green Lightning Sect as an opportunity to provoke the Lineage of Star.

In other people’s eyes, they thought of him as an idiot who aspired to be famous and only wished to use the Star Palace disciples of the Lineage of Star as a stepping stone.

“Just look on, I will definitely get myself accepted by that great person!”

Ling Dan clenched his fists tightly and felt extremely eager.

At that moment…

“Ling Dan!!!”

A shout resounded across the universe and naturally, it also travelled to the inside of the cave.

“They have come,” Ling Dan stood up and he wore an icy-cold smile. He moved his body at once and he appeared outside the cave.

As for the Seven Planet Palace Master, he was frowning. He then gave a sigh and followed after Ling Dan.

The vast sky stood Jian Wushuang with a cold expression. At the same time, many cultivators had also appeared by the side of the Heavenly Fire Summit.

The cultivators were all looking at Jian Wushuang and talking to one another.

“Who is this person? I have never seen him before.”

“Looks like he is also a disciple of the Lineage of Star.”

“The people with the rights to challenge Ling Dan should only be Long Ya and Xuan Yi, the two experts in the Universe God ranking list. However, this person in front of us is obviously not either of them.”

Amidst the talking voices, a fluttering light was shot onto the Heavenly Fire Summit.

A loud, hearty laugh reverberated across the universe at the same time.

“Haha, they have finally come. I thought that the disciples of the Lineage of Star were a bunch of cowards!”

It was obvious that this voice was filled with disdain. Ling Dan’s body also appeared in the void and he was standing in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Oh?” as Ling Dan looked at Jian Wushuang, he raised his eyebrow, “I have seen the portraits of Long Ya and Xuan Yi before. You are not them.”

“Senior Long Ya and Xuan Yi are busy with their work. Hence, do you think they have the time to fight with you?” Jian Wushuang chuckled, “Moreover, not just any average guy can pick a fight with the both of them randomly.”

“Oh?” Ling Dan’s gaze turned cold and he laughed indifferently: “You have a sharp tongue. Tell me, who are you?”

“Jian Wushuang of the Star Palace!” Jian Wushuang said magnanimously.

“Jian Wushuang? I’ve never heard of this name before,” Ling Dan shook his head, “However, since you are a Star Palace disciple, you should be capable. Go ahead and make your move.”

“As you wish.”

Jian Wushuang raised the corners of his mouth slightly. His Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hands and remarkable sword essence rose slowly.

Swish!

As soon as Jian Wushuang moved his body, nine shadows appeared at the same time. At the next moment, he had already appeared beside Ling Dan.

“Yes, this speed and martial art motion are both not too bad,” Ling Dan chuckled and he remained unconcerned. A large hammer could be seen appearing in his right hand and he swung it with a swing of his hand.

Although the swing looked random, it contained an extremely shocking strength.

In the places that the big hammer passed through, the air rumbled.

Jian Wushuang’s body stretched and became a huge bow. As for the Blood Mountain Sword, it became an arrow and shot forward abruptly.

Clang!

With a loud sound, the quake caused by the collision of great strengths caused Ling Dan’s body to shake and he could not help but retreat a step.

Ling Dan raised his head with surprise. He then realized that Jian Wushuang had already turned his body around and a bright sword light appeared with a whistle.

“Ten Thousand Shadows!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Countless sword lights appeared and headed toward Ling Dan. Every sword light was extremely fast and its power was shocking.

Ling Dan’s expression changed and he immediately swung his big hammer to block crazily. This resulted in heavy collision sounds one after another. At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed.

“Go down!”

Swish!

A scarlet sword light which looked like a crimson lightning in the sky was unleashed.

Real God’s Unique Skill… Crimson Light!

The crimson lightning pierced the big hammer and struck Ling Dan’s body.

“Puff!”

Ling Dan spit out a huge mouthful of blood straight away and he retreated pathetically. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
