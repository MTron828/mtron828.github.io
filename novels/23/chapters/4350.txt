4353 Smashing People With a Cauldron

Jian Wushuang’s divine power was tens of thousands of times greater than that of Spirit Bristle Divine Lord. With the help of the original universe, the gap between him and Spirit Bristle Divine Lord had reached an incredible level!

“Are you done?”

Jian Wushuang spat out these words indifferently.

“I…”

!!

Spirit Bristle Divine Lord’s face turned red, and she stuttered, unable to say a word.

“Since you’ve fought enough, can we have a good talk?”

With a calm expression, Jian Wushuang released his grip on the Golden spear.

In that instant, Spirit Bristle Divine Lord, who didn’t have time to stop her power, almost fell from the sky.

Spirit Bristle Divine Lord, who was holding the blazing flame golden spear tightly, smiled angrily again.

“Hmph, you stole my Holy Land’s heritage, and now you have the nerve to tell me to talk nicely?”

“If you want this sect master to speak properly, then receive this move of mine first!”

Secret skill, true Sevenfold flame!

“Die!” Spirit Bristle Divine Lord shouted as she rubbed her hands together.

In an instant, the Golden spear disappeared and turned into a pool of golden flames.

As soon as the golden flame appeared, it turned the entire sky and land into a sea of fire as if it was burning the sky!

Jian Wushuang, who was in the sea of fire, was like a small boat in the raging sea, as if he would be swallowed by the sea of fire at any time.

“Go to hell!”

“You’re courting death!” Spirit Bristle Divine Lord grinned and pulled with her hands again. The golden flames instantly turned into a lifelike golden fire dragon. Each scale was shining, and it stepped on flames.

“Go!”

Spirit Bristle Divine Lord roared and pushed forward. In an instant, the golden fire dragon roared and pounced toward Jian Wushuang!

“You’re so stubborn.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. He had wanted to use divine general Wu Qi to cut the fire Dragon into pieces, but he seemed to have thought of something. Instead of taking out Wuqi Divine Sword, he turned his right hand and an ancient bronze cauldron appeared in his hand.

The ancient bronze cauldron was suppressed by Jian Wushuang’s divine power. It had recovered from its original power and was like a black iron lump, not eye-catching at all.

“It’s a good time to test your power.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and threw the ancient bronze cauldron at the fire Dragon.

However, Jian Wushuang was afraid that the cauldron would smash Spirit Bristle Divine Lord into ashes, so he controlled his power and only used less than ten percent of the cauldron’s power.

Bang!

The ancient bronze cauldron drew a parabola in the air and smashed into the mouth of the fire Dragon formed by the true fire of Sevenfold!

Chi chi chi chi!

There was no resistance at all. Like a sledgehammer smashing tofu, the powerful Fire Dragon was directly shattered inch by inch, turning into countless fire stars that scattered!

This wasn’t the end. After the ancient bronze cauldron smashed the fire Dragon, it spun and once again smashed toward Spirit Bristle Divine Lord!

“What the hell is this?”

“What?!” Spirit Bristle Divine Lord was stunned. A black lump of metal rushed out of the countless sparks and kept enlarging in his eyes!

Clang!

In the end, the ancient bronze cauldron drew an extremely beautiful arc in the air and smashed straight into his head.

“What did I get hit by?”

This was the last thought that flashed through the mind of Spirit Bristle Divine Lord.

Immediately, his vision turned black and he passed out.

Whoosh.

The unconscious Spirit Bristle Divine Lord fell to the ground, raising a cloud of dust.

“Holy Lord!!”

“You actually dared to kill the Holy Master?!!”

“How dare you!” Countless Spirit Bristle Holy Land disciples and nine peak elders roared.

However, although they looked hesitant and eager, none of them dared to step forward and face Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang ignored them and looked at the cauldron. He raised his eyebrows and his eyes lit up.

This was the first time he had used the bronze cauldron against an enemy. He had tried his best to control the power of the cauldron and only used 10% of its original power.

He didn’t expect that even so, Spirit Bristle Divine Lord’s divine body was on the verge of collapse, and her divine soul was directly blocked under the heavy blow.

This was an invincible Ruler!

If he were to use the innate Qi in the ancient bronze cauldron, how powerful would he be?

“It seems like the power of this cauldron is far beyond my imagination.”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and he had a lot of thoughts. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After a while, Jian Wushuang stretched out his right hand and made a grabbing motion. Boundless divine power gushed out and he grabbed the ancient bronze cauldron back. He then put it into his Interspatial Ring.

“Don’t worry, your Holy Master is fine.”

Jian Wushuang lowered his head and glanced at the people from Spirit Bristle Holy Land.

...

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s gaze, they shuddered.

They had finally seen clearly that the dark object that had knocked their sect master out was an ancient bronze cauldron!

Knocked unconscious by a cauldron?

This was too fierce!

…

A month passed.

During this month, Jian Wushuang did not leave Spirit Bristle Holy Land. Instead, he quietly waited for spirit puppet Holy Lord to wake up.

To Jian Wushuang, Spirit Bristle Holy Land was just an ordinary force that could be destroyed with a flip of his hand. However, he, Jian Wushuang, never liked to owe others anything. He had said before that he would give resources to compensate Spirit Bristle Holy Land, so he would naturally do as he said.

At the top of the seventh peak of the Spirit Bristle Holy Land, there was a cliff that overlooked the entire Spirit Bristle Holy Land.

Jian Wushuang sat on the edge of the cliff with his legs crossed, comprehending the great Dao in silence.

Ruler Feng Xin stood behind Jian Wushuang respectfully like a servant.

...

Ever since Jian Wushuang had defeated Spirit Bristle Divine Lord with one move using the ancient bronze cauldron a month ago, she had been completely convinced by Jian Wushuang.

“Sir Buqi, Sir Holy master has already woken up early this morning,”

Ruler Feng Xin said respectfully.

Jian Wushuang’s back was facing Feng Xin. He nodded and stood up.

“Alright. Let’s go, follow me to see him.”

“Yes!”

After a while, Jian Wushuang saw Spirit Bristle Divine Lord in the sect master’s Hall of Spirit Bristle Divine Land.

Although Spirit Bristle Divine Lord’s godly body was still covered in cracks and was still weak, her complexion had recovered a lot.

However, his entire person was like a frosted eggplant. He looked dispirited and sighed in a low voice, as if he had aged decades.

He looked at Jian Wushuang, who was walking into the hall step by step. The anger on his face had disappeared and was replaced by a touch of helplessness.

“Sir, you’ve already taken the innate fourth fire and I’m not your match, what else do you want? My temple is small and can’t take any more trouble.”

Spirit Bristle Divine Lord said helplessly.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Sir Holy master, don’t worry, I’m only here to make amends.”

“Compensation?”

Spirit Bristle Divine Lord, who was originally depressed like a frosted eggplant, suddenly became energetic. She straightened her back and her eyes shone.
