Within a billion, it was all worth it.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t in a hurry to bid. He hadn’t anticipated such fierce competition, but fortunately, he had plenty of godstones.

Once the price reached eight billion, the voices became sparse. Each subsequent bid increased by around 20 million. “1 billion!” Jian Wushuang made his bid.

A bold move!

As expected, the clamor of competition diminished. Just as Nalan Ci was about to declare the winner, a voice echoed in the hall.

“1.8 billion!”

Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows, nearly letting out a curse.

An eight-billion increase in a single bid—that was a substantial amount of godstones!

Moreover, the bidder was among the strong figures in the hall. The strongest in the hall was only a tier 4 Emperor. Did he really have that much money?

Jian Wushuangs voice deepened. “Someone!”

Shortly after, an elderly man arrived, an Emperor from the Heavenly Court.

“l want to verify the opponent’s bid!”

Upon hearing this, the old man revealed a faint smile and said, “Esteemed Friend, you can rest assured. If the other party can state the price, they can afford it; otherwise, they’ll have to disappear!’

“Humph! What if I raise the bid, and the other party doesn’t follow? I’d end up wasting a billion godstones for nothing?” Jian Wushuang felt like he was being played.

If he didn’t need it urgently, he would have loved to see how the other party would handle this. However, he had to secure this formation.

He had no choice but to follow through.

The old man understood Jian Wushuangs concern and conveyed the message,

Not long after, the Emperor who made the bid in the hall handed a treasure to the Heavenly Court representative. With just a glance, the Heavenly Court figure provided a clear response.

Bid confirmed!

Upon hearing this answer, Jian Wushuang’s face was full of resentment.

“1.8 billion and 1 million!”

“No matter how much the other party bids, I’ll add a million godstones more!” Since they were at odds, Jian Wushuang wanted to see just how much money the other party had.

At the same time, he instructed Bai Junwang to mobilize Heavenly Court personnel to investigate the identity of the Emperor in the hall.

Though there were no central figures in the Heavenly Court, it shouldn’t be difficult to find out the identity of an Emperor sitting in the hall.

“No, the people from the Kui Organization are not in the core, and all identity information is controlled in the core. Perhaps only Nalan Ci knows the identity of that person.” Bai Junwang shared the gathered information.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to increase the bid.

He added a million, and the other party added 500,000 . This pattern continued!

Although the increase per bid was smaller, the number of bids was high!

Soon, it reached 2 billion.

“3 billion!”

Jian Wushuang stood up, staring at the Emperor in the hall.

In a secluded throne in the hall, the mysterious Emperor who made the bid revealed a cold smile and loudly declared, “Since you’re so eager, I’ll give it to you!”

After saying this, he pressed his hand down, indicating that he wouldn’t bid any further.

Jian Wushuang was fuming in the VIP room.

In the hall, voices gradually rose.

Though curious, no one spoke much, unsure of the bidder’s identity.

Some powerful individuals disguised their strength, a common occurrence in such gatherings.

However, playing with so many godstones was unusual.

Several tens of billions of godstones— even a tier 5 Emperor wouldn’t play around with them so casually!

After obtaining the formation, Jian Wushuang felt it was nothing special. 3 billion!

He ignored the subsequent formations, as comprehending them required a lower level of skill.

After calming down, he felt increasingly regretful.

It was simply a lack of strength. If he had Bai Junwangs power, he would have confronted and defeated the person.

The auction had lasted a month for just the first half, with tens of thousands of treasures auctioned. The pace was relatively fast due to some overlapping items; otherwise, it would have taken half a year.

After the first half, ten special treasures would be auctioned.

Throughout the first half, Jian Wushuang spent over 5 billion godstones.

He nearly gathered all the treasures needed for the Extreme Dao origin source, buying them while simultaneously absorbing and refining. He also practiced the Heavenly Demon’s profound techniques, managing his time judiciously without wasting a moment.

“Hmm?” Bai Junwang on the origin source pillar felt a stir in his heart, his gaze penetrating through.

He looked toward the auction hall.

“A familiar sensation!”

Something that Bai Junwang found familiar was, at least, a relic from ancient times.

Jian Wushuang also became curious and asked, “What is it?”

“It’s the aura, a very familiar aura, similar to your Sword Qi!” Bai Junwang stared at the ten special treasures in the hall.

“Is it the Jade Qilin?”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“The Yan-Transforming Divine Rod?”

“The Heavenly Oracle Codex?”

“It’s that rod!” Bai Junwang pointed to the Yan-Transforming Divine Rod.

Jian Wushuang became even more puzzled. How could a rod be similar to his Sword Qi?

“Look at the patterns on it!” Bai Junwang reminded.

Jian Wushuang followed his gaze, and his eyes narrowed. The Yan-Transforming Divine Rod seemed to be right in front of him, and the patterns on it were clearly visible. “What is this?”

These don’t seem like patterns!

Bai Junwang also discerned something hidden within and revealed a look of fear.

“Sword Intent, similar to the Sword Intent on the surface of Qiuhuang City. It should be left behind by Emperor Jueyun!” Jian Wushuang nodded, recognizing it.

He had some connection with Emperor Jueyun and had once received teachings from him.

Seeing Bai Junwangs fear, Jian Wushuang sighed and said, “He’s already a bygone friend; there’s no need to be afraid!”

“You don’t understand, the terror of Emperor Jueyun. You simply don’t comprehend. You’re the heir of the Qishen Temple, of course, you’re not afraid.” Bai Junwang sat back on the pillar of the origin source, crossing his hands, showing a deep apprehension.

Soon, someone made a bid.

These ten treasures were all extraordinary, and their starting prices were naturally exorbitant.

Soon, they all soared to several billion.

One of them even exceeded the historical bid that Jian Wushuang had previously set.

It directly shot up to 5 billion.

It was a contest among tier 5 Emperors, and no one else could intervene, In the adjacent VIP room, Hu Qing stood by the window with Jiang Shang.

“4 billion, Spirit of Grass and Wood!”

Hu Qing slowly stated the price.

Jiang Shang, currently just an ordinary mortal cultivator, had no idea what a godstone was, and he had no concept of Hu Qings offer.

“Master, what is the use of this Spirit of Grass and Wood? I can’t see anything special about it, while other treasures seem more discernible!” Jiang Shang was somewhat puzzled.

Hu Qing smiled faintly and answered gently, “It’s precisely because you can’t see that I want to buy it.”

After bringing Jiang Shang here, he discovered that the latter could actually see through the essence of those treasures, which surprised him.

An ordinary mortal cultivator with such discerning eyes.

If this were known to others, the entire realm would probably shake, and he also found that Jiang Shangs constitution was fundamentally different from the Four Great Secret Realms and even the external world. It seemed more like a Special Life Form.

Lowering his head, he looked into Jiang Shangs eyes, where it seemed as if a vast starry sea resided..
