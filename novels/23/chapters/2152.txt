Chapter 2153 Sweeping Three Emperors World

Hearing what Emperor Bai had said, Jian Wushuang and the other Great Emperors clenched their palms together.They were all elated.

Indeed, the battle had turned the tables from being similar in power, to completely overpowering the Three Emperors World to the extent that they had abandoned their lair.

The huge amount of resources the Three Emperors World possessed would allow the Eternal Chaotic World to progress in strength once again.

If it went on, the Eternal Chaotic World forces would eventually emerge victoriously.

“As an estimation, we have a seventy per cent chance of winning,” Ancestor Tian Chen said solemnly.

Seventy per cent was Ancestor Tian Chen’s estimate.

Indeed it was.

“Even so, we must not let our guard down. The Three Emperors World are led by three Ancient Era leaders, especially that Kaiser Blood,” Emperor Bai’s expression changed. “He’s something else, that Kaiser Blood.”

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang and the others looked at Emperor Bai. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

They had all witnessed Emperor Bai fighting it out with Kaiser Blood and seen Emperor Bai at the complete advantage.

Obviously Emperor Bai’s abilities were about the same as Kaiser Blood’s, but as they heard what Emperor Bai had said…

“If my prediction is correct, Kaiser Blood was not at his best just now, definitely so,” Emperor Bai said. “He felt really strong, but could not defeat me during the fight. There is only one explanation for this, which is that he had not fully recovered his abilities?”

Incomplete form?

Abilities not fully recovered?

Under those circumstances, if Kaiser Blood could go head-on with Emperor Bai, it meant that his fighting power would be at pinnacle Third Stage. If he had fully recovered, what Stage would that be?

Fourth Stage?

“We need to be on our guard. The tactics of the Ancient Era outpower what you all are familiar with today. We must chase them down, we cannot give them room to breathe,” Emperor Bai said coldly.

“But now that the experts have abandoned their lair, we have no way of knowing where they are hiding, how can we chase them?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

One should at least know where the enemy was in order to chase them down, right?

“Kaiser Blood’s tactics are impressive, creating Space Tunnels with his blood-tainted ocean. Even I cannot sense where the Space Tunnels went, if they have left the Three Emperors World or not. If they really wanted to hide, it would not be easy finding them,” Emperor Bai’s face was sour.

“But, we have no need to find them for now. Our target is the entire Three Emperors World.”

“Emperor Bai, you mean?” Jian Wushuang read his mind.

Emperor Bai said coldly, “The Three Emperors World will never let us off. If we were on the losing side, they would have decimated the billions of lives on the Eternal Chaotic World. Therefore, we cannot go soft on their world either!”

“The Three Emperors World has countless domains and Cultivators. This is the foundation of the Three Emperors World. These domains are the ones providing the enemy with Cultivators. We must eliminate everything!”

“Of course, we cannot be as ruthless as the enemy. We will spare the normal Cultivators, but hunt down the high-ranked experts!”

Jian Wushuang, Ancestor Tian Chen, and many other Great Emperors around were determined.

They had all stepped on the bodies of others to reach where they were today. Naturally, they would not go easy on the enemy.

The twelve states, eighty-four God Mansions, three thousand and three hundred domains, and countless cultivators of the Three Emperors World.

The domains and cultivators were the true foundation of the Three Emperors World.

They were not so as crazy to kill every single cultivator, but they could not afford to not take down the elite ones, or potentially elite ones.

“Tian Chen, send the word for the army to move off. Get them to sweep and search every single domain. Kill every powerful Almighty in sight, even the Real Gods… leave the Void Real Gods and Eternal Real Gods aside, but anyone that reaches Chaotic Real God, kill them!” Emperor Bai said coldly.

“Understood,” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded.

“The rest of you, make your way forward as well, don’t let the enemy defeat us here,” Emperor Bai said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and others obeyed his command.

Before long, they had re-organised Eternal Chaotic World army and headed for different domains under the command of several Great Emperors.

The largest sweep within Three Emperors World had commenced.

…

A hidden domain within the Three Emperors World.

The Three Emperors World experts that had escaped from the Imperial City had all gathered there.

At the core of the domain, at the dark Void above, gathered Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, and Leng Ruxue.

Even though Ba Su was a Third Stage Great Emperor, his measly status gave him no right to be there.

The faces of the four were extremely ugly.

“We have received the news. The Eternal Chaotic World army has moved out from the Imperial City, and has started sweeping every domain. They are wiping out all the high-ranked experts we have,” Kaiser Blood said coldly, but anyone could tell his tone was full of murderous intent.

“Eternal Chaotic World!

Emperor Bai!

And that Jian Wushuang!

Damn it, damn it!” Demon King Chen Yu was bawling.

“This time, we were outplayed by Emperor Bai,” Lord Fen said. “The token Jian Wushuang crushed was a Void Token, if I am not mistaken. A rare token even in our era!”

“A Void Token, a carefully thought-out plan for Jian Wushuang and others to hit us unexpectedly, dealing as much damage as possible. Then they lured all the experts over, finally using the token to send their army over to wipe us out!”

“Vicious!”
