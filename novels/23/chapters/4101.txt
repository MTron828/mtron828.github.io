Chapter 4103: Deep Within the Universe

“Since he wants to tag along, let him tag along. He won’t dare to attack me even if he has the guts to. In fact, he won’t even have the guts to invite a great being to deal with me.” Ruler Heart Slayer was filled with disdain for Ruler Blackhawk.

Once he knew exactly where Ruler Blackhawk was going, Heart Slayer was satisfied and began to accelerate.

The universe boat that he had been traveling on suddenly sped up dozens of times, hundreds of times, and instantly pierced through the universe void, traversing a long distance.

“So fast!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

!!

It was too fast. The universe boat was indeed a little too fast. It was dozens of times, hundreds of times faster than the universe boat that he had been on before!

It must be known that he had taken a universe boat all the way from the Divine Beginning Realm to the Nine Luminaries Galaxy. It had taken him more than 100,000 years to get there. However, if it had been Heart Slayer Ruler’s universe boat…if the speed was several times faster than 100 times faster, it would only take him more than 1,000 years to get there.

Heart Slayer Ruler, on the other hand, said with a smile, “When adventuring in the universe, there are many times when we can not use the universe passage. First of all, not every place has a universe passage, and not every place can be reached directly. Secondly, the price of universe passage transmission is too high.”

“This time, I rushed to the Nine Luminaries Galaxy from the depths of the universe mainly because the Nine Luminaries Galaxy was in great danger. It was too urgent, so I didn’t care about the cost and reached the Nine Luminaries Galaxy directly through the universe passage. But now, after returning to the depths of the universe from the Nine Luminaries Galaxy, I can’t use the universe passage so extravagantly.”

Jian Wushuang also understood.

In the vast universe, it was not easy to build a universe passage. Especially, the deeper one went into the universe, the more stable the universe void became, and the more laborious it was to build a universe passage, the cost of the universe passage was also greater.

Because of this, even Supreme experts would not easily rely on the universe passage to reach every corner of the universe, unless it was an emergency. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“If you do not rely on the universe channel and have to travel through the universe void space on your own,” Heart Slayer said indifferently, “a high-level universe boat is a must-have for every great being. After all, having a high-level universe boat that can travel through the universe void space at an extremely fast speed can save you a lot of time. This universe boat of mine was bought by me at a special auction a long time ago, and I spent nearly a million universe origin stones to buy it so that I could travel through the universe void space.”

“Of course, my universe boat is also very strong in terms of body protection. If there’s a crisis, I can hide in the universe boat. Even a top-tier Supreme-being wouldn’t be able to do anything to me in a short time. I can wait for the arrival of the experts from the Nine Emperor Pavilion in the universe boat. Little Guy, if you want to explore the depths of the universe in the future, if you have the chance, you can find a way to get a universe boat that can save your life.”

When Jian Wushuang heard this, he was secretly shocked.

He had spent nearly a million universe origin stones to buy this universe boat. No wonder it was so fast.

Moreover, this universe boat had both protective abilities. Even a top-tier Supreme-being could not do anything to it in a short period of time. It was truly impressive.

Jian Wushuang could not help but think of his universe boat that had been smashed into pieces. His universe boat was indeed a little too shabby. Its value could not even be compared to a low-grade principle true treasure.

When he reached the depths of the universe, he could indeed find a way to get a stronger universe boat. Although it could not be compared to the universe boat of Ruler Heart Slayer, at least it could not be too bad.

“The level of the Blackhawk’s universe boat is not as high as mine, and its speed is also not as fast as mine. It won’t be so easy for him to catch up,” Ruler Heart Slayer said with a faint smile.

The silver universe boat shuttled through the universe void at high speed. It had taken Jian Wushuang tens of thousands of years to reach the depths of the universe, but it had only taken him hundreds of years to reach it with Heart Slayer.

Now, Jian Wushuang had arrived at the first divine kingdom in the depths of the universe.

This divine kingdom was called the ice-snow divine kingdom.

“In the depths of the universe, there are still numerous large Star Fields. There are many experts in these Star Fields, but there are more experts and more concentrated divine kingdoms created by Supreme-beings.”

“For example, this divine kingdom of ice and snow was created hundreds of thousands of chaos cycles ago by a Supreme expert in the universe, the Snow Emperor. This Snow Emperor could be said to have been extremely dazzling in the past. He was a true Supreme genius just like you. Although he didn’t gain any insights into the principles of the universe at the Ruler of principles level, his rate of improvement wasn’t any slower than those Supreme geniuses who were rarely seen in the trillions of Star Worlds. In less than ten million years after he broke through to become a Ruler, he broke through to become an Ruler, and his combat power was infinitely close to that of a Supreme Ruler!”

“After he broke through two chaos cycles, his combat strength reached that of a top-tier Ruler. Later on, he became an influential figure among the top-tier Rulers. He was even close to being a match for a universe overlord. Unfortunately, he died in an accident,” Heart Slayer said with a sigh.

“He died?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “If the Snow Emperor is dead, why is his divine kingdom still alive and so prosperous?”

Jian Wushuang walked in the Ice and Snow Divine Kingdom. It was prosperous with countless experts.

“Haha, little guy, you’ve misunderstood something. It’s true that the divine kingdom needs a top-tier Supreme to be qualified to establish, but it doesn’t mean that the divine kingdom will decline or even collapse after the death of the top-tier Supreme. After all, a divine kingdom will absorb a large number of cultivators. After a long period of growth, many experts will be born. Some of the top-tier experts born in the divine kingdom even have the hope of surpassing the top-tier Supreme who established the Divine Kingdom!”

“When the Snow Emperor was around, the Ice and Snow Divine Kingdom could prosper for a long period of time. Although the Snow Emperor died later, most of the experts under his command did not die. When these experts joined forces, they could naturally keep the divine kingdom from declining.”

“In the depths of the universe, there are thousands of divine kingdoms. However, not all of the kings who founded these divine kingdoms are still alive. Many of them have died long ago,” Heart Slayer said with a smile.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Little guy, don’t you have a message token from a Supreme from the Life Palace? Now that you’re in the depths of the universe, you can send a message to him and ask him to come and fetch you,” Heart Slayer said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately took out Blood Wave’s message token.
