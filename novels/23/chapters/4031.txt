Chapter 4033: Had Been Successfully Refined

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“How is this possible?” Qin Feng’s divine body had recovered, and his aura was extremely weak. However, he still stared at Jian Wushuang with disbelief in his eyes.

He had been defeated in an instant with just a casual swipe of his hand. If his opponent had not held back, he would have died in that instant.

How could this man be so powerful?

But his aura was obviously at the level of a second-level Ruler?

“I was just giving you a warning. If you continue to nag and block our way, I will kill you directly,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Qin Feng could not help trembling.

“Your Excellency.” The second elder of the Ice Emperor Island came up quickly and said, “Thank you for your mercy. Qin Feng was indeed too reckless. I will take him to apologize to you.”

The second elder knew very well that the universe was dangerous. Even if Qin Feng killed him, it would not be a problem.

“Humph, let’s go.” Jian Wushuang snorted and left the tavern with his wife and Devil Flame.

Qin Feng was now well-behaved and did not dare to walk in the path of Jian Wushuang and the other two.

After Jian Wushuang and the other two left the tavern, the tavern immediately exploded.

“Wow, Qin Feng, the No. 1 genius of the Ice Emperor Island, was defeated with just one hand?”

“Not only defeated, but he would have died if he didn’t hold back.”

“That man is so powerful. But why does he seem to be at the level of a second-level Ruler?”

“He is a second-level Ruler. I don’t know if he deliberately concealed his aura or if he is only at this level. If he is really a second-level Ruler, then he is very powerful. After all, even the witch of the Universal Poison Demon Sect can’t defeat Qin Feng so easily.”

Discussions rang out in the tavern.

Qin Feng’s face was as red as a pig’s liver. The people of the Ice Emperor Island did not have the face to stay in the tavern any longer. Instead, they immediately set off for the Universal Poison Demon Sect.

After leaving the tavern, Jian Wushuang and the other two did not immediately go to the Universal Poison Demon Sect. After all, the grand meeting in the Universal Poison Demon Sect would not be held for a while, and Leng Ruxue did not seem to be back yet.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang decided to find an inn in a nearby city and stay there for the time being.

For the rest of the time, Jian Wushuang and the other two stayed in the inn while Jian Wushuang focused all his energy on refining the venom.

Buzz!

The soul in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness shook, and then it was directly destroyed.

A moment later, the destroyed soul recovered.

“I failed again.” Jian Wushuang shrugged, not surprised at all.

After learning that the venom could be refined by the soul, he had tried many times and failed every time. His soul had been destroyed countless times, but he was not anxious at all, instead, he continued to try again and again.

In a flash, five years passed.

“Haha, I finally succeeded.”

In a room in the inn, Jian Wushuang’s laughter rang out. Of course, the room was surrounded by restrictions, so his laughter did not spread out.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was sitting on the bed alone with a surprised smile on his face. In front of him was a drop of scarlet venom floating in the air.

The scarlet venom had been floating there. Previously, Jian Wushuang did not dare to touch it with his hands. But now, even if he swallowed the drop of venom, he would not be affected by it, let alone touch it with his hands.

After all, the drop of venom had been completely refined and controlled by him.

“After spending so much time, my soul has been destroyed more than 10,000 times. Now, I finally succeeded in refining this drop. Tsk, tsk, it’s really difficult.” Jian Wushuang could not help sighing.

Fortunately, he was a perfect life. Even if his soul was destroyed, he could rely on divine power to instantly restore it.

If it were anyone else, even the most extreme Ruler of the fifth level, it would be almost impossible for them to refine this poison. However, if an ordinary Ruler of the fifth level or a Ruler of the fourth level tried to refine this poison…it would be simply courting death.

Refining the venom would also be of great use to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and the Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his hand. Under his guidance, the floating scarlet venom slowly flew toward the Wuqi Divine Sword and directly merged into it, after the Venom entered the Wuqi Divine Sword, it disappeared. However, Jian Wushuang was the Ruler of the Wuqi Divine Sword. After refining the venom, he could clearly sense the existence of the venom.

The venom was inside the sword, but without his guidance, it would not display its power. However, as long as he willed it, the venom would immediately be activated along with the sword, while attacking the enemy with swordsmanship, the venom would also enter the enemy’s body along the sword, causing unprecedented damage.

“From now on, I will have another trump card in my hand.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had cultivated many trump cards, and many of them were very powerful.

For example, the dragon-killing secret skill, the primordial universe, and the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation formed by the three Heaven Suppression Tablets were all his trump cards, and they were all extremely powerful.

However, if measured by the degree of Terror, the trump card he had now was undoubtedly the most terrifying.

This was because the venom he had refined could kill even an ultimate level Ruler if he was not careful.

A Ruler below the ultimate level could not survive the corrosion of a drop of venom.

After refining a drop of venom, Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry to refine the second drop. After all, there were only three months left before the grand meeting of the Universal Poison Demon Sect.

During this month, Jian Wushuang and his wife had a good tour of the Thunder Star World. Three months later, they set off for the Universal Poison Demon Sect together.

At this moment, the Universal Poison Demon Sect had become especially lively because of the grand meeting. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This grand meeting was actually a genius banquet that was held every ten million years. Every time, the geniuses of the top forces of the Thunder Star World would compete to choose the strongest genius, this strongest genius had the chance to receive personal guidance from the star lord of the Thunder Star World. Of course, he would also receive some other rewards.

This genius banquet was held every ten million years. This was already common in the Thunder Star World. However, the reason why it was so special this time was that it attracted so much attention, in the end, it was all because of that peerless genius that appeared in the Universal Poison Demon Sect.
