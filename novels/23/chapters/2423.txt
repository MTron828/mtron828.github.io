Chapter 2424: Everything About Jian Wushuang (2)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shocking!

Yes, it indeed shocked the world!

It was Jian Wushuang’s formidable record that took the world by surprise. It was simply unbelievable.

It sounded so blatantly implausible that everyone thought the information was embellished.

However, that information was a fact.

“Monster!”

Countless people turned their heads to look at Jian Wushuang.

Even several other Narcissus Island disciples, including Zhong Yi and Su Tong, stared at Jian Wushuang in stupefaction.

They knew that Jian Wushuang must be gifted in sword principle to be able to pass the eighth trial bridge’s test, but they had never thought that he would have such an incredible past before entering Narcissus Island.

Profound Sword Principle Realm at 16 years old!

He suppressed two Great Second-Class Divine Demons and slew Third-Class Divine Demons at merely 19 years old.

‘How could a monster such as this appeared in the Wusha Wilderness?’

What blew their minds was that such a monster was their junior brother who was only an outer disciple in Narcissus Island.

If such a monster was only an outer disciple, what more could core disciples like them boast?

“It seems like this information is true.” Pang Tao could not help but glance at Jian Wushuang with a strange luster gleaming in his eyes.

He had to admit that Jian Wushuang’s record was invincible.

His name being called Jian Wushuang was not in vain1. His sword skills were indeed peerless.

“Jian Wushuang, according to the information collected by Great CompassionSect, both Elder Wujian of Narcissus Island and Bai Yue from Anjiu Commandery County had reached out to you after the battle.”

Pang Tao continued saying, “Well, Narcissus Island must have given you the best offer to join them. Bai Yue had contacted the Great Compassion Sect on your behalf and you were also offered to join the Great Compassion Sect as a core disciple. Bai Yue had also spoken to my master about your talent in sword skills and my master intended to recruit you as his personal disciple, but you turned him down!”

“You refused Bai Yue’s invitation, refused to join the Great Compassion Sect and refused the opportunity to become my master’s personal disciple. Instead, you accepted the invitation from Narcissus Island. What’s even funnier is that you chose only to be an outer disciple in Narcissus Island.”

Jian Wushuang, I really don’t know what you were thinking?”

Pang Tao did not hide his mockery tone.

His statements had once again sent the crowd into tumult.

“He refused the invitation to join the Great Compassion Sect and the opportunity to become a personal disciple of Fan Jianxian? T-this...” It was inconceivable.

The Great Compassion Sect was recognized as the top sect in Wusha Wilderness. Not only was the Great Compassion Sect the strongest in both powers and foundations, but they also had the most and best-talented disciples. The Twelve Minor Kings were a proven fact of their success.

The Great Compassion Sect took up four out of 12 seats of the Twelve Minor Kings. They were the young blood of Wusha Wilderness.

Many geniuses desired to be part of the Great Compassion Sect.

Many young cultivators were eager to join the Great Compassion Sect, but they were not given the opportunity.

Fan Jianxian, one of the three great Grand Elders of the Great Compassion Sect, and an Ultimate God Realm super expert were recognized as the top sword cultivator in Wusha Wilderness.

If one could be his personal disciple, it was tantamount to reaching the sky in a single bound!1

If one could be the personal disciple of a super expert like Fan Jianxian with both parties willing to religiously teach and learn, it was almost guaranteed that even a slightly talented person would become one of the Twelve Minor Kings in the future. There was also a possibility that one could advance into the Ultimate God Realm.

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang refused such a rare opportunity.

“He... He rejected such a golden opportunity?”

“Why did he reject it?”

Many disciples around were staring at Jian Wushuang with deep jealousy flashed in their eyes.

Of course, several reasonable disciples were more understanding.

“He could rival Second-Class Divine Demons in the Early Stage Chaotic Realm. I believe only such a peerless monster dared to bluntly reject Fan Jianxian.”

“Yes, such a monster is no longer limiting his horizon within Wusha Wilderness. He must have a greater vision. Although Fan Jianxian is capable, it’s not guaranteed if he was qualified to accept such a peerless monster as his personal disciple.”

“If I had talents like Jian Wushuang, I would also not go for Fan Jianxian. I would probably find an opportunity to be a disciple of a more powerful master, perhaps a Saint.”

There was a lot of discussion going on and each disciple had their point of view. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang, who was under everyone’s scrutiny and the topic of discussion, did not change his expression at all. It seemed as though he had nothing to do with Pang Tao’s claim and the heated discussion regarding him.

Once again, Pang Tao stared at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, the reason I’ve said so much is to address your talent in understanding the sword principle... You are indeed an incredible sword principle genius, a genius who is not confined by your realm. Among all those disciples who are good at sword skills and have entered the tomb, you are the one most likely to pass the eighth trial bridge’s test beside me!”

Hence, I immediately came for you when I learned that Narcissus Island is among the first three sects who entered the inner area and had confirmed your identity. I’m sure that you must be the one who passed the test of the eight trial bridge. The Purple Blood Saint’s inheritance is definitely in your hands now!”

Pang Tao said resolutely and full of confidence.

The surrounding disciples all looked at Jian Wushuang.

They had never heard of Jian Wushuang before. They did not think that Jian Wushuang could pass the eighth trial bridge’s test when they noticed that he was just a Chaotic Realm, so they were skeptical of Pang Tao’s statements.

They had since changed their viewpoints after knowing Jian Wushuang’s true details and his incredible past deeds.

The test of the eighth trial bridge was extremely difficult.

Perhaps, only an incredible monster like Jian Wushuang could pass the test.

On Narcissus Island’s side, Zhong Yi and Su Tong were exchanging looks.

They came forward to defend Jian Wushuang earlier, but it was useless for them to persist after Jian Wushuang’s information was exposed. Many disciples were convinced that Jian Wushuang had passed the test. Moreover, Pang Tao had also confirmed the matter, hence it’s useless for them to continue denying it.

Finally, Jian Wushuang raised his head as a smile crept onto his face.

“You are right. I’ve passed the test of the eighth trial bridge.”
