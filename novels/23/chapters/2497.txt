Chapter 2498: Compromised

“Humph!”

After a cold snort, a second dark red spear appeared in Strange Old Feng’s other palm.

He was holding two spears and gathering streams of terrifying divine power in his hands as he rifled both spears swiftly towards the golden barrier.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The spears drove towards the golden barrier over and over again. Hitting the same spot 13 times.

The pit that appeared on the barrier before gave way under the impact and began expanding in size but at the same time, it was recovering at an astonishing speed.

After receiving attacks from Strange Old Feng, the pit reverted to its original appearance and was still rapidly recovering.

“What?” Strange Old Feng frowned.

“It’s useless unless you can tear it down with a single blow or blast a hole through it. Otherwise, no matter how much impact you applied, it’ll instantly recover. You can’t escape.” Jian Wushuang explained with a cold voice as his figure appeared behind Strange Old Feng without warnings.

Hum... 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A grim and forbidding sword intent swept up.

Jian Wushuang kept a cold and distant look. The Blood Mountain Sword brandished at will in his hand. Sword-light filled the space as a sea of swords formed in an instant and inundated Strange Old Feng.

Strange Old Feng turned around immediately with his two spears emanating evil spirits. He decided to confront Jian Wushuang head-on.

Jian Wushuang was extremely powerful. Although he had not used the Seven Stars Secret Technique, his divine powers were much stronger than before from absorbing 3,500 Primordial Stones. He also had the one thousand feet Golden God Shadow behind him.

Those sword-lights spread out with each being extremely powerful and fast.

“This kid is strong. He’s only a Divine Demon, but his combat prowess is no lesser than mine and perhaps even stronger than me.” Strange Old Feng’s face got uglier as both of them engaged in a battle.

All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang’s figure briefly stopped.

The next moment, he dived steeply down with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand evolving into a long snake. There were harsh clattering sounds as the void was torn apart like a piece of paper with everything being dissolved into emptiness.

It was soundless and stirless with no traces of anything.

Except for a sword shadow that swept past.

Space-time Sword Technique, Third Form—Pure Shadow!

It was a sword technique created during his enlightenment from Fengtian Scroll in Saint’s Tomb, but Jian Wushuang never used it before when he fought against the Great Compassion Sect’s Ultimate Gods.

It was time for the Pure Shadow technique to show its powers.

Clang!

With loud clanging sounds, the spears in Strange Old Feng’s hands skewed slightly when collided with the sword shadow. The sword shadow was like a phantom as it went straight towards Strange Old Feng’s body. A layer of dim black light flashed on the surface of Strange Old Feng’s body in the form of a heavy barrier.

Bang!

Strange Old Feng was sent falling back while Jian Wushuang stood firm in place.

“Strange Old Feng has strong self-defensive abilities. I’m surprised my sword did not hurt him,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed as he muttered to himself.

“Jian Wushuang.” Yun Zhen finally arrived, entered the Golden Prison with Jian Wushuang’s permission, and appeared next to him.

“This prison...” Yun Zhen examined the Golden Prison around him and was amazed by its power. He speculated it would be hard for him to break out of the prison if trapped within it.

“Strange Old Feng, you have nowhere to escape. Just hand over the Purple Shimmer. Otherwise...” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice echoed in the Golden Prison.

Strange Old Feng replied angrily, “Jian Wushuang, there are no grudges between us but you have ill feelings for the Great Compassion Sect and Yun Zhen. All you want is the Purple Shimmer. Both of us should join forces and use your domain to teach Yun Zhen a lesson. The Purple Shimmer will be yours after you help me fight against him.”

Yun Zhen was irritated.

“I’ve already said before, the conflicts between me and the Great Compassion Sect have been resolved. I will not attack them. I shall take it by force since you are unwilling to hand me the Purple Shimmer. Lord Yun Zhen, let’s attack together,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Alright.” Yun Zhen nodded.

“Haha... So what if you both team up? So what if there’s this Golden Prison? You can’t kill me even if I’m unable to escape.” Strange Old Feng laughed arrogantly.

“We can’t kill you? Really?” Jian Wushuang smiled. The moment he finished his sentence, the golden divine power’s pressure went down on Strange Old Feng.

The Prison of Punishment was made up of Prison and Domain.

Prison traps the opponent and Domain oppresses them while improving the user’s powers.

The power of one party depletes while the other gains, widening the strength gap.

This technique was manifested to its fullest with Jian Wushuang’s thousand-feet Golden God Shadow.

“What?”

Strange Old Feng’s figure sank. Although he was an Ultimate God expert and had reached Peak Early-Stage Ultimate God, his power had been reduced rapidly under the golden divine power’s pressure. His strength had dropped by nearly 20 percent.

It was an awful percentage of power depletion to him.

“Go!” Jian Wushuang commanded in a low voice and attacked alongside Yun Zhen.

He had chosen to discharge his Seven Stars Secret Technique’s power and his divine power breath skyrocketed and was approaching the level of the First-Class Divine Demon realm.

Boom! Boom!

The two experts delivered their shots at the same time. Jian Wushuang’s sword skills were perfectly displayed whereas Yun Zhen was being overbearing. His big hands swung out again and again with each palm print turned into a giant ape, brown bear, tiger, and leopard interchangeably every time he drew his palm. Every palm was derived from extremely powerful and ferocious animals.

The combat power of High-Level Ultimate God was fully displayed by Yun Zhen.

As for Jian Wushuang, he relied fully on the support of elevated powers from the Golden Prison’s Domain and had soon attained combat powers equal to that of a High-Level Ultimate God.

It barely achieved that level of power as he was still slightly inferior compared to Yun Zhen. However, he was much stronger than Strange Old Feng, especially when Strange Old Feng’s power had been decreased by 20 percent.

It was a complete showdown.

Strange Old Feng had no room to repel the attacks and could only rely on his physical protection abilities to resist the attacks.

It would not last long and soon, he would give way as his body reached the limit.

Strange Old Feng had no means to escape while being trapped within the Golden Prison. His life-saving secret technique could not be used either.

Strange Old Feng was nervous.

“Stop! Stop!”

“Jian Wushuang, don’t you want the Purple Shimmer anymore? Okay, I’ll give it to you!” Strange Old Feng screamed as he obviously had no choice but to compromise.
