Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Rustle!

Nine shadows appeared at the same time. Jian Wushuang’s body became like a ghost’s and he appeared in front of the red-robed old man instantly.

The red-robed old man was the strongest out of the Universe Gods and his fighting capabilities were almost comparable to that of the experts in the Universe God ranking list. However, he was attacked by Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack. Before his consciousness was able to settle down, Jian Wushuang did a random stroke. The sword cut open the air and swept past the nape of the red-robed old man.

The red-robed old man’s head was sent flying.

Following that, Jian Wushuang’s body moved again and he shuttled back and forth within the crowd.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

While shuttling back and forth, icy-cold sword lights were unleashed one after another and every sword light was so chilly that it was fearsome.

In a split second, a breath’s time had passed and among the remaining thirty Universe Gods, sixteen of them had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

The remaining Universe Gods, whose numbers made up to less than twenty, were dumbstruck by the crazy massacre occurring in front of them.

“Run, run!”

“Run away quickly!”

“He’s too scary. He’s not human, he’s a demon!”

The Universe Gods escaped with all their might. In just a short amount of time, apart from Jian Wushuang and Long Ya, Universe God Xiong Fu was the only person still alive and standing at his location.

“Clap! Clap!”

Clapping sounds could be heard. Universe God Xiong Fu was clapping his hands and walking toward Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Brilliant, really brilliant!”

Universe God Xiong Fu giggled, “I did not expect you, Jian Wushuang, to actually be proficient in consciousness attacks. Moreover, your way of using the consciousness attacks is so impressive. This has really widened my perspective.”

Jian Wushuang was squinting his eyes slightly.

Although he was proficient in consciousness attacks, this information was not in the Universe God ranking list. Hence, there were not many people in Wu Bei’s cave who knew about this trick of his. If not, the Universe Gods from before would not have to guts to find trouble with him. After all, numbers were the least concern of experts who excelled in consciousness attacks!

Jian Wushuang’s Force of Soul had achieved the highest level of a Universe God. By using Crimson Phoenix, a Soul Attack, with his full strength, unless the consciousness of his opponent had also reached the highest level of a Universe God, he would be unable to block it. As for those Universe Gods numbering close to one hundred previously, over sixty of them were killed in a short while and only thirty of them, whose consciousnesses had reached the highest level of a Universe God, survived.

However, there were merely thirty Universe Gods. With Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion, there was only room for them to be massacred.

In addition, Blood Phoenix of the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack was an attack to attack a large group of people. In a one-to-one match, if Jian Wushuang had used the Soul Attack with his full power, even a consciousness which had reach the highest level of a Universe God would be unable to block it, unless the consciousness of the other party had achieved the level of a Real God.

“The people in the way have been taken care of. Now, it’s your turn,” Jian Wushuang looked toward Universe God Xiong Fu.

“You wish to fight? Bring it on,” Universe God Xiong Fu had nothing to fear. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Long Fu, please stay to one side,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood,” Long Ya nodded his head and retreated far away immediately.

In the huge void, only Jian Wushuang and Universe God Xiong Fu remained.

“I wish to see exactly how strong a person like you, who is ranked ninth on the Universe God ranking list, is!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and nine shadows appeared at once.

At that moment when he moved his body, Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with a dense crimson light.

The crimson light was like a crimson sun. Its scarlet color was dazzling and extremely charming.

Even Universe God Xiong Fu could not help but be captivated by the crimson sun.

All of a sudden, the Eighteen Asura Hell descended!

“A phantasmagoria?”

Universe God Xiong Fu frowned. He was already in the phantasmagoria.

“Break!”

With a shout, Universe God Xiong Fu broke out of the phantasmagoria immediately.

His consciousness had already reached the level of a Real God. Although Jian Wushuang’s phantasmagoria was strong, it was unable to affect him.

However, the moment he got out of the phantasmagoria, he realized that Jian Wushuang’s body had already appeared in front of him. At the same time, scarlet sword light headed toward him like crimson lightning. It was the Real God’s Unique Skill that Jian Wushuang had created, Crimson Light!

“Hmph!”

Universe God Xiong Fu gave a cold hum. He swung his right hand abruptly and a giant axe shadow brought the power of the universe around the area. The power was so enormous and mighty, it was as if the whole universe was being oppressed.

Clang!

With a loud sound, a great force caused Jian Wushuang to shake and stagger. In the end, he retreated a few steps continuously.

“Haha.”

Universe God Xiong Fu laughed sardonically. He then used both his hands and swung the two giant axes at the same time. The two giant axes were swung continuously and endlessly with every swing containing terrifying power.

Jian Wushuang had already activated the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor. He had also released his Divine Power fully. With that, he swung his longsword continuously to fight.

However, as he clashed with the giant axes time after time, the horrifying strength shook Jian Wushuang to the point that his arms felt some pain.

“What great power. I have already activated the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor. However, I actually cannot match him in terms of strength?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

When his Divine Power was combined with the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor, his Divine Power would not be inferior to that of a genuine Real God by much. However, he was actually unable to match Universe God Xiong Fu.

“Jian Wushuang, are your abilities only as such?”

The eyes of Universe God Xiong Fu, who was swinging his giant axes crazily to push back Jian Wushuang, shone with a fierce light, “You actually dare to fight me with this kind of strength? You are really overestimating yourself.”

Buzz!

Blood Qi burst forth from Universe God Xiong Fu’s body all of a sudden. His aura became even more fierce and violent. In addition, the power that his giant axes contained increased as well.

Universe God Xiong Fu had gotten his name due to his ferocity. His axe skills were absurd and fierce!

However, at that moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted. He then displayed the small portion of the Power of Spacetime that he had comprehended.

Buzz!!

Initially, Jian Wushuang relied on martial art motion to create the nine shadows. However, at that moment, with the addition of the small portion of the Power of Spacetime, Jian Wushuang had created a total of eighteen shadows!

Secret skill Flowing Light Phantom, stage three!

This martial art motion secret skill was directed against spacetime. At the first stage and second stage, there were not much requirement of the Spacetime Doctrine. However, at stage three, the practitioner had to possess a small bit of the Power of Spacetime in order to use it.

Jian Wushuang had grasped a small portion of the Power of Spacetime.

When he was moving around alone in Wu Bei’s cave previously, he did not come across any opponents who were exceptionally strong. His strongest opponent was Jiu Chou. However, Jiu Chou only possessed fighting capabilities to get into the top thirties of the Universe God ranking list. Hence, he was unable to force Jian Wushuang to use the Power of Spacetime.

It was until the very moment where he fought Universe God Xiong Fu that Jian Wushuang did not conceal any of his abilities. Instead, he unleashed his full power.

By using the Power of Spacetime, a total of eighteen shadows were created. His martial art motion and the speed that he could move in an instant were brought to a new level at that moment.

“This speed!” Universe God Xiong Fu was astonished.

He was also surprised by the speed that Jian Wushuang had unleashed all of a sudden.

“Universe God Xiong Fu, aren’t you powerful in terms of strength? I shall not compete with you in strength. Instead, I will rely on speed to kill you!” Jian Wushuang was filled with murderous intent.
