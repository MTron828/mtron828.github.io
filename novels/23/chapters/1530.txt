Chapter 1531: The Third Level Of The Cave

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Atop an isolated mountain in Wu Bei’s cave, the God Destroying King, a fragile-looking young man, was sitting down with his legs crossed. With a few days’ time, his Divine Power had more or less recovered. However, the damage that his consciousness had sustained would still require a period of time to recover.

At the very moment, he was staring at the new Universe God ranking list.

“Duan Lingfeng is second and Jian Wushuang is third?”

“These two brats…”

The God Destroying King’s eyes were glowing with a fierce, terrifying light.

Ever since he was first in the Universe God ranking list, no Universe Gods had made him so miserable before.

Not long ago, Zi Dongwang had also teamed up with three other Universe Gods who were in the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list to fight him. However, he had killed the three Universe Gods in that match and only Zi Dongwang managed to get away luckily.

From that moment on, Zi Dongwang had stopped thinking of challenging him.

However, at that very moment, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng’s appearance had caused him to feel pressured.

“I hope that I can still meet the both of you on the third level of cave…” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The God Destroying King smiled. After that, he closed his eyes.

…

Within a thick forest, Zi Dongwang was hiding.

He had no choice. Since he was proud and ambitious, he had offended quite a number of people. For example, close to half of the top twenty in the Universe God ranking list could not stand him.

Previously, he was at his peak and he was not frightened at all. However, after fighting with and being seriously injured by Jian Wushuang, his power declined drastically and it still had not recovered completely. As such, he had to be careful.

Zi Dongwang had also obtained the newest Universe God ranking list.

“Duan Lingfeng is second and Jian Wushuang is third. I am actually fourth now?”

“Damn it!!!”

Zi Dongwang bellowed.

Even though he had already guessed that this would happen after his match with Jian Wushuang, he still could not help but be furious and he even harbored hatred!

He resented Duan Lingfeng. However, he resented Jian Wushuang even more.

“Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng, both of you had better be prepared. I, Zi Dongwang, will definitely not accept a position behind the both of you!”

“There would definitely come a day where I seize my position on the Universe God ranking list back!!”

Zi Dongwang clenched both his fists and in no time, he continued to recuperate from his injuries.

…

Back then, when Zi Dongwang and Jian Wushuang had clashed and he was defeated by Jian Wushuang. He was the first to escape. Later on, Xin Zhu had also escaped.

However, the both of them separated from one another.

At that very moment, Xin Zhu was also in a certain place in Wu Bei’s cave and he was looking at the newest Universe God ranking list.

With regard to the newest Universe God ranking list, Xin Zhu could accept it.

“Previously, when the Vientiane Tower placed Jian Wushuang fifth in the Universe God ranking list, I was a bit dissatisfied. However, looks like I was just being arrogant. With his abilities, he has the right to take the third position. As for the five people in front of me, they are indeed stronger than me,” Xin Zhu no longer had any dissatisfaction.

He was different from Zi Dongwang.

Zi Dongwang was totally dissatisfied being below others.

However, Xin Zhu did not have such thoughts. As long as the other party’s abilities were sufficient, he would accept them.

Previously, he had questioned Jian Wushuang’s abilities. Hence, he attacked Jian Wushuang.

However, he no longer had thoughts of fighting against Jian Wushuang.

It was clear that Jian Wushuang was not someone he could compete with.

…

Although the newest Universe God ranking list caused quite a bit of uproar when it was disseminated in Wu Bei’s cave, many Universe Gods were able to accept the rankings on it.

Especially the three people who were the top three.

The God Destroying King, Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang. The abilities of these three experts were proven with their own fighting capabilities and there was no need to doubt them.

However, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng themselves did not care about the rankings at all.

The both of them were the same. They were not concerned with their reputation; they were only concerned with possessing absolute abilities.

Therefore, although the Almighties, many Real Gods as well as many Universe Gods were having a heated discussion as to who belonged in the second and third positions, they were too lazy to care about such a point.

No matter who was second or third, they were not too concerned.

Time passed slowly.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng had gradually recovered to their peak.

Finally, one month’s time was up.

Buzz! Buzz!

Space passages appeared in each and every corner of the second level of the cave.

Those space passages led to the third level of Wu Bei’s cave.

“Let’s go!”

“Let’s go to the third level!”

“The most valuable treasure in Wu Bei’s cave, as well as opportunities, are in the third level. Let’s hurry over quickly!”

Many Universe Gods who had completed their preparations a long time ago moved their bodies and headed into the space passage immediately. With that, they entered the space of the cave’s third level.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng did not hesitate and they entered the third level’s space too.

…

The third level was a spacious, open land.

The open land was not very big and it was hundreds of miles wide at best. However, rays of lights glowed and a huge number of Universe Gods appeared in the open land at the same time.

From the time Wu Bei’s cave had opened to the present, more than a hundred thousand Universe Gods had entered Wu Bei’s cave. Even though quite a number of Universe Gods had fallen after the crazy massacre on the first and second level, there were still a little more than a hundred thousand Universe Gods remaining.

At that moment, the hundred thousand Universe Gods had gathered on the open land at the same time.

“This is…”

“What’s going on? He actually gathered all of us here?”

“How exactly do we compete for the White Blaze Fruit tree?”

Many Universe Gods revealed a puzzled expression.

Within the crowd, there were naturally some people who were more conspicuous.

For example, God Destroying King.

He was standing in the center of the open land quietly. At the start, there were a large number of Universe God surrounding him. However, as soon as he made a move, all the Universe Gods surrounding him, including an expert in the Universe God ranking list, were all frightened away.

Moreover, there was Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng, who stood together.

“It’s Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng!”

“It’s the both of them?”

“Get away quickly, get away quickly!”

The Universe Gods around them also retreated to somewhere far away.

“Duan Lingfeng and I are not big demons who would start a massacre. Why are they so scared?” After seeing what had happened, Jian Wushuang shook his head and laughed.

“They are not afraid, they are being respectful,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang understood. When he looked around, he also saw the God Destroying King who was a distance away, Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu and many other similar people. All these experts who stood at the top of the Universe God ranking list had experienced something similar, where no one stood beside them.

That was the weak being respectful to the strong.

At that moment, at the void at the highest point of the open land, there was buzzing and the dim shadow appeared again.

“Haha. Little kids, welcome to the last level of my cave.”

“This level is different from the previous two levels. There will not be any killings. No one is to fight in the third level. If not… Not only will he not able to get the treasure at the end, he will also die, no matter who he is!”
