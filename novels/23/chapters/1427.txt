Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

There were many gasps from the room. They were obviously preparing to bid. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The lady in the red robe started the auction for the blood of a Royal Ancient God. The base price of the auction was already ten million Chaos Gems.

“The base price itself was ten million Chaos Gems. Isn’t it too high?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and said.

“Mister, you belittled the rarity of the blood of Royal Ancient God. For such precious blood, even if the base price was twenty million, there would be people bidding for it, let alone the base price of ten million. If there were to be someone who needed such blood, he would buy it no matter how high the price,” Tian Shi smiled.

As expected, not long after the lady in the red robe had announced the base price, there were people bidding.

“Twelve million Chaos Gem!”

“Thirteen million!”

“Fifteen million!”

Very soon, it exceeded the price that Star Pavilion offered and it continued to soar.

In the end, there was a Real God in the private room on the second floor who bought the drop of Royal Ancient God blood for the price of twenty-three million Chaos Gems.

“Twenty-three million Chaos Gems,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were beaming with joy.

From what he knew, an ordinary Real God’s entire property was about forty million Chaos Gems. Twenty-three million Chaos Gems were already half of a Real God’s entire property.

“It’s a pity that it isn’t easy to accumulate Ancient God blood. I only accumulated three drops over such a long period of time. If it were easy, I would like to get a few more drops to auction off,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Then, the auction continued.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the treasures that were auctioned but almost nobody made any offer.

Two days later.

“The next treasure that is up for auction is extremely unique. In terms of value, at this auction, it could be in the top three!”

The lady in the red robe spoke and every cultivator at the auction suddenly looked over.

The auction in Star Pavilion didn’t tend to save the best for last. Those previous treasures appeared randomly as they wanted.

The treasure that was going to be up for auction then was obviously one of the most precious treasures in the auction.

The lady in red robe took out the treasures. It was a scroll painting. It had yet to be opened but it had a terrifying sword intention that dispersed.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang, who was in the private room, saw the scroll painting and he immediately squinted.

He was interested in any treasure that was related to Sword Principle. The scroll painting was obviously related to Sword Principle.

The lady in the red robe continued to speak, “Everyone, as you’re wandering in Star land, I believe that there should be many of you who have heard of a Real God named Jue He?”

“Real God Jue He?”

“Real God Jue He who fell six million years ago?”

Hearing Real God Jue He’s name, many Real Gods in the private rooms revealed a surprised look.

“Real God Jue He?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows. He had just got to Star land not long ago so he naturally had never heard of Real God Jue He.

Then, Tian Shi by his side spoke, “Real God Jue He was once the Real God experts on the peak of Star land. His fame was not only in Star land but throughout the entire Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. When he was still alive, he occupied a space in the Real God ranking list!”

“Real God Ranking?” Jian Wushuang moved.

He didn’t know much about Real Gods. He never knew how to differentiate the power between Real Gods.

But he knew about the Real God ranking list.

On the Real God ranking list was gathered a bunch of top Real Gods in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. These Real Gods possessed a fighting power that could massacre a bunch of Real Gods easily.

For example, Lei Chao from Lineage of Star was an expert on Real God ranking list.

And because of Lei Chao’s strong power and his high position in Lineage of Star, he could even call Hall Master Yuan by his name. The other deacon elderlies in Lineage of Star would greet Hall Master Yuan politely.

Noticing the commotion at the auction, the lady in the red robe smiled faintly. She immediately continued, “The scroll painting for auction was the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation that the Real God expert formed with his understanding towards Reincarnation Doctrine and his terrifying Sword Principle.

The entire auction was in silence.

The next moment, the crowd burst into an uproar.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang who was in private, stood up directly. There was a light that fixed on the scroll painting below.

“The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation?”

“To flawlessly merge Reincarnation Doctrine with Sword Principle?”

“This…”

Jian Wushuang looked dumbfounded.

He had just become a beginner in Reincarnation Doctrine and mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation with the aid of Real God Hall.

Hence, it was a true Sword Principle cultivator and he was good at Sword Principle.

It was because of the battle to become a disciple of Star Palace previously, and due to the press of time, even if he improved tremendously in Sword Principle, it would be very difficult for him to safeguard his position as a disciple of Star Palace. Hence, he had focused on Soul Attack for the past years.

Regardless, Jian Wushuang had a swordsman living in him.

He was a born swordsman.

Regardless of the improvement on his Soul Attack, he was still best at Sword Principle.

Especially then, he had just become a beginner in Reincarnation Doctrine and mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation. Then, what he needed the most was to merge his Sword Principle and the Power of Reincarnation flawlessly. So that he could create an even stronger and more impressive unique skill. In turn, his understanding of Sword Principle increased tremendously.

It was the most pressing matter for him. He had originally planned to cultivate the first volume of Xue Mie Golden Body, then spend the rest of the time improving his swordsmanship.

Who would ever have thought that the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation which merged Reincarnation Doctrine with Sword Principle would appear when he needed it the most!

The Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation was simply tailor-made for him.

“Jian Wushuang, you were just a Universe God in the First Heaven previously. You were in too low of a realm and you were restricted naturally. To be able to create an advanced rank three unique skill was already your limit. But now that you have broken through your realm and mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation, it means that you have removed your shackles. Your swordsmanship is in an eruption period!”

“The eruption period is extremely hard to come by. If you were to get the aid of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation, you would prove to be even more amazing. So… For your power, get the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation at any cost!” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in his head.

“I understand.”

Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. He squinted his eyes as he held his fists tight.

He knew how much help the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation would be to him. He couldn’t miss such a treasure.
