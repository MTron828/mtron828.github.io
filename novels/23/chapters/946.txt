Chapter 947: Celestial Master

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?”

Jian Wushuang steadied himself and looked at the silver-haired elder who had made a sudden appearance in front of him.

Jian Wushuang possessed the strength of an Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God at the peak of the Three-star level, strong enough to suppress even Xia Tao with his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. Yet, this old man’s snort alone had sent his formation flying. What kind of strength was that?

“Jian Wushuang, be careful! This person ought to be a Rank Four Dao Master.” Gu King’s voice resounded inside him.

“Rank Four Dao Master?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “There are only three ranks for Dao Master, aren’t there?”

“There are four of them, but those in Rank Four are so much stronger than those in Rank Three that no one actually refers to them as such. People call them... the Celestial Masters!” Gu King said.

“Celestial Master?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Holy Master is the supreme level among Dao Masters, and this level isn’t something that you can achieve by opening up the fourth way. It needs other conditions, so only very few talents actually reach this level. Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Emperor Leng are only one step away from Holy Master, and can even be called halfway Holy Masters. However, they’re still not real Holy Masters at the end of the day!

“However, the one in front of you is a real Celestial Master.” Gu King said seriously. “Of course, Celestial Masters are strong but they’re nowhere near as powerful as the National Master and King Gu Tong. Those two have already surpassed the level of Dao Masters.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang was left breathless after hearing that.

The level of Holy Masters was indeed the supreme level out of all the levels for Dao Masters.

While Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Emperor Leng were top-tier Dao Masters, they were merely in the peak of Rank Three. They could barely be called halfway Holy Masters and were much inferior compared to the real thing.

Thus, the silver-haired elder in front of him was much stronger than Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Emperor Leng.

The Dao Masters fighting on the battlefield also noticed the silver-haired elder’s arrival. The faces of those in Emperor Xiao’s camp darkened with hostility.

“The Ancestor of the Xia Clan?”

“It’s him!”

“To think that the decrepit old man would still be in the Xia Clan after disappearing for so many years!”

Voices filled with fear resounded one after another.

“Xia Yong!” Emperor Xiao’s expression was exceptionally dark.

He was well aware of the strength of the Ancestor of the Xia Clan. The Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land might be able to suppress the clan when it was at its peak with Emperor Qing assuming personal command.

After all, Emperor Qing’s strength alone was almost comparable to that of the Emperor of Tang, who in turn was much stronger than the Ancestor of the Xia Clan.

Ever since Emperor Qing died and Emperor of Tang disappeared years ago, no one in the entire country could rival the Ancestor of the Xia Clan. That was the reason for the explosive growth of the clan’s power. Even Emperor Leng had to form an alliance with them through a political marriage.

The reason for all of this was the Ancestor of the Xia Clan, Xia Yong!

Xia Yong stood calmly in the Void, his eyes focused on another battlefield in the distance.

“National Master? There’s another person... Is it the legendary Ancient God Clan?”

Xia Yong was a little taken aback when he heard the horrifying sounds coming from the other battlefield.

Despite being a Holy Master, he dared not to get involved in a fierce battle like that.

“Ancestor.”

“Great Elder Xia Yu is dead, as is a couple of our Dao Masters. That includes my son, Xia Mang. The Immortal Army is also wiped out!” Xia Tao, who stood next to Xia Yong, said.

“Hm?” Xia Yong narrowed his eyes.

“It’s him. It’s all because of this little bastard. He’s the one who caused all this mess!” Xia Tao pointed at Jian Wushuang, looking a little crazed.

“Oh?” Xia Yong glanced at Jian Wushuang with hostility. Then, a whooshing resounded.

He pounced on Jian Wushuang as his body turned illusory.

“Oh no!”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Retreat, now!” Gu King shouted.

Jian Wushuang retreated as quickly as he could.

Not far away, two people were equally shocked to see Xia Yong attacking Jian Wushuang.

One of them was Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian. The other was Leng Rushuang.

They immediately rushed toward Jian Wushuang without hesitation.

“Damn it, he’s too fast! I can’t escape!”

Jian Wushuang turned to look at Xia Yong who was close on his heels. He put on an expression of grim-faced determination.?“If I can’t run, I’ll fight!”

There was also a trace of madness that flitted across Jian Wushuang’s face. His Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was drawing power at a maddening place, including a Divine Yin Thunder. It was promptly spat out.

“Ridiculous.” Xia Yong snorted and waved once. The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation flew backward again a blast of enormous power struck Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Puff!”

Blood spewed from Jian Wushuang’s mouth and his face immediately turned pale.

Xia Yong was about to attack again and kill Jian Wushuang. But right then, a sharp knife essence made him its target.

“Hm?”

Xia Yong looked at the Void near him in surprise.

There, a scarlet-robed Xue Lingtian emanating such potent killing intent that it was as if he had bathed in a bloody sea. Xia Yong saw him raise his saber.

The sharp knife essence had originated from this saber.

“That saber...”?Xia Yong narrowed his eyes.

He could sense that the saber in Xue Lingtian’s hand was so extraordinary that no ordinary Emperor Weapon was its rival. Not even a top-tier Emperor Weapon could emit such a strong killing intent.

“Interesting.” Xia Yong smiled and stood there waiting for Xue Lingtian’s sword light.

Xue Lingtian’s face was a little warped as he accumulated power in his saber. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This was the strongest move he could make so far. He simultaneously triggered a Secret Skill contained in the saber at the risk of sustaining grievous injuries.

This saber was from his Master Xuan Yi. The Secret Skill contained in the saber was certainly extraordinary.

Finally, the power accumulating in his saber came to a peak. Xue Lingtian then swung his saber downward with a terrifying roar.

The blade light swept through the Void and cleaved it in half.
