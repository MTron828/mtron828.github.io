Chapter 1548: Blood Demon World

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Blood Demon World in Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom.

Blood Demon World was made of a dozen worlds and it had a vast territory.

Blood Demon Church was the overlord of Blood Demon World, the true local tyrant.

Blood Demon Church could also be considered a strong force, even within Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom.

Blood Demon World was one of the many worlds. In a pavilion in an ordinary city, a man and a woman sat together. The man was a middle-aged man in loose, long robe while the woman was a beauty in a white robe.

From their behavior, they should be husband and wife.

“Husband, it has been three days, why hasn’t Protector Jin Yan arrived?” The beauty in a white robe creased her eyebrows.

“Don’t worry. Protector Jin Yan already messaged me. He will be here soon,” the middle-aged man said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I feel that Protector Jin Yan isn’t reliable. He is from Blood Demon Church after all. The people from Blood Demon Church are all demons,” the beauty in a white robe looked concerned.

“Shh,” the middle-aged man signaled her to keep quiet and he said, “It’s okay if you say that elsewhere but in Blood Demon World, don’t speak recklessly. Otherwise, we might be killed.”

The beauty in a white robe felt her heart skip a beat.

“Actually, I know that there’s a risk asking for help from experts in Blood Demon Church. But we have no choice. Only they can help us with the trouble we’re having. Otherwise…” The middle-aged man sighed and felt helpless too.

If it wasn’t because he had no choice, he wouldn’t get involved with anyone in Blood Demon Church.

Then, a few figures walked into the pavilion at the same time. The one walking at the front was a blonde, brawny elderly.

Both the middle-aged man and the beauty in a white robe stood up simultaneously as they saw the people.

“Protector Jin Yan,” the middle-aged man greeted with a smile.

The blonde, brawny elderly who walked in the pavilion glanced at the middle-aged man and he looked calm. But when he saw the beauty in a white robe behind him, there was a change in his expression and there was a strange look in his eyes.

“Haha, Universe God Qi Yi, right? Come, let’s sit and discuss,” the blonde, brawny elderly, Protector Jin Yan, smiled as the three of them sat by the table. Then, the middle-aged man poured some wine.

“Protector Jin Yan, sorry to trouble you to get involved personally. My wife and I shall raise our glasses in a toast,” the middle-aged man, Universe God Qi Yi, raised his glass.

“You’re welcome.”

Protector Jin Yan smiled as he looked towards the beauty in a white robe. After chugging the wine, Protector Jin Yan said, “Universe God Qi Yi, the favor that you asked for is quite troublesome. Even I have to spend some time and effort to take care of it. If you really want to resolve this, you have to show some sincerity. With the agreed price, it might not be enough.”

“Not enough?” Universe God Qi Yi creased his eyebrows. Actually, the price he had paid was already very high, but he was well prepared as Protector Jin Yan was a man in Blood Demon Church.

“I wonder what else Protector Jin Yan needs. I will prepare for you immediately,” Universe God Qi Yi replied.

“You don’t have to prepare anything. The thing that I want, you have it right now,” Protector Jin Yan said.

“Oh?” Universe God Qi Yi looked confused.

“Actually, it’s nothing major. I’d like your wife to serve me for a while. Not long, maybe about a hundred or two hundred years will do,” Protector Jin Yan said casually.

“What?” Universe God Qi Yi’s face suddenly grew grave.

The beauty in a white robe next to him was terrified too.

“Protector Jin Yan, your joke is not funny at all,” Universe God Qi Yi had already stood up, anger raging in his eyes.

“I don’t have the time to make a joke with you,” Protector Jin Yan’s face grew cold too. “Your wife has to serve me for two hundred years. Otherwise, I will not help you.”

“Humph, you will not help. There will be other people who are willing to help. Jun Er, let’s go,” Universe God Qi Yi pulled the beauty in a white robe by her arm and wanted to leave.

“Hold on,” Protector Jin Yan smirked coldly, “Although the deal didn’t go through, I can’t be making a trip for nothing, right? How about this? The price that you offered previously, forget about it. But your wife has to stay.”

“Protector Jin Yan, don’t go overboard!” Universe God Qi Yi and the beauty in a white robe was angry.

“Overboard? Haha, this is Blood Demon World and Blood Demon Church rules here. I can do whatever I like. Who can do anything to me? You should blame your wife for being so enchanting that I can’t stand the temptation,” Protector Jin Yan scoffed as he stood up, “Brothers, go and catch the beauty for me. When I’m done with her, all of you can take turns for her to serve you.”

“Haha, thank you Protector Jin Yan.”

The few Universe Gods who stood at the side looked excited. Their burning gazes fixed onto the beauty in a white robe.

“B*stard!”

Universe God Qi Yi was angry and his aura suddenly soared.

“This annoying Universe God Qi Yi, just kill him!”

The few Universe Gods from Blood Demon Church had a sudden murderous intention and… hong!

A massacre was suddenly induced. The exquisite pavilion instantly broke into parts from the impact of divine power.

Universe God Qi Yi and the other few people’s figures instantly soared up in the void above the city and they startled the cultivators in the entire city.

“Husband!”

The beauty in a white robe had a green sword in her hand as she rushed onto the battlefield.

However, although the couple were Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, their opponents were five Universe Gods in the Second Heaven.

Plus, there was Protector Jin Yan, who was a Universe God in the Third Heaven, watching by the side.

“Humph, just a Universe God in the Second Heaven and he wants to counter-attack?”

Protector Jin Yan smirked in disdain and he fixed his gaze on the beauty in a white robe, “Don’t hurt my beauty. I have to take good care of her.”

With a malicious smile, Protector Jin Yan moved and appeared behind the beauty in a white robe. He extended his hand to grab her shoulder.

“Husband!”

The beauty in a white robe was frightened and went as pale as a sheet.

“You evil Jin Yan!!!”

Universe God Qi Yi let out a shrill roar that shook the heavens and earth.

Just as Protector Jin Yan’s palm reached for the beauty in a white robe’s shoulder, vroom!

A shapeless force suddenly soared over from nowhere and Protector Jin Yan’s smile immediately stiffened. The few experts from Blood Demon Church who were besieging Universe God Qi Yi looked terrified too. The next moment, the few person’s gazes grew dim and their bodies fell helplessly.

That sight shocked all the cultivators in the city who were watching the battle.

In the void, Universe God Qi Yi and the beauty in white robe were shocked at the sight.
