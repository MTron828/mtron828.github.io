Chapter 4028: Venom

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Soon, Jian Wushuang selected the Principle Supreme Treasures for Leng Rushuang and Devil Flame.

Leng Rushuang chose the long whip, while Devil Flame chose a blood-red cprinciple divine weapon. These two Principle Supreme Treasures greatly improved their strength.

The two Principle Supreme Treasures, together with the special gems, only cost Jian Wushuang around 600 universe origin stones. Jian Wushuang had needed the golden origin divine fruit to cultivate the supreme eternal celestial body, therefore, he owed the Nine Emperor Pavilion a sum of universe origin stones.

This time, Jian Wushuang also paid them back. Even so, he still had some single origin stones left from the interspatial ring. In addition, Jian Wushuang had obtained them from Star Demon ancestor and Devil Cloud Star Ruler, in addition to his years of collection, Jian Wushuang still had about 500 universe origin stones left in his hand.

“Chief Ballmer, I have a list of treasures here. See if you can gather all the treasures on this list in a short time.” Jian Wushuang handed over another list of treasures.

!!

Ballmer took it with a smile. His eyes swept over it, but the smile on his face instantly froze.

“Blood, Blood Sword…” There was something wrong with Ballmer’s voice.

“Why? Don’t you have any treasures in the Nine Emperor Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“No.” Ballmer shook his head. “As long as there are treasures in the universe, the Nine Emperor Pavilion can basically get them. It’s just a matter of time. Blood Sword, I can gather 70-80% of the treasures on your list, but there are still a few treasures that need to be transferred to other territories. But I can guarantee that I can gather all of them and send them to you within 1,000 years.”

“Within 1,000 years?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

“Blood Sword, do you think that time is too long?” Ballmer looked over.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

1,000 years was indeed too long for him. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, Ballmer gave a strange smile. “Blood Sword, you don’t have to worry about the time. After all, with the existence of the universe passage, it’s not impossible to speed up. What you should really care about is the value of these treasures.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He could tell from Ballmer’s words that the treasures on this list were of extraordinary value.

Jian Wushuang was not surprised by this.

The list of treasures he took out was exactly what he needed to cultivate the fourth level of the supreme imperishable celestial body.

The supreme imperishable celestial body was an internal star secret skill from the Lingyun Star. It was of a very high level. He had already cultivated the first three levels at the level of a Principle Ruler, and his divine body was comparable to the most powerful supreme treasure, which was considered heaven-defying.

From the fourth stage, the supreme eternal celestial body could only be cultivated in the Ruler realm. Naturally, Jian Wushuang had now reached the threshold of cultivation. However, he had enough cultivation conditions, but he needed supplementary treasures to cultivate, he did not have them, so he could only place his hopes on the Nine Emperor Pavilion.

However, in order to Ruler the third stage, he needed many treasures, including a golden origin divine fruit.

The value of the golden origin divine fruit was very high. If it was auctioned well, it could be sold for nearly 100 universe origin stones.

Many of the treasures needed to cultivate the fourth level of the supreme eternal celestial body were on the same level as the golden origin divine fruit, and there were more than a dozen treasures more valuable than the golden origin divine fruit.

Naturally, it was very difficult to gather all the treasures on the list.

“Ballmer, just tell me, how many universe origin stones do you need to gather all the treasures on this list?” Jian Wushuang asked. He was mentally prepared.

“Blood Sword, you’re on the Nine Emperor List and a guest of the Nine Emperor Pavilion. I won’t hide it from you. If you gather all the treasures on this list, you’ll need at least 8,000 universe origin stones. This is because of your identity and there’s no time limit. If it’s someone else who needs to send them over as soon as possible, they’ll need to wait even longer!” Ballmer said.

“8,000 universe origin stones?”

Even though Jian Wushuang was mentally prepared, he was still shocked when he heard this number.

“8,000 universe origin stones?” Devil Flame could not help but sigh, “An ordinary fifth-level Ruler only has hundreds of universe origin stones, while some peak fifth-level Rulers only have about 2,000 to 3,000 universe origin stones. 8,000 universe origin stones is comparable to the total wealth of an Ultimate Ruler.”

“For me, at my peak, my total wealth is only about 10,000 universe origin stones.”

“I thought I had killed Nine Whiskers and obtained his interspatial ring. In addition to my previous collection, my wealth is relatively rich, but I didn’t expect it to be so far behind.” Jian Wushuang shook his head with a bitter smile.

“Blood Sword, you’re a friend of the Nine Emperor Pavilion, and you’re listed on the Nine Emperor List. Therefore, you have some privileges in the Nine Emperor Pavilion. You can apply to get these treasures first and then pay back the universe origin stones in the future. However, there are more than 8,000 universe origin stones, so the amount is a bit too big. You need to get the approval of some higher-ups of the Nine Emperor Pavilion. I can help you apply, but it’ll take some time to get an answer,” said Ballmer…

“No need.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

He was not that eager to get the treasures. He also knew that although he was on the Nine Emperor List, it would not be easy for him to borrow more than 8,000 treasures from the Nine Emperor Pavilion.

“By the way, Ballmer, I have some special items. I don’t know their specific value. I wonder if you can appraise them for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course, no problem.” Ballmer was very enthusiastic and patient.

“I just got these things not long ago,” Jian Wushuang said while waving his hand and taking out jade bottles.

There were 12 jade bottles in total. Each of them was made of a very special material and even had the effect of shielding the soul power from detection.

If the stopper was not opened, it was impossible to know what was inside the jade bottles.

Looking at the jade bottles floating in front of him, Ballmer felt a little curious. Then, he opened one of the jade bottles and poured his soul power into it.

“This is…” Ballmer suddenly widened his eyes.

There was only a drop of scarlet liquid inside the jade bottle. Although it was liquid, it gave off an extremely cold feeling. The moment Ballmer’s soul power touched this drop of liquid…he instantly felt as if his entire soul was about to be completely frozen.

“Poison? Is this poison?” Ballmer looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Yes, it’s poison.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.
