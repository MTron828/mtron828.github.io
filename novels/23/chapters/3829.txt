“Devil Flame, you said that it’s a luxury for me to absorb these two Life Core Fragments?” Jian Wushuang asked with a strange expression.

“Yes.” Devil Flame nodded. “In the vast universe, it’s an extremely wasteful thing to absorb the power of the universe to comprehend the principles of the universe. Master hasn’t comprehended the laws of the universe before, so it’s fine if you’re so extravagant. But now that you’ve comprehended a trace of the principles of the universe, it’s a bit irrational to be so extravagant.”

“But what’s the use of this Life Core Fragment other than absorbing the power of the universe?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“For you, master, the only use is to absorb the power of the universe by force. But for many cultivators in the vast universe, it’s completely different,” Devil Flame said seriously, “I told you before that the Immortal Ghost’s entire body is a treasure, and the most important thing is its life core. That’s what countless Supreme Beings are fighting for. Although what you have now is only a Life Core Fragment, its value is still extraordinary.”

“Let’s not talk about Supremes, let’s talk about Rulers. In the vast universe, countless Rulers yearn for universe principles. Unfortunately, there are very few who can comprehend a trace of universe principles at the Ruler level. Even when I was at my peak, I wasn’t able to comprehend a trace of universe principles.

“Master, the Life Core Fragment in your hand can allow you, a Principles Master, to comprehend a trace of universe principles, let alone a Ruler. I’m sure that any Ruler who has reached the ultimate level can easily comprehend a trace of universe principles if he can obtain a Life Core Fragment like this. So, Ruler, can you imagine what will happen if those Rulers know about this Life Core Fragment?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Devil Flame had only said half of his words, but Jian Wushuang had already understood.

The life core of the Immortal Spirit Demon was priceless. Even if it was just a Life Core Fragment, it was enough to make many Supreme Beings covetous and countless final-level Rulers go crazy.

Such a treasure was not very useful in his current strength. Even if he forcefully absorbed it, it would at most improve his universe principle a little. It would not increase his strength much, however, if he were to venture into the depths of the universe in the future, these two Life Core Fragments would be of great use.

At that time, he only needed to casually spread the news that he wanted to sell the Life Core Fragments of Immortal Demon. He believed that countless Rulers would come looking for him, and they would pay any price to buy the Life Core Fragments from him, at that time, he could use these two Life Core Fragments to exchange for enormous benefits, or he could simply exchange them for a large amount of wealth. It would be much better than forcefully absorbing the power of the universe during this period, it was much better to slightly improve on the universe principles.

“You’re right. These two pieces of Life Core Fragments are not very useful to me now, but they are much more useful to others. I don’t need to forcibly absorb the power of these two pieces of Life Core Fragments to improve a small part of my strength. I’d better keep them for now. When I need them in the future, I’ll take them out.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

After putting the two Life Core Fragments back into his interspatial ring, Jian Wushuang set off and headed out of the Dark Magic Region.

......

After several days, Jian Wushuang finally walked out of the Dark Magic Region.

“I’m out.”

After leaving the Dark Magic Region, Jian Wushuang could not help but glance at the dark red forest behind him, which was emitting a cold and gloomy aura. He sighed in his heart, ‘The Dark Magic Region is definitely a forbidden place in the eyes of countless cultivators. In the history of this star area, there were only three top Rulers who survived the Dark Magic Region. However, from today onwards, there are four.’

“I, Jian Wushuang, have also survived.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

His trip to the Dark Magic Region had brought him great gains, which had completely met his expectations.

He was very satisfied with himself.

In the future, he might come to the Dark Magic Region again to explore the deepest secrets of the Dark Magic Region, but it would definitely not be in the near future.

“Xuan God, Temporal, Heaven-cleaving, and Divine Ancestor, I have come out of the Dark Magic Region.” Jian Wushuang immediately sent a message to his four good friends.

These four people knew that he had gone to the Dark Magic Region.

As for his family and friends in the Divine Beginning Realm, they only knew that he had gone to the battlefield outside the Divine Beginning Realm, but they did not know what kind of dangerous place he had gone to. After Jian Wushuang came out of the Dark Magic Region, he also greeted them.

In Star Palace.

After learning that Jian Wushuang had come out of the Dark Magic Region alive, Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, Divine Ancestor were all very excited.

“Haha, he has come out. My young friend, the Heavenly Marquis, has really walked out of the Dark Magic Region alive. That’s great!” Daoist Xuan God laughed heartily.

“Tut, tut, it’s good that he has come out. I was worried that he would die in there,” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said with a sigh.

“Yes, the Dark Magic Region is such a dangerous place that even a Superior Ruler would have a slim chance of survival. In the history of our Star Field, only three Superior Rulers have walked out alive. Who wouldn’t be worried about such a dangerous place?

“Fortunately, our young friend, the Heavenly Marquis, has survived. From now on, there are already four people who have survived the Dark Magic Region. Moreover, our young friend, the Heavenly Marquis, is only a Principles Master.” Temporal Temple Master was also full of smiles.

“Our young friend, the Heavenly Marquis, is indeed amazing.” The Divine Ancestor said these words heavily.

The four of them were shocked when they heard that Jian Wushuang was going to the Dark Magic Region. They tried many times to get rid of the idea, but they could not stop him.

After Jian Wushuang entered the Dark Magic Region, the four of them were afraid that Jian Wushuang would die there.

After all, Jian Wushuang was too important to them and the entire Divine Beginning Realm.

That was their only chance.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had come out alive, so they were relieved.

“Xuan God, ask him quickly. Did he gain anything in the Dark Magic Region?” Temporal Temple Master asked.

“I’m already asking.” Daoist Xuan God smiled and soon got an answer, “My young friend, the Heavenly Marquis, said that he did gain something in the Dark Magic Region, and it’s not small. At least it has reached his expectations. But he didn’t say what exactly he gained, and I didn’t ask.”

“It’s fine as long as he has met his expectations. We do not care about anything else.” The Temporal Temple Master smiled. “Right, since he has already left the Dark Demon Region, he should return to the Star Palace right away, right?”
