Chapter 1145: Three Universe Masters

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You want to suppress me?”

Jian Wushuang sneered and then swished one of his hands to summon a golden gourd.

He pulled out its plug to release Blaze Quicksand.

Soon enough, his Blaze Quicksand turned into a violent storm, ripping the two giant hands into pieces. Even Seven Stars Pagoda started shivering under the impact of the storm.

“How did he do that?”?Tianhuan King thought in astonishment.?“What treasure does he hold in his hand? Even my Seven Stars Pagoda can’t withstand its attack.

“Alas, I can’t take it anymore. If this storm continues, my pagoda will be destroyed.”

With this in mind, Tianhuan King became increasingly pale. She quickly waved her hands to open the gates of the pagoda. The Blaze Quicksand rushed out of the pagoda, so did Jian Wushuang.

“Shoo!”

Jian Wushuang revealed himself in the void, surrounded by quite a lot of remaining Blaze Quicksand.

Three experts popped out in front of him, coming with amazing auras.

“This aura is…”?

Jian Wushuang looked at them with a frown.

“One of them must be Tianying King, but who’re the other two? Their auras are as strong as, no, slightly stronger than that of Tianying King.

“Wait a minute, the two are Universe Masters!

“No, all the three of them are Universe Masters!”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“It seems that the Jin Kingdom really takes me seriously. It even sends three Universe Masters to ambush me.” Jian Wushuang said smilingly.

“You brat, did you discover us in the pagoda in the very beginning?” Tianhuan King asked while looking coldly at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and replied without hesitation.

Before entering Seven Stars Pagoda, he had believed it to be a newly-emerged treasure instead of a trap. He had even been looking forward to getting the pagoda to recognize him as its owner.

However, upon entering this place, his Strength of Soul quickly detected that there were three experts hiding inside this pagoda.

As such, he realized that he had stepped into a trap set by his enemies from the Jin Kingdom.

He was not afraid after knowing that it was a trap, since now he was much stronger than before.

“Jian Wushuang, your aura gets stronger. If I guess correctly, you’ve already reached the levels of a Dao Master, haven’t you?” Tianying King looked at Jian Wushuang and asked. He had engaged Jian Wushuang in battle before and thus knew this young man better than the other two Universe Masters did.

The last time Tianying King had met with Jian Wushuang, he could tell from the young man’s aura that he still remained at the level of Eternal Realm, but now Jian Wushuang’s aura was exceptionally strong and it appeared even more powerful than that of an ordinary Holy Master.

“Yes, I have. It’s just a sheer fluke,” Jian Wushuang replied smilingly.

“You’re a Dao Master now. No wonder you could stay calm and collected after realizing that the pagoda was a trap,” Tianying King squinted his eyes and said. “But even if you’re Dao Master now, faced with us, you’re dead.”

“I’m dead? I don’t think so.” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Tianying King, why bother talking so much with him? Just go ahead and finish him off. If you guys are not ready. I’ll go first.” With these words, Golden Rock King, who was obviously the most impatient person among the three Universe Masters, came at Jian Wushuang, a giant axe in each of his hands.

His arm muscles bulged so much that blue veins stood out on them. He poked through the void and dashed toward Jian Wushuang with amazing speed and ferocity.

Even a Holy Master would shudder with fear in the face of such a combative Universe Master.

However, Jian Wushuang got somewhat blood-thirsty and even smiled upon seeing that.

The next moment, Gu King said to him, “Jian Wushuang, the levels of these three Universe Masters in front of you aren’t very high. With your current powers, you can defeat anyone of them in an one-on-one fight, but you can’t take on three Universe Masters at once… Fortunately, you have Blaze Quicksand Gourd. Once you summon Blaze Quicksand Realm, they won’t be able to resist it. At that time, you can stay or leave as you wish.”

“I know,” said Jian Wushuang. “However, this fight has just begun. I don’t plan to use my Blaze Quicksand Gourd prematurely.”

He had his own plan.

He had just become a Dao Master and experienced a surge in his powers. He had been looking forward to fighting against some well-matched opponents to see how great his new powers were.

For him, these three kings from the Jin Kingdom came just in time. He would have never wanted to miss such a wonderful opportunity.

“Well, I’ll play with them for some time before leaving this place with the help of my Blaze Quicksand Gourd. But just in case, I need to report this incident to my Palace Masters.” With these words, he sent a message to his Palace Masters.

After that, he summoned his Blood Mountain Sword and confronted Golden Rock King.

“You brat, you’re dead!”

Golden Rock King shouted, as he struck a giant axe at Jian Wushuang with shocking ferocity. The axe had already been expanded to more than three meters long and was now enveloped in clouds which were blood red in color.

“Boom—”Loud friction sound could be heard as the axe cracked through the void. It sounded as if even the heavens and the earth could not withstand the impact.

Jian Wushuang still looked calm.

Since reaching the levels of a Dao Master, his strength had been significantly upgraded. At this moment, the Ancient God Power inside his body was surging wildly, so was his Spiritual Power. His powers would vent out at any minute.

“Heaven’s Bane!” Jian Wushuang shouted out the name of his move, a strong killing intent flickered in his eyes.

The next moment, a dazzling beam of intense sword light was shot out. Heaven’s Bane was the most powerful offensive skill amongst all the techniques of his Swordplay of Coalescence.

As its name implied, Heaven’s Bane could shake the sky so much so that it would look as if it were about to shatter into pieces at any minute. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Before the dreadful sword light hit the ground, the ground had begun to shatter. A crack as long as several thousand kilometers could be seen below the sword light now.

“Is he serious? He’s just become a Dao Master and he dares to butt heads with Golden Rock King? Is he that eager to die?!”

Tianhuan King and Tianying King were stunned upon seeing Jian Wushuang’s reaction. They stayed near to Golden Rock King, but none of them felt it necessary to join the fight to help their partner at this moment.

“Boom!”

Jian Wushuang’s Sword Essence suddenly turned into a shower of swords raining down on his enemy and poking numerous Black Holes in the void.

Jian Wushuang shook his body and then darted toward Golden Rock King like a bullet. He slammed into the king, causing him to retreat a dozen steps from his original place. For every step he took, he stamped on a piece of the void, smashing it into pieces.

“Haha, come at me again!”

Jian Wushuang’s laughter resounded in the void, and before his enemies realizing what had happened, he appeared in front of them again, calm and steady. The moment he took a firm stand in the void, he readied himself to launch the second round of attacks.

He rushed toward Golden Rock King again with an amazing aura. His aura was as strong as before, which meant that he did not get hurt at all during his previous clash with the Universe Master.
