Chapter 2981: Heaven and Earth Palace, Qian Chen

——

The heaven-designated skill could freeze time and space for a short period of time.

This move was one of Jian Wushuang’s trump cards.

With Jian Wushuang’s current divine power and comprehension of the space-time rules, ordinary immortal saints would not be able to resist this move.

However, Jian Wushuang did not use heaven-designated skills to attack Prince Qian Chen. Instead, he used it to attack the dazzling milky way, which was the saber technique Prince Qian Chen used.

Buzz! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Affected by the heaven-designated skill, the space-time around the dazzling milky way froze, and the milky way stopped in its tracks.

Although the time-space stagnation had disappeared in an instant, and the brilliant milky way continued to sweep out, Jian Wushuang had already dodged to the side.

Whoosh!

The brilliant milky way passed through the void where Jian Wushuang had been, but it did not touch the corner of Jian Wushuang’s clothes.

Jian Wushuang easily dodged the most powerful move of His Highness Qian Chen.

“Awesome!”

Qian Chen stared at Jian Wushuang with a gleam in his eyes. “My move is not only powerful but also locked onto him during the process. Logically, he shouldn’t have been able to dodge my move. He had to face my move head-on, but he dodged it?”

“It’s the secret skill he just used!”

His Highness Qian Chen was very knowledgeable, so he could see the reason at a glance.

“He just used a secret skill, causing the space-time where my saber light was to pause for a short time. This pause also caused me to lose my lock on him, so he was able to dodge it easily. What a strange secret skill.” His Highness Qian Chen praised in his heart.

What he admired was the secret skill Jian Wushuang just used.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s face was also extremely solemn.

As he had expected, Prince Qian Chen had hidden his trump card. Just like that saber move, the power was really terrifying.

If he did not have the heaven-designated skill, he would probably have to take out the mountain and river design to block it.

Whoosh!

Prince Qian Chen moved forward again, but he only took two steps before he stopped in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Heaven and Earth Palace, Qian Chen!” Prince Qian Chen directly told Jian Wushuang his name and origin.

“Heaven and Earth Palace?” Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat, but he also understood.

He had long guessed that this black-robed young man had an extraordinary background and was likely from the three palaces of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Now it seemed that this was the case.

“A Peak False Saint with the battle strength of a second rank True Saint, this is the genius of the three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and it’s only the lowest level of heaven and Earth Palace.” Jian Wushuang secretly sighed.

He had met Long Yun and Xue Yu, who also claimed to be from the Palace of Heaven and Earth.

However, he only knew about Long Yun and Xue Yu, but he did not know how strong they were. After all, they had never shown their true strength. Only Xue Yu showed some of his strength and easily killed a rank one True Saint, but that was nothing.

Now that he had seen Qian Chen with his own eyes and witnessed his strength, Jian Wushuang knew how high the level of the genius of the Heaven and Earth Palace was.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Jian Wushuang said his name.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are very strong, really strong. With you, I can’t kill the rest of your team. It seems that I can’t get the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse.” His Highness Qian Chen sighed.

“Qian Chen, you want the body of the Dragon Flame Beast for the mission of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“Yes.” His Highness Qian Chen nodded directly.

“As expected.” Jian Wushuang was not surprised at all.

He had just heard His Highness Qian Chen mention the word ‘Mission’, so he had guessed the origin of His Highness Qian Chen.

“The mission I received this time is to come to the Dragon Flame World and snatch the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse in your hands. There were a total of twelve teams in the Dragon Flame World that originally had the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse, but during these twelve days, I’ve already found eight teams and defeated all of them. The Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse in their hands naturally fell into my hands.

“Originally, you were the ninth team that I found, so the result should be the same as the other eight teams. But I didn’t expect there to be an expert like you in your team. It seems that I won’t be able to complete the task this time,” Prince Qian Chen said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was stunned, but everyone in the Barbarian King Team was shocked.

They did not know until now that there were so many teams that had accepted the task of killing the Dragon Flame Beast. Moreover, since those teams could kill the Dragon Flame Beast and obtain its corpse, their battle strength would not be much weaker than their teams.

But in the end, eight teams had been defeated by this expert called Qian Chen.

They had no doubt that their squads would have followed in the footsteps of the eight squads if it were not for Jian Wushuang.

“Qian Chen, did you just say 100%? Does that mean that even if you don’t get the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse, you will only lose some of your mission quotas?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, although this mission is not very challenging for me, after all, I have to deal with 12 squads at once, so it is inevitable that I will fall behind. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance won’t judge me as a failure just because I have one or two less Dragon Flame Beast’s corpses. They will only judge my mission completion quota.”

“Now, I definitely won’t get the Dragon Flame Beasts’ corpses in your team, so I can only complete 90% of the mission quota. Of course, I will only get 90% of the mission reward in the end,” Prince Qian Chen said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“It’s only 10% of the mission reward. It’s nothing to me. To be able to fight with an expert like you is already a big harvest for me.” Prince Qian Chen had already put his saber back into its scabbard, he crossed his arms and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I’ll remember you. If we have the chance to meet again, we’ll fight again.”

“Goodbye!”

After saying that, Qian Chen turned around and left.

Jian Wushuang and the Barbarian King Team watched Qian Chen leave quietly. No one dared to chase after him.

“Qian Chen from the Heaven and Earth Palace? Interesting.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but he was a little curious.

He was curious about the three palaces of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

After witnessing the strength of the three palaces of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, Jian Wushuang was naturally curious about the three palaces.

However, despite his curiosity, Jian Wushuang still did not plan to join the three palaces. After all, he had too many concerns.
