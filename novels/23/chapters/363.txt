Chapter 364: A Close Fight

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Holy Emperor Palace is in danger this time!”

The words resounded in all the hearts of the spectators, as well as the experts of Holy Emperor Palace.

The Protective Array had already been broken. The Aeon Devil-killing Formation, consisting of 18 Saint Realm experts, collapsed, and 13 of them were killed. It seemed that only the four Holy Masters were qualified to block Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, they all fixed their eyes on the four Holy Masters. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The four Holy Masters all wore a grim look.

As First Holy Master took a step forward, the other three Holy Masters followed.

They stood side by side, in front of Jian Wushuang, as four powerful streams of aura began to emanate from them. First Holy Master’s aura was the most powerful, far superior to the other three.

“Four Holy Masters!”

The whole Holy Emperor Island became quiet.

All the spectators stared at the four Holy Masters in awe.

The four Holy Masters had a great reputation.

Holy Emperor Palace had been the top sect for thousands of years, with many top experts in their long history.

But it was the four Holy Masters that helped Holy Emperor Palace reach its real peak.

The four Holy Masters all reached the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. Especially First Holy Master, he was a complete monster.

The Alchemy School had been placed at a disadvantage, simply because they did not have an expert who could fight against First Holy Master.

Now, these four experts, who represented the supreme battle strength of Holy Emperor Palace, came out to fight.

They teamed up with each other to fight this enemy.

“Please try your best to help me kill the boy,” First Holy Master said in a low voice.

Upon hearing this, the other three Holy Masters nodded heavily. Then... Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

They directly rushed forward.

“Four Holy Masters!”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and gazed at his opponents, who were all supreme existences in the Nanyang Continent.

Now he needed to fight all four of them.

“Come on,” Jian Wushuang said with a cold look.

A surge of overwhelming battle intent rose from within him.

Whoosh!

Second Holy Master was the first to strike a blow against Jian Wushuang.

“Boy, go to hell!”

Second Holy Master looked ferocious. He held a blood-red Giant Hammer, which was a second-grade magic weapon that weighed over 5,000 kilograms.

But he easily swung the Giant Hammer as if he was holding a goose feather. Scarlet waves lashed toward Jian Wushuang.

When Jian Wushuang raised his hand, preparing to parry it, Fourth Holy Master, who stood opposite him, suddenly let out a snarl, causing a hail of terrifying sound waves to sweep forward.

The sound waves tried to pierce through Jian Wushuang’s body, but his body was too strong and seemed indestructible. It only made Jian Wushuang pause for a short time before he continued to lift his longsword.

The Giant Hammer smashed against the Triple-kill Sword.

Boom!

A terrifying boom was heard as the overwhelming power erupted. Second Holy Master attacked from above, which placed Jian Wushuang at a disadvantage. Under the influence of the sound wave, Jian Wushuang had to lean back.

Jian Wushuang suddenly felt a flow of cold aura behind his back.

His expression changed. Force of Gale and Thunderbolt gushed out as he stepped back, then a streak of black light happened to pass by his waist.

After he regained his balance, Jian Wushuang realized it was a black dagger, covered with black venom. A cold woman held the dagger while staring at Jian Wushuang with hostility. She was Third Holy Master.

“Nice try,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

He suddenly raised his head and saw the spectral image of a huge beast. It was an enormous Demonic Ape, which was hundreds of feet tall. Its body almost seemed to cover the whole sky, and First Holy Master stood at the center of the Demonic Ape Phantom.

Along with his soaring aura, the silver-haired elder had sparks of killing intent in his eyes. In an instant, the Demonic Ape moved, appearing before Jian Wushuang. First Holy Master, wearing a pair of pitch-black gloves, clenched his right fist and began gathering a stream of terrifying power in his right hand.

“Origin of All Beasts!”

Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised. He had once fought with an expert who mastered Origin of All Beasts.

Such experts were adept at close fights!

“I’m not afraid of a close fight!” Jian Wushuang roared.

He withdrew his Triple-kill Sword as a surge of power gathered in his hands. His body changed into lightning and rushed forward.

He released several punches, using only his bare hands. With his outburst of strength and Spiritual Power, every stroke he launched was extremely powerful and terrifying.

First Holy Master’s fists, wrists, knees, and even fingers became magic weapons. Like a real giant ape, he was fighting with Jian Wushuang in close combat.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Violent booms reverberated throughout the whole area. Each confrontation caused invisible waves to spread out; a big storm of energy formed in the surrounding area.

After Jian Wushuang and First Holy Master had more than 100 confrontations, suddenly...

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang shot back hundreds of meters. After stabilizing his body, he looked at himself. His clothes were ragged, exposing his strong muscles, copper-colored skin, and countless marks that were left on his body.

The marks were all caused by fists or elbows.

Only a single palm print was left on First Holy Master’s body, but First Holy Master looked pale.
