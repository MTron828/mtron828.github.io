Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Palace Master Yun, are the seeds of our Green Fire World ready?” Samsara Temple Master looked at Palace Master Yun next to him.

“They’re ready.”

Palace Master Yun replied with a serious nod. “We have selected one million disciples from various forces, populations, and countries on Void Continent and Samsara Continent. We have accommodated them in a specially reserved place. We’ve opened our Portal so that they can be transferred here anytime.”

“One million?” Samsara Temple Master and the other Palace Masters around him were dumbfounded.

In the face of this type of calamity, they must prepare for the worst.

One million genius disciples might seem adequate, but they were actually insignificant in the entire Green Fire World.

One must know that on the Samsara Continent, some medium populations might have a population of more than one million.

This was the best they could do. They could not get everyone inside the Battle Fortress. It could not hold that many people, but one million at most. Thus, they only chose some promising junior disciples.

“Palace Master Yun, I’ll leave these disciples to you.”

Samsara Temple Master said in a low voice. “If we win, then everything will be fine. But if we lose… the Green Fire World will die, and we will all die fighting. You must train these young disciples. In the future, you’ll continue to fight the Jin Kingdom and bestow our wrath on them!”

“Even if we’re trapped beasts, we won’t leave the Jin Kingdom peaceful on this battlefield in the following long years!”

“I want to see those Jin Kingdom experts forever suffering from our wrath!”

“I know!” Palace Master Yun nodded gravely. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They had already discussed the final battle.

In this battle, all the top experts in the Green Fire World would fight with the Jin Kingdom, but however, Palace Master Yun had to stay. He had to govern the Battle Fortress and prepare for a future counterattack.

Finishing his words, Samsara Temple Master took out two red-gold elixirs.

“I have two elixirs.” Samsara Temple Master spoke.

These two red-gold elixirs smelled disgusting like the smell of blood.

Other Palace Masters all looked at the two elixirs.

“This elixir is called the Blood Fire Elixir. A long time ago, I found it on this battlefield and I got four of them.”

Samsara Temple Master continued, “Five million years ago, our Green Fire Palace has fought against them fiercely; we were supposed to lose that battle. In the end, we won and killed the Jin Kingdom monarch’s one consciousness doppelganger because our then two Palace Masters consumed Blood Fire Elixirs!

“The Blood Fire Elixir will burn your Cultivation and life so that you can put up a fierce fight!”

“Of course, it can also make you have a greater strength in a short time!”

“Now there are two Blood Fire Elixirs left, I will take one of them, I wonder who wants to take the other.”

Samsara Temple Master smiled and looked around.

Other Palace Masters all frowned.

The Blood Fire Elixir was so deadly that even these Palace Masters were a bit scared.

But at this time, three figures darted out.

They were Void Temple Master, Tang Emperor, and Red Lotus Palace Master!

Perhaps those newly born Palace Masters feared this elixir, but they would not hesitate.

“Why? Are you two going to take away my elixir?” Samsara Temple Master looked at the person next to Tang Emperor and Red Lotus Palace Master.

“Haha, I’ve already seen my best days. I’ll never compare with the Jin Kingdom Monarch. Now there’s this opportunity for me to do something helpful, how will I give up?” Tang Emperor smiled.

“I’ve lived my life. If I have one chance to surge my strength before I die, I’ll happily take it.” Red Lotus Palace Master also laughed.

Void Temple Master, Tang Emperor, and Red Lotus Palace Master had prepared to die.

Although they sounded casual, every one of them knew what it meant to swallow the elixir.

Their strength would soar rapidly, but they would pay with their lives!

“Time waits for no one, I’ll be the judge. Void, you’ve lived long like me, and your strength is better. I’ll give you the elixir. We’ll make the Jin Kingdom hurt.” Samsara Temple Master said.

“Sure.” Void Temple Master smiled and took the Blood Fire Elixir.

Tang Emperor and Red Lotus Palace Master exchanged glances and both sighed.

“Void, after I swallow the Blood Fire Elixir, I will hold back the Jin Kingdom as long as possible. Then, when you’ve swallowed the elixir, you’ll kill as many Jin Kingdom experts as possible. As for the remaining experts, you’ll need to gain us time as well!”

“We have to hold on until Jian Wushuang wakes up!” Samsara Temple Master said solemnly.

The present Palace Masters looked at Jian Wushuang unanimously.

During their discussion, Jian Wushuang was still meditating.

Seeing him, the Palace Masters all smiled.

They knew very clearly that Jian Wushuang would be their last hope.

As long as Jian Wushuang broke through, they would have the chance to turn the tables on the Jin Kingdom!

“Samsara Temple Master, the Jin Kingdom experts will soon bypass the Battle Fortress!” Another Palace Master reminded.

Samsara Temple Master’s face became cold. “If that’s the case, let’s fight to the death!”

“Green Fire World soldiers, let’s… kill!”

Samsara Temple Master shouted the word “kill” emotionlessly, the soldiers in the Battle Fortress all echoed him roaring!

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Their roaring could almost shake the world.

On the Perimeter of Battle Fortress, a Portal leading to the outside appeared.

In the Green Fire World, except Jian Wushuang and Palace Master Yun, all the top experts… all Palace Masters, Celestial Masters, and Dao Masters looked did not flinch from their enemies. Following Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master through the Portal, they rushed outside to confront the Jin Kindom army.

Everyone had prepared to die.

Everyone was crazy!

They must fight against the Jin Kingdom to the death!!!
