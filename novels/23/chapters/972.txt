Chapter 973: Give Me a Reason!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Everyone present stared at the most brilliant genius in the history of the Green Fire World.

“Three big countries? Humph!”

Jian Wushuang’s cold stare stunned the experts from the three big countries as his cool voice reverberated in the air. “It seems like the three big countries have been particularly arrogant during the time that I was gone and Tang of the East is heavily injured after the war.”

The face of the experts darkened.

Jian Wushuang continued, “Tell the rulers of the three big countries that I give them three days—three days for them to give me a reason! If not, be prepared to endure my wrath!”

He headed straight for the imperial palace, ignoring them.

The experts exchanged looks before immediately hurrying off to deliver his message to their rulers.

Many top-tier experts from Tang of the East had already gathered at the palace encapsulated in a giant formation. They stared at the young man with reverence as he walked slowly toward the formation.

These men were old, some of them many times Jian Wushuang’s age.

Even so, they greatly respected him.

After all, it was power that earned one respect in this world.

Jian Wushuang’s strength justified their reverence for him.

Jian Wushuang inched closer to the crowd amidst everyone’s stare. His eyes were completely fixated on one person.

HIs attention was on a devastatingly lovely woman that would put any beauty to shame.

It was Leng Rushuang.

Though her aura remained as cold as ever, she stared back at Jian Wushuang with a tinge of surprise and delight in her eyes.

When she woke up and discovered that he was dead, she became overwhelmed with grief. She wouldn’t have survived all these years had Emperor Xiao not tell her that he was still alive.

Now, he was in front of her again.

“I’m back,” he whispered.

“Hm.” She gave a small nod in response.

Without the need for redundant words, the simple gesture of exchanging greetings drew intense passion from their eyes.

The most important things were left unspoken.

“Father and Uncle Yun are waiting for you after receiving word of your arrival. Come with me,” Leng Rushuang said.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded and followed her to the ground level of the imperial palace.

Inside the palace, he saw his sworn brothers, Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan.

They were naturally delighted.

After a quick exchange of greetings, he entered a great hall.

A layer of Restriction separated the five people inside the hall from the world outside.

These people were Jian Wushuang, Leng Rushuang, Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and a curvy lady in a aquamarine robe.

“Jian Wushuang, this is Dao Master Spirit. She’s responsible for building the formation. If not for her, those from the three big countries would’ve entered the imperial palace long ago,” Emperor Xiao explained. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Nice to meet you, Dao Master Spirit.” Jian Wushuang bowed to the curvy lady.

“You’re too courteous, young man.” Dao Master Spirit stood up to exchange the greetings, humility and respect written all over her face. “Your talent is unparalleled in history. It looks like we’ll have an extraordinary existence in our world soon.”

“You’re too polite.” Jian Wushuang smiled, getting a good first impression of Dao Master Spirit.

In fact, she and Sunrise Sword Emperor were the creators of one of his killing moves, the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

When the show of courtesy was done and over with, Emperor Xiao addressed Jian Wushuang and said, “When Wang Yuan told me that you’re still alive, I didn’t really believe him. But I’m glad that you’re back at a time when Tang of the East is facing its biggest crisis ever.”

“When I was recovering, I’ve already heard about it from Brother Wang Yuan. It’s indeed horrible,” Jiang Wushuang said solemnly. “Emperor Xiao...”

Before he could finish his sentence, Emperor Xiao interrupted him. “Don’t call me Emperor. If you’re willing to, you can call me Uncle Xiao. Either way, you’re more or less a couple with Shuang’er. We just need to conduct the wedding.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned but soon let out a smile.

Beside him, Leng Rushuang blushed without saying anything.

“Let’s discuss business first.” Emperor Xiao chuckled. “The experts from the three big countries now reside outside the palace. We’ve relied on Dao Master Spirit’s formation all these years to defend the palace. Unfortunately, though her formation is strong and durable, it can’t last much longer.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked surprised.

“I used some special methods and treasures to craft the formation, allowing us to defend against the experts of the three big countries. However, these methods require a huge energy input,” Dao Master Spirit explained.

“I replaced the energy needed with a treasure called the Eternal Gem. However, I only have three gems and each can only maintain the formation for around 500 years. I’ve already finished two gems and the third one is being used up now. The formation can, at most, stand for another 400 years.”

“Eternal Gem?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“The Eternal Gem is a treasure that contains a huge amount of energy. It’s rare even in the Eternal Chaotic World. Dao Yuanzi, an expert from the Blood Killing Sect, has numerous treasures but only two of these gems.” Gu King’s voice resounded in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Only two?” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Two gems would only buy them 1,000 years of time. The impact was negligible.

Moreover, he refused to hide inside the imperial palace.

“When I entered the palace, I passed a message to the ruler of the three big countries, ordering them to give me a satisfying response. They’ll respond as long as they’re not stupid or hotspurs,” Jian Wushuang said.

The rest looked at each other and smiled.

Jian Wushuang was indeed a huge threat to the three big countries.

No one in the Green Fire World would dare look down on him.

Not even the unearthly and saint-like Master of the Void Temple dared to underestimate him.
