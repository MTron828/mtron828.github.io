Chapter 2486: Explanation

“Didn’t you ask what I want to do? Let me tell you now.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold as it echoed throughout the world.

“Listen, I want you to think carefully after you go back and give me an explanation which satisfies me and relieves me of anger. Otherwise, I’ll have to pay the Great Compassion Sect a visit in person to ask for it. You may have a strong background, so strong I may not be able to do anything against you. However, mark my words, as long as my anger persists, I’ll stay at the Great Compassion Sect’s entrance and kill anyone who steps out of the sect until the last disciple and expert!”

“How dare you!” Lei Chong yelled furiously.

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. “Try me. In addition, my patience is limited. I’ll give you one month’s time at most. Within a month, if the Great Compassion Sect fails to give me a satisfactory explanation, I will do as I’ve said!”

Lei Chong’s face was pale. “Very well! Let’s wait and see!”

“Go,” Lei Chong yelled. The Great Compassion Sect’s three Ultimate Gods as well as their disciples Long Zishan, Yu Aoqing, and the others, did not linger around and soon left.

Jian Wushuang watched the Great Compassion Sect and the others leave without stopping them.

After the Great Compassionate’s people had left, Jian Wushuang turned around and was about to leave, but stopped abruptly after taking two steps.

“By the way, I remember when I walked out of the tomb, the Great Compassion Sect was not the only sect who wanted to attack me.” Jian Wushuang razor-sharp eyes swept across the remaining sects’ experts around.

The complexion of those experts instantly turned pale.

Even Great Compassion Sect’s three Ultimate Gods who stepped up could not do any harm to Jian Wushuang and were defeated!

If Jian Wushuang were going to get even with the other sects, it would most probably end up...

“Humph, all of you who planned or had your disciples to do something to me in the tomb when I had a bounty... I remember all of them, so you better think about how to calm my anger. Otherwise...” Jian Wushuang sneered and his laughter made those experts’ scalps numb.

Jian Wushuang ignored those sects and slowly walked in the direction where Narcissus Island’s people were.

In the void where Narcissus Island’s disciples were located, Elder Linghe and the Seventh Elder were trembling.

Elder Linghe subconsciously came forward to greet him upon seeing Jian Wushuang’s approach.

“Jian Wushuang...”

Elder Linghe spoke, only to find that Jian Wushuang was not interested in her. He merely walked past her and appeared in front of Elder Wujian.

“Brother Wujian, nothing happened to my parents, right?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

His attitude towards Elder Wujian remained gentle and because he was no longer a disciple of Narcissus Island, he did not address Wujian as an Elder. Instead, he addressed Wujian as Brother Wujian, which was also quite cordial.

“Don’t worry, my friend. Your parents are safe,” said Wujian.

“Thank you, Brother Wujian. I’m going back to Anjiu Commandery now. You can let my parents go back too,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Alright.” Wujian nodded slightly.

“If you ever come to Anjiu Commandery in the future, you can visit me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Definitely.” Wujian was touched.

After that, Jian Wushuang glanced at Zhong Yi, Su Tong, Wei Qing, Xiao Heng, and the other disciples behind Wujian. He nodded politely and turned around.

“Big Sister, I’m going back to Blazing Moon City now. Do you want to go together?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

At the Ancient Star Temple, Zhuo Bing immediately stood up. “Yes, I haven’t been back to see our parents for a long time.”

Zhuo Bing rushed towards Jian Wushuang. The Ancients Star Temple Elders and Ling Dan did not hold her back anymore.

“Let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang and Zhuo Bing set off to leave, heading to the Blazing Moon City in Anjiu Commandery.

The various sects’ experts who were present exchanged looks and felt complicated.

Especially the two Narcissus Island Elders—Elder Linghe and the Seventh Elder.

After Jian Wushuang walked out of the tomb, Jian Wushuang did not even glance at the two of them, let alone greet or speak to them.

“We shouldn’t have made a decision so quickly! We should’ve waited longer for Jian Wushuang to come out of the tomb and observe his true strength before making a decision.” Elder Linghe’s face was distorted in anguish.

“No, the Lord was not wrong in making a timely decision. Only then can Narcissus Island not be implicated, but what we didn’t expect is that Jian Wushuang’s strength has improved so much after his trip to the tomb. Even the three Great Compassion Sect’s Supreme Elders were defeated by him!” The Seventh Elder clicked her lips.

They felt sorry for Narcissus Island.

What a terrible loss of a genius.

A Divine Demon who could defeat three Ultimate Gods at the same time. His combat power might have easily surpassed the Lord of Narcissus Island.

Jian Wushuang was still young with huge potential. His future was bright and limitless.

How great if such a genius disciple belonged to Narcissus Island?

Although Jian Wushuang was only an outer disciple and did not have much sense of belonging in Narcissus Island, if they did their best even if it were only symbolic to help him instead of chasing him out, perhaps Jian Wushuang would have felt very differently towards Narcissus Island.

His sense of belonging might even have improved.

Sadly, they had sent this superior demon away.

Of course, they were regretful!

On the side, Elder Wujian sneered, “Huh, do you know how stupid the decision was? You are stupid and so is the Lord. You don’t even know how incredible Jian Wushuang is, nor try to see his potential before making a decision. What’s the point of regretting it now? It’s useless. Jian Wushuang no longer belongs to Narcissus Island.”

Both Elder Linghe and the Seventh Elder were even more ashamed after hearing Elder Wujian’s words. They could not but feel helpless when they thought of what could have been a better outcome.

After Jian Wushuang left, the experts and genius disciples of the various sects on the glade also left one after another.

Many sects left in a hurry as Jian Wushuang had made it clear to them.

Those sects who had taken action against Jian Wushuang were on pins and needles. They must return to their sects immediately and discuss with their leaders how to deal with this matter.

The trip to Saint’s Tomb finally ended.
