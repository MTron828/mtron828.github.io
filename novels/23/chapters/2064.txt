2065 Fighting at the Ancient God Clan

Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai and the rest attacked the base of Vientiane Tower, where they had killed Great Emperor Zi Xu.

Within the Eternal Chaotic World, branches of Vientiane Tower that were located in different places among the tribes and sanctuaries received devastating blows.

Even though Vientiane Tower had high social standing and power, it was nothing compared to Sanctuary Alliance.

Sanctuary Alliance was the true ruler of the Eternal Chaotic World. If she wanted a certain force to disappear, no one could stop them.

Within months, Vientiane Tower ceased to exist. All that was left were spies within different sects and clans. These cultivators were not strong enough to pose a threat. Furthermore, Sanctuary Alliance had gotten a list of most of these spies when they’d destroyed Vientiane Tower.

These cultivators would also face certain death.

The large Dark Millstone stood tall in the dark void. However, it stopped spinning,

Deep in the Three-Emperors World, in the endless void.

“Idiot! This Zi Xu is an idiot!”

“I have already reminded him to be extra careful as Emperor Bai knew that there was a spy in Sanctuary Alliance. What happened in the end? He exposed himself!”

“To make matters worse, he even exposed Vientiane Tower. Acheron Palace spent so much time and effort on building a Vientiane Tower, and all our efforts went to waste because of this idiot!!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s face was dark and he roared in anger. His aura turned extremely violent.

This time around, Acheron Palace had lost too much.

They had lost both Great Emperor Zi Xu and Vientiane Tower.

Even though Acheron Palace had used large amount of resources to nurture Great Emperor Zi Xu and to get him to be one of the higher ups of Sanctuary Alliance, this loss was still acceptable.

During the final battle against the Eternal Chaotic World, his powers as a great emperor had been limited.

However, Vientiane Tower was different.

It was the number one information department given that it was the number one enterprise within the world and the influence they had was great.

During the war, it could pass messages, cause internal fighting among the Eternal Chaotic World, or change the tide of the war. There would be enormous benefits that could be reaped.

Vientiane Tower was much more important to Acheron Palace than Great Emperor Zi Xu.

Now, however, Vientiane Tower was destroyed with nothing left to salvage. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

All the effort that Acheron Palace had spent over the years had gone to waste. How could the Demon King Chen Yu be not angry when he was the leader?

Leng Ruxue and Kaiser Blood, who were on the other two thrones in the void, were in a bad mood.

“Acheron Palace planned to insert different people into the Eternal Chaotic World so that they could be of help during the final battle. Now this plan has been foiled by Sanctuary Alliance. Our chances of winning during the final battle has dropped from seventy percent to sixty percent.” Leng Ruxue said.

Sixty percent. Even though there was an advantage, this advantage was no longer distinct.

“This happen all because of that idiot Zi Xu!” Demon King Chen Yu roared in anger.

“Now that Zi Xu is dead, it’s pointless trying to blame him. We should be doing our best to prepare for the battle by concentrating our forces properly. Furthermore, we should speed up our plans for the Special tribe.”

“Chen Yu, the responsibility of the plans belongs to Acheron Palace. You have to pay close attention. Do not make any errors.”

“Do not worry. The Special Tribe is different from humans. It is easier to deal with them. Furthermore, Acheron Palace is well prepared and we will not allow for any more accidents. We can settle things there within a century.” Demon King Chen Yu said confidently.

“Do not be overconfident.” Leng Ruxue glanced over at Demon King Chen Yu. “The matters there are of utmost importance. If any more accidents happen we will have no more advantage. Hence, I have sent some of my people over.”

“Yes. With the help of Holocaust Sect, we can be more assured.” Kaiser Blood said as he nodded his head in approval.

Demon King Chen Yu face turned a shade darker, but he did not argue.

“Oh. I have some good news for you both.” Leng Ruxue said.

Kaiser Blood and Demon King Chen Yu looked over.

“Three days ago, Lord Fen transmitted a message to me. He said that not only has his injury healed fully, but he’s also managed to improve his fighting power.

“Oh?” Kaiser Blood laughed, “That’s great. Now with Lord Fen, our fighting power at the highest level will once again improve. Now our chances of winning are better.”

However, Demon King Chen Yu squinted his eyes slightly and looked like he was happy. He muttered quietly to himself, “Lord Fen became stronger once again? He had an edge over me before his injury. Now that he has become stronger, won’t he be able to overpower me? Kaiser Blood is also stronger than me. I am currently the weakest. Damn it!

Demon King Chen Yu said nothing more even though he was angry deep down inside.

Sanctuary Alliance, Thunderbolt Island

“Emperor Bai, are you looking for me? What happened?

Jian Wushuang received the message from Emperor Bai and rushed over.

“Now that Vientiane Tower is destroyed, the powers that Acheron Palace inserted in Eternal Chaotic World are gone. Our next step is for Sanctuary Alliance to rally the various forces in Eternal Chaotic World and concentrate all the experts. Then we will have the final battle against the Three-Emperors World, Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace that resides in the Dark Millstone,” he said to Jian Wushuang.

“It is easy to gather the experts in Eternal Chaotic World. With the possible repercussions there could be, ninety-nine percent of the experts will gather here. However, we might encounter some problems with the Special Tribes. I need you to go down personally.” Emperor Bai said.

“Special Tribe?” Jian Wushuang heart skipped a beat.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, there was segregation between human tribe and special tribe. Usually, these two tribes would not interact with each other. However, when the survival of Eternal Chaotic World was at stake, the two tribes would cooperate and work with each other.

“What will happen with the Special Tribe?” Jian Wushuang said as he frowned.

“I do not have the exact details, but there are troubles between the four biggest tribes, especially Ancient God Clan. From what Sanctuary Alliance told me, it seems like the Ancient God Clan is having a civil war right now.” Emperor Bai said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang turned pale.

Among the different Special tribes, he had a deep connection with the Ancient God Clan.

His bloodline, Bloodline of Ancient Clan, was closely related to the Ancient God Clan.

But now, the Ancient God Clan was having a civil war?
