“I’ll just sell it off, but I want only Divine Elixir Pills for this and not a single Primordial Stones,” replied Jian Wushuang flatly.

“Please wait for a moment in that case. I have to discuss with the supervisor to determine the final purchase price,” said Qian Qin before she turned and left.

Purchasing ten catties of Royal Blood Gem was not something a Golden Chief could call the shots.

In a dimly lit room...

“Royal Blood Gem...” The purple-robed supervisor of the Star Picking Pavilion looked solemn. “This is the main refinement material for Holy Treasures. Some among Danyang Holy Domain’s top forces may keep some Royal Blood Gems for possible future demands, yet we have someone that wants to sell his Royal Blood Gem to us now. This must be our lucky day.”

“Master, the Royal Blood Gem weighs around ten catties. I don’t know how much we should pay for it,” explained Qian Qin.

The purple-robed supervisor asked, “He insisted on trading it only for Divine Elixir Pills, right?”

Qian Qin confirmed, “Yes.”

“We can only trade up to three hundred Divine Elixir Pills in this sub-pavilion. It’s obviously not enough to pay for the ten catties of Royal Blood Gems. I’ll immediately send a message to headquarters and ask them to send us more Divine Elixir Pills. We can offer him five hundred Divine Elixir Pills but he has to wait a few days,” said the purple-robed supervisor.

“Five hundred Divine Elixir Pills? Isn’t it too little?” Qian Qin puzzledly asked.

“Indeed, five hundred Divine Elixir Pills aren’t enough, but Su Han is probably in dire need of some Divine Elixir Pills. Otherwise, he won’t put up something so precious for sale. Five hundred Divine Elixir Pills may seem slightly less, but he should agree as long as he urgently needs it. If that doesn’t work then add in some Primordial Stones,” suggested the purple-robed supervisor.

“Alright.” Qianqin nodded.

She returned to the secret chamber Jian Wushuang was located after a while.

“Master Su Han, I’ve discussed with the supervisor in charge, and the Star Picking Pavilion is willing to purchase this with five hundred Divine Elixir Pills,” said Qian Qin.

“Five hundred Divine Elixir Pills?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He knew the Royal Blood Gem was a rare find and it should be worth more than just five hundred Divine Elixir Pills. As he had not come across anyone who urgently needed Royal Blood Gems, so he could only sell it to the Star Picking Pavilion since 500 Divine Elixir Pills were of great use to him under such circumstances.

“If Master Su Han thinks the price is too low, Star Picking Pavilion can top-up the offer with one billion Primordial Stones.” Qian Qin continued. “Perhaps you might not be aware of this but each sub-pavilion has a limited amount of Divine Elixir Pills. We have to get help from headquarters to send us these five hundred Divine Elixir Pills. However, the operation of the Star Picking Pavilion’s operations might be affected if we give out too many Divine Elixir Pills at once.”

“I understand. I’ll take five hundred Divine Elixir Pills and one billion Primordial Stones.” Jian Wushuang was decisive.

“That’s great. Master Su Han, can you wait for a few days?” Qian Qin asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile.

Qian Qin quickly turned and left. There was a wicked smile on her face when she turned around as she was laughing surreptitiously in her heart. ‘Su Han probably has no idea how rare this Royal Blood Gem is, and the price of five hundred Divine Elixir Pills and one billion Primordial Stones is ridiculously low.’

In her opinion, the price offered by the Star Picking Pavilion was absolutely the lowest in the market. People who are aware of the Royal Blood Gem’s value would never sell it, but Su Han agreed to their price. Was he not stupid?

She did not know that Jian Wushuang was willing to sell due to his urgency in needing Divine Elixir Pills to improve his strength, but more importantly, he had more of those Royal Blood Gems with him!

He had obtained three Royal Blood Gems from the mineral vein and the ten catties were the smallest in size!

He could not be bothered and gave up on the petty ten catties since he had two other bigger pieces at hand.

Jian Wushuang waited quietly for five days in the sub-pavilion until Qian Qin went looking for him again.

“Master Su Han, here are a total of five hundred and twenty Divine Elixir Pills and one billion one hundred million Primordial Stones in this Interspatial Ring. You can check on it.” Qian Qin handed an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

He did a quick check with his mind power and nodded after Jian Wushuang took it. In return, he handed over the ten catties of Royal Blood Gem and Life Liquid to Qian Qin.

“Master Su Han, it’s been a pleasure to trade with you.” Qian Qin smiled.

“Goodbye.” Jian Wushuang bid farewell and left.

After coming out of the Star Picking Pavilion, Jian Wushuang immediately found a secluded secret chamber and sat cross-legged in it.

The strong-scented Divine Elixir Pills were suspended in front of Jian Wushuang. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Five hundred and twenty Divine Elixir Pills.” Jian Wushuang was excited.

He had only used around 20 Divine Elixir Pills when he made a breakthrough from Peak Ultimate God Realm to Primary-level Earth Ultimate God realm. He then took the 50 Divine Elixir Pills given by Scorpion King during his time at the Blood Gem mineral vein. In addition to his divine power accumulation from many years of self-cultivation, Jian Wushuang estimated that he would need slightly more than a hundred Divine Elixir Pills to make a breakthrough to the High-level Earth Ultimate God realm.

“Well, let’s get started.”

Jian Wushuang wasted no time as he immediately began to swallow and refine those Divine Elixir Pills at an incredibly fast speed.

Any normal Ultimate God might take a long time to absorb and refine more than 100 Divine Elixir Pills.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang only had to spend a month refining those 120 Divine Elixir Pills.

Thereafter, he managed to make a breakthrough from Primary-level Earth Ultimate God to the High-level Earth Ultimate God realm.

The breakthrough in the cultivation realm had greatly increased Jian Wushuang’s divine power and skyrocketed his overall strength.

Jian Wushuang did not stop after the breakthrough but continued to swallow and absorb more Divine Elixir Pills until he completely used up the remaining four hundred Divine Elixir Pills.

Those four hundred Divine Elixir Pills had allowed him to accumulate more divine power and brought him a lot closer to the Peak Earth Ultimate God realm.

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes in the secret chamber and felt his surge of power.

“My divine power has skyrocketed again and I’ll need even more Divine Elixir Pills to improve my cultivation realm. At my current level, I should now be able to wipe out any Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods such that even battling against a High-level Heaven Ultimate God is a walk in the park for me. My winning probability is greatly enhanced if I include my many secret techniques. In terms of improving my law understanding, I can do so with the help from Fengtian Scroll to progress at a steady speed. Now, what should I do with my Sword Principles...”

Jian Wushuang had reached the peak of Merit level in Sword World and was only one step away from the Profound level of Sword World.

However, that one step was not easy to crossover.
