Chapter 3540: The Name Blood Sword

“What was the Blood Sword Master’s intentions?” The Chubby Master took out another fruit and ate it while watching Jian Wushuang leave.

“I don’t know. Although he came to us, it seems that he doesn’t really want to be our enemy. After fighting with us, he just left. If I’m not mistaken, he just wants to fight with us,” Master Yun said.

“Purely to have a battle with us? Could it be another battle maniac?” Chubby Master sighed.

The three Universe Battlefields had gathered dozens of experts from the astral worlds around them. There were simply too many of them.

And with so many experts, their temperaments were naturally different. Among them, there were some who liked to kill, like God Fei Master. They almost killed anyone they saw, but at the same time, there were also some who liked to challenge others, they would take the initiative to fight with others to improve their strength.

These crazy killers only pursued fierce battles, but they did not pursue killing. They were completely different from God Fei Master.

In the eyes of Master Yun and the Chubby Master, Jian Wushuang was the second kind of crazy killer.

“It’s better to meet a crazy killer than a crazy killer. Blood Sword Master is very strong. If he really kills us, we might not be his match,” the Chubby Master said.

“Maybe.” Master Yun nodded slightly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The two chatted for a while and then continued to move forward.

From this day on, Jian Wushuang had indeed become a battle maniac.

He roamed the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley, looking for experts everywhere, and then took the initiative to fight with them.

The opponents he found were usually experts of the fifth void realm with some strength. Of course, he would not miss the chance to meet experts above the peak of the fifth void realm. But no matter who he fought with, he was almost evenly matched, he did not have any advantage in a fight.

He did not have any advantage in a fight with an ordinary expert of the fifth void realm, but he did not have any disadvantage either.

However, he was the same when he fought an expert at the peak of the fifth void realm.

The reason for this was that Jian Wushuang had deliberately reserved his strength from the beginning to the end. When he fought with these experts, he would try his best to control the power of his divine power and then try his best to hone his swordsmanship, he would rely on himself to gain an advantage.

For example, when he fought with an ordinary expert of the fifth void realm,’’ Jian Wushuang basically did not even activate his life divine power. He would rely on his own will and the power of his basic divine power, which was equivalent to the power of the peak of the fourth void realm, then he would rely on his swordsmanship to fight fiercely with his opponent.

No matter who he fought with, he would always control his power to be weaker than his opponent, and then try to maximize his advantage in swordsmanship.

In this way, he could better hone his swordsmanship.

Of course, his unbridled challenge naturally attracted the attention of all the Great Beings in the surrounding astral world.

The name of Blood Sword Master gradually began to spread in the Universe Battlefield.

Not long after, everyone who was adventuring in the Universe Battlefield knew of the existence of Blood Sword Master, and this Blood Sword Master was a madman who loved to fight, recently, he had been crazily challenging experts from all over the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley. As for the strength of Blood Sword Master...

Experts from all over the universe were unable to accurately gauge Jian Wushuang’s strength.

This was because all the experts who fought with him were basically evenly matched. They only knew that his swordsmanship was extremely good.

However, Blood Sword Master had defeated Eight Axe Master in the fight for the Poluo God parts. Therefore, the star worlds’ definition of Jian Wushuang’s strength was that he was a Principles Master at the peak of the five void realms, at the same time, he was very close to the level of the six void realms.

As for his challenges in the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley, anyone could see that he must have used these battles to hone his strength.

Star Palace, in the Secret Pavilion.

“Recently, the Blood Sword Master who has been wandering in the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley seems to be quite famous,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“It’s like this. Moreover, I heard that this Blood Sword Master is from our Star Palace, but when did our Star Palace have a Blood Sword Master?” Seven Emotions Master looked puzzled.

When Axe One Master heard this, he smiled. “Blood Sword Master is indeed an expert from our Star Palace. He is the Heavenly Sword Marquis that Marquis Duan Yu brought back from the Divine Beginning Realm. It’s just that when he roamed Devil Smoke Valley, he deliberately used the alias Blood Sword.”

“It’s him?” Seven Emotions Master had a strange expression. “If I remember correctly, this heavenly Marquis Sword should still be an Immortal Saint. He hasn’t broken through to the Principles Master, right?”

“He hasn’t broken through.” Axe One Master nodded. “I’ve told you before that the Heavenly Sword Marquis isn’t weak. Even if he ventured into Devil Smoke Valley alone, you don’t have to worry. You didn’t believe it, but now, you believe it, right?”

“A mere Immortal Saint actually defeated Eight Axe Master and seized Poluo God’s component. Moreover, he made such a name for himself in Devil Smoke Valley. This is a little too terrifying.”Seven Emotions Master couldn’t help but exclaim, “Oh right, why did he crazily challenge all the experts in Devil Smoke Valley during this period of time?”

“I’ve asked him about this before. He said that he was honing his sword techniques.” Axe One Master smiled, “Oh right, only a few of us know that Blood Sword Master is the Immortal Saint. Please don’t leak this out.”

“Of course. We’re not stupid enough to leak this out. However, if he encounters an extremely powerful ruler-level expert while adventuring in Devil Smoke Valley, you’ll be able to see through his level of strength. When that time comes, he’ll definitely leak it out, and it’ll definitely cause a sensation.” Seven Emotions Master said.

“We’ll talk about it later, but for now, just keep it a secret,” Axe One Master said.

The surrounding people also nodded.

As time passed, Jian Wushuang continued to wander around the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley, challenging experts from all over the place and honing his swordsmanship at the same time.

In a flash, 50 years had passed.

Outside Devil Smoke Valley, there was a vast black land.

Weng! A faint aura of a true treasure surrounded it. In the center of this land, a long spear surrounded by a faint purple godly thunder slowly rose from the ground.

This long spear, however, judging from its aura, was clearly a universe true treasure. Even though it was only a low-level universe true treasure, after it was born, there were still many Great Beings attracted to it.

Right now, there were no less than ten Great Beings standing around the long spear. Among them, there were two Great Beings at the fifth level of the void realm.

They were all waiting for the long spear to be born completely, and then they would start fighting for it.
