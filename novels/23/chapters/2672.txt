Chapter 2673: All Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang had fought against three Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples in a row since the beginning of the gamble-fight and even won against his strongest opponent—Wu Xin.

‘He wants to fight again?’

“Jian Yi, I admit you’re a talented genius but don’t take it too far.” Wu Xin coldly eyed Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, let’s hear how we’ll go about this gamble-fight first,” suggested Jian Wushuang with a faint smile. “Though I’ve defeated you in the earlier fight, we were fighting based on the perception of laws and principles only while you didn’t even get the chance to display your true strength. Let’s change the rules this time where both of us can make our best effort without any scruples in this battle. You can fully display your divine power and various techniques. How about that?”

“Are you asking me to do my best?” Wu Xin’s eyes narrowed.

He had confidence in his status and abilities as Heaven Ultimate God after all. Although Jian Wushuang earlier defeated him, he had been maintaining his divine power at the Peak Earth Ultimate God level while not using his many methods and techniques—purely competing based on the perception of laws.

If he was able to go all out without restrictions...

“How many Divine Elixir Pills would you like to bet on in this battle?” Wu Xin asked.

“We bet on five hundred Divine Elixir Pills just now, so we have to do at least one thousand Divine Elixir Pills this time,” said Jian Wushuang in a deep voice before stretching out a finger.

1,000 Divine Elixir Pills... He actually wanted to bet more, but he was worried betting too many Divine Elixir Pills would scare Wu Xin off and made him reluctant to fight.

Wu Xin’s face sank slightly when he heard the 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills bet and said, “I can’t fork out a thousand Divine Elixir Pills.”

He was telling the truth as he had lost 500 Divine Elixir Pills which was all he had.

It was impossible for him to further take out 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills.

However...

“Wu Xin, go ahead and agree with him,” said a gentle voice.

The black-robed old man approached alongside Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“Elder Teng.”

Wu Xin, Ancient Witch, and Leng Xing immediately made obeisance respectfully.

“Palace Keeper Si Zhen.” The many expert disciples of the Sacred Palace also made obeisance to the Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“A thousand Divine Elixir Pills is nothing for the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. You just have to do your best,” said the black-robed old man.

“Yes,” Wu Xin nodded and immediately looked at Jian Wushuang. “We’re fine with a thousand Divine Elixir Pills. Let’s fight.”

“Sure, I’m ready.” Jian Wushuang beckoned to Wu Xin.

Anger was brewing in Wu Xin’s eyes as his unbridled Heavenly Ultimate God divine power finally erupted. His Evolving Sky Godly Staff which had gone dim after colliding several times with Jian Wushuang’s Transmigration Sword Formation lit up once again with much stronger power and brightness than before.

Wu Xin’s divine body also began to change at the same time.

He was originally the size of a normal human, but had very quickly grown and soared to nearly five yards tall while his skin and hair had completely turned purple such that even his pupils were dazzling in a strange purply luster.

An inexhaustible purply divine power surrounded him and he looked like a tall purple demon deity.

“This is one of Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s six secret techniques—Purple Blood Demon Deity. Based on Wu Xin’s divine power breath, he has practiced it up to the secret technique’s third volume. Amazing!” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was admiring the Purple Blood Demon Deity that Wu Xin formed.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen had seen some of Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s top-secret techniques.

An ordinary Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God was usually able to practice up to the second volume of the Purple Blood Demon Deity secret technique, but Wu Xin had made it to the third volume which only spoke volumes of his extraordinary talent.

“He was originally a Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God with a solid foundation and extremely powerful divine power. His combat prowess is comparable to a High-level Heaven Ultimate God Now that he has turned into a Purple Blood Demon Deity which skyrocketed his overall strength on top of coupling with his perception of Space-time Law and Evolving Sky Godly Staff!” Palace Keeper Si Zhen said in a low voice.

Wu Xin was indeed emanating a powerful divine power at that instance which obviously exceeded the powers of a Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God.

Moreover, Wuxin had also fought against a High-level Heaven Ultimate God before. Although he was defeated in that battle, the fight that had carried on for a long time only further proved his fighting capabilities against High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods!

He was not shocked or frightened by the 1,000 Divine Elixir Pills that Jian Wushuang betted upon having such powerful strength as his backing.

“Jian Yi, you’re so full of yourself!”

Wuxin’s purple eyes were extremely cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang and spoke with a loud voice.

“Maybe.” Jian Wushuang merely smiled faintly with a calm expression.

“Humph!”

Wu Xin did not waste more time talking as he snorted and fiercely charged forward.

Buzz!

There were almost a thousand apparitions in action once again. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The five-yard-tall Purple Blood Demon Deity apparition flooded all corners of the battlefield while the Evolving Sky Godly Staff turned into a stream of purply golden fleeting light in the battlefield’s center with a long tail dragging its back whilst it fiercely launched at Jian Wushuang.

Wu Xin had previously only used the power of a Peak Earth Ultimate God to perform the same method.

The purple golden fleeting light’s penetrating power was several folds stronger than before after he used much stronger divine power to perform the same technique.

“Too strong, this power is way too strong!”

“I think such terrifying power is on par with a High-level Heaven Ultimate God’s power. How could Jian Yi parry off the attack?”

“He’ll lose for sure. Definitely.”

“I don’t even know why Jian Yi is so courageous. How dare Jian Yi challenge Wu Xin who is giving his all in the fight? He even bet a thousand Divine Elixir Pills.”

Many experts from the Sacred Palace who gathered around secretly marveled at Wu Xin’s skill.

All of them felt an irresistible power from the purply gold fleeting light Wu Xin displayed.

Its power was extremely strong.

However, Jian Wushuang merely smiled faintly when he looked at the densely packed Purple Blood Demon Deity apparitions before him and the purply gold fleeting light that came swooping down at him.

With a wave of his hand...

“Space-time Strangulation!”

Buzz! The world was shaken up.

A huge strangling force instantly exploded and engulfed the entire battlefield.

The vigorous strangling force violently strangled everything within its reach and instantly strangulated the almost a thousand Purple Blood Demon Deity apparitions on the battlefield before all of them went poof and disappeared. The battlefield was finally left with Wu Xin who stood there in awe.

Jian Wushuang then made another move.

He did not use the Transmigration Sword Formation, but just very casually wielded his own Blood Mountain Sword without adding in any complicated sword techniques.

Nonetheless, the sword movement contained a part of divine power coming from Jian Wushuang and also two Space-time Blades!
