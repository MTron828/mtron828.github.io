Chapter 3038: One Finger Oblivion!

——

“Elder Gu, I want a place where I can cultivate and comprehend in peace,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sure, this secret realm is very big, and there is no other cultivator besides you. I can arrange a place for you to ensure that no one will disturb you,” Elder Gu said, “but I have to remind you that any cultivator only has three chances to enter Di Mountain. You’ve already used it once before, and there are only two chances left. You must seize these two chances. You must be at least 70 to 80 percent sure that you can go again.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Soon, Elder Gu arranged a separate dark void for Jian Wushuang.

The dark void was boundless. Jian Wushuang sat alone with his legs crossed. In front of him was a golden stone the size of a baby’s fist.

“Let’s begin.”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang sank his consciousness into the golden stone.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. The scene immediately began to change.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Waves of terrifying space-time storms filled every corner of the world. The killing power contained in these space-time storms was ridiculously strong. Jian Wushuang even suspected that even a principles master would be torn into pieces by this space-time storm, let alone a True Saint, he reckoned that he would be torn into pieces by this space-time storm.

In many places in the space-time storm, space-time seemed to have completely frozen and stopped. Pieces of space continued to break and regenerate.

In the center of this space-time storm, there was an extremely tall golden palace door. This palace door was magnificent and majestic, but the inside of the palace door was mysterious. What he could sense was still the vast and boundless power of space-time, it was as if it led to another space-time.

Jian Wushuang was standing under the Golden Palace Gate.

“Here I am again.”

Seeing the space-time palace gate in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s heart was still filled with many waves.

The words that he had heard before were still echoing in his ears.

“Cross the space-time gate, enter my space-time palace, and be a member of my divine palace!”

Jian Wushuang had stepped through the time-space palace gate before he was able to comprehend the first move of the time-space divine skill, the heaven-designated skill.

But now..,

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang stepped into the palace gate again without any hesitation.

As soon as he entered the palace gate, he came to a vast and boundless void.

In the void, a tall figure stood there.

The tall figure was three meters tall and wore a simple but clean white robe. His figure was obscure and his face could not be seen. He stood in the middle of the void with his hands behind his back.

“It’s him again.”

Jian Wushuang, you are not unfamiliar with this tall figure.

When he was comprehending the heaven-designated skill, he saw the tall figure personally use the heaven-designated skill to imprison many experts, causing them to be stuck in time and space for a long time and unable to recover.

If Jian Wushuang was right, the tall figure was probably the creator of the time and space divine skill, the temporal temple master.

Now, Jian Wushuang saw the tall figure again, standing in front of a star.

It was a huge star that was much larger than the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

Such a star was simply a colossus. Jian Wushuang also sensed the aura of countless cultivators in the star. They were all very powerful, including many Immortal Saints, Jian Wushuang even faintly sensed the aura of the principles master.

“What is he going to do?”

As a bystander, Jian Wushuang stared at the tall figure quietly.

Finally, the tall figure moved.

He still did not move much. He just slowly extended his right hand and pointed in the direction of the giant star.

Yes, it was the simplest finger.

It was exactly the same as when he used the heaven-designated skill.

However, under this finger, an obscure power of space-time rules suddenly swept out.

In front of them, on the giant star… A terrifying space-time storm appeared out of thin air.

The space-time storm completely covered the entire star, and a large number of space-time blades crazily rampaged and strangled everything.

Then, the giant star, including the countless cultivators on the star, began to be annihilated at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It was annihilated!

Completely annihilated.

Whether it was the giant star, the cultivators in the star, or the few hidden principles masters that Jian Wushuang sensed, there was no room for struggle. In the blink of an eye, they were all annihilated.

The giant star completely disappeared, and the world returned to peace as if nothing had happened.

Jian Wushuang was completely stunned.

After a while, a vast amount of information flooded into his mind.

The second move of the space-time divine art…one finger void annihilation!

“One finger void annihilation!!”

“Space-time annihilation!!”

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the void, but his body was faintly trembling.

It was too terrifying!

The scene just now was too terrifying.

It should be known that the giant star was much larger than a Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

Such a huge star, the tall figure only needed one finger to completely annihilate it.

Such a terrifying method was simply unbelievable!

“Space-time annihilation, yes, the tall figure just used the space-time annihilation which can be used in the third stage of the space-time principles.” Jian Wushuang was still recalling the scene just now.

The space-time storm appeared and annihilated everything in the world, and the method was obviously space-time annihilation.

According to Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the space-time principles, each level of the space-time principles had a new ability.

The first level of the space-time principles could condense a space-time illusion body.

The second level could control the space-time blade.

The third level allowed one to perform the space-time annihilation.

The fourth level allowed one to perform teleportation.

Jian Wushuang had not yet reached the third level of the space-time annihilation, but he had clearly used the space-time annihilation with his finger earlier.

He had used the space-time annihilation in a special way to its fullest and most perfect effect. This move was terrifying in terms of its destructive power alone. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s just right that my space-time principles has advanced one step further, which is to control the space-time annihilation move, and the one-finger void annihilation move is to perfectly utilize the space-time annihilation move. I can completely comprehend this move while controlling the space-time annihilation, and I can easily step into the third level of the space-time principles.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.
