Chapter 5523 ¬†Kneel Down

The aura on his body undiminished, he descended directly into the courtyard.

Tian Cang, indistinguishable from a dead dog in his hand, was casually thrown aside.

Seeing Vice Hall Master Zhong without any surprise, everything unfolded as planned.

"Where's Gong Miaoyi?" Jian Wushuang showed no courtesy. He sat down bluntly where Gong Miaoyi had been sitting, cutting straight to the point.

Vice Hall Master Tie San remained unchanged in expression. Personally pouring a cup of tea for Jian Wushuang, he said calmly, "Jian Wushuang, just a maidservant, is it necessary to make such a fuss?"

"Haha!" Jian Wushuang laughed in anger, rubbing the armrest of the chair. Then, with a sudden force, he directly shattered the armrest, with wood chips flying out. Tie San easily defused the situation.

Defusing this was easy, but in front of so many people, how could Jian Wushuang be so disrespectful? If he endured, how would his subordinates view him?

In the Fengteng Courtyard, many people were present.

Originally intended to intimidate Jian Wushuang, it now backfired. Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The other Vice Hall Master of Longevity Hall stepped forward, angrily shouting, "Jian Wushuang, you've gone too far!"

"Hmph!" Jian Wushuang snorted disdainfully, saying, "Who are you? Do you have the right to speak here?"

"You!" The Vice Hall Master, unaccustomed to such treatment, was about to rush forward but was held back by Tie San.

Tie San took a deep breath, suppressing his anger. Holding the tea-infusing frame in his hand, he calmly said, "Regarding Gong Miaoyi's matter, I did overlook it. Even if you didn't come, I would personally visit with a generous gift. I didn't expect it to escalate to this point!"

He continued, "Speak of your demands. If there's anything lacking or any requests, I, Tie San, will definitely fulfill them!"

Jian Wushuang lifted the teacup, gave it a shake, and then, with intense anger in his eyes, directly splashed the tea towards Tie San, angrily shouting.

"You've grown muddled in your old age, asking me to make demands?!" He chuckled with exasperation. "I want the Origin Source of All Things in the Beiwang Tower. Can you afford that? Don't think just because you're a Hall Master, you can spout nonsense freely. Otherwise, I'll wipe the floor with you in one go!"

A violent aura emanated from Tie San, evaporating the tea on his face. He was about to erupt, but upon hearing about the Origin Source of All Things, he had to forcefully suppress the anger in his heart.

He had already informed his elder brother, Chang Feng Sword God, about the situation here. Even his elder brother advised against provoking Jian Wushuang, stating that the latter just wanted to extort some treasures‚Äîpay him off, and that would be the end of it.

But now, Jian Wushuang was not giving any face. It wasn't about money; it was about humiliating him!

Vice Hall Master Zhong stared blankly, having shifted his position to the back.

If it were him, he would probably have taken action long ago. He admired Tie San's patience; he could endure such provocations.

Wasn't Tie San quite domineering before?

Why did he seem so restrained now?

"Jian Wushuang!" Tie San's expression finally darkened. He glared at Jian Wushuang as if wanting to eat him, gritting his teeth and saying, "If it weren't for my big brother's instructions, you would have died a hundred times already!"

The last sentence was just a threat.

In the Elder Palace, who would dare to kill Jian Wushuang?

If someone dared to kill him, forget Zhen Ling, they would have to fight for their lives against the consequences.

"Let me also tell you this, if I haven't achieved Dao Merge yet, you wouldn't even have the privilege of sitting down and talking to me. Without your big brother, you wouldn't even be able to secure your position as a Hall Master!"

Both of them stood up simultaneously, their bodies close, faces almost touching.

Staring into each other's eyes.

"Today, let Gong Miaoyi leave with me. Either you kneel down and kowtow to me three times, or I'll consider this marriage settled!"

Jian Wushuang stood up straight, rubbed his forehead, and then said, "Alternatively, you can give me the Origin Source of All Things. Don't say I didn't give you face. After I finish my demands, you figure out how to handle it!"

These three demands were enough to ruin the reputation of the other party.

Letting Gong Miaoyi go with him was absolutely impossible.

He had already sent out the invitations, and having a Dao Companion run away with someone else meant losing face completely.

As for the Origin Source of All Things, even with ten lives, he wouldn't dare to decide.

In the end, the only option left was to kowtow!

But that was no better than just killing him directly.

Vice Hall Master Zhong on the side couldn't bear to watch any longer. This was such a great humiliation.

For the sake of a woman, it wasn't worth it!

"All of you, step back!" Tie San's face was trembling, waving his hand to signal those people to disperse.

The Vice Hall Master of Longevity Hall showed some emotion.

Letting them leave, was he really ready to compromise?

If that was the case, then the Longevity Hall would be disgraced for a lifetime.

Being stepped on the face by a Dao Lord.

"Hall Master, we..."

But before they could finish speaking, Tie San's face turned as pale as wax. He raised his head, glanced at the crowd, and roared, "Get lost!"

Swish!

People didn't dare to linger any longer, and their hearts turned cold.

The usually imposing Hall Master of Longevity Hall had now fallen to such a state, about to kneel to a Dao Lord.

After everyone left, only Tie San, Jian Wushuang, and Vice Hall Master Zhong remained.

"Earlier, there were many people around, but now there is no one else. I, Tie San, personally offer you a gift. The treasure within this mustard seed is worth 30,000 cubic universe crystals, my lifelong accumulation. Please accept it!" Tie San presented a mustard seed with both hands in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang's gaze flickered; 30,000 cubic universe crystals were not particularly attractive to him at the moment.

With his own possession of several hundred thousand cubic universe crystals, he didn't lack these 30,000.

On the contrary, the other party having 30,000 cubic universe crystals probably gained some benefits privately, accumulating over millions of years.

There would be more in the future.

30,000 cubic universe crystals weren't a significant loss; he could obtain more in the future. However, Gong Miaoyi could not be returned to Jian Wushuang.

Others might not know, but Tie San was clear in his heart that Gong Miaoyi's constitution was very special and particularly suitable for dual cultivation.

As long as he found Gong Miaoyi's father, Gong Miaoyi promised him dual cultivation.

Now that he had obtained information about Gong Miaoyi's father, after the grand wedding, he would surely bring Gong Miaoyi to find her father.

Once they started dual cultivation, his strength could be further enhanced.

There was hope for the supreme-peak, and the hope was significant.

By then, the two brothers would both be supreme-peak experts, and within the Elder Palace, they would not fear anyone.

So, Gong Miaoyi would never be let go.

The reason he could endure was precisely this.

In case Jian Wushuang insisted on taking Gong Miaoyi away, when he brought this matter to Palace Master Lu Hua, the other party wouldn't help him. Moreover, he didn't stand on the right side!

If it weren't for his older brother's advice, he would have almost lost his temper.

Enduring for a while was fine. After he stepped into the supreme-peak, there would be no need to fear Jian Wushuang.

Even if Jian Wushuang succeeded in merging Dao in the future, he would also be a supreme-peak expert, and there would be no need to consider Jian Wushuang's opinions.

After all, the Elder Palace was the private force of Zhen Ling.

It's not that there weren't other Ultimate Emperors, but those Ultimate Emperors were not related to them, at most giving some face.

No matter how grandly they spoke, it was just potential.

Ultimate Emperors didn't have much power; they were busy cultivating, with no time to bother about such matters.
