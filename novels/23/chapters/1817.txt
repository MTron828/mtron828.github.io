Chapter 1818: Travel Back Quickly!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On the vast, ancient battlefield, in a strange vortex of sinisterness.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. He had already sat there for three hundred years.

In front of him, there was an image. In the image, there was a white-haired lady moving her finger and a sword shadow containing boundless rage substantiated in the air.

She formed a sword with her willpower and swung it.

Without any movement or noises.

In the void tens of thousands of miles before her, the head of an ancient expert that had struck fear into Jian Wushuang stood was cut off.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang let out a deep sigh and he slowly opened his eyes.

“I have been here to comprehend for three hundred years and my swordsmanship has improved tremendously. It’s time to leave,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He wandered in the ancient battlefield for six thousand years.

In the past six thousand years, he had constantly visited places that Green Fire Palace but was yet to have the ability to explore.

During his search, he had received many opportunities.

Any of the opportunities that he had received would be enviable by many. Jian Wushuang had had at least over a dozen times of opportunities in the past six thousand years.

That was the benefit of taking the entire ancient battlefield for himself.

The opportunities had enabled Jian Wushuang to advance by leaps and bounds. Among them, the biggest help to Jian Wushuang was a cave dwelling. He had comprehended in the cave dwelling for one thousand and two hundred years.

In the one thousand and two hundred years, he had gone into comprehension of the doctrine wholeheartedly. When he left, his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine had been elevated to an unprecedented level.

“The special places that Green Fire Palace has found out over the years, I have searched through more than half of them. My next target will be… here,” Jian Wushuang took out Star Map and locked his gaze on a special place that was marked on Star Map. He was then prepared to set out to the next destination.

Just then, there was a message that suddenly came in.

“Mm? Palace Master sent a message?” Jian Wushuang was shocked and he immediately skimmed through the message.

In a short while, Jian Wushuang grew distressed.

“Palace Master is going to die?”

“How is it possible?”

Jian Wushuang immediately replied the message in shock. However, there was no response from the other side of the token.

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Master of Star Palace, the strongest reliance of Lineage of Star, a mainstay existence.

He had founded Lineage of Star and led Lineage of Star to keep their footing in Sanctuary Alliance and the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

Although Lineage of Star had offended many major forces and solo experts during the process, the major forces and experts were fearful but didn’t dare to act hastily. Jian Wushuang adored such an existence greatly.

But then, Master of Star Palace had passed away.

“It is… going to be chaos!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Then, there was another message. The person who had sent the message was Hall Master Yuan.

He sent Jian Wushuang a short message.

“Travel back quickly!!!”

Jian Wushuang stared when he received the message. He immediately gave up the idea of exploring the ancient battlefield and returned to Green Fire World.

After he had returned to Green Fire World, Jian Wushuang immediately found Jian Nantian.

“Father, Eternal Chaotic World is going through a drastic change. I have to rush back immediately. Hence, Green Fire World and Wushuang City shall be passed to you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“A drastic change?” Jian Nantian’s face grew dim.

He had never been to Eternal Chaotic World and he didn’t know about anything in Eternal Chaotic World. However, he understood that something major must have happened which had made Jian Wushuang so anxious.

“I will leave some Dao soldiers here. The Dao soldiers will help you to better control Green Fire World,” Jian Wushuang said.

Six thousand years had passed. The spiritual energy in Green Fire World had become even more intense. During these years, Green Fire World had had a major increase in experts too.

Of Universe God alone, Green Fire World had a total of a few hundred. The strongest of them all was still Jian Nantian.

One should know that Jian Nantian was truly a sword genius, but due to the damage of his foundation when he was younger and also the imperfect cultivation environment, his achievement was limited. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, it was different then. Jian Wushuang already used some Natural Treasure to recover Jian Nantian’s damage on his foundation entirely. Plus, Green Fire World’s cultivation environment was much better than the ten sanctuaries. Under such conditions, Jian Nantian’s power had improved tremendously in the past six thousand years. He already passed his third God’s Test and reached the top limit of a Universe God in the Third Heaven. As soon as the time came, he could break through and become a Real God.

With Jian Nantian’s power and the addition of Dao soldiers, they could ensure Green Fire World’s peace.

After delegating the task, Jian Wushuang woke up Jian Yi, who had been recovering his power in seclusion. Then, he brought along the rest of the Dao soldiers as he left.

The ancient spaceship drove through the huge formation and shook off the Spacetime Storm very quickly.

In the spaceship cabin, Jian Wushuang, Jian Yi and Qiu Yue sat.

As for He Xiu, as he passed the test that Jian Wushuang had left in Wushuang City, he had become Jian Wushuang’s lineal disciple. After that, he had left Green Fire World to wander outside.

He Xiu then was already in the third place of the Universe God ranking list in Eternal Chaotic World and he was even challenging the first and second place on the list.

Jian Wushuang was happy with his disciple.

“Jian Yi, how did your recovery of power go?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Master, I have already resumed the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm,” Jian Yi replied respectfully.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew bright.

Middle Stage Chaotic Realm was the level of an Emperor God in Eternal Chaotic World!

One should know that when Jian Yi was at Beginner Stage Chaotic Realm, with his comprehension of Doctrine and possession of various skills, his fighting power had already been astonishing.

Now, Jian Yi was much more powerful than when he had fought with Jian Wushuang back then.

“Jian Yi is an ancient expert and he carries many skills. Now that he has recovered his power to Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, his power has definitely increased tremendously. I wonder which level he reached,” Jian Wushuang muttered. Jian Wushuang found it difficult to gauge Jian Yi’s power.

After all, ancient times and the second era that he was in were completely different.

Even the names of the realms were different.

“Regardless, Jian Yi is a helping hand to me, he might even be my lethal tactic,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

As Palace Master had died, there would definitely be a lot of issues.

As he was the new master that Master of Star Palace had determined, he had to deal with all the issues in Lineage of Star.

The ancient spaceship that Jian Wushuang drove was traveling at its top speed to Lineage of Star.
