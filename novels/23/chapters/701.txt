Chapter 702: Soul Aura

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Silver-armored Demon God’s face fell as he asked severely, “Boy, didn’t your seniors tell you not to come to this area?”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang felt relieved.

Obviously, this Silver-armored Demon God regarded him as his clansman.

“Captain, this boy has lost touch with his family.” Gu Qiong explained.

“Really?” The Silver-armored Demon God raised his eyebrows.

Gu Qiong looked over at Jian Wushuang and introduced his captain. “Jian Wushuang, this is my captain, Gu Yan.”

“Captain Gu Yan.”

Jian Wushuang addressed him with modesty while thinking,?“Gu Yan, Gu Qiong, and the dead Gu Feng and Gu Ying… all of them with the surname Gu. Are all the clansmen from the Demon God Clan named Gu? No wonder they said that my name is a bit odd.”

“Captain, I’ve just bumped into this boy and planned on sending him back to his tribe, but I didn’t expect to meet you here,” Gu Qiong said honestly.

“Send him back to his tribe?”

Gu Yan spared Jian Wushuang a glance and then nodded slightly. “He hasn’t been baptized and should not have been here. This territory is filled with outsiders, so it’s dangerous for you to travel here alone, let alone with this little guy.”

“What should I do? Will you escort us back personally?” Gu Qiong frowned.

“I’m the captain, so I can’t leave the battlefield.” Gu Yan shook his head. “Well, I know a good place to hide. Ordinarily, the outsiders won’t be able to find it. You can go there with this boy and hide for a few days.

“Those outsiders stay for 10 days every time they enter the zone. There are eight days left. You can wait until then.”

Gu Qiong immediately nodded. “Okay.”

“Follow me,” Gu Yan ordered and set off.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s follow the captain,” Gu Qiong added.

Jian Wushuang shrugged but obeyed.

Shortly after, Gu Yan led them into a patch of dense forest. There was a hole in the ground, which was covered by weeds.

“Gu Qiong, take this boy and stay in the cave for eight days. Remember, don’t radiate your aura.” Gu Yan cautioned him.

“OK,” replied Gu Qiong with a nod.

Gu Yan looked around to ensure that there were no dangers and then left before Jian Wushuang and Gu Qiong entered the cave.

There was a spacious open area inside the cave. It was dark without any decorations.

But Jian Wushuang and Gu Qiong were still able to see clearly in the dark.

“Come, boy, let’s have a drink.” Gu Qiong turned his hand over and took out a bag of wine.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate, and as he drank, a pungent feeling ran through his body.

“What a spicy wine!” Jian Wushuang growled and felt as if he were going to spout out fire.

He had never drunk such spicy wine before.

“Haha, good wine, right? My wife brews it for me. It’s a pity that she only gives me one bag every month. You have to save some for me,” Gu Qiong said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and drank again before he returned the wine bag to this Demon God.

After wiping his mouth, Jian Wushuang said, “Big Brother Gu Qiong, I need to ask you about something.”

“About what?” Gu Qiong replied indifferently.

“You said you’ve fought with outsiders. What’s the difference between us?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

Jian Wushuang was really eager to learn about it.

He wanted to figure out why Gu Qiong and Gu Yan regarded him as their clansman.

“That’s easy,” Gu Qiong answered with a grin. “Outsiders are seemingly the same as you are, thin and small and haven’t been baptized. Actually, these are just the superficial similarities; their souls are different from ours.”

“Souls?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Everyone has their own Soul Aura. The outsiders’ Soul Auras are totally different from ours. As long as they appear, I can recognize them,” Gu Qiong explained.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang nodded inwardly, but he was actually quite astonished.

Gu Qiong and the other clansmen from the Demon God Clan were able to distinguish outsiders from their clansmen according to their Soul Auras.

However, Gu Qiong and Gu Yan regarded Jian Wushuang as their clansman.

That is to say, they sensed that Jian Wushuang had the same aura as them.

“My Soul Aura is the same as the Demon Gods’? How is this possible?”?Jian Wushuang felt it was unbelievable. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He had been trying to figure out the reason ever since Gu Qiong became under the impression that he came from the Demon God Clan.

Jian Wushuang had suspected that it was because of the Immortality Secret Skill.

The Immortality Secret Skill he had received in the Ancient World came from an expert called God Hong.

God Hong, who came from the Eternal World, had to belong to a special clan because his broken finger was larger than Jian Wushuang.

The Demon Gods all had big and powerful bodies, so God Hong possibly came from the Demon God Clan. Then it was natural for them to regard Jian Wushuang as their clansmen because he had cultivated the Immortality Secret Skill that God Hong created.

Nevertheless, he discovered that he was wrong, as the Immortality Secret Skill had only improved his body, but it was unable to change his Soul Aura.

Souls were mysterious, so he was definitely unable to change it by himself. Jian Wushuang was sure that he had no bond with the Demon God Clan, but now his Soul Aura was the same as the Demon Gods’.

There was only one possibility.

”?The Univeral Dao Scripture!?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with excitement.

When Jian Wushuang received the Univeral Dao Scripture, his master Xuan Yi told him that it was a special secret skill and that he would know its function in the near future.

Therefore, it was likely that the Univeral Dao Scripture had changed his Soul Aura.
