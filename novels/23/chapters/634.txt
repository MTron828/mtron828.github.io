“The Round Three is an Arena Battle,” said the middle-aged man.

“All the geniuses taking part in Round Three will draw lots, one by one, to select their opponents. The winners can continue to battle and the losers will be eliminated. By the end of the Round, only the strongest will remain.”

“The top ten geniuses will gain generous rewards for making it to the end of Round Three in the Genius Battle.”

“Only the top ten geniuses will be rewarded with 100 thousand Divine Gems!”

“Second and third place will receive 500 thousand Divine Gems.”

“Whoever gets first place will be given one million Divine Gems and a Dao Origin Fruit.”

Hearing this, many geniuses became quite excited.

Divine Gems were the currency for trading in the Eternal World. They were capable of restoring spiritual power.

In the Eternal World, an ordinary person in the Divine Realm would only possess several thousand Divine Gems. 100,000 Divine Gems was a great amount of wealth for these geniuses since it was already more than the assets of most Divine Realm experts.

A million Divine Gems was very close to the entire fortune of an Eternal Realm expert.

As for the Dao Origin Fruit, it was one of the most valuable treasures for comprehending the Dao. So its value was even greater than 1,000,000 Divine Gems.

No wonder these geniuses were so anxious to receive such a generous reward.

However, Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face.

“Doesn’t the Genius Battle have four rounds? The geniuses will be ranked in Round Three, so what will we compete on in Round Four?”?

Jian Wushuang had some doubts, but he didn’t think about it anymore.

Everyone quickly stepped forward to draw lots for the next round. Jian Wushuang also took a token.

Jian Wushuang checked the token and found the number 28 on it.

So Jian Wushuang’s opponent was the person who had token number 27.

“Who will my first fight be against?”?Jian Wushuang thought, looking around and eventually locking on to a wicked man.

The wicked man was also staring at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s him.”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Jian Wushuang knew of the wicked man called Chu Yang. He had witnessed Chu Yang’s strength in Round Two.

Chu Yang had a very good comprehension of the Earth Dao, only a step away from the first level. He had also created a Stage One Superior Secret Skill. With regard to overall strength, he barely ranked in the middle of the remaining geniuses.

“I am lucky to be fighting with a genius from the Ancient World in the first battle.”

Chu Yang sneered and walked towards Jian Wushang, radiating a commanding atmosphere as he said, “Young man, I saw your performance in Round Two, but you are far weaker than me, so you’d better give up in the upcoming Arena Battle. Save both of our time.”

“I should give up?”Jian Wushuang said with an interesting smile, “If you are strong enough, I’ll give up.”

“Hum, I did give you a chance, but you don’t want it. Well, I’ll make you regret your choice.” Chu Yang snorted and then left. He really was looking down Jian Wushuang the whole time.

It was normal.

Jian Wushuang squeezed through Round Two with a poor performance. Among the 124 geniuses, his strength was at the bottom. It was no wonder he was being looked down upon by the others.

However, Jian Wushuang did not care.

It wasn’t long until Round Three, the Arena?Battle, finally kicked off.

The battleground was situated in a huge open space at the center of the Drill Ground and it was large enough for two geniuses to battle at will.

The first fight of the Arena Battle started.

The two first geniuses showed their strength completely. Because their strengths were somewhat equal to each other, the fight went on for quite a while before a victor was finally decided. The winner remained and continue to participate while the loser was eliminated.

As time went by, everyone fought fiercely while trying to display their full power.

Many of them had deliberately hidden their strength in the first two rounds, but none of them were holding back in Round Three. It was also true that they had all made progress in the last month because of their time at Enlightenment Mountain.

These geniuses had made a lot of progress in that month.

“Boom!”

Suddenly a fierce roar emerged from the middle of the battlefield. Many geniuses from outside the arena and those Sect experts in the Skyward Pavilion all cast their eyes on two specific figures in the arena.

The two men were having a fierce fighting. One of them was named Jin Yue, who many had high expectations of because he was strong enough to rank among the top 20 in this Firmament Territory Feast. Before the drawing, many geniuses had prayed that Jin Yue would not be their opponent.

But now, this genius was lying awkwardly on his stomach and coughing up blood while he struggled to stand up. But, in the end, he failed.

Jin Yue was defeated!

He had received a heavy blow.

The genius fighting with Jin Yue was a purple-robed youth with a Stone Staff in his hand, a cold look on his handsome face, and a particularly strong aura.

Just then, the purple-robed youth attacked three times in succession and defeated Jin Yue.

Jin Yue didn’t even get the chance to struggle because the gap between them was that big.

“This man... I remember him. His name is Gong Chao!”

All eyes were concentrated on the purple-robed youth.

Gong Chao was from the Eternal World.

In the first two rounds, his performance was only good enough to let him qualify, so very few people paid attention to him.

But, at the beginning of Round Three, he had instantly defeated Jin Yue, who was strong enough to rank in the top 20.

His strength was instantly recognized.

“Top three!”

“His battle strength is within the top three at the very least. He is definitely as powerful as Qianqiu Wuhen!”

“His comprehension of the Thunderbolt Dao is very good. With his strength, it is quite possible to strive for first place in this Firmament Territory Feast, just like Qianqiu Wuhen.”

“Another extreme genius has appeared.”

“Quickly! Send him an invitation right now...”

The three magnates and the top sect experts all sent invitations to Gong Chao.
