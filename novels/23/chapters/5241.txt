Hehe…

In the darkness, a terrifying sound echoed, followed by a black long line that stretched for thousands of miles sweeping in their direction.

Jian Wushuang focused his gaze and realized the magnitude of the situation. 100,000 Devouring Demons, neatly arranged, were charging toward them.

10,000 in each row, a total of ten queues.

Although the treasure points given in these first three waves were few, they were crucial for the position of the commander and other roles.

Ignoring all dignity, Si Tian rushed ahead, completely relying on speed.

Watching these frenzied individuals, Jian Wushuang remained unfazed.

He still stood on the city wall, with only an additional long sword behind him.

It was still that ordinary treasure sword, its gray-white blade resembling ash-colored stone.

Killing enemies?

It wasn’t about who could run the fastest.

Jian Wushuangs specialty was his domain—be it the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent, the Heartsword World, or the Beast God’s Domain, or even the One Thought Universe.

Each one was a powerful weapon against groups. Looking at these Devouring Demons, it reminded him of the ghosts he encountered in the Great Desolate Wilderness.

Clang!

Jian Wushuang unsheathed his divine sword. With a simple and unremarkable stroke, a magnificent sword light instantly transformed into a river millions of miles wide.

The river’s tumultuous flow was filled with incredibly sharp Sword Qi. The speed of this sword light was astonishing; in just a breath’s time, it surpassed the Grand Yan Immortals competing to catch up and headed straight for the Devouring Demons.

The several half-step Dao Lords at the forefront, along with Dao Lord Si Tian, were all stunned, then turned to look behind them.

Jian Wushuang’s lips curled up, and he gave them a faint smile.

“Everyone, I won’t be polite.”

Although there was a smile on Jian Wushuangs face, his eyes were extremely sharp.

His Sword Qi rolled like rivers, and in an instant, it clashed with the Devouring Demons. In the face of his sharp Sword Qi, these Devouring Demon Lords were like thin paper, crumbling at a touch.

100,000 Devouring Demon Lords, wiped out in the blink of an eye.

Ding!

The token on Jian Wushuangs body trembled.

“Just a thousand points?”

Jian Wushuang originally thought there would be around 10,000, but unexpectedly, there were only 1,000.

On the leaderboard of the token, apart from his ranking changing a bit, everything else remained the same.

First: Jian Wushuang

Devouring Record: 1,000

That meant 1,000 treasure points.

However, this time on the ranking list, Jian Wushuang could also view the rankings of other Original Planets.

He glanced casually and found that the strong individuals from other Original Planets were also enjoying solitary meals, just like him.

Soon, the battles on the other four walls also ended, and there were some changes in the rankings. Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing was indeed domineering enough; he also gained 1,000 treasure points. He had witnessed Wan Xings strength; he probably could kill 100,000 Devouring Demon Lords with just one punch.

Now, he was tied for first place with Wan Xing, followed by Hu Qing, Xue Yue, Leng Shuang, Ji Chaoyang, and others.

In fact, Hu Qing’s strength could also let him monopolize all the points, but it was his personality that prevented him from doing so. He didn’t act alone like Jian Wushuang and Wan Xing.

The battles on the other Original Planets ended very quickly, without any delay.

Jian Wushuang didn’t even need to leave the city; he killed 100,000 Devouring Demon Lords in one go. This level of strength wasn’t something to boast about; Xue Yue and Leng Shuang could achieve the same.

However, on Wan Xings side, he was the only supreme powerhouse. Even if others were dissatisfied, they dared not say much.

Here, Jian Wushuang had Dao Lord Si Tian, who could challenge him.

He ran the fastest, didn’t obtain a single treasure point in the end, and didn’t even touch those Devouring Demons.

Xue Yue and Leng Shuang had extensive domains, and the two of them managed to split evenly. He didn’t gain anything at all. For a moment, his face couldn’t hold up, and he returned to the city wall with a blackened face.

At this moment, there were quite a few half-step Dao Lords gathered around him, along with some extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals.

It seemed they were preparing to put pressure on Jian Wushuang.

“Si Tian, this Jian Wushuang is simply too selfish. He actually swallowed everything alone. That Monster Monk has the strength of a half- step Emperor, yet he still knows how to share with others. But this newly promoted Dao Lord is so arrogant.”

“Hmph, he’s simply too audacious!”

“He took all the treasure points that fell from the sky for himself, leaving the difficult ones for us. This person has the strength of a strong individual but lacks the demeanor of one.’

“Exactly! If it’s like this, it’s unfair to us too.”

A half- step Dao Lord furrowed his brows, the first to confront the situation head-on. His voice rasped, “Since he treats us unfairly, don’t blame us for setting obstacles for him.”

When these words came out, the extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals fell silent. Regardless of how much they complained, Jian Wushuang was a strong individual at the level of Dao Lords. They could vent, but they didn’t dare to hinder this ruthless person.

Half- step Dao Lords were manageable; they could survive under the hands of Dao Lords. Now, having gained many Innate Treasures and items that enhanced their strength, they were spirited and no longer placed Dao Lords in their eyes.

In fact, their words also carried another layer of meaning: they wanted Dao Lord Si Tian to step forward and talk to Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang stood on the city wall, his expression unchanged. As a powerful Grand Yan Immortal, he could hear their voices, no matter how soft they were. He simply couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to them.

As for setting obstacles, he was even more contemptuous.

If anyone had the courage, anyone unafraid of death could come.

Just moments ago, he had annihilated 100,000 Devouring Demon Lords, and the familiar aura sent shivers down his spine. It was already generous of him not to attack them; expecting to share the treasure points equally was simply naive.

What he didn’t expect was for Dao Lord Si Tian, of all people, to approach him with such naivety.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Jian Wushuang, we’re both powerful Dao Lords. Isn’t it beneath you to act like this? We all know how strong you are, but could you at least leave something for others?” Dao Lord Si Tian began his rebuke from the moral high ground, becoming the second person, apart from the powerful beings in the Great Dream Realm, to strike Jian Wushuang as utterly foolish.

“Si Tian, did you suddenly gain a sense of dignity after fleeing like a dog earlier?” Jian Wushuang stared back at him with icy eyes and continued, “Does Wan Xing and the other powerful beings from the other Original Planets lack dignity for each killing 100,000 Devouring Demon Lords?”

Faced with Jian Wushuangs questioning, Dao Lord Si Tian’s expression wavered, as if he wanted to respond.

Jian Wushuang was not Hu Qing; he wouldn’t spare these people any face. His aura suddenly surged, his pitch-black shining battle armor emanating a world-ending vibe. The onlookers felt their legs go weak, almost stumbling to the ground.

After scanning them, Jian Wushuang roared at Dao Lord Si Tian, “Would you dare say such things to Wan Xing? Would you dare say this to the other powerful beings from the other Original Planets?”

“If you dare, I might still respect you a bit. If not, then get lost!”

His long sword hung in the air before him. If Dao Lord Si Tian dared utter another word, he would strike directly. While Qishen Temple’s rules prohibited the killing of fellow Grand Yan Immortals, it didn’t say anything about not disciplining them.

Dao Lord Si Tian gritted his teeth and furrowed his brows. Just as he was about to speak, he snapped back to reality. This wasn’t the time for internal conflict.. If he and Jian Wushuang fought, wouldn’t it benefit those half- Step Dao Lords?
