4130 One Thought Divine Kingdom

It was indeed a great surprise.

The principles of the universe were Supreme. Even Supremes and Supreme-beings could only comprehend and use the principles of the universe to increase their own strength.

However, it was too difficult to obtain the recognition of the principles of the universe.

In the universe, under normal circumstances, only those who had obtained the heaven-defying opportunity could obtain the recognition of the universal principles. Only then could the universal principles bestow the power of the will, and the power of the will bestowed by the universal principles…there were strong and weak ones.

For Jian Wushuang, the power of the will, which directly increased his strength by ten times, was undoubtedly very heaven-defying.

“With such a powerful willpower, it can completely close the gap between Ninth Kalpa King’s innate divine ability and Jian Wushuang’s. Furthermore, Ninth Kalpa King’s innate divine ability has not even increased his strength by ten times, so it can’t be compared to Jian Wushuang’s willpower. This explains why Jian Wushuang was able to defeat his absolute art with a casual strike of his sword,” Supreme Giant Axe said with a smile.

“He wasn’t even able to use his innate divine abilities. The Ninth Kalpa King is going to suffer a major setback this time,” Ruler Blood Wave said with a laugh. As he spoke, he glanced at the nearby Ruler Gai Fu.

The Ninth Kalpa King had been personally escorted by Ruler Gai Fu to the Life Palace. Naturally, Ruler Gai Fu held the Ninth Kalpa King in high regard.

“Fall? It’s a little too early to talk about this,” Supreme Gai Fu looked at him indifferently and replied in a moderate tone.

“Huh?” Ruler Blood Wave was stunned at first, but then he asked in puzzlement, “Supreme Gai Fu, is there something else going on?”

Supreme Gai Fu did not answer him. Instead, he turned his head and looked at Jian Wushuang in the Mystic Light Mirror.

A flash of light suddenly flashed in the depths of his old and muddy eyes!

“He has been recognized by the universal principle and even bestowed with such a powerful willpower. This little guy named Jian Wushuang is indeed very outstanding, but...I’m afraid that’s not enough,” Supreme Gai Fu muttered to himself.

As the person who had personally brought ninth disaster back, he paid the most attention to Ninth Kalpa King. Even though Ninth Kalpa King had not been able to break through to become a Supreme all these years and his status in the Life Palace was not as high as before…Supreme Gai Fu was also slightly disappointed in him.

However, although he was disappointed, Supreme Gai Fu was still quietly watching Ninth Kalpa King’s growth.

In the past 20 chaos cycles, Ninth Kalpa King had rarely made a move. No one knew how strong he had become, but Supreme Gai Fu was an exception.

Supreme Gai Fu knew the most about Ninth Kalpa King. To be exact, every time Ninth Kalpa King made progress, he would report it to Supreme Gai Fu. Therefore, Supreme Gai Fu knew that Ninth Kalpa King, who had even used his innate divine power in the trial field, had a stronger trump card, however, he was still defeated by Jian Wushuang.

“It depends on whether Ninth Kalpa King is willing to reveal his trump card,” Ruler Gai Fu murmured. Then, his expression returned to normal and he did not say another word.

When Ruler Blood Wave and Supreme Giant Axe heard this, they looked at each other in dismay. A hint of surprise appeared in their hearts.

Ninth Kalpa King had a more powerful trump card?

...

In the trial field, countless stars twinkled and formed a brilliant sea of stars.

Ninth Kalpa King had gradually calmed down from his previous shock and disbelief.

His eyes were cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang and said in a low voice, “Jian Wushuang, there should be a special power contained in your sword just now. What is this power?”

“It’s the power of will.” Jian Wushuang did not intend to hide it because he knew that there must be someone among the experts of the Life Palace who could see the power of will.

“This power of will was granted to me by the universal principle by chance. It can increase my attack power tenfold,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Is that so?” Ninth Kalpa King understood. “No wonder I was crushed by your swordsmanship even though I used my innate divine power.”

But then Ninth Kalpa King immediately laughed, “Jian Wushuang, I have to admit that you’re a real genius. You’re also the most heaven-defying genius I’ve ever met. Even I was far inferior to you when I was in the third level of the Ruler realm, not to mention that you’ve only cultivated for 300,000 years,” Ninth Kalpa King said with admiration, however, his eyes grew colder and colder.

“It’s a pity that you met me.”

“If I give you more time, it won’t be too long. I estimate that in a few million years or even tens of millions of years, if you fight me again, I might really lose to you at the same realm. But now...”

The Ninth Kalpa King smiled coldly.

Boom!

Suddenly, an unprecedentedly powerful aura exploded with Ninth Kalpa King at the center!

This aura was completely different from the previous aura of Ninth Kalpa King. It was filled with the feeling of a profound great dao. As soon as this aura came out, the void of the trial field seemed to be unable to withstand it, it made a cracking sound like glass breaking!

Then Jian Wushuang saw that the surrounding space of the trial field began to change.

With Ninth Kalpa King as the center, a huge and magnificent power spread out.

This power was enough to suffocate any Ruler and make them tremble in fear. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This power even felt that it was not something that a Ruler-level cultivator could have.

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang’s face immediately changed.

This power...was...it gave him a very familiar feeling.

This Supreme power was completely superior to that of a Ruler. He had felt it from Blackhawk, Blood Wave, and Giant Axe...

It was...the power of a Supreme!

“How is this possible?”

Jian Wushuang stared at Ninth Kalpa King with his eyes wide open.

The surrounding trial space had completely changed into a unique world. The world was hazy, but there was a sky, a land, and mountains. It was the structure of a world.

The key was that the power of this world was not something that a Ruler could control.

“Could it be...” Jian Wushuang looked at the time of the structure and had a guess, but his face became ugly.

Outside the arena, the stronger Ultimate Rulers and several Supreme-beings were watching the changes in the arena.

“One-thought divine kingdom!”

“It’s one-thought divine kingdom!”

“Even Supreme-beings can only Ruler one-thought divine kingdom after reaching a certain level. The Ninth Kalpa King has used one-thought divine kingdom!”

Everyone outside the arena was in an uproar.
