Chapter 2666: A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique

A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique concept was by quickly freezing the space-time of a certain area.

It was equivalent to a space-time freeze tactic.

The tactic was powerful and terrifying.

The tall white-robed figure Jian Wushuang just saw did not show the technique’s full potential. Among the messages Jian Wushuang received, the divine technique was able to freeze a continent to which the Space-time could remain stagnant for hundred years to thousands and at the extreme even tens of thousands of years.

In other words, tens of thousands of years would have passed but time would not move by even a second in the frozen continent.

That was unbelievable.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang had already walked out of the Consciousness Space and slowly opened his eyes.

“The Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique is scary but it’s only one of the many tricks in Space-time Divine Technique.”

Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique was not the only technique in Space-time Divine Technique. Jian Wushuang discovered from the golden stone that there were at least two types of magical power and the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique was just one of the techniques. As for the other technique, Jian Wushuang was probably unable to sense it due to his still shallow perception of the Space-time Law.

Jian Wushuang looked at the golden stone strangely.

“The golden stone brought me into the Consciousness Space and made me form a connection with Space-time Palace but the golden stone did not contain any information about the Space-time Palace, but only contained two types of Space-time Divine Technique. What could the golden stone made by the Space-time Palace do?” Jian Wushuang was quite puzzled.

That was a question he could not answer for the time being.

“Just let it be! The Space-time Divine Technique is so powerful and happens to appear before me, so I can’t miss it. I’ll start with figuring out A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and soon he closed his eyes and began meditating meticulously.

He could enter the Consciousness Space at will through the connection he formed with the golden stone in his hand. As such, he repeatedly watched the scene performed by the tall white-robed figure while personally experiencing the tactic’s effects and potentials amidst also figuring out how to master the technique.

He had all the conditions needed to master the technique except sufficient perception capabilities.

Jian Wushuang had always been fast in understanding laws and techniques.

He was completely immersed in meditating and trying to understand the technique such that he had completely forgotten about everything else.

Time flew past.

The Sacred Palace had been calm with many disciples using various resources in the Sacred Palace to improve their strength.

As for the Crimson Stone Fort... Yin Su’er was indeed in a worrisome situation before Jian Wushuang’s arrival. The pressure on her had reduced a fair bit as the situation in Crimson Sone Fort stabilized once again after Jian Wushuang gave the Blood Gems to Yin Su’er—it was like giving her a chance in a new life.

There were no major events in the Crimson Stone Fort.

Nine years passed in a flash under such a calm situation.

Jian Wushuang who had been meditating for nine years in the secret chamber finally opened his eyes. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I barely mastered A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique after nine years.” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands together with a surprised look.

As a Perfect Chaotic Creature, Jian Wushuang had exceptional comprehension skills. He was extremely fast in comprehending various secret techniques and tactics.

The five strongest secret techniques from the Seven Stars Black Sect were easy for him as he only spent a very short time on them. However, he had spent altogether nine years in full concentration to comprehend A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique. The divine technique was indeed hard to comprehend.

“Although I’ve just barely grasped the technique, I’m afraid the power I’m able to discharge is just one out of a thousand percent from its full potential. It’s currently still quite useful for me. At the same time, my understanding of Space-time Law has also improved a lot. I can go to the Space-time Beast next and try to process what I’ve managed to master in the past nine years.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He soon stood up and headed to the Space-time Palace located in the Sacred Palace.

...

A large number of Sacred Palace disciples and experts were gathered on a vast combat field in the Sacred Palace with an ongoing battle in the center of the combat field.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A series of spear shadows with powerful strangulation power emerged.

A girl clothed in black with a menacing look had completely blended into the darkness while the spear in her hand was like a poisonous snake.

The extremely powerful spear was moving around strangely and swiftly.

The huge Principle World spread far and wide as the black-clothed girl was fighting against a quite well-known High-level Earth Ultimate God disciple from the Sacred Palace.

The genius disciple had an extremely high understanding of the laws and principles. However, he looked exceptionally awkward in front of the black-clothed girl.

He was wielding his saber, but it was neither a match against the black girl’s spear in terms of speed nor power.

The genius’s Principle World was completely suppressed as the black-clothed girl’s Dark Law perception was much higher.

Suppression. The battle was all about suppression from the beginning.

A moment later, the High-level Earth Ultimate God genius disciple was easily defeated by the black-clothed girl.

After she defeated the genius disciple, the black-clothed girl withdrew her spear and stood there shaking her head. “Weak, so weak!”

“He’s very ordinary whether in terms of his perception in law or principles understanding. I’m afraid he’s just mediocre among the High-level Earth Ultimate God disciples of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion.”

The black-clothed girl was telling the truth as she spoke her mind without any sugar coating. Perhaps it had something to do with her personality.

There were a large number of Sacred Palace disciples around with some experts from Sacred Palace looking a little ugly when they heard her statement.

They were helpless.

The genius who had just been defeated by the black-clothed girl was the top disciple among the High-level Earth Ultimate Gods in Sacred Palace, yet he was still easily defeated by the black-clothed girl.

It did not just happen once.

Three figures were standing behind the black-clothed girl.

The three figures with a touch of chilliness and arrogance between their eyebrows looked very young, but their divine power breaths were extraordinary.
