Chapter 2137 Judgemen

“You have courage to attack in the middle of the Imperial Palace!”A deep voice reverberated through the entire space and an overbearing aura was felt. The crowd fell quiet.

A red-haired elder who had his hands behind his back appeared in the space above the statues.

The aura came from him.

Everyone around looked at this elder man with red hair.

“It is a titan!”

“A titan in the realm of Peak Chaotic Realm appeared.”

“I recognize this man. He is Lord Feng Wu.”

Many cultivators look at him in respect and adoration.

Titans in the Peak Chaotic Realm were the equivalent to the great emperor realm in the Eternal Chaotic World. It was rare to see them in Three Emperors World and every single one of them was well respected by everyone.

This red-haired elder Feng Wu was one of them.

“Lord!”

“Lord!”

The six deacons greeted the elder man. One of them stepped out and said, “Lord, the six of us are in charge of maintaining peace and order here in front of the three statues. When Ancestor Hong Chen tried to kill someone, we tried to stop him immediately but he overpowered us. If you had not appeared, he would have killed the man successfully.”

“Oh?” Feng Wu knitted his eyebrows.

“Lord Feng Wu. I am from the Ling Clan from the Prefecture Tong. My family has no grudge with Ancestor Hong Chen. I also have never done anything to piss him off and have no idea why he attacked me today. I hope you, my lord, can help me.”

“Nonsense!”

Once Ling Tianhao had finished speaking, Jian Wushuang roared, “If I had no reason, why would I bully a youngster like him? Back then the Ling Clan and the Dan Clan allied with each other and almost killed me. Since I met a disciple from the Ling Clan, of course I wanted to kill you to vent my anger.”

“Humph!”

Feng Wu looked at Jian Wushuang coldly and said, “Even if you had great resentment against the Lin Clan, you should settle it outside the Imperial Palace. Since you are in the palace now, you need to obey the rules.”

“Your name is Hong Chen, right?”

“You attacked others and almost killed someone within the Palace. You have infringed the rules set in place in the Imperial Palace and you shall be punished!”

“I sentence you to a hundred thousand years within the Emperor Jail.”

Feng Wu said coldly as he declared Jian Wushuang’s sentence.

Everyone was shocked.

The Emperor Jail was a place which all the high-profile prisoners were sent to. There were many ways inside to torture their victims. Even experts in the Chaotic Realm would turn pale once they heard of the Emperor Jail. Usually, a Chaotic Realm Expert would start breaking down after a thousand years.

A hundred thousand years?

Even an expert in the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm would not have been able to take it.

No one dared to stand up for Jian Wushuang. They felt that Jian Wushuang should receive punishment when he broke the rules. Feng Wu was one of the few titans in the Emperor Cabinet. He had the right to sentence people to jail. They felt that Jian Wushuang should take the punishment willingly.

In reality…

“Haha. Me? Going to the Emperor Jail for a hundred thousand years? Dream on!”

“I like my unrestrained lifestyle and I don’t care about the rules within the Imperial Palace. Since I am not welcomed here, I shall leave.”

Jian Wushuang laughed and turned around as though he was about to leave.

“How dare you!”

Feng Wu roared in anger, “The Imperial Palace has its own rules. If you are obedient and enter the jail for a hundred thousand years, you can still be free. If you do not obey my orders, you shall die!”

“I will die? What a joke!” Jian Wushuang was not afraid as he tried to leave.

“Die!”

Feng Wu stopped wasting time with Jian Wushuang as killing intent surged. His aura erupted and covered everyone around.

He moved.

He was like an emperor as he attacked Jian Wushuang.

He was very quick and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang almost instantaneously.

“Die!”

Feng Wu yelled as he chopped with his blood red sword.

Clouds of blood filled the entire space as the Imperial Palace turned red.

A terrifying aura radiated outwards as the experts turned pale.

“This is the power of an expert in Peak Chaotic Realm!”

“Only those in the Peak Chaotic Realm could be called titans. The difference in each stage within the Chaotic Realm is too large.”

“Ancestor Hong Chen could have survived if he had listened to Lord Feng Wu and gone to the Emperor Jail and stayed there for a hundred thousand years. Looks like he will die here today.”

“Lord Feng Wu is attacking him personally. Ancestor Hong Chen is dead meat.”

“Humph. He asked for it himself. Who can he blame?”

The experts around looked at him sympathetically.

They all felt that Jian Wushuang was definitely dead.

It was normal for them to think so. There was no doubt that a Peak Chaotic Realm could kill a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm easily, especially within the Imperial Palace.

Even if Feng Wu could not kill him, there were other titans within the palace that could.

The blood-red strike appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. It contained the Power of Spacetime and locked onto Jian Wushuang. He could not have escaped even if he’d wanted to.

Jian Wushuang stood there and smiled playfully.

He did not attempt to dodge, which made the rest think that he was either too shocked to move, or he knew he couldn’t dodge it.

In reality, he was not worried at all.

Jian Wushuang saw the red-haired elder Feng Wu before. Back then, he had been one of the guardians of the Supreme Emperor Stone and they’d even fought.

It was a pity Jian Wushuang had lost easily as there were three of them there.

Feng Wu was at the power level of an ordinary stage one great emperor. Jian Wushuang was not worried about attacks coming from him.

Eventually, the blood-red slash hit Jian Wushuang in the chest as it tried to slash him into half.

In the end… Clang!

This sound made it seem like the slash had clashed onto an indestructible rock, not a human being.

After the collision, only a spark was seen. Jian Wushuang was unharmed.
