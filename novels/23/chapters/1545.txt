Jian Wushuang stayed in Lineage of Star since then.

He never paid attention in cultivation as his power had reached a bottleneck. The only thing he could do was improve his comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine. However, such comprehension didn’t require him to cultivate in seclusion but natural comprehension in a relaxed state would have a better effect.

Jian Wushuang stayed in Sword Star and drank with Ling Feibai, Long Ya and a few others occasionally. Sometimes, he would give pointers to Qiu Yue and the other maidservants regarding cultivation.

Every one hundred years, he would visit Real God Hall and he would stay in there for a year.

The time flew past. It had been a thousand and eight hundred years in the blink of an eye.

In the one thousand and eight hundred years, Jian Wushuang lived at ease. In the one thousand and eight hundred years, he stayed in Lineage of Star and never left.

…

Real God Hall.

The entrance suddenly opened and Jian Wushuang, who had comprehended in it for a year, slowly exited.

After he exited Real God Hall, Jian Wushuang let out a heavy sigh.

“As expected, ever since my comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine reached the standard of passing the first level of Doctrine Palace, my comprehension towards the Power of Heaven Way has stopped entirely. Even after I comprehended in Real God Hall for a year, there wasn’t much improvement,” Jian Wushuang felt helpless.

He knew since long ago that with his improvement in comprehension, his speed of improvement was as slow as a snail, even with the assistance of Real God Hall.

A hundred years ago, also one hundred thousand and seven hundred years after he had come back from Wu Bei’s cave, his comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine already reached the standard of the first level of Doctrine Palace.

After reaching that standard, he had no space for improvement in terms of comprehension towards Power of Heaven Way.

For the past century, there was no improvement in both Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine.

“I’m still restricted by my realms as Universe God in the Second Heaven,” Jian Wushuang sighed emotionally.

In his current state, he had even reached the limit of unique skill that his realm could be at.

It was the same in terms of soul strength.

Then, even his comprehension towards Power of Heaven Way had reached the limit of a Universe God in the Second Heaven. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In other words, unless he passed his third Inverse Cultivation Test and become a Universe God in the Third Heaven, he wouldn’t improve at all in terms of his power.

Many years passed but the third Inverse Cultivation Test never came. There weren’t even any signs of it coming.

Regarding that, Jian Wushuang was rather helpless too. He could only sit and wait patiently.

Lineage of Star, in the rolling palaces, Jian Wushuang was walking alone slowly.

On the way, he met many disciples of Lineage of Star. The disciples were discussing him quietly as they looked at him with admiration.

One should know that for the past one thousand and eight hundred years, the brand new Universe God ranking list and the incident in Wu Bei’s cave had spread like wildfire.

As the most eye-catching person in Wu Bei’s cave and the third-ranked on Universe God ranking list, Jian Wushuang was naturally the disciples’ role model.

They were even many disciples of Lineage of Star who treated Jian Wushuang as the pride of Lineage of Star.

After all, ever since Star Palace Master had started Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang had been the first to get listed in the top three on Universe God ranking list.

But what they didn’t know was that he was deeply distressed that his third Inverse Cultivation Test had yet to come.

Just then, there was a message that popped in.

“Mister, the person that you asked Vientiane Tower to look for, we found a clue.”

Jian Wushuang’s footstep paused and there was a glimpse of light in his eyes.

“Finally, there’s news!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but clench his fists.

Two thousand years ago, since he had been released from Sky Sword Prison, he found Vientiane Tower and entrusted them to look for his wife for him for a price of ten hundred million Chaos Gem.

Vientiane Tower promised that they would reply to him within three thousand years.

But then, it had been two thousand over years and Vientiane Tower really did give him an answer.

…

On Star land, in a secret room in the Vientiane Tower branch where Jian Wushuang had requested the task.

“Mister, according to your criteria, Vientiane Tower went through two thousand years of searches and finally found one person. It is extremely likely that she is the Primordial Great Sinner that you are looking for,” a purple-haired elderly stood before Jian Wushuang as he said.

“Extremely likely? In other words, it’s not certain?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“It’s hard to be certain. After all, her behavior is creepy and she won’t reveal herself, nor did she fight with anyone. Vientiane Tower only found her through multiple indications. We are definite that she is a Primordial Great Sinner and she is a woman. On top of that, she only appeared in Eternal Chaotic World within the last ten thousand years!”

“With these three indications, although Vientiane Tower isn’t a hundred percent sure that she is the person you’re looking for, we are at least seventy percent confident,” the purple-haired elderly said.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted.

A Primordial Great Sinner, a woman, and she had only appeared in Eternal Chaotic World in the past ten thousand years.

The three signs did match his wife, Leng Rushuang (Leng Ruxue).

“It must be her!” Jian Wushuang grew emotional and he immediately asked, “Where is she now?”

“According to the news that Vientiane Tower received, she is currently in Blood Demon Church in Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom and she seems to hold a high position in Blood Demon Church,” the purple-haired elderly replied.

“Blood Demon Church?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

The name Blood Demon Church itself indicated that it wasn’t any kind sect.

“Blood Demon Church in Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom belonged to a strong force. They seem to have quite a few Real Gods too,” the purple-haired elderly smiled.

“In a Holy Kingdom, means that it is outside of Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Soon after he left Vientiane Tower, he returned to Lineage of Star.

When he arrived at Lineage of Star, he went to see Hall Master Yuan immediately.

In the cave made of unique gemstones.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s rare that you come to see me. Could it be that your third Inverse Cultivation Test is coming, or did you reach a bottleneck in your cultivation and you need me to prepare some cultivation resources for you?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang attentively.

“The third Inverse Cultivation Test never came, not even a sign. As for cultivation resources, I don’t need them as of now. I came here today to ask Hall Master Yuan for a favor,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” Hall Master Yuan raised his eyebrows. He knew that Jian Wushuang’s character was proud and aloof. If it was something he could do himself, he definitely wouldn’t ask for the other’s assistance. But then, Jian Wushuang found him. He definitely ran into trouble that he couldn’t resolve on his own.

“Tell me, what do you need me to do for you?” Hall Master Yuan looked at him.
