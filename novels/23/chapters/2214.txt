Chapter 2215 Palace Master

“Is that the case?” The disciples watching then understood what had happened.The most powerful man in the Lineage of Stars was the Palace Master.

Below the Palace Master were the hall masters, who were all almighties.

Among all the hall masters, Hall Master He Xiu was one that many respected greatly.

He himself was a genius who was incredibly powerful. By many myths he was also a lineal disciple of the Palace Master. He was one of the most powerful men in the Lineage of Stars.

It would have been weird if one did not improve greatly after being mentored by him personally.

After hearing the explanation, Chen Feng felt more at ease.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang looked weird.

He Xiu was his lineal disciple.

“Never have I thought that little brat would have such a high status within the Lineage of Stars.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You there. You have yet to answer my question. How did you know Senior Brother Tian Yi has yet to use all his sword skills? Furthermore, who are you?” The teenage girl in purple clothes asked Jian Wushuang again.

“I guessed it,” Jian Wushuang answered casually.

“You guessed it?” The teenage girl in purple clothes did not want to let Jian Wushuang go just like that.

Right then... Whoosh!

A top figure appeared on this star as the aura of a top tier Chaotic Real God radiated out in all directions.

All the disciples on that planet panicked.

“What are all of you doing?”

It was a graceful, handsome young man. Even though he was not angry, everyone was afraid. He scanned the crowd as all the disciples including Tian Yi and Chen Feng lowered their heads. Aside from Jian Wushuang, no one dared to look him in the eye.

This graceful young man noticed Jian Wushuang.

The graceful young man turned pale as he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang at the next moment.

“Greetings, Palace Master,” the graceful young man greeted as he broke out in cold sweat.

The reason why he radiated out his aura was to control the situation. He had never thought that Jian Wushuang would be in the crowd as well.

“Ling Feibai, it has been a while. How are you?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

This graceful young man was Ling Feibai. They had both been disciples of the Star Palace at one point in time. When Jian Wushuang had just joined the Star Palace, he had fought Ling Feibai and lost to him. Now that they had met again, their fighting power and status were incomparable.

However, Ling Feibai was a genius. He was the strongest top tier Chaotic Real God. His name was on the Real God ranking list and he had high hopes of breaking through to become an almighty.

“Palace Master still remembers me.” Ling Fei Bai was pleasantly surprised.

Seeing this, the other disciples were shocked.

“Who is he? Why does Elder He Ling treat him so respectfully?”

“Elder He Ling is one of the most powerful real gods within the Lineage of Stars. He does not even treat an ordinary hall master with this much respect.”

“If I heard correctly, Elder Ling called him Palace Master?”

“Palace Master? Which Palace Master?”

The disciples were shocked.

Palace Master?

How many Palace Masters were there within the Lineage of Star?

There was only one!!!

The identity of the man in front of them...

“There are some things I have to do. I shall take my leave.” Jian Wushuang smiled as he disappeared from everyone’s sight.

After Jian Wushuang left, everyone on the star erupted into a frenzy.

“Palace Master. Oh my god. I actually saw the Palace Master himself!!!”

“The Palace Master of the Lineage of Stars is one of the most powerful men in the Eternal Chaotic World. He managed to turn the tides of the great battle more than twenty thousand years ago and was our savior. He just appeared in front of us?”

“It really is the Palace Master. Never had I thought that he would be this easy going.”

The disciples started to chatter in excitement.

Jian Wushuang was referred to as a legend.

WIthin the Eternal Chaotic World, many young cultivators respected him and believed in him blindly.

Especially those from the Lineage of Stars and the Green Fire World.

However, it would be extremely difficult for even almighties to meet him personally.

As for these disciples in the realm of universe gods, it was all the more impossible to meet him.

However, Jian Wushuang had just appeared in front of them.

“Oh my god. I just spoke to the Palace Master and he replied?” The teenage girl in purple clothes was dazed. She was overwhelmed with excitement.

At the same time, she finally knew why Jian Wushuang knew that Tian Yi had yet to use all his sword skills.

Even though it was Hall Master He who had mentored Tian Yi, Hall Master He Xiu was Jian Wushuang’s disciple.

Jian Wushuang did not know that the disciples had reacted that way.

He had appeared on that star to view the battle between the disciples as it had piqued his interest.

After he left that star, Jian Wushuang reached the meeting hall within the Lineage of Stars where Hall Master Yuan, He Xiu, Hall Master Gu Xin and others were waiting.

Jian Wushuang sat on the throne within the meeting hall and the remaining ten experts sat below him.

The number of almighties within the Lineage of Stars was higher more than before.

Some of these almighties were originally disciples within the Lineage of Stars, while others were experts that came and pledged their loyalty.

During the battle, the Lineage of Stars suffered heavy losses. Emperor God Jiu Yin, Emperor God Xuan Wu and Hall Master Nie Yun died and Lineage of Stars needed experts to fill the gaps.

Right now, these almighties looked at Jian Wushuang respectfully.

“Come, speak. What happened?” Jian Wushuang asked as he looked down at everyone.

Hall Master Yuan stood up and said, “Palace Master. As you know, the Lineage of Stars is getting stronger by the day. Our influence and standing in the Eternal Chaotic World is also improving. Now we are wondering what to do to those enemies we had.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Lineage of Stars indeed had many enemies.

Back then, there had been three forces that had allied together and attacked their headquarters. Luckily, he had been there. With the help of Emperor Thirteen, they had defeated this wave of enemies.

After that, because of the great war, the Lineage of Stars had focused on improving their own strength. However, they would still fight there and teach their enemies if necessary. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, they had already settled their grudges with some of their enemies.
