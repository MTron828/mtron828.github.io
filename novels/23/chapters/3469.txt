Chapter 3471 Destroying the Dead

At this moment, the Nine-tailed Clan had completely calmed down. Da Ying had also used her lightning-fast methods to control the Nine-tailed Clan into an iron plate. She was not afraid of Xiao’er’s bewitchment at all.

“Da Ying, this is your own choice. In that case, you can’t blame me,” Xiao’er said coldly. “There’s no point in talking nonsense. If you have the ability, just bring your men and attack directly,” Da Ying said.

“Hehe, Da Ying, it seems that you’re very confident in the Nine-tailed Clan’s protective array. That’s right. After all, it’s a five-element array obtained from the universe battlefield. Under normal circumstances, unless a sage realm master or a ruler level powerhouse comes personally, it’s impossible to break it. Unfortunately, there are exceptions to everything. Today, I want you to see how this protective array was broken.” Xiao’er smiled coldly.

“Marquis Duan Yu, let’s do it!”

Marquis Duan Yu had already made full preparations. After Xiao’er’s signal, he smiled faintly and waved his hand, causing a green token to fly toward the array in front of him.

This green token was the realm-breaking token!

“Realm-breaking token?” Da Ying saw this green token in the array and recognized it at a glance. However, she still smiled lightly. “So what if there is a realm-breaking token? Do you think that just because someone said so, this array can be…”

Before Da Ying could finish her words, she suddenly stopped.

That was because she had already noticed that after the realm-breaking talisman entered the formation, the originally indestructible clan-protecting formation began to tremble crazily at this moment.

The entire formation was trembling violently as if it was on the verge of collapse.

At the same time, as the Nine-tailed Clan’s clan leader, Da Ying also received a message from the formation spirit at the first moment.

This message told her that someone had used a great method to infiltrate the inner part of the formation and had already broken most of it. Now that the realm-breaking talisman had been used, the formation could not withstand it and was about to collapse!

“How is this possible?”

“This is the strongest formation of our Nine-tailed Clan. How could it be broken by someone?”

Da Ying’s expression changed drastically. She did not believe that the strongest formation of the Nine-tailed Clan could be broken by someone.

But the truth was in her eyes.

Rumble…

A violent rumble suddenly came from the array formation. Following that, the five elements array formation that covered the entire Nine-tailed Clan began to collapse, the five elements — gold, wood, water, fire, and earth — scattered crazily.

In the blink of an eye, the five elements array formation that the Nine-tailed Clan was proud of completely collapsed.

And the Nine-tailed Clan was completely exposed in front of the many experts of the Divine Moon Palace Camp.

“Da Ying, don’t you just want to trap and guard this array formation and wait for the experts of the dark world to arrive? Do you think I don’t Know?” Xiao’er sneered, “But unfortunately, this array formation has already been broken. You won’t be able to wait for the experts of the dark world to arrive either!”

“Those who belong to the Divine Moon Palace, charge in. Those who dare to resist will be killed without mercy!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao’er’s voice was solemn.

Previously, no matter if it was to deal with the Howling Demon Clan or the Scarlet Gold Clan, Xiao’er had given orders to keep the experts of the other party as long as possible so as to facilitate her control and strengthen her own side.

But now, facing the Nine-tailed Clan, Xiao’er displayed an unprecedented killing intent.

It was clear that she did not want to rely on her charm to control the experts and clansmen of the Nine-tailed Clan. Instead, she wanted to completely wipe out the entire Nine-tailed Clan through a bloody massacre, then, she would take control of it and make the Nine-tailed Clan truly submit to her!

The nature of these two were completely different.

Hearing Xiao’er’s order, the numerous Principles Masters of the Divine Moon Palace camp instantly moved.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! – – – – One after another, incomparably powerful auras soared into the sky. Nearly fifty Principles Masters either transformed into a sea of fire, shrouded in boundless darkness or were like blades or sharp blades, directly charging into the Nine-tailed Clan.

A terrifying aura that was like a raging wave completely enveloped and suppressed the Nine-tailed Clan.

The Nine-tailed Clan was in a complete uproar.

The expressions of the Nine-tailed Clan members changed drastically when they saw the Principles Masters swarming over like wasps.

They knew very well that the Nine-tailed Clan could not compare to the Divine Moon Palace in terms of overall strength. The only thing they could rely on was the Nine-tailed Clan’s clan protection array. However, they did not expect the clan protection array to be broken by the Divine Moon Palace.

Without the protection of the array, the experts of the Divine Moon Palace directly charged over. How could they resist?

“Quick, stop them!”

“No matter what price we have to pay, we must stop them!”

Low cries rang out one after another. Even though they knew that there was a huge difference in the battle strength between the upper echelons of the two sides, the masters of rules of the Nine-tailed Clan still tried their best to meet them, wanting to stop the experts of the Divine Moon Palace.

However, the Principles Masters who chose to meet them were only a part of them. There was still a part of them. Previously, they were only forced by Da Ying’s suppression and then placed their hopes on the clan protection array. But now that the clan protection array was broken…this part of the experts immediately understood the situation in front of them. Hence, they gave up on resisting and did not attack.

The people of the Divine Moon Palace also listened to Xiao’er’s orders. As long as they did not resist, they would not attack them.

As a result, there was no way to resist the power of Divine Moon Palace in front of the experts of Divine Moon Palace.

It was completely one-sided.

“It’s as easy as crushing a dead branch.”

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the void outside the Nine-tailed Clan. He looked calmly at everything in front of him. He also understood that since the protection formation of the Nine-tailed Clan had been forced…moreover, when two different voices emerged in the chaos of the Nine-tailed Clan, he knew that there was almost no suspense in this battle.

If there was only one suspense, it would be Da Ying!

“After all, Da Ying is an expert at the peak of the six realms of the void. It’s not easy to deal with him. Chenhuo, go. If you don’t help, no one in the Divine Moon Palace Camp will be able to stop him,” Jian Wushuang said.

He had already seen Da Ying fight with Axe One Master and Star Saint Master.

Although they were fighting one against two, Da Ying still had the upper hand.

There was nothing he could do. Although Axe One Master and Star Saint Master were both at the six void realms, they were still far from the peak of the six void realms. If they joined hands, they could barely fight against Da Ying.

“What About You? Will you fight in this battle?” Demon Master Chenhuo glanced at Jian Wushuang slowly. “Of course, there are a few acquaintances of mine in the Nine-tailed Clan. I have to greet them properly.” Although Jian Wushuang was smiling, his smile was as cold as a blade, his eyes were already looking at the two people in the battlefield ahead.

These two people were Da Yu and Da Su!
