“Is he about to succeed?”

The Lord Spirit Sound had been watching the images from the Mirror Image all the time. Right now, her face broke into a smile.?“It’s right. He is an Inverse Cultivator on the Divine Realm expert level, and should be regarded as an Eternal Realm. Besides, he has good opportunities — a supreme bloodline from the Ancient God, a set of remarkable sword formation and the Secret Skill of Divine Yin Thunder from the Star Island. It is natural that he could pass.”

The Lord Spirit Sound was not very surprised by Jian Wushuang’s performance in the third level.

But the others were totally dumbfounded.

Inside the third level, Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies cooperated with each other. The World Body controlled the sword formation, while the Slaughter Body fought in close combat. The two were a perfect combination.

Shoo!

The horrific sword formation broke through the air like a bloody electric drill. Before the Blood Demon could ward off the formation, the sword light from the Slaughter Body shot toward him from the other side. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The Blood Demon had exhausted himself, but was still completely suppressed.

Being suppressed by his opponent, the Blood Demon grew weaker and weaker. Finally, the longsword stabbed fiercely at the Blood Demon, whose body exploded right away.

The Blood Demon collapsed!

“He passed!”

“The Blood Demon is defeated!”

“He really passed the third level!”

In front of the Black Tower, the crowd was shocked at the sight.

Even the five Dao Masters hiding in the dark were astonished by what they saw.

After passing the third level, Jian Wushuang could leave the damnable place of Stellar Fog Sea.

It was the expectations of everyone on this island.

In history, only the Star King left Stellar Fog Sea four million years ago. Today, Jian Wushuang was the second person to do so.

...

“He passed!”

Seeing that the Blood Demon totally collapsed, Jian Wushuang was finally relieved. He waved his hand, and the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation immediately broke up into many Blood-sky Swords, which were then stored in the Interspatial Ring.

His two Original Bodies reunited.

“Blood Mountain.”

Out of nowhere, the Lord Spirit Sound showed up in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Spirit Sound.” Jian Wushuang looked over.

“It took you only two hundred and ten years to pass Level Three of this Black Tower. Very impressive!” She sighed softly and then made a gesture. “Follow me.”

Jian Wushuang felt an invisible force rushing toward him, and his body was no longer under control. At the same time, in front of him, a space wormhole suddenly appeared and directly drew him in.

The moment he crossed into the wormhole, the space on the third level quieted down.

The Mirror Image in front of the Black Tower disappeared.

The crowd was still there. Everyone was praising and discussing, waiting for Jian Wushuang to walk out from the Black Tower.

...

On a lake covered by endless grey fog, huge lotus leaves floated on the surface of the water. Suddenly, Jian Wushuang emerged out of thin air on top of one of the lotus leaves.

“This is...” He looked around.

“This is Star Lake, the place where I live.” Lord Spirit Sound was standing before him. She continued, “What I have left on the Star Island is only an incarnation. What you see now is my Original Body.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded slowly.

“Blood Mountain, you are clear of the rules on Star Island. You should know that after passing the third level of the Black Tower, you are qualified to leave the Stellar Fog Sea.” Lord Spirit Sound went on, “But there was something else.”

“Something else?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“You can leave Stellar Fog Sea if you pass the third level. This is true. Apart from it, you’re also qualified to be a disciple of the Star Bloodline.” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“A disciple of the Star Bloodline?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Star Bloodline?

What was the Star Bloodline?

He had never heard of it in the Eternal World.

But he could guess that the Star Bloodline must have something to do with the great expert who had created the vast Stellar Fog Sea.

“Blood Mountain, listen carefully. The Stellar Fog Sea was created with great means by the founder of the Star Bloodline. The purpose of its existence is to select qualified disciples for the Star Bloodline.” Lord Spirit Sound narrated.

“There are four Black Towers on Star Island, representing four different levels of tests.”

“Among these four levels, the levels of the Divine Realm, Eternal Realm and Dao Master are designed to help select ordinary disciples.”

“You just passed the Eternal Realm test, and could be accepted as an ordinary disciple of the Star Bloodline.”

“This is your disciple token.”

Lord Spirit Sound handed a token to Jian Wushuang.

He automatically took it over and put it on his hand. A closer look at the token with his consciousness, he discovered a vast sea of Stars, boundless and bottomless, sending out a unique and frightening aura.

That aura was strong enough to make Jian Wushuang’s heart tremble.

He swallowed hard, and quickly calmed down. Then he asked,”Lord Spirit Sound, you’ve talked so much about the Star Bloodline. But where is it exactly? Why haven’t I heard about it in the Eternal World?”

In his eyes, the founder of the Star Bloodline, who had created the Stellar Fog Sea, must be a remarkable expert. Such a mighty person shouldn’t be unknown to others. His Star Bloodline shouldn’t be unheard of.

“The Star Bloodline is not in your Realm. It’s natural that you haven’t heard about it.” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“Not in this Realm? Then where?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Lord Spirit Sound glanced at him and smiled. “The Eternal World is huge. It’s not as simple as you think. Your knowledge about it is like a drop of water in the sea. When you become a Dao Master and have a wider knowledge, you’ll naturally know. ”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned.

What he knew about the Eternal World was only a fraction of it?

How big was the Eternal World exactly?

“You don’t have to know too much about the Star Bloodline. After all, you are so weak right now. You should improve your strength first.” Lord Spirit Sound smiled.

“By the way, now that you’ve passed the test and become a disciple of the Star Bloodline, I’ll choose three opportunities for you and then send you away. This is the rule set by the founder.”

“Three opportunities?” Jian Wushuang’s heart lightened.
