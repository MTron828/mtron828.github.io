Chapter 1609: Getting A Disciple

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang wore a smile and he was over the moon.

He was clear how impressive the method of power superposition that he had mastered was.

The presence of such a method would be a lot better than the attack power Unique Skills that he would use a lot of time and energy to create in the future.

Take the Ten Waves move as an example. Previously, this move had only barely reached the requirement of being a high-level Stage Two Real God Unique Skill. However, by mastering the power superposition skill at that very moment, the Ten Waves move would definitely be equivalent to a Stage Two Peak Real God Unique Skill.

Moreover, he could also continue to develop the Ten Waves move in the future.

After all, Ten Waves was the fusion of ten sword shadows which were created by Jian Wushuang using his own sword essence, his understanding of Sword Principles, as well as his comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way. As his Sword Principles and his comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way improves in the future, he would definitely be able to create eleven, twelve or even more shadows. Hence, the power of the move would continue to get stronger.

Ten Waves could absolutely become Twenty Waves, Thirty Waves and even One Hundred Waves.

As such, Jian Wushuang said that Ten Waves was not suitable to be the name of this move. Instead, Myriad Waves was the most suitable name.

As Jian Wushuang was thinking, all of a sudden… an emaciated body appeared in front of him again.

“Ah, elder,” Jian Wushuang looked toward the person who had appeared and he had a modest expression.

He was certain that it was because of the advice of the ‘elder’ in front of him that he could master the power superposition skill. As such, he naturally felt indebted to the elder.

“Little kid. Let me ask you. Have you ever had a Master?” the strange old man looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“I have,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head instinctively.

The eyes of the strange old man squinted slightly and he raised his voice: “Is that Master of yours dead or alive now?”

“That…” Jian Wushuang frowned and he said immediately: “Of course he is still alive.”

“Then, if I wish for you to cut ties completely with that Master of yours and have me as your only Master for the rest of your life, would you be willing to do so?” the strange old man said.

“I’m not willing,” Jian Wushuang shook his head straight away.

The strange old man in front of him had indeed given him some advice and he was grateful for that. However, the strange old man actually wanted him to betray his Master for that. Was that a joke?

“Wayayaya!!!”

The strange old man laughed weirdly and his eyes turned completely red, “Damn little kid. You have learnt the power superposition skill that I have taken lots of effort to create and in the end, you are unwilling to have me as your Master? Do you believe that I will kill you straight away or even kill your Master who is supporting you?”

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang could not help but be stunned.

Previously, the strange old man in front of him had gone out of his way to give him advice to comprehend the stone tablet. However, after he had learnt the power superposition skill, the strange old man had become dissatisfied and wanted to snatch him forcefully to become his disciple?

What the hell was going on?

“Elder, I am very grateful to you for giving me advice and helping me learn this power superposition skill. However, it is impossible for me to betray my Master just because of this. As for elder being furious and wanting to kill me, you can go ahead and do it. However, this place is the Thunderbolt Island. Thus, I believe that elder should be cautious as well. As for my Master…”

Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently, “My Master left me and went somewhere else a long time ago. Even I have no idea where he is. If elder wishes to kill him, you may go ahead and do it straight away.”

“Little kid. Are you trying to say that I’m unable to do anything to you?” the strange old man stared at Jian Wushuang.

“That’s not what I mean. I am thankful for elder’s advice and I will always remember this debt in my mind. However, it is impossible for me to give up on my own Master,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Remember the debt in your mind?” the strange old man rolled his eyes and laughed weirdly, “How about this. If you are really grateful to me, after you return to the Lineage of Star, get some White Blaze Fruits for me to try. I do not need a lot, just three will do.”

“Three White Blaze Fruits?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

One White Blaze Fruit was already extremely precious. However, the strange old man had asked for three right away. It was really daylight robbery.

“Elder, I really wish to know what you want the White Blaze Fruits for. Is it really for the purpose of eating?” Jian Wushuang asked doubtfully. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Of course,” the strange old man laughed, “In my whole life, I have had nothing that I liked. What I like most is to eat and try all the flavors in the world. Moreover, the more difficult it is to get the item, the better it is. For example, the White Blaze Fruit is exceptionally rare and, to date, I still have not tried it.”

“All right,” Jian Wushuang had no choice, “Elder, I have no guarantee as to whether I can help you get three White Blaze Fruits. However, if you really want delicious fruits, I actually have some of them with me and I wonder if elder will like any of them.”

After his speech, Jian Wushuang took out some precious fruits.

Those fruits were obtained from experts who were killed by Jian Wushuang. Hence, there were definitely some rare and precious treasures.

However, when the strange old man saw the fruits that Jian Wushuang had taken out, he regarded them as beneath his notice. He only took an additional glance at a purple-red fruit. After that, he extended his hands and grabbed the purple-red fruit.

“Among all your items, only this Dark Silk Fruit can be considered decent,” as the strange old man spoke, he took a bite of the fruit. However, taking a bite, he threw the fruit away, “It’s taste is only normal.”

After seeing such a scene, Jian Wushuang’s heart could not help but shrink.

It should be known that the Dark Silk Fruit was worth about two hundred million Chaos Gems in the Eternal Chaotic World. If it were Doctrine Gems, the Dark Silk Fruit would be worth two of them which were almost equivalent to all the treasures of an Eternal Real God. However, the strange old man threw the fruit away after taking just one bite of it.

“Little kid. I shall not make things difficult for you anymore. If you are able to get some White Blaze Fruits in the future, go ahead and get them. If you are unable to get them, you will still have to get me something rare such as the Illusory Heart Carp which is a Celestial Bird. Also, I will stay on Thunderbolt Island. If you are able to get something delicious in the future, you can use this token to contact me.”

The strange old man threw a token to Jian Wushuang and left straight away.

After Jian Wushuang caught the token, he still had an extremely puzzled expression.

“What a weird person.”

“After talking to me for so long and even wanting to make me his disciple, I still don’t know his name.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head and laughed. He then put the token in his Qian Kun Ring.

At that moment…

“Jian Wushuang, how is Thunderbolt Island?” Hall Master Yuan messaged.

“Not too bad,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“I heard from the people that during this period of time in the Thunderbolt Island, you have been comprehending in front of a tablet with records of a claw-type Unique Skill. What’s going on?” Hall Master Yuan questioned.

“I have my own reasons for comprehending over there,” Jian Wushuang did not explain too much.

“Yes, as long as it’s of use to you. It is up to you to decide how you want to train on the Thunderbolt Island. However, remember not to waste this opportunity.”

After his speech, Hall Master Yuan cut the transmission.

Jian Wushuang grinned, “It’s about time for me to head to the Fairy Palace.”
