Chapter 2721: Golden Principle Spirit

“Don’t meddle with these principle spirits and cross over as fast as possible!” Saber Master yelled softly before waving the purple battle saber tightly in his hand.

Whoosh~~ Purple saber-lights immediately traveled forward with a burning purple flame and burned the principle spirits completely wherever it went.

However, Saber Master only managed to walk two steps forward after that attack as an overwhelming number of principle spirits immediately blocked his path.

The other Grand Ultimate Gods were also facing an uncountable amount of principle spirits.

Those principle spirits might only be at the ordinary High-level Heaven Ultimate God level or lower and poses not much threat to those Grand Ultimate Gods. However, there was a huge number of them that came rushing over in a dense state. Although they were able to easily withstand the spirits, they also used up a lot of their divine power.

They could only try their best to conserve their divine power while their bodies slowly moved forward and with extreme difficulties.

After half an hour, those Grand Ultimate Gods had only traveled one-third of the journey in the area but already used up a huge amount of their divine power. Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods like Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen had even used up 40 to 50 percent of their divine power.

The two of them had no other way apart from moving forward slowly while consuming several pills at once to replenish their divine power.

Jian Wushuang was also facing the same situation alongside the two of them.

He was able to easily withstand the huge amount of principle spirits that came rushing toward him but was also greatly consuming his divine power.

However, his divine power was really vast compared to the Grand Ultimate Gods there.

He owned a truly vast and almost endless divine power ocean!

Even when coming across a fight that needed him to use all sorts of secret techniques on top of everything else, his abundant divine power was sufficient to support his crazed killings for a very long time.

His current situation constantly utilized his divine power, but it only used a small portion when compared to the vast divine power ocean he had and barely affected him.

It would not be an issue for him even if he stayed there and continued using his divine power for 10 to 15 days based on his current utilization rate.

Therefore, he was the most relaxed person compared to the five other Grand Ultimate Gods.

However, he did not want to show his relaxed expression to the Devilish Wind King and the others.

Therefore, he also pretended he had utilized a lot of his divine power and was struggling in extreme difficulties while fighting those principle spirits by covering his forehead with sweat and taking a couple of pills during the fight.

Those pills were also used to replenish his divine power.

However, he was just putting on an act as he did not want to be too conspicuous with all of them being Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

Time flew by and another hour passed by in a flash. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Apart from Jian Wushuang, the others had used up half of their divine power with the Devilish Wing King and Yi Shen’s divine power was near to the point of being exhausted before the group of six finally arrived at the edge of that special area.

Once they arrived at that area’s edge, the principle spirits that initially came attacking crazily had slowly backed away.

“Have we finally made it through that area?” Jian Wushuang lightly exhaled and pretended to be relieved.

“It’s still too early to be happy as we haven’t completely crossed over this dangerous area yet,” said the Devilish Wind King solemnly beside him before taking out several pills and swallowing them at the same time.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The principle spirits had already faded away but they had not completely walked past that dangerous area?

“What’s coming next is the most difficult part in passing through in this second dangerous area,” said the Devilish Wind King with a serious expression on his face.

The others also had the same expression on their faces as they stared at Jian Wushuang.

Three golden streams of light had started gathering on the other side.

In the blink of an eye, three extremely huge golden principle spirits appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the others.

“These principle spirits...” Jian Wushuang squinted and could sense that those three principle spirits were completely different from the other principle spirits they bumped into just moments ago.

Those previous principle spirits only had the combat power of ordinary High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods or lower and were unable to threaten them. They only had to use some divine power to withstand them.

However, any of the three principle spirits before them brought extreme pressure to Jian Wushuang.

“Alliance Master Su Han, don’t look down on these three golden principle spirits. They are extremely powerful. We need to pass through these three golden principle spirits if we want to continue advancing. Those things are extremely difficult,” said the Devilish Wind King seriously.

“That’s right. All three of these golden principle spirits are extremely strong.” Yi Shen also spoke up.

“We shall follow our previous agreement. There are three golden principle spirits. I will handle the first one and directly pester it without allowing it to have any attacking chances. Hong Chen and Long Xianzi, the two of you need to work together and pester one of them. As for the last one...Su Han, Yi Shen, and Devilish Wind King—the three of you should be able to force your way past if you work together,” said Saber Master.

“No problem.”

“Alright.” Everybody nodded together.

“Attack!” Saber Master spoke while suddenly moving forward and directly appeared in front of the first golden principle spirit to attack with the purple battle saber in his hands. The purple battle saber carried a burning purple flame and looked as though it was going to burn the entire void.

The golden principle spirit also carried a sword and it waved it overbearingly as it only attacked with the sword and not using any sword principle.

As a result... The purple flames covering the entire void were completely extinguished following a loud banging sound. The Saber Master also staggeringly took a couple of steps backward.

“Such strength!” Jian Wushuang could not help but be surprised when he saw that.

Saber Master was a top-tier expert placed among the top ten within the Danyang Continent. He was famous for his tyrannical strength and his extremely frightening saber skills but he was still forced back by the golden principle spirit. Undoubtedly, the golden principle spirit’s power was at the Peak Grand Ultimate God level.

“Alliance Master Su Han, this golden principle spirit is too strong. Remember, we aim to rush past it from the area and not engage with it. Later, we shall rush by it when we have the chance,” yelled the Devilish Wind King softly.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang had a cold expression on his face.

The three of them skimmed forward in a row and directly appeared in front of the third golden principle spirit.

The golden principle spirit moved without any hesitation and directly waved the sword in its hands.

Whoosh!

An extremely huge golden sword-light directly came swinging toward Jian Wushuang and the two others.

Before the sword-light arrived, the monstrous power had already caused the Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen’s facial expressions to change.

“Let’s take action together and block this sword attack,” yelled the Devilish Wind King softly.

The three of them immediately made a move at the same time.

The Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen gave their best while Jian Wushuang also waved the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands as they released a valiant that was close to one released by a High-level Grand Ultimate God.
