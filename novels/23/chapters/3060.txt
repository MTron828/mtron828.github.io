Chapter 3062: Making an Exception

________

The three-eyed man, the green-haired woman, and Mo Shan all felt incredulous.

“Although it’s a little unbelievable, it’s the truth.” The silver-haired old woman said seriously, “The mountain king personally sent a message. According to the Mountain King, the Heavenly Sword Marquis didn’t defeat the three of them after a tough battle. Instead, he crushed the three of them easily. The three of them even felt that the Heavenly Sword Marquis didn’t use his full strength.”

“You can easily crush Mountain King and the other two, but you haven’t even used your full strength yet?” The three-eyed man was shocked.

“Hag, is that why you came to find me?” Mo Shan looked at the silver-haired old woman.

“Yes.” The silver-haired old woman nodded slightly. “If what Mountain King and the other two said is true, then this kid called Heavenly Sword Marquis is a little too terrifying. Such a genius is worthy of the attention of our Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Now, the three Palace Masters already know about this matter. And Mo Shan, you’ve dealt with that kid before. If nothing unexpected happens, the three Palace Masters should be looking for you.”

“Three Palace Masters?” Mo Shan was stunned.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance was publicly acknowledged as the number one Freedom Alliance in the Divine Beginning Realm. It had countless experts!

For example, the Principles Masters who were usually high and mighty could be considered the strongest experts in any place in the Divine Beginning Realm, even in the vast third firmament. However, there were quite a number of Principles Masters in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, these Principles Masters also had differences in strength and status.

And the three Palace Masters mentioned by the silver-haired old woman were the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, the Heaven and Earth Palace, the Primitive Palace, and the Primal Chaos Palace.

They controlled the three palaces and had most of the resources of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. They were high and powerful, and their strength was also incomparably powerful.

Mo Shan and the others were also in awe of these three Palace Masters.

“Oh?” Mo Shan’s expression suddenly changed. “As expected, the three Palace Masters summoned me.”

After saying that, Mo Shan ignored the reactions of the people around him and directly closed his eyes at the table.

The silver-haired old woman, the three-eyed man, and the jade-haired woman did not dare to disturb him.

This was an incomparably grand palace. There were incomparably tall steps on the palace. At the top of the steps, three thrones stood side by side. On the thrones, there was a hazy figure. These three hazy figures…belonged to the three Palace Masters. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

And below the Great Hall, Mo Shan stood there respectfully.

Of course, regardless of whether it was the three Palace Masters or Mo Shan, they were merely consciousness incarnations. Their true bodies were all in different places.

“Mo Shan…about that genius called Heavenly Sword Marquis, say it.”

Among the three Palace Masters, the Palace Master sitting in the middle spoke.

Mo Shan took a deep breath and then respectfully explained everything he knew in detail.

Including the scene where he personally invited Jian Wushuang to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and even some speculations about Jian Wushuang’s refusal.

…

In the chaotic void, beside the stone table, Mo Shan opened his eyes again.

“Mo Shan, how is it?”

The silver-haired old woman, the three-eyed man, and the green-haired woman immediately looked over.

“The three Palace Masters summoned me and asked me in detail about Heavenly Sword Marquis. After that, the three Palace Masters discussed for a bit and came to a decision.” Mo Shan said.

“What decision? Should we send another invitation to Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The silver-haired old woman asked.

“No.” Mo Shan shook his head. “According to the rules of the three Heaven-cleaving Palaces, no matter how outstanding a genius is, he will only be invited twice. This is the pride of the three Heaven-cleaving Palaces. Although Heavenly Sword Marquis is extremely talented, it is not to the extent that the three Heaven-cleaving Palaces would break the rules. However…”

“However what?” The silver-haired old woman immediately asked.

“Although the three Palace Masters did not ask me to invite Heavenly Sword Marquis again, they made an exception for him.” Mo Shan said.

“Make an exception?” The three silver-haired old women were very puzzled.

“Heaven-cleaving mystic realm!” Mo Shan’s voice sank, “The Three Palace Masters have instructed that Heavenly Sword Marquis has unparalleled potential and limitless achievements in the future. Even if he doesn’t want to join the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, he can only be a friend of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and not an enemy. What should be roped in, must be roped in. Therefore, they agreed to make an exception for him to go to the Heaven-cleaving mystic realm!”

“What?”

“What?” The three silver-haired old women were shocked.

The Heaven-cleaving mystic realm…if it was an ordinary expert, hearing these words would not cause any waves. However, the few people present were all high-level officials of the three palaces. They knew a lot of secrets about the many resources in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

For example, they knew very deeply about the Heaven-cleaving mystic realm.

It was said that the Heaven-cleaving mystic realm was a mystic realm opened by the mysterious leader of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Moreover, this mystic realm was not the Heaven and Earth Mystic Realm, but… The Universe Mystic Realm!

It was one of the biggest opportunities in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces and even the entire Heaven-cleaving Alliance. It contained endless opportunities. No matter who it was, anyone who entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm could gain a lot, they could even obtain great fortune.

Many people’s strength improved greatly because they entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

There were also some people who were stuck at a bottleneck for many years and were unable to make a breakthrough, but once they entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, they immediately made a breakthrough.

There were also some people who did not improve much when they entered the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, but after they came out of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, their strength increased by leaps and bounds.

In short, the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm was definitely a land of fortune.

There were many geniuses in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, and everyone was filled with desire for the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

However, even among the geniuses in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, 99% of them were not qualified to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. Instead, they needed certain conditions.

This specific condition was the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces’ genius competition every 10,000 years.

This competition would give birth to three people who could enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. Among them, there were two from the Primal Chaos Palace, a total from the Primitive Palace, and none from the Heaven and Earth Palace.

One had to know that this was a chance that only came once every 10,000 years, and there were only three people who could enter.

One could imagine how harsh the conditions for entering the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm were.

But now, this Heavenly Sword Marquis was not a member of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, but the three Palace Masters actually made an exception for him to go to the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?

Was this a very big exception?

“Impossible, this is impossible! No matter what, that Heavenly Sword Marquis is not a member of the three palaces. How could the three Palace Masters make an exception for him to go to the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm because of his high talent?” The three-eyed man growled.

“I also think it is impossible, but it is the truth. This was personally ordered by the three Palace Masters, and they all came to a unanimous decision,” Mo Shan said.

“This…” The three-eyed man could not help but be stunned.

“Could there be other reasons besides the talent of the Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The silver-haired old woman suddenly asked.

“Maybe.” Mo Shan shrugged. “But no matter what, the three Palace Masters have already given the order, and this matter is left to me. It seems that I have to go meet the Heavenly Sword Marquis again…”
