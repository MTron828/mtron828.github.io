Chapter 2356: Experts From The Water Fairy Island

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Xiang Yi, Qian Yuan. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the three experts from the Water Fairy Island are most likely here for Jian Wushuang. A few years ago, Jian Wushuang killed a Half Step Divine Demon from the Water Fairy Island,” said Xiang Zong.

“So that’s how it is?” Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi smiled.

“Since they are here for revenge, we can stay for a little longer to enjoy the show.” Qian Yuan smiled coldly before retreating to the empty space at one side.

In the Lin Mansion, they were about to cheer when they thought that the experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect and Xiang Family were leaving. However, they soon quietened down.

They had also noticed the trio from Water Fairy Island.

“Looking at their outfits, they are experts from the Water Fairy Island. Damn!” Lin Tiefeng’s expression darkened and he could already foresee their objectives.

“The experts from Golden Cauldron Sect are just about to leave and now the stronger Water Fairy Island is here?” Zhuo Yunfeng’s expression became extremely bitter.

As for Fire Fairy, she didn’t say a single word.

As for the Thunder Sound Sect, they couldn’t offend the Golden Cauldron Sect. As for Water Fairy Island, it was an even larger existence.

Even Jian Wushuang, who had always been calm and composed, became a little solemn upon seeing the trio from the Water Fairy Island.

“The trio...” Jian Wushuang was staring directly at the approaching trio.

The trio was made up of two men and one woman. The two at both sides were Second Grade Divine Demons judging from the aura exuding from them. Moreover, they weren’t ordinary Second Grade Divine Demons. At the very least, they were a lot stronger than Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi. This wasn’t the most frightening thing yet.

The most frightening thing was the elder with red eyebrows standing in the middle.

That elder with red eyebrows had a stoic look and a demeanor that intimidated others without showing any anger. The moment Jian Wushuang saw the elder with red eyebrows, he subconsciously felt immense pressure.

This pressure was definitely not the kind an ordinary Second Grade Divine Demon would possess. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“A First Grade Divine Demon?” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself as he furrowed his brows.

Within the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm, the difference between a Third Grade Divine Demon and a Second Grade Divine Demon was extremely huge.

Therefore, the difference between a Second Grade Divine Demon and First Grade Divine Demon would only be greater.

Jian Wushuang knew clearly the reason why he could sweep through the six men from Golden Cauldron Sect was because they didn’t have a powerful Second Grade Divine Demon that could do something to him.

However, in terms of real battle strength, Jian Wushuang estimated he would likely only be able to match one of the three experts from the Water Fairy Island even if he went all out.

If that First Grade Divine Demon from the Water Fairy Island were to fight Jian Wushuang personally, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t stand a chance.

The three approaching figures finally stopped above the Lin Mansion.

Among the three of them, that elder with red eyebrows looked around and asked in a cold but loud voice. “Which one of you is Jian Wushuang?”

“I am,” Jian Wushuang answered.

Although he was wary of the other party’s strength, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be so intimidated as to not respond to his own name.

“Did that disciple from our Water Fairy Island die at your hands?” The elder with red eyebrows fixed his eyes on Jian Wushuang instantly. At the same time, a powerful divine might weighed down on Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang wasn’t an ordinary Chaotic Realm.

If it was just a simple pressure from divine might, even an expert above the Divine Demon Realm wouldn’t affect him much, let alone a First Grade Divine Demon.

“If that disciple you spoke of is Yan Que, she died at my hands,” answered Jian Wushuang.

“A meagre Chaotic Realm could remain so calm and composed under my divine might? That’s pretty rare,” the elder with red eyebrows commented.

“Your Excellency, regarding Yan Que, she was invited by the Zhuge Family to kill Jian Wushuang. Therefore...” Lin Tiefeng attempted to speak up for Jian Wushuang.

“Shut up! Since when was it your turn to speak?” The elder with red eyebrows glanced at Lin Tiefeng and the same terrifying divine might shrouded Lin Tiefeng.

Although Lin Tiefeng was a true Divine Demon Realm expert, he clearly couldn’t be as composed and calm as Jian Wushuang under the stifling pressure of that divine might. His face became flushed with blood and his breathing turned erratic. He couldn’t even say a word.

Having taught Lin Tiefeng a lesson with just a glance, the elder with red eyebrows looked at Jian Wushuang once again.

“I don’t care about the reasons behind you killing Yan Que. However, she was a disciple of my Water Fairy Island after all and wasn’t someone that could be killed casually. Since you killed a disciple from my Water Fairy Island, you will have to leave your life behind.”

The moment he finished his words, he reached out his palm and pointed at where Jian Wushuang was.

A simple point stirred up a terrifying divine power and formed a towering finger.

The giant finger carried terrifying pressure and came before Jian Wushuang in an instant.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. As the giant finger pushed towards him, he took a step forward and swung out his Blood Mountain Sword at the same time.

The Secret Skill of Seven Star and Punisher God had enhanced the power behind the shocking sword essence to a ludicrous level.

Peng!

Following a loud boom, Jian Wushuang was knocked several steps back. However, the towering giant finger had dissipated fully.

“So this is the strength of a First Grade Divine Demon?”

After stabilizing himself, Jian Wushuang frowned deeper. “This isn’t quite right. The strength of a First Grade Divine Demon isn’t just limited to this. He’s just trying to sound me out with this strike and isn’t intending to kill me.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t sense any killing intent from the elder with red eyebrows.

Moreover, he could tell that the elder with red eyebrows was holding back in this strike. Even if he failed to decimate the giant finger, it would most likely not injure him severely.

“Trying to sound me out instead of killing me?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled and looked towards the elder with red eyebrows.

However, the elder with red eyebrows revealed a deep grin at this point. “Previously, someone informed me that an exceptionally demon-like talent appeared in the small Anjiu Prefecture. With just a cultivation base of Early Stage Chaotic Realm, his battle strength isn’t weaker than that of an ordinary Chaotic Divine Demon. He even killed a few Chaotic Divine Demons. At that moment, I didn’t believe it at all.”

“Now that I’m seeing it with my own eyes, it appears that he did not lie to me.”

The elder with red eyebrows was clearly pleasantly surprised.

He was a First Grade Divine Demon and even within Water Fairy Island, he was an elite expert and part of the highest management.

Yan Que was just a Half Step Divine Demon without any status in Water Fairy Island. Her death wouldn’t have alarmed a First Grade Divine Demon enough to come here personally.

The reason why the elder with red eyebrows had come personally was naturally for Jian Wushuang.

Now that he had seen it and sounded out Wu Yu personally, the elder with red eyebrows was extremely agitated.
