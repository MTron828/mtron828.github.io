Chapter 933: The War Breaks Out

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

There were 24 golden figures who had gathered behind Emperor Leng in total.

Despite their expressionless faces, their aura was strong and steadfast. They were evidently Dao Masters.

“They’re Emperor Leng’s 24 Heavenly Guards!”

“They’re said to be Emperor Leng’s most elite force and they’re all genuine Dao Masters!” Those on the drill ground exclaimed.

“Xia Yu.” Emperor Leng turned to Xia Yu. “This is all happening because of our marriage alliance. Does your clan intend to help?”

“Fret not, Your Highness. Since we’ve formed a marriage alliance, we’re now a family. Whoever is against you is also against our clan. Naturally, we’re on your side,” Xia Yu said with a laugh.

Xia Yu then crushed a token.

The crushed token caused a space wave to break out and a wormhole to appear in the Void.

Then, numerous people filed out of the wormhole.

The nine of them, coupled with Xia Yu, Elder He, and Xia Mang, meant there were now 12 members of the Xia Clan present. They stood together, emanating dangerous auras.

The 12 Dao Masters of the Xia Clan were all here.

“Emperor Xiao, it’s been a long time! How are you?” asked a booming voice that resembled the growl of a beast.

“Xia Tao.” Emperor Xiao frowned as he stared at the leader of the Xia Clan, who was a burly man with brown hair.

His name was Xia Tao. He was the Master of the Xia Clan as well as Xia Mang’s father.

While he was not as strong as the Ancestor of the Xia Clan, he was also an overlord of the Eternal World. Not even Emperor Xiao would dare underestimate him. Today, Xia Tao had even brought all the other Dao Masters in his clan with him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You’re here too, Lord of Cercis Island. Looks like you’ve chosen to side with Emperor Xiao.” Xia Tao narrowed his eyes at Lord of Cercis Island.

“Correct.” Lord of Cercis Island nodded.

“What a pity.” Xia Tao shook his head. “I had previously entertained the idea of forming a marriage alliance with you but it wasn’t fulfilled due to some mishaps. Now that we couldn’t be a family and you’re in Emperor Xiao’s camp, I’d have to keep you here forever.”

Lord of Cercis Island laughed. “I’ve lived for too long anyway. I’d be happy to have you help me end it.”

“Enough of the chat! Let’s settle our affairs here today, you bitch!” Emperor Xiao sneered.

“Humph! You suffered such a terrible defeat back then and today, you’ll experience the same!” Emperor Leng’s eyes glinted with a powerful killing intent.

“Go!”

Emperor Leng’s command prompted everyone in her camp to move, including her 24 Heavenly Guards and the Dao Masters from the Xia Clan.

“Take care of yourself, young man,” Emperor Xiao said casting a glance at Jian Wushuang.

“I will.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

He was no longer the same youngster that Emperor Xiao knew in the past. He was now qualified to participate in this war today.

“Kill!”

Everyone in Emperor Xiao’s camp also began moving following his command.?This included the 10 War Gods with Di Jing at the helm, the Beiming Clan, and other Dao Masters that Emperor Xiao invited, such as Lord of Cercis Island and Master Blood Saber.

Jian Wushuang gripped his Blood Mountain Sword firmly and felt his aura skyrocket. He swiftly readied himself to attack.

The camps of Emperor Xiao and Emperor Leng had more than 60 Dao Masters in total.

They were about to collide.

“Hurry and retreat! We should retreat now!”

Everyone on the drill ground panicked when the two camps started to attack each other.

Tens of millions of people at the drill ground withdrew with unprecedented shock and madness. They were very clear that the war between so many Dao Masters would cause incredible chaos and wanted nothing more than to retreat as far as possible for fear of getting involved.

Even a battle between two Dao Masters would spell disastrous consequences for anyone unlucky enough to be nearby.

Yet, there were more than 60 experts at the level of Dao Masters in the camps of Emperor Xiao and Emperor.

That was such a big amount.

Emperor Xiao, Emperor Leng, Lord of Cercis Island, and Xia Tao reigned supreme among all these experts.

Nobody wanted to get involved in such a war.

Even the strong experts, including Deep Sea Palace Master and Elder Deadwood, in the audience had retreated to a distant place. None of them wanted to get involved because there was no promise that they would survive it.

The experts from both camps finally collided in the Void.

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

There was a terrible explosion in the sky.

The war had just begun but there were already more than a dozen large Black Holes in the Void.

The smaller ones were almost 10 meters in diameter while the bigger ones were more than 30 meters in diameter.

Terrible forces were also directed onto the ground. Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang’s battle had previously created many pits but the entire drill ground was immediately reduced to ruins after a detonation.

The drill ground continued to collapse despite having already been reduced to ruins.

The spiritual powers of different colors formed spiritual storms one after another, sweeping in all directions. The entire battlefield was completely enveloped in an unprecedented storm. Those weaker than a Dao Master would be killed if they touch the storm. Jian Wushuang, who lived in defiance of the natural order, was the only exception.

The terrifying storm continued to expand at a frantic pace.

The entire battlefield was also expanding wildly.

The war broke out on the vast drill ground but it was not large enough to accommodate the many powerful Dao Masters. Before long, the battlefield covered more than half of the imperial palace.

“Bang!”

Nearly a hundred buildings in one corner of the imperial palace fell apart following a loud explosion. They collapsed into smithereens that were swept away by a gust of wind.

“Swish!”

The ground in the center of the imperial palace was ruthlessly cleaved open with a flash of blade light and a huge knife mark was left there. The mark was over 300 meters deep and made for a terrifying sight.
