Chapter 5284: First Refinement

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In this battle, Jian Wushuang thoroughly understood all his opponents.

The entire valley had become his garden; within ten years, he effortlessly cleared all the beasts. Apart from the Tiger Kings corpse, he also brought back all the wolf heads to his cave.

This harvest was enough to sustain him for three months without needing to hunt; he just needed to refine his body. The power in the flesh and blood of these beasts was formidable. Even after devouring them, Jian Wushuang needed to refine his body, absorbing all the essence from their flesh and blood.

For example, the Tiger Kings blood was a great tonic for his physique. His bones underwent changes, and the golden patterns on his body became more pronounced.

In the following days, he wholeheartedly refined his body, absorbing the essence of the Tiger King, breaking through his physical strength to a hundred thousand.

Its still not enough! Jian Wushuang looked at the bones scattered all around, feeling somewhat helpless.

He had thought that the Tiger King would at least elevate his physical body to a higher level, but in the end, it only increased his strength a bit. The changes in his bones were not significant either. After all, he wasnt a heaven-defying talent.

As his physical body grew stronger, the beasts in the valley no longer posed a threat to him. Whenever he felt hungry, he would casually hunt down a water buffalo, He chose to eat only the freshest meat.

Time flew by; ten years passed in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang finished gnawing on the last rib of lamb, letting out a satisfied burp.

Now, he was no different from a wild man, covered in dirt, wearing tattered clothes.

In this valley, he was the only one left who could breathe.

The incredibly burly Jian Wushuang made the earth tremble with every step he took, each footfall weighing tens of thousands of kilograms.

Thud!

On the final day, Jian Wushuang stood atop a cliff, overlooking the valley where he had once fought the Tiger King. These ten years had been the most extraordinary period of his cultivation journey.

He had truly become a wild man, living completely off the land.

For millions of years under the starry sky, at least he still had some strength left. But when he first arrived in this valley, he was just an ordinary man, weaker than the wild boars that roamed the area.

And now, it was time to leave. He took one last look.

In the next moment, he jumped directly into the unfathomable pool below.

He took a good look at his robust physique.

Now, he seemed to have undergone a complete transformation. His entire skeletal structure was massive. Clear and clean golden patterns emerged on his chest and back, becoming more prominent as he exerted force.

The harder he exerted himself, the more prominent the golden patterns became.bender

The golden patterns depicted an ancient and unfamiliar beast, unknown even to Jian Wushuang.

Inside the Demon-Sealing Pillar, outside the Trial Tower.√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

A middle-aged man in black armor pointed, and a stream of light turned into tens of thousands of radiance, flying into the Trial Tower.

Each beam of light transformed into a black-robed messenger, guiding the hundred thousand Jian Wushuangs within the Trial Tower.

Finally, the golden light condensed into a single point, and the hundred

thousand duplicates also merged into one Jian Wushuang.

The Jian Wushuang who returned inside the Demon Suppression Pillar was no different from the one who had just entered.

The frenzied Demonic Annihilation Armor was still there!

Whats this? Jian Wushuang exclaimed in astonishment.

In that moment of fusion, he realized that he had actually split into a hundred thousand duplicates.

No need to be surprised. In the first Refinement, youve already completed half of it, said the man in black armor indifferently.

Jian Wushuang quickly stowed away his armor, revealing a black martial attire underneath. With a slight exertion, his upper garment shattered into pieces.

Looking at his chest, golden patterns gleamed brightly, outlining every inch of his flesh.

His divine body, amplified a thousandfold, operated furiously at this moment.

Both his divine body and origin source returned, and the familiar sense of control brought Jian Wushuang back to reality completely.

In astonishment, he asked, Senior, is all of this an illusion?

He found it hard to believe, His physical body had undoubtedly strengthened, but everything felt unreal, especially after transforming into a hundred thousand copies, each with identical memories and no deviation whatsoever.

It was too miraculous!

The man in black armor smiled faintly and replied, Advance to the Universal Bronze Furnace first. Once your initial refining is complete, Ill answer your questions. Right now, you havent even completed half of it. After your physical body is truly condensed and tempered, that mill be the first refinement.

Indeed, if enhancing the supreme physical body were that simple, it wouldnt deter so many powerful beings.

The threshold of the divine body, the process of refining the supreme physical body, couldnt possibly be this straightforward.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

He understood that once he entered the first level of the trial tower, he wouldnt be able to use anything. He would be merely an ordinary person at that point.

But the threshold for refining the supreme-quality physical body was the divine body, which he couldnt use inside the trial tower. Obviously, something was amiss.

Perhaps the threshold of the divine body lay within this Universe Bronze Furnace.

His hair billowed, his upper body bare, and his broad back resembled that of a war god.

Crack!

The Universe Bronze Furnace was opened.

A scorching wave of heat washed over him.

This aura was potent enough to annihilate Grand Yan Immortals, yet Jian Wushuang was about to immerse himself in it for a whole hour, refining his body.

If he didnt possess a body a thousand times stronger, he would likely be reduced to ashes within moments of entering!

Jian Wushuang swallowed hard, his lips parched. After bowing respectfully to the black-armored man, he resolutely stepped into the bronze furnace. Inside the furnace, he truly experienced what hellish torment meant!

The scorching sensation was far from ordinary earthly flames.

Within this cosmic bronze furnace lay a fragment of a prime source.

As soon as Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on the burning red ground, he sensed the pulsating energy of the source.

Its an unclaimed prime source! Jian Wushuangs face lit up with joy.

In an instant, a daring idea sprang to his mind. Initially, he thought the source belonged to the black-armored senior outside. Now it seemed someone else had infused this prime source here.

Buzz!

Before he could dwell on this, the moment the cosmic bronze furnace closed, flames soared.

Whoosh!

Countless treasures were taken out, all necessary for the first refining.

These treasures alone could directly enhance a Grand Yan Immortals physical body to perfection.

The treasures from the first three refinements were enough to forge a body stronger than even Emperor MO Longs.

This was just a direct upgrade. If the Universe Bronze Furnace aided in tempering his body, his first refinement might rival the perfection of a high-grade body.

Jian Wushuang had no time to think about anything else. Countless treasures were refined by the flames into a golden liquid, swirling around his body.

The scorching flames incessantly eroded his body, causing it to decay and then regenerate repeatedly.

This continuous cycle proved too much for even the mightiest divine body to withstand.

Especially since he had expanded his domain of Beast God to its utmost limits. Although the range now only covered his physical body, the expenditure of Yan power and divine energy remained the same.

An hour passed, and he truly reached his limit.

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth; this was more painful than he had imagined.

Every time his body shattered, it grew stronger by a fraction.

He needed 10,000 shatterings.

The blood essence from 10,000 realms needed to merge into one entity, it wasnt as simple as it sounded..
