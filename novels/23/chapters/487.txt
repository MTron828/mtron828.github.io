“Ladies and gentlemen, the Sword Principle Meeting is over and my Lord has his own business to deal with, so I will have to ask you all to leave now,” said the purple-clothed woman who had received the experts when they first arrived.

The experts left the valley without hesitation after hearing those words.

“We’re being asked to leave. It seems that they don’t want us to stay any longer.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Let’s go,” Jian Nantian said flatly. Then, he headed out of the valley with Jian Wushuang.

The handsome Su Ming stood at the highest point of the valley, staring at Jian Wushuang’s retreating figure off in the distance, with a twisted expression on his face.

“Zizhong.” Su Ming spoke.

“Your Excellency?” A purple-robed man came before him.

“Follow Jian Wushuang. Once he exits the valley, kill him and bring back the Heart-killing Sword,” Su Ming ordered in a low voice.

“Yes, your Excellency.” The purple-robed man nodded respectfully and began following Jian Wushuang.

“The Heart-killing Sword is mine. No one can take it from me!”?Su Ming’s eyes were as cold as ice.

However, outside the valley, the experts had yet to walk away. Instead, they were waiting quietly.

“Look, those two are Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu.”

Right outside the exit, stood two figures with vigorous auras. They were none other than the two marquises from earlier.

The marquises were obviously waiting for Jian Nantian.

They had wanted to kill Jian Nantian, but for fear of enraging Su Ming, they had waited until this moment, when everyone exited the valley.

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian walked out the valley, side by side.

They immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“They came out!”

“Why are they together?”

“Things have become interesting. If we kill Jian Nantian, we’ll get two Dao Weapons, one from Jian Nantian and one from Marquis Xuefeng.”

“As for the Jian Wushuang, he’s taken possession of the Heart-killing Sword and even combined three Sword Souls, which is the first time someone has achieved that in our entire history. He must have some big secrets. If we can kill him, we will earn a lot.”

The experts who were waiting watched Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian very closely.

In their eyes, the two were like walking treasures and killing either one of them could benefit them a lot.

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian spotted Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu just as they came out of the valley.

“They’re waiting for you.” Jian Wushuang cast Jian Nantian a meaningful eye.

“Just two shrimps,” Jian Nantian said in a mocking tone.

He despised the two marquises even though they were top experts in this land.

“How about each of us takes one of them?” Jian Wushuang asked his father while smiling. His words showed that he did not take the marquises seriously.

“Fine.” Jian Nantian nodded. “I’ll take Marquis Wanlei and you deal with Marquis Nanyu.”

“No problem.”

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian charged toward their targets like two flowing lights.

Their eyes were fixed on Jian Nantian, so Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu immediately rushed forward the moment they saw Jian Nantian move.

“Jian Nantian, go to hell!” The bad-tempered Marquis Wanlei roared.

“Save your words.” Jian Nantian remained indifferent.

In the blink of an eye, the two forces were already within range for close combat.

“Marquis Nanyu, your opponent is me.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice echoed. A blurry sword shadow stuck out, cutting through the space in front of Marquis Nanyu and forcing him to defend.

Marquis Nanyu took out a saber that was surrounded by knife essence and casually blocked the sword shadow with it.

“Boy, you dare to fight me?” Marquis Nanyu shot Jian Wushuang a chilling glance.

The marquis had witnessed how Jian Wushuang combined his three Sword Souls and gained the Heart-killing Sword, but he did not believe he was capable of possessing such a magic weapon.

Therefore, he was not interested in Jian Wushuang or the Heart-killing Sword.

“I’ve heard of the 72 Marquises since I entered the Divine Land, but I haven’t had a chance to battle a real marquis until now,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Battle me? While you’re only in the Saint Realm?” Marquis Nanyu glanced at Jian Wushuang with scorn in his eyes.

Despite his excellent performance inside the valley, it didn’t change the fact that Jian Wushuang was still in the Saint Realm.

As for Marquis Nanyu, he was at the Seven-cloud Realm, so he thought that Jian Wushuang was insane to battle him.

“Boy, since you’re in a rush to die, I’ll grant your wish and accept your Heart-killing Sword.” As Marquis Nanyu’s words fell, he turned into a shadow.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang only saw an elusive shadow flashing at a high speed, but he could feel a tempestuous killing intent surrounding him.

He narrowed his eyes, ready to use the Triple-kill Sword that was already in his hand.

“A marquis in the Seven-cloud Realm doesn’t deserve to face the Heart-killing Sword!” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Behind him, a golden streak of light began to surge as a giant golden Sword Soul Phantom materialized.

The phantom, that was over 50 meters tall, appeared once again.

An overwhelming Sword Essence immediately swept the area.

If it had been before Jian Wushuang entered Sword-suppression Valley, he would have fled when facing a marquis.

However, things had changed in the valley. He had experienced the thousand sword salute and his power had skyrocketed. More than condensing seven Slaughter Origin Marks, he had also succeeded in combining his Sword Souls.

He could tell that, even though he now only had one Sword Soul Phantom, this golden phantom was more powerful than the previous three added together and could allow him to display even more power.

“I can’t wait to see how powerful my new Sword Soul is.”?Jian Wushuang licked his lips.

The space in front of him was sliced open as Marquis Nanyu’s saber drew near.
