Chapter 2530: Full Retreat

Jian Wushuang once again struggled out of the cracks under everyone’s scrutiny and appeared in front of the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture is truly a premier of the Eighteen Prefectures’ Three Great Ultimate Gods. I’m impressed!” Jian Wushuang said with a bright voice.

According to Xiao Tiexin, the Infernal Heart Prefecture’s Governor was the best among the Eighteen Prefectures’ Three Great Ultimate Gods.

It was indeed true based on his observation.

Even among Peak Ultimate Gods, there were very few who could open up their World after all. Most of them had to become an Earth Ultimate God before they could do so, but the Governor had already achieved so.

“That strike just now was my most powerful sword strike. It should’ve killed you or at least severely injured you when it struck your body head-on, but you’re completely fine. It’s impossible unless you practice certain extremely powerful protective secret techniques or...your golden armor is a Heavenly Treasure!” The Governor sternly stared at Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, he was 90% sure Jian Wushuang’s armor was not only a Heavenly Treasure but also extremely high-leveled. Otherwise, Jian Wushuang could not remain unscathed under his most powerful strike.

“A Heavenly Treasure armor!” The Governor’s eyes were shining with a touch of greed.

Artifacts were categorized into three categories—Mystical Treasures, Earthly Treasures, and Heavenly Treasures!

Among them, Earthly Treasures were already considered very good as most regular Ultimate Gods only used Pinnacle Earthly Treasures. Those among Peak Ultimate Gods who could afford to use Heavenly Treasure weapons were very rare.

For example, the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor did not own a Heavenly Treasure.

However, not only was it a piece of Heavenly Treasure present before him but was also a protective armor-type.

Protective armors were a lot more precious than offensive mystical gear.

Jian Wushuang noticed the Governor’s greedy eyes.

His protective armor was indeed at the Heavenly Treasure level, but its powers were not as exaggerated as it seemed. He was injured by the strike just now but immediately used his divine powers to recuperate without the Governor’s noticed.

‘I have experienced his ‘Sword World’ when we fought, hence there’s no longer any need to continue being entangled with him.’

Jian Wushuang had made up his mind as he immediately laughed and said, “Mr. Governor, thank you for the lesson today. Let’s cross hands again if we get a chance in the future.”

Jian Wushuang’s laughter was resonating between Heaven and Earth, but his figure had already shot all the way backward.

“Wishing to escape?”

The Governor’s expression turned dark as he immediately moved to chase after Jian Wushuang.

After knowing that Jian Wushuang possessed a Heavenly Treasure armor, the Governor had absolutely no intentions of letting Jian Wushuang live, not to mention that the remaining 15 prefectures must kill him to salvage their reputations since he had indeed annihilated three prefectures.

Other than Infernal Heart Prefecture’s Governor, Luo Brothers, and remaining Ultimate Gods also immediately chased after Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang only smiled faintly when he saw that before pointing his finger toward them.

Just from pointing his finger... Boom!!!

A titanic divine power erupted like a volcano that had stayed idle for billions of years.

It was incredibly overwhelming.

At that instant, the divine power that swept out of Jian Wushuang’s body had challenged the Ultimate Gods’ knowledge in divine powers.

“How’s that possible?”

“His... His divine power... How can it be so much?”

“It’s above Earth Ultimate Gods, Heaven Ultimate Gods, and Grand Ultimate Gods. Probably even Undying Saints would not have such overwhelming divine powers!”

Terrifying noises resonated around them.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was also dumbfounded. Never had he imagined Jian Wushuang could suddenly project such vast and incredible divine powers.

His divine powers literally formed an ocean with its infinite and ever-expanding size which repeatedly formed giant waves and violently swept against them.

They did not realize the divine power that was sweeping at them was only 30% of Jian Wushuang’s total divine powers.

As a Perfect Chaotic Creature, Jian Wushuang possessed divine powers that were as vast as the ocean. He had absorbed an entire divine power ocean after all when he broke into Second-Class Divine Demon from Third-Class.

Now that he was a Second-Class Divine Demon, he naturally possessed even more divine powers.

It was exactly due to such that he never had to worry about exhausting his divine powers during fights and was able to ruthlessly use various tactics.

At that moment, he projected 30% of his divine power all in one go.

It was still terrifyingly vast despite being only merely 30%. Under violent impacts of his infinite divine powers, Infernal Heart Prefecture’s Governor, Luo Brothers, and everyone else could not help but stop chasing and withstood the impact while watching Jian Wushuang vanish from their sights.

After a while, the vast divine power ocean which violently swept at them had finally exhausted its momentum. The divine powers that previously filled the air had completely dissolved.

The Governor, Luo Brothers, and the rest of them stood there feeling incredibly embarrassed.

“He escaped even though I’m the one who fought him?” The Governor felt extremely reluctant to concede.

He did not wish to give up on the opportunity to obtain Jian Wushuang’s Heavenly Treasure armor.

On the other hand, Luo Brothers and the rest of them could only quietly shake their heads.

From the recent battles, they could conclude that Jian Wushuang’s battle strength might still be below a Peak Ultimate God’s, but he was most definitely unrivaled among Peak Divine Demons.

Furthermore, his body protective abilities and life-saving skills were really high.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture’s Governor was already the most powerful among Eighteen Prefectures, but even he could only watch Jian Wushuang leave without being able to do anything.

For the remaining 15 prefectures, unless they gathered all their high-level experts together, they would not be able to kill him with only a few prefectures joining hands—even with their Peak Ultimate Gods.

“Let’s go back for now. The prefectures need to discuss and decide on how to deal with the golden-robed kid,” said Luo Shan.

“Aye.” Luo Hai nodded and soon everyone from Blood Light Prefecture had left.

As for Infernal Heart Prefecture’s Governor, there was nothing he could do despite feeling reluctant to concede as Jian Wushuang had already left. He could only return and plan for his next steps.

Experts from other prefectures immediately fell silent when they found out that even the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor could not even injure or force Jian Wushuang to stay.

However, they soon began their plans on dealing with Jian Wushuang again.

Of course, their plans were based on the hypothesis that Jian Wushuang would still stay within the Central Region and continued messing with them.

However, Jian Wushuang had immediately left the Central Region where those Eighteen Prefectures gathered after his battle with the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor.
