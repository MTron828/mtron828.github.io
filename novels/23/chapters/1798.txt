Chapter 1799:

Frightening Abilities

“Kill me? With just a mere Sir God like you?” Jian Wushuang looked at Dao Yuanzi with cold eyes.

“Sir God? Haha, the era that I was in did not have anything like Sir Gods. Instead, we only had the Pure Sun Realm and Chaotic Realm. As for my current realm, it is the Chaotic Realm,” Dao Yuanzi laughed. “Perhaps the Chaotic Realm is similar to the Sir God Realm that you mentioned. However, even in similar realms, let me tell you how big the gap between the Chaotic Realm and a Sir God is.”

As soon as his words left his mouth, Dao Yuanzi shook slightly. After that, his body disappeared from the void.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave and he spread his Soul Power completely. However, he was totally unable to find any traces of Dao Yuanzi.

It was as though Dao Yuanzi had completely disappeared from the universe.

As Jian Wushuang was looking for him with a frown, the void behind him broke open abruptly. After that, a stalwart figure came out from it and an old palm headed toward Jian Wushuang’s throat with an infinite amount of people. As the palm headed to Jian Wushuang, the sounds of the wind that it generated caused Jian Wushuang’s heart to skip a beat.

“Behind you!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Jian Wushuang reacted immediately. As his eyes turned grave, countless tentacles which could blot out the sky and cover the earth came out from behind his back at once and headed to the other party.

However, the moment the tentacles touched Dao Yuanzi’s palm, many of them were smashed into pieces as though they were dry weeds and rotten wood that could be crushed and smashed easily respectively. After that, Dao Yuanzi clenched his fist abruptly.

With that, the space broke apart completely and space cracks which stretched across more than a hundred thousand miles started to spread like a spiderweb.

“Gosh!!”

“Retreat quickly!!”

“It’s too frightening.”

A large number of experts from the Green Fire Palace retreated hastily at once. All of their eyes were also filled with fear and shock.

To them, the power that Dao Yuanzi had unleashed by clenching his fist was enough to kill all of them.

However, fortunately, Jian Wushuang had retreated to one side a long time ago and this big hand did not touch him at all.

However, all of a sudden, the big hand which was clenched tightly into a fist loosened up fiercely.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Five shrill flittering lights were shot out from the five fingers of the big hand. They then pierced the void instantly and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave and the Blood Mountain Sword behind him left its scabbard at once.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, First Move!”

Swish!

The sword light which contained a great amount of Reincarnation Power whistled and tore the void into pieces. At the same time, it repelled the five flittering lights which had been shot over.

“Oh?” Dao Yuanzi raised his eyebrows and glanced at Jian Wushuang with surprise, “Not bad. You are merely someone in the Pure Sun Realm. However, in terms of the power of your Divine Power, it is able to rival that of a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. Even I am unable to compete against such a kind of power now. However, it’s a pity that it’s useless.”

Dao Yuanzi laughed nonchalantly. While standing at his original position, he swung his palm toward Jian Wushuang again.

In no time, Jian Wushuang felt as if the spacetime around him were completely sealed off and his body was under great obstructions and attacks.

Such a feeling was similar to that of the Moon Picking Skill, the strongest Secret Skill of the Ancient God that he could unleash. However, the only difference was that it was his opponent who had unleashed such a kind of move to attack him.

Rumble~~~ The void was suppressed to the point that it broke into pieces. A giant hand then appeared out of thin air and grabbed Jian Wushuang’s body. With that, an enormous amount of power burst forth as if it wanted to crush Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang gave a cold snort and the Ancient God Power in his body emerged hastily. At that moment, his body expanded abruptly.

With his crazy Divine Power, the big hand which grabbed Jian Wushuang tightly also started to shake madly.

“Scram!”

With a furious cry, Jian Wushuang finally struggled free of the big hand. Moreover, the current him had already turned into a dark golden Ancient God that was a hundred feet tall. There were also six stars in the space between his eyebrows and he was filled with murderous intent.

“An Ancient God?” Haha, it is merely some rare bloodline of the Ancient Clan,” Dao Yuanzi laughed disdainfully.

Fifty thousand years ago, during that shocking battle in Tang of the East, his Crimson God Clone had fought with King Gu Tong, who was also seriously injured and was in a weak state.

Back then, he could tell that the Ancient God’s techniques were nothing much. Moreover, he was unwilling to expose the background of his real body and himself. As such, he had pretended to look extremely fearful of a Seven-star Ancient God. However, in actual fact, he did not care about a mere Seven-star Ancient God at all.

“Die!”

A strict cry resounded in the horizon and a giant finger which looked as though it came from the past descended.

The finger contained a tremendous amount of Ancient God Power and it was the Ancient God’s Sixth Finger, the Sun Corrosion Finger, which Jian Wushuang had unleashed with his full power!

“Break!”

Dao Yuanzi merely uttered one word and with a random swing of his big hand, Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God’s Sixth Finger was dissipated immediately.

“How is this possible?” Jian Wushuang was extremely terrified.

It should be known that he had already achieved Stage Three Ultimate Real God. Hence, his Divine Power and body were at the level of an Emperor God. In other words, they were at the level of Middle Stage Chaotic Realm which Dao Yuanzi had mentioned.

As for Dao Yuanzi, he was currently at the level of a Sir God (Early Stage Chaotic Realm). Hence, their powers were one level apart from one another. However, Dao Yuanzi had actually dispelled the attack that he had unleashed easily? On the contrary, Jian Wushuang found it very difficult to deal with the moves that Dao Yuanzi unleashed.

“Jian Wushuang, I have already said that you have returned too late,” Dao Yuanzi sneered, “If I had still not regained the abilities of the Chaotic Realm and I were still in the Pure Sun Realm, you might still be able to kill me with your abilities. However, now, you had better accept your death obediently.”

“Hmph!” Jian Wushuang had never talked even once and he only gave a cold snort. After that, two brilliant rays of golden light beside him were shot out abruptly.

The two rays of golden light were unusually fast. With one on the left and one on the right, they had already appeared in front of Dao Yuanzi.

“This is… the Hong Jun Golden Sword?” Dao Yuanzi revealed a surprised expression. However, he shook his head after that, “They are merely imitations of the Hong Jun Golden Swords. Moreover, you are only able to control two of them. Hence, what use is there?”

Dao Yuanzi laughed with contempt and two shrill lights burst forth from his fingertips. In an instant, the two Hong Jun Golden Swords were sent flying for thousands of miles.

“I shall stop playing with you.”

Dao Yuanzi lost his patience and a powerful power gathered slowly in his hands at once. After that, his finger pointed toward Jian Wushuang’s position.

When the finger was pointed out, the universe was destroyed.

Jian Wushuang could see clearly that a pitch-black lustre was heading toward his chest.

The power that the pitch-black lustre contained had caused even Jian Wushuang to be terrified.

“Ancient God’s Unique Skill, Eight Divine Mountains!”

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

All of a sudden, eight lofty, golden divine mountains descended and they became eight obstacles which stood in front of Jian Wushuang.

However, the pitch-black lustre pierced through the eight divine mountains as easily as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. After that, it struck Jian Wushuang’s body.

Jian Wushuang’s body retreated tens of thousands of miles at once and it was only after a long time that he regained his posture. Moreover, there was a clear white spot on his chest.
