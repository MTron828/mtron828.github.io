Chapter 2852: Little Phoenix

——

“Bastard! In order to gain a good impression of the current Little Phoenix, he actually wants me to personally refine a treasure for him. The young master of the Tian Qu realm lord, what great ability!” Mo Tao’s voice was obviously filled with anger, at the same time, he also blamed Bi Yan, “You too, you actually let that Young Master Qu hear about the matter of Sword One paying a visit.”

Bi Yan immediately lowered his head, not daring to look into Mo Tao’s eyes. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Brother Mo, Young Master Qu only heard about my visit, but in a place like fire cloud castle, people come to visit every day. I’m only an advanced divine master, so he wouldn’t think about it. Even if he did, he wouldn’t be sure and wouldn’t bring me too much trouble,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He spoke casually, but Bi Yan was shocked when she heard what he said.

“Brother Mo?”

“He, he actually called Master brother Mo? And master clearly doesn’t have any dissatisfaction?”

Bi Yan’s face was filled with disbelief.

He knew his master’s identity. Even if the other party was an Immortal Saint, he would not be able to address his master so intimately.

However, Sword One had only asked his master to refine a divine weapon, yet his master’s attitude had changed so drastically.

Furthermore, in order not to let others know of Sword One’s existence, he had directly executed a guard and had Fan Xin enter seclusion for ten thousand years… it was very obvious that Sword One’s status was in his master’s heart had reached an extremely high level.

“I hope that Master Qu doesn’t think too much about it, or else…” Mo Tao’s face darkened slightly, and then he glanced at Bi Yan, “Take Sword One and leave the underground palace immediately. Don’t let anyone know. As for the other matters, leave them to me.”

“Yes.” Bi Yan nodded respectfully.

“Sword One, leave with him first. When the time is right, I will personally send a message to you,” Mo Tao said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang smiled and then followed Bi Yan.

Fire Cloud Castle was located in a huge group of volcanoes, and many places led to the underground of the volcanoes.

Deep underground, there was an extremely hidden underground palace, which could directly lead to the outside world. Mo Tao and Bi Yan were the only two people in Fire Cloud Castle who knew about the existence of this underground palace.

Now Bi Yan was leading Jian Wushuang in this underground palace.

“Mr. Sword One, it’s thanks to you to excuse me in front of master just now. Otherwise, if my master was angry, he would have punished me,” Bi Yan said humbly.

Before, although Bi Yan did not dare to underestimate Jian Wushuang, he was not so humble.

But now, when he heard Jian Wushuang call his master brother Mo, his attitude toward Jian Wushuang had completely changed.

He became very warm and even respectful.

“It’s just a small matter. Mr. Bi Yan, don’t take it to heart.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “By the way, I just heard from you that in 16 years, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion will open the Dragon-phoenix list for the young Phoenix? What’s going on?”

“This matter has been widely spread in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. How could you not know about it, Mr. Sword One?” Bi Yan looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“To tell you the truth, I just came to the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, so I don’t know much about it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“No wonder.” Bi Yan understood and then explained, “This matter has to start with the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is one of the four pavilions in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. It has a deep foundation and is recognized as the cradle of geniuses in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Those who can enter the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and become its disciples are all dragons and phoenixes among men. It’s true.”

“Among the genius disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the male disciple with the highest talent is called the hidden dragon, and the female disciple with the highest talent is called the Young Phoenix. There are many geniuses in this generation of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Hidden dragon Chen Hao has reached the limit of the supreme divinity with outstanding talent. He is an Invincible Divine Master who is extremely powerful. He is widely recognized as the number one supreme Divine Master of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. His strength is almost as powerful as the Immortal Saint.

“Chen Hao is strong, but in terms of talent, the number one genius in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the Golden Crow Nine Realms is the Young Phoenix. She is known as the number one genius in the history of the Golden Crow Nine Realms!”

“The number one genius in the history of the Golden Crow Nine Realms? This Young Phoenix is so powerful?” Jian Wushuang was secretly surprised.

Back in the Sacred Sun World, he had heard that there was a super genius in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Even when he rose to prominence, there were people in the sacred sun world who compared him to that super genius. In the end, many people thought that the super genius was still better than him, this super-genius must be very amazing.

And this super-genius was, as expected, this Young Phoenix.

“This Young Phoenix is indeed very talented. I heard that she has been cultivating for less than 200 years, but her cultivation has already stabilized to the peak of Divine Master. She is even on the verge of breaking through to Great Divine Master. The most important thing is her comprehension of the rules. Her comprehension of the rules is too fast. She is only a divine master, but it is said that her comprehension of the rules has already surpassed that of an ordinary Immortal Saint,” Bi Yan said.

“What?”

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked to hear this.

“A Divine Master’s comprehension of the rules has surpassed that of the Immortal Saint? How is this possible?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

His current realm was that of a Divine Master, and his talent was impeccable. He also had a treasure like a seal of Heaven Scroll, but his comprehension of the rules was only at the limit of a Divine Master, he was still one step away from the Immortal Saint.

The Young Phoenix from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had a higher comprehension of the rules than him.

The Young Phoenix had also cultivated for a very short time, less than 200 years, which was not much longer than him.

“How can her comprehension of the rules be so high?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked.

“I don’t know, but there is a rumor that the Young Phoenix has an extremely special physique, which is unique and far beyond the ordinary people.”

“For an ordinary cultivator, it is extremely difficult to comprehend the rules, but for her, it is as easy as eating and drinking. She doesn’t need to cultivate carefully. She just stands there, and her comprehension of the rules is constantly improving. That’s why her comprehension of the rules is so strong,” Bi Yan said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

He would never believe that an ordinary cultivator could reach such a level in less than 200 years unless he was also reincarnated.

But if he had a unique physique, it would be another story.
