Chapter 3720: Jian Wushuang and the Blood Saber Emperor

Just as the Divine Master Tian Hen had said, his good friend soon arrived.

He wore blood-red hair and a blood-red robe, and carried a blood-red demonic saber on his back. He looked very young. When he arrived in the void, he immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Saber Emperor, so it’s him?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He already knew why the other party was looking for him.

Jian Wushuang also knew about Blood Saber Emperor.

Before he rose to power and was recognized as the strongest Principles Master among the experts in this star field, the strongest Principles Master in this star field was Blood Saber Emperor.

Blood Saber Emperor’s battle strength was very terrifying. He had defeated three experts of the pinnacle of the six realm by himself, and that was many years ago.

Over the past hundreds of thousands of years, the Blood Saber Emperor rarely fought. No one knew how strong he had become, but he was definitely stronger than before.

In addition, the Blood Saber Emperor’s saber technique was very famous in this star field.

“Blood Sword Master, nice to meet you.” The Blood Saber Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang and greeted him politely at the beginning.

“Blood Saber Emperor, I’ve heard a lot about you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I asked Tian Hen to come out and ask you to wait for me here,” Blood Saber Emperor said.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “If I’m not wrong, you want to see me so badly. You must want to fight me, right?”

“Yes.” Blood Saber Emperor did not try to hide anything. “I saw the mirror image of you fighting with Blood Saber Emperor and the other five experts at the pinnacle of the sixth realm. You are indeed very strong. Even I don’t have much confidence in fighting you. I also know that you haven’t cultivated for a long time. It has been more than 10,000 years since the battle, so you should be stronger.”

“Although I know that your strength is above mine, I still want to fight you face to face.”

The Blood Saber Emperor licked his lips, his eyes filled with the desire to fight.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

It was normal for him to want to fight even though he knew that his opponent was stronger than him.

Many people in the world were like this. Even Jian Wushuang, when he met an expert of the same level who was stronger than him, knew that he was not his opponent, but he still wanted to fight him.

“Should we fight now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course. It’s not easy to meet you in the Red Cloud World. It’s a rare opportunity. Of course, we have to seize it,” Blood Saber Emperor said.

“Then you should fight,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

Blood Saber Emperor narrowed his eyes and felt a little dissatisfied.

Although he had admitted that Jian Wushuang was stronger than him, he was not that strong. He had given Jian Wushuang enough respect, but it seemed that Jian Wushuang did not care about him at all, of course, the Blood Saber Emperor was displeased.

“In that case, be careful.”

The Blood Saber Emperor did not hesitate about Jian Wushuang’s behavior. Instead, he chose to fight and speak with strength.

Clang!

A cold light flashed, and the blood-red charming saber behind Blood Saber Emperor was unsheathed. It was not only extremely cold, but also extremely powerful.

It was a supreme supreme treasure saber.

“Blood Sword Master, draw your sword,” Blood Saber Emperor shouted in a low voice.

“I don’t need it for the time being.” Jian Wushuang shook his head slightly.

“Arrogant!” Blood Saber Emperor was immediately furious. A surge of majestic divine power burst out, and he held the saber with both hands at the same time.

Whoosh!

The saber slashed out, and in an instant, a mighty blood-red saber light swept out.

The saber light was extremely dazzling and spread out in the void like a dazzling blood-red saber river.

In the blood-red saber river, there was a suffocating and cold aura.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. The moment the blood-red saber river swept in front of him, he raised his hand and casually pointed at the void in front of him.

It seemed to be an easy task, but a stream of sword essence immediately gathered in front of him.

The sword essence spread out like a blooming lotus.

Buzz!

Under the impact of the sword essence, the blood-red saber river instantly collapsed. Countless divine power frantically swept out in the surroundings, creating a great disturbance in the world.

“It’s so easy to break my saber skill?”

Blood Saber Emperor was shocked.

Although that saber skill was not his strongest, it was still one of the top three saber skills he had created. In addition, he had used all his strength to burst out his own power to the maximum.

After all, Blood Saber Emperor was a special life form.

After a special life form reached the peak of the six realms, the divine power it released was far more powerful than that of an ordinary Principles Master. It was not much weaker than a Ruler.

Even so, Jian Wushuang still easily broke his saber technique.

“Blood Sword Master, it seems that I’ve underestimated you. Not only do you have a better understanding of sword principle than an ordinary Principles Master, but you’re also not much weaker than me in terms of divine power,” Blood Saber Emperor said seriously.

“Blood Saber Emperor, you’d better use your strongest skills and saber techniques, or you won’t stand a chance,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“As you wish.” Blood Saber Emperor did not waste any time. Layers of divine power surged out from his body, and an extremely powerful divine power aura that far surpassed that of a Principles Master burst out from his body.

Blood Saber Emperor was a special life form, so his divine power was extremely powerful.

Now, he had performed an extremely powerful secret skill that could increase his divine power in a short period of time. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He had spent a lot of effort and money to obtain this secret skill in the deepest part of Crimson Stone Mountain. It was enough to allow his strength to reach a whole new level in a short period of time.

With this secret skill and his special physique, he even dared to confront a Ruler Realm expert head-on for a certain period of time.

“Humph!”

With a cold snort, the air beneath the feet of the Blood Saber Emperor exploded.

His figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang as if he had teleported. The blood-red demonic saber in his hand flashed continuously like a real demonic charm.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The extremely cold saber light was incredibly fast as it slashed toward Jian Wushuang in all directions.

An overwhelming pressure also pressed toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was still very relaxed in the face of this overwhelming attack. He put one hand behind his back and casually used the other hand as a sword.

Each sword seemed very casual, but there was a trace of the universe origin of sword principle in his swordsmanship, which clashed with the saber light of the Blood Saber Emperor.
