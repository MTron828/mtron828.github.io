Chapter 649: Cultivation Age

“Bastard!”

Qianqiu Wuhen could not help cursing to himself.

Actually, he could have broken into the Divine Realm several hundred years ago. However, in order to impress others with the feeling that his power was high above his realm, he had intentionally avoided breaking through.

He had never thought that he would be swallowed up among many other geniuses.

Bad luck had caught him in succession. First, he had been overpowered by Gong Chao and Jian Wushuang; then, Jing Xianzi, out of nowhere, had come to defeat him; and now, when he finally could have been ranked top three, the fourth round frustrated him again.

The test pushed him into the situation where he could not hide his secret anymore.

“I had thought he was a genius of extraordinary talent, but now I’ve learned it’s just because he has cultivated much longer than the others. He doesn’t deserve to be our inner disciple. Go tell him that we’ll revoke our previous invitation, and to show our mercy, we can take him as an outer disciple.” A black-haired elder from Cloud Sea Asgard ordered his men.

The middle-aged man from the Immortal Dynasty and the girl from the Boundless Demon Sect gave out a similar order as well.

“Next up, Feng!”

When Feng’s name was called, all the geniuses on the Drill Ground looked at him with interest.

He was the first one from the Ancient World to take the test.

“You’ve cultivated for over 1,900 years, and for about 1,800 of them, you’ve been in the Skyscraping Realm.”

Feng forced a bitter smile at the results, while the other geniuses could not help sighing.

So far, the longest cultivation time for the Eternal World geniuses was 810 years, far shorter than 1,900 years.

“Xuan Yi, is he the trash that you thought so highly of? He is a good-for-nothing,” said the elder from Cloud Sea Asgard coldly.

“I don’t think so.” Xuan Yi gave him an easy smile. “We all know that the conditions in the Ancient World are quite disadvantageous to those cultivators, so I think he’s done well to have made it so far. Besides, you also heard that he’s been in the Skyscraping Realm for the remaining 1,800 years, which means it has only taken him 100 years to reach that realm. He indeed has got some talent.”

“Whatever, that’s no excuse for his poor results.” The elder did not change his mind.

Xuan Yi shrugged with no desire to argue with him further.

The test continued on. Huo Ying, Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang followed Feng in taking their turns.

Among those four, the latter three all had cultivated for more than 2,000 years, and Wu Huang had even cultivated longer than 2,800 years!

As for Huo Ying, who had the longest among the rest of them, his cultivation life was an amazing 3,700 years. That number caused the other geniuses to cry out in surprise.

“Next is Gong Chao!”

The voice of the host quieted down the whole Drill Ground, as well as the Skyward Pavilion.

Everyone held their breath to see Gong Chao’s result.

They all wanted to know how long this number one genius, the terrifying monster, had cultivated.

If it turned out to be more than 800 years, his fame as the number one genius would be challenged.

But, if it were to be a much shorter time, such as 300 or 400 years, he would be able to protect his fame.

“Gong Chao.”?

Jian Wushuang watched him closely.

This person was the only one among everyone in the Firmament Territory Feast that he took seriously.

From the very beginning, he had been keeping an eye on him.

Under everyone’s gaze, Gong Chao went over to Elder Qiu and gave him a drop of his blood. In no time, the elder announced the result in an astonished voice.

“You’ve cultivated for less than 120 years and reached the Skyscraping Realm only 50 years ago.”

A commotion began on the Drill Ground the very moment that those words were uttered.

“Less than 120 years? Unbelievable!”

Jing Xianzi was frozen for a moment. Although her cultivation life of 210 years was shorter than that of many others, Gong Chao’s was nearly half of hers.

In the Skyward Pavilion, the experts from every sect were thrilled at Gong Chao’s results. They praised him in amazement.

“Genius, exceptional genius!”

“I thought that he should have cultivated for over 400 years, but it turns out that it’s so much shorter. 120 years!”

“It’s amazing that he could make it so far in a short 120 years.”

Right then, Gong Chao heard his name echo throughout the place from the room on the top floor of the Skyward Pavilion.

“I’m the Ninth Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard, Shi Qianhan.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The voice continued, “You’re so gifted that I want to invite you to be our disciple. All our resources for cultivation will be open to you, and I’ll help you earn personal guidance from our master. As long as you try hard, I ensure you that you can reach the Eternal Realm in 10,000 years.

“Are you willing to accept my invitation?”

Those words startled all the geniuses present.

They could not believe that the Ninth Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard had wanted to recruit Gong Chao with such attractive conditions.

Personal guidance from a super Dao Master?

This was something that many experts would pursue their entire lifetime.

In addition to that, there was the promising future of reaching the Eternal Realm in 10,000 years waiting for Gong Chao.

Those conditions gave such a thrill to the geniuses, even though they were not for them.

As Gong Chao was considering it, more invitations from the other sects began to come his way.
