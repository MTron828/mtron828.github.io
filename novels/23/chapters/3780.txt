Chapter 3781: One Possibility?

“The Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s attack completely ignored my soul power and directly affected my consciousness. My consciousness was in pain and I couldn’t control my divine body temporarily, but my soul was fine.” Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth.

He did not care about ordinary attacks on his consciousness.

After all, he had to go through his soul first. As a perfect life-form, he was invincible in the soul aspect.

However, his soul could not block the attack of the Three-Eyed Demon Woman. He could only rely on his own consciousness to endure it.

If his consciousness could not block it, he could not do anything against the Stone Man and the Snow-White Ape-Man.

“Haha, he actually used his divine body to block the stone’s attacks. It seems that his divine power is not consumed too much. A little Principles Master really has some ability.” The Three-Eyed Demon Woman laughed strangely, then she glanced at the 300-meter-tall Stone Man and said, “Stone, go on. Don’t show mercy. He won’t die in the consciousness space anyway.”

“Okay.”

The 300-meter-tall Stone Man nodded silently. Then he raised another giant stone and smashed it at Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

The stone pierced through the void like a meteor, and the terrifying wind tore the void apart.

The moment the Stone Man attacked, the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s third eye shone with a dazzling purple light again.

“Again?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened and he immediately closed his eyes.

He thought that the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s technique was transmitted by the purple light in her eyes. As long as he closed his eyes and did not see the purple light, he would not be affected by the purple light. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

......

In fact, after the purple light lit up, whether Jian Wushuang saw it or not, it would shine on his body at once.

Then, the same thing happened. Jian Wushuang felt a sharp pain in his consciousness and temporarily lost control of his divine body. He squatted there again.

Then, the meteor-like giant rock came crashing down fiercely.

Behind the giant rock, Snowflakes fluttered in the sky, and the Snow-White Ape-Man’s fist also came smashing toward Jian Wushuang.

Bang! Bang!

Jian Wushuang could not withstand the terrifying attacks of two Superior Rulers at the same time. His divine body was seriously injured again, and blood gushed out of his mouth, dyeing his armor red.

“Master, the three-eyed Demon’s special attack is very strange. Whether you see it with your eyes or not, you will be hit. There is only one way to defend against such a method, and that is to rely on your absolute strong consciousness. Your consciousness obviously can’t defend against the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s attack,” Devil Flame’s voice sounded again.

“No, I can’t.” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

His consciousness was actually very strong.

After all, he had lived two lives and had experienced countless life-and-death situations. He could completely ignore ordinary consciousness attacks.

However, the Three-Eyed Demon Woman was extremely powerful. Even if she was not a Supreme Being, she was probably a terrifying Ruler in the fourth or fifth level.

Even though she was the gatekeeper of Heaven-Treading Mountain in the Red Cloud World, she could still affect ordinary Superior Rulers with her consciousness attack, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness was strong, but it was still slightly inferior to that of a Superior Ruler.

Therefore, he could not block it.

“If I can’t block the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s consciousness attack, then I’ll be a living target. I won’t be able to move even if I want to, let alone use any techniques. If this continues, it won’t be long before I run out of divine power after a dozen attacks. Then I’ll be defeated.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and he asked, “Devil Flame, does your Gold-Devouring divine body have some effect on your consciousness?”

“Yes.” Devil Flame nodded.

“Although my Gold-Devouring divine body is only in the molding stage, it can greatly improve your strength and consciousness. However, it won’t last long. Master, even if you summon your Gold-Devouring divine body and use it to resist the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s consciousness attack, you can’t defeat these three people. You won’t be able to pass this test.”

Although Devil Flame was in the Blood-Red Gourd, he could see that the three people in front of him were all Superior Rulers. Jian Wushuang had no advantage against any of them. One against three…even if he could block the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s consciousness attack, he would still be completely suppressed by these three people.

As for defeating these three people, it was impossible. At least, Jian Wushuang could not do it now.

Hearing Devil Flame’s words, Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, “No, as long as I can block the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s consciousness attack, even if I still can’t defeat the three of them, I might be able to pass this test.”

“Huh?” Devil Flame was stunned.

“If I remember correctly, the Snow-White Ape-Man told the Three-Eyed Demon Woman and the Stone Man that they don’t have much time.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

.

Previously, when he fought with the ape-man one-on-one, the Three-Eyed Demon Woman and the Stone Man were watching the show. The Three-Eyed Demon Woman even mocked the ape-man.

This made the ape-man furious. Later, he told them to attack immediately, saying that they did not have much time.

The ape-man might have said something unintentionally. Ordinary people would not care about it, but Jian Wushuang heard it and paid attention to it.

Not only that, but Jian Wushuang had also made a lot of guesses.

“Yes, the tests at the foot of the mountain and the mountainside all require me to defeat the gatekeepers face to face, but the tests at the peak are obviously different.

“There are three gatekeepers at the peak, and the three gatekeepers…one is extremely fast, the other is extremely powerful, and the last one is a three-eyed demon clansman with unique consciousness attacks. All three of them have the battle strength of a Superior Ruler. If they work together, even a Ruler at the top of the first level would not be able to defeat them face to face.

“As for me, I’m just a Principles Master. It would be incredible if I had to defeat all three of them.”

“And the Snow-White Ape-Man, he said that they didn’t have enough time. In other words, the test on the peak might not be for me to defeat all three gatekeepers, but for me to hold on for a certain amount of time and not be killed by them…”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a strange light.

The more he thought about it, the more he felt that the possibility was greater.
