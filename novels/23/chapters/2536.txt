Chapter 2537: Three Consecutive Wins

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He fearfully looked at Jian Wushuang before immediately bowing and respectfully said, “Thank you for holding back.”

Jian Wushuang retracted his sword and did not say anything more.

Mo Xing immediately exited the battlefield.

Around the arena, the more than a hundred thousand audiences were dumbfounded by the spectacle.

An uproar like a surging tsunami followed suit after the audiences’ momentary shock.

“It’s a win! Jian Yi wins the first Blood Gladiator Challenge!”

“Winning is for sure, but I didn’t foresee him winning so easily. If he didn’t hold back on the last hit, Mo Xing will probably be dead by now.”

“Amazing. This Jian Yi is truly amazing!”

Countless audiences were maniacally cheering for Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang looked extremely calm while standing on the battlefield and waiting for his second opponent.

In the delicate room at the gladiatorial arena’s inner layer, the elegant lady was scrutinizing every detail of the battle.

“This Jian Yi is fast and knows how to leave behind an apparition. He has made a breakthrough to the Space-time Law First Stage. In addition, his sword skills are extraordinary.” The elegant lady squinted. “It’s a shame that Mo Xing is too weak as he hasn’t even reached Primary-Level Ultimate God, hence he couldn’t force Jian Yi to show more of his abilities and tactics. For his next opponent, get him someone a little stronger who is at least peak of Primary-Level Ultimate God.”

“Aye.” The black-robed old man nodded respectfully and went off to make the arrangements.

Jian Wushuang’s second Blood Gladiator Challenge soon began.

His second opponent was a short and skinny old man who seemed very weak, but his abilities were extraordinary and definitely at the peak of Primary-Level Ultimate God.

It was unlucky for him that his opponent was Jian Wushuang.

In that battle, Jian Wushuang again quite easily defeated his opponent by simultaneously forming three apparitions accompanied by his sword technique.

Jian Wushuang’s third opponent was a red-haired young woman.

The young woman’s weapon was a long whip and had reached the first stage in two laws alongside her extremely outstanding whip skills and secret techniques. Her general abilities were even a little stronger than Xiao Tiexin in Jian Wushuang’s opinion.

Xiao Tiexin was someone who could simultaneously withstand three Ultimate Gods and still held the upper hand.

Hence, this red-haired young woman’s ability was unimaginable, and enjoyed great fame not only within the Gladiatorial Arena but also the entire Northern Darkstar Continent.

In order not to reveal too much of his true abilities, Jian Wushuang did not unleash secret techniques in his battle, hidden his true understanding of Space-time Law, and suppressed his sword skills. As such, he needed to spend some effort before defeating the red-haired young woman.

Jian Wushuang won three consecutive battles!

The entire arena was already boiling.

In the delicate room, the elegant lady remained seated but her expressions showed a faint coldness.

“Hong Ying is considered extremely strong among the Primary-Level Ultimate Gods. She could still fight a good fight when facing regular High-Level Ultimate Gods but had also lost to him. It also seems like he’s still holding back his true strength.” The elegant lady slightly squinted.

In the Blood Gladiators challenge, one had to fight five challenges and Jian Wushuang had already won three of them.

Only two battles were remaining.

“Get Tu Ying,” instructed the elegant lady.

“Aye.” The black-robed old man nodded and immediately exited.

The black-robed old man soon brought in a devilish-looking black-robed young man and stood before the elegant lady.

“Tu Ying, did you see the previous battles just now?” The elegant lady looked below at him.

“Not for the first two games, but I saw his battle with Hong Ying. This Jian Yi is truly capable. Based on what he has displayed, I see that he’s no weaker than me, plus I get a feeling that he’s still holding out on us. I probably only have a forty percent winning chance in a head-on fight against him,” said the black-robed devilish man called Tu Ying.

“Forty percent, huh?” The elegant lady’s eyes turned frosty. “What about killing him?”

“If you want me to kill him, I have a seventy percent confidence,” said Tu Ying.

Their conversation would sound strange if others heard it.

How could he have a 70% chance of killing Jian Wushuang while only having a 40% chance to win him in a head-on fight?

“You will take the next battle then, but remember that I don’t want you to defeat him. I want you to kill him off.” The elegant lady’s voice was cold. “He has already won three of the five Blood Gladiator Challenges. It’s time to finish it now while the crowd’s emotions are still rather high.”

“Understood.” Tu Ying smiled devilishly before turning around and left.

Not long after, Tu Ying appeared in the battlefield’s central area.

He came before Jian Wushuang.

The audience immediately recognized him as soon as he appeared.

“It’s Sir Tu Ying!”

“Is Sir Tu Ying going to personally fight him?”

“Sir Tu Ying is the most powerful and prized Primary-Level Ultimate God fighter in this gladiatorial arena! I thought he’d only appear in the fifth battle, but now he’s already appearing during the fourth.”

“This Jian Yi is in big troubles.”

The audiences were discussing.

Jian Wushuang looked extremely cold without showing any expressions as he took a glance at Tu Ying.

Tu Ying humbly and respectfully greeted Jian Wushuang, “Jian Yi, yes? I hope to exchange some pointers with you1.”

“Go ahead.” Jian Wushuang did not waste any time.

“Please be careful then.” Tu Ying gave him a friendly warning and vanished into thin air in a flash.

Whoosh!

A ghastly figure appeared next to Jian Wushuang along with layers of blade shadows concurrently formed from the cold battle blade headed directly toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang remained still, but his Blood Mountain Sword was slightly raised and blocked the battle blade in front of him.

Tang!

The sound of metals clashing was heard as Tu Ying smiled devilishly and with a shattering noise~~~

Stern beams of blade-light exploded.

His continuous swinging created colorful blade-lights which left behind traces of a shiny blade river in the void. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

‘This guy’s blade technique is pretty good.’

Jian Wushuang secretly exclaimed. The Seven Stars Secret Technique within his body was already activated. After that, his violently surging divine power enabled Jian Wushuang to easily block Tu Ying’s blade.

At first glance, Jian Wushuang was only able to passively ward off Tu Ying’s relentless attacks and kept retreating as though he was on the losing side.

Jian Wushuang’s expression remained as calm as ever regardless of Tu Ying’s fierce attacks.

“Is that your full capabilities?” Jian Wushuang looked at Tu Ying.

Tu Ying’s abilities were slightly stronger than the red-haired young woman, Hong Ying who crossed-hands against Jian Wushuang a while ago, but there was still a limit regardless of how strong he was.
