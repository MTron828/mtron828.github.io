Chapter 942: Blood-killing Plate Armor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The soothsayer stopped midair after bursting out of the mountain waste.

He was a complete mess—his face was pale and there was still blood on the corners of his mouth. However, he was not all flustered and his eyes appeared radiant.

“Haha!”

Suddenly, he burst out laughing like a madman.

“Gu Tong, no, I should call you King Gu Tong since you’re an Ancient God of Imperial Kinsmen!” the soothsayer said. “To be honest, I was scared when I saw a Seven-star Imperial God like you!”

“Even at the peak of my strength, I’m no match for you. But obviously you’re not fully recovered or you wouldn’t have appeared in this world. I think you currently only have 10 percent of your usual strength and your battle capability is only at the Five-star level. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have survived your attack earlier.”

The soothsayer was well aware of the terrible power of the Seven-star Imperial God.

It would take a Seven-star Imperial God at its peak a measly finger to kill him. However, Gu Tong was evidently far from it.

“I can easily kill you with only 10 percent of my strength,” Gu Tong retorted in a cold but majestic voice.

“Really?” the soothsayer replied coolly with a smile. He then waved his hand in the air.

“Buzz!” A stream of black air current burst out of the depths of the palace that had been razed to the ground. It was accompanied by a stench that rose from the ground and gradually grew stronger. Then, out of the blue, a bloody Flowing Light rose from the bottom of the palace and flew toward the soothsayer.

Soon, this bloody Flowing Light was in the soothsayer’s hands. It appeared to be a scarlet armor.

The size of the armor was similar to the Blood-eagle Armor that Jian Wushuang once obtained but its aura was much more powerful and contained an intense Killing Intent that would scare even a Dao Master.

“Blood-killing Armor?”

Gu Tong stared at the scarlet armor in surprise.

He could recognize the scarlet armor. It was a special treasure that was valuable and powerful beyond measure.

“Hehe! You’re a Seven-star Imperial God indeed. You really know a lot. But this isn’t the Blood-killing Armor. It’s actually called the Blood-killing Plate Armor.”Still wearing a cold smile, the soothsayer put on the scarlet armor.

His aura immediately skyrocketed with a potent Killing Intent.

“I’ve been pouring a copious amount of Luck into it day and night all these years and it’s now fully repaired.”

The soothsayer gave Gu Tong a chilly look. “King Gu Tong, our previous collision doesn’t count. Let’s find out who’s the winner now.”

Gu Tong said nothing but his expression changed and there was a Thunderbolt flashing inside his dark golden pupils. With a sudden expansion of his body, he then slammed into the soothsayer.

“Hehe!”

The soothsayer cackled. With magic clouds bursting out of his slender body, he began growing at an alarming rate until he was hundreds of feet tall. While he was not as large as Gu Tong, they were quite a match.

“Come on! Come on!” The soothsayer was excited.

The two of them collided in the next moment.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Terrifying explosions echoed in the sky.

The soothsayer had been a lot weaker than Gu Tong in their earlier collision and had been completely crushed. Now equipped with the Blood-killing Plate Armor, he was almost evenly matched with Gu Tong. In fact, he was even in the position to put up an aggressive fight.

Their fierce battle caused powerful aftermath that caused the nearby Dao Masters and experts to retreat further.

Even Emperor Leng, Emperor Xiao, and Emperor Yun, who had just got out of the pit, had to back away.

Not even the three of them had the room to intervene in a battle of such a magnitude.

Moreover, they had their own opponents to worry about.

“Bitch, hurry up and surrender!” Despite his pale face, Emperor Xiao managed to produce an earth-shattering bellow.

“Damn it.”?Emperor Leng wore a somber expression as she looked around her.

The fact that her camp had been on the losing side forced her to get the National Master’s help. However, they ended up having to fend for themselves anyway after the terrifying Ancient God of the Imperial Kinsmen made a sudden appearance and kept the National Master busy.

Both Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun were now ready to fight again. On the other side of the battlefield, Xue Lingtian had already defeated and wounded Xia Yu.

This was incredibly bad news for her.

“Xia Tao.”

Emperor Leng’s cold voice drifted to where Xia Tao, the Master of Xia Clan, was fighting hard with Lord of Cercis Island.

Xia Tao immediately turned to look at her in alarm.

“The National Master and I’ve done our best in the battle today, but if you’re holding back and waiting to take advantage of us, then our previous agreement will be null. We’ll leave and hand Tang of the East over to Xiao.” There was a hint of decisiveness in her voice.

She paused before continuing, “Humph! The Xia Clan has survived in Tang of the East since ancient times. You must have many more unfathomable resources than these Dao Masters you dispatched. You have the Immortal Army, don’t you? Don’t you think it’s the time to use it?”

Her words stunned Xia Tao.

The Xia Clan had held immense power in Tang of the East for many years. Even in the kingdom’s most prosperous time, the four emperors had to show some respect to the clan. Naturally, the clan would possess more resources than what they demonstrated in the battle today.

They indeed possessed many trump card and skills, and the best one among them was the Immortal Army!

However, this was a secret known only to a few Xia clansmen. How did Emperor Leng find out about it?

Though still confused, Xia Tao was also desperate to overturn the current situation and thus, immediately agreed.

“Since Emperor Leng has personally made the request, then the Xia Clan will stop hiding it!”

“March, the Immortal Army!”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
