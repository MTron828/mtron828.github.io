Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“There are a great number of experts in the Eternal Chaotic World. Naturally, there would be many mysterious means to improve cultivation as well.”

“One of the methods is to change the speed of time.”

“But only very few great experts can do that. The practitioner must reach the level of the founder of the Stars Clan or of King Luo Zhen. Besides, he needs to have high attainment in time and space. Such a powerful Secret Land isn’t supposed to exist in the Green Fire World,” Gu King said, frowning.

Ever since Gu King parasitized Jian Wushuang’s body, he had encountered countless descendants of the famed bloodlines in the Eternal Chaotic World during the latter’s cultivation journey in the Green Fire World and the Samsara Continent in particular. Though those descendants possessed incredibly weak bloodline, their ancestors had been truly powerful back in the day.

Now, he had even discovered a powerful method of changing time flow. The more time passed, the more he found the Green Fire World to be extraordinary.

“Your father not only has a long lifespan but also has an unusual constitution,” Gu King added.

“His constitution?” Jian Wushuang was startled.

“Your father is an incredible swordsman and is even more talented than you in terms of Sword Principle. Apart from his inborn talent, his constitution also contributes to his fast cultivation speed. If my assumption isn’t wrong, his constitution must belong to the legendary Sword Spirit.”

“Constitution of Sword Spirit? What’s that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well, it’s a long story. I’ll explain later,” Gu King answered.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang agreed for he knew now wasn’t the time for their conversation.

When the experts knew Jian Wushuang was the Supervisor’s son, they understood why he chose to kill Celestial Master Lei Yi instead.

“Celestial Master Dong Ming,” Jian Nantian called, looking at Dong Ming with his cold, deep eyes.

Dong Ming shuddered before raising his head to look at Jian Nantian in fear.

Scared as he was, he was also occupied with other thoughts.

When he heard Jian Wushuang calling the Supervisor father, he finally realized the identity of the indigo-robed man.

Lei Yi had called Jian Wushuang the son of a lowborn man and that lowborn man was none other than Jian Nantian.

“2,000 years ago, the Ancient Demon Clan belittled the father and son and almost killed them. They’ve now become such powerful people.”

“One is Jian Wushuang, and the other is the Supervisor of the Samsara Temple.”

“T-This…”

Dong Ming was too shocked to think more.

“Celestial Master Dong Ming, it has been 2,000 years. How’s the one on the Heaven-ceasing Peak doing?” Jian Nantian asked while looking at Dong Ming.

“Well…” Dong Ming was stunned. He then nodded and said, “Fine! He’s fine!”

Jian Nantian snorted before looking away from Dong Ming. Then, his majestic voice resounded in everyone’s ears.

“Thank you for coming here to celebrate my new role as the Supervisor. Today, I’ve something to announce and hope all of you can be my witnesses.”

The experts present perked up their ears.

“Ninth-Sword Dao Master of the Ancient Demon Clan kidnapped my wife, Ji Wumeng, 2,000 years ago and locked up her on the Heaven-ceasing Peak since.”

“In that time, I’ve become the Reincarnator and almost gotten myself killed countless times. I’ve come here after experiencing all sorts of hardship!”

“I and our child, Jian Wushuang, have become stronger…”

“The time has come!”

“It’s time for us to take revenge on the Ancient Demon Clan!”

“My son and I will break into the Heaven-ceasing Peak in a month to free my wife!”

“Whoever who gets in our way will be… killed!”

His cold voice echoed through the drill ground.

His voice that carried such firm resolution and strong Killing Intent frightened the crowd.

Dong Ming’s face turned deadly pale with fear.

Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang would break into the Heaven-ceasing Peak in a month?

This explosive news triggered heated discussions among the crowd.

Most of them had heard of the Heaven-ceasing Peak in the Ancient Demon Clan. It was a forbidden area where even its clansmen stayed away from out of fear.

It was said that only clansmen who committed flagrant crimes or made the clan suffer great loss would be imprisoned on the Heaven-ceasing Peak.

How did Jian Wushuang’s mother and the Supervisor’s wife, end up being confined in the Heaven-ceasing Peak?

“Break into the Heaven-ceasing Peak? Will they wage an all-out war against the Ancient Demon Clan?”

“On the one hand, we have the Ancient Demon Clan, the leader of the four peak clans in the Samsara Continent. On the other hand, we have two geniuses from the Green Fire World, both of which have acquired the battle strength of a Celestial Master. The Supervisor’s strength is fathomless. What will happen when two huge forces fight each other? Oh, God!”

“Big event! This is going to be the most thrilling event in the Samsara Continent!”

Everyone on the drill ground was swept into an uproar.

“Celestial Master Dong Ming, you’d better relay my words to Heart-withered Celestial Master. He has a month to make a decision,” Jian Nantian said, his eyes sparkling with rage.

Dong Ming trembled as he looked up, giving Jian Nantian a momentary glance. He then made a bow with folded hands, turned around, and left the ceremony with his clansmen and Lei Yi’s body.

He wore a grave expression as he left.

He had come to realize just how serious things had become.

If this matter was handled improperly, their clan would likely suffer heavy casualties or even get slaughtered. He could not help looking so grim. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When the experts from the Ancient Demon Clan left, Jian Nantian waved his hand again. “Today is to celebrate my new role as the Supervisor. Enjoy yourselves!”

Music followed his words and maids and servants came in, bringing in good wine and delicious food and placing them on the table.

The feast must still go on despite the accident.

However, the host of the feast left with Jian Wushuang after announcing his explosive decision.

Inside a grand palace, the father and son sat opposite each other.
