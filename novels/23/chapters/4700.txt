4701 The Broken Stone Bead

The air seemed to freeze for a moment. The tall and thin old man thought for a while and said, “Did you separate the sword body and the sword hilt?”

The awe-inspiring old man also appeared from the Boyang Body and said in a bad mood, “Idiot, can’t you tell that this is a broken sword? Don’t tell me you store ur sword with the hilt and blade separate?”

“But with such a broken sword, it’ll definitely be difficult to break through this evil creature’s life source.” The tall and thin old man frowned.

The old man who appeared after him gave a flying kick and kicked the tall and thin old man who was holding the sword down. “Stop talking nonsense. You can leave now.”

In the crater-like wound, the tall and thin old man was holding the broken Tarot Divine Sword. His muddled attitude had disappeared, and in its place was a reserved, calm, and majestic aura.

Although it was broken, it could not hide the Emperor’s appearance. The Emperor’s clothes fluttered in the wind, and a mighty force spread out, repairing the broken body of the Tarot Divine Sword, and stabbed down with a thousand feet of brilliance.

It directly broke through the head of the giant Sea Sky Octopus and went straight for its origin.

At the same time, the other two Emperors also made their moves. Two long rays of light carrying Emperor’s might merged into one and fell together.

The terrifying power turned into a pillar of light and exploded in the giant Sea Sky Octopus’s head.

Jian Wushuang felt his body relax and he was blown away by the layers of shock waves.

He hurriedly stretched out his hand and clenched it. The rippling force ribbon directly clung firmly to the giant Sea Sky Octopus’s head.

As the tragic explosion shook its head, even such an ultimate giant creature finally wailed and fell into the sea without a sound.

The three Dao unification Emperor’s True Shadow struck out and the extremely huge head began to break apart. All sorts of unknown fragments flew out and a unique force was released but it only lasted for an instant before it disappeared.

Jian Wushuang leaped over and held the Invisible Sword high, then he entered the wound.

He seemed to have entered a primordial space. In the center of the huge Sea Sky Octopus’s head, there was a ball of golden life source that was like a huge sun.

As the sword broke through, billions of rays of auspicious light burst out. The three Emperors all covered their eyes subconsciously.

The auspicious light only appeared for a moment before it dimmed.

Shaking his head, Jian Wushuang looked forward and saw a stone bead that was more than half broken. It was still spinning.

“What is this thing?” The tall and thin old man looked up and asked in confusion, “The auspicious light just now was emitted by this thing?”

“No matter what it is, it must be a treasure to be in this guy’s head.” The awe-inspiring old man took a step forward and observed carefully.

The old man with polycoria pouted. “Look at your ignorant faces. This small stone bead must have been formed by that big guy’s accumulation of energy from heaven and earth. Although it can’t be considered a treasure, it’s extremely beneficial for nourishing the meridians.”

Jian Wushuang did not speak. For some reason, he felt that the broken stone bead was not the life source that the vast Sea Sky Octopus had condensed.

After saying that, he raised his hand and pushed the stone bead to Jian Wushuang, “Although this thing is useless to us, it is still good for you. Take it and warm your meridians.”

Jian Wushuang did not refuse. The stone bead was in his hand, and there was nothing strange about it except that it was a little wet and cold.

The cracks on the stone bead seemed to have been chiseled by some kind of hard object, making it look slightly ugly.

After putting the stone bead back into the Boyang Bottle, Jian Wushuang and the Emperors wandered around the huge Sea Sky Octopus’s head for a while to make sure it was dead before they left.

After this disaster, the entire fleet suffered heavy losses, and only four of the giant ships full of black mountain crystals were left.

Almost all of the Yan Immortals had died, and the survivors were all gathered on the first ship.

As soon as his feet landed on the ground, Jian Wushuang returned to the deck. Everyone subconsciously took half a step back and fear flashed in their eyes.

Chun Qiu rushed over and said in a trembling voice, “Brother Jian, it’s great that you’re fine.”

Jian Wushuang nodded, “I was lucky.”

He turned to look at the less than 50 people on the deck and said in a low voice, “The danger has been eliminated. Please return to your respective ships.”

Hearing this, everyone looked at each other, but no one dared to move.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything more. He jumped to the bow of the ship and began to nurse his meridians.

He was almost forced to the extreme in this battle. The two Ancestral Skills were used at the same time, and more than half of his Yan Li was consumed in an instant. If he did not regulate his breathing quickly, it would be difficult to deal with the next sudden situation.

He turned around and looked at the giant Sea Sky Octopus, which was half-floating and half-sinking on the surface of the sea, and doubts flashed through his heart.

The real fighting power of the giant Sea Sky Octopus was not on the same level as the aura he revealed. He could only defend himself against the attacks of Jian Wushuang and the others.

If it was not for its massive size, any one of the three Emperors would have been able to severely injure it. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Furthermore, there were countless immortal pavilions and jade buildings on top of the giant Sea Sky Octopus’s head. It was very likely that some almighty had used it as a foundation to create a Secret Realm.

Not being able to find a treasure among them had become a great regret in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

After overcoming this disaster, the vast sea that had connected countless worlds returned to its previous deathly silence.

Dozens of days later, the thin man in a purple robe that had been split in half by the giant Sea Sky Octopus slowly woke up. Its waist and abdomen were already intact.

To a Yan Immortal, as long as a part of the Great Dao life source was left, even if his divine body was reduced to dust, he could still be completely restored.

However, this time, the skinny purple-robed man’s origin and true shadow were almost destroyed.

The face under the hood coughed slightly. He got up with the help of the people around him and looked at Jian Wushuang’s back.

Then, he walked in Jian Wushuang’s direction.

When Chun Qiu noticed this, he immediately became alert. Just as he was hesitating whether to wake Jian Wushuang up, a slightly low voice was heard.

“This old man thanks you for what you did that day, and will definitely repay you in the future.”

After he finished speaking, the skinny purple-robed man turned around and left. He was extremely cold.

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes and shook his head helplessly. Then, he closed his eyes and continued to meditate.

Sailing in the huge sea was an extremely dull and boring thing. Apart from the stars in the sky, there were no living things to speak of.

Of course, if another living creature appeared, it would be extremely bad.

After an unknown period of time, Jian Wushuang, who had already entered the state of comprehension, faintly heard the voice of Chun Qiu.

“Brother Jian, look over there, doesn’t that look like a person?”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and looked at the sea area not far away.

He could see a white robe floating on the water’s surface, and because of the speed of the water, it began to approach the giant ship.
