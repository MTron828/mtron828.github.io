Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked when he saw Leng Rushuang turn into three.

“It’s indeed a secret skill taught by supreme fog. It’s really amazing.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

On the battlefield, three Leng Rushuang unleashed their monstrous strength at the same time and attacked Leng Rushuang crazily.

Leng Ruxue was also continuously fighting back, and the fierce battle between the two became even more intense.

However, the longer it dragged on, the more disadvantageous it was for Leng Rushuang. In just a few breaths’ time, Leng Rushuang’s divine power had already been depleted by nearly half, and the golden flames that filled the sky were burning more and more vigorously, Leng Ruxue’s strength within the golden flames was also becoming stronger and stronger.

“Haha, bitch, although I don’t know how your strength improved so much in such a short time, you’re still far from me.” Leng Rushuang’s proud voice resounded in the void, her already extremely powerful aura had actually increased by another level at this moment.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. “After Leng Rushuang activated her body of woe poison, her strength has been continuously increasing. As the battle drags on, her strength will become stronger. I’m afraid Shuang ‘er will be in trouble.”

Leng Rushuang also noticed this.

“Half of her divine power has been consumed. We can’t continue fighting like this. Let’s decide the winner with one move.” Leng Rushuang’s eyes turned cold.

In the center of the battlefield, three figures of Leng Rushuang retreated at the same time. However, as they retreated, the white light behind her became more dazzling and holy.

A superior aura suddenly burst out from the three figures of Leng Rushuang. At the same time, it also spread out with the power of a vast magic formation.

“Magic Formation? A combined attack Magic Formation?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Sure enough, the three Leng Rushuang formed a combined attack magic formation. Vast light rose from the three figures. The three lights converged and finally formed a huge, hazy shadow.

This shadow also looked like a holy woman, but it had eight arms. Each of these eight arms held a long whip.

As the three figures of Leng Rushuang opened their eyes at the same time, a cold and fierce light flashed explosively.

This enormous holy woman’s illusory figure swung out eight arms at the same time.

Rumble…the world began to tremble wildly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Endless might gathered crazily in the void. In the blink of an eye, it actually formed a huge green dragon that was over a hundred thousand feet long. This huge green dragon opened its large mouth and carried an incomparable might, it directly swallowed Leng Ruxue, who was in the middle of the golden ocean below.

“What a joke!”

Leng Ruxue let out a sharp whistle. The colorful poison butterfly behind her also let out an ear-piercing screech. Endless golden flames rose fiercely.

The long spear in Leng Ruxue’s hand also suddenly pierced explosively. In an instant, the power of the entire golden sea of fire completely merged into the long spear. A terrifying might completely erupted at this instant.

The two shocking powers represented the fates of the two of them. At this moment, they finally collided head-on.

Chi chi chi!

There were no terrifying booming sounds that one had imagined. Instead, there was only the sound of large amounts of energy and divine power crazily squeezing against each other.

The entire large battlefield was completely covered by the powerful divine power of the two of them, forming a huge energy storm.

The storm swept in all directions, causing many experts to be terrified.

Although there were only two second-level Rulers fighting on the battlefield, it was clear that their strength could not be measured by the second-level Rulers. Their battle strength was definitely at the third-level, even among the third-level Rulers, they should be extremely powerful.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he stared at the battlefield in front of him. His soul power had been focused on Leng Rushuang. If she was in danger, he would immediately attack her.

However, it was obvious that the collision had not reached that stage yet.

Moreover, he could sense that Leng Rushuang’s aura had not been significantly weakened.

“Did she win?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

As expected, as the energy storm in the center of the battlefield dissipated, the experts on the martial arts practice field fell silent after seeing the scene clearly.

The experts from the Universal Poison Demon Sect, in particular, looked extremely gloomy at this moment.

In the center of the battlefield, two figures were still standing face to face. Although Leng Rushuang was the only one left among the three figures, she was still standing there intact. Although her aura was much weaker than before, however, that was also because she had consumed a large amount of divine power.

On the other hand, Leng Ruxue’s standing figure was clearly trembling slightly. Her hair was also in a mess, and there was blood at the corner of her mouth. The aura on her body was much weaker than before, and she looked extremely miserable.

Just from the looks of the two of them, one could already tell the victor of this battle.

“That witch actually lost?”

“She used all of her strength to activate the woeful poison body and even used the Ten Thousand Poison Scripture. But in the end, she was still defeated and lost to an expert of the same level.”

“The witch actually lost. This is really unexpected.”

Many of the experts watching the battle secretly sighed.

Because they had long regarded Leng Ruxue as the number one genius of the Thunder Star World in recent years. She was even one of the top super geniuses in the entire Purple Micro Galaxy. Such a super genius, within the same level…it was almost impossible to find someone who could defeat her.

But now, he had indeed been defeated by an expert of the same level.

There was no room for trickery. The other party’s strength was indeed stronger than this witch’s.

“Impossible, this is impossible!”

A crazy hissing sound suddenly rang out on the training field. At this moment, Leng Ruxue’s beautiful face had been completely distorted, “You b*tch, you cultivated so many years later than me, and you don’t have my special physique, how can you be stronger than me!”

“Impossible, impossible!”

Leng Ruxue was in a state of madness. She simply could not accept the reality before her eyes.

One had to know that she had never thought much of Leng Rushuang. She had even called Leng Rushuang a b*tch all this time, but in the end, she was actually defeated by this ‘b*tch’.

How could she accept such a result?

“You’re already in such a state, are you still not willing to admit defeat?” Leng Rushuang stared coldly at Leng Ruxue.

“Admit defeat? What a joke. Unless I die, I will never lose to you.” Leng Ruxue growled, “Come on, if you have the ability, kill me now!”

“Kill you?” Leng Rushuang shook her head. “Perhaps in your eyes, I don’t even exist as an elder sister, but to me, you are still my younger sister.”

“From today onwards, the grudge between you and me will be settled. You should take care of yourself.”
