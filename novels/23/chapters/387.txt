Chapter 388: The 13th Commander

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Lord!” Lei Dao respectfully saluted and introduced, “This is Swordsman, who has just arrived at the Divine Land from the outside continent. He is here to join your army.”

“Lord.” Jian Wushuang also respectfully saluted.

“Before coming here, I have fought against Swordsman, and he has the battle strength at Stage Two.” Lei Dao said continually.

“Stage Two?” Iron Saber Lord at the top of the hall nodded slightly. “My Iron Saber Army is a place where a lot of experts are gathered. An expert at Stage Two of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm is strong enough to be a commander. However, whether you Swordsman really have such strength needs to be tested.”

“Mo Dong!”

A cold and tough man appeared in front of Jian Wushang at once.

“Swordsman, this is a law of the Iron Saber Army. I hope you understand.” Lei Dao looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Em, I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The cold and tough man was staring at Jian Wushang. “Swordsman, be careful!”

As the voice fell, a flush of skyrocketing power surged up from Mo Dong’s body, who appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in a flash. Then, his right hand became a claw and attacked Jian Wushang like a lightning.?The fingertips slashed across the void, causing a shrill noise.

The void seemed to be torn in half by this swift claw.

Watching this claw, the Lonely Heart Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand. Then, an extremely fierce stab was extended out.

At the moment of this thrust, a mighty killing intent swept through the whole hall. It was so strong that many experts in the hall looked askance at it.

“The killing intent is so strong. It means that his perception of the Slaughter Origin is extremely high, but he is still far from condensing the Origin Mark.”

The experts around were all peak experts above Stage Two, who had very high perceptions. In one glance, they could judge Jian Wushuan’s degree of Origin perception.

Clang!

A low and heavy sound of a collision was heard. At the same time, the point where the sword light met the claw was still faintly ablaze with flames.

“Hum!” Mo Dong coldly snorted, and then spread out his two palms at the same time, and threw himself towards Jian Wushuang like an eagle.

With a solemn face, Jian Wushuang waved his Lonely Heart Sword and directly defended.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

There were several continuous collisions, making clashing noises one after another echoing through the hall.

After the last collision, Mo Dong stretched out his claw, which Jian Wushuang had no time to block and had to respond with his left fist. As a result, both of them were explosively forced back.

“You haven’t condensed the Origin Mark, but when your strength erupts, you are much stronger than those at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. Moreover, your physique is incredible. Your overall strength is not weaker than ordinary Stage Two experts.” Mo Dong solemnly looked at Jian Wushuang.

When he fought against Jian Wushuang, he also felt an unusual pressure from this expert.

The experts around in the hall all laughed at this scene. Obviously, they all recognized Jian Wushuang’s strength.

At the top of the hall, Lord of the Iron Saber Territory looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile on the corners of his mouth, thinking secretly,?“Mo Dong did not do his best, but this Swordsman, I’m afraid, has all hidden his strength. If he uses all his strength, it is not a problem to have a firm foothold at Stage two of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.”

“Swordsman.” Iron Saber Lord looked down.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked up.

“From today, you will be the 13th commander of the No.1 Army!” Iron Saber Lord said in a grand voice.

“Thank you so much, Lord.” Jian Wushuang said immediately.

“Qing.” Iron Saber Lord said.

Then a cyan-robed middle-aged man with steady aura walked out.

“You are the General of No. 1 Army. Now, Swordsman will be under your command. It’s your duty to tell him the regulations of the Iron Saber Army.” Iron Saber Lord ordered.

“Yes.” ‘Qing’ nodded respectfully.

“You can go.” Iron Saber Lord waved his hand, with his figure slowly became more and fainter before finally disappearing. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Such a marvelous skill.” Jian Wushuang was shocked by this.

The commanders and experts in the hall also began to leave.

“Swordsman.” Qing walked to Jian Wushuang.

“General.” Jian Wushuang slightly opened his mouth. Through the dialogue between Iron Saber Lord and Qing, Jian Wuhuang had known that Qing was the General of No. 1 Army, and he himself was No. 9 commander under Qing’s command.

“You have just arrived at the Iron Saber Army. There is something about the army I need to tell you about, but now I’ll lead you to see your people.” Qing said.

“People? ” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Swordsman, each commander in the Iron Saber Army could command a team of warriors. The number is not large. It’s only a one-hundred-person team. Yet a single small team like this could easily destroy the Luo family, one of the Six Families.” Lei Dao smiled aside.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang became curious.

“Lei Dao, come together with us.” Qing said, and then he left the hall.

Jian Wushuang and Lei Dao were following and talking in a low voice.

“Lei Dao, our General seems to be agreeable and modest.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of Course.” Lei Dao smiled. “General Qing has a very high reputation and not bad temperament in the Iron Saber Army. Of course, that’s just for us. When he faces the enemy, the situation will be different.”

“What’s more, General Qing has powerful strength. He is a peak expert at Stage Three!”

“Stage Three?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. If he used all his trump cards and did his best, maybe he could rival the experts at Stage Three now.

“Actually, not only General Qing but also all the commanders in the Iron Saber Army are similar.” Lei Dao said, “After all, most experts in the Iron Saber Army are from outside the Divine Land. They have reached the peak and have no pursuit in the remote continents, and then come to the vast Divine Land.”

“In the remote continents, the cultivation conditions are not as good as in the Divine Land. That they could get to the peak there means they have experienced many years’ of cultivation. All of them are as old as monsters. They are different from the youngsters in the Divine Land, who dare to do anything relying on some strength.”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Guided by General Qing, it didn’t take long for Jian Wushuang to arrive at an army camp.

There were some Sergeants in black armor in the camp.

“Armor?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was weird.

“In the Iron Saber Army, the ordinary Sergeants need to wear armor according to the rule, while the experts above commander could wear whatever they want. There are no such rules for them.” General Qing explained aside.

When Jian Wushuang and the other two people turned up in the army camp, a call was sent out and the entire camp erupted. Numerous black-armored Sergeants walked out of their camp tents. Very quickly they stood in orderly lines on the vacant field of the Drill Ground.

Twenty black-armored Sergeants stood in a line, and there were five lines, so the number was just one hundred.
