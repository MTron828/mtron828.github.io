Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After hearing what the elder had said, Jian Wushuang replied, “OK. I am curious about the power of the Four Great Unique Skills.”

“I will not disappoint you.”

The elder said, and the next moment he pointed out his index finger.

With a rumbling sound, a giant, dark hand emerged with the power of smashing anything.

The giant hand extended out and its index finger contained an incomparably special and powerful force.

“This is… Ancient God’s Fifth Finger?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

There were nine Ancient God’s Fingers in total, and Jian Wushuang had learned six.

The Ancient God’s Fifth Finger was Get Through Difficulty Finger.

So he was surprised that he had met the Ancient God’s Fifth Finger at the beginning.

Jian Wushuang looked serious. He lifted up the Blood Mountain Sword instantly and soon, in the void, ten slashes from the bloody sword emerged.

Each slash contained great power and they appeared together in an instant.

Actually, Jian Wushuang didn’t do his best, but the attack was already strong and suffocating.

Bang!

The slashes from Jian Wushuang’s sword collided with the black giant finger. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

That produced a resounding rumble and the sixth layer was immediately surrounded by a storm of power.

Jian Wushuang, who stood in his original place, shifted his figure.

A magical storm abruptly swept out, and the figure of Jian Wushuang instantly turned into hundreds of phantoms. Each phantom was very different, shifting fast to the elder.

“Universal Laws!”

The golden-armored Ancient God transformed by the elder used his tremendous breath and generated his great Ancient God Power. All of a sudden, he gathered hundreds of figures, each of which had tremendous power.

“Go to hell!”

As the elder shouted, he and his hundreds of figures waved their hands at the same time.

Bang!

Those figures slashed hundreds of palm attacks at the same time rushing to Jian Wushuang.

“What?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t believe it.

“Jian Wushuang, be careful. All the phantoms you have seen from the elder are entities. Their attacks are also real,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“All are real attacks?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The dense golden palms came at the same time. Most of them went to the phantoms of Jian Wushuang, but others went directly to his Real Body, and Jian Wushuang avoided them all.

But in this way, the elder could tell which one was the Real Body of Jian Wushuang. “That is it!”

The elder targeted at the Real Body of Jian Wushuang and slashed a new round of palm attacks.

Hundreds of phantoms behind him all slashed palms directly to Jian Wushuang’s Real Body.

Jian Wushuang was overwhelmed by the attacks.

Boom! boom! boom! boom!

Suddenly, there was a great roar.

A roar echoed between the heaven and the earth, and a golden light burst out. Under the pressure of the palm attacks, a Divine Ape covered in golden armor rose. It was thousands of meters tall, its breath was much stronger, and he was holding a sword and his eyes were fierce.

At the same time, bloody flames spread all over the sixth layer, making it a bloody fire sea.

And Jian Wushuang became the emperor in the sea of fire.

Ha!

As Jian Wushuang shouted, the huge golden Divine Ape rose.

In an instant, this golden ape appeared in front of the elder.

At this time, the elder blinked his eyes and his phantoms all converged behind him. At the same time, the elder generated his power and soared once again. Then his figure quickly exploded to one as tall as the ape. He clenched his right fist and punched Jian Wushuang.

Bang!

In response, the golden ape transformed by Jian Wushuang held the sword in his hand and integrated his divine power and Reincarnation Power.

Jian Wushuang waved his stunning sword, which was powerful enough to tear the sky.

The sword and the palms collided with each other. At that time, Jian Wushuang stepped backward and changed into nearly a hundred phantoms.

The phantoms of Jian Wushuang were as flexible as fish in the water, and his Real Body was surrounding the elder. Jian Wushuang was looking for opportunities to attack the elder based on his insights of time and space.

He exercised his swordsmanship to its full extent.

At that moment, the elder seemed at a disadvantage.

Suddenly… “Hey!”

The elder’s power skyrocketed. Behind his shoulder, the only big head transformed into three more heads. In addition, there were also six arms that extended out.

“What is that?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

At that moment, the golden-armored Ancient God in front of him turned into four heads and eight arms.

“Four heads and eight arms now!”

“Jian Wushuang, this is one of the Four Great Unique Skills. If it is cultivated to the full extent. It can be turned into nine heads and eighteen arms. The skill is not only about heads and arms, it is also accompanied by a set of attacks that will greatly improve one’s capacity to kill.”

“The attacking method of three heads and six arms is different from that of the four-headed and eight-armed one. The most terrible one is that of nine-heads and eight-arms. It is a nightmare for you!” King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had encountered similar skills that could add heads and arms before, but they were simply adding the number and were nothing to do with changing attack skills.

But now in this skill of the Ancient God Clan, each added head and arm meant a leap in power.
