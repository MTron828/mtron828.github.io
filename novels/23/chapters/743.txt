Chapter 744: Arrival

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Tianqi Mountains, Gu Heng looked up to the void over his head, mumbling, “It’s almost time, the outsiders are about to arrive.”

He immediately cried out to his people, “Gu Mian, Gu Wu.”

Two clansmen walked over instantly.

“You two, stay with Jian Wushuang. The rest of you scatter and take action separately. Go.” Gu Heng ordered in a resonant tone.

Hundreds of two-star clansmen immediately teamed up in twos or threes and glided in all directions.

Gu Mian and Gu Wu appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

Gu Heng looked over at Jian Wushuang, saying, “Most of the outsiders will join hands to attack us. You’re good, but it’s too dangerous to travel alone.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Both Gu Mian and Gu Wu are Two-star Silver-armored Ancient Gods. Their powers are not bad, comparable to the Human Warriors at Step Two of the Eternal Realm. With them following you, they can be your helpers.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and asked, “What about you?”

Gu Heng smiled and said with confidence, “Of course, I’ll travel alone.

“The outsiders won’t threaten me. Even if four or five outsiders attack me together, I’m able to defeat them by myself.”

Jian Wushuang shrugged. He had never doubted Gu Heng’s strength.

Over the past few years in the Ancient God Palace, he had fought with Gu Heng several times and had lost badly each time.

“OK, be careful. Don’t underestimate those outsiders. I will leave first. Goodbye.” Gu Heng reminded before he left.

Only Jian Wushuang, Gu Mian and Gu Wu remained standing there.

“We should go too.” Jian Wushuang said and then walked away.

Gu Mian and Gu Wu looked at each other. Although they were unwilling to follow Jian Wushuang, they had to obey Gu Heng’s order.

Not long after the clansmen dispersed, the void above the Tianqi Mountains suddenly shook, and a surge of space wave spread out.

“Is it coming?” Jian Wushuang raised his head with a flicker of delight in his eyes.

“Master, shall we guard a Baptismal Pool or travel around to support others?” Gu Mian suddenly asked.

Jian Wushuang responded with a smile, “We’ll take the second option for sure.”

The Tianqi Mountains was the main battlefield between the ancient gods and the experts from the Firmament Territory.

The mountains stretched for thousands of miles and the Ancient God Clan intentionally set 100 Baptismal Pools in every nook of the mountains to attract experts from the Firmament Territory to compete.

The clansmen were scattered all over the mountains. Some of them would choose to guard the Baptismal Pool, waiting for the arrival of outsiders.

The others would travel around to trace the outsiders or support other clansmen who were in fierce fights.”

In fact, it could be said that the attractive Demon God Baptismal Pool was the bait the Ancient God Clan put down in order to train their own clansmen.

The experts from the Firmament Territory realized it, but the Baptismal Pool was too irresistible that they would take the bait without hesitation.

For the Ancient God Clan, it would be a great opportunity to fight fiercely with the various experts.

After all, they had lived in peace for a long time, so they were raring to fight to the death.

“The outsiders have just arrived, so they will first get together, then collaborate to grab the Baptismal Pool. To duel with them, we have to wait for quite a while,” Gu Mian said.

“Right.” Jian Wushuang nodded, his heart full of expectation.

Just two hours later, buzz… A mighty power was transmitted towards the three of them.

“That is…” Jian Wushuang and his clansmen all raised their heads while seeing strange power waves radiating in all directions.

Gu Mian’s face darkened, and said, “This is an SOS from our clansmen.”

“If I’m right, a Baptismal Pool is set in there.” Gu Wu added.

“Oh, they’ve already started to attack?” Jian Wushuang replied with a glitter of excitement on his face.

In the Eternal Zone, it was impossible to use Messaging Slips. The Ancient Gods live here all year round and had honed their own way to send messages. The strange power waves that emerged in all directions were distress signals from the clansmen of the Ancient God Clan.

Once an SOS was sent, clansmen within a radius of thousands of miles would sense it.

“Let’s go. Hurry up,” Jian Wushuang growled.

The three of them instantly streaked toward the battlefield.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang put on a full-faced silver monster mask.

After all, his identity was somewhat special, and it was better not to be recognized by the experts from the Firmament Territory.

He was dressed in a black robe and carrying a longsword. Under the mask, his sharp eyes shone with a flicker of killing intent.

“The three magnates of the Firmament Territory!

“Cloud Sea Asgard, the Immortal Dynasty, and the Boundless Demon Sect!

“100 years ago, you compelled me to this misery and forced me to be stuck in this Eternal Zone!

“Big Brother Gu Qiong also died for me!

“I have remembered all these clearly. Now, it’s time for you to pay back.”

Jian Wushuang was murderous.

After a while, the three of them arrived at their destination where a fierce fight had broken out.

A Silver-armored Ancient God and a Copper-armored Ancient God were battling with three human experts from the Firmament Territory.

There were two men and one woman. Jian Wushuang had even met before one of them.

“It’s him.?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the white-haired elder among the three human experts.

Although they did not know each other, Jian Wushuang had met this elder hundred years ago before entering the Eternal Zone.

“This old guy comes from the Immortal Dynasty, so might be the other two experts.”

Thinking of this, an overwhelming killing intent gushed out from his eyes.
