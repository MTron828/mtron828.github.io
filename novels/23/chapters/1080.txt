Chapter 1081: Meeting in the Soul-crushing Pagoda

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“If I can be with her, so what if Green Fire World, even the Eternal Chaotic World turns against me?”

Jian Nantian’s words spread through the sky.

The observing crowd was stunned hearing him.

They could feel his courage in the words.

Jian Nantian kept going toward the Heaven-ceasing Mountain.

The Celestial Master’s face whitened.

He had tried every means but in vain. He failed to stop the determined Jian Nantian.

Finally, Jian Nantian reached the foot of the mountain.

A Restriction was set around the mountain foot, which was impossible for any ordinary Celestial Master to went through.

Jian Nantian crossed through easily.

Jian Nantian twisted his one hand, casually as ever.

An ethereal sword light was shot and landed on the Restriction, which was torn apart just in moments.

Behind the Restriction, the entire mountain revealed itself to Jin Nantian.

“Well?”

Jian Nantian raised his head. He stared at the ancient black tower in the distance.

“That’s… Soul-crushing Pagoda?” Gu King recognized it.

“What is that?” A doubt escaped Jian Wushuang.

“The Soul-crushing Pagoda contains 18 trials that test a person’s soul. And it gets harder with the increase of the level.

“Soul-crushing Pagoda is not something extraordinary in the Eternal Chaotic World. But in Green Fire World, it’s rather challenging, and your mother must have been prisoned in it. Your father has to pass 18 tests, I wonder if he can make it.”

“Test a person’s soul?” Jian Wushuang vaguely smiled.

If they were tests in other things, Jian Wushuang might worry. However, when it came to the soul…

Since living in the Ancient World, his father had been known for bearing a strong mental attitude. Now, he must have had a much stronger heart.

Despite the difficulty, Jian Wushuang believed that his father would succeed.

Before the mountain, Jian Nantian paused for a while, and then, he stepped into Soul-crushing Pagoda.

The crowd all stared at Soul-crushing Pagoda to sense Jian Nantian’s aura.

At present time, Jian Nantian had stepped into Level One.

A few moments later, he reached Level Two.

“He’s crossed through Level One.” Fists clenched, Jian Wushuang looked delighted.

“Not so soon. It gets hard with the increase of the level. Level One is easy, any Celestial Master can cross it. And from Level Two to Level Ten test, one can easily pass them as well. But the 11th Level is really hard.” Gu King continued.

As Gu King had expected, Jian Nantian spent little time in the first nine Levels. He passed them effortlessly.

Even in Level Ten, he did not linger and kept his usual pace.

However, when he entered 11th Level, he slowed down.

He had spent several minutes before he crossed through 11th Level.

And he stopped at Level 12 for one quarter.

When he finally made it to 18th Level, the early half of the day had passed.

“The 18th Level is the hardest. Even in the Eternal Chaotic World, one out of 100 Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm may fail the test.” Gu King sounded solemn.

Jian Wushuang looked grave as well.

Those experts all waited in silence.

Three days, Jian Nantian stayed at 18th Level for three days. Then, the crowd sensed his aura had moved from 18th Level to the highest level, 19th Level.

“He’s passed!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang clasped his hands.

“He actually spent only three days?” Gu King was impressed. “Even well-prepared, a Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm will usually spend half a month or even more. Your father actually spent three days only. He really bears a strong mental attitude.

“I’ve told you. My father’s mental attitude is strong.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

As expected, his mother had been imprisoned at 19th Level in Soul-crushing Pagoda. Since Jian Nantian had stepped into that level, it meant they had met.

In the empty space at 19th Level of Soul-crushing Pagoda, a chained blue-robed woman sat on a stone-built bed.

She looked haggard and worried.

She knew it was the day Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang went to challenge the Ancient Monster Clan, but she could not know the result, being imprisoned in this Soul-crushing Pagoda.

“Nantian, Shuang’er…”

“You must survive, you have to survive.”

She could only pray in her heart.

At that time, she heard heavy footsteps.

“What?” The blue-robed woman suddenly raised her head.

She had been captured here for more than 2,000 years. Never had she seen another human being during the long years. Even when her master Celestial Master Ku Xin talked to her, she could only hear his voices. She was really surprised when she heard the footsteps.

That person actually entered the highest level in Soul-crushing Pagoda.

She stared at the entrance.

Hearing the footsteps approaching for a while, finally, she saw a figure in black appeared.

She was stunned, seeing the figure.

For more than 2,000 years, though she was cut off from the world, she still thought of the figure dressed in black time and time again. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After all these years, she missed it even more.

She thought that, in the rest of her life, she would never see him again. However, he appeared in front of her again.

“Am I dreaming?” The blue-robed woman murmured in disbelief.

Seeing the woman, Jian Nantian’s indifference was gone. He was trembling.

He looked at the blue-robed woman, eyes tranquil like a sea. His heart was almost melting.

In the empty space at 19th Level of Soul-crushing Pagoda, they looked at each other.

After a long while, Jian Nantian finally scratched his head, laughed like a kid, and said, “Meng’er, we’re going home!”
