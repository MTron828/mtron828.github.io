Chapter 1070: Arrival

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’m done here. The decision is your own.”

Holy Master Ku Xin glanced at the old Black Tower, shook his head and left with a sigh.

In the tower, the blue-robed woman stood there with desperation in her eyes. She murmured,

“Nantian! Shuanger!”

“How are you?”

A month ago, Jian Nantian announced that he would break into Heaven-ceasing Peak at his inauguration ceremony.

The news had already spread throughout the whole Samsara Continent.

The month was up.

The enormous Void of the Ancient Demon Clan was filled with people.

Most experts in the Samsara Continent had gathered.

The other three Peak populations, other strong clans from Divine Monster Territory, many solitary experts, such as the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Duke of Ghost, Inner Elders and Gold-clothed Deacons from the Samsara Temple all gathered here to watch their fight.

The whole Void was buzzing.

“Many people privately call the Ancient Demon Clan the most powerful population in the Samsara Continent. The clan boasts of vast strength and an extensive army, but this time, the Ancient Demon Clan has angered a formidable opponent.”

“The Supervisor of the Samsara Temple killed Holy Master Lei Yi with just one strike. He must have the strength of a Holy Master of the Exceptional Realm. In the entire Ancient Demon Clan, perhaps only Holy Master Ku Xin is his match. This time, the Ancient Demon Clan will be in grave danger.”

“I don’t think so. I heard that this Supervisor is bringing his son, which means that he will not mobilize all the experts of the Samsara Temple. It is only the two of them fighting. They are strong, but they can’t defeat the entire Ancient Demon Clan.”

“In any case, this battle will be vicious.”

“This is certain. I only hope that the Ancient Demon Clan will not concede. It won’t be interesting if them release the prisoner as soon as the Supervisor and Jian Wushuang arrive.”

“That’s not gonna happen. The Heaven-ceasing Peak is important to the Ancient Demon Clan. They won’t hand over the prisoner unless they have no other choice. Besides, have you noticed the Formation over there? They have already activated it, which means they are going to use it to defend themselves against their enemy.”

“This Formation seems to be very powerful.”

“More than just strong. This is the Clan-defending Formation of the Ancient Demon Clan. It is said that there is no way to break it unless several Holy Masters of the Exceptional Realm join forces.”

The Void became noisy with gossiping voices.

At this moment, two figures appeared in the distance, striding towards the Ancient Demon Clan shoulder to shoulder.

Silence swept through the crowd.

Countless eyes looked on in awe and admiration.

They both carried longswords, and radiated a strong sense of power.

“Jian Nantian is the new Supervisor of the Samsara Temple! It is said that he is the personal disciple of the Samsara Temple Master!”

“The other is Jian Wushuang. He may only be of the Eternal Realm, but there is no doubting his power.”

“The father and son have finally arrived.”

No one breathed.

After the inauguration ceremony held a month ago, Jian Nantian’s and Jian Wushuang’s reputation had spread across the continent.

The two prodigies who happened to be father and son shocked the crowd. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Under the scrutiny of the crowd, Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian arrived at the Void above the Ancient Demon Clan. Through the grand Formation, they saw everyone within the Ancient Demon Clan. They saw a lot of experts in Ancient Demon Clan who had gathered there, and their leader who was a white-haired elder within the Formation.

“Is he the Holy Master Ku Xin?”?Jian Wushuang wondered, fixing his eyes on the white-haired elder.

Jian Wushuang had heard a lot about Holy Master Ku Xin who was of the Exceptional Realm. He was the most powerful expert in the Green Fire World under the Samsara Temple Master, the Temple Master of Void and the Tang Emperor.

The several Holy Masters he had fought against, including the strongest one, the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, were not even qualified to be Holy Master Ku Xin’s opponent.

Apart from Holy Master Ku Xin, Jian Wushuang did not fear other experts of the Ancient Demon Clan, not even including Holy Master Dong Ming. He also considered the Formation that was the pride of the Ancient Demon Clan.

The Ancient Demon Clan must have a lot of strength. Otherwise, they couldn’t have survived so long as one of the four Peak populations of the Samsara Continent.

“They even deployed their Clan-defending Formation. It seems that they are not going to yield to us,” Jian Wushuang said with a cold laughter.

“I assumed so.”

Calm and determined, Jian Nantian took a step forward and faced off against Holy Master Ku Xin across the large Formation.

“Holy Master Ku Xin, have you made your decision?” Jian Nantian said, staring at him.

“Of course I have,” Holy Master Ku Xin answered, his gaze landing on Jian Nantian. “Jian Nantian, you are the Supervisor of the Samsara Temple now. If there was any other way, we, the Ancient Demon Clan, wouldn’t dare to offend you. But the prisoner in Heaven-ceasing Peak holds great importance to us. It’s impossible to hand her over to you.”

“Then we have nothing left to say,” Jian Nantian responded in a calm voice.

As soon as he finished his sentence, his longsword rushed out of his saber and light streaked across his longsword.

The sword light was cold, dazzling. Most importantly, it still moved slowly as if it might not harm its target.

The experts narrowed their eyes when they saw the sword light.

They clearly remembered that Jian Nantian had directly struck Holy Master Lei Yi down with this technique easily at his inauguration ceremony a month ago.

Even Holy Master Ku Xin frowned at the sight of this strange sword light, but he was not frightened.

Slow as the sword light looked, it actually was moving at a very rapid speed. The force of the sword fell directly onto the Clan-defending Formation.

However, it only caused several ripples on the Formation, then the light from the blow vanished.

“What?” Jian Nantian muttered, a hint of surprise flashing through his eyes.

“How can this be?” Many experts behind Jian Wushuang were shocked by the scene.

They all knew the power of Jian Nantian’s light sword. A Holy Master had died under this attack. However, this formidable sword light had failed to cause any damage to the Formation.

That Formation was indestructible!
