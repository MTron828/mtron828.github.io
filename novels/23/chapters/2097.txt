Chapter 2098 Five War Spirits

The Black Water Dragon Clan had Elder Gu, who could deal with two of the great emperors from the Sky Swallowing Clan.

As for the two great emperors from Acheron Palace, they were dealt with by King Chen Xing and the Black Dragon Emperor.

Both the Black Dragon Emperor and King Chen Xing were stage two great emperors. If they decided to use their full force, the two remaining great emperors from Acheron Palace would be utterly suppressed.

Jian Wushaung took on Ba Su himself.

At the level of great emperors, the Black Water Dragon Clan had the absolute advantage. People like King Chen Xing and the Black Water Dragon Emperor, who could suppress their opponents, could find chances and help the other battles by killing almighties from Acheron Palace or the Sky Swallowing Clan.

This allowed for the Black Water Dragon Clan to get a bigger advantage.

Ba Su panicked as he saw this.

“Black Robes man, the Acheron Palace could do incredible things. Think of something.” Ba Su transmitted.

The old man in black robes was facing King Chen Xing.

King Chen Xing was a stage two great emperor. He was a top tier Nine-star Ancient God who had mastered the secret skills of the Ancient God Clan. On the other hand, the man in black robes was just a stage one great emperor. He could not do anything against King Chen Xing.

When the man in black robes received the transmission, he was speechless.

“Even though the Acheron Palace is capable of many things, we are not omnipotent. We have already sent a great number of experts into the Special Tribes just to create the conditions to attack the Black Water Dragon Clan. What can we do?”

The man in black robes growled as he was helpless to do anything. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Now, he really could not do anything to change the situation.

Right then…

“Humph. I knew the garbage from Acheron Palace was not capable of anything.” A cold voice reverberated throughout the battlefield.

All of the experts on the battlefield looked towards the source of the voice.

They saw thirty figures hovering in mid-air at an area near the battlefield. The thirty of them wore blood red cloaks and radiated an evil, bloody aura.

“This is… Holocaust Sect? Why are the people from the Holocaust Sect here?”

The man in black robes looked at these people and was surprised.

“We came here on the orders of my master. We wanted to stay hidden and not interfere with the battle. Little did I know that the people of the Acheron Palace were so useless.” The man at the front said.

“Useless?” The face of the old man in black robes turned pale. Even though he was enraged, he kept it controlled.

“No matter what, it is good that the people from Holocaust Sect are here. Ally with us and kill everyone from the Black Water Dragon Clan and the Ancient God Clan.” The old man in black robes roared.

“Humph. I don’t need garbage like you to tell me what to do.” The man in the lead said coldly. A faint crimson red light was seen within his eyes as he looked at the battlefield.

Hum! Hum! Hum!

Three monstrous aura erupted simultaneously from these men in red cloak.

These three auras came from great emperors. To make matters worse, the man in the lead was a stage-two great emperor!!

“Great Emperors? Another three of them?” People like the Black Dragon Emperor and King Chen Xing turned pale.

Even Jian Wushuang knitted his eyebrows.

“Haha. Looks like the tides have turned. Seems like I will be winning this battle.” Ba Su laughed loudly.

“Is that so? I think it’s too early to celebrate.” Jian Wushuang grinned.

“Huh?”

Ba Su knitted his eyebrows. He did not know where Jian Wushuang got his confidence from.

In the air, near the battlefield.

“Go, attack!!”

The man in the crimson red cloak ordered. At that instant, the two stage-one great emperors and the thirty almighties charged towards the battlefield.

Everyone from the Black Water Dragon Clan and Ancient God Clan looked grim.

Right then, Jian Wushuang turned his palm as an ancient mirror appeared in his hands.

“Go, my five war spirits!”

Jian Wushuang roared as waves of aura radiated from the mirror.

These auras soon turned into five large black figures.

Each of the figures radiated a sinister vibe. It was as though they came from the depths of hell.

Ba Su widened his eyes when he saw the five war spirits.

“These, these… are great emperors?”

Under the surprise of Ba Su, the five war spirits rushed towards the space not too far away.

Obviously, the five war spirits went to engage the experts from Holocaust Sect.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The five war spirits dashed around the crowd of experts from Holocaust sect. Within seconds, a battle broke out.

There were thirty members of the Holocaust Sect, including three great emperors. They were facing five war spirits, of which each had the fighting power of a great emperor.

Five war spirits, which was the equivalent to five great emperors, were all at the level of great emperors. They forcibly stopped the various experts from Holocaust Sect,

Under the leadership of the man in crimson red cloak, the experts of Holocaust Sect engaged the five war spirits. However, they would not be able to free themselves within a short amount of time.

This scene made the hopeful Ba Su stunned once more.

The various experts on the battle field were stunned too.

They had never thought that Jian Wushuang would have such an amazing back up plan.

This included people such as King Chen Xing from the Ancient God Clan.

Five war spirits, with the power of five great emperors?

Jian Wushuang was already very powerful, yet he still had such an amazing fighting force in his hands?

Jian Wushuang smiled when he saw that the experts from the Holocaust Sect had been stopped by the war spirits.

The five war spirits had devoured his divine power while in the mirror and evolved. They now possessed the fighting power of a great emperor. Even though it was only stage-one great emperor, they could even beat normal stage-two great emperors if they formed the Five Fire Formation.

In this scenario, however, separating the five war spirits was much more beneficial to the battle field.
