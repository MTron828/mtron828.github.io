Chapter 3024: Rank Four True Saint

——

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you have massacred wantonly within my Magic Note Divine Kingdom. At this point, just the number of True Saint experts that have died at your hands has already exceeded 20. If I do not kill you today, how can I intimidate this great Divine Kingdom? Even if word gets out, others will probably think that my Magic Note Divine Kingdom is easy to bully.”

“So…go to hell!”

The voice of the Magic Note King was cold and emotionless.

As soon as he finished speaking, he slowly raised his right hand.

As soon as he raised his hand, a strong rule power gathered and formed a pitch-black light beam in the blink of an eye.

The pitch-black light beam did not seem to have any power at first glance. However, as the Magic Note King pointed out, the moment the pitch-black light beam burst out, a strong sound of air being compressed and completely penetrated resounded through the void.

“This is…the power of the dark principles?”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly constricted.

He naturally did not dare to underestimate the Magic Note King, who was a rank four True Saint.

Now, the Magic Note King had used the power of the dark principles perfectly. The pitch-black light beam burst out from his finger contained extremely terrifying power.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang surged his divine power. The 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom behind him, with its golden eyes, emitted a terrifying golden light. Jian Wushuang raised his right hand, in an instant, the Blood Mountain Sword suddenly fell down with boundless divine power.

The Blood Mountain Sword was blood-red in color. When it fell, it was like a swift and fierce blood-red thunderbolt that fiercely smashed into the black light beam.

However, as soon as the two collided, Jian Wushuang was shocked by the terrifying impact force contained in the black beam of light. Then, his divine body shook, and his body flew backward like a cannonball, he kept rolling, and it took him a long time to get rid of the impact force.

In the void, Jian Wushuang regained his balance, but it was obvious that he was in a sorry state.

“What a terrifying power!”

“This power is too strong!”

Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He had just released all of his divine power. After the battle with Gold King, he knew that his divine power had reached the level of a True Saint at the peak of rank three. With the Divine Punishment God, his divine power had almost tripled, it should have been above a rank three True Saint.

However, he had been defeated by the Magic Note King in an instant..

“As expected of a rank four True Saint. Even a casual finger of the principle is extremely terrifying,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Your divine body didn’t collapse after taking my finger head-on. It seems that not only your combat strength is good, but your body-protection ability is also excellent.” The Magic Note King continued to stare at Jian Wushuang.

“If a genius like you grows up in the future, you will be terrifying. Unfortunately, although your skills are good, you are trapped in my dragon-imprisoning compass formation and have no chance to escape. No matter how strong your body-protection ability is, you can only block one or two or three of my attacks. If you attack too many times, you will definitely not be able to block them. In the end, you will still die.”

“Dead for sure?” Jian Wushuang laughed, with a hint of mockery in his voice. “Not long ago, your men said that I would die today, but what happened?”

“They did, and so did you.”

“As for escaping? You think too much. Since I showed up, I have never thought of escaping. Your men are not qualified to let me escape, and neither are you.”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice slowly echoed in the world.

As soon as he finished speaking, he activated the star power in his body.

Seven-star secret skill, volume three!

As soon as he activated it, the divine power aura on Jian Wushuang’s body began to increase at a terrifying speed.

He was only an ordinary first rank True Saint, and it was obvious that he had just made a breakthrough. However, in the blink of an eye, his divine power had reached the peak of a first rank True Saint, and in the end, it had even reached the limit of a first rank True Saint!

His divine power aura soared, and the strength of his divine power reached a whole new level.

In addition, a layer of dark gold armor appeared on his body. He had also used the nine luminaries star armor!

“After using the Divine Punishment, my divine power has reached the limit of a rank three True Saint. I’m almost at the threshold of a rank four True Saint. After using the seven-star secret skill, my divine power will definitely reach the threshold of a rank four True Saint. I’m not weak among rank four True Saints. Finally, I’ll use the nine luminaries star armor…” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Although the nine luminaries star armor heavenly armor would not increase the strength of his divine power, this secret skill would directly increase the power of his attack.

Moreover, it would increase the power of his attack by nine times!

This also meant that his divine power would increase by nine times!

This secret skill was too terrifying!

“When these secret skills are combined, my current attack power is far stronger than that of an ordinary rank four True Saint. I might even reach the peak of a rank four True Saint.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled, “It’s true that the Magic Note King is a rank four True Saint, but he hasn’t reached the peak of a rank four True Saint yet. I’m afraid that his power is weaker than mine!”

“Come on, let me see how powerful a rank four True Saint is!”

Jian Wushuang let out a fierce shout, but his body instantly rushed out.

At the same time, a terrifying aura completely pressed down on the Magic Note King.

“You’re courting death!”

The Magic Note King was also shocked and angry. With a cold voice, he waved his hand and a black hammer appeared. The black hammer was surrounded by a large amount of dark rule power. As he took a step forward, the black hammer instantly smashed out.

Boom!

It was like a black meteor streaking across the sky.

Jian Wushuang also waved the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand. With a swing of his sword, a sword light suddenly lit up.

The sword light was also silent, but the moment it lit up, it roared. A faint roar of a fierce beast echoed in the world.

It was a sword light, but in the blink of an eye, the sword light turned into a huge and ferocious beast head.

Space-time sword art, Xi Xiang! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The same ‘Xi Xiang’ sword art, but with Jian Wushuang using several secret skills at the same time, the power of the sword had increased by many times.

In the blink of an eye, the sword light collided with the black meteor.

Clang!

With a loud sound, Jian Wushuang’s body shook violently, and then he was smashed down.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang was still completely crushed by this collision.
