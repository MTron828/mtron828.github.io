Chapter 686: Fighting Against an Advanced Divine Realm Expert

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There was a huge gap between the different levels of Divine Realm experts.

An intermediate Divine Realm expert was at least ten times stronger than a novice Divine Realm expert and the gap between a Skyscraping Realm expert and a Divine Realm expert was even greater.

Everyone present were at least Divine Realm experts and Yuan Qian was an intermediate Divine Realm expert. Why would he be concerned about Jian Wushuang, a Skyscraping Realm cultivator?

When he saw Jian Wushuang wield the sword, he laughed dismissively. “You must have a death wish.”

But when Jian Wushuang’s sword was used correctly... The beautiful sword made people feel intoxicated with even its most basic movements. This sword seemed as though it was flawless.

“Huh?” As Yuan Qian watched the fluid movements of the sword, he was surprised. “It would seem the swordsmanship of this Skyscraping Realm cultivator is quite good.”

Though he was surprised, Yuan Qian still didn’t care about Jian Wushuang, it wasn’t until he came face to face with the power of this majestic sword...

“What?” Yuan Qian was stunned.

He found that when under attack from the sword, he had no room to dodge. He quickly waved his palms and using his Spiritual Power, he enlarged his palms which then patted the shadow of the sword. But it was no match! The cold Sword Edge cut straight through his palm like cutting tofu and continued cutting into his body with ferocious power and pierced through his entire body.

Then, with all eyes watching in astonishment, Yuan Qian’s figure fell weakly to the ground.

Yuan Qian, an intermediate Divine Realm expert, was killed by a single move!

With the sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang stood in the air. The edge of the longsword coldly emitted a slight purple glow, with blood dripping slowly. Jian Wushuang didn’t even glance at Yuan Qian, but looked at the towering building ahead as his thundering roar suddenly sounded.

“Bing Ji, come and face death!”

“Bing Ji, come and face death!” “Bing Ji, come and face death!” “Bing Ji, come and face death!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice echoed throughout the whole Dan Yang City, frightening numerous Warriors.

Bing Ji who had been inside the building could no longer sit still. Moving quickly, he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Bing Ji was a cold and calculating man with piercing eyes. Dressed in a black robe, he stared at Jian Wushuang, with a hint of horror in his eyes.

Although he had stayed inside the building, he had been watching everything that had happened outside. At first he did not take Jian Wushuang seriously, but seeing how Jian Wushuang killed Yuan Qian made him feel nervous.

“Such swift movement! Yuan Qian is at least an intermediate Divine Realm expert, but was killed by a single blow. It was partly because of Yuan Qian underestimating his enemy, but his adversary would not be able to strike so swiftly without superior strength.”

“His knowledge of word Principle is extensive!”

“Although he is merely at the Skyscraping Realm, his battle strength is comparable to that of an intermediate Divine Realm expert and even at their peak.”

This was Bing Ji’s assessment of Jian Wushuang’s strength.

“A disciple of the Ancient Sect.”

Bing Ji’s pupils shrunk.?“No sooner have I arrived in Dan Yang City than I was targeted by the Ancient Sect. It seems that I must flee. Otherwise.... this time they just sent a Skyscraping Realm disciple. It’s irrelevant how?strong he is for his ability is limited, but next time they may send advanced Divine Realm experts or worse yet a superior Divine Realm expert to hunt down me.”

Bing Ji had decided.

He had already benefited handsomely during his time in Dan Yang City and he felt there was little to gain by staying here, so he had no intention of fighting with Jian Wushuang.

Unless necessary, he had no intention of killing any disciples of the Ancient Sect, let alone a disciple with such excellent Sword Principle.

“Leave!”

Without hesitation, Bing Ji retreated.

He Yun and the others were shocked by what they were seeing.

They were sure that Bing Ji would be so angry that he wouldn’t hesitate to fight and even kill Jian Wushuang, but when Bing Ji showed up, he instead ran away, but what Jian Wushuang did next surprised them even more.

“You won’t escape anymore.”

Jian Wushuang spoke menacingly. Just then, his figure had turned into a phantom, and he chased Bing Ji so fast that he appeared behind him almost immediately.

“His speed!”

Realizing that Jian Wushang was behind him, Bing Ji’s heart sunk.

Even though it was clear that Jian Wushang was merely at the Skyscraping Realm, he was actually faster than Bing Ji.

Admittedly he was not specialized in speed, but even still, a Skyscraping Realm cultivator should not be able to catch up with him.

When Jian Wushuang appeared, the essence of his Sword exploded. As Jian Wushuang waved his hand, the shadow of a sword moving as quick as lightning cut into him.

“Bastard!”

“The reason I fled was that I have no desire to fall out with the Ancient Sect. Do you really think I would be afraid of you, a Skyscraping Realm nonentity?”

With a roar, Bing Ji cast a glance at Jian Wushuang. He waved his sleeve, then an enormous energy swept out and a statue of a khaki giant, thirty feet tall, suddenly emerged in front of Jian Wushuang. The khaki giant yelled to the sky, then waved his fist, full of energy, and directed it at Wushuang.

The khaki giant was merely a product of Bing Ji’s energy. It was by no means a superb technique and the giant wasn’t strong.

“Attack!”

With a yell, Jian Wushuang slashed relentlessly with the Emperor Sword, almost splitting the khaki giant in half with overwhelming force, he then turned the sword toward Bing Ji with violent intentions.

“What?” Bing Ji’s face suddenly looked worried.

For a long time now, what he had just displayed was enough to defeat even those that were top intermediate Divine Realm experts, but Jian Wushuang bettered it with a single blow from his sword.

This made Bing Ji realize that Jian Wushang’s strength might be that of advanced intermediate Divine Realm.

“Humph!”

With a cold contemplation, Bing Ji didn’t dare to take any more chances. With a turn of his wrist, a saber appeared in his hand. The saber was mercilessly set upon the light from Jian Wushuang’s sword and at the same time, Bing Ji’s palm holding the saber doubled in size, thus increasing the saber’s power.

Battle commenced.

Bang! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After a thud, Jian Wushuang took a small step back, but Bing Ji was completely knocked off his stride. When he regained his balance, Bing Ji looked dumb struck.

“How can this be possible?”

“I, a grand advanced Divine Realm expert, was forced to use my Divine Weapon and Secret Skills including my strongest Secret Skill, the Thousands Apes Hand, to fight against a Skyscraping Realm cultivator, and it is I that must retreat?”

“Exactly how strong is he?”
