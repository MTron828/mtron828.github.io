Chapter 5281 - 5281: The Strength of One Bull

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Since arriving here, it had been almost a month.

Jian Wushuang had been fishing since the first day, consuming fish day after day. His strength had increased to over 10,000 jin.

He had devoured nearly all the fat fish in the river, catching three to five every day.

“With my current physical strength, it’s time to challenge that wild boar.” Jian Wushuangs eyes flickered as he wiped the blood off his spear.

As he stood up, he spotted a wild boar drinking downstream. This was the first time this particular boar had attacked him.

Wild boars mostly lived in forests, with only a few wandering in grassy valleys.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang picked up a piece of gravel, took aim, and hurled it at the boar drinking water.

A miserable squeal echoed through the valley as the stone hit the boar’s hindquarters, causing it to limp away.

“I’ll deal with you tonight!” Jian Wushuang gripped his spear and left the riverbank.

After observing for several days, he noticed that wolves hunted on the eastern side of the river at night, while wild boars were on the western side.

At that time, there would be no predators competing with him.

Confident in his plan, he merged with the flock of sheep, found a slope, and lay down, patiently awaiting the arrival of night.

According to his estimation, the power of a wild boar should be around three thousand. With his current strength, which surpassed ten thousand jin in both fists, he was many times stronger than before. Dealing with a wild boar should be a piece of cake.

And that wild boar’s hind leg was injured, it couldn’t run away, it could only fight him.

Lying on the slope, Jian Wushuangs gaze remained fixed on the injured wild boar. The sneak attack a moment ago had made the boar more cautious, it hadn’t dared to approach the river since then.

Night fell quickly. Jian Wushuang adjusted his physical aura to its peak. In a one-on-one battle tonight, he had a ninety percent chance of winning, he just feared the involvement of other animals.

If he could kill this wild boar, he would have at least half a month’s worth of food, and his physical strength would skyrocket.

He had already eaten all the fish in the river. Everything was heading in a good direction. One by one, in ten years’ time, he could eat all these livestock without a problem.

Under the cover of night, Jian Wushuang silently crossed the river and arrived at the territory of the wild boar and water buffalo.

In this grassland, seventy percent was occupied by the herd of buffalo, and the remaining 30 percent was dominated by seven wild boars.

The buffalo, being naturally gentle, probably would have been driven away by the wild boars if they were as aggressive. However, their gentleness increased the difficulty of Jian Wushuangs hunting. In the future, if he wanted to hunt buffalo, he would face an entire community.

The strength of a single buffalo probably exceeded tens of thousands of pounds. A few dozen of them meant several hundred thousand pounds. It was not something he could currently provoke.

Quietly bypassing the buffalo’s territory, Jian Wushuangs steps gradually slowed down. Although his vision was somewhat blurry, he found the injured wild boar based on its bloody aura.

It was lying under a tree, its tail swatting at the flies buzzing around it from time to time.

Jian Wushuang licked his lips. The wild boar was injured. Although it was weaker than before, it was still very alert. It hadn’t fallen asleep.

“Die!” He tilted back slightly, holding a spear in one hand and fiercely thrust it forward.

The piercing sound of the spear breaking the silence startled a wild boar, its tip pointing directly at its face.

Shunk!

Blood splattered as the spear struck the boar’s skull, eliciting a gruesome cry that scattered birds perched on nearby trees.

Even though the spear pierced the boar’s head, it didn’t immediately bring the creature down. Instead, it became even more furious than before.

Even in its confusion, the boar recognized that Jian Wushuang was attacking it.

Shivering, the boar suddenly unleashed tremendous strength and charged towards Jian Wushuang.

However, its hind leg injuries were severe. Jian Wushuang simply sidestepped and then kicked the boar’s hind leg with all his might.

This kick, delivered with full force, made the boar’s other hind leg produce a crisp sound.

This time, it seemed genuinely broken.

With both hind legs shattered, the boar, no matter how strong, couldn’t touch Jian Wushuang.

Dragging its legs, it chased Jian Wushuang aimlessly, like a headless fly, darting around in all directions.

Seizing the opportunity, Jian Wushuang leaped, raised his weapon high, and grabbed the spear embedded in the boar. With a powerful tug, he pulled out the spear, and red and white matter spilled out onto the ground.

Taking advantage of this moment, he stabbed the boar’s belly fiercely, then lifted it with a jab, flinging it several yards away, crashing it hard onto the ground.

The boar, now lying on the ground, shook its head, blood flowing from its face. It attempted to roar again, but no sound came out, and it couldn’t escape.

Whoosh!

After catching his breath, its eyes locked onto Jian Wushuang. Once again, it sprinted towards him, its two tusks aimed directly at Jian Wushuangs body.

This time, Jian Wushuang didn’t evade. He planted both legs firmly, pushed his left fist forward with all his might, and struck the boar’s face.

Crash!

The fist collided with the boar’s head, creating a muffled sound.

Already having a hole in its skull, the boar’s head collapsed upon impact with Jian Wushuangs fist. His entire fist plunged into the boar’s forehead, and the two tusks missed him by a hair’s breadth.

Except for the last time when he had to exert some effort, the rest of the times were relatively easy.

This time, it was to test his current physical strength. With one punch, he pierced through the wild boar’s head, a feat that satisfied him.

After catching his breath, he turned to look at the remaining wild boars, his eyes filled with killing intent, making them hesitate to approach.

The valley was not that big. Killing one wild boar affected not only many other animals but also the predators who dared not challenge Jian Wushuang.

“Hoo!” Jian Wushuang hoisted the entire wild boar onto his shoulder, taking heavy steps, and started crossing the river, heading downstream.

Upstream was the territory of a wolf pack. If he carried such a large wild boar there, he would likely be surrounded by wolves. Downstream, the water was deep, inhabited by water buffaloes. It was the perfect place to slaughter the wild boar. Additionally, the presence of the buffaloes would deter the wolves from approaching.

Having thoroughly explored the entire canyon, Jian Wushuang found a cave by the pool downstream and began to slaughter the wild boar.

He divided the meat, weighing a thousand catties, preparing to make a fire during the day to cook a meal fit for a human being.

He had been eating raw fish for days, and he was nearly sick of it.

With food and a somewhat concealed dwelling, Jian Wushuang gradually forgot that he was a cultivator.

Jian Wushuang, with his unkempt beard and wild hair, looked like a savage.

However, his body had undergone significant changes.

Numerous patterns began to appear on his flesh.

Although these patterns were not very clear, based on the totem they outlined, Jian Wushuang could see the likeness of a mythical beast.

Jian Wushuang had been living here for about a year. With the first wild boar’s meat supplementing his diet, he had firmly rooted himself in this place. In a year’s time, he managed to slaughter the remaining six wild boars as well.

Now his strength had surpassed 30,000 jin.

Boom!

In the upstream waterfall, Jian Wushuangs body was bathed in the torrential waterfall, occasionally accompanied by numerous splashes hitting his body along with the water droplets..
