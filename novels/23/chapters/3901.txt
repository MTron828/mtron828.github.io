Chapter 3906: Star Demon’s Patrol

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a dark area of the Demon Dragon Field.

In the vast void, two third-level Rulers were madly fighting each other. The battle was extremely intense.

Rumble…the heaven and earth darkened, and streams of terrifying divine power wildly spread out.

After a long time, the two separated.

“Haha, Golden Armor, you and I have roamed this dark area together. We’ve met each other many times. Every time, you wanted to kill me, but in the end, you couldn’t do anything to me. You could only watch as I left. And this time, it’s the same.” A violet-haired bewitching youth stood there, he let out a hearty laugh.

“You’re formidable. In recent years, my spear techniques have improved, and my strength has also increased a bit. I thought that I could kill you, but it seems that I’m still quite lacking.” The other person was dressed in golden armor, the tall man who was like a Golden War God curled his lips and said.

“You know that you can’t kill me. In the future, don’t waste your time when you see me.” The purple-haired bewitching youth laughed and prepared to leave.

Suddenly —

“Hu!”

A loud and clear voice suddenly sounded.

“Oh? The sound of horses?” The expressions of the purple-haired bewitching youth and the golden-armored man changed.

This was the Eternal Dark Prison. How could there be horses?

Could it be…

The two of them immediately lifted their heads and looked towards the source of the horse cry. As expected, a luxurious horse carriage pulled by a pair of white horses slowly drove over.

There was a person seated on top of the luxurious horse carriage. It was a white robed white haired handsome man. This handsome man had his eyes slightly shut. His body emitted a unique and elegant aura. It was as though he was a celestial being.

Upon seeing this person, the purple-haired youth and the golden-armored man’s expressions changed drastically.

“Star Demon Ancestor!”

“It’s Star Demon Ancestor!”

Both of them turned pale with fright.

Star Demon Ancestor was one of the ten strongest monarchs in the first level of eternal prison. Furthermore, Star Demon Ancestor did not occupy a large area. It was not that he did not have the strength to occupy it, but that he was not interested. Star Demon Ancestor’s eccentricities…everyone in Eternal Darkness Prison knew about it.

He was only interested in the animals in his palm.

In addition, Star Demon Ancestor had a special title. He was publicly acknowledged as the number one evil fiend in Eternal Darkness Prison!

He was a complete psychopath and a lunatic.

He liked to turn people into animals and play with them. Any cultivator who fell into Star Demon Ancestor’s hands would suffer a fate worse than death.

In the Eternal Dark Prison, there were many people who had been captured by Star Demon Ancestor and tortured for a long time. These people hated Star Demon Ancestor to the extreme, but they were also extremely afraid of him.

For example, Demon Monarch Ancient Night, who had luckily escaped from the Eternal Dark Prison, had been captured by Star Demon Ancestor and turned into an animal. He had been tortured for a billion years, so he hated Star Demon Ancestor to the extreme, when he brought Jian Wushuang into the Eternal Dark Prison, the only condition was that Jian Wushuang would find a way to kill Star Demon Ancestor for him.

Without a doubt, Star Demon Ancestor was a well-known demon in the Eternal Dark Prison, but he could do nothing about it.

“Star Demon Ancestor, how did we meet Star Demon Ancestor?”

“Why did Star Demon Ancestor appear in the Demon Dragon Field? Could it be…Star Demon is on a patrol?”

The purple-haired youth and the golden-armored man began to tremble violently.

It was a disaster for Star Demon to be out on a patrol.

As Star Demon Ancestor liked to turn cultivators into animals to torture and tease, he would release the cultivators after he was done with them. Therefore, every once in a while, Star Demon Ancestor would go out, he would capture a large number of cultivators in the eight great domains of Eternal Darkness Prison and transform them into animals to bring back.

This was Star Demon’s patrol.

And during Star Demon’s patrol, any cultivator that Star Demon encountered would definitely be a nightmare.

As expected, when Star Demon Ancestor saw the two Rulers, he waved his hand and an invisible force instantly descended.

“It’s over!”

The purple-haired bewitching youth and the golden-armored man’s faces were pale. Their eyes were filled with terror and despair.

Although they were third-level Rulers and had lived in the eternal prison for so long, they were not weak in terms of their survival abilities. However, they could not resist Star Demon Ancestor at all.

This was because there had long been rumors in the eternal prison that if Star Demon went out on patrol, any cultivator he encountered would be captured. At the very least, they could live. If they wanted to escape, they would die!

Up until now, no one that Star Demon Ancestor had attempted to capture had ever failed.

Even Star Demon Ancestor, the strongest expert in the dark zone, could be easily captured, much less the two of them.

An invisible force descended upon the two Rulers, causing them to look at a loss. In the next moment, their bodies began to transform.

The two Rulers, who were clearly emitting monstrous auras, turned into two animals in the blink of an eye.

A rabbit and a crow.

With a slight wave of Star Demon Ancestor’s hand, the rabbit and Crow appeared in his palm out of control and were thrown into the back of the carriage.

However, when Star Demon Ancestor opened the back of the carriage, he could see that the back of the carriage was already filled with all sorts of animals. However, they were very small in size.

Clearly, Star Demon Ancestor had already captured quite a number of cultivators when he was out on patrol.

After capturing the purple-haired youth and the golden-armored man, the carriage only paused for a moment before continuing forward.

Along the way, Star Demon Ancestor took action time and time again. Any cultivator he encountered would turn into livestock or animals in the trunk of the carriage.

Half a year later, Star Demon Ancestor came to a dark corner. A thin, black-robed elder came to the front of the carriage.

“Welcome, Master.”

The black-robed elder was a third-stage Ruler, after all. Furthermore, he was publicly acknowledged as the strongest expert in this dark region. But now, he was kneeling in front of Star Demon Ancestor.

“Speak,” said Star Demon Ancestor calmly.

“Master, Blood Sword Master is currently in the 42nd Dark Zone. Furthermore, Lord Demon Dragon seems to already know of his existence. Not long ago, Lord Demon Dragon’s four experts attacked in an attempt to kill Blood Sword Master, but they failed. If nothing goes wrong, Lord Demon Dragon will likely attack personally next,” said the black-robed elder respectfully.

“Demon Dragon?”

“Haha, it’s just a small lizard. Forget about the fact that master bloodsword has yet to fall into his hands. Even if he does, if I need him, he will obediently hand master bloodsword over to me.” Star Demon Ancestor snickered, he then looked down. “You have done well in this matter. As a reward, I can reduce the time limit for you by one chaos cycle.”

“Thank you, Master.” The black-robed elder was overjoyed.

Star Demon Ancestor smiled as he drove the carriage straight toward the 42nd dark zone.
