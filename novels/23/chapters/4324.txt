4328 Starry Sky Sword Art!

Elder Fei Xian stared at Jian Wushuang. For some reason, he felt a sense of jealousy that he himself did not notice.

He was envious of Jian Wushuang’s talent. He was only at the Ultimate Ruler Realm, but he already had the power to fight with a Supreme!

He was envious of Jian Wushuang’s good fortune. He had actually obtained both the Tarot sword code and the Tarot Divine Sword at the same time. They were both universe treasures!

He was even more envious of Jian Wushuang for being protected by the Divine Life Palace and for Supreme Master Gai Fu, who had one foot in the grave, to become enemies with all the major forces in the universe for him!

!!

Elder Fei Xian took a deep breath and said coldly, “Jian Wushuang, you are not qualified to inherit the legacy of the Tarot Swordmaster.”

“The Tarot sword and the Tarot Sword Manual should not belong to you.”

“They should belong to the Starry Sky Sword Sect, to the flying immortal realm!!”

Bang!

The next moment, Elder Fei Xian clapped his right hand, and the White Phoenix divine sword immediately floated in front of him. His black hair fluttered in the wind as he said coldly, “Jian Wushuang, I admit that I’m inferior to you in terms of talent in sword principle. If you break through to the supremacy stage, I’ll definitely turn around and leave when I see you.”

“It’s a pity that if you don’t become a Ruler, you’ll still be an ant.”

Pipi pipi!

In an instant, Elder Fei Xian flicked his fingers in the void as if he was playing a lute. The White Phoenix divine sword immediately trembled violently.

Every time he flicked, the White Phoenix divine sword would split into an identical white jade flying sword. After flicking seven times, the White Phoenix divine sword had split into seven. Under Elder Fei Xian’s control, they were like seven flying rainbows that pierced through the sky, the earth, the sun, and the moon, and they slashed toward Jian Wushuang!

“Starry sky sword art, seven absolute great desolation slash!”

Buzzzzzz!

The distance of ten thousand feet was covered in a breath. In the blink of an eye, the seven white jade flying swords were like seven meteors, pressing in front of Jian Wushuang with extreme force!

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang did not dare to be careless. Divine power gushed out of his body and he used the secret skill of dragon blood. Burning his divine power, he slashed at the seven white jade flying swords!

Bang!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s aura rose sharply and he hit one of the White jade flying swords hard, sending it flying.

“Again!”

Jian Wushuang shouted and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

With every strike of his sword, the sword Qi would surge and surge, turning the surroundings into a violent and angry sea that filled the world.

Seeing this, Elder Fei Xian sneered. There seemed to be invisible threads controlling the seven white jade flying swords on the fingertips of his five fingers. Under the change of his fingers, the attack of the seven white jade flying swords suddenly changed. They no longer attacked in a big way, but instead became tricky and sinister.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang found it extremely difficult to deal with it.

“Close.”

Taking advantage of the gap, Elder Fei Xian closed his five fingers and the seven white jade flying swords immediately combined into one. They turned back into the White Phoenix divine sword and stabbed Jian Wushuang’s chest.

Pfft!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang was sent flying backward. His divine body collapsed in the void and then regenerated continuously.

Jian Wushuang retreated in defeat with one stroke!

In the distance, some of the Supreme-beings of the Divine Life Palace who were in charge of sealing off the retreat path saw this and couldn’t help but shake their heads slightly. although Jian Wushuang is strong, compared to Elder Fei Xian, who is a top sword principle expert in the universe, he is still a little too young. There is already a gap in the quality of his divine power. It is not wise to fight head-on.

Just as they were hesitating whether to help Jian Wushuang…

Jian Wushuang, who had been flying backward, suddenly stopped.

Immediately.

A golden light suddenly appeared!

“Swordsmanship, dawn!”

In an instant, Jian Wushuang disappeared and there was only a golden line left between heaven and earth. It was like a divine lightning that tore the endless night sky apart. It shot toward Elder Fei Xian with an indomitable force!

Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed!

The void was torn apart, and countless void fragments burst out.

Jian Wushuang’s entire body was covered in a golden light as he charged toward the sun, moon and stars!

this is the second move of the Tarot Sword Manual, Daybreak!!

Elder Fei Xian’s expression changed drastically when he saw this, and a sense of fear crept up his back.

For the first time, when he was facing Jian Wushuang, he felt a Great Terror of life and death!

“Dawnbreak is a sword-type divine ability that can only be used by Rulers! How did this kid know?”

His face was filled with fear, but he gritted his teeth and his eyes flashed with determination.

He had to use his trump card!

Otherwise, he would be the third Supreme to die at Jian Wushuang’s hands!

Immediately after, Elder Fei Xian’s eyes lit up, and his pupils suddenly turned into two small swords. He slowly said, “I use my sword to raise the Galaxy. The Galaxy should see me!”

“Starry swordsmanship, one sword of stars!”

BOOM! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In an instant, the stars in the sky shone brightly!

Countless forces from the depths of the stars suddenly shot up into the sky. Like meteors, they turned into bright Starlight and surged toward Elder Fei Xian!

This sword moved all the stars in the sky!

The power of countless stars shot over and converged continuously. They were so dense that they covered the sky and gathered in the hands of Elder Fei Xian.

At this moment, Elder Fei Xian’s divine body suddenly became transparent and bright. He, who was being held up by the stars, seemed to have fallen into the center of a vortex and become the master of the stars!

...

“Slash!”

Elder Fei Xian let out a loud roar, and his expression became somewhat distorted.

In an instant, a sword light condensed by the power of countless stars slashed down from Elder Fei Xian’s hand. The void was torn apart by this sword light and turned into a chaotic ocean. Countless sword Qi rolled up like a furious Dragon sweeping the sky. In the world, they formed a long pillar of sword Qi that supported the sky and the earth. It roared majestically and turned the clouds and mist within a radius of nearly 10000 miles into dust!

Bang!

In the next moment, there was a world-destroying sound as the sword hit the golden light that Jian Wushuang had turned into!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s body shook violently and the Golden daybreak sword light around him was continuously reduced.

In the end, Jian Wushuang’s daybreak sword was broken and he was sent flying again!

“Jian Wushuang, die in peace.”

Elder Fei Xian lowered his eyes and continued to attack Jian Wushuang while being condensed by the Starlight.

Jian Wushuang stared at Elder Fei Xian with an extremely gloomy expression.

Just a little more!

...

As long as he was a little stronger, Elder Fei Xian would not be his match. He would not need to rely on the power of the Tarot Divine Sword and could truly kill a Ruler!

It was a pity that he was still a little short!

Just as Jian Wushuang was considering whether to remove the Supreme seal on the Tarot Divine Sword and kill Elder Fei Xian or escape…

A white-haired cold figure suddenly swept over from the horizon. With a speed that far exceeded Elder Fei Xian’s, he stood in front of Jian Wushuang.

The next moment, the white-haired figure slowly raised his hand and grabbed at Elder Fei Xian’s sword light.
