“Holy Church of Golden Wing?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two real Gods before him.

“Regardless of whether it’s Tian Luo Star Palace or Holy Church of Golden Wing, I have never heard of either. I reckon they are some powerful forces in East Royal Sanctuary. It’s nice that they have a few Real Gods to personally attend their forces. In East Royal Sanctuary, there are countless forces of that size. How could it be compared favorably with the Lineage of Star? Jian Wushuang, you don’t have to bother with them,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang simply replied. However, he actually didn’t dare to ignore the two Real Gods.

“My friend,” Wu Chen spoke, “I know that with your talent you could totally showcase yourself in the fairies meeting and some bigger forces might take a liking to you. However, don’t forget that although the bigger forces have more resources, they have more outstanding disciples under them too. After segregation, the resources that you obtain might, in turn, be lesser. However, it’s different in Tian Luo Star Palace. For a talent like you, you would definitely be nurtured and raised with the utmost care in Tian Luo Star Palace!”

“We at the Holy Church of Golden Wing would do the same,” the purple-dressed lady, Kong Jing added too.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but smile bitterly. He replied, “I’m sorry. I appreciate your kind offers but, to be frank, I didn’t intend to join the fairies meeting. In other words, I naturally didn’t intend to join any other forces or sects. The reason why I joined the preliminary was merely because I wanted to test my Swords Principle via the Nine Boundaries Tower.”

“You didn’t intend to join any forces or sects?” Wu Cheng and Kong Jing both creased their eyebrows.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “To be honest, I have already had a master since long ago.”

“Is that so?” Wu Chen and Kong Jing exchanged a glance. They both felt disappointed.

A genius who had passed through Nine Boundaries Tower till the fourteenth floor like Jian Wushuang was definitely someone that both sects would love to have. Hence, at the moment, the two of them had received such news, they rushed over personally. However, they never expect that Jian Wushuang was a master long ago.

As he had a master, he naturally couldn’t join other sects.

Just then…

Swoosh! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A figure appeared out of nowhere above the courtyard.

“Mm?”

Jian Wushuang, Wu Chen, Kong Jing looked towards the visitor.

It was a handsome man in a loose, long robe. The handsome man looked cold as he stood there without giving out much aura. However, his star-like eyes glanced at Wu Chen and Kong Jing.

With just that one glance, the two Real Gods, Wu Chen and Kong Jing both revealed a face of terror. Their faces grew pale all of a sudden.

“I am Lei Chao!”

The handsome man spoke in a cold but soft voice. However, it caused a loud echo in Wu Chen and Kong Jing’s head.

“Lei Chao? Real God Lei Chao from Lineage of Star?”

“The expert on the Real God List!”

Wu Chen and Kong Jing were shocked. They had obviously heard Lei Chao’s name before and they clearly knew how amazing he was.

“Greetings, Mister Lei Chao!”

“Greetings, Mister.”

The two Real Gods bowed politely at the handsome man without hesitation.

They were all Real Gods but the two of them revered Lei Chao sincerely.

The handsome man Lei Chao merely glanced at them but didn’t bother with the two Real Gods. He turned to look at Jian Wushuang instead.

“You are Jian Wushuang?” Lei Chao looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Greetings, Mister Lei Chao,” Jian Wushuang also bowed politely but he wasn’t worried. He could feel the Lineage of Star’s token on Lei Chao.

“I am here to bring you back to the Lineage of Star. Be prepared, we shall leave now,” Lei Chao said calmly.

“I don’t have to prepare anything. I can leave anytime,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Lei Chao nodded and looked at the two Real Gods next to him.

The two Real Gods looked terrified and Wu Chen said, “Mister Lei Chao, the two of us didn’t know that this young man has a master. Let alone the fact that he was a disciple from the Lineage of Star. Hence, we invited him to join us. Please forgive us.”

“I saw everything that happened earlier,” Lei Chao said, “As the two of you came for him, you definitely know a bit about his ability then. Tell me.”

“This…” Wu Chen hesitated for a while before she said, “The reason why we found him was that he joined the preliminary for the fairies meeting. During the preliminary, he passed through fourteen levels in Nine Boundaries Tower and five levels in Inadvertent Dreamland. Hence, we rushed over to get him.”

“Nine Boundaries Tower? Inadvertent Dreamland?” Lei Chao raised his eyebrows, “I have heard about the two tests. A Universe God in the First Heaven passing through fourteen levels is quite impressive. However, on consciousness, although he was better than similar ranks, he still wouldn’t be considered the top.”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but smile bitterly when he heard that.

He wasn’t even in the mood to go through the test in Inadvertent Dreamland.

If he were to give his all, he might be able to pass through all seven floors in Inadvertent Dreamland.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s go,” Lei Chao didn’t say anything more.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate but followed Lei Chao.

As for Wu Chen and Kong Jing, they stood there until they saw Lei Chao left entirely. Then, the two of them finally let out a breath of relief.

“Lei Chao, he is really the top expert on the list. He is also famous in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. I can’t believe we could see him in person,” Wu Chen clasped his hands together as he spoke passionately.

“I originally planned to get this genius at all cost but was unaware that Jian Wushuang had joined Lineage of Star long ago. Lineage of Star, tsk tsk, the overlord in Purple Moon Sanctuary… they have countless geniuses. Although Jian Wushuang is amazing, he might not be the top expert in Star Palace,” Kong Jing said quietly.

“Kong Jing, I guess your effort was in vain,” Wu Chen looked over.

“Same for you, isn’t it?” Kong Jing smirked, “He’s a disciple from the Lineage of Star. Unless Tian Luo Star Palace is planning to fight for him with the Lineage of Star?”

Wu Chen shrugged. The two of them didn’t chat further but left.

In the void, Jian Wushuang moved swiftly behind Lei Chao.

“Mister Lei Chao, are we going back to Lineage of Star directly?” Jian Wushuang asked,

“I have something to take care of in East Royal Sanctuary. We will return right after. Don’t worry, it won’t take too long,” Lei Chao said.

Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows but he remained unconcerned.

Then, Jian Wushuang followed closely behind Lei Chao. The two of them took the wormhole towards another land in East Royal Sanctuary.

In one of the mansions on the land, Lei Chao brought Jian Wushuang along with him and stopped before an ancient clan.
