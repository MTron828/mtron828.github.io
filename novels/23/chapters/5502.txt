Jian Wushuang was unsure of the other party’s intentions in making such remarks, and dared not respond, only listening awkwardly.

“l truly envy you Inheritors. You possess great potential and formidable strength, unlike me, burdened with trivial matters all day long!” Wu Zuo exclaimed, almost mistaking tea for wine, as he continued to narrate his difficulties.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang, sitting beside him, shook his head in sympathy. The two of them seemed remarkably alike, facing a series of misfortunes one after another.

Wu Zuo faced continuous setbacks, with his luck only being relatively good when the Elder Palace was just established.

However, as time went on, he was burdened with all the dirty and exhausting tasks in the Northern Region. In the end, he gained little benefit, and his reputation was tarnished.

In the Elder Palace, the authority of the Hall of Enforcement couldn’t compare to the three Palace Masters. Their power was only enough to intimidate the local Emperors in the Northern Region.

Originally, he had planned to find Jian Wushuang in the Earth Realm. He planned to introduce the Transformation Dao Emperor, Broly, to Zhen Ling, and obtain significant merits. This would facilitate his pursuit of the position of Palace Master.

But what happened?

Not only did he gain little advantage, but his relationship with Emperor Lu Hua became strained upon returning to the Elder Palace. Consequently, he lacked internal support, and the election had to be postponed.

Wu Zuo was well aware that the position of Palace Master was unique. It couldn’t be obtained solely through internal support; he had to bypass the Elder Palace and directly seek Zhen Ling.

As long as Zhen Ling spoke, becoming Palace Master would be a sure thing.

However, Zhen Ling wasn’t easily deceived. He first plotted the passage to the Second Prison and then sought Zhen Ling together with the Demon Sound Divine General.

Originally, Wu Zuo thought that by exploiting this merit, he could develop the inheritance of the Demon Sound Mountain to the fullest. He could simultaneously cultivate the Inheritors, increase the treasures within the Elder Palace, and assist Zhen Ling in solving problems. In any case, he would gain numerous benefits.

But in the end, he never expected that, after making the arrangements and winning over Divine General Moyin and Lord Yun Zhong, he would end up with a face full of soot, losing everything.

After this series of events, he felt reluctant to ask for anything unless the other party had gathered all the treasures.

To compensate Jian Wushuang, he resorted to selling his own value and seeking help from others.

Although life on Jian Wushuangs side was not great, he had never lacked in treasures. When compared, Wu Zuo seemed to have a tougher time.

“Lord Wu Zuo, it seems you are not one of the revived strong ones. There is still a great chance for you to reach the peak in the future,” Jian Wushuang advised.

However, Wu Zuo shook his head; it wasn’t that easy.

Even with the guidance of Qishen, he couldn’t break through. He had passed numerous opportunities while heavily injured. If his state of mind wasn’t fulfilled, he would have collapsed long ago.

Now, he had lost much confidence in the cultivation level of Universe Master.

“These are some treasures you need. The essence of the Beast God Blood is quite special. I brought it from the Grave God Mountain. Be careful; the power contained within surpasses your imagination!” Wu Zuo carefully handed a mustard seed to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and directly accepted it, using a bit of Thought power to explore its contents.

Apart from the vial containing the blood of the Beast God, there were two 200,000 cubic universe crystals and the essence of All Things within a cubic space,

With these treasures, Jian Wushuang gained confidence.

Now, only the remaining 20 percent of the Universe Origin Source were left.

Originally, he thought Wu Zuo would play the emotional card to forego that 20 percent of the Universe Origin Source.

Unexpectedly, Wu Zuo directly handed over the 30 percent Universe Origin Source.

This surprised Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Wu Zuo, we agreed on 20 percent initially. Why this extra 10 percent?” Jian Wushuang declined.

This time, he had misjudged Wu Zuo’s intentions. He never expected Wu Zuo to give him an additional 10 percent of the Universe Origin Source.

Wu Zuo handed the jade containing the Origin Source to Jian Wushuang and said firmly, “This is my fault. Consider the extra 10 percent as compensation.

Don’t refuse.’

“Thank you, Lord!” Jian Wushuang stood up and bowed.

10 percent of the Universe Origin Source!

This 10 percent was worth his bow.

The exchange of treasures was considered completed, and Jian Wushuang unexpectedly gained something extra, making him quite happy.

Originally, he was worried about being too courteous and having the upper hand, but now he felt unrestrained. He ate what he wanted and drank what he pleased.

Seeing Jian Wushuang let down his guard, a smile appeared on Wu Zuo’s face, but deep down, he felt quite distressed.

He was not originally wealthy, and the additional 10 percent of the Universe Origin Source made his situation even worse.

“Jian Wushuang, from now on, don’t address me so formally. I’m easygoing and don’t care for such titles!” Wu Zuo smiled and said gently.

Jian Wushuang was momentarily stunned, feeling that something was not quite right.

“In the future, if you regard me highly, just call me ‘Big Brother!” Wu Zuo said with great enthusiasm.

This statement made Jian Wushuang a bit uneasy, and he quickly declined,

“How can that be? Lord Wu Zuo is a disciple of Qishen. We can’t be peers!”

Leaving aside such formalities, in terms of strength, he was far inferior to Wu Zuo. The latter was a supreme-peak powerhouse and even stronger than Bai Junwang.

When Wu Zuo had come to rescue him, his mere avatar could rival a supreme-peak powerhouse.

His true strength was probably comparable to Divine General Moyin.

Seeing Jian Wushuangs hesitation, Wu Zuo waved his hand and said tactfully, “Let’s just treat each other as equals, regardless of those titles!”

“Big Brother!” Jian Wushuang raised his teacup with a determined expression.

Seeing this, Wu Zuo also lifted his teacup, his eyes shining as he responded, “Second Brother! ”

The two of them drank merrily. Wu Zuo waved his hand and called, “Servant!”

Immediately, a red-clad female Emperor, with the aura of a tier 5 Emperor, appeared and respectfully said, “My lord!”

“Go, bring all the fine wines I have stored!” Wu Zuo declared with great boldness.

The wines he had stored were undoubtedly of considerable value.

The two of them exchanged cups and engaged in conversation.

This time, Jian Wushuang truly broadened his horizons, gaining a deeper understanding of the ancient era.

For instance, the Moro Temporal Space from ancient times still existed, not having burst into fragments and perished.

There were also some matters concerning the Three Kings Court.

The Three Kings Court was indeed a peak power in its time, once contending with the Qishen Temple.

However, later on, the Qishen surpassed them by too much, forcing the Three Kings Court to withdraw its influence.

Fortunately, Qishen did not annihilate them completely, leaving behind some territory for the Three Kings Court.

However, later events, particularly the appearance of a giant egg, led to the destruction of the Three Kings Court.

If it weren’t for the fact that the Qishen dispatched someone to suppress Fuego in the end, the Three Kings Court might have been completely wiped out, without even a trace of legacy.

This time, with the opening in the Qishen Temple, the inheritance of the Three Kings found its rightful place.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t be certain about the Soul Dao Origin Source, but he was certain that the Dao of Transformation had fallen into Brolys hands.

The inheritance of the Three Kings belonged to the inheritance of the top Universe Master. Apart from the legacies of the three major Divine Masters and the Qishen itself, there were no legacies more powerful than these three inheritances..
