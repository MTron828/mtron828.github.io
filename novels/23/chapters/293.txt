Chapter 294: The Unexpected Trouble

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Swish!

Sitting by the lake, Jian Wushuang raised the fishing rod and pulled a big carp out of the water. He took the fish off the fishhook and put it in his basket.

The two men standing behind him were Tai Shan and Mo Ying. They had been on good terms with Jian Wushuang since his time in the ninth team, and they had been by his side ever since Jian Wushuang became the First Protector of the Heartless Sect.

“Protector, you got a big haul today,” Tai Shan said with a smile.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Looking up into the sky, he continued, “It’s getting late. Let’s go back.”

He stood up, carried the rod on his shoulder, and then headed toward the Heartless City with Tai Shan and Mo Ying.

Before they had gotten far, Jian Wushuang suddenly stared up into the air, where a figure was rapidly rushing forward. From the looks of it, it was a thin young girl.

“Oh, no. They’re catching up with me, but it will be some time before sister arrives. What should I do?”?The small figure was running as fast as she could, as if she was escaping from some horrible thing. Just then she noticed Jian Wushuang and the others below.

Her eyes glinted as she dived toward them.

“You three there, help! help!” Yelled the small figure that was crying while flying.

“Stop right there!” Tai Shan and Mo Ying stepped in front of Jian Wushuang and stopped the girl.

“You little beggar, get out of our way!” Tai Shan shouted coldly.

Jian Wushuang studied the girl.

It was not an overstatement to call the girl a beggar.

Clothes tattered, hair scattered, and muddied all over. This 15 or 16-year-old girl looked much like a beggar.

But Jian Wushuang, Tai Shan, and Mo Ying all understood that in the Tang Dynasty, the Country of Death, even a beggar could be a strong expert.

Moreover, this dirty girl came to them while Voidwalking, which meant she was not an ordinary expert.

“Please, some people are chasing me. Please hold them off for a moment. Here, I got this Interspatial Ring from a Half-saint expert, and I’ll give it to you as long as you help me,” The little girl begged.

Raising his eyebrows, Jian Wushuang subconsciously looked at the Interspatial Ring, and through his consciousness, he saw lots of treasures and Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid inside.

“It’s true,” Jian Wushuang said with an odd expression.

There was a large amount of treasures and Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid in the ring, comparable to all the property that one Half-saint expert would normally own. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

What confused Jian Wushuang was how this little girl had gotten the ring from a Half-saint expert.

Jian Wushuang didn’t respond to the girl’s request. He stared off into the distant sky, where a dozen people were rushing toward them.

“They’re coming!” The girl looked frightened.

Quickly, those people arrived in the air above them, with a black-clothed elder as their leader.

“A Half-saint.”?Jian Wushuang’s expression changed a little when he saw the elder.

Led by a Half-saint, even every single man of the group was at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

It was very rare to see such a battle formation in Skywave Prefecture.

The black-clothed elder looked down and his eyes immediately fell on the little girl.

“Boy, give that girl to us,” The elder shouted.

Jian Wushuang glanced at him and said, “She is right there, get her if you want to. We have no business here.”

“Oh?” The elder lifted his eyebrow.

“Let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said to Tai Shan and Mo Ying, starting to head back, not even sparing a second glance at the little girl or the elder.

Tai Shan and Mo Ying followed him.

“You...” The girl became anxious, but she suddenly had an idea and shouted, “Hey, how could you just leave me alone like this after I gave you that treasure.”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

Sure enough, upon hearing the girl’s words, the elder swooped down and blocked Jian Wushuang’s way.

“Boy, she gave it to you?” The elder asked coldly.

“No,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Liar! You promised me that you would stop them if I gave that treasure to you, and I did. But now, seeing they’re strong, you chickened out.” The girl pretended to be angry.

“Boy, hand it over!” The elder yelled.

“I won’t say it again. She didn’t give me anything.” Coldness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Didn’t she?” The elder sneered. “Well then, you three, give me your Interspatial Rings and let me check through them. I’ll let you go if it’s not in them.”

“Check my Interspatial Ring?” Jian Wushuang gave him a smile as chilling as a blade. “I’m afraid you are in no position to do that.”

“You are courting death!”

Shouting, the elder started moving and crossed the distance between them in an instant. An explosive sound was heard as the space in front of Jian Wushuang shattered, and a palm containing a powerful force aimed for Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang was provoked.

“Piss off!”

Not bothering to use his sword, Jian Wushuang clenched his hand into a fist. Terrifying power was gathered inside it, and then it was thrown at the elder.

This blow, containing the power of the World Origin, caused the whole area to tremble.

Boom!

The elder was blown away by the power and was forced to retreat a few hundred meters before he regained his balance.

“How can this be possible?”

The elder was shocked.

“He is just in the Profound Yang Void Realm...” While the elder was thinking, a name emerged in his mind.

“In the Profound Yang Void Realm, Long Sword on his back, quite young, you’re Swordsman?” The elder called out.

Even though Jian Wushuang was only in the Profound Yang Void Realm, he was ranked 86th on the Bloodmoon List, which made him somewhat famous. As soon as the elder learned of Jian Wushuang’s strength, he recognized him immediately.

“Now that you know who you’re fighting with, why don’t you piss off with your men right now?” Mo Ying shouted.

“Humph, Swordsman.” Looking gloomy, the elder turned to Jian Wushuang and said, “I know that you have won some fame in the Skywave Prefecture, but I didn’t know that you had the nerve to stick your hand in the business of the Mansion Master.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help squinting.
