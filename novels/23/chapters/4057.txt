Chapter 4058: The Purple-Blood Secret Manual

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“My friend Blood Sword, Lord Xiao asked us to bring the first volume of the Purple Blood Secret Manual to you. He also asked me to tell you that he looks forward to your growth,” the Three Winged Ruler said with a smile.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang looked strange, but he began to hesitate in his heart.

If the first volume of the Purple Blood Secret Manual was given to him by the Divine King Palace, Jian Wushuang would not accept it.

But now it was a personal gift from Lord Xiao…

It would be fine if he did not have any relationship with Lord Xiao, but in fact, he had already received guidance from Lord Xiao when he was in the Principle Sea. It could be said that he had already received a favor from Lord Xiao.

!!

Now, Lord Xiao had only done him a great favor, and it was obvious that Lord Xiao had given him a gift on a whim. He had not expected Lord Xiao to repay him in the future.

After all, the Three Winged Ruler had said that Lord Xiao was one of the most powerful figures in the divine imperial palace. He was extremely powerful even amongst Rulers, and was very likely a supreme-being.

Although he was talented, he was still very weak. How could a supreme-being like Lord Xiao seek his reward?

“In that case, please thank Lord Xiao for me,” Jian Wushuang said.

It was obvious that he had accepted the gift.

“That’s more like it,” the Three Winged Ruler said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang also smiled faintly, in his heart, he thought, “Anyway, I’ve already owed Lord Xiao a favor in the Principle Sea. Now, I just owe him an even bigger favor. If I can break through to the supreme-being level and reach the top of the vast universe, I’ll find a way to repay it. But if I can’t reach that level, then I have no other choice.”

“Blood Sword, the first volume of the Purple Blood Secret Manual has been given to you. The three of us will take our leave now,” the Three Winged Ruler said.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang thanked him.

Soon, the Three Winged Ruler left, and Jian Wushuang returned to the universe boat. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As soon as he returned to the universe boat, Leng Rushuang and Devil Flame immediately came up to him.

“Husband, what did the Ruler just say to you?” Leng Rushuang asked.

Jian Wushuang briefly recounted what he had just said to the Three Winged Ruler.

After hearing it, both Leng Rushuang and Devil Flame were a little dumbfounded.

“The Purple Blood Secret Manual, a secret manual calculated by millions of origin stones?” Leng Rushuang was extremely shocked.

“A million universe origin stones, the wealth of an expert at the supreme level, is nothing more than that,” Devil Flame added.

“The value is amazing, and it’s a personal gift from Lord Xiao. I have no reason to refuse it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ruler, you don’t have to refuse. There are countless experts in the vast universe, but how many of them haven’t received favors from others during their rise to power? Who Hasn’t received help from others? There are some who have grown up on their own and have no friends, but how many of them have?”

“Besides, Lord Xiao is just looking forward to your growth and helping you. It’s a favor, but if you grow up in the future, you can return it to him,” Devil Flame said.

“I think so too.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Let’s not talk about it. I’ll study the Purple Blood Secret Manual first.”

…

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in a secret chamber in the universe boat. In front of him was the big box, in which 36 square crystal jades were placed neatly.

Jian Wushuang picked up the first crystal jade.

As his consciousness sank in, a vast message was transmitted to Jian Wushuang in an instant.

The message of the first crystal jade was not the combination of the universe principle and the sword principle origin, but just some basic use of the universe principle. Even so, Jian Wushuang’s head buzzed, it was as if he had entered a brand new world in an instant.

Indeed, as he received the information of the first crystal jade, a brand new door was placed in front of him.

It should be known that he did not know anything about the use of the universal principle before. He only knew how to integrate the universal principle into his attacks and increase the power of his attacks.

But now, even the most superficial and simple use of the universe principles was enough for Jian Wushuang to gain enlightenment.

Time passed. After a full hour, Jian Wushuang finally received all the information in the first crystal jade.

But after receiving it, his mind became confused.

“This is only the first crystal jade, but I can only understand the information at the beginning. I can’t immediately use the principles after that.” Jian Wushuang shook his head, then he began to receive the second crystal jade’s information.

The second crystal jade contained even more information. It was only at this point that he began to talk about the combination of universal principles and sword principle.

“It’s actually a cover-up?” Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes.

“I always thought that the combination of universal principles and sword principle should have a primary and secondary distinction. If it’s not dominated by the universal principles or sword principle, in fact, the universal principles and sword principle are controlled by one’s own consciousness. The universal principles are profound and unfathomable, and the level of comprehension is like the number of an army. The same is true for sword principle, but one’s own consciousness is definitely the absolute soul and the existence of a general.”

“Consciousness dominates the universal principle, and comprehension of sword principle is a perfect combination.”

With a smile on his face, Jian Wushuang continued to accept and comprehend.

There were three volumes of the Purple Blood Secret Manual. Each volume had a total of 36 crystal jades, and 12 of them were in the first realm. In other words, the creator of the Purple Blood Secret Manual…the combination of sword principle and universal principle was divided into nine realms. Jian Wushuang needed to completely comprehend the information in the first 12 crystal jades in order to reach the first realm.

But in fact, Jian Wushuang was so confused that he could not comprehend the first piece of crystal jades, let alone the other ones.

However, what surprised Jian Wushuang was that the use of universal principle and sword principle were divided in detail by the pieces of crystal jades in the Purple Blood Secret Manual. It could be said that the whole process of using universal principle and sword principle were combined, it was a complete analysis.

This made it much easier for Jian Wushuang to understand and comprehend.

It was also much easier to get started.

For example, it only took Jian Wushuang 30 years to completely comprehend the first crystal jade.

Then he continued to comprehend the second crystal jade. The second crystal jade took much longer than the first one, but it took less than 200 years.

The third crystal jade took Jian Wushuang 600 years —

In a flash, another 30,000 years passed.
