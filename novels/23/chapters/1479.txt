Chapter 1480: Jian Wushuang On The First Level

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, I heard that you fought Blood Emperor again? And you were so well-matched?” Fiery King asked casually.

“Yeah, we were. But if you were to describe it as well-matched, it’d be too forceful. In terms of power, Blood Emperor is stronger than I,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The earlier battle looked as though they were well-matched, but Jian Wushuang knew clearly that Blood Emperor was one notch above him during the fight.

“Don’t be humble. Blood Emperor admitted himself that your power is not inferior to his,” Fiery King said.

“Er…” Jian Wushuang kept quiet.

“Oh yeah, you’re still in Darkness Mountain, right?” Fiery King asked again.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang responded.

“I just received an update. Blood Emperor sent a message to the expert under his command for them to leave Darkness Mountain,” Fiery King said.

“They left?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“What else can they do besides leaving?” Fiery King scoffed, “You’re obviously hunting them down. Even Real God Huan Yu on the second level died in your hands, the Real Gods and Universe God in Darkness Mountain are naturally afraid of you. Plus, your consciousness probing measure is so impressive. No matter how well they hide themselves in Darkness Mountain, they will be found by you. Under such circumstances, unless one has a death wish, why would they dare to stay back?”

Jian Wushuang understood then.

“If these Real Gods were to leave Darkness Mountain and hide in every corner in Sky Sword Prison, Sky Sword Prison covers a large expanse and even I would find it difficult to find them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“True,” Fiery King smiled.

“However, as they are already hiding from me, forget about them. Anyway, those who found trouble with me three thousand years ago weren’t just Blood Emperor alone,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What do you mean? Would you be considering the experts under the command of Heartless?” Fiery King said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “Three thousand years ago, Heartless King came to assist Blood Emperor in killing me. Then, I already killed five Real Gods under Blood Emperor’s command. As for Heartless King, how can I just let her simply avoid it? I’ll go to her territory to carry out a massacre and take revenge on her.”

“Jian Wushuang, Heartless King is different from Blood Emperor. Her consciousness attack is extremely strong. Are you confident that you can deal with her?” Fiery King said.

“Don’t worry. As I dare to visit her territory, I am definitely confident,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Consciousness attack… The attack that Jian Wushuang feared the least was a consciousness attack.

After all, he lit up his Soul Power. Even though his soul strength only had the limit of Universe God, his soul endurance power was far more impressive compared to Real God.

After they ended the communication link, Jian Wushuang immediately departed to where Heartless King’s territory was.

He arrived at Heartless King’s territory and started a massacre again.

The time flew past…

In Sky Sword Prison, in-between two remote mountains, there was an exquisite purple pavilion.

In the pavilion, there were two figures seated at a long, narrow table with wine and delicacies.

The two figures, a man and a woman, were both young and both Universe Gods.

Universe God Tian Feng and Universe God Gu Tong were the other two most famous Universe Gods in Sky Sword Prison besides Jian Wushuang.

On top of that, they were also known as monstrous.

There were many prisoners in Sky Sword Prison. Excluding Jian Wushuang, there were only twenty-eight people on the second level. Among the twenty-eight, there were twenty-six Real Gods, while the remaining two were Universe Gods, who were the two before him.

At that very moment, Universe God Tian Feng and Universe God Gu Tong were drinking as they chatted leisurely.

“Tian Feng, have you heard about what happened in Heartless Land recently?” Universe God Gu Tong asked.

“Such a major incident, it spread all over Sky Sword Prison so tumultuously. Of course, I know,” Universe God Tian Feng smiled and continued, “Speaking of which, Jian Wushuang is pretty amazing. He first visited Blood Emperor’s Darkness Mountain and killed five Real Gods. Then, he went to Heartless King’s Heartless Land and killed two Real Gods. Among the Real Gods who were killed, there were some who were on the second level. They died by his hand anyway.”

Then, Universe God Tian Feng was impressed too.

He was Universe God himself. Under the circumstances of their divine power being restrained in Sky Sword Prison, he could also kill a Real God who was weak as Real God Huo Yuan.

However, if he were to run into Real Gods on the second level, he could only be evenly matched at most.

However, Jian Wushuang could kill Real Gods on the second level. He was obviously much stronger than him. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I heard that Heartless King took action personally. She even performed her strongest master stroke, Life and Death Ninth Heaven, but it didn’t cause any effect to him,” Universe God Gu Tong exclaimed.

“Life and Death Ninth Heaven?” Universe God Tian Feng looked shocked, “That’s a terrifying dreamland. With Heartless King’s capability, if she were to perform it with her all, besides the three Kings and a few Real Gods on the top of the second level, theoretically, there shouldn’t be anyone else who could withstand the attack in Sky Sword Prison. But this Jian Wushuang… A Universe God can withstand that attack. I wonder why his consciousness is that strong?”

Both Universe God Tian Feng and Universe God Gu Tong were fearful of Heartless King’s strongest master stroke.

Although both of their fighting powers could be compared favorably to Real God on the second level, they were Universe Gods after all. Their consciousness strength was merely on the level of a Universe God’s limit.

If they were to run into Heartless King… Heartless King need not perform her strongest master stroke, they reckoned that any of her random consciousness attacks could kill them both.

“Heartless King and Blood Emperor both took action against him but they couldn’t do anything to Jian Wushuang. Naturally, no one could stop him from carrying out a massacre. Plus, Jian Wushuang was an accomplished Universe God in terms of his consciousness-probing ability. As long as he swept with his consciousness, no one could hide or conceal their aura under his watch. Hence, the experts under the command of both Kings were terrified and they left Darkness Mountain and Heartless Land to hide in the corners of Sky Sword Prison.”

“We are all Universe Gods. Both of us are known as monstrous too. However, compared to Jian Wushuang, the difference is so vast.”

“With his capabilities, it shouldn’t be long until he reaches the criteria needed to leave Sky Sword Prison.”

“Yeah, I’m jealous of him.”

Universe God Tian Feng and Universe God Gu Tong sighed emotionally as they were both envious of Jian Wushuang.

Then, in Sky Sword Prison, there were people who secretly listed Jian Wushuang on the first level. In other words, he was on the same level as the four Kings. But no one dared to call Jian Wushuang the fifth King.

It was because everyone could tell that Jian Wushuang wouldn’t stay in Sky Sword Prison for long.

He had already killed the seventh Real God by then and he could totally continue to massacre and kill ten Real Gods. It would definitely be very easy.
