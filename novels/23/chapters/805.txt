Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Inside the shop, Lei Yun sat quietly, next to a mysterious elder in a black robe.

This mysterious elder had a peculiar aura, as if he was not there at all.

As for Su Ming, he sat at the bottom with some constraint.

“Jian Wushuang and my disciple are sworn enemies. Although he failed to assassinate my disciple last time, he will never give up. With his temper, he will find a way to carry out assassination again. My disciple will just stay here for the time being. If Jian Wushuang comes, please help us, Mr. Wu,” Lei Yun said, looking at that mysterious elder.

“Rest assured, Elder Lei. I’ll keep my promise. What’s more, we are both in Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. We should help each other,” that elder smiled.

All of a sudden, he looked up with a brow arched, and said, “He has come.”

“So soon?” Lei Xin’s face lit up with pleasure while Su Ming felt nervous inside.

Lei Xin asked the mysterious elder, Mr. Wu for help not only because he was formidable, but also because his psychic ability was extraordinary.

Neither Lei Xin nor Su Ming noticed Jian Wushuang’s approach, but Mr. Wu did.

“Oh, this boy is very careful. Instead of rushing closer, he lingered nearby,” Mr. Wu laughed.

Lei Xin looked closely at him.

After a moment, Mr. Wu’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. “He has lingered for so long? It seems that he has no intention of taking action. He just wants to make sure whether your disciple is in this shop,” he said.

“He has no intention of taking action?” Lei Xin repeated Mr. Wu’s words with a nod.

“Knowing I’m here, it would have been odd if Jian Wushuang had acted without scruple,”?he thought.

“Eh?” Mr. Wu’s brows suddenly rose in surprise.

“What’s going on?” Lei Xin asked anxiously at once. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“He seems to have given up. He is ready to leave.” Mr. Wu laughed.

“Leave?” Lei Xin’s face became hard. “Humph, now that he has come on his own initiative, how could I let him leave?” he said coldly.

“Mr. Wu, please join me to kill him!”

Lei Xin let out a low shout. Then, a mighty air rose violently from him, and he instantly turned into a Purple Thunderbolt, flying out of the shop.

At the same moment that Lei Xin moved, the black-robed Mr. Wu smiled faintly before darting out.

Both men took action simultaneously and Su Ming was left alone in the shop.

BOOM! BOOM!

Two gales of terrifying auras suddenly burst out like a bright beacon in the night.

Wandering around the shop, Jian Wushuang noticed them immediately.

“Damn it, I’m exposed!”

Jian Wushuang looked a little worried and then darted straight into a dark void in the distance without hesitation.

“Young man, you want to run away? I won’t give you any more chances to escape,” Lei Xin roared.

Having nailed his eyes on Jian Wushuang, he pursued Jian Wushuang together with Mr. Wu.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three figures, one running ahead and two chasing after. They were moving so fast that they disappeared into the night sky soon after.

Witnessing Lei Xin and Mr. Wu disappear from sight, Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Body who had been hiding in another void, revealed a cold smile on his face.

The next moment, a seven-feet scarlet sword, like a sea of blood, appeared in his hand.

It was the Blood Mountain Sword that Jian Wushuang’s Master had given him!

BUZZ…

Jian Wushuang’s Bloodline Power burst forth. Seconds later, his Slaughter Body turned into a 15-meter Gold-armored Ancient God.

The Gold-armored Ancient God held the Blood Mountain Sword, which was 12 meters now, in one hand. His ice cold eyes exuded endless rage, and stared at the shop where Su Ming was.

“Su Ming, no one can save you this time.”

Jian Wushuang howled in a deep voice. Then he made a great leap, and his giant body appeared before the shop. He brandished his long sword and cut mercilessly across the shop.

A huge sword shadow emerged, like another bright moon in the night, and was incomparably dazzling.

SWISH!

The sword light erupted into raging power, and shattered the whole shop directly.

Su Ming and some experts of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion in the shop turned pale at the sudden attack. They sprang out into the nearby void.

But upon reaching the void, they saw a giant Gold-armored Ancient God with a terrifying aura in front of them.

The size and aura of this Gold-armored Ancient God were so overwhelming that at the first sight of it, those experts felt terrified.

“It’s Jian, Jian Wushuang!”

Su Ming stared fixedly at the Gold-armored Ancient God, who was also glaring fiercely at him.

“No, this couldn’t be!”

“You are clearly being pursued by my Master and Mr. Wu. How could you possibly be here?”

“How could this be?”

Su Ming was completely lost.

Jian Wushuang was too lazy to explain and gave him a snort of contempt. Then he raised his Blood Mountain Sword and struck at Su Ming.

The horrifying Sword Essence covered Su Ming in an instant. As a superior Divine Realm expert, he was powerless to resist Jian Wushuang’s attack.

“No, don’t kill me!”

Su Ming was horrified and frantically growled and shouted.

The fear of death was all that remained in his mind at this point.

He didn’t want to die!

“Humph, kill you?”

“Rest assured, I won’t kill you!”

“Not only will I not kill you, I will do everything I can to make you live longer. I’ll make you live for 10,000 years, 100,000 years, or even 1,000,000 years!”

“Now that you’re in my hands, I will let you know how lucky it will be to be dead!”

Jian Wushuang had a ferocious look on his face. The Blood Mountain Sword he had swung at Su Ming abruptly changed.

It was a huge scarlet Sword of Killing, like a boundless sea of blood, but the next moment, it transformed into a giant towering mountain.

That mountain came down from the sky and came straight at Su Ming.

“Sword Mountain, Suppression!”

With a flash of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, he launched the Secret Skill of Suppression attached to Blood Mountain Sword.

BUZZ… A black hole suddenly appeared in the bottom of the giant mountain, and mysterious cracks from the black hole swept out, blocking the sky and the sun, instantly forming a great Spell Formation.

Su Ming was completely trapped in the Spell Formation, and was horrified to find that he could not move at all.

He watched helplessly as the Spell Formation shrank and so did himself.

In the end, both the Spell Formation and he were completely engulfed by the black hole.
