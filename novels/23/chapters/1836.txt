Chapter 1837: Breaking A Piece of Dead Wood

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Power itself is already so fierce. Just how scary can the speed would be?” Emperor God Bing Can couldn’t help but think.

He had just thought about it when he got to experience it the next moment.

The two Hong Jun Golden Swords that were pushed back from the impact quivered then came in front of him again like electric arcs.

The distance of tens of thousands of miles was almost instantly pierced by the two Hong Jun Golden Swords.

“Too fast,” Emperor God Bing Can stared and the saber in his hands was swung out again.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There were continuous clashes. Every single clash contained terrifying power that made Emperor God Bing Can retreat. Just as he steadied himself, Hong Jun Golden Swords flew over again. They didn’t give him any chance to gasp for air.

He had already gone all out, but under the continuous attacks of the two Hong Jun Golden Swords, he constantly retreated. Under continuous hits, his divine body was constantly attacked and his injuries constantly worsen.

“Emperor God Bing Can, I came to help you.”

There was a loud roar and a white-robed elderly appeared with a sword that suddenly increased in size like a lofty mountain and pressed towards Jian Wushuang.

The white-robed elderly was a Peak Sir God himself. When he performed the stroke with his all, the power was sufficient to move an ordinary Emperor God.

However, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold at the sight.

“Go away!”

Jian Wushuang spat coldly and sent a palm in the direction of the white-robed elderly.

The palm seemed to contain the entire reincarnation. It instantly collided with the sword directly.

There was a loud bang and the sword flew off, along with the white-robed elderly who turned into a flowing light. As the white-robed elderly flew off, he was spitting blood and his aura grew dispirited.

A top Sir God broke down under Jian Wushuang’s palm.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, don’t let those Sir Gods interrupt me,” Jian Wushuang glanced at Emperor God Jiu Ying in the void from afar.

“I tried my best,” Emperor God Jiu Yin smiled bitterly.

Although he was an Emperor God, he had to fight with eleven Sir Gods with four Dao soldiers. Among the eleven Sir Gods, there were a few top Sir Gods. Although he wasn’t afraid, the other party’s headcount was higher. He had no choice if there were one or two Sir Gods who had the time to interrupt the battle on the other side.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang stared at Emperor God Bing Can in front of him coldly.

The white-robed elderly interrupted and gave Emperor God Bing Can a chance to pant.

Then…

Hong!

There was an unprecedented chilliness that swept out from Emperor God Bing Can. Emperor God Bing Can’s face grew red and the chilliness formed into a storm and swept out.

“Are you going all-out now?” Jian Wushuang’s expression grew cold. When he saw Emperor God Bing Can’s aura soar, his summoned his willpower and there was a golden light that instantly burst out in silence.

“Go, go away!”

Emperor God Bing Can’s eyes grew red as he swung the saber in his hand.

Dang! Dang!

There were two clashes and the two Hong Jun Golden Sword flew off from the impact. Emperor God Bing Can’s body retreated. Vroom! Another strange golden light appeared in front of him on the way.

“The third one?” Emperor God Tian Can stared.

He didn’t know Jian Wushuang had nine Hong Jun Golden Swords. The higher his comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine, the more Hong Jun Golden Swords he could use.

Previously, Jian Wushuang’s comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine had stopped at the peak of level six. Hence, he was limited to using two Hong Jun Golden Swords. But then…

Jian Wushuang had received countless opportunities and benefits from the six thousand years on the ancient battlefield. In terms of power, the one with the most improvement was Spacetime Doctrine!!!

He of course could perform the third Hong Jun Golden Sword then.

“D*mn?it!” Emperor God Tian Can’s face grew grave.

Merely two Hong Jun Golden Swords had already brought about great stress and he was pathetically suppressed even when he gave his all. Then, there was another one?

How could he resist?

“Jian Wushuang’s power definitely isn’t at the level of an ordinary Peak Emperor God!” Emperor God Tian Can roared in anger and his figure retreated.

“You want to flee? You don’t stand a chance,” there was billowing murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. There was a bolt of Spacetime power that permeated the air.

“Secret Skill of Ancient God, Moon Picking Skill!”

Vroom. The entire universe and the entire spacetime was pressing towards Emperor God Tian Can mercilessly.

Emperor God Tian Can’s figure was instantly restricted by the boundless pressure and his speed diminished greatly. Even the actions of his hand became difficult.

The three golden lights were like three death curses. They continuously plunged over at high speed.

“No!”

Emperor God Tian Can let out an unwilling roar and barely raised his hand to resist one Hong Jun Golden Sword, but the other two hit his skull and his chest respectively.

The armor on the surface of his body activated its power but it was an armor at the level of Chaotic Divine Treasure after all. Its defense power was limited and he was hit directly.

The sight struck many surrounding experts.

“Dead? Emperor God Tian Can was killed?”

“How did it happen so quickly?”

“It has only been a short while.”

Many Sir Gods were gawking in disbelief.

They knew that Emperor God Tian Can was definitely not Jian Wushuang’s match. However, there shouldn’t be any problem for him to hold Jian Wushuang back.

But in the end, how long had it taken?

From the explosion of the war until then, it was slow in words but in actual fact, it had only been a short while, like twenty breaths’ time.

Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Swords had only hit a dozen times. In such a short timespan, Emperor God Tian Can was killed by Jian Wushuang?

It was like breaking a piece of dead wood.?It was definitely an easy kill.

To be able to kill the other party so quickly, just how huge was their difference in power?

“Sword Emperor…”

Even Emperor God Liu Guang by the side was looking at Jian Wushuang in shock.

She knew of Emperor God Tian Can’s power. Even if she were to kill him, she would require more time. To do it so smoothly and cleanly, like breaking a piece of dead wood, she couldn’t do it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“The three golden lights… are Hong Jun Golden Swords that made him gain fame, right? He could perform three of them. Every one equals a hit by a Peak Emperor God and the speed is so swift. In addition to the Secret Skill of Ancient God, Moon Picking Skill, it is really difficult to run away from him,” Emperor God Liu Guang complimented and acknowledged Jian Wushuang’s power.

“Maybe he isn’t as strong as I am. He is definitely much stronger than Fortress Master Hong Tian. Even if he were to compare to the Master of Star Palace, I reckon their powers wouldn’t be far apart.”

“In terms of hunting power, he is much stronger than I, the Master of Star Palace and also Fortress Master Hong Tian!!”
