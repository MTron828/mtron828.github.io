Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Yes, there were two Jian Wushuangs before their eyes.

In fact, The two Jian Wushuangs they saw were his Slaughter Body and World Body. The former had chased after Holy Ancestor with the Heart-killing Sword, while the later had gone after Stone Ancestor with the Triple-kill Sword.

“What?”

“This can’t be real.”

The escaping Holy Ancestor and Stone Ancestor looked grave when they saw the two Jian Wushuangs.

They had thought that at least one of them could make it out alive if they kept running in different directions. But now, there were two Jian Wushuangs chasing after them.

“Holy Ancestor, you’re dead!”

Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Body shouted when he caught up with Holy Ancestor with his higher speed and launched an attack.

“I’m dead!”

Holy Ancestor looked desperate. He knew he no longer had any chance surviving.

He tried to struggle, but Jian Wushuang killed him in an instant.

As for Jian Wushuang’s World Body, he caught up with Stone Ancestor as well but did not kill him directly.

“Jian Wushuang.” Stone Ancestor looked at Jian Wushuang’s World Body in horror.

“Stone Ancestor.” Jian Wushuang gazed back coldly and asked, “Where is your disciple Jiu Xiu?”

Jiu Xiu, the person who had seized Jian Wushuang’s father’s Sword Soul and taken away his mother.

Jian Wushuang had cursed this name a hundred times, but to his confusion, he had not heard of this person even once after he entered Divine Land.

He had expected that Jiu Xiu would join the feast with Stone Ancestor, but Jiu Xiu was not there.

“If I tell you, will you let me go?” Stone Ancestor asked while staring at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes became chilling. Without saying a word, he approached Stone Ancestor and struck out.

Stone Ancestor was scared as he hurried to defend, but he still got hit. He began spitting blood as his face became extremely pale.

“Look, you are in no position to bargain with me. Just tell me where Jiu Xiu is, and maybe I’ll spare your life. Otherwise, I’ll kill you now.” Jian Wushuang warned in a low voice.

His eyes filled with despair. Stone Ancestor was one of the top experts in the Divine Land, but now he was in a desperate situation and he wasn’t even able to decide his own fate.

“Fine. I’ll tell you what you want to know, but I hope you will keep your word.” Stone Ancestor continued in a deep voice, “Jiu Xiu left the Divine Land several years ago and he might have even left the Ancient World. I really have no idea where he is now.”

“Left the Ancient World?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “No one can leave the Ancient World at will. If that was possible then you would not have fought so crazily for the Ancient World Token in order to leave here. You’re lying.”

“No, I’m not.”

Stone Ancestor shook his head. “It’s true that he has probably left the Ancient World because of some connections he made after he caught a certain woman.”

“A woman?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed.

He doubted that the woman was his mother.

He had been told that his mother had left Ancient World. She had probably been forced to leave with Jiu Xiu.

“If I’m right, then, where are they now?”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He did not know the answer, but, his father seemed to.

In order to see his mother again, his father had stepped on a path of no return.

A path that even Di Jing was scared to walk. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I’m too powerless and probably nothing in the eyes of the people in the outside world. I have to leave the Ancient World and enhance my power so that I can look for my mother,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

A moment later, killing intent filled his eyes as he looked at Stone Ancestor.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang attacked him without restraint.

“Bastard! Jian Wushuang, you broke your promise!” Stone Ancestor shouted in fright.

However, Jian Wushuang did not seem to hear his words. Even though his World Body was less powerful than his Slaughter Body by a bit, it took him no effort to kill Stone Ancestor.

He looked down at Stone Ancestor’s body and spoke out sarcastically.

“Broke my promise?

“Humph. I’ll always keep my word to my family and friends, but never to an enemy.

How ridiculous of you to expect me, your enemy, to keep my word!”

Jian Wushuang laughed, then smashed the body before going back to the feast.

In the sky above the Martial Arts Practice Field, the two Jian Wushuangs merged into one under the watchful eyes of everyone after they killed their targets.

Jian Wushuang had wanted to hide this skill from others, but considering that few in the Ancient World could be his match at the moment, he did not mind exposing it.

When Jian Wushuang arrived back at the feast, he found Spirit Ancestor and said to him, “Spirit Ancestor, thank you so much. You’re the one who helped Sword Marquis Mansion survive over the years. Both me and our mansion, even the whole of Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline, owe you a big favor. Here is an Interspatial Ring. The treasures I got from Holy Ancestor and Stone Ancestor are all in it. Please take it.”

Jian Wushuang handed the ring to Spirit Ancestor.

The Ancestor looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile, then nodded and accepted the ring without saying a word.

The people in the feast were astonished to know that both Holy Ancestor and Stone Ancestor had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

Two supreme experts in the Divine Land had been killed by the same person in a single day.

“Lan’er.” Jian Wushuang turned to Lin Lan and said, “Follow me.”

“Ok.” Lin Lan nodded respectfully and followed him.

Watching until Jian Wushuang left, the stunned experts finally regained their composure. The next moment, the whole place went into an uproar.
