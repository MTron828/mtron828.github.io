Chapter 2593: Kill

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“How on earth could he survive after his soul was completely wiped out! This Territorial Lord is strange. I’d better escape.”

Zhong Hun immediately thought of retreating upon seeing Jian Wushuang who was launching an attack on him. He dared not shilly-shally anymore and immediately turned around to flee.

Suddenly... Rumbling... In the blink of an eye, Zhong Hun and his surrounding void were completely covered by the sky-filling golden divine power ocean. A huge Golden Prison appeared out of thin air. It completely occluded the void which was Zhong Hun’s escape route and crushed all hopes of his escape.

“Damn it!” Zhong Hun finally panicked.

He was once hunted down by two assassins when his strength was at its peak. At that time, he did not panic even when he was pushed to a dead end as the situation at that time was different. He had an exit plan and a chance to escape, hence he managed to do so in the end.

However, the Golden Prison’s appearance placed him at a ghost of a chance to escape.

Boom!

The terrifying 100,000 miles Sword World was fully displayed.

As soon as Zhong Hun turned his head, he saw Jian Wushuang who was some distance away emerged right in front of him after a strange delusional move.

It was so fast as though Jian Wushuang teleported himself.

On the next second, Jian Wushuang wielded his sword.

The Blood Mountain Sword silently went forth as Heaven and Earth seemed to have completely overlapped with space-time.

A weird fleeting sword shadow burst into view and disappeared!

Space-time Sword Technique, Sixth Form—Overlapping Shadow!

“How can it be so fast?”

Zhong Hun’s eyes enlarged with his mouth wide open. However, after the sword shadow disappeared so was his head which flew out and away from his neck.

Zhong Hun had not recovered from the shock, but his vitality had already begun to dissipate.

As Zhong Hun’s body fell feebly, the three huge demon shadows at his back had also disappeared into thin air. Jian Wushuang’s Golden Prison had also slowly faded away as he recollected his divine power breath until the surrounding void finally calmed down.

“You’re a Heaven Ultimate God who’s exceptionally skillful with soul attacks. Even though you’re injured and not at the peak of your power, you can still perform a Heaven Ultimate God-level soul attack. Your attack is indeed powerful but it’s a pity you’ve met me,” murmured Jian Wushuang as he stood towering over Zhong Hun’s body.

Zhong Hun’s soul attack was indeed extremely powerful. Jian Wushuang’s Exquisite Pagoda which he had cultivated up to the second level was nonetheless still destroyed by Zhong Hun’s soul attack. As a consequence, Jian Wushuang’s soul was also obliterated by the soul attack’s frontal penetration. Any ordinary expert would have died under such circumstances.

However, Jian Wushuang was different.

As the most unique and Perfect Chaotic Creature in the world, the abilities he possessed were incomparable to ordinary cultivators.

Although he was only at the Ultimate God Realm, he had an immortal body. His immortal body was even more powerful and perfect than an Undying Saint’s.

The immortal body of an Undying Saint could only rely on one’s divine power to quickly restore the divine body. It had little use in recovering the soul.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang’s immortal body was able to instantly restore his divine body as well as his soul.

His soul had indeed been wiped out by Zhong Hun. However, he was able to recover his soul using his immortal body’s abilities.

Such abilities were simply a fantasy among ordinary cultivators.

Only Perfect Chaotic Creatures had such abilities.

Zhong Hun’s soul attack was unquestionably powerful and any ordinary Earth Ultimate God would have died under his attack.

However, Jian Wushuang survived with his perfect immortal body which was a nemesis to any cultivator who was good at soul attacks!

His body was able to perfectly reflect all types of soul attacks by any cultivator.

In Jian Wushuang’s case, attacks of the flesh might destroy him but his body was impermeable to soul attack no matter how strong it was.

“A Heaven Ultimate God must be a top-tier expert in the Danyang Holy Domain. He must have quite a lot of wealth.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a strange luster as he waved his large hand and annihilated Zhong Hun’s body with a huge divine power before starting to count the items left behind by Zhong Hun.

He was indeed wealthy as a Heaven Ultimate God.

He had approximately 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 Primordial Stones left in his Interspatial Ring, but the more interesting part was his myriad of cultivation resources, secret techniques, treasures, and the like.

Although Jian Wushuang was not able to estimate the values of those cultivation resources as well as Xiao Tiexin, he was still able to come up with a simple estimation. The various cultivation resources in Zhong Hun’s Interspatial Ring and the Primordial Stones should worth around 15,000,000 Primordial Stones in total.

In addition, Zhong Hun also possessed some special treasures.

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand as a black spear, black armor, and ancient gray stone staff appeared in the void in front of him.

Jian Wushuang knew the black spear which Zhong Hun used to fight against him in the duel was a Heavenly Treasure offensive divine weapon. Its power was quite extraordinary.

Meanwhile, the black armor which transformed from the black robe worn by Zhong Hun was a Heavenly Treasure level defensive armor!

A defensive armor was ten times more valuable than an offensive divine weapon of the same level. The Heavenly Treasure level defensive armor was amazing.

Previously, San Shouwang had decided to attack Jian Wushuang because of the Heavenly Treasure level defensive armor on Jian Wushuang.

Although both treasures were extremely unusual, they were of no use to Jian Wushuang.

Needless to say, Jian Wushuang used a sword instead of a spear while his Golden Glass Armor which was also his Life Armor was more powerful than the black defensive armor. Moreover, the black defensive armor would become more inferior to the Golden Glass Armor as his strength continued to improve.

Jian Wushuang put the black spear and the black armor back into the Interspatial Ring with a wave of his hand before looking at the gray stone staff.

The gray stone staff exuded an ancient aura breath with a vague layer of power surrounding the stone staff. It was soul power.

Jian Wushuang could tell at a glance the gray stone staff was some sort of soul treasure.

As soon Jian Wushuang took ownership of the gray stone staff, the message contained within was immediately channeled into his mind.

It was a Spiritual Stone Staff, an offensive divine soul weapon at the Heavenly Treasure level!

“Indeed, it’s an offensive divine soul weapon at the Heavenly Treasure level.” Jian Wushuang secretly admired.

Soul treasure—regardless of an offensive or defensive divine soul weapon—was extremely rare and precious among treasures of the same level. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

For example, a Heavenly Treasure level defensive armor was ten times more valuable than an offensive divine weapon of the same level. An offensive Heavenly Treasure level divine soul weapon was even more precious than a defensive armor of the same level.
