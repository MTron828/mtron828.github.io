Chapter 391: Commanders’ Fight

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Commander Swordsman is powerful indeed. I deserved to lose,” Huangfu Hao said respectfully.

He saw Swordsman with a longsword on his back and knew that he must be adept at Sword Principle, but the commander defeated him without using any weapons, which proved his strength.

“You’re also very strong,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

At this moment...

“Haha, our new commander seems good.”

Hearty laughter erupted. Then they saw a brown-haired man flying toward them in the air. With a giant axe on his back, the man looked arrogant.

“Shi Ling, do you want to have a fight?” Lei Dao looked at the man with a smile.

“Sure, it’s rare to meet a new commander. How could I miss such an opportunity?” The brown-haired man laughed and soon appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Shi Ling?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“Shi Ling is also a commander. He is a bit stronger than me,” Lei Yun added.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Swordsman, come on, let’s fight.” Shi Ling stared at Jian Wushuang with sparkling eyes.

“Commander Shi Ling, please teach me some moves,” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile.

Hearing this, the sergeants in black armor became excited.

“Commander Swordsman accepted the challenge!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Two commanders are fighting!”

All the sergeants looked excited.

Shi Ling grinned. The moment he stepped forward, a huge Axe Shadow slashed out.

”?So fast!?

” Jian Wushuang was not only shocked at his speed, but also his momentum.

”?I need to draw my sword.?” Jian Wushuang made his decision.

The Lonely Heart Sword appeared in his hand, and immediately slashed at the Axe Shadow.

Clang!

A loud crash came out. Suddenly, Shi Ling emanated a violent and overwhelming aura. His strength erupted.

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

Streaks of Axe Shadow continuously swept toward Jian Wushuang with the momentum of a landslide or tsunami.

Every stroke was fast and powerful.

“Too fast!”

Jian Wushuang waved his longsword to block it, but he was barely able to resist and was forced to retreat.

The Axe Shadows’ power and speed did not decrease, and even became fiercer.

“I’ll lose if it keeps going on like this.”?Jian Wushuang realized that he had to change his tactics. Then a Slaughter Domain spread out.

“Domain?” Shi Ling did not take it seriously.

The Domain had a little effect on an expert who had reached the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm; it did not work at all on an expert who had reached Stage Two of the realm.

Shi Ling immediately saw waves spreading when Jian Wushuang performed Domain.

Each wave, which was full of great Sword Essence, looked the same as the effect of Domain, but it was more powerful than the latter.

It was the first-grade sword technique,?“Multifold Realm”.

A year ago, when Jian Wushuang stayed in the Nanyang Continent, he had just started practicing?“Multifold Realm”?and could only display the First Realm.

Then he had traveled around the endless territories for a year and kept practicing, now he could perform the second move of?“Multifold Realm”?, the Tenfold Realm.

Jian Wushuang performed Tenfold Realm and Slaughter Domain simultaneously.

Although Slaughter Domain posed little threat to Shi Ling, after all, Tenfold Realm was a first-grade sword technique. Jian Wushuang exerted his full strength to perform the two, and imposed great pressure on Shi Ling, whose movements immediately slowed down.

The speed of both his Axe Shadow and body dropped dramatically.

“Now I can fight against you.”?Jian Wushuang wore a faint smile.

He suddenly rushed toward his opponent while weaving out a sword shadow.

“Damn it, his domain can suppress me to this extent?” Shi Ling turned pale. In the Tenfold Realm, he was attacked by Sword Essence at every moment, as if he was stuck in the mud.

Lei Dao wore a weird look while watching this fight. “I didn’t expect that Swordsman had such a powerful skill?”

“Shi Ling might be forced to concede.”

“Haha, he is so arrogant. It’s good to teach him a lesson.”

“Our new commander has a powerful skill indeed. The combination of Sword Realm and Slaughter Domain could brutally suppress Shi Ling.”

Several commanders stood beside Lei Dao. They all came to watch this fight.

They were shocked by the Realm Technique Jian Wushuang performed and envied him in their heart.

Everybody knew such a technique helped a lot in a fight.

With the help of the Tenfold Realm and Slaughter Domain, Jian Wushuang took the initiative to fight back. Soon he got the upper hand. Though they fought fiercely for a while, Jian Wushuang remained at an advantage.

“Good! This feels so good!”?Jian Wushuang became excited, his eyes gleaming with joy.

Shi Ling was powerful indeed. Though he was suppressed by the Tenfold Realm, he could block all the attacks from his opponent.

“If I don’t show my trump card, it will be hard for me to beat him.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He had exerted his full strength, but could barely prevail, so if he wanted to defeat Shi Ling, he had to use his trump card now.

He had lots of trump cards, including the Asura Secret Skill, Double First-grade Sword Soul, Mind’s Eye Sword Technique, Heart-killing Sword Technique, Triple-kill Sword...

Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang had no such plan, as he was enjoying this fight.

By contrast, Shi Ling suffered terribly in the Realm.

“I quit, I quit!” Shi Ling suddenly snarled and then directly retreated to the side.

Jian Wushuang stopped and looked at Shi Ling with a faint smile.

“Your realm skill is too odd. I felt suppressed in such a realm and could not show my strength,” Shi Ling said in a low voice.

“Haha, Shi Ling, you lost the fight. Don’t find an excuse for yourself,” Lei Dao said with a smile.

“Yep, Sword Realm is one of Swordsman’s skills. You want him to hide his real strength?”

“Tut, it’s rare to see Shi Ling being forced to concede.”

Laughter rang out. Lei Dao and the other commanders all stepped forward.
