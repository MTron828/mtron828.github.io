Chapter 2775: Depart

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You want to have a quick battle?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “Is that possible?”

“I have to do the impossible as I do not have other choices.” Yin Su’er said in a low voice.

“Yun Shan is already exchanging terms with Nanwu Palace at this moment and they haven’t come to an agreement because none of them wants to make a concession. Once either the Nanwu Palace or Yun Shan makes a slight concession, they would form an alliance and I would not have any chances. Although what I’m going to do seems reckless, there’s at least some possibility of success.”

“As long as we are speedy enough to defeat Yun Shan’s faction before the experts from Nanwu Palace, Life and Death Tower and Dongfang Clan arrive, we would manage to withstand them with the help of your Sword Alliance, even if my faction isn’t in its peak stage.”

“If we are able to withstand that round of attack, we can think of ways to split up those three pinnacle forces next. After all, they have internal conflicts and we would have lots of opportunities to pinpoint them by then.”

Jian Wushuang was secretly lamenting when he heard what Yin Su’er said.

He was able to see that Yin Su’er had been forced to a point of no return or she would not have proactively taken action against Yun Shan’s faction when she was not completely prepared.

As for her decision right now, Jian Wushuang had to admit that this might be her last chance even if it was a dangerous one.

Jian Wushuang agreed to Yin Su’er’s decision when he stood in her shoes.

“I understand it. Don’t worry, fort master. My Sword Alliance will use everything we have to help you in ten days.” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

“Thank you, Mr. Jian Yi.” Yin Su’er softened her voice. “No matter what the ending of this battle is, you’ve done everything you should have. Even if my faction lost in the end, I’m only grateful towards Mr. Jian Yi and there would not be a hint of dissatisfaction. By then, Mr. Jian Yi can think of ways to escape and ignore what happens to my Crimson Stone Fort.”

“I know, I’m not stupid.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

The two of them stopped their communication after that.

“She plans to take action ten days later?” Jian Wushuang sat in the garden by himself as he tapped his finger against the stone table with an extremely serious expression on his face.

Yin Su’er’s decision to carry out the raid ten days later was really a forced decision and the risks were extremely huge.

They were not hugely certain even if she had her full support.

Jian Wushuang had once made a deal with Crimson Stone Saint and he would definitely do his best full-hearted since he was entrusted by others on this matter. He also hoped that Yin Su’er managed to obtain what she wanted in this battle.

However, he was unable to predict the ending.

“No matter what, I’ve tried my best and everything would come down to Yin Su’er’s fate to see if we survive this.” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

He had already reached the limit of what he could do and he had a clear conscience that he was worthy of the Fengtian Scroll given to him by the Crimson Stone Saint.

Ten days passed by in the blink of an eye.

In a grand hall of the Sword Alliance, Jian Wushuang sat on the grand throne at the highest position while Xiao Tiexin stood obediently beside him.

Beneath the hall, several experts were standing there.

The sloppy old man with messy hair, Old Tong, narrowed his eyes as he stood in front of everybody. However, he still hid his divine power and unless he met a Peak Grand Ultimate God like him, nobody would notice that he had already broken through even though his ways of hiding his power were not very strong.

For example, when Blood Thunder King came visiting previously, Old Tong stood beside but Blood Thunder King did not realize that Old Tong had already broken through into a Peak Grand Ultimate God.

There were six other people behind Old Tong.

Among these six people, there was one older and one younger person apart from Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, Old Snake, An Ying and Lan Junzhu. They were also Grand Ultimate Gods and were members of the elder group in the Sword Alliance.

Couple of decades ago, the entire Danyang Continent was shocked when news about the Sword Alliance defeating the Divine Demon Sect was spreaded out. The Sword Alliance’s prestige had achieved a shocking high within that period of time.

Within these couple of decades, the Sword Alliance tried its best in developing and attracted experts with a huge number of resources and cost. These two Grand Ultimate Gods were experts who accepted their invitation.

Among these two people, one of them is a High-level Grand Ultimate God while the other is only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God.

The reason they accepted the invitation from the Sword Alliance was not only because of the sufficient pay the Sword Alliance provided, the most important point was that these two people had great grudges against the Divine Demon Sect.

They promised because they felt that they had been avenged when they saw how the Sword Alliance defeated the Divine Demon Sect in a face-to face battle and caused the Divine Demon Sect to be badly wounded.

The addition of these two people had once again enriched the Sword Alliance’s higher level combat power. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Right now, these Grand Ultimate Gods followed Jian Wushuang’s orders and were waiting in silence.

They were able to see that Jian Wushuang was definitely planning something huge for gathering all of them over at this moment. However, Jian Wushuang did not say what they were doing and they had no idea either.

In the highest throne, Jian Wushuang was also waiting there with his eyes closed.

After waiting for around half an hour, Yin Su’er had finally sent a message.

“Jian Yi, we’ve started our journey and we will be at Bane City within an hour.” Yin Su’er said.

“Bane City? That is where the battlefield will be?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, Yun Shan is having a discussion with the experts under his leadership in Bane City. We shall carry out a sudden raid once we arrive there and there will be a large movement by then. The experts of different forces will be immediately alarmed, especially Blood Thunder King... He is one of our Crimson Stone Fort’s higher management and he’s very familiar with some of our spatial passages. Once a huge battle happens in Bane City, he would be able to rush over speedily via the spatial passages. Your Sword Alliance needs to think of a way to stop him.” Yin Su’er said.

“Understood. I will start my journey now.” Jian Wushuang interrupted the communication and looked towards the Grand Ultimate Gods below him.

“Old Snake, stay and take care of our base.” Jian Wushuang ordered.

“Yes, master.” Old Snake nodded without any complaints.

“The others shall leave with me right now.” With the wave of Jian Wushuang’s hands, Old Tong, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, An Ying, Lan Junzhu and two other Grand Ultimate Gods that recently joined the Sword Alliance immediately started their journey under Jian Wushuang’s lead.

They had been travelling via some wormholes throughout the entire journey and had arrived in a void near to Bane City within a short amount of time.

“The Bane City is located not far from here and that place has always been the Crimson Stone Fort’s territory. Alliance Master Su Han, what are we doing here?” Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin asked.

“Stop with the questions as you will know when it’s time.” Jian Wushuang only smiled indifferently and did not make much explanation.
