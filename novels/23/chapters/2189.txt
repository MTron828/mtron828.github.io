Chapter 2190 Goodbye

Out of the nine Ancient God stars, he had destroyed four of them.The four stars turned into bloodline power that Jian Wushuang could use.

“Not enough. This is far from enough.”

Jian Wushuang face darkened. Then, boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The remaining five stars crumbled together.

Every single one of the nine stars crumbled!

He was betting everything he had.

Instantly, Ancient God’s bloodline power erupted within his body as this power multiplied.

Even so, Jian Wushuang realized he could not cast the seventh seal.

“Even after all nine stars crumbled, I can’t cast the seventh seal?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

The difference between the sixth and the seventh seal was far too great.

The amount of power needed to cast the seventh seal was much more than that needed for the sixth.

“Not enough!”

“I need more power!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists as determination started to burn in his eyes.

He had already used most of his trump cards. He had even used Star Destruction Skill to its fullest and destroyed all nine stars.

However, he still required more power.

At this moment, there was only one way left for him to cast the seventh seal.

Jian Wushuang stood there, determined. He looked up slowly.

He was not looking at Blood Emperor or Emperor thirteen. He focused his vision on a beautiful figure some distance away.

That figure was Leng Ruxue.

Looking at that figure, his heart burned.

“Sorry, Leng Rushuang!”

Jian Wushuang said silently to himself.

However, it was like this sentence had been transmitted into the sleeping consciousness of the beautiful figure far away.

Leng Ruxue stood there quietly. However, when she saw Jian Wushuang’s eyes, she shuddered.

“Emperor Bai, please take care of Green Fire World for me.” Jian Wushuang said as his voice reverberated throughout the battlefield.

“Jian Wushuang, what are you saying?” Emperor Bai asked, knitting his eyebrows.

Jian Wushuang did not elaborate. He continued to scan the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Goodbye, everyone!”

Instantly, a vast amount of soul power erupted.

Hum!!

The limitless amount of soul power was like oil meeting fire: it was set ablaze.

“This is?” Emperor Bai turned pale.

“Soul ignition!” The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were shocked as exclamations could be heard everywhere.

Soul ignition… A technique that would only be used in a situation where one would definitely die to do the most amount of damage to their opponents.

Before Emperor Thirteen reached them, the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were prepared to cast soul ignition to sacrifice everything to defend their home. They did not do so as Emperor Thirteen had arrived and seen hope.

However, under the clear view of everyone, Jian Wushuang had used this technique.

Jian Wushuang was trying to drag Blood Emperor down with him.

“Nine province seal, the seventh seal!!!”

After casting soul ignition, Jian Wushuang’s power multiplied again.

The limitless amount of divine power and bloodline power were fully utilized.

Jian Wushuang’s flushed face was twisted fiercely.

With that expression, Jian Wushuang made seals using his hands.

Jian Wushuang then forcefully used three of his own blood essences to further increase his power.

He barely met the minimum requirement to cast the seventh seal. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang used everything he had and every single drop of energy, as all of this power gushed into the seal up in the sky.

A limitless amount of energy poured in!

Finally, an even more gigantic province appeared from the Picture Scroll World and descended.

Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!

Ancient chimes could be heard as they reverberated throughout heaven and earth.

These chimes contained a special magic to it as it calmed everyone’s mind.

These chimes originated from the large province.

At that instant, the entire battlefield fell silent.

Dead silent.

Every expert there looked up and stared at the gigantic and majestic province.

Everyone held their breath. No one said a word.

It was not because they did not want to speak. The pressure from the province was so great that no one could open their mouth.

Furthermore, the majestic province did not target them, yet they were still under such incredible pressure.

It would be hard to imagine how much pressure the Blood Emperor would be facing when the province targeted him.

“The seventh seal!”

Emperor Thirteen looked up and stared at the slowly descending province coldly. A flash of surprise could be seen from his emotionless eyes.

“Let me help you.”

Emperor Thirteen said. The sword in his hands started to glow bright.

It was so bright it looked like a huge sun that was concentrated in energy.

Emperor Thirteen swung his sword.

He did not move at all. He pointed his sword at Blood Emperor.

Instantly, the large “sun”, which was made up of sword essence, burst forth and appeared in the space where Blood Emperor was before it exploded.

Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum!

The entire space turned into a sea of sword essence.

This sword essence spread out and crashed towards Blood Emperor from all directions.

Blood Emperor received suppression from both the seventh seal and the sea of sword essence.

“Is this what we can do?” Emperor Thirteen squinted his eyes.

Blood Emperor looked at Emperor Thirteen coldly, “Emperor Thirteen. If I am not wrong, this should be one of your three strongest sword skills, World of Swords. It is a pity that you are in the realm of Half-step Divine Demon Realm and the power of this sword is so limited!!”
