Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The doors of the trial swung open. Jian Wushuang nodded, took a step forward, and entered the trial tower once again.

This time, as Shan Jun had said, it was markedly different.

The second level of the trial tower made him reminisce about the ease of the first level.

This second level was eerily similar to the hell he had imagined.

The terrifying entities he saw on this level, the horrifying creatures churning in the lava, were things he hoped never to encounter in his lifetime again.

“l hope you guys never see the light of day again!’

In the second level, Jian Wushuangs strength wasn’t divided or suppressed; he possessed his utmost pinnacle power.

However, his strength was useless on this level.

There were 360 chains, and he needed to traverse each one entirely. Below these chains roared ancient gods and demons in the lava.

Each of them had the strength of an Emperor, and some even surpassed Zhen Wuyang!

They fought and roared in the magma.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang cautiously walked on the chains, his innate treasure armor becoming scalding hot in the terrifying heat.

Regular treasures could melt at any time in this purgatory.

After traversing all 360 chains, he felt his feet had lost all sensation, his consciousness stiffening.

When he stepped onto the lotus-shaped altar, his legs were as unmovable as stone pillars. He had truly achieved an unshakable stance.

The lotus altar was the only land in this purgatory, a mere few miles in length and width, standing tall above the lava like a towering pillar.

Surrounding him were chains glowing in a deep red hue, beneath which lay terrifying lava and enormous beasts.

“Whew! ”

Turning his gaze back to the lava beasts below, Jian Wushuang was still catching his breath!

This wasn’t just a test of his physical endurance, but a test of his willpower.

Walking on the chains, the scorching sensation constantly tempered his body. Below him, the lava beasts posed a constant threat. One wrong move or a failure in endurance would result in a fall.

Falling!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang felt cold sweat forming on his back; he didn’t even dare to imagine what it would be like to fall!

He had been walking for three hundred years, enduring this ordeal every moment.

He had to maintain his Beast God Domain constantly, amplifying his divine body; otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to endure this trial.

Especially the torment on his willpower, it made him incredibly stiff, or rather, extraordinarily resilient. No matter what, he would firmly take each step.

Upon arriving at the altar, he felt no sense of relief.

It wasn’t until several hours had passed that he finally opened his eyes and looked toward the center of the altar.

According to the information transmitted by the token, he needed to offer his current physical body as a sacrifice on the altar.

Although he didn’t understand why it had to be so extreme, he had no choice but to comply. He could only walk towards the altar.

At the core of the altar, there was a massive bronze cauldron placed.

Following the instructions on the token, Jian Wushuang began the ritual.

Thud!

He knelt down on both knees, raising his hands above his head, performing a full-body kowtow to the heavens.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

He kowtowed three times in succession. “Great Wilderness, please accept this body!” Jian Wushuang slowly stood up, but his physical form remained kneeling beside the large cauldron.

The ethereal figure of the deity stood up.

Buzz!

A loud noise resonated as his physical body slowly rose and then leaped into the giant cauldron.

Boom!

A beam of light erupted from the cauldron.

Jian Wushuangs ethereal figure trembled.

Then, everything fell silent.

Jian Wushuang frowned. Was that all there was to it?

In the next moment, the cauldron burst forth with another beam of light, releasing three bronze locks.

There was also a kind-looking old man with a white beard, his eyes curved at the corners.

“Offeror, which lock did you just sacrifice?” The white-bearded old man opened his palm, and the three bronze locks emitted golden, silver, and yellow hues, corresponding to three different grades.

“I… I think I sacrificed…” Jian Wushuang was about to blurt out but stopped abruptly.

He had originally wanted to say that he sacrificed his physical body. However, he thought again: since he was given three treasures, he had no other choice but to choose one from the three.

“Senior, 1 sacrificed this golden lock!” Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully, his attitude extremely deferential.

The white-haired old man pondered for a moment and sighed, saying, “Oh, I

” see.

“This golden lock, I bestow it upon you.”

The golden small lock floated toward Jian Wushuang, embroidered with several dragon-shaped patterns on top. The aura it exuded was incredibly powerful.

When the golden lock touched his ethereal figure, his divine body instantly radiated with a brilliant light, beginning to reshape a new physical body. Though similar to his previous one, this new body was enhanced by the fusion with the golden lock, making his divine body even stronger than before.

“Dragon-Lock Body! ‘

Jian Wushuangs flesh turned golden, and within him, a gigantic dragon was locked.

Just as he was astonished, the white-haired old man sighed and said

regretfully, “What a pity, what a pity that such a superior physical body went unclaimed. I can finally go fishing now.”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, a fishing rod appeared in his hand out of thin air, with a body exactly like Jian Wushuangs hanging on the hook. The fishing rod extended for thousands of feet, casting down into the magma below.

Before long, he caught a lava giant beast. However, the lava giant beast, caught by the fishing rod, had become extremely small and weak, its aura also greatly diminished.

The old man with the white beard was very happy.

He put away his fishing rod, grabbed the lava giant beast with both hands, and entered the big cauldron again with a smile on his face.

Only Jian Wushuang was left, standing in the wind, feeling disheveled.

“It seems like I missed something!’

His physical body!

Yes, his physical body.

The unclaimed physical body, wasn’t that the one he sacrificed?

This old man with the white beard knew it was his physical body, yet he lamented in front of him. It was really malicious to the core.

Jian Wushuang was furious on the spot!

Although he had obtained the golden lock, the increase in physical strength was limited and didn’t meet the requirements of the second level’s rewards.

Just then, a message came from the token.

“Inheritance trial failed!”

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang didn’t dare to speak out, but he cursed the white-haired old man a thousand times in his heart.

Now that the trial had failed, what should he do?

He hadn’t died yet!

Whoosh!

He was forcibly moved back to the starting point uncontrollably.

This was also where the dream began.

Everything returned to the beginning. He looked exactly like he did when he first entered the second-level trial tower, except his physical body had become much stronger than before.

Part of it was due to the training from walking along the 360 chains, especially the flexibility in his legs, which was very obvious.

Another part came from the golden lock.

This trip wasn’t in vain at least, Jian Wushuang comforted himself. But when he looked ahead, countless chains crisscrossed in all directions. He felt like he wanted to die.

He had spent all his treasure points, and now he had no choice but to plow through with gritted teeth.

Fortunately, he had the experience from the first time and his own strong will, along with a powerful state of mind, which prevented him from collapsing.

It was just that he had wasted more than a hundred years for nothing..
