“That arrow…”

Jian Wushuang stared at the black arrow in Emperor God Tian Xiao’s hand. He could feel a strong sense of crisis from the black arrow.

It was obvious that the arrow wasn’t ordinary. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Soaring Heaven King Palace has been an overlord in Eternal Chaotic World for so long and they have a solid foundation. Not only do they have many experts, they also have many trump cards. This arrow must be one of Soaring Heaven King Palace’s trump cards,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

In the entire Soaring Heaven King Palace, in terms of experts, there was only Emperor God Tian Ling who was constantly wandering in the Second Lair who he had scruples about.

Besides the experts, Soaring Heaven King Palace had some trump cards that shouldn’t be belittled.

As such, Jian Wushuang didn’t barge into Soaring Heaven King Palace’s old lair directly but opted for Soaring Heaven Mansion instead.

“Jian Wushuang, the arrow is extraordinary. You have to deal with it carefully,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice suddenly rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

In the void before him, Emperor God Tian Xiao flashed a malicious smile after he took out the arrow. Then, he flipped his wrist and a bow appeared in his hand.

The bow had a threatening aura as well. However, it was far from a Chaotic Divine Treasure.

Then, Emperor God Tian Xiao placed the arrow to the bow before countless experts.

As he pulled the string and aimed the black arrow at Jian Wushuang, he could feel that he was completely locked onto by magical power.

Regardless of where he ran to, the power would catch up with him and destroy him.

“Jian Wushuang, you should be proud to make me use a God Slayer Arrow on you,” Emperor God Tian Xiao spoke coldly as he stretched the string on the bow. The magical power that was holding onto Jian Wushuang grew stronger.

“Die!”

With a deep bellow, the extremely tense bowstring was let loose.

A black extermination light burst out and the black arrow broke the moment it was shot.

Although the arrow broke, the power that it displayed was extremely terrifying.

“A one-use disposable item?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The arrow’s power was overwhelming and it broke when it was shot. All the power was concentrated in the arrow and Emperor God Tian Xiao intended to kill him with that arrow.

“Such terrifying power.”

The people who were watching in the surrounding could feel the power and their faces changed.

It was too powerful.

The power that was displayed by Emperor God Tian Xiao and Jian Wushuang was much stronger.

It was a killing arrow!

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang humphed coldly and his eyes shined. The divine power in his body continued to flow out madly.

“Ancient God unique skill, Eight Divine Mountains!”

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

A total of eight tall, golden, lofty divine mountains descended from nowhere.

The eight golden, lofty divine mountains appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and formed eight layers of defense.

It was the strongest defense unique skill of Ancient God tribe. Along with the improvement of Jian Wushuang’s power, the eight golden lofty divine mountains’ defense power grew tremendously strong as well.

However, the eight divine mountains might be able to block a full blow by an Emperor God, but to block the God Slayer Arrow that was shot to kill, they seemed to be slightly too weak.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The black arrow brought along extermination aura as it pierced one golden divine mountain after another.

In the blink of an eye, the ten thousand zhang tall divine mountains were pierced.

The black arrow continued to shoot at Jian Wushuang.

“King of Venomous Worms!” Jian Wushuang roared.

“Let me take care of this,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head. The muscles on Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God body wriggled vigorously and a huge monster suddenly appeared.

“Secret skill of Plenilune, Ten Thousand Cirri!”

Countless cirri swept out and gathered together at a terrifying speed. It instantly formed a huge, towering hand.

The huge hand extended slowly and greeted the God Slayer Arrow that was aiming at Jian Wushuang.

Both parties collided… Hualala. The huge hand was breaking down quickly and the countless cirri shattered at the power of the God Slayer Arrow.

In the end, the God Slayer Arrow pierced the entire huge hand. However, due to the hindrance of the huge hand, the power of the God Slayer Arrow was diminished greatly.

Bang!

God Slayed Arrow finally reached its goal and hit Jian Wushuang. His divine body shook vigorously and he fell back. It took a while before he stopped.

In the void, Jian Wushuang stood on his feet again. He touched his chest and he saw that there was a clear white spot on his chest.

“It’s such a terrifying killer move,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

It pierced Eight Divine Mountains and the huge hand that King of Venomous Worms had performed via secret skill. Then, it finally hit him. In the end, his divine body was merely slightly impacted.

The power of God Slayer Arrow was comparable to a hit of a top Emperor God.

“He didn’t die?”

Emperor God Tian Xiao was shocked.

God Slayer Arrow was one of Soaring Heaven King Palace’s trump cards. Soaring Heaven King Palace only had three God Slayer Arrows and they used one on Jian Wushuang.

The God Slayer Arrow was shot out by him, an Emperor God, personally. Theoretically, it should even be able to kill an Emperor God, but Jian Wushuang had survived and his aura was still as magnificent as before. It was obvious that his injury wasn’t bad.

“Emperor God Tian Xiao, was the arrow earlier your last trump card?”

Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor God Tian Xiao as he spoke coldly. “The power of the arrow was not too shabby. But unfortunately, it can’t kill me. As you have defense armor at the level of Chaotic Divine Treasure, I can’t kill you either. However, if I want to kill the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace, you can’t stop me.”

Emperor God Tian Xiao’s eyes dilated in shock.

That was what he was worried about the most.

He had defense armor at the level of Chaotic Divine Treasure. He wasn’t afraid of Jian Wushuang. However, the other people in Soaring Heaven King Palace didn’t.

If Jian Wushuang intended to kill them, he couldn’t stop him.

“Jian Wushuang, what is it that you want exactly?” Emperor Tian Xiao roared.

“What I want?” Jian Wushuang chuckled coldly, “I said this before. I am here to take revenge on Soaring Heaven King Palace. Only the blood of the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace can quell the anger in me. The battle with Soaring Heaven Mansion today, although I killed three Sir Gods, many Real Gods and Universe Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace, it’s not enough, It’s far from enough!”

“There will be plenty of time. I will stay back and have a lot of fun with you.”

“Haha.”

The hearty laughter reverberated in the universe and everyone revealed a horrified expression.

After he laughed, Jian Wushuang turned around. He had obviously made up his mind to leave.

Watching Jian Wushuang walk away, Emperor God Tian Xiao’s gaze was gloomy yet helpless.

He knew clearly that he couldn’t make Jian Wushuang stay with his power alone.
