Chapter 1182: Secret Skill of the Stars

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You should already be familiar with this token,” said Lord Spirit Sound as she looked at him.

“This is the token carried by disciples of the Star Palace, right?” replied Jian Wushuang with a laugh.

When he first became an ordinary disciple of the Star Bloodline, he also received a similar token. It had many stars in it, and it also contained an extremely unique and strong aura. However, this token was obviously more precious than that of an ordinary disciple.

After Jian Wushuang received the token, Lord Spirit Sound passed the secret skill to him.

“Jian Wushuang, this is the Secret Skill of the Stars, a technique left behind by our founder which only disciples from the Star Bloodline have a right to learn. This secret skill is one of the most powerful and valuable in our sect,” said Lord Spirit Sound, her tone turning serious.

“Secret Skill of the Stars?” asked Jian Wushuang, his eyes gleaming.

The sect took its name from the stars. As such, one could only imagine how important the Secret Skill of the Stars was to it.

“What sort of secret skill is this?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Jian Wushuang was feeling a little expectant as his Soul Power surged into the skill; information came flowing toward him instantly.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang asked as he opened his eyes wide.

He was completely in shock after browsing through the message about the secret skill.

It was an extremely terrible skill, and it could even be considered as one that was against the natural order.

“This secret skill focuses the power of the stars and merges it with one’s Spiritual Power. In this way, one’s offensive power will greatly increase in a short period of time!

“The skill is divided into three scrolls. The first scroll will increase one’s power tenfold and lasts for a couple dozen seconds.

“The second volume can improve one’s power by a hundred times, for two to three seconds!”

“The third volume can improve one’s power by a thousand times for a strike!”

The simple introduction completely rocked Jian Wushuang’s world.

He had mastered similar skills before in the past that could directly increase his power instantly, for example, the Star-river Secret Skill of the Ancient God Clan.

That said, the Star-river Secret Skill was a technique that just served to amplify his power. Once he had mastered it, the skill would passively increase his power even without him making any strikes.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, this kind of power amplifying technique is very common.

All experts there have mastered some sort of similar technique; it was very common for them to increase their strength by even 100 times.

It was also due to the popular usage of such skills that it did not bring many benefits to experts during a duel.

But this Secret Skill of the Stars was different!

It was a terrible technique that gathered the power of the stars and combined it with the user’s power, causing the user’s attacks to undergo a total transformation.

In nature, it was somewhat similar to the Divine Yin Thunder technique that Jian Wushuang was practicing.

The Divine Yin Thunder technique, however, would not increase much of Jian Wushuang’s overall power even if he completed mastery of it. Just by learning the first scroll of the Secret Skill of the Stars, on the other hand, the Divine Yin Thunder technique could increase his power tenfold!

“This was ten times we are talking about,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

The offensive power of an ordinary Universe Master would be on par or even greater than that of a peak level Universe if he or she managed to increase it tenfold.

It was beyond Jian Wushaung’s wildest dreams that the second and third scrolls could increase his power by 100 and 1000 times respectively.

The flaw of the secret technique was that it lasted for only a very short duration when used.

The power from the first scroll could last for a couple dozen seconds, a considerably longer time.

The power from the second and third scrolls, however, could only last for two to three seconds and one blow respectively. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The greater the power generated by this Secret Skill of the Stars, the shorter it lasts,”?thought Jian Wushuang as he nodded. He could accept this fact as the benefits of the technique far outweighed its flaws.

“What do you think, Jian Wushuang?” asked Lord Spirit Sound as she looked toward him.

“It’s really a terrible technique,” Jian Wushuang replied as he clenched his fists tightly, his eyes glowing.

“Start practicing here. Both the Gu King and I will be your guardians,” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“I’m also aware the power of the stars gathered by using this secret skill is a unique form of power. I may be Plenilune and have great regeneration skills, but even I could not replenish such energy,” said the Gu King.

“Does this mean that even if I master the first scroll, I can only use it for a couple dozen seconds no matter what?” asked Jian Wushuang with a frown.

“Yes,” replied Lord Spirit Sound with a nod. “Besides, you’ll have to replenish whatever energy from the stars you’ve used up, and this process takes time. Before you replenish your store of energy, you won’t be able to use this secret skill.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushang could not help but feel surprised.

“This Secret Skill of the Stars is indeed fearsome, and its benefits can even be considered as incredible.

“However, there are many restrictions for using this technique,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re now only at Dao Master level. Even by Inverse Cultivation, you’ll at most only be able to master the first scroll, and even barely. As for the second scroll, don’t even think about it for now,” Lord Spirit Sound said.

“It’ll already be great if I can master the first scroll,” laughed Jian Wushuang, feeling satisfied.

By mastering the first scroll of the Secret Skill of the Stars, he would have a trump card that would grant him the ability to unleash ten times his original power in a duration of a couple dozen seconds.

“Start practicing here. Both the Gu King and I will be your guardians,” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“Right,” replied Jian Wushuang with a nod. He immediately sat cross-legged within the palace hall and began practicing the Secret Skill of the Stars.

Just as Jian Wushuang was practicing his newly acquired secret technique, something was going on in the Green Fire Palace.

A white-haired old elder was sitting alone with perfect posture before a chess set, cracking his head as to how to make his next move.

But suddenly…

“Hmm?” muttered the elder as his expression changed. He stood up suddenly, a look of surprise in his gaze.

“Palace Masters!”

The white-haired old man immediately summoned the five Palace Masters.

They gathered in the majestic palace, the white-haired elder standing to their side, a look of worry on his face.

“Look, Palace Masters.”

An image appeared immediately in front of him with a wave of his hand.

The image showed a vast, black portion of the Void. It was situated at the perimeter of the battlefield, but surprisingly, a huge portal was there without their knowledge. In the portal, they could vaguely make out an ancient spaceship.

Upon seeing this, the expressions of the five Palace Masters changed as well.

“The thing that the Green Fire Palace was most worried about… has finally happened!”
