Chapter 2389: Jian Wushuang and Miss Xiao (1)

“No!” Jian Wushuang looked terrified.

Almost at the same moment when Miss Xiao looked at him, a mysterious power started to rise from his body.

The source of the power was the inner demons!

It wanted to eat up his mind and his everything.

The crucial aspect was that while it was eating him up, Jian Wushuang felt an incomparable satisfaction and comfort.

It was such an amazing feeling that he could not help but let himself sink in.

Jian Wushuang finally understood how the three First-Class Divine Demons could not even fight it off.

Not only First-Class Divine Demons, even Peak Stage Divine Demons or those above Divine Demon Realm could easily be conquered by that mysterious power from the inner demons should they so much as slightly lose their concentration.

Only a grounded mind could withstand an attack method such as that.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang let out a cold harumph while still standing at the same place with frosty eyes.

The rising power of the inner demons was completely suppressed by him.

“Your bewitching tactic which comes from inner demons is truly impressive. Regretfully, it doesn’t work on me,” said Jian Wushuang with a deep tone.

He had lived for a hundred thousand years in his past life which he had been through so many trials and tribulations, especially the Three Inverse Cultivation Tests. They were all tremendous tests for his mind and will!

After going through that many challenges, his mind had become as indestructible as iron cubes.

The bewitchment method that Miss Xiao used was truly powerful, but it would be a joke if she wanted to control him with it.

“Haha, you’re truly something huh?” Miss Xiao smiled plainly, gradually dimming the red light in her eyes. She then looked towards Jian Wushuang again and said, “Compared to that rubbish before, you’re truly not just at level higher. However, if I really want to kill you, I have many ways to do it.”

As soon as she was done speaking, a dark shadow flashed by and a phantom-like figure appeared next to Miss Xiao.

That phantom figure was a young woman in black.

Jian Wushuang, Xiao Heng, and the rest immediately recognized her. She was Little Li, the maid who was serving Miss Xiao in Hundred Flowers Tower.

The impression that she gave off before was also one of gentle and weak.

However, Little Li’s face was now as frosty as ice. What was especially surprising was the aura of divine power she was projecting.

That divine power aura was even stronger than the late Bai Tao’s and not by just one level!

“Peak Stage Divine Demon!”

“She is a Peak Stage Divine Demon?!”

Xiao Heng and the core disciples were startled.

Peak Stage Divine Demon was above First-Class Divine Demon.

That stage could only be achieved by governors of the old cities in Luogu Territory.

Even for top-tier sects like Narcissus Island, there were only a few Peak Stage Divine Demons which could be counted with ten fingers.

But...a maid next to Miss Xiao was actually a Peak Stage Divine Demon!

“Peak Stage Divine Demon, huh? Your aura concealing technique is quite impressive that you even fooled me, ” Jian Wushuang murmured to himself.

“Miss, would you like me to kill them?”

As soon as Little Li appeared, she inquired.

A Peak Stage Divine Demon. If an expert like that made a move... even Jian Wushuang, who used vicious methods to kill off every man from Mu Clan a moment ago, would not have much chance to fight back.

Furthermore, there was an even more terrifying person, Miss Xiao.

Hearing Little Li’s inquiry, Miss Xiao raised her eyebrows and looked at Jian Wushuang with a half-smile. “Your name is Jian Wushuang, correct? Now that Little Li has asked, tell me, should I kill all of you off right here?”

Jian Wushuang was still incredibly calm. “Miss Xiao. I’ve said just now; Narcissus Island has no relationship with the Mu Clan. They were even using us. Moreover, I’ve killed off all the men from Mu Clan, shouldn’t you be satisfied by now?”

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples finally understood why Jian Wushuang annihilated all the Mu Clan experts. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It turned out that he already knew their lives were all within Miss Xiao’s palm. He did it just to make her happy, hoping that she would let them live.

Furthermore, Jian Wushuang had told Miss Xiao since the beginning and asked her to show mercy.

‘Jian Wushuang had always been with us and interacted with Miss Xiao. We had not realized anything fishy, but he realized so many things. What kind of a monster is he?’ Xiao Heng exclaimed in his mind.

However, it was not the time to think about those things.

He only hoped that Miss Xiao could show them some mercy.

“Your performance was truly quite impressive. If those three from Nine Stars Palace didn’t show up, I could’ve let you live based on your merit of killing all the Mu Clan’s men. However, now that all of you have witnessed me killing the Nine Stars Palace people which includes their most outstanding prodigy Bai Tao who was one of the Twelve Minor Kings. If words went to the Nine Stars Palace, it could bring me quite a bit of trouble.”

“Therefore, the best way is to kill all those who know about this. That way, word wouldn’t get out. Don’t you agree?” Miss Xiao playfully looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Certainly, I would’ve done that if it was me,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Xiao Heng and the rest started to panic when they heard him saying that.

“Isn’t it? Since even you think so, tell me, is there an excuse for me not to kill you all?” said Miss Xiao playfully.

“Of course there are plenty of excuses. For example, if you’ve killed us, not only you aren’t able to hide the murder of Bai Tao, Luo Zhen, and their lot. You will also deeply offend Narcissus Island.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Oh?” Miss Xiao’s expression changed and immediately laughed. “You are joking, aren’t you? This part of Space-Time has already been completely sealed, who would know if I killed you?”

“I regret to say, Miss Xiao, you probably didn’t notice that the surrounding Space-Time seal had gone through some changes or should I say, there are some flaws?” Jian Wushuang gave a big smile.

“What?” Miss Xiao startled.

Little Li who stood next to her immediately reached out her senses to feel the Space-Time around them. It was true that the Time-Space seal set-up by the Mu Clan experts had already shown some flaws.

“It was you?” Miss Xiao glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, it’s a Space-Time seal which involves Space-Time force. It just so happens that I’m one who studies Space-Time Law and has learned a few tricks. When I was killing the Mu Clan experts, I had already started working on unsealing it—to leave a backdoor for myself, of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You actually had additional energy to shake up the Space-Time seal around you while slaughtering the Mu Clan people?” Miss Xiao was feeling surprised.
