4695 The Three Lively Emperors (3)

Su He looked at the tall and thin old man and said, “If Yang Jun didn’t sense the aura of that Supreme Treasure, our Young Friend wouldn’t even know to take out the Boyang Bottle.”

“Then tell me, where did he get this Boyang Bottle?” the awe-inspiring old man questioned.

The three of them looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and then told him about how he killed the Yan Immortal in the black mountains.

“I see. I knew it was impossible for Young Friend to be on that filthy old man’s side. It’s all because of that stupid Daogong who misled me!” the tall and thin old man said anxiously.

“You’re a simple-minded fellow. You’re just waiting to fall into all sorts of traps,” the awe-inspiring elder said anxiously.

“Daogong,” Su He suddenly said in a serious tone, “we’ve already taken that step that’s beyond redemption. What can we lose now? If we give up on this opportunity today, we’ll be truly doomed.”

The three people who were quarreling suddenly fell silent, no one speaking again.

After a long time, the awe-inspiring old man suddenly rolled up his sleeves and said, “Come on, tell us how to act!”

The corner of Jian Wushuang’s mouth twitched. Then, he asked Chun Qiu to take out the Reverse Heavenly Mystery Mirror that the Young Emperor had given him before he left.

“All you need to do is cooperate with me and save an image in this mirror.”

“Of course, Daogong should be the first to do this. He’s the best at playing dead.”

…

After another deep discussion, the two of them chose Daogong first, almost causing the three to fight again.

After barely convincing the old man, Chun Qiu raised the Reverse Heavenly Mystery Mirror and began to record the scene, as if he was recording a video.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang raised his hand and slashed at the majestic elder.

However, the two only exchanged a dozen rounds before the majestic old man let out a miserable howl and his True Shadow dissipated.

“Stop, stop, no, it’s too fake. That Young Emperor will know it’s fake with just one look.” Chun Qiu shook his head. “We have to highlight the most tragic scene, and at the same time, express the most sincere feelings, the kind that can trigger resonance.”

The majestic old man’s true image appeared, and he nodded thoughtfully. Then, he began a new round of performance.

Then, a strange scene appeared under the sky of the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes.

A figure was holding a mirror, looking for an angle to record images. There were two main characters, demonstrating the tragic and shocking scene over and over again. There were also two old men standing outside the field, giving serious pointers from time to time…

“Lord Young Emperor, there’s news from the Reverse Heavenly Mystery Mirror.”

In the giant hall, the luxuriously dressed figure slowly opened his eyes and waved his hand. An image appeared in the Reverse Heavenly Mystery Mirror that was suspended in the air.

In a world of howling sand, a black-robed figure raised an Invisible Sword in his hand and pressed forward. The vast Sword Intent directly shattered the surrounding sand and bombarded a tall and thin old man without losing momentum.

Even the sky was shattered, and the True Shadow was eventually annihilated in the endless Sword Intent.

Seeing this, the Young Emperor had already sat up from the bed, and his flirtatious eyes revealed an inexplicable look.

“How is this possible? Who is this guy? How could he so easily kill that old guy?”

“My companion, have you found the information I asked you to?”

A thin purple robe appeared in the void quietly. “Your Highness, we have found it. This person’s origin is a mystery. Two servants found him by accident in the deep mountains. When they found him, his aura was extremely weak and there was no injury on his body. Other than that, there was no other news.”

The Young Emperor frowned slightly. This was obviously not the answer he wanted.

Then, he shifted his gaze to the Reverse Heavenly Mystery Mirror and remained silent.

“Your origin is a mystery? Very well, I’m going to dig out your identity bit by bit.”

In the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes, the acting award that lasted several months finally came to an end after Jian Wushuang killed Su He, who had strange polycoria.

Jian Wushuang felt that his head was swollen when he faced the three funny old men. It was far more painful than going through a hundred battles.

Chun Qiu wiped the sweat off his forehead and handed the mirror over to him.

“We’re finally done. I can finally leave this place,” the tall and thin old man said excitedly.

The awe-inspiring old man snorted. “You’re swaggering. Aren’t you going to sleep in the chamber pot?”

“You’re making it seem like you’re not going to use it as well.”

“Alright, you finally admit that the bottle is a chamber pot?”

“You…”

Jian Wushuang hurriedly waved his hand to stop him. “Okay, that’s enough. Please leave with me.”

Only then did the three of them stop a new round of scolding.

Then, the tall and skinny old man took the lead and cupped his hands. “Yang Jun would like to thank you, Young Friend.”

The awe-inspiring old man then said, “My respects and thanks to you, Young Friend.”

The dual-pupiled old man smiled. “Su He and the rest would like to thank you, Young Friend.”

After saying this, the three figures turned into three streaks of golden light and fell into the bottle.

Feeling the vibration from the bottle, Jian Wushuang shook his head helplessly. Finally, it was quiet.

“Let’s go. The Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes has been cleared.” Jian Wushuang looked at Chun Qiudao.

Chun Qiu’s heart was pounding. From the moment he entered the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes with the mentality that he was going to die, to the dramatic ending today, everything had been too mysterious and coincidental.

The purging of the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes meant that he could end his long and dark life as a prisoner and return to freedom.

But then, he felt nervous and uneasy. He looked at Jian Wushuang nervously and asked, “What if, and I mean what if, the Young Emperor goes back on his word? What should we do?”

Jian Wushuang slowly let out a breath of turbid air, and wisps of golden light burst out from the depths of his pupils. “If he goes back on his word, I’ll take him down with me before I die!”

The endless darkness dissipated, and the entire Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes began to clear up. Rivers began to emerge from the ground, and countless trees and vines began to grow wildly.

He turned around and took one last look at the world that had been cleared out. Then, he disappeared.

In front of the bronze hall, two figures quietly landed and walked forward.

The door of the bronze hall was wide open. In the center of the thousand-feet-tall door stood a weak figure.

The Young Emperor seemed to have been waiting for a long time. When he saw the figure appear in the square in front of him, he smiled and said, “My companion, please go and welcome our distinguished guest.”

After saying this, the Young Emperor turned around and entered the palace.

The skinny purple-robed man came to Jian Wushuang and stretched out his hand, as if asking for something.

Jian Wushuang gave him a sidelong glance and then walked straight into the bronze hall.

The strong musky smell with a faint fishy smell was no longer present, and it was replaced by an unknown fragrance.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly and walked in. Chun Qiu followed behind him.

To Chun Qiu, the Young Emperor was a nightmare.

He would never forget the day when his Heavenly Court was destroyed, and the purple-robed figure that appeared.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
