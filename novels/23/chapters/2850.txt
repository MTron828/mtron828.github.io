Chapter 2851: Troublesome

——

Because he knew this, he had only used 1% of his blood essence after diluting it in order to meet Mo Tao.

And he had only taken out one drop.

Until he had no way to take out his perfect blood essence in order to fuse it into the Blood Mountain Sword, and only in front of Mo Tao.

As for selling his blood essence in exchange for a large number of holy elixirs or other treasures… if it was the decomposed blood essence, he could try one or two drops, but there were too many of them, and he would never sell them.

As for his own blood essence, he would never give it to anyone!

Blood essence was a symbol of life. Therefore, selling blood essence was a violation of one’s dignity.

No one, no expert of any bloodline, would sell their essence blood or give it to others unless they were really at the end of their rope.

Mo Tao wanted to say something, but suddenly his expression changed, and he frowned slightly.

“Sword One, we are in trouble,” Mo Tao said.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang looked over.

“You know how loud the noise was when we were refining the weapon, especially the supreme sword essence. It was so loud that some old men in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and a few top experts of sword principle sensed it. As for the surroundings of my Fire Cloud Castle, they are all guessing that I should have refined a great sword principle weapon or treasure. Even the Bone Emperor sent a message to me personally,” Mo Tao said with a bitter smile. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Bone Emperor sent a message personally?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He knew that the disturbance caused by the artifact refinement would definitely attract the attention of some experts.

However, he did not expect that Bone Emperor would be alerted and ask about it personally?

“It’s normal for Bone Emperor to ask about it personally. After all, he was the only one who asked me to refine a treasure using the Holy Heavenly Furnace for so many years. So this time, of course, he wants to know who asked me to refine a treasure using the Holy Heavenly Furnace and what level of magic weapon it is.” Mo Tao smiled.

“It’s just a casual question from bone emperor. I just need to find a reason to tell him about it. The trouble is that the experts who have arrived in my Fire Cloud Castle will definitely find out about it. They might even find a way to find out about it. By then, they might be able to trace it back to you.”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He had come to look for Mo Tao to refine a treasure. If it was just an ordinary treasure, it would be fine. However, the commotion this time was so big. Once people found out that he had asked Mo Tao to refine a treasure, all the experts would definitely target him. By then, there would be a lot of trouble.

Mo Tao naturally knew of this. So he immediately sent a message to his personal disciple Bi Yan.

Not long after, Bi Yan arrived at this empty space.

“Master.”

Bi Yan was incomparably respectful in front of Mo Tao.

“Disciple, how is the situation in the Fire Cloud Castle right now?” Mo Tao directly asked.

“Replying master, ever since you activated the sacred heavenly furnace and started to refine a weapon, the entire fire cloud castle has been shaken. The various powers also quickly received the news. The world overlords of the four pavilions, the various realm lords of the various realm verses, as well as the rulers of some of the major powers in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, all sent messages to ask me about the cause of this matter. However, I only gave them a few words of prevarication and didn’t explain it to them.”

“These people are just here to ask questions, but some experts from the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City have come to visit, especially a supreme elder from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion,” Bi Yan said.

“A supreme elder from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was one of the four pavilions, and its geniuses were as numerous as clouds.

To be able to become a supreme elder, he must be a genuine Immortal Saint.

“How many people in the Fire Cloud Castle know that Sword One came to see me?” Mo Tao asked.

“There should only be four people who know about it,” Bi Yan said solemnly. “The first one is a guard at the level of a novice Great Divine Master. He brought Mr. Sword One into the Fire Cloud Castle.”

“Kill him,” Mo Tao said directly.

Bi Yan and Jian Wushuang were both stunned. The former nodded slightly, then he said, “The second one is junior brother Fan Xin. I thought that Sword One was just an ordinary Advanced Great Divine Master, so I let junior brother Fan Xin pick him up. It was not until Mr. Sword One took out the 12,000 pounds of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal that I personally went to receive him.”

“Fan Xin?” Mo Tao narrowed his eyes. “Tell him that from today on, he will go into closed-door cultivation and can not come out for 10,000 years.”

“Yes.” Bi Yan accepted the order and continued, “The third one is me.”

Bi Yan was a little shocked, but he still had some confidence.

He was different from the guard and Fan Xin. He was Mo Tao’s personal disciple and could be said to be Mo Tao’s successor.

Mo Tao would not go so far as to deal with Jian Wushuang in order to cover up his existence or ask him to enter closed-door cultivation for 10,000 years.

As expected, Mo Tao only exhorted him, “You should know the severity of the matter. You must not reveal the existence of little friend Sword One, and you must not let anyone know that it was little friend Sword One who asked me to refine that magic weapon. Otherwise, even if you are my personal disciple, I will not show mercy.”

“I understand.” Bi Yan heaved a sigh of relief.

“You just said that there should be four people who know of little friend Sword One’s existence, but you only said three. Who else is there?” Mo Tao looked over.

“There’s still one more…” Bi Yan frowned. “Master, the last person who knows of little friend Sword One’s existence is Young Master Qu.”

“Young Master Qu? Which Young Master Qu?” Mo Tao asked.

“He’s the young master of the Heavenly Qu Realm lord.” Bi Yan replied softly.

“It’s him?” Mo Tao’s expression changed. “Why would he come to my Fire Cloud Castle, and how would he know about this matter?”

“Replying master, sixteen years later, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion will open the Dragon-phoenix rankings for the ‘Young Phoenix’. At that time, countless experts would dare to go. And this Young Master Qu has a special liking for the young phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. He wanted to take the opportunity to send a huge gift to that Young Phoenix in order to gain the favor of that Young Phoenix. Hence, he specially rushed here. His motive is the same as Mr. Sword One. He also wanted master to personally refine a special treasure for him.” Bi Yan spoke.

“When Mr. Sword One came to my fire cloud castle, I happened to be in the middle of a conversation with Young Master Qu. When the guard came to report, he did not lower his voice, so Young Master Qu heard that Mr. Sword One had come to visit. However, when the guard reported, it also showed that Mr. Sword One was only an Advanced Great Divine Master. I also instructed Fan Xin to receive him in front of that Young Master Qu.”
