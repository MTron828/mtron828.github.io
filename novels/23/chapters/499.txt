“Take this bell and play with it a little. When you get bored, you can throw it away,” Di Jing said to the beast.

“Moo.” The spirit beast made a slight sound as if it was responding to his master.

Ignoring the eyes of horror on everyone’s faces, Di Jing moved to Jian Wushuang.

“Senior Di Jing.” Jian Wushuang bowed to him.

“I pay my respect to you, senior.” Jian Nantian and Blind Emperor bowed as well.

They were impressed by Di Jing’s power, just as the other experts were.

“Boy, you’re quite capable to have drawn almost all the elders in the Divine Land here.” Di Jing looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

Jian Wushuang forced a bitter smile and replied, “Senior, please don’t tease me. If it were not for you, we would have been torn into pieces.”

“Hump, don’t thank me. I didn’t come here of my own will. I’m just obeying my young master’s order,” Di Jing explained.

“Leng Rushuang’s order?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Young master left home not long ago. Before leaving, she told me to take care of you and help you when you’re in danger.” Di Jing shot Jian Wushuang a glance with a strange expression on his face.

“Young master is aloof and doesn’t have friends. I don’t know how you were lucky enough to draw her attention.”

Jian Wushuang was wordless upon hearing those words, but he finally understood why he did not receive a response from Leng Rushuang when he crushed the Jade Slip.

She had gone to another world.

“By the way, young master told me to only save you once, which means next time you run into danger you won’t get any help from me.” Di Jing stared at Jian Wushuang while smiling and continued, “What’s more, I can only save you and take you to a safe place. As for your enemies, you have to deal with them yourself someday.”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Di Jing could kill all the experts on the spot, but obviously, he would not do so, and Jian Wushuang never expected him to do so.

He was very grateful to Di Jing for saving his life.

“It doesn’t matter, I still owe my life to Leng Rushuang, and someday I must pay her back.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Well, boy, you can’t stay in the Divine Land anymore, so I’ll take you out of here,” said Di Jing.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He knew very well that with so many super experts wanting to know the location of Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion from him, he would be seeking death to stay in the Divine Land, but he was concerned about his father’s safety.

“Senior Di Jing, what about my father and senior Blind Emperor?” Jian Wushuang finally asked.

“Your father...” Di Jing looked toward Jian Nantian and lowed his voice. “Jian Nantian, in order to improve your power, you have walked on a path of no return. It’s very bold of you.”

“A path of no return?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

Jian Nantian stood in silence, and a moment later, he said to Jian Wushuang. “Shuang’er, go with senior Di Jing. I have my own path.”

“Father...” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Boy, your father is right. He has his own path. Since he is already on that path, no one can stop him, not even me or my master. He is on his own.” Di Jing persuaded Jian Wushuang.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned harder. From what was said, he knew there was something wrong with his father, but he was not clear on what it was.

“Father has stepped on a path of no return to improve his power. No one can change his mind or stop him.”

“I had planned to stay in the Divine Land longer, but it seems that I have to go for now.” Jian Nantian murmured and took out a red token. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The token looked unusual. However, using his sheer strength, Jian Nantian broke it.

Whoola! An overwhelming energy surged out from the token and cut the void open, revealing a red door.

The Inside of the door was completely red, as if it led to hell.

“Interesting. Even I dared not enter that door in the past.” Seeing the door, Di Jing gasped.

“Father, what’s going on here?” Jian Wushuang asked anxiously.

“I have no choice, son.” Jian Nantian looked grave as his eyes fixed on Jian Wushuang. “It’s true that there is no turning back on this path, but I have to do so to get a chance to see Wumeng again.”

“Mother?” Jian Wushuang felt rather surprised to hear his mother’s name, and merely said, “Hasn’t mother been taken away by Jiu Xiu?”

“Jiu Xiu? Hell no. Jiu Xiu couldn’t control her. She is not a common woman. She has left this world and this is the only path that can lead me to her.”

“I have to take this path no matter how dangerous it will be!

“Even if there is no turning back!

“As long as I can see her again, I don’t care if I have to become a devil or a ghost.”

Jian Nantian’s voice was frosty but sonorous, and there was a firmness in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang was moved by his words.

There was a smile on the corner of Jian Nantian’s mouth as he cast Jian Wushuang a glancing look, then he entered the door without looking back.

As soon as Jian Nantian crossed the door, the door slowly disappeared in the air.

“Another man who fell deep in love.” Di Jing shook his head.

Jian Wushuang felt lost. It was only after a long while that he took a deep breath to calm himself down.

“Everyone has their own path.

“Since father was so determined, he has to do this on his own.

“Maybe someday, When I become much more powerful, I can help him.

“For now, I’m too weak.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists as the desire for power burned in his eyes.

“Jian Nantian has left, so now it’s your turn.” Di Jing looked toward Blind Emperor and said in a icy voice, “Blind Emperor, you know very well that it won’t change anything even if I save you, don’t you?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed when he heard this.

“What do Di Jing’s words mean?”

Blind Emperor smiled bitterly, “Senior, I know I’m at death’s door, but before dying, I have to complete my mission, so I hope you can grant my wish.”

“Speak,” Di Jing replied.

“I want revenge for my Master!”

Blind Emperor spoke with a cold and decisive tone, one word at a time.
