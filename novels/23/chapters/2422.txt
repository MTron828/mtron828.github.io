Chapter 2423: Everything About Jian Wushuang (1)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The others were even more confused than before, but Jian Wushuang could understand the implicit meaning Pang Tao was putting across.

The genius disciples of various sects present at the scene wore strange expressions. They did not know why Pang Tao made the comment or even mentioned his master, Fan Jianxian.

“Pang Tao, what exactly do you want to say?” Zhong Yi squinted his eyes slightly and stared at Pang Tao.

“Haha, could it be that you, the top genius of Narcissus Island and Senior Brother to Jian Wushuang, knew nothing about your junior brother?” Pang Tao sneered. He then waved to someone by his side. A core disciple of the Great Compassion Sect immediately stepped forward and handed him a jade slip.

Pang Tao took the jade slip and gave Jian Wushuang a deep stare before reading out loudly. “Jian Wushuang, born 21 years ago in Blazing Moon City, Anjiu Commandery. A divine sword came falling from the sky when he was born. A mysterious expert in Anjiu Commandery, Daoist Xuan Shen named him Jian Wushuang, which means a man with indomitable sword skills!”

Many of the talented disciples present were shocked to hear the very first statement.

‘Did he say 21 years ago?’

‘Jian Wushuang was born 21 years ago?’

‘So, he’s only 21 years old this year?’

‘But his cultivation level... He is at the peak of the Chaotic Realm!’

‘A 21-year-old Peak Chaotic Realm?’

“Oh dear, that sounds impossible, right? How can he progress with such cultivation speed?” exclaimed someone.

It was daunting to hear about a 21-year-old who had achieved Peak Chaotic Realm.

No one had ever taken Jian Wushuang seriously before that. It was mainly because of his low cultivation level. He had not even made it into the Divine Demon Realm. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, they had completely changed their minds after hearing about his age. Jian Wushuang was too young.

Those Divine Demon Realm disciples, especially those who were geniuses, had spent almost a hundred years or even hundreds of years to get to where they were.

Yet, Jian Wushuang had achieved Peak Chaotic Realm at the tender age of 21. It would not be long before he caught up with them.

As for the divine sword which Pang Tao mentioned to have descended from the sky and inspired Jian Wushuang’s name sounded improbable so no one gave it much attention.

Pang Tao momentarily paused before continuing to recite the information about Jian Wushuang from the jade slip. “Jian Wushuang, you were unknown from the age of one to 16 and did not show much of a skill until you were 16. When you were only 16, you claimed an instant victory after shattering the weapon of Zhuge Hong—a core disciple from Left Heaven Sect—with just one strike of your sword. At that time, your cultivation level was only at Pure Yang Realm, but your sword principle understanding had achieved Profound Sword Principle Realm!”

“What?”

“It’s impossible!”

The genius disciples around were shocked.

How could he have achieved Profound Sword Principle Realm at the age of 16?

That must have been a joke!

There were many Second-Class Divine Demons, and even some First-Class Divine Demons who spent years in sword skill cultivation, yet they were nowhere near the Profound Sword Principle Realm.

A 16-year-old young man in Pure Yang Realm could not have made such progress even if he had started cultivation when he was in his mother’s womb!

Pang Tao ignored the reactions of those people around him and continued to read from the jade slip. “At the age of 19, something happened at the Lin Mansion. You helped the Lin family because of your father. At that time, you just stepped into the Chaotic Realm. Despite that, you had relentlessly killed two Third-Class Divine Demons in the war and resolved the Lin family’s crisis in one fell swoop.”

Those genius disciples around were flabbergasted.

There was no way what Pang Tao said was true.

‘He killed two Third-Class Divine Demons at the early stage of the Chaotic Realm?’

How could that be?

It was already inconceivable that someone could kill a Third-Class Divine Demon at the peak of the Chaotic Realm.

Many of them shook their heads in denial after hearing what Pang Tao said.

“Not true. That can’t be right!”

“I don’t know where Pang Tao got that information but it sounds bizarre.”

Everyone was doubtful about the information Pang Tao had produced.

Pang Tao continued. “Only three months after you resolved the crisis for the Lin family, two Great Second-Class Divine Demons of Gold Cauldron Sect, Xiang Yi and Qian Yuan, and four Third-Class Divine Demons seek you out to avenge for an elder of the Xiang clan who died. You sweep all of them out in the battle again and behead three Gold Cauldron Sect’s Third-Class Divine Demons. You even defeated both Xiang Yi and Qian Yuan, who were Second-Class Divine Demons...”

Everyone shook their heads.

They were certain that the information was misleading.

If there was a slim chance for Jian Wushuang to have killed Third-Class Divine Demons in the early stages of the Chaotic Realm, it was downright impossible for him to have defeated Second-Class Divine Demons.

After reading the statements, Pang Tao finally lowered the jade slip in his hand. He looked quizzically at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, I found this information about you from the Great Compassion Sect. I must say it sounds pretty interesting.”

“It’s indeed rather interesting.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but he kept his straight face.

“To be honest, I was shocked when I first saw this information. Many statements sounded unbelievable to me. Although this information came from the Great Compassion Sect’s Intelligence Network, I have my doubts about it. Let’s just verify it’s authenticity since I met you here,” said Pang Tao.

“How would you like to verify it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s very simple. A few disciples from Gold Cauldron Sect have entered the tomb. Qian Yuan, who has fought with you, is one of them. He is just somewhere around the corner. Let’s get him to testify about it.” Pang Tao shot his eyes to his side while he was making the suggestion.

Many disciples also looked in the same direction.

That was where the Gold Cauldron Sect disciples gathered.

A total of six disciples from the Gold Cauldron Sect came and Qian Yuan was one of the six disciples.

Qian Yuan clearly heard what Pang Tao said earlier, but he said nothing.

Under everyone’s scrutiny, Qian Yuan stood up and solemnly said, “I don’t like to admit it, but what Pang Tao said just now is indeed true. Back then when we were in front of Lin Mansion in Anjiu Commandery, Jian Wushuang was at the early stage of the Chaotic Realm. However, he had the powers of a Second-Class Divine Demon. Junior Brother Xiang Yi and I joined forces in the battle and although we were not defeated, Junior Brother Xiang Yi and I were at a disadvantage.”

Qian Yuan made a public acknowledgment.

The many talented disciples who determined that the information was false were all taken aback.

“So, it’s true?”

“Jian Wushuang has subdued Second-Class Divine Demons in his early stage of Chaotic Realm! How is that possible?”

“Pang Tao received that information from the Great Compassion Sect and their intelligence network rarely made a mistake. Nonetheless, that was some shocking truth!”
