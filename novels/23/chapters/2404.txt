Chapter 2405: The Repel

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Purple Battle Trooper was incredibly overpowering throughout the battle while perpetually oppressing Wei Qing and the rest.

However, the pressure that Wei Qing endured had greatly decreased due to Xiao Heng’s help.

All they needed to do now was to keep on battling until the rest of the Narcissus Island disciples arrived.

The five teams of Narcissus Island were all in very close proximity. Jian Wushuang and Xiao Heng were the first ones who arrived, but the rest of them were not too far behind either.

In only a short moment, another team arrived, though still a duo of Second-Class Divine Demons. However, they could finally have a fair fight with the Purple Battle Trooper with five people working together after both of them joined in.

A while later, Su Tong who was among the fourth group arrived.

As soon as she arrived, Su Tong directly joined the battle, crossing hands with the Purple Battle Trooper like a bolt of lightning with her First-Class Divine Demon battle strength fully unleashed.

She unleashed multiple silent-stabs using a spear. The spear’s sharp tip stabbed on the Purple Battle Trooper’s gigantic body while her body was moving like a ghost.

The Purple Battle Trooper’s mace swinging speed was fast, but it could not fend off Su Tong’s spear.

“Senior Sister Su Tong’s spear skills are pretty impressive, and her understanding of the spear arts is also extremely high. Looks like she has arrived at Profound Achievement in spear arts.” Jian Wushuang was quietly shocked.

The Purple Battle Trooper was equally a First-Class Divine Demon, however it had no choice but to be manipulated by Su Tong when fighting her. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Its mace could not even touch the corners of Su Tong’s clothes while her spear hit its body time and again.

After more than ten hits, the purple marble on its surface had shown some cracks despite the Purple Battle Trooper’s body being extremely hard. The Battle Trooper had no intention to keep fighting as it turned away and escaped.

Su Tong and the rest did not pursue any further.

After all, it was only one of the few Battle Troopers that Crimson Stone Saint had left in the Saint’s Tomb. Even if they shattered it, there was no other meaning besides being a waste of energy.

“It’s finally defeated?”

Su Tong retracted her spear while feeling relieved when she looked at the direction of the Purple Battle Trooper’s escape. “The Battle Trooper was really a personal creation of Crimson Stone Saint. Not only was its battle strength strong, but its body was also very solid too. After doing more than ten of my spear blows on it, I could only inflict a little crack. I probably would have to hit it a hundred times to break it apart!”

“Plus, this is not the only Battle Trooper. The most terrifying ones in Saint’s Tomb are the Crimson Battle Troopers. I heard that they are comparable to Peak Stage Divine Demons!”

Su Tong exclaimed.

The other core disciples had already relaxed.

Wei Qing and the core disciple in his team who fought the Purple Battle Trooper since the beginning, directly sat on the floor while panting really hard.

“Are you alright?” Su Tong walked up and asked.

“I’m doing quite alright, but Senior Brother Wei Qing...” The core disciple frowned hard.

Everyone immediately looked over at Wei Qing and realized that his face was incredibly pale and his aura was also very weak.

Su Tong went up right away to check on him.

“Not too bad. Although he’s suffering some serious injuries and used up quite a bit of divine power, that would affect his battle strength for a short period of time. As long as he receives help from elixirs, he’ll be able to recover to his peak level within ten days,” said Su Tong.

Hearing her words, the core disciples around nodded quietly.

Although it was difficult for Wei Qing to utilize his full abilities in the next ten days, the battle for the final six positions was taking place more than twenty days later, so he still had time to recover.

“Senior Sister Su Tong, since Senior Brother Wei Qing is injured and his power has decreased, his team would definitely be weakened. If they run into another crisis like this, they probably wouldn’t be able to hold on for this long. Should we perhaps rearrange the teams?” one core disciple voiced out.

“Yes, it is necessary to rearrange, but no hurry. Let’s wait for Senior Brother Zhong Yi’s team to arrive before we discuss,” said Su Tong.

They waited in the field while restoring their divine power.

Not long after, Zhong Yi’s team which was the last team had also arrived.

At the same time, Zhong Yi understood the situation.

“Junior Brother Wei Qing’s injuries are not minor. He’d better not fight in these coming days and focus on recovery, so he can be in the same team as me for the next few days in the outer area,” said Zhong Yi.

“Yes.” Su Tong and the rest all agreed.

It was safe to say that Zhong Yi really lived up to the term ‘Senior Brother’ as the most outstanding Narcissus Island genius disciple of his generation and leader of the ten core disciples at the Saint’s Tomb. Previously, he suggested Jian Wushuang to team up with him in order to balance out each group’s ability while not neglecting Jian Wushuang which Jian Wushuang unfortunately declined.

Now that Wei Qing was injured and could not fight, he asked Wei Qing to join his team.

The five teams were rearranged. As soon as their divine powers were restored, they could start moving again to look for more Purple Amulets.

Suddenly...

In the void not far away from them, black dot lines appeared out of the blue. The black dot lines were charging towards them at incredible speed.

Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and Jian Wushuang immediately noticed the black dots’ presence as they simultaneously looked towards the same direction.

“That’s...” Zhong Yi locked his eyebrows.

“Are they genius disciples from other sects?” Su Tong squinted.

In the blink of an eye, the black dots that were still on the edge of the sky had already appeared before them.

A total of ten figures floated before them.

Leading the ten people was a crimson-haired young man—Tang Xiao from Black Thunder Pavilion!

“I was still wondering who you were, looks like it’s people from Black Thunder Pavilion.”

Zhong Yi sneered mildly when he made out who they were. He looked at the one moving towards him. “Tang Xiao, it’s been a while. Your injury recovered pretty fast and your arms have healed too?”

Tang Xiao’s facial muscles were twitching slightly upon hearing his words.

More than ten years ago, he suffered a big defeat against Zhong Yi. Not only was he severely injured by Zhong Yi, both his arms were also chopped off by Zhong Yi in front of everyone. If Zhong Yi did not take his status as Black Thunder Pavilion’s disciple into consideration, Tang Xiao would probably have been killed.

That battle—although more than ten years had passed—was the biggest humiliation Tang Xiao had ever suffered.

He was there to take revenge, but before he could say anything Zhong Yi had already spread salt on his wound. His feeling of shame was burning his face and the fires of rage started to build up inside.
