Chapter 1117: Massacre!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“That fast?”

“How is that possible?”

The Jin Kingdom experts were all deeply shocked after witnessing how Jian Wushuang killed the cold and severe-looking young man and the girl with bluish-green hair.

In fact, they barely had any time to react to how quickly and effortlessly Jian Wushuang killed an advanced-level and a medium-level Celestial Master.

His eyes were steely and his killing intent was still strong. In the next second, he was once again displaying his power.

He appeared behind a Jin Kingdom expert.

The expert was a genuine advanced-level Celestial Master who had just obtained one pellet of Life Elixir. Two Green Fire Palace experts were currently besieging him and cornering him into a rather pathetic state.

Out of the blue…

“Die!”

The expert turned his head when he heard Jian Wushuang’s roar.

The only thing he saw was a dazzling sword light that was as slow as a snail. Even so, he felt as if he had no way of dodging it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Simultaneously, Jian Wushuang launched a terrifying consciousness attack against the expert. His killing intent also charged at the expert.

The consciousness of this advanced-level Celestial Master was not that strong in the first place. Coupled with the fact that he was facing Jian Wushuang’s sudden ambush, his consciousness instantly turned sluggish.

That sluggishness gave the sword light the opportunity to pierce his throat and crush his Life Core.

In the blink of an eye, another advanced-level Celestial Master had fallen.

“This…”

Everyone, including the two Green Fire Palace experts who had been working together to besiege the Celestial Master, was stupefied.

“That’s an advanced-level Celestial Master, not some subpar trash! But he’s dead in just the blink of an eye?”

“How can he be that strong? Even if he’s a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm, how could he so easily kill an advanced-level Celestial Master?”

“He did it with a consciousness attack! Jian Wushuang’s consciousness attack is incredibly terrifying!”

Startled and furious voices came one after another from experts of both the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom.

“Jian Wushuang, my friend…”

Celestial Masters Yi, Meng Long, and Jin Qu were equally stunned.

They did have some idea of Jian Wushuang’s strength but seventeen years ago, he was only capable of defeating an advanced-level Celestial Master with ease. Yet now… It was like mere child’s play for him to kill the advanced-level Celestial Master. Compared to his level of strength seventeen years ago, he was now evidently much stronger.

“He has become stronger, so much stronger at that!” Yi sighed.

“He’s really a monster!” Celestial Masters Meng Long and Jin Qu could not help themselves from exclaiming in admiration.

It was utter chaos on the battlefield as the experts put their lives on the line to obtain some of the hundreds of pellets of Life Elixir. The lofty Celestial Masters who were rarely seen in the Green Fire Palace most days had thrown all of their esteem out of the window to fight for the Life Medicine.

In a matter of minutes, more than ten Celestial Masters from both camps had died.

Eight of them were from the Jin Kingdom, with three dead by Jian Wushuang’s hands.

“Kill!” Jian Wushuang cried, his killing intent surging high. The dazzling and shrill sword light once again flared.

“Be careful!”

“It’s Jian Wushuang!”

“Be careful of his consciousness attack!”

“Here comes Jian Wushuang! Hurry up and run!”

Wherever Jian Wushuang went, he left behind a trail of cries and screams.

Ever since his three Sword Principles were promoted to the level of Creation Level, his overall strength had increased sharply. Compared to seventeen years ago, he was now a whole realm stronger. With his current power, he would be on par with a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm if he used full force. More importantly, his swordsmanship was unusual!

His Sheer Shadow swordsmanshiphid a consciousness attack that was unimaginably swift and imbued with killing intent. Once he swung his saber, nothing but death awaited medium-level Celestial Masters with an ordinary consciousness.

Even among advanced-level Celestial Masters, there was a portion of them who were relatively weak. If they were confronted with Jian Wushuang’s consciousness attack, they would be greatly affected as well. Once their reaction slowed by just a beat, they would also die in his hands.

The experts from the Jin Kingdom who had witnessed firsthand the ferocity of Jian Wushuang’s consciousness attack began guarding against such attacks. However, even with sufficient mental preparation, it was difficult to block such attacks.

“Die!”

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was razor-sharp as he showed the Jin Kingdom experts, who were wrestling with the Green Fire Palace experts, no mercy.

He moved so swiftly that his body was a blur as he weaved through the crowd, switching between grabbing the pellets of Life Elixir near him, killing the Jin Kingdom experts, and helping fellow Green Fire Palace experts who had fallen into peril.

Jian Wushuang displayed the full extent of his power.

He was like a storm that swept through the battlefield, leaving behind skeletons in his wake. The blade of his Blood Mountain Sword had been dyed red.

This was a massacre!

This could even be described as a ruthless slaughter!

This slaughter caused many experts on the battlefield to tremble in fear.

Of course, this frenetic slaughter soon drew the attention of all the Jin Kingdom experts. They watched a peer in the Exception Realm closest to them fall to the ground.

“Don’t be hasty, young one!”

The one who spoke was a tall and sturdy old man wearing a similar golden armor. He was armed with a heavy sword that was a whopping ten Chinese feet long and carried an unthinkable weight.

When the old man swung such a massive sword, he caused an outbreak of a gale with the sword. The sword was like a tsunami, sweeping Jian Wushuang from the front with a violent force.

“He’s a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted and his mouth curved into a bloodthirsty smile as he took a step forward.

The moment he took the step, he immediately lifted the sword in his hand. Simultaneously, the old man lifted his heavy sword and swung it at Jian Wushuang at once.

The sword movement with the strongest offensive power… Earth-shattering!

“Clang!”

The terrifying sound of an explosion rang out in the middle of the battlefield. The aftermath of their collision rapidly swept their surroundings, forcing the Celestial Masters near them to retreat.

The collision threw Jian Wushuang off, forcing him several steps backward.

“This is indeed a Celestial Master in the Exceptional Realm! What formidable strength!”

Excitement flitted across Jian Wushuang’s eyes, not at all discouraged despite being at an absolute disadvantage. Once he regained firm footing, he once again charged at the old man.

“Die, young one!” The murderous desire in the tall and sturdy old man’s eyes was overwhelming as he once again thrust his heavy sword.

“Die, young one!” The murderous desire in the tall and sturdy old man’s eyes was overpowering as he once again thrust the heavy sword in his hand.

The two of them once again collided… “Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!”

The resulting explosions caused frightening, ear-splitting booms, the madness spreading everywhere.

In the middle of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and the old man confronted each other head-on.

The moment the two of them began fighting, their battle was already at its climax.
