Chapter 722: Challenging

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What? No one has the courage?”

Seeing no one dare to stand out, Gu Lan had a larger smile. Then he noticed Jian Wushuang next to him and his eyes immediately lit up.

“Jian Wushuang,” Gu Lan turned to Jian Wushuang.

“Erm?” Jian Wushuang raised his head in surprise.

“I heard from Elder Ying that you’re a descendant of the Militant Warriors.” Gu Lan paused and then continued, “I heard about the stories of the Militant Warriors long ago. They dared to break into the Boundless Wilds and fought with the Wilds Beasts. Because they constantly adventure on the edge of life and death, they are much stronger than the clansmen at the same level. I’ve always greatly admired them, but I have never been fortunate enough to meet any of them.”

“Until I finally met you, a descendant of the Militant Warriors.”

“You were injured at that time, so I could not challenge you, but you seem to have recovered. Do you have the courage to fight with me now?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang forced a smile.

He just came here to watch the fierce battle, but he never expected that Gu Lan would challenge him directly.

But Jian Wushuang understood that the clansmen were aggressive by nature. Even though they did not have any conflicts of interest, they often fought with each other. Since he was said to be a descendant of the Militant Warriors, it was normal for the members of the Eighth Tribe to challenge him.

“How about it? Are you brave enough?” Gu Lan said. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Of course. If you want, I’ll fight with you.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes became sharp. He also wanted to know the real strength of the Ancient God Clansmen.

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s answer, Gu Lan laughed and the other clansmen immediately opened up a path for him. Jian Wushuang walked forward and stood in front of Gu Lan.

“Jian Wushuang, be careful.”

Gu Lan reminded him, then he suddenly stamped his feet heavily.

Bang! The ground under his feet immediately cracked. Gu Lan turned into a phantom and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. He snorted and clenched his huge fist, releasing an explosive power.

His punch seemed to be able to destroy a huge mountain.

It caused an intense blast that carried terrifying power.

However, Jian Wushuang did not dodge Gu Lan’s punch. He stood there and also threw a pure punch, but he only exerted 70 percent of his strength because he was unclear Gu Lan’s real strength.

Even so, he had nearly reached the offensive power of a Divine Realm expert because of his cultivation method and strong body.

The two huge fists quickly collided.

Bang!

With a muffled sound, Jian Wushuang felt that his right hand go numb and a pain passed along his arm. He was even knocked backward.

“Gu Lan hasn’t experienced baptism, so he’s not an Ancient God yet. According to the levels of Human Warriors, he’s just a Skyscraping Realm expert. How can he be so physically strong?”?Jian Wushuang felt it so incredible.

He knew that the Ancient God Clansmen were best at physical strength.

But he did not expect that Gu Lan would be so powerful before he became an Ancient God and be much stronger than ordinary Divine Realm experts.

Whoosh!

Gu Lan approached Jian Wushaung again and punched with both fists this time.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Each punch rushed towards Jian Wushuang with a terrifying power. Jian Wushuang exerted himself to resist, but he was overpowered by Gu Lan in terms of physical strength, so he was forced to retreat.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, you’re just so-so as a descendant of the Militant Warriors. I only used 80 percent of my power to defeat you,” Gu Lan laughed.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. He suddenly turned his palm upside down and a longsword appeared in his palm.

It was not the Emperor Sword though, it was just an ordinary one.

“Oh, are you going to use your weapon? Hmph, it makes no difference,” Gu Lan sneered.

“We’ll see,” Jian Wushuang smiled confidently.

Gu Lan appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and released another violent punch towards him. However, Jian Wushuang did not punch back this time. Instead, he waved the longsword, causing an immaterial vortex to instantly appear.

Gu Lan’s fist landed on the vortex but was continuously weakened by it. In the end, the power of his fist was completely dissipated.

“This?” Gu Lan looked surprised.

Before he could figure it out, Jian Wushuang swung the longsword casually, once again. The sword light appeared to be slow, but it was so fast in Gu Lan’s eyes, making him feel as if he could not dodge it.

Gu Lan felt a little anxious and raised his fist to smash the sword light.

Swoosh! He missed the sword light and it continued forward, gliding over his shoulder and leaving a tiny sword scar.

“Damn it!”

Gu Lan’s expression changed. He turned back and struck forward with his knee. However, Jian Wushuang dodged it easily and swept out with his longsword, causing another vortex to appear.

The vortex surrounded Gu Lan and slammed him against the ground, but Gu Lan immediately struggled to stand up.

“One more time!”

Gu Lan shouted and put on a pair of Divin Level red boxing gloves, which could enhance his offensive power.

Jian Wushuang just stood there, swinging his longsword casually to resist Gu Lan’s attacks and leaving some scars on him.

“He’s too slow and clumsy. His attack method is also too simple and predictable. He has nothing but brute force,”?Jian Wushuang thought, shaking his head.

Gu Lan was physically strong but weak in other aspects, especially in close combat. Perhaps because he had not experienced any life-and-death battles or mastered any skills. He was like a baby who could raise a heavy sword but was unable to display its full power.

Jian Wushuang just waved his sword casually to resolve his attacks with ease and even teased him.
