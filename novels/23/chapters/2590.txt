Chapter 2591: Oppression of the World

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Rumbling... Under the vast soul power’s impact, the sky-filled sword intent began to slowly fade away.

“Soul World at the Profound Achievement? This guy is definitely a Heaven Ultimate God in his peak!” Jian Wushuang’s heart was heavy.

Every improvement step in Principle World was extremely difficult.

Likewise, Jian Wushuang had finally set up his very own Sword World more than ten years ago. At that time, he was only capable of displaying the Introductory Level.

Ten years after he killed San Shouwang and became the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, his greatest improvement was his sword principle understanding but it only allowed him to progress from the Introductory Level to the Merit Level. In fact, he barely crossed over into the Merit Level.

This was because of his exceptionally high capabilities in understanding principle. He had a couple of enlightenment in the process which sped up his progress. An ordinary cultivator probably needed a long time to do the same.

Most Earth Ultimate Gods only managed to achieve the Introductory Level in Principle World with only a few top-tier high achievers capable of reaching the Merit Level. Jian Wushuang was one of those few. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Only Heaven Ultimate Gods could reach the Profound Achievement in Principle World. In fact, many weaker Heaven Ultimate Gods or those at the lower-tier were unable to achieve that level.

The Soul World displayed by Zhong Hun was similar to a Principle World albeit slightly weirder.

In that sense, only a Heaven Ultimate God was capable of displaying a Profound Achievement Soul World.

Jian Wushuang sneered, “It’s shameful for a Heaven Ultimate God like you to come to a small Stellar Region like the Northern Darkstar Territory and absorb soul power from cultivators to recover your strength. You really are miserable. Regardless, you are not in your peak state now. Do you think you can crush me with your Soul World alone? You must be dreaming!”

As soon as you said that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a cold sword-light.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Countless stronger sword intent than he previously displayed appeared.

Jian Wushuang no longer reserved his strength as his 100,000 miles Sword World was completely displayed.

That terrifying sword intent swept around wildly from its sudden power surge and crashed on the Soul World...

Wow... The palpable soul power that filled Heaven and Earth quickly disappeared like the tides. It was being compressed to what seemed like a small area.

“How can it be?”

Zhong Hun was shocked. “A Merit Level Sword World has suppressed my Profound Achievement Soul World? How wide is his Sword World? Eighty thousand miles? Ninety thousand miles?”

“No, even a ninety thousand miles Sword World cannot possibly achieve this effect. Is it possible his Sword World has reached the ultimate distance?”

Zhong Hun was shocked.

He believed Jian Wushuang’s Sword World had likely reached the ultimate distance which was 99,999 miles.

However, it was still an understatement.

Jian Wushuang’s Sword World was the most perfect 100,000 miles Sword World.

The perfect Sword World was much stronger than the so-called ultimate Sword World.

Boom!

The sky-filled sword intent continued to engulf Zhong Hun’s Soul World and shrunk it again until it almost collapsed.

“Oh, God!” Zhong Hun was terrified and at the same time felt an unprecedented shocking force on him.

He was a Heaven Ultimate God who had seen countless powerful experts. The Principle World displayed was very impressive and had a powerful deterrent effect. However, he had never experienced something of a similar deterrent effect.

The huge Sword World enveloped Jian Wushuang as he had also made a move.

Wow!

The icy dazzling sword-light slashed out and destroyed everything that crossed its path!

Zhong Hun finally took it seriously as used the spear in his hand to instantly parry the sword-light.

However, his strength was greatly weakened from the Sword World’s oppression.

Clang!

There was a crisp sound as the black spear was slewed by the sword-light. Jian Wushuang’s longsword took the opportunity to thrust forward with its blade aimed directly at Zhong Hun’s neck—like harvesting wheat.

Zhong Hun’s face sank and abruptly retreated. During his retreat, he stretched out his right hand and pointed towards the void ahead.

“Soul Devil Hell!”

Buzz! The vast soul power burst out frantically.

The soul power was as vast as the sea. In the blink of an eye, the void turned into a huge hundred-foot-tall demon shadow with three heads and six arms. Each of the strong six arms was holding a thick black soul chain.

After it took shape... Whip! Whip! Whip! The demon shadow’s arm swung those three chains and slammed fiercely toward Jian Wushuang’s sword shadow.

Jian Wushuang was immediately forced to retreat.

Just when he regained his foothold... Buzz... The vast soul formed again on both sides of the voids around him as two similar hundred-feet-tall statues with three heads and six arms each holding a black soul chain formed.

There are three demon shadows with each having six black soul chains—a total of 18 soul chains.

In an instant...

Swash! Swash! Swash! Swash! Swash!

The soul chains frantically waved and attacked Jian Wushuang concurrently from three directions.

Jian Wushuang also immediately waved his longsword to ward off the attacks—throwing the chain out and away from him.

Just as he knocked those chains away, Zhong Hun melted into the surrounding void filled with a large amount of soul power and had completely turned into darkness. Jian Wushuang immediately spread his soul power as he disappeared. Although Jian Wushuang could feel Zhong Hun was still somewhere in the surrounding void, his exact location could not be found.

“I must say that Zhong Hun is quite good.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

Zhong Hun was well hidden in one of the voids among the surrounding dark voids.

He stared closely toward Jian Wushuang who was fighting frantically with the three demon shadows in the dark void’s center.

“I’ve looked down on this Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord and didn’t expect his strength to be so great—forcing me to use Soul Devil Hell. It seems my Soul Devil Hell can’t do much harm to him with my current recovered soul power,” murmured Zhong Hun.

He could see that the three demon shadows were showing terrifying power with the eighteen soul chains also launching incessant attacks on Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang with his sword and Sword World that seamlessly complemented his strength managed to knock the eighteen soul chains. The three demon shadows were unable to gain the slightest advantage against Jian Wushuang let alone to kill Jian Wushuang.

“The only way to wipe him out is probably that trick!”
