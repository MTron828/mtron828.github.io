Chapter 424: Desperation!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Every thrust of the sword was exerted explosively at the Void ahead. The technique was not much different from that of the man depicted in the painting.

However, the power and speed of the Sword Technique rose insanely with every thrust. Furthermore, there gradually emerged the consolidation of a resolve and a tireless essence.

When the essence had consolidated to its peak, Jian Wushuang’s eyes opened violently, only for a beam of intense light, which was akin to an electric arc, to shoot across the Void.

Subsequently, the longsword in his hand transformed into a beam of lightning and shot forth as well.

Carrying a resolve and a tireless essence, the sword swept across and struck on the Void directly ahead.

Though the sword clearly did not hit any material object, and instead only struck the air in the secret chamber, it nevertheless caused the spread of an immaterial ripple. “Boom...” The air emitted a loud roar as if it was about to shatter completely.

“Desperation!”

Jian Wushuang sheathed his longsword. In his eyes flickered an intense radiance.

“What a terrifying move. It has not only a resolve but also a tireless essence. Although it expends an abnormally large amount of Spiritual Power, its power is truly incredible. Compared to the first move, Traceless, it’s stronger by nearly 10 times. It has certainly proven itself to be the strongest Sword Skill personally invented by the Sword Ancestors!”

He felt that Traceless, the first move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, was not powerful enough, and therefore he rarely used it to fight.

The second move was completely different, however.

“My offensive power has increased by nearly 10 times simply by understanding the second move!” Jian Wushuang felt pleased inwardly.

It should be noted that his strength had spurted when he consolidated the Origin Mark, which thereby enabled him to compete with Stage Three peak experts. Now, having understood the second move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, his maximum offensive power had shot up by nearly ten times. This meant that, in terms of offensive power, he had surpassed the vast majority of Stage Three peak experts.

At least, among the Stage Three peak experts who had come along, Xue Yang and Beast could surely not compare to him in terms of offensive power. Neither was it clear whether Bone King, who was the strongest among them and was unrivaled at the Heaven-defying Level and below, could.

And this was only regarding offensive power. It should be known that Jian Wushuang also possessed Realms. If he used their suppressive abilities, he would remain capable of exerting his full power whereas Bone King and the others would find their strengths affected and their offensive power greatly diminished.

“My speed and defensive skills are outstanding, and my self-preservation methods are extremely strong. Among the countless experts of the Saint Realm in Flaming Battlefield, only a handful are my match. My only weakness was that my offensive skills weren’t the most powerful. But now, having understood the second move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, this weakness has been offset completely. My overall strength has reached an entirely new level.” A bright glint surged in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Previously, by relying on his Realms, he gained the confidence to fight against experts on the same level as Beast and Xue Yang. However, the Realms could only ensure that he would not be defeated. They did not help him to win outright against such experts.

He would have been utterly trounced by enemies on Bone King’s level.

Now, however, he no longer needed to be afraid of facing Bone King. If they really fought, he could even confidently use his Realms to stifle the latter somewhat.

“I have to thank this painting.”

After a brief moment of pleasant surprise, he looked at the painting once more. This time, he noticed that at one corner of the painting was a line of tiny words.

“It turns out that this technique is the most powerful skill invented by Jiushe Lord.” Jian Wushuang gasped silently. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Jiushe Lord was a peak expert in the Cloud Realm and was only inferior to the Marquis. Experts of his level were qualified to invent their own Sword Skills.

The technique in the painting was the most powerful one invented by Jiushe. Among first-grade sword techniques, it should be one of the most powerful as well. However, because it was a single move, it could not be considered a truly complete Sword Skill.

“In any case, I still have to thank Jiushe Lord.”

After laughing briefly, he bent his body and bowed toward the painting. Only then did he quietly turn his body and walk out of the secret chamber.

He made his way to the main palace of the cave mansion, only to see Bone King there alone. He guessed that Xue Yang, Beast, and the rest were still at the two spots of opportunities for Origins.

“So fast?” Bone King was surprised to see Jian Wushuang coming over. He subsequently laughed while asking, “How was it? Did you gain anything?”

“Indeed.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head, laughing.

“Based on the look on your face, the gain must have been quite substantial,” Bone King remarked with interest.

Jian Wushuang did not reply but nodded internally.

The gain was indeed huge, to the extent that he felt pleasantly surprised.

He would not feel bad even if the ultimate task of this mission could not be completed and the ten thousand battle achievements could not be attained, for his gain was already very substantial.

Bone King began to chat idly with Jian Wushuang in the main palace, but suddenly, boom... Several strong auras traveled forcefully toward them. An icy voice accompanied the auras and sounded thunderously in every corner of the cave mansion.

“What audacity y’all have to capture Jiushe Cave Mansion. None of you shall leave here alive.”

The faces of Jian Wushuang and Bone King turned grave like never before.

“They have arrived!” There was a slight heaviness in Bone King’s voice.

“It has only been half a day. Pale Moon Marquis’ camp is quick indeed,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Almost immediately, Xue Yang, Beast and co. appeared within the main palace.

“Lady Red, you shall continue to fix up the Formation. Everyone else, follow me out.” As soon as Bone King spoke, the party except for Lady Red hurriedly headed toward the exit of the cave mansion, and swiftly reached the upper Void outside.

As soon as he had stepped out of the cave mansion, Jian Wushuang saw that there were many figures standing erect in the middle of the Void ahead.

They consisted of men and women, young and old. There were altogether nine of them, and their auras were all exceptionally strong. Every one of them was a Stage Three peak expert. The leader among them was a blood-haired demonic youth whose demonic eyes could cause one’s heart to lurch.

“Duo Xin Marquis?”

Upon seeing the demonic youth, even Bone King could not help his pupils from constricting.

Like Bone King, Duo Xin Marquis was one of the experts in Flaming Battlefield who were the closest to the Heaven-defying Level. His way of doing things was eccentric, and he had given himself the title of Marquis. While he was similar in strength to Bone King, his fear factor was significantly greater than the latter’s.

Aside from him, the other eight arrivers were each extremely famous in the Inner Area and exceptionally powerful. Including Duo Xin Marquis, the nine of them’s combined strength was way above that of Jian Wushuang’s seven-man party.
