Chapter 425: A Fierce Battle

“So it’s actually you, Bone King.”

The blood-haired demonic youth, Duo Xin Marquis, glanced at Bone King and co. “You certainly have some guts to lead your men to capture a place as highly valued within Pale Moon Marquis’ camp as Jiushe Cave Mansion.”

“Duo Xin Marquis, I’m sure you haven’t come to talk nonsense, right?” Bone King responded in an indifferent voice.

“Aren’t you pleased to say a few last words before your death?” The former mocked.

“You think you can kill me?” The latter was even more disdainful.

“You shall know right away whether I can.” The Marquis did not waste any more breath. “Kill him!”

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Beams of flowing light sped through the air murderously.

“Leave Duo Xin Marquis to me, and be careful while taking care of the others. He Yunchong, being the weakest, you just have to ensnare one of them.” After speaking, Bone King turned toward Jian Wushuang. “Swordsman, it’s time to see what you’re made of.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head, and immediately summoned Road to the Underworld and Tenfold Realm.

The two Realms formed into a Blood River which surged toward the enemies.

The onrushing Duo Xin Marquis and co. were momentarily stunned.

“These strange Realms are causing me great suppression just by being in their midst. This person is probably the swordsman who came to prominence in the Inner Area recently, right? I’ve long heard that his Realms are something else, and it does appear that they live up to their repute.” Duo Xin Marquis’s face turned grim.

“However, it’s only his Realm Techniques which are troubling. His strength is terribly average. Spectre, find an opportunity to act and kill him.”

“Yes.” Following behind Duo Xin Marquis was a petite woman, veiled in a black robe, who acknowledged softly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They were both clear that Jian Wushuang’s Realms were a concern which was best taken care of as soon as possible.

“Kill!”

A killing intent surged in Bone King’s eyes. He was the first to advance murderously at the enemies, while beside him, Xue Yang, Beast, and co. quickly followed.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Fast as thunderbolts, these figures quickly traversed the Blood River and appeared in front of Pale Moon Marquis’ experts.

“Their speeds are considerably faster than ours under the suppression caused by the Realms.” Duo Xin Marquis’ gaze was somber. He would be the first person Bone King came for.

“Duo Xin Marquis, it’s been a long time since we fought. Time to play.” Bone King sneered.

“Who’s the scared one?” Duo Xin Marquis snorted. A fan-shaped arc light swept forth and a blood-red wicked machete, which held a monstrous power, appeared in his hands. Although it was not first-grade, it was certainly among the very best of the second-grade.

Bone King was indignant and brutal in response. He promptly slapped a palm, which was akin to a Majestic Mountain, forth.

While Bone King and Duo Xin Marquis were exchanging blows, the other experts on both sides quickly did the same.

At first, Pale Moon Marquis’ party was considerably stronger than Jian Wushuang’s squad, and because it had two more Stage Three peak experts than the latter, it should reasonably have had an absolute advantage. However, this advantage had been reduced to an extremely small amount thanks to the suppression from Jian Wushuang’s Realms.

Take Xue Yang for example. His strength was already immense, but because of the Realms, he could now easily fight alone against two Stage Three peak experts.

This went for Beast as well.

Among the others, only He Yunchong was somewhat weaker. But because of the Realms’ effect, he managed to ensnare a rival Stage Three peak expert who was unable to break from his grasp.

As for Jian Wushuang... everyone had believed that although his Realm Technique was powerful, his actual strength was average at best, and that he would at most be able to deal with one Stage Three peak expert. Instead...

Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!

Jian Wushuang struck out beam after beam of sword light. Although he seemed to be doing so casually, in reality, every strike contained great power. Behind him, two giant Sword Soul Phantoms rose up. With their assistance, every one of his strikes reached the threshold of the peak of Stage Three.

His opponent was a green-clothed elder who was also at the peak of Stage Three in terms of battle strength. However, under Jian Wushuang’s unceasing stream of sword light, the elder became helpless like never before. The latter laboriously swung the long staff in his hand and exchanged blows with the former time and again, but came off worse in every exchange.

“B*stard, who was it that said this swordsman’s strength is average even though his Realms are strong?” The elder whined in his heart. “Every one of his strikes reaches the threshold of the peak of Stage Three. Even without these Realms, I might not be able to defeat him. And with them, I’m completely not his match.”

From different sections of the battlefield, Bone King, Xue Yang, Beast, and the rest noticed what was going on, and could not help revealing their joy.

“Swordsman, good job!” Bone King remarked.

“Haha, seems like I underestimated you, Swordsman.” Beast laughed brazenly.

Previously, when they met at Bone King’s cave mansion, he was somewhat derisive of Jian Wushuang, and felt that the latter was only good in Realm Technique. He completely belittled the latter’s actual strength.

But now, seeing the latter’s fight against an expert from Pale Moon Marquis, he finally understood that Jian Wushuang’s importance to this mission was far above his.

It was only because of the swordsman’s Realms that they were able to contend with experts from Pale Moon Marquis’ camp despite having a severely weaker lineup.

Furthermore, Jian Wushuang himself had displayed amazing strength and utterly outclassed a Stage Three peak expert.

Conversely, the expressions of the experts from Pale Moon Marquis’ camp were rather awful.

“This swordsman’s strength is obviously much stronger than the rumors suggested. It has reached the Peak of Stage Three.”

“His Realms are a huge problem.”

“Spectre.” Duo Xin Marquis called out softly.

A silent ghost-like figure drifted forth. It was the petite woman who was veiled beneath a black robe.

She had been waiting for an opportunity throughout and had yet to act. However, she finally got moving upon hearing Duo Xin Marquis’ words.

Jian Wushuang was still fighting against the green-clothed elder. His casual strikes were packed with the battle strength of the Peak of Stage Three, and together with the effect of the Realms, were causing great misery to the elder. But right at this moment...

“Huh?”

He felt a shudder in his heart. It was a sense of danger.

“Killer.”

He was all too familiar with this feeling. He had been the target of numerous assassination attempts by Blood Feather Tower in Nanyang Continent, and each time a Blood Feather Tower killer sneaked up on him, he would have a feeling like the one he was currently having.

“Hmph.”

With a grunt, Jian Wushuang abruptly transformed his body. He exerted the first phase of the Triple Shift.

“Woosh!”

Jian Wushuang’s body split open, and at once, a beam of black light shot out from it, which did not spill a single drop of blood.

“Residual Shadow?” The petite black-robed woman was astounded on the spot.
