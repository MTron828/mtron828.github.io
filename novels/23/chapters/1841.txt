“Jealous? Jealous of who?” Jian Wushuang asked subconsciously.

“Emperor Bai, I guess. In Eternal Chaotic World, besides Emperor Bai, who else could make him jealous?” Emperor God Liu Guang smiled, “As for the reason why he didn’t like you, I think you should be able to make a wild guess.”

Jian Wushuang kept quiet.

He heard Emperor God Liu Guang and he naturally understood.

Abysmal Saint Master, the third place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. It was said that he and Red Dragon King on the second place were evenly matched. Because Red Dragon King’s defense power was higher, he was listed at a higher rank than him. There was nothing to be jealous about with Red Dragon King. However, it was different from Emperor Bai.

Emperor Bai, he was widely acknowledged as the strongest in Eternal Chaotic World. He was a superb existence that could kill another Great Emperor.

Although Abysmal Saint Master was in the third place, he was fearful of Emperor Bai. He couldn’t stand the feeling of fear. Hence, he might be jealous of Emperor Bai.

As for the reason why Abysmal Saint Master was unhappy with him… it was because he was greatly talented and had too great of a potential.

Once he received the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill and broke through to being an Almighty, he would definitely have fighting power of a Great Emperor. If he were to improve more, he could easily reach the level of Abysmal Saint Master and Red Dragon King. If he were to reach his peak in growth, he could totally become the second Emperor Bai.

One Emperor Bai had already made Abysmal Saint Master super jealous, but there was another one?

“From what I know, Fortress Master Hong Tian has nothing to do with Abysmal Saint Master. Fortress Master Hong Tian isn’t his man. But he descended his consciousness clone for Fortress Master Hong Tian and wanted to stop me from killing him? He was obviously aiming at me. He said earlier that Sanctuary Alliance felt a strong antipathy towards me. I think it was just him alone.”

“If it wasn’t me who had barged into Deluge Fortress today but another powerful Peak Emperor God, Abysmal Saint Master might not care,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and said.

“Very possibly,” Emperor God Liu Guang said, “and he only descended his consciousness clone after all. It didn’t possess any fighting power. If he were to descend personally, he might use that as an excuse to kill you. Maybe because he has scruples with Sanctuary Alliance, he wouldn’t kill you directly but he could punish you slightly.

“Hehe, it seems like Abysmal Saint Master is quite dictatorial,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Whoever is powerful could be dictatorial. In actual fact, many Great Emperors of Sanctuary Alliance who are high above are all dictatorial. There is no one who dares to go against their will. Once someone goes against them, punishment is considered a mild treatment. Sometimes, they might even take action to kill some Sir Gods and Emperor Gods. Comparatively, Emperor Bai, who is highest of all, takes note of his identity and almost never descends to punish Sir Gods and Emperor Gods.”

As for the Great Emperor that Emperor Bai killed, he was immoderate in conduct and stepped over Emperor Bai’s bottom line. Hence, Emperor Bai killed him,” Emperor God Liu Guang said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “Whatever. I never provoke any of the Great Emperors anyway. The Great Emperors shouldn’t kill me personally. After all, they have to consider the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance who are anticipating my growth. Just like Abysmal Saint Master who didn’t like me and didn’t want me to grow, he didn’t dare to do anything about me in public. At most, he would play some tricks at the back.”

“That’s true,” Emperor God Liu Guang nodded in agreement.

“Let’s go. Let’s leave.”

Jian Wushuang immediately left with Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin. The drove out from Abysmal Sanctuary at the fastest speed.

In the ancient silver spaceship, Jian Wushuang sat together with Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin. As for Jian Yi, he stood by the side politely.

“Haha, it felt great. It was a great fight. Thirteen Almighties, including Fortress Master Hong Tian, none of them escaped and all are killed,” Emperor god Jiu Yin looked excited.

Although he was an Emperor God and had once participated in many massacres, he had only seen once or twice a scene where thirteen Almighties had died together.

Plus, the deceased included Peak Emperor God, like Fortress Master Hong Tian.

“To be able to kill all thirteen Almighties including Fortress Master Hong Tian, such great battle achievement, I have to thank the two of you for your assistance. Thank you,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

“I took a chance to avert calamities for others. It’s nothing. To be frank, I didn’t do much for this fight and I received a Chaotic Divine Treasure. I feel a little embarrassed,” Emperor God Jiu Yin rubbed his nose.

The biggest killer of the fight had been Jian Wushuang.

He had killed more than half of the Almighties alone. Plus, he had performed a great technique to break the formation forceful at the beginning. Then, he had killed Emperor God Bing Can in a short time, which had led to the situation of one-sided domination. It could be said that the fight had succeeded mostly because of Jian Wushuang.

Then, there was Emperor God Liu Gang.

At the beginning of the fight, Emperor God Liu Guang had suppressed Fortress Master Hong Tian so that he didn’t have any chance to attack. Hence, Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Jiu Yin and the four silver-armored Dao soldiers could kill all the other twelve Almighties.

Lastly, there was Emperor God Jiu Yin. He had only held back some Sir Gods. He put in less effort.

“Regardless, without both of your help, it would have been impossible for me to kill Fortress Master Hong Tian and the rest,” Jian Wushuang smiled and then took out the spear that gave out boundless chilliness.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, this is your reward.”

Jian Wushuang passed the spear to Emperor God Jiu Yin.

“Haha, thank you,” Emperor God Jiu Yin took it and was thrilled.

A Chaotic Divine Treasure. Although he didn’t use spear as his main weapon, it was extremely precious to him.

Looking at Emperor God Jiu Yin’s expression, Jian Wushuang asked again, “Emperor God Jiu Yin, I wonder if you would be interested in being Lineage of Star’s Guest Elder?”

“Guest Elder?” Emperor God Jiu Yin raised his eyebrows and smiled, “Sword Emperor, how can I?”

“Guest Elder is only a name. You don’t have to do anything for Lineage of Star normally. Only when Lineage of Star is in crisis, you lend us a helping hand will do. As for the condition… I will give you another Chaotic Divine Treasure, a defense armor!” Jian Wushuang said.

“What?” Emperor God Jiu Yin stunned.

Even Emperor God Liu Guang at the side couldn’t help but look at Jian Wushuang.

Chaotic Divine Treasure was extremely precious, everyone knew that. Defense armor was even more precious than attack divine weapons. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Emperor God Jiu Yin had a Chaotic Divine Treasure level’s divine weapon and it was a divine weapon that he was good at. In addition to the spear that Jian Wushuang gave him, he had two.

The combination of two was far behind a defense armor
