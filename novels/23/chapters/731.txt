Chapter 732: Fighting Jiu You

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In a vast open space, Jian Wushuang and Jiu You stood facing each other, hundreds of feet apart.

Around them were the onlookers from the Eighth Tribe.

“The third Militant Warrior I’ve met.”?Jiu You licked his lips and a sliver of light escaped his eyes.

“Let me test how much I’ve progressed during those 80 years through you, a Militant Warrior who has awoken his bloodline.”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with fighting desire.

As their eyes met in the air, there seemed to be a sparkle between them.

The next moment, Jiu You suddenly disappeared from the sight of the many onlookers, and when he was seen again, he had crossed hundreds of feet to arrive in front of Jian Wushuang. His long red spear struck out right at him.

Carrying formidable power, once the spear caught its target, it could pierce through him.

However, seeing the spear approaching him, Jian Wushuang did not move to dodge it but stood there to watch it go through his body.

But no blood came out, as if the spear had gone through something insubstantial.

“It’s his residual shadow,” someone cried out.

The onlookers’ were wide-eyed in amazement.

The very next moment, Jiu You suddenly spun his head to look to the side.

There, he saw a ghost-like figure appear out of thin air that came slashing toward him.

The blow seemed simple—even a child could make one more complex than that. Even so, Jiu You’s eyes narrowed at the sight of it.

“Good boy. He simplified the move but did not weaken its power.

“This boy is really excellent at swordsmanship.”

Jiu You became serious. His spear swept out and collided with Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“Clang!”

Jiu You heard a deep sound and felt an overwhelming power from the sword. He knew that he had been correct that the blow was not as simple as it looked.

And before he could make his next move, countless sword lights radiated from where the weapons met and flew toward him.

Thousands of moves derived from one move!

“Haha, interesting!”

However, seeing this, Jiu You laughed. He then waved his spear again, and with this single move, countless spear shadows rushed through the air toward the sword light.

“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!”

A series of sounds of metal on metal rang out, and in just a few breaths, they echoed a hundred times.

From those sounds, the onlookers could tell that the two had exchanged a hundred moves.

“They are so fast!”

“They are fighting at a terrifying pace.”

“They are moving so fast that I can barely see how they are attacking.”

The onlookers were astonished by this scene.

Even someone as strong as Gu Yang, a Two-star Ancient God, could not help being amazed.

He was impressed by the fighting skills of both Jian Wushuang and Jiu You.

On the battlefield, sometimes both Jian Wushuang and Jiu You tried to outspeed each other, sometimes they fought with pure power, and sometimes with fighting skills—fully demonstrating what they had.

For a long time, they were locked in a close battle.

“I’ve tried my best to battle him aside from transforming into an Ancient God, but I still can’t gain the upper hand.”?

Jiu You was shocked inside.

As for Jian Wushuang, he looked grave.?“Though he has used all his fighting skills, he has yet to exert all his power and transform into an Ancient God. It looks like I have to use some methods to force him to do that.”?

Having made up his mind, Jian Wushuang changed his strategy. With a quiver of his body, a formidable power surged out from his Sword Heart.

Level Two of the Sword Heart turned out to be more powerful than Level One.

He had only exerted three-tenths of the power of the Sword Heart, but it still improved his attacking force greatly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The others could see that Jian Wushuang’s attacks suddenly had become fiercer than before along with a great increase in speed.

“Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!”

Jian Wushuang made three strikes in succession, each of them looking simple yet exquisite. Under such attacks, Jiu You drew back quickly.

After he finally regained his balance, he had a grave expression on his face.

“Without awaking his bloodline, this boy can still exert the power of a One-star Silver-armored Ancient God! What’s more, he is as good at fighting as I am, but most of all, his swordsmanship is so excellent.”?Jiu You gasped in admiration.

“He’s simplified every one of his moves, which look simple yet are powerful. I’m no match for him in view of this.”

“In order to defeat him, I’ll have to transform into an Ancient God,” Jiu You muttered.

The next moment, he growled in an undertone, and immediately the aura of his bloodline arose and surrounded him.

His body began to bulge to over 10 meters in height.

His whole body was covered by a golden light.

It gleamed brightly under the sparkling demons hanging over the palace.

“He transformed into a Gold-armored Ancient God!”?Jian Wushuang was startled.

Gold-armored Ancient Gods were the most powerful ones among all three of the bloodlines.

Jian Wushuang had met a Gold-armored Ancient God before when he was adventuring in the outer layer of the Eternal Zone. He had witnessed how that god had so easily killed a superior Divine Realm expert like killing a chick. Though, at that time, the god had just awoken his bloodline and had not reached his peak.

“Jiu You, being a Militant Warrior in addition to being a Gold-armored Ancient God, must be much more powerful than the one that I met,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Soon afterward, he was proved to be correct.

“Boom!”

After transforming into a Gold-armored Ancient God, Jiu You stomped hard on the ground, causing the void to shake. He then went up to Jian Wushuang and thrust his 10-meter-long spear at him.
