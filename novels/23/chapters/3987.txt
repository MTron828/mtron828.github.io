Victory!

After Jian Wushuang killed Star Demon Ancestor, the Divine Beginning Realm had truly won the battle.

After the battle, Star Demon Ancestor, Star Demon Ancestor, and Star Demon Ancestor had died, and the army of Star Demon Ancestor had been defeated. Now, the Divine Beginning Realm had returned to the control of the will of the Heavenly Dao.

The greatest crisis of the Divine Beginning Realm had been resolved.

The countless cultivators from the Divine Beginning Realm were overjoyed.

They had won, which meant that the Divine Beginning tribulation had been saved. There was no need for them to abandon their hometown and wander in the universe void.

In the universe void, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath. At this moment, he felt that everything around him was very beautiful.

He took a look at the Divine Beginning Realm in front of him and smiled faintly. Then, he walked directly toward the Divine Beginning Realm.

A large number of people from the Divine Beginning Realm’s camp immediately moved to welcome him.

“Husband!”

Leng Rushuang’s eyes were filled with tears. She was the first to run to Jian Wushuang and directly rushed into his arms.

Jian Wushuang also opened his arms and hugged his wife.

Previously, he was almost determined to die in front of Star Demon Ancestor. He had already said his final farewell to his wife. But now, he survived and came to his wife again, holding his breath, Jian Wushuang could not calm down for a long time.

“My young friend, the Heavenly Marquis.”

Xuan God Daoist, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and the others looked at Jian Wushuang at this moment with complicated emotions in their eyes.

Some of these emotions were excitement, some were admiration, but most of them were gratitude.

They were grateful that Jian Wushuang had killed Star Demon Ancestor and saved the Divine Beginning Realm by himself.

It could be said that Jian Wushuang was the savior of the Divine Beginning Realm. Without him, the Divine Beginning Realm would only end in destruction.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Daoist Xuan God and the others, then grinned and said, “Everyone, the Divine Beginning Realm is safe.”

Safe.

These simple words made countless experts in the Divine Beginning Realm smile knowingly.

Half a day later, in the Third Heaven of the Divine Beginning Realm, where the three holy lands used to be, a huge feast was being held here, where the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was located.

Of course, this feast was a celebration feast!

On the vast and vast plaza, there were densely packed cultivators sitting upright. These cultivators were all contributors who had directly participated in this great battle. Not only were there Rulers, but there were also a large number of Principles Masters, they all had a place on this plaza.

And on the high platform in front of the plaza, there were many thrones standing upright. These were the top experts of the Divine Beginning Realm’s camp.

One of the thrones was particularly eye-catching.

Not only was it larger than the other thrones, but it was also located in the center and the core.

There were two people sitting on the throne. They were Jian Wushuang and his wife. They were sitting on the throne together, and there was a lot of attention around them.

A person’s position depended on his own strength.

In this battle, Jian Wushuang was undoubtedly the first hero. He killed Star Demon Ancestor at the last moment and turned the tide. In terms of strength, he was now the undisputed number one expert in this star area, therefore, he was the absolute protagonist of this celebration banquet.

Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, and the others directly promoted Jian Wushuang to the highest position.

Jian Wushuang had refused at first, but Daoist Xuan God and the others had repeatedly requested that Jian Wushuang sit on the largest and most conspicuous throne.

This throne alone proved Jian Wushuang’s current supreme position.

Although he still respected the leaders of the Divine Beginning Realm, such as Daoist Xuan God and Temporal Temple Master, they no longer regarded him as a cultivator of the same level.

“Everyone.”

Jian Wushuang, who was sitting on the highest throne, suddenly stood up. Leng Rushuang, who was beside him, also stood up at the same time.

The entire banquet quieted down, and countless gazes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

With a smile on his face, Jian Wushuang held a glass of wine in his hand, he said grandly, “All of you here have contributed greatly to this battle. It is because of everyone’s concerted efforts that we in the Divine Beginning Realm can obtain the final victory in this battle. For the sake of this victory, everyone, cheers!”

“Cheers!”

Countless cultivators at the banquet raised their glasses and drank the celebratory wine.

“Haha, wonderful, wonderful!” Daoist Xuan God finished his cup of wine and immediately began to laugh loudly, “It’s been a very, very long time since I’ve had such a wonderful cup of wine. Previously, whenever I encountered something, there would always be a thorn in my heart. It was this thorn that caused me to be unable to eat or sleep. But now, I can finally drink this cup of wine to my heart’s content.”

“You’re right. It’s not just you. We’re all the same. Previously, when the Divine Beginning Realm was in danger, as the leaders of the Divine Beginning Realm, we didn’t dare to relax. But now, this crisis has finally been resolved. Our Divine Beginning Realm has finally settled down. We can sleep now. Seeing the Divine Beginning Realm reach this stage, even if I die now, I can rest in peace.” The Temporal Temple Master laughed heartily.

“Haha, it’s not easy for the Divine Beginning Realm to settle down. We haven’t had a few days of peace yet. You can’t just die like this,” the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master joked.

The other top experts of the Divine Beginning Realm also laughed happily.

Even Di Shisan, who was usually extremely cold, frequently smiled at this celebratory feast.

“Master, we congratulate you for breaking through to the Ruler realm and showing off your divine power to kill Star Demon Ancestor.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Many of the slaves Jian Wushuang brought back from eternal prison had been killed by Star Demon Ancestor, but there were still many alive. Now, Demon Dragon Lord led them to toast Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you, everyone.” After Jian Wushuang drank the wine, he smiled and replied, “Don’t worry, I won’t change my promise. I will definitely give you your freedom within 100,000 years. Now that the Divine Beginning Realm has won the war, it won’t be long before the Divine Beginning Realm is completely peaceful. I don’t think I’ll need you, so I might let you go ahead of time.”

“Early?” The eyes of Demon Dragon Lord and the others immediately lit up.

Jian Wushuang did not lie. He had enslaved Demon Dragon and the others to prepare for the war with Devil Cloud Star.

Now that the war was over, there should be no more danger in the Divine Beginning Realm. With his current strength, these slaves would not be of much help to him, so even if he gave them their freedom in advance…it would not affect Jian Wushuang.
