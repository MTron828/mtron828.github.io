4648 Make a Comeback

The Heavenly Dao vindication had only lasted for ten years, and even becoming an Invincible Supreme had taken 1,000 years.

When all the cultivators saw the sky darken, their hearts trembled.

“Did he fail…? How could he have failed?”

Ninth Kalpa King, Feng Qi, Supreme Xue Bo, and the others were all looking in that direction nervously.

The door of the remote bamboo house, which had been silent for nearly ten years and had never been opened once, was slowly pushed open. Old Master stood by the door with a calm expression.

The two brothers, Lu Ting and Lu Gong, who had gone through many bloody battles with Jian Wushuang, blurted out almost subconsciously, “Brother, did Jian Wushuang fail?”

Lu Ding did not answer, but a faint smile hung on his face. “If he fails just like that, then he’s not the person I approve of.”

The two of them looked at each other. To be able to receive such an evaluation from their big brother, it seemed that Jian Wushuang had succeeded this time.

After ten years, the grass that was originally only an inch long had now reached his knees.

The golden glow in the sky disappeared as quickly as it came. It returned to normal in a very short time.

A gust of wind blew past, and a figure with clouds and mist around him gradually appeared in everyone’s eyes.

However, the unbridled aura of the Immortal Qi made Jian Wushuang, who was only wearing black pants, stand out even more.

Feng Qi laughed out loud. In her memory, this guy seemed to like to rip off his clothes at every important moment.

After that, Feng Qi unfolded the flowing fire wings on her back and took the lead to meet Jian Wushuang.

“Here you go.” Feng Qi stretched out her hand and handed him a white robe. She smiled and said, “You, you can actually break through in such a short time. I really underestimated you.”

Jian Wushuang took the white robe and put it on. He smiled and said, “I was lucky.”

The divine power that spread out from Jian Wushuang’s body was no longer the divine power of an Invincible Supreme. Instead, it was a kind of ethereal and indescribable smoke.

The misty clouds were proof that Jian Wushuang had become a Half Ancestor.

The originally calm atmosphere was completely heated up.

Chu Zhi, who had been rescued by Jian Wushuang from the Void Universe, was watching this scene from a distance.

“Sister Lan Lan, do you think that stupid chess player has reached a very powerful realm? A realm even more powerful than my master’s?”

Lan Lan smiled and rubbed the back of Chu Zhi’s head. “That’s right. He’s already very, very powerful now. He can protect the things he wants to protect.”

Lan Lan was stunned. After a long while, she sighed.

“Sister Lan Lan, do you think that if I want to be the Terrible Chess Player’s Dao Child, will he want me…”

“Don’t worry. If that day comes, he will definitely agree.”

…

A total of 970,000 cultivators, after recuperating for almost ten years, came out of seclusion in the broken Rodu and once again launched an attack on the army of Void Warriors that had invaded the Divine Power Universe.

Every appearance of that tenacious figure who always walked at the forefront of the army was a true transformation.

He was able to fight against a Half Ancestor while he was at the Invincible Supreme realm. Now that he had advanced to the Half Ancestor realm, who could stop him? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Standing on the completely destroyed Rodu Star Field, Jian Wushuang looked back at the endless army behind him. He raised the Tarot Divine Sword in his hand and shouted, “Fight!”

From the Offworld Battlefield to the hinterland of the Divine Power Universe, it had become a dead zone in the ten years since the gate was opened.

The rules of the Great Dao were broken, and his luck was extremely weak.

For some unknown reason, a large area of the Star Field that had become a dead area no longer gave birth to divine power. What replaced it was the birth of weak void power.

Jian Wushuang frowned. In a short ten years, the fate energy of the Divine Power Universe had shrunk to the extreme. It was even affected by the Void Universe and started to be eroded.

As he rushed to the Offworld Battlefield, Jian Wushuang found an army of nearly 10,000 Scar level Void Masters in the Hengyang Star Field area, which had been occupied by Void Warriors.

Jian Wushuang killed the 10,000 Void Masters with a wave of his hand and left a single Six Scar Void Master to ask about the current situation.

After learning that most of the elites of the Void Universe were still stationed in the Offworld Battlefield, Jian Wushuang led the army and killed their way there.

In order to completely destroy the Divine Power Universe, almost every 10,000 Scar level Void Masters formed a unit and rapidly devoured the living forces.

The number of Star Fields and Divine Kingdoms that had been completely destroyed was no less than 10,000!

In the broken Offworld Battlefield, the original base city had been occupied by the army of Void Warriors.

Since the end of the Great Catastrophe War ten years ago, Void Gods had returned to the Void Universe and slept until now.

Even though Devouring Emperor was nowhere to be found, his organization had always been the mastermind behind the plan.

Wherever the Devourers went, no one was left alive.

When the million-strong Divine Power Universe army set foot on the Offworld Battlefield again, all the Void Masters who were guarding the place retreated.

As the sword struck out, a Sword Intent waterfall that seemed to split the world in half surged out. The entire base camp occupied by the Void Warriors was completely destroyed by this sword!

The entire void of the Offworld Battlefield trembled under the Sword Intent waterfall.

Looking at the less than 20 Six Scars Void Masters, Jian Wushuang put away the Tarot Divine Sword and said in a deep voice, “Ask your master to come here and die!”

All the Six Scar Void Masters trembled and turned to flee.

However, in the next moment, the huge crack hidden in the darkness at the intersection of the two universes slowly opened.

Two enormous palms that covered the sky slowly tore apart the barrier.

It was the ancestral phantom form of the Demon God. It had four horns on its head and six dark chains around its body.

Void energy surged, Void God descended from the Demon God phantom form.

When the nightmare-like existence appeared, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and stepped forward.

An equally vigorous and unparalleled divine power rose up into the sky, and an unparalleled phantom image that was unrestrained and sublimated by divine patterns appeared.

This was a true collision between Half Ancestor realm divine power and Ancestor level void power, but the divine power was not suppressed. Instead, it was in a stalemate.

Void God’s eyes were emotionless. Behind him, the countless Void Masters were like demons that had walked out of hell, covering the sky and pressing down.

“The power of the Divine Power Universe is gone. If you commit suicide in front of me, I’ll leave you with an intact corpse.”

Void God’s cold voice resounded. Before Jian Wushuang could speak, the Demon God ancestral phantom form behind Void God raised its arm and pressed down on Jian Wushuang.

The giant palm that was surging with strange runes was repelled by a Qilin when it descended.

The form of Qilin, which possessed the power of extreme yang, appeared behind Lu Ting, and it was filled with the might of the three ancient ancient clans!
