Chapter 2646: I’ll Help you

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Booooom~~~

the giant grey magic formation began to tremble violently upon being bombarded by the three black asteroids as though it was about to collapse.

However, it only lasted for a short while before matters began to die down again.

“What?”

The Scorpion King’s face turned pale upon looking at the unscathed grey magic formation—showing his desperation.

He had done his best by performing his most powerful technique and even swallowed the Holy Witch Mantra Magic Pill. However, he still could not break the Magic Formation in the end. The people from Crimson Stone Fort—even Jian Wushuang and his Official Army—would have no hope to escape upon his failure.

“Haha, that scared me a little! Good thing the Magic Formation isn’t broken. Otherwise, he could’ve runoff.” Li Qianji immediately laughed maniacally.

“He failed just by a tiny margin. If his offensive energy was a little stronger like 10 or 20 percent, he could’ve perhaps broken the Magic Formation. It’s too bad the Scorpion King has shown us his very limits with no possibility for his energy to further increase,” sneered Gu Ji.

“The Scorpion King and all those Crimson Stone Fort disciples can’t escape with the Magic Formation still here. They must all die!!” Bai Tu’s voice resonated arrogantly.

The Scorpion King and the surviving Crimson Stone Fort’s Heaven Ultimate Gods fell silent upon hearing his words.

Their faces had betrayed them and shown their hopelessness—the hopelessness filled their hearts such that they even lost their motivation to fend off attacks from their enemies.

However, Jian Wushuang was not excluded in their hopeless-feeling group.

Not only did Jian Wushuang not feel hopeless, but his eyes were also shining with a sharp light on the contrary.

He saw an opportunity to survive!!

“Lord Scorpion King, your strike just now had indeed shaken the Magic Formation such that I can even feel it was about to collapse and barely blocked the offense in the end. Your attack energy would’ve completely crushed the Magic Formation with a slight increase in power!!

“As for the energy...”

The sharp light within Jian Wushuang’s eyes became brighter and brighter.

He had decided in his mind.

“Stop struggling since you can’t escape anyways, Kid.”

“That’s right, just be good and let us take you. Mr. Bai Tu from the Divine Demon Sect may let you live because of your pretty remarkable talents if you pass your Interspatial Ring to us.”

“Hehe. However, death will be your end if you keep struggling.”

The three Heaven Ultimate Gods who surrounded Jian Wushuang were laughing presumptuously.

Although they could not touch Jian Wushuang at that moment, other Heaven Ultimate Gods, High-level Grand Ultimate Gods, and even Peak Grand Ultimate Gods would soon arrive without them needing to do much on their part. Jian Wushuang would surely die when that happens.

However, Jian Wushuang sneered as well right at that moment as on his body... Ring!!

A flash of golden light suddenly surged from the golden robe he was wearing which was none other than the Golden Glass Armor. The golden-colored armor covered his entire body’s surface within only a second.

Nine Sparkle Stars Armor—one of the Five Secret Skills from Seven Stars Black Sect—could raise Jian Wushuang’s overall abilities by three folds!

“Scram!”

A humongous sword essence swept violently in every direction as Jian Wushuang fiercely shouted.

The three Heaven Ultimate Gods around him were at a standstill just moments ago. However, the trio was immediately thrown backward following his abilities’ drastic increment under the terrifying crisscrossing sword shadows. Jian Wushuang’s figure moved in a flash and left the three-way behind before dashing rapidly toward the void ahead.

A 15 kilometers tall Golden God Shadow was formed behind him which also had golden armor shrouding its body. Jian Wushuang’s aura shot up to the heavens as he dashed toward the Scorpion King’s direction. Although he attracted some people’s attention, none cared too much as Jian Wushuang was only an Earth Ultimate God after all.

Even if his battle strength was comparable to a Heaven Ultimate God’s, he should not be able to affect the Scorpion King and those Grand Ultimate Gods’ battle. All of them thought so except for Jian Wushuang himself.

Jian Wushuang squinted at that moment and suddenly gave out a loud cry.

“Lord Scorpion King, bombard the Magic Formation once more. I’ll give my all to help you break it open this time!!”

His loud cry resonated everywhere, the many Heaven Ultimate Gods who were fighting intensely on the battlefield and the Official Army soldiers could all hear it loud and clear.

The Scorpion King, Gu Ji, Bai Tu, and Li Qianji—the four Grand Ultimate Gods who were fighting intensely—could naturally hear him and were all shocked.

What did they just hear?

An Earth Ultimate God dashing at them in such an epic fashion while announcing that he would help the Scorpion King to break open the Magic Formation?

The Scorpion King had tried his hands on the Magic Formation, but could not break it open even upon performing his most powerful strike under the Holy Witch Mantra Magic Pill’s effect.

What could an Earth Ultimate God come up with?

“Jian Yi...” The Scorpion King gazed at Jian Wushuang with a frown.

All the others looked in Jian Wushuang’s direction with nothing but confusion in their eyes.

However, Jian Wushuang had no time to clarify those people’s doubts as he waved his hand while he dashed forward without explaining anything. A light beam then blended into the surrounding void.

Heaven and earth suddenly started changing.

An extremely beautiful scroll painting unfolded in mid-air above the infinite cosmo.

The world within the painting looked so real with mountains, rivers, and even the Nine Continents. It was so vivid.

A grand boundless ancient aura began to expand downward from the painting world.

“What... What’s that?”

“A treasure?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Such a unique treasure, everything in the scroll painting looks so real.”

All those experts gazed at the painting world above and became momentarily lost in thought.

However, Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Thousand Treasures Grand World, Transmigration World!!”

Booooom~~~

The surrounding heaven and earth began to change.

This place was originally above the mountains. Even though it was nighttime, immense sweeping divine powers were lighting up heaven and earth from below like lamps and bonfires. However, heaven and earth descended into infinite darkness in the blink of an eye and created boundless darkness without a single glimmer of light.

Multiple Reincarnation Passages appeared in mid-air within the darkness.

The Reincarnation Passages were scattered in various corners of the world as infinite Samsara Strength also ruthlessly expanded.

It was a Transmigration World filled with Samsara Strength.

In that world, experts who studied Transmigration Law could have their battle strength increased immensely.

The Scorpion King was of course someone who had also studied the Transmigration Law!!
