Chapter 1614: Ancient God Sanctuary

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“I’ve never thought about it,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled.

To him then, the most important thing was to break through and become Real God. However, the only thing that he lacked to break through and become a Real God was a breakthrough opportunity.

Breakthrough opportunities came as they wished. It was uncertain and he didn’t know what he needed to do next.

“As you don’t have any plan, do what I said. Let’s head to Ancient God Sanctuary,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Ancient God Sanctuary?” Jian Wushuang was stunned, “Where the Ancient God resides?”

“Yes,” King of Venomous Worms nodded, “In Eternal Chaotic World, there are not only you human cultivators, but there are also other special tribes. You, humans, have Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries while the special tribes have four sanctuaries too. Among the four sanctuaries, Ancient God Sanctuary is one of them!”

“Ancient God Sanctuary, naturally honors Ancient Gods. As you have the bloodline of Ancient God and it is Royal Ancient God’s. It is a pity that you only have the bloodline but never inherit the complete Ancient God. There are many massacre tricks and secrets skill of Ancient God that you don’t know how to use, but when you arrive at Ancient God Sanctuary, you’ll be able to obtain and master these techniques or secret skill. By then, you who are a Royal Ancient God will be able to give full play to corresponding power.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows at what King of Venomous Worms said.

It was true that he was already a five-star Royal Ancient God then but when he was fighting against other people, he only triggered the power of Ancient God to increase his attack power or he would perform the Ancient God unique skill that he had learned. Besides that, Ancient God bloodline didn’t bring about much greater help to him.

It wasn’t because the Ancient God bloodline wasn’t strong enough, but because he had no idea on how to use the power of Ancient God.

Back in Firmament Territory in Green Fire World, he stayed with an Ancient God tribe for a while. However, the tribe was too weak. The strongest from the tribe was only a three or four-star Ancient God and they only possessed simple massacre tricks and secret skills. It could only be performed by a three-star Ancient God at most. Once one reached four-star, it was hard to put them to use.

Jian Wushuang was already a five-star Ancient God and he had already reached the limit of a five-star Ancient God. He was going to break through and become a six-star Ancient God soon. The previous massacre tricks and secret skills couldn’t be put to use at all.

Just then, he naturally needed to find Ancient God massacre tricks and secret skills that were suitable for him. Then, he would be able to give full play to his Royal Ancient God bloodline.

“King of Venomous Worms, do you know where Ancient God Sanctuary is?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course I do. Although it is rather far from your human Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, Sanctuary Alliance definitely has a wormhole that connects directly to the surrounding of Ancient God Sanctuary. You can ask Hall Master Yuan in Lineage of Star about it, he will tell you,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly then he took out the token to communicate with Hall Master Yuan.

“Jian Wushuang, you want to go to Ancient God Sanctuary?” Hall Master Yuan looked surprised.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said, “I have the bloodline of Ancient God and I am at a pretty high level. It’s a pity that I have no way to give full play to my bloodline. So, I have to make a trip there personally.”

“But you’re only a Universe God. The Ancient God Sanctuary is where the special tribes reside. In Eternal Chaotic World, although Sanctuary Alliance is supreme, they wouldn’t be able to get involved with the matter regarding the special tribes’ sanctuaries. Hence, if you were to run into any danger in Ancient God Sanctuary, even Sanctuary Alliance couldn’t do anything about it, Hall Master Yuan said.

“I know. But my power already reached the limit of a Universe God and there was no room for improvement anymore. I do not know how long it will take until I break through and become Real God. Hence, I can only head over there,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I see,” Hall Master Yuan understood, “As you have already decided, go ahead. However, the distance of Ancient God Sanctuary is quite far from our human Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Although Sanctuary Alliance has a wormhole that connects to the surrounding of Ancient God Sanctuary, the connection point of the wormhole is located in Sorrowful Region. If you were to depart from Thunderbolt Island, it would take at least a hundred years to get to Sorrowful Region. Plus, for the one hundred years you would only be passing by some dark void.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes as he understood the meaning behind what Hall Master Yuan had said.

He knew that his identity as an inverse cultivator had been exposed and there were many people who were keeping watch of him. Not only the enemies of Lineage of Star, but also some dark forces.

The dark forces would seize any chance to take action against him.

“Jian Wushuang, how about this? Stay for a little longer on Thunderbolt Island. Not for very long, a dozen years at most. Then, I will send a message to you and you can depart right after that,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Then, he started waiting on Thunderbolt Island.

Of course, when he waited, he wouldn’t stay idle but he went to look for some opportunities for comprehension on Thunderbolt Island. It was a pity that he couldn’t increase his power even though he found opportunities.

In the blink of an eye, thirteen years flew past.

“Jian Wushuang, you can depart to Sorrowful Region now. Remember, do not take a wormhole when you leave,” Hall Master Yuan exhorted. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang smiled. Although he was confused, he didn’t ask.

Jian Wushuang trusted Hall Master Yuan very much.

Jian Wushuang departed from Thunderbolt Island that day and he didn’t take a wormhole when he left but relied on going on foot.

Jian Wushuang had just left and the people who had been watching him immediately received the news.

Thunderbolt Island, at the peak of a lofty mountain, a grim-faced man in a black robe, Monster King, stood there. There was a chilly gleam in his eyes as a token appeared in his hand.

“Jian Wushuang has already left Thunderbolt Island…”

The message was spread at the fastest speed possible.

In the starry night in a black hole, there was a dark palace floating in the middle of a dark land.

A man in a black robe flashed and appeared in the hall. He shouted at the same time, “Jian Wushuang on the first priority must kill list already left Thunderbolt Island. He is moving towards the direction of Sorrowful Region.”

“Sorrowful Region? What is Jian Wushuang going to do there?” A hoarse voice reverberated in the hall but no one knew where the person was. “He went to Sorrowful Region alone?”

“Yes and he didn’t leave by taking the wormhole,” the man in the black robe replied politely.

“He didn’t take the wormhole? Did he intentionally bait us?” The hoarse voice paused and then commanded, “Inform the First Blood Shadow Troop to follow him immediately. Send Protector Ye together. Let him find out if there were experts of Sanctuary Alliance at the surroundings before launching an attack. If there is, immediately retreat!”
