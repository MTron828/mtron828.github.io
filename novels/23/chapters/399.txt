Chapter 400: A Summons

Iron Saber Lord was indeed generous. He had given them a lot of treasure, including about 100,000 Raw Gems.

Raw Gems were used as currency in Divine Land for trading and were very precious. Generally speaking, an ordinary Pinnacle of the Saint Realm had at most several hundred Raw Gems. A Stage Two expert, who possessed more resources, had at most several thousand Raw Gems.

Everyone present would receive more than 10,000 Raw Gems.

General Qing received 20 percent of the treasures and Raw Gems. The six commanders received 10 percent each, and the remainder was distributed to the ordinary Iron Saber Army Sergeants.

After all, those Sergeants had also contributed to the battle efforts.

Night had fallen, and after the treasures were distributed, the Iron Saber Army dispersed.

Calm returned to the Iron Saber Army after the conclusion of the Demon Heart Canyon battle.

Three days later.

Whoosh!

A beam of Flowing Light flashed across the sky and appeared in the void above the Huoyou Palace where the Iron Saber Lord lived.

A purple-haired elder with a wrinkled face appeared in the Flowing Light. As he looked at the huge Palace below him, he felt an oppressive force emanate from it. His face showed a trace of fear.

“Iron Saber Lord!”

“Iron Saber Territory has lost heavily this time. When Iron Saber Lord knows about it...” the purple-haired elder sighed softly. “He isn’t the strongest among the lords led by Drifting-blood Marquis. It’s been said that he’s good-tempered. But this time the loss is so heavy that he’ll definitely be angry.”

“I have to be careful. If the Lord is angry with me, I’m afraid I’ll be killed.”

The purple-haired elder felt slightly uneasy as he entered the Huoyou Palace.

Seeing the elder, Iron Saber Lord gave an order immediately.

“Tell the two generals, as well as all the commanders who stay in the Iron Saber Territory, to come to see me at once!”

In the barracks of the first army of the Iron Saber Army.

The first army had been in charge of guarding the Demon Heart Canyon. Although the Demon Heart Canyon cave mansion had already been compromised, the first army continued to station themselves near the Demon Heart Canyon as they had no other task.

In one of the camps, Jian Wushuang sat alone on a bed with his eyes slightly closed. He was surrounded by vast Origin Energy.

Just a moment later, the Origin Energy dispersed.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, shook his head slightly and thought, “I have comprehended the extremely high level of the World Origin and the Slaughter Origin. Nevertheless, I still can’t cultivate the Origin Mark.”

Origin Mark was the sign of a Stage Two expert.

By virtue of the Spiritual Power of Heavenly Creation Skill and excellent physical strength, Jian Wushuang was not weaker than Stage Two experts in battle strength. With various aces up his sleeve, he could even compete against Stage Three experts. His battle strength was definitely nothing to scoff at.

But his comprehension of the Origin was too weak.

There was no other way. After all, he was still too young!

Lei Dao and other people believed that Jian Wushuang was actually an old man who had retained his youthful looks. Nobody knew that Jian Wushuang was actually very young. He was only 24 years old this year.

It was already an incredible feat for someone as young as him to comprehend the Origin to such an extent.

“Swordsman!” Lei Dao called Jian Wushuang from outside the camp.

Jian Wushuang rose from the bed and left the camp. He saw General Qing, Lei Dao, and other commanders waiting outside.

“What happened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Lord Commander summoned us. Let’s set out immediately,” said General Qing.

“OK,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The commanders of the first army and General Qing headed for the Huoyou Palace.

Many from the Second Army had already arrived when General Qing and his commanders reached Huoyou Palace. Like General Qing, the Second Army general was also a Stage Three expert.

Other commanders continued to stream into the palace.

“So many people have come,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself as he sat in a corner and looked around.

More than 20 people had gathered in the Huoyou Palace, which included a dozen commanders and several others, who while not commanders, were as strong as them.

“It seems like all the Stage Two experts who stay in Iron Saber Territory are here,” thought Jian Wushuang.

“Ordinarily, Lord Commander only summons the two generals and several related commanders. He summoned so many of us this time. I guess something must be wrong, and probably because of that place...” Lei Dao whispered to Jian Wushuang, who was next to him.

“That place?” Jian Wushuang’s heart hammered, as he realized what Lei Dao was referring to.

On the majestic throne at the top of the hall sat an untidy, grim-faced, dark-haired man. That was Iron Saber Lord. A purple-robed elder stood beside him respectfully.

“I have summoned you today for one reason,” the Lord said in a loud and cold voice as he glanced at the purple-robed elder. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The purple-robed elder nodded, bowed to the generals and commanders, and raised his voice, “Your Excellencies, my name is Gu Man. Marquis Piaoxue sent me to inform you...”

“A few days ago, on the Flaming Battlefield, the expert team from the Iron Saber Territory was attacked. Losses were heavy. Five of the eight experts died!”

The purple-robed elder quietly watched the people in the hall for their reactions.

“What?”

“Five died at the same time?”

“Such a devastating loss? What enemies did they encounter?”

The entire hall fell into chaos.

Jian Wushuang was grave.

Lei Dao had told him about Flaming Battlefield. He knew that people on the Flaming Battlefield were crazy and cruel. Flaming Battlefield was a battlefield of the experts. A Stage Two expert like Lei Dao would be regarded as ordinary on the Flaming Battlefield.

Jian Wushuang had not had much of an opinion on Flaming Battlefield previously. Now, knowing that five experts of Iron Saber Territory had died there, he was quite shocked.

The five who had died must be Stage Two experts, perhaps stronger than Lei Dao.

“The Flaming Battlefield centers around the dispute between the two marquises and has a great reputation in the vast Divine Land.”

Iron Saber Lord spoke in a chilly tone.
