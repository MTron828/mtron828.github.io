Chapter 2376: Drunk in the Heart

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Xiao Heng has to admit that the woman on stage was truly attractive but to mesmerize so many practitioners and experts into going crazy over her, there must be something more to her.

“Oh don’t be hasty, just watch.” The waiter in black smiled.

After the momentary excitement, the entire Hundred Flowers Tower quieted down.

A pipa started ringing lightly as the woman in a veil started her dance on stage.

Her figure was very enchanting and her dance was so beautiful—so beautiful it made people’s hearts intoxicated.

All of her moves were unforgettable.

Every move she made was so perfect and flawless.

Everyone’s heartstrings were plucked with her every turn, nobody could divert his eyesight away from her.

Even her eyes, as if they could speak, were giving looks that could put everyone in an ecstatic state.

Hundred Flowers Tower was in dead silence.

An absolute deadly silence, except for the continuous pipa music.

Everybody had lost themselves and forgotten about everything. All that was left in their eyes and minds was the woman who was dancing like a butterfly on the high stage.

Everyone was completely intoxicated by her perfect dance moves and were unable to pull themselves together.

At Jian Wushuang’s table, other than him, Xiao Heng and the rest of the core disciples could not help but stand up. Their eyes were dead-locked to the woman on the high stage. Their eyesights were completely attracted, and their expressions were idle.

Not only them but everyone in the room.

For example, the beast-like man who had a battle axe on his back.

An honorable First-Class Divine Demon like him could not help but to completely dumbfoundedly immerse himself at the moment.

That moment went on for a very, very long time.

Finally, the pipa sounded gradually faded away and the woman on the high stage slowly stopped her movements.

As the music ended, everybody was still deeply submerged in the atmosphere, unable to snap out of it for a long time.

The woman on stage bowed slightly while her extremely pretty, absolutely seductive, and lively eyes were scanning through everyone in the room.

Anyone who had met her eyes would immediately fall into a passionate daze. Some tried to keep their demeanor, but their hearts were surging in waves.

The beast-like man, Xiao Heng, and the rest were all like that.

The woman was very satisfied. However, when her eyes scanned across Jian Wushuang...

“Hm?”

She felt slightly surprised.

She noticed that there was no passion or craze in Jian Wushuang’s eyes when he looked at her. He was not affected at all.

“This man...is interesting.”

She looked at him for a split moment before immediately retracted her attention.

She very soon turned around and went back to her room.

Only when she had completely disappeared from everyone’s sight that the Hundred Flowers Tower began to resume its usual noisiness again.

There were countless screams and shouts around the space, exclaiming the heavenly sight that they just witnessed.

The woman’s dancing was just too beautiful.

Before that kind of dance posture, nobody could resist her seduction.

“Gentlemen, what do you think?”

The waiter in black who was standing next to Jian Wushuang’s table asked with a smile.

“Now I know why so many people are crazy about Miss Xiao. The dance was truly very beautiful,” said Xiao Heng with his face clearly still mesmerized. Obviously, what he witnessed had fundamentally stunned him. There was even a trace of yearning and craze in him.

It was the kind of yearning and craze towards that woman.

Not only him but the other four core disciples as well.

Only Jian Wushuang could still keep calm after watching such a dance.

However, he had to admit that the woman’s dancing was truly attractive and flawless.

“Oh yes, where did Miss Xiao go?” asked Xiao Heng. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The waiter smiled. “Back to her own room, of course. Miss Xiao is different from regular dancers. She doesn’t usually show herself other than dancing once in a while. If you gentlemen would like to meet her, there’s only one way to do it—you’ll have to pay a small price, write a visitation request, and send it to her through our employees here in Hundred Flowers Tower. As for the content, it’s up to you what you want to write. We’ll guarantee that Miss Xiao will be the only one who’ll read it. It’s up to Miss Xiao herself whether she wants to meet you after that.”

And if Miss Xiao agreed to meet you, you can make requests such as taking off her veil and see her face or perform a private dance for you. They’re all allowed.”

“Only to see her face or ask her to dance? Is that it?” One of the core disciples frowned.

The waiter smiled. “Of course, what else is there to do? Let me remind you gentlemen that Miss Xiao is only a dancer, she only sells her art and not her body. This is the rule that nobody can break. There are countless experts in Luogu Territory who yearn to spend a night with Miss Xiao, but those are just wishful thinking as nobody could pull it off. Even if they’re top-class experts or from a huge background, they couldn’t ask for the impossible.”

Do know that Miss Xiao is the face of Hundred Flowers Tower and our ability is way above the Nine Cities’ governors. The Master of Hundred Flowers Tower is one of the few super experts that are hiding in Luogu Territory who are even stronger than those in Divine Demon Realm.”

Tell me, who would dare to push their luck here with a background such as his?”

Xiao Heng and the others understood the situation while listening to that, but at the same time felt even crazier over Miss Xiao.

Selling her art but not her body—that just made her even more attractive.

“Gentlemen, would you like to send a visitation request?” asked the waiter in black.

“Sure, of course, we will. But what’s the ‘small price’ for sending the visitation request?” asked Xiao Heng.

“It’s simple, just ten Golden Spirit Elixir,” said the waiter in black.

“What?!” Xiao Heng and his company were stunned.

Golden Spirit Elixir was an elixir pill that Divine Demon Realm experts used to upgrade their ability. It was quite an important item for them.

Xiao Heng and the other Narcissus Island core disciples could merely receive 30 Golden Spirit Elixir every year from the sect. However, it was the cost of sending a visitation request over here!

It was hard to deny that was an expensive price to pay for a visitation request.

“It’s true that it’s a high price to pay, but even so there are so many people in Qingxiao City sending visitation requests non-stop, just to see Miss Xiao’s beautiful face. However, there had only been a very few lucky ones who actually got to meet her. If you gentlemen wish to, you could give it a try.” The waiter in black smiled.
