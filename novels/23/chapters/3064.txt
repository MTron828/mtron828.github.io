“Tsk, tsk, these are the real big sects. They are so magnificent that the sects in the endless territories can’t compare to them.” Jiu Luo walked behind Deacon Wan and sighed from time to time.

Jian Wushuang also nodded secretly.

Although the Young Divine Sect was just a sect, it was actually a world in a secret realm of heaven and earth.

The interior of the sect was indeed magnificent. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Our Young Divine Sect is one of the 12 first firmament divine sects. Furthermore, the founder of our Young Divine Sect is a true master of principles. Although he has already fallen, the many things he left behind have benefited our Young Divine Sect immensely. Furthermore, our Young Divine Sect is extremely ancient. Countless years have passed since it was founded. This foundation isn’t something an ordinary sect can compare to.”

“This is your first time in the sect, so you don’t know much. When you take Elder Su as your master and truly integrate into the Young Divine Sect, you’ll know how lucky you are to be able to become a subordinate of the Young Divine Sect,” Deacon Wan said from the front.

Upon hearing this, Jiu Luo’s expectations grew.

At this moment…

“Oh? What’s going on there?” Jiu Luo suddenly looked at the void beside him.

In that empty space, there was a huge floating martial arts practice field.

At this moment, there were many people gathered on the martial arts practice field. The people gathered there all looked very young, and most of them were only False Saints or first or second level True Saints. There were even some Divine Masters…it was very obvious that they were all disciples of the Young Divine Sect.

And with so many disciples gathered together, it was obvious that something had happened.

Deacon Wan also glanced at the martial arts practice field and then smiled. “Well, it’s a coincidence that you’re here today. Bai Xiao, the number one genius of our Young Divine Sect, just came back from the Divine Ancestor Dao Field. Along with him are a few of his good friends from the Divine Ancestor Dao Field. Because it’s rare for him to come back, the Sect Master personally ordered him to have a good exchange with some core disciples of our Young Divine Sect.”

“Is that so?” Jiu Luo raised his eyebrows.

“The Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “I’ve heard of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. It’s one of the three free organizations in the Divine Beginning World. Could senior brother Bai Xiao have joined the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect?”

“Yes.” Deacon Wan nodded, at the same time, he said proudly, “Bai Xiao is the most outstanding genius disciple of our Young Divine sect. He’s even ranked at the top among all the geniuses in our sect’s history. A hundred years ago, he joined the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect and entered the Daoist Palace, which specializes in cultivating top geniuses. He was also lucky enough to be under the tutelage of an Invincible Immortal Saint from the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He knew about the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect from Xue Bei.

But he had never heard of the Dao Palace. However, from what Deacon Wan said, he understood that the Dao Palace should be the same as the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, which were used to cultivate top geniuses.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance had the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, and the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect also had a Dao Palace. As expected, the Spacetime Temple should also have a special place to cultivate geniuses.

Since Bai Xiao was able to join the Daoist Rite Temple and was able to be taken in as a disciple by an Invincible Immortal Saint, his talent was indeed not considered weak.

“Jiu Luo, you have just arrived at my Young Divine Sect, and yet you are able to see Bai Xiao. Consider yourself lucky. In a few days, Bai Xiao will return to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Rite Temple with a few of his good friends. This is a rare opportunity. Do you want to go and look for Bai Xiao as well to exchange ideas with him?”Deacon Wan suddenly asked.

“Is that possible?” Jiu Luo was clearly very excited.

“Of course.” Deacon Wan smiled.

“Alright, let’s hurry over.” Jiu Luo could not wait any longer.

The three of them immediately changed directions and quickly arrived at the floating martial arts practice field.

When they arrived at the martial arts practice field, they happened to see that handsome young man, Bai Xiao, dressed in white robes, had easily defeated a second level True Saint disciple of the Young Divine Sect. This scene also caused the surrounding people to cry out in surprise.

One had to know that Bai Xiao’s own realm was only a first level True Saint.

Additionally, it was worth mentioning that Bai Xiao was also skilled in the Dao of the sword.

“Bai Xiao.”

Deacon Wan walked forward and his voice clearly became gentler.

“Oh, Deacon Wan?” Bai Xiao glanced at Deacon Wan and smiled. “Is there something the matter?”

“It’s like this. This little fellow is called Jiu Luo. He was a disciple Elder Su took in three thousand years ago in the endless territories. Today, he just arrived at our Young Divine Sect and happened to see you conversing with the disciples of our sect. I told him not to miss this opportunity, so he came over,” Deacon Wan said.

“Elder Su’s disciple?” Bai Xiao’s expression changed. “As far as I know, Elder Su has very high standards. To be able to catch his eye and take him in as a disciple, his strength and talent must be extraordinary. Junior brother Jiu Luo, let’s spar a bit.”

“Thank you for your guidance, senior brother.” Jiu Luo was incomparably excited as he took a deep breath.

“Senior brother Bai Xiao, be careful.”

Jiu Luo finished speaking.

Boom!

A powerful aura suddenly erupted like a volcano that had been silent for hundreds of millions of years.

Jiu Luo’s figure suddenly charged forward, and the blood-colored battle saber on his back was instantly unsheathed.

Hualala!

A bewitching blood-colored blade light appeared out of thin air, directly piercing through the void. It was as if the entire world had been split apart by this blood-colored blade light.

The surrounding void also became completely dark. It was incomparably dark.

Under this endless darkness, this blood-colored blade light appeared extremely dazzling. It was even extremely intoxicating.

Seeing this blade light, many of the surrounding Heavenly God Sect disciples revealed shocked expressions.

This was because the aura and power of Jiu Luo’s blade was already comparable to the full strength attack of a rank two True Saint.

“Not bad.”

Even Bai Xiao nodded slightly, and then he took a step forward.

He took a step forward and closed the distance between him and Jiu Luo. Then, he casually swung his sword.

Clang! Clang!

Two consecutive strikes appeared extremely relaxed.

However, the first strike directly changed the direction of Jiu Luo’s blade. The second strike passed by Jiu Luo and cut off one of his arms.

“This...”

“Too powerful!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Bai Xiao only used the divine power of a rank one True Saint, but his swordsmanship is too terrifying. This Jiu Luo guy’s saber is already so terrifying, but in front of senior apprentice-brother Bai Xiao, he has no ability to resist at all.”

Exclamations immediately sounded in the surroundings.

As for Jiu Luo...as a True Saint, even if his divine body completely collapsed, he could rely on his immortal body to regenerate. Just one arm, Jiu Luo was able to instantly recover.

“Amazing!”

Jiu Luo’s gaze was also incomparably hot as he stared at Bai Xiao. “Senior brother Bai Xiao, your swordsmanship is truly amazing. Among all the first level True Saints I’ve seen, apart from the Heavenly Marquis Brothers, your swordsmanship should be the strongest!”
