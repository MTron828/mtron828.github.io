“I’ve long heard that Star Demon Ancestor is the most mysterious and resourceful emperor among the ten eternal prison lords. Today, I finally learned how to enslave his soul without making a sound. It’s indeed a good method.” Jian Wushuang stared at Star Demon Ancestor, his eyes were cold.

“Haha, I didn’t expect you to be a perfect life-level cultivator besides comprehending a trace of universe principle. If such a super genius were to be placed in the deepest part of the universe, countless superpowers would fight over him.”

Star Demon Ancestor smiled, then he said, “Blood Sword Master, believe me, even if you are a perfect life-level cultivator, your life-saving methods are not weak. Even the demonic dragon can’t do anything to you. But believe me, I have thousands of ways to kill you. So, why don’t you consider becoming my servant?”

“Humph, Star Demon Ancestor, I’m afraid you’re going to miscalculate this time.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and took out the Red Cloud disciple token.

The moment the token appeared, Star Demon Ancestor’s expression changed.

!!

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang activated the power of the Eternal Dark Prison’s formation to suppress Star Demon Ancestor.

Rumble! The world shook as the supreme power pressed down on Star Demon Ancestor’s body.

He was too close to Star Demon Ancestor. Even if Star Demon Ancestor had thousands of means, he could not escape from this suppressive power,

Star Demon Ancestor let out a muffled groan and fell to the ground, his face turning ugly.

However, it was worth mentioning that although Star Demon Ancestor was suppressed by the supreme power, his body was still standing, unlike the other Rulers who were pressed to the ground, he could not move at all.

Star Demon Ancestor was not only standing, but he could barely move. However, he could not use much of his strength.

“He can stand?” Jian Wushuang could not help being surprised.

Star Demon Ancestor was one of the ten great kings, but he was still lying on the ground under the suppression of the power. How could he stand?

Jian Wushuang understood that Star Demon Ancestor was much stronger than Demon Dragon Lord.

Of course, this had a lot to do with Jian Wushuang himself.

“Although I can use the power of the Eternal Dark Prison with the help of the disciple token of the Red Cloud Branch, I’m Only a Principles Master, so the power I can use is very limited. Most importantly, the Eternal Dark Prison’s array was severely damaged in the war that destroyed the Red Cloud branch. The foundation of the array was damaged, so the power of the Eternal Dark Prison’s array was weakened.”

“If the foundation of Eternal Darkness Prison had not been damaged, I would have been able to suppress everything in the first level, even if I was only a Principles Master. But now, although I can suppress Star Demon Ancestor, I can’t do it as thoroughly as I did with Demon Dragon Lord. At least, Star Demon Ancestor can still stand,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Of course, since he was already suppressed, Jian Wushuang did not care whether Star Demon Ancestor was standing or lying down.

“Star Demon Ancestor, do you think I need to think about it now?” Jian Wushuang stood in front of Star Demon Ancestor with a cold gaze.

However, what surprised Jian Wushuang was that the expression on Star Demon Ancestor’s face only changed a little when he took out the token of the Red Cloud Lineage. Now, Star Demon Ancestor’s expression had calmed down again, when Jian Wushuang opened his mouth to ask, Star Demon Ancestor revealed a faint smile.

“Blood Sword Master, I knew you must have entered the Eternal Dark Prison through some special means. You must have a way to leave the Eternal Dark Prison. Now it seems that it’s true. But I didn’t expect you to enter the Eternal Dark Prison through the token of the Red Cloud Lineage.” Star Demon Ancestor smiled, he was not worried about his current situation at all.

It was completely different from how Demon Dragon Lord and the Red One Ruler looked when they were being suppressed.

“The Red Cloud Lineage has long been destroyed. There’s no doubt about that. The experts of the Red Cloud Lineage should have all died by now. As for the tokens or tokens in their hands, even if the later generations obtain them, they won’t be able to recognize them as their masters, so they are naturally useless.”

“That’s why I didn’t think of you as a member of the Red Cloud Lineage. But now, it seems that although the Red Cloud Lineage has been destroyed, there’s still an inheritance left behind. You must have been lucky to get the inheritance of the Red Cloud Lineage and become a member of the Red Cloud Lineage. You got the disciple token of the Red Cloud Lineage,” Star Demon Ancestor said.

“You’re right. I did encounter the inheritance of the Red Cloud Lineage by chance and became a new disciple of the Red Cloud Lineage. I entered the Eternal Dark Prison with this token,” Jian Wushuang admitted directly, then he asked, “Star Demon Ancestor, you’re already in such a dire situation. Why aren’t you anxious?”

“It’s useless to be anxious. Besides, although I’m suppressed by you, I’m not completely suppressed. Even though I can’t escape or use most of my skills, I can still use some of the most basic skills. You’re just a Principles Master. Why don’t you try and see if you can kill me?” Star Demon Ancestor smiled.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

It was true that he could not completely suppress Star Demon Ancestor. Star Demon Ancestor could barely move, so he could not use most of his skills.

However, even if he could only use a little of his skills or some simple protective skills, he would not be too weak.

“Then I’ll try.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned. With the divine sword in his hand, he activated his divine power and slashed down with his sword.

Whoosh!

A hazy sword shadow flew out. It was Jian Wushuang’s strongest sword skill, hazy.

Star Demon Ancestor, who was suppressed by the power of the Eternal Prison Formation, had no room to dodge. He did not intend to dodge at all. With a slight movement of his finger, a huge black vortex appeared in an instant, the black vortex spun crazily and devoured everything around it like a bloody mouth.

Jian Wushuang’s obscure swordsmanship swept a large amount of hazy fog onto the black vortex, which immediately devoured it mercilessly.

It was like a drop of water falling into the sea without stirring up any wind or waves.

“This…”

Jian Wushuang was extremely astonished.

He could tell that the black vortex that had suddenly appeared was not created by Star Demon Ancestor himself, but by Star Demon Ancestor in a special way.

In other words, the black vortex must have come from a special treasure.
