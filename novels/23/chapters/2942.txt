Chapter 2943: Top False Saint

——

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Jian Wushuang attacked again and again. Each time, his swordsmanship was unbelievably fast, and the angles were extremely tricky.

Although Jin Shan was powerful, he obviously could not keep up with Jian Wushuang’s speed, so he could only take a beating passively. In just a moment, Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword had swept over his divine body twice, but he had resisted it.

“Jin Shan’s attack is not only powerful, but his body-protection ability is also very strong.” Jian Wushuang thought.

“Boy, are you tickling me? Your attack has no effect on me at all,” Jin Shan growled.

“Tickling me? Let’s try again.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and thrust the longsword in his hand forward.

The thrust was extremely swift and fierce, and a spiral passage immediately appeared in the void. The dazzling sword light burst out with astonishing power and instantly struck Jin Shan’s divine body.

There had always been a layer of faint golden energy on the surface of Jin Shan’s divine body. This faint golden energy helped him block the damage from the outside world.

However, as Jian Wushuang’s sword pierced through, the faint golden energy directly shattered with a bang.

Jian Wushuang suddenly took a step forward. This step immediately closed the distance between him and Jin Shan, and then he directly slashed out with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

The sword was so fast that Jin Shan could not withstand it.

The sword light immediately swept toward Jin Shan’s neck. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It’s useless. I’m wearing protective armor at the level of a holy treasure. You can’t hurt me with your swordsmanship,” Jin Shan shouted in a low voice.

But he had just finished his words.

The protective armor on his neck, where Jian Wushuang’s sword light swept, was suddenly cut open, and the Blood Mountain Sword entered Jin Shan’s divine body through the opening, then it flew out from the other end.

A huge head flew out.

“How is this possible?”

Jin Shan was shocked, but his vitality was completely cut off.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword was a second-grade holy treasure and extremely sharp. Although Jin Shan’s protective armor was powerful, it was only in the third grade. In front of the Blood Mountain Sword… it could not withstand the terrifying tearing force at all. A huge hole was immediately torn in the protective armor.

In the void, Jian Wushuang looked coldly at Jin Shan’s corpse and shook his head secretly.

“Weak, too weak!”

“I didn’t use any means. I didn’t use many secret skills. I killed him easily with my divine power and comprehension of sword principle.”

Jian Wushuang sighed.

He was indeed a Divine Master now, and he was only an Advanced Divine Master. He had not reached the Peak Divine Master level yet.

However, his battle strength had long surpassed that of many Immortal Saints.

If he used a secret skill, he could kill a False Saint like Jin Shan with one sword strike. Even if he did not use a secret skill, he could still kill him.

It was indeed difficult for a mere False Saint to exert any pressure on him.

After disposing of Jin Shan’s body, Jian Wushuang began to inspect Jin Shan’s interspatial ring.

Jin Shan was much stronger than the hunchbacked Elder who had been killed by Jian Wushuang. Moreover, he was a member of the highest level of Black Dragon Mountain, so he naturally had more resources and treasures in his hands. Jian Wushuang also obtained a lot of saint elixirs in Jin Shan’s interspatial ring, and a lot of saint elixirs.

“Go ahead and hopefully I’ll meet someone stronger next, or it’ll be too boring.”

Jian Wushuang murmured and continued to move forward.

…

In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed since the ten-day deadline.

In the middle of a vast canyon.

Boom!

One of the sides of the gorge burst open, and a figure sank completely into it.

The human figure struggled, but he did not have the time to walk out of the mountain wall.

Bang!

A golden fist directly smashed over, instantly shattering the human figure’s head.

Hu!

With a flash, the person who swung the fist was a tall and sturdy golden-haired middle-aged man.

This golden-haired middle-aged man’s face was covered with a golden beard, but he looked like a living golden lion.

“The second one.”

The golden-haired middle-aged man looked at the silent mountain wall and the cold corpse in front of him, but his eyes were still extremely cold.

He came from the Black Dragon Mountain. He was one of the two strongest False Saints in the Black Dragon Mountain, excluding the old ancestor who was killed.

During these seven days, all he did was to travel around and search for the experts from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance who participated in the assessment.

During these seven days, he met a total of four experts who were participating in the assessment. In the end, two of them managed to escape, while the remaining two were killed on the spot.

“Those who dared to participate in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance assessment do indeed have some strength. Furthermore, all of them are not weak in life-saving abilities. During these seven days, I met a total of four people, but in the end, I only managed to kill two people.” The golden-haired middle-aged man was clearly not satisfied.

Black Dragon Mountain’s Patriarch was killed on the spot by Yao Yu.

Black Dragon Mountain would no longer exist in the future, which filled the golden-haired middle-aged man’s heart with resentment and anger.

He naturally wanted to vent this resentment and anger by killing the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s experts who participated in the assessment.

But in the end, he only killed two people in seven days. To him, that was too little.

“In the remaining three days, I have to think of a way to kill more.” The golden-haired middle-aged man clenched his hands tightly and then flew to the side.

As the golden-haired middle-aged man flew, he released his soul power, frantically searching for the traces of the surrounding experts.

Two hours later.

“Eh?” The golden-haired middle-aged man’s expression suddenly changed. He was already far away from the Divine Lord’s aura that had appeared in the area covered by his soul.

That Divine Lord’s aura was extremely unfamiliar to him. Clearly, it was not from his Black Dragon Mountain.

Without hesitation, the golden-haired middle-aged man rushed toward the Holy Master at his fastest speed.

“He didn’t escape? Did he not notice me?”

The distance between him and the Holy Master was getting closer and closer.

In just a moment, he had appeared in front of the Holy Master.

Even though the Holy Master had seen him coming, he had no intention of escaping.

Jian Wushuang stood quietly in the void with his arms crossed. He looked at the golden-haired middle-aged man with a faint smile on his face.

“This man… has such a strong aura. He is much stronger than the hunchbacked Elder and Jin Shan whom I killed before. When all the experts of the Black Dragon Mountain gathered together, his aura was also very strong, only slightly weaker than the ancestor of the Black Dragon Mountain. It seems that he is one of the two top false saints of Black Dragon Mountain.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He knew from that list that the Black Dragon Mountain now had two top False Saints, each with a total of 50,000 points.
