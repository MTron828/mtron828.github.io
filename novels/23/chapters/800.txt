Chapter 801: The Assassination Attempt

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Damn it! Who would have guessed that Su Ming has such a lifesaving item,” Jian Wushuang swore angrily.

Seeing his fatal blow deflected by the Energy Shield emerging from Su Ming’s ring, Jian Wushuang turned pale but did not give up. When Su Ming quickly backed away, he immediately chased after.

But then Su Ming’s two guards who were in the Eternal Realm tried to stop him.

“You bastard, go to hell!”

The two guards showed off their strength as experts at Step One of the Eternal Realm.

One of them swung his saber straight at Jian Wushuang, the blade flashing like a gust of wind.

The other one clenched his hands into two fists and hurtled at Jian Wushuang with the momentum of an avalanche.

“Out of the way!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

His eyes flickered with harsh light. His Emperor Sword was swung horizontally, and when its power exploded, the sword flashed upward.

All of this was done by Jian Wushuang in an instant.

“What?”

The guard wielding the saber opened his eyes in horror as the sword shadow that Jian Wushuang made shot through the gap of his saber straight at his neck.

Swish!

The sword shadow passed inexorably around the guard’s neck, his head flying away. Besides, parts of the sword shadow’s power entered his body and shattered his Life Core.

Then the sword shadow was lifted up and turned to chop off the other guard’s arm.

The guard had no time to dodge and his arm was completely cut apart.

It took Jian Wushuang only a moment to get through the two guards.

However, as the guards’ sacrifice bought enough time for Su Ming to run away, and Jian Wushuang found that many people with a powerful aura rushed out of some of the surrounding shops and not far away a patrol of the Cercis Army also was heading to where he was.

“If I don’t go now, I won’t be able to get away.”?he assessed the situation swiftly in his mind.

He then cast a sharp glance at Su Ming before he turned and darted back toward the void.

“Humph!” A cold snort suddenly echoed through the air. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Now that you’re here, stay here!” the voice continued.

Then an old and strong figure enveloped in Purple Thunderbolts flew out of a shop and went straight after Jian Wushuang.

He radiated infinite Purple Thunderbolts, making himself look like a master of thunder.

“Master!” Su Ming called.

He was overjoyed to see the man.

“The Sect Master Lei Xin! That’s too bad!” Jian Wushuang’s face hardened.

According to the information he purchased, Lei Xin possessed the battle strength of an expert at the peak Step Five of the Eternal Realm. Jian Wushuang was not quite sure he could handle him now.

“I have to run away!”?He made a quick decision.

He immediately launched the Dragon Blood Secret Skill to burn up his Spiritual Power.

Although it was only the first move of the Dragon Blood Secret Skill, it increased his speed a tenfold, leaving the experts of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion unable to catch up with him.

Lei Xin squinted and slapped the void where Jian Wushuang was across the air.

With this stroke, a huge Purple Thunderbolt shot out at incredible speed and caught up with Jian Wushuang in a fraction of a second.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang paled at the sight of the Purple Thunderbolt.

The blow hurtling towards him was to be reckoned with, although its power was diminished by its passage through such a distance in the void.

Jian Wushuang grasped the Emperor Sword in his hand, turned suddenly and arose his power to strike the Thunderbolt with his sword.

This was the most powerful Secret Skill Jian Wushuang had created.

BANG!

Jian Wushuang gave a groan of pain, a trickle of blood came streaming out of his mouth. Fortunately, the Purple Thunderbolt had been partially blocked, and with the shock of that Purple Thunderbolt, his speed was even faster. He darted out into the street ahead of him in the blink of an eye and quickly disappeared into the crowd.

BUZZ…

In the void, many figures with a towering aura appeared. In a flash, dozens of experts poured out of this block of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. These experts were above Step Three of the Eternal Realm, among which Lei Xin was the strongest.

Surrounded by Purple Thunderbolts, Lei Xin looked down at the street where Jian Wushuang had disappeared. “He has run away!” he said with a hard look on his face.

“Master!”

“Elder Lei Xin.”

Su Ming and the guard, whose arm had been cut off by Jian Wushuang, appeared beside Lei Xin.

Su Ming still looked scared. He clearly knew that he would have died without the lifesaving item that he had received from his Master.

Lei Xin turned to Su Ming and asked, “Is that Jian Wushuang?”

“Yes,” Su Ming replied, nodding heavily, with unwillingness surging in his heart. Then he added, “He should have come to the Eternal World later than I did. Thus he has only been in this world for about 100 years. I did not expect that he had become so strong!”

“He is indeed really strong.” the guard said.

Then he recounted their fight with Jian Wushuang, “He attacked Master Su Ming all of a sudden. It was so fast that neither I nor Qian Yuan could react. Luckily, Master Su Ming had the lifesaving item. And then I joined forces with Qian Yuan to try to stop him, but as a result… ”

Remembering everything, the guard could not help but think of the scene when he fought Jian Wushuang.

Actually, their fight happened in a flash.

“It was a very frightening scene! And his swordsmanship is horrifying! In an instant, he killed Qian Yuan and cut off my arm, and that was with just one blow! Above all, he is just a Divine Realm expert! I have seen countless Divine Realm experts, but I have never seen such a terrifying expert as him!”

Lei Xin’s eyes narrowed slightly at his words.

Just now he had also attacked Jian Wushuang. He had been far away from Jian Wushuang at the time, and his attack only a casual slap, but without powerful strength, a normal expert could not have taken it. Jian Wushuang, however, confronted his attack and handled it perfectly.

“It turns out that what Lei Yan has told me is more than mere exaggerations. There’s something about that young man.” Lei Xin muttered. Then he looked at the coming 100-sergeant squad of the Cercis Army.

“Someone just tried to assassinate my disciple, didn’t you Cercis Army see that?” Lei Xin asked in a cold voice.

The sergeants had finally arrived, but they had not searched the street where Jian Wushuang had disappeared, which made Lei Xin dissatisfied.

“Yes, we did.” the captain of the squad replied, looking directly at Lei Xin.

“I sensed he had a Cercis Token, so it’s not against the rules for him to kill a person. As long as he doesn’t overdo it, we won’t stop him,” the captain explained.

“He has a Cercis Token?” Lei Xin frowned.
