Chapter 2947: Lord Long Yun

——

“There are so few people.”

Jian Wushuang looked around.

There were originally 27 Divine Masters participating in this assessment, and almost all of them were invincible Divine Masters.

However, after 10 days, only 12 of them, including Jian Wushuang, were still alive, less than half of them.

Only three of the five Immortal Saints survived, and two of them died in the same test. Of course, one of the two Immortal Saints was killed by Jian Wushuang.

“Although the Heaven-cleaving Alliance test is not very stressful for me, it is very dangerous for ordinary Invincible Divine Masters,” Jian Wushuang thought.

He could imagine it.

Although the Black Dragon Mountain Patriarch had been killed, there were still 11 Immortal Saints scattered on the land.

The Divine Masters who participated in the assessment had to find a way to kill the Divine Masters of Black Dragon Mountain and get enough points, but they had to be careful not to be targeted by the 11 Immortal Saints of Black Dragon Mountain. It was indeed very difficult.

It was remarkable that they could survive these 10 days and get enough points to complete any Divine Master.

“Take out all the identity tokens you’ve got,” the goateed Elder said.

The experts present immediately took out the 10 days’ gains. Jian Wushuang also took out some identity tokens, but he knew what to do. He only took out a small part, which was enough for him to pass the test. As for the remaining identity tokens… he put them in his interspatial ring.

As for the final result… out of the three Immortal Saints, only one of them got 50,000 points and passed the test. The remaining two had fewer points.

As for the 12 surviving Divine Masters, including Jian Wushuang, 10 of them got enough points. Only two of them were unlucky and got fewer points.

It could be seen that compared to the Immortal Saint, the probability of a Divine Master passing the assessment was higher.

“Those who pass the assessment will be ordinary members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance from today onwards. You can enjoy the treatment of ordinary members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Here are your identity tokens and costumes. Come up and take them one by one,” the goateed Elder said.

The Immortal Saint and the ten Divine Masters who had passed the assessment stepped forward one by one and took an identity token and a set of clothes from the goateed Elder.

“Well, the assessment is over. Except for you, the rest of you can leave through the spatial passage.” The goateed Elder pointed at a person.

The person being pointed at was Jian Wushuang.

The people around quickly left through the space passage, leaving Jian Wushuang alone.

Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face. He did not know why the goateed Elder wanted to leave him alone.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, there is a lord in the Heaven-slaying Alliance who wants to see you.” The goateed Elder looked at Jian Wushuang with a gentle smile.

“A lord wants to see me?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Come with me,” the goateed Elder said and then led the way.

Although Jian Wushuang felt strange, he still followed the goateed Elder.

Because the assessment had ended, the great barrier that had always existed in Black Dragon Mountain had disappeared. The goateed Elder took Jian Wushuang away from the land of Black Dragon Mountain and came to a tall tower in the surrounding void.

The goateed Elder led Jian Wushuang into the tower and soon arrived at the top floor.

There were two people waiting for him on the top floor.

When they saw Jian Wushuang come in, they immediately came up to him. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, let me introduce you. This is Lord Xue Yu, whom you have met before.” The goateed Elder pointed at the beautiful young woman.

“Lord Xue Yu.” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly to show his respect.

He had indeed seen Xue Yu before, and he had also seen her kill the Patriarch of Black Dragon Mountain with a thunderbolt. However, at that time, Xue Yu was wearing a mask, but now she was not.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are too polite. I didn’t expect you to be so powerful when we met before.” Xue Yu smiled slightly.

“This is Lord Long Yun.” The goateed Elder pointed at the purple-haired youth. “Both Lord Long Yun and Lord Xue Yu are top geniuses in the Heaven-slaying Alliance. They are real geniuses!”

“Lord Long Yun.” Jian Wushuang also bowed to Long Yun.

“Haha, I don’t dare to call myself a genius in front of you. You don’t have to call me lord. Just call me by my name.” Long Yun was very enthusiastic. At the same time, he glanced at the goateed Elder. “You can go down first. Let us talk alone.”

“Yes.” The goateed Elder nodded and immediately turned to leave.

Only Jian Wushuang, Long Yun, and Yao Yu were left in the space on the top floor of the attic.

“Brother Tianhou, take a seat.” Long Yun waved his hand. Jian Wushuang did not stand on ceremony and directly sat down beside a long table.

“To tell you the truth, I specially invited you here for one reason.” Long Yun did not beat around the bush. Instead, he directly stated his intention, “I want to invite you to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and become a member of the three palaces.”

“Join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled. “I have passed the assessment of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Am I not an ordinary member now?”

“That’s different.” Long Yun shook his head. “The Heaven-cleaving Alliance is an extremely loose Alliance with almost no restrictions. Many members of the Alliance join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance for their own interests, and so is your status as an ordinary member now, Brother Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

“And by joining, I mean truly joining the core of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and becoming a core member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!”

“Core?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “Isn’t it said that the original level above the emperor level is the core of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?”

“Haha, Brother Heavenly Sword Marquis, the so-called original level members are the core of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. This is just a rumor from the outside world. In fact, the core of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance does not distinguish between realms. It depends on their talent and strength. As long as the Heaven-cleaving Alliance believes that an Immortal Saint or even a Divine Master has great potential, he can become the core of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

“That’s why there are three palaces in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” Long Yun said.

“Three palaces? which three palaces?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Heaven-earth Palace, the Primitive Palace, and the Primal Chaos Palace,” Long Yun began to explain to Jian Wushuang.

He told Jian Wushuang about the basic situation of the three palaces, including their significance and the level of geniuses.
