Chapter 2810: Invincible Divine Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

The Invincible Divine Master had not appeared in the Pill Sun Sacred World for a long time.

But now that the Marquis of Three Yin had appeared in front of him, Jian Wushuang immediately understood that the Marquis of three Yin must have come from the outside world.

After seeing the Marquis of Three Yin’s strength, Jian Wushuang naturally became more vigilant.

Rumble.

Majestic divine power swept out from his body.

Jian Wushuang had already used all of his divine punishment, nine luminaries star armor, and seven-star secret skill.

His aura suddenly soared.

“Oh, although he’s only an Advanced Divine Master, can his strength rise to the level of a Peak Divine Master in a short time after using the secret skill?” The Marquis of three Yin looked at the change in Jian Wushuang’s divine power aura and smiled indifferently.

Then, he directly attacked.

He stretched out a hand, and his slender palm was suffused with a trace of green light.

The green light surged out, and in an instant, a cyan cyclops giant that was 300 meters tall appeared in the void in front of him. This cyclops giant was covered in cyan armor and emitted a shocking murderous aura. Most importantly, when this cyan cyclops giant appeared... Jian Wushuang also felt an extremely strong rule power from the giant.

“A giant formed entirely from divine power and raw power. This power... is amazing.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused.

“Go!” The Marquis of Three Yin pointed with one hand.

“Roar!”

The cyan cyclops giant roared toward the sky, which formed a terrifying sound wave.

The cyclops jumped up high, clenched his right hand into a fist, and fiercely rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

Before the fist arrived, the sound of the air being compressed and exploded had already made Jian Wushuang extremely solemn.

The Blood Mountain Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand. His body flashed in a strange manner, but the longsword slashed out directly from the top down.

A beautiful sword light appeared out of thin air.

The sword light had a trace of confusion and was intoxicating.

It was the seventh move of the space-time swordsmanship, Infatuation! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jian Wushuang did not use the ultimate skill, thousand squares residual light, which he had created. However, because he had created the ultimate skill, he had made a huge breakthrough in the space-time rule. Now, his comprehension of the space-time rule had reached the limit of a divine master.

With this comprehension, he once again used the intoxication move, which was much more powerful than before.

The beautiful sword light collided with the cyan cyclops fist.

Crash! The cyclops’ fist was immediately torn apart, and a large amount of cyan divine power spread wildly in all directions.

The cyclops entire arm was cut open by the sword light, but the power of the sword light had also dissipated.

“Space-time blades, break!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. In an instant, a dense number of space-time blades burst out, nearly a hundred of them!

Nearly a hundred space-time blades was the limit of a Divine Master’s ability.

Each of these space-time blades was extremely huge and carried an astonishing strangling power. In a short while, they had directly crushed the cyclops huge body.

The cyan cyclops had completely collapsed.

“Not bad, you have some tricks.”

Marquis of Three Yin stood in the void and let Jian Wushuang crush the cyan cyclops, but a faint smile appeared on his face.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened slightly. Although he had neutralized the Marquis of Three Yin’s attack, he knew clearly that the cyan cyclops was just a casual move of the Marquis of Three Yin. He had not used his full strength, let alone his full strength, he was not really serious.

But now... under Jian Wushuang’s gaze, the Marquis of Three Yin flipped his palm and a pair of scarlet claw gloves appeared in his hand.

Marquis of Three Yin put on the claw gloves. There were five sharp claws on the scarlet claw gloves, which were as long as the claws of a fierce beast. They were extremely sharp and cold.

“Sword One, I heard that you are very good at speed?” The Marquis of Three Yin stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold and he did not answer.

“It just so happens that I am also good at speed. Since we have met today, let’s compete and see who is faster.” Marquis of Three Yin sneered, but his body suddenly moved.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang only saw a series of afterimages flashing in the void in front of him.

Each flash was extremely short.

In just a few flashes, Marquis of Three Yin had already appeared in front of him, and his ice-cold sharp claws had already swung out.

Hiss!

The space seemed to be torn apart by this claw.

“So fast!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The speed that Marquis of Three Yin burst out in an instant, including the speed of his claws, was unbelievably fast. Even Jian Wushuang, who had an extremely high comprehension of the space-time rules, could not help being a little shocked.

He immediately moved to block it.

Clang!

The blood mountain sword blocked the sharp claws, and Jian Wushuang immediately retreated.

However, Marquis of Three Yin did not give up. In a flash, he could easily catch up with Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened, and a vast golden divine power immediately burst out.

Jian Wushuang directly used his realm skill.

Golden light realm, star armor realm, punishment prison, and Jian Wushuang’s sword world...

The four suppression skills burst out at the same time and instantly pressed on Marquis of Three Yin’s body.

This was the realm that Jian Wushuang had used all four realms to suppress only one person. Even Marquis of Three Yin’s body could not help but tremble when he used all his divine power.

“This domain suppression technique is indeed impressive.” Marquis of Three Yin nodded secretly, but he continued to rush forward.

Although his speed and strength were limited by the domain’s suppression, it was still very small. His speed was still astonishingly fast.

In a series of flashes, he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again, and then his two sharp claws, whoosh! Woosh! Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!

Like two streams of light, they continued to attack Jian Wushuang from all directions.

Jian Wushuang also exerted his comprehension of the space-time rules to the maximum. He completely unleashed his speed and brandished his blood mountain sword to block the attacks.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sound of metal colliding rang out continuously. In just a short while, Jian Wushuang and the Marquis of Three Yin had exchanged over a hundred head-on blows.

“He’s too fast! He’s even slightly faster than me under the suppression of my domain!” Jian Wushuang was a little shocked.

His comprehension of the space-time rules had reached the limit of a Divine Master. Logically speaking, unless his opponent’s comprehension of the rules reached the level of an Immortal Saint, no one should be able to match his speed, but in fact, Marquis of Three Yin was indeed faster than him.

“It’s a secret skill. The secret skill he used has greatly improved his speed,” Jian Wushuang thought.
