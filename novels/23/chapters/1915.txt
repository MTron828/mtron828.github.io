Chapter 1916: Three Alliances Are All Here

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Three Peak Emperor Gods teamed up and you could only match evenly with him?” The Master of Emperor Sword Sect was shocked and his expression grew unusually solemn.

Emperor God Wu Yao also appeared next to the Master of Emperor Sword Sect.

“Emperor God Wu Yao, the three of us teamed up to fight with Jian Wushuang,” the Master of Emperor Sword Sect said.

“Alright,” Emperor God Wu Yao nodded heavily.

Suddenly, the three Peak Emperor Gods instantly took action.

“Three against one again? Haha, come on then,” Jian Wushuang was fearless.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang got closer to the three Peak Emperor Gods.

The experts from Supreme Ten Alliance and Star Extermination Alliance gathered and fought with the experts from Lineage of Star fiercely.

Both parties were in a fierce fight.

In a short time, it would be unrealistic to call victory or defeat.

However, just as both parties were fighting fiercely.

Hong!

There was a terrifying explosion from afar. The entire Universe Galaxy was shaking vigorously. It was trembling in balance.

“Sh*t.”

Hall Master Yuan who was hiding in the depths of the galaxy suddenly grew solemn and he instantly sent Jian Wushuang a message about what he saw on the outside of the galaxy.

“Palace Master, Almighties Alliance is attacking too!” Hall Master Yuan sounded anxious.

“Almighties Alliance?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated.

Among the three alliances who eyed Lineage of Star, the strongest was Almighties Alliance.

However, Almighties Alliance and Lineage of Star shared no resentment. They were merely coming after the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Hence, they weren’t harboring strong murderous intentions against Lineage of Star.

Previously, Emperor God Xiu Luo visited with his consciousness embodiment and declared their terms and condition with Lineage of Star, but Lineage of Star never replied.

In actual fact, Lineage of Star had made a decision long ago. The reason why they didn’t reply was merely to steady the Almighties.

Alliance didn’t manage to hold back but started to attack at such a crucial moment.

“We are almost done with Star Extermination Alliance. In addition to Supreme Ten Alliance, Lineage of Star could deal with them. Plus, we have the support of the formation, we have at least a sixty percent chance of winning. However, if Almighties Alliance were to join in…” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

The experts from the two alliances felt the surrounding galaxy quiver.

They could guess the reason of the quiver.

“It’s Almighties Alliance. Almighties alliance took action!”

“Almighties Alliance finally couldn’t hold back anymore.”

“Lineage of Star is too powerful. Even if our two alliances team up, we might not stand an absolute chance to win. However, although Almighties Alliance doesn’t hold a grudge against Lineage go Star, they are here for the Secret Skill of Star Palace after all. To get the secret skill, they have to stand by our side!”

“Hurry up, let’s attack the formation as well to work together with Almighties Alliance so that they can enter.”

The two alliances immediately made a decision.

Very soon, the experts from both campsites attacked the galaxy formation.

“Sh*t!” Hall Master Yuan’s face was cold, “With Almighties Alliance attacking outside, there is already great pressure. Now that the experts from both alliances are attacking from the inside, the galaxy has yet to recover from major damage after all…”

“Palace Master, I can’t hold on any longer!”

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang, who was fighting with the three Peak Emperor Gods, received Hall Master Yuan’s message and his face grew solemn.

He knew that Hall Master Yuan had already done his best.

“As you can’t hold back, let the experts from Almighties Alliance come in,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Let them come in?” Hall Master Yuan stunned and there was another terrifying hit on the galaxy formation before he could react.

There was a really huge opening on the vast galaxy formation.

The experts from Almighties Alliance immediately swarmed in. With their traveling speed, they arrived at the border of the battlefield in a really short period of time.

The experts from Alimghies Alliance were also shocked when they saw the situation of the battlefield in front of them.

Especially when they saw Emperor God Tian Ling and Jian Yi fighting in one of the corners of the battlefield.

The two terrifying fighting powers swept out wantonly in the galaxy. The power that was displayed could even strike fear into a Peak Emperor God.

There was no one who dared to get close within a one hundred million mile range of the battle between the two.

“Star Extermination Alliance, Supreme Ten Alliance has already attacked and they are only evenly matched with Lineage of Star?”

“Lineage of Star is terrifyingly powerful.”

There were many experts from Almighties Alliance who were exclaiming in surprise.

Just then…

“Hall Master Yuan, send me to the experts from Almighties Alliance,” Jian Wushuang commanded.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

There was immediately a space wormhole that appeared from nowhere behind Jian Wushuang. He immediately gave up the fight with the three Peak Emperor Gods in front of him and leapt into the space wormhole.

There was a flash of light and when it reappeared, Jian Wushuang had already come before the experts from Almighties Alliance.

As the strongest alliance among all three alliances, the experts from Almighties Alliance were gloating in the galaxy but had yet to join the war.

The Almighties were looking at the figure that had suddenly substantiated in front of them.

The figure was naturally Jian Wushuang.

“Lineage of Star has so many Dao soldiers and you have fighting power that isn’t second to any alliances but you have been showing the white feather. Even when Star Extermination Alliance stood outside the galaxy to humiliate you verbally, you didn’t respond at all. Only now, you finally took action for real. Sword Emperor, you are really wise in fighting.”

Emperor God Xiu Luo from Almighties Alliance spoke with a low voice but it spread out in the universe, “This time, if we Almighties Alliance were to be any slower, I’m afraid Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance would have been wiped out at Lineage of Star’s hands, right?”

“Since Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance came to wipe out Lineage of Star, we naturally won’t hold back. If there’s an opportunity, we of course would like to wipe out the two alliances. On the contrary, Almighties Alliance shares no resentment with Lineage of Star. I wonder if everyone could consider Lineage of Star, leave and not get involved in this. When this is resolved, Lineage of Star will definitely express their heartfelt gratitude with abundant gifts,” Jian Wushuang said humbly.

“You want us to just leave?”

Palace Master Xiu Luo sneered, “Sword Emperor, I brought up the terms and conditions with you before. As long as Lineage of Star is willing to hand out the inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, we of Almighties Alliance naturally will back off and not interfere with Lineage of Star at all. As for the existence of the other two alliances, it has nothing to do with us.”

“Alright, I can promise to let all of you receive the inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, but I’d like to have all of you leave for now,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, the experts from Almighties Alliance were surprised.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
