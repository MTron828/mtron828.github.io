Chapter 679: Kill!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

What Yun Fan said shocked the experts of Cloud Sea Asgard.

After hearing his words, they all realized that Jian Wushuang’s talent was far better than Xuan Yi’s previous three personal disciples.

“Dammit, Jian Wushuang should have been our disciple. That’s Xuan Yi’s fault.” With a resentful face, Shi Qianhan clasped his hands.

Previously, during the Firmament Territory Feast, he had invited Jian Wushuang to join Cloud Sea Asgard. However, Jian Wushuang refused. At that moment, Xuan Yi’s doppelganger cut him in two and made him become a laughingstock. He had already been mad at him, but he was even angrier now that he knew Jian Wushuang had become Xuan Yi’s personal disciple.

“The Ancient Sect is already very strong,” Yun Fan continued, “we can’t let it continue to grow.”

“We also can’t let Jian Wushuang follow in his Senior Brothers’ footsteps. He is still young and not that strong yet, so we need to kill him as soon as possible!”

When they heard that, all the Elders were shocked.

It was common to assassinate the geniuses from the other Sects in the Firmament Territory.

If a Sect had some excellent geniuses, they would usually become a target and other Sects would try to kill them.

And, since Cloud Sea Asgard was the number one Sect in the Firmament Territory, they had a lot of pride.

They always looked down on these sneaky actions. Even when the geniuses from the other two magnates, the Immortal Dynasty and the Boundless Demon Sect, were a threat to them, they still never attempted to assassinate them.

But now, Great Elder Yun Fan was planning to kill Jian Wushuang, which showed how much he feared Xuan Yi and Jian Wushuang. The threat from Xuan Yi’s personal disciples was far more terrifying than the geniuses from the Immortal Dynasty and Boundless Demon Sect.

“Jian Wushuang must die. But we need to do it secretly, in a way that the Ancient Sect won’t discover. After all, it’s hard to deal with their Palace Master, Xuan Yi,” Yun Fan said solemnly.

As soon as Yun Fan’s words faded, an Elder instantly suggested, “The Eternal Zone will start soon. That will be a good opportunity. Jian Wushuang is very talented, so he will definitely enter the Eternal Zone. There will be plenty of chances for us to kill him.”

“The Eternal Zone?” Yun Fan intrigued and nodded. “I would have forgotten about that if you hadn’t mentioned it. The Eternal Zone happens every century. The next time will be in a few years. If we’re going to take part in the Eternal Zone, we need to start preparing for it as soon as possible.”

The other Elders all nodded to express their agreement.

The Eternal Zone was not only a good opportunity for the disciples, but also for the Elders in the Eternal Realm. For instance, Yun Fan received an incredible opportunity in the Eternal Zone that greatly increased his strength and allowed him to become a Great Elder.

“As for Jian Wushuang… when the Eternal Zone begins, we can look for a chance to kill him!”

At that same moment, in the Immortal Dynasty.

“Jian Wushuang has become Xuan Yi’s personal disciple?”

“The kid has condensed his Sword Heart while still in the Skyscraping Realm, that’s already incredible!”

“Hum, what kind of Monster is Xuan Yi going to train?”

“The Ancient Sect is only one of the top Sects, but since Xuan Yi has already trained three monsters, it has already surpassed the three magnates. Now he is planning to train a fourth disciple?”

“We can’t let Jian Wushuang get stronger, otherwise the Ancient Sect will be superior to us!”

The Boundless Demon Sect.

“We must kill Jian Wushuang before he becomes stronger, but we can’t let Xuan Yi find out. Otherwise, if he gets mad, no one knows what would happen.”

“Think of a way to frame Cloud Sea Asgard or the Immortal Dynasty.”

“Simply put, Jian Wushuang must die but we can’t be the ones to kill him!”

When the three magnates, Cloud Sea Asgard, the Immortal Dynasty, and the Boundless Demon Sect, found out that Jian Wushuang had become Xuan Yi’s personal disciples, they all acted calmly on the surface, but they secretly made plans.

As Xuan Yi said, the three magnates couldn’t calm down after they heard that Jian Wushuang had become his personal disciple.

However, they were scared of Xuan Yi, so none of them dared to do anything out in the open.

The Ancient Sect looked the same as always. The second day after Jian Wushuang became Xuan Yi’s personal disciple, Xuan Yi took him to Sword Mountain.

Sword Mountain was inside the Ancient Sect.

There were numerous towering mountains in the Ancient Sect and Sword Mountain was hidden among them.

It was in the center, surrounded by several towering mountains, so it didn’t stand out when compared to the others. When Jian Wushuang saw it, it seemed shorter than others and he didn’t notice anything special about it. However, when he got close, he realized this Mountain was cover by a Restriction that stretched from the bottom to the top.

“Follow me.”

Xuan Yi launched several palms at the Restriction to open it, then they continued towards Sword Mountain.

Even after they arrived at the top of Sword Mountain, Jian Wushuang still didn’t sense anything special about it. It was just like a normal mountain. However, once they entered a cave mansion, Jian Wushuang instantly sensed an incredible Sword Essence that filled the whole cave mansion.

This Sword Essence was profound and seemed to encompass everything.

“What a powerful Sword Essence! This Sword Essence includes many different aspects of Sword Principle.”

“It’s like a sea that was created by hundreds of rivers!”

Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

When he arrived at the core of the cave mansion.

“Jian Wushuang, look at those stone walls,” Xuan Yi said with a smile. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the stone walls and his expression changed abruptly.

There were lots of ‘Dao’ characters on it, but all of them looked exactly the same.

However, Jian Wushuang had condensed his Sword Heart, so he looked more closely at the Dao characters. At that point, he realized that they were all unique.

“This is…”

When Jian Wushuang looked at the ‘Dao’ character in front of him, it looked like a simple word at first, but it slowly transformed into a complete and extreme Sword Principle.
