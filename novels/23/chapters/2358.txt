Chapter 2359: Competition of Invites

“So what if he is the most powerful sword cultivator? Him being a powerful expert does not mean that he is a good teacher .” Wu Jian said coldly.

“Even so, it is still more beneficial for Jian Wushuang for him to be his teacher as compared to someone who is not even a sword cultivator.” The Commandery Governor said.

“Bai Yue, it seems like you are going to oppose me and the Water Fairy Island?” Wu Jian was enraged.

He had to recruit Jian Wushuang as his talent was unmatched.

“I do not wish to oppose you or the Water Fairy Island. However, I am the Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture. It is my role to send the talented geniuses within the Anjiu Prefecture to the clan that is the most suitable for their growth. I feel that it is much better for Jian Wushuang to go to the Great Compassion Sect and be trained under the Brahman Sword Fairy as compared to the Water Fairy Island.” the Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture, Bai Yue said.

“Bastard!” Wu Jian was enraged.

The people around looked at this scene in awe.

Initially, they had no idea the Commandery Governor was here. Now, they knew.

Bai Yue was here for Jian Wushuang as well.

And he had been contacting various clans to find one suitable for Jian Wushuang. Now, he managed to contact the Great Compassion Sect.

Bai Yue wanted Jian Wushuang to go to the Great Compassion Sect, while Wu Jian would want Jian Wushuang to return to the Water Fairy Island with him.

It was obvious that both sides wanted to recruit the extremely talented Jian Wushuang.

“Bai Yue. You are not a member of the Great Compassion Sect. If you introduce him to the Great Compassion Sect, all you will get is resources and treasures. The Water Fairy Island can give you treasures and resources of equal value. Furthermore, I will owe you a favor. How does this sound?” Wu Jian took a deep breath and said.

He had no choice.

In terms of fighting power, Bai Yue was not weaker than him.

In terms of status, Bai Yue was a Commandery Governor. He had a great relationship with many clans. He could even contact the Great Compassion Sect. The Water Fairy Island would not offend someone like this easily.

Hence, he wished Bai Yue would accept his favor.

Hearing what Wu Jian said, Bai Yue hesitated for a moment before shaking his head.” Wu Jian, I am sorry. If it was any other ordinary talented geniuses, I will definitely take your offer since you came down personally. I won’t even need the rewards. However, this little one is different. He is truly an extremely talented genius that is far beyond my imagination. If I recommend him to the Great Compassion Sect, the rewards that the Great Compassion Sect will give me will be far more than what the Water Fairy Island can.

“It will not be a wise trade if I traded such a genius for a favor from you. Of course, I can consider if it was a favor from the Island Master of the Water Fairy Island, or from the Water Fairy Island itself.”

“A favor from Lord Island Master or the Water Fairy Island itself?” Wu Jian shook his head bitterly.

Even though he was one of the higher-ups in the Water Fairy Island, he could not represent the entire Water Fairy Island.

‘No matter how much we speak about it, it is useless. In the end, we have to respect the decision of the little one on which clan he will join.” Bai Yue said as he looked over at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, are you interested in going to the Great Compassion Sect with me?”

Wu Jian also looked at Jian Wushuang solemnly, “Little one, you should have no problem entering the clans within the Wusha Barren Region and becoming a core disciple. I will not force you. However, I sincerely wish that you will return to the Water Fairy Island with me. If you do, I can promise you that we will train you and provide you with all we can.”

Bai Yue and Wu Jian looked at Jian Wushuang, awaiting his reply.

At the same time, the people present looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Great Compassion Sect and the Water Fairy Island are recruiting him at the same time. Both clans promised him with many great things. Especially the Great Compassion Sect. He will become the lineal disciple of the Brahman Sword Fairy.” Qian Yuan from the Golden Cauldron Sect exclaimed.

“How can this brat be so lucky?” Xiang Yi’s face was dark.

“It is not that he is lucky. He is qualified to receive those treatments.” Qian Yuan shook his head and said.

He fought Jian Wushuang before. He knew how incredible Jian Wushuang’s talent and potential was. He also understood what it meant for him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The people in the Lin Mansion were very excited.

This was especially the case for Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Tiefeng.

“The little one. Even the most powerful clan in the Wusha Barren Region, the Great Compassion Sect, wants to recruit him. The most powerful sword cultivator in the Wusha Barren Region will even take him in as a lineal disciple. Nephew Wushaung’s lucky...” Lin Tiefeng exclaimed.

“Wushuang is born stubborn. He looks down on most clans. I hope he will be as stubborn in the face of both the Great Compassion Sect and the Water Fairy Sect!” Zhuo Yunfeng thought to himself.

He was afraid that Jian Wushuang would reject both offers.

Everyone had their attention on Jian Wushuang. He fell silent.

He was hesitant.

He did not want to join a clan and wanted to recover his prime fighting power as quickly as possible so that he could venture out into the more vast place.

However, his talent was already known throughout the Wusha Barren Region and had many enemies, like the Golden Cauldron Sect, that threatened the safety of not him but his parents. He must think of a way to guarantee their safety even when he’s not around.

After a brief moment, Jian Wushuang looked up.

“Lords, if I were to join your clan, what must I do?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Simple. The Great Compassion Sect is the most powerful clan in the Wusha Barren Region. You must be a genius to enter this clan. What they need to do is to give it their all to become more powerful. After they become powerful, they will need to contribute to the Great Compassion Sect.” Bai Yue smiled and said.

“The Water Fairy Island is different. We have many types of disciples. There are those who are talented and those who are ordinary.”

“In the Water Fairy Island, there are two main groups of disciples. One is the core disciples, and the other is the outer disciples. The core disciples are the best among all of the disciples and the Water Fairy Island will pay much more attention to them. On the other hand, the outer disciples will have less attention but also fewer restrictions. The Water Fairy Island will not care too much about the outer disciples. Even if they are killed when they venture out, the Water Fairy Island will only take revenge if an expert pass by the culprit.”

As Bai Yue had been a Commandery Governor for a very long time, he was very knowledgeable about the structures of many clans.

He knew about the environment within both the Great Compassion Sect or the Water Fairy Island.

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“There are minimal restrictions on the outer disciples within the Water Fairy Island?”
