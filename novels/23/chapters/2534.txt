Chapter 2535: Gladiatorial Arena

“That’s pretty crazy,” exclaimed Jian Wushuang while he took in the battlefield’s sight.

“Those who dare come and gamble-fight at this arena are crazy,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and immediately recalled his past life’s younger days.

During that time, he obsessively upgraded his abilities and also went to the arena for deathmatch gamble-fights to obtain more cultivation elixir because of a woman humiliating him.

He was only a teen then and was lucky he won in the end.

He wanted to laugh as he recalled how naive he was during those days.

“Tiexin, I’ll register for the gamble-fight wait for me here,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Ok.” Xiao Tiexin nodded and seated herself.

Jian Wushuang went to the arena’s registrar with the usher’s guidance.

It was an empty field with several cultivators there other than Jian Wushuang. Most of them were waiting to go on with only a very few still lining up to register.

“That’s quite a lot of people.”

Jian Wushuang looked around at those people who were in the Divine Demon Realm with their levels ranging between Second-Class, First-Class, and Peak Divine Demons.

However, there were no Ultimate Gods there.

It was rather normal as Ultimate Gods were considered experts at Northern Darkstar. They would be placed in a rather high position regardless if they joined the Official Army or one of the continent’s clans, hence erasing the need for them to be involved in such arena gambling fights.

Even if they did, they were gambling and fighting to gain experience or like Jian Wushuang who merely wished to earn a huge amount of Primordial Stone. However, there were not many such Ultimate Gods.

Jian Wushuang queued to register and it was his turn soon.

“Leave your name in the jade slip beside, show us your divine power aura and your bets before waiting here,” spoke a black-robed old man sitting next to the desk slowly without even raising his head to look at Jian Wushuang. His only action was passing a jade slip toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the jade slip but did not do anything.

The black-robed old man impatiently instructed, “Faster, there are still many waiting behind you.”

“Well... I would like to challenge the Blood Gladiators,” said Jian Wushuang plainly.

The old man immediately raised his head as soon as he said that.

Every cultivator in the field who was waiting for their turns also turned their gazes at Jian Wushuang.

The entire place fell silent.

“What did you just say?” asked the black-robed old man.

“I would like to challenge the Blood Gladiators. Is there a problem?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh no, no. You can of course. The Blood Gladiator Challenge rules are written there. You can of course make the challenge as long as you are confident, but I would like to ask for you to show your divine power aura.” The black-robed old man’s attitude toward Jian Wushuang became more polite.

The Blood Gladiator Challenge was the most unique gamble-fight way in the Gladiatorial Arena.

This kind of gamble-fight was incredibly cruel and unfair, but with amazingly huge rewards.

In normal circumstances, those who had the galls to challenge those Blood Gladiators were mostly very competent experts at their levels who were also very confident about themselves!

The black-robed old man surely did not dare treat them like everyone else toward such experts.

Jian Wushuang shook his body under the black stone’s disguise as he projected his divine power aura outwards.

“Ultimate God?!”

Everyone around was once again shocked.

Why would an Ultimate God show up in a place for gamble-fights? Not to mention, he was challenging the incredibly merciless Blood Gladiators!

The black-robed old man inquired, “So you’re an honorable Ultimate God. May I know what’s your name and how much you would like to bet, sir?”

“My name is Jian Yi and isn’t the bet’s upper limit for the Blood Gladiator Challenge five thousand Primordial Stones? I’ll place that amount as the bet.”

Jian Wushuang took out an Interspatial Ring which contained 5,000 Primordial Stones within soon as he finished speaking.

“Five thousand Primordial Stones as the bet!” The old man was shocked.

Those surrounding people were also gasping in surprise.

5,000 Primordial Stones was a huge number even for an Ultimate God. At least, it was not something any Primary-Level Ultimate God could afford.

However, that Jian Yi wanted to place 5,000 Primordial Stones as his bet. It meant that the total Primordial Stones that he could potentially bring home from the arena would amount to 160,000 if he won all five games in the Blood Gladiator Challenge!

How large a number was 160,000 Primordial Stones?

Even a top-tier clan like the Shi clan who owned this gladiatorial arena would probably feel pain from losing such a big amount.

After taking a deep breath, the black-robed old man respectfully said, “Please wait for a little bit, sir. I’ll need to immediately inform our supervisor and we shall arrange a Blood Gladiator to be your opponent.”

“Very well.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

The black-robed old man immediately entered the gladiatorial arena’s inner layer while ignoring the others who were waiting to register.

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry and merely waited in the field quietly. The cultivators around him occasionally looked over toward him with awe and respect.

...

In a delicately built room at the gladiatorial arena’s inner layer...

“A Primary-Level Ultimate God wants to challenge a Blood Gladiator?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

An elegant lady who was wearing a snow-white fleece dress sat calmly in there as the black-robed old man stood respectfully before her.

“In a ten-year average, there isn’t even a person who would come to challenge. Moreover, those who come are usually some Divine Demons and now we have an Ultimate God? On top of that, he’s betting five thousand Primordial Stones. Looks like he’s pretty confident about himself. Interesting.” The elegant lady smiled faintly. “Oh yes, what’s his name?”

“His name is Jian Yi. I’ve checked with the clan’s intelligence department, but it seems like no one knows about this Jian Yi,” said the old man.

“If the clan’s intelligence has no information about him, that means he’s a newcomer in the Northern Darkstar Continent. An unknown expert in the continent who probably came from one of the wildernesses,” muttered the elegant lady before instructing, “Go on and make the arrangements. Simply pick two opponents for him and test him out first.”

“Aye.” The black-robed old man bowed and left immediately.

On the battlefield located in the arena’s center, one of the two fighters who were fighting had died and hence a winner had been decided.

The audience remained to be incredibly noisy even with the battle being over.

At that moment, a purple-clad middle-aged man who was the arena’s host walked into the center of the battlefield.
