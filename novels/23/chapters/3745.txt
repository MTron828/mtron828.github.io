Chapter 3746: Celestial Light Wings (Part One)

“To tell you the truth, during the past 3,000 years, I have not been searching for Supreme Treasures on the Third Continent. Instead, I have been comprehending the swordsmanship under the Sword Stone. Among the four swordsmanship of the Sword Stone, there happens to be an extremely profound protective swordsmanship. I have been comprehending it for a full 3,000 years before I was able to perfect the protective swordsmanship that I created to this extent,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Is that so?”

“No Wonder I sent you a message earlier. You said you were meditating, so you were meditating on such swordsmanship.”

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and the Temporal Temple Master also understood.

“By the way, my young friend, the most powerful Flight Type Supreme Treasure is now in your hands. You should quickly refine it and take a look,” the Temporal Temple Master said.

“Okay.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and temporarily cut off the communication with them. Then, he found a quiet place and took out the black wings.

The pitch-black wings were extremely cold to the touch.

The wings were covered with complicated and mysterious secret patterns, which even Jian Wushuang could not see through.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and then began to try to refine the black wings.

When he began to refine them, he was immediately met with a resistance.

“As expected.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and was not surprised.

It was not easy to refine a Supreme Treasure, even an ordinary Supreme Treasure. If he wanted to refine this Supreme Treasure, he had to meet the requirements of this Supreme Treasure.

And the requirements for refining the strongest Universe Supreme Treasure would be even higher.

For example, Jian Wushuang’s Netherworld Divine Sword was the strongest Universe Supreme Treasure, so the requirements were extremely harsh. Fortunately, when Jian Wushuang obtained the Netherworld Divine Sword, he had already stepped into the sword universe origin, at that time, he had already met the requirements for refining the Netherworld Divine Sword, so he could easily refine it.

However, as the strongest Flight Type Supreme Treasure, the black wings were more valuable than the Netherworld Divine Sword, so the requirements for refining it were naturally higher.

However, Jian Wushuang’s current strength was far from what he could compare with before.

“The requirements for refining the black wings seem to be related to the universe principles?”

As Jian Wushuang studied it, he soon learned the threshold for refining the black wings, which he had just met.

Soon, the black wings were successfully refined by him.

As soon as he finished refining them, he immediately got the information about the black wings.

It was the most powerful Flight Type Supreme Treasure, the Celestial Light Wings!

“Celestial Light Wings? That’s a good name,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Like ordinary flying and protective armor treasures, the Celestial Light Wings had three different levels of power. In addition, it contained two secret skills.

The first was the three levels of power. Each level was higher than the other, but the conditions to activate it were more and more difficult.

The first level of power needed to be able to clearly sense the existence of the universe principles before it could be activated.

The second level of power required one to truly comprehend a trace of the universe principles before it could be activated.

The third level of power required one to have a certain level of comprehension of the universe principles before it could be activated.

“The universe principles?”

“The conditions for activating the Celestial Light Wings are actually related to the universe principles. The higher one’s comprehension of the universe principles, the stronger the power that can be activated?” Jian Wushuang was secretly surprised, but he immediately understood.

The most powerful Universe Supreme Treasure, and it was a special Supreme Treasure such as the flight type, was indeed qualified to involve the universe origin.

Jian Wushuang now met the requirements for activating the first level of the three levels of power of the Celestial Light Wings.

The first level of power only needed to be able to clearly sense the existence of the universe principles. He had already achieved this step when the universe principles personally descended on him.

Moreover, he had already grasped a trace of the aura of the universe principles. Now, he was not only satisfied, but he had even exceeded the requirement to activate the first level of power.

However, the second level of power of the Celestial Light Wings required him to truly comprehend a trace of the universe principles, which was relatively far away for Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s test the first level of power first.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a sharp light. The black wings in his hand instantly merged with the surface of his body and then spread out behind him.

The huge black wings emitted a special mysterious wave. With a thought from Jian Wushuang, the first level of power was instantly activated.

Puff! Puff, the wings were suddenly spread.

Swish!

A stream of light instantly rushed out. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in the void 100,000 miles away.

“This, this speed...”

Jian Wushuang stopped in the void with a hint of excitement in his eyes.

“Too fast, this is too fast,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

It was too fast.

In the blink of an eye, he had traveled 100,000 miles.

After all, this was in the Red Cloud World, where the heaven and earth were greatly restricted. It was not as unbridled as in the Divine Beginning Realm. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In the blink of an eye, he had traveled 100,000 miles at such a terrifying speed that even a Superior Ruler could only be so fast.

“My speed was relatively fast before, and I was definitely not inferior to an ordinary Ruler. However, compared to the speed at which I’m using the Celestial Light Wings, it’s nothing!”

“It’s too fast. Even a Superior Ruler’s full speed might not be able to compare to mine.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

He did not know how fast a Superior Ruler was, but he could make a basic judgment. The previous Pupil Master was too fast, when he was facing Jian Wushuang, he could not escape with his life-saving secret skill.

However, when Pupil Master used his life-saving secret skill, his speed was much slower than Jian Wushuang’s.

From this, he could roughly guess.

He knew that with the most powerful Flight Type True Treasure, his speed would be greatly improved.

However, he did not expect that his speed would be improved so much.

He could have it all at once, and it was even faster than the speed of an ordinary top-tier Ruler.

Moreover, this was only the first level of the power of the Celestial Light Wings. If he had the chance to comprehend a trace of the universe principles and activate the second level of the power of the Celestial Light Wings in the future, his speed would be even faster, would it not be even faster?

“The second level of power...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with anticipation.

The threshold of the second level of power of the Celestial Light Wings was to comprehend a trace of the universe principles.

Under normal circumstances, only supreme experts were qualified to comprehend the universe principles. However, this was only under normal circumstances.

Jian Wushuang was well aware that there were many things in this world and this vast universe that could not be inferred with common sense, such as those geniuses who could not be inferred with common sense.

Those geniuses were terrifyingly talented. They could comprehend a trace of the universe principles at the Ruler level, or even better, they could grasp a trace of the universe principles at the Principles Master level. It was not impossible.
