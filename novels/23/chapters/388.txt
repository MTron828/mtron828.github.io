Chapter 389: Demon Heart Canyon

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Those sergeants are all experts at the Saint Realm?”

Jian Wushuang could not help but be shocked by the 100 sergeants in black armor.

Of the 100 Sergeants, who had reached the Saint Realm, five had achieved the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.

It was no wonder Lei Dao dare say that the Iron Saber Army could casually choose a squad of 100 experts to wipe out one of the Six Families, the Luo family.

“Swordsman, now you’re the commander of this team.” General Qing glanced at Jian Wushuang. Then he looked toward the sergeants.

“Listen,” General Qing said, “This is your commander. His name is Swordsman.”

The words caused turmoil among the sergeants.

“Swordsman?”

“He is our new commander? He looks so young!”

“Too young? He might be older than us. It’s just because he retains his youthful look. To be commanders of the Iron Saber Army, they must be super experts.”

“That’s true. The minimum requirement for a commander of the Iron Saber Army is to reach Stage Two of Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. They’re much stronger than us.”

The sergeants were whispering while observing Jian Wushuang closely.

“Swordsman, you can have a chat with your people. After you know them well, you can go to Demon Heart Canyon with me,” General Qing said.

“Demon Heart Canyon?” Jian Wushuang had a look of curiosity.

“Our army’s primary task is to protect Demon Heart Canyon.” General Qing explained.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then he walked toward his sergeants.

Watching their commander coming over, some of the sergeants shouted out.

“Commander, please take care of us!”

“Commander, we will follow you from now on...”

“Hehe, I pay my respects to you. I wonder whether you’re married.”

“Xie Zi, don’t flirt with our commander.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Most of the sergeants were bold and forthright; only a few had an indifferent character.

Jian Wushuang warmly said hello to the sergeants. During the greetings, he remembered five sergeants’ names.

They were the five experts at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm; each of them took charge of a squad of 20 members.

After half a day, Jian Wushuang knew more about his team.

“Swordsman, lead your people to Demon Heart Canyon with me.” General Qing, who had been waiting beside him, gave an order.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He immediately set off with his team.

Demon Heart Canyon, which was located on the border of the Iron Saber Territory, was a massive canyon.

After arriving at Demon Heart Canyon, Jian Wushuang immediately saw a huge campsite, full of Sergeants. Long lines of tents were present. According to the number of tents, he estimated the Sergeants at more than 1,000.

“So many people? All of them are experts of the Saint Realm?”

Jian Wushuang marveled at the number of sergeants. At this moment, he noticed another campsite on a mountain opposite to the campsite of Iron Saber Army and their sergeants all wore silver armor.

“That is...” Jian Wushuang frowned while watching the opposite campsite.

“That’s the Silver-winged Army, led by Silver Wing Lord,” General Qing said.

”?Silver Wing Lord.?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows. He also knew that the Silver-winged Territory was next to the Iron Saber Territory and that Silver Wing Lord was also a top expert of the Cloud Realm, not weaker than their lord.

“Silver-winged Army camped opposite us. They are fighting with us?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“No,” General Qing shook his head and said, “We all belong to Marquis Piaoxue, which means that we’re the same camp. If we don’t have a grudge against each other, our two armies won’t fight. They’re here because a cave mansion appeared in Demon Heart Canyon not long ago.”

“Cave mansion?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

General Qing continued, “The cave mansion was left by a Cloud Realm expert, who was even stronger than Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord. After the cave mansion emerged, the two Lords all came over and wanted to explore it, but they found the cave mansion being protected by a Formation.

“The Formation is powerful. The two lords tried their best, but could not break it, so they have to wait until the Formation disappears automatically.

“Since the cave mansion was found, the Formation has started quickly dissipating. It must break soon, so Iron Saber Lord asked our First Amy to guard here. Once it breaks, we will immediately occupy it. Maybe we can’t take it all, but at least we took the initiative.”

“Ah?” Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

The Silver-winged Army must think in the same way as the Iron Saber Army.

“Swordsman.” General Qing looked toward Jian Wushuang. “The power is respected in the vast Divine Land, as well as in the Iron Saber Army. There are many aggressive warriors in our army. You’re the commander and will face some challenges.

“You can not refuse these challenges. It’s fine if you lose to the other commanders. But don’t be defeated by ordinary sergeants, or you will be laughed at by them.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded while looking forward to it in his heart.

He was also keen to battle, especially when he met real experts.

The Iron Saber Army was full of experts.

“Lei Dao, the rest of things is up to you,” General Qing said, and then he left.

“Haha, Swordsman, let me show you around our campsite,” Lei Dao said with a smile. Then he took Jian Wushuang to the campsite.

Lots of sergeants in black armor gathered in twos and threes. Some of them were chatting; some were drinking; most of them were cultivating in the tents.

Lei Dao and Jian Wushuang attracted the attention of the sergeants

They all fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“He doesn’t wear armor, but a black robe. He is a new commander!”

“He looks too young!”

“Tut, a new commander, what about his strength?”

Jian Wushuang walked forward and could notice that their eyes sparkled with eagerness.
