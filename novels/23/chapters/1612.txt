Chapter 1613: The Monster King

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The person who had come sneered at Real God Tian Ming impolitely.

Although Real God Tian Ming was dissatisfied, he did not dare to talk back to him. Instead, he continued to head outside the Fighting Space.

After Real God Tian Ming left, only Jian Wushuang and the black-robed gloomy man remained in the Fighting Space.

“You are?” Jian Wushuang looked toward the person in front of him with doubt.

“Monster King of the Soaring Heaven King Palace!” the black-robed gloomy man said.

“Monster King?” Jian Wushuang became shocked at once.

Since he had stayed in the Thunderbolt Island for many years, he naturally knew about some experts in the Thunderbolt Island.

Hence, he had heard of the Monster King before.

The Monster King was an exceptional genius of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. At the same time, he was also recognized as the number one Void Real God in the Thunderbolt Island as well as the whole Eternal Chaotic World.

It was rumored that although he was only a Void Real God, his comprehension of the Heaven Way was at a higher level than a normal Chaotic Real God. Thus, he was definitely an exceptional genius.

Although Real God Tian Ming was someone who was extremely impressive among the Void Real Gods, he was still incomparable to the Monster King.

That was the reason Real God Tian Ming did not talk back even though the Monster King sneered at him.

“Jian Wushuang, are you interested in having a duel with me?” the Monster King stared at him, “As for the stakes of the duel, we shall bet what you have bet with Real God Tian Ming. How about it?”

“No problem,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head with a laugh, “Since twenty years’ time of training in the Fairy Palace was won from the duel, it can be considered worth it if it is used to fight with the number one Void Real God.”

“Oh?” the Monster King raised the corners of his mouth. He had not expected Jian Wushuang to agree so easily.

“Since that’s the case, let’s fight. I will let you have the first move. Please show me your full power,” the Monster King said.

Jian Wushuang did not stand on ceremony. A great amount of Reincarnation Power appeared immediately, changed into a huge grey world and headed toward the Monster King. Moreover, close to a hundred shadows appeared from Jian Wushuang’s body instantly and every shadow shuttled back and forth in the void like a ghost.

The Monster King stood at his position and allowed the grey world to attack him. However, when the grey world was about to cover him completely –

Rustle~~~

All of a sudden, a thunderbolt which could cover the whole sky started to spread all around. These purple thunderbolts contained extremely violent power and they smashed the grey world into pieces instantly. After that, they continued to spread and the whole Fighting Space turned into a purple thunderbolt pond in the blink of an eye.

As Jian Wushuang’s shadows were also within the purple thunderbolt pond, they were affected by the purple thunderbolt’s power and many of them dissipated. Even Jian Wushuang’s real body, which was on the move, was flooded with the purple thunderbolt and it experienced the baptism of the thunderbolt’s power, which caused him to feel pain.

“What frightening power the thunderbolt has! The Monster King has probably comprehended the Sacred Thunder Doctrine of the Nine Heaven God Doctrine. Moreover, his level of comprehension is very high and it definitely possesses the power to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace,” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang realized abruptly that a dagger had appeared on the Monster King’s hands at some point in time.

That was a pitch-black dagger that was as black as Chinese ink. Although it looked normal, it was actually emitting a gloomy, cold lustre.

“Jian Wushuang, your martial art motion is indeed not too bad. However, it’s a pity that your level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine is too low.”

The Monster King laughed nonchalantly. All of a sudden, his body changed and he disappeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Where is he?” Jian Wushuang released his Soul Power straight away. However, all of a sudden, his whole body was filled with fear as he realized that the Monster King had already appeared behind him. Moreover, the gloomy and cold dagger had already headed toward his body.

“This speed!” Jian Wushuang’s whole face was filled with disbelief.

It was too fast!

The Monster King’s speed was too fast. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

To be more exact, his level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine was really high.

If Jian Wushuang’s guess was not wrong, the Monster King’s comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine was at a higher level than his comprehension of the Sacred Thunder Doctrine.

For the Sacred Thunder Doctrine, the Monster King could at most clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace.

However, for the Spacetime Doctrine, he was probably already very close to the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace.

With such frightening speed, Jian Wushuang could absolutely not block the attack in time. Hence, the dagger stabbed Jian Wushuang without any obstruction.

Buzz!

Waves were created on the void.

Jian Wushuang stood at his position like before. However, the match had already ended.

“Jian Wushuang… an Inverse Cultivator. Even people from the outside world say that you are the number one genius of the Eternal Chaotic World. However, looking at it now, you are nothing more than this,” the Monster King sneered, “With your abilities, you can only defeat trash at the level of Real God Tian Ming at best. If you wish to compete with me, you are still very far away!”

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted and he was unaffected. He then said: “I had no intention of challenging you from the beginning. Since I have lost now, I just need to find an opportunity in the future to beat you.”

After laughing, Jian Wushuang was not too concerned about the duel and he headed outside the Fighting Space straight away.

As for the Monster King, as he stared at Jian Wushuang’s back, his expression turned grave, “As an exceptional genius, he is neither conceited nor rash, and he did not care about my taunting in the slightest bit. Moreover, his speed of growth is indeed frightening. He actually managed to defeat Real God Tian Ming after being in the Thunderbolt Island for only one-thousand-five-hundred years. This Jian Wushuang… is a very formidable opponent. Seems like I have to report this matter upwards to allow them to have a new assessment of Jian Wushuang so that they will get rid of such a hazard as soon as possible!”

The Monster King’s eyes were filled with some murderous intent. However, he managed to conceal his murderous intent so well that that no one realized it.

After that, the Monster King also left the Fighting Space as if nothing had happened.

…

After fighting with the Monster King, Jian Wushuang left the Fighting Space and he was moving around randomly in the Thunderbolt Island.

“The Monster King is indeed powerful,” Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

Discounting his Divine Power and Unique Skills, looking at his comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way alone, although a Void Real God like him was comprehending two Heaven Ways at the same time, both of them were actually at the level that was enough to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace.

In particular, his Spacetime Doctrine was extremely close to the fifth level.

He was indeed a monster. No wonder he was recognized as the number one among the Void Real Gods.

“Jian Wushuang, you are actually more impressive than the Monster King. After all, you are only a Universe God. A Universe God’s affinity toward the Power of Heaven Way cannot be compared to a Real God at all. Moreover, a Universe God also has its own limits. However, once you make a breakthrough to a Real God, your comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way will no longer be restricted. After you have made a breakthrough to a Real God, your level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way will definitely be greater than that of the Monster King,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“That is absolutely right. However, the fact is, I’m still incomparable to him now,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and laughed, “I wonder when I can make a breakthrough to become a Real God.”

“Jian Wushuang, since you have already attained the maximum achievement in each and every area, you are unable to improve any further. Hence, it will be useless for you to stay in the Thunderbolt Island. So, what plans do you have from now on?” the King of Venomous Worms questioned.
