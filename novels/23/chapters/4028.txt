Chapter 4029: Poison Ruler

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang had also obtained the poison from the interspatial ring that Nine Whiskers had left behind.

When Jian Wushuang had fought Nine Whiskers, Nine Whiskers had hidden the poison fog under his killing move. Jian Wushuang had not been able to resist the sudden red poison fog and had been struck by it.

The red poisonous fog was so poisonous that even Jian Wushuang’s perfect life divine body could not defend against it. Fortunately, he had abundant divine power, so he was able to survive.

After killing Nine Whiskers, Jian Wushuang found these poisonous liquids in Nine Whiskers’s interspatial ring. There were 12 jade bottles in total, and each jade bottle contained a drop of poison.

These poisonous liquids were not exactly the same, but there were three types. Jian Wushuang recognized one of the scarlet poisonous liquids. It was similar to the red poisonous fog that had eroded his divine body, but it was more intense.

!!

Nine Whiskers must have spent some money to decompose part of the red poison into a red fog and hide it in his magic weapon.

“Ballmer, look at this poison. How valuable is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Poison, especially high-level poison, is very valuable in the universe. The poison you have is obviously very high-level, so it should be very valuable. However, I can identify many kinds of treasures, but I’m not good at poison,” Ballmer said with a smile.

“Blood Sword, wait here for a moment. I’ll show this venom to another supervisor of the Nine Emperor Pavilion. He has some experience in appraising the venom.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “There are three different kinds of venom here. Take a drop each and let him appraise it.”

Ballmer immediately took the three jade bottles containing the different kinds of venom and walked out of the secret chamber.

Jian Wushuang and the other two were waiting there quietly.

Not long after, Ballmer returned to the secret chamber and came to Jian Wushuang.

“My friend Blood Sword, the identification results are out.” Ballmer looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile. “The three kinds of poison you took out are basically on the same level. It’s not surprising that the three kinds of poison were refined by the same Ultimate Poison Ruler. It’s just that there is a slight difference in the nature and the use process.”

“Poison Ruler?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. This was the first time he had heard this title.

“Ruler, the universe is vast and there are countless cultivators. Among the countless cultivators, there are naturally some special professions, such as alchemy, weapon refining, array formation, or soul attack. These are all common, but there are also some rare ones, such as Poison Rulers!” Devil Flame said, “Poison Rulers are good at using poison, and they usually adjust all kinds of poison to kill their enemies.”

“In the universe, Poison Rulers are very terrifying because the poison that they adjust is usually very terrifying. If you are not careful, even if you are obviously stronger than the other party, you may die at the hands of the Poison Ruler. A Poison Ruler who has reached the level of an Ultimate Ruler is absolutely the most terrifying among Ultimate Rulers. Even an autarch would not dare to underestimate such a Ruler.”

“So powerful?” Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked.

“Ruler was ambushed by Nine Whiskers. Fortunately, Nine Whiskers can’t really use the venom. Otherwise, even though you have a special physique, I’m afraid you won’t be able to resist the erosion of this drop of venom,” Devil Flame said solemnly.

Jian Wushuang understood.

He could see that any drop of Venom from this jade bottle was extremely terrifying. Even killing an Ultimate Ruler with this drop of venom would be very easy, let alone him.

However, although the poison had the ability to kill an Ultimate Ruler, ordinary people could not use it at all.

Nine Whiskers, for example, could not use the poison completely. He had spent a long time to dilute the red poisonous fog that had ambushed Jian Wushuang, it only took one percent of the entire drop of poison.

Even so, the red poisonous fog still caused Jian Wushuang great trouble.

One could imagine how terrifying a complete drop of venom was.

Most importantly, the venom could only be stored in a special material and could not exist in the void for long. Even if he wanted to smear the venom on his weapon to kill the enemy, the level of the venom was too high, ordinary Supreme Treasures and magic weapons would be corroded and destroyed upon contact with the venom. They would not even have a chance to attack.

Even if it was a principle-type supreme treasure, an ordinary low-grade principle-type supreme treasure, if it was smeared with a drop of the venom, the low-grade principle-type supreme treasure would suffer great damage and might even collapse over time.

Because of this, Nine Whiskers was unable to smear a complete drop of venom on his long spear to attack.

“The spear in Nine Whiskers’s hand is only a low-grade principle treasure, but my Wuqi Divine Sword is an upper-grade principle treasure. If I apply a complete drop of poison to it, it should be able to withstand it, right?” Jian Wushuang could not help thinking. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After all, this was a poison concocted by an Ultimate Ruler-level Poison Ruler. One drop of this poison could kill an Ultimate Ruler. If it could be applied to a weapon and used as an attack…as long as the weapon touched the other party’s divine body, the venom would immediately seep into it. Then, even an Ultimate Ruler-level would have a hard time surviving.

This meant that if he was lucky, he would have the opportunity to kill an Ultimate Ruler-level with this venom!

Of course, this was just a thought. He did not really intend to do it.

After all, he did not have much confidence that the Wuqi Divine Sword would be able to withstand a single drop of the venom. If it could not withstand it and caused the Wuqi Divine Sword to be damaged, then he would suffer a great loss.

Unless he was in a real crisis and had no other choice, he would not make such a choice.

“Blood Sword, your poison is indeed very precious. If you want to sell it, the Nine Emperor Pavilion can collect one drop of it for 1,000 universe origin stones,” said Ballmer.

“One drop of 1,000 universe origin stones?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“So precious?” Leng Rushuang and Devil Flame were also shocked.

One drop of poison for 1,000 universe origin stones.

He had taken out 12 jade bottles and 12 drops of poison, which meant that if he sold all the poison, it would be 12,000 universe origin stones.

Previously, he was worried about the value of the treasures needed to cultivate the fourth level of the supreme imperishable body, but in the blink of an eye, he knew that he had such a great wealth.

12,000 origin stones. Even if he used up 8,000, he still had 4,000 origin stones left.
