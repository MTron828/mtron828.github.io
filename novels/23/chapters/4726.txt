4727 Uncle Yu

For a moment, only Prince Jiu’s anger and the Young Emperor’s left and right slaps were left outside the hall.

More than 200 Elders in the Heavenly Court shook their heads and sighed at the sight. This was not the first time the Young Emperor had been so domineering. There had been a total of five banquets, and he had fought three times.

However, even though the Emperor had some complaints about this, he never stopped it. He did not even punish or teach it a lesson.

This also caused the banquet participants to be angry but not dare to speak out, afraid that the Young Emperor would be unhappy and stab them for no reason.

With Chen Qing as his ‘accomplice’, the Young Emperor slapped Prince Jiu without restraint. Prince Jiu could only endure the humiliation. As for the Yan Immortals he brought, although they were tempted, they did not dare to stop him.

At this moment, a loud shout rang out.

“Prince Yan, don’t treat the Heavenly Court as your Six Heavens Realm. Is the Heavenly Court a place where you can do whatever you want?!”

A man dressed in a plain court dress stepped into the green jade hall. His handsome brows were filled with coldness.

The Young Emperor raised his head slowly when he heard that. He looked at him with his dark eyes, then let go of Prince Jiu who was under him, and walked toward him slowly.

“What are you doing?” The rather valiant young man unconsciously took half a step back, his eyes revealing vigilance.

The response he got was a strong and heavy slap.

The young man seemed to have expected this. He dodged the attack with a slight tilt of his neck, but then he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen.

The Young Emperor kneed him in the stomach at an incredible speed, forcing him to lose his ability to resist. At the same time, he slapped him with his palm.

Prince Jiu stood up in a sorry state. He covered his bruised face and glared at the Young Emperor, who was still abusing him. Then, he raised his palm, which was surging with violent force.

“Second Young Master, you’ve already done sneak attacks many times. This time, let’s stop.”

Chen Qing’s mocking voice rang out. At the same time, an even thinner Yan power blocked in front of Prince Jue.

Prince Jiu’s eyes turned cold. A murderous intent flashed across his eyes as he looked at Chen Qing. “Chen Qing, what’s the meaning of this?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Nothing much. The Heavens are watching what we do. Oh right, I almost forgot. Second Young Master, you’re already in the Heavens,” Cheng Qing crossed his arms behind his head and said leisurely.

The killing intent in his eyes grew stronger and stronger uncontrollably, but Prince Jiu only snorted coldly. With a flick of his sleeve, he retreated to the side and closed his eyes to recuperate.

“Brother Jian,” Chen Qing leaned toward Jian Wushuang and said mysteriously, “Guess who the Young Emperor is fighting?”

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Another one of his brothers again?”

Cheng Qing nodded, “Third brother, Prince Yu.”

He could not help but laugh. “Don’t tell me he’s going to beat up all of his brothers?”

“I can’t say for sure,” Cheng Qing shrugged. “But I think the Emperor will probably arrive when the fourth one is beaten up.”

The valiant young man, Prince Yu, took dozens of slaps from the Young Emperor before he let out an angry roar and smashed his palm at the Young Emperor’s face with a strong force.

However, the space seemed to stagnate for a moment. The Young Emperor turned his head slightly and walked over. Then he took half a step back and kicked Prince Yu away.

There was an uproar. The companion that Prince Yu brought could not help but step forward and say in a low voice, “Eldest Young Master, you are the Crown Prince. Why do you want to embarrass Second Young Master and Third Young Master in the Heavenly Court? Are you really so arrogant because of the Emperor?”

The Young Emperor glanced at him coldly, and a True Sword surrounded by Immortal Qi quietly appeared in his hand.

Seeing this, the purple-robed Da Ban took a step back and gritted his teeth. “The Heavenly Court must not be stained with blood!”

Just at this moment, four figures in white court clothes walked into the green jade hall.

However, after seeing this scene, the four figures took half a step back in tacit understanding and looked at the Young Emperor vigilantly.

“All of you, come over.” The Young Emperor withdrew his real sword and waved at them.

“Yes,” one of the young men replied. “Big Brother, how have you been?”

The atmosphere was heavy, and all the Yan Immortals were looking at the square where a fight was about to happen.

The Young Emperor sneered and took out a soft sword from his waist without a trace.

The five people’s expressions changed slightly. Among them, a thin young man stepped forward and said, “Big Brother, stop. Don’t make Imperial Father unhappy again.”

The Young Emperor acted as if he did not hear her and walked forward step by step with his sword in hand. Killing intent was revealed in his eyes without any concealment.

Cheng Qing’s expression changed slightly, “Brother Jian, the Young Emperor seems to have the intention to kill. Come with me to stop him.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. If the magnificent Heavenly Court was really stained with blood, the Emperor who had yet to show himself would definitely not forgive the Young Emperor.

The face of Prince Jiu, who was covering his cheek, was filled with joy. The expression in his eyes was as if he could not wait for them to start a fight on the spot.

A total of five majestic forces filled the square in the green jade hall.

All the Princes in court attire were prepared for battle.

The Young Emperor did not seem to be worried at all. He held the soft sword in his hand and moved forward firmly as if he had entered a no-man’s land.

Just as Jian Wushuang and Chen Qing were about to stop them, a brilliant seven-colored charm appeared in the sky.

The entire sky, which was filled with flowing clouds, changed at this moment.

Jian Wushuang seemed to have realized something and looked over.

A black-robed figure was formed from the clouds. He stepped on the colorful clouds and descended from the sky. It was as if the rules of the great path were flowing around him.

“Is that Emperor Zhen Wuyang?” Jian Wushuang murmured in his heart. He was shocked by his momentum.

With a casual palm strike, he directly suppressed the battle between the Young Emperor and the others, and Yan power dissipated.

Even Jian Wushuang could clearly feel that the Yan power in his body had been suppressed.

The man in the black robe stood in the middle of the square like a statue.

The five people’s expressions all changed. Then, they cupped their hands at the same time and said, “Greetings, Uncle Yu.”

The Young Emperor did not speak. He put the soft sword on his waist and said, “Uncle Yu.”

The black robe fluttered slightly, and a pair of turbid eyes slowly swept around. Finally, the man looked at the Young Emperor. “Young Emperor, don’t be angry anymore. The Emperor will be here soon.”

As soon as he finished speaking, another voice that seemed to shake the world and carried supreme might resounded. “Are you killing your own family?”

When all the Yan Immortals gathered in the heaven court heard this voice, they all cupped their hands and said solemnly, “Greetings, Emperor.”

The hazy seven-colored sky split into two sides, and a majestic figure wearing the Emperor’s robe of mountains and rivers emerged.

There were 99 figures behind him.
