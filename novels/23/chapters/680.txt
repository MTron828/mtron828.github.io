Chapter 681: Univeral Dao Scripture

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Univeral Dao Scripture?”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

This golden scroll recorded a Secret Skill called the Univeral Dao Scripture.

This Secret Skill described the method for cultivating, but it didn’t explain what it actually did.

“You must be patient and cultivate it. Later on, you will understand how useful it is,” Xuan Yi answered with a hint of mystery.

Although Jian Wushuang was confused, he still nodded.

He didn’t know how useful this Secret Skill would be, but it was obvious by looking at the cultivation method that it wouldn’t harm him.

Moreover, he wasn’t worried about it because it was given to him by his master.

“In addition to these three, I know you’ve also cultivated the Immortality Secret Skill,” Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang, “Usually, it’s better to cultivate while using Natural Treasures that improve your physical strength, so I’ve acquired some for you. They are all in this Interspatial Ring.”

Xuan Yi handed the Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was surprised and happy when he saw it.

There were four techniques in the Immortality Secret Skill, the Bone Fusion Technique, Blood Condensation Technique, Armor Technique, and Divine Body Technique.

When he was in the Ancient World, he had already finished cultivating the Bone Fusion Technique. However, he hadn’t started on the Blood Condensation Technique because he lacked Natural Treasures. Now, he would be able to start cultivating it and even try to reach the advanced level.

As his physical body grew stronger, his strength would also skyrocket.

“I’ve done what I can. Now, everything else will depend on you,” Xuan Yi said.

“Thank you, Master,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

Xuan Yi waved and left while Jian Wushuang stayed in the cave mansion.

As he looked at the 72 Dao Characters on the stone wall, a spark flashed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Master has obtained all these resources for me, but how much I can improve depends on myself.”

“I need to work hard!”

He immediately sat down with his legs cross, then his figure vibrated and instantly separated into his two Original Bodies.

“Sword Principle, sword…”

His two Original Bodies started to meditate.

Since these two Original Bodies both had their own consciousness, they were able to meditate on different Dao characters which sped up the process. Moreover, he had good talent in Sword Principle and the Dao characters had been simplified, so it was much easier for him to meditate on them.

As time flew by, his comprehension of Sword Principle continued improving.

While meditating on Sword Principle, he was also working on the World Dao, the Slaughter Dao, and the other three Secret Skills that Xuan Yi gave to him.

Among these three Secret Skills, the Boundless Heaven Sword Art required a higher level of comprehension in Sword Principle. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As for the Dragon Blood Secret Skill, he only needed to know the method for burning his Spiritual Power, the rest would be easy. There were two levels for this skill. For the first level, Spiritual Power was burned slowly and his speed could increase to ten times his normal speed. However, for the second level, Spiritual Power was burned at an incredible rate, so even a Divine Realm expert would only last about ten breaths before their Spiritual Power was completely exhausted.

However, while he was burning his Spiritual Power, his speed would be hundreds of times faster than usual, so it was the perfect skill for escaping.

As for the Univeral Dao Scripture.

This was a unique Secret Skill.

Jian Wushuang spent a long time studying it before he finally started to cultivate it.

However, he didn’t notice any difference after completing the cultivation.

Perhaps it was like Xuan Yi said, he would have to wait to understand its benefits.

Jian Wushuang focused his attention and meditate at Sword Mountain, totally ignored the passage of time.

From spring to winter, time flew by. Without him realizing it, six years had passed.

…

At the Ancient Sect, inside the Dao Palace, many disciples had gathered together and were participating in small talk.

“Did you hear? Three days ago, Feng, the personal disciple of Palace Master Destruction, broke through and became a Divine Realm expert. And, since his comprehension of Dao is very high, he has already become an advanced Divine Realm expert. In the future, if he cultivates even more Secret Skills, he is almost guaranteed to become a superior Divine Realm expert.”

“Superior Divine Realm expert, that’s the same level as the Vice Palace Master Level of the Dao Palace!”

“Yes, Feng really has good talent.”

Lots of disciples were impressed by the news.

After considering their levels of Dao comprehension, weapon cultivation, original Secret Skills, and some other means, Divine Realm experts had been divided into four levels, novice, intermediate, advanced, and superior.

However, there was a huge gap between each level. Even ten novice Divine Realm experts working together to fight an intermediate Divine Realm expert would be overpowered.

But, even novice Divine Realm experts could have big differences in strength between each other.

An advanced Divine Realm expert was already counted as a high-level expert.

As for superior Divine Realm experts… In the Ancient Sect, there were numerous Divine Realm experts. The Divine Palace had hundreds of novice, intermediate, and advanced Divine Realm experts, but only a few superior Divine Realm experts.

Usually, a superior Divine Realm expert could be a Vice Palace Master of the Dao Palace.

Feng had been in the Ancient Sect for no more than ten years, but he had already broken through and become an advanced Divine Realm expert. That was really amazing because most of the disciples would only be novice Divine Realm experts when they broke through, a few of them could even reach intermediate Divine Realm in battle strength, but only a couple would possess battle strength at the advanced Divine Realm level.

“Feng has broken through and become a Divine Realm expert, but what about Jian Wushuang? They came to the Ancient Sect at the same time and his talent is better than Feng’s, so he should have reached an even more amazing level!” a disciple suddenly said.

“Jian Wushuang? I don’t know.”

“I heard he has been cultivating at Sword Mountain for several years. It’s very seldom that he comes back to Enlightenment Mountain and he hasn’t challenged anyone, so no one knows how strong he is. However, he has definitely improved a lot. Even if he still can’t break through to the Divine Realm, he will not be weaker than Feng.”

“Yes. After only being in the Ancient Sect for two years, he could already pass the 30th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road. Now, he is the personal disciple of Palace Master Xuan Yi, so he should have made some extremely significant improvements.”
