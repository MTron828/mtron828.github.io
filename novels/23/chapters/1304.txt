Chapter 1305: Life and Death!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Rumble!

There was suddenly a rumble in the middle of the training field. It was like lightning but two figures tumbled from the twisted space.

Soon, both figures stood steady on their feet.

That very moment, the two figures… The luxurious, long robe that Universe God Qing Yang was wearing was torn. His hair was messy and his aura was much weaker than before. He looked as though he was in a bind.

While Jian Wushuang was covered in scarlet armor. His face was only exposed when he stood straight. However, he looked a little pale then too. There was also blood at the corner of his lips but the intention to fight became extremely vigorous!

The spectators saw the scene and gulped a breath of cold air.

They could tell how ferocious the fight was.

From the result, it seemed that the two of them were equally capable.

“Jian Wushuang could fight Qing Yang to this point?”

People from Holy Prefecture, including Universe God Jiu Hai and the few experts from Holy Prefecture, creased their eyebrows.

They knew clearly that Universe God Qing Yang possessed terrifying power and he was definitely unmatched among the Universe Gods in the First Heaven in Dayu World. However, they never expected that Jian Wushuang, who was just a Universe Master, could push Universe God Qing Yang to that state!

They originally thought Jian Wushuang would no doubt die in the battle.

Many of the others thought so too.

But now, no one dared to say so anymore.

Whether or not Universe God Qing Yang would win the battle had already became questionable, let alone whether if Universe Qing Yang could kill Jian Wushuang.

In the middle of the training field, Jian Wushuang looked at his opponent with his shining eyes.

“Universe God Qing Yang, your strongest power is just this?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

He was looking forward to the battle.

Even though the power that Universe God Qing Yang displayed was very ferocious and it was far stronger than when he was fighting against Chu Xiao and the others, he still fought a close match.

The power that Universe God Qing Yang displayed had yet to force him to his extreme!

“With such power, it’s insufficient!”

“Universe God Qing Yang, you should have a stronger power. Show me!” Jian Wushuang roared.

In the heated battle earlier, he could tell that Universe God Qing Yang was still holding onto his last card.

Universe God Qing Yang, who calmed down in the void, lifted his head and fixed his gaze at Jian Wushuang. There was rage in his eyes, “If I’m right, you should still have a stronger force that you have yet to reveal!”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded and admitted directly.

“If so, we shall decide the victory or defeat with our next stroke. At the same time, it shall decide whether we will be meeting our life or death!” Universe God Qing Yang said coldly.

“Let’s do it,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were beaming in excitement.

A simple exchange of words between the two stirred the emotions among the spectators.

“The two of them are finally going to decide winning and losing!”

“Not only that, it is going to be life and death too. I wonder who will be the last one standing.”

“The both of them have already displayed such terrifying power. What other measures have they yet to reveal?”

Countless exclamations were heard.

Before, there had definitely been no one who expected Jian Wushuang to win, thinking that he would definitely lose and no doubt, die.

However, the pitched battle continued till then and no one dared to make such assumptions anymore. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“More measures?”

The Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang in the void squinted their eyes and focused.

In the middle of the training field.

“Jian Wushuang, my next move was created after I accumulated a thousand years of training and followed by forty years of seclusion cultivation. It’s name is Ninth Heaven Crimson Moon!” Universe God Qing Yang said coldly.

“Ninth Heaven Crimson Moon?” Jian Wushuang nodded in silence and then gripped the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand as he said, “The next particular stroke was created in the past one year through digestion of accumulated experience from resolving the chess game. It’s name is Eternal Light!”

“Hehe, let’s see if it’s my Ninth Heaven Crimson Moon or your Eternal Light that is stronger!” Universe God Qing Yang smirked and took a huge stride forward.

As everyone held their breath and watched, Universe God Qing Yang took action.

He swung the black sickle with both his hands and a vast, surging divine power poured into the sickle.

The originally pitch black sickle suddenly turned crimson. Buzz. A cloud of bloody mist filled the air.

There had clearly been no deaths in the training field before, and when the bloody mist filled the air, there was a terrifying stench that spread across. That smell was so pungent that it made one sick.

In the middle of the bloody mist, Universe God Qing Yang’s eyes became blood-shot red too, while his face was distorted. The black sickle that reached the limit of accumulation suddenly slashed.

Wow!

A radiant red sword light suddenly slashed.

The sword light was so swift that it tore the sky and formed a strange arc, just like the moon hanging above the Ninth Heaven at night.

But the moon was a crimson moon!

The bloody mist soared up into the sky. The crimson moon hung in the sky with a boundless murderous intention!

That was the strongest stroke created by Universe God Qing Yang who was the number one genius in Dayu World after thousand years of accumulation and forty years of cultivation in seclusion, Ninth Heaven Crimson Moon!

Just as the crimson moon swept down, the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang, who was in the void watching from afar. looked shocked.

“That… That is one of the strongest Unique Skills?” The Master of Dayu Palace spoke first.

“It was really the strongest unique skill. Even though it was only a rank one Strongest Unique Skill… he’s considerably good to have been able to create that,” Wu Cang nodded faintly.

In Eternal Chaotic World, the unique skills of a Universe God was categorized into three ranks, and every rank would have three levels: beginner, advanced and peak.

Using the rank one unique skill as an example, most of the Peak Universe Gods in the First Heaven created peak rank one unique skills, but they could only create unique skill of that level.

However, there were some exceptions. A real genius with a higher level of comprehension could try to create the rank one Strongest Unique Skill.

But to create the Strongest Unique Skill, the threshold was extremely high. Not only does one has to have a high level of comprehension and luck, but he also has to be of Dao Master level and at least created Strongest Sword Principle. But how many could among Dao Masters who could create Strongest Sword Principle?

That’s why it was rare to see a Strongest Unique Skill.

The stroke that Universe God Qing Yang slashed was obviously a rank one Strongest Unique Skill!

After Universe God Qing Yang slashed, Jian Wushuang who stood quietly in the void suddenly gave out an unprecedented light. He quickly grabbed the Blood Mountain Sword and swung fiercely.

Swoosh!

The sword moved and the sword light flashed.

It moved the universe that instant and a terrifying power erupted.

A brilliant light that people were intoxicated by lit up the sky.

At the moment when the light lit up, the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang’s eyes contracted again.

“This stroke… Is also a rank one Strongest Unique Skill!!!”

…
