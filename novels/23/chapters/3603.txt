Chapter 3606: Indirect Help

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled.

Only now did he fully understand the reason for the true destruction of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect.

Indeed, the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was destroyed because of Xuan Yi.

It was Xuan Yi who made the Devil Cloud Star Master feel a great threat and wanted to kill him. The Seven Star Mysterious Sect was also wiped out by the Devil Cloud Star Master because they tried their best to protect it.

“There was nothing we could do. At that time, the foundation of the Divine Beginning Realm was too thin. In front of the Devil Cloud Star Master’s peerless strength, there was no room for struggle at all. Thus, when the Devil Cloud Star Master gave the order, the four great divine races and the eight directions celestial sect immediately responded. Although these sects and factions didn’t know the secret of the Devil Cloud Star Master, the difference in strength was too great. They could only form a battle team like this.”

“When that battle really broke out, our Seven Star Mysterious Sect had already predicted the final outcome. That’s why when we noticed the movements of the Devil Cloud Star Master, we immediately left behind many backup plans!” Daoist Xuan Shen slowly explained.

“First, the three great freedom alliances did not participate in this battle. After all, everyone in the Divine Beginning Realm knows that Xuan Yi is a member of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. The Seven Star Mysterious Sect will not be able to escape this disaster, and it is unavoidable. However, the three great freedom alliances can only not participate in this battle and not stand on the Seven Star Mysterious Sect’s side. Then, the Devil Cloud Star Master should not attack the three great freedom alliances!”

“Secondly, Xuan Yi immediately prepared a plan to rise up in the future. This plan was very crazy. At that time, everyone thought that it was almost impossible to succeed. However, because Devil Cloud Star acted too suddenly and completely sealed off the entire Divine Beginning Realm, Xuan Yi was no longer able to escape. Although the chances of success of this plan were very slim, it was still a glimmer of hope.”

“Fortunately, he made the right bet. Countless cultivators in the Seven Star Divine Realm sacrificed their lives to set up the formation for him.” Daoist Xuan Shen laughed.

“Formation? Palace Master, are you talking about the formation that has been sealing the Seven Star Divine Realm?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

After the battle, the Seven Star Divine Realm was completely sealed by the formation. In his previous life, Jian Wushuang was born in the Sealed Divine Realm, where he met the consciousness left behind by his master, Xuan Yi, after obtaining a great opportunity, his master finally acted and reincarnated into the Divine Beginning Realm.

Although he had been in the Divine Beginning Realm for a long time, deep in his heart, the sealed heaven and earth, the Seven Star Divine Realm, or the eternal chaotic world, was his real home! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Apart from the formation, what other formation is there?” Daoist Xuan Shen smiled. “That Grand Formation was something I acquired by chance from the cosmic battlefield. It was of an extremely high level, and it was executed by several of us Rulers at the same time. In addition, countless cultivators in the Seven Star Divine Realm sacrificed their lives to create this blood essence power, which was why it was set up!”

“Once this formation was set up, even planet Devil Cloud Star Master wouldn’t be able to break it open. After all, although his power is monstrous, and the heavenly Daos of the Divine Beginning Realm have always been within his control, the unseen laws of the universe have caused his true body to be restricted by his power in the Divine Beginning Realm. He wouldn’t be able to unleash his full power, and he wouldn’t be able to break open this grand formation at all. This left us with hope of rising to power.”

“You know what happened next. Even though your master, Xuan Yi, died, the consciousness he left behind in the sealed Seven Star Divine Realm spent countless years and effort to perfect the technique again and again. Finally, you were born!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

He knew that his master had sacrificed too much for him to obtain the perfect chaotic creature.

He had nurtured the green fire world with his own blood essence and tried step by step. Finally, he appeared. Although he succeeded in inheriting his master’s perfect life in the end, he had put in a lot of effort in the process, however, it was mainly because his master had prepared too much for him.

“After you were born, everything went according to plan. He borrowed the opportunity of the three great Saint Realm Masters to barely open the sealed heaven and earth and sent you into reincarnation to the Divine Beginning Realm. In fact, the reason why the three great Saint Realm Masters were able to open the passage was because we helped them in the dark.

“As soon as you were born, I came to pick you up. As for the rest of your growth, it was all done by you, step by step, until today.”

At this point, Daoist Xuan Shen stopped and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Temporal Temple Master and Heaven Ancestor also stared at Jian Wushuang.

There was a trace of joy in their eyes.

Jian Wushuang did not know that from the moment he was born in the Divine Beginning Realm, his every move and his growth had been seen by the three of them. They had been watching Jian Wushuang and his growth, however, other than the appearance of Daoist Xuan Shen, the Temporal Temple Master and the Heaven Ancestor had been in the dark. Even if they had helped him along the way, they had never told him the specific reason.

It was not until now that the three of them appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and told him everything, that Jian Wushuang finally understood.

“Now I finally understand why the temple master treated me so well before,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Temporal Temple Master...when he was in the Temporal Temple, he personally taught him for 300 years and gave him a life-saving token. On Saha Island, Temporal Temple Master came to his rescue personally, at that time, Temporal Temple Master was so good to him that many people were puzzled. Jian Wushuang himself was the same.

Temporal Temple Master was the same, so was the Heaven Ancestor, and so was the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, who had never shown his face.

After all, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master was the first to give Jian Wushuang an opportunity. He had never entered the core level of the heaven-cleaving union, but the heaven-cleaving union made an exception and allowed him to enter the Heaven-cleaving Secret Realm, it was something that countless genius disciples of the heaven-cleaving union yearned for.

Not only that, but the three Palace Masters of the heaven-cleaving union had also given him a lot of benefits, such as the token of the two Palace Masters and the token containing his doppelganger that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master had personally refined.

Even the most outstanding and potential geniuses in the heaven-cleaving union would not receive such treatment.

However, Jian Wushuang, an outsider, did!

There was also the Heaven Ancestor...although the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect had not given him much help when he was in the Divine Beginning Realm, when he came to the Universe Battlefield and came to the Star Palace, the Heaven Ancestor had met him in person, afterwards, he had personally taught him axe techniques, given him opportunities, and allowed him to directly grasp the will of destruction, allowing him to completely comprehend the principles of destruction.

All of this was indirectly helping him!
