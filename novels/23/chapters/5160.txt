Chapter 5161: A Big Deal

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The arrival of the Universe Deity-Demon List initially left everyone puzzled, and then deeply shaken.

People were baffled by the sudden appearance of this list, and then awed by the immense power of the rankings.

Such a grand gesture, coupled with the disappearance of all Yan Immortals, led the remaining Grand Yan Immortals to speculate.

Those with connections were fortunate; they knew that the Qishen Temple had emerged, connecting these two events. However, the lone wanderers without affiliations ventured into perilous lands or secluded domains, attempting to seclude themselves and evade the impending turmoil.

Little did they know, this list’s arrival marked the fairest assessment of all practitioners in the universe. Even the weakest among them could obtain abundant treasures from the Qishen Temple.

Similar to the Yan Immortals who had already entered the affiliated world of the Qishen Temple.

As soon as they entered the affiliated world of the Qishen Temple, they began to comprehend, causing all Yan Immortals in the entire universe to comprehend as well. This was merely a method employed by the True Spirits to prevent them from fighting among themselves.

Such a grand gesture was unprecedented.

In the 97th affiliated world, within a ring-shaped realm, numerous starry continents floated. Not only were there Yan Immortals who had been plundered into this world, but also some powerful wild beasts born within the realm.

However, these wild beasts and indigenous practitioners seemed oblivious to the Yan Immortals who had been displaced here. They continued living their leisurely lives.

Soon, a voice echoed throughout the entire universe.

“The Qishen Temple is officially open.”

This grand voice echoed in the hearts of everyone.

In the midst of the vast void of the Great Desolate Wilderness, the battle was still raging. Jiu Yu and the others felt the summons, but they were currently struggling on the edge of life and death, with no attention to spare for such matters.

On Jiu Yu’s side, one person stood alone, resisting hundreds of ghostly beings at the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal level. He had reached the point of exhaustion, his strength nearly depleted.

“Damn it, why hasn’t the Emperor arrived yet!” Jiu Yu, usually composed, couldn’t help but curse under his breath. The numbers of these ghostly beings were overwhelming. Although he could kill one at the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal level with a flip of his hand, he couldn’t contend with their sheer quantity.

Boom!

Another Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal couldn’t hold on any longer. He had to burn his own Dao, unleashing his most powerful strike. Then his entire body began to disintegrate, eventually vanishing into the void.

One after another, the remaining Grand Yan Immortals burned their own origin, unable to escape and unable to exterminate all the ghostly beings. They had no choice but to burn their own Dao sources to make one final contribution for others.

Jian Wushuang also snapped out of his anger amidst the roars. He turned his head and glanced at Hu Qing, hurriedly saying, “Don’t look, they can’t hold on anymore.”

Upon hearing the shout, Hu Qings eyes cleared a bit. Behind him, a rift in space appeared, and a phantom-like ghostly being was desperately struggling to break free from the engulfing void.

“Be careful!” Luo Shui, standing beside her, exclaimed, attempting to retreat and help. But in her haste, the ghostly being seized the opportunity and lunged directly at Luo Shui’s neck.

Clang!

Whoosh!

An incredibly elegant sword energy, along with its peculiar angle, slashed toward Luo Shui’s chest.

The sharpness of the sword energy sent shivers down one’s spine. The power of this strike was even stronger than when dealing with Xiang Bingyun, and it was more stable.

Splurt!

The three Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal-level ghostly beings entwined with Luo Shui directly turned into a wisp of black smoke, then completely disappeared.

Luo Shui stood still for a moment. When Jian Wushuang made his move, all she saw was a seemingly casual sword strike, without sensing any trace of the profound Dao power. However, as the sword energy passed by her, she felt a terrifying aura.

She was certain that if that sword had struck her, she would have undoubtedly perished.

“How can he be so strong?” Luo Shui wondered, but she didn’t have time to dwell on it now.

“Hu Qing, stay here to protect Fellow Daoist Luo Shui. 1 will go help the others!” Jian Wushuang said, flashing a faint smile as he passed by Luo Shui.

“Be careful, Kind Sir!” Hu Qing cautioned, then swiftly turned around, a brown staff piercing through a monster attempting to crawl out of a crack in the void.

Jian Wushuang ascended, surveying the area before launching his rescue mission.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Several swords were swung, instantly annihilating numerous ghosts at the level of Nine Revolutions.

“It’s strange. These ghosts clearly have no consciousness, so why are they so afraid of Heart power?” Although Jian Wushuang hadn’t deliberately infused Heart power into his casual strikes, he had already grasped the sword

techniques of the Heartsword World. Even his casual strikes contained a bit of power.

Puffs!

Dozens of ghosts dispersed, instantly alleviating the pressure on the local battlefield.

Whether it was the leader of the Tongtian Buddha world or other cultivators, they all wore expressions of disbelief.

A Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal casually swung his sword, directly obliterating dozens of ghosts at the level of the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal. This level of strength difference was staggering.

Especially the prodigy from the Dongyan Realm was dumbfounded. He clearly felt that Jian Wushuangs Dao was weak, so why was his strength so overwhelming?

Others shared the same thoughts, but there was simply no time to discuss this now.

“Leave this to me; you all go help the others,” Jian Wushuangs eyes were sharp. Even without truly utilizing Heart power, if he used the fifth level of the Ultimate Dao’s Heartsword World, he could probably kill ghosts at the level of the Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

As Jian Wushuangs voice echoed, everyone finally snapped back to reality, nodding quickly before rushing toward other cracks where battles were taking place.

The Dongyan Realm prodigy still didn’t understand. Jian Wushuangs Dao seemed weak, so why was his strength so overwhelming?

“He must be hiding his true power.”

“His sword technique is unique, perfectly countering these ghosts. Don’t overthink it, everyone, go help the others. Try to delay until the Emperor arrives for support.”

“Understood! ”

The group scattered, going to aid other cultivators.

Just as these people evacuated the area, another large group of ghosts swept in. This time, among the ghosts, there was one at the level of the ninth-stage perfect Grand Yan Immortal.

It emitted a dim golden light, containing fragments of the Emperor’s incomplete Dao within its illusory and ethereal body. Its hollow eye sockets resembled black holes.

Because it contained the Emperor’s fragmented Dao, these ghosts could also use some of the techniques the Emperor had learned in his lifetime, although these techniques were naturally not as powerful as the Emperor’s. Still, it surprised Jian Wushuang greatly.

The other ghosts at the level of the Six too Nine Revolutions Grand Yan

Immortal were one thing, but this Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan

Immortal-level ghost gave him a feeling akin to the deceased Xiang Binyun.

However, dealing with these ghosts now was much simpler than dealing with Xiang Binyun. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Even if Xiang Binyun was weak, he probably ranked in the top 100 million among all the Grand Yan Immortals in the entire universe. This Perfected Nine Revolutions-level ghost was only comparable to Xiang Binyun in terms of strength..
