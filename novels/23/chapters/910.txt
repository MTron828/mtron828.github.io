Chapter 911: Mountain River Map

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The third treasure?” Jian Wushuang was excited.

When he left the Fiarmament Territory, his master had promised to send him three treasures.

The first treasure was the Blood Mountain Sword which could be used both to kill and to suppress.

Its mighty power even exceeded Emperor Weapons. It had improved Jian Wushuang’s overall strength considerably.

He was good at using it.

The second treasure was the token containing the three Sword Essences which could save his life.

Each Sword Essence was more powerful than the last one. Jian Wushuang had only used two of them, and the two Sword Essences had achieved the expected effect.

Xuan Yi had once told him that he was preparing the third treasure and would find the proper time to give him it.

Now Xuan Yi had asked Xue Lingtian to give him this.

“Thank you, First Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang put the scroll into his Interspatial Ring.

“By the way, I have told our master about the wedding gifts. Just rely on him. He will give you an unparalleled gift in three years.” Xue Lingtian smiled.

Jian Wushuang blinked excitedly.

He knew his Master never broke his word.

The wedding gift was sure to be incomparable.

“Junior brother, I have to deal with some affairs at the Void Temple. Make good preparations for the Selection Ceremony! See you!” Xue Lingtian left.

After seeing him off, Jian Wushuang returned to the secret chamber.

The ancient yellow scroll was suspending in the air in front of him.

It seemed to be ordinary. If it was sold on the street, no one would take a second glance at it.

“My master is so skillful that he has given me two useful treasures. The third treasure must be even more beneficial to me, he spent such a long time preparing it. But what about its power?” Jian Wushang stared at the scroll expectantly.

“It’s only a treasure. Why are you so excited?” the Gu King asked carelessly.

“You know nothing about it. Every treasure my master has given me is of great use. So is this. And this one must be extraordinary,” Jian Wushang replied.

“Oh? Extraordinary? Jian Wushuang, do you know what level your Master has reached? Is he a Dao Master?” the Gu King asked him.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and shook his head. “My master is not a Dao Master. He has only entered the Eternal Realm.”

“Eternal Realm?” The Gu King laughed out loud, “How can you expect an Eternal Realm expert to give you an extraordinary treasure? Jian Wushuang, is your horizon so narrow?”

“Please leave me alone.” His eyes fixed upon the scroll.

“Let it recognize its lord first.” Jian Wushang dropped his blood on the scroll, waiting for it to recognize him as its lord.

Everything went smoothly.

Once the scroll recognized Jian Wushuang as its lord, he saw a glint of gold on its surface. Suddenly, the whole scroll took on an entirely new look, as if it had woken up.

“That’ s interesting.” The Gu King was astonished too, but still didn’t pay much attention.

Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief, then opened the scroll.

He saw a vivid image.

There were mountains, rivers, sky, and earth. Everything was vivid and lifelike.

The most appealing part was the nine continents, each of which was extremely realistic. Jian Wushuang took a casual look at one of them, only to see a boundless world.

A series of information was sent to Jian Wushuang from the scroll.

“It’s the Mountain River Map!”

“The endless mountains and rivers divide the Nine Provinces!”

“The mountains and rivers are as palms, and the Nine Provinces as the seal, creating the country!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked at these simple messages. A secret skill appeared in his mind.

The secret skill was called the Nine-province Seal!

The Nine-province Seal was a powerful secret skill based on the Nine Provinces in the Mountain River Map. It had nine moves in total.

The First Move, Qing Province as the seal, was called “Split the Heavens”!

The Second Move, Yu Province as the seal, was called “Hack the Earth”!

The Third Move, Yang Province as the seal, was called “Overwhelm the Rain”!

The Fourth Move, Yan Province as the seal, was called “Turn up the Cloud”!

The Fifth Move…

Jian Wushuang was in a total shock.

It also hit the Gu King.

“How can it be…”

“Incredible. It’s absolutely incredible!”

“Even I cannot crack the secret skills in the treasure? Are you kidding me?”

“Jian Wushuang, are you sure your master gave you this scroll?” the Gu King asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Is he really just an Eternal Realm expert?” The Gu King asked again.

“He is.” Jian Wushuang nodded uncertainly.

The Gu King did not say anything.

After a long period of silence, he spoke again. “If I’m right, it was your master who passed the Secret Skill which can improve your consciousness.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

If the Universal Dao Scripture did make his consciousness stronger, it had to have been refined by his Master.

“Uh huh, it seems that your master is more than an Eternal Realm expert. Even I cannot crack the Secret Skills in this treasure! If he refined this scroll, I’m certain no one can reach his level of refining weapons.” The Gu King became solemn.

Jian Wushuang was silent. He did not reply, but instead continued to study the Mountain River Map.

“The Mountain River Map works in cooperation with the Nine-province Seal. The Nine-province Seal looks extraordinary. I wonder if I’ll be able to understand the First Move of the Nine-province Seal, as well as the Second Sword Formation of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation in the next three years,” Jian Wushuang said hopefully.

The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was his unexpected tricky move. He had managed to display the Second Sword Formation when he was meditating on Star Island.

It took too much Spiritual Power for a Divine Realm expert to display the Second Sword Formation, but it became easier once he entered Eternal Realm.
