4488 The End of the Great Competition

Whoosh.

The sound of the invisible divine fire burning the air kept coming from the Corpse Cave.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm as he carefully controlled the divine fire to refine Supreme Tarot’s divine corpse inch by inch.

Under this refinement, Jian Wushuang felt that he was getting better at controlling Supreme Tarot’s body. It was as if Supreme Tarot’s divine corpse had become his second incarnation.

!!

“Break!”

The next moment, Jian Wushuang opened his mouth and shouted.

As soon as he finished speaking, the Tarot divine corpse, which had its eyes closed and was floating quietly in front of him, opened its eyes!

An extremely sharp beam of light shot out from Supreme Tarot’s eyes!

Roar!

A heaven-shaking roar came from Supreme Tarot’s mouth, forming a rolling sound wave that swept in all directions.

In the next moment, Supreme Tarot stood up, opened his mouth, and inhaled. Like a whale swallowing water, he sucked in all the divine power flames into his stomach.

In an instant, Supreme Tarot’s entire body began to exude a blazing golden light.

Muffled sounds that sounded like a sledgehammer hitting a drum kept ringing out from his body.

Whizzzzz!

In the next moment, Supreme Tarot’s aura, which was originally simple and unadorned, began to skyrocket!

“The most crucial moment has arrived!”

Jian Wushuang stared at the divine corpse of Supreme Tarot. Whether Supreme Tarot could recover his Supreme cultivation level would depend on this moment!

…

“Hei Chi, victory!”

“Zhengheng, victory!”

“Nu Xiong, victory!”

…

“Yan Dan, victory!!”

As the competition went on, it became more and more intense.

Everyone’s attention was drawn to the competition.

No one paid any more attention to Jian Wushuang. The name ‘Wushuang’ seemed to have been abandoned in a corner.

In this competition, the most praiseworthy were the five head disciples, and Yan Dan was leading the scoreboard. The strength of these five people was obviously much stronger than the disciples of the same level. Once they fought, they crushed the other disciples with force without any hesitation.

Other than that, there was a new talent called ‘Fu Chen’ who had appeared out of nowhere and rose to power.

This person was also from the God Refining Sect who had come for the entrance selection this time. He was one of the people with superb qualifications. He should have been the center of attention long ago, but some time ago, he was overshadowed by Jian Wushuang’s superb qualifications, resulting in his reputation not being well-known.

However, in this competition, he had thoroughly demonstrated his strength, soaring to the sky in one move and defeating his opponents in succession.

In the later stages of the sect competition, he even defeated the two head disciples, Hei Chi and Xuanyang, and had the final match with Yan Dan. For a time, he was in the limelight.

Everyone was saying that Void Warrior Fu Chen was the strongest disciple that the God Refining Sect had recruited this time around and was the true dark horse of this competition.

After watching Fu Chen’s battle, the God Refining Sect Master had personally spoken out in praise of him.

This caused the rising star, Fu Chen, who was already in the limelight, to become like the sun in the sky.

Three days later.

The final battle began.

Fu Chen and Yan Dan fought above the Nine Heavens.

This battle had attracted everyone’s attention!

Countless people were eagerly waiting to see who would win the competition in the end!

This battle lasted for an entire day!

The aftershock of their battle actually caused a phenomenon in the heavens and earth. Black smoke rolled up like a tide, covering the clouds and the sun.

That rookie called Fu Chen was indeed powerful. toward the end, he had actually forced Yan Dan to use his strongest trump card!

Yan Dan had broken through!

On his left shoulder, the 8-Stars that represented the Ultimate Ruler realm strength disappeared, and a long, twisted scar was formed.

Yan Dan, advancing to the Scar-level Void Master realm!

With a single palm strike, Yan Dan sent Fu Chen flying, while Yan Dan stood alone in Nine Heavens. The boundless multicolored light was his background, and the sun and moon circled around his body, making him look like a god descending from the heavens.

The Great Dao of heaven and earth crowned him.

Step by step, he descended from the clouds of the Nine Heavens, like a new king who had ascended the throne.

This sect competition, with Yan Dan as the champion, had drawn the curtains.

After the competition ended, the Sect Master of the God Refining Sect, the Void Master Ba Huang, ordered the entire sect to celebrate. He ordered all the disciples to gather outside the Sect Master’s main hall for a banquet.

This included the disciples who were not participating in the Sect Disciple Competition this time.

…

In the Corpse Cave where Jian Wushuang was in the limestone mountain.

“It’s done!”

...

Jian Wushuang’s face was slightly pale and his eyes were weak.

When Supreme Tarot’s divine corpse recovered his initial-stage Supreme cultivation, all his divine power was sucked dry at the moment of his breakthrough!

When he saw Supreme Tarot standing in front of him with a sword-like aura, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

Supreme Tarot’s divine corpse had finally recovered to the level of a Primary Supreme!

Jian Wushuang’s strength, which had already soared by a large margin, suddenly became like a tiger that had grown wings. His strength had once again taken a leap!

Although Supreme Tarot had only recovered his initial stage Supreme realm cultivation, which was not even one-tenth of his peak, he was still able to crush a large group of Supreme stage people.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and the smile on his face disappeared. He started to recover his divine power.

At this moment, a clear and majestic voice boomed in the sky above the God Refining Sect. It was directly transmitted into the ears of everyone in the God Refining Sect.

“The Sect Disciple Competition has ended. Tomorrow morning, all disciples of the God Refining Sect will head to the Sect Master’s main hall to hold a banquet!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes when he heard that. He then remembered that there was a competition between the sect’s disciples.

Jian Wushuang did not have any regrets about not being able to participate. For him, the so-called Sect Disciple Competition was just like playing house. Jian Wushuang was not even interested in it.

...

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and started to recover his divine power.

…

The next day, at 7 am.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and stood up. He left the Corpse Cave and headed toward the Sect Master’s hall.

Supreme Tarot’s divine corpse was wearing a black robe. His eyes were closed and he followed behind Jian Wushuang like a shadow.

In the sky, countless disciples turned into divine beams and flew toward the Sect Master’s hall from all directions.

“Eh? Isn’t that Wushuang? He’s finally willing to come out of seclusion?”

“Sigh, I was looking forward to Wushuang’s ranking in the sect competition. In the end, Wushuang didn’t even participate. What a pity.”

“In my opinion, it’s a wise decision for Wushuang to not participate in the Sect Disciple Competition. Otherwise, if he didn’t perform well, wouldn’t he be letting down his peerless talent?”

“That’s right. What if Wushuang’s performance isn’t good and he’s defeated right after entering the arena? Wouldn’t it be very awkward then?”

Whispers and discussions could be heard.

Nu Xiong was among them, but he did not speak. Instead, he looked at Jian Wushuang with a complicated expression.

He had fought with Jian Wushuang for a short time, so he was the only one who knew how terrifying Jian Wushuang’s strength was. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Jian Wushuang was expressionless, as if he had not heard anything, and he rushed toward the Sect Master’s hall.

Just as they were about to reach the sect master’s main hall, a clear voice suddenly rang out.

“Junior Brother Wushuang!”

Then, he saw a beautiful figure flying from behind and standing next to Jian Wushuang.

“Senior Sister Jiu Sha?”

Jian Wushuang turned his head and raised his eyebrows slightly. His eyes flashed with surprise.

There was something wrong with Jiu Sha today.
