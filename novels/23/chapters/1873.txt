Chapter 1874: Drowning Disaster

Wow!

Jian Wushuang’s hand grabbed the Sir God’s neck as though he was lifting up a chick. He moved and returned to his original position.

In the void, Jian Wushuang’s face was cold. He held the Sir God and humphed coldly. Before Emperor Sword Sect Master’s gaze, Jian Wushuang exerted strength in his grip.

Bang!

The Sir God’s head exploded from Jian Wushaung’s grip.

The Sir God expert instantly died.

“What?” The remaining few Sir Gods from Emperor Sword Sect came back to reality and they were in shock.

Emperor Sword Sect Master instantly became furious, “Jian Wushuang, how dare you, how dare you…”

“Idiot!”

Jian Wushuang roared and cut off Emperor Sword Sect Master. He was then soaring with murderous intention and his gaze was extremely cold, “Emperor Sword Sect Master, if you say anything more, I will slaughter the entire Emperor Sword Sect!”

Emperor Sword Sect Master quivered.

The five remaining Sir Gods from Emperor Sword Sect had their eyes wide open.

The surrounding experts who were watching the fight looked at Sword Emperor Sect Master in ridicule.

They knew that Jian Wushuang was not a person that one should offend but Emperor Sword Sect Master wanted to believe in himself infallibly instead.

It was true that Emperor Sword Sect had contributed greatly to Sanctuary Alliance and they were friends with many experts in Sanctuary Alliance.

However, these things were merely things on the outside.

What was the most important thing in this world? It wasn’t assistance from the outside, but one’s power!

One’s power was the true foundation.

Jian Wushuang had believed in that all his life.

So what if Emperor Sword Sect were friends with experts? If Jian Wushuang were to slaughter everyone in Emperor Sword Sect and destroy the sect, how much would the friendship cost?

Among the Almighties that were his friends, how many of them are willing to take revenge on Jian Wushuang for Emperor Sword Sect that had been destroyed?

There should be very few.

Even if there were, what could they do to Jian Wushuang?

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing.

If it was any other period of time and Emperor Sword Sect had made it difficult for him over and over again, Jian Wushuang would have started a massacre and kill everyone in Emperor Sword Sect. It was unnecessary trouble.

Then, Lineage of Star was at the heart of the struggle. Emperor Sword Sect was a major force, their foundation was solid and they were associated with many. Hence, unless it was necessary, Jian Wushuang wasn’t willing to tear it apart. Even if he was forced to attack, he wouldn’t exactly attack with full force. Otherwise, during the fight earlier, how many of the Almighties from Emperor Sword Sect would still be alive?

He believed that he had tolerated enough.

He had never expected Emperor Sword Sect Master to push to the current situation.

“After all Lineage of Star is eyed by all forces, Emperor Sword Sect is just one extra!”

Jian Wushuang had already made a decision then.

If Emperor Sword Sect Master were to say another word, he would instantly attack and kill all experts from Emperor Sword Sect in prevention of future trouble.

The experts from Emperor Sword Sect could feel Jian Wushuang’s billowing murderous intention and his determination.

They knew that Jian Wushuang wasn’t joking.

He had guts and he definitely had the capability to destroy Emperor Sword Sect on the spot.

Emperor Sword Sect Master was dumbfounded.

Because he had had a conflict with the Master of Star Palace before, he was upset and he wanted to deliberately make it difficult for Jian Wushuang.

He had never thought to have a fight with Jian Wushuang. After all, he had heard of Jian Wushuang’s power and bad name.

However, he had never expected that Jian Wushuang would come to Emperor Sword Palace and would behave so humbly and courteously with him. To the point where he had thought Jian Wushuang wasn’t as scary as rumor said.

Hence, he had made it more and more difficult for Jian Wushuang. In the end, he had even had the thought of not letting Jian Wushuang enter Emperor Sword Palace and forcing him to leave.

But he had never expected this outcome.

In other words, because of his thoughts, a Sir God from Emperor Sword Sect had died and the entire Emperor Sword Sect was on the brink of death.

His one sentence or one action could possibly bring Emperor Sword Sect to a drowning disaster!

Then, he only had two options.

Either he continued to behave stubbornly and watch Emperor Sword Sect be destroyed by Jian Wushuang. After that, Sanctuary Alliance and those experts who were friends with Emperor Sword Sect would definitely take revenge for Emperor Sword Sect, but he and the experts from Emperor Sword Sect would definitely be dead.

Or, he would lower his head and yield to Jian Wushuang.

“I, I…” Emperor Sword Sect Master muttered as he struggled in his head.

However, as he struggled in his head, there was a figure that walked out of the crowd of experts who were watching the fight.

The moment the person walked out, she immediately caught everyone’s attention.

“Luo Xianzi!”

“It’s Luo Xianzi. She walked out from the crowd. Is she going to help Emperor Sword Sect?

“Very possibly. Emperor Sword Sect promised to let Luo Xianzi enter Emperor Sword Palace. It is considered a favor to Luo Xianzi. She won’t watch as Jian Wushuang presses Emperor Sword Sect into a corner.”

The surrounding experts discussed among themselves.

The people from Emperor Sword Sect became excited. They were looking at Luo Xianzi as their final life-saving straw.

As for Jian Wushuang, he squinted his eyes when he saw Luo Xianzi walked out. He said, “Luo Xianzi, are you trying to get involved?”

“Today, Emperor Sword Sect did make it difficult for you at first, but Sword Emperor has already killed a Sir God from Emperor Sword Sect. It is already a heavy lesson to Emperor Sword Sect. It should be enough. Hence, I’d like to be a mediator. I hope both parties can just stop here. What do you think?”

“Want me to stop?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “I can, but Emperor Sword Sect must apologize to me and they must give me a million Doctrine Gems as a gift of apology. Then, I’ll let this slip.”

What Jian Wushuang said stirred a commotion at the scene.

The few people from Emperor Sword Sect, including Emperor Sword Sect Master, looked embarrassed.

To apologize to Jian Wushuang?

Although they had made it difficult first, Jian Wushuang had already killed their Sir Gods and injured them. They had already suffered a great loss. Then, they had to apologize?

And also the gift of a million Doctrine Gems. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A million Doctrine Gems, it was all a Sir God was worth.

“Why, are you unwilling to?” Jian Wushuang continued to look cold.

“Sword Emperor,” Luo Xianzi spoke again, “Why don’t we make a bet?”

“Make a bet?” Jian Wushuang looked at Luo Xianzi, “How?”

“You and I are listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. One at the twenty-first place and one at the twenty-second place. We are close in ranking and we are both good with swords. As we have met today, why don’t we have a battle?”

Luo Xianzi smiled.
