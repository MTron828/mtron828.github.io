Chapter 1450: Universe God Mo Yan

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After Jian Wushuang had made up his mind, he immediately found a space and sat down while his gaze fixed on the nine lofty sword mountains in front of him.

Every one of the nine sword mountains contained boundless sword intention and all nine of them were different.

Jian Wushuang could feel every single one of the sword intentions.

After a while, Jian Wushuang chose one of the sword mountains.

The sword mountain contained an extremely swift and fierce sword intention that seemed to be able to tear the universe.

It was extremely similar to Jian Wushuang’s sword intention.

According to Jian Wushuang’s understanding towards the sword, the sword aimed to kill and it originally contained boundless spearheads.

Only a rusty sword would lose its swiftness.

Jian Wushuang started to comprehend in silence and feel the sword intention of the sword mountain.

Along with the comprehension, his understanding towards the sword principle and sword intention continuously increased.

The time slowly passed…

Sky Sword Mountain had strict rules that no one dared to break.

Jian Wushuang stayed silent as he comprehended. No one came to interrupt him either. In the blink of an eye, it had been seventy years.

Jian Wushuang already stood up from the ground. Then, he held Blood Mountain Sword with his eyes still closed but Blood Mountain Sword started to be wielded slowly.

Whistle!

A ray of sword light suddenly flashed.

The sword light was like a frightened swan. It suddenly swept past. However, at the instant when the sword light pierced through, an extremely terrifying fierce aura suddenly erupted.

A terrifying stroke.

The stroke even attracted many cultivators’ attention.

“Rank three strongest unique skill?”

“The sword principle is so… so swift and fierce!”

“Such swift and fierce stroke carries a power that can’t be blocked.”

“I definitely couldn’t withstand that stroke.”

The cultivators complimented in silence.

There were many sword principle cultivators but there weren’t many who had reached the level of Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. One who could create a rank three strongest unique skill was even more scarce.

Hence, the sword principle that Jian Wushuang performed received their compliments.

After Jian Wushaung had performed his sword principle, he immediately stored his sword and slowly opened his eyes.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief and revealed a smile across his face.

“After comprehension for seventy years on the sword mountain, my understanding towards sword principle has increased tremendously. Although I still have yet to create a unique skill of Real God level, I have created the second rank three strongest unique skill besides Enduring Samsara.”

“This stroke advances bravely. It won’t stop without tearing apart or eliminating the person. As the sword light swings out, it is like a frightened swan. As such, the stroke should be named Frightened Swan.”

Jian Wushuang smiled.

Frightened Swan Stroke was created and Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was one step closer to perfection.

In Sky Sword Mountain, there were many buildings. Among these buildings, there were stores, bars and also entertainment places.

He was in front of a store then.

“Take your leave leisurely,” a malicious youth in a white robe said humbly as he sent two Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven away.

“Sorry for giving you so much trouble,” the two Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven didn’t act haughtily but one of them took out his Qian Kun ring, “This is a token of appreciation, please take it.”

The malicious-looking youth in a white robe beamed with joy and accepted it, “If you were to come across any trouble in Sky Sword Mountain in the future, come and look for me.”

“Sure.”

The two Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven left very soon after.

The malicious looking youth in white robe watched the two of them left and immediately ran through the Qian Kun ring. Then, he immediately wore a satisfying smile across his face as he walked into the store again.

Jian Wushuang, who was in the bar opposite the store, saw the scene.

“Universe God Mo Yan.”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was fixed on the malicious-looking youth in the white robe. His Soul Power covered the store entirely then.

“Universe God Mo Yan is really cunning. I’ve been in Sky Sword Mountain for seventy years but I’ve never seen him leave the mountain. Plus, even when he’s in Sky Sword Mountain, he normally stays in the store. In the nearby stores, there are at least four Real Gods,” Jian Wushuang sighed in silence.

He had waited in Sky Sword Mountain for seventy years. In the seventy years, most of the time he had comprehended at the sword mountain, but he was looking for a chance to take action simultaneously.

However, for seventy years, he had never found any chance to take action.

In the end, Jian Wushuang concluded that if he wanted to kill Universe God Mo Yan, he could only do it in the store, under the watch of the four Real Gods.

“If it were to be any ordinary cultivator, even if he was an expert of Real God level, to kill Universe God Mo Yan under the watch of four Real Gods and leave would be almost impossible. However, I might stand a chance,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He was different from ordinary cultivators. After all, he was good at Soul Attacks.

The scariest part about Soul Attacks were that he could kill his opponent quietly without much movement.

“Although the four Real Gods are nearby, it is impossible for them to disperse their consciousness at all times to pay close attention to their surroundings. Even if someone died near them, as long as there was no noise, no eruption of divine power, they shouldn’t be able to discover it. This is my chance!” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“Universe God Mo Yan, although he is a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, he isn’t strong in consciousness. He should only be at the level of an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven. According to my current soul strength, if I were to perform the Inextinguishable Light with the secret skill of Tian Yuan with full force, the sudden attack should have a high, seventy-percent chance to be able to kill him!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“A seventy-percent success rate is already very high!”

“After killing him, I will leave immediately. By the time the Real Gods realize, I should be out of Sky Sword Mountain.”

Jian Wushuang thought it through again and decided to take action.

Immediately, Jian Wushuang left the bar and walked into the store opposite Universe God Mo Yan.

Jian Wushuang arrived in the store and he saw the malicious-looking youth in a white robe who was inspecting a ton at the desk, Universe God Mo Yan.

Besides Universe God Mo Yan, there were two servants at the entrance of the store. Universe God Mo Yan’s eyes beamed with joy the moment he saw Jian Wushuang enter.

He could feel Jian Wushuang’s aura, which revealed him to be a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. On Sky Sword Mountain, Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven were all big customers.

“Mister, how can I help you?’ Universe God Mo Yan stood up and asked with a smile.

“I need a few elixirs to help to stabilize my mind and body. It must be of a higher level. I wonder if you sell them?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course. But we at Sky Sword Mountain sell things at a higher price compared to other places. I wonder if mister can accept this?” Universe God Mo Yan asked again.
