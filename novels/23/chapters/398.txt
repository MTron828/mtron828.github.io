Chapter 399: Distribution

“Take out all the Blood Gems you have,” General Qing said as he took out five Blood Gems.

“I have several, ” Lei Dao said laughingly and showed his four Blood Gems with a wave of his hand.

“I also have some.”

“I’m luckier than you guys.”

All the commanders produced their Blood Gems, including Jian Wushuang, who took out three gems.

He had obtained the least number of gems. This was because he had devoted his attention to controlling the Blood River to restrain the Silver-winged Army experts.

The other commanders had a much larger haul than him.

The Iron Saber Army commanders had seized an astonishing number of Blood Gems.

“31 gems!” General Qing laughed.

“Haha...”?Lei Dao and other commanders also laughed.

They had been outnumbered but they had obtained 31 gems, many more than the Silver-winged Army’s harvest of 20 gems.

“There’s seven of us and we have a total of 31 Blood Gems. Each person should get four gems. For the three remaining gems, I’ll take one, and Swordsman takes the last two. Do you agree with that?” asked General Qing.

“No problem!”

“Quite fair.”

Lei Dao, Boozer, and other commanders smiled and nodded their assent.

General Qing was a king and Stage Three expert. Of course, he would get an additional gem.

As for Swordsman... He had contributed most during the battle. Had he not restricted the Silver-winged Army experts, the Iron Saber Army commanders would not have been as successful in retrieving the Blood Gems. In consideration of this, Jian Wushuang deserved to get more gems.

General Qing distributed the 31 Blood Gems.

The commanders were pleased as they received their rewards.

“The Blood Gems are extremely valuable in Divine Land. Even the super experts?of Cloud Realm covet them. Even if I don’t need them, wow, I can sell the four gems at a good price,” Lei Dao laughed.

“If you want to sell the Blood Gems, you can sell them to me. I need them,” Jian Wushuang said abruptly.

“Swordsman, why do you need them?” General Qing looked at Jian Wushuang and asked.

“I have a Puppet Fighter which is powered by Blood Gems. It’d be better if I can collect more Blood Gems,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“A Puppet Fighter powered by Blood Gems?” General Qing was surprised.

Blood Gems possessed vast stores of power, which could be used to refine elixirs, magic weapons, and puppet fighters.

General Qing was aware that Blood Gems could be used to drive some special Puppet Fighters. Such Puppet Fighters were of high level and had impressive battle strength.

“You have a lot of aces up your sleeve,” General Qing hid his admiration as he considered Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman, if you need them, we can give you some gems,” Lei Dao offered generously.

“No,” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “if you treat me as a friend, just sell them to me at the market price.”

“All right,” There was no hesitation from Lei Dao. “How many do you need? We should have enough among us.”

Jian Wushuang removed treasures of equivalent value from his Interspatial Ring for exchange with the commanders.

Jian Wushuang almost emptied his Interspatial Ring to get six Blood Gems from Lei Dao and the other commanders.

This brought his total haul of Blood Gems to twelve. With the three gems he had acquired from the Ancestor’s Land, he had a total of fifteen Blood Gems now.

“That’s enough!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with anticipation.

One Blood Gem was sufficient to power the Blood Puppet, but it would be stronger in battle if it consumed more Blood Gems.

If he used 10 gems at the same time, he would reach the limit of its power.

15 gems were enough for the Blood Puppet to show its strongest power once.

While the Iron Saber Army distributed their Blood Gems, the Silver-winged Army experts looked on in envy from the void where they stood.

However, they could do nothing about it.

“Let’s go.”

Wu Ta sighed softly and made his way back to the Silver-winged Army barracks with his commanders.

Jian Wushuang and the others returned to the rebuilt barracks and waited there quietly.

Half a day later had elapsed and it was near dusk when Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord emerged from the cave mansion.

“Haha!”

Iron Saber Lord stood in the Void, robes flapping despite the absence of wind.

“Iron Saber, you got a lot of treasure this time,” Silver Wing Lord was green with envy. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It’s just good luck,” Iron Saber Lord beamed. “You’re also lucky. Though you didn’t get the last chance, you got quite a number of treasures too.”

“Not as good as you,” Silver Wing Lord curled his lips. “I’ll go now!”

Silver Wing Lord departed.

Iron Saber Lord’s smile widened as he stared at the retreating figure of Silver Wing Lord. He made a slight move and appeared instantaneously in the barracks of Iron Saber Army.

“Lord Commander.”

General Qing, Jian Wushuang, and others had been waiting there for a long time.

“You’ve done a good job this time. The harvest in that cave mansion was plentiful. Here is an Interspatial Ring. You can divide the treasures in it,” the Lord threw them an Interspatial Ring.

“Thank you, my lord,” General Qing caught the ring and bowed.

“Swordsman,” the Lord looked at Jian Wushuang with his indifferent eyes which seemed to contain everything in heaven and earth.

“Lord Commander,” Jian Wushuang’s heart pounded.

The Lord gave him a gentle smile. “You’re very good.”

After saying this, the Lord disappeared into the void.

“Haha, Swordsman, even Lord Commander praised you,” Lei Dao looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang touched his nose and gave a faint smile.

“Well, don’t make fun of Swordsman. Come on, let’s quickly divide treasures,” Yao Mei suggested.

“Yes, yes, let’s divide the treasures!”

“Wow, Lord Commander must have gotten a lot of treasures in the cave mansion. He certainly has been generous in rewarding us.”

With anticipation, they checked the treasures in the Interspatial Ring and were ecstatic.

“So many treasures!”

“Haha, Lord Commander is really generous!”

“Swordsman, I regret it now. If I had known that Lord Commander would give us so many rewards, I wouldn’t have exchanged the Blood Gem with you. I should have kept the gems. They may be useful in the future.”

“Don’t you still have three gems?”

The commanders continued to distribute the treasures while joking among themselves.
