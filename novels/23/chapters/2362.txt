Chapter 2363: Set Off for Water Fairy Island

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Three days later, the treasures, including half of all properties the Zhuge Family owned, were given to the Lin Family.

Experts from the Lin Mansion started to check the items.

Jian Wushuang was not interested in the properties at all. He merely took some elixirs and treasures that would help him in accumulating his divine power and kept some for his own parents. As for the remaining items, he gave them to the Lin Mansion.

His father was the one who told him to do this.

After all, the Lin Family suffered even greater losses in the battle as compared to the Zhuge Family. These items would help Lin Family greatly in recovering from the battle.

In the blink of an eye, ten days passed.

“Father, mother. I will head for the Water Fairy Island.”

Jian Wushuang stood at the door of the Lin Mansion and bid farewell to Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin.

“Wushaung, you are very talented and very mature. I will nag anymore. Take care of yourself.” Zhou Yunfeng.

“Wushuang, please come back and visit. Don’t be like your older sister and brother who immersed themselves in cultivating.” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Roger.” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at Lin Tiefeng. “Uncle Lin, please take care of my parents after I leave.”

“Don’t worry, nephew. Unless the Lin Mansion is annihilated, I will not allow anyone to harm Brother Zhuo and sister-in-law.” Lin Tiefeng said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

After a simple farewell, Jian Wushuang left with Wu Jian and the other experts from the Water Fairy Island.

...

When Jian Wushuang just left for Water Fairy Island.

At the center of the Wusha Barren Region, a giant clan was hidden within an ancient forest.

This clan was the Great Compassion Sect.

There was a dark cave. The only light source was the dimly lit candles.

There was a blurry figure who sat at the deepest point within the dark cave.

An elder in black clothes walked into the cave slowly and stopped in front of the blurry figure.

“Ancient elder, the Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture sent us a message.” The elder in black clothes said very respectfully.

The blurry figure raised his head. He had a pale, young, and handsome face. “What did he say?”

“Bai Yue said that he personally verified that Jian Wushuang, whom he referred to us, was indeed someone who is extremely talented in the Sword Doctrine. He killed a Chaotic Divine Demon while he was in the Early Stage Chaotic Realm. However...” The elder in black clothes stopped.

“However?” It was evident that the blurry figure was interested in Jian Wushuang.

“As Bai Yue said, he tried his best to invite Jian Wushuang to the Great Compassion Sect. He even mentioned you. However, Jian Wushuang rejected the offer and accepted the invitation from the Water Fairy Island and became an outer disciple.” The elder in black clothes said.

“Outer disciple? So this genius called Jian Wushuang rather became an ordinary outer disciple in the Water Fairy Island than to become my lineal disciple?” The blurry figure said as a ray of unique emotion flashed across his eyes.

“Yes.” The elder in black clothes nodded his head.

“Haha~~~”

Cold laughter reverberated within the cave. The head of the elder in black clothes went numb and he felt like it was going to explode.

“Alright. I was not interested in the little one before. Now, he has successfully gotten my attention. From today on, watch the Water Fairy Island and the little one. I want to see where this little one gets his courage to look down on me.”

“Yes.”

The elder in black clothes nodded his head respectfully and left.

...

Within a seemingly endless space.

Jian Wushuang, Wu Jian, and the two other tier two Chaotic Divine Demons from the Water Fairy Island traveled at great speed.

“Lord Wu Jian, how long more before we reach the Water Fairy Island?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“The Water Fairy Island is not located in the Anjiu Prefecture. There are three other prefectures located between them. There is also no space tunnel found within any of the three prefectures, hence we have to travel by foot. At the speed we are going, we can reach the place within two months. We have already traveled for more than one month. We should reach within a few days.” Wu Jian said.

“There is no need to call me Lord Wu Jian. I am the ninth elder in the Water Fairy Island. Just call me Elder Wu Jian or Elder Nine.” Wu Jian said.

“Elder Wu Jian.” Jian Wushuang called.

“Haha. Little friend Wushuang, we are reaching the Water Fairy Island. You can still change your mind and become a core disciple of the Water Fairy Island.” Wu Jian smiled.

“Elder Wu Jian. You have asked me this at least ten times on our way here. I only want to be an outer disciple of the Water Fairy Island.” Jian Wushuang smiled and shook his head.

Jan Wushuang was not interested in becoming a core disciple or lineal disciple of a higher-up in the Water Fairy island.

The reason why he joined the Water Fairy Island was because of circumstances.

As an outer disciple, he will not be under any restrictions. Hence, he will also have lesser responsibilities.

“Since you insist, then I shall not ask you anymore. After we reach the Water Fairy Island, I will announce that you are an outer disciple and bring you to the place where you will live. However, I will try my best to persuade the other higher-ups of the Water Fairy Island to give you the number of resources that a core disciple will get.” Wu Jian said.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders.

He was not particular about the number of resources he will receive.

The four people continued to make their way to the Water Fairy Island.

A few days later, a majestic clan located at the center of two mountain ranges was seen.

This clan was tens of thousands of miles long.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, this meant nothing. There were no restrictions in spacetime, hence cultivators could travel tens or even hundreds of thousands of miles within seconds.

In the Absolute Beginning Divine World, a clan this size was considered large given the presence of the Heaven’s Will.

“Little Friend Wushuang. This is where the Water Fairy Island is located. The reason we are called an island is not that we are located on an island. However, we do have a small island at the core of the clan.

“Let’s go. I will bring you into the clan.”

Under the guidance of Wu Jian, Jian Wushuang walked into the Water Fairy Island.
