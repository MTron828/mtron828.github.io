Chapter 5429 ¬†Zhen Ling's Scheme

There were indeed legacies and treasures of the Three Kings in the West Sea ruins, but Zhen Ling was not interested in them.

Back when the Qishen Temple was established, it had plundered all the treasures in the River of Spacetime. There was simply no end to it.

Even with the appearance of Universe Masters, Zhen Ling could afford it.

The plan in the Western Sea was for Hu Qing, and as for the follow-up, it would be left to others.

This time, he emerged victorious.

At least, that's how he saw it.

Shen Ling of the Giant God Clan had resurrected a Universe Master, but there was a significant difference in Origin Source, and after so many years of rigidity, only half of the power remained.

Even if resurrected, there wasn't much of a threat.

As soon as they left the remnants, his true form could descend upon the Western Sea and slay the opponent.

"Fuego!"

Zhen Ling turned to Shang, saying casually, "Are you going in?"

Shang nodded, determination in his eyes.

"Not waiting?"

"No more waiting. The secret technique couldn't reach a higher realm. Perhaps it's because I haven't encountered a suitable opponent!"

Shang let out a sigh. Over these years, he had broken through continuously, but it wasn't much. In the Time Pavilion, he had spent at least tens of thousands of epochs.

The only difference from the outside world was having Zhen Ling's guidance, and the inheritances he obtained illuminated the path ahead.

Now, the road ahead was broad, and he wanted to continue, not just in seclusion. So, he went to the River of Time.

Once a mysterious River of Time, now exploring it felt less challenging than the Four Great Secret Realms.

Too few powerful beings, too few resources.

This River of Time was relatively young, lacking even a Universe Master. Compared to the ancient River of Time where Qishen resided, the difference was vast.

Zhen Ling's thoughts drifted, recalling the past of Qishen.

Compared to Qishen, the era of these Inheritors wasn't much worse.

In the beginning, Qishen was born on an ancient desolate star, teeming with wild beasts, with no place for the human race.

Now, in the external River of Time, at least the cultivators held sway, and special life forms had to stay on the sidelines.

Zhen Ling pointed, and a black hole appeared. He warned, "Be careful, the opponent's background is very mysterious. Escape if you encounter danger!"

"Don't worry, I'm not like those young people!"

Shang smiled. He was already a venerable figure in the Original Universe. How could he act recklessly? If unable to win, he would definitely choose to escape.

Watching Shang enter the black hole, Zhen Ling turned his gaze back to Hu Qing.

Although Shang's potential was strong, his path was somewhat extreme.

The Path of Destruction!

Not suitable!

According to the will of Qishen, nurturing successors should follow a more stable path. Like Hu Qing, who pursued the way of Zen, deducing all things, he would become a pinnacle powerhouse in the universe in the future and also restrain himself because he saw farther than others.

This way, perhaps he could continue to progress and avoid walking the old path of Qishen.

It's important to note that in this world, achieving eternal existence is not so easy.

Outside the Lingtai Spring.

Watching the radiant display and the rise of fate energy, experienced Emperors knew that someone inside had succeeded.

"Success, congratulations, Tongtian!" V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

Fengyu, Zhen Wuyang, and Chishui all congratulated with clasped fists.

Tongtian Buddha nodded with gratification.

He had high expectations for Hu Qing. Unlike Wuliang Buddha, Tongtian Buddha was not narrow-minded and could accept others being stronger than him.

Tongtian Buddha was even more open-minded. The Ultimate Dao was to be stronger than them, and that was an undeniable fact.

Don't talk about the Myriad Dao or the divine body paths; these were all useless.

Even if your Origin Source mutated, it wouldn't work.

Thinking about this, Tongtian Buddha looked at Zhen Wuyang.

Surprisingly, the Origin Source could indeed mutate. Since entering the Qishen Temple, Zhen Wuyang's Origin Source had mutated.

The Origin Source of a cultivator had regressed, transforming into the Origin Source of an ancient mythical beast.

Whether it was good or bad, it had undoubtedly increased his strength.

Otherwise, Zhen Wuyang wouldn't have been able to catch up with the speed of Fengyu and Chishui so quickly after being suppressed by them initially.

Back then, Fengyu had suppressed them, but soon after entering the Qishen Temple, Zhen Wuyang quickly surpassed them.

The potential of Fengyu is ordinary, considered a middle-of-the-road second-grade Origin Source Dao.

In the future, he could reach the supreme-peak, but going further would be difficult.

It's not that one must possess a special Origin Source Dao to become the Universe Master; it's that after becoming the Universe Master, without a unique Origin Source Dao, one simply cannot live for long.

Since inheriting the legacy of the Universe Master, Tongtian Buddha's perspective has widened considerably.

Even Emperors aspire to become the Universe Master, but once they understand the reality, there are probably not many who harbor such thoughts.

After becoming the Universe Master, one faces even more tribulations.

At least an Emperor, with some fate energy, can exist for a long time if they keep a low profile.

But the Universe Master is different.

Tribulations!

The Universe Master is truly like the universe, with all kinds of tribulations.

If one cannot overcome them, they will perish.

Tongtian Buddha even speculates that the reason Qishen fell was that he couldn't overcome the tribulations, and he perished with the River of Time.

Becoming the Universe Master without an extremely exceptional Origin Source Dao is akin to seeking death.

Only those Ultimate existences can go further.

"He's out!"

Tongtian Buddha and the others smiled, looking at Hu Qing and Jiang Shang.

After breaking through, Hu Qing sensed the surrounding powerhouses, somewhat surprised.

"Greetings to the Emperors, Lord Buddha, and Hall Masters!" Hu Qing bowed, acknowledging the Emperors despite his breakthrough.

On the Grave God Mountain, not only did Zhen Ling take care of him, but Tongtian Buddha and others also looked after this junior.

Tongtian Buddha faintly smiled and said, "Hu Qing, you've achieved the rank of Emperor. According to the rules of our hometown world, you are now also a Lord Buddha."

The Great Yan Immortal is a Bodhisattva, the Yan¬†Immortal is an Arhat, and the mundane are mere novices.

Hu Qing grew from a novice to a Buddha.

For a moment, everything seemed surreal.

But he knew deep down that he had embarked on the path of Zen, diverging from the path of Buddha.

Facing the enthusiasm of the Tongtian Buddha, he didn't say much, just gave a faint smile.

"You just broke through to tier 5. Hu Qing, your spatial realm is quite high!"

Hu Qing replied, "Now it's the stellar realm!"

This statement immediately made Gui Ling and others in the distance jealous.

A Dao Lord just merged with the Dao, and his spatial realm became the same as theirs.

Moreover, when the spatial realm reached the stellar realm, it was equivalent to tier 6 Emperor in the Four Great Secret Realms.

However, Hu Qing was still a tier 5 Emperor.

This indicated a significant gap in their understanding of the Origin Source Dao.

"Junior Hu Qing successfully merged with the Dao and became a tier 5 Emperor. I'm afraid his combat power can rival a tier 6 peak." Fengyu praised, feeling a bit dazed.

When he entered the Qishen Temple, he was the peak of the Original Universe. Now, although he had become the coveted tier 5 peak-level, he was no longer the peak of the Original Universe.

It was unclear whether he had become stronger or weaker.

Many people had such thoughts.

Now, many Inheritors had sent avatars back to the Original Universe.

But in the current Original Universe, there were no conflicts whatsoever.
