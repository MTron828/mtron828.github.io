Chapter 1487: The Fight For Prestige

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang was not too concerned with a thousand-million Chaos Gems.

What he was concerned about was time.

After all, his wife had been completely suppressed by Leng Ruxue.

Moreover, it had been a very long time since Leng Ruxue left the Green Fire World. In that period of time, he had absolutely no idea how Leng Rushuang was doing.

Did her circumstances become worse?

Jian Wushuang was as anxious as a burning fire.

Naturally, it was better for Leng Ruxue to be found as early as possible.

“Ten thousand years is already considered short,” The purple-haired old man said. All of a sudden, his expression changed, “By the way, do you have a picture of Leng Ruxue, or portrait-related items?”

“I have her portrait,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

He would naturally have a portrait of his own wife. Even if he didn’t, he could rely on his own memory and draw one on the spot.

After receiving the portrait, the purple-haired old man swept his eyes past it. Afterward, he revealed a smile, “What a great beauty. In the whole Eternal Chaotic World, there are not many people with such good looks. This makes it easier for us to find her. How about this? The cost will remain unchanged at a thousand million Chaos Gems. My Vientiane Tower will do our best to give you an answer within three thousand years.”

“Three thousand years?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted, “No problem. This is the three hundred million Chaos Gem deposit. When there is news, I will give you the remaining amount.”

“Alright,” the purple-haired old man accepted the Chaos Gem heartily.

Jian Wushuang left his own transmission token behind and left.

…

Inside a pub, Jian Wushuang sat on a side desk and drank wine by himself.

“Shuang’er…”

An extremely beautiful figure that could move people appeared in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Three thousand years… No matter where you are, I will definitely find you!”

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and his eyes glowed brilliantly.

Leng Rushuang was his wife, as well as the love of his life!

“Jian Wushuang,” a message was sent over abruptly.

“Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang replied immediately.

“Where are you? Are you within the Lineage of Star?” Hall Master Yuan questioned.

“Nope, but I am about to go back now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t return first, I need your help for a small matter,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang revealed a surprised expression.

“This is what happened,” Hall Master Yuan spoke.

“Within our Star Land, there is a weak, small sect known as Green Lightning Sect. The Green Lightning Sect is under the charge of the Lineage of Star. Not long ago, Green Lightning Sect and its opponent Seven Planet Sect agreed on a duel between their disciples. Naturally, this duel concerned the benefits the sects would get respectively. Hence, both sides had a tacit agreement to invite experts from the outside.”

“Naturally, the Green Lightning Sect requested the aid of the Lineage of Star at once. The Lineage of Star had never declined before and we sent a Star Palace disciple over.”

“Initially, with a Star Palace disciple who is a Universe God of the Third Heaven, it would be easy to help the Green Lightning Sect win the duel. However, the Green Lightning Sect lost the duel.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang shuddered.

All of the Star Palace disciples were geniuses among geniuses. A Star Palace disciple who was a Universe God of the Third Heaven should have fighting capabilities nearing that of the Universe Gods on the Universe God ranking list. However, the Universe God of the Third Heaven had actually lost to a disciple of the Seven Planet Sect?

“Could it be that the Seven Planet Palace invited an expert from the Universe God ranking list?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“It would be good if the Seven Planet Palace invited an expert from the Universe God ranking list. After all, all the experts in the Universe God ranking list were extremely famous and they would be recognized straight away. The Lineage of Star and the Green Lightning Sect would be able to take precautions. However, the main point is that the person whom the Seven Planet Palace invited is a Universe God that ihas never been heard of before. His name is Ling Dan. Before this, Ling Dan did not have any reputation. However, he is extremely powerful,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“When that duel began, one of the deacons was present. The deacon believed that although the Universe God whom the Seven Planet Palace invited had no reputation, looking at his abilities, he could be ranked within the Universe God ranking list. Moreover, he might be in the top fifty, or even the top forty!”

Jian Wushuang became stupefied at once.

Top forty of the Universe God ranking list… The two most outstanding Star Palace disciples of the Lineage of Star were unable to rank in the top forty of the Universe God ranking list.

“The disciple of our Lineage of Star was defeated in that duel. Moreover, the defeat was extremely tragic. Initially, this was nothing. However, the key point was that during the duel between Ling Dan and the disciple of the Star Palace, Ling Dan used every possible means to humiliate the disciple. Moreover, he spoke of the Star Palace and Lineage of Star many times…”

“After that duel ended, he also mentioned that he would stay within the Seven Planet Palace for this period of time and wait for the Lineage of Star to send an even more outstanding student to fight him. Moreover, this was said in front of many cultivators. What do you think he is trying to do?” Hall Master Yuan questioned.

“That is very simple. He wishes to use our Star Palace disciples as a stepping stone and make a name for himself in the Eternal Chaotic World so that he can get into the Universe God ranking list,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“That’s right,” Hall Master Yuan laughed, “He wishes to make a name for himself by using the Star Palace disciples as a whetstone. How can my Lineage of Star allow that? If he really gets his way with it, would our Lineage of Star still have face?”

“Understood, you wish for me to go to the Green Lightning Sect and defeat that Ling Dan head on?” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“That’s right. Ling Dan’s strength is very impressive. Among the Star Palace disciples, you should be the only one with the power to defeat him,” Hall Master Yuan spoke: “Moreover, letting you take action is not merely for the Lineage of Star’s face. It is also for yourself.”

“You already have the fighting capabilities to be in the Universe God ranking list. However, within the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, you remained silent and unknown. This is the opportunity for you to prove yourself.”

“I do not wish to prove myself. Being unknown to public might not be bad,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If you were an expert by yourself, it would be fine even if you didn’t have a reputation. However, you are a disciple of the Lineage of Star. Since the Lineage of Star has such a splendid disciple, how can we not let the people know about it? Hall Master Yuan said.

“At the end of the day, isn’t it for prestige?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Since you understand, all is well. Stop with the unnecessary complaints, please go.”

After finish talking, Hall Master Yuan terminated the transmission.

“Jian Wushuang, do you feel that you have no choice? Although you are unwilling to make a reputation for yourself, the Lineage of Star has forced you to do so.” The King of Venomous Worms’ voice, which was filled with interest, echoed in Jian Wushuang’s head, “Actually, this is very normal. To a sect, especially a great force like the Lineage of Star, there is no longer any huge benefit to fight for. Hence, they can only fight for prestige.”

“By having a very powerful disciple under them, it is beneficial to he Lineage of Star in terms of recruiting other exceptional disciples or in terms of other areas.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. As he knew the thought process of the highest administration of the Lineage of Star such as Hall Master Yuan, he could understand.

“Since Hall Master Yuan has given an order personally, I shall make a trip to the Green Lightning Sect. At the same time, I will fight for the Lineage of Star’s prestige!”

Jian Wushuang moved his body immediately.
