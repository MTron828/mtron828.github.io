Chapter 2965: Promotion Mission

——

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s answer, Elder Qiu’s expression became strange.

Elder Qiu was an Immortal Saint himself. He could tell at a glance that Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master.

As for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, even if it was an ordinary three-star mission, it had to be at least a top-notch False Saint.

Could it be that this Divine Master had the battle strength of a first-rate False Saint?

Of course, Elder Qiu had some doubts in his heart.

But what he did not know was that Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was far more than that of a False Saint.

Although he was puzzled, Elder Qiu would not ask too much, he just followed the normal procedure and said, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, there’s something you have to remember. It’s one thing to complete the promotion mission alone on the way, but in the process of the mission, you need to use the mirror token to record the whole process.”

“Use the mirror token to record the whole process?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Yes, only in this way can the Heaven-cleaving Alliance determine whether you really completed the promotion mission alone. For example, if your mission is to kill an expert, you don’t have to record anything else, but you have to use the mirror token to record the whole process of the battle between you and the expert,” said Elder Qiu.

“Of course, you don’t have to worry about it. The images recorded by the Mirror Spiritual Talisman are top secret. No matter what you did or how you did it, no one will know about it. The only thing we need to know is whether you completed the task alone.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He could barely accept the fact that it was just a chance of a fierce battle.

After all, it was just an ordinary three-star mission, so it should not pose much of a threat to him now. He did not need to use all his strength to expose his many trump cards.

“Go.” Elder Qiu waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang immediately set off.

…

The Green River Realm was an area far away from the no. 385 nest in the endless territory.

Jian Wushuang had paid a price to come here through the wormhole of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

In an ancient sect.

Whoosh!

A majestic sword light mercilessly slashed down.

The sect-protecting formation that had protected the sect for a long time was split in half by the sword light, and the power of the divine power spread wildly.

After that, a human figure charged into this sect-like lightning.

“Who is it that can break into my Green River Palace!?”

“You’re courting death!!”

“Kill him!!”

The entire Green River Palace instantly stirred up, and a large number of Green River Palace experts rushed out, including the five Immortal Saints within the Green River Palace.

Amongst these five Immortal Saints, one was a Peak False Saint.

The five of them joined hands and blocked in front of that human figure.

But in the end, that human figure only slashed out with a tyrannical sword.

That sword easily crushed the void, crushing everything. It also crushed the combined attack of the five Immortal Saints from the Green River Palace.

The five Immortal Saints from the Green River Palace were sent flying on the spot. Two of them even spat out fresh blood.

The figure did not have any obstacles. He broke into the inner part of Green River Palace and into the many cultivators under the command of Green River Palace. Finally, he found a brown-haired demonic youth in the crowd, this brown-haired demonic youth was Jian Wushuang’s target.

“It’s you!”

Killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He swung his Blood Mountain Sword like an electric arc and chopped off the head of the demonic youth.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang soared into the sky and left. No one from the Green River Palace dared to stop him.

Among the three three-star missions that Jian Wushuang had received, the first mission was to kill a Great Divine Master under the protection of the Green River Palace.

Mission, completed!

…

In the dark and cold void.

Whew!

A sorry figure, with his life the fastest speed in that crazy escape.

This figure was a young man with fair skin and a thin and weak figure. The aura that this young man exuded was quite tyrannical. He was a Peak False Saint and his combat strength was not ordinary. However, at this moment, he…and he was being hunted like a stray dog.

It was Jian wushuang who was chasing him.

“How can I be found when I have hidden in this place?”

“And the person who found me, obviously just a deity, but combat strength, how can be so strong?”

The young man’s face was aghast, and his heart was full of shock.

He has been hiding here for a long time, and no one has found him for so many years, but today, not only has someone found him, but the god who found him…it was terrible!!

It was indeed terrifying. He was clearly only at the deity realm, but the moment he attacked, he brought along endless sword intent and unleashed a shocking sword attack that crushed the young man.

The second sword attack had severely injured the young man.

If it were not for the fact that his life-saving methods were not bad, he would have died under the second sword attack.

But now, although he was still alive, he was being pursued by that Divine Master.

“He’s faster than me?”

“No, no!”

The young man was completely terrified.

As Jian Wushuang closed the distance between them, his fear gradually turned into despair.

In the end, Jian Wushuang caught up with him and attacked again. This time, Jian Wushuang used the Samsara Sword Formation. The terrifying Samsara sword formation shattered the young man’s divine body with just one attack.

The second task was completed.

…

It was a vast and boundless arena.

This arena was more than enough for two powerful true saints to fight on.

There were countless spectators around the arena. On the arena, Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask, pointed his longsword and easily defeated a Peak Divine Master in front of him.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, the 88th victory!”

As the host announced the result, the spectators around the ring burst into cheers.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

Countless people were calling his name.

However, Jian Wushuang’s expression was extremely cold. Soon, he saw his 89th opponent enter the ring.

This opponent was also a Divine Master, but he was a rare Invincible Divine Master.

However, in the end, the Invincible Divine Master still lost to Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang easily won 89 battles, followed by the 90th and 100th battles!

In less than three days, Jian Wushuang had won 100 battles.

The third mission, to win 100 battles in the Star Battlefield, was also successfully completed.

This mission was the easiest among the three three-star missions that Jian Wushuang had received, but the reward was not low.
