Chapter 884: Oh no!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The once chaotic Drill Ground had turned dead silent all of a sudden.

It was so quiet that you could hear a needle drop.

Those standing on the Drill Ground widened their eyes, their mouths making an ‘O’ shape.

The words of Lord Spirit Sound were still ringing in their heads.

Just a moment ago, Xuefeng had broken through Level Two of the black tower!

He had only been on Star Island for less than two years and had already surpassed Level Two!

“How is that possible?”

The crowd was stunned, barely anyone could accept this fact.

However, the one who proclaimed it had been Lord Spirit Sound. Since it was said by a person like him, there was nothing to doubt about it.

Xuefeng really did surpass it!

“Amazing! Really amazing!”

“How long has it been? He actually surpassed it in just two short years?”

“The second level of the black tower is more difficult than the first by ten times at least. Except for those strong Monsters, the Kings on Star Island had been stuck at the first level for a very long time. Furthermore, they even cultivated a strong Secret Skill, but it did not manage to surpass Level Two. However, this Xuefeng...”

“He’s a Monster, a Monster that cannot be comprehended.”

Numerous people were gasping in shock, each feeling very emotional about this news.

After the momentary shocks, their gaze returned back to Tian Quan, who was standing in the middle of the Drill Ground. However, this time around, their eyes was very strange.

In fact, some even showed a sense of schadenfreude.

Just a moment before, they were gasping at Tian Quan’s skills and were guessing how strong he could become after having a breakthrough in that Secret Skill.

But now....everyone had the same thought.

“Things are not good for Tian Quan!”

Things are not good!

Tian Quan was now in trouble, a tragedy!

Even Tian Quan himself was well aware of his circumstances.

“How, how is this possible?” Tian Quan froze completely. He had yet to walk out of that state of shock.

Just before that, Tian Quan had not paid much attention to Jian Wushuang.

Three days ago, Jian Wushuang had used the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation to suppress him. However, he had not given much thought about it. Besides, once he achieved a breakthrough in the Secret Skill that he was refining, his strength would definitely reach a whole new level.

He had the ultimate confidence that he could defeat Jian Wushuang easily. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

But now, Jian Wushuang had yet to appear at the scene. Just the Lord Spirit Sound’s message alone was enough to bring him to despair.

“Level Two? He actually surpassed Level Two? That’s impossible.” Tian Quan shook his head crazily.

God, this was the second time.

Only the strongest Monster among the 12 Kings of Star Island had surpassed it as well. Furthermore, that Monster took a damn long time to achieve that.

But this Xuefeng had only been in the Star Island for two years and he already achieved such tremendous improvements in his strength.

“That’s it, that’s it!”

Tian Quan was expressionless. He was very clear of his own circumstance. Although his strength was skyrocketing, there was still a huge gap between him and Level Two. He was obviously not a worthy opponent of Jian Wushuang who had already surpassed it.

People around him were giving him looks of pity.

Just at that moment...whoosh! A shadow came flying past them. It was Jian Wushuang who had just walked out of the black tower!

After passing Level Two’s challenge, which was to defeat the High Ranked Blood Demon, Jian Wushuang had attempted to break through Level Three.

His opponent was once again a Blood Demon, but its strength was extremely scary. Jian Wushuang gave his best but failed after being hit by two knives.

After walking out of the black tower, Jian Wushuang immediately rushed towards the Drill Ground. Upon arrival, he saw many complicated looks.

Some were in shock, some filled with admiration, and some were even filled with jealousy.

“Seems like Lord Spirit Sound has already released the news of me passing Level Two?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Lord Spirit Sound and thought to himself.

“Xuefeng, Tian Quan, since the both of you are here, then let’s begin today’s duel.” said Lord Spirit Sound.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head slightly and immediately glanced at Tian Quan. His gaze became cold.

“Bastard!” Tian Quan had a dark expression on his face and his body was shaking in anger.

However, he was the one who invited Lord Spirit Sound to be the witness to this duel. The conditions could not be changed.

“Hmph, so what if he passed Level Two? Perhaps he was just lucky! Yes, it was pure luck, his strength might not be that strong after all.” Tian Quan comforted himself, “I’ve achieved a breakthrough in that Secret Skill and my strength has increased greatly. I’m not that far away from Level Two. This fight is unnecessary, it might even be possible that I beat him!”

Comforting himself like that, a streak of light flashed in his gaze. His expressions turned crazy and he started the fight straight away.

Shoosh!

Tian Quan launched a sudden attack and he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in an instant. At that moment when he moved, a burning flame appeared on his back. This flame burned the air and it instantly formed an image of an Exotic Beast on Tian Quan’s back.

The flaming Exotic Beast was struggling and it was emitting an extremely strong aura.

“Is this the Secret Skill that he has been cultivating?” Jian Wushuang frowned at the image of that Exotic Beast.

He had taken a look at the introductions of the nine strongest Secret Skills of Star Island. Tian Quan had exhibited one of the Secret Skills that could raise one’s offensive power, which was considered hard to acquire. He had already managed to control this skill quite well, the proof was the image on his back.

Although Tian Quan’s aura skyrocketed with the appearance of the image, Jian Wushuang was not taken aback at all.

“There’s no need to waste time dealing with him.”

Jian Wushuang felt a tug in his head and he transformed into the Gold-armored Ancient God. Right afterward, sword shadows immediately shot out from his Interspatial Ring.

These shadows instantly came together in the Void, forming a two-feet long scarlet longsword.

This longsword was extremely sharp and had a terrifying aura. At the moment it was formed, a black thunderbolt shot out from Jiang Wushuang’s body into the longsword. It caused the sword’s aura to skyrocket.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang hushed lowly and the blade immediately flashed across the Void and appeared in front of Tian Quan. After breaking through the Void easily, the longsword aimed for Tian Quan’s head.

It all happened too fast, the crowd did not have enough time to react. However, that was not the case for Tian Quan. The black long spear that he was holding was ready to be launched. It aimed straight to the front.

This pierce created a huge hole in the Void.
