Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was a new day, the sky had just lit up.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

The deep ringing of an ancient bell resonated across the imperial palace.

There was a huge floating platform with a large flight of stairs in the center. Experts of varying powers in Tang of the East had gathered next to the stairs, their attention on the two figures which were making their way forward hand-in-hand.

Clothed in a luxurious silk robe with an intricate golden dragon embroidery design, Jian Wushuang looked especially captivating.

Leng Rushuang was dressed in a striking long red dress which was embellished with the image of a fire phoenix. Completing the look was a golden phoenix crown, which showed off her unmatchable beauty.

One was the most exceptional genius recognized by Green Fire World, the legendary figure of Tang of the East.

The other was the most stunning woman of Green Fire World, Emperor Xiao’s daughter and Princess of Tang of the East.

They were a perfect match.

As they ascended the stairs and arrived at the center of the platform, bright smiles broke across the faces of Tang Emperor and Xue Lingtian, who were in the seats of honor.

“Bow to heaven and earth!”

In the presence of the experts, the simple wedding ceremony was completed.

The ceremony was followed by a lively and large-scaled banquet that extended throughout the imperial palace. Jian Wushuang celebrated the joyous occasion with the experts with tosses of drinks. The banquet only came to an end late at night.

In the wedding chamber.

Jian Wushuang headed back to his wedding room after entertaining the guests all day long at the banquet. Stepping into the room, he shook his body to get rid of the tipsy feeling.

His eyes immediately laid onto Leng Rushuang, who was quietly sitting on the edge of the bed and waiting for him.

Walking up, he sat down in front of her.

“Shuang’er.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Rushuang affectionately. With his fingers, he caressed her hair on both sides of her forehead.

“You look really breathtaking.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Leng Rushuang leaned towards Jian Wushuang without a word.

With a gentle smile, Jian Wushuang kissed her and did not pull back for a long while.

“Shuang’er, I want you!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with desire. He laid Leng Rushuang down onto the bed and slowly leaned towards her.

A passionate and delightful wedding night followed.

No words were exchanged between the newlyweds. They merely expressed their love towards each other through their actions.

When Jian Wushuang woke up the next morning, Leng Rushuang was sitting at the table.

“You forgot about the cross-cupped wine last night. It’s time to make up for it now.” Leng Rushuang said while looking at him with a tender expression.

Momentarily stunned, Jian Wushuang could only look at her. Noticing the wine glasses on the table, he stood up immediately and walked towards her with a grin.

The wine glasses were filled with wine.

“As a representation of our eternal love, let’s drink up.” Jian Wushuang took a wine glass in his hands and brought it before his wife.

Picking up her wine glass, Leng Rushuang gave a slight quiver that escaped Jian Wushuang’s notice.

They crossed the wine glasses and consumed all the wine.

“The wine has a great taste.” Jian Wushuang commented. The wine left a strong aftertaste in his mouth.

“It’s been some time since you have listened to me playing the Chinese zither. What do you say about me playing a tune for you today?” Leng Rushuang said smilingly.

“That would be amazing.” Jian Wushuang beamed.

With a wave of her hand, a Chinese zither appeared in front of Leng Rushuang. Her slender fingers plucked the strings gently.

The soul-stirring music slowly travelled across the room.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and listened carefully.

The tune was sweet and melodious, yet it portrayed mixed feelings of kinds.

These mixed feelings were complicated beyond words.

The tune conveyed feelings of pain, sorrow, and particularly helplessness.

As he listened on, Jian Wushuang’s brows came together in a knit.

Leng Rushuang had stopped playing, but the echo of the music remained in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang lifted his lids slowly. A flash of doubt appeared in his eyes.

“Shuang’er, we just got married. You should be elated, but your music…” Jian Wushuang started.

“Heartbreaking, isn’t it?” Leng Rushuang looked at him.

Seeing the look in Leng Rushuang’s eyes, Jian Wushuang’s heart sank with a tremble.

Leng Rushuang had tried to keep her pain and helplessness to herself, but her eyes reflected depths of despair. Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, a feeling of dread descending upon him.

“The tune I just played is called… ‘See You in the Next Life’.” Leng Rushuang said slowly.

“‘See You in the Next Life?’ What do you mean? You…” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed dramatically. Trying to stand up, he found that he was suddenly too weak to do so. Not knowing why, he realised that he had lost even the strength to move his fingers.

“What is happening? What in the world is going on here?”

Jian Wushuang was in a fit of shock and rage, but unable to utter any word, he could only roar madly internally.

“Wine, it’s the wine I just drank!” Jian Wushuang stared at the wine glasses in front of him with wide eyes.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m sorry!” Leng Rushuang said in a grief-stricken voice.

“I’m a Great Sinner. You’re too good for me… I’m already contented to be your wife for one day!”

“Sorry? No, no, I don’t want your apologies, no!”?Jian Wushuang growled crazily inside. He fixed his eyes stubbornly on Leng Rushuang, but was unable to say a single word.

“Jian Wushuang, goodbye!”

“If there exists the next life, I would love to be your wife again!”

“You and I… Let’s see each other in the next life!”

Leng Rushuang’s voice was filled with sorrow. Tears rolled down her face uncontrollably.

“No, no!”?Jian Wushuang broke down. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Gu King, quick. Stop her! Help me to stop her!”?Jian Wushuang shouted internally with all his might.

Gu King, who was resting inside of Jian Wushuang’s body, remained silent and failed to respond despite hearing the pleas.

Jian Wushuang stared at Leng Rushuang with wild eyes. Leng Rushuang gave him a last smile, turned around slowly and flew away.

“No!”

Jian Wushuang let out a thunderous roar inside. The wine took its effect and he was wiped out.

The wine was called Bloody Flame.

Originating from Eternal Chaotic World, the wine required long years of cultivation by a hard-drinking expert.

The wine was so potent that a cup is enough to sink Dao Masters, Celestial Masters, and even supreme experts like Tang Emperor into a drunken condition for seven days and nights. Jian Wushuang, an Eternal Realm expert, was no match for the strength of the wine.

When Jian Wushuang was in the Ancient World, to stop his friends from taking risks with him, he had used the Three-day Drunk to intoxicate them.

The same scenario repeated itself. But this time, Jian Wushuang played the role of the victim.
