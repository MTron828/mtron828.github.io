Chapter 334: I Leave This Person to You, Fourth Sister!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

After the battle broke out, deafening and frightful booms resounded in succession throughout heaven and earth. At the same time, the dispersed aftereffects of the exchanges between the two teams of experts also swept devastatingly toward the crowd of experts, of which many had already ascended into the Void where they continued to watch the battle from a distance.

While Jian Wushuang’s lineup could be said to be magnificent, Ice Nether Valley’s team was not weak either. By coordinating with each other, these experts of the Saint Realm managed to hold back the sextet comprising of Wine Master, Lady Black, the Wind and Rain Immortals, Old Weirdo Yunyang, and Chi Mei.

But the two men Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan... the Ice Nether Valley had to deploy several half-saints, as well as experts of the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, to hold them back as their experts of the Saint Realm were already fully occupied.

As a result, Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were practically unrestrained.

Their battle strengths were, after all, far beyond that of an average expert of the Saint Realm. How could these half-saints and experts hope to hold them back?

“Second Brother, I shall leave these people to you while I take on Ye Chen,” Jian Wushaung spoke icily.

“Okay,” Yang Zaixuan acknowledged in a similar voice.?He casually thrust the blood-red saber in his hand, and instantly, a blood-red Flowing Light swept past an elder and scythed him fatally.

“Ye Chen.”

There was a heavy Force of Gale and Thunderbolt built up on Jian Wushuang’s body, which then transformed into a ray of lightning that beamed into the Void and appeared in front of Ye Chen in a split second. An astonishing blast of Sword Essence surged toward Ye Chen while making a diffusive noise.

“Young Valley Master and respectful Master Saint, do you have the guts to fight with me?”

Ye Chen looked over at Jian Wushuang. The fury in his heart could no longer be contained and thus erupted at once.

“Bastard!”

“Everything is because of this bastard!”

Ye Chen’s eyes became hostile while his complexion twisted.

The day was proceeding according to plan at first, but Jian Wushuang’s appearance ruined the marriage, and he even uncovered Master Saint’s true colors, completely destroying the image which the latter had long been building up.

From this day forth, it was likely that Master Saint’s name would only be mentioned as a joke by experts throughout Nanyang Continent.

And all this was because of Jian Wushuang.

An ice-cold killing intent gushed out of Ye Chen’s body while a pale golden long spear unanticipatedly appeared in his hand. The spear possessed impressive power and was clearly an exceptional magic weapon.

“Damn you!”

As Ye Chen glared at Jian Wushuang, his body suddenly charged forth.

Boom! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When he struck out with the spear, a brutal power burst forth like the eruption of a volcano and instantly produced a jarring boom in the Void.

The sight of this drew admiration from many of the spectating experts.

Master Saint’s renown was profoundly related to his strength, and was not just because of the disposition he had all along been faking.

Although he had only cultivated the Spiritual Power of the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, he had once fought with a true expert of the Saint Realm and clearly held the upper hand.

The height of his talents certainly belonged to the top tier of the entire Nanyang Continent.

The power of the spear which Ye Chen was showing off at the moment had already reached the threshold of the experts of the Saint Realm.

However, Jian Wushuang simply curled the corners of his lips as he met the explosive spear with a very casual thrust of the purple-tipped sword in his hand.

As casual as it was, when it collided with the spear head-on...

Bam!

An intensely violent noise sounded. Ye Chen’s pupils constricted abruptly, and subsequently, he spewed out a mouthful of blood in front of the horrified crowd, while his body was flung backward like a cannonball.

This was what happened in only one exchange.

Jian Wushuang’s casual exertion was all it took to outclass and defeat Ye Chen.

Yet, Jian Wushuang had also only cultivated the Spiritual Power of the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

“How is this possible?”

Ye Chen painfully stood up firm and once more cast his eyes, which had become aghast like never before, upon Jian Wushuang.

As Master Saint, he had always been considered an elite talent throughout Nanyang Continent. Facing a person who was of a similar cultivation as him, however, he was thoroughly defeated and heavily injured by a very casual stroke.

Why was this so?

Hoo!

A ray of lightning whizzed toward him and arrived less than a meter in front of him in the blink of an eye.

With a long sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang gazed at Ye Chen from a close distance and revealed a jocose smile at the corner of his lips. “A Master Saint as dignified as you only have this level of ability?”

“You, you...” Ye Chen looked in disbelief at Jian Wushuang.

The latter’s eyes flashed a glimmer of disdain, following which he struck out furiously with his sword once more.

In his vain attempt to resist, Ye Chen hastily raised his long spear.

Bam!

A frightening force smashed onto Ye Chen’s spear. Ye Chen immediately felt an unprecedentedly powerful transmission which caused the energy and blood in his body to swirl. He spewed out another mouthful of blood as his body collapsed violently on to the ground below.

Many of the onlooking experts were dumbstruck by what they had just seen.

They had never imagined that Master Saint Ye Chen would be this resistless against an expert of the same level as him.

That’s right, the disparity in strength between them was so big that he showed completely no resistance.

In the camp of the Holy Emperor Palace, the muscular and stocky elder continued to fix his attention on Jian Wushuang. His pupils constricted when he saw the heavy Force of Gale and Thunderbolt gushing forth from Jiang Wushuang’s body.

“Is that... the Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt?”

As one of the superior second-grade manuals in Holy Emperor Palace, it was certainly familiar to this elder.

“He’s much stronger than Master Saint Ye Chen even though he’s also in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. What’s more, the Origin Energy which his exertions carry contain World Origin and also Slaughter Origin previously...”

“Jian Wushuang!”

“Make no mistake, he’s indeed Jian Wushuang!”

The elder’s eyes projected a wicked sparkle when he thought of this.

Ye Chen had dropped into a deep pit in the Drill Ground. When he managed to stand up scrabbling, the ray of lightning flashed once more and Jian Wushuang reappeared in front of him. This time, however, Jian Wushuang clenched his left hand and punched it with an immense power directly into Ye Chen’s abdomen.

Because its speed was too fast, Ye Chen had absolutely no time to resist.

Bam!

A low and deep voice sounded. Ye Chen spewed blood for the third time and his complexion became ghostly pale at once.

“My dantian?” Ye Chen felt his entire being as if struck by millions of thunderbolts and became completely desensitized.

After destroying Ye Chen’s dantian, Jian Wushuang casually slapped a palm on Ye Chen. Like a dead dog, Ye Chen was flung dozens of meters away and finally landed on the Drill Ground.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked over at Su Rou, who was fighting with Feng Daoyang in a nearby Void.

His callous voice began to reverberate between heaven and earth.

“I leave this person to you, Fourth Sister! You may make him die in whatever way you want!”
